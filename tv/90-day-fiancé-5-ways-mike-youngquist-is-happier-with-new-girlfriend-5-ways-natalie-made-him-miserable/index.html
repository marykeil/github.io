<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Natalie made Mike frustrated throughout their marriage 90 Day Fiancé. However, Mike seems to have put it behind him with a new romance.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Mike Youngquist looks delighted with his new girlfriend after his tumultuous relationship with Natalie Mordovtseva. Mike made his reality TV debut on 90 Day Fiancé season 8, documenting his relationship with Natalie after they met through mutual friends and his subsequent trip to Ukraine to meet the model. After their second meeting in Paris, Mike proposed in front of the Eiffel Tower, but it quickly became evident that Mike and Natalie were far from the perfect couple. The pair had different opinions on religion, children, and food. Natalie would also go on to accuse Mike of cheating, which led to her returning the engagement ring.
Mike and Natalie looked done with each other until they returned for 90 Day Fiancé season 8 when Natalie moved to the U.S. and into Mike&rsquo;s Sequim home. Still, the development led to more arguments between the couple, sometimes involving Natalie and Mike&rsquo;s mother, Trish, clashing. Natalie and Mike&rsquo;s marriage lasted just months till she moved out of his home and started dating a man called Josh Weinstein in Florida. After the separation, Mike has moved on with his new girlfriend, Sara Rose, and the 90 Day Fiancé star, who looks much happier, hopes to put the misery Natalie subjected him behind.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>10  Mike Youngquist Gushes Over His &ldquo;Sugar&rdquo;
(Happier With New Girlfriend)</p>
<p>During the period Mike was on 90 Day Fiancé, he looked mostly miserable and stoic due to the state of his relationship with ex-partner Natalie. However, off the show, Mike has looked happy in recent times, most especially because of his new relationship with Sara. Since June 2023, when Mike went Instagram official with the mystery lady, his social media posts have been about their love life and how grateful he is for having Sara in his life.
In December, Mike uploaded a clip of himself on a date with his new girlfriend with the caption, “Missing my sugar so much I love you baby always.” Disappointingly, fans never got to see this sweet side of Mike while he was on 90 Day Fiancé due to the toxicity of his relationship with his then-partner Natalie. Still, it’s great to see Mike has found happiness with another lady.</p>
<p>9  Natalie Kept Trying To Change Mike Youngquist<br>
(She Made Him Miserable)</p>
<p>Natalie&rsquo;s inability to accept Mike&rsquo;s lifestyle and her attempts to change everything about his lifestyle created a significant crack in their relationship. Once Natalie arrived at Mike&rsquo;s home, she immediately set about dictating his food habits. Natalie complained about Mike eating French toast and, instead of accepting his carnivore lifestyle, forced Mike to go on a week-long diet of just eating vegetables. Natalie also constantly threw a fit about Mike drinking any form of alcohol, which resulted in a huge fight between the two. Mike knew he would have to make sacrifices in his relationship with Natalie, but he didn&rsquo;t appreciate changing his whole eating and drinking habits.</p>
<p>8  Scorpio Mike Youngquist Is Dating Another Cancer Woman<br>
(Happier With New Girlfriend)</p>
<p>The union between a Scorpio and a Cancer can be pretty problematic since both are very domineering and can struggle to give in to each other’s demands. Also, Cancer is emotionally expressive, while Scorpio tends to be reserved, which can create a disconnect between the two. Being a Cancer, Natalie gave no inch to Mike&rsquo;s demands and was often overly expressive of what she thought and felt, while Mike, a Scorpio, took all of Natalie&rsquo;s whims till he couldn&rsquo;t any longer.
However, it seems Mike doesn&rsquo;t factor in zodiac sign compatibility when deciding on a partner because his new girlfriend Sara is also cancer since her birthday falls on July 7. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom for Scorpio and Cancer couples, since they can form a unique bond and bring the best out of each other if they can find an effective way to deal with their differences. Hopefully, Mike and Sara will be able to work things out and accept each other&rsquo;s differences with more empathy and love for the sake of their relationship.</p>
<p>7  Natalie Couldn&rsquo;t Get Along With Mike&rsquo;s Mother Trish
(His Ex Made Him Miserable)</p>
<p>Watching how poorly Natalie treated Mike, it wasn&rsquo;t surprising to see how she struggled to get along with Mike&rsquo;s mother, Trish. Not only did Trish try to stop the wedding between Mike and Natalie by trying to get Mike&rsquo;s neighbor, Tamara Authier, to object, but Trish also questioned why Natalie wouldn&rsquo;t try to get a job to support Mike. Natalie and Trish got into several heated arguments, most notably during a Thanksgiving dinner where Natalie alleged Trish called her hooker.
Trish would later throw shade at Natalie about the Ukrainians&rsquo; multiple failed marriages and not having a child yet. The pair&rsquo;s tense conversations made the whole dinner experience uncomfortable for Mike. Still, Mike was ultimately unable to create a cordial relationship between Natalie and his mother till his marriage ended.</p>
<p>6  Mike Youngquist Seems To Be Taunting Natalie Mordovtseva
(Happier With New Girlfriend)</p>
<p>Although Mike&rsquo;s frequent media postings of his new girlfriend Sara might be his genuine attempt to show off his new relationship, it&rsquo;s quite difficult to ignore that it might also be an attempt to spite his ex-wife Natalie. It&rsquo;s common knowledge within the 90 Day Fiancé universe that Natalie visits Mike&rsquo;s Instagram page, and she sometimes likes or leaves comments under his posts. Since Mike also knows this, it&rsquo;s not far-fetched to think that some of his heavily worded captions lauding his new girlfriend, Sara, might also serve as an indirect dig at Natalie, who did nothing but make his life miserable.</p>
<p>5  Natalie Mordovtseva Hated Mike Youngquist&rsquo;s Home &amp; Work Habits
(She Made Him Miserable)</p>
<p>Once Natalie made it to the U.S. and into Mike&rsquo;s Sequim home, nothing he did made her happy. One of the first things Natalie complained about was Mike&rsquo;s home, saying it looked like a horror movie set or a trailer. Natalie complained about feeling constantly cold in the house, noted that the house was dirty and that there were only trees around. Mike would leave home at 3:45 am and return at eight or nine at night. Mike&rsquo;s long hours meant Natalie spent significant parts of the day alone, which didn&rsquo;t also suit her and resulted in many complaints from the Ukrainian.</p>
<p>4  Mike Teased Fans With Mystery Pic Of His New Girlfriend<br>
(Happier With New Girlfriend)</p>
<p>Mike knew the reaction he would get from 90 Day Fiancé fans when he posted a picture of himself with a lady on his Instagram on June 3, 2023. To add intrigue to the situation, Mike covered up the face of the lady to keep her identity hidden. As expected, 90 Day Fiancé fans took to the comment section to ask if Mike was dating someone new and the mystery woman&rsquo;s identity. A fan _143_prince wrote, “Uncover that poor girls FACE!” After Mike&rsquo;s tumultuous relationship with Natalie on 90 Day Fiancé ended, he has been more laid back and seemed to relish teasing fans about his new relationship.</p>
<p>3  Natalie Wanted Kids But He Wasn&rsquo;t Ready<br>
(Natalie Made Him Miserable)</p>
<p>One of the most pivotal disagreements between Mike and Natalie on 90 Day Fiancé was their contrasting positions on whether to have kids. Natalie claimed to have left her eight-year marriage because her ex-husband couldn&rsquo;t give her kids, and being in her late 30s, Natalie felt the biological door of birthing kids was closing. Despite Natalie&rsquo;s strong desire to have kids, Mike wasn&rsquo;t on the same page with her, and this contributed largely to their numerous disputes. Natalie&rsquo;s consistent nagging about Mike&rsquo;s reluctance to have kids made him miserable and was instrumental in their eventual breakup.</p>
<p>2  Mike Youngquist Can&rsquo;t Stop Smiling<br>
(He&rsquo;s Happier With New Girlfriend)</p>
<p>For most of his time on 90 Day Fiancé, Mike never looked fully happy with Natalie, as the pair were almost always arguing. The few times they seemed to enjoy being together were far between. However, since Mike unveiled his new girlfriend, Sara, the 90 Day Fiancé star has been beaming joy and positivity via social media posts. Mike looks a different person to the frustrated figure fans saw on the show and now looks very happy and is always seen smiling and enjoying life in most of his recent pictures and videos. Mike looks laid back and stress-free and these changes are undoubtedly attributed to his new romance.</p>
<p>1  Mike May Have Found His Forever Match<br>
(Natalie Made Him Miserable)</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Mike&rsquo;s relationship with new girlfriend Sara, the 90 Day Fiancé star looks to have found a new lease of life. Mike never shies away from admitting how much Sara means to him, and his captions on Instagram serve as a major indication of just how grateful he is to have found his perfect match. In one of his posts with Sara on Instagram, Mike captioned it “Blessed by the God of the universe for this one-of-a-kind person means the world to me.” After his troubled romance in the past, Mike seems to have found his dream woman, and hopefully, their relationship stands the test of time.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
