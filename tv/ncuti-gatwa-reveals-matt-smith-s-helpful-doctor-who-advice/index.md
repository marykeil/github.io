## Literature Review
New Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa reveals the valuable advice Matt Smith gave him as he began his time on the beloved science-fiction show.




Ncuti Gatwa reveals the helpful Doctor Who advice given to him by former star Matt Smith. Audiences were introduced to the Fifteenth Doctor (Gatwa) near the end of the 60th anniversary special, when David Tennant&#39;s version of the Time Lord bi-generated. Prior to Doctor Who season 14, Gatwa explained that he re-watched past episodes for inspiration, including some from the original series. Over the years, many actors have portrayed the time-traveling character, and Smith, who starred as the Eleventh Doctor in seasons 5 through 7, has become a fan-favorite.




During a recent interview with Collider, Gatwa discussed being self-critical of his performance in Doctor Who, and revealed Smith&#39;s advice about joining the series. Smith informed Gatwa that he had similar concerns, but reminded the actor to be confident in his work, and to have fun. Read Gatwa&#39;s comments regarding Doctor Who and the advice he was given below:


&#34;It&#39;s such a prestigious role, and as actors you want to do your best by it. You&#39;ll beat yourself up if you don&#39;t feel like you have. And so I remember doing that throughout Season 1, just being like, &#39;I just feel like I&#39;m ruining it all.&#39; Talking to Matt about it, Matt was like, &#39;I was exactly the same. I just felt like every day I was so hard on myself and felt like I wasn&#39;t doing a good enough job, but trust me, you are. If they say that you are, then you are,&#39; and like, &#39;I know the role means a lot to you and you want to do your best by it, but also remember to enjoy it.&#39;&#34;






 Other Doctor Who Stars Have Offered Gatwa Support 
          

Gatwa mentioned the significance of being cast as the Doctor and, given the show&#39;s popularity, it&#39;s hard to imagine the kind of pressure that role brings. However, the actor has been shown a lot of support, not only from Smith, but other Doctor Who stars, including Jodie Whittaker, who advised him to enjoy the process. Gatwa previously revealed that he was applying everything he learned from these former Doctor Who actors, and that, although the experience may be chaotic, he&#39;s having a good time.

Following confirmation that Gatwa would portray the Fifteenth Doctor, and that Disney&#43; would feature episodes, a lot has been teased about the upcoming Doctor Who installments. Audiences can expect to see the Time Lord interact with new companion Ruby Sunday (Mille Gibson), and likely address the bi-generation that occurred. Back in November, Tennant, who plays another iteration of the Doctor that&#39;s still alive, shared his excitement over Doctor Who&#39;s future and Gatwa&#39;s tenure.




                  Doctor Who&#39;s Shocking New Bi-Generation Explained   David Tennant and Ncuti Gatwa have made Doctor Who history with the Doctor&#39;s first ever bi-generation, but what does it mean for the future?    

It will be interesting to see where Doctor Who goes next, and how Gatwa&#39;s depiction of the character evolves over the course of these next few seasons. With advice from Smith and other stars, and what&#39;s been shown in the previous specials, Gatwa will likely be a great Fifteenth Doctor. Hopefully, his predecessors will continue to feel the same as well.



Doctor Who season 14 is currently scheduled to premiere in May 2024.
