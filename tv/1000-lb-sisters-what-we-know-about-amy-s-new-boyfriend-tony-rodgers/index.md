## Literature Review
1000-lb Sisters star Amy Slaton&#39;s been showing off her man online. He stars in some of her recent TikToks. Is Tony Rodgers her forever match?




1000-lb Sisters star Amy Slaton&#39;s breakup with Michael Halterman was all too public, but that hasn&#39;t stopped her from showing off her new man, Tony Rodgers. Clearly, Amy&#39;s all about moving on, as she&#39;s flaunting her romance at TikTok. To date, neither Slaton sister&#39;s love life has been smooth sailing. Tammy Slaton and Caleb Willingham had problems before he tragically passed away. He was 40 years old, and the cause of death hasn&#39;t been revealed. Amy started out strong with Michael, but grew frustrated with her partner because he didn&#39;t help out enough at home. Eventually, she bailed out.




1000-lb Sisters season 5 started on December 12, 2023, so it&#39;s a great time to catch up with Amy. Since she&#39;s active online, she has shared some interesting facts about her post-split life. Aside from posting photos of her children, Gage and Glenn, she&#39;s opening up about her boyfriend, Tony. Her divorce with Michael made headlines, but wasn&#39;t showcased in the last 1000-lb Sisters installment. Their differing parenting styles drove them apart, but there are still unanswered questions. It&#39;s possible that there was a domestic dispute. Michael allegedly got &#34;violent&#34; and started throwing household items around, as per The Sun. This incident happened shortly before their divorce filing.

&#34;The sparks just flew and I knew I had to go for it.&#34; 




In the same interview, she did touch on her divorce, reminding her fans that being &#34;vulnerable&#34; in a relationship is important. When discussing the end of her marriage with Michael, she said:



&#34;I don&#39;t really know what the final breaking point was. It was a struggle for a while and the love wasn&#39;t there like it used to be. With two kids, things just got harder and I knew things had to change.&#34;
