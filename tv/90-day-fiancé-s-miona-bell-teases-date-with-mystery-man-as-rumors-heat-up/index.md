## Literature Review
Amid Jibri split rumors, 90 Day Fiancé season 9 cast member Miona Bell could be dating a new man if her cryptic Instagram video can be believed.




90 Day Fiancé star Miona Bell has left fans wondering if she is now with a mystery man after allegedly splitting up with Jibri Bell. Miona is a 25-year-old Serbian woman who worked as a makeup artist before meeting Jibri, 28. Jibri, who is the lead singer of his band Black Serbs, had been touring her country when they crossed paths and soon got engaged. Miona came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. She didn&#39;t like living with Jibri&#39;s parents in their South Dakota home. The couple moved to Palm Springs, California, after getting married in November 2021. However, Miona and Jibri aren&#39;t together on their second wedding anniversary.




Jibri and Miona sparked split rumors in October 2023. Miona removed all of Jibri&#39;s photos and videos from her Instagram feed, including their wedding photos, while Jibri flew to Thailand to seek spiritual enlightenment. Meanwhile, 90 Day Fiancé fans suspect Miona already has a new man in her life because of a video she recently posted on her Instagram Stories (as shared by @ealitytvgurl).


 

Monsters &amp; Critics reported that Miona enjoyed a romantic night out with an unknown man in a Palm Springs restaurant. She first focused the camera on her left hand, perhaps to show the lack of a wedding ring on her finger.

 Miona Bell Slams Fan Who Asked Her About Jibri Split Rumors 
          

As Miona scanned the camera on the table to show her fancy dinner spread, she lingered momentarily over the hands of her dinner partner as he cut into the steak on his plate. Miona did not tag her friend or talk about him in the video. The hands didn&#39;t belong to Jibri as the person had much darker skin than the 90 Day Fiancé cast member. Miona shared photos of herself taken during the dinner on her Instagram feed. She captioned them, &#34;Dinner at Marilyn Monroe’s favorite restaurant Wearing @mionabeauty Remy Human Hair Extensions color 6/613 22.”


 




A curious follower questioned Miona about her current relationship status with Jibri. &#34;They made their relationship and marriage public. Which means at least a clarification &#39;hey followers me and him decided to go our separate way,&#39;&#34; the fan wrote on Miona&#39;s post and accused her of being an attention seeker. Miona told the fan, &#34;Girl please concentrate on your own life, nobody owns you any explanation, especially not me lmao.&#34; Miona&#39;s rude reply didn&#39;t stop the fan from commenting again. &#34;If you took the time to reply you can take the time for ur fans,&#34; they added. It was the first time that Miona addressed rumors about her and Jibri&#39;s breakup directly.

Miona and Jibri were a 90 Day Fiancé success story. They wore matching outfits, traveled the world together, bought luxury cars, and built a glamorous business together since leaving 90 Day Fiancé season 9. Jibri often bragged about how Miona Beauty made his wife a millionaire within months after she launched her hair extensions business. It is exactly why news of their apparent divorce came as a surprise. Jibri has maintained that he and Miona are still together and married, so it&#39;s unclear what the truth really is.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
