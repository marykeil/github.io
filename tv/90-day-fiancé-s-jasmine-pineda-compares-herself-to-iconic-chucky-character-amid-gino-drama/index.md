## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine has been jokingly comparing herself to infamous pop-culture villains. This time around, it&#39;s a character from Child&#39;s Play.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is twinning with a murderous character from the Child&#39;s Play franchise in her latest social media update. Jasmine is a former school teacher from Panama City who met Gino Palazzolo, who&#39;s from Canton, Michigan, on a dating app. Jasmine&#39;s suspicious nature created trouble in her relationship with Gino. She asked him for evidence and reports while they were still in different countries. Gino still kept a lot of secrets from Jasmine, such as his interactions with his ex-sugar baby. Jasmine also found out that Gino had thrown a bachelor party in a strip club after his sister-in-law happened to spill his secret to his wife-to-be.




Jasmine always reacts by screaming and yelling in such situations, and Gino did not escape her wrath when she threw away her engagement ring. After the most recent 90 Day Fiancé season 10 episode, Jasmine took to Instagram to share an odd post comparing herself to Tiffany Valentine, also known as &#34;The Bride of Chucky.&#34;

          

Jasmine shared a side-by-side photo of herself and Tiffany wearing similar emerald green outfits with large sunglasses covering their faces. The photo of Tiffany was originally shared by Jennifer Tilly back in 2019. Jennifer is a voice actor known for voicing Tiffany. Jasmine captioned her post, &#34;Current mood,&#34; with an unamused face emoji.

Jasmine also added the hashtags &#34;#90dayfiance #aneyeforaneye&#34; to her post about Tiffany and her similarities. Jasmine made a lot of her followers laugh out loud with her unique sense of humor. She recently did something similar when she claimed her latest short-haired look was inspired by Lord Farquaad from Shrek. Meanwhile, some of Jasmine&#39;s fans wanted to discuss what happened in the episode in her comments section. One fan wrote, &#34;Honestly I&#39;d be bothered by the strip club thing as well.&#34; They agreed with Jasmine getting furious at Gino for not telling her about his strip club shenanigans.


 

&#34;It’s completely normal, don’t let anyone call you hurtful names,&#34; someone else told Jasmine. They could have been referring to Gino asking Jasmine to get &#34;help&#34; when she was accusing him of lying. As usual, Gino tried to gaslight Jasmine when all she wanted to know was why he didn&#39;t tell her about his bachelor party. Jasmine was supposed to organize one for Gino when she arrived in the U.S. Jasmine lost her trust in him when she found out that he had sent her private photos to his ex-girlfriend to get revenge. He also couldn&#39;t explain the lip gloss that she found in his car.




Gino has become an expert at making Jasmine look like the bad guy in the relationship. He has always been the one who gets sympathy even when he is guilty. While Jasmine does get some support on social media, it&#39;s hard to say she&#39;s deserving of Gino because of everything he has done for her. Jasmine&#39;s been accused of being a gold digger and ungrateful. She keeps trying to prove her critics wrong with her Instagram posts. However, all of Jasmine&#39;s hard work ends up going down the drain when she screams and shouts at Gino instead of tackling the situation smartly.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
