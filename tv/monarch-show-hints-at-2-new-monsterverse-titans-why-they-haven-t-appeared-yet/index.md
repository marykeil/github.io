Summary

  Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8 introduces two new Titans to the Monsterverse, with more potentially to come.   The show hints at possible monster locations in Siberia and Yucatan, Mexico, though there is uncertainty surrounding the validity of these sightings.

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8 set the stage for two new Titans to join the Monsterverse, while also offering a hint at why neither monster&#39;s existence has been revealed yet. In the span of just a few episodes, Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Monsterverse spinoff has already added a trio of giant monsters to Godzilla and Kong&#39;s cinematic world. From the looks of things, they may be far from the only creatures added to the Monsterverse&#39;s Titan lineup before all is said and done for the series.

As a show with the potential to run for years, there&#39;s all sorts of possibilities Monarch: Legacy of Monsters can explore when it comes to introducing new Titans for Godzilla (and possibly Kong) to fight in the Monsterverse&#39;s future. Episode 2 saw the debut of the mysterious Ion Dragon, a monster linked to an event mentioned in Kong: Skull Island. Alaska&#39;s ice Titan, the Frost Vark, joined the fold in episode 3. And piggybacking off setup from the first episode, the Monsterverse unveiled a brand-new insect Titan in episode 8&#39;s ending.





 Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Teased Locations For Two New Monsterverse Titans 
          

In addition to the monsters it&#39;s featured so far, the series has laid the groundwork for some new ones to show up in future Monsterverse projects. After being asked to compile all of their information on the Titans in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8, Bill Randa and Keiko Miura discussed two potential monster locations. Bill mentioned sightings in both Siberia and Yucatan, Mexico. While Keiko had her doubts about the accuracy of their evidence, other details point to there being some truth to them. The now-defunct Monarch Sciences website previously teased Siberia as a location of interest to Monarch in the lead-up to Godzilla: King of the Monsters&#39; release.



 Monarch&#39;s Show Has Already Explained Why Neither Titan Has Been Discovered 
          




It&#39;s worth noting that the possible existence of monsters in Siberia and Yucatan isn&#39;t supported by Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Through monitor screens, the movie mapped out locations for all the Titans Monarch had identified and named up until that point, and neither Yucatan nor Siberia were included. However, the exchange between Bill and Keiko in the episode helps explain why the two monsters - if they do exist - weren&#39;t in Monarch&#39;s database. It&#39;s made clear during their talk that they don&#39;t have solid proof of a Tian presence in Yucatan or Siberia.

Not impressed with Bill&#39;s &#34;sources,&#34; Keiko declined to include the sightings in Siberia in the file they made for General Puckett in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. Keiko agreed to mention the Yucatan Titan, but noted in the file that the sightings were &#34;unconfirmed.&#34; If Bill and Keiko never developed any further evidence of a Titan being in one of these locations, that would make sense of why no Titans were said to be residing in Yucatan and Siberia in King of the Monsters. Both matters could have been dropped, allowing future installments a chance to explore these teases later.
