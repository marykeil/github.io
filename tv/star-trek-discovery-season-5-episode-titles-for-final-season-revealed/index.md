                  8 Star Trek: Discovery Things To Know Before Season 5   Star Trek: Discovery returns for season 5 in 2024 after a 2-year hiatus, and here&#39;s what you need to know about Captain Burnham&#39;s final adventures.    


 Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 Is Top Secret 
Most details about Discovery&#39;s final season are under wraps
         

Paramount&#43; kept most details about Star Trek: Discovery season 5 under wraps, and the streamer has only released one teaser trailer back in October 2022, and two exclusive clips from Discovery&#39;s final season. What little is known about Discovery season 5 includes three new characters joining the show: L&#39;ak (Elias Toufexis) and Moll (Eve Harlow), former couriers who know Cleveland Booker (David Ajala), and Captain Rayner (Callum Keith Rennie), a pointy-eared Starfleet Captain who is apparently not a fan of Captain Michael Burnham. Discovery season 5&#39;s intergalactic treasure hunt will still showcase the series&#39; signature breakneck action and space battles, and Captain Burnham even rides L&#39;ak&#39;s starship on the hull while at warp.




Star Trek: Discovery season 5 has a two-part finale, and Jonathan Frakes is directing the first half, Discovery season 5, episode 9, &#34;Lagrange Point,&#34; which Frakes likens to an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Producing director Olatunde Osunsanmi is helming what is now the series finale of Star Trek: Discovery, episode 10, &#34;Life, Itself&#34;, a title that takes on an ironic new meaning. Osundanmi oversaw reshoots in spring 2023 before the WGA and SAG-AFTRA dual strikes that turned Star Trek: Discovery season 5&#39;s finale into an ending for the entire series. Thankfully, after a two-year wait, the secrets of Star Trek: Discovery season 5&#39;s 10 episodes will soon be known.
