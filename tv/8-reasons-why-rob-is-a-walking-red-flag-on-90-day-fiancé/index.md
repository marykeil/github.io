## Literature Review
Newcomers Rob and Sophie are airing their romance on 90 Day Fiancé season 10, but Rob is already earning the wrath of viewers for many reasons.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomer Rob Warne is a walking red flag​​​​​​, and there are many reasons why this is true. Rob and his partner, Sophie Sierra, are two budding reality TV stars who are starring in popular series. Though they have only appeared in two episodes, so far, Rob and Sophie are already being discussed heavily among the fanbase. While Sophie has mostly earned a positive reception among viewers, Rob has been called out for his attitude and the way he treats Sophie.
Rob and Sophie are newcomers on 90 Day Fiancé season 10. However, it is currently very uncertain if they will work out even though Rob proposed for a second time upon picking up the British native from the airport. While Rob is content with his life in Inglewood, California, Sophie clearly has concerns about the way they are living. However, she should have concerns about how Rob treats her on 90 Day Fiancé season 10, as he is demonstrating many red flags as a partner.

 8  Rob Doesn’t Prioritize Sophie’s Needs 
He Puts Himself First


 







Rob showed an immediate red flag as soon as Sophie arrived in the U.S., as it became clear he didn’t prioritize her needs or take her concerns seriously. Rob nonchalantly pointed out shootings in the area to a horrified Sophie as they drove to his apartment. However, he refused to consider a move despite her immediate safety concerns. This showed that Rob downplayed Sophie’s needs and was quick to dismiss her. Sophie should seek a partner who can consider her needs seriously and put her safety and comfort first. Rob seems like the kind of person who puts himself first.





 7  He Belittles Sophie’s Requests 
Rob Called Sophie &#34;Spoiled&#34;
        

Rob shocked Sophie during 90 Day Fiancé season 10 when it came to the condition of his apartment. Not only was it not up to her standards, but a major issue arose with the bathroom situation. Sophie was surprised at having to walk outside to use the toilet. However, Rob called her &#34;rich&#34; and &#34;privileged&#34; for wanting a bathroom inside their apartment. This bizarre exchange has earned him plenty of flack as its completely normal to want to use a bathroom inside. The general consensus is that it isn’t spoiled to want a bathroom inside one’s home.





 6  He Wants Sophie To Borrow From Her Parents 
Rob Thinks It&#39;s Fine To Ask For Money
        

90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomer Rob showed more red flags when it came to the topic of money. Sophie shared that Rob wanted her to borrow from her parents when they experienced financial difficulties as a couple. However, the 23-year-old shared that she doesn’t ever do this, as she is fully independent. She added that she felt uncomfortable with Rob’s request. However, he still appears to think it&#39;s fine to ask her parents for money or try to pressure her to get money from them. Rob should respect her boundaries, especially when it comes to Sophie&#39;s family.





 5  Rob Doesn’t Respect Sophie 
Rob Has Pressured Sophie For Sex
        

Unfortunately, it appears that Rob simply doesn’t respect Sophie even though he is planning to marry her. In addition to asking her to borrow money, he depicts her as being a spoiled rich girl. However, Sophie told a far different story about herself and her upbringing. She shared that she&#39;s been working since she was 16 or 17, has her own apartment, and makes her own money. Meanwhile, Rob even tried to pressure an exhausted Sophie for sex after her long flight despite her being jet lagged and not in the mood. Unfortunately, Sophie did not seem disturbed by his behavior.

 4  He Mocks Sophie’s Background 
Is Rob Jealous Of Sophie?
        

Rob further demonstrates a lack of respect for Sophie by how he mocks and discusses her background. Not only does Rob portray his future wife as a spoiled rich girl, but he also discusses her in an unfavorable tone. Given Sophie’s background of working as a waitress and getting her own apartment, it doesn’t make sense as to why he portrays her as being spoiled. Rob appears to be jealous or spiteful that Sophie was raised perhaps in better conditions than him and is constantly using this against her. This is not a sign of a loving and respectful relationship.





 3  Rob Cheated On Sophie 
Rob Exchanging Videos With Another Woman


 







Rob’s red flags were made very clear when Sophie shared that he cheated on her. She revealed that she first met Rob online. When they were separated during the pandemic, Rob was exchanging videos with another woman behind her back. This violated his relationship with Sophie and caused her great pain. She now has jealousy and trust issues after the incident. Rob appeared more focused on his own satisfaction than considering his future with Sophie or thinking about her feelings.





 2  He Doesn’t Take Accountability 
Rob Shuts Sophie Down When She Calls Him Out


While some couples can move past infidelity, Rob didn’t take any accountability for what he did. When 90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomer Sophie tries to talk to him about her hurt feelings and trust issues, he gets annoyed and shuts her down. Rob even denied cheating and downplayed what happened. This is a massive red flag as it shows he did not regret what happened as he didn’t understand how it was wrong and can’t demonstrate how he can grow from it. Sadly, Sophie’s feelings were not heard, as Rob fought to silence her and end the conversation in order to save face.





 1  Rob Still Gives Sophie Reasons To Doubt Him 
Rob&#39;s Not Ready For A Relationship


Sophie left behind her entire life in the UK to be with Rob on 90 Day Fiancé season 10. On the other hand, Rob isn’t helping her get over her trust issues, and he also isn’t giving her any reasons to feel secure in their relationship. In fact, Rob is only giving Sophie reasons to doubt him, as she caught him looking at an Instagram page full of presumably scantily dressed women, including one dressed as sexy Dora the Explorer when they were together. It&#39;s clear that 90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomer Rob isn’t ready to be in a relationship.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
