## Literature Review
Almost 20 years before he was Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s Captain Liam Shaw, Todd Stashwick reminds us he wore pointy ears on Star Trek: Enterprise.




Star Trek: Picard season 3 breakout actor Todd Stashwick reminds fans that he appeared in Star Trek before his role as the prickly but lovable Captain Liam Shaw. Stashwick more than held his own in his debut Picard season 3 scene against Patrick Stewart&#39;s Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes&#39; Captain Will Riker, and Jeri Ryan&#39;s Commander Seven of Nine. While Shaw initially drew fans&#39; ire for his cold and dismissive treatment of Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s legends and Seven of Nine, Liam became a surprise fan favorite after he revealed his tragic backstory in a riveting monologue delivered by Stashwick.




On Twitter/X, Todd Stashwick shared a photo of himself playing Talok on Star Trek: Enterprise, alongside the other actors who donned pointy ears. Talok was a Romulan operative posing as a Vulcan who was part of a Romulan plot to take over the corrupt Vulcan High Command. Stashwick appeared in the Enterprise season 4 episode, &#34;Kir&#39;Shara&#34;, opposite Scott Bakula&#39;s Captain Jonathan Archer, Jolene Blalock&#39;s T&#39;Pol, and Kara Zediker&#39;s T&#39;Pau. Check out Stashwick&#39;s pic with his cheeky &#34;Talok&#34; pun caption in his X post below:

 What Is Todd Stashwick&#39;s Star Trek Future As Captain Liam Shaw? 
Everything depends on if Star Trek: Legacy happens
         

Todd Stashwick is among the Star Trek: Picard actors and creatives who are vocal about wanting Picard season 3&#39;s proposed spinoff, Star Trek: Legacy, to happen. Thousands of fans have continually rallied online to promote Terry Matalas continuing his vision of the 25th century set up by Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s ending. Although Captain Liam Shaw heroically sacrificed himself against the Borg in Picard season 3, episode 9, &#34;Vox,&#34; this isn&#39;t necessarily the end of Picard season 3&#39;s breakout character.

If Star Trek: Picard&#39;s continuation series happens, Terry Matalas has stated there are plans in place to bring back Todd Stashwick as Liam Shaw. While Captain Shaw is deceased, there are certainly sci-fi means to resurrect the Liam Shaw character. Of course, Stashwick would happily come aboard to play what may be his most popular character. It would also be fitting if Star Trek: Legacy was announced in 2024, 20 years after Todd Stashwick played Talok on Star Trek: Enterprise.






Star Trek: Enterprise and Star Trek: Picard are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
