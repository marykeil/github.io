## Literature Review
The Circle season 6 has been confirmed by Netflix, but other details about the show are unknown. Here&#39;s everything to know about the new season. 




The Circle season 6 is just around the corner, and fans are excited about what&#39;s to come for the popular Netflix reality series. The Circle aired its first season on January 1, 2020, which was met with a lot of positive reviews by Netflix watchers. The show is based on the British series of the same name, and the network has since released two other spin-offs with the same name in France and Brazil. The Circle has become a worldwide sensation among reality TV fans, and it seems the show has only become more widespread in the last four years.




The Circle season 5, which began streaming on Netflix on December 28, 2022, and ended on January 18, 2023, was well received. Some of the cast included returning The Circle season 1 contestant Shubham Goel, Brett Robinson, Xanthi Perdikomatis, Chaz Lawery, Raven Sutton, winner Sam Carmona, and so many more. What was cool about season 5 is Xanthi and Brett, who were the first eliminated, returned as a catfish and the pair got to make it all the way to the finale. While they didn&#39;t win, they put up a good fight as the catfish Jennifer, a 51-year-old single dog trainer. Who knows what The Circle season 6 will have in store?

 The Circle Season 6 Latest News 
          




According to Tudum by Netflix, The Circle has been renewed for seasons 6 and 7. While they didn&#39;t reveal when season 6 will air, they did confirm that the show will return sometime in spring 2024. They also revealed where The Circle season 6 will be taking place. For the last few seasons, The Circle was filmed in an apartment complex in a small town in Northern England. However, for seasons 6 and 7, they are moving back to the United States and will be filming in Atlanta, Georgia. New twists are also in store for The Circle season 6; however, they have yet to be revealed by Netflix.



 The Circle Season 6 Potential Release Window 
          

The Circle season 6 will premiere sometime in spring 2024, which Netflix has confirmed. This means fans won&#39;t be able to watch the new season until sometime between March and June 2024. The release of The Circle season 6 is coming later than normal, as the series usually airs two seasons per year. However, The Cirlce didn&#39;t air any seasons in 2023 and has instead saved them for 2024. It&#39;s unclear when The Circle season 7 will air, but it will probably premiere sometime in late 2024, shortly after season 6, if it follows the typical release format for The Circle.






 The Circle Season 6 Potential Cast 
         

As for the cast of The Circle season 6, that has yet to be confirmed as well. The cast for The Circle is usually revealed closer to the release date, so fans will likely not know who is part of the season until late winter to early spring of 2024. It&#39;s possible that season 6 could include some returning cast members like season 5 did when The Circle season 1&#39;s Shubham returned as a catfish.

However, most of the cast will likely be completely new faces. The Circle has always done this for the past five seasons so this presumably won&#39;t change. Last season did include Brett, who was also from Big Brother, so it&#39;s possible they may find contestants from different reality TV shows.



 Has The Circle Season 6 Started Filming? 
          




It has not been confirmed if The Circle season 6 has completed filming or if it&#39;s even started, for that matter. The Circle takes about three weeks to film and is usually filmed around six months before the season airs. It&#39;s very likely that The Circle season 6 has already been filmed or will likely start filming early into the new year. Overall, it&#39;s been a while since fans have watched a new season of The Circle, and are excited for it to air in 2024.



All seasons of The Circle are streaming on Netflix.
