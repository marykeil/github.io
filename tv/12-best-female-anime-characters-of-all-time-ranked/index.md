## Literature Review
Anime is filled with a plethora of great female characters, but the following 12 are some of the best-written women in all anime history.




It&#39;s no understatement to say that women are the backbone of anime, naturally making fans try to rank the greatest female anime characters. While male anime protagonists are still generally the norm, anime still offers a wealth of interesting female characters that can&#39;t help but steal the show. From strong leading ladies to heart-wrenching love interests, no matter the plot or genre of the anime, female anime characters have captured the hearts of fans.
Though stereotypes might reduce women in anime to one-dimensional love interests, the truth is that women in anime are just as diverse as their male counterparts. Though shojo anime is always a great source of female characters, even shonen anime has its share of interesting women. Great female characters can be found in every genre of anime, making ranking the best difficult. In a way, the best female anime characters can almost be considered a reflection of the industry as a whole.









 








 12  Yumeko Jabami - Kakegurui 
Animated By Mappa &amp; Based on the Manga By Homura Kawamoto &amp; Tōru Naomura
        

As the charismatic leading lady from Kakegurui, Yumeko Jabami is the perfect example of an anime character where one doesn&#39;t necessarily have to have watched the series to recognize her. Enrolled in a school for gambling, this thriller anime ranks students by their winnings. A prolific and eccentric gambler, Yumeko&#39;s addiction to the thrill of a game is somehow both exaggerated and realistic, leading her deadly and disturbing expressions work to draw the audience in. While she may not be the most wholesome character, she is certainly an interesting, well-written, and strong female lead in this anime series.

 8  Power - Chainsaw Man 
Animated By Mappa &amp; Based on the Manga By Tatsuki Fujimoto


 







Chainsaw Man is filled with powerful women, and though Power might not be the strongest, she certainly ranks as the most interesting and likable. Power is a deceptive character who is so much more than her first impressions suggest. Initially appearing to Denji and viewers as a completely irredeemable narcissist, Chainsaw Man slowly reveals there are layers to the seemingly one-note heroine. Power&#39;s over-the-top exterior makes it all the more heartwarming when she genuinely bonds and grows to care for her friends Denji and Aki.

Animated By J.C. Staff &amp; Created By Be-Papas
        

Few anime women are as subversive as the titular heroine from Revolutionary Girl Utena.

 2  Chihiro Ogino - Spirited Away 


 







Spirited Away is the only anime film to ever win an Oscar for good reason, and a large part of that is its protagonist, Chihiro. A startlingly accurate portrait of a girl on the edge of adulthood, Chihiro is one of the most realistic anime characters of all time. Though she might initially come across as whiny to some, watching her grow and mature throughout her experiences in the bathhouse is genuinely heartwarming. Chihiro&#39;s journey into adulthood is not an easy one, but that&#39;s what makes it so powerful and what makes her one of anime&#39;s greatest female characters.

What follows is a slow-motion psychological breakdown as Mima&#39;s sense of self and reality deteriorates day by day. Mima&#39;s quest to reclaim her identity isn&#39;t just a fascinating character study, it&#39;s also a brutal deconstruction of the culture of possession surrounding idols. It&#39;s heartbreaking to watch Mima lose her sanity, which makes the brief glimmers of hope all the more uplifting. Mima&#39;s story might have its tragic moments, but it&#39;s ultimately a cathartic story that leaves Mima as anime&#39;s greatest female character.
