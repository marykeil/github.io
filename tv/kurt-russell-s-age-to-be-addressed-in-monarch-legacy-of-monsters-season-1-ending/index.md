Summary

  Lee Shaw&#39;s age in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters will be addressed in the final episodes, implying its importance to the overall plot.   Lee&#39;s youthful appearance may be connected to his knowledge and interaction with the Hollow Earth.   Falling into the Hollow Earth portal at the end of episode 8 means Lee&#39;s age could be addressed in the location.  







Monarch: Legacy of Monsters will be addressing Lee Shaw&#39;s age during its final episodes, explaining why the topic keeps getting brought up. Kurt Russell&#39;s retired colonel is supposedly in his 80s, but other characters in the show continuously bring up how young he looks for his age. Conversations containing this information indicate it&#39;s somehow important to the larger story of the series.

Now, TVLine&#39;s Matt Webb Mitovich claims the topic of Lee&#39;s age will be brought up when Monarch: Legacy of Monsters releases its last two episodes. The implication is that the small detail will be important to how the final part of the season plays out. Check out what Mitovich had to say below:


As for Colonel Shaw being so curiously spry for a very old guy… let’s just say that Kurt Russell’s character addresses that topic, again, before the season is over.



 What Could Lee Shaw&#39;s Age In Monarch Mean? 
          




Lee looking young for his age is brought up prominently in episode 3 when Cate, Kentaro, and May escape Monarch&#39;s facility with him. It continues to be something mentioned by multiple characters throughout the series, a strong indication that his youthful presentation is an important part of the story. However, it has yet to be revealed why his age keeps being mentioned and what it means for the overall plot.

His age may be related to his plans, with episode 8 revealing Shaw&#39;s intent to seal the Hollow Earth so Titans can&#39;t get in or out. The fact he knows about the dangers of the underground world implies he may have seen it himself at one point, motivating his decision to keep it at bay. Perhaps his aging process was altered by an interaction with the secret world, making him seem younger.

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8 saw Lee fall into the Hollow Earth portal alongside Cate and May. Since this means the location will feature prominently in the final episodes, it could be where the former colonel&#39;s age gets addressed. However, it&#39;s unclear what this could mean for the story of the show, or what larger implications his age has on the Monsterverse.
