Summary

  Members of the 110th are under threat in Reacher season 2, and Reacher&#39;s loyalty to the Special Investigations Unit could put their lives in danger.   Reacher owes Tony Swan for saving his life, and his promise to Swan could complicate things in the upcoming meeting between them.   Reacher&#39;s honor and integrity may lead to the failure of the 110th&#39;s mission, as he is unwilling to let his promise to Swan go unfulfilled.  







Reacher season 2 has centered around the titular character&#39;s reunion with his old unit, but reconnecting with one member of the 110th could be riddled with disaster. Based on the Jack Reacher book Bad Luck and Trouble season 2 brings the former military colleagues of Alan Ritchson&#39;s character into the fold. While the reunion may not be voluntary, it hasn&#39;t stopped Reacher from reminiscing about the good old days.

Members of the 110th are all under threat in Reacher season 2, and the crew doesn&#39;t look to be getting any safer. However, season 2, episode 5, &#34;Burial,&#34; has complicated matters even further. Reacher&#39;s loyalty to the Special Investigations Unit is admirable, but it could also get the surviving members of the 110th killed. If he isn&#39;t careful, one of Reacher&#39;s best traits could be his downfall.

                  Reacher Season 3: Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Prime Video&#39;s Reacher is coming back for a third season, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the upcoming episodes.     





 Reacher Owes Swan For Saving His Life 
Swan showed an intense display of loyalty to Reacher.
         

Reacher season 2 has made heavy use of flashbacks, and episode 5, &#34;Burial,&#34; continues the trend. During the process of a drug bust from the 110th&#39;s heyday, Reacher shows the operation being derailed and turning into a shootout. In all the commotion, Tony Swan throws himself into the path of a bullet to save Reacher&#39;s life and also manages to survive. The act shows the undying loyalty that exists within the Special Investigations Unit, but more importantly, the respect that Reacher&#39;s crew has for him.

As Reacher season 2 continues, Tony Swan seems to be more and more involved in the goings-on that threaten the lives of the rest of the 110th. Despite Reacher&#39;s initial reluctance to believe that Swan has since turned on them, he seems to be slowly coming around to the idea. However, Reacher&#39;s pledge to Swan following the act of self-sacrifice in the flashback could be a huge issue going forward.






 Why Reacher Could Be The Reason For The Failure Of The Mission 
Reacher&#39;s consistency may work against him.
          

When tending to Swan&#39;s wounds in the wake of his heroic act, Reacher tells his savior, &#34;I owe you one.&#34; While this may seem like a throwaway phrase in other circumstances, the gravity of the situation and the reputation of the man delivering it transform the statement into a sworn oath. The look on Reacher&#39;s face when he utters the words also shows the depths of his sincerity.

                  All 7 Of Reacher&#39;s &#34;Rules&#34; In The Amazon TV Show Explained   Fans of the Amazon Prime Video TV show know that Jack Reacher has some hard-and-fast &#34;rules.&#34; Here are Reacher&#39;s 7 rules that are the most memorable.    

However, Reacher&#39;s honor and integrity could lead to the ultimate failure of the 110th in their current mission. Reacher is not going to let his promise go unfulfilled, which causes problems for the upcoming meeting between him and Swan for which the show is laying the groundwork. Even if Swan is indeed responsible for the threat to the 110th, Reacher will not let the life debt go unpaid, and any hesitation to take Swan out could result in the deaths of the rest of his unit.






Reacher season 1 is on Prime Video, and Reacher season 2 is currently being released weekly on the same platform.
