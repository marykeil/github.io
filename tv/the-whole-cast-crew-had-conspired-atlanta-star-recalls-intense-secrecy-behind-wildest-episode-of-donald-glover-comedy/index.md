## Literature Review
Atlanta star LaKeith Stanfield, who played Darius, recalls the intense secrecy behind the show’s wildest episode and reflects on the odd experience.




Atlanta star LaKeith Stanfield recalls the intense secrecy behind the show&#39;s wildest episode. Although it was initially presented as a story about Earn (Donald Glover) reconnecting with his cousin, the rapper Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry), to become successful, Atlanta showed its singular strangeness early on. Along with Paper Boi&#39;s friend Darius (Stanfield) and Earn&#39;s ex Vanessa (Zazie Beetz), the foursome found themselves in several unique situations. Still, in the overall history of the FX comedy, &#34;Teddy Perkins&#34; arguably made the strongest impression. The half-hour horror sees Darius visiting a mansion to pick up a free piano. While there, he encounters the unsettling Perkins.




As part of WIRED&#39;s &#34;Autocomplete&#34; video series to promote his new movie The Book of Clarence, Stanfield shared some insight on Atlanta&#39;s Teddy Perkins. In particular, the Oscar nominee recalled the intense secrecy around the fact that it was actually Glover, the show&#39;s star and creator, who was playing Perkins. Stanfield also shares, in the quote below, how Teddy&#39;s true identity was spoiled for him:


I was on Atlanta, and I was preparing to shoot the day before and I saw on the call sheet, there was this guy called Teddy Perkins. And it was Teddy Perkins being played by Teddy Perkins, so I was like, “Who is the actor?” And production was like, “Teddy Perkins.” I googled “Teddy Perkins” and I was like, “Who is this?”, and nothing came up, and I was very confused. I was like, “He’s an actor, how long has been acting?” Next day, I show up on set, there’s no one in the makeup trailer except me, so I’m like, “Okay…”. So, I go to the set, and there’s this guy standing with his back to me, he has long hair. He turns around in this strange way, “This is Teddy Perkins.” I’m confused, because I still don’t know who this is, and I’m like, “Hi, how are you?” He’s like, “[weakly] Hi, how are you?” And then I looked at his feet, and his feet were standing in a similar fashion that I know Donald generally stands in, so I thought that that was weird, but I didn’t really think much of it. His eyes were blue, he didn’t look like him up close, and then one of the crew members finally told me, “[whispering] That’s Donald.” I was in the same time in awe and shock as I was disappointed, because then the illusion was gone and I thought, “How good would that illusion have been if I had just not known who this person is?” And the whole cast and crew had conspired for me not to know, it was successful up to that point, and I still have not and will not release that person’s name.

 


 &#34;Teddy Perkins&#34; Was Pretty Weird (But Atlanta Set A Precedent) 
          

Even though the series debuted as ostensibly being about success in the rap world, a thread that would be revisited from time to time, signs of Atlanta&#39;s interest in deviation and subverting expectation could be seen from the premiere episode. Earn meets a man on a bus, and, in an odd encounter, the stranger starts to muse philosophically. This unique sensibility is carried forward for the rest of the comedy&#39;s run, especially in the last two seasons.

It&#39;s in season 3 that the main foursome&#39;s participation is relatively scaled back. Instead, Atlanta takes on a more anthology approach to tell stories that don&#39;t seem to connect to Earn, Paper Boi, Darius, and Vanessa. While they are more present in the show&#39;s final season, with each character getting a measure of closure, the comedy still finds space to do something truly inspired, such as an alternate history where a Black man was the CEO of Disney, which doubles as a tribute to A Goofy Movie.

The Atlanta season 4 ending, which concluded the show, also raises questions and leaves a lingering impact. The show could be a fairly straightforward dramedy about rivalry, resentment, friendship, and family. At the same time, it would also take incredible swings like &#34;Teddy Perkins,&#34; which few other series would. The absence of its creative spark, after coming to an end in 2022, is still felt.
