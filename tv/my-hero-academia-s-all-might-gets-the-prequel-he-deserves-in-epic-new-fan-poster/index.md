## Literature Review
In a mesmerizing piece of fan art, My Hero Academia fans get a glimpse of what All Might&#39;s life was like before he became the Symbol of Peace.




While no longer a member of the current cohort of Pro-Heroes, All Might, aka One for All, has left an unparalleled impact on the My Hero Academia professional hero system, while fundamentally changing the way criminals attempt to evade and avoid capture. Few can argue that without All Might, Japan would be a less safe place. Despite his influence, the series provides few details of All Might&#39;s backstory and how he became the paragon of justice in My Hero Academia. Now, thanks to an awesome piece of eye-popping fan art, fans can begin to contemplate what an All Might-centered prequel might entail.




As revealed in a recent post to X, formerly Twitter, the artist @cpasDryNa (Nandry) uses a gorgeous piece of fan art to not only advocate for a prequel My Hero Academia series but also suggest that any such series should tell the story leading up to All Might&#39;s rise to become the greatest Pro-Hero and champion for the forces that oppose All For One.


 

The piece depicts what is most likely the most important day in All Might&#39;s life, namely the day he met Nana Shimura, the previous possessor of the One For All abilities.​​​ Nandry positions the two next to each other overlooking a decimated landscape. Next to the two is the caption in Japanese which – loosely translated – means, &#34;a bright flame of hope is born&#34;. It&#39;s a poignant scene that creates a sense of wonder in the viewer as to what Shimura is saying to the future Symbol of Peace, and what must be going through his mind at the moment.





 All Might&#39;s Past Is A Story That Needs To Be Told 
My Hero Academia is originally created by Kohei Horikoshi
         

While spin-off prequels do not always work, especially ones that arise from stories like My Hero Academia that have such a beloved cast of characters, one focusing on All Might is built for success. As Nandry&#39;s artwork suggests, while All Might&#39;s story after he assumes the All For One quirk has been well documented in the series, what is less known - is the journey that led him to become the person he is in the current series. Working backwards from All Might, whose real name is Toshinori Yagi, a prequel could explore his transformation into the No. 1 Pro-Hero. Who is Toshinori? Who did Toshinori used to be? What crisis did becoming All might create or solve? These are all questions a prequel spin-off could explore, and ones that fans would want to see.




The prequel would not need to rewrite All Might&#39;s origin. It is already known that Toshinori was not born with quirk and lived a fairly uneventful life until he met Nana Shimura and became her protégé. It is also known that Toshinori, whose family was killed, had an unwavering sense of justice and a courageousness that belied his young age. While these talents likely convinced Shimura of Toshinori&#39;s potential to take on the All For One quirk, the exact details of her decision to choose him are not explicitly revealed in the story. Again, as Nandry&#39;s artwork suggests; the relationship between Toshinori and Shimura would be an awesome place to center the spin-off story.



 All Might&#39;s Early Years Would Add To My Hero Academia&#39;s Legacy 
          

All Might has both enjoyed tremendous success and suffered abject defeat in his long career as a Pro-Hero. While not a focus in My Hero Academia, his influence is everywhere, especially on the story&#39;s protagonist, Izuku Midoriya. He deserves a fuller exploration of his own story. As Nandry&#39;s fan art imagines, a My Hero Academia spin-off about All Might before he becomes the leading Pro-Hero could be even better than the original.
