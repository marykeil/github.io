## Literature Review
Sometimes killing a character off is more than a shocking twist for the audience. It can change the show so much that things are never the same. 




Character deaths are part of what makes television shows compelling and give the stakes of the world real consequences, but sometimes a character is killed too soon and it ruins the show. Although a character&#39;s death is often heartbreaking, sometimes it&#39;s justified and adds depth to the show&#39;s story arc. A character&#39;s passing can be a strong motivator for the actions of other characters and is an intense emotional experience that can shift the plot&#39;s direction.
Behind the scenes, there are many reasons that a character might be killed off besides the story. Ideally, the creators write in a death because it makes narrative sense, but sometimes it&#39;s because the actor wants to leave the show, or there is a rift caused by creative differences. If this is the case, it can lead to decision-making that ultimately hurts the show and makes the audience question what&#39;s going on off-screen.
            

 10 TV Character Deaths That Changed The Direction Of Their Shows For The Better 
A character&#39;s death is a plot device that opens up numerous opportunities, and sometimes it can be the best thing that has ever happened to the show.





 8  Glenn Rhee - The Walking Dead (2010 - 2022) 
Played by Steven Yeun



 The Walking Dead 

 Release Date   October 31, 2010    Cast   Steven Yeun , Andrew Lincoln , Chandler Riggs , Laurie Holden , Jeffrey DeMunn , Sarah Wayne Callies , Melissa McBride , Norman Reedus , Jon Bernthal , Iron E. Singleton    Genres   Horror , Thriller , Drama    Seasons   11    Story By   Tony Moore, Robert Kirkman, Charlie Adlard    Network   AMC    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , AMC Plus    Franchise(s)   The Walking Dead    Directors   Greg Nicotero    Showrunner   Frank Darabont , Angela Kang , Scott M. Gimple , Glen Mazzara    




In The Walking Dead, characters are constantly put in near-death experiences, and losing members of the team is expected when living through the fallout of a zombie apocalypse. Unfortunately, losing Glenn in season 7 was a major blow to the dynamic of the show, and seemed like an unnecessary tragedy. He was killed by Negan (Jeffery Dean Morgan) in a gruesome act of violence. Though this event happened in the comics, it left a hole in the show. It was clear the show missed him in the way the group always carried his memory with him, and lost the heart and humanity that he brought to the series.





 7  Matthew Crawley- Downton Abbey (2010 - 2015) 
Played by Dan Stevens
        

Matthew&#39;s death in Downton Abbey not only brought the love story between himself and Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) to a tragic close but also left his child fatherless. After making it through World War I, it seemed that Matthew would be safe to live out the rest of his days in peace, but this was not the case. In the wake of his death, the show had to scramble because he was supposed to be Mary&#39;s happy ending. Instead, she had to go back out into the world, and the series introduced new love interests for her that never lived up to the chemistry she had with Matthew.




 6  Michael Cordero Jr. - Jane The Virgin (2014 - 2019) 
Played by Brett Dier
        

 Jane the Virgin 

 Release Date   October 13, 2014    Cast   Gina Rodriguez , Andrea Navedo , Justin Baldoni , Ivonne Coll , Brett Dier , Jaime Camil    Genres   Comedy , Satire    Seasons   5    Story By   Jennie Snyder Urman    Writers   Jennie Snyder Urman    Network   The CW    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , Apple TV&#43;    Directors   Melanie Mayron    Showrunner   Jennie Snyder Urman    




Jane The Virgin was not afraid to make shocking narrative choices and kill off characters in dramatic twists, but no one saw Michael&#39;s death coming. He and Jane (Gina Rodriguez) had finally gotten married and were on track to have the life of their dreams, but this was cut short by a sudden medical complication that killed him, or so the audience thought. The show regretted this choice so much, that a few seasons later they brought him back, but he was a completely different person.
Though Jane and the other characters had a chance to heal from the sudden and tragic loss, the show threw in one more complication by bringing Michael back. He had amnesia and had a whole new personality, so he and Jane no longer connected, in fact, they hardly liked each other. Michael&#39;s death was devastating and ended the central love triangle of the show, but bringing him back was a worse mistake.





 5  Mark Greene - E.R. (1994 - 2009) 
Played by Anthony Edwards
        

It could be argued that E.R. ran for a couple of seasons too long, especially since, after Mark Greene died in season 8, few original cast members remained on the show. Questions were raised as to why E.R. killed off Dr. Greene, but no matter the reason, it was a serious blow to the show. Greene was a significant protagonist of the show up until this point, with much of the story being told from his perspective.
He was a vital part of the hospital and the lives of his fellow doctors, but killing him off was a divisive choice. Other characters had simply moved away or gone to work at another hospital, but his death closed the book on his character permanently. In the wake of his death, E.R. lost part of what made it so compelling and moved into a less successful era.





 4  Poussey Washington - Orange Is The New Black (2013 - 2019) 
Played by Samira Wiley
        

 orange is the new black 

 Release Date   July 11, 2013    Cast   Taylor Schilling , Dascha Polanco , Natasha Lyonne , Samira Wiley , Kate Mulgrew , Danielle Brooks , Michael Harney , Uzo Aduba , Jason Biggs , Laura Prepon    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Rating   TV-MA    Seasons   7    Story By   Piper Kerman    Writers   Jenji Kohan , Piper Kerman    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Showrunner   Jenji Kohan    




Poussey was one of the most empathetic and interesting characters in Orange is the New Black and her death was devastating to both the audience and the women in Litchfield. During a peaceful protest, she is killed by one of the officers in the prison because he restrained her improperly. This loss was shocking and deeply upsetting and changed the narrative and tone of the show significantly. Though the abuse of power and violence within the prison system is an important topic, narratively sacrificing Poussey in this way was a blow to the series, and the remaining seasons were not the same without her. 





 3  Will Gardner - The Good Wife (2009 - 2016) 
Played by Josh Charles
        

 The Good Wife 

 Release Date   September 22, 2009    Cast   Julianna Margulies , Matt Czuchry , Archie Panjabi , Graham Phillips , Makenzie Vega , Josh Charles , Christine Baranski , Alan Cumming , Zach Grenier , Matthew Goode , Cush Jumbo , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , Chris Noth    Genres   Drama    Seasons   7    Story By   Robert King    Writers   Robert King    Network   CBS    Streaming Service(s)   Paramount&#43; , Prime Video , Apple TV&#43; , Netflix    Directors   Robert King    Showrunner   Robert King    




Will&#39;s death in The Good Wife was not just out of nowhere, it was a crushing conclusion to his romance with Alicia (Julianna Margulies) and left the tension of her leaving the firm to go off on her own forever unresolved. He is suddenly shot and killed in a courtroom while arguing a case, in a development that no one saw coming. Almost everyone assumed that Will and Alicia would end up together, and would eventually heal the hurt they&#39;d caused each other. After Will&#39;s death, there was a feeling of unfinished business that tinged the series, and his absence removed a crucial point of tension in the plot.





 2  Lance Sweets - Bones (2005 - 2017) 
Played by John Francis Daley
        

 Bones 

 Release Date   September 13, 2005    Cast   Emily Deschanel , T.J. Thyne , Michaela Conlin , John Francis Daley , David Boreanaz , Tamara Taylor    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   12    Story By   Hart Hanson    Writers   Hart Hanson    Network   FOX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43;    Directors   David Boreanaz    Showrunner   Hart Hanson    




Sweets served as an important balancing factor in Bones. He was somewhere in between the cold logic of Dr. Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and the emotional intuition of Agent Booth (David Boreanaz), which provides additional dramatic tension after Brennan and Booth get together later in the series. Unfortunately, all of this is lost when he is murdered at the start of season 10, creating a change that the show wasn&#39;t ready for. There was no character primed to take his place and serve the role he did in the story, and the show quickly deteriorated, lasting for only two more seasons.

 1  Derek Shepard - Greyâ€™s Anatomy (2005 - ) 
Played by Patrick Dempsey




 Grey&#39;s Anatomy 

 Release Date   March 27, 2005    Cast   Kelly McCreary , Patrick Dempsey , Kevin McKidd , Chandra Wilson , Jesse Williams , Jake Borelli , camilla luddington , Ellen Pompeo , Chyler Leigh , Eric Dane , Caterina Scorsone , Giacomo Gianniotti , Anthony Hill , Kate Walsh , Justin Chambers , Sarah Drew , Greg Germann , Martin Henderson , Katherine Heigl , T.R. Knight , Sara Ramirez , Jerrika Hinton , Richard Flood , Sandra Oh , Kim Raver , Jason George , Tessa Ferrer , Isaiah Washington , James Pickens Jr. , Gaius Charles , Chris Carmack , Brooke Smith , Jessica Capshaw    Genres   Romance , Drama    Seasons   19    Story By   shonda rhimes    Writers   Shonda Rhimes , Julie Wong , Jen Klein , Tameson Duffy , Meg Marinis    Network   ABC    Directors   Rob Corn , Kevin McKidd , Debbie Allen , Chandra Wilson , Allison Liddi-Brown , Jeannot Szwarc , Tony Phelan    Showrunner   Meg Marinis    




For eleven seasons, there was no Grey&#39;s Anatomy without Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and Derek&#39;s relationship, but for the last few seasons, the show has tried to fill his absence. He dies suddenly in season 11, leaving Meredith and the other doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial devastated, and without a road map for the path forward. Derek was the great love of Meredith&#39;s life and the new love interests that have been introduced since he died don&#39;t come close to living up to his legacy. 
Though the show had already been changing, Derek&#39;s death confirmed just how different the latest era of the series has been and how it doesn&#39;t have the same appeal as the earlier seasons. The show is known for killing off beloved characters without remorse and pivoting the direction of the plot on a dime, but Derek&#39;s loss shook the series to its core. As more of the original cast leaves the show, it&#39;s easy to look back on the early years with nostalgia for how things once were.
