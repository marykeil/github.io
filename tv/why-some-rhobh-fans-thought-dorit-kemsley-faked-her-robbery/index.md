## Literature Review
Dorit Kemsley shared the trauma she suffered after her home invasion, but The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills fans questioned her claims.




After Dorit Kemsley relived her traumatic robbery on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 12, some fans were suspecting the validity of her claims. Dorit made media headlines last October after being robbed at gunpoint inside her Encino, California home. Her husband, Paul &#34;PK&#34; Kemsley, was out of town at the time of the robbery, but Dorit and her children were unharmed during the attack. Filming was underway then, and Dorit&#39;s primary focus on RHOBH season 12 was healing from the traumatizing encounter. As one of the best reality TV shows, it&#39;s no wonder Dorit&#39;s robbery elicited such curiosity.




Throughout RHOBH season 12, some viewers questioned whether Dorit&#39;s home invasion was as authentic as she claims. One episode shared Dorit&#39;s therapy session where she tried to open herself up to put the robbery behind her. During her confessional, Dorit cried while explaining how the trauma was impacting her life. As RHOBH season 13 unfolds, It&#39;s time to revisit Dorit&#39;s bizarre robbery situation.

 The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Fans Questioned Dorit&#39;s Robbery 

 

However, the Twitter account CoRINNA Virus noted how Dorit had &#34;No tears&#34; despite crying on-screen. Others pointed out that no 911 audio was released, typically leaked when a celebrity is a victim of a crime or involved in one. Many accused Dorit of being &#34;scripted&#34; during RHOBH season 12 and seemingly orchestrating her home invasion as a storyline for the show.




Some fans in the comments were convinced that Dorit was on the chopping block after RHOBH season 11 due to not having much of a storyline. Outside of her small quarrel with Garcelle Beauvais, Dorit didn&#39;t have much going on two seasons ago. With Dorit being robbed while the show was in production, the attack became her central focus in RHOBH season 12.



 Dorit&#39;s Home Robbery Was Traumatizing On RHOBH 
          

Dorit was an emotional wreck while recounting the events on the night of the robbery. Her two young kids were asleep in their rooms when two masked robbers broke into her home through the kids&#39; classroom window. Holding RHOBH&#39;s Dorit at gunpoint, the men took everything they could get their hands on before fleeing the scene. One robber was kind enough to leave Dorit&#39;s cell phone by her gate. Dorit recalls pleading for her life and asking the robbers not to hurt her or her children. The ladies have supported Dorit as she works to heal from the traumatic experience.




Since the home invasion was Dorit&#39;s storyline, Andy Cohen threw a few questions at her based on what fans were saying. Andy brought up some of the insensitive claims about her faking the robbery, bringing Dorit to tears. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star appears to have been telling the truth, and accusations that she lied are insensitive.
