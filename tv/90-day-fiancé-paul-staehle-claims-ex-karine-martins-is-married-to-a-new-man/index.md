## Literature Review
Former 90 Day Fiancé star Paul Staehle is making another wild claim about his estranged wife Karine Martins on Instagram amid their custody battle.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Paul Staehle is making a ridiculous claim about his estranged wife Karine Martins that fans find hard to believe. Paul is a 40-year-old man from Kentucky who became a reality TV celeb with his 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days season 1 debut in 2017. Paul had been dating Karine, who was barely 20, after meeting her online. Paul went to Brazil where he asked for her hand in marriage, but not before asking her to take an STD test. It was just one of Paul&#39;s red flags because, as the couple entered marriage and started a life together, Paul and Karine&#39;s trust issues became a major problem.




Paul and Karine lost custody of their sons Pierre and Ethan in 2022 and are currently not together, as per Paul, and he&#39;s now claiming that Karine married another man (as shared by Reddit user u/Low_Departure_5853)


 

The fan noticed that Paul posted an Instagram Story and quickly took a screenshot to share with fellow 90 Day Fiancé viewers. Paul created a text-based Story where he wrote, &#34;Congratulations to Karine and Jonathan M Rueff.&#34; He added, &#34;With your wedding engagement tonight,&#34; using a partying face emoji. &#34;Who is Jonathan Rueff ?&#34; asked Necessary-Hospital96.

 Who Was Karine Dating After Her Split With Paul? 
          

Meanwhile, user carito97 wrote, &#34;He hacked her instagram again and its posting their custody papers and her std tests. Somebody arrest this men. I feel terrible for her,&#34; referring to Karine&#39;s Instagram stories, which featured scanned custody documents of her son Pierre and a positive result for an STD test. Paul has deleted the Story about Karine from his Instagram now. He did not explain who the man he mentioned was. Karine and Paul split in December 2021. It was after a video leaked that showed Karine allegedly physically assaulting Paul. The alleged attack took place in front of their son.

This incident eventually led to Paul and Karine losing custody of both children. It appears that Pierre and Ethan are currently with Paul&#39;s cousin. He was recently accusing the cousin of not allowing him and his family to meet the kids and violating court orders. Karine getting married to someone amid the ongoing messy custody battle sounds absurd. She was last linked to a man named Josh Seiter who is a former The Bachelorette contestant. Josh was previously in a relationship with 90 Day Fiancé alum Yolanda Leak. He had apparently met Karine on social media, and they were together for a month.




Josh had claimed he would help Karine fight the custody battle after Pierre and Ethan were taken into the care of Child Protective Services. Regardless, Josh later moved on and tried flirting with other 90 Day Fiancé cast members such as Rose Vega, Yve Arrelano, and Natalie Mordovtseva. Meanwhile, Paul and Karine, who have been away from the franchise since their last appearance together in 2020, were in the news in September 2023. Paul had been reported missing and probably dead in Brazil by Karine. However, when 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Paul returned he claimed he was never missing and was alive and healthy.
