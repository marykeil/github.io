  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Season 2 of All of Us Are Dead may see the loss of beloved characters like Dae-su and Hyo-ryeong, who have shown resilience and bravery throughout season 1.
Comic relief characters like Jae-ik and Ho-chul may face higher risks of death compared to other characters, as their side plots may not be as essential to the main storyline.
Ha-ri and Mi-jin, who have already experienced loss and have limited connections to the main group, could be potential casualties in season 2 but are unlikely to go down without a fight.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From minor characters to fan-favorite names, no one is safe in the upcoming All of Us Are Dead season 2 after the first season lived up to its title.</p>
<p>All of Us Are Dead season 1 lived up to its title and killed off many characters, which is why not even the show’s protagonists are safe in season 2. Following All of Us Are Dead season 1’s ending and the success of the series, Netflix’s Korean drama about zombies was renewed for a second season. Assuming everyone who is still alive by the end of season 1 will return, audiences will have plenty of characters to be worried about when All of Us Are Dead returns.
The main All of Us Are Dead characters are On-jo, Su-hyeok, Nam-ra, and Cheong-san, the last of whom seemingly died at the end of season 1. Whether Cheong-san is truly dead remains to be seen, but the remaining survivors will face new challenges in season 2. From minor characters to fan-favorite names, all bets are off for who will die in All of Us Are Dead season 2.</p>
<p>9  Yang Dae-su (Im Jae-hyuk)
He never lost hope during season 1</p>
<p>As one of the few All of Us Are Dead characters who kept a positive attitude throughout the entirety of season 1, Dae-su would make for a tragic loss in season 2. The moments in which Dae-su would start to sing amidst the chaos of the zombie apocalypse led to some of the most emotional scenes in season 1, not to mention the times he put his life in danger to help the rest of the group. Dae-su escaped from the quarantine zone with the rest of the survivors, meaning he is willing to risk his life again.</p>
<p>8  Seo Hyo-ryeong (Kim Bo-yoon)
She might want to prove herself to the group</p>
<p>Despite being a shy character who did not participate in the action quite a lot, Hyo-ryong remained strong throughout season 1 and made it to the quarantine zone. She has now joined On-jo and the rest of the group in the search for Nam-ra and, perhaps, for Cheong-san as well. The fact that On-jo specifically asked Hyo-ryeong if she truly wanted to go with them on their adventure outside of the military complex reveals that her friends are worried about her. All of Us Are Dead season 2 may see a “stronger” Hyo-ryeong, and it would be unfortunate if she died trying to prove anything to anyone.</p>
<p>7  Jae-ik (Lee Kyu-hyung)
His side story already ended in season 1</p>
<p>Police officer Song Jae-ik was one of the main characters in All of Us Are Dead season 1, even though he was never at the school and barely interacted with the other protagonists. Jae-ik spent most of the season crossing the city, trying to deliver the laptop with Dr. Lee Byeong-chan’s research while also trying to protect a baby he found along the way. A funny and heroic character, Jae-ik will likely put his life on the line again in season 2. As such, the chances of Jae-ik dying in All of Us Are Dead season 2 are not low, especially if the show introduces new characters.</p>
<p>6  Jeon Ho-chul (Park Jae-chul)
Season 2 might not need comic relief characters</p>
<p>Similar to Jae-ik, police officer Jeon Ho-chul was part of a side plot that barely intersected with the main storyline. Instead, Ho-chul and Jae-ik served as a comic relief duo, with the former’s lack of courage delivering some of the funniest moments on the show. As funny as it was to follow Ho-chul and Jae-ik’s adventure across the city, it would not be surprising if either of them died. Considering Jae-ik is more experienced and seems to be ready to face anything, the chances of Ho-chul dying are significantly bigger compared to Jae-ik’s. Hopefully, the duo will still be together in All of Us Are Dead season 2.</p>

10 Biggest All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Theories
From Cheong-san’s return to Nam-ra leading the halfbies, the biggest theories for All of Us Are Dead season 2 try to make sense of season 1’s finale.</p>
<p>5  Jang Ha-ri (Ha Seung-lee)
She has already lost her brother</p>
<p>After losing her younger brother at the end of season 1, Ha-ri may have nothing to fight for in season 2, which is worrying for the character’s future. Whereas most of the Hyosan High characters are all friends with each other, Ha-ri’s only connection to the main cast is through her brother, Seung-ri, who died protecting her. Although Ha-ri is still with the rest of the group by the end of season 1, it would arguably be easier for the show to write off her character compared to other names. That said, Ha-ri is a great fighter, and she would not go without a fight.</p>
<p>4  Park Mi-jin (Lee Eun-saem)
She doesn’t have many friends left</p>
<p>Despite only interacting with the rest of the lead characters at the end of season 1, Mi-jin was a scene stealer in All of Us Are Dead. With a strong attitude and an even stronger will to survive, Mi-ji went through a lot in season 1, including the loss of a friend. She is now part of the main group, which also includes Ha-ri, meaning their fates might be intertwined. Mi-jin has a crush on Ha-ri, and All of Us Are Dead season 2&rsquo;s story could go for a tragic outcome if either of them dies. Still, similar to Ha-ri, Mi-jin would not be killed by zombies without a fight.</p>
<p>3  Choi Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun)
Nam-ra sacrificing herself for others would make sense</p>
<p>As one of the show’s protagonists, All of Us Are Dead’s Nam-ra may not be the most likely option when it comes to characters who might die in season 2. However, given how disconnected from the rest of the group Nam-ra’s journey has been, she could meet her end before the other characters. Nam-ra’s story in season 1 was about her opening herself to others, going from someone without friends to a true “class president.” She is now on a mission to protect other hambies, many of which are being hunted by the military. As such, Nam-ra sacrificing herself to save others would make a lot of sense story-wise.</p>
<p>2  Lee Su-hyeok (Lomon)
Su-hyeok is always putting himself in danger</p>
<p>Whereas some All of Us Are Dead characters could be in trouble due to their lack of survival skills, what puts Su-hyeok in danger is his bravery. Few were the moments in which Su-hyeok ran away or hid from the zombies in season 1. Instead, whenever possible or necessary, Su-hyeok fought the zombies, sometimes with his bare hands. Assuming Su-hyeok will continue to put himself in danger to protect his friends, especially Nam-ra, he might die a heroic death in All of Us Are Dead season 2. Su-hyeok is one of the show’s leads, but his “plot armor” may not last forever.</p>
<p>1  Nam On-jo (Park Ji-hu)
It would be a very shocking death</p>
<p>On-jo dying in All Of Us Are Dead season 2 seems very unlikely, which is why it could happen if the show wants to shock audiences. It is unclear whether All of Us Are Dead season 3 will happen, but if so, killing off On-jo at the end of the second season would change the series completely and would raise the stakes for the next chapter of the story. On-jo’s death being a fake-out in the style of what might have happened to Cheong-san can also not be ruled out, although that would be a little repetitive. Hopefully, On-jo and Cheong-san can reunite before things get complicated again.</p>
