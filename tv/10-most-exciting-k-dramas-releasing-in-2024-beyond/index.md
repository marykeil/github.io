 Exciting K-dramas coming in 2024 and beyond, including webtoon adaptations and prestige series across genres. 
 Streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney&#43; have highly anticipated titles, such as A Shop For Killers and The Bequeathed. 
 Second seasons of popular shows like All of Us Are Dead and Squid Game are also expected in 2024. 


The most exciting K-dramas releasing in 2024 and beyond include webtoon adaptations, prestige web series that are perfect to binge, and weekly releases from across all genres. The list of best K-dramas of all time reveals just how plural Korean TV shows can be, ranging from romantic comedies to action-packed thrillers. 2023 was a great year for K-dramas, starting with surprising hits like The Glory and ending with the return of Sweet Home.
2024 has already seen a couple of great Korean shows streaming in the US, including the second part of Gyeongseong Creature. Netflix’s Korean shows represent a significant portion of the best K-dramas currently available to stream, but other platforms like Disney&#43; also have highly anticipated titles coming up. The best K-dramas premiering in 2024 and 2025 include brand-new shows but also second or third seasons of established hits.









 








 10  A Shop For Killers (January 17, Disney&#43;) 
Starring Kim Hye-jun and Lee Dong-wook Kim Hye-jun, known for her role as Queen Consort Cho in Kingdom, stars as Jung Ji-an in the upcoming A Shop For Killers. The series, which will stream on Disney&#43; in the US, will uncover a sinister mystery tied to a shop that hides many secrets. Kim Hye-jun’s character has a tragic past – her father killed her mother and then himself, leaving her to be raised by her uncle. Lee Dong-wook’s character, the owner of a local shop, took care of Ji-an but mysteriously died too. Several years after she first moved into his house, Ji-an will realize her uncle was not what he seemed like. 






 9  The Bequeathed (January 19, Netflix) 
Starring Kim Hyun-joo, Park Hee-soon, Park Byung-eun and Ryu Kyung-soo
        

After kicking off 2024 with the second part of the period piece monster story Gyeongseong Creature, Netflix’s next big K-drama release is a psychological thriller. The Bequeathed will see Kim Hyun-joo’s character uncover a convoluted threat of lies and deceptions following the death of an uncle she did not know about. The series will join the list of Netflix K-dramas based on webtoons, many of which are among the platform’s most successful titles. The Bequeathed has so far been described as a mini-series, with all six episodes dropping on January 19, 2024.







 8  Doctor Slump (January 27, Netflix) 
Starring Park Shin-hye and Park Hyung-sik
        

Enemies to lovers might be one of the most popular tropes in romantic K-dramas and romantic comedies in general, and the upcoming Doctor Slump is set to deliver a great rendition of it. Park Shin-hye and Park Hyung’s characters didn’t like each other during high school, or at least that’s what they told themselves. However, thanks to fate, they have found each other again. Both Ha-neul and Jeong-woo are now doctors, and what was once a rivalry between two students could now be the beginning of an entirely new dynamic. Doctor Slump will release episodes weekly on Netflix.







 7  A Killer Paradox (February 9, Netflix) 
Starring Choi Woo-shik, Lee Hee-joon, and Son Suk-ku
        

Those looking for an action-packed thriller that will also include a lot of laughs can make sure to check out A Killer Paradox, an upcoming K-drama set to release on Netflix in 2024. Choi Woo-shik’s character, a college student named Lee Tang, discovers he has an unusual superpower after accidentally killing a serial killer – he can tell whenever someone is evil or has done terrible things. This will prompt Lee Tang to become some sort of vigilante who will use his powers to track down criminals. However, the police, including a famous detective, will try to stop him in this series based on a webtoon.







 6  All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 (TBA, Netflix) 
Starring: Yoon Chan-young, Cho Yi-hyun, Park Ji-hu, and Lomon


 







One of Netflix’s most successful Korean shows, All of Us Are Dead season 1 took the zombie genre by storm with a captivating story set almost entirely in one location. Although the destruction of the school and the apparent death of Cheong-san would have made for a solid ending, All of Us Are Dead season 2 is happening. The series was renewed for a second season not too long after the first one premiered in January 2021. However, All of Us Are Dead season 2’s release date has yet to be announced. Despite Cheong-san’s death, Yoon Chan-young was part of the season 2 announcement.


Cho Yi-hyun, Park Ji-hu, and Lomon are also set to reprise their roles as Nam-ra, On-jo, and Su-hyeok, respectively. There are dozens of All of Us Are Dead season 2 theories, which show how anticipated the series’ next chapter already is. Considering most of the city and the school were destroyed by the end of season 1, it will be interesting to see how All of Us Are Dead 2 will work in terms of tone and pacing. Although not much is known about season 2’s story, the show is expected to be quite different from season 1 now that the school is no more.





 5  Sweet Home Season 3 (2024, Netflix) 
Starring Song Kang, Go Min-si, Lee Do-hyun, and Lee Jin-wook


 







It took three years for Sweet Home season 2 to be released. Fortunately, those who became fans of Hyun-su and the rest of the Sweet Home characters will not have to wait nearly as long for season 3, as the monster drama will return in 2024. Netflix renewed Sweet Home for two seasons following the success of the show’s debut, which is why the window between seasons 2 and 3 will be much shorter than the wait between the first and second seasons. Sweet Home season 2’s ending featured many cliffhangers, including but not limited to the return of Eun-hyuk as a monster.





 4  Squid Game Season 2 (TBA, Netflix) 
Starring Lee Jung-jae, Wi Ha-jun, Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo, Park Gyu-young, and Lee Jin-uk


 







A pop culture juggernaut, Squid Game was a massive success for Netflix and arguably played a role in the rising number of Korean shows on American streaming platforms. Even though Sweet Home would have worked perfectly as a standalone series, the show was unsurprisingly renewed for season 2. However, although Lee Jung-jae is returning as Gi-hun for Squid Game season 2, the show is set to be very different from the first season. The surprise element of Squid Game’s first games cannot be replicated, as audiences already know what to expect. This creates a tricky challenge for Netflix’s most successful K-drama.





 3  The Trunk (2024, Netflix) 
Starring Gong Yoo and Seo Hyun-jin
        

Netflix’s The Trunk is among the platform’s most promising upcoming K-dramas. The series, which will see a series of strange encounters tied to the discovery of an old trunk that washed ashore on a lake, is described as a mystery but is expected to include elements of comedy. This is because Gong Yoo, known for his roles in Squid Game, The Silent Sea, and Train For Busan, will play a character whose covert marriage will be arranged by his actual ex-wife, Seo-yeon. She will be played by Seo Hyun-jin, known for her roles in Another Miss Oh, Dr. Romantic, The Beauty Inside, and You Are My Spring.





 2  Ask The Stars (2024, TBA) 
Starring Lee Min-ho and Gong Hyo-jin
        

Love at first sight K-dramas tend to be great, which seems to be what Ask the Stars will deliver. The show, which will air on tvN but does not have a confirmed streaming home in the US yet, will tell the story of an astronaut and a tourist who fall in love on a space station. Even though there have been dozens of movies and TV shows set in space in recent years, a K-drama love story that takes place in a space station sounds very intriguing. Ask the Stars features Lee Min-ho, most know for Boys Over Flowers, and Gong Hyo-jin, from Jeaoulsy Incarnate and Sang Doo!





 1  Everything Will Come True (2024, TBA) 
Starring Kim Woo-bin and Suzy
        

There have been a few K-dramas about falling in love with a demon or with Death itself, including 2023’s My Demon starring Song Kang. Everything Will Come True, however, is doing something unique – a potential love story between a human woman and a genie. Suzy’s character, Ga-young, liberates a genie and is granted three wishes. However, the genie, played by Kim Woo-bin, has a personality of their own and will interact with Ga-young. Everything Will Come True, which doesn’t have an official American streaming home yet, will be the second time Kim Woo-bin and Suzy star together in a K-drama – they first worked together in Uncontrollably Bond.
