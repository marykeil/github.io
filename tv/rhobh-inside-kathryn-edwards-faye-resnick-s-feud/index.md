## Literature Review
Kathryn Edwards and Faye Resnick had an odd feud during The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 6. The feud goes way back to the early 90s. 




During The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 6, Kathryn Edwards went after Faye Resnick years after Faye wrote something salacious about Kathryn in her book from the early 90s. Before Kathryn joined the Bravo series, Faye had made several appearances on RHOBH alongside her good friend, Kyle Richards. Faye was a friend of during RHOBH season 3 and continued to make the odd guest appearance in later seasons. As RHOBH season 13 continues to unfold, it&#39;s time to revisit Faye and Kathryn&#39;s feud.




Kathryn came onto RHOBH season 6 halfway through the season alongside Erika Jayne. During the season, Kathryn revealed she was married to former NFL player Marcus Allen, who was good friends with O.J. Simpson. She admitted that the two split up many years after O.J.&#39;s alleged murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. Shortly after her divorce from Marcus, Kathryn married her now-husband, former footballer Donnie Edwards, who appeared alongside her on RHOBH. While Kathryn&#39;s background was interesting enough, her feud with Faye is what got fans talking.


 Kathryn And Faye&#39;s Feud On RHOBH Explained 
          

After meeting Kathryn for the first time, Kyle asked her if she knew her friend Faye. While Kathryn knew of her, she wasn&#39;t acquaintances with her. Nonetheless, Kathryn did have some beef with Faye. In 1994, Faye wrote Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted, which focused on what Nicole dealt with during her marriage to O.J.




However, in the book, Faye also took a jab at Kathryn, who was still mad over 20 years later. Faye revealed that Marcus had an affair with Nicole while he was engaged to Kathryn. She also said that Kathryn was the type to turn &#34;a blind eye to his fooling around,&#34; which angered Kathryn the most, according to BravoTV.

Even though more than twenty years had passed since the book was released, Kathryn was still upset about what Faye had written. During a dinner at Kyle&#39;s former Bel-Air mansion, Kathryn confronted Faye about what she had written about her many years ago. The former RHOBH star explained that what Faye said was false and hurt her feelings.

Faye wanted nothing to do with the conversation and did her best to keep her interaction with her short. Kyle even jumped in a few times to defend Faye, explaining that she is a good mother and has dramatically changed since the early 90s. While nothing between Kathryn and Faye was resolved, the issues weren&#39;t mentioned again.




However, it was brought up during the RHOBH season 6 reunion, and Kathryn admitted that she was hurt by Kyle, who diminished Kathryn&#39;s feelings towards the situation. While it is unclear if Kathryn and Faye made amends, it is clear they were never going to be friends. Faye never truly apologized, and Kathryn still held a grudge. However, with Kathryn exiting RHOBH after one season, she and Faye will never resolve their issues.



The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST.
