## Literature Review
One Piece has two new theme songs for the Egghead Island arc, and they both do an incredible job of paying tribute to the anime&#39;s legacy.




One Piece’s anime has recently started its adaptation of the Egghead Island arc, and with that has come a new opening and ending theme for the anime. Hiroshi Kitadani and Maki Otsuki, who sang the original theme songs for the anime, return to sing “UUUUUS!” and “Dear sunrise”, respectively, and that meta-level callback is perfectly fitting for the beginning of One Piece’s final saga.




One Piece’s new theme songs are a perfect way of kicking off the final saga, and the accompanying visuals sell that point even further. As a commemoration of how far the series has come, One Piece’s new opening and ending themes each work to call back to previous story arcs, with “UUUUUS!” having the Straw Hats go through all the different outfits they’ve worn in the series and “Dear sunrise” having a montage of some of the biggest moments for each character.


 

Those sorts of visuals go beyond simple fanservice, and they play a big part in making the new themes two of the best in the anime&#39;s long history


 One Piece’s New Opening &amp; Ending Highlight The Straw Hats’ Bond 

 




The callbacks in One Piece’s new opening are clearly seen in every outfit the characters have worn in chronological order, but there’s more to think about with the ending theme. One Piece’s new ending theme, “Dear sunrise”, is not just that a montage of big moments for the Straw Hat Pirates. The ending shows everyone’s first meetings with Luffy, their joining the crew, and the moment when each of them made it clear that they were fully committed to the crew. This does a great job of highlighting how much the Straw Hats&#39; relationships have grown over the years, and it’s a perfect thing to include in the final saga.

That sort of framing of the Straw Hat Pirates’ history is, naturally, also present in Luffy’s section. When “Dear sunrise” focuses on Luffy, it shows not only Luffy regaining his resolve after Ace’s death, but Luffy preparing to head to Sabaody Archipelago after the timeskip and telling the rest of the crew his dream, all of which are key moments of Luffy solidifying his commitment to the crew, as well. The ending calls attention to how even Luffy has had to grow as both an individual and in his relationships with others, and having a reminder of that is more than fitting for the final saga.




                  One Piece&#39;s Newest Arc Gets Surprise Streaming Announcement From Netflix   Netflix has been doing a lot with One Piece in the past few years, and a recent announcement is taking their involvement further than ever.    



 One Piece’s New Theme Songs Are The Anime’s Best Ones Yet 
          

One Piece’s new opening and ending tie excellently into the series’ nostalgia, and that&#39;s a big factor in why they’re so great. Both new themes feature some of the liveliest and most creative art and animation of any One Piece theme, especially “UUUUUS!”, and that level of charm is perfectly fitting for the themes that are meant to kick off One Piece’s final saga. The fact that the new opening and ending take the time to harken back to everything One Piece has done for almost 30 years elevates that charm even higher, and there’s no better way for the series to celebrate reaching such an important point in its story.
