# The Act 5 Things They Changed From The True Story (&amp; 5 They Kept The Same)


## SUMMARY 


 The Act accurately portrays the video recording of Gypsy Rose and her boyfriend after the murder, as Gypsy herself has confirmed its authenticity. 
 The Cinderella story scene in the theater, including sneaking off to have sex, is based on real events and was part of Gypsy and Nick&#39;s plan. 
 Gypsy&#39;s boyfriend, Nick, did have dissociative identity disorder in real life, and the show kept many details of his character, such as his diet, consistent with reality.
