## Literature Review
Mary Demasu-ay from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 hits back at critics who questioned her choice to show off her baby girl on social media.




Mary Demasu-ay from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way called out fans for criticizing her parenting skills. During her reality TV journey, the 23-year-old mom got pregnant with her beau, Brandan DeNuccio. While she had many unresolved problems with the man, she eventually married him and seemed eager to welcome her baby and start her new life. Mary and Brandan had their daughter in August 2023 and took to social media to share the big news. During The Other Way season 5 Tell-All, they revealed that they had named her Midnight and began posting content with her on various social media platforms.




Unfortunately, not everyone liked Brandan and Mary’s open approach to parenting. Some took to social media to criticize the couple for oversharing content of their daughter. Recently, Mary used her Instagram Stories to send a message to her critics around the globe. She shared the profile of one of her critics and said, “You suck.” Mary wrote, “He’s telling people we are exposing our child on social media.” The new mom claimed that she and Brandan are proud parents and will continue to share any pictures and videos they want. She accused the critic of “making money” by exploiting her family.


 Mary &amp; Brandan&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Mary and Brandan had a strange relationship that raised many eyebrows. Initially, they seemed incompatible and immature because they never gave each other space. The couple spent day and night connected on a video call, being insecure and not trusting each other. When Brandan flew to the Philippines to marry Mary with a few dollars in his pocket, he made it clear that he wasn’t yet ready to start a family. Despite that, Mary somehow accepted him with all his flaws and became pregnant, despite knowing that her family members wanted them to tie the knot first.





 

Brandan and Mary have come under fire for their on-screen personalities. The couple argues about the most benign things and is toxic toward each other. From Mary wanting Brandan to not look at any woman to the American man questioning his wife about her friends, the two showed they didn’t have faith in each other. To make matters worse, they got pregnant without a decent career, which was another sign that hinted they lacked real-life experiences. Mary and Brandan are disliked because they continue leading their unhealthy romance and have unexpectedly brought a baby girl into this world.

Still, it’s Brandan and Mary’s life. The two are happy about their daughter and want to post about her on social media. Therefore, they should share whatever they want; social media users can be judgmental and aggressive for no reason. In 2022, Loren Brovarnik got identical criticism after becoming a mom of three under 3. Similarly, Emily Bieberly also received criticism for breastfeeding her son. Mary is a new mom and will be the target of critics. However, the 90 Day Fiancé star should probably focus on her supporters and ignore the critics.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
