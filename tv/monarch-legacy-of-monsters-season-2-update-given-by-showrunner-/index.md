Summary

  Monarch: Legacy of Monsters showrunner Chris Black remains optimistic about the possibility of a season 2.   The show has been successful so far, raising hopes for its renewal.   Black believes there is still more story to tell, adding to the ongoing Monsterverse.  







Monarch: Legacy of Monsters showrunner Chris Black offers an update on if the ongoing Monsterverse series will be returning for season 2. The show focuses on a story told in the 1950s and the 2010s, unraveling a family mystery behind the origins of Monarch. The series has one episode left, with the latest entry teasing major story revelations and developments to come.

Speaking with TVLine, Black offered an optimistic update about Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2. While the series has yet to be officially renewed, the showrunner teases the story could continue beyond its first batch of episodes. Check out what Black had to say below:


We do not have a Season 2 order. This show has done very well, so we’re optimistic and excited. We feel we have more story to tell.



 Will Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Return For Season 2? 
          




Black’s update indicates Monarch could come back for season 2, further exploring the mysteries set up so far. Episode 9 featured a shocking Lee Shaw twist, revealing his journey to the Hollow Earth sent him forward in time 20 years. The newest episode also ended by revealing Keiko Randa is still alive, having barely aged since her supposed death in 1959.

Now that the series is starting to answer key questions, it seems the upcoming finale will be focused on wrapping up the show’s major events. If that’s the case, then it’s unclear where season 2 could go and what the major conflict could be. Depending on how much time passes on Earth while Cate, May, Lee, and Keiko are trapped in the Hollow Earth, the final episode could deliver a major twist, with the characters displaced in a new time period.

Monarch: Legacy of Monster’s Hollow Earth reveals could also be setting the stage for the Monsterverse’s next big release, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. This means time travel through the underground dimension could become relevant to the wider franchise, perhaps explaining ideas like Godzilla’s longevity. With one episode left, there’s no telling how the show’s heroes will return to Earth - and what will be waiting for them upon their arrival.






Monarch: Legacy of Monsters’ season finale arrives on Apple TV&#43; Friday, January 12.
