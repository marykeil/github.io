## Literature Review
Amazon Prime Video is one of the fastest-growing streaming services in the market, offering incredible original shows such as The Boys and Fleabag.

There are many examples of both original Amazon Prime Video content and existing material available on the service that has become regarded as among the best television to be found anywhere. Whether viewers are interested in sidesplitting comedy, thought-provoking sci-fi, or gripping drama, the 30 best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video tick every box.

 Best Comedy TV Shows On Amazon Prime Video 
Fleabag (2016-2019)


 







 Fleabag 

 Release Date   June 21, 2016    Cast   Phoebe Waller-Bridge , Sian Clifford , Andrew Scott , Brett Gelman    Seasons   2    Writers   Phoebe Waller-Bridge    




Based on writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge&#39;s acclaimed one-woman play of the same name, Fleabag became a viral sensation on release – and understandably so. A bitingly satirical comedy that isn&#39;t afraid to showcase raw emotion, Fleabag never shies away from tackling complicated, often dark subjects. While the first season deals with the fallout following the main character&#39;s friend&#39;s suicide, the second offers a compelling meditation on religion and family. With its deliberately ambiguous and nuanced symbolism, Fleabag is a joy to decipher and rewards repeat viewing.

 Following her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt&#39;s Creek, Annie Murphy starred in a much darker comedy with Kevin Can F**k Himself. The show delivers a clever satire of the tired housewife role seen in many multi-cam sitcoms, with Murphy playing a subversive version of the character who decides to fight back against her constrained life and her slob husband. Murphy shows a new side of her talents, mixing comedy with authentic intensity in a fascinating genre-bending series.

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (2017-2023)


 







 The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel 

 Release Date   March 17, 2017    Cast   Rachel Brosnahan , Kevin Pollak , Caroline Aaron , Jane Lynch , Marin Hinkle , Michael Zegen , Tony Shalhoub , Alex Borstein    Seasons   5    




 Loosely inspired by the life of Joan Rivers, Prime Video&#39;s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is a pleasant comedy-drama set in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s. Rachel Brosnahan plays the titular Miriam Maisel, a homemaker who discovers a talent for stand-up comedy after her husband unexpectedly leaves her.
The show&#39;s stand-up scenes are consistently hilarious, yet Miriam&#39;s personal struggles give the show a grounded realism that&#39;s often incredibly emotional. Inspiring and uplifting, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel has been a roaring success for Amazon Prime Video and ranks as one of the best TV shows on the platform.

 Transparent 

 Release Date   February 6, 2014    Cast   Jeffrey Tambor , Gaby Hoffmann , Jay Duplass , Amy Landecker , Judith Light , Kathryn Hahn    Seasons   5    




 Transparent is a funny and relatable portrayal of a dysfunctional family in changing times, as its characters seem to be too absorbed in their own worlds to realize one of them is ready to embrace her true gender identity. One of Amazon Prime Video&#39;s early TV show success stories, Transparent discussed important topics in a hilarious tone, realistically portraying what ignorance feels like inside a family home. Acclaimed throughout its run, Transparent still ranks among the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.

Minx (2022-)
        

 Minx 

 Release Date   March 17, 2022    Cast   Jake Johnson , Ophelia Lovibond , Michael Angarano , Jessica Lowe , Oscar Montoya , Lennon Parham , Idara Victor    Seasons   2    Writers   Ellen Rapoport    




 Raucous and hilarious in equal measure, Minx takes a sly look at the little-covered world of 70s erotic publishing. Joyce Prigger (Lovibond) is a young feminist in Los Angeles, who teams up with a salacious publisher (Johnson) in order to pioneer the first erotic magazine for women. Although the central story is certainly unique, Minx&#39;s real strength lies in the chemistry between its cast, especially Lovibond and Johnson. Its impressive Rotten Tomatoes scores ensure it easily ranks among the best comedy TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.

Mixing clever elements of Norse mythology and a character-driven story filled with bloody battles and political intrigue, Vikings is the perfect period show for those who like their drama enhanced by action.

 Release Date   June 17, 2022    Cast   Lola Tung , Christopher Briney , Gavin Casalegno , Jackie Chung    Seasons   2    




 Based on the book trilogy written by celebrated author Jenny Han, the Amazon Prime Video show The Summer I Turned Pretty is a sentimental story about first love and first heartbreak. Just like the title suggests, the show conveys a precious summer feeling as the teenage protagonist, Belly, finds herself in an unusual love triangle with two brothers. While many of its beats might come across as clichéd, the show&#39;s earnest emotion won over fans of the original books, as well as newcomers.

 One of the more recent dramas on Amazon Prime Video, Daisy Jones and the Six quickly earned a reputation as one of the best. Based on the eponymous novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid, the miniseries is an account of a fictional rock group that found fame and was torn apart by drama within. Just as the relationships and character arcs are compelling, Daisy Jones &amp; the Six offers some truly great music, providing an authentic and thrilling look inside the world of a rock band.

 With a razor-sharp script and high-stakes legal drama, Suits ranks as one of the best procedural shows that doesn&#39;t involve cops. It portrays the chaotic daily life of two brilliant lawyers: Harvey Specter, whose reputation makes him one of the best professionals in his area, and Mike Ross, a precocious college dropout who joins Harvey&#39;s team with a fraudulent Harvard degree. Among its great performances, viewers can also catch a glimpse of Meghan Markle&#39;s best character before she joined Britain&#39;s royal family, adding to the intrigue.

Downton Abbey (2010-2015)


 







 Downton Abbey 

 Release Date   September 13, 2019    Cast   Hugh Bonneville , Elizabeth McGovern , Michelle Dockery , Brendan Coyle    Seasons   6    Creator   Julian Fellowes    




 While the inner workings of an English estate in the early 1900s might sound like dry material, Downton Abbey managed to turn it into one of the most popular and riveting shows on television. The series follows the lives of a family of British aristocrats and the servants who work for them. The upstairs-downstairs narrative encompasses love, drama, and scandal, all while providing a cutting social commentary. Downton Abbey boasts an impressive ensemble cast, and its success led to two spinoff movies.

 The Affair 

 Release Date   October 12, 2014    Cast   Dominic West , Ruth Wilson , Maura Tierney , Joshua Jackson , Julia Goldani Telles , Josh Stamberg , Catalina Sandino Moreno , Omar Metwally , Irène Jacob , Sanaa Lathan , Anna Paquin    Genres   Drama    Seasons   5    




 Perception is everything in The Affair, a five-season twisty drama that kicks off when author Noah Solloway (Dominic West) and waitress Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson) cheat on their respective spouses, Helen Butler (Maura Tierney) and Cole Lockhart (Joshua Jackson) with each other, and their illicit relationship has a host of tumultuous consequences. What sets The Affair apart from other infidelity dramas is its dramatic device of showing the same event through two characters&#39; perspectives. The show is an intense study of memory&#39;s relationship to fact, and it&#39;s anchored by the four tour de force performances of the show&#39;s leads.

A complex parable on vigilantism and the death penalty, The Killing Vote is a critically acclaimed South Korean drama in the same mold as shows like Squid Game. Centering on a mysterious masked individual known only as Gaetal, the show imagines a society in which Gaetal is able to hold public votes on whether criminals should be put to death, murdering them if enough people agree. The show is a nuanced exploration of what it really means to deliver justice told in such a way that asks genuinely difficult questions of both the characters and the audience.

Scanlan , Sope Dirisu , Mark Lewis Jones , Asif Raza Mir , Michelle Fairley , Narges Rashidi , Jude Akuwudike    Seasons   2    Writers   Gareth Evans    




 Building on the success of British gangster shows like Peaky Blinders, Gangs of London is a blood-soaked epic centered on the criminal underworld. The series follows a family who loses their patriarch to a shocking murder and find themselves surrounded by enemies as his son seeks to take over the empire. The show is an intense crime story but the spectacular and brutal action – from fights to extended shootouts – make it unlike anything on television.

Bosch (2014-2021)


 







 Bosch 

 Release Date   February 6, 2014    Cast   Titus Welliver , Jamie Hector , Amy Aquino , Lance Reddick , Madison Lintz , Troy Evans , DaJuan Johnson , Mimi Rogers    Seasons   7    Story By   Eric Ellis Overmyer    




 In many ways, Bosch&#39;s hard-boiled detective feels like a relic of a bygone TV era, yet the show never fails to make the character less than compelling. Titus Welliver plays Harry Bosch, a Los Angeles police detective who works his cases with total commitment but sometimes plays by his own rules. The premise might sound derivative, but Bosch exhibits a style and storytelling skill that elevates it above lesser examples of the genre. The sequel series, Bosch: Legacy, is also available on Prime Video.

 A twisted YA thriller that only becomes more elaborate as the series unfurls, Harlan Coben&#39;s Shelter is a worthy adaptation of the celebrated author&#39;s best-selling series. Following a group of friends who try to uncover the mystery behind the school peer&#39;s disappearance, the show soon makes it clear that there&#39;s more than one mystery at stake. Intricately layering and connecting storylines while maintaining a tone not dissimilar to Andrés Muschietti&#39;s IT, Harlan Coben&#39;s Shelter is a gripping addition to the best thriller series on Amazon Prime Video.

Amidst this backdrop, protagonist Elliot struggles to reconcile what&#39;s real and what&#39;s just in his head. The show is famous for its razor-sharp storytelling, spinning a narrative where no one can be trusted and everyone is under surveillance. Rami Malek&#39;s breakthrough performance is also mesmerizing in this paranoid, ground-breaking series.

 the night manager 

 Release Date   February 21, 2016    Cast   Tom Hiddleston , Hugh Laurie , Elizabeth Debicki , Olivia Colman    Seasons   1    




 Adapting a novel by spy thriller legend John le Carre, The Night Manager is an intense and exhilarating miniseries. Tom Hiddleston stars as the titular night manager at a hotel in Cairo who accepts a mission to infiltrate the inner circle of a dangerous arms dealer (Hugh Laurie). The taut narrative proves a great showcase for Hiddleston, though it&#39;s Laurie who steals the show with a rare villainous turn.

 Set in an alternate reality, The Man in the High Castle imagines what America would be like had Germany and Japan had won World War II. The series follows a group of rebel heroes seeking to overthrow the oppressive regime in a gripping example of great &#34;what if?&#34; storytelling.

 Though Tom Cruise brought Jack Reacher to the big screen, many fans of the books by Lee Child prefer the more book-accurate take on the character in Reacher. Alan Ritchson plays the titular hobo, a former military police officer who gets wrapped up in a conspiracy in a small town. The action thriller was a big hit for the service thanks to its seemingly unstoppable and charismatic hero, establishing itself as one of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.

 The Outer Limits 

 Release Date   March 26, 1995    Cast   Kevin Conway , Alex Diakun    Seasons   7    




 A revival of the original 1960s sci-fi series, The Outer Limits is a classic of &#39;90s cult TV. Unlike other similar anthology series that are entirely their own stories, The Outer Limits would feature several continuous story arcs that were tied together in the season finales. Though it&#39;s often compared to The Twilight Zone, that series leans more into the fantasy whereas The Outer Limits focuses more on sci-fi, and science and technology&#39;s effects on society. The Outer Limits is a prototype for shows like Black Mirror but with plenty of &#39;90s flare.

 Release Date   March 26, 2021    Cast   Mark Hamill , Gillian Jacobs , Jon Hamm , Mae Whitman , Steven Yeun , Walton Goggins , Ezra Miller , Jonathan Groff , Sandra Oh , Djimon Hounsou , Khary Payton , Seth Rogen , Jeffrey Donovan , Sonequa Martin-Green , Mahershala Ali , Malese Jow , J. K. Simmons , Clancy Brown , Zazie Beetz , Zachary Quinto , Jason Mantzoukas , Nicole Byer    Seasons   1    




 An animated superhero series that doesn&#39;t pull its punches, Invincible is as gnarly and blood-soaked as any live-action alternative. The story revolves around a young hero who tries to follow in the steps of his father, the world&#39;s most powerful superhero, unaware that he&#39;s in fact a heartless mass murderer. Despite the changes Invincible season 1 makes from the comics, few stories in the genre tackle the possibility of mass destruction that every superhero brings along with them this well. The result is an exceptional animated Amazon Prime Video show with unforgettable combat scenes that frequently push boundaries of violence and taste.

The Boys (2019-present)


 







 The Boys 

 Release Date   July 26, 2019    Cast   Elisabeth Shue , Jensen Ackles , Goran Visnjic , Jessie T.

A biting satire on the modern obsession with superheroes, The Boys is a blisteringly brutal indictment of modern consumerism. Set in a world in which heroes not only exist but are frequently corrupt and actively evil, The Boys subverts hopeful genre properties such as the MCU. Following a group of vigilantes who intend to reveal the truth about superheroes that recklessly abuse their power, The Boys is one of the most popular shows on Amazon Prime Video and is a refreshing antidote to omnipresent comic book blockbusters. Spin-off Gen V is also available on Amazon Prime Video, and The Boys season 4 will be arriving on the platform eventually too.

 Good Omens 

 Release Date   May 31, 2019    Cast   Frances McDormand , Sam Taylor Buck , Benedict Cumberbatch , Michael Sheen , Ilan Galkoff , David Tennant , Brian Cox , Adria Arjona    Seasons   2    Writers   Neil Gaiman , Terry Pratchett    




 Perfectly augmented by Michael Sheen and David Tennant&#39;s inimitable onscreen chemistry, Good Omens is a hugely successful adaptation of the Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett novel of the same name. Following an angel and a demon as they enjoy a relatively peaceful existence on Earth, the show slyly rewrites biblical history, introducing a rich new mythology to established stories.
The first season sees the pair attempt to thwart the apocalypse in order to preserve their comfortable lives, while season 2 continues the story post-COVID-19 lockdown. Hugely entertaining and extremely watchable, Good Omens is a triumph for Amazon Prime Video&#39;s original programming.

An ambitious blend of world-building and spectacle, The Wheel of Time is a largely successful attempt to wrestle with Robert Jordan&#39;s sprawling and unwieldy source material. Following the journey of the &#34;chosen one,&#34; whose power can turn the whole kingdom against him and his friends, Amazon Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time explores an inventive magic system and a fantastical setting. Given its intricate plot, the series is remarkably accessible and certainly counts as one of Amazon Prime Video&#39;s best fantasy TV shows.

 The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

 The success of the Lord of the Rings books and movie trilogy was enough to ensure that The Rings of Power found an audience, but few believed Amazon&#39;s billion-dollar production could re-imagine J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s world in such an evocative way. Middle-earth looks visually stunning, and the show takes its time to introduce different cultures, creatures, and of course, enemies, that put at stake the balance between good and evil. The Rings of Power takes place thousands of years before the events of Lord of the Rings, making it a great precursor to the original films.

Neil Gaiman is behind many excellent fantasy adaptations, including Coraline, Good Omens, The Sandman, and the Starz Original American Gods continues that trend. Starring Ian McShane and Ricky Whittle, American Gods is another ambitious project based on the author&#39;s works, creating a mythology of its own by introducing actual gods who must adapt to the modern world through the eyes of Shadow, an ex-convict. A blend of centuries-old legend and modern storytelling, the series is a riveting and inventive drama.

 The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon 

 Release Date   October 1, 2023    Cast   Norman Reedus , Clemence Poesy , Adam Nagaitis , Eriq Ebouaney , Anne Charrier    Seasons   1    




 The Walking Dead franchise isn&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon, and with great spinoffs like The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, that&#39;s a good thing. The series sees the titular fan-favorite character wash ashore in France without a clue as to how he got there. From there, Daryl tries to make his way back home to America, and his journey is unsurprisingly fraught with danger. While Reedus is as reliably fantastic as ever, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon breathes new life into the franchise by setting it in an entirely new location.

 One of the most influential shows of the past 15 years, American Horror Story is a must-watch for every horror fan. The show follows an anthological style, and each season focuses on a different threat and introduces a new set of characters. New roles are often filled by the same group of actors from season to season, as the series explores a wide range of horror tropes such as haunted houses, aliens, and freak shows. Catapulting stars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters to international fame, the show also established Ryan Murphy as the doyen of pop television.

 Interview With the Vampire 

 Release Date   October 2, 2022    Cast   Jacob Anderson , Sam Reid , Eric Bogosian , Bailey Bass    Seasons   2    




 Anne Rice&#39;s book Interview with the Vampire has now inspired two great adaptations: the 1994 movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and the subsequent Amazon Prime Video horror TV show. Once again, the gothic horror series follows Louis de Pointe du Lac as he recounts the story of his life as a noble vampire and the burden of immortality. Both adaptations capture the sensual nature of Rice&#39;s storytelling, yet the TV show arguably feels less absurd than the original. While there is plenty of betrayal and intrigue in the narrative, what prevails in abundance is desire.

 Perhaps one of the most surprising and exhilarating TV series in recent memory, Yellowjackets blends the tropes of a survival thriller with terrifying fantastical horror. The split narrative follows a high school soccer team across two time periods, one in which their plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and another set years later exploring the trauma of the survivors. The show&#39;s blend of horror and psychological drama makes it unique and more than justifies its status as one of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.
