There are many examples of both original Amazon Prime Video content and existing material available on the service that has become regarded as among the best television to be found anywhere.

Fleabag (2016-2019)</p>
<p>Fleabag</p>
<p>Release Date   June 21, 2016    Cast   Phoebe Waller-Bridge , Sian Clifford , Andrew Scott , Brett Gelman    Seasons   2    Writers   Phoebe Waller-Bridge</p>
<p>Based on writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s acclaimed one-woman play of the same name, Fleabag became a viral sensation on release – and understandably so. A bitingly satirical comedy that isn&rsquo;t afraid to showcase raw emotion, Fleabag never shies away from tackling complicated, often dark subjects. While the first season deals with the fallout following the main character&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s suicide, the second offers a compelling meditation on religion and family. With its deliberately ambiguous and nuanced symbolism, Fleabag is a joy to decipher and rewards repeat viewing.</p>

<p>Following her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt&rsquo;s Creek, Annie Murphy starred in a much darker comedy with Kevin Can F**k Himself. The show delivers a clever satire of the tired housewife role seen in many multi-cam sitcoms, with Murphy playing a subversive version of the character who decides to fight back against her constrained life and her slob husband.

<p>Loosely inspired by the life of Joan Rivers, Prime Video&rsquo;s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is a pleasant comedy-drama set in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s. Rachel Brosnahan plays the titular Miriam Maisel, a homemaker who discovers a talent for stand-up comedy after her husband unexpectedly leaves her.
The show&rsquo;s stand-up scenes are consistently hilarious, yet Miriam&rsquo;s personal struggles give the show a grounded realism that&rsquo;s often incredibly emotional.

<p>Transparent</p>
<p>Release Date   February 6, 2014    Cast   Jeffrey Tambor , Gaby Hoffmann , Jay Duplass , Amy Landecker , Judith Light , Kathryn Hahn    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Transparent is a funny and relatable portrayal of a dysfunctional family in changing times, as its characters seem to be too absorbed in their own worlds to realize one of them is ready to embrace her true gender identity. One of Amazon Prime Video&rsquo;s early TV show success stories, Transparent discussed important topics in a hilarious tone, realistically portraying what ignorance feels like inside a family home. Acclaimed throughout its run, Transparent still ranks among the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.

<p>Raucous and hilarious in equal measure, Minx takes a sly look at the little-covered world of 70s erotic publishing. Joyce Prigger (Lovibond) is a young feminist in Los Angeles, who teams up with a salacious publisher (Johnson) in order to pioneer the first erotic magazine for women. Although the central story is certainly unique, Minx&rsquo;s real strength lies in the chemistry between its cast, especially Lovibond and Johnson. Its impressive Rotten Tomatoes scores ensure it easily ranks among the best comedy TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.

Just like the title suggests, the show conveys a precious summer feeling as the teenage protagonist, Belly, finds herself in an unusual love triangle with two brothers.

<p>With a razor-sharp script and high-stakes legal drama, Suits ranks as one of the best procedural shows that doesn&rsquo;t involve cops. It portrays the chaotic daily life of two brilliant lawyers: Harvey Specter, whose reputation makes him one of the best professionals in his area, and Mike Ross, a precocious college dropout who joins Harvey&rsquo;s team with a fraudulent Harvard degree.

<p>While the inner workings of an English estate in the early 1900s might sound like dry material, Downton Abbey managed to turn it into one of the most popular and riveting shows on television.

What sets The Affair apart from other infidelity dramas is its dramatic device of showing the same event through two characters&rsquo; perspectives. The show is an intense study of memory&rsquo;s relationship to fact, and it&rsquo;s anchored by the four tour de force performances of the show&rsquo;s leads.

<p>A complex parable on vigilantism and the death penalty, The Killing Vote is a critically acclaimed South Korean drama in the same mold as shows like Squid Game.

<p>In many ways, Bosch&rsquo;s hard-boiled detective feels like a relic of a bygone TV era, yet the show never fails to make the character less than compelling. Titus Welliver plays Harry Bosch, a Los Angeles police detective who works his cases with total commitment but sometimes plays by his own rules.

<p>A revival of the original 1960s sci-fi series, The Outer Limits is a classic of &rsquo;90s cult TV. Unlike other similar anthology series that are entirely their own stories, The Outer Limits would feature several continuous story arcs that were tied together in the season finales. Though it&rsquo;s often compared to The Twilight Zone, that series leans more into the fantasy whereas The Outer Limits focuses more on sci-fi, and science and technology&rsquo;s effects on society. The Outer Limits is a prototype for shows like Black Mirror but with plenty of &rsquo;90s flare.

<p>An animated superhero series that doesn&rsquo;t pull its punches, Invincible is as gnarly and blood-soaked as any live-action alternative. The story revolves around a young hero who tries to follow in the steps of his father, the world&rsquo;s most powerful superhero, unaware that he&rsquo;s in fact a heartless mass murderer. Despite the changes Invincible season 1 makes from the comics, few stories in the genre tackle the possibility of mass destruction that every superhero brings along with them this well. The result is an exceptional animated Amazon Prime Video show with unforgettable combat scenes that frequently push boundaries of violence and taste.

<p>A biting satire on the modern obsession with superheroes, The Boys is a blisteringly brutal indictment of modern consumerism. Set in a world in which heroes not only exist but are frequently corrupt and actively evil, The Boys subverts hopeful genre properties such as the MCU. Following a group of vigilantes who intend to reveal the truth about superheroes that recklessly abuse their power, The Boys is one of the most popular shows on Amazon Prime Video and is a refreshing antidote to omnipresent comic book blockbusters. Spin-off Gen V is also available on Amazon Prime Video, and The Boys season 4 will be arriving on the platform eventually too.

<p>The success of the Lord of the Rings books and movie trilogy was enough to ensure that The Rings of Power found an audience, but few believed Amazon&rsquo;s billion-dollar production could re-imagine J. R. R. Tolkien&rsquo;s world in such an evocative way. Middle-earth looks visually stunning, and the show takes its time to introduce different cultures, creatures, and of course, enemies, that put at stake the balance between good and evil. The Rings of Power takes place thousands of years before the events of Lord of the Rings, making it a great precursor to the original films.</p>

<p>Neil Gaiman is behind many excellent fantasy adaptations, including Coraline, Good Omens, The Sandman, and the Starz Original American Gods continues that trend.

The show follows an anthological style, and each season focuses on a different threat and introduces a new set of characters. New roles are often filled by the same group of actors from season to season, as the series explores a wide range of horror tropes such as haunted houses, aliens, and freak shows. Catapulting stars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters to international fame, the show also established Ryan Murphy as the doyen of pop television.

Interview With The Vampire (2022-present)</p>
<p>Interview With the Vampire</p>
<p>Release Date   October 2, 2022    Cast   Jacob Anderson , Sam Reid , Eric Bogosian , Bailey Bass    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Anne Rice&rsquo;s book Interview with the Vampire has now inspired two great adaptations: the 1994 movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and the subsequent Amazon Prime Video horror TV show. Once again, the gothic horror series follows Louis de Pointe du Lac as he recounts the story of his life as a noble vampire and the burden of immortality. Both adaptations capture the sensual nature of Rice&rsquo;s storytelling, yet the TV show arguably feels less absurd than the original. While there is plenty of betrayal and intrigue in the narrative, what prevails in abundance is desire.

Yellowjackets (2021-Present)</p>
<p>Yellowjackets</p>
<p>Release Date   November 14, 2021    Cast   Juliette Lewis , Sophie Thatcher , Warren Kole , Jasmin Savoy Brown , Tawny Cypress , Steven Krueger , Christina Ricci , Ella Purnell , Sammi Hanratty , Sophie Nélisse , Melanie Lynskey    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most surprising and exhilarating TV series in recent memory, Yellowjackets blends the tropes of a survival thriller with terrifying fantastical horror. The split narrative follows a high school soccer team across two time periods, one in which their plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and another set years later exploring the trauma of the survivors. The show&rsquo;s blend of horror and psychological drama makes it unique and more than justifies its status as one of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.
