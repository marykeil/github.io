## Literature Review

While some Below Deck franchise cast members enjoy the fan-favorite status, others are despised for their questionable attitudes on the yacht.




The Below Deck franchise has featured many great crew members with personalities that range from likable to unlikable. Ben Robinson, one of the most entertaining cast members, joined the show in the first season. He humored Below Deck viewers with his witty responses and slowly became a fan favorite over five years. Like Ben, Kate Chastain also won fans over with her sarcastic personality. The former chief stew showcased her expertise by fulfilling some of the Below Deck franchise’s hardest charters. Kate was missed by many when she left the series to pursue other ventures.
Hannah Ferrier is another memorable and well-liked cast member. The former stew made a name for herself on Below Deck Mediterranean with her leadership skills and witty personality. Despite her successful run on the show, she didn’t get the best send-off. Captain Sandy Yawn fired her for breaking contraband-related maritime laws. However, unlike Hannah, a fewBelow Deck franchise characters haven’t been able to build a great relationship with fans.

Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?












 








 10  Captain Sandy Yawn 
Below Deck Mediterranean


 







Below Deck Mediterranean’s Captain Sandy is an exceptional yacht captain who has been part of the franchise since 2017. Despite that, she has been unable to impress fans and often gets criticism for keeping a troubled work environment. The last two seasons of Below Deck Mediterranean showed Sandy allowing a lot of chaos on her yacht. She didn’t fire Kyle Viljoen for pushing Natalya Scudder to the verge of a breakdown and didn’t demote Tumi Mhlongo for engaging in unprofessional gossip.





 9  Malia White 
Below Deck Mediterranean
        

Malia White debuted on Below Deck Mediterranean in 2017. She joined the spin-off’s second season as a deckhand and later returned in season 5 and season 6 as the bosun. Malia had a fairly entertaining personality throughout her run on the franchise. However, she lost her connection with fans by helping get fan-favorite Hannah fired​​​​​​. Malia moved away from the series a few years ago because of the backlash. Fans were happy about her exit and shared their excitement on social media.
Someone even commented (via welcometomytrailer_), “she is the perfect example of a little tattletale rat in the back of the class.” 






 8  Eddie Lucas 
Below Deck
        

Eddie Lucas became popular for appearing in Below Deck seasons 1-3 and 8-9. He served under Captain Lee Rosbach and was good at his job as the deckhand and bosun. Unfortunately, Eddie’s personality changed significantly, and many fans eventually stopped caring for him. He lost his charm when he tried to pursue third stew Raquel “Rocky” Dakota despite having a girlfriend. He also tried to gaslight Rocky, which was uncalled for. Eddie did return to the Below Deck for two more seasons but could never re-invent his image.





 7  Kyle Viljoen 
Below Deck Mediterranean


 







Many Below Deck crew members have lost their touch with fans in recent years. However, no one has fallen as quickly as the controversial Kyle. The South African steward seemed like a great addition to the franchise when he debuted in 2022. He had a good friendship with Natalya and was pretty witty with the guests. Unfortunately, Kyle&#39;s personality deteriorated when he returned to Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 and began instigating problems between other crew members. He was even the cause for Natalya quitting and didn’t feel remorse. Kyle went from being the drama queen to the king of controversies.
            
 
 Below Deck Franchise Crew Members Who Transformed For The Worse After Returning To The Show 
After giving excellent performances in the first few seasons, some Below Deck franchise crew members unleash their villainous sides on the show.








 6  Leon Walker 
Below Deck
        

Leon Walker joined Below Deck season 3 and quickly became a standout. He quickly made viewers despise him for his people skills and attitude issues. Leon clashed with various Below Deck crew members, like Kate, soon after joining the show. He also rejected food requests from charter guests and started a fire in the galley. Eventually, Leon was fired by Captain Lee. In 2021, Cheat Sheet reported what Captain Lee thought of Leon. He called him the most disruptive force he has ever had “the displeasure of working with.”





 5  Ashton Pienaar 
Below Deck
        

Ashton Pienaar’s two seasons on Below Deck as the deckhand and bosun were full of twists and turns. While many viewers liked him for his physical appearance and style, he was disliked for having anger issues and always trying to be the center of the drama. Ashton had a problem with fan-favorite Kate and a feud with Rhylee Gerber. He thoroughly disappointed Captain Lee, who later called him out in his blog.
Captain Lee told Ashton, “I am sorely disappointed in you and your behavior so far. My only hope is that you can turn it around, but I’m not counting on it.” 






 4  João Franco 
Below Deck Mediterranean


 







João Franco crossed the line with his drunk behavior in Below Deck Mediterranean. The Zimbabwe native seemed too aggressive toward the second stewardess, Aesha. He didn’t make many friends but worked exceptionally well. In season 4, Captain Sandy promoted João to bosun. However, it didn’t fix his personality and only bloated his ego. Fans and his co-workers were unenthusiastic when João returned for Below Deck Down Under. However, he surprised everyone by showing a much-improved attitude. The bosun is slowly improving his image, but it’ll be a while before he can become a fan favorite.





 3  Lexi Wilson 
Below Deck Mediterranean
        

Lexi Wilson made a mark in Below Deck Mediterranean season 6. She joined the show as the second stew and surprised the crew by referring to herself as the “Satan.” In one episode, Lexi had a night full of arguments while under the influence of alcohol. She made the lives of her co-workers a nightmare and didn’t even apologize for it. Lexi became unlikable gradually over the season and couldn’t repair her image. While talking to Entertainment Tonight in 2021, Malia revealed that Lexi never felt sorry or officially apologized for her actions. She added, “I do think Lexi can put on a good stew face and get back to work.”





 2  Gary King 
Below Deck Sailing Yacht
        

Gary King had a wild journey on Below Deck Sailing Yacht. The first officer was initially somewhat likable, as he had a charming personality. However, many viewers got turned off when they realized he was chasing after women without serious intent. In Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 4, Gary repulsed many viewers when he became part of a love triangle. On one hand, he got involved with Colin Macrae and Daisy; on the other, he started pursuing Mads Harrera, knowing she liked Alex Propson. Gary is no longer as respected as he was once.





 1  Luke Jones 
Below Deck Down Under
        

Luke Jones may be the most notorious crew member ever to board a Below Deck yacht. The Australian native joined Below Deck Down Under season 2 as the bosun and initially seemed like a decent guy. However, his behavioral issues and creepiness became evident when he started trying his luck with female co-workers. In one episode, Luke did the unthinkable when he forced himself on Margot Sisson while naked. He tried to sleep with her but was stopped on time by other co-workers and producers. Captain Jason Chambers immediately fired Luke for sexual misconduct, and he’ll likely never return to the Below Deck franchise again.
Below Deck season 11 is set to premiere on February 5, 2024, at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
