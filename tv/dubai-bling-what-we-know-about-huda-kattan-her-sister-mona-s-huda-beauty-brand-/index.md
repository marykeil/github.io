## Literature Review

Dubai Bling season 2 star Mona Kattan co-founded a hugely successful beauty company, Huda Beauty. She and her sister Huda are true business moguls.  




Dubai Bling season 2 features stars who were born into wealth, but Mona Kattan&#39;s different, and it&#39;s time to talk about her ultra-successful Huda Beauty brand, which she co-founded with her sister, Huda Kattan. The glam siblings got a little help from their &#34;cool dad,&#34; who mortgaged his home when the makeup company hit turbulence. However, the sisters mostly got where they are on their own. They&#39;ve built an incredibly popular cosmetics firm. Onscreen, Huda and Mona are worker bees who occasionally enjoy swanky dinner parties and events. Since they&#39;ve worked so hard, they seem less superficial than some of their costars. Both are formidable women.




Dubai Bling season 2 launched on Netflix on December 13, 2023. Already, the show&#39;s gotten so much buzz. A lot of emotional turmoil is unfolding onscreen, including a heated (maybe ice-cold is a better way to describe it) feud between Zeina Khoury and Ebraheem Al Samadi. Mona is a new cast member who&#39;s adding a little spice to the sun-soaked proceedings. From jaw-dropping desert vistas to over-the-top high fashion and jewels, the show delivers stunning visual impact. However, under the surface, there are people like Mona, who used their grit and determination to achieve the loftiest goals.

 Are Mona &amp; Huda Kattan Just Like Kim Kardashian &amp; Kylie Jenner? 
The Dubai Bling Sisters Have Built A Major Beauty Empire
          

Kim and Kylie are beauty moguls who rose to fame on the iconic reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Both leveraged their fame by branching out into the beauty industry. This was a natural fit for them as they brought so much glamour to screens. Kylie started out with lip kits and created a hugely popular company that put her in &#34;the billionaire&#39;s club,&#34; or close to it. Kim followed suit, starting her own cosmetics firm.




Huda Beauty is amazingly successful, and Mona&#39;s sister Huda played a pivotal role in the company&#39;s rise. Huda trained as a makeup artist and was then hired by Revlon. She painted the faces of some famous women, including Eva Longoria. Her parents emigrated from Iraq to America, and eventually, the family (including Mona) made their way to Dubai. Huda&#39;s expertise was invaluable when it was time to create the beauty company. Now, Mona&#39;s the Global President of Huda Beauty. Her sister Huda&#39;s the CEO.



 What Does Huda Beauty Offer To Customers? 
Social Media Power &amp; Plenty Of Products Make Huda Beauty Shine

 

This isn&#39;t an ad, but Huda Beauty doesn&#39;t need the promotion. The company&#39;s doing pretty well as it is, and that&#39;s a serious understatement. Huda launched her business as a blog, and then branched out into products with her sister at her side. Now, the company&#39;s a force to be reckoned with. On Instagram, Huda Beauty has 54 million followers.




In 2013, Huda Beauty started booming thanks to false eyelashes that definitely met the needs of consumers. However, the firm offers a wide array of product options now, from eye shadow palettes to lip liners to &#34;Easy Bake&#34; Loose Setting Powder. Based on the almost unprecedented interest in this brand, the products really work for customers. They seemingly can&#39;t get enough of them.

Clearly, Huda and Mona know how to formulate and market the types of products that cosmetics fans are looking for. To make things more fun for their clientele, they keep adding social media content that makes it simple for followers to connect. This one-two punch has made the sisters very powerful women.

In this video, via Allure at YouTube, Huda&#39;s quite charming and shares all of her beauty secrets. She grooms her brows and moves through her entire beauty routine, which features one interesting trick. She uses actual artist&#39;s paintbrushes as tools, rather than relying solely on typical makeup brushes. Huda&#39;s a vibrant woman who makes her &#34;many steps&#34; beauty process relatable. Her sister, who&#39;s now a Dubai Bling star, probably uses plenty of these tips to get glowing for the cameras.






 Mona Kattan Has Enviable Style On Dubai Bling 
Mona Kattan Is A Fashionista

 

Mona, like her costars, brings outrageous style to screens. This season, the fashion definitely stands out. Whether a Dubai Bling star plays with volume, experiments with crayon-bright colors or goes for a sleek, sophisticated pantsuit, they are runway-ready. While some of the designs verge on Absolutely Fabulous ridiculous, it&#39;s all so much fun. Mona does her bit by donning some ultra-glam designs, including a jumpsuit in hot pink for the roller rink, as seen above.

Fashion, makeup, luxury, huge diamond rings and bracelets...these are facets of Dubai Bling season 2&#39;s decidedly decadent appeal. Now that readers know more about Huda Beauty (if they didn&#39;t know a lot already), they understand just how much Mona brings to the series. She&#39;s a makeup expert who&#39;s the part-owner of an empire.




Fascinating cast members, including Hassan Elamin, add to the fun on Dubai Bling, by showcasing aspects of themselves that go beyond externals. However, the hard-working beauty mogul Mona seems deeper than some other cast members. She&#39;s quite down to earth in light of all she has. That&#39;s probably because she didn&#39;t start out with a lot. Mona and Huda both value what really matters - family, fulfilling work and friends. They bring a little gravity to a show that sometimes seems too fluffy.

It remains to be seen if Mona will appear in season after season of Dubai Bling. There&#39;s no official confirmation yet that Dubai Bling season 3&#39;s on the way. However, if she does reappear in future seasons, it&#39;ll be a good thing. She&#39;s bright and attractive, with an astounding career that&#39;s put her right up in the stratosphere. She&#39;s an asset onscreen, and it&#39;s been fun getting to know her this season. While the show&#39;s feuds can be intense, and Mona gets in there, she&#39;s not the villain. Mona&#39;s an interesting person that makes the show more fun to watch.
