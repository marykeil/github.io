## Literature Review

Marvel has produced numerous television series that aren’t (or are no longer) considered MCU canon, some of which are better than others. 




There is a litany of Marvel television series that are not considered Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, ranging from the brilliant to the bizarre. There are 17 total shows not strictly considered canon and therefore are not a part of the MCU timeline. Some of these are considered the pinnacle of superhero television, but some have been substantially less successful.
The MCU canon has changed since several television series were released. Netflix&#39;s Defenders Saga was initially released as canonical, but was subsequently changed - though this has been further complicated by Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin and Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil appearing in MCU shows. Additionally, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Carter were designed as companions to the MCU franchise, but their true canonicity is uncertain.

  Release Date    September 29, 2017     Cast    Serinda Swan , Anson Mount , Ellen Woglom , Ken Leung , Iwan Rheon , isabelle Cornish , Mike Moh , Eme Ikwuakor , Sonya Balmores     Seasons    1     Network    Disney Channel     Streaming Service(s)    Disney&#43;    


Marvel&#39;s Inhumans followed the eponymous royal family of superhuman aliens, who seek refuge in Hawaii. The series navigates narratives concerning political turmoil, betrayal, and internal power struggles. Despite its intriguing premise, the series faced criticism for its uneven storytelling, subpar visual effects, and underdeveloped characters. Inhumans struggled to resonate with audiences and was met with a lukewarm reception, leading to its cancelation after just one season. Even now, Inhumans is considered the worst Marvel series of all time. Despite this unpopularity, Anson Mount reprized his role for a Black Bolt cameo in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.





 16  The Amazing Spider-Man (1977-1979) 
Originally Released By CBS
        

Starring Nicholas Hammon as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man portrayed a more grounded version of the iconic Marvel character. The series mostly featured Spider-Man&#39;s crime-solving and toned-down abilities. The Amazing Spider-Man faced budget constraints, leading to limited special effects and a departure from the comic book&#39;s more fantastical elements. While it gained a modest following, The Amazing Spider-Man lasted for only two seasons, leaving a nostalgic but somewhat dated imprint on Spider-Man&#39;s on-screen history. Consequently, it is one of the weakest Marvel TV shows, despite its sentimental charm.





 15  Iron Fist (2017-2018) 
Originally Released By Netflix

  Release Date    March 17, 2017     Cast    Ludovic Coutaud , Donté Grey , Alberto Bonilla , Craig Geraghty , Finn Jones , Murray Bartlett , José Báez , Jessica Henwick , Paugh Shadow , Lewis Tan , Myles Humphus     Network    Disney Channel     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix    


Netflix&#39;s Iron Fist followed Danny Rand (Finn Jones), a martial artist who returns to New York after his presumed death, to reclaim his family&#39;s business. Possessing the power of the Iron Fist, he battles crime and corruption. Despite high expectations, the series faced criticism for its slow pacing, lackluster fight choreography, and a perceived lack of cultural sensitivity in its portrayal of martial arts. While season 2 attempted improvements, Iron Fist was ultimately canceled after two seasons, marking it as the least successful entry in Netflix&#39;s Defenders Saga.

The show followed the half-vampire, half-human vampire hunter as he pursued his eternal quest to eliminate supernatural threats. Set after the events of the Blade trilogy, the series exposed Blade&#39;s complex relationships and his ongoing battle against a new vampire menace. Despite offering a darker, serialized take on the character, Blade: The Series faced challenges with its narrative structure and high production costs, leading to its premature cancelation after just one season. While it failed to achieve long-term success, it remains a notable entrant into Marvel television.

The Defenders, the Netflix miniseries, united Marvel&#39;s street-level heroes from their respective solo series in the Defenders Saga. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist were forced together by a common enemy and faced the ancient organization known as The Hand. While praised for its character crossovers and dynamic team-ups, The Defenders received mixed reviews for its pacing and plot complexity. The series represented the culmination of Netflix&#39;s Marvel shows, and while The Defenders did a reasonable job of bringing the hero team together, it failed to deliver more than the saga&#39;s solo shows.
