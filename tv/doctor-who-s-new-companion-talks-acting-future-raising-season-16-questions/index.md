## Literature Review
Millie Gibson opens up about her hopes for her acting career, raising questions about her companion Ruby Sunday&#39;s future in Doctor Who season 16.




Doctor Who newcomer Millie Gibson opens up about what her career hopes are beyond season 15&#39;s production, raising questions about whether her companion Ruby Sunday will return for season 16. Gibson made her debut in Doctor Who&#39;s 2023 seasonal special &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; where she first encountered Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth incarnation of the Time Lord. Gibson will rejoin Gatwa for future time-traveling adventures in season 14, set to air in May 2024. The two are currently filming season 15, which is expected to air in 2025.




While Gibson&#39;s adventures in Doctor Who season 14 have yet to air beyond the special, she opened up about her future hopes for her career to Fabric Magazine. When asked what&#39;s on the way in 2024, Gibson stated that she expects to seek out new auditions now that 2023&#39;s SAG-AFTRA strike is resolved. She also hopes to take on a villainous role or star in a biopic should the opportunity arise. Check out Gibson&#39;s full response below:


I think, now that the strike’s over, probably auditioning again, for parts, and seeing what’s out there. Every year has seen such change for me, it’s hard to think what might come next. I’d like to play a villain... If not that I think I’m really intrigued by biopic roles that you really need to research. I think that would be a great challenge. I don’t know, I think I’m just excited to see what’s to come.



 Will Ruby Sunday Leave the TARDIS in Doctor Who Season 15? 
          




With Gibson completing two seasons once season 15 wraps, many viewers may be concerned about what her comments could mean for Ruby&#39;s future as a Doctor Who companion. Across the revived era, few companions have remained with the Doctor beyond three seasons, with characters including Billie Piper&#39;s Rose Tyler, Karen Gillan&#39;s Amy Pond, and Jenna Coleman&#39;s Clara Oswald traveling in the TARDIS for two complete seasons and a handful of additional episodes. As such, Gibson leaving the show after two seasons would not be out of the norm for companion tenures.

However, Doctor Who&#39;s current filming schedule may allow Gibson to explore other roles before returning for a potential third season as Ruby Sunday. Filming on season 15 and 2024&#39;s seasonal special began in October 2023, a mere three months after season 14 wrapped in July 2023. As such, the gap between filming seasons 15 and 16 can be longer without affecting the show&#39;s release schedule. For example, Gatwa and Gibson could take part in other productions later this year and at the start of the next before returning to film Doctor Who in the second half of 2025.




Gibson&#39;s companion is already key to the new season of Doctor Who, as the mystery of Ruby Sunday&#39;s parentage was a central factor in her debut story. As such, the role is a perfect opportunity for Gibson to impress viewers and pave her way for future success. While her comments show that she has ambitions beyond the TARDIS doors, audiences can still look forward to seeing Gibson and Gatwa&#39;s adventures across two seasons, beginning with Doctor Who season 14.



Doctor Who&#39;s &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; is currently available on Disney&#43; for international viewers and BBC iPlayer for UK audiences. Season 14 is set to air in May 2024.
