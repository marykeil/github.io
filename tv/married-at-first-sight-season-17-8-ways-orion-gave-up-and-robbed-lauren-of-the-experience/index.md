## Literature Review
Orion Martzloff is too immature to be in a committed relationship. His childish antics ruined the Married At First Sight experience for Lauren.




Orion Martzloff from Married At First Sight hasn’t proved himself to be a great partner to Lauren. The independent contractor met the federal budget officer on the reality TV series, where they fulfilled each other’s expectations. Lauren wanted someone hopeful, faithful, and crazy, and since Orion shared some of those traits, she didn’t hesitate to get married to him. She accepted Orion as her husband as he claimed he was ready to fall in love.
Like most Married At First Sight duos, Orion and Lauren faced numerous challenges in their relationship. Two of their biggest issues were misunderstanding and the inability to understand each other’s side. In one episode, Lauren jokingly called Orion a “red skin” because of his sunburn. One thing led to another, and Orion turned the whole situation into a big argument. In another episode, Orion got turned off by the fact that Lauren hadn’t been intimate for two months. He saw it as a symbol of Lauren’s failure and shamed her.

 8  Orion Doesn’t Want To Compromise 
Orion Disappointed Lauren’s Dad With His Questions


It was clear from the start that Orion wasn’t too impressed with Lauren’s free-spirited nature and past sex life. Despite that, he continued to waste her time and robbed her of the marital experience that was supposed to be special. One of the worst things Orion did was disappoint Lauren’s dad with his answers. In one episode of Married At First Sight season 17, Lauren’s dad asks Orion about where he wants to live in the future. While Orion did answer it, he didn’t include Lauren in his plans. Lauren’s dad was visibly unhappy about the whole conversation and said, “I have a concern listening to you now.”





 7  Orion Handled The “Red Skin” Incident Badly 
Orion Doesn’t Understand Lauren’s Intentions


In marriage, one must have mutual understanding and show respect to their significant other. However, Orion never tried to step into Lauren’s shoes and see things from her perspective. In another episode, Orion fails to understand Lauren’s joke and gets offended when she calls him “red skin.” The remark wasn’t racially motivated or related to his looks. Lauren simply used the word to describe that Orion was sunburned, not to make fun of his appearance. However, Orion was furious about the comment and didn’t see that his partner was concerned about him.





 6  Orion Is Inconsistent With Things He Says 
Orion Keeps Changing His Stance Regarding Intimacy
        

Orion has also not been consistent with his views on Married At First Sight. In one episode, he showed disdain when Lauren revealed she had been physical with another man just months before they met. He acted superior and claimed that sex was off the table between him and Lauren for some time. As expected, Lauren confronted him about it and called him out. However, he suddenly changed his stance and made it seem like Lauren’s past sex life wasn’t related to his decision not to want intimacy yet.





 5  Orion Got Mad That Lauren Had Slept With Someone Recently 
Lauren’s Past Life Bothers Orion
        

Orion shouldn’t have been mad about Lauren’s past sex life. If he was uncomfortable with something so minor, he should’ve clarified it from the get-go or not pursued a relationship with her. Lauren didn’t sleep with someone else as an act of cheating or infidelity; she was a single woman, and Orion didn’t exist for her then. Orion&#39;s decision to punish her for something she did before they met shows he isn’t husband material, a huge red flag in Lauren and Orion&#39;s relationship. He had no right to judge her and sex shame her while acting high and mighty.

Married at First Sight&#39;s Orion is having a major falling out with his new wife, Lauren, and he may be the one causing the situation to worsen. 









 4  Orion Blindsided Lauren With A Divorce Request 
Orion Didn’t Give Lauren A Fair Chance To Work On Their Issues


 







Toxic partners often blindside their significant others. Orion did this when he suddenly asked Lauren for a divorce because he had randomly lost all romantic interest in her. In one of the latest episodes, Orion said everything that took place made him lose interest in Lauren. He added, “I’m not trying to control what’s happening by calling for a divorce.” Instead of working through the issues and resolving to build a better marital life, Orion felt giving up was a better option. If he was a decent partner to Lauren, he would’ve tried to make the marriage work.





 3  Orion Didn’t Give The Process A Chance 
Orion Was Too Quick To Call It Quits
        

Married At First Sight doesn’t have a high success rate. However, the pairs who make it are the ones who believe in the process, experts, and each other. Lauren was always ready to push herself to make her marriage to Orion work. She was sure that spending two more weeks would help resolve their relationship issues. Experts believed Orion and Lauren were a perfect match; however, Orion was never certain about his future. The Denver native should’ve given his marriage a chance instead of giving up on Lauren so early on.





 2  Orion Tuned The Experts’ Opinions Out 
Orion Refused To Listen To Others’ Advice


 







One of Orion’s biggest red flags was that he didn’t even care about the experts and their suggestions. The Married at First Sight star met with Dr. Pia and Pastor Cal in past episodes, but he never agreed with their suggestions. When Dr. Pia tried to clear up the miscommunication about the sex situation, Orion felt that he needed more space. He then clung to the fact that Lauren called out his red skin and continued to make himself feel like a victim. Experts wanted Orion to give Lauren a chance and some grace, but he decided to disregard their advice outright.





 1  Orion Had Chemistry With Lauren But Chose To Be Unwilling 
Orion Bailed On True Love Due To His Childish Behavior


 







Experts were mostly right when they matched Orion and Lauren. The two did seem compatible and had an undeniable chemistry that had potential. However, Orion messed up the relationship with his behavior. He decided to stay mad about unnecessary things and continued to behave terribly. Orion wasted Lauren’s time and proved unworthy of being her partner. Despite being 27 years old, Orion showed he wasn’t mature enough to be anyone’s husband. Most women want someone they can rely on in tough situations, someone who’s supportive and by their side no matter the hardship. Married At First Sight’s Orion is a quitter, and it’s good Lauren saw that before it was too late.
