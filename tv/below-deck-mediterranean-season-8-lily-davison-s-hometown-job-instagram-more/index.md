## Literature Review
Lily Davison was introduced as the newest stew on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 during Monday&#39;s new episode. Find out more about her. 




Lily Davison was introduced on Monday night&#39;s brand-new episode as the new steward replacing Natalya Scudder in Below Deck Mediterranean season 8. She was brought onto the team after Natalya decided it was her time to leave the boat. Natalya had recently had a blow-out fight with fellow stew Kyle Viljoen during their latest crew night out and realized she was working in a toxic environment. While most of the crew were sad to see her leave, like Chef Jack Luby, who called her his best friend on board, others, like Kyle and Chief Stew Tumi Mhlongo, were okay with her leaving the boat.




In the mid-season trailer for Below Deck Med season 8, Lily was featured a lot more than she was in the episode. The trailer showed her getting into bed with deckhand Max Salvador, so it seems they started a boatmance shortly after he expressed interest in her during her first episode. Besides Lily&#39;s romantic interest, the trailer also showed the downfall of Jessika Asai and Luka Brunton&#39;s boatmance, Jessika making out with Max, and a possible Luka and Lily hook-up. Not to mention, Natalya will also return to the season during one of the crew nights out, where she will likely meet Lily.

 Where Did Lily Grow Up? 

 

According to her bio on BravoTV, Lily grew up in Windsor, which is just outside of London, England. In her bio, she revealed that she lived close to Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married, and of course, everything important British royal from that family. Before Lily started her yachting career, she said she worked at several key events in England, such as Royal Ascot or Wimbledon. Since Lily is a fellow Brit, she and Chef Jack hit it off immediately, which was shown during the last moments of Monday night&#39;s new Below Deck Med episode. Kyle caught on and didn&#39;t like their blossoming friendship one bit.






 Lily&#39;s Job 
          

On Below Deck Med season 8, Lily was hired as a stew to replace Natalya after she abruptly left during last week&#39;s episode. Since Lily is more inexperienced in the interior compared to the stew of the stews, her main duty is to work in the laundry room. However, it seems there may be trouble brewing between her and Kyle as he sassed her about not doing the laundry properly toward the end of Monday night&#39;s episode.

Lily&#39;s lack of interior knowledge might be because she doesn&#39;t work in the interior often. This was her first huge yacht, as the last boat she worked on was a catamaran. Lily also works as a chef, which is evident by her secondary Instagram account, @lilyofthegalley.



 Lily&#39;s Instagram 

 




Lily&#39;s main Instagram account consists of images of her on vacation, usually near the water. She was most recently in Tulum, Mexico, and Nashville, Tennessee, and even visited Zion National Park. What all these images have in common is what looks to be her boyfriend. In most of these posts, Lily is snapping photos alongside someone tagged as Nik Dorward. He has an Instagram as well, and in his bio, he says he&#39;s a captain. The pair have been together for a while as she shared a recent photo alongside him captioned, &#34;1 year.&#34;

Lily also has a cooking Instagram, where she showcases her cooking style. According to the bio for her secondary Instagram, she works as a chef for @sailing_location, where her alleged boyfriend works as a captain. This was likely how the cute couple met.



 Will Lily Make It To The End On Below Deck Med Season 8? 
         




In the mid-season trailer for Below Deck Med season 8, it seems like Lily will have some trouble on board. Lily was not only seen trying to hook up with Luka, who is already seeing Jessika, but she looks to be having issues in terms of her work ethic. Tumi could be heard calling Lily &#34;dead weight&#34; and Jessika saying she &#34;can&#39;t trust&#34; her to work by herself. Captain Sandy Yawn even has a sit down with Lily where she tells her to &#34;be more aware,&#34; or she will have to &#34;make a change&#34; (via @BelowDeckBravo). It seems Lily will be a handful in the upcoming episodes of Below Deck Med.
