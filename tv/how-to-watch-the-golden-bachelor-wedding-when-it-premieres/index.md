## Literature Review
The first The Golden Bachelor couple, Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist, are all set to walk down the aisle in what will be a historic Bachelor event. 




The premiere season of The Golden Bachelor saw lead Gerry Turner propose to Theresa Nist, and the pair are headed to the altar very soon. Gerry and Theresa are the first Bachelor Nation pair to get married in ten years. They also have the shortest engagement time in franchise history, having gotten engaged in September. 72-year-old retired restauranteur from Indiana, Gerry, became a widow in 2017 after his wife Toni passed away suddenly from a bacterial infection shortly after retiring. Theresa, 70, from New Jersey, is also a widower, having lost her husband Billy after having been married since she was 18.




Gerry started his The Golden Bachelor journey with 22 women vying for his heart. He made close connections with many of them but narrowed it down to his final three, Theresa, Faith Martin, and Leslie Fhima, with whom he went on hometown dates. He told all three women he loved them at one point. Gerry was the cause of many tears and broke several hearts on his way to find the woman he couldn&#39;t live without, Theresa. Bachelor Nation fans fell in love with Gerry for his authenticity, empathetic nature, and desire to find love in his sunset years.

 Gerry &amp; Theresa&#39;s Journey To The Altar Explained 

 




Theresa went on the very first The Golden Bachelor date with Gerry, and the two had instant chemistry and bonded over their shared past of losing their spouses. Gerry loved Theresa&#39;s vivaciousness and sincerity, while Theresa was smitten with everything Gerry did. Gerry fell right in with Theresa&#39;s family during their hometown date, and the visit only proved to bring them closer. He chose Theresa to be in his final two along with Leslie, and they headed to Costa Rica for Fantasy Suites dates.

Gerry had his first overnight date with Leslie, and it couldn&#39;t have gone better for them. It went so well, in fact, that Gerry had a hard time being present for his date with Theresa the next day. However, things turned around after Theresa showed Gerry her different sides, and he gravitated toward what Theresa had to offer. In a blindside for Leslie, Gerry chose Theresa. He delivered a nail-biting proposal to anxious Theresa, who happily said yes when she realized she was chosen. Since then, Theresa and Gerry have showcased their love on social media, podcasts, and talk shows.
