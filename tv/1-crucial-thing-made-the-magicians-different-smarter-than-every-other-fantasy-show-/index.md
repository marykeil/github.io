## Literature Review
Magic is treated differently–and far darker and more dangerous–in The Magicians, and it&#39;s what sets it apart from other fantasy TV shows.

Though The Magicians is no longer airing, it still stands apart from other fantasy-based TV shows thanks to one crucial element that makes it smarter than other shows in the genre. The Magicians, based on Lev Grossman&#39;s books, follows the Brakebills University students as they work to learn to awaken and control their magical abilities. Studies, however, always take a back seat to the various crises and monsters they face along the way and the trips they take to the not-so-imaginary magical world of Fillory.

On the surface, it&#39;s easy to compare The Magicians to Harry Potter, with both franchises involving students going to a school to learn magic. But the sweetness of Harry Potter doesn&#39;t exist in The Magicians. For starters, the students are older–older, even, than traditional college students. The Magicians grapples with much darker themes: drinking and partying, rape, substance abuse, suicidal ideation, depression, and other more unpleasant aspects of reality. Even magic itself is treated differently in The Magicians, and it&#39;s what sets it apart from other fantasy TV shows.


## Magic In The Magicians Always Comes With A Steep Price

In virtually every other fantasy TV show and movie, wielding magic is portrayed as a purely positive thing. In the universes of those shows, magic is full of whimsy and wonder. At most, magic users might receive a lecture about how important it is to learn how to control their abilities, and to never dabble in dark magic. All too often, magic is treated similarly to Batman&#39;s utility belt, seemingly able to fix any situation. No matter how dangerous or difficult a situation in which the characters find themselves, there always seems to be a spell that can get them out of it.

In a broad step away from those shows, The Magicians makes it clear that simply using magic comes at a price – an often steep one. Magic virtually always rebounds negatively, and it often makes situations worse. Anytime powerful magic is used in the human world, it virtually always has a powerful and opposite effect in the world of Fillory. Using magic to solve a problem in The Magicians is often a temporary stopgap as it only creates future problems, and the more powerful the spell, the greater the rebound. It&#39;s a cruel irony, but one that thematically fits the darkness of using magic: in The Magicians&#39; universe, magic doesn&#39;t come from talent, but from pain. The more pain one has felt, the stronger they are as magicians.


## Using Magic In The Magicians Is Like Abusing Substances

It&#39;s not a coincidence that using magic in The Magicians is analogous to substance abuse. Even at times in the series when characters know that using magic will only harm them or others further, they still crave the feeling. This is never more pronounced than in Julia&#39;s arc. When she&#39;s not accepted for admission at Brakebills, and kicked out of the non-officially recognized hedge witches, things go south. With her supply of magic suddenly cut off, Julia goes to increasing lengths to feel the rush of using magic again. The gnawing hunger and emptiness she feels is withdrawal; using magic is an addiction. Magic is a drug, and a magician can overdose, as one magician does in a particularly horrifying scene after spewing blood from her face and dying.

The Magicians isn&#39;t afraid to go dark places, which is why it has some of the smartest and most interesting writing in the fantasy genre. It doesn&#39;t just grapple with complex and adult subjects; the very concept that underpins the entire series is also fraught with pain and loss. The Magicians directly engages with magic in a way other fantasy shows do not: magic isn&#39;t a silver bullet, but the problem, and it&#39;s a problem the characters will never stop making worse.
