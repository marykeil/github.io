## Literature Review

Dubai Bling season 2&#39;s Hassan Elamin isn&#39;t a typical reality TV gold digger. Learn about Mona Katty&#39;s husband&#39;s age, career and Instagram now. 




Dubai Bling season 2 star Hassan Elamin&#39;s married to Mona Kattan, and it&#39;s time to share some fascinating facts about his life. On the show, Hassan isn&#39;t getting the villain edit. He&#39;s polite, easygoing, and very supportive of his hard-working wife. Mona and her sister Huda Kattan own the hugely successful cosmetics empire, Huda Beauty. While Hassan isn&#39;t in control of a billion-dollar company like his wife, he&#39;s very successful. Together, the duo reign in Dubai. Mona&#39;s deeply in love with her partner.




Men who truly believe in their wives are wonderful, and the fact that Hassan is always there for Mona makes him a very likable Dubai Bling season 2 cast member. Mona&#39;s someone who has worked very hard to achieve her goals. On the show, she escapes from everyday pressures in her &#34;perfume room.&#34; She sells perfume via her own company, Kayali. While enjoying a host of fragrance &#34;notes,&#34; including vanilla sugar, saffron and oakmoss, Dubai Bling&#39;s Mona Kattan&#39;s able to unwind. However, her husband also ensures that she takes time to smell the roses.

                  Dubai Bling: Has Hassan Elamin Revealed His Nationality?   Dubai Bling star Mona Kattan&#39;s married to Hassan Elamin, and it&#39;s time to discuss his background. There&#39;s a lot of curiosity about his nationality.

Hassan&#39;s currently 37 years old. He was reportedly born in 1988, in early August. If he was born around that time, he&#39;s a Leo. This sunny zodiac sign is all about claiming (and enjoying) the spotlight. A lot of famous people are born under this Sun sign, including Madonna, Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron. Leos have healthy egos, and they need a lot of adoration in order to be happy. In Mona&#39;s post above, he&#39;s clearly a happy man.

When a Leo man gets enough attention, his warmhearted, generous and funny spirit can soar. However, when a male Leo feels slighted, the claws inevitably come out. Don&#39;t provoke the zodiac&#39;s king of the jungle - like the lions that symbolize them, Leos are fierce in battle. They try to destroy their prey.

With Mona, who&#39;s an earthy and sensual Taurus (her ruling planet is Venus), Hassan probably feels very safe and loved. Taurus women are naturally affectionate. In fact, they love to touch their partners and &#34;baby&#34; them. In this sense, Mona&#39;s a great match for a Leo man - these guys can be surprisingly needy. However, a Taurus will always be practical, while a Leo is much more grandiose. Since the Leo considers the world a stage, his partner may grow weary of the histrionics. If Mona doesn&#39;t mind taking a backseat sometimes, this pairing can really work.






 Dubai Bling Season 2&#39;s Hassan Elamin&#39;s Job 
Hassan Elamin Works In The Insurance Industry
          

Hassan, whose costar Zeina Khoury&#39;s in a heated feud with Ebraheem Al Samadi, started dating Mona in January 2021 (they got engaged on December 4 of the same year), and before that, he began building the successful career that he has today. Hassan works as the Head of Facultative MENA at Aon Reinsurance. This type of reinsurance is bought to cover a specific group of risks or just one risk. Hassan studied at Bayes Business School in London, England, earning a Master&#39;s Degree in Insurance and Risk Management.

Since Huda Beauty&#39;s worth a fortune, Mona probably had to beware of gold diggers, but Hassan isn&#39;t taking his wife for a ride. He continues to work even though Mona is loaded. Since both of them are in the workforce, they are equals. Sure, her net worth is probably much higher, but it&#39;s safe to say that he earns good money at his job as he&#39;s quite high up on the totem pole. Together, they seem to have it all. They use their education and experience to build a dream life together.




The Leo man Hassan wants some lion cubs, so he&#39;s strongly encouraging Mona to make parenthood a priority. Right now, she wants a little wiggle room. Onscreen, in Dubai Bling season 2, she promised to start trying for a baby in four months. Mona wants children too, but she&#39;s got a lot on her plate and that&#39;s why she wants to wait.

Since he&#39;s such a caring partner, Hassan will probably be a loving dad. So far, they haven&#39;t announced that they&#39;re expecting. Hopefully, that will happen soon. No matter what, they&#39;ve got each other. Their life in Dubai is glitzy beyond belief, but there&#39;s something down to earth about Mona.

Unlike some other cast members, Mona&#39;s happy to wear a tracksuit and lounge on the couch. Sure, it&#39;s an upscale tracksuit, but she gives off strong &#34;tired after work&#34; vibes sometimes. This makes her very relatable. Hassan probably appreciates the fact that his wife is so into her career. They are both driven people.

Hassan doesn&#39;t have as much Instagram clout as his wife Mona, but he&#39;s attracting followers, and his Dubai Bling fame is probably the reason why. Right now, Hassan&#39;s showing off his wife on social media, as seen in the post above, where they were both dressed to kill for an &#34;epic party.&#34; Sensible Taurus Mona went for a classic dark outfit, while Elamin went full Leo in a white tux jacket and matching shirt. Both looked fabulous as they prepared to ring in the New Year.

At Instagram, reality TV show star Hassan shows different sides of himself. There&#39;s the flashy &#34;making the scene&#34; side, but there&#39;s more to him than that. His sense of romance and playfulness comes through in his posts. In one Instagram clip, he dressed up as a teddy bear and danced around with Mona. In some snaps and videos, he actually dresses down a bit, but there are some Gucci prints in the mix. This man has an enviable wardrobe. Most of the time, he looks like he just stepped off a runway in Paris or Milan. See the cute teddy bear cosplay moment below:





 

Mona and Hassan are a fun couple. They&#39;re happy people with interesting careers. They have a lot of plans for the future. They seem extremely compatible, and Hassan posts a lot about his wife online. He&#39;s proud of her and loves her. In a reality TV show world where a lot of couples are at each other&#39;s throats, this duo stands out just by being happy. That may be why Hassan is a Dubai Bling season 2 breakout star.



Dubai Bling season 2&#39;s now streaming on Netflix.
