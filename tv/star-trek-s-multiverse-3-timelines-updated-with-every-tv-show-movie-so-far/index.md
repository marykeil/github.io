## Literature Review

Star Trek&#39;s Multiverse includes 3 timelines spanning from Enterprise&#39;s 22nd century to Discovery&#39;s 32nd century - now updated for 2024.




An updated Star Trek timeline shows the franchise&#39;s Multiverse, consisting of 3 timelines that encompass the Prime reality, J.J. Abrams&#39; alternate Kelvin reality, and the Mirror Universe. Star Trek created its own Multiverse with the introduction of the Mirror Universe in Star Trek: The Original Series season 2. The darker Mirror reality has been revisited in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Enterprise, and Star Trek: Discovery. In 2009, J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek movie reboot created an entirely new Kelvin timeline where Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and the crew of the USS Enterprise live different lives.




On Twitter/X, @TrekOnTheTube updated the Timelines of Star Trek for 2024, with the only major addition being the end of Star Trek: Picard season 3 in 2402. Timelines of Star Trek tracks the progress of the franchise&#39;s 3 main realities over a thousand years, starting with the 22nd century of Star Trek: Enterprise to the 32nd century of Star Trek: Discovery, along with the occasions when the timelines have intersected. Included are all of the canonical Star Trek movies and TV series. Check out @TrekOnTheTube&#39;s post and click on the image below to zoom into it:


 

          






Missing from Timelines of Star Trek is the alternate 25th century that Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran) is trapped in. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will travel to the planet Solum in the year 2435 of the alternate future to rescue Chakotay.




                  Star Trek Is Spread Out Across 3 Streaming Services Now - Where To Watch   The Star Trek franchise is split across three different streaming services in 2024. Here&#39;s where to watch your favorite Star Trek movies and shows.   


 How Star Trek&#39;s Timelines &amp; Multiverse Could Change In 2024 
&#34;Time is the fire in which we burn.&#34;
         

2024 could potentially see some significant additions and alterations to the Timelines of Star Trek. Star Trek: Discovery season 5 is the final season that ends Captain Michael Burnham&#39;s (Sonequa Martin-Green) 32nd-century adventures, but Disco should also set up 2025&#39;s Star Trek: Starfleet Academy series, which is believed to be set after Discovery to continue the 32nd century. Star Trek: Section 31, the made-for-streaming film starring Academy Award-winner Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Philippa Georgiou, could be a wildcard since it&#39;s unclear when in the timeline it takes place. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 also centers on an expedition to an alternate 25th-century timeline as Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) launches the USS Voyager-A to rescue Captain Chakotay.






In Star Trek: Picard season 2, Q (John de Lancie) changed the Prime timeline in the 21st century into the dark reality where Earth was ruled by the evil Confederation, but Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his motley crew righted the timeline and erased the Confederation reality.




Star Trek movies that are reportedly in development could also impact the Timelines of Star Trek. A Star Trek origin movie set &#34;decades before&#34; J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek (2009) could slot in sometime after Star Trek: Enterprise. Star Trek 4, said to be the &#34;final chapter&#34; of the Star Trek movies starring Chris Pine would also continue the Kelvin Timeline past where Star Trek Beyond left off in 2263. And, if Star Trek: Picard gets a continuation movie or spinoff TV series, that would also push Star Trek further into the 25th century of the Prime Timeline.
