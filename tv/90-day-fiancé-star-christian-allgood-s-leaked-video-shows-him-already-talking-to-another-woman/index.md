## Literature Review
Christian Allgood from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days appears to be moving on after his split from Cleo Corraine as he gets cozy with a new woman.




Christian Allgood has seemingly moved on after splitting from Cleo Corraine, but 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days viewers aren’t happy about it. The 31-year-old Minnesota resident became popular for his storyline with the transgender woman. He loved her but couldn’t stop himself from talking to other women. On the show, Christian shunned Cleo numerous times, making her cry. Later, he surprised everyone by proposing to her at the Before the 90 Days season 6 Tell-All, continuing their relationship. The pair reconnected in the United States, where Christian introduced Cleo to his family. However, things didn’t work out, which caused them to break up.




Recently, Redditor Evebluedream posted a video of Christian showing what he has been up to. The Reddit user captioned the post, “Christian talking to women when he shouldn’t, yet again.” The clip showed the American man cuddling with a woman at a club.


 

One of the snippets in the post showed Christian opening his arms and leaning into the woman. Another part of the clip showcased him dancing with confidence and looking carefree. Christian seemed far happier than he was when he appeared on 90 Day Fiancé with Cleo.

 Christian &amp; Cleo&#39;s Relationship Issues Explained 
          

Christian and Cleo had many differences during their journey on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. However, their most prominent issue was Christian’s inability to embrace Cleo as she is. He had exclusively dated cis women before her. Therefore, he had a hard time accepting the British transwoman for who she was. Christian repeatedly hurt Cleo by lying to her and the cameras. He downplayed his connection to Cleo, talked to other women, and didn’t prove himself to be a great partner. While he did propose to her, it came after weeks of emotional betrayal and tears.

The fan video proves that Christian is back to his old ways already. While some 90 Day Fiancé viewers thought he was truly in love with Cleo, the clip hints he was probably not. Most people who lose their partners might not be able to move on so easily. It takes months, if not years, for people to feel slightly normal after ending their engagement. It appears the American reality star was probably just infatuated with Cleo and rushed into a proposal to stay with her. However, things backfired, which led him to break up with the British model.




There’s also a slight chance that the video isn’t as legitimate as everyone expects. While the clip shows Christian conversing with another woman, it doesn’t reveal if the incident was recent. It’s possible that the clip is old and just resurfaced online. Christian hasn’t shared any photos or videos from a club or posted about his life. He still has pictures of Cleo on his social media, including their date in America. There is a small possibility that the video isn’t new. Even if the incident is recent, it’s fine for the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days alum to chill out and talk to women.
