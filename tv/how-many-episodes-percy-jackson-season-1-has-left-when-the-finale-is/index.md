Summary

  Percy Jackson season 1 has three episodes left out of a total of eight, following the typical season length of hit Disney&#43; shows.   The remaining episodes will cover Percy&#39;s dangerous quest to find Zeus&#39; lightning bolt and prevent a war among Greek gods.   New episodes of Percy Jackson season 1 will be released weekly on Tuesdays at 9 pm ET/6 pm PT, with the season finale airing on January 30, 2024.  







Disney’s long-awaited Percy Jackson and the Olympians show is still in the midst of Percy&#39;s quest after five outings, and a few more episodes still remain before the season 1 finale releases. Following the divisive adaptations of the same-named book series into movies in 2010 and 2013, Disney is trying its hand at Percy Jackson and the Olympians as a TV show, with author Rick Riordan being involved in the series. Percy Jackson season 1 boasts glowing reviews from critics, including a &#34;Certified Fresh&#34; 96% score on Rotten Tomatoes, making the Disney&#43; streaming series a hit adaptation following its premiere on December 19, 2023.

Percy Jackson season 1 kicked off by exporing the titular character&#39;s origins as a 12-year-old discovering he’s the demigod son of Poseidon. After introducing more of Percy Jackson season 1’s cast of characters at Camp Half-Blood, the show saw Percy, Annabeth, and Grover finally embark on their quest to the Underworld. The trio then faced off against Medusa in episode 3, had a run-in with Echidna and Chimera in episode 4, and encountered both Ares and Hephaestus in episode 5. Though Walker Scobell’s Percy is nearing the end of his quest, Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 still has plenty more mythological creatures and gods to introduce ahead of the finale.





 


 Percy Jackson Season 1 Has 3 Episodes Left Out Of 8 Total 
         

There are only three episodes remaining in Percy Jackson season 1 after &#34;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers,&#34; out of eight episodes total. While this may seem like a short season, it follows the typical season length of hit Disney&#43; original TV shows such as Ahsoka, The Mandalorian, and Loki. The 2023 Star Wars show Ahsoka also shared a similar episode release strategy to Percy Jackson of a two-episode premiere followed by one new installment each week.



Percy Jackson and the Olympians is available to stream on Disney&#43;. Episode 1 is also streaming on Hulu.







Since Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 is adapting Riordan’s first entry in the book series, The Lightning Thief, the episode total is sufficient to cover the 377-page novel&#39;s events. The Disney&#43; series already introduced numerous characters at Camp Half-Blood and has seen the trio encounter several of Percy Jackson&#39;s dangerous gods and monsters before reaching the Underworld. Still, with only three episodes left, Percy does have a few key mythological figures he has yet to meet in season 1, including his father, Poseidon. Before Percy Jackson’s season 1 finale, he still has to find Zeus’ Master Bolt, identify who stole it, save his mother, and prevent a war among the Greek gods.

New episodes of Percy Jackson will continue to be released on Tuesdays at 9 pm ET/6 pm PT on Disney&#43;, with one new installment debuting each week through the finale.

While Percy Jackson season 2 has yet to be officially renewed by Disney&#43;, the show’s early success indicates that another outing is highly likely. Considering there are six books by Riordan in the main series, the series could also go on to have as many seasons if it maintains its acclaim. Consequently, the upcoming Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 8 likely won’t be the last time that Walker Scobell’s Percy, Leah Jeffries’ Annabeth, and Aryan Simhadri’s Grover battle mythological beings on the Disney&#43; show.
