## Literature Review

The debut of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 breaks a Disney&#43; viewership record on the newly released Nielsen streaming chart.




Percy Jackson and the Olympians has smashed a streaming record for Disney&#43;. The new fantasy show is adapted from the book series of the same name by Rick Riordan. Inspired by Greek mythology, it follows 12-year-old Percy Jackson (Walker Scobell) discovering that he is the son of the god Poseidon and being whisked off to train at Camp Half-Blood before going on a quest to discover the thief of Zeus&#39; Master Bolt alongside his friends, the satyr Grover (Aryan Simhadri) and Athena&#39;s daughter Annabeth (Leah Sava Jeffries).




Per TVLine, the debut of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 on Disney&#43; racked up 572 million minutes viewed during its debut week on the Nielsen streaming chart, ranking No. 4 overall for the week of December 18 behind Prime Video&#39;s Reacher and Netflix&#39;s The Crown and My Life with the Walter Boys. This makes it the most-viewed debut week for a non-Marvel, non-Star Wars show on Disney&#43; since Nielsen started measuring streaming in March 2020. The only other such series to even land in the Top 10 during its debut week was Goosebumps with 553 million minutes.


 How Percy Jackson and the Olympians Compares To Other Hit Disney&#43; Shows 
          

Even with the Percy Jackson cast being populated with relative unknowns in the lead roles (save Walker Scobell, who starred in 2022&#39;s The Adam Project opposite Ryan Reynolds), the show is putting up strong competition across the board for Disney&#43;. In fact, the only live-action show debut that performed better than Percy Jackson in the entirety of 2023 (up through December 18) is Ahsoka. The Star Wars spinoff show was streamed for 829 million minutes during its debut week.




Although the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars are tentpole brands for the streamer, Marvel&#39;s debuts throughout 2023 couldn&#39;t compete with Percy Jackson whatsoever. In fact, the most recent MCU show to outrank Percy Jackson in its debut week was Hawkeye, which premiered in November 2021. Below, check out how Percy Jackson compares to the debut week of every Marvel show between the release of Hawkeye and December 18, 2023.

 Title  Debut Date  Debut Week Viewership   Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1  December 18, 2023  572 million minutes   Secret Invasion  June 21, 2023  461 million minutes   She-Hulk: Attorney at Law  August 18, 2022  Did not debut in Top 10   Ms. Marvel  June 8, 2022  249 million minutes   Moon Knight  March 30, 2022  418 million minutes   Hawkeye  November 24, 2021  853 million minutes   



While that chart doesn&#39;t include the new release Echo, varies depending on the number of episodes available during debut week, and is sometimes limited by shows premiering midweek, this is nevertheless an impressive result. Given the show&#39;s success, it seems entirely likely that Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2 is in the cards. While the show has not yet been renewed, its numbers will likely have had to crash spectacularly in the following weeks for that result to not inspire producers&#39; confidence in its future.
