## Literature Review

NBC’s popular Night Court reboot finds its replacement for clerk Neil, following the sudden departure of original cast member Kapil Talwalkar.




The Night Court reboot has found its Neil replacement, following the exit of original cast member Kapil Talwalkar. Best known for his role as Tobin Batra in the musical dramedy Zoey&#39;s Extraordinary Playlist, Talwalkar portrayed Neil in the debut season of NBC&#39;s Night Court reboot. Citing a change in the show&#39;s creative direction, it was announced that the actor was exiting the sitcom before season 2&#39;s debut. It was explained that Neil moved to Lake Tahoe with his girlfriend, but that he still kept in touch with Abby (Melissa Rauch).




Now, following Talwalkar&#39;s departure from Night Court season 2, it&#39;s been confirmed by Variety that Nyambi Nyambi will fill his role. The actor, known for his role as the investigator Jay DiPersia in The Good Fight, already made his debut in the January 16 episode as Wyatt Shaw. Nyambi will be upgraded to regular cast member status in the February 6 episode, playing the part of the court clerk previously occupied by Talwalkar&#39;s Neil.


 What To Know About Night Court&#39;s New Cast Member Nyambi Nyambi 
          

Nyambi has a list of familiar credits to his name. In addition to his performance as Jay in The Good Fight, the actor has appeared in Mike &amp; Molly, Blindspot, and the comic book adaptation Titans as Freedom Beast. Along with being an accomplished stage actor, Nyambi also voiced Martian Manhunter in the animated movies The Death of Superman and Reign of Superman.




As for his Night Court character in season 2, Wyatt Shaw, the new court clerk, debuted in the episode &#34;Just the Fax, Dan.&#34; In his first appearance, it&#39;s revealed that Wyatt has worked several jobs and even recognized Olivia (India de Beaufort) from one of them. His interactions with the rest of the group were a mixed bag. As was typical of Dan Fielding (John Larroquette), he warned Wyatt about getting stuck in the dead-end job. Gurgs (Lacretta) was somewhat more welcoming, though suspicious that Wyatt might be the one responsible for the hack. Abby tried her best to be cheerful, however.

                  When The Night Court Season 2 Finale Is &amp; How Many Episodes Are Left   Both fans of the original sitcom and revival newcomers alike are wondering when the Night Court season 2 finale is — and how many episodes remain.   

Wyatt is described as quick-witted and sarcastic. A recently divorced father, he&#39;s overprotective of his two young girls and wants to make sure they have a better life than he did. While the latest update seems dramatic, cast changes were the norm for the original Night Court, which was known during its run for sudden changes to the ensemble. The reboot&#39;s showrunner Dan Rubin, along with the rest of the writing team, have several more episodes to examine Nyambi&#39;s character further to see how he fits in.




 



Night Court season 2 airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC and streams the next day on Peacock.
