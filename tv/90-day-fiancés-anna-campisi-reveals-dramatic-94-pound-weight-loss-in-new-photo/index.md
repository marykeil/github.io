## Literature Review
After undergoing weight loss surgery in April 2022, 90 Day Fiancé’s Anna Campisi is now showing off her impressive physical transformation.




Anna-Marie Campisi from 90 Day Fiancé season 7 unveils her 8-month weight-loss transformation in a new picture. The mom of four never let her physique stop her from achieving anything. However, she did gain some weight over the years, which recently inspired her to focus on her health and undergo gastric sleeve surgery to kickstart her new fitness journey. In April 2023, the 90 Day Fiancé alum underwent weight-loss procedure in Turkey. She shared a video of her first postoperative walk with her followers, letting them know she was fine.




Recently, Anna shared the results of the gastric sleeve surgery and revealed that she had lost close to 100 pounds. The reality star posted a full-body picture showing she has become half her size. She wrote, “I’ve lost 94 pounds since April 15,” revealing that this is her 8-month transformation.


 

In the photo, Anna wore a slim-fit top that exaggerated her new physique and curves. She also sported stretchable jeans, showing that she had toned her legs. Anna added, “I started at 284 and I am at 190,” adding that she needs to lose “30-50 pounds” more to reach her goal weight.

 90 Day Fiancé Fans React To Anna’s Weight Loss Transformation 
          




Fans were happy for Anna and her physical transformation. A social media user commented, “omg girl. You look amazing so proud of you! You did a GREAT job.” The user claimed it was praiseworthy for Anna to lose weight despite numerous responsibilities. Another social media user shared that Anna looked amazing and happier. The user added, “your glowing,” letting the 90 Day Fiancé season 7 star know she looks younger than ever. Co-stars also shared their love for Anna. While David Toborowsky wrote, “congratulations,” Laura Jallali commented, “you go girl !!!! You look absolutely amazing Anna.”

Anna’s weight-loss transformation is impressive and inspiring for a few reasons. The former reality TV star is in her 40s. She also recently welcomed her son, Gokhan John, who’s still a baby. It must’ve been hard for Anna to take time out to focus on herself. Therefore, it’s praiseworthy that she wasn’t just able to get surgery but also progressed significantly in less than a year. Anna is only 30 pounds away from her goal and may just achieve it before April 2024.




Anna isn’t the only 90 Day Fiancé franchise cast member to transform herself with weight loss surgery. Stars like Winter Everett, Tiffany Franco, Angela Deem, and others have undergone similar procedures to help them kickstart their fitness journeys. They have all lost over 90 pounds and are living their best lives nowadays. Hopefully, Anna can maintain her health now that she has dropped so much weight and improved her lifestyle. The former 90 Day Fiancé star should be able to reach her goal soon and enjoy a long life with her family and husband, Mursel Mistanoglu.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
