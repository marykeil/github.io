# Why Some Fans Were Glad Below Deck Mediterranean Season 7 Ended


## SUMMARY 



  Below Deck Med Season 7 received negative feedback from fans for its unlikable cast and lack of interesting storylines.   The interior crew, particularly chief stew Natasha Webb and stews Natalya Scudder and Kyle Viljoen, did not impress viewers.   While the season had some redeeming qualities such as the beautiful scenery of Malta and the crew&#39;s ability to separate work and personal lives, it was still considered a disappointment overall.

## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean season 7 aired in 2022, but many fans were eager for it to end after lackluster casting and storylines took over.




Some Below Deck Mediterranean fans were excited for season 7 to end, and they were sounding off on Reddit. From the unlikable cast to a lack of interesting storylines, the season did not live up to its many others. Though Captain Sandy Yawn was better received, she was not enough to save Below Deck Med from sinking. As Below Deck Med season 8&#39;s cast continues to set sail, it&#39;s time to revisit the poorly received previous season.




Below Deck Med Season 7 continued to deliver high drama and over-the-top yachting adventures as Captain Sandy Yawn, Chief Stewardess Malia White, and their ever-changing crew navigated the world of charter yachting in the Greek islands. The season was filled with many hookups, breakups, and drama, but missed the mark with seasoned fans.


 Why Fans Slammed Below Deck Med Season 7 
          

In a Reddit discussion started by u/teanailpolish on the Below Deck Med season 7 finale, most fans were ready for it to end rather than wanting to see more of the cast. One user said it was &#34;such a &#39;meh&#39; season overall,&#34; and another said, &#34;It&#39;s a truly horrendous season when I think Sandy was the least grating cast member.&#34; Unlike previous Below Deck Med seasons when Ben Robinson was the chef extraordinaire who always knew how to bring the drama, and chief stewardess Hannah Ferrier always made for entertaining TV, this season&#39;s cast was underwhelming.






 Below Deck Med Season 7&#39;s Cast Was Disappointing 
          

The interior crew, with chief stew Natasha Webb and stews Natalya Scudder and Kyle Viljoen, did not impress. While fans liked seeing a familiar face with deckhand Mzi Dempers, the rest of the exterior crew also grated on some fans&#39; nerves. One Redditor said, &#34;The deck crew was honestly unmemorable in the grand scheme of things.&#34; Fans love the personal drama on each Below Deck Med season, but Natasha&#39;s toxic relationship with chef Dave White and her boyfriend back home, as well as Natalya&#39;s connection with Storm Smith, was not what many wanted to see.

From the Below Deck Mediterranean season 7 trailer, there were high hopes for the crew on motoryacht Home. Crew members were getting fired, with some quitting and no shortage of interesting charter guests. Though Kyle made a connection with a charter guest named Frank Fay that fans loved watching, his little jabs at Natalya throughout the charter season turned many viewers against him. Below Deck Mediterranean season 7 was unwatchable for some viewers, but others found it to be an excellent addition to the franchise.




The scenery of Malta on Below Deck Med never disappoints, and Natasha certainly knows how to decorate for a theme. It was appreciated that the crew could somewhat separate their work and personal lives as they went through the charters without many guest complaints. The season hit all the show&#39;s staples, from boatmances between the crew and drunken fights aboard the yacht to cliques and rivalries that brought the drama. Natasha did not attend the reunion because she had gotten so much backlash this season. While Below Deck Med season 7 wasn&#39;t the best, it was still mildly entertaining.
