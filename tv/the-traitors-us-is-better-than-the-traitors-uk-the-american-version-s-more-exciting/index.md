## Literature Review
The Traitors US &amp; The Traitors UK run simultaneously throughout their seasons, but the shows are somewhat different and one is better than the other.




The Traitors US season 2 is one of the most highly anticipated series of 2024, and with the US and UK versions of the series premiering throughout January, many are curious about which version of the show is better. While both series have similar premises, there are some marked differences between The Traitors US and The Traitors UK. Though the game itself is the same, the changes made between The Traitors UK and The Traitors US  make the shows play out tremendously differently. For the US version, the format changes make the series more accessible and provide a different outlet for viewers to watch their favorite reality TV stars.




The Traitors groups nearly two dozen contestants who are hoping to win a continually growing prize fund as they work to hunt down the traitors in the group. The traitors themselves, chosen by the host of the series, are tasked with sabotaging the game and taking faithful players out in the cover of night. While The Traitors cast comes together to banish one of their own each night, the traitors work diligently to clear their names and throw suspicion onto the other players. While The Traitors UK is similar, The Traitors US is the more exciting version of the series.

 The Traitors US Features Reality TV Personalities 
          




While The Traitors UK features a large group of contestants from across the country to play the game, The Traitors US has gone a slightly different route when it comes to the cast. The Traitors US incorporates contestants from other reality TV franchises to fill in their cast. While the first season of the series included contestants from reality TV and civilians, The Traitors US season 2 will only feature reality TV personalities. The US version of the series allows viewers to see people they already know compete in a new style of game, which gives it an interesting edge over the UK version in casting.



 The Traitors US Explores Fresh &amp; Complex Social Dynamics 
          

Although the UK version of The Traitors explores the dynamics between several different social demographics, the US version offers a far more complex series of dynamics and social spheres. The Traitors US features a cast that pulls reality TV stars from several different franchises, some of whom have backgrounds with one another, which allows for far more interesting social dynamics. The series creates complicated webs of interactions between reality TV stars who would never interact otherwise, allowing for relationships to form between unlikely co-stars. The dynamics between the cast mates sometimes create a larger sense of drama, which is great for The Traitors US.






 The Traitors US Is Hosted By Alan Cumming 

 

The Traitors US has a different host than any other series in the franchise, as each of the shows has its own personal identity. While The Traitors UK is hosted by UK presenter and celebrity Claudia Winkleman, The Traitors US has a very different host which creates a completely different feeling for the series. The Traitors US is hosted by notable actor Alan Cumming, who is well-known for his film roles. While Alan isnâ€™t necessarily a part of the competition, his commentary and continued presence on the series helps The Traitors US to stand out.
