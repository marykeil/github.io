  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Kevin and Veronica&rsquo;s relationship started as an accidental proposal, and their marriage began on shaky grounds.
Kevin kept the secret of his previous marriage from Veronica for a long time, which was a major betrayal.
Veronica failed to notice that Kevin couldn&rsquo;t read, showing a lack of attention to his needs.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Kevin and Veronica are Shameless&rsquo; best couple, but fans seem to forget that they definitely aren&rsquo;t without their fair share of flaws.</p>
<p>Shameless primarily focuses on the dysfunctional family of Frank Gallagher, but some of the most entertaining and enjoyable stars have always been the Kevin and Veronica Shameless coupling. The Gallaghers try and fail to find love on countless occasions and seem incapable of maintaining a serious relationship for longer than a few weeks. However, Kev and V stuck with each other through thick and thin, and they have always been a practically perfect couple.
Kevin might be one of the kindest people on Shameless. Veronica loves him more than anything. This leads to an adventurous romantic life, and while they don&rsquo;t get together naturally, they seem to be the most stable and committed couple on Shameless. However, while Kevin and Veronica&rsquo;s problems aren&rsquo;t as noticeable as Fiona&rsquo;s, Frank&rsquo;s, Ian&rsquo;s, or Lip&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s understandable that their flaws remain unrecognized in their supposedly pristine relationship. But, problems are there, even if they might be bubbling under the surface.</p>
<p>Shameless: 20 Things That Don&rsquo;t Make Sense About Lip&rsquo;s Relationships
Lip Gallagher always seems to be dating someone on Shameless, but most of his relationships are filled with issues and don&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>18  Kevin Didn&rsquo;t Mean To Propose
The Start Of Their Relationship Was An Accident</p>
<p>In the episode &ldquo;Casey Casden,&rdquo; when a woman at the Alibi refused to stop flirting with Kevin, Kevin told her he was getting married in a desperate attempt to get her to leave him alone. He didn&rsquo;t know that Frank was listening and might take his words seriously, and he didn&rsquo;t expect Frank to announce the &ldquo;happy news&rdquo; to the entire bar. To make matters worse, Veronica&rsquo;s mother Carol was at the Alibi that day, so she heard Frank&rsquo;s proclamation and rejoiced over the news of her daughter&rsquo;s impending engagement.
Veronica was thrilled by the idea of Kevin proposing, as well. Kevin then spent a lot of time drinking and trying to figure out how to get out of this, but then he realized how much Veronica liked him and decided, instead of just explaining the misunderstanding, to pop the question. It wasn&rsquo;t the heartfelt, romantic proposal Veronica deserved, and it wasn&rsquo;t how the Kevin and Veronica Shameless marriage should have started.</p>
<p>17  Kevin Was Secretly Married
Kevin&rsquo;s Biggest Secret He Withheld From Veronica</p>
<p>When the Gallaghers threw a party to celebrate Kevin and Veronica&rsquo;s engagement, Fiona noticed that Kevin didn&rsquo;t seem to share Veronica&rsquo;s excitement and realized he looked slightly withdrawn and uncomfortable. When she pressed him for an explanation, Kevin admitted that his engagement might get a bit complicated because he was already secretly married.
Viewers weren&rsquo;t told how long the Kevin and Veronica Shameless relationship had been going on before the show started, but, based on how close Kev and V were, it seemed like they&rsquo;d been together for a significant period. It&rsquo;s terrible that Kevin lied to her about being married for so long and that he didn&rsquo;t tell Veronica the truth before asking her to be his wife.</p>
<p>16  Veronica Failed To Notice That Kevin Couldn&rsquo;t Read
Veronica Wasn&rsquo;t Paying   Attention To Kevin&rsquo;s Needs</p>
<p>Viewers eventually learned that Kevin lied to Veronica throughout their relationship about his secret wife, but, outside of that, they were led to assume that the couple knew everything there was to know about each other. The Kevin and Veronica Shameless relationship seemed incredibly close and open, appearing to spend the majority of every day by each other&rsquo;s side.
Then, in season 2, Veronica questioned Kevin about his various recent unexplained absences and finds out that he&rsquo;d been taking reading classes in secret for weeks. Somehow, even though she spent every day with him, she never noticed that Kevin wasn&rsquo;t even able to read. For some reason, Kevin was afraid to tell V the truth, and she didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to him to recognize it herself.</p>
<p>15  Veronica Encouraged Kevin To Sleep With Her Mother
Veronica Made A Hugely Questionable Decision With Kevin</p>
<p>Kev and Veronica spent most of Shameless season 4 trying to have a child and start a family together, and, after their efforts continuously failed, they went to a doctor to try to figure out why. The couple found out that Veronica&rsquo;s Pelvic Inflammatory Disease gave her a less than 1% chance of conceiving, so they tried to figure out a way to still have a child who would share their DNA.
Veronica&rsquo;s solution to their issue was for Kevin to have a baby with her mother, Carol. The whole storyline was pretty uncomfortable in the classic Shameless way. There are chances for the couple to have a baby in other ways, but the fact that Veronica&rsquo;s solution included having her mother get pregnant via Kevin was awkward, as that made the child her sister.</p>
<p>14  They Let Carol Take Kevin&rsquo;s Son
Kevin Gave Up His Child</p>
<p>Shortly after Carol revealed that she was pregnant with Kevin&rsquo;s child, a miracle happened, and Veronica beat the odds to become pregnant herself. She and Kevin were shocked to find out they&rsquo;d be having twins, which were originally triplets before the twins absorbed one of the babies in the womb. Veronica started to worry about how they could take care of so many new kids at once.
When Carol gave birth to Dominic Fisher-Ball, she decided she was no longer willing to hand him over to Veronica. Kevin had always dreamed of having a large family and was thrilled by the idea of having a son, but Veronica convinced him to just let Carol take Dominic away. No compromise was made, and Kevin was left without the son he desperately wanted. While it made sense financially, it was something that possibly caused Kevin a lot of inner pain.</p>
<p>13  Kevin&rsquo;s Illegal Side Jobs
Kevin Breaks The Law All The Time</p>
<p>Despite their initial refusal to become anything like their father, the Gallagher kids have all adopted Frank&rsquo;s street smarts and become willing to bend the law or use others to get what they want. It seems like they&rsquo;re not the only mischievous people in the South Side, though, because Kevin is also always breaking the law to get ahead.
Kevin has a solid and steady job at the Alibi, but he frequently takes on additional part-time jobs which could land him behind bars. He&rsquo;s sold illegal substances in an ice cream truck, he&rsquo;s allowed Mickey to rent his wife and her friends in the Alibi, and he&rsquo;s done a variety of other questionable things. Kevin&rsquo;s motives are often pure, but each of these side jobs could have taken him away from his loved ones for years.</p>
<p>12  They Broke Up After Starting A Family
The Timing Of Their Original Split Was Bad</p>
<p>Even though Kevin and Veronica spent years trying to start a family, when the twins were finally born, they realized they may not have been as ready to be parents as they thought. Kevin constantly worried about being a negative influence on them, and his obsession with trying to be the perfect dad led to him accidentally neglecting Veronica and her needs.
Veronica practically begged for Kevin to give her some attention, and, when he repeatedly failed to do so, she briefly put an end to their relationship. It was the first real fight Kev and V ever had with each other, and Veronica&rsquo;s response to it was to just call it quits and take a break from her family instead of trying to work things out between the two new parents.</p>
<p>Shameless: 10 Characters Who Are Actually Worse Than Frank
Frank&rsquo;s actions damaged the Gallaghers beyond repair, but there were plenty of other characters on the show who were much worse than he was.</p>
<p>11  Kevin Was Quick To Replace His Family
Kevin Moved On Quickly From Veronica</p>
<p>Even though Veronica was the one who asked for a break, she found herself unable to be with anyone other than Kevin. She had expressed a desire for them to both see other people, but, when she was given that opportunity, V realized she only wanted to be with the father of her children. Kevin didn&rsquo;t have quite as much difficulty temporarily moving on from his supposed soulmate.
He struggled to be intimate with V for weeks because he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about their twins, but, when Veronica broke up with him, Kevin suddenly felt comfortable jumping back into the lifestyle and ended up with plenty of Lip&rsquo;s college classmates. Veronica forgave him for this far too quickly. This showed how much she loved him, but his actions showed that he might have considered her replaceable.</p>
<p>10  Veronica Married Svetlana
Veronica Broke Laws Because Of The Reason For The Marriage</p>
<p>When problems started popping up in Kevin and Veronica&rsquo;s formerly stable relationship, the master manipulator, Svetlana, recognized that they were both emotionally vulnerable and started taking advantage of them. She ended up with both Kev and V during their separation period, and Veronica was so happy to finally receive some attention that she started developing confusing but real feelings for Svetlana.
When Svetlana was threatened with deportation, Veronica was so desperate to keep her around that she agreed to marry her. It was a bizarre decision, but it was no more surprising than Kevin&rsquo;s willingness to let it happen. While it was a nice thing to do, getting married to stop the deportation is also illegal, adding to the list of things that Kev and V did that could have gotten them in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>9  They Helped Throw Frank Off A Bridge
They Could Have Killed Frank When They Did This</p>
<p>Shameless is filled with characters who aren&rsquo;t afraid to throw a punch. Almost all the Gallaghers have gotten into fights over the years, but Kevin and Veronica are more lovers than fighters and seem to prefer solving their problems without fighting. That&rsquo;s why it was incredibly surprising that the couple joined the Gallagher kids and their friends in throwing Frank off a bridge into a freezing cold Chicago river.
When Frank intentionally ruined Fiona&rsquo;s wedding day due to a grudge he had against her would-be husband Sean, Fiona&rsquo;s loved ones shoved Frank into a trunk and then worked together to throw him off a bridge. Kevin and Veronica are usually the one that serves as the voice of reason, but, when they join in on this ridiculousness, they prove they&rsquo;re not without their dark side.</p>
<p>8  They Were Both Outsmarted By Svetlana
Svetlana Made Them Both Look Really Bad</p>
<p>Every couple needs to have one responsible member, but Kevin and Veronica almost ruined their future together because neither of them took the time to read important legal paperwork. Svetlana tricked them into signing documents she claimed were adoption papers so that she could legally become a third parent to Kev and V&rsquo;s twins. When the couple just mindlessly obeyed and neglected to read what they were signing, they relinquished ownership of the Alibi to Svetlana.
Kevin&rsquo;s empty-headedness and Veronica&rsquo;s trusting nature typically help make them Shameless&rsquo; most endearing characters, but it&rsquo;s a problem that they both get outsmarted so easily. It seemed that Fiona was the only one who realized that Svetlana was a con artist, and she tried to warn Kev and V, but they were blinded by love and never saw this coming, betraying their normal level-headedness.</p>
<p>7  Veronica Doesn&rsquo;t Care As Much About The Alibi
Veronica Cared Little About Their Business&rsquo; Reputation</p>
<p>When The Alibi Room earned a reputation for being unsafe for women, Kevin took it upon himself to make his bar a more female-friendly environment. He taught his regular patrons how to behave properly, took down some inappropriate signs, and did everything he could to make the Alibi a more inviting place. Veronica didn&rsquo;t do anything to help Kevin, and she subtly mocked him when he was invited to speak at a &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Equality and Empowerment March.&rdquo;
She should be as invested in Alibi&rsquo;s future and reputation as Kevin is, but Veronica often just doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about the place they own together. It also seems weird that Kevin was more interested in protecting the women who entered their establishment than Veronica was. This entire storyline felt a little out of place.</p>
<p>6  They Tried To Sneak Two Kids Into School For The Price Of One
They Cheated The System And Taught Their Kids To Lie</p>
<p>When Kevin and Veronica realized that Amy and Jemma were old enough to enroll in preschool, they failed to anticipate how much it would cost to give their twins a decent education. They had to turn down several schools after discovering the steep cost of tuition, and they eventually decided that they could only really afford to pay for one daughter to attend preschool.
The couple then tried to sneak two girls into school for the price of one by dressing them identically and telling them to never be seen together. Every day, one of their daughters hid in a closet to help out with their parents&rsquo; scheme. Kevin and Veronica are lucky the school didn&rsquo;t contact the authorities when a fire alarm eventually foiled their plan. This was not only illegal but irresponsible and sees Kev and V teaching their kids how to get around the system.</p>
<p>5  They Stopped Being There For Fiona
Kevin And Veronica Turned Their Back On Fiona</p>
<p>Throughout the first several seasons of Shameless, Kevin and Veronica were there for Fiona whenever she needed a friend or shoulder to cry on. They got to witness firsthand how horrible of a parent Frank could be and watched as Fiona tried to raise a house full of kids all on her own, so they did everything they could to try to help Fiona out whenever possible.
When Veronica became obsessed with Svetlana, however, she turned on Fiona, and their relationship never fully recovered. This is because Fiona tried to warn her that her new love was a con artist, but Veronica refused to believe it. Fiona and V rarely interacted after that, and the sudden lack of moral support from her best friend was likely a major factor in Fiona&rsquo;s downward spiral during Shameless&rsquo; eighth and ninth seasons. This also ended up biting Kev and V, as their lack of trust in Fiona cost them their business.</p>
<p>4  Kev &amp; Veronica Disagreed Badly Over Expanding The Family
They Didn&rsquo;t Agree On Future Kids</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been clear from the start of Shameless that Kevin Ball has always wanted a large family. He convinced Veronica to foster two different kids with him, he was thrilled when he found out she was having twins even though he knew they weren&rsquo;t financially ready, and he was devastated when Carol decided to keep their son. Veronica, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t share her partner&rsquo;s vision of a house filled with baby balls.
When Kevin begged her to have another baby with him in season 9, Veronica hesitantly agreed and got his hopes up. A few days later, however, she changed her mind and forced Kevin to get a vasectomy, proving that they weren&rsquo;t on the same page about expanding their family. This was something that could have destroyed their relationship because it&rsquo;s a major thing to disagree on, and they don&rsquo;t have a resolution, since Kev never truly agreed to the vasectomy.</p>
<p>3  They Don&rsquo;t Communicate About Their Finances
Both Of Them Tried To Do It On Their Own</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s occasionally surprising that Kevin and Veronica get along so well, as, for a long-term couple, they failed to run many major decisions by each other before making them individually. Their brief separation and Veronica&rsquo;s marriage to Svetlana proved they cannot discuss important emotional matters together, but their failure to talk about finances with each other might be even more concerning.
Kevin took ownership of the Alibi without really discussing it with Veronica first even though he needed her help in running it. He&rsquo;s always buying stuff for the business without consulting V, and Veronica once spent hundreds of dollars on steaks for an Alibi surf n&rsquo; turf night without seeing if Kevin thought it&rsquo;d be a good idea first. It is a wonder Kev and V have any money at all.</p>
<p>2  They Were Bad Foster Parents
Kevin And Veronica Didn&rsquo;t Do Right With Their Foster Kids</p>
<p>Even though Kevin and Veronica seemed like fun and mostly adequate parents to their twin daughters, they were not good at trying to raise their two foster children. Kevin&rsquo;s desire to have kids inspired him and Veronica to take in Ethel, a teenage mother who recently escaped from a marriage to a 65-year-old man. Kevin truly cared for her despite her bizarre behavior and abnormal level of maturity for her age, but he and Veronica failed to stop her from running away with a teenage father she&rsquo;d just met.
The couple tried again years later when they took in young immigrant Santiago, but that didn&rsquo;t work out, either. Santiago didn&rsquo;t speak English outside of knowing the words to the National Anthem, and Kevin&rsquo;s fondness for him was solely based on Santiago&rsquo;s beautiful voice and pitching ability. Kevin wanted a big family, but he wasn&rsquo;t equipped to raise one, making him a little more like Frank than he would want to believe.</p>
<p>1  Kevin And V Enable Frank
They Keep Frank On His Path Of Destruction</p>
<p>As the Gallagher family&rsquo;s next-door neighbors, Kev and V have seen just how many problems Frank&rsquo;s drinking creates for his kids. They know that Frank has spent more time at the Alibi than with his children, but Kevin and Veronica haven&rsquo;t done anything to try to change that. The couple often lets Frank put his drinks on a tab which they know he&rsquo;ll never pay, and they give him far too much to drink.
It&rsquo;s perfectly legal to refuse to serve a customer, and, if Kev and V turned Frank away from the Alibi, he might have changed his ways and become a better father and man. There is also a chance that Frank could have found a new place to drink, and they are not his keeper. However, they saw what was happening to his family and never did anything to help Frank. When it comes to Kevin and Veronica, Shameless&rsquo; &ldquo;perfect couple&rdquo; were anything but when people looked deeper into their actions.
