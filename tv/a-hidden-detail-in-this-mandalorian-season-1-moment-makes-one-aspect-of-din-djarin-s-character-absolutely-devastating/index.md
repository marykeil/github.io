## Literature Review

One hidden Star Wars detail in this key moment from The Mandalorian season 1 reveals the truth behind a devastating element of Din Djarin&#39;s character.




Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin keeps many of his emotions hidden away within his helmet, but there&#39;s one secret Star Wars detail in The Mandalorian season 1 that reveals an utterly devastating aspect of his character. While Din may not be able to show all his feelings on his face, Pascal and the other Din Djarin actors have been able to find other ways of expressing his emotions through his voice, body language, and more. This, however, doesn&#39;t always reveal what Din&#39;s expression looks like under the helmet, and there&#39;s one moment from season 1 that connects back to Din&#39;s childhood.




Not much of Din Djarin&#39;s backstory has been told in The Mandalorian outside of brief flashbacks in season 1, but those are enough to prove how tragic Din&#39;s early life was. Despite this, Din has never been one to display any sense of fear; Djarin didn&#39;t even flinch as he let himself be swallowed whole by a krayt dragon in The Mandalorian season 2 premiere. As it turns out, Din does have a secret way of expressing his fear, and one hidden detail from The Mandalorian season 1 reveals it in one of the story&#39;s more important moments.

                  The Mandalorian Season 4 Updates: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know   After The Mandalorian season 3’s conclusion in 2023, the story of The Mandalorian season 4 is shaping up to be one of the show’s biggest yet.   


 Din Djarin  d His Eyes During The Mudhorn Fight 
          




Din&#39;s fight against the mudhorn in The Mandalorian season 1, episode 2 is hard to watch with how badly Mando is beaten down. Before Grogu uses the Force to save him, Din has to come to terms with the reality of his small chance of survival. He does this when he reaches for his vibroblade in a last-ditch effort, and Joe Schreiber&#39;s Star Wars: The Mandalorian Junior Novel reveals what that moment was like for Din.


Reaching down, Mando drew his knife. He held it in front of him with both hands. Maybe there was a vulnerable spot on the thing&#39;s neck, a blood vessel that he could slash or puncture, and he might stand a chance. If not, then at least he could leave this creature with a scar, something to remember him by. He closed his eyes and waited.


Easily the most heartbreaking detail is Din closing his eyes as he awaits what he believes to be his inevitable death. This is something The Mandalorian itself could never show due to Din&#39;s helmet hiding his face, but it&#39;s more than a way of Din resigning himself to his fate. Given other moments in The Mandalorian beyond this, it&#39;s a tell of one of Din&#39;s most heartbreaking emotions.






 Din  s His Eyes When He&#39;s Afraid 
          

Din closing his eyes in fear is no new thing in The Mandalorian. During the flashbacks of the attack on Din&#39;s homeworld of Aq Vetina, Din&#39;s seen closing his eyes when the B-2 battle droid is about to kill him. Later on, in the penultimate episode of The Mandalorian season 2, Din closes his eyes just before facing Valin Hess, preparing to be seen without his helmet for the first time since he was a child. Din even closes his eyes when Grogu touches his face in the season 2 finale, as if he&#39;s afraid of having to let Grogu go.



Din also says &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid&#34; to Grogu after closing his eyes, which shows he may have been saying it just as much for himself as he was for Grogu.







This small detail speaks volumes about Din Djarin&#39;s character, regardless of the fact it cannot always be seen. It shows that even as one of the galaxy&#39;s greatest warriors, Din still struggles with fear, particularly when it comes to his traumatizing past and his loved ones. For as ruthless as The Mandalorian has proven him to be, Din is still one of the galaxy&#39;s most compassionate people, and this aspect of his character proves just how human he is underneath all his beskar.
