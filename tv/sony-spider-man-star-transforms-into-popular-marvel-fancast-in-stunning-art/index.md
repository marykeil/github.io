# Sony Spider-Man Star Transforms Into Popular Marvel Fancast In Stunning Art


## SUMMARY 



  Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are imagined as Black Cat and Spider-Man in a fan edit.   The likelihood of Powell playing Spider-Man in the MCU is low due to Tom Holland&#39;s role, but he could potentially portray important heroes like Cyclops or Johnny Storm.   Sweeney, known for her dramatic acting, could excel in roles such as Emma Frost or Rogue, and it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if both actors teamed up in a future Marvel movie based on their skills and popularity.

## Literature Review

Madame Web&#39;s Sydney Sweeney becomes Black Cat opposite her Anyone but You co-star Glen Powell as Spider-Man in striking Marvel fan art.




Madame Web star Sydney Sweeney becomes Black Cat with Glen Powell as Spider-Man in new Marvel fan edit. Sweeney is already set to be part of the Spider-Man live-action universe of adaptations, with the actress being part of Madame Web&#39;s impressive cast. Sweeney plays Julia Carpenter, aka Spider-Woman, in Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe&#39;s Madame Web. However, new stunning fan art imagines the character as another Marvel character in a possible future Marvel film from across the multiverse.




On Instagram, @venomhology shared an incredible edit of Anyone but You co-stars Sweeney and Powell as Black Cat and Spider-Man.


 

The duo&#39;s recent movie is an R-rated rom-com that thrives on the tension between its leads. With that premise, the fan art imagining Powell as Spider-Man and Sweeney as Black Cat is spot on, as it fits with the theme of their movie, and the stars would be great picks for their respective superhero roles in the Marvel fan edit.

 Who Glen Powell &amp; Sydney Sweeney Could Play In The MCU 
Spider-Man &amp; Black Cat Might Be Out Of The Cards
          




With Tom Holland firmly set to continue in the MCU for the foreseeable future, with Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 4 already lined up, Powell is unlikely to play Spider-Man in the MCU. As Sweeney is already a Spider-Man-related hero in Madame Web, the actress is unlikely to fulfill the fan demand to see her portray Felicia Hardy, aka Black Cat, in the MCU. However, that does not mean that the actors have no future at Marvel Studios.

With the MCU&#39;s version of the X-Men set to debut in the future, Powell could portray one of the most important mutants from Marvel Comics. The actor is a popular name to play Cyclops in the MCU, with Powell possessing the acting ability to do right by the X-Men&#39;s leader. Powell also showed in Top Gun: Maverick that he has the right attitude to play Johnny Storm in Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four or Richard Rider, aka Nova, in the hero&#39;s reported Disney&#43; series.

Sweeney has shown her dramatic chops in Euphoria and other projects, which could lead to some interesting roles for her in the MCU. The actress could do great as Emma Frost, nailing the complexity and lethal attitude the character&#39;s known for. That role could also see her team up again with Powell if he gets cast as Cyclops, as the two characters are romantically linked in the comics. Sweeney&#39;s possible MCU characters could also include names such as Rogue, Betsy Braddock, and more. Based on their acting skills and popularity, it would be no surprise if Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney teamed up in a Marvel movie in the future.
