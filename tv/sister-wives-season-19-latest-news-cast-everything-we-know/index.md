## Literature Review
Even though there are no sister wives in the Brown family anymore, reports suggest that the Sister Wives will return with a more dramatic season 19. 




It seems that viewers won’t have to wait long for Sister Wives season 19. The polygamous family-based show has always been very entertaining. However, Sister Wives season 18 was probably the wildest one yet. Over the second half of 2023, fans watched the Brown family break apart as Janelle Brown contemplated her relationship with Kody Brown. At the same time, Meri Brown also decided to move out and debated with Kody about getting her a fair share of Coyote Pass land. When Kody Brown and Robyn Brown lost the other three wives, they embraced their new monogamous lifestyles.




Sister Wives Tell All episodes will probably be the most shocking parts of season 18. During the first part of the one-on-one, Kody revealed he had never had romantic feelings for Meri, Janelle, and Christine. Robyn was also devastated to learn about her husband’s true feelings about his first three wives and felt betrayed. She wasn’t ready for his bombshell reveal, and her reaction proved it all. Sister Wives’ season 18 finale almost made it seem like the show would be over for good, just like the Brown family. However, some details hint that the series will continue despite Kody’s three divorces.
