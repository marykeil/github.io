## Literature Review
Sister Wives’ Janelle Brown reveals why she didn’t approve of Christine’s relationship with David Woolley initially and how she feels about them now.




Sister Wives lead star Janelle Brown wasn’t a big fan of Christine Brown’s new relationship with David Woolley at first. The two ladies are most popular for being Kody Brown’s second and third wives. They married the polygamous man in the &#39;90s and stayed with him for nearly 30 years before calling it quits and moving on. Christine ended her relationship with Kody because she didn’t get the love she deserved. Similarly, Christine’s good friend Janelle broke up with Kody because of his numerous restrictions and terrible attitude. While the two ladies are no longer sister wives, they have formed an honest friendship across three decades.




Christine and Janelle are up front with each other and don’t like to hide their concerns. Recently, the two women appeared in an interview with ET to discuss Christine’s relationship with her new partner, David. Janelle said, “When you first told us you’d met this guy, I was like, ‘Oh no.’” The mom of six claimed she was worried that her good friend had found another man so soon after ending her 30-year marriage with Kody. She added, “I was like, ‘No, no, this is not a good idea. This is too fast.” Janelle concluded her statement by implying that she was glad that David proved her concerns wrong and became an excellent partner to Christine.

Janelle’s concerns were spot-on since Christine and David’s relationship evolved quickly. The 51-year-old Utah woman met her new partner online in late 2022. The two dated for a while before going public in February 2023. Christine posted a photo with David and wrote, “I finally found the love of my life, David.” By April 2023, the couple had already celebrated their engagement and proudly showed off their new milestone on social media. About six months later, they tied the knot in a heartwarming ceremony surrounded by their close family members and friends.


 

Hearing Janelle speak about her past concerns in the interview is great. Her honest opinions prove that she has a strong relationship with Christine that goes beyond their history with Kody. She wasn’t happy about her friend’s swift relationship but is now confident that David is the right man for her. Janelle’s excitement for Christine’s new life also makes sense because of their history. The two ladies have seen each other struggle to seek Kody’s love for the last 10 years. All they ever wanted was for their husband to acknowledge them and give them some time.




Christine’s quick relationship and marriage may also motivate Janelle to seek romance. While the latter enjoys third-wheeling her former sister wife and David, she would probably love having a new partner more. Janelle is an ambitious woman and an adventure seeker. She’d probably have a great time if she ever found someone who loves traveling with her. Unfortunately, the reality star is probably not ready yet to look for another man. Janelle has been focusing on her business ventures and other sponsorships. The Sister Wives star is busy living a carefree life with no husband for now.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.

Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States.
