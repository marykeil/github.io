# Netflix s Daredevil Gets  r To Being Made Official MCU Canon


## SUMMARY 



  The latest trailer for Marvel Studios&#39; Echo brings Netflix&#39;s Daredevil closer to MCU canon, with hints of the latter show&#39;s events being canon to the former.   The inclusion of footage from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil in the new trailer adds weight to the argument for the show&#39;s canonicity in the MCU.   The return of Kingpin and Daredevil in the trailer furthers the connection between Netflix&#39;s Daredevil and the upcoming Echo show, with the Netflix show&#39;s canonicity hopefully being confirmed one way or another when Echo releases on January 9, 2024.

## Literature Review
Promotional material for the latest MCU Disney&#43; show brings Netflix’s Daredevil ever closer to being confirmed as canon to the franchise.




The latest trailer for Marvel Studios&#39; Echo has brought Netflix&#39;s Daredevil show even closer to being confirmed as canon to the MCU. Since Charlie Cox appeared in 2019&#39;s Spider-Man: No Way Home, it has been frustratingly unclear whether the MCU version of the character is a continuation of the Man Without Fear featured in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil and Defenders timeline or a new variation. The same can be said for Wilson Fisk/Kingpin, whose Hawkeye appearance seemed somewhat disconnected from Daredevil, further throwing into doubt whether the Netflix show is canon to Marvel Studios’ MCU properties.




That said, Netflix&#39;s Daredevil has inched ever closer to being considered officially canon to the MCU with the latest trailer for Echo. Released on Marvel Entertainment&#39;s official YouTube channel, the most recent trailer for the Phase 5 show is titled &#34;Hurt&#34; and features extended footage of the return of both Kingpin and Daredevil.


 

What makes these appearances different though, is the footage used from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil in the trailer that seems to hint the events of that show are canon to Echo&#39;s story, thus making Daredevil one of the many shows that need to be watched before Echo.

                  Echo: Cast, Story Details, &amp; Everything We Know   Disney Plus has started development on Echo, an MCU spin-off of the Hawkeye series, featuring Native American martial artist Maya Lopez.    





 Why Netflix&#39;s Daredevil MCU Canon Status Is So Confusing 
          

Given the neverending debate about Daredevil&#39;s canonicity to the MCU, it is worth exploring why this topic is so confusing to begin with. The main reason for this stems from Marvel Studios&#39; unwillingness to officially confirm the Netflix shows as canon to the MCU. This was to be expected when the shows were released given their more mature tone that clashed with the more child-friendly nature of the MCU&#39;s shows and movies. That said, the canon status of Daredevil became more confusing when the character, and Kingpin, began appearing in MCU projects including Daredevil&#39;s upcoming solo MCU return in Daredevil: Born Again.

From Spider-Man: No Way Home to Hawkeye and She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Daredevil and Kingpin appeared, played by Charlie Cox and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio respectively. Given that the two actors reprised their roles from Netflix&#39;s Defenders universe, many wished for clarification on whether they were the same versions of the character or new variations for the MCU only with the same actors. Unfortunately, a direct answer to this query has never been provided by Marvel Studios, though Echo&#39;s most recent trailer is as close to confirmation that Daredevil is canon to the MCU as has ever been provided.
