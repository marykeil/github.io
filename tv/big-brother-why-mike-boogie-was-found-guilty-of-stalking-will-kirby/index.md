 Dr. Will Pressed Charges Against Mike Boogie 
          

The stalking allegations about Boogie started in September 2019, when Will was granted a restraining order against his Chilltown ally and close friend. This was shocking to many Big Brother fans and alumni as Boogie and Will had always been a dynamic duo to the fans. As the story goes, Boogie allegedly harassed Will to do other reality shows with him as a duo, but Will was more focused on his career as a doctor. According to the sentencing, after his arrest and release, Boogie will also need to make restitution to Will. Boogie must also complete 160 hours of community service and is banned from owning or possessing any firearms.

After competing on Big Brother 2, Boogie and Will returned to compete with other Big Brother alumni on Big Brother 7: All-Stars. However, this time around, it was Boogie&#39;s turn to win the show. These two were incredibly iconic houseguests in the Big Brother universe, and their friendship was long celebrated and cherished by longtime viewers.

This is an unfortunate ending to what was once such a vibrant friendship between two Big Brother legends. Things got out of control by the time Dr. Will felt forced to get a restraining order against Boogie. This results from Boogie&#39;s reckless and dangerous behavior toward a person who used to be a close friend.



Big Brother seasons are available for streaming on Paramount&#43;, Netflix, and Hulu.
