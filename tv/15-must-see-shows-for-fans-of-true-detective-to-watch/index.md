## Literature Review
If you enjoyed the dark and mysterious tone of HBO&#39;s True Detective, you will love these gritty shows you can watch or stream right now.




With the long wait for the fourth season coming to an end, fans have had to find shows like True Detective to fill that void in the meantime. The crime series began with a very talented group coming together both on and off screen from writer Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Joji Fukunaga to stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The show delivered a gripping crime story that was as much about the characters working the case as it was about the mystery itself. It was a unique show that gripped audiences, but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t some other shows like True Detective that capture the same vibe.
True Detective season 4 will continue the series&#39; trend of throwing A-listers into a totally new case with Oscar-winner Jodie Foster headlining this season. While other shows might not boast the same star power, there are great options out there for people who like a little bit of darkness in their entertainment. Not only are these shows as compelling and addictive as True Detective, but they also feature stories that will keep audiences hooked until the very end.

 Hannibal 

 Release Date   April 4, 2013    Cast   Hugh Dancy , Caroline Dhavernas , Aaron Abrams , Mads Mikkelsen , Laurence Fishburne , Scott Thompson    Seasons   3    




Hannibal is a little darker than True Detective in that one of its main characters is both a serial killer and a cannibal, but the shows have some striking similarities in tone. Much of the imagery and symbolism are similar in the first season, such as the usage of deer antlers. Hannibal follows criminal profiler Will Graham, who has a disturbing ability to empathize with psychopaths. It makes him a compelling character and an excellent asset to his profession. Of course, the titular Hannibal Lecter, played brilliantly by Mads Mikkelsen, steals the show and adds new aspects to the iconic villain. It is a show with a devoted following of fans still calling for Hannibal season 4 or even a movie.

 14  The Killing (2011-2014) 
Grim Detectives Investigate A Dark Conspiracy
        

Like True Detective, The Killing follows a pair of co-detectives who have fundamentally different styles of working, although one thing that makes for a change of pace from the HBO series is that The Killing has a female lead. It is a character-driven crime procedural. The first season revolves around solving the murder of a local girl that winds up being part of a convoluted political conspiracy. The show is a grim and dour crime series that is not always an easy watch. Yet like True Detective, the misery of these characters continues to draw viewers in as they explore deeper into this dark world.

In the process of trying to solve Tui&#39;s disappearance, Robin uncovers a strange women&#39;s camp and a drug lord, and she is forced to confront the traumatizing events of her past.

Season 1 centers around a young mother (played by Jessica Biel) who fatally stabs a man at a crowded beach, and the detective (Bill Pullman) who needs to figure out why she did it. What makes The Sinner an interesting story is that its mystery is not based on the &#34;how&#34; of what happened, but rather the &#34;why.&#34; The audience already knows that Biel&#39;s character is the murderer, but the real tension comes in trying to parse out what drove her to commit such an act in the first place.

As far as mystery series go, there may not be one more historically picked apart than Twin Peaks. The series, created by Mark Frost and idiosyncratic film director David Lynch, first premiered back in 1990 on the ABC network. It was immediately recognized as being one of the strangest yet most intriguing drama series on television at the time. Twin Peaks originally ran for two seasons.
