## Literature Review
The latest teaser trailer for Arcane season 2 suggests that one of the show&#39;s oldest League of Legends theories may become true after all.




Arcane season 2&#39;s teaser trailer set up the highly anticipated continuation of the show and, in the process, may have revealed that the show&#39;s oldest League of Legends theory is true. After a successful first season, Arcane is set to return in November 2024 and the small teaser already seemed to give a lot away. With the show being based around the popular video game, League of Legends, theories naturally arose regarding the characters and the show&#39;s future, with one theory looking more likely through the trailer. Not only does this further the excitement, but it also provides a huge update on Arcane season 2&#39;s potential story.




Although Arcane season 1&#39;s ending provided room for several storylines after its cliffhanger, the teaser points to one of the show&#39;s earliest events making a significant impact. The future of the series will undoubtedly revolve around Vi and Jinx since season 1 highlighted the deterioration of the sisters&#39; relationship. Having come face-to-face at the end of the season, Jinx&#39;s assault on Piltover will not only cause massive ramifications for the two, but it will likely pit them against one another going forward. While this appears to be the driving point of season 2&#39;s story, the teaser hints at a figure from their past also playing a huge role.


 


 Arcane Season 2’s Trailer All But Confirms Vander Becomes Warwick 
          




The teaser trailer for Arcane season 2 heavily indicates that Vander will become Warwick. After seemingly being killed off in season 1, Vander may well be back as Arcane season 2&#39;s trailer shows a preview of a potential new villain that appears to have connections to him. The teaser reveals a human supposedly being experimented on, with the hand and watch pointing at the character in question being Vander. Vander becoming Warwick in Arcane season 2 is a theory that has been speculated for a long time, and the subtle teases seem to suggest it may become a reality.

Warwick&#39;s backstory involves being transformed through a series of agonizing experiments, something that Arcane&#39;s teaser trailer certainly implies. There is no doubt that someone is being experimented on and given that Silco and his group were the last to see Vander&#39;s body, all signs point towards Vander being the one undergoing this transformation. It is still unclear from the trailers whether it is Silco, Signed, or another character conducting these experiments. However, given it appears to be someone affiliated with Silco, it makes all the more sense that Vander would be the victim of these experiments given his history with Silco.




                  Arcane Season 2 Wishlist: 10 Things We Want To See Next   Arcane season 2 needs to strike a balance between introducing new elements pulled from League of Legends and building on its own great story.    



 What Vander Being Warwick Means For Arcane Season 2 
          

Vander being Warwick sets up an even more tragic season 2 for Arcane. The first season already showcased plenty of tragedy, with Mylo and Clagger&#39;s death hitting hard, which was shortly followed by Vander&#39;s supposed demise. Vi and Jinx&#39;s fractured relationship was also a dark moment for Arcane and the return in November doesn&#39;t appear to be shifting that tone. Vander returning as Warwick would only add to Vi and Jinx&#39;s trauma, considering Vander was their father figure who essentially sacrificed his life by trying to save them. Having him back in the form of a bloodthirsty monster that likely wouldn&#39;t even recognize them makes the sisters&#39; dynamic even more heartbreaking.




With Piltover seemingly destroyed, much of Arcane season 2 will likely take place in Zaun. This is where Warwick tends to hunt, meaning Vander&#39;s transformed character will be a focal point in the story. Vi and Jinx finding out about what happened to Vander would be logical. Although there is a big chance it will further break them apart, it could repair their relationship by the two working together to stop Warwick and those who created him. Warwick will likely be one of several League of Legends characters to appear in Arcane season 2, but if he is revealed to be Vander, his role will be more significant than any new additions.

             Arcane Set in the League of Legends universe, Arcane focuses on sisters Violet and Powder (later Jinx) as they end up on opposite sides of a growing conflict between the wealthy utopia of Piltover and its dark undercity whose citizens wish to break away from their oppressors.
