## Literature Review
This fantastic cosplayer just showed how she assembles her Bo-Katan Kryze costume, and she could&#39;ve stepped right out of The Mandalorian season 3.




This awesome Bo-Katan Kryze cosplayer just showed how she assembles the ultimate The Mandalorian outfit, and it proves how intricate Mandalorian armor is. Bo-Katan first appeared in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV show as a member of the villainous Mandalorian terrorist group Death Watch. She was later revealed to be the wayward sister of the pacifist Duchess Satine Kryze. Bo-Katan&#39;s arc is an interesting one, as she isn&#39;t redeemed from her past as a member of Death Watch, but is shown to be a complex character who ultimately does care for her sister. Throughout The Mandalorian, she works with Din Djarin to unite the fractured Mandalorian sects, and this cosplay honors Bo-Katan&#39;s years of service to Mandalore.

Carly King recently posted a video of herself donning an excellent Bo-Katan cosplay. Consisting of pants, a top, boots, a holster, gloves, several layers of armor, her famous helmet, and even a jetpack, this intricate cosplay shows just how many details go into a Mandalorian&#39;s armor. Based on Bo-Katan&#39;s The Mandalorian season 3 costume, the cosplay leaves out no details. It even includes the mythosaur carving on her right fibreglass pauldron. This cosplay is so accurate that it looks like it came right out of the show.


 




Capturing the assembly on video makes this an even better tribute, as it shows some insight on what it may look like for Bo-Katan to do the same. Though many years have been spent following Mandalorians in both animation and live-action, the full assembly of a Mandalorian suit has never been seen before, aside from the assistance Boba Fett receives from his droids in The Book of Boba Fett. This video shows viewers what this day-to-day process is like for Bo-Katan while simultaneously proving how tough it can be to work such an intricate cosplay.


 What Happened To Bo-Katan At The End Of The Mandalorian Season 3? 
          

At the end of The Mandalorian season 3, Bo-Katan officially accepted the role of Mand&#39;alor, agreeing to take her place once again as ruler of the Mandalorians. This is significant because it marks a distinct progression in her character. When Bo-Katan was first introduced in The Mandalorian, it was after she had been tricked by Moff Gideon. This directly led to the Night of a Thousand Tears and the Purge of Mandalore. She had lost faith in herself as a result. Her choosing to accept the role of leader shows that she has finally forgiven herself and is willing to carry on her family&#39;s legacy as the ruler of Mandalore.




Another reason this is significant is because it signals her return to the old ways of the Mandalorians. Bo-Katan&#39;s sister, Duchess Satine Kryze, was a staunch pacifist. She refused to take sides in the Clone Wars, and she supported the banishing of all Mandalore&#39;s warriors to their moon of Concordia. Bo-Katan vehemently disagreed with this, and it pushed her to join Death Watch. After the Purge, however, she wandered around doing odd jobs, as she was cynical and had abandoned the Creed. Her taking on the role of leader to unite the clans once again in The Mandalorian, this time after having rightfully won the Darksaber, shows that she is returning to the Way.
