# 8 Harsh Realities Of Rewatching Castle 7 Years After The Show Ended


## SUMMARY 


 Castle&#39;s portrayal as a womanizer is an outdated and unattractive quality for a leading man, and his treatment of women was disrespectful and problematic. 
 The relationship between Castle and Beckett, both on and off-screen, had its issues, and their dynamic was not healthy or realistic for a good relationship. 
 The show had unrealistic plot points and cases and struggled to break away from its formulaic procedural format, which hindered its potential for more fulfilling storytelling.

## Literature Review
Though one of the most beloved crime procedurals of its time, rewatching Castle today reveals the issues and drama both on and off-screen. 




The beloved television series Castle may have kept fans coming back with the drama, but re-watching the show many years after its premiere unearths some problems with the narrative. Like many TV shows, the heart of the series is the interpersonal dynamics, and the ones portrayed in the story are of their time. For modern television shows, there are higher expectations for equality and respect in relationships, as well as limits on how unrealistic certain plot points can be.
Airing on ABC from 2009 to 2016, the show was a twist on the typical crime procedural and had a unique tonal blend of drama and comedy. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic played the two leads, Richard Castle and Kate Beckett, for the entirety of the show&#39;s eight seasons, and it was their relationship dynamic that kept viewers interested. Alongside this were the inventive criminal cases that shook up how people thought about procedurals, even though the show struggled to stray from its formulaic nature.
            

 Castle: 10 Best Episodes, According To IMDb 
Castle delighted fans all across the world thanks to the wonderful chemistry between Beckett and Rick. Here are the best episodes of the show, ranked!



 8  Castle’s Treatment Of Women 
Being a &#34;playboy&#34; is no longer an attractive quality
        

In television series of the early 2000s and some today, a common trope was to have a wealthy and popular leading man play the role of the womanizer. This way, when he eventually paired off the leading woman, it was supposed to be believed that he had changed and truly loved her. Also, his treatment of women as objects was supposed to be seen as mysterious and aspirational.
Unfortunately, at the start of the show, the writers made Castle into just this sort of man, which caused tension with Beckett. Even though they were the central couple of the show, Castle, time and again, showed Beckett that he didn&#39;t have respect for his romantic partners. Though he would grow to treat women better and mature as a character, this aspect of his personality is one that the show could have done without.





 7  Castle And Kate’s Relationship 
Both on and off-screen




The iconic will-they-won&#39;t-they relationship at the heart of Castle, dubbed Caskett by fans of the show, was between Detective Kate Beckett and her author-turned-partner Richard Castle. Though the pair did have sizable onscreen chemistry, there were issues with the way the relationship played out in the plot as well as with the relationship between the actors who played them. By the end of the series, the actors had a terrible working relationship that made it difficult to film their scenes together. This is reflected in the many storylines of the final season that kept them apart.
Additionally, onscreen, the chemistry was not enough to make up for the fact that they were not a good fit. Beckett&#39;s by-the-book nature and logical outlook were constantly challenged by Castle&#39;s immature and relaxed outlook. Initially, Beckett did not return Castle&#39;s feelings for her, but as she came to share them she would consistently push him away, but he would never stop pursuing her. Eventually, they were able to communicate effectively, but no healthy relationship would play out as theirs did.
            

 25 Things That Make No Sense About Castle and Beckett&#39;s Relationship 
Richard Castle and Kate Beckett&#39;s relationship on ABC&#39;s Castle had many issues, though most fans tried to ignore them.



 6  That An Author Became A Police Consultant 
Even with all his money and power
        

In season 1, Castle is interviewed by Beckett and the NYPD following a murder that follows a description from one of his books. After this, he is enthralled by Beckett and the intrigue of police work and uses his pull with the mayor, and his monetary assets, to be allowed to shadow Beckett. It&#39;s unlikely that an author would be allowed to shadow a police detective by going to all their major crime scenes, and even more unlikely that he would be kept on and become a valued part of the department. Somehow, through his gift for writing, Castle is amazing at solving crimes, a situation that doesn&#39;t make sense.





 5  Alexis Helping With Cases 
Castle&#39;s teen daughter had no place in the police force
        

Alexis (Molly Quinn) is Castle&#39;s daughter whom he had with his first wife. Although she is a smart overachiever, and overall an accomplished young woman, she gets involved in dangerous police activity all too frequently. She is in high school when the show begins, and while she does grow up and is a capable character, it&#39;s even less plausible that the police would allow her to be part of cases than it is that they let Castle help. Throughout the series, her relationships with Castle and Beckett frequently put her in harm&#39;s way, a fact that becomes melodramatic as the show progresses.




 4  Unrealistic Criminal Cases 
Even for a television show
        

Though there were plenty of gripping cases Caskett solved on Castle there were just as many that were even more improbable. The show is, of course, fiction, but the cases that pop up, and the way that the team solves them fall outside the realm of being believable. Part of this was because cases were supposed to be inspirational for Castle in his writing and because the writers wanted to ramp up the drama for the sake of the show. Castle and the Detectives were often brought in on cases that involved models, actors, authors, singers, and politicians, but rarely the everyday grunt work that most police are saddled with. 




 3  The Repetitive Formula 
Difficulty breaking away from the procedural format
        

Many great and popular TV shows are procedurals, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with having predictable beats to a story. It&#39;s part of the fun of that type of show, it keeps the tone light, and it allows for fun interpersonal moments between characters. Unfortunately, Castle was never satisfied with being a procedural and consistently tried to shake things up over the seasons. Despite the attempt at more fulfilling season-long arcs, the show would still always return to the original format, and it would have been more enjoyable if the show had committed to that.




 2  The Treatment Of People Of Color 
As ancillary or as plot devices, but not main characters
        

Few characters besides Beckett and Castle have a lot of time devoted to their character development, but that&#39;s especially true with the characters of color. Detective Esposito (Jon Huertas) is one of the biggest characters outside the central two, but he rarely gets to do much more than be comic relief or a foil to the behavior of the central pair. Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones) was also a significant player on the show as a medical examiner and forensic expert, but the friendship that she could have had with Beckett was never developed, in part due to the show&#39;s additional lack of positive platonic female relationships.





 1  Unnecessarily Obstacles And Deaths 
Kidnapping, hidden marriages, and more


In season 8 of Castle, it seems as though Castle and Beckett take turns being kidnapped or in need of rescuing in almost every episode. While part of this could be attributed to off-screen drama, there were plenty of other plot points that made no sense in the series. Once Beckett and Castle finally admitted their feelings for each other, it was revealed that Beckett was unknowingly married the whole time, which was extremely out of character for her. In season 6, it&#39;s also uncovered that Castle&#39;s father was a CIA agent, and he didn&#39;t have any knowledge of that.
Outside this, certain character deaths felt forced and were a sad addition to the show. One in particular was Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), who was the Captain of the precinct until his death by an assassin in season 3. Another death that hangs over the heads of the characters is that of Beckett&#39;s mother, specifically that someone had ordered a hit against her and it was a Senator. While this all made for compelling drama, it didn&#39;t always make for the best TV.
