# Star Trek DS9 Broke TNG s Season Finale Tradition For The Better


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s season finales broke away from the cliffhanger tradition established by Star Trek: The Next Generation.   The season 1 finale of DS9 focused on providing a satisfying conclusion to the first chapter of the show, rather than relying on a big cliffhanger.   DS9 season finales aimed to shake things up and set the characters on a new path, rather than rely on gimmicky cliffhangers.

## Literature Review
TNG&#39;s Locutus cliffhanger changed the game for Star Trek, but DS9 took a very different approach to the season finale from as far back as season 1.




Star Trek: Deep Space Nine broke one of Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s long-standing season finale traditions, improving the spinoff show in the process. DS9 premiered in January 1993, almost three years after TNG&#39;s game-changing season 3 finale, &#34;The Best of Both Worlds.&#34; Following the huge success of the cliffhanger ending which revealed that Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) had become Locutus of Borg, TNG&#39;s season finales were all built around big cliffhangers. Right from the start, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was conceived as a very different show to TNG, and this difference in approach extended to the season finales.




The original plan for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s season 1 finale was to have DS9 crossover with Star Trek: The Next Generation. Rick Berman rightly vetoed the idea of Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise-D helping Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) to repel a Cardassian invasion, which would surely have undermined the TNG spinoff show at a crucial moment. Instead, DS9 producer Michael Piller conceived of a different type of season finale that was vastly different from TNG, and also reflected Deep Space Nine&#39;s more serialized approach to storytelling.

                  Roddenberry Would Have Approved Of Star Trek: DS9â€™s Season 1 Finale   We&#39;ll never know if Gene Roddenberry would approve of Star Trek: DS9, but the season 1 finale perfectly embodies his vision of infinite diversity.    


 DS9 Season 1 Broke A Star Trek: TNG Season Finale Tradition 
          




By 1993, Star Trek: The Next Generation would end each season with a cliffhanger, but Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 1 did something very different. While DS9 season 1, episode 20, &#34;In the Hands of the Prophets&#34;, does set up the political and religious upheaval that opens season 2, it has a clearly defined ending. This was at the behest of DS9 producer Michael Piller, who wanted to end season 1 with an episode that would serve as a bookend to the pilot, &#34;Emissary.&#34; Robert Hewitt Wolfe fulfilled that brief perfectly, by revisiting Sisko&#39;s newfound religious status, and revealing that he, and some Bajorans, are grappling with the implications of his meeting with the Prophets.

Rather than end on a huge cliffhanger, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s season 1 finale ends with a quiet moment between Sisko and Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor). Kira and Sisko reflect on the events of DS9 season 1, and Kira wryly states that she doesn&#39;t see the Starfleet commander as &#34;the devil.&#34; It&#39;s a scene that brings the first chapter of Deep Space Nine&#39;s story to a satisfying close rather than rely on a big cliffhanger, or what Ira Steven Behr once called a &#34;gimmick&#34; in the book, Captains&#39; Log Supplemental: The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages. Across all seven seasons, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine rejected the cliffhanger ending tradition of Star Trek: The Next Generation in favor of chapter endings, in the style of &#34;In the Hands of the Prophets.&#34;






 How DS9 Season 1 Finales Differed From TNG &amp; Voyager 
          

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season finales do have cliffhangers, but generally they&#39;re on a much larger scale than those of Star Trek: The Next Generation or Voyager. For example, DS9 season 5 ends with the Cardassians retaking the space station. If &#34;Call to Arms&#34; was a TNG or Voyager finale, the story would be resolved in next season&#39;s premiere. Instead, Sisko and the crew don&#39;t get the station back until DS9 season 6, episode 6, &#34;Sacrifice of Angels.&#34; DS9 season finales don&#39;t just break a story in two, they get the lead characters to where they need to be for the story to continue.

That&#39;s something that was established in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s season 1 finale, which established the political and religious conflict on Bajor. It&#39;s an approach that was reflective of DS9&#39;s refusal to hit Star Trek&#39;s episodic reset button. Events in DS9 had far-reaching consequences, and so gimmicky, easily resolvable cliffhangers wouldn&#39;t be appropriate. Instead, the end of each season acted like the end of a chapter in a novel, shaking things up and setting its characters on a new path. It&#39;s something that continues to this day in modern Star Trek, particularly in Star Trek: Discovery, showing that Star Trek: Deep Space Nine remains hugely influential.
