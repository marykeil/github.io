## Literature Review

Acclaimed Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan is now set to adapt the acclaimed book Empire of the Summer Moon as his next big project.




Taylor Sheridan is set to adapt Empire of the Summer Moon for his next project. Sheridan is the award-winning creator behind the hit Western series Yellowstone. Holding the full title of Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History, Empire of the Summer Moon is a historical book written by S.C. Gwynne.




According to Deadline, Sheridan is now set to adapt the book Empire of the Summer Moon as his next project. Sheridan will produce the project alongside Jenny Wood for Bosque Ranch. It has not yet been revealed whether the Empire of the Summer Moon adaptation will take the form of a film or television series. Author Gwynne spoke highly of the adaption, saying:


I can’t think of anyone better qualified to bring Empire of the Summer Moon to the screen than Taylor Sheridan. He has a deep and nuanced understanding of both the myth and reality of the Old West. I am thrilled that he is undertaking this project.



 What To Expect from Empire of the Summer Moon 
          

Empire of the Summer Moon spans a four-decade history that recounts the battle for control between white settlers and the Comanche tribe. Chief Quanah Parker helped to lead the effort against the white settlers as his people sought to maintain their rightful control over the American West, after they had already had successful fights against the Spanish and the French. The Comanches were known for being accomplished fighters who taught young boys to ride horses starting at 6 years old, and Chief Quanah was no exception.






Spanning four decades of history, Empire of the Summer Moon would lend itself quite well to the small screen medium, a fact that may push Sheridan into making another TV series.




As of now, very little information is known about the nature of the adaptation of Empire of the Summer Moon. Throughout his prolific career, Sheridan has certainly taken on film versions of Western stories, including the neo-Western Hell or High Water and crime drama Wind River. However, the projects he has been involved in most recently, such as Yellowstone and 1923, have generally been in the television sphere. Spanning four decades of history, Empire of the Summer Moon would lend itself quite well to the small screen medium, a fact that may push Sheridan into making another TV series.

                  All 9 Taylor Sheridan Movies, Ranked Worst To Best   Taylor Sheridan has written, directed, and acted in nine movies in his career, and they can be ranked from worst to best based on overall quality.   




According to reports, adapting Empire of the Summer Moon has been a passion project of Sheridan’s for years, ever since Warner Bros. first began developing the project. Sheridan holds a deep respect for Quanah’s story, which will serve him well in adapting the acclaimed book. Hopefully, his “deep and nuanced understanding of both the myth and reality of the Old West” will come through as the Empire of the Summer Moon project continues its development.
