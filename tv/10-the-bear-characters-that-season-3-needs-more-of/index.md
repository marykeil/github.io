## Literature Review

The Bear is known for its incredible and diverse ensemble cast. These supporting or cameo characters deserve more attention in season 3.




FX&#39;s The Bear is a series praised for its ensemble cast of characters, though many could use more time to shine in season 3. The show centers around Carmy Berzatto, who inherits a beloved Chicago restaurant following his older brother&#39;s passing. As an esteemed chef, Carmy tries to set the failing restaurant back on track while putting the pieces of his own life together following the tragic loss. The Golden Globe and Emmy-winning series is both hilarious and profoundly moving, with a memorable and unique cast from top to bottom.
Similar to shows like The Sopranos or The Wire, The Bear writers excel at creating distinct personalities, where even the most minor portion of screen time can make a character memorable and alluring. The series focuses on Carmy, Sydney, Marcus, and Richie the most; thus, they&#39;re some of The Bear&#39;s most likable characters. But between the fantastic guest stars and the supporting restaurant staff, there&#39;s untapped potential for characters the show could utilize more.









 








 10  Stevie 
John Mulaney&#39;s character brings positivity and charisma to the series.
Among the many celebrity cameos in The Bear season 2 was John Mulaney, who played the role of Stevie. Of the many family members and associates introduced in the episode &#34;Fishes,&#34; Stevie seems the least familiar with the crowd, though it isn&#39;t his first rodeo with the Berzattos. Stevie has a hilarious scene with the Fak brothers regarding a baseball card investment and tries to save the room from tension when Michael and Uncle Lee argue. Of course, he&#39;s not significant enough to merit a Stevie-centric episode, but John Mulaney lending his presence for more guest appearances is always appreciated.





 9  Uncle Lee 
Bob Odenkirk&#39;s Uncle Lee could tie into Carmy&#39;s father.
Bob Odenkirk guest stars as Uncle Lee in &#34;Fishes,&#34; a character who memorably gets into a dramatic argument with Michael after calling him out on his behavior. Uncle Lee is close enough with the family to be called &#34;cousin,&#34; meaning he could appear to guest star again. It would be interesting to see him reflecting on Michael now that he&#39;s passed. Not to mention, Uncle Lee is one of the characters whose story could tie into Carmy&#39;s dad in The Bear, who&#39;s been left a mystery through the first two seasons.





 8  Michelle 
Sarah Paulson&#39;s Michelle brings needed family stability to the Berzattos.
Another beloved star who made a cameo appearance in &#34;Fishes&#34; was Sarah Paulson, who plays Carmy&#39;s cool cousin from New York. Michelle seems to be one of the only well-put-together members of the family, who&#39;s kind and sociable, and one of the few people no one has conflict with. In her brief scenes with Carmy, she lends a touch of family stability that he and Sugar might desperately need, and she would be a fantastic supporting character to show up now and then.
            
 
 The Bear Season 2 Ending Explained 
The opening of The Bear should be the greatest night of Carmy&#39;s career but he&#39;s left out in the cold in a season 2 finale that ends on a frosty note.








 7  Sugar 
Exploring Sugar&#39;s personal life would benefit the show&#39;s overarching story.


 







Sugar&#39;s role was increased significantly in season 2, with her taking on responsibility at the restaurant and becoming a massive help to Carmy. Played with charm and humor by Abby Elliott, Sugar&#39;s personal life is barely explored, and she&#39;s the most prominent character not to have an episode surrounding her. Given that she&#39;s suffered the same loss and had the same complicated family upbringing as Carmy, her character is vital to explore further.





 6  Uncle Jimmy 
Oliver Platt&#39;s Uncle Jimmy has untapped depth.
Played excellently by Oliver Platt, Uncle Jimmy is a primary financial supporter of the restaurant who expresses an authentic love for the Berzatto family despite not being blood-related. The origins of his wealth have been a mystery, and the vague element of that detail adds to its effect, but it would still be fascinating to see more of his life. He has a family of his own who are barely explored, and he may be another character with ties to the father of the Berzatto family.





 5  Donna Berzatto 
Donna is essential to Carmy&#39;s story going forward.
Academy Award-winner Jamie Lee-Curtis was the most thrilling cameo in The Bear season 2, introducing a character-defining dynamic to the Berzatto family. Parallels can instantly be made connecting Carmy&#39;s behavior to that of his mother, and her deciding not to attend the restaurant&#39;s opening night establishes the storyline to continue. Whether it be another eventful family gathering or because of Carmy&#39;s emotional journey, Donna needs to appear more in The Bear season 3.





 4  Ebraheim 
Ebraheim&#39;s arc in The Bear has made him highly likable.
Ebraheim is a subtle but highly likable character at the restaurant, whose arc in season 2 primarily consisted of a conflict with Tina. Ebra has been a chef for a long time and struggles to adapt to the culinary school Sydney sends him and Tina to. He eventually returns to the restaurant to run the takeout sandwich window. His conflict in season 2 is easily relatable, and he&#39;s a character who brings much-needed stability to The Bear.





 3  Fak 
A Fak-centric episode could lean into The Bear&#39;s comedic strengths.
Responsible for many of the funniest scenes in The Bear, Fak is easily one of the show&#39;s most wholesome and loveable characters. His dynamics with Carmy, Richie, and his brother constantly make for fantastic and heartwarming scenes, and he&#39;s a character who needs some attention of his own. A Fak-centric episode could prove the show&#39;s merits as a comedy and explore the show&#39;s core themes of found family and friendship. Matty Matheson contributes so much in every scene as Fak and deserves an episode to shine.





 2  Tina 
Tina&#39;s growth as a chef makes her a vital character.
Played phenomenally by actress Liza ColÃ³n-Zayas, Tina is another character who&#39;s been loosely explored but deserves more screen time. Like Ebraheim, Tina&#39;s veteran status in the restaurant makes her hesitant to make any change, though she&#39;s on board with the team by the end of season 1. In season 2, she thrives in culinary school and grows significantly as a chef able to contribute to the Bear restaurant. She&#39;s one of the most respectable characters in the series and will hopefully continue to thrive in season 3.





 1  Claire 
Molly Gordon is excellent as Claire, but she&#39;s one of the least-developed characters.


 







Introduced in season 2 as a love interest to Carmy, actress Molly Gordon&#39;s charisma and humor were enough to make Claire a likable character. However, Claire&#39;s lack of depth stands out in a series filled with complex and unique personalities. Assuming the season 2 ending breakup wasn&#39;t the last of her, Claire is a character that should be explored more in The Bear season 3. Aside from her orbiting Carmy and the restaurant, she has an exciting job and life of her own that should factor into their relationship dynamic. More Molly Gordon is always a positive, and she deserves some great material to work with.
