## Literature Review
Tumi Mhlongo is putting out fires left and right on Below Deck Med, and now she&#39;s got even more stress thanks for Captain Sandy&#39;s latest decision.




Tumi Mhlongo has had it with Lily Davison on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, but Captain Sandy Yawn is willing to give the new stew another chance. There&#39;s always been drama within the Below Deck franchise, but it feels like this year it has ratcheted up a ton on Below Deck Med, particularly when it comes to the feud between Tumi, Kyle Viljoen and Natalya Scudder. Kyle pit Tumi and Natalya against each other, and the latter ended up leaving the charter season early, resulting in Captain Sandy hiring Lily as her replacement stew.




Bravo just released a preview clip for the next episode of Below Deck Med season 8, in which Tumi receives an update from Captain Sandy about how Lily&#39;s doing. It&#39;s clear that the new stew has been struggling with her responsibilities, which is why the chief stew wants her fired. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not happening--at least not yet.


 

The clip starts off with Sandy telling Below Deck Med newbie Lily she needs to take the initiative and be &#34;more aware&#34; so she can do her duties on her own without help. &#34;I am giving you this opportunity, one more chance,&#34; Captain Sandy bluntly states. Then the captain meets up with Tumi to tell her she needs to &#34;take the time&#34; to go over things with Lily. Sandy admits she hires for &#34;character, not skill, because the skill can be taught.&#34; It&#39;s the latter that Lily needs to work on.





 Tumi&#39;s &#34;Worst Nightmare&#34; Is Coming True On Below Deck Med 
          

Tumi acknowledges that Lily&#39;s attitude is great. However, she was &#34;hoping&#34; that Sandy&#39;s conversation with Lily would have resulted in her dismissal. &#34;&#39;Let&#39;s let her go and just say bye bye.&#39; Clearly not,&#34; Tumi says, with exasperation in her voice. The very next scene shows Lily asking Jessika Asai to walk her through making the bed again. Based on that brief interaction, it appears that Lily is taking Captain Sandy&#39;s advice to heart and wants to learn how to properly perform her duties.

Lily isn&#39;t the only Below Deck Med cast member causing headaches for Tumi. The chief stew is still dealing with Kyle. Later on in the Below Deck Med season 8, episode 13, preview clip, Kyle goes up to Tumi to reveal that he&#39;s suffering from a migraine and needs to take a rest. His health concerns started the previous night, and as a result, he hasn&#39;t gotten much sleep. According to Tumi, this is her &#34;worst nightmare because he&#39;s the one person who has the experience that I need&#34; as they get ready for their next charter guests to arrive.

The crew of the Mustique clearly has a lot of issues they need to deal with. Tumi&#39;s getting stressed out as she has to put out metaphorical fires left and right, and Captain Sandy needs everyone to step up and prove their worth. It wasn&#39;t that long ago when Kyle was on the verge of being fired right after Natalya&#39;s premature exit, but Sandy gave him another chance. She&#39;s now doing the same with Lily. At some point, though, if everyone keeps getting multiple chances at improving, then things need to change going into Below Deck Med season 9, specifically when it comes to firing existing crew members and hiring new ones.




Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
