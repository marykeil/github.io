## Literature Review
Minx season 3 isn’t happening, as the &#39;70s-set comedy show, which was picked up by Starz after being axed by Max, is canceled for the second time.




Minx season 3 isn’t happening, as the period comedy show has been canceled for the second time. Canceled for the first time by Max after an acclaimed season 1, Minx was given a second chance at life when season 2 was picked up by Starz. The ‘70s-set comedy charting the rise of a scrappy feminist magazine scored with critics in its second go-around, as reflected in season 2’s 89% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, sparking hopes of a third season.




Those high Minx season 3 hopes have unfortunately been dashed, however, as Starz has now itself canceled the show (via Deadline). The move comes on the heels of Starz canceling its comedy Shining Vale, which was also removed from its streaming platforms. Starz executives reportedly have expressed frustration with the performance of their comedies, leading to a purge of comedy properties from the outlet. Minx was canceled for the first time by Max as a write-off after first receiving a season 2 renewal.


 Minx Has Likely Run Out of Chances (But Maybe There’s Still Hope) 
          

Minx received critical acclaim thanks to its fresh premise, strong performances and convincing period trappings, but that didn’t help it to survive either in its initial run on Max, or in its second run on Starz. For a show to be canceled once and come back is a rare enough feat, but coming back from the dead a second time is basically unheard-of. That being the case, it seems unlikely that Minx will be back on any other streamer or cable network.






Minx was canceled by Max even though season 2 was largely finished.




The ratings failure of Minx season 2 was indeed an unlucky blow, as the show’s roll-out was hampered by the summer’s pair of entertainment industry strikes. Had the show been properly promoted, perhaps it would have caught on, and earned a third season at Starz. The comedy boasts enough winning elements, including an appealing cast of characters, to have built up a following, had it been given a shot. Perhaps there’s still hope of another outlet picking up the show for season 3, allowing Ophelia Lovibond, Jake Johnson and company to wrap up the saga of Minx Magazine, but again, the odds are against it.
