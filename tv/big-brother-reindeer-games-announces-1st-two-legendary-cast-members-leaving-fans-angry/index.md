## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games announced two cast members &amp; fans are angry at the idea of modern-era players like Cameron Hardin being called legends.




Big Brother Reindeer Games announced its first two cast members, leaving fans angry at the idea of modern-era players like BB 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin being referred to as a &#34;legend&#34; in the game. A new spin-off of Big Brother, BB Reindeer Games is a holiday twist on the long-running CBS reality competition series that will focus on physical competitions over social gameplay. With competitors from past seasons of Big Brother joining in on the holiday fun, fans are excited to see the new competition and watch some of their favorites compete in a brand-new style of the BB game, though some aren&#39;t thrilled with the casting choices being made.




Fans are angry at Big Brother Reindeer Games after their announcement of Cameron being slated to appear on the series, considering the cast was meant to be comprised of BB legends. While Cameron was popular with some Big Brother viewers, others were unhappy with his gameplay and socialization in the house, making them feel he&#39;s hardly a BB legend. On the Big Brother Instagram post announcing Cameron, fans of the show flooded the comments to express their annoyance. &#34;Using the term legend very loosely,&#34; @samanthaholden_ commented, while @iconeduard shared, &#34;this man is NOWHERE near a legend lets be fr.&#34; 


 

While some are focused on the fact that Cameron has yet to prove himself as a Big Brother legend, others are more interested in why the series chose him to represent Big Brother 25 after his consistent harassment of other houseguests. The series, which seemed to be protecting Cameron throughout the season&#39;s run, has been criticized by fans who watched live feeds and saw Cameron&#39;s behavior firsthand. &#34;Not a fan of the way he spoke over people and basically told them that they should think…literally acted like nobody could see or think for themselves,&#34; @lvs2sleep shared, with others agreeing.





 Big Brother Reindeer Games Casting Choices Explained 
          

Along with Cameron, Big Brother Reindeer Games announced that BB 24&#39;s winner, Taylor Hale, will be returning to the franchise for a shot at the $100,000 grand prize on the new series. While Taylor may be less debated than Cameron, many are also taking umbrage with her being called a BB legend, so soon. As a player who had a difficult time in the game and ultimately emerged victorious, it&#39;s not up for debate whether Taylor is a strong player, but the recency of her time on Big Brother may disqualify her from being a BB legend, as well. &#34;Just because you win doesn’t make you a legend,&#34;  @getknowledge98 shared.


 




The status of what makes a Big Brother legend is up for debate, but many feel that appearing on the most recent season and only making the jury after a twist overturned his eviction disqualifies &#34;legend&#34; status. Cameron&#39;s merely a houseguest who played the game. Despite claims he made big moves, Cameron was manipulated by others, ultimately getting evicted twice by unanimous votes. Some are hopeful that it will mark his last appearance with the franchise. Taylor, in contrast, has been celebrated by the Big Brother community as a deserved winner whom many are excited to see, though she may be too recent to be a legend, too.

While the full cast of Big Brother Reindeer Games has yet to be announced, fans may be skeptical of the casting now that two of the players who will be participating don&#39;t seem to be legends at all. With Big Brother Reindeer Games advertising legendary players coming back into the competition to try their hand at some new and classic games, the series has made it seem like the competitors who will be joining the series are widely known as BB legends. Though Taylor and Cameron may be exciting for some viewers to watch, others are disappointed by Big Brother Reindeer Games casting decisions.
