  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Actors who left The Office before it ended did so on good terms and went on to do other great projects, some even returned for the series finale.   Steve Carell&rsquo;s departure from The Office in season 7 was a difficult goodbye as he had been an important member of the show since season 1.   Other actors who left early include Mindy Kaling, B.J. Novak, David Denman, Melora Hardin, Amy Ryan, Zach Woods, Rashida Jones, and James Spader. The Office launched the careers of many cast members.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Office is known for having a talented and hilarious ensemble cast. But here&rsquo;s every main actor who left the show early, and why they did so.</p>
<p>With a stellar ensemble cast that helped make the show such a hit, every The Office cast member before the series finale made an impact. Although the original UK version of The Office that the US version is based on ran for only 14 episodes, the American show enjoyed a long run on television and is still considered one of the all-time greats of TV comedies and a noteworthy pioneer in the mockumentary sitcom genre. But even though the show was so successful, some actors left before it was over.</p>
<p>The actors who departed from The Office cast before the show had run its course had their reasons for doing so, though all parted on good terms. Likewise, many of them went on to do other great projects after leaving The Office and have continued to do so more recently. Some even returned for The Office&rsquo;s series finale, making for both emotional and hysterical cameos that remained true to their characters.</p>
<pre><code>              The Office: Why Steve Carell Didn’t Like Filming “The Dundies”   The Office season 2 opened with the memorable &quot;The Dundies&quot;, but Steve Carell disliked a crucial part of filming that almost derailed the episode.   
</code></pre>
<p>Steve Carell (Michael Scott)
Michael Left The Office In Season 7, Episode 22</p>
<p>Out of every actor who left The Office, Steve Carrell&rsquo;s exit was the biggest. The show wouldn&rsquo;t be what it is without self-proclaimed &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Best Boss,&rdquo; Michael Scott. But The Office season 7 sees Michael finally leave Dunder Mifflin and Scranton, PA behind to move to Colorado with his fiancé, Holly. It&rsquo;s one of the sitcom&rsquo;s most emotional moments, and it was a difficult goodbye for the cast too, as Carell had been such an important member of the show since its original season 1 adaption.</p>
<p>At the time, the official word on Steve Carell&rsquo;s departure from The Office was that he simply felt it was time to go, and he wanted to spend more time with his family. In Andy Greene&rsquo;s 2020 book, The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s, it&rsquo;s revealed Carell was willing to return for more seasons of the show, but executives at NBC never communicated about renewing his contract. Even when Carell had publicly indicated that season 7 might be his last, the network didn&rsquo;t reach out to him.</p>
<p>Steve Carell was nominated for 6 Emmys For The Office, winning once in 2005.</p>
<p>Mindy Kaling (Kelly Kapoor)
Kelly Left The Office In Season 9, Episode 1</p>
<p>Customer service rep Kelly&rsquo;s sendoff comes in the first episode of season 9 as Mindy Kaling left The Office. Kelly announces that she&rsquo;s moving with her fiancé Ravi to Miami, not aware that it is Ohio and not Florida. However, she does appear in the series finale, fittingly running off with on-again, off-again lover Ryan at Dwight and Angela&rsquo;s wedding, leaving Ryan&rsquo;s infant son Drake in the care of the unsuspecting Ravi.</p>
<p>According to the actress, her departure from the show was quite seamless. Kaling was starting her show, The Mindy Project, and she ended up working with some of her friends from The Office on that project as well, such as B.J. Novak and Ed Helms.</p>
<pre><code>              Mindy Kaling Is Right About The Office (But That Shouldn’t Stop A Revival)   The Office had several cringeworthy moments that would not fly in today's culture, but could the show still be brought back successfully?   
</code></pre>
<p>B.J. Novak (Ryan Howard)
Ryan Left The Office In Season 9, Episode 1</p>
<p>Like Mindy Kaling, B.J. Novak, who plays Ryan on The Office, was also a writer on the show, as well as a producer. He also left right at the start of season 9, with Ryan following Kelly to Ohio but claiming that his simultaneous departure was unrelated. According to B.J. Novak, his Office exit was motivated mostly by burnout.</p>
<p>By season 9, other important The Office cast members like Carrell, and especially Kaling, whom Novak was quite close with when working on the series, had already left. Novak wasn&rsquo;t feeling as invested in the show as he wanted and didn&rsquo;t feel like he could do it anymore, even though he was offered a role as The Office showrunner moving forward.</p>
<p>David Denman (Roy Anderson)
David Left The Office In Season 3, Episode 19</p>
<p>Before Jim and Pam&rsquo;s romance took off, Roy Anderson, played by David Denman, was Pam&rsquo;s deadbeat fiancé/boyfriend in the show&rsquo;s early seasons. Inattentive and prone to violence, Roy serves mainly as an obstacle to Jim and Pam&rsquo;s romance throughout The Office seasons 1 to 3. This is ultimately why Denman left, too.</p>
<p>After Pam and Roy&rsquo;s Office breakup, the actor knew he wouldn&rsquo;t be on the show for much longer. Denman&rsquo;s original contract was rather low for seasons 1 to 3, with the caveat of becoming much more lucrative in seasons 4 and beyond. This rather ominous setup, coupled with the writers&rsquo; commitment to getting Jim and Pam together, meant that Denman wasn&rsquo;t destined to stick around as a series regular past season 3.</p>
<p>His character did find redemption in The Office season 9 episode, appropriately entitled &ldquo;Roy&rsquo;s Wedding,&rdquo; suggesting Roy was better off without Pam. The episode opens with Jim and Pam somewhat awkwardly attending a lavish (and bizarrely early morning) wedding for Roy and his new bride-to-be. The reception revealed that Roy had started a successful gravel company, affording him a beautiful home. He even took piano lessons to impress his new bride, which understandably left his ex, Pam, shocked.</p>
<p>Melora Hardin (Jan Levinson)
David Left The Office In Season 9, Episode 7</p>
<p>One of The Office&rsquo;s most notorious characters is Jan Levinson, who plays Michael&rsquo;s uptight corporate boss, domineering girlfriend, and unstable ex at different points in the show. Jan&rsquo;s appearance in the series mostly dwindles by the end of season 5, though she does appear as a recurring character in season 7 as well. After Jan&rsquo;s breakup with Michael, Jan&rsquo;s role becomes less important, which is part of why actress Melora Hardin disappeared from the show.</p>
<p>On the podcast, An Oral History of The Office, Hardin also revealed that she never felt a true sense of belonging on set. Though there was no ill will between her and the rest of the cast, a side effect of Jan&rsquo;s appearance only in specific scenes, as opposed to the consistent Scranton office, meant that she didn&rsquo;t bond as tightly as everyone else did.</p>
<p>Amy Ryan (Holly Flax)
David Left The Office In Season 7, Episode 19</p>
<p>Another iconic flame of Michael Scott&rsquo;s on The Office is HR rep Holly Flax, played by Amy Ryan. In a refreshing twist from every other woman Michael Scott dated on The Office before Holly, she is a great fit for his unique personality and quirks, and the two seem genuinely in love.</p>
<p>Though not technically billed as a main cast member for any of the seasons she appears in, Amy Ryan is, no doubt, a critical component of The Office&rsquo;s storyline because of how Holly helps shape Michael&rsquo;s journey. The simple reason why the actress didn&rsquo;t stick around until the show&rsquo;s final season is the fact that Holly and Michael&rsquo;s lives were completely intertwined after season 7, so it would have been out of place for Ryan to appear without Carell.</p>
<pre><code>              The Most Controversial Decision Holly Made On The Office   Holly joined The Office during season 4 as the new Human Resources representative, but here's her most controversial in the position explained.   
</code></pre>
<p>Zach Woods (Gabe Lewis)
David Left The Office In Season 8, Episode 24</p>
<p>Gabe, played by Zach Woods, is one of The Office&rsquo;s odder later-season additions to the main cast. Technically a management consultant after Sabre buys up Dunder Mifflin in season 6, there&rsquo;s plenty about The Office&rsquo;s Gabe Lewis that makes no sense. The character mysteriously disappears after season 8, presumably being unceremoniously fired by David Wallace after he buys Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre.</p>
<p>Gabe does have a guest appearance in season 9&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moving On&rdquo; episode, however. Woods has never revealed any particular reason for leaving The Office early after being bumped up to a main cast role in season 7, though it allowed him to star in HBO&rsquo;s Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Other Main Actors Who Left The Office Early
Rashida Jones &amp; James Spader Both Left Early As Well</p>
<p>A few other actors had one-season main roles on The Office before leaving. Like Roy, Rashida Jones&rsquo;s character, Karen Filippelli, wasn&rsquo;t meant to last on The Office since her primary role was keeping Jim and Pam apart during season 2 to add drama to their long love saga. However, Jones left The Office to work on Parks and Recreation, leading to the theory that Parks &amp; Rec&rsquo;s Ann Perkins and The Office&rsquo;s Karen are somehow the same person.</p>
<p>Lastly, James Spader was only on The Office as a main character for season 8, in which he played Michael Scott&rsquo;s replacement, Robert California. This appearance was always intended as a one-off, so it came as no surprise that Spader left the show before season 9 just as planned. Nevertheless, his performance as a cunning and at times even scary corporate opportunist made Spader one of The Office&rsquo;s most interesting main actors to leave the show early.</p>
<p>The Office Launched Dozens Of Careers
Jon Krasinski, Ed Helms, and Others Became Huge Stars After The Office</p>
<p>Though every actor left The Office for their own reasons, there are so many cast members who owe their careers to the show. Steve Carrell and John Krasinski are the biggest stars to come out of the original cast, with big movie careers including an Oscar nomination for Carrell in Foxcatcher and a solid directing career for Kransinki with A Quiet Place.</p>
<p>Other cast members like Ed Helms, Craig Robinson, Ellie Kemper, and Mark Proksch kicked off successful television careers with their roles on the show. Fans might also forget that The Office helped launch future superstars like Amy Adams and Evan Peters in early roles.</p>
