## Literature Review
Supernatural ran for an incredible 15 seasons, but if the story is to continue, there are some other characters that deserve to take the spotlight.




Some mutterings about a potential Supernatural season 16 have been floating around in the latter half of 2023, but other characters could carry the story forward aside from Sam and Dean Winchester. Supernatural ran from 2005 to 2020, and in that time, the show debuted a significant number of interesting characters who could carry a spin-off series, or continue the fight against evil. While the series finale appeared to say its final goodbyes to Dean as he told Sam to move on with his dying breath, and we saw Sam live a full and happy life, there are other moving parts in the Supernatural universe worth checking in on.
If the show were to return in some format, there are plenty of characters that deserve to have their story continued. From Jody Mills and the girls to the newly crowned queen of hell Rowena, the Supernatural universe is begging to be revisited with other characters getting a turn in the spotlight. But, if the series is to follow up with one of the side characters, it needs to explore where their journey goes beyond the Winchesters and the latest world-ending apocalypse.


 7  Castiel 
Played By Misha Collins



Castiel has been a staple of Supernatural since season 4, quickly becoming a fan-favorite character and a core part of the Winchester&#39;s team to fight against the forces of evil. Despite sacrificing himself for Dean in the final season, Bobby reveals to Dean in heaven that Jack brought Cas back to help him set heaven in order. If the show were to continue, it would have to address where Cas is now and what he has been up to since he was revived. Right before his death, he revealed his true feelings for Dean. Presumably, they have a conversation about that at least.




 6  Sam&#39;s Son (Dean Winchester II) Played By Spencer Borgeson
        

One character who was only introduced in the final episode of Supernatural could also take the series forward in the form of Sam&#39;s son, Dean. Named in memory of his uncle, Dean grew up with the legendary Sam Winchester as a father, who was both an incredible hunter and an extraordinary man of letters. Young Dean has a lot of potential to continue the legacy of his father and uncle, along with all the information from Dean and his grandfather&#39;s journals.
            

 8 Ways Supernatural Can Continue After Its Season 15 Ending 
Since the announcement of Supernaturalâ€™s potential return, many have been wondering how the series will return after its definite season 15 ending. 




Dean also displays the traditional anti-possession tattoo sported by other hunters which can be seen before he says goodbye to his father. Considering the blurred lines between the dead and living that were on show in Supernatural and The Winchesters, Sam and Dean could even drop in to help train and guide Sam&#39;s son in ridding the world of threats. Continuing the family story with the next generation could be a great way to give the world of Supernatural a fresh angle, unburdened by the history that The Winchesters had to work around.





 5  Donna Hanscum Played By Briana Buckmaster
        

Donna was introduced in Supernatural season 9 and continues to appear as a recurring guest character up to the final season. A mild-mannered sheriff from Minnesota, Donna first met the boys while she was at a weight-loss health spa being run by monsters. In further appearances, she teamed up with another police officer/hunter, Jody Mills, and trained as a hunter. Donna became incredibly proficient at taking down monsters and demons, and continuing her story could be a great way to evolve the show and explore the supernatural.





 4  Garth Fitzgerald IV Played By DJ Qualls
        

Garth filled the role once occupied by Bobby after he passed away. He was connected to hunters all over the country, providing intelligence, support, and even assigning jobs. Garth was also turned into a werewolf, before finally retiring and starting a career in dentistry that afforded him more time with his wife and kids. The story for Garth could continue in several ways. Possibly as a family sitcom that sees hunters drop in on his attempt to lead a normal life or even a medical procedural where he turns into a werewolf and needs to control his urges. Garth&#39;s story would certainly be a fun way to expand the series.





 3  Rowena MacLeod, Queen of Hell Played By Ruth Connell
        

Rowena MacLeod was introduced to Supernatural fairly late in season 10. She was once Crowley&#39;s mother when they were both human, although her obsession with increasing her powers as a witch kept her preoccupied. Rowena had a magnetic and commanding personality before eventually dying, where she would be sent to hell. However, while there, she once again proved her resourcefulness and managed to wrestle control of hell to become queen. Before Rowena, it is unlikely that any condemned souls managed to occupy the position that was previously reserved exclusively for demons and fallen angels, and the story of her climb to power would be incredibly interesting.
            

 10 Best Supernatural Episodes, Ranked 
Supernatural had its highs and its lows over the 15-season run, but some episodes stood out among the 327 total as the best of the best.


 2  Jody Mills and the Girls 
Played By Kim Rhodes, Katherine Ramdeen, And Kathryn Newton


Jody Mills was once just a regular sheriff working in Sioux Falls before she met the Winchester boys and her life changed forever. The boys were investigating an odd case in the area, which resulted in the discovery of a zombie invasion and the death and resurrection of her son and husband. Jody bravely fought side by side with the boys and, after some time grieving, she became a hunter and an adopted mother to a couple of lost girls.
Claire Novak, the daughter of the man that Castiel possessed, suffered greatly after Cas took over her father&#39;s body. Alex Jones was abducted from her home and used as a blood slave for a nest of vampires. The two young girls ended up with no one to care for them and eventually found their way to Jody. Full of rage and confusion about their troubled pasts, they rebelled for a while, until Jody trained them to hunt alongside her, and occasionally Donna Hanscum to become a badass team. The Mills family would be certain to continue the story with plenty of great family hunting in Supernatural.




 1  Charlie Bradbury (Alternate World) Played By Felicia Day
        

Charlie Bradbury was a recurring character between Supernatural season 7 and season 10, when she was killed. However, later seasons revealed an alternate Charlie on an apocalypse world who chose to eventually leave her chaotic world behind her and move to the main Earth. This apocalypse Charlie has some minor differences from the original, but her intelligence, quirkiness, sense of humor, and proficiency in hunting all carry over. In fact, the alternate Charlie, refined by her experiences, was a better warrior and an effective leader in their rebellion. If Supernatural were to continue the story with other characters, Charlie would be a great one to revisit.
