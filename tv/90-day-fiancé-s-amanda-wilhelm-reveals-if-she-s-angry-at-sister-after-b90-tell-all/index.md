## Literature Review
Amanda Wilhelm reveals if 90 Day Fiancé ruined her relationship with her sister after Amber shared a shocking secret about her during the Tell-All.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Amanda Wilhlem revealed where her relationship with her sister Amber stands after the latter shockingly spilled all her secrets during the Tell-All. Amanda is a 32-year-old woman from Louisiana who lost her husband Jason Wilhlem due to ampullary cancer. The mother of two began using TikTok to distract herself from the pain, and that&#39;s where she met social media entertainer, actor, and singer Razvan Ciocoi. Amanda was impressed by Razvan&#39;s silliness but also worried about him cheating on her because of his flirtatious nature. However, during the Tell-All, Amber revealed that it was Amanda who was talking to someone else while she was dating Razvan.




Amanda kept asking Amber to &#34;relax&#34; and not talk about her almost-romantic relationship with the mystery man. Amber revealed there was a man in Amanda&#39;s life whom Razvan didn&#39;t want her to talk to, and this caused fights between them. Now that it&#39;s been over a month since the Tell-All aired, fans want to know if Amanda and Amber&#39;s relationship soured after they filmed together.

          

A fan asked Amanda, &#34;So, did your sister get into trouble with you after the tell all?&#34; She replied by sharing a selfie with Amber. She told the curious follower, &#34;My sister is my best friend.&#34; She wrote that she shares an &#34;unbreakable bond&#34; with her older sister.

 Amanda Wilhelm&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Storyline Explained 
          

Amanda also received a question about whether Amber is single. &#34;Is your sister single and if so, does she have any social media to follow?&#34; the fan wrote to Amanda. The 90 Day Fiancé cast member revealed that Amber is already engaged to &#34;an amazing man&#34; and is not single. She shared a photo of Amber with her future husband and refused to add a link to her sister&#39;s Instagram profile. Amanda and Razvan lacked compatibility and chemistry, which was evident once they met in person in Romania. Once Amanda landed in his country, she wondered if she was making a mistake by dating him.


 




Amanda hadn&#39;t grieved the death of her husband properly before jumping into the relationship. Moreover, Razvan also rubbed Amanda the wrong way when he revealed that he had applied for a tourist visa to come to the U.S. Amanda wondered if Razvan had the wrong intentions. She thought she would have to support Razvan financially once he came to the U.S. Amanda wasn&#39;t even comfortable being intimate with him. However, as days passed, Amanda got over her doubts about Razvan to give him a chance. Sadly, Amanda and Razvan split just a couple of weeks after she returned to the U.S.

Amanda claimed Razvan was self-obsessed and focusing more on his career than their 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days relationship. Amanda also said Razvan was controlling. As per Amber, Amanda&#39;s relationship with the mystery man was apparently romantic &#34;for a second&#34; and &#34;then wasn&#39;t.&#34; However, Amanda didn&#39;t end up dating the man. She was talking to someone else when she was filming the Tell-All. That relationship didn&#39;t last either, as she is now single. Meanwhile, Razvan is currently in America, where he plans to move permanently to launch his career as an artist.
