## Literature Review
Rachel Recchia has appeared on all three Bachelor Nation shows, but she&#39;s never been the lead of her own season. Here&#39;s why she deserves it.




Rachel Recchia has now starred on all three Bachelor Nation shows--The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and Bachelor in Paradise--but she deserves a second chance to be the Bachelorette in her own season. Rachel got her start on Clayton Echard&#39;s Bachelor season. She was part of the Rose Ceremony from Hell, when Clayton revealed that he had told Rachel, Gabby Windey, and Susie Evans that he loved them, and that he&#39;d been intimate with Rachel and Gabby. Clayton eventually broke up with heartbroken Rachel and Gabby at the same time.




After this shocking development, Rachel and Gabby were invited to be the stars of the first-ever dual Bachelorette season. In the end, Rachel got engaged to Tino Franco, but they broke up after he kissed another woman during a rough patch in their relationship. Rachel then tried her luck on Bachelor in Paradise season 9, where she made connections with Sean McLaughlin, Brayden Bowers, Tanner Courtad, and Jordan Vandergriff, but she self-eliminated when none of those relationships panned out. Now Rachel deserves a second chance in a Bachelorette season of her own.

 Who Is Rachel Recchia? 
Star of The Bachelor Season 26, The Bachelorette Season 19, &amp; Bachelor In Paradise Season 9
         

Rachel is a 27-year-old pilot and flight instructor originally from Chicago, Illinois. Before The Bachelor, she resided in Clermont, Florida, but she&#39;s since moved to Los Angeles, California. One of the most exciting moments on The Bachelorette season 19 was when Rachel flew her own plane to the Bachelor Mansion. It was an empowering moment for her, and it was a beautiful way to launch the season.




Rachel is charismatic and sweet, and is genuinely searching for the love of her life. Throughout all of the Bachelor Nation shows, Rachel was true to herself. She wants to be in a committed relationship, and is still searching for the right person. Rachel thought she&#39;d found him in Tino, but she had her heart broken by him. After her relationships with Clayton and Tino didn&#39;t work out, Rachel could&#39;ve given up, but she persisted and decided to join Bachelor in Paradise season 9.



 Rachel Shared Her First Bachelorette Season With Gabby Windey 
Rachel &amp; Gabby Were The First-Ever Dual Bachelorettes

 

Rachel and Gabby are the only Bachelorette stars who shared their season. Inevitably, although the women remained the best of friends throughout their journey, they were compared to each other by the men. Some of the men left Gabby for Rachel, which was confusing for their friendship. When Logan Palmer broke up with Rachel to pursue Gabby instead, Rachel felt like a failure. She even canceled her group date because of it. Even though Logan still could&#39;ve self-eliminated if Rachel were the only Bachelorette, she wouldn&#39;t have had to compare herself to another woman because he chose someone else.




The Bachelorette season 19 was a very difficult situation for Rachel and Gabby to be in, especially at the beginning of the season when the men made their choices. On The Bachelorette, the woman is supposed to be in control, but Rachel and Gabby&#39;s men were making most of the decisions. Therefore, Rachel went from Clayton having all of the power on The Bachelor, to sharing the lead role with Gabby and having men choose between them, and then to Bachelor in Paradise, in which she once again had to compete with other women for the men&#39;s affections.

Rachel deserves the chance to choose a partner on her own Bachelorette season. She should have the opportunity to be the center of attention, with men who are there solely for her. Rachel hasn&#39;t ever had the chance to experience that in all of her time on the Bachelor Nation shows. She deserves to have the spotlight shining on her.

 Rachel Wants To Find True Love 
Rachel Has Dated Several Bachelor Nation Men
         




Through all of her trials and tribulations in Bachelor Nation, one thing has remained clear: Rachel is searching for her true love. She fell in love with Clayton, and then Tino, and was hopeful for some of her relationships in Paradise as well. While some might say that Rachel is trying to force the situation, the truth is that she&#39;s purposely putting herself out there to make her dream of finding a husband come true.

A theme of Bachelor Nation shows is whether the contestants are there &#34;for the right reasons.&#34; Rachel has proven that she is. She&#39;s even fallen in love twice on the shows. Despite her past heartbreak, she continues to pursue what she wants. She keeps her heart open and is willing to give new relationships a chance. On Bachelor in Paradise season 9, Rachel was open to dating all sorts of men, including Sean, Brayden, Tanner, and Jordan, who all had such different personalities.

The problem was that Rachel once again had to compete with other women in order to win their hearts. She should have a Bachelorette season of her own with a pool of appropriate men from which to choose. Perhaps she&#39;ll find what she&#39;s looking for in that situation.

 Rachel Deserves A Season Of Her Own 
Rachel Has Never Been Completely In Control Of A Season
          

Rachel has been through so much with Bachelor Nation. She deserves a Bachelorette season of her own. The producers of the show owe it to her after everything she&#39;s put herself through for them throughout the years. While it was a fun experiment to see a dual Bachelorette season, the idea didn&#39;t work. Rachel and Gabby had less time to get to know their suitors on a one-on-one basis, and both of them broke up with their fiancés, Tino and Erich Schwer, shortly after the show.

The odds seemed stacked against the dual Bachelorette format working, especially since the majority of the solo seasons of The Bachelorette haven&#39;t even been successful. In fact, the last several Bachelorettes--including Becca Kufrin, Hannah Brown, Clare Crawley, Tayshia Adams, Katie Thurston, Michelle Young, Rachel, and Gabby--have all ended their engagements shortly after their seasons aired. Despite this, Rachel still should have the opportunity to experience the process the right way in her own Bachelorette season.




Rachel is a kind and romantic woman who wants to find her one true love. She&#39;s so sweet that her former suitors and fellow Bachelor in Paradise season 9 contestants, including runner-up Aven Jones, Tyler Norris, and Jordan have remained friends with her. Although she&#39;s had three chances to fall in love in Bachelor Nation, she&#39;s never had the opportunity to be the lead of her own show, on her own terms. Rachel has the charisma and good intentions to carry a Bachelorette season on her own. After everything she&#39;s been through, Rachel should star in her own season of The Bachelorette.
