 Southern Charm Season 9 Reunion Trailer 

 

The trailer for the Southern Charm season 9 reunion was uploaded by the Instagram account Queens Of Bravo a week before part 1 of the reunion aired. It begins with the cast getting ready to start filming, only for Shep&#39;s phone to go off right before they start. The trailer begins with light-hearted topics like JT wanting to &#34;perform the first-ever f**k boy exorcism&#34; on Austen and Shep&#39;s strange revelation that offered a not-so-great-behind-the-scenes look into his and Taylor&#39;s former intimate life. However, Southern Charm newbie JT did start the reunion trailer with a bang, calling Austen out again for manipulating, gaslighting, and being a &#34;narcissist ego-maniac.&#34;




Shep then starts to open up about his feelings towards the Austen, Taylor, and Olivia drama. He reveals that he was very hurt by it; Venita chimes in and turns to Austen to say, &#34;Have you given him a sincere apology?&#34; Shep even admits he may still have some lingering feelings for Taylor. There was also some talk about Craig and his Summer House girlfriend Paige DeSorbo potentially moving to Charleston. When Andy asked Craig about this, Madison chimed in and said, &#34;No.&#34; However, not much else was said by him in the trailer, so viewers will have to wait for the reunion to find out.

Towards the end of the trailer, the Olivia and Taylor drama begins. Olivia calls Austen&#39;s character &#34;inconsistent&#34; and mentions how she was going through a lot while filming. Andy then asks Olivia what she needs to hear for Taylor to move forward, but the trailer ends there. The Southern Charm reunion looks captivating already.



The Southern Charm season 9 reunion part 1 airs January 11 at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
