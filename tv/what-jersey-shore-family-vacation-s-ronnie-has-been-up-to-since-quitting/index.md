## Literature Review
Jersey Shore: Family Vacation alum Ronnie stopped filming the show in 2021 after he was arrested for a domestic violence incident. What&#39;s he up to?




Although he was one of the original roommates, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro has not appeared on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation in over a year. In 2021, the former Jersey Shore star announced he’d be stepping back from filming the show. Since his departure, Ronnie has only appeared in one episode of the hit spinoff series. The short segment featured a lunch between him and Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino.




In April 2021, Ronnie was arrested for a domestic violence incident. Police were called to his home after a fight with his then-girlfriend Saffire Matos allegedly turned physical. Following the arrest, Ronnie and Saffire went quiet on social media for quite some time. While many assumed that the two had split up following his arrest, Ronnie and Saffire stayed together. Not long after the arrest, Ronnie announced that he would be stepping away from filming for the show to focus more on his mental health.

One month after Ronnie announced that he would no longer be filming for Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Ronnie shockingly proposed to Saffire. The two were seemingly excited to plan their future together; however, the engagement did not last long. The couple allegedly ended their engagement in July 2023, according to People. Since the breakup, Ronnie has been focusing his time on his sobriety, mental health, and raising his daughter, Arianna, whom he shares with his ex, Jenn Harley.






 Ronnie Is Still Active On Social Media 

 

Although Ronnie has remained out of the spotlight since leaving the show, he has stayed relatively active on social media. Often, Ronnie will post old photos of himself alongside his former roommates. When Ronnie first announced that he was leaving the show, he was uncertain whether he would eventually return to filming. The short teaser for Jersey Shore Family Vacation season 7 seemingly confirmed that Ronnie will not return to Jersey Shore, as he was not seen in any of the clips from the upcoming new episodes.

While Ronnie was not in any of the promos or the teaser for Jersey Shore: Family Vacation season 7, there is still a possibility that he will return to the show, if only in cameo appearances. When he sat down with Mike during the last season, Ronnie mentioned wanting to talk to the other roommates in the near future. However, with Sammi Giancola&#39;s return, this seems unlikely.
