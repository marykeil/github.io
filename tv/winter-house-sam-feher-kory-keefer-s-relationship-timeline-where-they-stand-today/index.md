## Literature Review
Sam Feher and Kory Keefer&#39;s relationship was shown quite a bit during the last few episodes of Winter House. Here is the timeline of their romance. 




Sam Feher and Kory Keefer&#39;s relationship has been going strong since appearing on Winter House. The new couple met last summer when Kory visited his friends while they were filming Summer House season 7. The pair immediately hit it off and were attached at the hip for the entire summer. Sam joined the cast of Summer House season 7 alongside Gabby Prescod and Chris Leoni. Kory also became a part of the cast halfway through the season but only joined as a friend of the housemates. What was only meant to be a fun hook-up, Sam and Kory ended up leaving the house together.




Even though Sam and Kory&#39;s relationship was up in the air following Summer House season 7, the two did see each other after filming wrapped. However, they were never an official couple, which Kory made clear when he was filming Winter House season 3. Several of his female castmates, including Malia White and Jordan Emanuel, inquired about Kory&#39;s relationship status several times. Kory made it seem like he and Sam weren&#39;t serious and that it was more of a casual relationship rather than a serious one. However, since then, it seems Sam and Kory have finally made their relationship official.

 Sam &amp; Kory Met On Summer House Season 7 
          




Sam and Kory began developing a relationship while filming Summer House season 7. Sam was announced as one of the full-time cast members a year ago, along with two other newbies and the rest of the returning cast from season 6. In the house, Sam immediately became close with Lindsay Hubbard and her fellow newcomer, Gabby. When Kory came to the summer house for a visit, he and Sam quickly became close. They filmed several one-on-one scenes together, were always playing around, and even joked about spitting in each other&#39;s mouths. Sam and Kory were clearly a match made in Bravo heaven.



 They Were Dating For Several Months When Kory Was On Winter House 
          

Before anything was official between Sam and Kory, the pair were in what the younger generation likes to call a &#34;situationship&#34; for eight months. What this means is Sam and Kory were dating, but they didn&#39;t call each other boyfriend or girlfriend. Kory even said, while filming Winter House season 3 in March 2023, that he and Sam were in a &#34;gray area&#34; in their relationship. Despite dating Sam, Kory was unclear about where they stood overall; could he hook up with other girls or not? Nonetheless, Kory restrained himself and was faithful to Sam the entire time. She even popped in for a visit towards the end of the season.






 They Became Official In April 2023 
         

Shortly after filming Winter House season 3 in March, Sam and Kory made their relationship official; they were finally calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend. During an interview with Page Six, Sam confirmed the status of her and Kory&#39;s romance and how it had been going so far. &#34;Kory’s my boyfriend!&#34; she said in the interview. &#34;That is so weird. I haven’t had a boyfriend in so long!&#34; Sam added. At the time, Sam said she and Kory had recently made their relationship official, so it&#39;s likely that they decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend after filming wrapped for Winter House season 3.



 Sam Admitted Winter House Put A &#34;Strain&#34; On Their Relationship 
          




Even though Sam and Kory are in a good place now, Winter House did impact their relationship. During the Winter House season 3 reunion, which aired as a Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen special on Tuesday night after the season finale, Sam admitted the show did put a &#34;strain&#34; on their relationship. Andy then asked Sam if anything from the show &#34;annoyed&#34; her in terms of Kory.

Sam confessed that she was “pissed” by Kory and Malia&#39;s seemingly flirty relationship. &#34;It’s not like I’m not mad at Kory. Like, what a f***ing strain it has put on our relationship,&#34; Sam admitted. However, Kory did take some responsibility by admitting that he &#34;was trying to have a girl that wasn’t official and flirt with all the girls.&#34;



 Are Sam &amp; Kory Still Together? 

 




Sam and Kory are still together following their time on Winter House. They confirmed at the reunion that they were still in a relationship. Sam and Kory haven&#39;t been posting a lot online together, but they have shared several vlogs, which can be seen on Sam&#39;s Instagram page. Overall, it seems Sam and Kory are still going strong. Maybe viewers will get to see more of their relationship in the upcoming Summer House season 8.



All episodes of Winter House are now streaming on Peacock.
