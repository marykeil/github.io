# The Simpsons 3 Different Versions Of The Devil Explained 


## SUMMARY 


 The Simpsons has had three contradictory versions of the devil in its canon for over two decades, ignoring continuity for the sake of humor. 
 The first devil featured in early seasons resembled Herman, a character from Springfield, and appeared in two non-canon episodes. 
 In a Halloween special, Ned Flanders was revealed to be the devil, but the show later introduced a more traditional muscular version of the devil.

## Literature Review
The Simpsons has introduced viewers to three different, contradictory versions of The Devil, all of whom seem to co-exist in the show&#39;s universe.




In its 35 years on the air, The Simpsons has introduced three contradictory versions of the Devil into the show’s fictional universe. The Simpsons isn’t exactly fastidious when it comes to the show’s canon. After over 750 episodes, any series would inevitably run into some plot holes, but The Simpsons goes out of its way to ignore continuity in favor of humor. Details like a character’s backstory, birthdate, or even whether they are alive or dead can change from episode to episode without warning in the chaotic animated sitcom. However, even within this context, the show’s history with the devil is bizarre.
While The Simpsons season 36 might change this, the series has had three distinct, contradictory versions of the devil co-existing in its canon for over two decades now. Early seasons of The Simpsons featured a few appearances from a sinister version of the devil who was genuinely creepy, as befits the show’s darker, more cynical tone in this era. This take on Lucifer was replaced by the seemingly pious Ned Flanders as the show entered its faster-paced, more anarchic, and goofier Golden Age. Finally, the end of the Golden Age of The Simpsons brought with it a new, more traditional vision of the devil that has persisted since.









 








 3  The First Devil In The Simpsons Is A Herman Lookalike 
The Simpsons featured a relatively consistent, canon-confirmed devil early on
        

The Simpsons has never been clear on what the devil looks like in the series, but the first few seasons did stick with one design. The Simpsons introduced Bart to the devil in season 2, episode 10, “Bart Gets Hit By a Car” via a near-death experience. Bart was involved in a car accident and traveled to Hell, briefly conversing with the Prince of Darkness. This bug-eyed version of the villain looks like Springfield’s resident antiques dealer/jeans smuggler Herman and he appears again in episode 13, “Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment.”
This take on the devil hasn’t been seen in the series for a while, but he still graced the promotional art of season 34. Not only that, but the Herman lookalike is also the only version of the devil featured in two episodes that aren’t Treehouse of Horror specials, whereas the other versions of the devil mainly appear in non-canon Halloween outings. However, even this devil only appears in hallucinations, fantasy segues, and dreams, so there is no way of saying whether he is the “Real” devil of The Simpsons. Considering how characters like Homer have changed a lot over the years, there is no reason to think the devil hasn’t.





 2  Treehouse of Horror VI’s Devil Is Ned Flanders

The devil got an even more substantial role in season 5, episode 5, &#34;Treehouse of Horror IV,” when he was revealed to Ned Flanders. In an ironic twist, Homer’s holier-than-thou neighbor had literally been the devil in disguise all along, and Devil Flanders tempted Homer into selling his soul for a doughnut. Although Ned played the devil well in this Treehouse of Horror segment, he ended up losing a battle for Homer’s eternal fate to Marge when she successfully proved that she owned her husband’s soul thanks to their marriage vows. Since then, Devil Flanders hasn’t appeared in the series, although this segment remains a fan favorite.





 1  Treehouse of Horror XI’s Satan Is A More Traditional Devil 
Later Treehouse of Horror episodes made the Devil a more muscular monster
        

After The Simpsons established both its original devil and Devil Flanders, the show’s relationship with the character got even stranger. In season 7, episode 6, “Treehouse of Horror VI,” a giant advertisement depicting the devil came to life, but this character design resurfaced years later and became the show’s new version of the devil. After Homer and Ned’s escapades in season 5, the devil returned with a new face in season 12, episode 1, “Treehouse of Horror XI.” This special’s opening segment “G-G-Ghost D-D-Dad” ended with Homer damned to hell for eternity, where he was met by this musclebound version of the devil who immediately started to noogie him.
This take of the character appeared again in season 23, episode 3, “Treehouse of Horror XXII,” and this is the version of the devil that is typically utilized when the show depicts props, inflatables, or costumes of Satan. However, later episodes like season 28, episode 2, “Friends and Family,” still featured the Herman lookalike as their devil, while in season 5, episode 21, “Lady Bouvier’s Lover,” a character that looks vaguely like the muscular version of the devil is seen shaking hands with Mr. Burns in a photo. Thanks to this confusing timeline, it&#39;s difficult to determine which of the three devils seen in The Simpsons is the real deal.
