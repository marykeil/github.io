## Literature Review
In a sneak peek from an upcoming episode of 1000-lb Sisters, Amy Slaton takes her anger to a rage room while her sister Tammy Slaton stands by.




1000-lb Sisters star Amy Slaton is releasing her rage alongside her sister Tammy Slaton over her divorce from Michael Halterman and the breakdown of their family in an exclusive new clip from the next episode of the series. While Amy has been with Michael for the better part of the last decade, their relationship has taken a turn in the last couple of years after the birth of their second son, Glenn. After Amy&#39;s weight loss surgery in 2020 was successful, the couple quickly welcomed their first son, Gage, and despite the strain having a child put on their marriage, Amy found herself pregnant a second time in 2021.




In an exclusive clip from the next episode of 1000-lb Sisters, Amy and Tammy are shown at a rage room. The sisters, both equipped with sledgehammers, took their anger out on some broken electronics and furniture, Amy going hard on a few windows and bookshelves before she broke down in tears. &#34;That was the whole point of doing this,&#34; Tammy reminded her gently as Amy sobbed over the loss of her marriage to Michael. Throughout 1000-lb Sisters season 5, Amy&#39;s marriage has been crumbling.


 

In an interview segment, Amy explains the pain she&#39;s going through with her marriage splintering beyond her control. &#34;For a long time, I didn&#39;t think anything was possible. I didn&#39;t think I was gonna get married, I didn&#39;t think I was gonna have kids,&#34; Amy explained through tears.&#34;But that&#39;s something I wanted. I&#39;m the one who went through weight loss surgery to have my babies. I&#39;m the one that made my family a family. I&#39;m the one who fought tooth and nail for my babies, and now it&#39;s all falling apart.&#34;

 How Is Amy Slaton Handling Her Divorce On 1000-Lb Sisters? 
          

While Amy&#39;s family has been doing their best to help her cope with the stress of young motherhood amidst marital issues, things have been getting more and more difficult with each passing episode of 1000-lb Sisters season 5. Amy, who has been doing everything in her power to take care of her sons without much help from Michael, shared that she doesn&#39;t &#34;know where it all went wrong&#34; in the preview clip for the upcoming episode. After doing her best to get healthier in order to have a family of her own, Amy expected to find support from her husband once their children were born.





 

Once Glenn was born, Amy quickly realized that she was taking care of things on her own and felt in over her head as she turned to her family for help. During earlier episodes of 1000-lb Sisters season 5, Amy&#39;s sisters visited and expressed their concerns that she was dealing with post-partum depression, explaining to Michael that he needed to help out with the kids so Amy would have time to herself. Running on high emotion, Amy appears to be coping with the extreme stress she&#39;s under the best that she can, but will need help if she&#39;s going to make it through such a difficult time.

While Amy may be dealing with some of the toughest times of her life, she&#39;s proven time and time again that she can deal with the difficulties life throws at her. From getting in shape in order to have weight loss surgery to dealing with two back-to-back pregnancies that have caused her mental and physical pain, Amy&#39;s equipped to handle the toughest ordeals. While it&#39;s hard to see her go through such turmoil, Amy&#39;s shown everything on 1000-lb Sisters and will continue to share her story with viewers who are inspired by her strength.
