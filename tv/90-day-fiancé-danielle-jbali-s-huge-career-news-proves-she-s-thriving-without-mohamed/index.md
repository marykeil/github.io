## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 2 cast member Danielle Mullins surprises fans with her success story while proving she&#39;s over her Tunisian ex Mohamed Jbali.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Danielle Mullins Jbali celebrated a major career success after she moved on from ex Mohamed Jbali. Danielle is best remembered for being one of the original drama queens of the franchise after she starred in 90 Day Fiancé season 2 with Tunisian man Mohamed. Daniele, 49, had an uncomfortable age gap with 28-year-old Mohamed when they got married in July 2014. Daniele had met Mohamed in a chat room. He seemed uninterested in pursuing any romance with Daniele when he came to the U.S., which made Mohamed&#39;s real intentions clear. He reportedly got his Green Card 14 months after the marriage, and two months later, Mohamed ended up leaving Danielle.




While this happened almost a decade ago, Danielle is now a changed woman.


 

The same woman who endlessly tried to get Mohamed deported from the U.S. is now working hard to achieve her dream of becoming a registered nurse. Danielle is almost there as she only has 11 months left until she completes her RN program. &#34;Tonight was my lamp ceremony for the RN program,&#34; she wrote in her caption as she posed for a photo in her nursing outfit and holding a lamp. She explained how the ceremony &#34;marks the halfway point in the program&#34; for her. Danielle also shared a video.


 Is This The End Of Danielle Jbali&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Career? 
          




The lamp lighting and pinning ceremony is a tribute to Florence Nightingale, also known as the &#34;Lady with the Lamp.&#34; She is recognized as the founder of modern nursing. Danielle graduated from nursing school in November 2021. Her grades were impressive, receiving only A&#39;s and B&#39;s. Still, Daniele&#39;s claims that she was a nurse were questioned. She lashed out at those who said she was developmentally delayed, on the spectrum, and awkward. Danielle said that giggling a lot when she was nervous, and crying when she was hurt, did not mean she was developmentally delayed.

Danielle reminded fans that they see only 10 minutes of her life each week and don’t see her living her everyday life. Danielle was last seen in 90 Day: The Single Life season 1. It was the first time she came face-to-face with Mohamed since their divorce in 2017. Danielle claimed she and Mohamed were trying to build a friendship. Meanwhile, Danielle struggled to date other people because of her past. She finally got along with a man named Robert. He even met her for a second date at her house. However, Danielle&#39;s romance with Robert might not have worked out since he did not appear in her Instagram posts after the season ended.




Danielle never gave dating another try in 90 Day Fiancé season 2 and has stayed away from the franchise since then. Danielle could be done with reality TV for the time being. She&#39;s choosing to focus on her nursing career as it truly makes her happy, and she&#39;s excelling at it. Danielle had a criminal past involving bad checks and credit card fraud, which she hid from Mohamed. With a new and flourishing career, Danielle might not face any financial difficulties now. However, she would likely receive even more praise if she returned to the small screen.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
