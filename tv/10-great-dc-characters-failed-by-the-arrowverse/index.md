# 10 Great DC Characters Failed By The Arrowverse


## SUMMARY 


 The Arrowverse missed opportunities to properly develop and showcase certain characters, like Ronnie Raymond (Firestorm) and Hartley Rathaway (The Pied Piper). 
 Characters like Booster Gold and Batman were introduced but never fully explored or given their own stories in the Arrowverse. 
 Despite having potential, characters like Red Tornado and Hawkgirl were underused and didn&#39;t reach their full potential in the Arrowverse.

## Literature Review
The Arrowverse did a great job overall fleshing out its many characters, but some appearances of DC&#39;s best heroes left much to be desired.




The Arrowverse was in a unique position to provide years of development for its licensed DC characters, yet dropped the ball on properly characterizing a significant minority of major characters. Across 37 seasons of 6 distinct different shows, The CW&#39;s shared TV universe managed to tell some truly compelling stories within the framework of network series. However, looking back on the Arrowverse, not every prominent character was done justice by the end of their respective show, leaving some significant missed potential on the table.
From the grounded, street-level escapades of Arrow to the universe-spanning grand adventures of Legends of Tomorrow, the Arrowverse didn&#39;t always do justice to certain members of their ensemble cast. Sometimes, elements beyond The CW&#39;s control, such as personal or scheduling issues with actors prevented the universe&#39;s characters from getting a chance to be fully fleshed out. Other times, plain neglect on behalf of the writers saw staple DC characters left in the dust in terms of character development, progression, or raw screen time.









 








 10  Ronnie Raymond 
The Flash
        

Appearing as early as The Flash season one, Ronnie Raymond had once served as half of the dual consciousness that formed the hero Firestorm. Conjoined with Professor Stein in a freak accident regarding the S.T.A.R. labs particle accelerator, Ronnie showed promise as one half of Firestorm, only to be killed in a dramatic sacrifice. Not only did Ronnie not get enough time to shine as the face of Firestorm, but he was utterly replaced by Jefferson Jackson, who went on to make many appearances in both The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow.





 9  Booster Gold 
Legends of Tomorrow
        

At first, Mike was simply an unassuming comedic side character in Legends of Tomorrow. But like most of the Arrowverse&#39;s unpowered cast at some point or another, Mike would turn out to be a hero himself, the Time Police member and futuristic peacekeeper, Booster Gold. Unfortunately, this reveal was only made during Legends of Tomorrow&#39;s season 7 finale, and the series was canceled before the implications of Mike as Booster Gold could be properly explored.





 8  Batman 
Batwoman


 







For the longest time, The Dark Knight himself was the ever-present elephant in the room of the Arrowverse, always just barely alluded to off-screen with throwaway mentions of Gotham City as early as Arrow. When Batwoman premiered, Arrowverse fans were eager to get a look at how The CW would imagine Batman, only to be disappointed to learn that the series&#39; Batman had long been retired from the superhero game. Considering the Arrowverse was eventually willing to present their own vision of Superman, with Tyler Hoechlin&#39;s excellent portrayal, it&#39;s doubly upsetting that DC&#39;s most iconic hero was never seen in action.





 7  The Pied Piper 
The Flash
        

Hartley Rathaway was primarily remembered for being a throwaway antagonist in The Flash&#39;s first season, during the series&#39; more procedural days, as a villain-of-the-week. When The Pied Piper got the chance to reconcile with Team Flash, the chance was ultimately wasted as the character returned to a life of crime. As The Pied Piper fully converts to the side of justice in the original comics, its extra disappointing that Hartley didn&#39;t get his chance to shine as a true hero.





 6  Red Tornado 
Supergirl
        

In the comics, Red Tornado isn&#39;t exactly an issue-seller as a standalone hero, but works excellently as a supporting member, or even leader, of any super-team. DC&#39;s answer to Marvel&#39;s vision, the aerokinetic android only had a couple of brief appearances in the Arrowverse, first debuting as a disposable villain whose job it was to lose to Supergirl. It&#39;s bad enough to retcon Red Tornado into a bad guy, but downplaying his abilities by depicting him as mass-manufactured canon fodder adds insult to injury.





 5  Mr. Terrific 
Arrow


 







In the DC Comics, Mr. Terrific is almost analogous to Tony Stark, serving as one of the smartest men on the planet and a powerful hero in his own right. When Arrow&#39;s cast made the addition of tech genius Curtis Holt showed signs of transforming into the gadget-slinging vigilante, fans were excited to see Mr. Terrific unfold as a force to be reckoned with. Tragically, Holt never seemed to be able to step out of the shadow of Green Arrow, acting as more of a support-based subordinate of Oliver rather than a capable crime fighter in his own right.





 4  Hawkgirl 
Legends of Tomorrow
        

For a time, Hawkgirl was part of the Justice League&#39;s starting roster in pop culture, and her appearance in Legends of Tomorrow excited the character&#39;s scant fans with the promise of a return to those days. But when Kendra Saunders was introduced, she spent half of her time serving mostly as Cisco Ramon&#39;s love interest, only coming into her own as Hawkgirl later on. Even worse, she inexplicably disappears from the cast of Legends of Tomorrow after the defeat of Vandal Savage, going criminally underused throughout the course of the series.





 3  Huntress 
Arrow
        

As a crossbow-wielding rogue vigilante who acts as a sort of Punisher to Green Arrow&#39;s Daredevil, Huntress was a natural fit for a recurring character in Arrow. The vengeance-obsessed Helena Bertinelli made a few appearances throughout the show, but as time marched on, her presence was felt less and less, the deserving redemption arc fans yearned for forever out of reach. It seems as though the development of Huntress&#39; return was constantly left on the backburner, due to the chronic unavailability of actress Jessica De Gouw.





 2  Wally West 
The Flash


 







As Kid Flash, Wally West got a healthy amount of screen-time in the Arrowverse, learning from Barry as an intrepid sidekick and qualified hero in his own right. Though many fans anticipated Wally&#39;s deserved acceptance of The Flash&#39;s proper title, as he had in the comics, CW&#39;s The Flash strangely chose to peter out Wally&#39;s story on an unsatisfying leave of absence, the young hero departing to travel the world in order to deepen his connection to the Speed Force. Considering Wally winds up surpassing even Barry&#39;s connection to the Speed Force in the comics, it&#39;s a shame this plotline never went anywhere significant.





 1  Arsenal 
Arrow
        

Roy Harper was introduced early on in Arrow, quickly becoming the crimson archer, Arsenal, similar to his comics counterpart. Unlike DC&#39;s source material, however, the Arrowverse&#39;s Arsenal never managed to prove himself outside of Oliver&#39;s influence. Much like Mr. Terrific, Arsenal goes on to become a capable solo hero in the comics, but Arrow never let Arsenal truly spread his wings. While much of the characters&#39; later absence can be attributed to actor Colton Hayne&#39;s very valid personal choice to consciously step away from the role, there&#39;s no denying that what showings Arsenal did get in the Arrowverse were disappointing.
