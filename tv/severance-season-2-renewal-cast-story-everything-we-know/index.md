## Literature Review
Here&#39;s what we know about Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Severance season 2, including returning cast, release info, and plot threads from the season 1 finale.




Severance season 2 is on the way to Apple TV&#43;, and despite being delayed, the second outing is taking shape. Created by Dan Erickson and produced by Ben Stiller, the first season of Severance ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, which set up season 2. Severance gradually revealed its dystopian science fiction world, in which the cult-like Lumon Corporation uses a technology called Severance to separate an employee&#39;s memories and personalities into two: an innie for the workplace, and an outie for the outside world, with both having no access to the other&#39;s experiences.




Severance was a breakout success for Apple TV&#43;, thanks in no small part to the intriguing and mysterious premise spawning several Severance fan theories. Severance saw the four severed innies of the Macro-Data Refinement department grow more curious and resentful of the system they are a part of. However, the story&#39;s first chapter was clearly just the beginning, as nothing was close to being resolved where the show left off, meaning anticipation for the delayed Severance season 2 remains incredibly high.

 Severance Season 2: Latest News 
          

Despite being confirmed for all of 2023, news was scant due to the Hollywood strike which brought the industry to a halt. Now, producer Ben Stiller has confirmed that Severance season 2 is in active production. Like most shows and movies, the double whammy of the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strikes put Severance on hold, and the actor/producer took to social media to follow up on a cryptic post from Apple TV which suggested Severance news was on the horizon. Though Stiller didn&#39;t provide any details, season 2 is still coming. 





 



 The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.

 Severance Season 2 Story 
          

There haven&#39;t been any concrete reveals regarding the Severance season 2 story, but the first season left some teases to set it up. The final episode of Severance season 1 sees the innies gain control of themselves outside the office using the Overtime Contingency built into their Lumon Severance Chips. Their actions in the world will be hard to undo, and Severance season 2 is likely to see Lumon trying to respond to MDR&#39;s rebellion without compromising their outies.




There are also several mysteries surrounding Lumon that Severance season 2 could shed more light on. These include what happened to Mark&#39;s wife Gemma, who reappeared in the Lumon workspace as Ms. Casey, and the company&#39;s larger ambitions with the Severance Chips. Severance season 2 could also explore more of its outies&#39; lives, including the bizarre clues regarding Irving&#39;s outside life. Moreover, in Severance creator Dan Erickson&#39;s Reddit AMA on April 2022, Erickson implied that Helena Eagan would be the villain of Severance season 2.

               Severance   Summary:   From director and executive producer Ben Stiller and creator Dan Erickson comes “Severance.” Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.
