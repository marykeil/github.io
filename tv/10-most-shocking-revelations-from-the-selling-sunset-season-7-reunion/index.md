## Literature Review
The Selling Sunset season 7 reunion aired with some surprising twists. Here are the most shocking revelations from the reunion.




Selling Sunset season 7 was so filled with twists and turns that a reunion was called for, and shocking revelations were made during the episode. Hosted by Queer Eye&#39;s Tan France, the women of the Beverly Hills office, alongside a brief appearance from agents from Selling the OC, didn&#39;t hold back from addressing the drama of the previous seasons. Not even Jason and Brett Oppenheim were spared, though Brett, as usual, came out relatively unscathed.
There was a long list of drama and fights from Selling Sunset season 7. Chrishell Stause and Nicole Young may never lay their feud to rest, Chelsea Lazkani can&#39;t stop offending Bre Tiesi, and Amanza Smith lost money and friendship due to a video message to Chrishell. Meanwhile, Jason and Marie-Lou Nurk&#39;s relationship became strained because of Chrishell, and Mary and Romain Bonnet tragically lost a pregnancy. With so much to unpack, it&#39;s no wonder the reunion went off the rails.









 








 1  Nicole Defending Her Homophobic Comments

One of the first explosive moments occurred when Nicole defended herself, claiming she wasn&#39;t homophobic after she liked and responded to the Instagram comment, &#34;I was hoping the lesbian chick was off in Australia this season and not on our screens. Whatever her name is, I forgot. Nicole you look great!&#34; While Nicole simply said she was responding to the fan&#39;s support, not to address the homophobia wasn&#39;t a great look. This interaction and more prompted Chrishell to tell Nicole at the reunion that she hates her.





 2  Chelsea Revealed She Hasn&#39;t Spoken To Cassandra Since The Office Party 


 







Chelsea got quite friendly with Cassandra Dawn, a former Playboy model turned real estate agent, much to the chagrin of her nemesis, Bre. However, Chelsea said she hadn&#39;t spoken to Cassandra since the office party. While there was speculation Cassandra would join the Oppenheim Group, her closest O Group pal not talking to her in months doesn&#39;t bode well for her potential at the most coveted real estate agency in Los Angeles.





 3  The Oppenheim Group Only Gives Agents a 50-70% Split 
        






 4   
In her heated conversation with Jason, Bre addressed the commission split at the Oppenheim Group. While she was used to a 90/10 split, Jason maintained a staunch stance on the split at the O Group, which he maintained at the time was 80/20. However, at the reunion, it was revealed that the agents receive anywhere between a 50/50 and 70/30 split, depending on how long they&#39;ve been there and their standing at the brokerage. The twins argued that their reputations and listings make up for the lesser split.





 5  Marie-Lou And Jason&#39;s Break Up 
        






 6   
After all the drama on Selling Sunset season 7, Marie-Lou and Jason aren&#39;t even together anymore. They broke up in May 2023, and Jason said he&#39;s currently dating a woman from Vancouver who will turn 30 in just a few weeks. Marie-Lou turned up to try to insult and embarrass Chrishell, who wasn&#39;t having it.





 7  Chrishell and G Flip Are Taking Steps To Have A Baby 
        

Chrishell revealed that she and G Flip had already renewed their vows. When asked if she and G were taking steps to become parents, Chrishell answered honestly that she and her spouse were embarking on the journey. While she couldn&#39;t give any more details, it&#39;s exciting that amidst all the drama, Chrishell will hopefully become a mother.





 8  Chrishell Doesn&#39;t Trust Amanza 
        






 9   
In a fun twist, Tan called in a polygraph expert to test the O Group&#39;s truthfulness. While asking some innocuous questions, there were also some zingers thrown in. After Amanza&#39;s video message and meddling in her fellow agents&#39; business this season, it was clear the pair tried to make amends. However, when Chrishell was asked if she trusted Amanza and said yes, the polygraph expert detected a lie.





 10  Jason Might Still Be In Love With Chrishell 
        

Similarly, when Jason was asked if he was still in love with Chrishell and answered that no, he wasn&#39;t &#34;in love,&#34; a lie was detected. His love for Chrishell must be excruciating now that she&#39;s so happy with G Flip, and they&#39;re pursuing having a baby together. Chrishell and Jason had a happy relationship, but Jason didn&#39;t want to have children, and becoming a mother was important to Chrishell.





 11  Amanda and Jason Once Hooked Up 
        






 12   
Jason has seemingly dated half his office by now, so much so that his history has become a joke. However, when asked if he had slept with anyone else from the O Group, and he said no, Chelsea detected a lie. Without even being hooked up to the lie detector, Amanza admitted to having kissed and hooked up with Jason. The pair have been friends for over two decades, which was Amanza&#39;s defense.





 13  Selling The OC&#39;s Tyler Blocked Alex Hall On Instagram 
        

The Selling the OC cast briefly appeared in a bizarre cut. Aside from Brandi Marshall and Alex Hall&#39;s brief spat, the main tea the cast spilled was Tyler Stanaland&#39;s departure from the OC office. He left to work for his father, a real estate mogul in his own right, and blocked Alex on social media in the process. While the two had an ongoing flirtationship in Selling the OC, it appears any possible relationship on their part has sailed.





 14  Chrishell and Amanza&#39;s Feud Is Ongoing 


 







Lastly, while it would seem Chrishell and Amanza would be two of the more amenable agents in the office, their feud is ongoing. The pair engaged in an onscreen spat regarding payment for G Flip&#39;s project that never came to fruition, with Amanza feeling shorted and Chrishell asserting her dominance. The women clearly want to be friends but have some deep-seated issues that need to be worked out offscreen. While not the most shocking revelation of the day, it is the most disheartening. Hopefully, these Oppenheim Group mainstays can resolve their issues before Selling Sunset season 8.
