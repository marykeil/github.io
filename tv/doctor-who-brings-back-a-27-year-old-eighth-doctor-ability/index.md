# Doctor Who Brings Back A 27-Year-Old Eighth Doctor Ability


## SUMMARY 



  The Eighth Doctor showcased his ability to predict details about the future due to the Time Lord&#39;s time-sensitivity.   The Fifteenth Doctor, played by Ncuti Gatwa, displayed a similar psychic ability in his first full episode.   This revived aspect of the Doctor&#39;s character may suggest that future episodes will further explore this time-sensitivity skill further.

## Literature Review
27 years later, Doctor Who is bringing back a long-forgotten ability of the Eighth Doctor, which was last properly seen in the 1996 Doctor Who movie.





Summary

  The Eighth Doctor showcased his ability to predict details about the future due to the Time Lord&#39;s time-sensitivity.   The Fifteenth Doctor, played by Ncuti Gatwa, displayed a similar psychic ability in his first full episode.   This revived aspect of the Doctor&#39;s character may suggest that future episodes will further explore this time-sensitivity skill further.  







Doctor Who&#39;s &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; was the first full episode featuring the recently introduced Fifteenth Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa), and one moment fascinatingly resembled a 27-year-old ability of the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann). While the Eighth Doctor only appeared in the Doctor Who 1996 movie, McGann&#39;s portrayal of the Doctor still stands proudly in the talented list of his predecessors. Doctor Who season 14 is due to air in May 2024, also to be known as the new season 1 of the show, with Russell T Davies returning to the role of showrunner after his departure in 2009.

Gatwa&#39;s first full episode aired on December 25, 2023, after the actor made his first appearance in the 60th anniversary special &#34;The Giggle.&#34; &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; also introduced new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson). In one interesting interaction, the Fifteenth Doctor showed similarities to a previous incarnation of his. While no Doctor is the same, there are times the Time Lord reminds audiences that each version of them is indeed connected.

 The Eighth Doctor&#39;s Time Sensitivity Gave Him An Unusual Power 
This Doctor Had The Best Presentation Of A Long-Forgotten Time Lord Ability
          

Although the Eighth Doctor&#39;s main adventure took place in the 1996 Doctor Who movie, the character was developed further through several Big Finish audio dramas, as well as Doctor Who prose stories. He was established to be more time sensitive than his previous incarnations, and in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novelization &#34;Camera Obscura,&#34; he is reported as having a time-sensitive heart. While all Time Lords have some level of time sensitivity, the Eighth Doctor made his more obvious than others. The Eighth Doctor had the ability to feel out things before they were due to happen — an almost psychic ability — and was able to predict details about people&#39;s futures.






 Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Prediction Feels So Similar 
The Fifteenth Doctor&#39;s First Full Episode Echoed A Great Eighth Doctor Moment
          

In his first episode, the Fifteenth Doctor crosses paths with a police officer, who witnesses the Time Lord emerging from the collapsed head of a large snowman decoration. In the midst of the conversation, he tells the officer, &#34;She&#39;s going to say yes, when you ask her to marry you on Christmas Day.&#34; When asked how he predicted this, the Doctor claims that the sonic screwdriver pinged, alerting him to the fact. However, there is no sound, which only proves the Doctor&#39;s slightly psychic abilities even more. In a post on Twitter, fans were quick to point out the similarities in this scene with one from the movie.

Crossing paths with Gareth Fitzpatrick (Jeremy Radick), a local student and security guard for the Institute for Technological Advancement and Research in San Francisco, the Eighth Doctor gives some advice to the young man in regard to his upcoming exam. He tells him, &#34;Answer the second question on your midterm exam, not the third.&#34; The two scenes have such familiarity, and it would seem that Doctor Who is reviving this long-forgotten detail about the Doctor. The likeness between the two suggests that future episodes of Doctor Who will see the Doctor execute this time-sensitivity skill more often, which could be very useful in all manner of adventures.
