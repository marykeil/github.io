Beginning in 2017, Summer House centered on a group of friends who spend Memorial Day through Labor Day together in an incredible beach house in The Hamptons.

Filming for the Bravo series started over the summer of 2023 and ended shortly after Labor Day weekend. According to US Weekly, Lindsay confirmed production for the show had resumed in July 2023 when in Washington, D.C. Cast members Paige DeSorbo and Amanda Batula have also shared photos and videos from what appeared to be the Summer House backyard. This is likely, given their participation in past seasons.

 Summer House Season 8 Trailer 

 

Bravo dropped the Summer House season 8 trailer on January 11, along with the release date. The three-minute-long trailer starts with Lindsay and Carl having a heated discussion about their relationship. Lindsay then calls Gabby, where she says Carl wants to end the relationship, admitting that she was &#34;blindsided,&#34; which Carl predicted she would say. Then the trailer moves into the fun and games portion while introducing Jesse and Wes to the cast. Wes admits he&#39;s vibing with Ciara, while Jesse is seen aggressively hitting on Paige, who is in a relationship with Southern Charm&#39;s Craig Conover. 

Amanda and Kyle are seen fighting (again) while Lindsay talks about hoping she&#39;s pregnant by next summer. The trailer then gets into the downfall of Lindsay and Carl&#39;s relationship, with Carl saying Lindsay accused him of doing drugs. Then, Paige and Craig are seen fighting, along with Amanda walking away and Kyle crying. Carl is then seen talking to a minister who says he wouldn&#39;t marry Lindsay and Carl if they wanted him to. The trailer officially ends with Gabby crying but not wanting to ruin her makeup. So far, Summer House season 8 looks like a must-watch.
