## Literature Review
Southern Charm season 9 has featured some dramatic moments for the group of charmers, but Craig, Madison, &amp; Olivia&#39;s reunion looks are sure to please.




Southern Charm&#39;s Craig Conover, Madison LeCroy, and Olivia Flowers reunion looks have been revealed, and the Charmers are looking incredible to rehash the drama from Southern Charm season 9 with Andy Cohen. After a season of drama revolving around Austen Kroll, Taylor Ann Green, the Charmers are ready to sit down and discuss the issues they’ve faced throughout the season, along with the happier moments they’ve spent together. While there’s been some jaw-dropping drama throughout Southern Charm season 9, the cast has been able to navigate their issues. Though Olivia and Taylor’s problems are at the forefront, there’s plenty more for the cast to discuss during the season 9 reunion.
In a sneak peek from Bravo’s Instagram, a few of the cast members&#39; outfits have been revealed ahead of the reunion, which was filmed recently. “The name’s Charm... Southern Charm 🍸 Check out all the #SouthernCharm Reunion looks at the link in bio!” the caption of the post read.


While Craig looks dapper in a suave suit, Olivia and Madison are taking their fair share of the attention in some gorgeous dresses that are sure to wow the rest of the cast. The rest of the cast was also looking incredible for the reunion, which will hopefully help to smooth the edges of some of the larger issues they faced during Southern Charm season 9.

 1  Olivia Flowers’ Reunion Look Compared To Ariana Madix’s “Revenge Dress” 
        

While the trio’s looks aren’t the only ones available to the public, they’re the styles that the fans in Bravo’s comments have focused their attention on, and they love the styles that the Charmers have chosen. &#34;Craig is my favorite glow up on Bravo. Bravos man of the year 👏,&#34; @celebri_tea21 commented, while @sarahhalbedl shared, &#34;Madison doesn’t miss a beat 🔥.&#34; While the majority of fans commented on Craig and Madison&#39;s looks, others looked to Olivia after noticing her dress resembled Ariana Madix&#39;s Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion dress. &#34;Is Olivia reviving the revenge dress?!&#34; @calamity_jane_of_all_trades asked, while @wolffox_healthsolutions asked directly, &#34;Is that Olivia’s version of the Ariana’s “Revenge” dress?&#34;


While Olivia&#39;s dress may be reminiscent of Ariana&#39;s &#34;revenge&#34; dress, her storyline throughout Southern Charm season 9 is somewhat different than Ariana&#39;s on Vanderpump Rules season 10. After Taylor and Southern Charm original cast member Shep Rose broke up, Austen and Olivias&#39;s relationship ended as well and the women were supporting each other through their respective splits. Taylor, who has always been good friends with Austen, was accused of hooking up with him and while both vehemently denied the accusation, it came out that something had happened. Even though they&#39;ve both continued to deny anything more than a kiss, the damage to Olivia&#39;s relationship with Taylor is already done.
The Southern Charm season 9 reunion will certainly bring some of the season&#39;s biggest dramas to the forefront as Olivia has the chance to confront Taylor and Austen alongside the rest of the cast of the series. With Shep and Taylor&#39;s relationship long over, the potentially scorned feelings Olivia and Shep feel for Austen and Taylor may not be something any of them care to genuinely fix. Despite there not being much anyone can do other than being entirely honest about what&#39;s happened on Southern Charm season 9, hearing the truth may be a helpful place for the stars to begin.
