Summary

  Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 ends on Skull Island after a two-year time jump, with Kong shown near an Apex facility.   Creators Matt Fraction and Chris Black tease that Kong or another monster could be the focus of a potential season 2.   The show&#39;s ending sets up a new story involving Apex and could provide more context for movies like Godzilla vs. Kong and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.  







Monarch: Legacy of Monsters co-creators Chris Black and Matt Fraction explain the show&#39;s surprising ending and cameo. Serving as the latest installment of Legendary&#39;s Monsterverse, the Apple TV Plus series chronicles the history of Monarch and the ways in which the organization weaves itself into the lives of characters like Cate (Anna Sawai), Lee Shaw (Kurt and Wyatt Russell), May (Kiersey Clemons), and Kentaro (Ren Watabe). After an action-packed few episodes, the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters finale jumps forward two years in time and concludes with a surprise appearance from Kong himself.

Now, as audiences await news on a Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 renewal, Black and Fraction discuss the season 1 ending during a recent interview with ComicBook.com. While careful not to reveal their plans for the show&#39;s future, it sounds like Kong could certainly be a part of a potential follow-up season. Check out the comments from Black and Fraction below:


Chris Black: &#34;We don&#39;t have an order for a second season but we&#39;re optimistic, there is more story to tell here. The short answer is that the Monsterverse has a lot of monsters in it. We focused on Godzilla as the center character of season one, because it was the monster of Cate&#39;s nightmares.
&#34;There is a large cast of characters in the Toho universe and Kong is very important to the current crop of Legendary movies. I can&#39;t speak as to what that potential story might be, but Kong is a character we want to bring into our world for sure.&#34;






Matt Fraction: &#34;There&#39;s a jump, it&#39;s two years later in that last scene so MonsterVerse scholars and aficionados will be able to track what&#39;s happening in our show with the movies. We went into this show knowing that it&#39;s Legacy of Monsters&#39; plural, rather than &#39;Legacy of Monster&#39;. There&#39;s a lot of great characters that we haven&#39;t spent time with, so we thought we&#39;d go out with the tallest leading man in Hollywood.&#34;


  


 What The Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; Finale &amp; Cameo Means For A Season 2 
          

After successfully escaping the Hollow Earth, the finale ends with Cate, Keiko, and May reuniting with Kentaro. A series of surprising reveals follow, with the characters not only learning that two years have passed since they went missing, but that Kentaro and Tim (Joe Tippett) now work for Apex, which is run by May&#39;s old boss, Brenda (Dominique Tipper). What&#39;s more, the characters are all at an Apex facility on Skull Island, with an angry-looking Kong then emerging from the trees. 




In the larger Legendary Monsterverse timeline, the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters finale takes place before the events of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which takes place in 2019. This means that the show doesn&#39;t necessarily set up any events to come in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire or beyond, but a potential season 2 now has the opportunity to provide more context for the events of Godzilla vs. Kong.



Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will see the two titular kaijus teaming up once more to take down a new threat from the Hollow Earth known as the Skar King. The film is scheduled to release on April 12, 2024.




Specifically, a potential season 2 can now explore the rise of Apex Cybernetics. Apex essentially serves as the villain of Godzilla vs. Kong and is the company behind the creation of Mechagodzilla. One of the company&#39;s central goals in that film is to explore the Hollow Earth in search of an energy source for Mechagodzilla, and Skull Island, of course, has a portal to this very destination. While the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters finale may not take the action beyond the current timeline, it certainly allows for the fleshing out of some major Monsterverse story beats.
