  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Sheldon&rsquo;s salary as a senior theoretical physicist at Caltech is estimated to be between $100,000 and $140,000+. He likely has some money saved up and would have received a salary increase after winning a Nobel Prize.   Leonard&rsquo;s salary as a senior experimental physicist at Caltech is estimated to be around $100,000 per year. Despite being paid less than Sheldon, Leonard&rsquo;s work includes important research and he was shortlisted for a tenure position at Caltech.   Penny&rsquo;s income initially comes from her job at The Cheesecake Factory, where she likely made around $50,000 per year. However, she later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and her salary is estimated to be between $75,000 and $150,000, depending on performance bonuses.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The characters in The Big Bang Theory all advanced in their careers throughout the series. Here’s what their salaries would realistically look like.</p>
<p>The careers of The Big Bang Theory characters play a key role in the series, and while it&rsquo;s never revealed how much Sheldon Cooper makes or just how bad Penny&rsquo;s Cheesecake Factory wages were, it&rsquo;s easy to make a rough estimate at the various TBBT character incomes by looking the incomes of those roles in real life. Part of the success of The Big Bang Theory came from the fun of watching the characters embark upon their impressive career paths across its 2007-2019 run.</p>
<p>Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, and Raj, are all highly educated scientists at Caltech. Meanwhile, Penny has a string of different careers and acting positions. At first glance, none of the characters appear to be extremely wealthy. Sheldon and Leonard share a two-bedroom apartment in Pasadena. Raj and Penny each have one-bedroom apartments. Howard still lives at home with his mother. However, by the time the twelve seasons of The Big Bang Theory wrapped, the incomes of the TBBT characters would have been significantly higher.</p>
<pre><code>              Big Bang Theory Missed Penny’s Perfect Ending (Instead Of Being Pregnant)   The Big Bang Theory missed the perfect ending for Penny instead of the divisive revelation that she and Leonard were expecting their first kid.   
</code></pre>
<p>Sheldon&rsquo;s Salary
Caltech Professor: $100,000 - $140,000+</p>
<p>Dr. Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parson) is a senior theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology. He has two doctorates, obtaining the first when he was just 16 years old and the second four years later. By the time The Big Bang Theory starts, Sheldon is 27. He has probably been working professionally for seven years. It is seen in several episodes that he can be quite generous when it comes to money. This would suggest that Sheldon has some money saved up.</p>
<p>The average salary of a senior theoretical physicist at a high-profile institute like Caltech is around $100,000. To change his research from string theory to dark matter, Sheldon is made a junior professor in The Big Bang Theory season 8. This promotion would have increased his salary to around $140,000 per year. In the series finale, Sheldon and his wife, Amy, win a Nobel Prize, which, alongside the $1.1 million in prize money, would have come with a higher salary, as he would be highly sought after by any institution.</p>
<p>Leonard&rsquo;s Salary
Senior Experimental Physicist At Caltech: $100,000</p>
<p>Dr. Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) is a senior experimental physicist at Caltech. He has a Ph.D. from Princeton University, which he earned at the age of 24. He does some important work, including classified research for the military on rocket fuel, and being a part of Stephen Hawking&rsquo;s North Sea expedition. In The Big Bang Theory season 6, Leonard is shortlisted for a Caltech tenure position, along with Raj and Sheldon, which would have included a salary increase if he got it.</p>
<p>Although, on average, experimental physicists are paid more than theoretical physicists at the same level, Leonard&rsquo;s one doctorate compared to Sheldon&rsquo;s two would probably result in him being paid less than his best friend. In addition, according to Sheldon&rsquo;s judgment, most of Leonard&rsquo;s work would be seen as &ldquo;derivative.&rdquo; However, it&rsquo;s likely Leonard&rsquo;s salary is somewhere around $100,000 a year and remains pretty much the same for the whole series.</p>
<pre><code>              Big Bang Theory Spoiled Penny &amp; Leonard's Big Finale Story In Season 5   Penny (Kaley Cuoco) and Leonard Hofstadters' (Johnny Galecki) final The Big Bang Theory storyline was subtly foreshadowed back in season 5.    
</code></pre>
<p>Penny&rsquo;s Salary
Pharmaceutical Representative: $75,000-$150,000</p>
<p>Penny Teller (Kaley Cuoco) is an aspiring actress at the start of The Big Bang Theory. Her acting career never amounts to more than low-budget horror films, commercials, and occasional theater gigs. Her main source of income comes from her job at The Cheesecake Factory. Penny waitresses and bartends at her job, making minimum wage plus tips. While tips may vary, Penny&rsquo;s salary likely would have been about $50,000 per year, as the California minimum wage in 2007 was $7.50 and her tips likely would have been solid.</p>
<p>However, later in The Big Bang Theory, Penny changes career paths and becomes a pharmaceutical representative at her friend Bernadette&rsquo;s company. She is said to be the third-best salesperson at the company. This is a big salary difference from her job at the Cheesecake Factory. With this job, Penny would be making about $75,000 per year, if not upwards of $150,000 if her job factors in performance bonuses.</p>
<p>Raj&rsquo;s Salary
Astrophysicist At Caltech: $100,000</p>
<p>Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar) is an astrophysicist at Caltech and also has a doctorate. He has made some impressive achievements throughout his career, including discovering a planet, being featured as one of People Magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;30 Under 30,&rdquo; and being awarded the Newcomb Medal, worth around $25,000. The Big Bang Theory&rsquo;s Raj also has family living in India who regularly send him expensive gifts and even pay his rent, since they are billionaires.</p>
<p>When his research ends, Raj takes a job working with Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory to avoid his work permit being made void and getting deported. Later, he also gets a job as a speaker at the Griffith Observatory Planetarium. His combined salary would be around $100,000.</p>
<pre><code>              Young Sheldon Solves Big Bang Theory’s Biggest Storytelling Problem   Young Sheldon season 5 inadvertently solves The Big Bang Theory's biggest storytelling problem that plagued the sitcom until the end of its run.    
</code></pre>
<p>Howard&rsquo;s Salary
Aerospace Engineer At Caltech: $100,000</p>
<p>Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) is an aerospace engineer at Caltech. Even though Sheldon often looks down on Howard in The Big Bang Theory for having a Masters instead of a Ph.D., his career has not been hindered by this. Howard designed a satellite to orbit Jupiter&rsquo;s largest moon and piloted the Mars rover. When NASA selects his design for a deep-field space telescope, Howard undergoes astronaut training and goes into space.</p>
<p>His experience as an astronaut opens up other career possibilities for him, including writing books and speaking at the planetarium. Howard&rsquo;s wife, Bernadette, sometimes reminds him she makes more than him, since she makes a &ldquo;butt load&rdquo; of money as a microbiologist. Considering his achievements, Howard probably makes more than the average salary in his field, which is around $85,000. Instead, Howard&rsquo;s salary in The Big Bang Theory is probably closer to $100,000 per year.</p>
<p>Bernadette&rsquo;s Salary
Microbiologist: $125,000+</p>
<p>Bernadette often made fun of Howard in The Big Bang Theory by reminding him that she makes more money than him in her job as a microbiologist. Howard, as an aerospace engineer at Caltech, made around $100,000 a year. When it comes to Bernadette, she earned her PH.D in microbiology from Caltech while she was working at The Cheesecake Factory with Penny. Her Ph.D. means that Howard was the only one of the scientists in the group with only a Master&rsquo;s Degree.</p>
<p>This also led to Bernadette getting a high-level job at a pharmaceutical company called Zangen. She makes, as she calls it, a &ldquo;buttload of money,&rdquo; she clearly makes a lot. The average salary is around $66,000 for microbiologists in Los Angeles, but her high-level role means she likely makes more than $125,000, meaning more than Howard makes by at least $25,000, if not more.</p>
<p>Amy&rsquo;s Salary
Neurobiologist: $80,000+</p>
<p>Amy joined the main cast after the third season, and she became a very important part of the show. She also ended up falling in love with Sheldon, and the two ended up getting married. This is a big deal because Sheldon couldn&rsquo;t survive without someone at least close to his level of intellect on the show. Amy&rsquo;s job is as a neurobiologist, with her degree from Harvard.</p>
<p>Many of her appearances on Big Bang Theory see Amy in her laboratory conducting experiments. This includes testing on animal addiction and more. It is not clear who she works for in The Big Bang Theory, but she ended up winning the Nobel Prize with Sheldon. This ensured that, no matter who she worked for, she would get a top salary. Whether she works for Caltech or another university, it is expected that she made close to $80,000 a year before the Nobel Prize.</p>
<pre><code>          The Big Bang Theory  The Big Bang Theory first premiered on CBS in 2007 and became one of its era's most popular and longest-lasting network sitcoms. Running for 12 seasons, The Big Bang Theory focuses on a group of self-proclaimed nerds, Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon (Jim Parsons), Howard (Simon Helberg), and Raj (Kunal Nayyar), who form an unlikely friendship with their new neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco).
