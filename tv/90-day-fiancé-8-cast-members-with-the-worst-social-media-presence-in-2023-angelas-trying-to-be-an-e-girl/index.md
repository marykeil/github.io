## Literature Review
Many 90 Day Fiancé stars don’t know how to cash in on their reality TV fame on social media. They rarely post valuable content for their followers.




Over the years, 90 Day Fiancé and its spin-offs have featured many controversial cast members whose reputations have declined on social media. The series is known for popularizing villainous cast members and highlighting their antics. One example is Big Ed Brown, who has irritated many with his on-screen antics. The San Diego native ruined his reputation when he mistreated his ex-girlfriend, Rose Vega. To make matters worse, he reappeared on numerous spin-offs and became one of the biggest hypocrites in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. While Ed has greatly improved since 90 Day: The Last Resort, he’s still controversial.
Like Big Ed, Asuelu Pulaa and Kalani Faagata also exhausted their followers with their marital issues. The couple opened up about their mutual infidelity scandal on 90 Day: The Last Resort and spared no details. Their revelations ruined their on-screen images. Scott Wern also did the same by ditching Pedro Jimeno’s mom, Lidia Morel, in the spin-off show. The middle-aged fitness enthusiast picked his ex after wasting Lidia’s time. Most of these cast members still struggle to improve their social presence. However, some controversial stars aren’t even trying to win fans over anymore.

Hamza Keeps Sharing Boring Posts On Instagram
        

Former cast member Hamza Moknii&#39;s social media following has slowed down due to his lack of concern for his followers. The Tunisian native was supported by many in 2022 after Hamza and his wife, Memphis Smith, broke up and was unable to meet his daughter. However, fans now don’t care about him as much. Hamza rarely shares meaningful content or discusses his life. Instead, he posts selfies and photos of himself enjoying Chicago.

He also disrespected her and decided to split up when she asked him to pay her back. Yohan has proved himself to be a gold digger. Most social media users can’t stand him smiling at the cameras and acting like a charmer.

It seems fans aren’t invested in her life or have many things to say to her. Holly’s presence on social media is non-existent despite her thousands of followers.

 1  Jibri Bell Criticizes Social Media 
Jibri Can’t Win On Instagram


Jibri Bell is another alumni who hasn’t grown much despite his best attempts. During 90 Day Fiancé season 9, the South Dakota native tried to utilize reality TV and social media to his benefit. He plugged his music on the show to boost his views and sold his torn jeans for cash. In 2023, Jibri has been pretending to be a monk in Thailand. He has ditched his old lifestyle and started calling out social media itself. While he isn’t doing anything wrong, he lost the trust of his followers. Most people feel the 90 Day Fiancé alum is fake and using Thailand’s culture to boost his social media following.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
