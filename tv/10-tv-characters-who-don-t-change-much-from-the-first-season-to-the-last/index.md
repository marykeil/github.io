# 10 TV Characters Who Don t Change Much From The First Season To The Last


## SUMMARY 


 Some long-running TV show characters remain relatively static throughout the series, providing stability to the story. 
 Static characters can still carry engaging plots and serve as leaders for an ever-changing cast of characters. 
 Character development is not always necessary for a meaningful story, as some characters never change their ways.

## Literature Review

While some TV characters never change their selfish ways, morally good static characters can serve as the backbones of their respective shows. 




Long-running TV shows offer opportunities for extensive character development, yet some characters do not change much at all from the beginning of the series to the last episode. Maybe they have no desire to change for the better, it isn&#39;t in their nature, or they are already a generally good character who doesn&#39;t necessarily need to change. In the last case, some people might still argue that character development is necessary for a meaningful story. Yet some relatively static characters are able to carry engaging plots.
An entertaining character at the center of an ongoing plot can stabilize the story. One Piece&#39;s Luffy serves as a leader for an ever-changing cast of characters, while Game of Thrones&#39; Jon Snow is always an important figure in the war against the dead. In these cases, the characters and the audience have a stable character who can always be depended upon to act a certain way throughout a long show. However, a character never changing their ways may be the very point of the story. Examples of this include Logan Roy in Succession and Tony Soprano in The Sopranos.









 








 10  Tony Soprano 
The Sopranos (1999-2007)


 







At the beginning of The Sopranos, mob boss Tony Soprano begins going to therapy to understand and prevent his panic attacks. While some fans believe that Tony wanted to change, he never does. Dr. Melfi tries to direct Tony toward being a better person, but Tony only seems to rid himself of any guilt he initially felt for his criminal activities and constantly cheating on his wife. Before The Sopranos comes to an end, Melfi ends her sessions with Tony, believing that he is only using therapy to learn to better manipulate people.

TV shows centred on anti-heroes have grown in popularity in recent years, and with these new protags taking centre stage, its time to rank the best.








 9  Monkey D. Luffy 
Once Piece (1999-Present)
        

Luffy’s unchanging character is the central piece that holds it all together.


Throughout One Piece&#39;s run, now in its third decade, Luffy&#39;s fundamental personality never changes. He develops better leadership and strategic skills, but he is ultimately still the optimistic and energetic captain of Straw Hat crew, prone to fights and other detours. Luffy&#39;s goal to find the One Piece and become the new Pirate King has also not changed in more than 20 years. Yet in a long-running series with too many plot elements to ever remember, Luffy’s unchanging character is the central piece that holds it all together.





 8  Selina Meyer 
Veep (2012-2019)


 







Julia Louis Dreyfus&#39; Selina Meyer, the fiction VP and later President of the United States, never becomes a better or more caring politician. She is introduced at the beginning of Veep as the VP who is frustrated by her sidelined role. As the series goes on, she remains ambitious and determined to leave her mark on history. The only thing that changes is how far she is willing to go. But maybe she was always willing to go that far, she just hadn&#39;t been prompted to do so yet. The shocking Veep ending shows Selina at her worst.





 7  Katherine Pierce 
The Vampire Diaries (2009-2017)


 







Katherine&#39;s motivations rarely change during her time on The Vampire Diaries: survive, cause chaos, and maybe get Stefan to fall in love with her again. She seems to have some moments of real growth during season 5 when she is forced to confront her own mortality and her long-lost daughter comes to Mystic Falls. Despite Katherine&#39;s sympathetic death and the moments where she shows genuine concern for her daughter, her return in season 8 proves that these events did not change her malevolent nature. Katherine returns as the newly-minted queen of hell, ready to wreak havoc once more.

One of the core cast members may quit the show long before its conclusion, but sometimes they can come back for an episode or even a season.








 6  Jon Snow 
Game Of Thrones (2011-2019)


 







A lot happens to Jon throughout Game of Thrones: Many members of his family are killed, he falls in love twice, he dies and is resurrected, and he fights many battles. However, Jon&#39;s overall personality and worldview do not change that much. He is still generally brooding and dedicated to his family.
Despite finding out that he is the heir to the Iron Throne, Jon is determined to maintain his current role in the Stark family. In Game of Thrones&#39; ending, Jon rejoins the Night&#39;s Watch. Ironically, joining the Watch was his goal at the beginning of the series – a lot of other stuff just had to happen before he could return to that role for good.





 5  Don Draper 
Mad Men (2007-2015)


 







Mad Men follows the personal and professional lives of the executives at an advertising company in 1960s New York. The protagonist Don Draper is a serial womanizer and constantly manipulates his family and colleagues. The show does humanize him at times, but these scenes are largely redundant because of how the show ends. In Mad Men’s ending, Don goes to a retreat in California to make peace with the pain he has caused others. However, the finale also possibly implies that Don will return to his old ways.





 4  BoJack Horseman 
BoJack Horseman (2014-2020)


 







He is a morally complicated character, to say the least, who does terrible things and then tries to be better repeatedly.


BoJack Horseman is thought to be the villain of the Netflix series because he is generally terrible throughout the show. He is a morally complicated character, to say the least, who does terrible things and then tries to be better repeatedly. Some people interpret BoJack Horseman’s ending as inevitable karma: BoJack does not drown in a pool because he needs to face the consequences of his actions in life. The series ends with the same question that has run throughout the series: Will BoJack change his ways in the future?





 3  Logan Roy 
Succession (2018-2023)


 







Throughout Succession, Logan Roy manipulates his family as he determines who will succeed him as the CEO of the family&#39;s media empire. When it seems like he is connecting with his children, he is really moving them around on a chess board to see how ruthless they each can be. His family worries about his erratic business decisions, but Logan&#39;s expectation that his word is final never changes either.
The worst things Logan Roy did to his kids include psychological and physical abuse. He makes Kendall take the fall for the company’s crimes and skips Shiv’s wedding as an act of petty revenge (he changes his mind when he realizes he doesn&#39;t have a reason to give the public for not going). In Succession&#39;s ending, it is implied that the Roy children have all become as power-hungry as Logan.

 2  Ron Swanson 
Parks And Recreation (2009-2015)
        

Leslie Knope&#39;s superior at Pawnee City Hall Ron Swanson goes has several arcs involving his love and family life during Parks and Recreation&#39;s run. He is married and divorced twice from two women both named Tammy before he meets Diane Lewis, who he marries and with whom he starts a family. But aside from these personal changes, Ron remains the same person throughout the series. He puts on a harsh demeanor at work but is more carefree outside the office. He also refuses to budge regarding his personal beliefs and advocates for small government.





 1  Jerry Seinfeld 
Seinfeld (1989-1998)


 







The foundational punchline of Seinfeld is that the main cast are all terrible people, and they continue to be so throughout the series. In the divisive Seinfeld finale, they all go to prison after a series of guest stars come in to testify about all the worst things they’ve ever done. The worst things Jerry ever did (via GR) include breaking up with girlfriends for superficial reasons, mugging an elderly woman, and somewhat accidentally injuring several people. Yet Jerry and other characters never changing is arguably the point of the show, so the audience always knows what to expect.
