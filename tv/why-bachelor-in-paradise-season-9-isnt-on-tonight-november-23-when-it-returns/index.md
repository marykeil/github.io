Bachelor in Paradise season 9 has been a wild ride full of romance, humor, drama, surprise appearances, and the infamous Truth Box, and, although the show won&#39;t air tonight, it&#39;ll be back soon for its exciting conclusion. Bachelor in Paradise season 9 features mainly contestants from Zach Shallcross&#39; Bachelor season and Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season. However, there are some other familiar faces, including three-time Bachelorette suitor Blake Moynes and former Bachelorette Rachel Recchia. Several men from Rachel&#39;s season have also joined the cast.

 Why Isn’t Bachelor In Paradise Season 9 On Tonight? 

 

According to an Instagram post announcing the show&#39;s end-of-season schedule, Bachelor in Paradise season 9 won&#39;t air tonight, November 23, because it&#39;s Thanksgiving. The post encourages fans to &#34;Hit the daybed and relax,&#34; which is what the contestants do all season long. Fans and new viewers who wish to spend that time catching up on episodes can do so on ABC On Demand or Hulu. A mini-marathon of The Golden Bachelor episodes 1, 2, and 3 will air on Thanksgiving night from 8-11 p.m. ET.






 What Is Bachelor In Paradise Season 9’s Schedule For The Remainder Of The Season? 
          

There are only two episodes left in Bachelor in Paradise season 9. The show will return on Thursday, November 30, for a one-hour episode from 10-11 p.m. ET. The episode has been shortened from its usual two hours to one hour because the two-hour season finale of The Golden Bachelor will air that night from 8-10 p.m. ET. The following week is the season finale of Bachelor in Paradise season 9.



 When Will The Bachelor In Paradise Season 9 Finale Air? 
          

The three-hour Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale will air on Thursday, December 7 from 8-11 p.m. ET. During that episode, some couples might get engaged, while others might leave as couples. Unfortunately, the finale might also bring the end of some relationships. If Bachelor in Paradise season 9 follows last year&#39;s format, there will hopefully also be a reunion of the contestants filmed after the show in order to address all of the drama that happened on the beaches of Mexico.




As Bachelor in Paradise season 9 heads toward its thrilling conclusion, some couples, such as Kylee Russell and Aven Jones, and Eliza Isichei and Aaron Bryant, seem strong, while others are on shaky ground. Also, the couple whose wedding was teased in the previews will finally be revealed. It&#39;ll be interesting to find out if Jess Girod and Blake Moynes, and Mercedes Northup and Tyler Norris, can rise above the challenges to their relationships. It&#39;ll also be exciting to see if Kat Izzo and John Henry Spurlock&#39;s relationship lasts. Hopefully, at least one of these couples will find the lasting love they&#39;re searching for on Bachelor in Paradise season 9.
