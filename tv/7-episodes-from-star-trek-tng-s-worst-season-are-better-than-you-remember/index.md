## Literature Review
Star Trek: The Next Generation may not have hit the ground running, but these 7 episodes from season 1 hold up better than you might remember.



Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1 is widely considered the show&#39;s worst season, but these 7 episodes are still worth watching. With its premiere in 1987, TNG introduced the world to an entirely new USS Enterprise crew, led by Patrick Stewart&#39;s Captain Jean-Luc Picard. TNG got off to a rough start, with complications behind the scenes leading to a constantly shifting team of writers. More than once, filming had to be delayed because the episode&#39;s script was still being written. Despite these struggles, something about the cast of characters clicked and audiences fell in love with Captain Picard and his crew.
Although some episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1 are notoriously bad (see TNG episode 4, &#34;Code of Honor&#34;), others are surprisingly good considering the actors and characters were still finding their footing. TNG season 1 established many important backstories for its characters that would reverberate throughout all seven seasons. When compared with later seasons, it&#39;s easy to see why TNG season 1 has a poor reputation, but taken on its own, it&#39;s not a bad season of television. Despite TNG season 1&#39;s inconsistency, here are 7 episodes that are better than you remember.
            

 10 Good Things TNGâ€™s Bad Season 1 Gave Star Trek 
Star Trek: The Next Generation might have gotten off to a rocky start, but its first season wasn&#39;t all bad.



 7  &#34;Where No One Has Gone Before&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 6) 
The Enterprise travels to the edge of the universe.
        

After the feature-length premiere episode, the next few episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1 felt like rehashes of plots from Star Trek: The Original Series. The characters hadn&#39;t come into their own yet, and the show was still in the process of figuring out what it wanted to be. TNG episode 6 felt like a significant step forward, as &#34;Where No One Has Gone Before&#34; introduced a fascinating alien and sent the Enterprise-D to the very edge of the universe. The Traveler (Eric Menyuk) would become an important part of Star Trek lore, appearing in two more TNG episodes before eventually recruiting Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) to join him on his adventures. &#34;Where No One Has Gone Before&#34; embodies what Star Trek is all about and offers the first glimpse of greatness for TNG.




 6  &#34;The Battle&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 9) 
Captain Picard gets hit with a blast from the past.
        

A couple of episodes later, Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s &#34;The Battle&#34; shifts the focus to Captain Picard&#39;s life before he took over command of the Enterprise-D. Star Trek: The Original Series rarely provided backstories for its characters, only revealing small snippets of their past when it was relevant for a particular episode. TNG, on the other hand, began introducing more serialized elements into Star Trek, showing that TNG&#39;s characters had a past before the show began. In the case of Picard, his past comes back to haunt him when a desperate Ferengi seeks revenge for the death of his son. Picard had unknowingly destroyed a Ferengi vessel several years prior, and he&#39;s forced to relive that day in &#34;The Battle.&#34;
After being introduced a few episodes previously (in TNG episode 5, &#34;The Last Outpost&#34;), the Ferengi were originally supposed to be the next big Star Trek villains. However, the profit-focused aliens came across as more comedic than frightening. 





 5  &#34;The Big Goodbye&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 12) 
The TNG crew plays gangster on the holodeck.




In Star Trek&#39;s first holodeck episode, Captain Picard embodies his inner hard-boiled detective by taking on the persona of the fictional 1940s private eye, Dixon Hill. What should be a fun and diverting adventure turns deadly when the holodeck&#39;s safeties malfunction. It&#39;s fun seeing the Enterprise crew decked out in period wear, and all of the actors seem to be having a good time. Picard&#39;s love of Dixon Hill would become a running theme throughout TNG and Star Trek: First Contact. With numerous references to film noir classics, &#34;The Big Goodbye&#34; is an incredibly fun episode that establishes the pattern for holodeck episodes moving forward, for both good and ill.
&#34;The Big Goodbye&#34; won a Peabody Award in 1987 and also nabbed an Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series. 




 4  &#34;Datalore&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 13) 
Data&#39;s evil twin pays a visit to the Enterprise.
        

Following &#34;The Big Goodbye,&#34; Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s next episode focuses on Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). &#34;Datalore&#34; introduces Data&#39;s evil twin Lore (also Brent Spiner), and reveals more about the android&#39;s backstory. From the beginning, Brent Spiner was one of TNG&#39;s most talented actors, and that&#39;s never more apparent than when he portrays multiple characters in the same episode. Spiner makes Data and Lore distinct characters, and he appears as Lore in three more episodes of TNG and one episode of Star Trek: Picard. Lore serves as a nice contrast to Data, and the history established in &#34;Datalore&#34; reverberates throughout the rest of Data&#39;s story arc.



 3  &#34;11001001&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 15) 
The Bynars take over the Enterprise rather than asking for help.
        

Although &#34;11001001&#34; does not introduce any major story developments, it&#39;s a solid Star Trek: The Next Generation episode with a cool new alien species. With their fascinating relationship with technology and indecipherable speech patterns, the Bynars feel truly alien and help the universe of TNG feel bigger. &#34;11001001&#34; follows an entertaining storyline, as the Bynars take over the Enterprise-D in order to save their homeworld. After everyone evacuates the ship, Picard and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) find themselves alone, as they work to figure out what the Bynars want. &#34;11001001&#34; may not be a perfect episode of Star Trek, but it&#39;s a solid TNG entry that proved the first season was moving in the right direction.
Though the Bynars have not been seen again in live-action, they do make a couple of appearances in Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4. 




 2  &#34;The Arsenal of Freedom&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 21) 
Captain Picard and his crew face off against a weapons sales display.




When the Enterprise-D investigates the disappearance of a Federation starship, the crew finds themselves under attack from an automated weapons system. There&#39;s quite a bit going on in Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s &#34;The Arsenal of Freedom,&#34; and every main character gets something to do. When Captain Picard beams down to the planet to offer assistance, he and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) wind up trapped in a cavern. With Crusher injured, Picard must keep her awake and alive until the Enterprise can rescue them. While the crew members on the surface of the planet deal with deadly drone weapons, Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) commands the Enterprise against a planetary defense system. While La Forge doesn&#39;t get a dedicated episode in TNG season 1, &#34;The Arsenal of Freedom&#34; is a great showcase for Geordi as he proves to be a quick thinker in a crisis.




 1  &#34;Conspiracy&#34; (TNG Season 1, Episode 25) 
Picard and Riker make a guy&#39;s head explode.




One of Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s most controversial episodes, &#34;Conspiracy&#34; follows Captain Picard as he uncovers an insidious conspiracy threatening all of Starfleet. When the Enterprise-D returns to Earth to investigate, they discover that parasites have taken over the brains of several officials at the highest levels of Starfleet. These parasitic creatures cannot be reasoned with, and Picard and Riker handle the problem with phaser fire. As both officers fire their phasers at the parasite leader within Lt. Commander Remmick (Robert Schenkkan), Remmick&#39;s body explodes in a surprisingly gory display for Star Trek. This scene got &#34;Conspiracy&#34; banned in the United Kingdom, but the episode remains an unconventional and entertaining episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
