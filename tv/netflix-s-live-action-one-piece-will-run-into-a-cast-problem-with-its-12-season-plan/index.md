# Netflix s Live-Action One Piece Will Run Into A Cast Problem With Its 12-Season Plan


## SUMMARY 



  The producers of Netflix&#39;s live-action One Piece hope to adapt the manga over 12 seasons, providing enough time to faithfully tell the story.   There are concerns about whether Netflix&#39;s track record of canceling shows after a few seasons will affect One Piece&#39;s chances of completing its vision.   The cast of One Piece may face challenges as they age over the course of 12 seasons, and it remains to be seen if they will still want to continue with the show.

## Literature Review
Netflix’s live-action One Piece will ideally go on for 12 seasons, but the anime adaptation faces one obstacle to seeing its long-term vision through.




The creators of Netflix&#39;s live-action One Piece have a 12-season plan to tell their story, but the adaptation may run into a cast problem, especially if it abides by the streamer&#39;s typical release timeline. Given the length of Eiichiro Oda&#39;s One Piece manga — which spans more than 1,000 chapters — the live-action series has a lot of ground to cover if it hopes to faithfully adapt the source material. It&#39;s understandable, then, that One Piece&#39;s producers have a long-term plan to adapt the story. And while such a timeline makes sense in theory, it does raise questions about how it can realistically be executed.




For starters, Netflix is notorious for canceling its original shows after just a few seasons, leaving viewers to wonder if One Piece&#39;s creators will even get the chance to see their vision through. Given how big One Piece is, it&#39;s possible it will be one of the few Netflix shows to get a long lifespan on the platform. Even still, the live-action One Piece faces a bigger challenge with its long-term plan, and it has to do with its main actors.

That&#39;s How Long They Want To Adapt Eiichiro Oda&#39;s Manga
          

The producers of Netflix&#39;s One Piece want 12 seasons to adapt the over 1,000-chapter manga, and it&#39;ll likely be challenging to capture the entire story even with a run of that length. This isn&#39;t the only challenge One Piece faces bringing the anime and manga to life, but it&#39;s probably the most overwhelming. Still, a 12-season run can give the Straw Hat Pirates enough time to grow and see Luffy&#39;s dream of becoming the King of the Pirates all the way through. It can also catch them up to the manga&#39;s final arc, which should be finished by the time the live-action series is approaching its ending.




With One Piece season 1 debuting in August 2023, season 12 of the live-action show is a long way off. Even if Netflix manages to put out one season per year — which would be a more ambitious release timeline than it utilizes for most of its other hits — the final outing still wouldn&#39;t arrive until around 2035. This raises questions about whether the cast will still believably be able to portray their characters, as well as whether they&#39;ll still want to.

The Cast Of One Piece Will Be Much Older In Season 12
         



While de-aging technology can go a long way in making it look like less time has passed, it&#39;ll be strange to have actors playing characters decades younger than them.




The cast of Netflix&#39;s One Piece are acceptable ages to portray their characters now, but they&#39;re likely to look noticeably older than their fictional counterparts by season 12. This is a problem any series with younger characters faces, and the fact that Netflix tends to take long breaks in between seasons won&#39;t do One Piece any favors. While de-aging technology can go a long way in making it look like less time has passed, it&#39;ll be strange to have actors playing characters decades younger than them. Some of One Piece&#39;s cast members are already five or 10 years older than their characters. By season 12, that gap could be jarring.

It&#39;s also questionable whether the actors will still want to work on One Piece in 10 or more years, especially as new opportunities arise. Twelve seasons is a long time to be involved in a single project, and unless Netflix has long-term contracts with the cast, it&#39;s possible some of them will depart before One Piece finishes its run. That would make it more difficult to successfully see its vision through. And recasting One Piece&#39;s main roles would be even more rattling than watching them age much faster than One Piece&#39;s timeline.



 How The Live-Action One Piece Can Work Around Its Cast Issue 
A Time Skip Or De-Aging Technology Can Help
          

Assuming both Netflix and the cast of One Piece agree to see the series through to season 12, there are ways the anime adaptation can handle its age issue. For one, it can take advantage of the One Piece anime&#39;s two-year time skip, widening that gap to accommodate the real actors&#39; ages. This would make older Straw Hat Pirates in the later seasons more believable, working the passage of time in the real world into the Netflix show&#39;s narrative. The live-action One Piece could even utilize additional time jumps to achieve this end, as the main characters don&#39;t technically need to be young adults the whole time.




One Piece can also utilize ever-improving de-aging technology, though this comes with the risk of it being noticeable on-screen. It does give the Netflix series options though, offering hope that it can truly see its 12-season vision to the end. That&#39;s good news for One Piece fans, as the live-action show is one of the better anime adaptations to surface in recent years; it deserves to reach its full potential.
