## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé’s Sophie Sierra has started a new chapter in her life after allegedly splitting from Rob Warne. She’s now living luxuriously in the U.S.




Sophie Sierra from 90 Day Fiancé is living her best life and loves expressing herself on social media. The 23-year-old introduced herself to viewers as a mixed-race British woman from a wealthy family. Sophie revealed that she was bullied in childhood, which inspired her to become the confident lady she is today. She wanted to find the perfect match for herself, someone who could relate to her struggles. Therefore, she built a relationship with a mixed-race man, Rob Warne, thinking he was the one man who’d be the best husband to her. During 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Sophie moved to the United States to marry Rob.




However, the British model quickly realized that her 32-year-old American beau wasn’t as nice as he pretended to be. When Sophie landed in the U.S., Rob proposed to her, locking her into an engagement with him. He then proceeded to undervalue her concerns and didn’t care that she struggled in his bathroom-less apartment. To make matters worse, Sophie then learned about Rob’s cheating scandal and was heartbroken by it. The latest rumors hint that the season 10 couple split up after getting married.

 Sophie Gets Front Row Seats At Travis Scott’s Concert 
          

Sophie has been showing off her new happy life on social media lately. In late November 2023, the British 90 Day Fiancé star shared an Instagram story from Travis Scott’s concert. She not only got to see the excellent music performance of Kylie Jenner’s baby daddy but also got front-row seats at the event. Sophie proudly showed that she was wealthy enough to get herself first-class treatment and didn’t need Rob to drag her down. She’s having fun, making money, and living as she should in her mid-20s.






 Sophie Has A Cute Apartment With Indoor Bathroom 

 

Over the months, Sophie has shared many photos of herself from her apartment. Not only does she like to show how big her cute house is, but she also shares makeup content from her bathroom. Most 90 Day Fiancé viewers may know that Sophie felt trapped in Rob’s little room, which didn’t even have an attached toilet. She had to walk outside to use the bathroom or freshen up. Rob tried his best to make Sophie believe that having a room without a restroom was perfectly normal. Thankfully, she didn’t fall into his trap and procured her mini paradise.



 Sophie Celebrates 25th Birthday With “Genuine People” 

 




Sophie turned 25 in October 2023. She posted an album of her birthday party on Instagram, showing that she celebrated her big day with her good friends. She captioned her post, “blessed to have such genuine people around me.” Neither of Sophie’s photos showed Rob, which made 90 Day Fiancé viewers speculate that the two are no longer together. Sophie has real friends who care for her and her opinions. It’s hard to say if the new 90 Day Fiancé cast member posted the birthday photos to rub her perfect life into Rob’s face, but she likely posted it to show she’s happy and content.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
