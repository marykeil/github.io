## Literature Review
Connie, aka Meemaw, on Young Sheldon, lost her husband, but when she was finally ready to get back out there, she dated a few interesting characters.




One of the biggest questions going into the final season of Young Sheldon is about who Meemaw ends up with. Connie aka Meemaw has had some notable relationships over the course of the series with some being more serious than others. At the end of the day, however, Meemaw&#39;s priorities are her grandchildren. Sometimes this has led her to avoid taking her relationships to the next level, turning down a number of suitors and dedicating herself to Sheldon and his siblings. However, the timeline of Meemaw&#39;s romances could suggest a possible endgame for her relationships




Meemaw has a thriving social life of her own where she enjoys gambling at the casino, running her laundromat, and, of course, dating. Following the death of her husband, Meemaw actually had a pretty healthy dating life with some memorable beaus. So far on Young Sheldon, Meemaw has seen three separate men but only had two serious relationships, with each of them making a significant mark on her dating life. While there are certainly some suitors who feel like stronger prospects, the final season of Young Sheldon will ultimately reveal who Meemaw ends up with.

                  Young Sheldon Season 6 Ending Explained   The one-hour Young Sheldon season 6 finale is a mix of comedic and dramatic moments as Sheldon and the rest of the Coopers face a bleak future.

 Pop-Pop 
Before Young Sheldon
          




It was revealed in The Big Bang Theory that Pop-Pop had passed away when Sheldon was very young. For much of her adult life, Meemaw was married to her beloved husband, Mary&#39;s father, and Sheldon, Georgie, and Missy&#39;s grandfather, Charlie. Known as Pop-Pop, he and Meemaw had a wonderful marriage. Pop-Pop, who Sheldon described as the only member of his family who actually encouraged him to pursue a career in science, died of complications from surgery. Though he was never seen on the show, Young Sheldon makes him a big part of the Cooper family.

However, he also shared the same ego and narcissism as Sheldon. Charlie passed in 1985 when Sheldon was just five years old and he and Meemaw were likely married for decades, where they had three kids together, including Mary. It was clear that Pop-Pop would always be the love of Meemaw&#39;s life, as evidenced when she got upset at John for wearing her husband&#39;s old blazer she was attempting to sell in a garage sale. However, it was time for Meemaw to move on and work on finding love again.
