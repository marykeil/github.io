  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Meemaw has had multiple relationships throughout the series, with some being more serious than others. Her primary focus, though, is on her grandchildren.   Meemaw&rsquo;s romances have had a significant impact on her dating life, but the final season of Young Sheldon will reveal who she ends up with.   Despite some ups and downs, Meemaw has found love again and is currently dating Dale Ballard, a baseball coach. John Sturgis, her previous love interest, still has feelings for her.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Connie, aka Meemaw, on Young Sheldon, lost her husband, but when she was finally ready to get back out there, she dated a few interesting characters.</p>
<p>One of the biggest questions going into the final season of Young Sheldon is about who Meemaw ends up with. Connie aka Meemaw has had some notable relationships over the course of the series with some being more serious than others. At the end of the day, however, Meemaw&rsquo;s priorities are her grandchildren. Sometimes this has led her to avoid taking her relationships to the next level, turning down a number of suitors and dedicating herself to Sheldon and his siblings. However, the timeline of Meemaw&rsquo;s romances could suggest a possible endgame for her relationships</p>
<p>Meemaw has a thriving social life of her own where she enjoys gambling at the casino, running her laundromat, and, of course, dating. Following the death of her husband, Meemaw actually had a pretty healthy dating life with some memorable beaus. So far on Young Sheldon, Meemaw has seen three separate men but only had two serious relationships, with each of them making a significant mark on her dating life. While there are certainly some suitors who feel like stronger prospects, the final season of Young Sheldon will ultimately reveal who Meemaw ends up with.</p>

<p>Pop-Pop
Before Young Sheldon</p>
<p>It was revealed in The Big Bang Theory that Pop-Pop had passed away when Sheldon was very young. For much of her adult life, Meemaw was married to her beloved husband, Mary&rsquo;s father, and Sheldon, Georgie, and Missy&rsquo;s grandfather, Charlie. Known as Pop-Pop, he and Meemaw had a wonderful marriage. Pop-Pop, who Sheldon described as the only member of his family who actually encouraged him to pursue a career in science, died of complications from surgery. Though he was never seen on the show, Young Sheldon makes him a big part of the Cooper family.</p>
<p>However, he also shared the same ego and narcissism as Sheldon. Charlie passed in 1985 when Sheldon was just five years old and he and Meemaw were likely married for decades, where they had three kids together, including Mary. It was clear that Pop-Pop would always be the love of Meemaw&rsquo;s life, as evidenced when she got upset at John for wearing her husband&rsquo;s old blazer she was attempting to sell in a garage sale. However, it was time for Meemaw to move on and work on finding love again.</p>
<p>Meemaw &amp; John Sturgis Meet &amp; Start Dating
Season 1, Episode 19 - Episode 21</p>
<p>An unlikely pairing, John Sturgis was socially awkward and completely opposite to Meemaw, but despite not appearing on The Big Bang Theory, he becomes a beloved character on Young Sheldon. Yet she fell easily for his quirks and charms and the pair soon began dating in season 1, episode 19, &ldquo;Gluons, Guacamole, and the Color Purple.&rdquo; After several successful dates and a blunder in which she must leave his lecture hall for distracting him too much, they take their relationship to the next level in episode 21, &ldquo;Summer Sausage, a Pocket Poncho, and Tony Danza,&rdquo; when John cooks dinner for her, and she invites him to stay the night.</p>
<p>Meemaw Dates Ira &amp; John At The Same Time, Then Dumps Ira
Season 1, Episode 22</p>
<p>Meemaw&rsquo;s success in the dating world is highlighted when she briefly dated Ira and John at the same time. In episode 21, &ldquo;Vanilla Ice Cream, Gentlemen Callers, and a Dinette Set,&rdquo; Meemaw goes out on a date with Ira but finds that they aren&rsquo;t compatible. Ira tries to win her back — by buying her furniture — but she stands her ground. John confronts Ira when he finds this out, infuriating Meemaw, but Ira backs off. In the meantime, Sheldon has been watching this all very closely and draws up his first-ever relationship contract.</p>

<p>Meemaw &amp; John Date While John Tries To Help Sheldon
Season 2, Episode 1 - Episode 6</p>
<p>John and Meemaw&rsquo;s season 2 relationship is undeniably sweet, as John continues to mentor Sheldon&rsquo;s incredible intelligence, growing closer to the Cooper family in the process. There are a few bumps here, as Meemaw has to tell John not to praise Paige too much in front of Sheldon in Young Sheldon season 2, episode 2, &ldquo;A Rival Prodigy and Sir Isaac Neutron,&rdquo; and John tries to get Sheldon and Missy to participate in a twin study in episode 5, &ldquo;A Research Study and Czechoslovakian Wedding Pastries.&rdquo; Otherwise, this is a peaceful time in Meemaw and John&rsquo;s relationship.</p>
<p>John Upsets Meemaw, But They Admit They Love Each Other
Season 2, Episode 7 - Episode 10</p>
<p>While Meemaw doesn&rsquo;t end up with John, the seemingly mismatched pair loves each other. In season 2, episode 7, &ldquo;Carbon Dating and a Stuffed Raccoon,&rdquo; Meemaw decides to have a garage sale. However, a fight arises when John puts on Pop-Pop&rsquo;s old jacket and Meemaw struggles with the loss of her husband, being one of the few times Young Sheldon dealt with serious issues. The two quickly reconcile and continue on their merry way until episode 10, &ldquo;A Stunted Childhood and a Can of Fancy Mixed Nuts.&rdquo; John expresses an interest in driving and Meemaw tries to teach him — to disastrous results. However, the two express their love for one another.</p>
<p>John Proposes To Meemaw &amp; Meemaw Rejects Him, But They Stay Together
Season 2, Episode 11 - Episode 20</p>
<p>John initially seems like he will be the one to end up with Meemaw when he proposes to her in season 2, episode 20, &ldquo;A Proposal and a Popsicle Stick Cross.&rdquo; John takes Meemaw out to a restaurant and gets down on one knee, but Meemaw is one step ahead. She tells him that she&rsquo;s already been a wife and doesn&rsquo;t want to repeat that chapter of her life. She would, however, like to remain a couple. John believes this is the only way people will know they&rsquo;re in a relationship, and as a later token of reconciliation, Meemaw announces their relationship in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Meemaw Takes John To A Casino &amp; John Shows Signs Of Depression
Season 2, Episode 21 - Episode 22</p>
<p>Meemaw&rsquo;s romance with John begins to show signs of complications nearing the end of Young Sheldon season 2. Meemaw takes John to her favorite place, the casino, in season 2, episode 21, &ldquo;A Broken Heart and a Crock Monster.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s wholly out of his element but eventually joins in the fun when Meemaw gets a lucky streak. However, John&rsquo;s happiness is short-lived as he falls into a deep depression in episode 22, &ldquo;A Swedish Science Thing and the Equation for Toast,&rdquo; due to the Nobel Prize announcement convincing him he will never win one. Sadly, John has a breakdown and is checked into a mental hospital.</p>

<p>John Stays In A Mental Hospital &amp; Dr. Linkletter Puts The Moves On Meemaw
Season 3, Episode 1 - Episode 4</p>
<p>Meemaw&rsquo;s relationship drama continued when John was in the mental hospital and someone else immediately showed interest in her. Meemaw didn&rsquo;t date Dr. Linkletter, but while she was in a relationship with John, she attended the school with him and Sheldon, and met Dr. Linkletter there in season 3, episode 2, &ldquo;A Broom  t and Satan&rsquo;s Monopoly Board.&rdquo; He immediately flirted with her. Even after he found out she was with his coworker, he continued to flirt with Meemaw until she completely shut him down. They are one of the couples that would have made a lot of sense on Young Sheldon but never happened.</p>
<p>John &amp; Meemaw Break Up, Meemaw Dates Ira For The Wrong Reasons, &amp; Meemaw Gets A Date With Dale
Season 3, Episode 5 - Episode 6:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after this, Meemaw and Dr. Sturgis don&rsquo;t get back together. After John was released from the mental institution, Meemaw still had feelings for him and wanted them to try and work on things. However, John believed it was best that they break up in season 3, episode 5, &ldquo;A Pineapple and the Bosom of Male Friendship,&rdquo; so Meemaw would not have to bear the burden of his mental health challenges. She was so upset that she threatened to call Ira to ask him out on a date, but she didn&rsquo;t get the reaction she wanted out of John when he agreed that it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Meemaw was certainly sad, but she found her next relationship relatively quickly. After going out on a date with Ira and admitting to his face that she did it to make John jealous in episode 5, Meemaw meets baseball coach and sports gear store owner Dale Ballard in Young Sheldon season 3, episode 6, &ldquo;A Parasol and a Hell of an Arm.&rdquo; Meemaw confronts Dale for not letting Missy on to the baseball team because she&rsquo;s a girl, and Dale finds himself impressed with her vigor. He asks her out on a date, and Meemaw accepts — and Missy makes the team.</p>
<p>Meemaw &amp; Dale Date, John Is Jealous
Season 3, Episode 7 - Episode 10</p>
<p>It was one of the saddest moments on Young Sheldon when Missy was upset about not being able to play on the baseball team, but Dale relented and he and Meemaw began their relationship proper. However, Dr. John Sturgis is still in the picture as a friend of the Cooper family, and it&rsquo;s clear from the start that Dale and John don&rsquo;t get along. John tries unsuccessfully to spy on Dale in Young Sheldon season 3, episode 10, &ldquo;Teenager Soup and a Little Ball of Fib.&rdquo; This eventually prompts Dale to question Meemaw on why she ever dated him, but Meemaw defends John.</p>
<p>John &amp; Dale Don’t Get Along, Dale Continues To Help Missy
Season 3, Episode 11 - Episode 14</p>
<p>The Dale-John-Meemaw triangle comes to a head in Young Sheldon season 3, episode 13, &ldquo;Contracts, Rules and a Little Bit of Pig Brains,&rdquo; when they all end up on a camping trip together. The installment mainly sees Dale making fun of John and all of his eccentricities and the two have an argument. It ends with John leaving the campsite, much to George&rsquo;s displeasure. Though Meemaw doesn&rsquo;t end up with John, their prior relationship is a source of incredulity for Dale, who at least spent the earlier half of the episode helping Missy lead their team to victory.</p>
<p>Meemaw &amp; John Meet Dale’s Ex-Wife June, June Stirs Up Trouble
Season 3, Episode 15 - Episode 17</p>
<p>Reba McEntire was one of Young Sheldon&rsquo;s best guest stars, and she plays Dale&rsquo;s ex-wife June. People begin asking &ldquo;Who does Meemaw end up with?&rdquo; again when Meemaw runs into Dale&rsquo;s ex in episode 15, &ldquo;A Boyfriend&rsquo;s Ex-Wife and a Good Luck Head Rub,&rdquo; and she reveals some troubling things about their past relationship. The two end up hitting it off and are joined at the restaurant by John. Later, John asks Meemaw if June would be interested in him, and Meemaw gives him June&rsquo;s number. While June rejects his advances, she stirs up trouble by telling John he should hold out for Meemaw, as Dale is sure to mess up the relationship.</p>
<p>Meemaw &amp; Dale Commit To Exclusivity
Season 3, Episode 18 - Episode 19</p>
<p>The answer to who Meemaw ends up with became a little clearer when she and Dale decided to make their relationship exclusive in Young Sheldon season 3, episode 18, &ldquo;A Couple Bruised Ribs and a Cereal Box Ghost Detector.&rdquo; After questioning Georgie on the matter, Meemaw asks Dale point-blank if he&rsquo;s seeing anyone else. Dale admits that he isn&rsquo;t, though both of them are still friends with their exes John and June. The pair decide to make their relationship exclusive — but it doesn&rsquo;t last all that long.</p>

After a lucky streak, Dale and Meemaw hit the bar where she tells him to enjoy his retirement. He, in turn, proposes to her and tells her that he loves her.

<p>The drama ends with Georgie paying Dale back for the robbery with his own money, and Dale firing him. In season 3, episode 21, &ldquo;A Secret Letter and a Lowly Disc of Processed Meat,&rdquo; Meemaw is incensed over Georgie&rsquo;s termination and decides to take matters into her own hands.

Nevertheless, their relationship continues and Meemaw feels awkward when Dale invites her to his son&rsquo;s wedding in episode 9, &ldquo;Crappy Frozen Ice Cream and an Organ Grinder&rsquo;s Monkey.&rdquo; She does attend, but Dale becomes perturbed by his ex-wife June&rsquo;s much younger date and Meemaw loses her liking for June when she finds out June only brought her date to upset Dale.</p>

When Dale is forced to get a colonoscopy in episode 14, &ldquo;Mitch&rsquo;s Son and the Unconditional Approval of a Government Agency,&rdquo; he suggests that Meemaw get one as well. Meemaw adamantly rejects this idea at first, but after a game of pool, the pair decides to go together.</p>
<p>Dale &amp; Meemaw Help June Recover &amp; Get Into An Argument

She&rsquo;ll be staying with Dale temporarily in Young Sheldon season 7, but audiences will have to wait and see what that does for their relationship.</p>
