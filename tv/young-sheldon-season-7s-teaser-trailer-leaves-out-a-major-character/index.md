# Young Sheldon Season 7s Teaser Trailer Leaves Out A Major Character


## SUMMARY 



  Young Sheldon season 7&#39;s teaser trailer doesn&#39;t mention Paige at all, implying that she won&#39;t appear or have a major role in the upcoming season.   Despite her important role in previous seasons, it seems like Young Sheldon season 7 may ignore Paige entirely, as she was never mentioned in The Big Bang Theory and had limited contact with Sheldon and Missy in her last appearance.   Viewers are unsure if Paige will return in season 7, but it would be fitting for the show to explain her absence from the spinoff&#39;s predecessor, as she was Sheldon&#39;s fellow child prodigy and deserves a proper sendoff.

## Literature Review
While Young Sheldon season 7&#39;s first teaser trailer promises plenty of plot twists, one major character is conspicuously absent from the promo.




The teaser trailer for Young Sheldon season 7 builds on last season&#39;s big stories, but there is one notable character who is entirely left out. This final season of the Big Bang Theory spinoff will have a hard time wrapping up all its narratives in only 14 episodes. It must address or alter major canon events like George Sr.’s affair, his sudden death, George and Mandy’s breakup, and Sheldon’s transfer to Caltech. However, it will be tricky to fit all of these storylines into a shorter season while also finding time for comic relief, since Young Sheldon is primarily a sitcom.




As Young Sheldon season 7’s release date approaches, it is becoming clear that the series might handle this problem by dropping minor storylines that are too inconvenient for the show. Some plots cannot be ignored since they are pivotal to The Big Bang Theory’s version of Sheldon as a character. George Sr.’s affair and death were both referenced numerous times throughout the earlier series, so it wouldn’t make sense for Young Sheldon to end before these events occurred. However, Young Sheldon season 7 could opt to ignore characters and plots that weren’t mentioned in the The Big Bang Theory.


 Paige Doesn’t Appear In Young Sheldon Season 7’s Teaser Trailer 
McKenna Grace&#39;s fan-favorite Young Sheldon character is notably absent.
         

In setting up the spinoff’s final outing, the Young Sheldon season 7 teaser trailer doesn’t mention Paige at all. Although her absence from the earlier show is arguably the biggest of Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory&#39;s canon problems, the teaser implies that she won’t appear in season 7 or, at the very least, won’t play a major role in proceedings. Granted, the teaser is a collection of clips from season 6. However, the trailer included clips from a wide variety of other storylines, so there was ample opportunity for the teaser to add a clip of Sheldon, Missy, and Paige interacting from either of her season 6 appearances.





 



Paige fulfills a vital role by acting as his rival, crush, friend, and foil in various appearances.




The teaser made it clear that George Sr. and Mary’s marriage, Georgie and Mandy’s baby, Sheldon’s academic future, Meemaw’s demolished businesses, and Missy and George Sr.’s troubled relationship will all figure in season 7. As such, it is notable that Paige is missing from this lineup. Paige has played a major role in every season of the spinoff, particularly because Young Sheldon doesn’t usually include The Big Bang Theory’s main characters in its cast. Sheldon has not met his future best friends and love interest when the spinoff takes place, so Paige fulfills a vital role by acting as his rival, crush, friend, and foil in various appearances.




                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Has A Devastating Way To Bring Back The Big Bang Theory&#39;s Main Characters   Young Sheldon season 7 can bring back The Big Bang Theory&#39;s main characters for cameos when the spinoff finally addresses one major canon event.    



 Young Sheldon Season 7 May Ignore Paige Entirely 
          

Despite her important role, it looks like Young Sheldon season 7 may simply ignore Paige’s existence. After all, Paige was never mentioned in The Big Bang Theory and both Missy and Sheldon were told to have no more contact with her in her last season 6 appearance. It would make perfect sense if that was the final time that Sheldon or Missy saw Paige since her mother insisted that the Cooper family was a bad influence on her daughter after Missy and Paige’s risky road trip. That said, season 5 also made it look like the series was finished with Paige when she ran away from college due to depression.




Even though this seemed like a dark end to her story of academic over-achievement, McKenna Grace’s character soon returned in season 6 to sneak into frat parties and take Missy across state lines in a stolen pickup truck. As such, viewers can’t be certain that season 7 won’t bring back this fan-favorite character. This is a good thing since Young Sheldon’s final outing owes viewers an explanation for Paige&#39;s absence from the show’s predecessor. While Young Sheldon’s best finale brought back The Big Bang Theory’s heroes, Paige was Sheldon’s only fellow child prodigy in every other episode of the spinoff. This means she deserves a fitting sendoff.



 Young Sheldon Season 7 Should Explain Paige’s TBBT Absence 
          

McKenna Grace is likely busy with other projects, like the upcoming Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which would explain a smaller role in Young Sheldon season 7. Furthermore, it will be tough for the spinoff to explain why Sheldon never brought up one of his closest childhood friends when Paige was a formative crush, academic sparring partner, and confidante. However, the show still owes viewers some explanation for this discrepancy thanks to the character’s popularity. For all Young Sheldon’s Paige problems, the character is deservedly loved by viewers. As such, Young Sheldon season 7 needs to bring her back to justify why The Big Bang Theory’s hero never mentioned his old friend.
