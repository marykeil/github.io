<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives star Meri Brown&rsquo;s changing after leaving uber-patriarch Kody Brown. Is the formerly mild-mannered star just an egomaniac now?</p>
<p>Sister Wives season 18 star Meri Brown&rsquo;s got a new man, Amos Andrews, and that&rsquo;s just one reason why her post-Kody life may be going to her head. For years, Meri was a timid presence on the series. After being mocked and ostracized due to an unfortunate catfishing incident, she seemed to shrink away from confrontation. Now, she&rsquo;s more than willing to get in the ring. Since Meri gave up on Kody, she&rsquo;s been growing as a person. While she blooms, she may be getting hooked on showing off her new and empowered image.
For Meri, leaving Kody means getting more attention than ever, and his ex seems to love the spotlight. She&rsquo;s even dialed down her cryptic posts lately. Meri&rsquo;s really living it up right now, but she may be riding for a fall. Yes, she&rsquo;s got a new man, and she&rsquo;s proud of him, but her relationship with Amos could fall apart soon enough. Meri doesn&rsquo;t have the best track record. She and Kody could never get on the same page, and she was unwilling to really have it out with him. While she&rsquo;s bolder now, her communication skills aren&rsquo;t the best. If Meri keeps flaunting her new life, she may end up with egg on her face.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  Meri Brown Went Public With Her New BF Amos Andrews Too Soon
Meri May Regret Flaunting Her New Romance</p>
<p>Meri watched Christine get accolades for finding a new man and marrying him. Now, Meri may be trying to do the same thing. However, showing off her love interest Amos could backfire. Meri&rsquo;s been out of the dating game for decades, and her attempt to build a connection with a catfish still casts a long shadow.
Is Meri&rsquo;s ego pushing her to move too fast with her partner and put their relationship out there? Maybe. If so, that&rsquo;s quite understandable. Meri actually suffered a lot during her marriage-turned-spiritual union with Kody. He really put the screws to Meri, frequently humiliating her when she made efforts to improve their relationship. He wasn&rsquo;t shy about letting the world know just how disinterested he really was. In front of millions of viewers, he went out of his way to make Meri feel small.
While it&rsquo;s not a surprise that she wants to flaunt her new man, she could be setting herself up for failure. By letting fans know everything about Amos and how her relationship&rsquo;s going, she&rsquo;s inviting so much criticism. If things start to go wrong in her romance, followers may attack her. If that happens, Meri may experience setbacks on her post-Kody journey. She might be pulled back into self-doubt and timidness.
Waiting until her romance was more solid would have been a smarter decision.</p>
<p>7  Meri Brown&rsquo;s Showing Off A Hair Transformation
Why Does Meri Brown Keep Changing Her Hair?</p>
<p>Meri recently went back to light brown hair after trying out a red-hot hue that wasn&rsquo;t the ideal complement to her medium skin tone. Now, she&rsquo;s gone back to the color that&rsquo;s most flattering. While Meri&rsquo;s redhead experiment was fun, it&rsquo;s over, and Meri&rsquo;s looking great right now. Throughout her hair makeover, she&rsquo;s shared new pictures with her followers. They&rsquo;ve been a part of her hair transformation. Now that Meri&rsquo;s returned to what seems to be her natural color, she&rsquo;s radiant. However, she may be too into her looks lately.
In the past, Meri wasn&rsquo;t shy about showing off fashion, but she wasn&rsquo;t really creative with her hair. When she went red, she got tons of attention. That might have inspired her to make more changes. Hopefully, she&rsquo;s changing her hair for the right reasons. Meri&rsquo;s her own woman now, even though she&rsquo;s got a new man, and she should be tweaking her image just to feel happy. She shouldn&rsquo;t do it to get praise from her followers.
It&rsquo;s actually nice to see Meri showing some ego. She&rsquo;s been through the wringer and has every right to enjoy her face and body. She doesn&rsquo;t need to be perfect to have that confidence. It&rsquo;s about the energy that she exudes. She seems like a happy woman and there&rsquo;s nothing more attractive than happiness. No, it&rsquo;s not sultry, but when it&rsquo;s real, joy&rsquo;s very appealing.
Meri&rsquo;s showing a lot of confidence, but she may go too far with that. If she becomes an influencer who&rsquo;s all about her looks, her loyal followers may turn on her. She&rsquo;s walking a fine line. By getting so glamorous and flaunting that, she could actually alienate part of her fan base. They might prefer it if her appearance was more basic and relatable. So, Meri should love herself, but possibly tone down the hair transformation photos. She could:
show different moods online, rather than just bold confidence
stop showing off her new makeover
focus on showing fans who she is, rather than how she looks</p>
<p>6  Meri Brown&rsquo;s Been Dissing Kody Since They Split Up
Is Meri Brown Saying Too Much About The Patriarch?</p>
<p>When Meri appeared on the Sister Wives season 18 One-on-One special, she really unloaded. She didn&rsquo;t like the way that Kody ended their relationship, and she wasn&rsquo;t shy about calIing him out. What really bothered her was the fact that he made a public statement about their relationship being over, rather than telling her privately. According to her, he made the decision to end their spiritual union without any input from her. Meri said:
I deserve to have a conversation and to be told. That wasn&rsquo;t cool.</p>
<p>She went on to really twist the knife, adding that his declaration about their relationship was inappropriate. Onscreen, she said that his choice to break up with her without having a proper discussion first was rude, characterizing it as:
a really low, uncool way to do it</p>
<p>In the past, Meri wouldn&rsquo;t have gone so far. She would have been more diplomatic. However, she probably believed that he drew first blood by letting the world know he was done with her before talking to her about it. Now, the gloves are off. They&rsquo;re openly at war, and Meri may regret saying some of this stuff later on. They are parents who share one adult child, Leon Brown.</p>
<p>5  Christine Brown Didn&rsquo;t Invite Meri Brown To Her Wedding
Has Meri Brown Offended Christine Brown?</p>
<p>Meri Brown didn&rsquo;t score an invitation to one of the most coveted events of 2023 (at least, in the reality TV world). Meri was excluded from Christine&rsquo;s wedding and that didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed. In fact, it raised a lot of questions about Christine&rsquo;s relationship with her former fellow sister wife, Meri. Apparently, the two just aren&rsquo;t close, and maybe they never were. The fact that Meri wasn&rsquo;t at that celebration of love really underscored the fact that, for whatever reason, Christine doesn&rsquo;t consider Meri a part of her inner circle.
Kody stated that Christine:
lost her sh*t</p>
<p>when he said that he was considering reconciling with Meri. Apparently, according to the patriarch, who has some feuds of his own, there&rsquo;s bad blood between the two women. Christine&rsquo;s known for getting jealous, so if she really reacted like Kody said she did (and that&rsquo;s a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;), it might be because Kody wanted to get back together with Meri rather than her. However, since Christine seems to have moved on almost effortlessly, it might actually be because she doesn&rsquo;t like Meri.</p>
<p>4  Paedon Brown Said Terrible Things About Meri Brown
Paedon Brown Called Meri Brown An Abuser</p>
<p>Meri isn&rsquo;t Paedon Brown&rsquo;s favorite person. He claimed that she was unkind to him and other Brown kids when they were little. Paedon is bombastic, with the same swollen ego as his father, Kody. He&rsquo;s tangled with a lot of people and Meri&rsquo;s one of them.
When he accused her of being an abusive person, Meri didn&rsquo;t fight back, which was kind of strange. It seemed like Meri should directly address such strong allegations. Instead, she got cryptic, posting about being grateful for the good people in her life. Paedon wasn&rsquo;t one of the people she was talking about.
Did Meri deserve Paedon&rsquo;s criticism? It&rsquo;s possible. He memorably stated that she was really, really mean to some of the Brown children, including her. Via John Yates&rsquo; YouTube channel, Paedon responded to a question. The interviewer asked him if the abuse was verbal or more serious. He said:
Oh, it moves so far past verbal. Verbal basically stopped existing. No, we were never safe around her.</p>
<p>Is she secretly a bad person? Maybe she changed, but it seems like Meri can be cold, brittle and selfish. That&rsquo;s never her persona on Sister Wives or Instagram, but everyone has flaws. Meri could be hiding an ego, which is starting to come out more now that she&rsquo;s not in the plural marriage.</p>
<p>3  Janelle Brown Ripped Meri Brown Apart In A Tell-All Book
The Browns&rsquo; Book Is Called &ldquo;Becoming Sister Wives&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tell-all book came from the Brown family, so it&rsquo;s actually surprising how many juicy details were provided, including information about the feud between Janelle Brown and Meri. Apparently, when Janelle entered the plural marriage as wife number two, there was tension between her and Meri. Sister Wives&rsquo; Janelle Brown didn&rsquo;t feel welcome because Meri didn&rsquo;t like the way that she did things around the house. Janelle&rsquo;s more of a worker bee and maybe her domestic skills were lacking. Another scenario is that Meri was too hard on her, perhaps because she felt threatened by a new wife.
For whatever reason, these two just didn&rsquo;t get along. Janelle&rsquo;s fairly down to earth. Of all of Kody&rsquo;s wives, she was the most rational. Robyn can be kooky and she cries a lot. Meri used to act downtrodden, seemingly addicted to playing the victim. Christine would show her jealousy openly, showing the type of fiery temper that Kody never appreciates. Janelle, like Kody, was a breadwinner - she was practical and outdoorsy. So, it seems unlikely that Janelle would have done a lot to provoke Meri. It seems like Meri can be difficult behind the scenes.</p>
<p>2  Meri Brown Fights With A Lot Of People
Is Meri Brown A Different Woman When The Cameras Aren&rsquo;t Rolling?</p>
<p>Since Kody&rsquo;s been so negative about Meri in the past, he may know things about her that viewers don&rsquo;t. Meri didn&rsquo;t get invited to Christine&rsquo;s wedding and there must have been a reason for that. Meri&rsquo;s battled Kody&rsquo;s kids and fought with Janelle. Meri did seem to have a friendship with now-monogamous Robyn Brown but that may have been self-serving, as befriending Robyn got Meri closer to Kody. Overall, Meri&rsquo;s had her drama and disagreements. She may not be as meek and mild as she seemed to be onscreen. See her &ldquo;nice&rdquo; persona in the TLC clip shown above, as per YouTube.
Reality TV can bring out the worst in people, but most of the bad things said about Meri were based on behind-the-scenes interactions. That&rsquo;s why it seems like Meri may play up her sweet and demure image while she&rsquo;s being filmed. Possibly, she&rsquo;s very different when a camera crew isn&rsquo;t around. If so, the fact that her relationship with Kody was so negative makes more sense. It appeared that he was quite mean to her, but maybe she can be mean too? Paedon and Janelle both complained about Meri.</p>
<p>1  Did &ldquo;Womb Envy&rdquo; Trigger Some Of Meri&rsquo;s Problems?
Meri Brown Shares One Adult Child With Kody Brown</p>
<p>Leon&rsquo;s a brave person. They made the bold decision to transition even though the Brown family was steeped in old-school religion - a lot of the fan base is too. Leon&rsquo;s now distancing themself from the family, reportedly because their relatives, including Paedon and Kody, weren&rsquo;t supportive enough of their journey. So, Leon may not spend much time with Meri either. Meri wanted more children but had trouble conceiving. Perhaps womb envy changed Meri, making her more bitter. She watched the other sister wives have lots of kids but couldn&rsquo;t enjoy the same experience.
Now, Meri has likely fully accepted the fact that she&rsquo;s unlikely to have more children. At this stage in life, she may not want them. She&rsquo;s focusing on other things, including herself, and that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing. However, her bond with Leon should be one of her top priorities. Now that Meri&rsquo;s consumed with a new relationship, the Sister Wives star may not be nurturing her family ties the way that she should.

<p>Sister Wives<br>
Sister Wives season 18 featured some well-known cast members, including Kody, Robyn, Meri, Christine and Janelle Brown. During the season, some Brown kids showed up and shared their opinions on the family&rsquo;s problems - Paedon Brown was particularly frank about siding with his mom Christine.</p>
