## Literature Review
John Mulaney revealed in Baby J that he gave a now infamous GQ interview while under the influence of drugs, and the interviewer had no clue.




John Mulaney&#39;s 2023 Netflix special John Mulaney: Baby J has sparked a flurry of conversations, particularly around his candid reflections on a GQ interview. Mulaney, an acclaimed comedian known for his sharp wit and insightful humor, has been through a tumultuous period in his personal life, including struggles with addiction. The Baby J special doesn&#39;t feature Mulaney&#39;s typical funny bits, and the comedian instead discusses his personal challenges, providing an unfiltered glimpse into his experiences and the impact they had on his professional interactions, such as the GQ interview. During the special, Mulaney recounted his state during the GQ interview, revealing that he was under the influence at the time.




This revelation sheds new light on the interview, which, at the time, seemed to be just another quirky and humorous exchange typical of Mulaney&#39;s style. In the interview, after being asked simple questions by journalist Frazier Tharpe, John Mulaney gave bizarre answers, such as his diatribe about haunted houses and &#34;ghouls,&#34; which he reads out in the Baby J special and has &#34;no memory of giving.&#34; The comedian&#39;s comments in the Baby J special offer a deeper understanding of dealing with addiction in the public eye. His openness in discussing these issues not only reflects his personal growth but also contributes to a broader conversation about mental health and addiction.

 The GQ Interviewer Didn&#39;t Know John Mulaney Was High &amp; Thought He Was &#34;Lightly Trolling&#34; 
          




Frazier Tharpe, who conducted the now-notorious interview with John Mulaney, shared his perspective on the experience in light of Mulaney&#39;s revelations in the Baby J special. Tharpe admitted that during the interview, he was unaware of Mulaney&#39;s state and believed the comedian was merely engaging in a bit of playful trolling (via GQ). This assumption was grounded in Mulaney&#39;s reputation for his quick wit and tendency to weave humor into his responses. Tharpe&#39;s interpretation of the interview dynamics changed drastically after watching the Baby J special, where Mulaney disclosed his struggles with addiction and the fact that he was high during the GQ interview. Tharpe commented:



I spent most of the interview (done over the phone, not Zoom) thinking Mulaney was lightly trolling me... When he randomly mentioned to me that he was eating Froot Loops, it just felt like more zaniness from a comedian ready to turn everything into a bit—an extension of Mulaney’s boyish, wily charm.




Tharpe&#39;s reaction to this disclosure highlights the challenges in discerning the reality behind a public figure&#39;s persona, especially in the context of interviews. It also sheds light on the often-overlooked aspect of journalists misinterpreting their subjects&#39; intentions or states of mind. Though the interview was conducted two weeks before Mulaney checked himself into rehab, it was published after, following discussions between GQ and Mulaney&#39;s team. Tharpe&#39;s initial interpretation of Mulaney&#39;s behavior as trolling, and his subsequent realization of the deeper issues at play, underscores the complexity of interviewing public figures, particularly those dealing with personal struggles.

 Frazier Tharpe Saw John Mulaney&#39;s Baby J Special &amp; Got Pulled Into The Act 
          

Five months after the infamous interview, Frazier Tharpe got wind of John Mulaney discussing their interaction in his new comedy special, then called From Scratch. Tharpe and his friend David, a huge Mulaney fan, went to see the special and Mulaney flipped the script by questioning Tharpe on the spot about their interview. Tharpe said:



We interrupted, with honorable intentions, but Mulaney was ready for us. He proceeded to tweak the set in real time, asking to interview me about how he seemed during our 2020 conversation—and if I could tell anything was off. Not knowing John Mulaney personally, I could only yell back that I thought he seemed fine, as the audience roared with laughter. He finished reading the interview, saluted me one more time, and was gone.







Tharpe then expressed a sense of appreciation for Mulaney&#39;s honesty and insight. This experience served as a reminder of the human element in journalism and the unpredictable nature of interviewing celebrities. It highlighted the importance of empathy and the need to look beyond surface-level interactions. Tharpe&#39;s experience with the Baby J special and his subsequent reflections contribute to a larger conversation about the complexities of media&#39;s relationship with celebrities. Since leaving rehab, Mulaney has gone from one success to the next. John Mulaney joined the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish cast, released the universally acclaimed Baby J, and had an overwhelmingly positively received guest role in The Bear.
