According to Netflix&#39;s summary of the series, One Day follows Emma and Dexter on the night of their graduation, July 15th, 1988. It&#39;s on that night that the two meet, and the next morning, they go their separate ways. However, their saga proves to be a lot more complicated than just that one night.

2024 will be a big year for Hathaway, with intriguing projects ahead. Though the movie version didn&#39;t land well with critics at the time, garnering lukewarm reviews, perhaps One Day will fare better as an episodic series, allowing more time to explore different periods of the characters&#39; lives. It may even convince audiences to revisit Hathaway&#39;s performance as Emma and look at it with fresh eyes.



One Day begins streaming on Thursday, February 8 on Netflix.
