## SUMMARY 



  Jenna Ortega&#39;s comments hint that Wednesday season 2 will be even better than season 1, thanks to more action and horror elements.   The focus of Wednesday season 2 should expand beyond the titular character to expand her development, allowing for exploration of other characters like Enid and Bianca.   With the addition of more horror elements, Wednesday season 2 could create a darker edge and potentially attract a larger fanbase, while also allowing for unique uses of powers and possible supernatural storylines.

## Literature Review

Jenna Ortega, who plays the titular character, has provided insight into Wednesday season 2, which suggests it&#39;ll be even better than season 1 was.




Details around Wednesday season 2 have been few and far between, but Jenna Ortega&#39;s comments suggest the sophomore season will be even better than season 1. Much of Wednesday season 1&#39;s success came from the creativity in bringing the already-familiar character into new settings, such as Nevermore Academy, and situations, like the more teen-drama aspect of Wednesday&#39;s love triangle with Tyler and Xavier. While some elements of season 1 will change, like including the Addams family&#39;s mansion, existing attributes should be expanded.




Of course, the titular character, played by Jenna Ortega, will be a focus of Wednesday season 2. But after the positive reception to other characters, like Enid or Bianca, there&#39;s room to explore those around Wednesday too. Additionally, Wednesday season 1&#39;s finale set up the next mystery as her stalker was introduced through text messages. Setting up a new mystery for season 2 that revolves around Wednesday coincides with some of Ortega&#39;s comments, creating even more anticipation for a familiar yet more refined story.

                  Wednesday Cast &amp; Character Guide   Jenna Ortega leads Netflix&#39;s Wednesday, but she&#39;s backed by a strong supporting cast playing Addams Family characters, like Wednesday&#39;s mom Morticia.   


 Wednesday Season 2 Is Leaning More Into Horror (Which The Show Needed) 
          




In Jenna Ortega&#39;s Wednesday season 2 comments, she reconfirmed previous teases of a horror tone that steers away from the more teen romance approach season 1 took. Ortega shared, &#34;I&#39;ve received some scripts for the second season, and we&#39;re definitely leaning into more horror.&#34; This could help fix some of the hurdles Wednesday season 1&#39;s highest-rated episodes revealed, namely the confusing overall tone. Additionally, the show could benefit from a tone more in-line with the spookier side long-time Addams Family fans associate with the character.

More horror also could add a darker edge to the show, which could potentially extend the fanbase, especially if more teen drama tropes like the love triangle are omitted. Horror also allows more unique uses of Wednesday and the other Nevermore kids&#39; powers against an even more evil villain. Additionally, the mystery angle from season 1 could be flipped to include more horror tropes, such as scares, monsters with better CGI or even practical effects, and perhaps allow more supernatural storylines in Wednesday season 2 to follow up on the potential effects of Goody resurrecting the titular character.






 Wednesday Season 2â€™s Episodes Will Feel Like Movies 
         

Although the aesthetic of Wednesday season 1 is already established, especially since much of the show is centered around the grays and blue hues of Nevermore, making season 2 more cinematic from a storytelling perspective could enhance the show further. Ortega said, &#34;Everything&#39;s bigger&#34; [and] more action-packed. I think each episode will probably feel a little bit like a movie.&#34; What this suggests is that, with the added horror, more danger and potentially higher stakes should be expected. This can easily facilitate more action, such as magical fights or chases.

Audiences caught glimpses of this toward the end of season 1 when Wednesday and Enid faced Tyler as the Hyde monster, as well as the fight against Crackstone. With season 2 expected to increase this, it&#39;s plausible that the locations, number of participants, and narrative weight of future fights are even more. A more action-packed season could also achieve a movie-like feel with well-structured pacing that gives audiences more balanced episodes, potentially suggesting that less exposition-heavy episodes may be in this season. In conjunction with horror, this implies a gripping viewing experience is to come.

 Wednesday Season 2 Is Giving Jenna Ortegaâ€™s Character An Arc (Without Changing Her) 
          

It&#39;s arguable that much of Wednesday&#39;s story in season 1 was centered around external factors - relationships, the Crackstone mystery, her parents&#39; Nevermore past. Ortega shared, &#34;It&#39;s really, really exciting because all throughout the show, Wednesday does need a bit of an arc.&#34; With Ortega&#39;s excitement about Wednesday&#39;s trajectory, it&#39;s possible her character will grow even more, potentially learning more about herself and her powers. Shining a light on this will only enrich her as an already compelling character, and make for new storytelling avenues in the series.




With that being said, Ortega also confirmed that &#34;[Wednesday] never really changes and that&#39;s the wonderful thing about her.&#34; This indicates that season 2 won&#39;t introduce any extremely different changes to the character, still staying true to the macabre twist she&#39;s known for and the developed sympathetic side season 1 introduced, which was seen through her friendship with Enid and her interactions with Bianca. With tonal changes expected and romance being toned down, anchoring the titular character in familiarity helps solidify her as the driving force within the Wednesday series, while also opening space to explore other sides of her.



All episodes of Wednesday season 1 are available on Netflix.
