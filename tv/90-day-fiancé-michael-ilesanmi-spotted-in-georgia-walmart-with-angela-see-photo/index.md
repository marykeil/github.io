## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Michael Ilesanmi has finally arrived in the U.S. Michael can be seen together with his wife, Angela Deem, shopping at a Walmart.




90 Day Fiancé star Michael Ilesanmi has seemingly arrived in the U.S. according to a photo of the Nigerian man clicked in Georgia with his wife Angela Deem. Michael is a 35-year-old from Lagos who met Angela, 57, on Facebook before starting a long-distance relationship with her. Angela faced several challenges in her romance with Michael apart from their 22-year age gap. Michael&#39;s K-1 visa was denied, and Angela decided a spousal visa was a better option. Angela and Michael married in January 2020 in Nigeria but four years went by with her waiting for him to arrive. In the past four years, Angela underwent a 100-pound weight loss.




Michael also cheated on Angela with a younger American girlfriend, but Angela didn&#39;t divorce him, and Michael is now in the U.S. (as shared by Redditor u/lexi4020.)


 

The 90 Day Fiancé viewer shared a photo captioned, &#34;Michael and Angela spotted at Walmart.&#34; The picture shows Angela and Michael standing side by side while waiting at the checkout counter. Some fans, however, refused to believe the photo was new since Michael and Angela were previously photographed at a supermarket which turned out to be one located in Nigeria. &#34;That’s the new Pepsi logo on bottles in the soda refrigerator so not an old photo. The new logo just started showing up in the fall of this year,&#34; added julekal.

 What&#39;s Next For Angela &amp; Michael On 90 Day Fiancé? 
          

The OP commented, &#34;Confirmed by the matching orange decal thanks to a link of the minute key location from another comment,&#34; and provided the location for the Walmart Angela and Michael were seen at. They confirmed it was the Walmart Supercenter located in Hazlehurst, Georgia. Angela is a Hazlehurst woman, and it seems Michael is now staying with her in her family home. Considering all signs point towards Michael&#39;s visa having finally been approved, 90 Day Fiancé fans are overjoyed that he&#39;s finally made it to America. Angela and Michael met sometime in 2017 and premiered on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 2.

Angela and Michael got engaged in 2018 and two years later, their wedding ceremony was documented in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 5. Angela spent the rest of the years trying to lose weight using bariatric surgery and later trying to stop Michael from straying. Angela found out that Michael had made an Instagram account and was chatting with a 30-year-old American woman and making plans to meet her in America. Angela decided she would divorce Michael. She brought along divorce papers to 90 Day: The Last Resort. Fortunately for the two of them, therapy worked out in their favor.




Angela told Michael, &#34;I should have left you many times, but I love you. Don’t take that for granted.” She told him she loved him and the two decided to stay together and give their marriage a chance. Michael getting his visa approved finally makes a great storyline for a future 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. The controversial couple is sure to be seen back together on screen soon as they explore a new married life in America.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
