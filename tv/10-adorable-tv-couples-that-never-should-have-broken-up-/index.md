## Literature Review
There are many on and off-screen reasons for a beloved couple to break up on a TV show, but when it&#39;s a couple worth rooting for it&#39;s hard to let go. 




Whether a main or secondary couple, when two characters have a great relationship, but can&#39;t make it work, it&#39;s easy to feel as though the couple should have stayed together for the long haul. For these couples, the breakups might not just be a blow to the show, but also to the arcs of the characters. Ending up with the wrong person can seriously disrupt the direction that a compelling character was headed, and change the outcome of their story.
Breaking a couple up can often increase the drama and intrigue of a TV relationship, but they&#39;re not always permanent. Even once a couple calls it quits, it&#39;s possible that they could get back together in the future, and that it&#39;s not improbable to hold out hope. Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t always the case, and when these couples break up, it is the permanent end of the romantic component of their relationship. Sometimes this is because of contractual issues with the actors, and others it&#39;s simply because the writers decided to go in a different direction.

Some of the most romantic couples on television have been ruined by terrible storylines, stopping them from being enjoyable to audiences.



 10  Lane &amp; Dave - Gilmore Girls (2000 - 2007) 
Broke Up Season 4
        

 Gilmore Girls 

 Release Date   October 5, 2000    Cast   Lauren Graham , Scott Patterson , Sean Gunn , Keiko Agena , Matt Czuchry , Alexis Bledel , Yanic Truesdale , Kelly Bishop , Melissa McCarthy , Edward Herrmann , Liza Weil , Jared Padalecki , Milo Ventimiglia    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   7    Story By   amy sherman-palladino    Writers   Amy Sherman-Palladino    Network   The WB    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




If there was any way to avoid the breakup between Lane (Keiko Agena) and Dave (Adam Brody) it should have been done. This couple rivaled any of Rory&#39;s (Alexis Bledel) or Lorelai&#39;s (Lauren Graham) relationships, with the bonus of being healthy for both partners. Unfortunately, Dave left the show because Brody had other opportunities, and after that, Lane&#39;s character arc went downhill. She ended up with Zack (Todd Lowe), who held her back in her music career and didn&#39;t follow any of the dreams that Dave was so supportive of. Lane deserved a lot better, and she deserved to get it with Dave.





 9  Nate &amp; Serena - Gossip Girl (2007 - 2012) 
Broke Up Season 3



When it&#39;s revealed at the end of Gossip Girl that Dan (Penn Badgley) has been Gossip Girl the entire time, it&#39;s shocking that Serena (Blake Lively) forgave him, and the fact that she married him was a disservice to her other relationships. Namely, with Nate (Chace Crawford), with whom she had more in common and better chemistry. Part of why Serena and Dan come into conflict is because they&#39;re from different worlds. Nate and Serena understand each other, and Nate is more willing to take Serena as she is instead of trying to change her like Dan. Despite this, Serena doesn&#39;t see Nate as a serious contender for her heart.





 8  Haley &amp; Andy - Modern Family (2009 - 2020) 
Broke Up Season 7
        

 Modern Family 

 Release Date   September 23, 2009    Cast   Ed O&#39;Neill , Sofia Vergara , Julie Bowen , Ty Burrell , Jesse Tyler Ferguson , Eric Stonestreet , Sarah Hyland , Ariel Winter , Nolan Gould , Rico Rodriguez    Genres   Comedy , Mockumentary    Rating   TV-PG    Seasons   11    Writers   Christopher Lloyd , Steven Levitan    Network   ABC    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu    Showrunner   Christopher Lloyd , Steven Levitan    



Despite being a fantastic pair with an epic love story, there&#39;s one big reason why Haley (Sarah Hyland) and Andy (Adam DeVine) broke up on Modern Family. When Adam gets a job opportunity in Utah, Haley insists that he take it despite their connection. It&#39;s a touching sacrifice that proves how much love they had for each other. After that, Haley gets back together with her high school boyfriend, Dylan (Reid Ewing), and ends up putting her career and ambitions on hold because of what happens between them. While this is a valid choice, it isn&#39;t in line with how Haley was with Andy, or for most of the series.





 7  Jackie &amp; Hyde - That ‘70s Show (1998 - 2006) 
Broke Up Season 7
        

 that 70s show 

 Release Date   August 23, 1998    Cast   Topher Grace , Mila Kunis , Ashton Kutcher , Mark Brazill , Laura Prepon , Wilmer Valderrama , Debra Jo Rupp , Kurtwood Smith    Main Genre   Comedy    Genres   Comedy , Sitcom    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   8    Writers   Mark Brazill , Bonnie Turner , Terry Turner    Network   FOX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu    




Despite being an on-again-off-again couple, Jackie (Mila Kunis) and Hyde (Danny Masterson) had great chemistry and were an interesting couple to root for. After Eric (Topher Grace) left the show, they were the most compelling pair on the show, but they ended up officially ending things at the end of season 7 when the drama became too much. Jackie was an independent person and reasonably could have ended up alone after this, but instead, the show had her end up with Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), which made less sense than her making things work with Hyde.





 6  Callie &amp; Arizona - Grey’s Anatomy (2005 - ) 
Broke Up Season 11
        

 Grey&#39;s Anatomy 

 Release Date   March 27, 2005    Genres   Romance , Drama    Seasons   19    Story By   shonda rhimes    Writers   Shonda Rhimes , Julie Wong , Jen Klein , Tameson Duffy , Meg Marinis    Network   ABC    Directors   Rob Corn , Kevin McKidd , Debbie Allen , Chandra Wilson , Allison Liddi-Brown , Jeannot Szwarc , Tony Phelan    Showrunner   Meg Marinis    




Many couples on Grey&#39;s Anatomy have unhappy ends to their relationships, and luckily Callie (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) don&#39;t end in disaster, but they don&#39;t end in total bliss either. After Arizona loses her leg in the wake of the plane accident and Callie refuses to save it, it&#39;s the beginning of the end for the pair. It&#39;s tragic as they go through so much and love each other fiercely, but Callie ends up moving to New York when Ramirez leaves the series.
Although Arizona did follow her a few years later when Capshaw left, there was still a lot of baggage for the pair to work through that may or may not have happened off-screen. In the short time they were on the show together after getting divorced, it changed the dynamic of the doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial. Of all the pairs on Grey&#39;s Anatomy, it felt like Callie and Arizona would go the distance.





 5  Willow &amp; Tara - Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997 - 2003) 
Broke Up Season 6


 Buffy The Vampire Slayer 

 Release Date   March 10, 1997    Cast   Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters    Genres   Action , Comedy , Drama , Horror , Supernatural    Seasons   7    Story By   joss whedon    Writers   Joss Whedon    Network   The WB    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43;    Directors   Joss Whedon    Showrunner   Joss Whedon    




Tara (Amber Benson) was Willow&#39;s (Alyson Hannigan) soulmate, and their breakup makes her death at the end of season 6 all the more devastating. When Tara helps Willow explore and embrace her sexuality in season 4, their relationship seems inevitable, and Willow becomes instantly devoted to the selfless Tara. However, when Willow goes down the path of dark magic in season 6, Tara reaches her breaking point and their relationship ends. This breakup is crushing for both characters but is made even worse when their brief reconciliation is cut short by violence.

 4  Alexis &amp; Ted - Schitt’s Creek 
Broke Up Season 6
        

 Schitt&#39;s Creek 

 Release Date   January 13, 2015    Cast   Catherine O&#39;Hara , Dan Levy , Noah Reid , Emily Hampshire , Tim Rozon , Dustin Milligan , Eugene Levy , Jennifer Robertson , Chris Elliott , Annie Murphy    Genres   Comedy    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6    Writers   Dan Levy , Eugene Levy , David West Read    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Showrunner   Dan Levy , Eugene Levy    




One of the most mature and heart-wrenching breakups on television is between Alexis (Annie Murphy) and Ted (Dustin Milligan) in Schitt&#39;s Creek. It takes a long time for the couple to reconcile after their initial break up in season 2, but once they do, it&#39;s because they can fully commit to a loving and supportive relationship. Unfortunately, external obstacles get in the way, and they mutually agree it&#39;s for the best if they move on. Though Alexis choosing herself and her path over a partner is a sign of amazing growth, there could have been a way to keep the pair together without having to sacrifice their careers.





 3  Mike &amp; Tina - Glee (2009 - 2015) 
Broke Up Season 4
        

 Glee 

 Release Date   May 19, 2009    Cast   Dianna Agron , Chris Colfer , Jessalyn Gilsig , Jane Lynch , Jayma Mays , Kevin McHale , Lea Michele , Cory Monteith , Matthew Morrison , Amber Riley    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Musical    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6    Writers   Ian Brennan , Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk    Network   FOX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu    Showrunner   Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk    




When Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) chooses Mike (Harry Shum Jr.) over Artie (Kevin McHale), it&#39;s a huge step forward, as Artie doesn&#39;t treat her well, and she&#39;s become more confident in her decisions. Despite their positive relationship full of love and mutual respect, when Mike leaves for college at the end of season 3, they break up that summer and are broken up once season 4 starts. The series as a whole had a massive overhaul at the start of season 4, but Mike and Tina&#39;s relationship being a casualty of these changes was a misstep.





 2  Jane &amp; Michael - Jane The Virgin (2014 - 2019) 
Broke Up Season 5
        

 Jane the Virgin 

 Release Date   October 13, 2014    Cast   Gina Rodriguez , Andrea Navedo , Justin Baldoni , Ivonne Coll , Brett Dier , Jaime Camil    Genres   Comedy , Satire    Seasons   5    Writers   Jennie Snyder Urman    Network   The CW    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , Apple TV&#43;    Directors   Melanie Mayron    Showrunner   Jennie Snyder Urman    




Once Jane (Gina Rodriguez) and Michael (Brett Dier) got married, it seemed their fate was sealed, and there would be no more complications. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth, as Michael dies not long after their wedding in season 3, and then is revealed to have been alive the whole time in season 5. While this revelation is shocking enough, it&#39;s made even more shocking by the fact that he has no memory of Jane or who he was.
Though he does regain his memory and the couple tries to give their relationship another shot, it&#39;s not to be. The breakup was the nail in the coffin, but all the twists should have been avoided, so the couple could live happily ever after. Jane ends up with Rafael (Justin Baldoni), the father of her child, but their relationship will always feel more like a concession rather than true love.





 1  Nick &amp; Lindsay - Freaks and Geeks (1999 - 2000) 
Broke Up Season 1


Freaks and Geeks 

Release Date   September 25, 1999    Cast   James Franco , Busy Philipps , Jason Segel , Linda Cardellini , John Francis Daley    Genres   Drama    Seasons   1    Writers   Paul Feig    Network   NBC    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Paramount&#43;    Directors   Paul Feig , Judd Apatow    




Lindsay (Linda Cardellini) is enamored with Daniel (James Franco), but when he doesn&#39;t return her affections, she settles for Nick (Jason Segal). Though this isn&#39;t a promising start to a relationship, Lindsay and Nick make a sweet pair, and it&#39;s clear that he really cares about her. Unfortunately, Lindsay isn&#39;t ready for the kind of relationship he wants and doesn&#39;t share the strength of his feelings. It&#39;s not unexpected when they break up, but given time, it would&#39;ve been nice to see them come back together and realize their chemistry.
