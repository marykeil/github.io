## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Daniele Gates is currently rebuilding her life in New York City after a disastrous international relationship.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Daniele Gates found out that gold digger Yohan Geronimo had been carrying on a torrid affair for two full years and now, she&#39;s letting her Instagram followers know how good single life can be. While her most recent post was all sunshine and roses, one from a bit further back seemed very cryptic, as Daniele opened up about, &#34;transactional relationships.&#34; While she may be a little passive-aggressive at the moment after a relationship that failed spectacularly, Yohan&#39;s ex Daniele&#39;s moving forward in the Big Apple. She&#39;s enjoying some Sex and the City-style good times.

 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Daniele Gates Shared A Fun &#34;Date Night&#34; Idea 
Is Daniele Gates Really Over Cheating Yohan Geronimo?

 

During Daniele&#39;s cheery Big Apple &#34;date night&#34; post, she showed off a culinary adventure in her home city. However, her dream was to soak up the sun in the Dominican Republic. She actually wanted to escape from the hustle and bustle of New York City, as well as the extremely high cost of living. She gave up a pension to try her luck with Yohan, and in retrospect, that wasn&#39;t the wisest financial decision she&#39;s made. However, she looked on the bright side when she embarked on a pasta-making experience.






 Daniele Gates Ignored The Red Flags 
Yohan Geronimo Was Obviously Not Sincere
         

Daniele has been through the wringer. She trusted the wrong man (Yohan may never make it to America now), and it was almost hard to believe that she didn&#39;t see the red flags. She sacrificed so much for a guy who got a dollar sign tattoo after they met! Did he have to write it in the sky? Unfortunately, Daniele was perhaps blinded by love. For whatever reason, she believed in her partner. Sadly, what anyone who watched her TOW season intuitively understood was that Yohan wasn&#39;t in it for love. Now, she&#39;s letting her followers know how to enjoy date nights in New York City, although she may not be dating herself.

In the &#34;transactional relationship&#34; post that she added recently, she applied hand cream while saying that transactional relationships are just fine as long as both people know what they&#39;re getting into. It was so obviously a dig at her ex, who duped her into thinking that he cared about her, rather than a Green Card. Daniele, who has a tattoo of Yohan on her body, has lived and learned, and she should be commended for living in the moment, rather than looking back. It may take her a while to really wrap her head around everything that&#39;s happened, but she&#39;s trying.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way romances are a gamble, and love can be a losing game. Daniele rolled the dice and lost, but she has her whole life ahead of her. This relationship doesn&#39;t have to define her forever. 




Life after heartbreak can be good. Romantic woes are tough but they can teach a person to focus on what&#39;s working in their life. Yohan was one of the most blatant and shameless 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way gold diggers, and he broke Daniele&#39;s heart. By thinking of herself, rather than the guy who sent a racy photo to another woman while she passed out Christmas presents in his neighborhood, she can build a brighter future. No one deserves what Daniele got from Yohan.
