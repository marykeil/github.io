# Stranger Things  Original Setting Is Actually The Perfect Choice For A Spinoff Show


## SUMMARY 



  Hawkins, Indiana is the central location of Stranger Things, but it was originally going to be set in Montauk, New York, a real town with ties to Steven Spielberg and conspiracy theories.   The fictional town of Hawkins grounds the series and creates a relatable small-town charm, which would have been lost in the coastal setting of Montauk.   While Stranger Things ended up in Hawkins, a spinoff set in Montauk could expand the franchise and explore new locations and conspiracy theories, making it an exciting prospect for future storytelling.

## Literature Review
With so much talk about potential Stranger Things spinoffs, it turns out that there is already a location that could be used for the next installment.




Once Stranger Things ends, the possibilities for where its spinoffs could go are going to be endless, however, there is one location that was almost used instead of Hawkins, Indiana that could be a great place to start. Stranger Things is a sci-fi series that first premiered on Netflix in 2016 and has now run for four seasons, with Stranger Things season 5 slated to drop in 2025. The series takes place in the 1980s in the fictional Hawkins, Indiana, where odd occurrences are taking place, including the disappearance of a young boy, and the introduction of a strange little girl named Eleven.




Although Stranger Things is bursting with unique plot points and details, from Dungeons and Dragons monsters to 1980s pop culture references, one underrated aspect of the series is its setting. Despite the fact that Hawkins, Indiana is not a real place, it really grounds the series. Hawkins is where all these inexplicable events are happening. Hawkins is the place the characters cannot escape. Really, Hawkins is at the center of it all. However, it turns out that Hawkins, Indiana was not always going to be the center point of Stranger Things. In fact, it was going to be a real American town.


 Stranger Things Was Almost Set In Montauk, New York 
         

Before the Duffer Brothers officially set Stranger Things in Hawkins, Indiana, the series was going to take place in Montauk, New York. Unlike Hawkins, Indiana, Montauk is a real town located on Long Island in New York. It is not only an actual place where people live, but it also has some cultural relevance as well. For example, Steven Spielberg, who is a major influence on the Duffer Brothers, set his 1975 horror movie, Jaws, in Montauk. Additionally, Montauk is a location shrouded in conspiracy, including a specific theory called the &#34;Montauk Project,&#34; which suggested that there were secret government experiments taking place there surrounding mind control and unexplained species.




Considering all this information, it is not a surprise that Stranger Things was going to be set in Montauk. This real-life town encapsulates everything that the series already does with Hawkins. Montauk not only offers a place for the characters to live, but it also has a built-in ambiance of unexplained and odd occurrences. Plus, its Steven Spielberg ties make it even more meaningful for the Duffer Brothers. However, Montauk was ultimately replaced with Hawkins, likely because using a fictional place was less complicated than implicating a real town.



Stranger Things was not only going to be set in Montauk, New York, but its original title was also &#34;Montauk.&#34;






 The Netflix Show Wouldn&#39;t Be As Charming In New York (But A Spinoff Could Happen There) 
          




Although Montauk has the perfect elements for Stranger Things, it is a good thing that the series ended up in Hawkins. For one thing, the settings&#39; visuals and vibes would have looked quite different. While Hawkins elicits a Midwestern ambiance that is full of colors like yellow, brown, and green, Montauk is much more coastal. In terms of color, it would look much more blue. Furthermore, Hawkins has an essence of charm to it, as if it could be any small town in America. On the other hand, Montauk is firmly Montauk. It would be harder for audiences to find relatability in that if they did not live there themselves.

However, this does not mean that Montauk should remain cast aside. Stranger Things may have replaced Montauk with Hawkins, but if the show does expand into spinoff series, then Montauk could certainly come back as a location for a new Stranger Things show. As previously mentioned, Montauk has many useful and creepy elements to it that make it a perfect location for a Stranger Things spinoff. Furthermore, this new location could make a new series even more exciting, as audiences will have to figure out what is wrong with this town, just as they had to do with Hawkins.






 How Stranger Things&#39; Story Could Expand In A New York-Based Spinoff 
          

The biggest aspect of using Montauk in a Stranger Things spinoff is that it would expand the franchise beyond Hawkins. Though it seems risky, this move could increase the intrigue of the spinoff because it would show that the problems apparent in Stranger Things are not exclusive to Hawkins, but happen all over the country. Plus, Montauk has plenty of new aspects to offer. The spinoff could explore the ocean, could make trips into New York City, and could delve into Montauk&#39;s real history and conspiracy theories. All in all, if Stranger Things was to add a new location, Montauk would be the perfecr choice.
