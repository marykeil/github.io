## Literature Review
Cobra Kai has offered a multitude of exciting character team-ups, but several more still need to take place before the show ends for good.



Cobra Kai has packed its story with exciting team-ups, but some still need to happen before the series reaches its conclusion. Team-ups have become a common yet popular theme in Netflix&#39;s continuation of The Karate Kid trilogy.
Whether it be former enemies who put aside their differences to defeat a common foe or perhaps just longtime favorites who worked together after sharing hardly any screen-time, plenty of alliances have been created over the course of Cobra Kai&#39;s story.
Due to the forming of these partnerships, many are likely to be continued onscreen when Cobra Kai returns. Having joined forces with Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso in season 5, Karate Kid Part II villain Chozen is once again poised to be an ally in the fights to come. The same can also be said of Tory and Robby, who finally put to bed their respective rivalries with Sam and Miguel in Cobra Kai and subsequently fought on the same side. However, there are a few, noteworthy team-up scenarios that still need to be put to the small screen.



 7  Daniel LaRusso &amp; Mike Barnes 
        

Cobra Kai season 5, episode 3 saw Mike Barnes, decades after he terrorized Daniel in The Karate Kid Part III, make amends for what he did in the movie. Their reunion paved the way for Mike Barnes to show up in Cobra Kai season 5&#39;s ending where he helped Johnny fight Terry Silver&#39;s hired thugs. But because Daniel was unwilling to launch a reckless attack on Silver&#39;s house, no team-up between Daniel and Mike happened. That can be rectified in Cobra Kai season 6 if Mike Barnes returns. As a former national champion in karate, Mike can use his knowledge to help them win the Sekai Taikai.





 6  Chozen Toguchi &amp; Tory Nichols 
        

Cobra Kai season 5, episode 2 seemingly teased an interesting student-teacher duo when it paired off Tory and Chozen for one scene. They haven&#39;t spoken one-on-one since then, but that brief training session was enough to show that Chozen is capable of pushing Tory, possibly to new heights. With Tory no longer on Cobra Kai&#39;s side, Chozen taking her under his wing is now feasible for Cobra Kai&#39;s final season. Unlike Daniel and Johnny, he doesn&#39;t have a pupil of his own. Looking at how Tory&#39;s aggressiveness mirrors who Chozen used to be and the struggles he had in The Karate Kid Part II, they could be a perfect pairing.





 5  Anthony LaRusso &amp; Kenny Payne 






Among the only rivalries still alive and well after Cobra Kai season 5 is the one between Anthony LaRusso and Kenny Payne. Since Daniel&#39;s son became Kenny&#39;s bully in season 4, the two kids&#39; have had their roles reversed, with Kenny evolving into Terry Silver&#39;s top male student at Cobra Kai. Silver seemed to have lost his hold on Kenny in the finale when his schemes were exposed, which means that the door is now open for Kenny to change his ways. If such a thing happens, there&#39;s at least a chance he&#39;ll try to put the past behind him and team up with Anthony before all is said and done.





 4  John Kreese &amp; Kim Dae-eun 

When met by Terry Silver at the airport in her first appearance, Sensei Kim Dae-eun expressed her disappointment at Kreese&#39;s absence. Clearly, she admired Martin Kove&#39;s character and had looked forward to teaming up with him - not Silver. This alliance wasn&#39;t on the table in season 5 on account of Kreese&#39;s imprisonment, but depending on how things play out now that Kreese is on the loose, the two Cobra Kai villains can pursue their goals together. Kreese has had partners in both Silver and Johnny, but never someone who truly saw eye-to-eye with him. Sensei Kim could be that person for Kreese in Cobra Kai season 6.





 3  Robby Keene &amp; Eli &#34;Hawk&#34; Moskowitz 
        

Albeit reluctantly, Robby and Eli have been on the same side at two different points in Cobra Kai&#39;s run. The first was at the end of season 3 when a frustrated and jealous Eli found his Cobra Kai peers quickly warming up to Robby, who had been their enemy only recently. The second was in season 5, where Robby and Eli are both members of Daniel and Johnny&#39;s combined dojo. That said, they&#39;re far from friends, nor have they been in a situation where they had to rely on each other specifically. Rather, they were part of a much larger team-up in season 5&#39;s ending.
Similar to how Robby and Miguel fought and then overcame their problems, Robby and Eli can share a moment where their issues are worked out onscreen. Once its properly resolved, Cobra Kai can demonstrate their newfound dynamic by having Robby and Eli fight in tandem against a group of villains.





 2  Daniel LaRusso &amp; Julie Pierce 
        

It&#39;s already been confirmed that at least one character from The Karate Kid franchise that hasn&#39;t been in Cobra Kai yet will be on hand in season 6. That person may or may not be Hilary Swank&#39;s Julie Pierce, Mr. Miyagi&#39;s new protégé in The Next Karate Kid. When in keeping in mind the fact that the show has already used the majority of the classic Karate Kid characters, Julie is indeed a strong candidate for that role. If it is indeed her that&#39;s coming back, a team-up between Mr. Miyagi&#39;s only two students feels like a no-brainer for Cobra Kai&#39;s final chapter.





 1  Aisha Robinson &amp; Sam Lawrence 
        

Remembered as Cobra Kai&#39;s first female fighter, Aisha Robinson sadly stopped being relevant after the high school brawl in the season 2 finale. The show explained her absence by revealing that her family relocated and put her in a new school. It took a while, but the show finally acknowledged Aisha&#39;s importance to the show by giving her a cameo in season 4. Unfortunately, it&#39;s still a bit jarring that Johnny&#39;s second student fell to the wayside so quickly. Theoretically, Aisha may never return to Cobra Kai, but with it being the last season, it&#39;s only reasonable that the show tries to bring back everyone it can - and that includes characters who helped start its story in the first place.
As for how it could make use of her, Sam Lawrence provides the show with a great team-up opportunity. Due to the issues between the two dojos, as well as Sam not getting back into karate until the end of season 1, there was never a scenario where Aisha and Sam could fight together. But if Cobra Kai finds room for Aisha to re-enter the picture, the series can finally allow Sam a chance to fight beside her best friend, possibly in preparation for the Sekai Taikai.
