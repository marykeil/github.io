## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Ashley Michelle might be a professional witch, but she didn&#39;t need to use magic to drop 100 pounds in weight.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Ashley Michelle has lost 100 pounds since filming the show. 33-year-old Ashley, from Rochester, New York, met 35-year-old Manuel in Ecuador over 10 years ago. The construction worker had asked Ashley to dance with him at a bar on New Year’s Eve, and the two fell in love, only to get engaged within a week. However, Ashley and Manuel broke up once she went back home. They spent seven years apart but reconnected after Ashley broke up with her last boyfriend.




Tarot reader and astrologer Ashley lets spirituality guide every aspect of her life. Her relationship with Manuel has been a parade of red flags, especially Manuel’s attitude. He’s against Ashley doing witchcraft, wants her to send money to his family back home, and storms off when confronted about anything he does wrong. The only time Ashley and Manuel seem to get along is under the sheets. Fans and Ashley’s family alike have reservations about the couple Ashley and Manuel. However, Ashley is not letting the negativity in her relationship affect her health.

The next clip was of Ashley looking slimmer and wearing a figure-hugging salmon-colored gown. “Keep going. It’s not about doing two hours in the gym every day or going vegan or cutting out dairy,” Ashley wrote. “I have hit 100 lbs down this year,” she added while advising her followers that weight loss is not about “doing it all at once” but forming micro habits that turn into macro changes.
