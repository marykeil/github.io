  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Luke and Lorelai always had chemistry on Gilmore Girls, but it took the two Stars Hollow residents a long time to act on their love for each other.</p>
<p>Gilmore Girls remains a popular hit and much of the series&rsquo; run can be measured by the Luke and Lorelai timeline tracking their romantic relationship. The relationship that develops between Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) is one of the most beloved in the series. These two characters start as a coffee addict and a diner owner who see each other every day and slowly become close friends who realize that they have strong feelings for each other. It&rsquo;s a great character journey to witness.
Watch on Netflix
Though Gilmore Girls is really centered on the titular characters of Lorelai and her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), romance plays a huge role in the series. Lorelai hasn&rsquo;t had a successful relationship since breaking up with her daughter&rsquo;s father as a teenager, so her becoming willing to be in a serious relationship is part of her character&rsquo;s growth in the series. Though she has other relationships before she and Luke ultimately get together, Lorelai&rsquo;s best relationship in the series is certainly with the owner of the diner in Stars Hollow, and the Luke and Lorelai relationship timeline begins before the show even starts.</p>
<p>Gilmore Girls: 14 Moments That Led To Lorelai &amp; Christopher&rsquo;s Divorce
Lorelai and Christopher may have always loved each other in Gilmore Girls, but their relationship and quick marriage were full of red flags.</p>
<p>Before The Events Of Gilmore Girls
Luke and Lorelai First Meet In 1996</p>
<p>Though it&rsquo;s not revealed until much later in the series, Luke and Lorelai&rsquo;s relationship timeline begins years before the show. When the two finally have their first date, it&rsquo;s Luke who provides the audience with the details. Luke and Lorelai first meet when she moves to Stars Hollow and needs a serious coffee fix in 1996.
Luke reveals on their date that he even kept the fake horoscope she wrote and gave to him at the diner. In it, she foretold that Luke would meet a very annoying woman, and he would need to keep her supplied with coffee to get her to go away. That became the foundation of their friendship: every morning, she would stop at the diner for coffee, and sometimes, she would even stop multiple times a day. Lorelai becoming a regular at Luke&rsquo;s diner is how the two get to know one another so well before the show even begins.</p>

They slowly become more than just diner owner and customer, and it&rsquo;s clear that they&rsquo;ve got a nice friendship. As the season progresses, they begin flirting more and more, and Lorelai starts looking at Luke differently and thinking that he&rsquo;s attractive.
At Rory&rsquo;s 16th birthday party, Emily comments on the sparks flying between these characters, and when Richard has a heart attack, Luke drives Lorelai to the hospital and stays to offer support. While Lorelai falls for Max, when Luke&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend Rachel comes to town, she can tell that Luke loves Lorelai. Fans can tell that these two will eventually confess their love from so early on in the show. Luke also gives Lorelai advice about not worrying so much about Rory and Dean&rsquo;s relationship, and she leans on him all the time throughout the first season.</p>

After Luke&rsquo;s nephew Jess moves in with him, Luke and Lorelai&rsquo;s friendship becomes full of conflict. Lorelai thinks that Jess is trouble and Luke doesn&rsquo;t want to hear it, leading to several arguments throughout the season. Luke wants what&rsquo;s best for his nephew and sees the good underneath all the rebellion, and Lorelai wants to protect her daughter from him.
This is sad to see because after Lorelai breaks off her engagement with Max, fans can see that Luke is happy, and it seems like the perfect time for these two to finally start dating. Unfortunately, this doesn&rsquo;t happen just yet, and the two struggle to get along for quite a few episodes.</p>
<p>10 Harsh Realities About Lorelai&rsquo;s Character In Gilmore Girls

<p>Season 3 of Gilmore Girls sees Luke and Lorelai as good friends who work through their tension over Jess. Part of that is a result of Luke still treating Rory like his own daughter. Beyond Luke, Lorelai, and Rory still feeling like a small-town family, Luke and Lorelai both pursue other relationships during the season. It&rsquo;s a surprise when Luke marries Nicole, as it happens fast, and Nicole cheats on Luke, breaking his heart.
Viewers can tell that Lorelai doesn&rsquo;t love that Luke is with Nicole, just like he hated when she was engaged to Max, but she focuses on Rory&rsquo;s last year of high school and her plans to open up the Dragonfly Inn someday.</p>

<p>Though, ultimately, Luke and Lorelai admit their feelings for one another at the end of season 4, this Gilmore Girls season still has plenty of bumps and other events in the Luke and Lorelai relationship timeline. Nicole is still a bit of a hurdle at the start of the season, and Lorelai also spends much of the season dating someone else. It takes the two of them having heart-to-hearts about things that aren&rsquo;t romantic to finally tell one another the truth of their feelings.
It&rsquo;s things like Luke being the one to lend Lorelai the money to renovate the Inn that prove how much he cares about her. Unlike her mother, Luke doesn&rsquo;t expect to get anything out of the loan, just that Lorelai pays him back when she can. It&rsquo;s one of the many times in the show that Luke takes care of Lorelai and one of the moments that allows her to see him for more than just the grumpy guy who pours her coffee.
In the season 4 episode &ldquo;Last Week Fights, This Week Tights,&rdquo; Luke and Lorelai dance together, and Luke realizes that he&rsquo;s in love with her. He knows that Lorelai is the one for him and that he doesn&rsquo;t have to be scared anymore. He asks her to go out with him and fans definitely swoon remembering this sweet moment.
It&rsquo;s relatable that Luke feels strongly about Lorelai for a long time, and it&rsquo;s really nice to see him finally working up the courage to ask her out. This is the moment that everyone has been waiting for, and it seems like nothing can get in their way, but of course, there are still three more seasons of Gilmore Girls.</p>

Gilmore Girls fans just want this couple to stay together, as Luke&rsquo;s cynicism and Lorelai&rsquo;s zest for life work so well, and they are truly a perfect match. Luke helps calm Lorelai down, and she helps him become more optimistic and social.
Season 7 sees the two largely apart from one another. It&rsquo;s not until the end of the season that it&rsquo;s made clear that they are truly meant for one another. In the season 7 finale, they finally talk to each other again, and after a romantic kiss, viewers can be certain that they won&rsquo;t be apart again.

The topic provides a wedge between them for part of the revival as they don&rsquo;t address their real issues.
Lorelai attempts to work out her issues on her own, not telling Luke she&rsquo;s been attending therapy with her mother, and trying to isolate herself on a hike. In the end, she realizes that her relationship with Luke isn&rsquo;t one of the problems in her life, and she still wants to marry him.
