## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Women Tell All is coming up, and Gerry Turner will face the women he sent home. Plus, fans will finally know the final two. 




The Golden Bachelor&#39;s first Women Tell All episode is coming up this week, and there&#39;s a lot of anticipation on what to expect from it. In past seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, the Tell All episode is typically the episode the viewers look forward to the most throughout the season. The Tell All recaps what happened in the season and gives an update on what the contestants are up to now and how they feel about the lead post-breakup. The episode also features the lead apologizing to anyone they hurt during their season and gives a vague update on their love life.




Since this will be the first Tell All with The Golden Bachelor season 1, it may be slightly different from the regular Bachelor franchise series&#39;. Judging from the sneak peek viewers got after last week&#39;s episode, Gerry will break down in tears and apologize to one of the top three women for hurting them; however, it&#39;s unclear who Gerry is speaking to. There&#39;s also some fun and games that host Jesse Palmer has with the women before Gerry makes it to the stage. So far, The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Women Tell All looks like a must-see television event.

 The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Final Two Will Be Confirmed 
          




Last week&#39;s episode of The Golden Bachelor ended with a cliffhanger, leaving the audience wondering who Gerry sent packing after hometown dates. In the middle of Gerry making his decision, they cut to a preview of this week&#39;s episode, leaving the final two women unknown. Will Gerry send home Faith Martin or Theresa Nist? While that is still unknown, Reality Steve, the spoiler king for The Bachelor franchise, did reveal who he allegedly believes is sent home. He believes Faith is sent home during this rose ceremony, and Theresa and Leslie Fhima are Gerry&#39;s final two women. If this is true, they will get to meet Gerry&#39;s family in next week&#39;s episode.

Right before the Women Tell All, Gerry will pick his final two women. It will likely be an emotional moment for Gerry and the woman he sends home, but he has to decide in order to find the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with. His final two will finally be confirmed, and Gerry will likely speak on his last two with Jesse during the Women Tell All. During the rose ceremony, it was evident that Gerry had a tough time making his decision, and will touch on that during his segment on the Women Tell All. It&#39;s also the moment most viewers are looking forward to the most.






 Gerry Will Apologize To The Last Woman He Sent Home 

 

In the preview for The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Women Tell All, Gerry is shown getting emotional while talking to the last woman he sent home, which would be Faith or Theresa. Gerry is clearly overwhelmed with emotion, similar to how he was at the ceremony when he had to choose his final two. This is a new feeling for the 72-year-old as he&#39;s only ever been in love with his late wife, and now he has feelings for three women. It was a difficult decision for Gerry, but it&#39;s one he had to make.

During the Women Tell All, Gerry faces the last woman he sent home and is ready to apologize, even though this is the name of The Bachelor game. He clearly loved her but had stronger feelings for Leslie and the other woman he chose. Hopefully, there is no bad blood between Gerry and the woman he sends home, and they leave the Women Tell All on good terms.






 Viewers Will Be Reunited With The Golden Bachelor Cast 
          

Since they are down to the final 3, it&#39;s been a while since viewers have seen the entire The Golden Bachelor cast together. During the Women Tell All episode, all 22 contestants will get to sit around, hash out their differences, and reminisce on the good times they had with Gerry and their fellow The Golden Bachelor castmates. Judging by the recent preview, it doesn&#39;t seem like the women don&#39;t get too combative with each other, and for the most part, it&#39;s all love. Even Sandra Mason says she refers to her fellow castmates as her &#34;sister wives,&#34; which shows how close the women have become post-filming. Viewers cannot wait to see what the ladies have to say.



 They Will Likely Show A Preview Of The Golden Bachelor Finale 
          




At the end of every episode, a preview for the following episode is shown, so viewers will likely get a sneak peek of The Golden Bachelor finale. While it&#39;s unclear if the finale will air next week as the final two women still need to meet Gerry&#39;s family and go on their overnight dates, there is still a possibility they could air it all together. Even if the finale doesn&#39;t air next week, ABC might give fans a taste of what they can expect from the finale.

If a preview of the finale is shown, this will only add more excitement to The Golden Bachelor finale. It&#39;s probably the most anticipated part of the season and will likely be the most watched. Viewers want to see Gerry find his happily ever after.



 Will They Reveal The Golden Bachelorette? 
         

When a Bachelor or Bachelorette season ends, the next lead is typically announced at the Tell All. If The Golden Bachelor follows the same format, viewers could find out who The Golden Bachelorette is and if ABC will do a season for the women. Even though a Golden Bachelorette season hasn&#39;t been announced by the network, it would be surprising if it didn&#39;t happen. The Golden Bachelor has received nothing but praise from fans and critics, so it would be disappointing if the fans didn&#39;t get a female lead for the older crowd.




Theresa and Faith, who have yet to be confirmed as part of the final two, would be the best picks for The Golden Bachelorette. They both made it far enough in their journey to fall hard for Gerry, so they would likely be the top picks. Joan Sasso and April would also make great leads, as they both fell for Gerry but were unable to get there all the way. Nonetheless, The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Women Tell All will be one to remember.



The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
