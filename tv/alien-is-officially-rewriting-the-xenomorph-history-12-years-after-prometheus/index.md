# Alien Is Officially Rewriting The Xenomorph History 12 Years After Prometheus


## SUMMARY 



  Alien franchise is returning with a TV show and a movie in 2024, rewriting the history of the Xenomorph once again.   The upcoming Alien TV show will not adhere to the events of Prometheus and Covenant, which suggested the Xenomorph was a relatively new species born from David&#39;s experiments based on the Engineers&#39; research.   The show&#39;s different approach compared to Prometheus allows it to explore more traditional, self-contained Alien stories.

## Literature Review

From an ancient species to a bioweapon created by an android in the 22nd century, Alien’s titular creature has had some different origin stories.




Alien’s lore is always changing depending on the media or story, and the history of the Xenomorph is about to be rewritten again. The Alien franchise has been away from the big screen since Alien: Covenant’s poor box office performance in 2017 all but killed any chances of David’s story becoming a trilogy. The Xenomorph is returning to movie theaters in 2024 with the upcoming Alien: Romulus, but the saga’s canon is also expanding through a TV show.




Although not much is known about FX’s Alien series in terms of plots and characters, it is already one of the most exciting Alien projects in years. The show, which is being helmed by Noah Hawley (Fargo, Legion), marks the first time Alien will tell a story on TV. Even if the series does not focus on the origins of the Xenomorph, it is bound to rewrite the creature’s history after what was established in Prometheus (2011) and Alien: Covenant (2017).


 Upcoming Alien TV Show Will Ignore Prometheus’ Xenomorph Origin Story 
          

Noah Hawley’s comments on his upcoming Alien TV show all but confirms it will not adhere to the events of Prometheus and Covenant. Hawley noted how he prefers to view Alien’s titular monster as the &#34;product of millions of years of evolution” rather than “a bioweapon created half an hour ago,” the latter of which describes how the prequel films treated the Xenomorph. It is unclear when the Alien show will be set, but the series is expected to act as a prequel to the first movie. As such, it could very well intersect with Prometheus timeline-wise.





 

Regardless of its placement in the Alien movie timeline, the upcoming series would naturally have to decide whether the events of Scott’s prequel films would be referenced or even acknowledged. Prometheus and Covenant reshape the franchise’s lore, combining recognizable elements from the best Alien movie with a new, convoluted storyline about the birth of humanity and the meaning of life itself. Interestingly, the Alien prequels themselves once rewrote the Xenomorph history, at least compared to Alien vs. Predator, making the Alien a futuristic species seemingly created by an android rather than an ancient life form.



 Why Rewriting Xenomorph History Makes Sense For Alien’s New Show 
         




Prometheus’ take on the Alien mythology was incredibly divisively, namely because it removed all of the mysteriousness associated with the Xenomorph and replaced it with a larger-than-life story that very little resembled the themes of the original movie. Granted, the Alien vs. Predator films, the comics, and other expended universe stories had all made Alien’s lore quite complicated already, but not on the same scale as Prometheus and its sequel. From the Engineers to David’s experiments, Ridley Scott’s Alien prequels answered questions that didn’t need to be answered and created mysteries that the franchise wasn&#39;t asking for.



The idea of David being the one who created the final version of the Xenomorph will likely never be revisited in live-action.




From a story perspective, having to limit a new show or movie to where Covenant left things off would be incredibly challenging. From a financial standpoint, Alien: Covenant’s box office means the franchise does not need to revisit that story anytime soon. A third movie never happened, and the saga is now ahead of a new beginning with FX’s Alien show and the Alien: Romulus film. Hawley’s Alien project can be a return to form for the franchise, ditching the premise of Prometheus and Covenant in favor of more traditional, self-contained Alien stories.






 Can David’s Xenomorph Story Still Fit Into The Alien Timeline? 
          

Even before the potential retcons the show might make, the Alien franchise hasn’t had a consistent canon in decades. From the Xenomorph Easter egg in Predator 2 to the modern comics and video games, there is just way too much Alien and Predator lore for it to all exist within the same, consistent continuity. Just like the comics can be perceived as their own thing, each corner of the Alien movie franchise can be interpreted as its own “universe.” As such, the Alien show ignoring Prometheus does not invalidate the story Prometheus and Covenant told.

                  “Not A Limited Series”: Alien TV Show’s Multi-Season Plan Teased By Creator   Noah Hawley teases the grand scope of his upcoming Alien TV series, hinting at how the show could explore many years of the Xenomorph horrors.   




That said, from a more practical standpoint, the idea of David being the one who created the final version of the Xenomorph will likely never be revisited on the big screen. An interesting way of fitting Prometheus into the saga’s future would be to establish that the creature David created was not a proper Xenomorph but rather something else. This is the approach the Alien: The Roleplaying Game took, naming David’s creation as “Praetomorph.” Canon questions aside, Alien’s future is exciting both on film and television, even if major retcons or small inconsistencies are to happen.
