 What To Expect From Kaitlyn Dever&#39;s Abby In The Last Of Us Season 2 
          

Bailey&#39;s response to Dever&#39;s casting provides a few clues concerning what to expect from Abby in The Last of Us season 2. She starts by saying she is &#34;so excited to see Abbyâ€™s evolution&#34; in Dever&#39;s performance. In The Last of Us Part II video game, Abby is involved in a crucial and extremely controversial scene involving the two main protagonists, Joel and Ellie, who are played by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey on the HBO show. In turn, audiences should initially despise Abby, but eventually empathize with the character through her flaws and redemptive actions.




                  The Last Of Us&#39; Abby Casting Continues A Naughty Dog Adaptation Trend Uncharted Started   The fact that The Last of Us cast Kaitlyn Dever as its Abby is exciting, but actually also adds to a trend started by Unchartedâ€™s movie adaptation.    

Bailey also offers to be Dever&#39;s &#34;workout buddy,&#34; referring to Abby&#39;s extraordinarily muscular arms. To portray the character through motion capture, Bailey worked out in preparation for the role. Dever, on the other hand, is only 5&#39; 2&#34; and doesn&#39;t exactly have the commanding stature to play Abby, who is about 5&#39; 8&#34;. However, with a similar workout routine as Bailey, Dever could undergo a significant physical transformation for The Last of Us season 2. If not, Dever definitely has the ability as an Emmy-nominated actor to portray Abbyâ€™s evolution effectively.



The Last of Us season 2 is set to begin filming in 2024 and premiere on HBO in 2025.
