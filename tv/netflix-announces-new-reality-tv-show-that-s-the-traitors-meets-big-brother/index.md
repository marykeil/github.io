## Literature Review
Netflix&#39;s newest reality TV competition series takes cues from Big Brother and The Traitors, creating the cut-throat strategy game, The Trust.




Netflix&#39;s newest series, The Trust: A Game Of Greed, brings elements from other reality TV competition series like Big Brother and The Traitors to make a mind-bending competition for its contestants. While Netflix&#39;s series may not have 24-hour live feeds or a haunted castle as a backdrop, The Trust has its own set of twists and turns that will ensure the competition is fresh and fun. Bringing together a cast of brand-new reality TV competitors, The Trust is an interesting twist on the typical reality TV competition. Rather than simply winning a prize at the end, The Trust&#39;s contestants are fighting to secure how much of the prize they&#39;ll receive.




While The Trust is modeled after other reality TV competitions, it&#39;s the first of its kind in many ways. According to Netflix, &#34;the contestants are offered the winnings right from the start...how they choose to distribute the money amongst themselves, is where the game gets interesting.&#34; A brand-new social experiment, The Trust asks its competitors how equitable they&#39;ll be when there&#39;s a massive prize on the line. While contestants can &#34;split a quarter of a million dollars equally amongst themselves&#34;, they&#39;ll also have the opportunity to vote each other out and increase their share of the prize.


 The Trust Will Air In January 2024 
          

Netflix shares that &#34;the contestants will get to know each other’s backgrounds and personality traits through a series of tests designed to expose who’s a team player and who’s out for themselves&#34; throughout their time in the game. With contestants being able to get voted out with just one vote, it&#39;s risky to throw a vote into the mix, but could ultimately increase your share of the prize. While working against each other could &#34;[increase] their individual share of the total prize pot,&#34; it could also &#34;potentially [sow] further distrust amongst the group.&#34; The competitors playing The Trust could choose to play together or separate at any time.





 

With the potential to unlock even more money as the competition rolls on, the competitors on The Trust are faced with an interesting moral dilemma. Should they be fair and equitable to the group, or allow greed to play a factor in their ultimate decisions? The series will roll out much like other Netflix reality TV series, hosting episodes in batches for three weeks on the streaming platform. Hosted by journalist Brooke Baldwin, The Trust will air its first four episodes on January 10.

Although The Trust is a brand-new concept for a reality TV competition series, Netflix has done well bringing back competitions from the past like The Mole and revamping them for a new generation. Producing competitions like The Trust and Squid Game: The Challenge has made Netflix a huge influence in the reality TV landscape. As the competitors on The Trust: A Game Of Greed play through the new competition and decide if their cast mates should stay in the game or leave, it&#39;ll be interesting to see the machinations of the game at work.
