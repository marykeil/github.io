The Bear&rsquo;s
episode &ldquo;Fishes&rdquo; uses a flashback to provide context and further character development, enhancing the show&rsquo;s storytelling.
&ldquo;I Have a Thing About Bathrooms&rdquo; marks a turning point in

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Game of Thrones, Succession, The Bear, and other acclaimed series all feature one amazing episode that turned the story into a truly great show.</p>
<p>A single episode can change everything for a TV show, elevating it from &ldquo;good&rdquo; to &ldquo;great.&rdquo; Perhaps there is no real reason for that one episode to turn the show into a major success, and it just happened to have better writing or feature a significant moment in the story. Maybe the episode was the moment when the audience became truly invested in the story, or a key character was introduced.
It is hard to imagine that there was a time before Eve and Villanelle properly met in Killing Eve; when Walt White was not dealing with members of the Cartel in Breaking Bad; when Blackbear had not yet appeared in Our Flag Means Death. Game-changing characters and plot points made an already good show that much better. On the other hand, Game of Thrones and Succession were both slow in the beginning, with the first few episodes dedicated to introducing the world and characters. Then one important event took place and the show&rsquo;s real story began.</p>
<p>10  Fishes (Season 2, Episode 6)
The Bear (2022-Present)</p>
<p>The Bear<br>
Comedy
Drama</p>
<p>Set in a Chicago sandwich shop, The Bear follows Carmy Berzatto, a young professionally trained chef who returns to take over his family business after the unexpected death of his brother. At odds with many of the shop&rsquo;s employees due to his culinary training, Carmy struggles to maintain order and keep the shop from failing entirely. Jeremy Allen White stars as Carmy alongside Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Ayo Edebiri. </p>
<p>Cast    Jeremy Allen White , Ebon Moss-Bachrach , Ayo Edebiri , Lionel Boyce , Liza Colón-Zayas , Abby Elliott , Oliver Platt     Seasons    2     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , Disney+</p>
<p>One of The Bear’s best episodes comprises a flashback of a Barzatto family Christmas, featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as Carmy and Michael’s mother. While the main characters prepare to open a new restaurant in the present timeline, “Fishes” reveals important information about Carmy. The flashback is used as a vehicle for further context and character development, but it also demonstrates the ingenuity of the writing team. Episodes in other shows that abruptly change format or time stand out as awkward. In this case, it is a welcome exception. &ldquo;Fishes&rdquo; only further elevates The Bear’s storytelling.</p>
<p>9  Gideon Rises (Season 1, Episode 20)
Gravity Falls (2012-2016)</p>
<p>Gravity Falls<br>
Animation
Comedy</p>
<p>When Dipper and Mabel Pines are dropped off to spend the summer with their uncle in Gravity Falls, they discover that all is not as it seems in this small town. When Dipper discovers a strange journal in the forest, the twins team up to solve the town&rsquo;s mysteries.</p>
<p>Cast    Jason Ritter , Kristen Schaal     Seasons    2     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , Disney+</p>
<p>The Gravity Falls Pilot hints at an overarching plot involving Stan and the Mystery Shack before ignoring it for an entire season of filler episodes. After the action-packed season 1 finale with some incredibly satisfying moments – such as Mabel saving the day with her grappling hook – Gravity Falls finally returns to the vending machine mystery. It is revealed that Stan is building a portal underneath the Shack and has been in possession of Journal #1 all along. It is a huge moment in the show that heralds the much darker plot of Gravity Falls season 2.</p>
<p>8  I Have A Thing About Bathrooms (Season 1, Episode 5)
Killing Eve (2018-2022)</p>
<p>Killing Eve<br>
Adventure
Drama
Action</p>
<p>Killing Eve is a black comedy thriller series starring Sandra Oh as British intelligence officer Eve Polastri who is assigned to track and capture a dangerous assassin named Villanelle, played by Jodie Comer. Bored with her life, Eve finds herself hired by an undercover MI6 division tasked with tracking down Villanelle - who, after just a brief time studying and following her, she becomes obsessed with her. However, the obsession becomes mutual as soon the two enter a game of cat and mouse that deviates them from their missions as they venture to learn more about one another.</p>
<p>Cast    Adrian Scarborough , Sandra Oh , Nina Sosanya , Edward Bluemel , Kirby Howell-Baptiste , Danny Sapani , Fiona Shaw , Kim Bodnia , Harriet Walter , Steve Pemberton , Sean Delaney , Henry Lloyd-Hughes , David Haig , jodie comer , turlough convery , Raj Bajaj , Gemma Whelan , Camille Cottin , Darren Boyd Owen McDonnell     Seasons    4     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , Netflix</p>
<p>Most people now know that the romance between an MI6 agent and an assassin is an essential part of Killing Eve. However, for the first few episodes, it is just about Eve trying to find Villanelle. Everything changes when Villanelle shows up at Eve’s house for dinner. She comes because she wants to find out more about the woman who is tracking her, but the entire show shifts. From &ldquo;I Have a Thing About Bathrooms&rdquo; on, Killing Eve is about the palpable tension between the two main characters, which gradually turns into more obvious sexual tension.</p>
<p>15 Most Intense TV Scenes That We Will Never Forget
While the most intense scenes in some recent TV shows are violent and stressful, they contribute to effective overall storytelling.</p>
<p>7  Kkanbu (Season 1, Episode 6)
The Squid Game (2021-Present)</p>
<p>Squid Game<br>
Adventure
Drama
Action</p>
<p>In Squid Game, a mysterious invitation to join a competition is sent to people at risk who are in dire need of money. Four hundred fifty-six participants from all walks of life are locked into a secret location where they play games to win 45.6 billion won. Games are selected from traditional Korean children&rsquo;s games, such as Red Light and Green Light, but the consequence of losing is death. To survive, competitors must choose their alliances carefully - but the further they go in the competition, the more likely betrayal will rear its ugly head.</p>
<p>Cast    Wi Ha-joon , Anupam Tripathi , Oh Yeong-su , Heo Sung-tae , Park Hae-soo , Jung Ho-yeon , Lee Jung-jae , Kim Joo-ryoung     Seasons    1     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix</p>
<p>Squid Game follows a competition comprising a series of children&rsquo;s games – but the competitors are fighting for survival as well as the several billion dollar grand prize. The competition in episode 6 involves some psychological tricks that force the players into an ethical dilemma. They are told to pair up, only to find out they are playing marbles with their partner to determine who will live. This episode changes the nature of Squid Game by demonstrating how dirty the competition can and will become.</p>
<p>6  Enchanting Grom Fright (Season 1, Episode 16)
The Owl House (2020-2023)</p>
<p>The Owl House season 2 is certainly better than season 1 because the first season is mostly filler episodes. While Luz and her friends are funny and enjoyable to watch, the cute magical adventures fall within “good” rather than “great.” However, &ldquo;Enchanting Grom Fright&rdquo; demands audience investment. Luz comes to Amity’s defense by fighting the Grom monster, the two have an epic dance battle scene together, and Amity’s hinted crush on Luz is confirmed. It is one of the first episodes where the audience is prompted to invest themselves in something bigger than the adventure of the week.</p>
<p>5  Crazy Handful Of Nothin&rsquo; (Season 1, Episode 6)
Breaking Bad (2008-2013)</p>
<p>Breaking Bad<br>
Crime
Drama
Thriller</p>
<p>Breaking Bad, created by Vince Gilligan, follows a chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin named Walter White (Bryan Cranston) as he attempts to provide for his family following a fatal diagnosis. With nothing left to fear, White ascends to power in the world of drugs and crime, transforming the simple family man into someone known only as Heisenberg.</p>
<p>Cast    Dean Norris , Bob Odenkirk , Aaron Paul , RJ Mitte , Anna Gunn , Giancarlo Esposito , Betsy Brandt , Bryan Cranston , Jonathan Banks     Seasons    5     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix</p>
<p>The stakes are raised just before Breaking Bad season 1 finale. In &ldquo;Crazy Handful of Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Walt begins chemotherapy and is under more pressure than ever to turn a profit and secure his family’s future. Jesse also realizes what is at stake for Walt when he figures out that Walt has lung cancer. Walt becomes frustrated with the relatively low profits from his crystal meth business, and Jesse’s friend puts them in contact with the drug lord Tuco Salamanca. This episode is significant because it marks the beginning of Walt and Jesse’s dealings with The Cartel.</p>
<p>4  A Gentleman Pirate (Season 1, Episode 3)
Our Flag Means Death (2022-2023)</p>
<p>Our Flag Means Death<br>
Adventure
Comedy
Romance
Biography</p>
<p>Created by David Jenkins and starring Rhys Darby and Taika Waititi, Our Flag Means Death blends romantic comedy with period drama on the high seas. Loosely based on real historical figures, the series chronicles the adventures of Stede Bonnet and the crew of the pirate ship Revenge, detailing their often hilarious exploits and encounters, including crossing paths with the infamous Blackbeard. The series received praise for its extensive and positive LGBTQ+ representation upon the first season&rsquo;s release. </p>
<p>Cast    Rhys Darby , Con O&rsquo;Neill , Rory Kinnear , Matthew Maher , Samson Kayo , Ewen Bremner , David Fane , Nathan Foad , Taika Waititi , Guz Khan , Vico Ortiz , Joel Fry , Kristian Nairn     Seasons    2     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max</p>
<p>The first two episodes of Our Flag Means Death include some awkward adventuring with the original crew of the Revenge. Things pick up comedy and plot-wise in episode 3. While Stede hysterically tries to sell his hostage and generally makes a fool of himself, parts of Jim’s past are revealed, and Blackbeard makes his way toward Stede.
Stede is almost executed by Spanish Jackie’s crew and gets a hilarious “farewell” from his crew members – Jim bluntly says, “You are the worst f*****g pirate captain in history.” Blackbeard, who wants to see the “Gentleman Pirate” for himself, arrives to save them all. This episode is a turning point because it shows what the writers can really do in terms of comedy and introduces the other vital main character.</p>
<p>3  Baelor (Season 1, Episode 9)
Game Of Thrones (2011-2019)</p>
<p>Game Of Thrones<br>
Drama
Action
Adventure</p>
<p>Created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Game of Thrones is a TV series based on the book “A Song of Ice of Fire” by George R. R. Martin. It tells the story of the ongoing battle between the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros - as they fight for control of the coveted Iron Throne. Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the far north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night&rsquo;s Watch, led by House Stark&rsquo;s Jon Snow, is the first to encounter icy horrors that threaten all realms of men. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and quickly became one of the biggest event series in the &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; of TV. Winner of 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international fan base.</p>
<p>Cast    Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage     Seasons    8     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max</p>
<p>Game of Thrones season 1 moves slowly because it is dominated by political discussions while nothing drastic actually happens. But everything changes in the tragic season 1 finale when Joffrey orders Ned Stark’s execution. After Ned&rsquo;s death, Game of Thrones becomes much more intense and intriguing. The time of talking is over (although there is still a lot of negotiating throughout the show) and the War of the Five Kings begins. Additionally, “Baelor” is followed by Daenerys’ dragons hatching in “Fire and Blood,” which is another game-changing moment.</p>
<p>2  Everybody Wants To Be My Enemy (Season 1, Episode 5)
Arcane (2021-Present)</p>
<p>Arcane<br>
Action
Adventure
Sci-Fi
Animation</p>
<p>Set in the League of Legends universe, Arcane focuses on sisters Violet and Powder (later Jinx) as they end up on opposite sides of a growing conflict between the wealthy utopia of Piltover and its dark undercity whose citizens wish to break away from their oppressors. Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, and Kevin Alejandro star in this animated adventure. </p>
<p>Cast    Hailee Steinfeld , Ella Purnell , Kevin Alejandro , Katie Leung , jason spisak , Toks Olagundoye , Harry Lloyd , JB Blanc , Reed Shannon , Mick Wingert     Seasons    1     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix</p>
<p>Arcane episode 5 introduces many central personal and political conflicts. Vi approaches Sevika to find out what happened to her sister, while Silco tries to help Jinx move on from her past. This demonstrates how Silco does care about Jinx despite their dysfunctional relationship, while Vi is prepared to do anything to get her sister back.
Elsewhere, Jayce has formed a partnership with Mel, foreshadowing some of his bigger political moves. And Viktor has been hospitalized after collapsing, which will lead to him experimenting with Hextech and Shimmer to save his own life. A lot happens in this episode, and it is essentially all summarized in one amazing montage featuring the song from the opening credits, Imagine Dragons and JID’s “Enemy.”</p>
<p>10 TV Shows To Watch While Waiting For Arcane Season 2 To Release
There will be a lengthy wait for Netflix&rsquo;s Arcane season 2, but luckily, fans can quench their thirst for the series by watching 10 similar shows.</p>
<p>1  Which Side Are You On? (Season 1, Episode 6)
Succession (2018-2023)</p>
<p>Succession<br>
Drama
Comedy</p>
<p>Succession is a Black Comedy and Satire television show created by Jesse Armstrong. It stars Hiam Abbass, Nicholas Braun, Brian Cox, and Kieran Culkin and follows the story of an aging conglomerate owner as he deals with his declining health and the sudden realization that one of his children will soon inherit his position and run his company.</p>
<p>Cast    Hiam Abbass , Alan Ruck , Sarah Snook , Kieran Culkin , Natalie Gold , Nicholas Braun , J. Smith-Cameron , Matthew Macfadyen , Peter Friedman , Brian Cox , Arian Moayed , Jeremy Strong , Rob Yang , Dagmara Dominczyk     Seasons    3     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max</p>
<p>Succession’s first few episodes are difficult because most of the characters are inherently unlikable. But by episode 6, the palpable tension and corporate politics takes over. The theme music plays while everyone heads to the board meeting where Kendall will call for a vote of no confidence against Logan. The moment effectively conveys the show’s themes of legacy and betrayal. Logan is furious and when the vote fails, he fires every member of the board who voted against him. This episode has the spectacle, drama, and release of built-up tension to bring the series to a new level.</p>
