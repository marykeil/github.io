## Literature Review

All of Us Are Dead season 2 will premiere more than two years after season 1, but such a long wait is actually good for the zombie K-drama’s story.




All of Us Are Dead season 2’s release date has yet to be revealed by Netflix, but this long wait for the zombie K-drama to return is actually good news for the story. Ranking high among Netflix&#39;s best Korean shows, All of Us Are Dead was a hit upon its release and is still among the platform’s most-watched K-dramas going into 2024. Interestingly, most of what happens in the Now In Our School webtoon has already been covered in season 1, meaning All of Us Are Dead is now set to be an original story.




Large gaps between seasons are nothing new when it comes to K-dramas released as web series. For example, Sweet Home season 2 was released three years after the show’s debut, while Squid Game premiered in September 2021 and still hasn’t released a new season. All of Us Are Dead debuted on Netflix on January 28, 2022, meaning more than two years will have passed by the time season 2 eventually premiers.


 All Of Us Are Dead Season 2’s Release Window Means It Can Easily Include A Time-Skip 
          

All of Us Are Dead needs a time-skip following the events of season 1, namely because every possible conflict has already been dealt with. Although season 1’s ending did include a time skip, it was not a very long one. Now that Hyosan High has been destroyed and most of the city has been bombed, All of Us Are Dead will have to start a new story from scratch – both literally and figuratively. The zombie outbreak is so far limited to just one area, the main All of Us Are Dead characters are in safety, and Cheong-san just died.





 

Considering just how much happened in the season 1 finale, All of Us Are Dead needed time to breathe. Otherwise, everything that happened at the end of season 1 would feel less impactful. For example, assuming Cheong-san did not actually die, having him return just a few months later would lessen the importance of his sacrifice. All of Us Are Dead was a relatively self-contained story, and if season 2 is essentially a new beginning for the show, it helps that it will be released more than two years after the first season.



 How All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Will Be Different From Season 1 
          




By removing the school setting, All of Us Are Dead becomes a different show. This may be one of the reasons why the Netflix K-drama decided not to use the webtoon’s original title, as “Now In Our School” would not let the show expand beyond its original premise. What made All of Us Are Dead season 1 stand out from other zombie shows is how it took place mostly inside one location, creating an anxiety-filling experience in which viewers quickly grew attached to the characters. This is something season 2 may not be able to replicate.

  1:40                       All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Will Have To Use Sweet Home’s Most Divisive Story Trick   All of Us Are Dead season 2’s story will likely run into a problem Sweet Home’s second season encountered, but the zombie K-drama could make it work.   

However, All of Us Are Dead season 2&#39;s story can be great on its own even if it turns out to be very different from the first season. The show could now follow the lives of On-jo and her friends inside the quarantine zone, or it could see them exploring what is left of the city out in the open. Nam-ra’s journey with the halfbies may also play an important role in season 2 and avoid comparisons with All of Us Are Dead season 1, not to mention how characters like Cheong-san and Gwi-nam could still be alive
