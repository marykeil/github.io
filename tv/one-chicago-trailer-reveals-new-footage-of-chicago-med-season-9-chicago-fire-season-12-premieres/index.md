## Literature Review
A week ahead of its return, NBC releases a brand new trailer for the upcoming season of One Chicago, debuting new scenes for Fire, PD, and Med.  




The new One Chicago trailer reveals new footage of Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, and Chicago PD as they return for their respective seasons. Wolf Entertainment and NBC&#39;s Windy City storytelling pocket has been delayed significantly, like most scripted series, due to the dual Hollywood strikes in 2023. However, One Chicago is returning sooner than many of its peers. With only just over a week until the premiere of its new season, marketing for the shows is currently ramping up.




One Chicago returns with new episodes on January 17, and in preparation for that, an extended look at Chicago Fire season 12, Chicago Med season 9, and Chicago PD season 11 has been released by NBC (via One Chicago). Watch it below:


 

There are some big takeaways from the clip, including an intense conversation between Kidd and Severide and a potential casualty for Firehouse 51. Meanwhile, Dr. Charles is reunited with his former patient, although under different circumstances, and finally, there is a look at the fallout from the Chicago PD season 10 finale.


 What To Expect From The New One Chicago Season 
          




One Chicago hasn&#39;t returned yet, but it&#39;s already facing some challenges throughout its upcoming shortened run. For starters, there will be several major cast departures for the franchise. On the heels of Brian Tee and Nick Gelfhuss&#39; exits, Chicago Med is expected to maintain its core ensemble, but that isn&#39;t the case for both Chief Boden&#39;s Firehouse 51 and Hank Voight&#39;s Intelligence. Both teams will be dealing with massive losses of personnel in their upcoming episodes.

Chicago Fire will see the departure of Gallo in the season 12 premiere. Although it&#39;s unclear how he will be written out, the aforementioned trailer featuring a severely injured victim during a Firehouse 51 call could be a tease of what his ultimate fate will be. On a happier note, Brett could be leaving Windy City to move in with her potential fiancÃ©, Casey, following his surprise proposal in the Chicago Fire season 11 finale. Her answer hasn&#39;t been confirmed, but it is heavily speculated that she says yes. Meanwhile, Chicago PD season 10 will bid Upton farewell, not long after her on-screen husband, Halstead, also left the force.




Overall, expect some big changes for One Chicago. Aside from cast reshuffling, lingering plotlines will also be tackled. That includes Ruzek&#39;s fate on the heels of his near-death experience, not to mention Severide and Kidd&#39;s reunion following their rocky first year of marriage. Gaffney Chicago Medical Center, on the other hand, will attempt to move on from losing two of their very best.
