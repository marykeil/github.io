 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 14? 
          

Undead Unluck episode 14, &#34;Crimson Bullet&#34;, continued the fight between Andy and Rip to save Fuuko. The fight became complicated when Rip unveiled the Artifact Blade Runner, a pair of metal legs that gave him the power of flight and the ability to shoot bladed projectiles, but by combining their abilities, Fuuko, Chikara, and Tatiana were able to freeze Rip and Latla with Unmove in a way that allowed Andy to sneak up behind Rip. Thanks to that, Andy could kill Rip with Crimson Bullet, a more powerful version of his regular Parts Bullet, and Fuuko was freed from the effect of Unrepair.




                  Undead Unluck: Every Union Member &amp; Their Abilities Explained   The Union is the main heroic group of Negators in Undead Unluck, and here&#39;s a breakdown of every character and their various abilities in the series.    

Latla retreated with the Negator Hunters while saying that she wouldn&#39;t let Rip die, but Fuuko and the others couldn&#39;t get an explanation for what she meant. Afterward, Fuuko and Andy asked Chikara to join the Union and gave him a week to decide, with Chikara using the time to go back to school and spend time with his friends. Fuuko and Andy arrived at Chikara&#39;s school on the deadline, unsure whether Chikara would decide to join them. Much to their surprise, Fuuko and Andy encountered Rip miraculously brought back to life, albeit now possessing the body of a child.



 Undead Unluck Is Finally Revealing Its New Villains&#39; True Identity 
          




Based on the ending of Unded Unluck episode 14 and the preview for episode 15, it would appear that the anime is about to reveal the true identity of the new villains, the Negator Hunters. There&#39;s still a lot of mystery behind the group and their motives, and with Undead Unluck set to end soon, those answers need to be given sooner, rather than later. Whatever&#39;s revealed about the Negator Hunters will undoubtedly set the tone for what&#39;s likely the anime&#39;s final arc, so it&#39;s bound to be a big reveal when it finally comes out in Undead Unluck episode 15.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode 15 when it releases on January 19.
