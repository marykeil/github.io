# Peter Capaldi s Doctor Who Character Record Looks Impossible For Any Future Doctor To Beat

## Literature Review
Peter Capaldi is most well-known in Doctor Who for playing the Twelfth Doctor, but his history with the show means he has other characters too.




Peter Capaldi played the Twelfth Doctor for three full seasons of Doctor Who, and his work on the show earned him a unique accolade. His achievement was only partly due to his portrayal of the show&#39;s main character, and every actor who has played the Doctor is unlikely to match him in one specific area. The same is also true of future actors who will take to the rule. Capaldi&#39;s version of the famous Time Lord has an interesting story behind his physical appearance, and it ties him into the fabric of the Doctor Who universe even more.




After a couple of guest appearances as the Twelfth Doctor, Capaldi took up residency in the TARDIS after Matt Smith&#39;s 2013 departure. As well as taking part in more complex narratives, Twelve starred in some of the best standalone Doctor Who episodes. Capaldi had a history of working with the BBC before being cast as the Doctor. Before his stint on Doctor Who, one of his most prominent roles was as Malcolm Tucker in the BBC&#39;s satirical political sitcom, The Thick of It. However, Capaldi&#39;s relationship with Doctor Who was even more involved than that, and he was very familiar with starring in the long-running British sci-fi show.

 Peter Capaldi Portrayed 3 Distinct Characters In The Doctor Who Universe 
Capaldi&#39;s first Doctor Who appearance was in 2008
          




The Twelfth Doctor wasn&#39;t Peter Capaldi&#39;s first Doctor Who character. Although he debuted as the show&#39;s title character in 2013, his first appearance on the show was in 2008. Doctor Who season 4, episode 2, &#34;The Fires of Pompeii&#34; had Capaldi among its cast. The Scottish actor played Lobus Caecilius, a marble trader whose life was saved by David Tennant&#39;s Tenth Doctor during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Caecilius also had designs on becoming a politician, in a similar vein to Capaldi&#39;s character in The Thick of It.

Capaldi also played a second character in the Doctor Who universe before his spell as the Time Lord. However, the character in question didn&#39;t appear in the main show, but rather in Torchwood, a Doctor Who spinoff. Torchwood season 3 starred Capaldi in a prominent role, this time as John Frobisher, another character with a political background. Capaldi&#39;s appearances in Torchwood took place in 2009, a year after &#34;The Fires of Pompeii&#34; first aired.




The Twelfth Doctor marks Peter Capaldi&#39;s third distinct character in the world of Doctor Who. The debut of all three characters occurred within a relatively short space of time. With Caecilius appearing in 2008, Frobisher in 2009, and Twelve in 2013, the trio of Capaldi personas all materialized within five years. Regardless, the Twelfth Doctor is Peter Capaldi&#39;s biggest and most-recognized Doctor Who character.



 How Peter Capaldi&#39;s Doctor Who Characters Are All Connected 
Genetics aren&#39;t the only reason
         

The fact that Peter Capaldi&#39;s face has appeared so often in Doctor Who may seem like it could cause issues with canon, but the many castings of the same actor have an in-universe explanation. Caecilius is the character that holds everything together. Speaking at a Doctor Who festival, former showrunner Steven Moffat offered the fairly simple explanation that John Frobisher is a descent of Caecilius. The transcript of Moffat&#39;s explanation from Conversations About Her states, &#34;Remarkably, there&#39;s a level of genetic throwback in that thousand years to make them identical!&#34;




                  11 Canon Appearances The Doctor Has Made Outside Of Doctor Who   The Doctor is the main character in Doctor Who, but the Time Lord has appeared in other shows on more than one occasion and for various reasons.    

The reason for the Twelfth Doctor&#39;s striking resemblance to Caecilius is addressed in a way that&#39;s much more in keeping with the style of Doctor Who. The issue is brought to the foreground immediately, with Twelve recognizing his new face in Capaldi&#39;s first full episode - Doctor Who season 8, episode 1, &#34;Deep Breath.&#34; Seeing as the Tenth Doctor interacted with Caecilius in Pompeii, the face was familiar to Twelve almost immediately.

Gazing into a mirror in &#34;Deep Breath&#34;, the Twelfth Doctor states, &#34;Why&#39;d I choose this face? It&#39;s like I&#39;m trying to tell myself something.&#34; Eventually, the Twelfth Doctor works out that he subconsciously chose his new face to remind him of the time he saved Caecilius from Pompeii. The Choice is made so he always remembers that rescuing people is what he does and what he intends to carry on doing.






 Other Doctor Actors Played Multiple Doctor Who Characters 
Some Doctor Who assistants have also been cast more than once
          

Peter Capaldi isn&#39;t the only actor who&#39;s played the Doctor to play another Doctor Who character. For instance, Colin Baker played the Sixth Doctor as well as another Time Lord called Maxil. The character of Maxil appeared in the show before the Sixth Doctor, with the former contributing to Baker&#39;s casting as the latter. While there has never been an explicit reason for both characters looking identical, the Twelfth Doctor unconsciously choosing Caecilius&#39; face as his own shows that the Doctor does have an element of control during the regeneration process.

Doctor actors from the revival era have also played more than one role. For example, Matt Smith played the Eleventh Doctor as well as the Eleventh Doctor&#39;s Gagner in Doctor Who season 6, episode 5, &#34;The Rebel Flesh.&#34; In addition, David Tennant has played the Tenth, Fourteenth, and Meta-Crisis Doctor. Freema Agyeman is another example of a Doctor Who double-casting. Although better known as Martha Jones in the show, Agyeman appeared as Torchwood employee Adeola Oshodi before serving as the Tenth Doctor&#39;s companion. The physical similarities in this instance were also explained away as Adeola being Martha&#39;s cousin.




                  Doctor Who: 10 Saddest Things About The 12th Doctor   Doctor Who&#39;s 12th Doctor had his fair share of painful choices to make and tragedies to overcome. Here are his saddest moments in the series.    

However, of all the actors to play the Doctor, Peter Capaldi holds the record for the highest number of distinct characters portrayed on-screen in Doctor Who. The multiple castings of Capaldi did require a good amount of in-universe explanation, a feat that could get quite clumsy if something similar were to happen again. As such, it seems unlikely that another Doctor actor will equal Peter Capaldi&#39;s Doctor Who achievement.



Doctor Who&#39;s classic era is streaming on Tubi, and the revival episodes are on Max. All episodes after the 50th-anniversary specials and the 2023 Christmas special, &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; will be on Disney&#43;, with those episodes included.
