## Literature Review
Netflix unveils a brand-new image of the core trio Aang, Katara, and Sokka preparing for battle in the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender show.




A new image has been revealed from Avatar: The Last Airbender. The upcoming Netflix show is a live-action rendering of the classic Nickelodeon animated show of the same name. Set in a world where gifted people can manipulate or &#34;bend&#34; one of the four elements, it follows a young Airbender named Aang (Gordon Cormier) who is the Avatar, a reincarnated being with the power to unite the elements. He embarks on a perilous adventure with siblings Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley) to master the elements and stop the Fire Nation from conquering the world.




On Twitter, Netflix France shared a new first-look image from the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender. Check it out below:

          

The image depicts a forest-set scene of the core trio preparing for battle. While Katara and Aang prepare to bend their respective elements water and air, Sokka raises his signature boomerang.

Although Sokka&#39;s face is turned away from the camera, this new image is one of the closest looks yet at the core trio since the Avatar: The Last Airbender trailer was released in November. Although there are a variety of important characters that will either join or oppose them on their quest, including the disgraced Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu) and his sister Princess Azula (Elizabeth Yu), Aang, Katara, and Sokka are perhaps the most important overall. Their adventures will challenge and eventually strengthen their bond, so the actors bringing them to life are key to the show.






The Avatar: The Last Airbender cast also includes Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as General Iroh, Daniel Dae Kim as Fire Lord Ozai, and Maria Zhang as Suki.




Although all three stars are still young, each of them has held roles in prominent projects before appearing as part of the Avatar: The Last Airbender cast. This includes Kiawentiio who, in spite of only having six credits, has managed to appear in prominent television titles Anne with an E, Rutherford Falls, and Marvel&#39;s What If...?. Ousley has managed a similar feat with just five credits, appearing in Young Sheldon, 13 Reasons Why, and Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Physical.

Gordon Cormier, the titular star of Avatar: The Last Airbender, also has quite a bit of experience under his belt. After kicking off his career in holiday TV movies including A Christmas Miracle and Christmas Under the Stars, he went on to star in projects including the 2020 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s The Stand and the animated show Team Zenko Go. Thus, Cormier and both his co-stars are television veterans who could utilize their considerable experience to bring these three important characters to life.
