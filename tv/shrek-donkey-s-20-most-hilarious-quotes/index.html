  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Shrek may be the title character, but Dreamworks&rsquo; Donkey played by Eddie Murphy has some of the best, most hilarious quotes in the movies.</p>
<p>The best Shrek Donkey quotes show why the big green ogre&rsquo;s noble steed is one of the funniest characters in the franchise. 2001&rsquo;s Shrek features a star-studded cast led by Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and as Donkey, legendary comedian Eddie Murphy. Shrek takes familiar fairytales and turns them on their heads, adding in slapstick humor and larger-than-life characters not found in any other story — fairytale or otherwise. This includes Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s head-turning performance as the annoying, gullible, and loving Donkey.
The films follow Mike Myers&rsquo; Shrek, a misanthropic ogre who finds himself thrust into the role of a hero. While Shrek is the lead character of the franchise, there&rsquo;s no way to deny Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s Donkey, Shrek&rsquo;s devoted and hilarious sidekick, is also a star of the films. With sharp wit, pop culture commentary, and endless enthusiasm, Donkey remains Shrek&rsquo;s secret weapon. From the start, where he just wants a friend, to the end, where he proves to be a loyal warrior, the Shrek Donkey quotes show him as funny and quick-witted as anyone in the franchise.</p>
<p>Shrek 5: If It&rsquo;s Still Happening, Cast &amp; Everything We Know
It&rsquo;s been a while since fans have seen a new Shrek movie and they&rsquo;re getting impatient for Shrek 5. When&rsquo;s the release date? Here&rsquo;s what we know.</p>
<p>20  &ldquo;Okay, Let Me Get This Straight&hellip;&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Although they&rsquo;re rare, there are times when Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s Shrek character makes something resembling sense, such as when Shrek is ready to roar into battle and Donkey attempts to understand Shrek&rsquo;s reasoning and change Shrek&rsquo;s mind by explaining things as he sees them.. It&rsquo;s not a bad argument, all things considered.
&ldquo;You gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad&rsquo;ll give you back your swamp, which you only don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;cause he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?&rdquo;
The irony isn&rsquo;t lost on Shrek either, who becomes a bit annoyed by his companion&rsquo;s take on the situation, and utters the reply, &ldquo;You know what? Maybe there&rsquo;s a good reason donkeys shouldn&rsquo;t talk.” What makes these Donkey quotes funny is Shrek&rsquo;s reaction to them and Donkey&rsquo;s mostly deadpan delivery, which showcases why their relationship has carried four movies and counting.</p>
<p>19  &ldquo;Me! Me! Oh, Oh Pick Me! Oh, I Know! I Know! Me!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Shrek found Donkey so irritating that he did his best to ignore him at a gathering to find out where Lord Farquaad was. After asking the crowd where he could find Farquaad, Donkey launched into a &ldquo;pick me&rdquo; tirade, only to be ignored by the ogre for as long as possible. Not one to be counted out, Donkey kept up the begging, leaping into the air while yelling this quote as Shrek did everything he could to pretend he was never there in the first place.
These were perfect Donkey quotes in Shrek that showed how much Donkey wanted to be part of something, and even though Shrek wasn&rsquo;t interested, Donkey never once took no for an answer. Shockingly enough for both characters, this sequence would mark the beginning of a lasting friendship.</p>
<p>18  &ldquo;In The Morning, I&rsquo;m Making Waffles!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>As soon as Donkey unexpectedly shows up in Shrek&rsquo;s life, he proves himself to be a bouncing, endless ball of positivity and enthusiasm, which stands in direct conflict with Shrek&rsquo;s general air of grumpiness. That, of course, is what makes the two of them such a perfect comedic duo. After Donkey makes it clear that he intends to live in Shrek&rsquo;s swamp, he details his great plans for their future.
While Shrek isn&rsquo;t interested in being friends with the talkative little donkey from the get-go, Donkey confirms the two of them are going to be best friends forever from that moment on. Their first night together, according to Donkey, will consist of &ldquo;stay[ing] up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I&rsquo;m making waffles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>17  &ldquo;We Wear Our Fear Right There On Our Sleeves.&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Early on in the first Shrek film, Donkey fixates on the notion of ogres having layers, like onions and parfaits, as well as countless other things. It&rsquo;s a metaphor that Shrek and Donkey both refer to throughout the film after that first back-and-forth discussion, but Donkey&rsquo;s cheekiest reference to it comes at the most unexpected moment.
Donkey and Shrek will go on plenty of dangerous and heroic adventures during the franchise, but Shrek finds the two of them braving one of the most unenviable threats of all. In their attempts to rescue Princess Fiona from the tower, they&rsquo;re forced to cross a dangerous bridge surrounded by a dragon&rsquo;s lair and brimstone. And that&rsquo;s where Donkey makes the revelation that &ldquo;donkeys don&rsquo;t have layers. We wear our fear right there on our sleeves&rdquo; — since, as it turns out, he&rsquo;s afraid of heights.</p>
<p>Shrek 5 Voice Cast Guide: What The Actors Look Like In Real Life
There are plenty of familiar faces and talented comedians from the popular animated franchise who are ready to reprise their iconic roles for Shrek 5.</p>
<p>16  &ldquo;I Go Down Smooth But I Come Out Fighting!&rdquo;
Shrek: Forever After (2010)</p>
<p>When Donkey is very nearly cooked and eaten by the ogre resistance in Shrek: Forever After, he has some choice words for the cook, revealing that he may go down&rsquo;s smoothly, but he&rsquo;ll come out fighting. These Donkey quotes in Shrek are both a look at his resilience in battle and a funny joke about what might happen if anyone did happen to eat him — it wouldn&rsquo;t be a pleasant experience after the fact.
This quote is quite indicative of Donkey&rsquo;s character, who was more concerned with how he&rsquo;d be digested than being eaten at all. Murphy&rsquo;s hilarious delivery also goes to show just how perfect his casting was as this lovable cartoon donkey.</p>
<p>15  &ldquo;I Like That Boulder. That Is A Nice Boulder.&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Donkey is a Shrek character of very simple tastes and one who is very easy to please. When he finds himself in Shrek&rsquo;s swamp, he&rsquo;s just about the most positive individual Shrek has ever met, including some amazing color commentary from Donkey, who takes to flattering the ogre in just about every way he can.
While wandering around the swamp grounds, Donkey begins providing hilarious observations on the home decor elements of Shrek&rsquo;s home: &ldquo;It is lovely! Just beautiful. You know, you are quite a decorator. It&rsquo;s amazing what you&rsquo;ve done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s the boulder comment that seals the deal, elevating his little monologue to a whole new level of hilarity.</p>
<p>14  &ldquo;And I Thought The Waffle Fairy Was Just A Bedtime Story!&rdquo;
Shrek: Forever After (2010)</p>
<p>Donkey is known for his fascination with waffles, which is a running bit that stretches from the very first film to Shrek: Forever After. During that latter film, Donkey is surprised to find a stack of waffles sitting in a forest clearing, remarking that the Waffle Fairy is real after all. These Shrek Donkey quotes show how gullible the character is, while also emphasizing his love of waffles.
As lovably dense as Donkey is, it is difficult for fans not to find the notion of a Waffle Fairy utterly hilarious. Of course, given the franchise&rsquo;s fairy tale setting, it isn&rsquo;t impossible to rule out the existence of such a creature, making Donkey&rsquo;s greatest wishes come true after all.</p>
<p>13  &ldquo;[I&rsquo;m] A Fancy Feasting Second-Rate Sidekick!&rdquo;
Shrek The Third (2007)</p>
<p>Donkey and the fairy tale character Puss in Boots have one of the best friendly rivalries in the Shrek franchise, which continues in Shrek the Third. In the film, the two accidentally switch bodies after Merlin casts a spell to teleport them back to Far, Far Away. Upon realizing his new physical state, Donkey takes the opportunity to take a jab at his friend.</p>
<p>​​​​​​​
Donkey&rsquo;s disgust and horror at having been turned into a cat are only elevated by his sheer distaste for Puss in general. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been abra-cadabra&rsquo;d into a Fancy Feasting second-rate sidekick!&rdquo; This would also mark the beginning of a fantastic running bit between the two characters as they continue to express their hatred for one another while inhabiting the opposite body throughout the movie. However, it was these Donkey quotes in Shrek that got the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Shrek&rsquo;s 30 Funniest Quotes
Shrek is the kind of ogre who is less scary and more silly. Throughout all of his films, he has delivered some really hilarious lines.</p>
<p>12  &ldquo;Are My Kids Cute Or Do They Make People Uncomfortable?&rdquo;
Shrek: Forever After (2010)</p>
<p>One of the most bizarre elements of the Shrek franchise is the romance between Donkey and Dragon, who have a litter of half-donkey half-dragon hybrids, called &ldquo;Dronkeys,&rdquo; at the end of the second film. However, when Shrek tells an alternate-reality Donkey about his children, the character responds with an appropriate question about their appearance. &ldquo;Are my kids cute or do they make people uncomfortable?&rdquo; he asks, which seems very self-aware for the alternate version of the character.
In truth, Donkey and Dragon&rsquo;s children are horrifying creatures that have haunted the Shrek fan base for decades. Donkey was right to question the merit of these creatures, whose exploits are certain to take center stage if a fifth Shrek film ever hits theaters.</p>
<p>11  &ldquo;&hellip;I Bet You Ain&rsquo;t Never Seen A Donkey Fly!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>While Donkey may reveal his fear of heights later in the film, when he&rsquo;s first introduced in Shrek, Donkey is shown flying through the air. When fairytale creatures are up for auction, Donkey&rsquo;s previous owner tries to sell him off as a talking donkey, but a sudden burst of pixie dust makes Donkey able to fly, too. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m a flyin&rsquo;, talkin&rsquo; donkey! You mighta seen a housefly. Maybe even a superfly. But I bet you ain&rsquo;t never seen a donkey fly!&rdquo;
All of the attendees at the auction are dumbfounded, including the guards and knights involved in the royal auction. But Donkey has never been happier, laughing hysterically as he floats through the air and gloats about being the first ever donkey to fly. Unfortunately, the joy is short-lived, as the pixie dust wears off in mere seconds. But it makes for a truly hilarious moment, and a great few lines, too.</p>
<p>10  &ldquo;Look Out! They Got A Piano!&rdquo;
Shrek The Third (2007)</p>
<p>The character of Donkey is undoubtedly one of Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s most iconic performances, in part because it allows him to utter lines that would make sense in very few other films. One such line comes during a fight sequence in Shrek the Third, as the villains reveal that they have brought a piano to the battle. As Donkey warned everyone that the villain had a piano, it made almost no sense, making these Donkey quotes in Shrek even funnier.
Donkey&rsquo;s sheer fear at the arrival of a piano is bizarre and incredibly random but works perfectly in the context of the Shrek franchise. However, he turns out to be correct in his prioritization of the piano, as the villains all retreat once the instrument is destroyed. Sometimes Donkey quotes in Shrek make sense, even when they had no business doing so.</p>
<p>9  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve Got A Dragon Here, And I&rsquo;m Not Afraid To Use It!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Once Donkey had successfully wooed the fearsome dragon that previously acted as Princess Fiona&rsquo;s prison guard, he used it to crash her wedding to Lord Farquaad and put a stop to it by swallowing the villain whole. A stunned crowd looked on as Donkey uttered this quote, proving he had the goods to back up his threat. It was also very funny because Donkey was using his new loved one as the most dangerous weapon in the fight, and he knew it.
This moment would also set up a darkly comical plot device involving the slow death of Farquaad in the digestive tract of the dragon, which ended up taking a few films to accomplish, as revealed on the television special Shrek 4-D. If anything, that added a level of humor that no one expected to these fearsome Donkey quotes in Shrek.</p>
<p>Shrek: The 10 Greatest Characters (&amp; Their Best Quote)
The Shrek franchise put a fun spin on traditional fairytale tropes, and here are 10 of the series&rsquo; greatest characters, along with their best quotes.</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;If You See A Long Tunnel, Stay Away From The Light!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Donkey can be a real worrier, and for good reason, given the sheer amount of insane obstacles and violence that he and his friends come into contact with throughout the Shrek franchise. But one of the first times he&rsquo;s given a real reason to worry is when his new best friend, Shrek, is punctured by an arrow, and Donkey is made to think the injury could be something serious.</p>
<p>While frantically starting to run away and find help elsewhere, an incredibly panicked Donkey exclaims, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die, Shrek! And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!&rdquo; His comment just elicits further irritation from both Shrek and Fiona but leads to a real moment of darkly snarky humor for the film that&rsquo;s never afraid of embracing sarcastic humor in all forms.</p>
<p>7  &ldquo;How In The Name Of Hans Christian Andersen&hellip;&rdquo;
Shrek The Third (2007)</p>
<p>Body swapping and unexpected transformations are the bread and butter of fairytales, and the Shrek franchise is certainly no different. But far and away, the most unexpected and most hilarious example of this familiar trope occurs in Shrek the Third when Donkey and Puss in Boots find themselves suddenly swapping bodies as a result of Artie and Merlin&rsquo;s magic.
Since Donkey and Puss in Boots are still the series&rsquo; resident love-hate friendship at this point, the realization that they are now inhabiting each other&rsquo;s bodies leads to some wonderfully snarky barbs. But none of them are more wonderfully meta and hilarious than Donkey&rsquo;s quip that he couldn&rsquo;t possibly ever walk in Puss&rsquo;s ridiculous boots — a remark he makes &ldquo;in the name of Hans Christian Andersen,&rdquo; the master of fairytales himself. Donkey&rsquo;s knowledge of fairy tales is always fun.</p>
<p>6  &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Feel My Toes. I Don&rsquo;t Have Any Toes!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Donkey can be quite an over-the-top character when he wants to be, and for that reason, a little bit of him can go a long, long, long way. Shrek and Fiona often get quite tired of him, and as a result, they have a bit more mean-spirited fun with him than they should. In an attempt to get Donkey to leave them alone, so they can go off in search of wood and food for dinner, Fiona and Shrek begin to make Donkey think something is wrong with him.
Of course, at the slightest suggestion of this fact, Donkey begins to spiral. After Shrek and Fiona both abandon him mid-spiraling, Donkey becomes totally dejected, culminating in his realization that, not only does he not feel his toes, he never had any toes to begin with. His sad little &ldquo;I think I need a hug&rdquo; makes for one of the film&rsquo;s most laugh-inducing and aww-inducing moments of them all.</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;&hellip;Fiona&rsquo;s Father Hired A Sleazy Hitman To Whack You&hellip;&rdquo;
Shrek 2 (2004)</p>
<p>Donkey truly has a unique way of putting a positive spin on things, even in the most uncomfortably depressing of situations. Of course, his innate positivity often doesn&rsquo;t help at all, considering the dry manner in which he delivers and recaps news. But the effort counts, just as it does in Shrek 2 when he and Shrek find themselves on the run.
After meeting Fiona&rsquo;s royal parents, it&rsquo;s apparent Shrek is now a wanted man, as he&rsquo;ll never earn their approval. Things become so dire that Fiona&rsquo;s father enlists an assassin to put an end to Shrek&rsquo;s life altogether. As always, however, Donkey has some hilarious words to console his companion with — &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Things seem bad because it&rsquo;s dark and rainy and Fiona&rsquo;s father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you. It&rsquo;ll be better in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrek: 10 Hilariously Raunchy Jokes That Fans Only Noticed Now
Shrek is animated, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s strictly for kids. This means there are these 10 hilarious, raunchy jokes that fans only noticed now.</p>
<p>4  &ldquo;There Were Strong Gases Seepin&rsquo; Outta My Butt That Day!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Some things are better left unsaid, especially in the presence of others. Once again, however, Donkey&rsquo;s lack of self-awareness came back to haunt him when he uttered this quote about eating rotten berries, and the unfortunate side effects that came along with it. &ldquo;And then one time I ate some rotten berries. Man, there were some strong gases seepin&rsquo; outta my butt that day!&rdquo;
When it comes to matters of an upset stomach brought on by eating ill-advised foods, it is better to keep a lid on the situation. However, with Donkey&rsquo;s lack of inhibition and the nature of the Shrek franchise itself, there was no chance that the character&rsquo;s more intimate details would be left unsaid. He wouldn&rsquo;t be Donkey if he kept updates about his bodily functions to himself.</p>
<p>3  &ldquo;This Would Be So Much Easier If I Wasn&rsquo;t Colorblind!&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Donkey finds himself being quite the unlikely hero many times throughout the film franchise. One of the first times he does so is when Shrek is hurt by an arrow, and Princess Fiona gives him a quest to find a flower that he thinks will help heal the injury. Little does he know, the flowers are little more than a distraction to get him out of the way, so Fiona could tend to the injury herself.
But that doesn&rsquo;t make Donkey&rsquo;s attempts at heroism any less heroic - or any less hilarious. While trying to find a blue flower with red thorns, Donkey takes to reciting &ldquo;blue flower, red thorns&rdquo; over and over again, and ultimately reveals — when surrounded by those very flowers — that he is, in fact, conveniently colorblind. The entire montage is still hilarious after all these years.</p>
<p>2  &ldquo;The Position Of Annoying Talking Animal Is Already Taken.&rdquo;
Shrek 2 (2004)</p>
<p>Since Shrek and Donkey had become best friends by the end of Shrek, it was only natural for Shrek 2 to introduce yet another frenemy dynamic for the beloved Donkey. That frenemy, of course, came in the form of Antonio Banderas&rsquo; Puss in Boots, a pint-sized swashbuckler who would come to rival Donkey in terms of cuteness and snarkiness. These Shrek Donkey quotes ​​​​​​​show that the little guy might be self-aware.
From the moment they meet, Donkey doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to make his dislike for the little feline known. When Puss in Boots tries to pledge his loyalty to Shrek, the jealous Donkey immediately remarks &ldquo;The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.&rdquo; Of course, time would show that there&rsquo;s plenty of room for two annoying talking animals in Shrek&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Shrek: 10 Times Fans Felt Bad For Donkey
After Shrek fans met Donkey, he quickly became a fan-favorite character. But there were many times when everyone felt bad for what he went through.</p>
<p>1  &ldquo;&hellip;And Then There&rsquo;s That Big Awkward Silence, You Know?&rdquo;
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Donkey had many things going for him, but self-awareness was not one of them. In addition to being loud, brash, and irritating, he also had trouble taking a hint, especially when Shrek attempted to shoo him away several times and be rid of him upon their first meeting. &ldquo;I hate it when you&rsquo;ve got someone in your face, you try to give someone a hint and they won&rsquo;t leave, and then there&rsquo;s that big awkward silence, you know?&rdquo; Donkey said, without ever tasting the irony in his comments.
That makes the irony of this quote all the more obvious. Hearing these words uttered from the mouth of a character who couldn&rsquo;t seem to take his advice would drive anyone mad, and Shrek was certainly no exception. It was very funny, but there are also Shrek Donkey quotes that show who he is - a friend who will never take no for an answer.</p>
