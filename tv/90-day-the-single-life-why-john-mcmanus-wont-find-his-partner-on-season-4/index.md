## Literature Review
John Mcmanus is excited to find love on 90 Day: The Single Life, but there are a few reasons why he may be left disappointed at the end of the season.




John Mcmanus may not find his perfect match in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. The 40-year-old Texas man first featured as a supporting cast member in the franchise. He was part of Thaís Ramone and Patrick Mendes’ journey in 90 Day Fiancé season 9. Initially, John didn’t impress many viewers with his attitude. He became a villain for being a bad influence on Patrick. John caused many issues for his sister-in-law and tried to keep his brother away from her. However, he eventually came around and accepted them lovingly.




During 90 Day Fiancé season 9 Tell All, John didn’t just support his brother and his sister-in-law, but he also defended other cast members. He taught Jibri Bell a lesson for badmouthing people and created many viral moments. John became an instant hero for viewers right after his Tell All appearance. He got so popular that TLC offered him to film Pillow Talk with Patrick and entertain people. In late 2023, TLC announced that John would join 90 Day: The Single Life to find his perfect match. He’d try his luck at dating other women in hopes of discovering true love.

 John Appears Content With His Single Life 

 




John seems confident about his new journey, and his loyal fans are hopeful for him. However, this season, he may not find the woman of his dreams in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. The first big reason John won’t find a partner is his attitude toward life. Unlike other cast members, the Texas reality star is content with his singleness. It doesn’t seem like he is as eager to fall in love as others, such as Veronica Rodriguez, Tyray Mollett, or Chantel Everett. He may not want the relationship as badly, which may drive his dates away.



 John Seems To Be Rough Around The Edges 
          

John’s blunt tone may also scare his potential dates. Most viewers know that he’s quite savage when he speaks. He doesn’t hold back or fake his emotions. He came across as rude to Thaís numerous times during season 9. He had no idea how to make his sister-in-law feel comfortable. John is certainly a charmer, but his tone isn’t something that every woman will understand. In fact, there’s a high chance that his date/dates would find his sense of humor too crass and walk away from him.






 John Is A Red Flag 
          

John may not find his perfect match because of his habits. During season 9, viewers saw that he was a bit too much into partying and alcohol. He even pushed Patrick to join him instead of respecting Thaís. While he’s a much better family member now, he’s still the same person. He may have won fans, but it doesn’t mean he has changed himself. Some of John’s habits make him a walking red flag for most women. No one would want to be part of the new 90 Day: The Single Life star’s love life if he has a drinking problem and emotional baggage.



90 Day: The Single Life season 4 premieres Monday, January 1, 2024, at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
