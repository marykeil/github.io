## SUMMARY 



  Fans speculate that Kody and Robyn Brown might be planning a vow renewal, based on recent comments and sightings.   Viewers express frustration and threaten to boycott if Kody and Robyn&#39;s supposed second wedding is filmed, criticizing them for using Christine Brown&#39;s wedding to make money.

## Literature Review
Kody Brown and his fourth wife Robyn Brown may have happy news to share with reality TV viewers, according to a shocking theory by Sister Wives fans.




Sister Wives fans think Kody Brown could be getting married to Robyn Brown again if a wild theory is to be believed. Kody is a 54-year-old man from Wyoming who became a reality TV star when Sister Wives debuted in 2010. Kody has a total of 18 children with Robyn and his three ex-wives, who left him within 14 months of each other. Kody was married to Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, and Christine Brown as a part of his polygamist relationship. Kody and Meri were legally married for 14 years before he divorced her in 2014 to legally marry Robyn and adopt her three kids.




It appears the Sister Wives season 18 star could be renewing his vows with his fourth and only remaining wife soon, according to a theory floated by Lostsojourners on Reddit.


 

They created a post asking, “Anyone else think Kody’s comments about not being able to enjoy Robyn at their wedding is a set up for them to do a vow renewal? A new wedding?” in the Sister Wives subreddit. “They were seen at an airport the same weekend Christine got married. I would bet money they had a vow renewal and were flying away for another 11 day honeymoon!” wrote General-Bumblebee-33. “If they have a vow renewal, then I’ll be certain a divorce is imminent,” posted Nice_Exercise5552.

Several viewers in the comments decided that they would “boycott” the wedding special if Kody and Robyn’s supposed second wedding is filmed. They complained about Kody and Robyn being an unnecessary part of Christine and David Woolley’s wedding special with their “smug” faces on camera just so they could make money off Christine. Interestingly, Robyn has been “married” thrice in the past. Her first wedding was with her first ex-husband David Preston Jessop, who reportedly is Christine Brown&#39;s first cousin and the third cousin of Kody. Robyn and Kody were spiritually married in May 2010.

Robyn’s third marriage was to Kody when they legally married after his divorce from Meri. Kody had met Robyn while he was on a date with Meri. They met in 2009 when Kody and Meri were invited over to a friend’s house and were introduced to Robyn as his friend’s cousin. They met again at a church-sponsored event, and soon romance was in the air for both of them. Eventually, Robyn met with Kody’s first three wives, and Kody began courting Robyn. The Sister Wives couple dated for six months before they had had their spiritual union.




Robyn was the one who insisted on joining the Brown family because she wanted to experience the plural lifestyle. Thirteen years later, Robyn and Kody are in a monogamous marriage. The pair might not want Christine to upstage them with her fairytale wedding ceremony that will air in January 2024. The question is whether reality TV viewers would be interested in seeing Robyn and Kody getting remarried if that somehow happens to be the plot for Sister Wives season 19.



Sister Wives: Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding airs January 7 and 14 at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
