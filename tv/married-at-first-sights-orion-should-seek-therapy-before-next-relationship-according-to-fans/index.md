## Literature Review
Married At First Sight fans are saying that Orion should look into therapy before pursuing another relationship after his behavior on MAFS season 17.




Married At First Sight season 17&#39;s Orion Martzloff is being called out for his actions after his disappointing appearance on the show and his childish behavior in his marriage to Lauren. Orion was one of the several singles who were interested in being set up by the MAFS experts, giving up control to allow the experts to choose the woman he&#39;d marry. During their early moments, Orion and Lauren seemed like a decent match, but as time passed on Married At First Sight season 17, things changed drastically for the couple. In the most recent episodes, Orion chose to leave Lauren and their marriage behind after addressing his issues.




In a recent episode of Married At First Sight season 17, Orion shared with Lauren that he was interested in proceeding with a divorce, as he was no longer interested in the romantic side of their relationship. In the comments of a post shared by Married At First Sight on Instagram, fans weren&#39;t impressed with Orion&#39;s behavior or the explanation for his decision. &#34;Dude, if you’re gonna allow childhood trauma to ruin your marriage on day one… seek therapy before you do that to another woman,&#34; @amcarlile shared, pointing out that Orion ended the relationship because of unresolved childhood issues.


 Married At First Sight Fans Claim Excerpts Failed Lauren 
          

While Orion and Lauren&#39;s relationship wasn&#39;t perfect, it&#39;s clear that Orion&#39;s issues were at the forefront of their split. Despite the fact that Orion spoke up and wanted to end their relationship amicably, fans weren&#39;t happy about the lack of autonomy he gave Lauren in the decision. &#34;He’s a 26 year old boy who still lives with his mom. They had no business bringing him onto this show and messing up another persons life. Shame!&#34; @cherylfx08 explained, blaming the experts for their decision to bring Orion into the experiment for the split.





 

Many Married At First Sight season 17 viewers feel that the experts, who are meant to be bringing together compatible couples, failed Lauren in the experiment by pairing her with Orion. While Lauren has issues of her own, she is ready for a serious relationship. Orion, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t seem like he was prepared to date, let alone get married. Still living with his mother, Orion&#39;s maturity levels weren&#39;t up to par which made it clear that he wouldn&#39;t be successful in such a serious relationship from the start. The experts shouldn&#39;t have cast Orion and by doing so, took Lauren&#39;s potentially positive MAFS experience away from her.

Although there are only three couples left on Married At First Sight season 17, the marriages that have already ended are the more interesting relationships on the series. With Orion and Lauren choosing to leave their marriage behind, it&#39;s possible that Orion may choose to address his issues before he gets into another relationship. Married At First Sight viewers hope to see more thoughtful pairings in the future, as well as better communication from the couples who do get matched up so they don&#39;t have issues like Lauren and Orion faced.
