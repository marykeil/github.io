# Young Sheldon Season 6 Streaming Release Date Confirmed


## SUMMARY 



  Young Sheldon season 6 will finally be available on Netflix, allowing viewers to catch up before the final season premieres on CBS.   The show&#39;s availability on Netflix has helped grow its fan base and attract new viewers, but it will not impact the show&#39;s cancellation.   Despite being popular, the decision to end Young Sheldon was made by the creators to stay true to The Big Bang Theory canon.

## Literature Review
Young Sheldon season 6 will officially arrive on Netflix months after its first five seasons debuted on the platform, and it will be big for season 7.




Young Sheldon season 6 will arrive on Netflix before its final season premieres on CBS. Towards late 2023, it was announced that The Big Bang Theory prequel would arrive on Netflix for the first time. Previously, both CBS comedies were only exclusively available on Max, but as part of Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s licensing deal with the streamer, Sheldon and the Coopers&#39; story can now also be accessed through the platform. Unsurprisingly, Young Sheldon quickly became a Netflix hit, even though the streamer only houses the first five of its six seasons.




Now, What&#39;s On Netflix reports that Young Sheldon season 6 will finally be available on Netflix on February 1, 2024. This is just several days from Young Sheldon&#39;s season 7 debut on CBS, which happens to also be its final season. There&#39;s a lot of conversation about The Big Bang Theory prequel ending, especially as it continues to be very popular. Regardless of that, however, those who want to catch up to Sheldon&#39;s Texas story before the spin-off fully wraps up now will be able to do so.


 How Young Sheldon Season 6â€™s Netflix Release Impacts Season 7 
          

Young Sheldon has been charting on Netflix since it debuted on the service, which means that aside from those who want to revisit the series, it also allows more viewers to get on board the show before the series ends. The problem was that to be able to be fully caught up, they still had to get a Max subscription as season 6 wasn&#39;t available on Netflix. Now, those who held off and stopped at season 5 have enough time to restart their binge and finish Young Sheldon season 6 in preparation for season 7.




This increases the potential viewership who will be tuning in on CBS when Young Sheldon season 7 premieres on February 15. Unfortunately, the expected surge of viewers will have no impact on the show&#39;s future. Its cancellation was due to The Big Bang Theory canon and not the lack of interest. In fact, that&#39;s one of the reasons why ending it this year is such a tricky decision to make for the network. However, it was the creatives behind the series, who also worked on The Big Bang Theory, who decided that it was best to cap it off at its pre-determined end.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Hints At An Unexpected Character Return   A brand new Young Sheldon season 7 promo hints at the unexpected return of a divisive character that will make the Coopers&#39; lives a bit complicated.     

Young Sheldon ending despite still being very popular is disappointing. The show has long outgrown its ties to The Big Bang Theory and should have pivoted towards being more of a family comedy/drama than the origins story for Sheldon. It will be interesting to see how much increase in viewership it will get from its recent Netflix availability.
