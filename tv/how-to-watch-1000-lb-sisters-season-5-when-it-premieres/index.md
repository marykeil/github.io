## Literature Review
1000-lb Sisters season 5 has premiered, featuring different relationship dynamics from the previous season. Here&#39;s how to watch the season. 





1000-lb Sisters season 5 is finally here after a brief hiatus. The events of 1000-lb Sisters season 4 showed a laudable development in the lives of Tammy Slaton and sister Amy Slaton. However, since the season finale, where fans watched Tammy come full circle when she married Caleb Willingham, many surprising developments have occurred in the 1000-lb Sisters world. Tammy&#39;s marriage to Caleb crashed shortly after they tied the knot, and Caleb tragically lost his life months later, in June, at the age of 40. Meanwhile, Tammy has also been documenting her weight-loss journey on her Instagram.




In an unpleasant twist, Amy&#39;s marriage to Michael Halterman ended after almost four years of marriage. 1000-lb Sisters season 4 documented the coupleâ€™s journey to welcoming their second child, Glenn, and their divorce after the season ended was an unexpected development. Still, fans will get to see how all the events unfolded now that 1000-lb Sisters season 5 has premiered.
