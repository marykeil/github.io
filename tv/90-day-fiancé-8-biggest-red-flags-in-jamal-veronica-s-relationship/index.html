Communication is a major issue in their relationship, with Jamal not being responsive to Veronica&rsquo;s texts and calls.
There are concerns about Jamal potentially cheating on Veronica, as he has admitted to sleeping with other people and not being fully committed to her.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé couple Veronica Rodriguez and Jamal Menzies are certainly heading for a split considering all the pros and cons of their relationship.</p>
<p>90 Day: The Single Life couple Veronica Rodriguez and Jamal Menzies are not meant to be together due to the many red flags in their relationship. Veronica started off her reality TV career as a side character in Tim Malcolm’s storyline in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 3. Veronica had been with Tim for seven years before they split and decided to continue co-parenting her daughter Chloe. Veronica had gotten pregnant when she was 20 and married her baby daddy. Veronica broke up with her ex-husband before Chloe was even born. She’d met Tim after her divorce.
In the eight years that followed, Veronica dated different kinds of men, including Justin Foster from 90 Day: The Single Life season 3. Justin kept Veronica in the dark about his move to a different state, leading to their breakup. Veronica knew Jamal from the franchise, but they started talking when Jamal slid into her DMs and complimented her eyes. Veronica thought Jamal was sexy the first second she laid eyes on him. They met up for the first time when Veronica went to San Diego, but kept things casual. Veronica knew she wanted to get married again, but Jamal may not have been the right man.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>7  Jamal &amp; Veronica Have A 10 Year Age Gap
Veronica Wants To Get Married</p>
<p>Jamal was 27 years old when he made his 90 Day Fiancé debut with Before the 90 Days season 5. Jamal became an instant favorite among fans when Kim introduced him to the audience as her son. Kim spoke about how much Jamal meant to her and said he was the best thing to come out of her marriage to her first husband. Jamal had appeared briefly on a FaceTime call screen on Kim’s phone and was declared a 90 Day Fiancé heartthrob. Among the many fans that got a crush on Jamal, one may have been his co-star, Veronica.
However, Veronica was 36 at the time, 10 years older than Kim’s son. Veronica was much younger than any man she had dated before. During the Tell All, Jamal made it clear that he was “having fun” and hence, not interested in a serious relationship. Veronica, on the other hand, had one ultimate goal and that was to get married again. Her thoughts did not align with Jamal, more or less because of their age gap and the different goals they had in life.</p>
<p>6  Jamal Is Not A Good Communicator
Jamal Doesn&rsquo;t Text Veronica Back</p>
<p>During 90 Day: The Single Life, the cameras showed Jamal waking up in Veronica’s bed. She said that Jamal and she had made “such a great connection” that they were going to give the exclusivity thing a try. However, Veronica told the cameras that Jamal was not a good communicator. She confronted Jamal to talk about how they always got along well when they were together in person, but the moment Jamal left, he would “suck at communication.” Veronica accused Jamal of not texting her back at all. He corrected her by saying he texted the next day. Jamal didn’t think it was important for them to text 24/7.</p>
<p>5  Jamal &amp; Veronica Are Dating Long Distance
Jamal &amp; Veronica Live 2400 Miles Away From Each Other</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the lack of communication bothers Veronica is that they live almost 2400 miles away from each other. Veronica lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. Jamal lives in San Diego, California. Jamal and Veronica had been traveling back and forth between San Diego and Charlotte. However, Veronica was concerned about the future of their relationship since he had communication issues, and “that’s the only way this is going to work.” Jamal said he didn’t want to know what Veronica was up to throughout the day, while Veronica said she would have liked knowing what was happening in his life.</p>
<p>4  Jamal Could Cheat On Veronica
Could Jamal Still Be Meeting Other Women On The Side?</p>
<p>Jamal claimed he was more of a face-to-face guy and that had always been his “vibe.” Jamal noticed that Veronica took it “personally” when he wasn’t available for her. He concluded it was because of her insecurity and her thinking that he didn’t want to talk to her. Jamal had been open about him sleeping with other people after he met Veronica. He said he was using protection. Veronica, meanwhile, was seemingly committed to Jamal in her head because he was being “lazy” about dating other men. Tim wasn’t amused by the arrangement. He knew Veronica wanted to tell Jamal, “Hey, you&rsquo;ve got to get rid of the other girls.”
However, Veronica claimed it was she who suggested they have an open relationship. Jamal could have taken advantage of Veronica being so easygoing and continued to see other women as soon as he left North Carolina. His not being available to text Veronica on the same day suggested he could have been spending time with someone else behind her back.</p>
<p>3  Jamal Is Unemployed
Does Jamal See Veronica As A Sugar Mama?</p>
<p>During the same episode, Veronica and Tim discussed her relationship with Jamal. She admitted that Tim was confused when she told him about her and Jamal being in an exclusive relationship. Tim said he was shocked that Veronica was dating a man who lived at home and didn’t have a job. According to Jamal’s LinkedIn profile, in 2022, he was working full-time as a Legal Administrative Assistant for Progressive Insurance for two years. However, once he stopped working for yet unknown reasons, Jamal may have expected Veronica to be his sugar mama after they started dating, even though Veronica did not say it out loud.</p>
<p>2  Jamal Doesn&rsquo;t Get Along With Veronica&rsquo;s Friend Tim
Tim Doesn&rsquo;t Feel Veronica Deserves Jamal</p>
<p>As per Tim, Veronica deserved a man who would put her on a pedestal. “It’s sad to me,” Tim had exclaimed after the Tell All reveal. Tim couldn’t believe that Veronica was “lowering” herself to that position. At the time, Jamal had stood up for himself and told Tim that he was the one who never wanted Veronica to be happy. He accused Tim of constantly trying to put Veronica down. Meanwhile, Veronica believed she wanted to explore what could happen between her and Jamal if they gave their relationship a chance. She insisted they both wanted to spend as much time together as they could.
The trailer for the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off&rsquo;s season 4, meanwhile, shows Jamal and Tim getting into a terrible fight. Jamal, Tim, and Veronica are all seated at an outdoor venue with a few of their friends. Jamal turns to Tim to ask him what he has done to give Tim such a bad impression of him. Tim says that it “doesn’t matter” what he thinks about him and Veronica, but Jamal calls him a “b**ch” and as Tim interrupts him, Jamal tells him to not raise his voice at him. “What you’re not going to do is question me being a dad to Chloe,” Tim says angrily.</p>
<p>1  Jamal &amp; Veronica Have Mostly Already Split In 2024
Jamal &amp; Veronica Don&rsquo;t Seem To Be Together</p>
<p>It turns out, Tim may have been right all along about Jamal and Veronica being incompatible. Jamal and Veronica went on a trip together to Mexico in early 2023 but haven’t shown any signs of being together since then. Veronica has been busy posting about Tim on social media and Jamal mostly spends time with his mom, Kim, and his friends. Jamal and Veronica were also seen celebrating New Year’s Eve with their loved ones and weren’t a part of each other’s celebrations. The 90 Day: The Single Life pair is either keeping things hush-hush because of their contract or has decided to part ways in 2024.
90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.</p>
