## Literature Review
Following Monday night&#39;s new episode of Below Deck Med, there is some speculation that Captain Sandy will fire Kyle, and no one would blame her. 




Monday night&#39;s new episode of Below Deck Mediterranean ended with Captain Sandy Yawn yelling at Stew Kyle Viljoen, leading many to speculate that she will fire him. The season began without Kyle after he was stuck in customs due to issues with his visa. He and Chief Stew Tumi Mhlongo arrived later than the rest of the crew, while Stew Natalya Scudder was left to manage the interior team with Stew Jessika Asai and temporary Stew Brooke Boney. Once Kyle and Tumi arrived, the boat was turned upside down in terms of drama, and Kyle was the catalyst for the drama.




The downfall of Kyle began when he told Tumi prior to joining the boat that he and Natalya had ups and downs last season and that Tumi should be careful despite Kyle claiming he and Natalya were friends. Tumi stepped onto the boat already unsure of Natalya, and it created a rift between them that didn&#39;t need to be there. As the season went on, Kyle would continue to play Tumi and Natalya against each other without either of them realizing what was going on. Natalya eventually caught on the Kyle&#39;s game, and the two had an explosive fight two nights before Natalya decided to leave.

 Kyle Causes Too Much Drama On Board 
          




From the moment Kyle joined Below Deck Med season 8, he began stirring the pot within the interior team. It started before Kyle even stepped foot on the boat while he and Tumi were stuck in customs. Kyle told Tumi to watch out for Natalya as she doesn&#39;t do well when it comes to being a subordinate. Tumi was obviously worried Natalya wouldn&#39;t respect her and made it clear once she got on board that she was the boss. This caused a feud between Natalya and Tumi as Natalya felt like Tumi didn&#39;t appreciate her efforts from the first charter. This basically lasted until Natalya left the boat.

Kyle also began to start some drama with Deckhand Max Salvador during their most recent crew night out. The alcohol-fuelled fight began when Max, who&#39;s French, tried to explain that he supports the LGBTQIA community. Kyle took it as Max saying he&#39;s also part of that community despite being heterosexual, which he was offended by. Natalya tried to cool the situation by telling Kyle that Max just meant that he&#39;s an ally of the community, which caused Kyle to yell and scream at Natalya, calling her a plethora of mean names. Max and Kyle later hashed it out, and Kyle realized it was simply a language barrier.




Kyle doesn&#39;t know how to keep his emotions in check. Captain Sandy saw that these feuds all went back to Kyle, which made her second guess his employment on the boat. Kyle is starting to act like a bully, and Sandy will not all this type of behavior to continue on her boat.



 He&#39;s Been Lazier Than Usual 
          

While Kyle calls himself &#34;the service queen,&#34; he hasn&#39;t been living up to the name on Below Deck Med season 8. During one of the more recent episodes, Kyle tried to pawn off his service duties onto Jessika. He made a joke by saying how Tumi and Jessika will do amazing on service for the next charter. While Tumi laughed, she didn&#39;t think Kyle trying to get out of work was that funny. This was when Tumi started to realize that Kyle wasn&#39;t doing his job the way she had hoped.




If Tumi is noticing that Kyle has become lazier, so has Captain Sandy. She has eyes and ears all over the boat and is very in tune with what is going on with the crew. However, even if she isn&#39;t aware of Kyle&#39;s lack of work ethic in Below Deck Med season 8, she will pay more attention during the next charter. After Natalya&#39;s sudden departure, which was partly caused by Kyle, Captain Sandy is going to be keeping a closer eye on him.



 Captain Sandy Lost Natalya (A Good Stew) Because Of Kyle 
         

Captain Sandy enjoyed having Natalya on board and appreciated her efforts during the first charter. Sandy sees that Natalya has a great work ethic and didn&#39;t want her to leave the boat when she did. However, Natalya couldn&#39;t stay on the boat for multiple reasons, and Sandy completely understood why. She felt emotionally overwhelmed by her relationship back home and the status of it, plus she was hurt by Kyle, who she thought was her best friend. Natalya didn&#39;t feel like she could trust anyone on board anymore, so there was no point in her staying.




Kyle clearly didn&#39;t create a safe space for Natalya in the interior team, and Captain Sandy sees that. All Kyle did was start drama, which created a toxic environment in the interior team. Captain Sandy doesn&#39;t want to lose another crew member, so she may get rid of Kyle to keep the other stews happy. If Kyle keeps acting like this, he may drive Tumi and Jessika to leave the boat early.



 Will Kyle Return For Below Deck Med Season 9? 
          

Judging by Captain Sandy scolding Kyle towards the end of this week&#39;s Below Deck Med season 8 episode, it doesn&#39;t seem like Kyle will return to the show. Sandy said she could see that Kyle wanted to be the chief stew, but she would never want him as one on one of her boats. Sandy doesn&#39;t seem like she can trust Kyle to be a good stew, let alone a good leader. If Below Deck Med returns for season 9, it seems very unlikely that Kyle will return if Sandy is at the helm.




Overall, Captain Sandy may fire Kyle at the start of the next new Below Deck Med episode, but nothing has been confirmed. Sandy finally saw that Kyle was the problem in the interior team, and she may cut him loose to have a smoother rest of the season. However, the jury is still out on whether or not Sandy will fire Kyle.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
