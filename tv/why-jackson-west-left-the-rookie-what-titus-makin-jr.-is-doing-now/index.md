## Literature Review
Here is the reason why after being the main character in The Rookie for three seasons, Jackson West suddenly departed from the series in season 4.




Titus Makin Jr.&#39;s The Rookie character, Jackson West, abruptly departed from the series towards the end of season 3, but there are some interesting behind-the-scenes reasons for why Jackson left The Rookie. Assigned to the Mid-Wilshire Division, Jackson West was among the main police officers in The Rookie throughout the first three seasons. However, in the closing moments of The Rookie season 3, he and Lopez got kidnapped by Sandra de la Cruz&#39; men during Angela and Wesley&#39;s wedding. While this alone did not confirm that Jackson left The Rookie, audiences started speculating about his departure after he did not appear in season 4&#39;s promotional material.




Speculations rang true when The Rookie season 4&#39;s episode 1 revealed that Jackson West tragically died. To confirm this news, season 4 featured CCTV footage that showed how Jackson was shot by Sandra de la Cruz&#39; men when he tried to escape them. The episode ended with a poignant scene where Angela Lopez paid her tribute to Jackson by naming her newborn son after him. While the show gives Jackson&#39;s characterization satisfying and emotional closure, his death in Rookie season 3 is upsetting, given how he was among the primary protagonists since the show&#39;s episode 1.

According to reports (via TVLine), The Rookie&#39;s creators closed Jackson West&#39;s storyline in season 4 because actor Titus Makin Jr. did not want to return. Recalling the actor&#39;s decision to leave the series, The Rookie&#39;s showrunner Alexi Hawley said that after hearing the news of the actor&#39;s exit, they needed to do their best to honor him since he had been a crucial part of the show&#39;s storyline since the beginning. Although Hawley did not disclose the reasons behind Titus Makin Jr.&#39;s decision to leave, Titus Makin Jr. had considered leaving The Rookie in 2020 after learning about the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

In an interview (via EW), Makin recalled that while watching the news one day, he realized that he could not go back to &#34;go play a cop on a show and not talk about the fact that I&#39;m a Black cop.&#34; The fact that his character had not addressed any of that made him reconsider his decision to play his role in The Rookie. He added that he even talked to Hawley about the same and told him that if he wants to write him out, he will &#34;politely receive that.&#34; All in all, Titus Makin Jr. preferred being written out over ignoring the reality of things.
