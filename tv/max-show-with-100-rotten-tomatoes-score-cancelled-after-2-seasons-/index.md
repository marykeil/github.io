## Literature Review

Creator Issa Rae’s Max show, which boasts a rare 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, has been cancelled following the release of season 2 last year.




Rap Sh!t has been cancelled at Max after 2 seasons. Created by Issa Rae, Rap Sh!t first released on Max in summer 2022, following Miami rappers Shawna (Aida Osman) and Mia (KaMillion) as they attempt to make it big in the music industry while holding their personal lives together. Season 2 of the critically-acclaimed show hit the streamer in November and concluded in December, with the rave reviews continuing the series&#39; coveted 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes.




Now, TheWrap reports that Rap Sh!t season 3 will not be moving forward at Max. While Rae has yet to share a response online about the news, a spokesperson from Max shared the following statement:


“We are extremely grateful to Issa Rae for creating Rap Sh!t, a one-of-a-kind comedy with compelling social commentary that reached viewers in a way only Issa’s talents can accomplish. A huge thank you to Issa, showrunner Syreeta Singleton and the teams at Hoorae and 3 Arts Entertainment for introducing us to Shawna and Mia, a duo whose journey fans have been invested in and who they have continued to root for through everything. We’ll never get Seduce and Scheme out of our heads and we wouldn’t have it any other way.”

 Rap Sh!t&#39;s Cancellation Continues A Max Trend 
          




Critics heaped praise on Rap Sh!t season 2&#39;s cast and storytelling, but critical acclaim was evidently not enough to see the series continue. Although cancellations are and have always been a normal part of the TV show experience, Rap Sh!t&#39;s cancellation seemingly falls into a broader trend currently sweeping the streaming landscape. While the rush to catch up with Netflix led to streamers spending billions on content to bolster their libraries, this period is now at an end as an increased focus is put on profitability.



Rap Sh!t&#39;s cancellation mirrors Apple TV Plus&#39; cancellation of Swagger last November, a show with a 93% Rotten Tomatoes score.




Max, specifically, was the first streamer to take a hard-line approach in this regard after the merging of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Max memorably shelved the completed Batgirl movie in 2022 as part of a tax write-off strategy, and a series of show cancellations and content removals would follow over the next year. While Max&#39;s string of surprising cancellations is now mostly at an end, the latest Rap Sh!t announcement is further proof of how the streamer will be handling renewals moving forward.




Defining &#34;success&#34; in the streaming age is a challenge, as most streamers don&#39;t share in depth data about their original shows and movies. Box office performance makes it easy to determine whether a movie was a success or a failure, for example, but it&#39;s less clear when a streaming service uses metrics like watch hours, subscription growth, or total views to determine whether a piece of content is worth what it costs to make. While Rap Sh!t won&#39;t be continuing, the two existing crititally-acclaimed seasons are both still available to stream on Max.
