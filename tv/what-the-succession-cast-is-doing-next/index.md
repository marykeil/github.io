## Literature Review

After its conclusion, it&#39;s safe to say Succession is one of the greatest drama shows ever, with a magnificent cast. Here&#39;s what they&#39;re doing next.




HBO&#39;s Succession became known for its beloved ensemble cast, whom viewers may want to keep up with now that the series is finished. Centered around the ultra-wealthy Roy family, the children of aging patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) vie for their stake in the company&#39;s future in preparation for his impending death. From Shakespearean drama to laugh-out-loud comedy, HBO&#39;s masterpiece has delivered some of television&#39;s most powerful and memorable performances. After four seasons, Succession concluded in May 2023 to astounding critical and cultural acclaim.
The series ran away with a mountain of awards from the Golden Globes and the Emmys, with several members of the main cast recognized for their phenomenal work as the constituents of the Roy family. Succession has given its cast challenging standards to live up to, but the brilliant actors should be up to the task. From feature films to brand-new streaming service shows to Broadway plays, there&#39;s much to look forward to in 2024 and beyond.
            
 
 Kieran Culkin Is Right: There&#39;s Only 1 Succession Spinoff Idea That Could Work 
Now that Succession is over, star Kieran Culkin&#39;s chosen character for a spinoff is the only one that would make sense for a future project.












 








 10  Alan Ruck (Connor Roy) 
Alan Ruck is returning to feature films and has two on the way.
Long before Succession, Alan Ruck was recognized as Cameron in the &#39;80s classic Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off. Still, playing Connor Roy allowed him to show his talent like never before, delivering some of the greatest and funniest Succession quotes while also being one of the more subtly complex characters. Alan Ruck currently has two films in production, titled Crust and Wind River: Rising. The latter is a sequel to the 2017 film Wind Rising. Since Succession ended, Alan Ruck also appeared in The Burial alongside Jamie Foxx and Tommy Lee Jones.





 9  Nicholas Braun (Greg) 
Nicholas Braun has appeared in two films since Succession ended.
Since Succession ended, Nicholas Braun has already been in two feature films. He starred in the independent movie Cat Person and also played a supporting role in the Nicolas Cage A24 film Dream Scenario. Aside from joking about a Cousin Greg spin-off show, Braun didn&#39;t reveal much about what else he has going on at the Emmys or Golden Globes. As seen in the funniest Tom and Greg moments in Succession, Braun has serious comedic chops and will be an exciting actor to follow.





 8  Dagmara Dominczyk (Karolina) 
Dagmara Dominczyk will play supporting roles in exciting 2024 films.
Though she played a minor role in Succession, Dagmara Dominczyk has one of the more impressive filmographies outside the HBO series. In 2023, she appeared in Sofia Coppola&#39;s Priscilla, the comedy Bottoms, and the latest Insidious film. Her upcoming films include Tonight at Noon, where she&#39;ll appear with Chiwetel Ejiofor. Dominczyk&#39;s most anticipated release is Miller&#39;s Girl, which stars Martin Freeman and Jenna Ortega.
            
 
 Succession Season 5: Why It Isn&#39;t Happening 
Creator Jesse Armstrong chose to end Succession after four seasons, although the prestige HBO drama series could have continued much further.








 7  J. Smith-Cameron (Gerri) 
J. Smith-Cameron has an adult animated series and a film project releasing in 2024. J. Smith-Cameron was deservedly nominated for Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Gerri, which has been the most notable performance in her career. Hopefully, the acclaim will result in more significant film and TV roles for the actress. On January 25, Smith-Cameron will co-star alongside Percy Jackson&#39;s Charlie Bushnell in an adult animated series for Peacock, created by Zach Woods and Mike Judge. She&#39;ll also be appearing in the film adaptation of Turtles All the Way Down, which will be released on Max in 2024. 6  Alexander Skarsgård (Lukas Matsson) Alexander Skarsgård has exciting movies in early production and a big TV guest appearance in 2024. Due to his family associations and previous iconic work on HBO shows like True Blood and Big Little Lies, Alexander Skarsgård is among the most famous stars to appear on Succession. In 2024, Skarsgård will be guest starring in an episode of Amazon Prime Video&#39;s Mr. and Mrs. Smith remake, opposite Donald Glover and Maya Erskine. Aside from that, he has two exciting films in pre-production. Skarsgård will star in The Pack alongside Florence Pugh and in a movie called The Tiger, centered around his character facing off with a giant, supernaturally powered tiger. 5  Matthew Macfadyen (Tom Wambsgans) After winning Succession, Matthew Macfadyen has some big films on the horizon.         Matthew Macfadyen has rightfully swept award shows, bringing home a Golden Globe and an Emmy, after winning it all as CEO at the end of Succession. It&#39;s an exciting year for the British actor, who seems perfectly fit to lend his comedic talents to one of 2024&#39;s most-anticipated movies, Deadpool 3. His role is undisclosed currently, but if it&#39;s significant enough, it could lead to future Marvel appearances. Another film, Holland, Michigan, which stars Macfadyen alongside Nicole Kidman and Rachel Sennott, is in post-production and could be released in 2024. 4  Brian Cox (Logan Roy) Brian Cox has various film and television roles underway.         Brian Cox has had a magnificent career of supporting roles in films like Manhunter and Troy, but Succession gave him the platform to showcase his immense talent. Brian Cox got a head start over the rest of the cast, having been killed off in episode 3, and he&#39;s had some voice work for various series since. Cox has a plethora of work underway, including the animated film The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, which will be released in December 2024. His films Skelly, The Parenting, and Wittgenstein&#39;s Poker are all in post-production and could be out in 2024.                  Succession&#39;s Biggest Twist Almost Happened 3 Seasons Earlier (&amp; It Would Have Changed Everything)   Succession season 4 shocked audiences with a sudden and lethal twist, but it turns out that same plot point was almost used three seasons earlier.    3  Jeremy Strong (Kendall Roy) Jeremy Strong is starring in a Broadway play and a biopic about Donald Trump in 2024.         Proving to be a phenomenal actor in Succession, Jeremy Strong will be a coveted actor for years to come. In early 2024, he&#39;s starring in a Broadway play titled An Enemy of the People alongside Michael Imperioli and Victoria Pedretti, which looks to be a top-notch production that he&#39;s seriously invested in. Strong has also been shooting a film titled The Apprentice, which could be a big film release exploring the life of a younger Donald Trump, played by Sebastian Stan. Strong will star in the film as the famous lawyer Roy Cohn. 2  Sarah Snook (Shiv Roy) Emmy Winner Sarah Snook has a prestigious play underway in London.         Like her on-screen husband, Sarah Snook has taken home an Emmy and a Golden Globe for her role as Shiv Roy in Succession. Since the show ended, she&#39;s starred in a film called The Beanie Bubble with Elizabeth Banks and Zach Galifianakis, which can be seen on Apple TV&#43;. On January 23, she&#39;s starring in a Sydney Theatre Company production of The Picture of Dorian Gray in London, where she&#39;ll be playing all 26 characters of the Oscar Wilde play. 1  Kieran Culkin (Roman Roy) Kieran Culkin has an exciting film and animated series underway.         Beginning as a child actor with his brothers, Kieran Culkin has appeared in movies and shows for decades. Now, he&#39;s an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning star who&#39;s widely beloved for his role as Roman Roy in Succession. In 2024, he&#39;s starring alongside Jesse Eisenberg in a film called A Real Pain, which is also written and directed by Eisenberg. He&#39;s also voicing a character with co-stars Natasha Lyonne and Keke Palmer in an animated series titled The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy.
