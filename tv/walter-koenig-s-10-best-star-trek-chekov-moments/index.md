## Literature Review
Here are the best moments of Walter Koenig as Star Trek: The Original Series&#39; iconic Russian Starfleet Officer, Pavel Chekov.




Ensign Pavel Andreivich Chekov (Walter Koenig) joined Star Trek: The Original Series season 2 as the young Russian navigator of the USS Enterprise. Joining the TOS cast for the show&#39;s second and third seasons and the first seven movies, Walter Koenig hoped to attract a younger, teenage audience to the space-faring franchise. Koenig&#39;s boyish charm and Davey Jones-esque haircut added youthful energy and charming whimsy to the otherwise slightly more mature Enterprise crew. Like Anton Yelchin, who played Pavel Chekov in J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek movies, Koenig was born to Russian parents and grew up in America, using a Russian accent for the role.
Walter Koenig&#39;s first appearance in Star Trek: The Original Series season 2, episode 1, &#34;Amok Time,&#34; initiated many interestingly humorous and role-defining moments over TOS&#39;s long run, with Chekov quickly becoming a fan favorite. From attempting to simulate the sound of a blizzard in Star Trek V to declaring that &#39;The Garden of Eden&#39; is located just outside of Moscow in TOS season 2, episode 5, &#34;The Apple&#34;, to the numerous and erroneous claims of things originating in Russia, Chekov has a wealth of wit and charm that effortlessly complements his energy and confident capacity aboard ship. Here&#39;s a look at Walter Koenig&#39;s ten best Chekov moments.
After Star Trek: The Original Series concluded in 1969, the cast went on to voice their respective characters in Star Trek: The Animated Series. Due to budgetary constraints, Walter Koenig&#39;s Pavel Chekov was the only character from the main cast not to appear in the animated show, with a new character, Lieutenant Arex (voiced by James Doohan), taking over the role of navigator.

 10  Chekov Shows Assertiveness With A Senior Officer 
Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 2, Episode 7, &#34;Catspaw&#34;
        

A young Ensign Chekov is tasked with recalibrating the science station scanner in Star Trek&#39;s Halloween-esque episode &#34;Catspaw.&#34; Operating the station in Spock&#39;s (Leonard Nimoy) absence, the newly assigned navigator delivers an update to temporary ship commander and assistant chief engineer, Lieutenant DeSalle (Michael Barrier), who questions the findings. When DeSalle asks if Chekov requires assistance with the task, Chekov responds, &#34;I can do it, sir. I&#39;m not that green,&#34; before walking away to begin the task. Chekov demonstrates that though new to the Bridge roster, he is confident in his abilities and capable, easily proving his value as a Bridge officer and an asset to the team.





 9  Chekov Meets Apollo On Pollux IV 
Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 2, Episode 2, &#34;Who Mourns For Adonais?&#34;


 







Captain James T. Kirk&#39;s (William Shatner) Enterprise landing party meets the ancient Greek-styled Apollo (Michael Barrier), following an initial contact by way of a giant green hand in space that tightly grips the ship. Chekov sarcastically responds to the proclamation of Apollo&#39;s identity with, &#34;And I am the Tsar of all the Russias!&#34; As Kirk indicates for Chekov to stand down, he admits he&#39;s &#34;never met a God before.&#34; It&#39;s an amusing moment that helps to break the absurdity of the situation and forward the momentum, also working to develop the characters with a sense of commonality and relatability. Chekov&#39;s sense of humor and eager enthusiasm are presented clearly in this episode.





 8  Chekov Is Killed By Morgan Earp 
Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 3, Episode 6, &#34;Spectre of the Gun&#34;


 







The Enterprise landing party faces danger at the hands of a reclusive alien race, trapped in a re-enactment of the O.K. Corral gunfight as the losing side. Filling the role of Billy Claiborne, Chekov connects with a woman named Sylvia (Bonnie Beecher). When Kirk suggests limiting his interactions with Sylvia, Chekov argues that their standing orders are not to upset the natives. Later, a jealous Morgan Earp (Rex Holman) confronts Chekov, killing him. Fortunately, the situation is an illusion by the Melkotians, and Chekov returns to the Enterprise alive. In an interview with StarTrek.com in 2011, Koenig revealed that &#34;Spectre of the Gun&#34; was one of his most enjoyed episodes.
It was an interesting concept mandated by economics. Our budget was very small and they didn&#39;t have the wherewithal to be a complete, detailed Wild West town, so they did it in a sort of abstract manner, which I thought gave it some class and some style. I thought it was a very, very good decision and it worked very well. 






 7  Chekov Is Not Happy About The Dinner Guests 
Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country
        

In Star Trek VI, the Enterprise is assigned to transport a diplomatic group of Klingons to Earth for negotiations. After the Klingons accept Kirk&#39;s awkward invitation to dine, a sullen Commander Chekov voices how everyone feels with a gloomy, &#34;Guess who&#39;s coming to dinner.&#34; This inelegant moment assists in breaking some of the tension of the scene, with emotions and old resentments palpably high. Chekov&#39;s unexcited disdain is both in keeping with his personable openness and the aging and growth of his character over time. Walter Koenig didn&#39;t enjoy making Star Trek VI, feeling the movie was &#34;totally devoid of any individuality for the supporting characters.&#34;

 6  Chekov Helps To Outwit Harry Mudd&#39;s Androids 
Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 2, Episode 8, &#34;I, Mudd&#34;


 







The Enterprise is hijacked by an android posing as a crewman and taken four days off-course to an uncharted planet where they encounter a previous foe, Harry Mudd (Roger C. Carmel). With the androids fulfilling the crew&#39;s whims and simultaneously beaming other crew members down from the ship, it&#39;s a race against time to re-take the ship. Chekov and Uhura initially seem to enjoy their time on the planet, with Chekov commenting that, &#34;this place is even better than Leningrad!&#34; Nonetheless, he aids his crew in defeating the androids with a scheme of illogical absurdity and demonstrates faith, unwavering loyalty, and a zest for fun.





 5  Evil-Chekov Attempts To Assassinate Kirk 
Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 2, Episode 4, &#34;Mirror, Mirror&#34;


 







When an ion storm interferes with a matter transport back to the Enterprise, the landing party materializes on a near-identical ship in a parallel Mirror Universe. With a different uniform and everyone on board decidedly evil, the landing party must find a way home. The evil-universe Chekov follows Kirk when he leaves the Bridge and attempts to assassinate the unsuspecting Captain. He explains that &#34;no one would dare question the assassination of a captain who disobeys the prime orders of the Empire&#34; and is sent to the agony booth for punishment. This episode, though not featuring Prime-universe Chekov, highlights the differences between the two counterparts and Koenig&#39;s acting prowess.





 4  Chekov Helps An Ailing Landing Party 
Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 2, Episode 12, &#34;The Deadly Years&#34; A landing party on Gamma Hydra IV discovers a colony of experimental scientists suffering from a rapid aging disease. Terrorized, Chekov panics when he comes upon the dead body of a very aged man. On Enterprise, everyone but Chekov is affected by the disease and begins to suffer from age-related ailments. Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) runs a series of medical tests to understand Chekov&#39;s immunity. Chekov&#39;s increasing discomfort and frustration contrasts with the aging officers&#39; failing agility and memories. On the Bridge, Chekov remarks to Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (George Takei), &#34;If I live long enough, I will run out of samples,&#34; adding, &#34;Oh yes, I&#39;ll live. But I won&#39;t enjoy it.&#34;





 3  Chekov Infiltrates The Naval Base In Alameda 
Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home


 







In 1986 San Francisco, Chekov and Uhura are tasked with collecting high-energy radioactive photons from the Alameda Naval Base to implement repairs to the ship&#39;s dilithium chamber. Eventually, successfully locating the base and collecting the photons, Chekov is captured and interrogated by base authorities. Falling from a high ledge during an escape attempt, Chekov is injured and transported to hospital for emergency surgery. Wheeled through the hospital on a gurney and pursued by security guards, Chekov is healed and rescued by the crew. In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Koenig&#39;s Chekov showcases his loyalty, faith, trust, courage, commitment, ingenuity, humor, and nerve.
We are in an enemy vessel, sir. I do not wish to be shot down on the way to our own funeral.

When a vengeful Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban), takes them captive, he reveals that the planet is Ceti Alpha V, its neighboring planet destroyed some time ago. Though Chekov and Terrell attempt to resist, Khan takes control of them through suggestion by using parasitic Ceti Eels to affect their cerebral cortexes.

Later cured of the infestation and manipulation, Chekov works with Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise to defeat Khan.

During shore leave on Space Station K-7, Chekov and Scotty (James Doohan) spend some time relaxing at a bar.

Failing to get a reaction, Korax progresses to insulting Captain Kirk. Scotty calms the young navigator but rises to the bait himself when Korax insults the Enterprise. A bar fight ensues, and Chekov throws himself into the action. Later protecting Scotty against a frustrated Kirk, Chekov shows a fun but slightly irresponsible, slightly less dignified side to his character.
