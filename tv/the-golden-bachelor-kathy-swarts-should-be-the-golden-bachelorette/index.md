## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor contestant Kathy Swarts was very memorable and entertaining on the show and should go on to be the first Golden Bachelorette.




The Golden Bachelor contestant Kathy Swarts would make an excellent lead as The Golden Bachelorette if that spinoff happens. Kathy, a retired educational consultant from Austin, Texas, was one of 22 women vying for the heart of 72-year-old Gerry Turner. Kathy, 70, left the show during week four after she was not selected as one of Gerry&#39;s final six ladies. She spoke about how hard rejection was as she was leaving but wished Gerry well and told him she hoped he found his true love. In her time on the show, Kathy made a solid connection with Gerry, but it just wasn&#39;t as strong as some of the other women.




The Golden Bachelor season 1 has been so successful among Bachelor Nation fans and those new to the franchise alike. Gerry has been an extremely likable lead, and the authenticity with which he is trying to find the woman he can&#39;t live without has been melting the hearts of Bachelor viewers. Given the show&#39;s success and trends within the Bachelor network, having a Golden Bachelorette may not be out of reach. While there is no official news on whether that spinoff will come to be, there were plenty of charismatic senior women on The Golden Bachelor who could take the spotlight, and Kathy would be an excellent choice.


 Kathy Put Theresa On Blast 

 

Kathy was at the center of the only real drama that happened among the women on The Golden Bachelor season 1. Kathy grew frustrated with Theresa Nist, who could not stop gushing about her connection with Gerry. Kathy, who felt Theresa diminished other people&#39;s romantic feelings for Gerry, told Theresa to &#34;zip it&#34; and caused Theresa to become upset. Gerry caught wind of the incident, and it soured his perception because he did not want to deal with drama or bad attitudes. Kathy&#39;s &#34;zip it&#34; gate was entertaining, and it highlighted her outspoken and bold personality as well as her desire to find love.




Kathy has since had a redemption arc with Theresa from that situation. During &#34;The Women Tell All,&#34; Kathy owned her attitude and said she learned from the experience and did not intend to come off negative. Her Tell All behavior showed that she is thoughtful and can take responsibility. Her humor and charisma were also on display as she responded to the stir she caused with Theresa.



 Kathy Would Make An Entertaining Golden Bachelorette 
         

Kathy got a lot of screen time on The Golden Bachelor season 1 and proved that she has the charismatic personality needed to become a lead figure in The Bachelor franchise. Furthermore, Kathy wants to find love and could make waves dating a bevy of senior men. The Golden Bachelorette might not be officially in the pipeline yet, but Kathy would make a great contender for the role because of how popular she was with fans, how entertaining she was on the show, and for her determination to find her person.






The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.
