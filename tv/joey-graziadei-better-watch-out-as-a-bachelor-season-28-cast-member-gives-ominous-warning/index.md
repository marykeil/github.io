## Literature Review

The Bachelor season 28 cast is ready to fall in love with Joey Graziadei, and one woman declares she isn&#39;t afraid to go after what she wants.




The Bachelor season 28&#39;s leading man Joey Graziadei has 32 women from which to choose his wife, and one of them, Maria Georgas, warns that she&#39;s not afraid to go after what she wants. Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, who currently lives in Koloa, Hawaii, got his start as the runner-up of Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season. They shared a very strong connection from the beginning of the season. After his hometown date and Fantasy Suite vernight date, Joey was heartbroken when Charity got engaged to Dotun Olubeko instead of him, but he now has a new start on his own Bachelor journey.




In handwritten notes shared by Bachelor Nation, six of Joey&#39;s Bachelor season 28 women explained why they think they&#39;re a catch. Maria Georgas, 29, wrote, &#34;I&#39;m a loyal woman. I speak my mind and not afraid to go after what I want.&#34; She added, &#34;I have a big heart and when I love you, you&#39;ll get all of me. I want to take on life with you and be your biggest supporter as long as you&#39;re good to me...Believe I&#39;ll be good to you.&#34; Sydney Gordon, 28, shared, &#34;I am happy and secure in my life. I am fully ready to love someone else because I learned to fully love myself.&#34;

Kyra Brusch, 26, shared, &#34;I&#39;m a unique individual who often ponders a lot about things.&#34; She added that she&#39;s also &#34;kind,&#34; and she wants others around her to have a good time. Kelsey Toussant, 31, wrote, &#34;I&#39;m ambitious, understanding and I always bring the good vibes.&#34;


 

The Bachelor season 28 women know what they want, and they&#39;re ready to find love with Joey. Maria&#39;s statement that she speaks her mind and isn&#39;t afraid to go after what she wants shows that she&#39;s a strong woman. It also could spell trouble for her fellow contestants if she&#39;s willing to do whatever it takes to win Joey&#39;s heart. Bachelor Nation has seen that before with women who say that they didn&#39;t go on the show to make friends. However, it&#39;s possible for the women to be confident and secure in themselves, as well as loyal to Joey, without tearing the other contestants down. It&#39;ll be intriguing to see how it all plays out.




These six Bachelor season 28 women will join 26 other contestants from all over the United States and Canada in the journey to get engaged to Joey. Some other notable contestants include Lea Cayanan, who met Joey during Charity&#39;s &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special. She was given an envelope and instructed not to open it until premiere night, so it&#39;ll be thrilling to see what&#39;s inside it. In addition, two sisters, Allison and Lauren Hollinger, will be competing for Joey&#39;s love. The Bachelor season 28 women seem like a wonderful group, and it&#39;ll be exciting to get to know them throughout the season.

The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
