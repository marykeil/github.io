## Literature Review
John is probably not ready to become a star on 90 Day: The Single Life. The show could expose some of his issues, which were overlooked the last time.




John Mcmanus is one of the stars of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, but his debut could permanently hurt his image. The 40-year-old Texas native debuted on 90 Day Fiancé season 9. He was a supporting cast member in his brother Patrick Mendes’ storyline, where he seemed like the main villain. During the past season, John intervened in Patrick’s relationship with Thaís Ramone. John sabotaged Patrick’s life and didn’t embrace Thaís as his sister-in-law. However, he eventually came to Patrick&#39;s aid. John was then a fan favorite when he shut down Jibri Bell’s disrespectful behavior during Tell All.




John made a great impression on many fans in the following months with his quirky personality and social media posts. He repaired his differences with Thaís and showed viewers he was a genuinely nice person. John’s photos with Patrick’s adorable baby daughter, Aleesi, also got a lot of love from social media users. The former supporting cast member was also liked for his commentary on 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk alongside his brother Patrick.

 John Is Accused Of Being An Alcoholic 

 

John’s debut in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 is an excellent move. However, the casting may not be as good a move for John himself. The show is known for showing the most vulnerable scenes, which can sometimes ruin a cast member’s reputation. It may do the same to John by focusing too much on his other habits. During the early phase of 90 Day Fiancé season 9, John was accused of being an alcoholic on the Reddit thread, Low_Departure_5853. If he drinks like he did before, it may not play out well for him on TV.






 John Appears To Have Emotional Problems 
          

John is a 40-year-old unmarried man, so it’s understandable why he was emotional about letting his brother go to start a new life with his partner. He appears to have some past unresolved emotional issues, which may explain his inclination toward alcohol. While fans want to see John overcome his inner demons, it may not happen so soon. John may still make many mistakes, which could hurt his image. Most people know that the internet never forgets. If John stumbles, he’ll become the laughingstock for trolls and critics online.



 John Is Already 40 Years Old With No Prospects 
          




John is single as he&#39;s aware of his shortcomings, issues, and struggles. However, 90 Day: The Single Life may portray his single life as something worse than it is. In previous seasons, many middle-aged single men have fallen victim to negative on-screen portrayals. Mike Berk from the past seasons was shown as a terrible partner, but in reality, he could be a sweet person. John could also be portrayed as a villain in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 i for the sake of entertainment.



90 Day: The Single Life premieres Monday, January 1, 2024, at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.
