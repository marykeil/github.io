## Literature Review
After more than a year since the last episode, the sci-fi dramedy Resident Alien season 3 confirms its premiere date and unveils a trailer.




Resident Alien season 3 finally reveals its premiere date and trailer after a long wait. The sci-fi dramedy, created by Chris Sheridan and based on the comic book of the same name, premiered on Syfy in 2021. The story begins by introducing “Harry Vanderspeigle” (Firefly alum Alan Tudyk), an alien sent to wipe out humanity. He takes on the identity of a physician, wrestling with the moral dilemma of his mission along the way.




Now, well over a year since its season 2 renewal, star Sara Tomko has shared the Resident Alien  season 3 trailer on Instagram. Tomko, who plays Asta Twelvetrees, also revealed in the caption that the show will return to Syfy on February 14.


 

The two-minute trailer gives special focus to the Greys, as voiced by Star Trek legend George Takei, and the threat they pose to the central town of Patience, Colorado. The preview also focuses on returning guests like Terminator&#39;s Linda Hamilton and Agent Carter alum Enver Gjokaj.


 What To Know About Resident Alien Season 3 
          




A big change heading into the show&#39;s return will be the reduced episode count. Resident Alien season 3 will consist of eight episodes. That&#39;s less than previous seasons, which had ten and sixteen episodes, respectively. The third installment was originally meant to have twelve episodes, but that was cut down in November 2022. Still, despite the reduction, there&#39;s a lot to follow up on.

The ending of Resident Alien season 2, which aired in September 2022, involved Harry and General McCallister (Hamilton) putting aside their differences to work together and deal with the much more pressing threat of the Greys&#39; invasion. That&#39;s underlined as a major focus in the new trailer, alongside the fact that Harry still has a lot to learn.

                  Where Is Resident Alien Filmed?   Here’s what we know about the filming location of sci-fi series Resident Alien, which takes place in the fictional town of Patience, Colorado.    

&#34;Joseph Rainier&#34; (Gjokaj), the Grey hybrid alien, has positioned himself deeper into the town as a deputy to keep an eye on Harry. Although the season 2 finale plays up Rainer&#39;s humorous dynamic with Harry, Gjokaj&#39;s character has a dangerous streak that looms in the latest preview for the Syfy series. Alongside an overall focus on the residence of Patience, Resident Alien season 3 is poised to have an eventful return on Valentine&#39;s Day.
