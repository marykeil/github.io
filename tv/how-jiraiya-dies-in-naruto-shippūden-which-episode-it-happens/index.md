Summary

  Jiraiya&#39;s death in Naruto: Shippūden was a heartbreaking moment, leaving a lasting impact on the series.   Jiraiya was a crucial mentor to Naruto, teaching him important skills and shaping him into a powerful ninja.   Despite the possibility of Jiraiya reappearing in Boruto, his death remains a significant turning point in Naruto&#39;s evolution.  







Jiraiya&#39;s death in Naruto: Shippūden was one of the most shocking moments, with the episode it happened in being a major series highlight. Alongside Jiraiya&#39;s former teammates Lady Tsunade and Orochimaru, Jiraiya was one of the &#34;Legendary Great Three Students of the God Shinobi.&#34; Unfortunately, Jiraiya is also one of the few Naruto characters to die and not be fully resurrected, making his death sting all the more.

Also known as the Toad Sage (thanks to his toad summoning abilities) and the Pervy Sage (thanks to his peeping tom tendencies), Jiraiya made his debut in the first season of the Naruto anime series and soon took the titular character under his wing. He played a huge part in molding the anime’s hero into a powerful ninja and was the first of Naruto’s mentors to attempt to teach him how to control his Nine-Tails power.

          




Jiraiya also taught Naruto how to summon animals and helped him master the Rasengan technique which would become one of Naruto’s signature attacks. Unfortunately, Jiraiya and Naruto&#39;s happy days together were doomed to end in tragedy. 

                  One Piece Is The Secret Reason Behind Naruto&#39;s Most Heartbreaking Moments   Naruto&#39;s author expressed how One Piece&#39;s writing helped shape the series&#39; more emotional moments, showing how each series improved the other.    


 Jiraiya Dies in Episode 133 of Naruto Shippuden 

 

The sixth season of the anime saw Jiraiya depart Konoha for Amegakure (aka the Rain Village) on a mission to infiltrate the village and investigate the whereabouts of Akatsuki&#39;s leader Pain. Jiraiya soon comes face-to-face with Pain and learns the Akatsuki leader is none other than his former mentee Nagato who – like Naruto – he took under his wing and trained.




          

Jiraiya and Nagato&#39;s reunion was not a happy one and the two engaged in a battle that resulted in Jiraiya’s death in Naruto: Shippūden episode 133, “The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant.” As Jiraiya and Akatsuki leader Nagato fought each other, the latter unleashed his Six Paths of Pain which proved too much even for an accomplished ninja like Jiraiya to overcome. Still, that didn&#39;t stop the mentor from putting up one of the best fights in the Naruto Shippuden series. 

          

Nagato’s Six Paths of Pain severed Jiraiya’s arm and crushed his throat before impaling him in the back multiple times with a volley of black chakra rods. In the moments before he died, Jiraiya used the last reserves of his energy to write a coded message on his toad friend Fukasaku’s back that would provide Naruto with clues as to Pain’s real identity. A version of Jiraiya would make his way back to the series, but not in the way fans had hoped.






 Jiraiya Made His Return in Episode 132 of Boruto 
          

Although Jiraiya wasn’t resurrected during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Jiraiya does reappear in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations episode 132, &#34;Jiraiya&#39;s Assignment,&#34; in which Boruto and Sasuke go back in time. Aiming to better sync his chakra with Naruto&#39;s, Boruto meets a Genin Naruto training in the past with Jiraiya. In one of the anime&#39;s most entertaining filler arcs, the young ninja team up with the Toad Sage to battle the mischievious Urashiki Otsutsuki.

Furthermore, it&#39;s also revealed that Kashin Koji, a member of Isshiki Otsutsuki&#39;s deadly Kara organization, is a clone of Jiraiya in Boruto episode 214, &#34;Predestined Fate.&#34; Created by Amado to infiltrate the evil Kara faction and take down Isshiki, Kashin Koji continues to play a key role in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. While Kashin Koji cannot hope to match Jiraiya&#39;s charisma, he does succeed at keeping Jiraiya&#39;s legacy alive through his similar array of ninjutsu.




                  Boruto&#39;s Real Teacher During The Time Skip Explains Why He&#39;s So Powerful Now   Boruto’s return to Konoha has shown him to be a much-improved shinobi, and this is due to his work under his father’s trainer - well sort of.    



 Is Jiraiya Coming Back In Boruto? 
          

Jiraiya&#39;s death in Naruto: Shippūden was crucial, allowing Naruto to grow into the independent ninja he came to be, but this doesn&#39;t rule out another Jiraiya reappearance in Boruto. During Boruto&#39;s Time Slip Arc, it&#39;s implied that Jiraiya knows that Sasuke and Boruto are from the future and is aware of their true intentions, which means there&#39;s a chance that Jiraiya could somehow travel to Boruto&#39;s timeline.

While it&#39;s pretty clear that Kashin Koji is not actually Jiraiya, the clone&#39;s continuing story could eventually answer certain key questions about Jiraiya in Naruto: Shippūden. From a narrative standpoint, the finality of Jiraiya&#39;s death is a crucial turning point in Naruto&#39;s evolution, which means that it&#39;s highly unlikely that Jiraiya will somehow be reanimated or resurrected in Boruto.






 Jiraiya Was One of Naruto&#39;s Most Important Characters 
          

Though he is almost assuredly gone for good, Jiraiya still left a lasting legacy on Naruto. His greatest legacy is, naturally, Naruto himself. Jiraiya not only trained Naruto, but also Naruto&#39;s father Minato, inspiring the Fourth Hokage to name his future son after the hero of Jiraiya&#39;s book. This plays perfectly into Jiraiya&#39;s character as, ironically given his own bombast, he&#39;s always been a supporting character. He&#39;s the great point of connection between plenty of disparate characters such as his fellow Sanin, Konoha&#39;s new generation of ninja, and their greatest threat in the Akatsuki. These connections to others all add up to making Jiraiya a pivotal character, with his death in Naruto: Shippuden episode 133 being a heartbreaking but fitting end.
