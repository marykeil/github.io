Summary

  Aaron Korsh and NBCUniversal are developing a new spinoff show set in the world of Suits, but it won&#39;t be a reboot or revival.   The Suits spinoff will be set in a Los Angeles law firm and will follow a character named Erica who works in entertainment law.   It is unclear if any of the original Suits characters will appear.  





Aaron Korsh and NBCUniversal are working on a new Suits show, and while very little has been revealed so far the anticipation around returning to the world of Harvey, Donna, and Mike is palpable (even if they themselves may not be in it). The 2011-2019 drama Suits focused on ultra-slick litigator Harvey Specter and his college dropout mentor with a photographic memory Mike Ross. Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams led the cast of the show. While it was successful in its day, Suits began making waves again when it arrived on Netflix in 2023.




Somehow the Aaron Korsh show defied all expectations (even his) and became the most-watched show in the platform&#39;s history, overtaking 2022’s Wednesday and Netflix powerhouse Stranger Things. This momentum naturally led to intrigue and questions about the future of Suits and whether it will return. Sure enough, it was confirmed later the same year that Aaron Korsh and NBCUniversal were developing a new spinoff set in the world of Suits.

While many things are still being kept under wraps, the most recent update sees the Suits spinoff name its first character as well as nail down a few details about the show&#39;s plot. It has been confirmed that the new spinoff will be separate from the original series and will follow entertainment lawyer Erica who works at a high-powered firm in Los Angeles. The character is described in reports as &#34;30s, Black, SoCal native, and Harvard law alum. She’s jockeying to be made Head of Entertainment. She’s great at closing clients but struggles elsewhere. Smarter than everyone.&#34; 




The newly announced Erica character is already being compared to Megan Markle&#39;s Rachel Zane who appeared in the original series, but there will likely be more distinctions as the series takes shape. The role of Erica has not been cast yet, nor has any other character or cast member been announced thus far.

Aaron Korsh’s new Suits spinoff was confirmed in October 2023 (via Deadline). As per the report the project was in very early stages of development when it was revealed, with Korsh and NBCUniversal still in the process of negotiating deals. More details have been revealed since, including the new setting of Los Angeles.

The new Suits show has been billed as a new story in the world of Suits. Aaron Korsh has been clear that it’s not a reboot, nor is it the long-awaited Suits revival. Since it’s not a revival it means it’s unlikely that the core cast will be made up of returning Suits alumni. With the show being set in Los Angeles and following entertainment lawyers, there is likely to be little crossover with the existing Suits characters. 

However, since it’s also not being branded as a reboot, that means everything that happened in Suits is still canon, and Donna, Mike, and Harvey still exist in the world of the new show. This means they may appear or even be central cast members (which would make sense from NBCUniversal’s perspective, given that the success of Suits on Netlix is almost definitely why the new show is being optioned). The only known character so far is Erica, a young entertainment lawyer with big ambitions, but she hasn&#39;t been cast yet.

When the show was first announced, nothing was revealed about the plot, and it was mostly shrouded in mystery. However, it has now been revealed that the Suits spinoff will be set in the same universe as the original series but will take place at an entertainment law firm in Los Angeles. The character of Erica has already been announced, but it is unclear if she will be the lead or merely supporting. 

Erica has been introduced as a thirty-something Black woman who works at the unnamed law firm but has big dreams of becoming the head of the firm&#39;s entertainment division. She may follow a similar trajectory as the characters of the original series and climb up through the ranks using her brilliant legal mind. Though all is not known about the Suits spinoff, it clearly won&#39;t be a rehash of the original.
