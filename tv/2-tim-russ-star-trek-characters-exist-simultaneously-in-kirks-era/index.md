# 2 Tim Russ Star Trek Characters Exist Simultaneously In Kirks Era


## SUMMARY 



Tim Russ has played multiple characters in the Star Trek universe, including Lt. Commander Tuvok in Voyager.   

Tuvok served in Starfleet during the same time as Tim Russ&#39;s unnamed Enterprise Lieutenant character, suggesting that they co-existed in Star Trek&#39;s 23rd century and may have crossed paths.   

There are possibilities for Tim Russ to return as Tuvok in future Star Trek projects, such as Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 and a potential series called Star Trek: Legacy.

## Literature Review
Best known as Tuvok, Voyager&#39;s Tim Russ played two Star Trek characters who co-existed in the latter years of Captain Kirk&#39;s Starfleet career.




Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Tim Russ plays two characters that co-exist in the era of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner). Best known for playing Lt. Commander Tuvok in Voyager, Tim Russ had previously come to the attention of the Star Trek team with guest roles in both Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. Russ recently reprized the role of Tuvok in Star Trek: Picard season 3, promoting Commander Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) to the position of captain of the USS Enterprise-G.




Of the five Star Trek characters played by Tim Russ, many of them co-exist in the same time period. For example, the two criminal characters, Devor in Star Trek: The Next Generation and T&#39;Kar in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine co-existed in the 24th century. That was until Devor was killed by a Baryon sweep while aiding the attempted theft of the USS Enterprise-D. More interesting is that Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Tuvok saw active duty during the TOS era, alongside another Starfleet officer also played by Tim Russ.

Tuvok&#39;s Voyager &amp; Star Trek History Explained   Tuvok&#39;s Starfleet career goes beyond the USS Voyager, and here&#39;s his Star Trek timeline from the USS Excelsior to Star Trek: Picard&#39;s 25th Century.    


 Tim Russ Has 2 Star Trek Characters During Kirkâ€™s Era 
    

Tim Russ briefly appeared as an unnamed Lieutenant aboard the USS Enterprise-B in another pre-Star Trek: Voyager role. Star Trek Generations opens with the first flight of the USS Enterprise-B, which ultimately results in the apparent death of Captain James T. Kirk. Generations is set in the year 2293, the same year as Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, which saw the USS Enterprise-A complete its final mission, with the help of the USS Excelsior and Captain Hiraku Sulu (George Takei). Two years after Tim Russ briefly appeared in Generations, Star Trek: Voyager revealed that Tuvok served aboard the USS Excelsior during the events of Star Trek 6.




In the Star Trek: Voyager episode &#34;Flashback&#34;, a mind meld allowed Tuvok and Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to visit the Vulcan&#39;s memories of his time aboard the USS Excelsior. The revelation that Tuvok was a serving Starfleet officer in the same year as Tim Russ&#39; unnamed Enterprise Lieutenant means that both characters co-existed in Star Trek&#39;s 23rd century, and may even have crossed paths. Tim Russ isn&#39;t the only Voyager actor to have played two characters that co-exist in the same time period. Robert Duncan McNeill&#39;s two Star Trek characters, Lt. Tom Paris and Nick Locarno also co-exist in the 24th century.



 Will Tim Russ Return To Star Trek As Tuvok? 
          

Following his cameo in Star Trek: Picard season 3, Tim Russ could return to Star Trek as Tuvok in multiple areas of the franchise. The most obvious place for Tuvok to return in the near future is Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 when it drops on Netflix later in 2024. Prodigy season 2 will focus on Admiral Janeway leading a rescue mission aboard the USS Voyager-A, aided by Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray) and the rest of her young charges. As he is Janeway&#39;s most trusted friend, she may find herself turning to Tuvok for advice during her journey into the unknown territory of the 25th century.




Tuvok made a brief, non-speaking appearance in Star Trek: Lower Decks season 3, and so could make a more substantial appearance in a future episode of Mike McMahan&#39;s animated Star Trek comedy. In terms of live-action Star Trek, there&#39;s no obvious place for Tim Russ&#39; Tuvok to appear in the current crop of shows on Paramount&#43;. The dream scenario would be Tim Russ returning as Tuvok opposite Jeri Ryan&#39;s Captain Seven of Nine in Star Trek: Legacy. There is still no official announcement about Terry Matalas&#39; proposed series, but Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Tuvok would surely be a shoo-in for a guest appearance or recurring role should Legacy get commissioned.



Star Trek Generations is currently streaming on Max.


All episodes of Star Trek: Voyager are streaming on Paramount&#43;.
