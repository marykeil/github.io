# The Alien Franchises Timeline Just Got A Whole Lot More Complicated


## SUMMARY 



  The Alien franchise&#39;s timeline has been quite complicated and inconsistent for a while now.   FX&#39;s Alien TV show will seemingly ignore the events of Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, aiming to bring the series back to its original tone and aesthetics.   The upcoming Alien TV show and the new movie, Alien: Romulus, will likely include retcons and inconsistencies in the timeline due to the complex nature of the franchise&#39;s expanded universe and previous films.

## Literature Review

The Alien movie franchise was never known for having a consistent timeline, but the saga’s chronology has just become even more complicated.




Consisting of multiple movies, comic books, video games, and more, the Alien franchise’s timeline is about to get way more complicated. Compared to how simple yet engaging Ridley Scott’s Alien was in 1979, it is curious to see how convoluted the saga has become. Combining it with Predator through Predator 2 and the Alien vs. Predator films certainly did not make things easier, especially because the crossover films established both creatures as ancient species. More recently, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, both of which were directed by Scott, rewrote the saga’s lore.




Now, the Alien movie timeline, or at least the franchise’s canon, is about to be reworked again. Although a sequel to Covenant never happened, Alien now seems stronger than ever with two exciting projects coming up. One of them is FX’s Alien TV show, which will mark the saga’s television debut after reports of a shelved anime Alien vs. Predator series. Alien going to TV is great news on its own, and while not much is known about the story, some clues have been offered as to when the series will take place and what it will explore.


 FX’s Alien TV Show Is Ignoring Prometheus &amp; Covenant 
         

When discussing his upcoming Alien TV show for KCRW’s The Business podcast, showrunner Noah Hawley addressed whether Ridley Scott’s Alien prequels would inform his story in any way. Hawley pointed out he is not interested in the idea of the Xenomorph being a “bioweapon created half an hour ago,” a reference to how Prometheus and Covenant suggested David was the creator of the titular Alien. Hawley also discussed how he wants to bring the franchise back to its roots in terms of aesthetics, namely regarding the technology of the world of Alien.




Whereas Alien (1979) and its immediate sequels featured a “cassette futurism,” a style of retrofuturism that has been lost over the years, Prometheus went for a more sterile look for the ships. Scott’s Alien prequels also featured some very futuristic tech that seemed far more advanced than anything in the original films, which made the Alien timeline seem even more inconsistent. Therefore, in terms of visuals and story, it seems like Disney’s Alien series will ignore the decisions made for Prometheus and Covenant, instead shifting the saga back to its original tone.



 The Alien TV Show Is Seemingly A Prequel (Like Prometheus Was) 
          

Where the Alien TV show fits into the movie’s timeline remains to be confirmed. However, the series is expected to take place on Earth in the distant future, which, in the case of the Alien franchise, means it could be a prequel. The first Alien movie was set in 2122, meaning anything between 2024 and that year could be the “distant future” while also being a prequel to Ripley’s story. Exploring which events on Earth led to the rise of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation and the story of the original Alien movies is interesting. Still, it is bound to create canon inconsistencies with Prometheus and Covenant.




 Movie  Year It Is Set   Prometheus  2089-2093   Alien: Covenant  2104   Alien  2122   Aliens  2179   



Most of Prometheus takes place in 2093, whereas Covenant begins and ends in 2104. Both films are set in the distant future and act as prequels to Alien, meaning the upcoming show could very well be set relatively close to the events of Prometheus and Covenant. Although most of Scott’s Alien prequels do not take place on Earth, they heavily discuss the plans of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation and how it all ties to the discovery of the Xenomorph by the crew of the Nostromo in the 1979 film. As such, Alien may soon have two contradictory &#34;origin stories.&#34;



 Alien Can’t Ignore Ridley Scott’s Prequels Without Creating Some Retcons 
          




Trying to make sense of the Alien timeline can be very complicated, especially when considering Predator 2, the Alien vs. Predator films, and the expanded universe that comes from other media like games and comic books. Therefore, which events are or are not “canon” most likely comes down to what story the creators behind a new movie or TV show want to tell – which can be a great approach. That said, it may be impossible for the Alien TV show to move away from the prequel films without retconning and even contradicting them.



Not only was the story of David and the birth of the Xenomorph species way too convoluted, but the box office numbers would not justify the franchise limiting itself to that story.




The easiest way for either FX’s Alien series or any new entries in the saga to tell their own story without worrying too much about the timeline is to avoid direct references to the events of movies like Alien vs. Predator or Prometheus. However, some storylines are too big to never be addressed. For example, the arrangements for the Prometheus mission began in 2089, whereas David disappeared with countless potential new Xenomorphs in 2104. If the upcoming show’s timeline ever intersects with that of the prequel films, retcons will likely happen.






 The New Alien Movie Could Make Things Even More Complicated 
          

Disney currently has two major Alien projects that should reignite the franchise and introduce the saga to a new generation. In addition to the TV show, Alien is getting a new movie, Fede Álvarez’s Alien: Romulus. The movie, which is also expected to bring the franchise back to its roots given the director’s horror background, is reportedly set between Alien and Aliens – when Ripley was in hypersleep and the Company had yet to learn more about what happened in LV-426. Therefore, Romulus will be set at least a few decades after Covenant.

                  10 Most Exciting Things To Expect From Disney&#39;s Alien Movie   Alien: Romulus brings back the sci-fi horror franchise for the first time in years, but that&#39;s not all that makes Disney&#39;s Alien reboot exciting.   




Prometheus and Covenant were once supposed to be the definitive prequels to Alien, meaning they would be “more canon” than Alien vs. Predator. Still, considering neither of them was a massive box office hit and a third movie never happened, it makes sense for Alien to move on from the Engineers, David, and everything else established in the 2010s films. Not only was the story of David and the birth of the Xenomorph species way too convoluted, but the box office numbers would not justify the franchise limiting itself to that story.

Both Noah Hawley’s Alien series and Fede Álvarez’s Alien: Romulus can be perfect starting points for new audiences, combining modern storytelling and VFX with the tone and aesthetic of the original films. However, these upcoming projects will certainly run into retcons and inconsistencies, not only because of Prometheus and Covenant but also because of how complicated everything gets after Cameron’s Aliens. From clones and hybrids to important stories told in other media, Alien has grown too big to have a consistent chronology. Therefore, the best approach may be to tell great stories within that universe regardless of retcons and inconsistencies.
