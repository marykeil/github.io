## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Angela Deem might have some good news to share with fans about her relationship with Michael Ilesanmi, according to her new video.




90 Day: The Last Resort star Michael Ilesanmi might have finally made it to the U.S. if a new video posted by Angela Deem is to be believed. Michael is a 34-year-old Nigerian man who first starred in 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days season 2. He had approached Angela, 57, on Facebook, and the couple soon began a long-distance relationship. Michael and Angela&#39;s age gap of 22 years created most of the issues in their relationship. She was unable to give him a baby, and Michael cheated on Angela with younger women. Angela and Michael did get married, but she had her divorce papers ready during 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1.




However, Angela decided to give their marriage another chance on the reality TV spin-off. Angela, who told Michael, &#34;If you truly love me, make it work because you know I don’t like lying,” posted an Instagram video showing her and Michael together.


 

Angela and Michael got married in January 2020, but Michael had been waiting for his visa in Nigeria. Angela&#39;s video with Michael has her lip-syncing to the audio, &#34;I want to kiss you so hard that you will never get the taste of me out of your mouth.&#34; Angela proceeds to kiss Michael sweetly on the lips afterwards. She captioned the video, &#34;#ANGELA&amp;MICHAEL4EVA.&#34; Angela&#39;s followers were shocked upon seeing the couple together.

 Why 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Michael Ilesanmi Could Still Be In Nigeria 
          

&#34;Omg is he here??&#34; asked a fan in the comments section. &#34;He&#39;s been in the US for a while now,&#34; added someone else. &#34;She bring[s] him to America hope he appreciate[s] that,&#34; posted another fan. However, one fan observed that Angela had probably filmed the video in a hotel room. Angela has shown her home in her Instagram updates from time to time, and it doesn&#39;t resemble the place where she is with Michael in the clip. Angela appears to have gone to Lagos to spend time with Michael. The last time that Angela flew there, it was documented for 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? season 7.

Angela had discovered that Michael had been operating an Instagram page. He refused to take it down despite Angela&#39;s many requests. She had gone to Nigeria without letting him know. She angrily wrecked his car to teach him a lesson. The couple eventually made up when Michael promised Angela he would delete the page. What Angela didn&#39;t know was that Michael had been chatting with a 30-year-old American woman and even making plans to leave Angela for her once he moved there. Angela decided to forgive Michael for his mistake on 90 Day: The Last Resort. The couple&#39;s therapy sessions they received at the Florida Keys Resort have certainly worked for them.




While Michael might not be in the U.S. yet, Angela is making an effort to see him regularly in his country until his visa gets approved. It remains to be seen what Angela does if Michael doesn&#39;t get his visa at all. She is not interested in moving to Nigeria. She&#39;s used to her American lifestyle and would much rather have Michael making sacrifices. Angela and Michael&#39;s next stint after 90 Day: The Last Resort is not yet known, but given the interest in their relationship, one could assume they&#39;ll be back very soon on reality TV.
