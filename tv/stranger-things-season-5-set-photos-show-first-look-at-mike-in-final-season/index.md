## Literature Review

Stranger Things season 5 set photos show the first look at Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) and his new haircut in the final episodes of Netflix&#39;s hit.




New set photos for Stranger Things season 5 show the first look at Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard). Season 5 will be the last for the hit Netflix sci-fi series from the Duffer brothers. The highly anticipated episodes faced delays due to the Hollywood labor strikes, meaning filming has only just begun. As a result, Stranger Things isn&#39;t expected to return until 2025. While specifics of the final season&#39;s plot are being kept tightly under wraps, set photos can provide some clues.




On X, formerly Twitter, the fan-run account Stranger Things Spoilers shared photos from the Stranger Things season 5 set, giving users their first look at Mike. Additionally, Gaten Matarazzo was spotted on set in the same costume he wore in previous images. Check out the photos below:


 

Mike appears to have gotten a haircut in the newest season, with a style that resembles his season 1 look. His hair is noticeably shorter from how it was in the show&#39;s most recent episodes.


 

Meanwhile, Dustin appears to be at Hawkins High School after last being spotted on set visiting Eddie Munson&#39;s (Joseph Quinn) vandalized grave.





 What The Stranger Things Season 5 Set Photos Reveal 
          

The first look at Mike in Stranger Things season 5 doesn&#39;t hold too many hints for the episodes, aside from confirming a slightly new look for the character. Still, Mike&#39;s updated look could be significant due to rumors that the season will feature a two-year time jump, and subtle changes in appearance would be expected with such a jump. Also, his haircut and clothes both resemble his appearance in season 1. This potential callback to season 1 is interesting, as there are additional theories about the season going back in time.

Previous Stranger Things season 5 set photos also held a potential clue for the two-year time jump as, in one photo, a 1988 edition of a book can be spotted. Since season 4 takes place in 1986, the book could hint at a time jump of at least two years. There have also been glimpses of a seemingly new control room on set, plus images of Dustin visiting Eddie&#39;s grave and the school in his Hellfire T-shirt. Hence, there is speculation that Dustin is still struggling to get justice for Eddie, who was wrongfully accused of murder before his death.




                  Eddie&#39;s Stranger Things Death, Explained   Eddie Munson is one of the most beloved characters in season 4 of Stranger Things, and his death scene is as important to the show as it is emotional.   

Seeing Dustin at the gravesite and school, or Mike out and about with a fresh haircut, also seems to hint at the gang at least keeping up the appearance of some normalcy. Despite Stranger Things season 4 ending with the Upside Down leaking into Hawkins, the photos could suggest that the threat of Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) isn&#39;t immediate, allowing the gang time to prepare and for their small town to recover slightly. However, it will take some further set photos, clues, and plot updates to determine what the group is truly up to in Hawkins in Stranger Things season 5.
