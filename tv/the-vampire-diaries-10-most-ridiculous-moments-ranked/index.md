## Literature Review
Over the course of The Vampire Diaries’s eight seasons and 171 episodes, there were a handful of comical moments that did not make much sense.




Given that The Vampire Diaries was a supernatural teen drama television series on The CW, it should come as no surprise that it had its fair share of ridiculous moments. The show dealt with vampires, werewolves, hybrids, witches, hunters, and many other mystical creatures, after all. However, the series was also fueled by drama that was often like the conflict one would find in a soap opera, which would lead to numerous comical moments over the course of the show&#39;s eight seasons.
The Vampire Diaries cast included Nina Dobrev as Elena Gilbert, Paul Wesley as Stefan Salvatore, Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore, and many others, but, on the outside looking in, the three of them were at the center of the story. Of course, the show did not constantly revolve around the soap opera-like love triangle between the three characters, and other ridiculous moments often broke through the fold. At the end of the day, the audience had no choice but to laugh at these scenes and plot lines.









 








 10  Damon &amp; Stefan Lowered A Dead Body Out Of A Window 
        

Damon and Stefan had to get rid of many bodies throughout the eight seasons of The Vampire Diaries, and lucky for them, their job was made easier one Halloween. Since they could not get it out the front door, the brothers decided to lower a dead body out of a window to dispose of it. They were able to get away with doing this in bright daylight because of the spooky holiday.
One person walked by and commented on how real the dead body looked, thinking it was a decoration. Hopefully, someone would not be this gullible in real life. But because The Vampire Diaries is a fictional show, Damon and Stefan&#39;s ridiculous moment didn&#39;t get them caught.

 9  Sheriff Forbes Shot &amp; Killed Jeremy 
        

Jeremy Gilbert wasn&#39;t the worst Vampire Diaries character or anything, but he just so happened to be at the center of many of the ridiculous moments on this list. However, for this one in particular, the absurdity of this scene wasn&#39;t his fault. In The Vampire Diaries season 2, episode 22, Sheriff Forbes intended to shoot and kill Damon, but the vampire moved out of the way, so the bullet hit Jeremy on accident. Jeremy was wearing the Gilbert Ring, but because Sheriff Forbes was human, it wouldn&#39;t work to save him. Thankfully, Bonnie Bennett was able to use her powers to resurrect Jeremy.





 8  Jeremy Revealed His Hunter&#39;s Mark 
        

The suddenness and drama of the moment made it hilarious to watch, even though that likely was not the intention. 

Okay, now this Vampire Diaries ridiculous moment was entirely Jeremy&#39;s fault. Jeremy joined the supernatural club when he became a hunter and a member of The Five, a group of five supernaturally gifted vampire hunters. Since Jeremy was one of The Five, a Hunter&#39;s Mark appeared on his body in one episode, and instead of subtly revealing his new tattoo, Jeremy abruptly yelled and ripped off his shirt. The suddenness and drama of the moment made it hilarious to watch, even though that likely was not the intention.





 7  Stefan Told Caroline They Would Never Be Together 
        

Caroline Forbes immediately had her eyes on Stefan when he came to Mystic Falls in The Vampire Diaries season 1. However, unfortunately for her, Stefan quickly fell in love with Caroline&#39;s best friend, Elena. Caroline openly flirted with Stefan, which led to him telling her that they would never be a couple. Flash forward to six seasons later, and the two were best friends who were slowly falling in love with one another. The Vampire Diaries ended with Stefan and Caroline getting married (before his tragic death), so it&#39;s funny to look back at one of their first interactions, and Stefan couldn&#39;t have been more wrong.





 6  Kai Sang Karaoke In The Vampire Diaries Season 8 
        

Kai was undoubtedly one of The Vampire Diaries&#39;s best villains, partly due to his charming and sarcastic demeanor (but also because he was ruthless and viewers loved to hate him and hated to love him). One of Kai&#39;s best moments came in season 8 when he sang &#34;Knockin&#39; On Heaven&#39;s Door&#34; at a karaoke bar, which is where Stefan found him. Chris Wood, who played Kai, is a singer, so he sounded good. But given that it was Kai and not Wood, the villain&#39;s rendition got a bit ridiculous (and hilarious) toward the end of the song.  : 7 Main Vampire Diaries Characters Who Left The Show Early (&amp; Why)





 5  Jeremy Planned To Kill Damon 
        

Yet again, Jeremy was at the center of one of The Vampire Diaries&#39;s most ridiculous moments. In season 2, Jeremy was (understandably) furious at Damon for snapping his neck, so he went to the Salvatore Boarding House with the intention of killing him. However, he had a change of heart and decided to abandon his ridiculous plan, which was probably for the best since it would have been embarrassing to watch Jeremy try to stake Damon.





 4  Caroline &amp; Damon&#39;s Relationship In Season 1 
        

One of the most cringe-worthy and horrific plot lines in The Vampire Diaries was when Damon compelled Caroline to be with him romantically in season 1. Firstly, Damon did not have Caroline&#39;s consent, which made the situation very icky, and he used her to feed. While she was not being compelled by him, Caroline made it obvious that she was not okay with the situation. However, Damon was the villain, and he didn&#39;t care. The two later became friends and put the past behind them, but it&#39;s difficult not to look back on Damon and Caroline&#39;s season 1 relationship and not be disgusted.





 3  Jeremy Kissed Anna&#39;s Ghost 
        

Jeremy and Anna dated in The Vampire Diaries season 1, but Jeremy&#39;s uncle, John Gilbert, staked and killed Anna in the finale. However, at the end of season 2, Anna returned as a ghost and frequently visited Jeremy in season 3. Although he was in a relationship with Bonnie at the time and Anna was technically dead, Jeremy and Anna kissed. The reunion between the two was short-lived since she was a ghost, but the kiss will always be one of the show&#39;s most ridiculous moments.





 2  Caroline Got Pregnant With Alaric &amp; Jo&#39;s Twins 
        

After Jo Laughlin died (while pregnant with twins) in The Vampire Diaries season 6, Jo&#39;s coven transferred her and Alaric Saltzman&#39;s two daughters to Caroline Forbes so that they could survive. As a result, Caroline had to carry out the rest of Jo&#39;s pregnancy, and she later became a mother figure to Josie and Lizzie Saltzman. The storyline was created to cover up Candice Accola&#39;s real-life pregnancy, but it was bizarre, nonetheless.  : 10 The Vampire Diaries Moments That Still Make Fans Cry





 1  Matt Survived The Vampire Diaries 
        

Let&#39;s be honest — the most ridiculous moment throughout all eight seasons of The Vampire Diaries was when Matt Donovan managed to survive. He was the only main character who remained human throughout the supernatural teen drama&#39;s 171 episodes, which should have made him more vulnerable (regarding his living status) than anyone else. Of course, just like the other characters, Matt died quite a few times, but he was always brought back to life via the Gilbert Ring or thanks to Bonnie. And by the time The Vampire Diaries came to an end, Matt was (shockingly) one of the few left standing.
