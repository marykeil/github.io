# Succession Revival Chances Addressed By HBO Exec


## SUMMARY 



  Succession&#39;s future relies on creator Jesse Armstrong; the show ended after 4 seasons because it reached its &#34;natural&#34; conclusion.   HBO executive Casey Bloys believes any kind of Succession revival is unlikely at this point, and it will only happen if Armstrong gets the &#34;greatest idea.&#34;   Bloys wants Armstrong to take a break and not rush into anything, though he seems interested in working with the Succession creator again.

## Literature Review

HBO executive Casey Bloys addresses the chances of a Succession revival just six months after the series came to a highly acclaimed conclusion.




HBO executive Casey Bloys addresses the chances of a Succession revival. After four successful seasons, the HBO drama concluded its run in May 2023 with an ending that was met with widespread acclaim. The Succession series finale sees the completion of the GoJo sale to Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård), with Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) becoming CEO of Waystar as the Roy siblings – Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Roman (Kieran Culkin), and Shiv (Sarah Snook) – end up on the outside looking in.




Now, just six months after the series finale, Bloys addressed the chances of a Succession revival. Talking to Variety after the 75th Emmys, where the show won a whopping six awards, the HBO boss said &#34;the chances of that are pretty unlikely&#34; unless creator Jesse Armstrong gets the &#34;greatest idea.&#34; Bloys went on to address what Armstrong, who has a deal at HBO, is going to do next. Read his full comments below:


The chances of that are pretty unlikely. Unless Jesse all of a sudden said, &#34;Oh my God, I have the greatest idea. This is what I want to do.&#34; I would take that very seriously. But I think that he told the story he wanted to tell. It doesn’t seem to be something that he wants to visit again, and I totally get that. I’m excited with what he’s going to do next.
He doesn’t have an idea. I think it’s going to take some time. A little bit of downtime, maybe, take a break, read. Not think about TV for a little while, which is just fine with me. After doing this show for four seasons and doing it at the level he’s done, I would encourage him to take a little break and think about things. I don’t think it’s a good idea to rush right into something. What I want to do with him is the next thing that he can’t shake.

 Why There Won&#39;t Be A Succession Revival 
The Ending Was Perfect
          

Bloys makes it clear that the future of Succession, whether it be a revival or spinoff, is in the hands of its creator, Armstrong. It was his conscious decision to end Succession after 4 seasons, arguing it was the &#34;natural&#34; conclusion to the story. As indicated by its title, the show&#39;s impetus was the conflict concerning the succession of Waystar CEO Logan Roy (Brian Cox), and once his permanent successor was crowned during the series finale, it was fundamentally the end of the story.

Succession is one of the rare shows that ended at its peak and left audiences wanting more. In turn, its finale was praised as one of the greatest in the history of television. Reviving the show would risk undoing its impeccable legacy, or worse, risk joining the long and regrettable list of shows that dragged on past their prime. Succession&#39;s ending was perfect, and for now, Armstrong nor anyone else should feel the need for a revival.






Succession seasons 1-4 are streaming on Max.
