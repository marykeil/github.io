## Literature Review

Exclusive: Mari Yamamoto, who plays scientist Keiko in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, details a key difference between the show&#39;s two timelines.




Monarch: Legacy of Monsters actress Mari Yamamoto - who plays scientist Keiko in the series - revealed in a recent interview that reflecting on the show&#39;s dual timelines made one key detail stand out to her. The Apple TV&#43; show just wrapped up its first season earlier this month, ending with a cliffhanger on Skull Island. The series expands on the lore established in the MonsterVerse movies, providing more of a backstory regarding the discovery of Titans, the creation of Monarch, and G-Day&#39;s impact on society.




There are several time periods that the show switches back and forth between, particularly the 1950s and the 2010s, which means that there are essentially two groups within the cast that don&#39;t really get to interact with one another. These distinct groups led to a big difference between the two timelines that Mari Yamamoto commented on in a recent Screen Rant interview about Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. Check out the full quote below:


Mari Yamamoto: The funny thing I realized was that I hadn&#39;t interacted with a woman in my timeline. I went on set and it&#39;s just this feminine energy of Anna and Kiersey, like, busting out in song after each take, and just giggling. It’s this, like, light, fun atmosphere. I&#39;m like, “This is a completely different show.”
We’ve been in parallel universes, basically. I have to go back and check, but I think it&#39;s true because I had this realization of, “Oh, I have been missing this feminine energy,” because it&#39;s just been military and the trio. As much as I love Anders and Wyatt—they were so much fun—you realize that you had been missing it when you are kind of thrust into it, I guess. So, that was interesting.





                  Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Cast &amp; Character Guide   Apple TV&#39;s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters adds to the mythos of the Monsterverse with an international cast of characters, humans and otherwise.   


 How Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; Season 2 Timeline Changes Things 
         

The dichotomy between the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters timelines that Yamamoto mentions is one that&#39;s not extremely evident at first, but once examined, is certainly something that has an impact on the overall tone of the series. Throughout the entire first season, Keiko&#39;s character interacts with essentially only men, which isn&#39;t in itself a bad thing, but can only provide a limited number of relationship dynamics.



However, the end of the show&#39;s first season has set up a completely different feel for its subsequent one.







Yamamoto is referencing the filming of the final episode, when Keiko is brought into the future and interacts with Cate and May. This reunion sets the stage for a host of new interactions and narratives for the next season, and would undoubtedly lead to much more &#34;feminine energy&#34; being present in the overall show. Though the series hasn&#39;t officially received an order for a second season just yet, another set of episodes would have a lot of meaningful material to explore.



All 10 episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; first season are available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.
