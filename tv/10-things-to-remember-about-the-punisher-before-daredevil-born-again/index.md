 10  The Punisher Debuted In Daredevil Season 2 
Jon Bernthal Played The Punisher In Netflix&#39;s Defenders Saga


 







Jon Bernthal first appeared as Frank Castle in the premiere episode of Daredevil season 2, &#34;Bang,&#34; which saw him attack various criminal gangs, including the Irish mob, and also come face-to-face with Matt Murdock&#39;s Daredevil. Over the course of the series, the Punisher and Daredevil form a strange bond, while Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson become Frank Castle&#39;s attorney after he is arrested for his crimes. The Punisher also forms an unlikely alliance with Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin, allowing him to escape from prison, and Frank Castle&#39;s friendship with Karen Page is also established in Daredevil season 2, which would continue into his own Marvel Television series.





 9  Frank Castle&#39;s Family History 
Frank Castle Became The Punisher After His Family Was Killed
        

Frank Castle explains throughout his career as the Punisher that he operates as a vigilante to seek vengeance for the murders of his wife, son and daughter. Castle married his wife, Maria, after only a few months, and this relationship lasted through his time in the Armed Forces. He reunited with his children, Frank Jr. and Lisa, after returning home to New York City, however, soon after, Castle&#39;s entire family was killed in a massacre in Central Park, orchestrated to eliminate Castle himself. Castle was shot in the head, but miraculously survived, and the massacre was covered up as a car-jacking, prompting Castle to seek revenge on the men responsible.
Frank Castle had been a part of Operation Cerberus in the Marines, a covert military operation tasked with illegally eliminating targets in Afghanistan. Cerberus tortured and executed Afghan National Police officer Ahmad Zubair, and Castle and his family were targeted in Central Park because his superiors thought that Castle had leaked footage of these illegal activities. 






 8  Billy Russo Was A Friend-Turned-Enemy 
Castle &amp; Russo Fought Together In The Marines
        

While serving in Iraq, Frank Castle formed a close friendship with Billy Russo. The pair bonded over past traumas and shared experiences, and were both eventually brought into Operation Cerberus, working under Ray Schoonover and the enigmatic Agent Orange. Russo was with Castle and his family on the day of the Central Park massacre, and reunited with Castle months later, heading the security firm Anvil. Unfortunately, Russo planned to have his friend assassinated to keep Operation Cerberus secret, leading to an epic showdown that left Russo disfigured as the villain Jigsaw. After raising a criminal campaign against Castle and Homeland Security agent Dinah Madani, Russo was eventually killed by Castle.





 7  Frank Castle Worked With Micro 
Ebon Moss-Bachrach Played Micro In The Punisher
        

David Linus Lieberman, a.k.a. Micro, recruited Frank Castle in The Punisher under the pretense of the pair having mutual enemies. The former NSA analyst faked his death in an effort to continue to expose the government&#39;s secret affairs, including Operation Cerberus. Micro helped Castle uncover the truth behind his family&#39;s massacre, while Castle, in return, ensured that Micro&#39;s own wife and children were safe from Agent Orange, a.k.a. William Rawlins, and Billy Russo. The elimination of Russo and Rawlins enabled Micro to return to his family, having established a close bond with the Punisher and after seeking the help of Homeland Security.
Ebon Moss-Bachrach has recently been rumored to be cast as the MCU&#39;s Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing, in Marvel Studios&#39; Fantastic Four reboot, and while nothing has yet been confirmed, this would mean any iteration of Micro in the MCU&#39;s future would need to be reinvented. 






 6  Frank Castle Had A Strong Relationship With Karen Page 
Deborah Ann-Woll Isn&#39;t Returning For Daredevil: Born Again


 







Shortly after his arrest in Daredevil, Frank Castle begins to form a bond with Deborah Ann-Woll&#39;s Karen Page, who acts as his liaison with the law firm Nelson and Murdock. Page helps Castle investigate the deaths of his family, and supports him following his escape from prison. While she doesn&#39;t agree with his methods, Page feels safe in the company of Castle. Page later helped Castle investigate Micro, allowing him to dig deeper into Lieberman, and meet his family. When an assassination attempt was made on Castle in hospital, Page and Dinah Madani helped save and free him, despite Page&#39;s concerns that he should relinquish the life of the Punisher.





 5  The Punisher Made Several Attempts At A &#34;Normal Life&#34; 
Frank Castle Changed His Name To Pete Castiglione
        

While Karen Page wanted Frank Castle to have a normal life, Castle himself also tried to accomplish this. Following his return after Operation Cerberus, Castle tried to go back to normal with his family, but the Central Park massacre ruined this. After taking out the gang members involved in the massacre, Castle changed his name to Pete Castiglione, got a job as a construction worker and tried to lay low, but couldn&#39;t handle seeing injustice around him. After his criminal record was expunged, Castle again tried to have a better life, but soon became embroiled in protecting Amy Bendix. Castle ended up simply embracing his life as the Punisher.
In Marvel Comics, Frank Castle&#39;s given name is Frank Castiglione, but he changed it to illegally enlist in a third military tour during the Vietnam War. Pete Castiglione was also a real-world Major League Baseball infielder, so Castle may have been inspired by this figure, as he has spoken about his love for baseball. 






 4  Homeland Security Helped Frank Castle 
Dinah Madani Became A Stanch Ally To The Punisher
        

During The Punisher, Homeland Security agent Dinah Madani was revealed to be investigating Frank Castle. Madani had been the partner of Ahmad Zubair, and had been investigating his death before learning of Castle&#39;s survival. Her investigation brought her into contact with Billy Russo, with whom she entered a sexual relationship, but this would come crumbling down after learning the truth about Operation Cerberus. Siding with Castle, Dinah Madani and Homeland Security helped Castle kill Rawlins and Russo, and expose Cerberus, before expunging Castle&#39;s criminal record. Madani later joined the CIA after a final showdown with Russo, allowing her to continue to help protect her country.





 3  Frank Castle Protected Amy Bendix 
Amy Bendix Was Being Hunted By John Pilgrim
        

Giorgia Whigham debuted in The Punisher season 2 as Amy Bendix, a young grifter who was hired by the Russian Mafia to take compromising images of Senator David Schultz. One Schultz&#39;s family learned this, however, they sent Aryan Brotherhood assassin John Pilgrim to kill Bendix, leading her into the protection of Frank Castle. As the pair traveled to New York City, Castle and Bendix formed a very close friendship, with the former even teaching Bendix how to fight and protect herself. Despite Pilgrim catching up to them, Bendix and Castle had already eliminated his employers, breaking his contract, which set Bendix free of his wrath.





 2  Frank Castle May Know Matt Murdock Is Daredevil 
Frank Castle Helped Matt Murdock During His Battle With Nobu
        

Not many people know that the man behind the Daredevil mask is actually blind attorney Matt Murdock, but Frank Castle may be one of the lucky ones. In Daredevil season 2&#39;s finale, &#34;A Cold Day in Hell&#39;s Kitchen,&#34; the Punisher helps Daredevil and Elektra Natchios battle Nobu and the Hand, and Murdock and Castle manage to defeat them despite Elektra&#39;s death. This fight takes place while Daredevil is not wearing his mask, so Castle surely recognized the vigilante as his blind lawyer. It&#39;s unclear whether the Punisher and Daredevil will know each other in Marvel Studios&#39; Daredevil: Born Again, but it&#39;s possible that Castle will remember Murdock is Daredevil.





 1  The Punisher Was Almost Recruited To The CIA 
Frank Castle Turned Down Dinah Madani&#39;s CIA Recruitment Offer


 







After battling Billy Russo, exposing Operation Cerberus, protecting Amy Bendix from Pilgrim and saving the life of Dinah Madani, Frank Castle finally embraced his role as the Punisher at the end of The Punisher season 2. However, he received one final phone call from Madani, now working for the CIA, who offered Castle a job, hoping to use his skills to eliminate high-level targets. This could have seen Castle become a legitimate hero, but he turned down her offer, preferring to do things his own way. This suggests the Punisher will still be operating as a vigilante in Daredevil: Born Again, though his role in the series is still unclear.
