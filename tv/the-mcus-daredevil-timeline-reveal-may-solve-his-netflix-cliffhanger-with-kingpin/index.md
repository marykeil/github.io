Summary

  Daredevil&#39;s survival during &#34;The Snap&#34; in the MCU confirms his continued rivalry with Kingpin, despite Daredevil season 3&#39;s ending.   The theory that Daredevil and Kingpin lost loved ones in &#34;The Snap&#34; explains their new status quo during the MCU&#39;s five-year Blip.   Kingpin&#39;s freedom and his run for mayor set up major conflict with Daredevil in the upcoming MCU series.  







A key timeline reveal in the MCU may resolve Daredevil season 3&#39;s major cliffhanger between Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) and Kingpin (Vincent D&#39;onofrio). Having returned in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye series, it was confirmed that Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin survived Thanos who erased half of all life in the universe (commonly known as &#34;The Snap&#34;). However, Marvel&#39;s Echo series has revealed he wasn&#39;t the only Netflix character who survived, creating some key questions regarding Fisk&#39;s operations following the end of the Daredevil Netflix series.

As seen in Echo&#39;s flashback during the Blip when Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox) first joined Kingpin&#39;s criminal empire, Murdock makes a brief appearance in a fight sequence with Maya, confirming Daredevil&#39;s own survival during The Snap. While this does break a longstanding MCU theory, it also makes room for an even darker one regarding how Daredevil and Kingpin&#39;s rivalry ended in their Netflix show, one that will hopefully be addressed and confirmed in the MCU&#39;s upcoming Daredevil: Born Again series.




                  How To Watch the Marvel Movies In Order (By Release Date &amp; In Order Of MCU Timeline Events)   Want to catch up before the next release, or just revisit the universe for a refresher? Here&#39;s the order to watch the entire MCU timeline.   


 Daredevil&#39;s Survival During The Blip Ruins A Big MCU Theory 
Fisk Wasn&#39;t Freed Because Matt Murdock Was Snapped
          

Kingpin&#39;s debut in Hawkeye came with the reveal that Wilson Fisk was seemingly a free man who still had a criminal empire in New York. This was in direct contrast to his last appearance in the series finale of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil where Matt Murdock and the FBI&#39;s Special Agent Nadeem successfully exposed Kingpin. Although Fisk did claim that no prison could hold him (as evidenced throughout season 3), Daredevil guaranteed that he would expose Kingin&#39;s new wife Vanessa and her own criminal actions should Kingpin try and leave said imprisonment.




This uneasy ceasefire in the Netflix show also guaranteed the safety of Matt&#39;s friends Karen Page and Foggy Nelson, seeing how Daredevil&#39;s secret identity and life were known to Fisk by the end of the final season. However, Kingpin is a free man as seen in Hawkeye, leading many to believe that Daredevil was perhaps a victim of the Snap with Fisk then taking advantage and securing his freedom. However, Marvel&#39;s Echo breaks that idea thanks to Daredevil&#39;s fight with Echo during the same period.



 Did Daredevil And Kingpin Lose Their Loved Ones? 
Vanessa, Foggy, and Karen Might Have Been Snapped
         

Now, a new MCU theory has emerged after Marvel&#39;s Echo which helps resolve why it was seemingly business as usual between Daredevil and Kingpin (at least during the 5-year Blip). Rather than Daredevil or Kingpin being erased thanks to Thanos&#39; Snap, it was instead their loved ones who were lost. Kingpin losing Vanessa would have meant that Daredevil lost his leverage against him, explaining why he&#39;s out of prison and continuing to run his empire. Likewise, the same loss of leverage is true for Fisk if Murdock also lost Karen and Foggy.




This is a fairly logical answer explaining Daredevil and Kingpin&#39;s new status quo compared to their uneasy truce in Daredevil season 3, especially now that it&#39;s been confirmed that the Netflix Marvel shows are all canon with the rest of the MCU. The Snap would further tie them to the rest of the cinematic universe, though it&#39;s also incredibly compelling. Without their loved ones, all Kingpin and Daredevil likely had was their rivalry. To that end, perhaps it explains why Fisk eventually had Maya&#39;s father killed during the Blip, allowing him to claim more power for his empire while also gaining a surrogate daughter.

While one might imagine that Hulk bringing everyone back in Avengers: Endgame would mean that Daredevil&#39;s ceasefire with Kingpin is back on in the MCU&#39;s present, it may be too late. Fisk is already free, and his criminal empire is still intact in the current MCU. Furthermore, Fisk is likely taking steps to remove Daredevil from the equation for his own sake as well as Vanessa&#39;s (who&#39;s confirmed to have a role in Daredevil: Born Again).

Case in point, Marvel&#39;s Echo post-credits scene set up Kingpin&#39;s imminent run for New York mayor, a position that could see him outlawing vigilantes like Daredevil, Spider-Man, and more (just as he did in the comics). Seeing how Karen and Foggy&#39;s actors were recently confirmed for Daredevil: Born Again, tensions between Murdock and Fisk are likely to be quite high right off the bat in the upcoming MCU series.



All episodes of Marvel&#39;s Echo are now streaming on Disney&#43; and Hulu.
