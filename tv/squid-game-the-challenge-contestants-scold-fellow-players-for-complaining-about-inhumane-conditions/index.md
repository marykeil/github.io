# Squid Game The Challenge Contestants Scold Fellow Players For Complaining About Inhumane Conditions


## SUMMARY 



  Some contestants of Squid Game: The Challenge claim that the conditions of filming were inhumane, but others argue that it was not unexpected given the high stakes and the prize money at stake.   Allegations of freezing temperatures and a lack of food have been made against the show, but some contestants believe these claims are being exaggerated.   The fact that some eliminated contestants are speaking out against the conditions suggests that they may have personal reasons for doing so, such as trying to justify their early elimination.

## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 has faced accusations of inhumane conditions from contestants, but others are pushing back against their castmates.




Squid Game: The Challenge is Netflix’s newest reality competition series, and though some of the series’ contestants have already claimed that the conditions throughout filming were inhumane, others are speaking out against their cast mates. Taking the drama of the smash-hit South Korean drama Squid Game and bringing the competitions to the forefront, Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 has mixed some of the most popular tests from the show with a few of its own in order to find one winner out of 456 players. With the largest cash prize in Netflix reality TV history, the winner of Squid Game: The Challenge will walk away with $4.56 million.




While some contestants have spoken out against the inhumane conditions Squid Game: The Challenge provided throughout filming, others are standing up to share their experiences. In an interview with ET Online, one contestant shared, “I was very surprised that somebody ran to the media that fast because they’re just really upset that they got eliminated really quick. You’re not signing up for a beach trip in Hawaii, you’re signing up for something to win $4.56 million. It’s not going to be easy.” Contestants explained that though it was tough, the series was never treating them inhumanely, in their opinion.


 Squid Game: The Challenge’s Inhumane Conditions Explained 
          

While Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 is freshly available on Netflix for viewers, the allegations surrounding their conditions for contestants have been churning for months. Accused of freezing cold temperatures and a lack of food, many contestants are pushing back, explicitly calling the show “inhumane.” Another contestant explained, “I think it was a little bit of an over-exaggeration. I think we all knew what we were signing up for. It wasn’t easy -- like we watched the Netflix show, and you could tell it wasn’t going to be easy... Did it suck the entire time? Yes...[but] I was...very proud of myself [at] that finish line.”





 

While the pushback against the inhumane conditions of Squid Game: The Challenge season 1’s filming seems legitimate, the accusations themselves are harrowing. After the filming process, some of the contestants who were eliminated early in the game spoke out about players collapsing during competitions due to freezing temperatures and a high level of fatigue. Production, which took over 8 hours to set up the series’ first competition, kept competitors waiting as they set up the game of red light, green light. After waiting for hours in the cold, competitors played against each other for another 7 hours, which caused nearly half of the competitors in the group to be eliminated.

Though there may be legitimacy to the accusations against Squid Game: The Challenge season 1’s conditions, the fact that several contestants choose to speak out against them is telling. Competitors eliminated early in the game may have complex feelings about their placement on Squid Game: The Challenge. They could be looking to find a way to absolve themselves from facing a loss. While their claims may be genuine, it’s possible that Squid Game: The Challenge put their competitors in tremendously harsh conditions to replicate the game’s severe nature from the very beginning.
