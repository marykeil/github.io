## Literature Review
The origin of the monster outbreak in Sweet Home is a lot different from other zombie stories and involves a curse rather than the usual zombie virus.




What causes people to turn into monsters in Sweet Home is one of the most unique aspects of the show and sets it apart from other zombie outbreak stories. Based on a webtoon of the same name, Netflix’s Sweet Home season 1 was relatively faithful to the source material, including how the monster break started and what caused it. However, many of Sweet Home season 2’s characters and storylines were original, as most of the webtoon had already been covered in the first season. As a result, the show is now taking a lot of creative liberties, although it still borrows a lot from the webtoon’s lore.




Some of the best Netflix Korean TV shows are from the horror genre, including series like Sweet Home and All of Us Are Dead. Whereas All of Us Are Dead goes for a more classic take on what can cause a zombie apocalypse, Sweet Home combines the scientific aspect with a more spiritual approach. This is why it can be difficult to keep track of the origins of the monster outbreak in Sweet Home.


 What Caused The Monster Outbreak In Sweet Home 
         

Neither the characters nor the audience knew what caused the outbreak at the beginning of Sweet Home season 1. The woman who knocked on Hyun-su in episode 1 was one of the first residents of the Green Home to transform, but it is difficult to say who was patient zero. It did not take long for several other people to transform, with many monsters showing up inside and around the complex. The same thing was happening all over the country, meaning whatever got people infected inside the Green Home was also contaminating people from other locations. Hyun-su eventually realized he was contaminated too.




Considering how close to a zombie story Sweet Home is, it is easy to assume that the monsterization outbreak was caused by a virus or any other biological agent. Although the characters consider this possibility, it is later revealed that people are transforming into monsters naturally as part of a curse. In other words, there are no viruses or chemical agents involved. Instead, the Sweet Home monsters are born from the worst traits of a person’s soul, almost as if everything bad about someone was suddenly taking over their body and mind. The Sweet Home curse is about the soul winning over the mind.

                  Sweet Home Season 2’s Ending Explained: How Is THAT Character Back?   Sweet Home season 2’s finale sees surprising returns and tragic encounters, and it sets up the next chapter of Hyun-su’s story ahead of season 3.    

Despite the metaphysical aspect of Sweet Home’s monsters, which work as an allegory for human’s worst traits, there are some classic zombie tropes associated with it. For example, if a person is scratched or bitten by a monster, they will most likely turn into one as well. However, the transformation can also occur naturally and all of a sudden, similar to what happened to Hyun-su. A lot about this monster curse was first discovered by Sang-won, Yi-kyung’s fiancé, who would then become a lab rat for the government before taking over a different body and assuming the identity of Ui-myeong.






 Sweet Home’s Monsterfication Process Explained 
          

Similar to many zombie stories, Sweet Home’s monsterfication process begins with a couple of symptoms that reveal a person is infected. The first and most telling of them is nose bleeding, which usually reveals right away whether a person is infected. Someone about to become a monster will display erratic behavior, including but not limited to rage attacks. The transformation process in Sweet Home sees the worst sides of a person’s soul taking over their body, which is why most monsters’ “gimmicks” have to do with who they were as humans. For example, Sang-won/Ui-myeong wished to hide himself to work from the shadows and became a “slime monster.”

However, most transformations are associated with rage. Those who managed not to become a fully-transformed monsters are the ones who controlled their rage and worst instincts, thus preventing their soul from taking over their body. However, not giving in to the monsterfication too easily does not mean a person will escape the curse forever. This is why the residents of the Green Home, as well as the new Sweet Home season 2 characters, had protocols to deal with contaminated people. In Sweet Home season 1, the characters improvised a holding cell to keep people with symptoms quarantined and away from the rest of the group.






 Sweet Home’s Different Types Of Monsters &amp; Neo-Humans 
          

There are dozens of different types of monsters in Sweet Home, each of whom has a gimmick or a special ability. It must be noted that most of the Sweet Home creatures are not given a name in the Netflix adaptation of the webtoon, at least not within the story. That said, reference material released alongside the series, as well as the webtoon itself, can help classify the monsters. For example, the woman who transforms in front of Hyun-su’s apartment becomes the “Starving Monster.” Other notable monsters from the show include the Tongue Monster, the Hide-and-seek Monster, the Steroid Monster, and the Eyeball Monster.


 




The most important type of monster in Sweet Home, however, is the one where the transformation does not fully happen. The “special infectees,” who are now referred to as “neo-humans” following the events of season 2, are people who got infected but somehow managed to control the monsterfication. The first known example of a neo-human in Sweet Home was Hyun-su, who showed signs of infection at the beginning of season 1 but never fully transformed. Not only does Hyun-su keep most of his human form whenever he transforms, but he can also use his “monsterficated parts” as weapons and even as wings.



 The Sweet Home Monsters Are Still Evolving 
         

Sweet Home season 2 confirmed that the monsters are still evolving, namely with the reveal of creatures who entered a cocoon stage. The cocoon stage of the monster transformation comes from the source material and made its debut in season 2, episode 1. The remaining survivors went back to the wreckages of the Green Home and saw a woman whom they thought was long dead. This woman, as well as Eun-hyuk, already went through the cocoon stage and could pass as a non-infected humans. Some monsters are also evolving into stronger creatures, as discovered by Dr. Lim in season 2, episode 8. Yi-kyung&#39;s daughter also has unique monster abilities.





 

Another important Sweet Home season 2 reveal is that Ui-myeong is experimenting on humans, most likely to artificially turn them into monsters or neo-humans. This exemplifies how, even though the transformation comes from the soul, there is a level of science to the monster outbreak in Sweet Home. Additionally, it seems like Dr. Lim can achieve a vaccine, which would surely shake things up on the show depending on which remaining faction gets access to it. With Sweet Home now having nothing else from the source material to cover, it is difficult to predict what will happen next. Regardless, there is yet a lot to be discovered about the monster curse.



Sweet Home is streaming on Netflix.
