## Literature Review
Squid Games: The Challenge is a new competition show on Netflix. While filming, it seems a couple of contestants were injured and are now suing. 




Squid Games: The Challenge is a new competition show inspired by the Netflix drama Squid Games, and it seems a couple of contestants from the show were injured and are now suing. Squid Games: The Challenge is a competition show where contestants compete in a number of high-stakes children&#39;s games so they could potentially win the $4.56 million cash prize. The games involve a lot of strategies that will challenge the contestants and will eliminate the surrounding competitors. However, it seems the new Netflix competition series is already in some hot water just one day after the show&#39;s release.




In an article published by Forbes, it was revealed that two unknown players are threatening to sue Netflix and the procedures of the show over alleged medical injuries. Some of those injuries include hypothermia and nerve damage while filming Squid Games: The Challenge season 1. The news was originally featured in Deadline, which cited British personal injuries firm Express Solicitors.

 The Injuries Took Place During The &#34;Red Light, Green Light” Game 
          

In the statement from Express Solicitors, relayed by Forbes, revealed that the two unnamed competitors are seeking compensation for the reported wounds they had suffered while filming the series in the U.K. early in the year. According to the statement, the injuries took place while playing the “Red Light, Green Light” game, which has competitors crossing a field to play but also having to suddenly stop anytime an announcer says “red light.” The contestants allegedly suffered the injuries after spending a lot of time &#34;in painful stress positions in cold temperatures.&#34;




The lawsuit was filed several months after Netflix revealed three contestants did have to receive medical attention while Squid Games: The Challenge was shooting at a former Royal Air Force base in Bedford. Variety also published a story where the Squid Games: The Challenge contestants called out Netflix and the show for the &#34;inhumane&#34; filming conditions and how it had nothing to do with the show. Competitors weren’t even paid to take part in the series and were allegedly told filming would take about two hours; however, many filmed for nearly seven. It also took place during a very cold time in the U.K., where temperatures dropped to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

It&#39;s unclear how Netflix will handle this or if the competitors will take that next step to actually sue. However, the lawsuit isn&#39;t all that surprising since Squid Games: The Challenge has been underfire since the show completed filming. All these injuries could prevent Squid Games: The Challenge from filming a second season.






Squid Games: The Challenge is now streaming on Netflix.
