## Literature Review
A new trailer for Halo season 2 has been released, teasing the fall of Reach and finally clarifying how the show’s timeline compares to the games’.




A new Halo season 2 trailer has arrived, revealing how the show will tackle a key Reach event from the games. Based on the acclaimed Halo video game series, the hit Paramount Plus TV show was first released last year, introducing Pablo Schreiber as the Master Chief. Although the show earned somewhat mixed reviews, Master Chief is set to return in season 2 as he and his team of Spartans continue the fight against the Covenant.




Now, ahead of the Halo season 2 release date on February 8, Paramount Plus has released a new trailer for the upcoming batch of episodes. Check out the trailer and official poster for season 2 below:


 

          

The new trailer teases that the battle for Reach will be a major plot point in the upcoming season, finally confirming the timeline of the show as it relates to the games. The official synopsis for the new season is as follows:


In season two, Master Chief John-117 (Pablo Schreiber) leads his team of elite Spartans against the alien threat known as the Covenant. In the wake of a shocking event on a desolate planet, John cannot shake the feeling that his war is about to change and risks everything to prove what no one else will believe – that the Covenant is preparing to attack humanity’s greatest stronghold.
With the galaxy on the brink, John embarks on a journey to find the key to humankind’s salvation, or its extinction: the Halo.

 What The Halo Season 2 Trailer Reveals About The Show 
          

While the Halo TV show is confirmed to take place in its own universe, disconnected from the games, the reveal that the battle for Reach is taking center stage this upcoming season suggests that the series takes place before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved. The Covenant&#39;s destruction of Reach would later be chronicled in the Halo: Reach game as well as the Halo: The Fall of Reach novel, and it&#39;s this event that eventually leads to the discovery of one of the titular rings.

         




The synopsis suggests that Halo season 2 will condense and alter this course of events slightly, with Master Chief seeking out the ring prior to Reach&#39;s destruction. In any case, audiences are in for an action-packed season as humanity and its Spartan soldiers make a final stand on the planet. In addition to the Reach-focused storyline, the trailer affirms that a number of Halo cast members will be returning, including Natasha McElhone, Natasha Culzac, Danny Sapani, and Kate Kennedy, among others.

Long stretches of the combat in the first Halo game take place in the corridors of various ships, and action scenes featured in the trailer suggest that the show will be paying homage to these fights with a corridor sequence of its own. A fun twist, however, seems to be that Master Chief and his companions haven&#39;t had a chance to don their Mjölnir armor. It remains to be seen how Halo season 2 will be received, but it&#39;s certainly shaping up to be an exciting outing for Master Chief.
