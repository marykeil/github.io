  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Robyn Brown&rsquo;s tears and emotional displays may not be genuine, suggesting that she is playing the martyr.   Robyn&rsquo;s actions, such as making secret pacts and manipulating situations to her advantage, show that she prioritizes her own desires over the well-being of others.   Despite portraying herself as a devoted and self-sacrificing wife, Robyn&rsquo;s true motives and intentions are questionable, leading to doubts about her authenticity as a martyr.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives star Robyn Brown plays the victim. acting like she&rsquo;s always suffering for love. This isn&rsquo;t true. Robyn doesn&rsquo;t make many sacrifices.</p>
<p>Sister Wives star Robyn Brown&rsquo;s been acting like a martyr for years. Now, she&rsquo;s really wallowing in self-pity. She&rsquo;s finally got Kody all to herself, so she should be ecstatic. However, Sobbin&rsquo; Robyn&rsquo;s still carrying on, acting like she&rsquo;s suffering for love. She used to put on the same type of performance when Meri, Janelle and Christine Brown had problems with Kody. Robyn would turn on the waterworks, but how was she really feeling inside? Maybe it was all playacting. Robyn&rsquo;s a poseur who pretends to be sweet and demure, but there&rsquo;s something cold underneath. Robyn&rsquo;s a powerful person - not a saint burdened by the weight of caring too much.</p>
<p>In Sister Wives season 18, Robyn was mourning the Brown family&rsquo;s disintegration, but her saintly tears masked some shady ulterior motives. Offscreen, the simpering sister wife revealed a secret pact with Kody which would allow her to leave the marriage if she was unhappy, as per People. Robyn claimed she never wanted to leave, but she lies sometimes. For years, Robyn&rsquo;s acted like polygamy&rsquo;s poster girl, but inside, Robyn was so over plural marriage&hellip; if she&rsquo;d ever really been into it at all. With Robyn, there&rsquo;s so much subterfuge - sometimes, it&rsquo;s hard to tell how she&rsquo;s feeling and what she&rsquo;s thinking. Of the pact, Kody said:</p>
<p>Robyn and I made an agreement that if we weren&rsquo;t in love, that we wouldn&rsquo;t drag each other out.</p>

<p>Robyn Brown&rsquo;s A Backstabber
Martyrs Are Kind</p>
<p>Robyn has the tear-stained face of a true martyr, but her crying jags don&rsquo;t seem genuine. The slightest issue will trigger a flood of crocodile tears. At times, Robyn seems almost hysterical, but it could all be an act. When she cries, Robyn appears to care about other people, such as her former fellow sister wives. However, she&rsquo;s acted against those women in a million different ways, whether passive-aggressively or overtly. The most skilled thespians can cry whenever they need to - they can generate tears without using glycerine. Robyn may be that type of actress.</p>
<p>Sure, she&rsquo;s probably kind to Kody and their kids most of the time, but her kindness seems to stop there. When it came to the exes Meri, Janelle and Christine, she actually enjoyed twisting the knife. Like Lady MacBeth, Robyn pushed her weakling husband into doing some shady things. Was she the evil force behind the scenes who provoked her &ldquo;King&rdquo; to carry out the &ldquo;soul murder&rdquo; that was the never-ending neglect of three good women who really cared about him? Would Kody have been as dismissive and cold without &ldquo;Lady MacBeth&rdquo; at his side? Probably not.</p>
<p>So, although Robyn&rsquo;s very invested in being considered a good person, when her words and actions are considered, she&rsquo;s more of a villain than a martyr. In fact, despite the modest print blouses that she should probably burn and minimal makeup, Robyn&rsquo;s a bit of a femme fatale. She led Kody to the rocks and look at him now! The cranky patriarch Kody&rsquo;s lambasted for his role in hurting a trio of females that he vowed to love and protect.</p>
<p>Did Robyn need to sit right beside Kody at every family meeting? Did she need him to help her pick out a wedding dress even though that was against the polygamous family&rsquo;s rules? Did she have to break another rule by kissing him before marriage? Did she need to get the best house? Was it necessary to fat-shame the other wives and talk about how their body shapes weren&rsquo;t enough to inspire passion in curly-haired Kody? Not really.</p>
<p>Her acts of passive aggression are anything but kind. A goodhearted woman who really loved the other sister wives would never stoop to that. Robyn curates her image as best she can, but everyone sees through it. Robyn&rsquo;s purpose was to cut Kody off from the &ldquo;herd&rdquo; of sister wives. Once she emotionally sealed him off from them, Kody was fully under her spell. Like one of Disney&rsquo;s evil queens, Robyn used her feminine wiles and witchy powers to keep her man. However, Kody&rsquo;s no prize.</p>
<p>Robyn Brown Always Wants Her Way
Martyrs Are Self-Sacrificing</p>
<p>When Robyn wanted to move to Arizona because her son would attend school there, she got her way, and the other wives had to move too. That set the stage for the Battle of Coyote Pass - a war that left Kody feeling like Napoleon at Waterloo. Napoleon&rsquo;s final defeat happened on a battlefield near Brussels. His opponent hid most of his army behind a slope, cleverly concealing its size and firepower. Before his forces were crushed, Napoleon enjoyed a breakfast served on a silver plate.</p>
<p>At Coyote Pass, Kody showed some of Napoleon&rsquo;s hubris. Like the general, Kody had delusions of grandeur. The polygamist was also destined to taste defeat. His plans for the now-iconic patch of land were thwarted by drama and infighting. The bad blood between family members seemed to seep into the ground, just as though a real war had been fought there.</p>
<p>Robyn set all of this in motion by asking the family to move for her own selfish reasons. The other wives had to change their lives for her sake. It&rsquo;s understandable that she&rsquo;d want to be close to her child, but she took other sister wives further away from some of their own children. Everyone danced to Robyn&rsquo;s tune. Robyn led the troops to Arizona, initiating a series of unfortunate events that would change the Brown family forever.</p>
<p>A proper martyr isn&rsquo;t going to inconvenience others like this. They aren&rsquo;t going to drag along other people like rag dolls. Robyn wants her way, and she&rsquo;s not willing to give in. Kody goes along with all of it, catering to the whims of a woman who&rsquo;s an odd mixture of kooky magical thinking and steely resolve. Yes, she was always crying, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from acting like a commander with Kody and his three unloved wives.</p>
<p>To assess character in a cold and clinical way, actions are everything. They mean more than words&hellip; a lot more. What someone thinks matters, but it&rsquo;s what they do that shows who they really are. Robyn pretends to make sacrifices, but her life choices show that she sets goals and achieves them.</p>
<p>If she has to, Robyn will roll over other people, including hapless sister wives, like a Sherman tank.</p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Socrates chose death over renouncing his ideals. He was a martyr who knew the difference between right and wrong. Robyn&rsquo;s ideals keep slipping - she was into polygamy and now she&rsquo;s not. She cared about her fellow sister wives, but not really. Robyn loves Kody but has a lot to say about him lately. She&rsquo;s not all sweetness and light and her martyrdom is just a charade.</p>
<p>Robyn Gave Up On Polygamy
Martyrs Are True Believers</p>
<p>Religion was seemingly a very big deal for Kody&rsquo;s &ldquo;queen,&rdquo; but something changed. Maybe it was the breakdown of the family, which Robyn basically orchestrated from behind the scenes. As the power behind the throne and the iron fist in the velvet glove, Robyn slowly but surely pulled Kody into a new reality where only she mattered.</p>
<p>The other wives became scorned women who harbored major resentment towards the patriarch, although they probably still loved him. While Robyn seemed like the most devout of the bunch, she actually wanted Kody all to herself. Was that more important to her than her Mormon beliefs? It seems like it.</p>
<p>Jesus is the archetypal martyr - he was a pure spirit who was crucified. Robyn isn&rsquo;t as pure as she pretends to be. She&rsquo;s been playing a game for years, making a show of being into polygamy when she was probably dreaming of being in a traditional two-person marriage with Kody. This kind of deceit isn&rsquo;t the type of behavior that gets a person &ldquo;crowned&rdquo; as a martyr in the Mormon faith or any other religion. Martyrs are all about enduring persecution for posthumous reward. They show courage in the face of unbelievable cruelty. Has Robyn done that? No, not at all.</p>
<p>Robyn Brown Fakes Her Emotions
Martyrs Are Honest</p>
<p>How many times is Robyn going to have onscreen meltdowns? When she&rsquo;s constantly busting into tears and gnashing her teeth, Robyn&rsquo;s theatrics lose their power. Would a woman who wants to be alone with Kody really get this upset over the Brown family&rsquo;s problems? It just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Above, Robyn&rsquo;s actually hyperventilating, as per Tuff Topic at YouTube. It&rsquo;s way over the top. It&rsquo;s painful to watch. It&rsquo;s cringe. When she rips off her microphone, preparing to flee the set, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; senseless.</p>
<p>To determine the authenticity of &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; Robyn&rsquo;s emotional displays, it&rsquo;s necessary to analyze her actions. Do they &ldquo;agree&rdquo; with these outbursts or do they create a little cognitive dissonance? When things don&rsquo;t quite add up, and it&rsquo;s hard to avoid that uncomfortable truth, it creates a sense of unreality that&rsquo;s known as cognitive dissonance. Only when the motivations and feelings of people involved in a situation are truly understood does this &ldquo;bad feeling&rdquo; usually go away.</p>
<p>Robyn always covers for Kody, protecting a man who was often emotionally abusive with Meri, Janelle and Christine. He still criticizes his exes publicly even though he obviously pushed them away. Robyn&rsquo;s protecting her own special bond with her &ldquo;King.&rdquo; Defending a man whose patriarchal power has brought so much pain and turmoil to his now-exes&rsquo; lives isn&rsquo;t exactly martyrdom in action. In contrast, John the Baptist was beheaded for speaking out against a tyrant, King Herod.</p>
<p>Robyn Brown&rsquo;s Living Like Royalty
Martyrs Aren&rsquo;t Supposed To Live Large</p>
<p>The Buddha gave up all of his earthly possessions in order to find the meaning of life and evolve to the highest level. The lesson there was that poverty can be an exalted state. The usual concerns, such as the need for comfort, are cast aside, and the suffering that is done typically highlights the spiritual elements of existence. Going without can refine other aspects of a person&rsquo;s character, bringing out their empathy, generosity, gratitude and goodness. By embracing a Spartan lifestyle, a person may rise above the baser human instincts. In contrast to the Buddha, Robyn glories in material things while pretending that they aren&rsquo;t important to her.</p>
<p>Jesus promoted the same mindset, and in the Bible, it&rsquo;s said that it&rsquo;s easier for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than to make it to heaven. So, Robyn&rsquo;s choosing to dwell in an upscale Arizona palace rather than living her Christianity in the purest sense. Perhaps she should be giving away much of what she has and keeping her lifestyle simple.</p>
<p>The whole premise of Sister Wives is based on religion. The Browns are supposed to be very religious people. Now, three of the exes have embraced divorce, if only in the sense of fleeing unfulfilling spiritual unions rather than legal marriages. Religion seems to have fallen by the wayside in favor of self-interest. The cast members appear to be realizing that their time on the planet is limited, and how important happiness is. While Robyn remains in the marriage, she&rsquo;s drawing lines in the sand. Perhaps aware of the transience of life, she&rsquo;s getting tougher and overtly asking for what she wants.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a bad thing, but it&rsquo;s not martyrdom. Watching the Brown family shed some ideals in favor of a new goal - personal fulfillment - has been very interesting. While some religions reward martyrs for suffering, the essence of suffering is pain. Is life supposed to be an endlessly painful journey? No, of course not.</p>
<p>The purest spirits should be honored and celebrated. Nelson Mandela suffered in prison due to the right ideals. People like that have gone above and beyond for the sake of humanity and equality. Many people have given their lives to make society a better place.</p>
<p>When Robyn cries and carries on, acting like a martyr, it&rsquo;s just silly. She got the monogamy that she wanted - she&rsquo;s happy to live in the fancy house she claimed she didn&rsquo;t really want. Sister Wives season 18 star Robyn isn&rsquo;t trusted because she plays the victim while collecting rewards. Will she ever see the light? Being more honest about her personality and motives would help a lot, but that&rsquo;s probably not in the cards.</p>
