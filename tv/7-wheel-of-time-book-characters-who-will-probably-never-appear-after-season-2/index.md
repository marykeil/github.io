## Literature Review
Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time season 2 has seemingly ruled seven book characters out of making an appearance in future seasons of the show.




The Wheel of Time season 2 has seemingly ruled out seven book characters from appearing in future seasons of the show. Adapting Robert Jordan&#39;s 14-volume novel series has proved challenging for Prime Video&#39;s team, but the series is doing its best to include as many of the thousands of book characters as possible. After The Wheel of Time season 2&#39;s conclusion, it&#39;s easier to get an idea of where the show will go with the main characters and which of the major storylines from the books will be included in the TV series.
The Wheel of Time season 3&#39;s story is expected to focus on the fourth novel in Jordan&#39;s series, The Shadow Rising, which helps narrow down the potential plot points and character additions likely to occur in this season. It also helps predict which characters who have been omitted thus far are unlikely to make a debut later in the show. Based on the expected story in The Wheel of Time season 3 and the events of the show&#39;s second season, there are seven book characters who now seem highly unlikely to be included in the show&#39;s continuity.
            

 Wheel Of Time Cast &amp; Character Guide 
Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time could be the next big fantasy series - here&#39;s a breakdown of the sprawling cast of characters in the expansive saga.



 7  Hurin — The Sniffer From Shienar 
Hurin helps track the Horn of Valere after it&#39;s stolen by Padan Fain
        

While some missing book moments are likely to occur in The Wheel of Time season 3, nothing involving the Sniffer, Hurin, falls into that category. In the book series, Hurin is part of the team sent to track down the Horn of Valere after it&#39;s stolen by Padan Fain. Hurin is an important part of tracking the Horn because his ability to smell violence helps them stay on Fain&#39;s trail. However, The Wheel of Time season 2 used Elyas Machera in this role, opting to remove Hurin from the show altogether.
Considering the minimal role Hurin plays after helping track the Horn, it now seems highly unlikely that he will appear in the show at all. Hurin does pop back up occasionally later on in the book series, but he plays an extremely minimal role. Further, it&#39;s easy for the show to use Elyas or Perrin&#39;s wolfbrother abilities to fill in for Hurin&#39;s Sniffing, making it even more unlikely that Hurin will ever appear on-screen.


 6  Aginor — Forsaken Member 
Aginor is one of the first Forsaken to be freed in the books



Aginor, a member of The Wheel of Time&#39;s Forsaken, would likely have appeared in season 1 if he were to be included in the TV series, but his continued absence in season 2 seemingly confirms that he will be one of the Forsaken cut from the show&#39;s continuity. It&#39;s widely believed that several Forsaken will ultimately be left out of the show due to time restraints, and Aginor&#39;s absence from season 2 makes it highly likely that he is not part of the show&#39;s plans. In the books, Aginor is killed at the Eye of the World before being resurrected by the Dark One in a new body.
When this storyline was cut from The Wheel of Time season 1, it already seemed likely that Aginor would not appear in the show at all. However, now that season 2 has introduced two more Forsaken and set up several others without mentioning Aginor, it&#39;s all but confirmed that he will remain absent from the series. Anything is possible, but if Aginor were to be part of Prime Video&#39;s plans, it feels like he would&#39;ve been shown or mentioned by now.



 5  Balthamel — Forsaken Member 
Balthamel is killed at the Eye of the World in the books
        

Much like Aginor, Balthamel is a Forsaken member who would likely have appeared by now if he were part of the show&#39;s plans. He is also present at the Eye of the World in the first Wheel of Time book, and like Aginor, he is killed there and later resurrected by the Dark One. Balthamel is one of the less impactful members of the Forsaken, so it makes sense that he would be one of the villains who gets cut. Further, the show has taken time to set up several new Forsaken members other than him, making it even more likely that he will never appear in the show.



 4  Ragan - Shienaran Soldier 
Ragan helps hunt the Horn of Valere in the books



Ragan is a Shienaran soldier who appears here and there throughout the book series, but his main involvement in the story is his assistance in tracking down the Horn of Valere. Since this plotline is covered in The Wheel of Time season 2 and Ragan is not a part of it, it&#39;s unlikely that he will be included in the show. He does appear in some important places after the Hunt for the Horn, but he doesn&#39;t receive any role that might be considered important enough to warrant his inclusion in the show.




 3  Basel Gill — Innkeeper 
Gill owns an inn called the Queen&#39;s Blessing in Caemlyn
        

After the Caemlyn arc was removed from The Wheel of Time season 1, it already appeared unlikely that Basel Gill&#39;s role would make it into the show. However, it seemed possible that season 2 might include the city in some way, providing an opportunity for Gill to appear. Unfortunately, that did not happen, and there are so many critical storylines for the show to follow moving forward that it now seems unlikely that Gill and his inn, the Queen&#39;s Blessing, will be part of The Wheel of Time in future seasons.

 2  Someshta — The Green Man 
Someshta is the last living Nym in The Wheel of Time
        

Someshta, also known as the Green Man, is the last living Nym in The Wheel of Time, an ancient species leftover from the Age of Legends. In the books, Someshta appears at the Eye of the World, fighting and killing the Forsaken, Balthamel. Controversially, Someshta was cut from the show&#39;s heavily altered version of the Eye of the World in season 1, and it now seems unlikely he will appear at all. It still felt possible for him to be included in season 2 after Rand wandered off into the Blight alone, but after he escaped the Blight without incident, there is no obvious way for Someshta to appear.



 1  Dena — Gleeman&#39;s Apprentice 
Dena is Thom Merrilin&#39;s lover and apprentice
        

Dena, Thom Merrilin&#39;s lover and apprentice, appears in the second Wheel of Time book, The Great Hunt. She is introduced when Rand stumbles into Thom in Cairhien, and though Rand goes to Cairhien in The Wheel of Time season 2, he does not meet Thom or Dena there. Thom is expected to return in season 3, but since it no longer seems possible for him to reenter the story in the way he does in the books, it&#39;s unlikely the show will take the time to set up Dena&#39;s character. Further, she is killed in The Great Hunt, so there is no future storyline that might lead to her inclusion.
