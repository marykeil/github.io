## Literature Review
The Bear&#39;s new update not only confirms that season 3 will return to the show&#39;s roots but also establishes how it could be the series&#39; best outing.




A new update for The Bear season 3 confirms the show will return to its roots, promising that season 3 will be the series&#39; best outing. Before The Bear season 1 premiered on Hulu in 2022, there was barely any hype surrounding it. However, after its release, the show not only earned widespread critical acclaim but also grew immensely popular for its realistic and anxiety-inducing portrayal of the harsh realities of the restaurant business. Owing to season 1&#39;s success, the show was renewed for season 2 a month after season 1&#39;s release.




Despite having more anticipation surrounding its release, season 2 initially raised some concerns because it promised several celebrity cameos. However, the show proved all doubters wrong by perfectly incorporating all cameos while maintaining its storytelling prowess. As a new update suggests, The Bear season 3 will likely continue building on its predecessors&#39; strengths and even become the show&#39;s best installment.

 The Bear Season 3 Is Returning To Season 1&#39;s Kitchen Focus (&amp; That&#39;s For The Best)

Most details surrounding The Bear season 3 remain under the covers but Jeremy Allen White, who plays Carmy in the series, has revealed (via Variety) what season 3 will be focusing on. The actor said that even though he has not read any scripts for season 3, he will be &#34;getting together with some chefs&#34; and spending a lot of time with them to prepare for season 3. He also revealed that he will be setting up a menu with the chefs, which will likely be the menu of The Bear restaurant that Carmy, Sydney, and their staff started in season 2&#39;s final episodes. The actor also added that he will be cooking with the chefs to get prepared to do &#34;more of that stuff on camera.&#34;




White then recalled how he and other cast members had to go to culinary school and spend a lot of time in restaurants to understand the inner workings of the business. He said that, although their preparation for season 2 did not involve a lot of cooking and focused more on setting up the restaurant, they will be going back to &#34;that functioning kitchen atmosphere&#34; that they had in season 1. This affirms that The Bear season 3&#39;s storyline will primarily unfold inside the kitchen, which will likely benefit the show in more ways than one.



 The Bear&#39;s Next Outing Can Benefit From Returning To Its Roots &amp; Its Established Stakes

By going back to its roots and walking through the harsh, high-stakes conditions a restaurant&#39;s staff has to face on a day-to-day basis, The Bear season 3 is going to reignite the intensity, excitement, and white-knuckling anxiety that drew audiences to the show in the first place.







The Bear season 2 was captivating because it delivered everything that season 1 had promised. However, since season 2 primarily revolved around Carmy, Sydney, and the crew preparing for their new restaurant instead of actively cooking for their customers, it lacked the quick-paced drama and chaos that unfolds inside a kitchen. Season 2&#39;s finale gave viewers a glimpse of all the challenges Carmy and Sydney would potentially face in their restaurant, but it seemingly only scratched the surface of what lies ahead. By returning to its roots and walking through the harsh, high-stakes conditions a restaurant&#39;s staff has to face on a day-to-day basis, The Bear season 3 is going to reignite the intensity, excitement, and white-knuckling anxiety that drew audiences to the show in the first place.

The Bear season 2 walks through all the provisions the characters take to prepare for their new restaurant and also dedicates individual episodes to exploring their solo journeys, motivations, and struggles. While this was an insightful approach to add more depth to its character beats, it would be interesting to see how the characters will implement the lessons they learned in season 2. The Bear season 3 will also benefit from its kitchen focus because it will again force Carmy and &#34;Cousin&#34; Richie to work together, which will either help them bury their differences or further escalate their season 2 conflict. 




Although The Bear season 1 featured several flashbacks highlighting how Carmy worked in top restaurants led by toxic chefs, many aspects of his past remain shrouded. Since the show is returning to its roots in season 3, it could offer more insights into his past by walking through the milestones of his journey as a chef. Not to mention, with its emphasis on life inside a restaurant&#39;s kitchen, The Bear season 3&#39;s flashbacks could also focus on Donna&#39;s past and unravel how working in the kitchen of her husband&#39;s restaurant traumatized her and ultimately strained her relationship with her family.



The Bear&#39;s seasons 1 and 2 are available for streaming on Hulu.

Jeremy Allen White&#39;s update suggests that season 3 will likely be a combination of all the elements that made both seasons 1 and 2 compelling. Considering how The Bear season 2 was levels above season 1 despite having an even bigger roster of characters, it is hard not to wonder how season 3 will further improve the show and up the ante of its drama. However, as the update reveals, The Bear season 3 will likely strike the perfect balance between portraying drama both inside and outside the kitchen, allowing it to become the best outing of the series.

             The Bear Set in a Chicago sandwich shop, The Bear follows Carmy Berzatto, a young professionally trained chef who returns to take over his family business after the unexpected death of his brother.
