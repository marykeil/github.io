# Dont Get Your Hopes Up For More Of The Addams Family In Wednesday Season 2


## SUMMARY 



  Wednesday season 2 may not include as many Addams Family scenes as fans expect, focusing instead on fresh stories and the horror approach expected for the season.   Netflix&#39;s spinoff focused on Uncle Fester fails to capture the unique appeal of Wednesday, as it lacks the balance between teen-drama and macabre humor that Wednesday brings.   While Addams family dynamics are enjoyable, they don&#39;t need to be the focal point. Wednesday&#39;s independence should be maintained in season 2.

## Literature Review
Although there&#39;s a lot of excitement for a more Addams family-focused story in Wednesday season 2, it&#39;s not guaranteed - which could be a good thing.




Although there&#39;s sparse confirmation on how many Addams family scenes will be in Wednesday season 2, it&#39;s likely not as many as audiences might expect. Much of the excitement around possibly more of the Addams family stems from confirmation that a new family member fans aren&#39;t aware of yet will be present in Wednesday season 2. Additionally, because Wednesday season 1&#39;s ending shows Wednesday leaving Nevermore Academy for break and there have been teases about the Addams family mansion making an appearance, it&#39;s understandable why hype around more Addams family moments exists.




Following Wednesday season 1&#39;s massive success and wide appeal, Netflix confirmed a sophomore season with limited details. However, a darker tone has been teased, and it&#39;s expected that many fan-favorite Wednesday characters will return, such as Enid. In line with the scarce story details for the second season, there have been minimal production updates, aside from the filming location changing to Ireland and the expected production start date shifting to April 2024, following the Hollywood strikes. One particular positive is that the titular character fans adored so much in Wednesday season 1 will likely lead the story in season 2.

                  Wednesday Season 2: Cast, Plot &amp; Everything We Know   Following the climactic season 1 finale of Tim Burton&#39;s Wednesday, here&#39;s everything we know about season 2 of Netflix&#39;s Addams Family show.    


 Wednesday Season 2 Probably Wonâ€™t Feature The Addams Family Too Much 
          




While there&#39;s some merit in more storylines linking Wednesday to her family members, since this is a tried-and-true approach in other Addams Family content, it detracts from what makes Wednesday a unique project. Wednesday&#39;s success is in large part due to the revitalized approach to the Addams Family world by fixating on Wednesday&#39;s teenage years and Nevermore Academy&#39;s students. Including too many Addams family scenes can steer away from the horror approach expected for season 2, as well as the fresh stories that come with focusing on Wednesday and the new characters introduced because of her.

Although Netflix reportedly has another Addams Family spinoff, the idea already misses what makes Wednesday so appealing. Netflix&#39;s Wednesday spinoff focusing on Uncle Fester doesn&#39;t include the enticing balance between teen-drama and macabre, deadpan humor that Wednesday&#39;s character provides. But even more so, announcing a spinoff focused on yet another Addams family member further indicates that Wednesday&#39;s success doesn&#39;t need to rely on family dynamics predominantly.






 The Addams Family Is Great (But Wednesday Is Its Own Thing) 
          

Granted, Addams family dynamics are certainly a treat for fans of the franchise, but it doesn&#39;t need to be a focal point. In Wednesday season 1, for instance, Gomez and Morticia&#39;s story from their school days was more an instigator to help Wednesday&#39;s main mystery move along. Plus, some Addams family moments assisted the titular character with unraveling more about the Jericho killer, namely Tyler as the Hyde.

Additionally, Wednesday&#39;s piranha stunt as revenge against Pugsley&#39;s bullies in the beginning of the series sets up the rest of the story as it&#39;s the inciting incident that leads to her attending Nevermore. However, once at school, Wednesday&#39;s adventures, relationships, and mystery-solving are mostly separate from her family. Thus, season 2 should maintain Wednesday&#39;s independence when telling the teased story of her stalker and expand on secondary existing characters and potential new Wednesday characters, all while sprinkling in Addams family scenes to help secure the show as a staple in the franchise.
