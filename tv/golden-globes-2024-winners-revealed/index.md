## Literature Review
Awards season kicks off with the 81st Golden Globes on CBS honoring the best in film and television from 2023 – see the full list of winners here.




Awards season kicks off with the 2024 Golden Globes on CBS. The 81st Golden Globe Awards are back to honor the best in film and television from 2023, a year that was severely impacted by the dual writers and actors strikes. For film, Barbie and Oppenheimer (the cultural phenomenon known as &#34;Barbenheimer&#34;) received a combined 17 nominations and are expected to win big. On the television side, the final season of Succession received the most nominations with nine and is expected to dominate once again, though The Bear (with five nominations) should have a strong showing as well.




Hosted by Jo Koy, the 2024 Golden Globes began airing Sunday, January 7 on CBS at 8 p.m. ET from The Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles. Check out the full list of Golden Globe winners below:
