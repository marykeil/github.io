## Literature Review
Rob Warne is getting attention on social media from 90 Day Fiancé season 10 viewers, especially after rumors of his split with Sophie Sierra.




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne is getting a lot of thirsty comments on his Instagram page even though he got back together with Sophie Sierra in season 10. Los Angeles-based Rob, 32, and Sophie,23, from London, met on the social media app after Sophie followed his page. Sophie was interested in dating mixed-race people like herself. They connected instantly and Sophie even stayed with Rob in his apartment for a few days. However, when Sophie moved to America on a K-1 visa she expected Rob to change his living conditions since they were now getting married to start a new life together.




Rob’s house had no bathroom, and Sophie came from a wealthy family. Moreover, Rob had cheated on Sophie in the past by sending naughty videos to someone on Instagram DMs. Sophie forgave him that time, but in season 10, she found an app where Rob was getting inappropriate content from random women. Sophie felt hurt and betrayed by Rob’s actions. She accused him of online cheating. Eventually, Rob apologized to Sophie. She decided what Rob had done was not worth throwing their relationship away. However, the pair sparked split rumors in 2023. Rob avoids posting anything about Sophie on his Instagram.

However, Rob’s solo photos also allow his fans to hit on him in the comments. It could be because they think Rob is single since he’s not been posing with Sophie.

His cool demeanor in his pictures made fans comment with heart eyes and fire emojis. Meanwhile, one fan commented, “U are a beautiful man.” Rob showed his approval by liking it.
