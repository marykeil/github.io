## Literature Review
Gyeongseong Creature season 2 is looking a lot more likely after the end of season 1, which included a post-credits scene that changed everything.





Summary

  The cliffhanger ending of Gyeongseong Creature season 1 indicates that a second season is needed.   The post-credits scene reveals a character resembling Tae-sang in the present day, leaving their identity open for interpretation.   Season 2 would have to be different from season 1, taking place in modern-day Seoul and potentially exploring immortality.  







Gyeongseong Creature season 2 has not been confirmed as of the writing of this article, but season 1’s shocking cliffhanger means the show cannot be over yet. Whereas some of Netflix’s best Korean shows only lasted one season, others like Sweet Home or Squid Game received follow-ups. Gyeongseong Creature’s first season was split into two parts, with the final three episodes concluding the main story while also leaving the door open for the series to return.

Gyeongseong Creature&#39;s ending saw the destruction of the Ongseong Hospital, which could have been the perfect finale for the show. It would have been a tragic ending, though, as Chae-ok was thought to be dead. However, the final minutes of Gyeongseong Creature season 1, including the post-credits scene, confirm the story is not over.

                  Gyeongseong Creature&#39;s Cast &amp; Character Guide   Gyeongseong Creature, Netflix’s new K-drama set in 1945, sees Park Seo-jun and Jang Tae-sang investigating missing people and terrifying monsters.    





 Gyeongseong Creature Season 2 Needs To Happen After Season 1’s Time Jump 
         

Gyeongseong Creature episode 10’s cliffhanger means the show needs a second season. The destruction of the hospital, Chae-ok’s death, and the end of the Japanese colonial rule over Korea could have made for a solid series finale. However, by flash-forwarding decades into the future and revealing a character who appears to be Tae-sang looking exactly like he did in 1945, Gyeongseong Creature made it so that the series now needs a continuation. Whether Gyeongseong Creature season 2 will happen remains to be seen, but season 1 left way too many loose endings that need to be addressed in a potential second season.

The sequence featuring a television monitor airing key moments in the history of Korea – in color – followed by Park Seo-joon’s character opening the window to reveal a modern-day Seoul might be among the biggest cliffhangers in any K-dramas. The idea of characters living through multiple decades or a show telling a multi-generation story is not necessarily new, but nothing in Gyeongseong Creature suggested it would go from a period piece to a modern-day story. Although Gyeongseong Creature ending on a cliffhanger setting up season 2 was not surprising, the reveal of Park Seo-joon’s character living in the present day was shocking.






 What Gyeongseong Creature’s Post Credits Scene Means For Season 2 
          

If Gyeongseong Creature season 2 happens, it might not be a period piece like season 2 but instead a show set in the present. The biggest question, however, is whether Park Seo-joon is still playing Tae-sang, or if that person is an entirely different character. The character is referred to as “Ho-jae,” meaning they may not be Tae-sang but rather a descendant of his. However, considering the buildup to the reveal, as well as how the scene focused on the scar around Ho-jae’s neck, he could be Tae-sang after all. Both options would make for an interesting season 2, especially because the show wouldn’t have to recast its lead.

That said, having Tae-sang still be alive and looking the same as he did decades ago is by far the most interesting scenario for Gyeongseong Creature season 2. In a show where people can turn into monsters and monsters can regenerate, it would not be too far-fetched to theorize that Tae-sang has been infected and thus has not aged a day since 1945. Tae-sang may have drank the contaminated glass of water from episode 7, or he may have used it as a test subject for Kato or Lady Maeda eventually. Either way, the scar on his neck indicates a surgery or a transformation.



 Gyeongseong Creature Season 2 Would Have To Be Different From Season 1 
          

What makes Gyeongseong Creature’s post-credits scene so promising is how it sets up a very different season 2. With Park Seo-joon’s character in modern-day Seoul, Gyeongseong Creature becomes a new show entirely. The 1945 setting informed the show’s story from start to finish, including the political context involving Korea and Japan as well as the medical discoveries that were happening at that time. A period show morphing into a modern one does not happen very often on TV, which is both exciting and tricky. Gyeongseong Creature season 2 would have to build its tone and narrative from scratch unless it includes a lot of flashbacks.




What would happen to Han So-hee’s character is also unclear, as Chae-ok is not shown in the post-credits scene. Still, given how the process of bringing Chae-ok back to life included her getting infected with the Najin, she may have become immortal or had her aging process slowed down. Chae-ok’s mother was astonishingly resistant in her monster form and displayed some healing abilities, meaning those infected could live longer and age much slower than a regular human. Gyeongseong Creature’s finale leaves much room for speculation, which is why the show needs a season 2.
