## Literature Review
On RHOBH season 3, Marisa Zanuck appeared as a &#34;friend of,&#34; and there&#39;s curiosity surrounding what she&#39;s been up to since leaving the show.




Marisa Zanuck was a &#34;friend of&#34; on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 3, and there&#39;s curiosity surrounding what she&#39;s been up to since appearing on the hit Bravo series. The realtor tried to stay out of the drama and had a few minor arguments with fellow housewives, such as controversial cast member Brandi Glanville. As a potential RHOBH season 13 approaches, it&#39;s time to revisit the former friend of the show.




On RHOBH, Marisa was introduced to the cast through Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky, as they run in the same circles in the real estate industry. At a dinner party, she was annoyed with Taylor Armstrong for acting drunk in front of the group and felt that she was fake and hypocritical. Marisa was also in a feud with Brandi about her then-husband Dean Zanuck. Brandi thought it was strange that Marisa said he wasn&#39;t her &#34;type&#34; and defended herself by saying that Brandi didn&#39;t know her well enough to judge her relationship. Marisa lasted only one season on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and quit the show because she didn&#39;t want to be involved in petty fights anymore.


 Marisa&#39;s Real Estate Career Continued Post-RHOBH 
          

             The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills   Release Date   October 14, 2010    Genres   Reality    Seasons   12    Franchise(s)   The Real Housewives       




Since her brief stint on RHOBH, Marisa has popped up on an episode of the Bravo reality series Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles. Josh Altman helped her close a deal for $21 million for selling her late father-in-law Richard Zanuck&#39;s family home. Marisa left her previous job at the real estate firm Hilton &amp; Hyland to start her own company with Ryan Serhant from Million Dollar Listing New York. The firm is called Nest Seekers/Zanuck International. This career move put Marisa in hot water with RHOBH star Kyle because her sister Kathy Hilton&#39;s husband, Rick Hilton, owns Hilton &amp; Hyland. Kyle unfollowed Marisa on Twitter after hearing the news but claimed that she did it by accident.



 Marisa And Dean Got Divorced After RHOBH 
          

In 2016, Marisa filed for divorce from movie producer Dean after 13 years of marriage. The couple has joint custody of their son, Jack Zanuck, and daughter, Darryl Zanuck, who are now legally adults. Following her divorce, Marisa sold her Beverly Hills home for $1.8 million and was represented by the Altman Brothers team at Hilton &amp; Hyland, Josh and Matt Altman. That same year, Marisa joined a Venture Capital and Private Equity Principal company called Conscience, where she works as a Real Estate Broker.




After starring on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Marisa continued to grow in her real estate career and sold some of her family properties. She went through a difficult divorce but is still able to spend as much time with her children as possible. Marisa&#39;s kids are now older, so she can put even more time into being a successful realtor. It is doubtful that Marisa misses being on RHOBH as she has moved on from the reality TV world.
