# New Hulu Murder Mystery Show Is Subtly A Remake Of $130 Million Hercule Poirot Box Office Bomb


## SUMMARY 



  &#34;Death and Other Details&#34; is a murder mystery show on Hulu that shares similarities with the poorly performing Hercule Poirot movie &#34;Death on the Nile&#34;.   Both stories take place on luxury cruises and involve wealthy passengers who could be the murderer, but the new show introduces a unique detective character, Rufus Cotesworth.   While Hercule Poirot is a well-established and trusted detective, viewers have yet to fully trust Cotesworth due to his past failures and imperfect record. The show has the potential to further explore his differences and unravel the truth.

## Literature Review

Death and Other Details has some striking similarities to an Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot movie, but it also manages to set itself apart.




Hulu&#39;s new murder mystery show Death and Other Details has some striking similarities to a similar Hercule Poirot movie that flopped at the box office. Death and Other Details follows the eccentric detective Rufus Cotesworth (Mandy Patinkin) and his reluctant assistant Imogene Scott (Violett Beane) as they investigate a murder aboard a luxury cruise. The passengers, awaiting the announcement of a huge business deal and for the heir of the Collier family dynasty to be revealed, have much at stake and any one of the characters in Death and Other Details could have committed the murder.




Kenneth Branagh&#39;s Hercule Poirot movies under-performed at the box office, and Death on the Nile was no exception, making just $137 million worldwide. The movies came out at a time when murder mysteries were experiencing a revival, but Hercule Poirot was outshined by Knives Out&#39;s Benoit Blanc. Death and Other Details has added itself to the competition for the best locked-room mystery like Knives Out, but the show&#39;s similarities to one of Hercule&#39;s movies may not set it apart enough.

                  Death And Other Details Review: Hulu&#39;s Entertaining Murder Mystery Has A Flair For The Dramatic   Death and Other Details may have taken on more than it should, but for what it is worth, the show is entertaining and enthralling.    


 Hulu&#39;s Death And Other Details Is Very Similar To 2022&#39;s Death On The Nile 
          

The most glaring similarity between Death and Other Details and Death on the Nile is their settings. Both mysteries take place on expensive pleasure cruises with extremely wealthy passengers, and any of them could have killed the victim. Luckily, in both movies, a world-renowned detective is aboard the ship for other reasons, and begins his investigation into everyone aboard. Both detectives also find passengers on board to assist them in their investigations. Their premises are extremely similar, but Death and Other Details has some key differences that set it apart from Death on the Nile.






 Death And Other Details&#39; Main Detective Has A Huge Difference From Hercule Poirot 
          

Death and Other Details is still ongoing, so viewers don&#39;t have a complete picture of Cotesworth. Even with only two episodes out, though, Mandy Patinkin&#39;s eccentric detective has shown considerable differences to Kenneth Branagh&#39;s. Hercule is a recurring character in Agatha Christie&#39;s books, which Death on the Nile is based on. As such, he is a well-established character with a known history of being an extremely effective and likable investigator. Cotesworth, on the other hand, is a new character, and the only things revealed about him so far have proven less cut and dry.

  




Cotesworth has a less-than-stellar reputation in Death and Other Details. He was also shown to be an alcoholic, and his past failure in finding Imogene&#39;s mother&#39;s killer painted him in a poor light. While he is showing being kind to Imogene, both in the past and during the cruise, she is still unsure of him. Cotesworth has also proven himself to be an efficient detective, but his imperfect record still puts his capability into question. Hercule is the only character in Death on the Nile who can be trusted from the very start, but Cotesworth still has to earn viewers&#39; support.



Death and Other Details can be streamed on Hulu. The first two episodes are currently available, with new episodes releasing on Tuesdays.




Death and Other Details has only just begun, but the show&#39;s similarities to the Hercule Poirot movie Death on the Nile are already evident. Both stories tackle a nearly perfect murder among the upper class, all while on a boat. Despite their similarities, Death and Other Details has also set itself apart from other mysteries via its unusual detective, Rufus Cotesworth. The rest of the show could explore his differences further as Cotesworth and Imogene dig deeper into the details for the truth.
