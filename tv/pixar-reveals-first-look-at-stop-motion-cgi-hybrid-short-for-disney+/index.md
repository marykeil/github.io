## Literature Review
Pixar reveals a fist look at their upcoming stop-motion, CGI hybrid short for Disney&#43;, a journey of self-discovery given the title Self.




Pixar has revealed a first look at their upcoming short film Self for Disney&#43;, which utilizes a hybrid of stop-motion and CGI. While the animation company is best known for their popular theatrical releases like Toy Story and Up, they have also produced a series of short films in different animation styles. In recent years, many of these shorts have been released on Disney&#43;.




Now, Pixar has unveiled a first look at their latest short film, Self, which will be arriving on Disney&#43; on February 2.


 

The short will focus on a wooden doll&#39;s journey of introspection and fitting in, echoing films like Pinnochio in a shorter format. The film will also be the studio&#39;s first hybrid between CGI and stop-motion animation.


 What&#39;s Next For Pixar? 
          

Self is part of Pixar&#39;s SparkShort series, lengthier, independent short films focused on more mature subjects compared to other content made by the studio. The short will be directed by Searit Huluf and produced by Eric Rosales, bringing fresh viewpoints into the animation company&#39;s framework. It won&#39;t be the only new content from the company this year, though, with Inside Out 2 set for theatrical release on June 14.




Pixar will be having a unique set of releases in 2024, with the theatrical debut of their Disney&#43; productions dominating the start of the year. This includes Soul on January 12, Turning Red on February 9, and Luca on March 22. These new forms of release for all three films will give them broader audience recognition for movies that may have flown under the radar for some moviegoers.

                  Pixar Is Ignoring Its $10 Billion Cash-Cow Movie Franchise That Would Solve Its Box Office Woes   While recent Pixar movies have proven to be consistent box office disappointments for the studio, there is still one franchise that could fix this.    

Beyond 2024, Pixar will be releasing Elio in 2025, a movie about a young boy who accidentally becomes Earth&#39;s ambassador for an intergalactic federation. With a multitude of releases coming up, Self seems like it will be kicking off a very productive two years of new material from the animation studio. There could also be other shorts coming in the next two years as well, bolstering the number of projects that will be getting released.






Pixar has two untitled theatrical releases set for March 6, 2026 and June 19, 2026.
