## Literature Review
Sister Wives Kody Brown is feeling the heat from his ex-wives during the Tell-All episodes, and they&#39;re all starting to turn on Robyn Brown, too.




Sister Wives patriarch Kody Brown&#39;s exes may be sharing their feelings about him on Sister Wives: One On One, but Christine Brown, Janelle Brown, and Meri Brown have things to say about Robyn Brown, too. After a tumultuous season, Kody, Robyn, Meri, Janelle, and Christine sit down separately to discuss their experiences throughout Sister Wives season 18. While Kody&#39;s point of view paints himself and Robyn as the victims of everyone else&#39;s feelings, his ex-wives aren&#39;t holding back when it comes to their opinions on Kody, Robyn, or what went down in their lives during the season. In discussions with Sukanya Kirshnan, the Brown family is sharing their innermost thoughts.




In a preview clip for the second installment of Sister Wives: One On One, Kody&#39;s exes called out Robyn, each citing the same reason for finding her irritating. Sister Wives Robyn has always said she&#39;s able to &#34;speak Kody&#34;, and when asked directly, she explained, &#34;I think I get Kody pretty well. I feel like I understand him, yeah.&#34; Kody&#39;s ex-wives were quick to chime in about the claim, each irritated in their own way.


 

Christine, visibly angry, explained, &#34;Robyn says that she can speak Kody, and I’m like, &#39;Bull****&#39;...Robyn convinced all of us that she could speak Kody and that she would mediate our relationships. I even asked her one time to mediate our relationship...She convinced all of us that she needed to be there in the relationship, that she can speak Kody, and we can’t.&#34; Janelle also felt slighted by Robyn&#39;s insinuation, explaining, &#34;I’m like, &#39;Well, I don’t know if I really need someone to translate for me. We’ve been married a long time. We did OK without you,&#39;&#34;

 Does Robyn Brown Try To Control Everyone’s Lives? 
          

While Robyn always claims she&#39;s simply trying to keep the family together and help her fellow sister wives, it seems much more likely that Robyn feels the need to control the rest of the Brown family as much as possible. Robyn&#39;s issues aren&#39;t new, as she&#39;s been controlling and manipulative since the very beginning of Sister Wives, but seeing it play out in such a specific way is tough to watch. Hearing that Robyn&#39;s told Kody&#39;s estranged children she can speak for their father was irksome to Janelle, who shared, &#34;my kids are like, &#39;It’s our dad. We don’t really need you to speak Kody.&#39;&#34;


 




Robyn&#39;s controlling tendencies have been on full display since Christine announced she&#39;d be leaving during Sister Wives season 17. Despite not getting along personally with Christine, Robyn was desperate to keep control of her family and Christine went against her plans. After trying and failing to keep Christine around, Robyn also began to see Janelle and Meri pulling away. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, viewers saw a different side to Robyn as she worked to keep the family together, despite knowing Kody wasn&#39;t a good husband to his other wives. Robyn&#39;s need for control was stronger than her capacity for care and understanding.

Robyn and Kody have a set of their own issues that the couple needs to work through, but the fact that Robyn has flown under the radar in terms of just how controlling she&#39;s been about maintaining Kody&#39;s relationships for him is devious. With Kody siding with Robyn, pushing him to advocate for her in his other relationships and his relationships with his children, it&#39;s clear that he doesn&#39;t see the error of her ways. Kody&#39;s ex-wives, especially Christine and Janelle, seem to understand that the Sister Wives star needs to take a step back when it comes to controlling the family&#39;s future.
