## Literature Review
With many questions lingering since Severance ended, anticipation builds for season 2 to answer some of the series&#39; most burning questions. 





Anticipation for Apple TV’s Severance season 2 is high, especially given the numerous unresolved cliffhangers from the first season. Hopefully, season 2 will provide answers to the lingering questions left by the initial installment. As the first season of Severance has concluded, there are ample reasons to eagerly await the second installment on Apple TV. A predominant reason many have much to anticipate in the upcoming chapters is due to the number of unanswered questions presented in the finale of season 1. Understandably, those unresolved plotlines spawn inquiries regarding future developments.
However, the most pressing mysteries extend beyond the ending of Severance season 1. A hallmark of Severance’s acclaim is its stacking of compelling questions throughout the inaugural set of episodes. Some conundrums may persist for multiple seasons, perhaps not reaching resolution until the show’s finale. Nevertheless, certain pressing questions can provide integral pieces to better comprehend the overarching puzzle. Although not every question will be addressed, some definitively require answers to maintain the series’ momentum. The strategic unfolding of these revelations has become a defining element of Severance, promising the upcoming season holds the introduction of new layers to sustain the show&#39;s intrigue and depth.





 7  What Does The Company Lumon Do? 
Piecing together these fragments could unveil the corporation&#39;s objectives.




Lumon Industries&#39; sprawling operations remain shrouded in mystery. While Mark&#39;s department offers a small peak behind the curtain, Lumon&#39;s reach seems far broader. Clues point to diverse ventures, such as the extravagant gala denoting ample funds and political ties, while mundane O&amp;D products like watering cans suggest potential agricultural or generalized retail ambitions. However, no single theory encapsulates Lumon&#39;s overarching aims. What is clear despite the mystery is Lumon&#39;s ominous intentions, from severed workers&#39; eerie experiences to corporate desires to assimilate severance chips worldwide. Illuminating Lumon&#39;s real commercial and moral agendas stands among the most pressing questions entering season 2.





 6  What Is Macro Data Refinement? 
Unraveling the secrets may expose Lumon’s troubling purpose for its severed employees.
        

Mark and his co-workers spend their days sorting numbers, yet no one seems to know the actual purpose behind this mysterious data. Wild theories exist trying to explain their task, from rebuilding a post-apocalyptic world to censoring vulgarity in films. These notions, however, don&#39;t quite add up. It seems equally plausible that their mundane job serves no aim at all beyond basic occupation, but disturbing intents may lurk beneath the surface, such as experimentation on human emotion or advancing artificial intelligence through digital processing powers. If the speculative theories hold any truth, then nefarious ethical dealings could underpin Lumon’s shadowy data operation.




 5  What Happened To Gemma/Ms.Casey? 
Her identity remains one of the show’s biggest cliffhangers.
        

Mark joined Lumon&#39;s severance program following his wife Gemma’s supposed death. However, the season finale’s startling cliffhanger unveils Gemma as none other than Ms. Casey, the severed floor’s wellness counselor. This revelation spawns pressing questions. Did Gemma’s consciousness somehow endure through severance after her reported car crash? Was she already severed, allowing her Innie to continue existing when her Outie perished? Furthermore, did Mark agree to severance to maintain proximity to traces of her, even if his oblivious Innie remained unaware of her identity? Understanding how and why Gemma transitioned into Ms. Casey is integral to comprehending this emotionally-charged mystery.




 4  Who Is The Board? 
They lurk behind the scenes, their identity closely guarded.
        

Little is confirmed regarding their background or composition; whether a shadowy individual or collective leadership, their identity and motives are actively obscured. Allowing the ousted Cobel to retain sensitive intel seems questionable if secrecy is imperative. Perhaps most perplexing is their hands-off approach to the severance experiment itself, begging the question of their position’s actual authority over Lumon’s affairs. However, such calculated detachment from severed operations may speak to even more troubling designs, intentionally distanced from visible liability. While Severance season 2 may not fully unveil this phantom council, probing their indirect influences on Lumon’s activities could illuminate their power structure and what unsettling objectives they shape from the shadows.




 3  What’s The Purpose Of The Goats? 
This intentional surrealism likely hides sinister underlying aims.



The bizarre scene of a suited man bottle-feeding baby goats while spouting cryptic warnings raises pressing mysteries. The goats&#39; purpose within Lumon&#39;s severed operations remains ambiguous at best. They could connect somehow to macro data refinement or represent an entirely unfamiliar new endeavor. However, the perplexing goats may simply embody elaborate misdirection, generating questions without answers to obscure Lumon&#39;s true objectives. Perhaps Lumon conditions these animals for human experimentation purposes or other unfathomable motives aligned with corporate ends. Investigating known cases of Lumon exploiting people through programming could shed light on what fate they prepare the goats for behind closed doors.



 2  Will Anyone Understand Mark’s Message? 
The fate of Mark&#39;s urgent revelation and its impact on the unfolding narrative lingers.
        

Another burning question awaiting resolution in Severance season 2 revolves around Mark&#39;s urgent exclamation about Ms. Casey&#39;s unexpected presence. As the episode concludes, Mark rushes out of the room, recognizing Ms. Casey as his supposedly deceased wife. In a frantic attempt to convey this revelation, he shouts, &#34;she&#39;s alive,&#34; just as the Innies&#39; shutdown mechanism is activated. The immediate circumstances suggest that the answer to whether anyone comprehended Mark&#39;s message might be negative. The party attendees are preoccupied with the discovery of a previously believed kidnapped baby, diverting attention from Mark&#39;s revelation. Nevertheless, there are potential avenues for the message to be understood, perhaps through Mark&#39;s sister or other clever plot devices.



 1  Why Did Helly/Helena Sign Up To Be Severed? 
Helena&#39;s past and present can uncover the layers that shape her approach to Lumon&#39;s future.
        

The revelation that the rebellious Helly is actually Helena Eagan, heiress to the Lumon empire, prompts intense speculation regarding her motives for undergoing severance. While her outgoing message cites ambitions to demonstrate the procedure&#39;s safety in order to spur global spread, aspects seem incongruous with an entitled heiress who would expect privilege rather than potential exploitation. Considering her audacious personality that is prone to defiance, she likely anticipated resistance from her oblivious Innie identity toward the workplace manipulation her relatives orchestrate. Additionally, having witnessed severed floor conditions firsthand during her upbringing positioned her to better grasp the traumatic realities.

Helena&#39;s intentions may involve infiltrating as an Innie, appearing compliant while secretly aiming to dismantle Lumon&#39;s severance empire from within by leaking operational secrets. An insider with high-level connections could cause irreversible damage by providing access to compromising materials, revealing unethical experimentation or other violations. While many speculations exist regarding her noble or vindictive motives, understanding Helena&#39;s full motivations requires investigating both her internal and external perspectives on the corporation she is destined to lead. Exploring her personal history, examining her interactions with Lumon executives, and scrutinizing any potential alliances or grievances will be crucial in unraveling the intricate web of secrets soon to be revealed in Severance season 2.
