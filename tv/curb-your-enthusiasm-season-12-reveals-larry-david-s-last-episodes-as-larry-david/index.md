## Literature Review
Max unveils the trailer for Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12, which will be the show’s last, after a memorable run for the Larry David comedy.




Max has unveiled the trailer for Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12. Debuting in October 2000, the series has served as a way for creator and star Larry David to spotlight everyday indignations and relatively small grievances that tend to spiral out of control. Along the way, while portraying a dramatized version of himself, David has welcomed a bevy of celebrity guests, won two Emmys, and even staged a reunion of his iconic sitcom Seinfeld. Although the end of the show has been frequently teased, David confirmed Curb&#39;s season 12 farewell in a statement back in December.




The trailer for Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 has been released by Max. Check it out below:


 

The trailer does not shed any light on the overarching story of Curb&#39;s final season, though it does show that the lead character is as consistent as ever, picking fights with Susie (Susie Essman) and sparring with frequent guest Ted Danson. But in a twist, one of the scenes shows that Larry is actually happy. He, too, seems surprised by this fact.





The ten-episode Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 premieres Sunday, February 4 at 10 PM ET on HBO. It will also be available to stream on Max, with new episodes premiering weekly leading up to the series finale on April 7.





 Who To Expect In Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 12 
          




Several familiar faces will return. Along with Susie, JB Smoove is back as Larry&#39;s friend, Leon Black. Cheryl Hines, once a main cast member, who has recurred since her character split from Larry in season 7, won&#39;t be a missing Curb Your Enthusiasm character. The duo is squabbling once again in the trailer. Jeff Garlin, an original cast member, is also back for the final run of episodes. But along with those regulars, the trailer reveals the surprising return of Irma Kostroski (played by Tracey Ullman).

Introduced in Curb Your Enthusiasm season 11, Irma uniquely repulsed Larry, but for some reason, he could not stay away from her. Larry also gets on Irma&#39;s nerves on more than one occasion. But that all seems to be in the past, with the duo enjoying a meal with Susie and Jeff. It&#39;s one of the quieter scenes revealed in the Max trailer.

                  Why Curb Your Enthusiasm Is Finally Ending After 12 Seasons (&amp; 25 Years)   Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 will be the final season of the beloved HBO show, and here is why Larry David&#39;s iconic series is ending.    




Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 will carry on the show&#39;s tradition of welcoming celebrity guests, with the upcoming episodes bringing in Conan O’Brien, Sienna Miller, Oscar winner Troy Kotsur, and Steve Buscemi. The trailer also reveals Schitt&#39;s Creek alum Dan Levy, who Larry seems to catch off-guard. The HBO comedy is signing off, in other words, by staying true to itself.
