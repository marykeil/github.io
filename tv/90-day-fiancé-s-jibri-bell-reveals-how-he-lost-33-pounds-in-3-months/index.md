## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 9&#39;s Jibri Bell is showing off his 33-pound weight loss in the new year while fans continue to wonder if he and Miona have split.




90 Day Fiancé star Jibri Bell has lost over 33 pounds in the last three months since he left the U.S. Jibri, 28, and his 25-year-old wife Miona Bell starred in 90 Day Fiancé season 9 before becoming social media stars. Jibri was the frontman of the band Black Serbs. He was performing in Serbia when he met makeup artist Miona. She had big dreams of living in a big city in America but instead had to live in South America when she came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. Miona and Jibri got married in November 2021 but celebrated their second anniversary on different continents.




Miona sparked split rumors with Jibri after he left on a South Asia trip, and she removed all their photos from her Instagram. Jibri has been staying mum about their alleged separation, but he&#39;s been talking about his successes online, such as his recent weight loss.


 

Jibri posted an Instagram video to reveal, &#34;I left America 3 months ago and I was 213 pounds…20% body fat now I’m 180 pounds, 10% body fat!&#34; in his caption. Jibri mentioned that he lost two-and-a-half pounds per week. He added that he was able to lose the weight &#34;just by discipline, just by consistency, dedication.&#34; He told his followers, &#34;You guys can do this.&#34;

 90 Day Fiance&#39;s Jibri Bell Fasted For 7 Days As A &#34;Cleanse&#34; 
          

Jibri assured his followers that they could completely reshape their lives by cutting out the toxins and unnecessary junk. He said he knew it was hard but encouraged his fans to be the best version of themselves. Jibri added that he spent the last seven days without food just to get his physical and mental health right. He wanted to &#34;prepare&#34; himself for the coming year. He broke the fast in the video by eating an avocado. Jibri provided a disclaimer, saying he wasn&#39;t recommending the fast to anybody because he wasn&#39;t a doctor or a nutritionist, but it helped him &#34;cleanse&#34; personally. He mentioned how he used to have knee joint pain and inflammation from being sporty.

However, Jibri claims he woke up with &#34;literally no joint pain.&#34; He wondered if it was because he gave up sugar or some food that was causing inflammation. Jibri also doesn&#39;t feel any pain in his lower back. He was injured in jiu-jitsu a while ago. &#34;If I can lose this weight, you can lose the weight,&#34; Jibri said. He truly believes that anybody can do it. When a fan asked him what his intake had been during the last seven days, he told them he was just having water with vitamin C tablets once a day and magnesium before bed.




Jibri is still in Thailand and doesn&#39;t know where he will be heading next. Meanwhile, Miona is living in California, where she reportedly has been dating a new man. Jibri continues to claim that he&#39;s still together with Miona, but the Serbian woman has stopped wearing her wedding ring. She&#39;s also thrown subtle shade at Jibri on social media, saying she is not interested in being with broke men. Only time will tell if Jibri and Miona address the split rumors. However, it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re interested in making their relationship status public.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
