# Why Buffy The Vampire Slayer s Faith Spinoff Never Happened (&amp; What It Could Have Covered)


## SUMMARY 



  Buffy the Vampire Slayer almost had a spinoff series focused on Faith, but it never happened.   Eliza Dushku, who played Faith, opted not to pursue the spinoff because of the challenge of living up to the success of Buffy.   The spinoff would have followed Faith&#39;s journey as she traveled the world on a motorcycle, trying to find her place.

## Literature Review
The universe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer could have expanded even more with a spinoff focused on Faith, but sadly, it never happened.




The world of Buffy the Vampire Slayer could have expanded even further with a spinoff focused on Faith (Eliza Dushku), but it never happened. Buffy the Vampire Slayer started as a movie in 1992 before becoming the supernatural drama TV series everyone now knows, which was so successful that it continued to expand after the series’ end. Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran from 1997 to 2003, and followed the adventures of Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) as she got used to her new role as a Slayer, aided by her Watcher, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), and accompanied by her best friends Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan).




Buffy’s life was often at risk despite her skills as a Slayer, and as the series evolved, more and more characters were introduced, both allies and enemies. At one point, given that Buffy died but later came back to life, a new Slayer, named Kendra (Bianca Lawson), was activated, and after Kendra’s death, another one arrived: Faith. Buffy continued serving as a Slayer, but with Faith also being one, they soon learned that they had very different ways of handling vampires and their Slayer duties. Despite everything she went through, Faith survived Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and she almost got her own spinoff series.

                  How Buffy&#39;s History Changed When Faith Joined Season 3   When Faith was introduced as another Slayer in Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 3, she changed the entire show, and the main character, Buffy.    


 Buffy The Vampire Slayer Almost Had A Spinoff Following Faith

Faith came from a traumatic and abusive background, growing up with a mother with alcohol abuse disorder and an absent father who owed money to the mob. Unsurprisingly, Faith struggled to make friends, which continued during her teenage years. Faith showed great skills when she was activated as a Slayer, but after her Watcher was killed by the vampire Kakistos, she traveled to Sunnydale. Faith received a warm welcome from Giles, Buffy’s mother, Xander, and Willow, but she struggled to fit in with Buffy, who felt the new Slayer was trying to take her life from her. Faith had a wilder and more aggressive way of killing vampires, which also clashed with Buffy’s ways.

Faith was initially planned to be around for only five episodes, but she served as a dark reflection of Buffy that forced the latter to confront some of her shadows and question her own ways, becoming key in Buffy’s character development. Faith continued to grow in the universe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and appeared in the spinoff series Angel, where she tried to kill Angel but ended up becoming friends, and Faith even helped stop him when he reverted to Angelus after his soul was removed again. Because of all this and more, Faith was supposed to have her own spinoff TV series, but like many other spinoff ideas in the universe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it never happened.






 Why Faith The Vampire Slayer Never Actually Happened 
A Faith spinoff couldn&#39;t have happened without Eliza Dushku
         

The plan was for Faith to get her own spinoff TV series once Buffy the Vampire Slayer came to an end, and the project was being developed by Tim Minear. Eliza Dushku was offered the chance to reprise her role as the wild Slayer, but to the surprise of the audience, Dushku wasn’t interested. In an interview with IGN, Dushku explained that she felt that doing a Faith spinoff series would have been “a really hard thing to do” not because she wasn’t up for a challenge, but because of the success and popularity of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Dushku said that the show and the characters were so loved by the audience that having the spinoff coming immediately after the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer would have been “really big boots to fill”.




Dushku added that the Faith spinoff series would have been inevitably compared to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and that even though she loved the character, it was time to let her go and pursue other types of projects. Instead of leading her own Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoff, Dushku starred in the supernatural drama TV series Tru Calling and appeared in one episode of That ‘70s Show. In 2009, she reunited with Joss Whedon in the sci-fi TV series Dollhouse, where she played the lead role and served as a producer.



 What Buffy The Vampire Slayer&#39;s Failed Spinoff Would Have Covered 
There was more to explore in Faith’s story
          

As the failed Faith spinoff didn’t go past a concept, there aren’t many details about what it could have been about. Speaking to the Femme Fatale magazine (via BBC), Tim Minear explained that the unmade Faith spinoff would have been “Faith meets Kung Fu” and would have followed the Slayer on a motorcycle “crossing the Earth” and trying to find her place in the world, as having her rooted somewhere didn’t really seem like the best idea for the character. Minear mentioned Faith breaking out of prison in Angel, which could have played a role in the spinoff as there surely would have been some people going after her. After regaining her freedom helping Angel regain his soul, Faith reunited with Buffy and the Scoobies, where she was appointed the leader, but things didn’t go well. Faith was last seen beginning a romantic relationship with Robin Wood, the son of a Slayer.




Although Faith’s spinoff series never happened, Faith&#39;s story continued in the many Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel comic books and novels, and she even got her own title in 2011 in Angel &amp; Faith. Faith continued to fight alongside Angel, but a spinoff series would have definitely helped better explore her struggles to find her place in the world.
