## Literature Review
Chantel Everett makes a shocking confession about her relationship with Pedro Jimeno as she reveals why she almost refused to film The Family Chantel.




Chantel Everett revealed the heartbreaking reason why she almost didn&#39;t film The Family Chantel season 5. Chantel is a 31-year-old from Atlanta who first starred in 90 Day FiancÃ© season 4 with Pedro Jimeno, 32. Chantel and Pedro were deeply in love with each other in 2016, but their relationship slowly began to crumble once they got their own spin-off. There were visible changes in Pedro&#39;s personality. The official demise of Chantel and Pedro&#39;s marriage happened seven years later during The Family Chantel season 4. As soon as Pedro settled in the United States, he grew distant from his wife until he eventually filed for divorce.




Chantel revealed a shocking behind-the-scenes secret about her relationship with Pedro during her interview with Dish Nation.


 

Chantel shared the video on Instagram where the interviewers asked her how she felt while filming The Family Chantel season 5. &#34;Did you have to be convinced to go through your divorce on television?&#34; they asked Chantel. She replied, &#34;It was a hard decision.&#34; Chantel admitted she didn&#39;t know if she was ready to get &#34;vulnerable like that&#34; on camera. Chantel asked if she could be &#34;transparent&#34; with her hosts and confessed that when they were filming, Pedro was still living with her, but they weren&#39;t talking to each other in the house.

Chantel confirmed there was no communication between her and Pedro while they filmed despite living together in the same house. &#34;It was the silent treatment,&#34; she admitted. According to Chantel, the only time Pedro would talk to her was in front of the cameras. &#34;Why [did you have] that man living with you?&#34; a fan asked Chantel in the comments section. They told Chantel that she was a good person but should still have set boundaries by not allowing people to take advantage of her. &#34;I [saw] last night&#39;s epsiode. It hurt to see you so stressed and with anxiety,&#34; wrote someone else.

It seemed like Pedro only married Chantel for a Green Card when he divorced her immediately after qualifying for permanent residency in the U.S. Pedro hurting Chantel led to speculation that he was faking his emotions throughout the relationship. While Chantel supported Pedro&#39;s ambitions, he was ungrateful and a total user. He couldn&#39;t even tell Chantel the truth about why he&#39;d suddenly fallen out of love with her. Pedro put himself first all the time. His one true love was the American Dream. Chantel&#39;s family believed he&#39;d scammed their daughter and was a sanky-panky.




Chantel also believed that Pedro was cheating on her. He broke her heart by deceiving her. It must have been painful for her to live under the same roof with the man she once loved and not be able to even talk to him and find a solution. It makes sense why The Family Chantel season 5 is the last season of the spin-off. Chantel needs to be able to move on and get closure. Perhaps she can do so by taking some time off reality TV and heal from the pain Pedro gave her until she feels ready to be emotionally available.



The Family Chantel airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
