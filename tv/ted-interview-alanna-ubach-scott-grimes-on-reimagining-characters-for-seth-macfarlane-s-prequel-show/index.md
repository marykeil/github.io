Summary

  Ted is a TV show based on Seth MacFarlane&#39;s comedy movie franchise, serving as a midquel to the films.   The show retains the R-rated humor of the movies while shifting towards more of a family comedy formula.   The ensemble cast includes Max Burkholder, Alanna Ubach, Scott Grimes, and Giorgia Whigham.  





Seth MacFarlane&#39;s stoner comedy movie franchise is coming to TV with Ted. The Peacock show acts as a midquel to the movies, following John Bennett and the titular talking teddy bear during their high school years and their misadventures with their family, including John&#39;s cousin Blaire.




Max Burkholder and MacFarlane lead the ensemble Ted cast alongside Alanna Ubach, Scott Grimes, and Giorgia Whigham. Retaining the same R-rated humor of its movies while shifting towards more of a family comedy formula, the show is a fun and unique expansion of its predecessors.

Ahead of the show&#39;s Peacock premiere, Screen Rant interviewed stars Alanna Ubach and Scott Grimes to discuss Ted, reimagining the characters from their portrayals in the movies, and Grimes&#39; long relationship with MacFarlane.


 Alanna Ubach &amp; Scott Grimes Talk Ted 
          

Screen Rant: Scott, you and I&#39;ve chatted before for The Orville a couple of times, but Alanna, I&#39;d actually like to start with you. My first introduction to your work was Naomi in Waiting..., and to see you come full circle into this doting mother character is so fun. Who do you find you have more fun with, someone who&#39;s more chaotic like Naomi, or more reserved like Susan?





Alanna Ubach: Oh, gosh, it&#39;s always different, right? It really depends on the production, and what you&#39;re saying, and what it&#39;s all about, and how the character contributes to the storyline and all that fun stuff. But, I fell in love with Susan&#39;s character. She&#39;s from another time, she is this anachronism. It&#39;s a generational thing where she is pretty much the heart of the family. She is always finding joy in everything and anything, and she&#39;s basically on the good ship lollipop. That is her job, while her husband has these rage blackouts, right? Yes, it is so much fun to play her versus Naomi, opposite sides of the coin.


Scott, you and Seth have worked together for years now, but I find it kind of interesting that you&#39;re stepping in for another Seth vet after Ralph Garman played this role in the movie. What&#39;s that like for you playing this character, someone who already has existed in Seth&#39;s world?


Scott Grimes: Yeah, you know, we were doing something completely different. Ralph was so kind, right when it was announced, he tweeted me or texted me saying, &#34;I&#39;m giving the reins over to Grimes.&#34; It was so nice, because those guys have very little to do in the Ted movies, but boy, do they knock it out of the park. So, it was tough, because Ralph&#39;s such a good actor. It&#39;s great to work with Seth, I really truly feel like if I could only work with Seth the rest of my life —by the way, I think I have for the last 20 years I would, because it&#39;s such a family. Our crews are always the same, and he&#39;s just such a lovely man to work with, and it doesn&#39;t feel like a job.
What was the great thing about Seth is, as an actor, you&#39;ve got to be comfortable, and we&#39;ve been uncomfortable many times in our lives with some sets, it&#39;s tough to work on. I&#39;m always so comfortable working with him, so I&#39;d like to do that. And I wasn&#39;t supposed to do this. I was telling Alanna that there were people that he was showing me at his house that he wanted for this role, and I wasn&#39;t feeling bad about it. And then at some point, I think I started to go, &#34;Well, how about me?&#34; And we kind of worked on it, and it just was really lucky that he gave that a shot, because as much as you know somebody, that can go against you. Because they&#39;re like, &#34;Oh, Scott? No, no, he&#39;s fine, but he&#39;s not right for this.&#34; So I was happy to have that time to kind of weirdly talk him into it.





I think it was a perfect fit.


Alanna Ubach: Inevitable, I was gonna say, tailor-made for him!
Scott Grimes: I know these guys, I know these guys, these are people that I grew up with, uncles — and I hope my uncles don&#39;t get mad that I say that. But people in my life in and outside of Boston that were very similar to this guy.




 About Ted 
         

In this comedic prequel event series to the Ted films, it&#39;s 1993, and Ted the bear’s (Seth MacFarlane) moment of fame has passed. He’s now living back home in Framingham, Massachusetts with his best friend, 16-year-old John Bennett (Max Burkholder), along with John’s parents, Matty and Susan (Scott Grimes and Alanna Ubach) and cousin Blaire (Giorgia Whigham). Ted may be a lousy influence on John, but at the end of the day, he’s a loyal pal who’s always willing to go out on a limb for friendship.
