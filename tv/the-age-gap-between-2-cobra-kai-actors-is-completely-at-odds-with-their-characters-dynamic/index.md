# The Age Gap Between 2 Cobra Kai Actors Is Completely At Odds With Their Characters  Dynamic


## SUMMARY 



  The age gap between two veteran cast members in Cobra Kai affects how their characters&#39; relationship is perceived.   Ralph Macchio, who plays Daniel LaRusso, is actually older than Thomas Ian Griffith, who plays Terry Silver.   The age difference between the actors adds to the power dynamic between their characters and influences the dynamics of their scenes in Cobra Kai.

## Literature Review
Cobra Kai hasn&#39;t been afraid to introduce more characters from the Karate Kid movies to the show, but there&#39;s an odd casting quirk to acknowledge.




Various actors in Cobra Kai are at different stages in their lives, but the age gap between two of its stars could alter how their characters&#39; relationship is viewed. The Karate Kid spinoff show has evolved into a generational martial arts war between several changing factions. While much of the action in Cobra Kai takes place between its teenage characters, the actors with the age disparity in question are actually among the veteran cast members.




Serving as a sequel to the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai season 1 picks up events 29 years after the ending of Karate Kid 3. When the first episode aired in 2018, Daniel LaRusso, Johnny Lawrence, and Sensei John Kreese were among the only Cobra Kai characters returning from the Karate Kid universe. As Cobra Kai continues, more familiar faces from the original movies have rejoined their former castmates. One of the actors reprising their role is surprisingly much closer in age to another member of the Karate Kid cast than it appears.

                  Karate Kid &amp; Cobra Kai Timeline Explained (Including Season 5)   The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai saga spans Mr. Miyagi&#39;s life and continues with the children of Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence in the 21st century.    


 Ralph Macchio Is Actually 5 Months Older Than Thomas Ian Griffith

Daniel LaRusso, the original Karate Kid, is played by Ralph Macchio. In Karate Kid 3, LaRusso was portrayed as being 18 years old, despite Macchio himself being roughly a decade older than that at the time. Macchio&#39;s youthful looks allowed him to play younger than he was. In the same movie, his co-star, Thomas Ian Griffith, was playing Terry Silver, a character much older than his real age at that time of 28. So, although Terry Silver may appear to be many years Daniel LaRusso&#39;s senior in the world of Karate Kid and Cobra Kai, in reality, Macchio is older than Griffith.

                  Cobra Kai: Daniel&#39;s Backstory With Terry Silver Explained   Cobra Kai is bringing Terry Silver back into Daniel&#39;s life for season 4. Here&#39;s what happened between Daniel and the Karate Kid III villain.    

Luckily, both actors have aged gracefully and in accordance with their roles, which has allowed them to share the screen once more in Cobra Kai. Griffith returned to the franchise in Cobra Kai season 3, causing the trauma experienced by Daniel LaRusso due to Terry Silver&#39;s scheme in Karate Kid 3 to resurface. Since Silver has been back, he has risen to the status of the main antagonist in the show, even overthrowing his former military commander, John Kreese.






 Daniel LaRusso &amp; Terry Silver&#39;s Dynamic Wouldn&#39;t Work If They Were The Same Age

If both characters were of a similar age, as their actors are, the interactions between LaRusso and Silver would take on a different feel. Part of what makes Terry Silver&#39;s torture of Daniel so effective in Karate Kid 3 is the fact that Silver is so much older than his student. As such, Macchio&#39;s character doesn&#39;t feel capable of speaking back to the movie&#39;s villain, even when the grueling training regime is causing him physical and mental distress. Silver&#39;s authority over the younger man in their imbalanced power dynamic wouldn&#39;t have been so absolute if the age gap didn&#39;t exist, and their scenes in Cobra Kai would have been completely different.



Cobra Kai is available to stream on Netflix. The original Karate Kid trilogy is streaming on Starz.
