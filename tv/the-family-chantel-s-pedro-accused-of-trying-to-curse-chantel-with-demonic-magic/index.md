## Literature Review
In the next episode of The Family Chantel season 5, Chantel Everett gets a suspicious package from the Dominican Republic, reeking with a bad smell.




Chantel Everett from The Family Chantel received a scary item in the mail that she thinks came from Pedro Jimeno. The 32-year-old reality star and her former husband had a decent relationship for over six years. However, things changed in 2022 when Pedro suddenly demanded a divorce, citing he didn’t love his wife anymore. In The Family Chantel season 5, the two cast members are finalizing their split and preparing to sever ties. They are also moving on and trying to find new love. One of the recent episodes showed Chantel finally going out on a date. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out.




In a sneak peek of The Family Chantel season 5, reported by ET, Chantel got a mystery package from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.


 

She opened the box, which smelled bad and contained a mini casket and devil horns. Chantel said, “I have my jaw on the floor because there’s things that I have never seen before.” The Family Chantel star and her family immediately suspected that the “demonic” package “came from Pedro’s family.” Karen also said that “Pedro’s fishy witches” devised to curse their home “using black magic.”


 Chantel Everett &amp; Pedro Jimeno&#39;s Relationship Explained 
          




Chantel and Pedro never had a stable relationship. However, there was some suggestion they wouldn’t split up because of their history and compatibility. Over the years, the two seemed like a power couple. They received their own spin-off and even went on to celebrate many milestones. Sadly, their relationship changed when Pedro got his real estate license and began focusing on himself. He became more distant from Chantel and preferred his job over his marriage. Over the months, Chantel accused Pedro of infidelity and scamming her. However, she hasn’t been able to prove that yet.

Chantel is right to call out Pedro and his family for allegedly sending the disgusting package to her house. The Everett family only has a few enemies in the Dominican Republic, two of whom are Lidia and Nicole. Since the mail came from Santo Domingo, Pedro’s mother and sister are likely the prime suspects. Pedro and his family are from the capital of the Dominican Republic. Since the Jimenos have an ongoing feud with the Everett family, only they can stoop to this level and try black magic.




The Family Chantel season 5 preview was shocking and one of a kind. It showed how far some people can go to seek revenge, even if it means making a deal with the devil. Since the 90 Day Fiancé premiere in 2014, no cast member has discussed ever encountering black magic at the hands of their former partner. Chantel is certainly the first victim, and she should not easily let it go. The Everett family must take this to court and find out who was behind such a horrendous act. It will be interesting to see if the culprit is exposed and what comes from that.



The Family Chantel airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
