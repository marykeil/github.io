  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Daario Naharis, played by Ed Skrein, was recast with Michiel Huisman in Game of Thrones season 4, resulting in a noticeable change in the character&rsquo;s portrayal.
The Three-Eyed Raven was originally played by Struan Rodger in season 4 but was recast with Max von Sydow in season 6 for a more significant presence.
The Night King, played by Richard Brake in season 4 and Vladimir Furdik in later seasons, underwent a change in appearance when he returned in season 6.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Many Game of Thrones characters were recast across its 8 seasons, including Daario Naharis and The Mountain for various reasons.</p>
<p>With an expansive cast of countless characters over the course of an epic eight-season run, Game of Thrones recast several notable characters. The world-building of George R.R. Martin&rsquo;s fantasy world relied heavily on the talented cast of actors to bring these characters to life. However, while there were many actors who came and went on the show due to the bloody nature of Game of Thrones, there were also a number of actors who were recast in their roles for one reason or another.
Because of Game of Thrones&rsquo; estimated eight-year timeline, there were several characters who were introduced in minor roles and even non-speaking parts only for the character to become more important to the story later on. In other cases, as with just about any show, actors would sign onto the series only to move on to other projects. If those characters still had a role to play in the series, a recast was required. For such a big series, there were a significant number of Game of Thrones cast changes that fans may have forgotten about.</p>
<p>The Game Of Thrones Jon Snow Spinoff: Rumors, Cast, &amp; Everything We Know
A Game of Thrones sequel about Jon Snow is in development at HBO - here&rsquo;s everything to know about the spinoff, including all news and updates.</p>
<p>Watch On Max</p>
<p>1  Daario Naharis
Ed Skrein Was Replaced With Michiel Huisman</p>
<p>Most of the Game of Thrones recasts were somewhat unnoticeable because of the gaps between their characters’ focus, but Daario Naharis’s change in actors didn’t fool anybody. First appearing at the end of Game of Thrones season 3 as the lieutenant of the Second Sons, Daario was portrayed by Deadpool actor Ed Skrein. However, after appearing in the final three episodes of season 3 as Daenerys Targaryen’s new ally, Daario Naharis was recast.
Game of Thrones season 4 jarringly picks up the storyline with The Haunting of Hill House actor Michiel Huisman recast as Daario Naharis. For those who binged the series, the change was clear, especially since Huisman plays the romantic interest role very differently from Skrein. Many suspected Skrein didn’t return because of filming conflicts with The Transporter Refueled, but the actor debunked this in 2015 when ambiguously telling EW that “politics” kept him from returning.</p>
<p>2  The Three-Eyed Raven
Struan Rodger Was Replaced With Max Von Sydow</p>
<p>First appearing in a storyline that would affect the trajectory of Bran Stark’s character, the human Three-Eyed Raven debuted in Game of Thrones season 4 as portrayed by Chariots of Fire actor Struan Rodger. After being absent throughout season 5, the Three-Eyed Raven was recast with legendary actor Max von Sydow in the role for season 6 as he returned to assist in Bran’s journey.
The reason for the Three-Eyed Raven’s recasting was never officially revealed by Game of Thrones&rsquo; team, but it’s likely that the series wanted a more notable and reliable actor in the role as the character took on a more significant presence, prompting the Game of Thrones actor change. Similar to the Daario Nahaaris recasting, the Three-Eyed-Raven’s overall appearance and personality shifted with the new actor as well.</p>
<p>Every Game Of Thrones Actor In Benioff &amp; Weiss&rsquo; 3 Body Problem
Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss&rsquo; new show, 3 Body Problem, is coming, and the series is set to reunite several GOT stars.</p>
<p>3  The Night King
Richard Brake Was Replaced With Vladimir Furdik</p>
<p>One of the Game of Thrones recasts that was more difficult to detect under all the prosthetics and CGI was the villainous Night King, who served as the underlying threat to the characters throughout Game of Thrones. First introduced in season 4, the Night King was played by Richard Brake until his final appearance in season 5. When the character was reintroduced in Game of Thrones season 6, he appeared human as one of the First Men who was killed by the Children of the Forest.
For this appearance, the Night King was recast with actor Vladimir Furdik, who then portrayed the villain in his White Walker form until being killed by Arya in the Battle of Winterfell. The reason for the Night King’s recast isn’t completely straightforward as many theorize Richard Brake left due to scheduling conflicts with The Bastard Executioner, though there&rsquo;s no clear confirmation. Nonetheless, Furdik was already one of Game of Thrones’ key stuntmen and ironically portrayed the first White Walker that Jon Snow killed, so the executives asked him to take over as the Night King for season 6.</p>
<p>4  The Mountain
Conan Stevens Was Replaced By Ian Whyte Who Was Replaced With Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson</p>
<p>Finding the right actor to play the most feared fighter in Westeros was clearly a difficult task as The Mountain was recast twice. The Mountain, whose real name is Gregor Clegane, was first introduced in Game of Thrones’ first season as a violent fighter and the older brother of The Hound. He was first portrayed by Conan Stevens, before exiting due to scheduling conflicts with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.
The next Game of Thrones actor change saw actor Ian Whyte for three episodes in Game of Thrones season 2, but the actor had difficulty removing his emotions from the character’s gruesome brutality, so he was cast as wight and wildling giants like Wun Wun after season 2.
Since The Mountain’s face is typically behind a helmet, the actor most remembered for playing him is Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, who was the one crushing Oberyn Martell’s skull in the climactic trial by combat. The Icelandic strongman took over the role in season 4 and remained The Mountain’s actor until the character died in the highly-anticipated Cleganebowl fight in Game of Thrones’ penultimate episode.</p>
<p>5  Beric Dondarrion
David Michael Scott Was Replaced With Richard Dormer</p>
<p>The Lord of Blackhaven, Beric Dondarrion was introduced to Game of Thrones in the season 1 episode “A Golden Crown,” where he was played by David Michael Scott. Tasked by Ned Stark to hunt down and execute The Mountain, Beric Dondarrion wasn’t seen again until season 3 when he was played by a different actor.
Scott was credited as a “featured extra” for his season 1 episode as Dondarrion, which suggests the casting department was waiting to find the right actor for the role. Reappearing in his notable eye patch and armor in season 3, Beric Dondarian was then played by Richard Dormer for the remainder of the series until he sacrificed himself for Arya in the Battle of Winterfell.</p>
<p>9 Game Of Thrones Actors Who Auditioned For Other Characters
Before being cast in their famous Game of Thrones roles, these nine actors auditioned for different characters. Here&rsquo;s who these stars almost played.</p>
<p>6  Leaf
Octavia Alexandru Was Replaced With Kae Alexander</p>
<p>Even though the character was only featured in a total of five episodes throughout Game of Thrones, Leaf was still recast. Leaf was introduced alongside the Three-Eyed Raven in Game of Thrones’ season 4 finale as a Child of the Forest who helps save Bran. For the season 4 episode, Leaf was played by actress Octavia Alexandru, who was 12 years old when the episode premiered.
After being absent during season 5, Leaf returned to assist Bran during season 6 as portrayed by Kae Alexander, who went on to star in the cast of The Wheel of Time series. Since Leaf took on a much more significant and intense role in season 6, it makes sense why Game of Thrones recast the character with a more mature and established actress.</p>
<p>7  Rickard Karstark
Steve Blount Was Replaced With John Stahl</p>
<p>When Rickard Karstark was first introduced in season 1, the character had a fairly minor role compared to what was to come when Robb Stark assumed leadership as King of the North. In the Game of Thrones season 1 finale when Rickard Karstark is the second to name Robb king, with actor Steve Blount playing the role.
When the character returned for season 2, Richard Karstark was played by actor John Stahl, who maintained the role until his final on-screen appearance in season 3. Since Karstark’s character would be expanded and serve as a core supporter and critic of Robb Stark, Game of Thrones likely wanted a more established and versatile actor in the role that contributed to Robb Stark&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
<p>8  Lothar Frey
Tom Brooke Was Replaced With Daniel Tuite</p>
<p>While Lord Walder Frey had too many children to remember, the one son who had a semi-present role in Game of Thrones was Lothar Frey. The character was introduced in season 3, where he played an integral role in planning the shockingly brutal Red Wedding, which would end in the murders of Robb, Catelyn, and Talissa Stark. In his two-episode arc in season 3, Lothar was portrayed by Tom Brooke.
After being absent for seasons 4 and 5, the Freys reappeared in Game of Thrones season 6 to fight alongside Jaime and make the Blackfish surrender. During these episodes, Lothar is portrayed by Daniel Tuite. It’s unclear why Lothar was recast, but the two-season hiatus of the character likely meant Brooke was unavailable. Lothar’s final appearance was in season 6 unless counting the pie he was baked into for season 7 when Arya killed all the Frey men and left House Frey nearly extinct.</p>
<p>9  Dickon Tarly
Freddie Stroma Was Replaced With Tom Hopper</p>
<p>The favored younger brother of the lovable Samwell, Dickon Tarly was first seen in Game of Thrones season 6 when Sam returned to Horn Hill on his way to the Citadel. Dickon is portrayed by Freddie Stroma (Vigilante in Peacemaker) during the episode in which he eats dinner and chats with Sam and Gilly and isn’t seen again until season 7 where he’s played by The Umbrella Academy actor Tom Hopper.
Stroma was originally supposed to reprise his role as Dickon, but scheduling conflicts with Time After Time got in the way, leading Hopper to play the character when executed by Daenerys.</p>
<p>Every Game Of Thrones Actor In Netflix’s Rebel Moon Explained
The cast of Netflix&rsquo;s Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire features several actors who previously had roles in HBO&rsquo;s Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>10  Myrcella Baratheon
Aimee Richardson Was Replaced With Nell Tiger Free</p>
<p>Although her family plays one of the largest roles in the series, Myrcella Baratheon plays the smallest part in the Baratheon/Lannister family. Cersei’s (and Jaime’s) daughter Myrcella Baratheon was largely a background character in seasons 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones. She was played by child actress Aimee Richardson when first sent to Dorne by Tyrion Lannister.
Myrcella doesn’t return until Game of Thrones season 5, where she is now a teenager and has clearly fallen in love with her fiancé Trystane Martell. For Myrcella’s final four episodes in seasons 5 and 6, the character was portrayed by actress Nell Tiger Free. An official reason for the recast was never given, but Richardson apparently found out she wouldn’t be returning alongside fans during the San Diego Comic-Con. Since Myrcella’s role was expanded with a lot more emotional tension and drama, Game of Thrones likely wanted an actress who could bring more nuance to the long-removed princess.</p>
<p>11  Tommen Baratheon
Callum Wharry Was Replaced With Dean-Charles Chapman</p>
<p>Like Myrcella, Tommen Baratheon was also recast in season 4 when the role was expanded and required more experience. Tommen was portrayed by Callum Wharry in Game of Thrones seasons 1 and 2 as a young child who was primarily a background character. It’s not clear why Tommen was absent during season 3, but when he returned in season 4 as the new king after his brother Joffrey Baratheon’s death, he was played by the more mature Dean-Charles Chapman.
Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman revealed on the Game of Owns podcast that Tommen was recast because he was going to be king, meaning more heavy and intensive acting for the character required an experienced actor. His reign as king turned out to be short as Tommen killed himself in Game of Thrones season 6. Similar to the Night King’s recasting, Chapman had previously worked on the series when portraying Tommen’s murdered cousin Martyn Lannister in season 2.</p>
<p>12  Selyse Baratheon
Sarah Mac Keever Was Replaced With Tara Fitzgerald</p>
<p>Whether Stannis’s wife and young Shireen Baratheon&rsquo;s mother Selyse was truly recast or not is up for debate since the first actress was uncredited, but it seems likely it was the case of a place-holder casting. When Stannis’s family is first introduced during season 2, Stannis extends his hand to a woman who stands next to him at the funeral pyre, suggesting it’s his wife Selyse.
The uncredited role was played by Sarah Mac Keever, but when Selyse Baratheon returned as an expanded and more intensive character in season 3, experienced actress Tara Fitzgerald took over as the queen. The reasoning seems to follow that Game of Thrones wasn’t ready to hire an actress for such a minor role in season 2, so they waited until Selyse was a full-blown character to cast a permanent actress in season 3.
Some Recastings Completely Changed The Characters&rsquo; Appearance</p>
<p>Many of Game of Thrones recasts aren&rsquo;t massively noticeable, especially those where placeholder actors initially stood in for the role such as the uncredited Selyse Baratheon actress changing in season 2. Sarah Mac Keever, the series 2 Selyse stand-in, and Sarah Mac Keever aren&rsquo;t identical but look similar enough for the switch to go unnoticed by most. Some, though, are incredibly jarring and off-putting to fans and even casual viewers.
Daario Naharis&rsquo; Michiel Huisman replacing Ed Skrein or the Three-Eyed Raven actor changing from Struan Rodger to Max von Sydow, created huge aesthetic continuity issues. Skrein&rsquo;s Daario Naharis looks nothing like Huisman&rsquo;s Daario and no attempts were made to make it appear as their these two were the same people with Huisman even growing a beard for the role. Both versions of Daario look and even act like distinctly separate characters.
The Three Eye Raven&rsquo;s vastly altered appearance between seasons 4 and 6 goes a step further. Not only are Rodger and von Sydow not that similar in real life, but an excessive retooling of the character&rsquo;s prosthetic effects for von Sydow also made the change too hard to ignore, so much so that it became one of the many criticisms of Game of Thrones overall. The first Three-Eyed Raven, Struan Rodger, had completely black eyes, long wispy hair, and leathery skin. He genuinely looked like a cross between Gandalf and Gollum.
When the character returned in season 6 as Von Sydow is was drastically altered with the look simplified. It wasn&rsquo;t even just that the hair and beard were gone — whereas his protégé Leaf had leaned into her fey-inspired roots, von Sydow&rsquo;s Raven looked indistinguishable from any of the older members of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Hopefully, the Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon manages to switch out actors and actresses more deftly if it needs to.</p>
<p>9 Game Of Thrones Actors Who Auditioned For Other Characters
Before being cast in their famous Game of Thrones roles, these nine actors auditioned for different characters. Here&rsquo;s who these stars almost played.</p>
<p>House Of The Dragon&rsquo;s Deliberate Recasts Explained</p>
<p>The Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon cast saw a huge amount of recasts over season 1 — however, these were necessary for narrative purposes. House of the Dragon season 1 basically sets up the entire tale for the Targaryen Civil War, known as the Dance of the Dragons. The purpose of the whole season is to lay out all the events which set in motion the major war, and establish the factions of the Greens and the Blacks, and how they came to each separate cause.
The two big recasts were that of Rhaenyra Targaryen, which initially saw Milly Alcock for the first 5 episodes then Emma D&rsquo;arcy for the remaining 5, and Alicent Hightower, who was first played by Emily Carey and then Olivia Cooke. This was done to represent the passage of time, which sees the beginning of the series with Rhaenyra around 15 and in her 30s by the end of season 1. The same was done for all of the children in House of the Dragon. Since the timeline for season 1 spans about 20 years, these Game of Thrones recasts were entirely necessary.
All of the Velaryon and Targaryen children are recast at some point, with the biggest time jump occurring between episodes 5 and 6. HotD saw different Aegons, Aemonds, and Helenas, as well as different Jaces, Lucerys, Laenas, and Rhaenors. Pretty much the only characters who weren&rsquo;t recast were Daemon Targaryen, Viserys Targaryen, Rhaenys Velaryon, and Corlys Velaryon. While the House of the Dragon recasts were confusing at first, they were at least integral to the series, unlike Game of Thrones.
Are There More House Of The Dragon Recasts Coming?</p>
<p>Season 1 of House of the Dragon outdid any of the Game of Thrones cast changes as some of the most significant characters of the series had new actors in the role. It was a risky move to do just as the audience was settling into the story and these new characters and it likely caused fans to wonder if they can expect more recasting as the series goes on. Luckily, the showrunners of House of the Dragon addressed those concerns going forward.
Ryan Condal confirmed (via TV Line) that House of the Dragon season 2 would not feature any time jumps and that the cast would remain as it was. He explained &ldquo;The actors are playing these characters until the end. We’re not recasting anybody.&rdquo; He went on to explain that the groundwork laid in season 1 with the younger years of these characters was necessary, but with the story in full wing, &ldquo;We are now in the Dance of the Dragons, and we’re going to tell that story.&rdquo;
While it is reassuring that the plan is to keep the cast that is on the show now, Condal obviously cannot say for a certainty that there will be no more recasting. Certainly, the Game of Thrones cast changes were not planned and House of the Dragon could encounter these same unforeseeable circumstances, from minor characters suddenly becoming important to actors becoming unavailable to return. However, the Game of Thrones cast changes didn&rsquo;t affect the show too negatively so House of the Dragon should be fine if it is able to maintain its core cast.
