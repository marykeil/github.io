## Literature Review
While watching a scene from Sister Wives season 18, Kody Brown says that one of his first three wives must take ownership of her actions.




A new sneak peek of Sister Wives Talk Back shows Kody Brown asking his first wife, Meri Brown, to take accountability for running their 32-year marriage. Kody and Meri got married in the early &#39;90s and soon welcomed Janelle and Christine into their family. All three wives lived harmoniously until Kody married his fourth wife, Robyn Brown. Meri, Janelle, and Christine started feeling jealous when Kody began spending more time with Robyn. When Meri stopped receiving love and care from Kody, she eventually fell in love with a catfish. Kody felt betrayed by Meri’s actions, and the couple formally ended their marriage in January 2023.




In a new preview of Sister Wives season 18&#39;s Talk Back, Kody reflects on his split from Meri. While watching his breakup scene with Meri, Kody says (via TLC), “She isn’t being accountable in her own way for the problems or the discussion in that marriage. The discussions we’ve had.”


 

Meri looks at the same breakup scene and defends herself by saying she “never blamed” Kody for her catfish scandal. Janelle supports Meri’s comment by calling out Kody’s statement. She says, “It’s so wild to me the way Kody changes the script or flips the script on Meri.” 


 Kody &amp; Meri&#39;s Sister Wives Relationship Explained 
          




Meri was Kody’s first wife, but the couple never shared a close bond. They got married in 1990, but Kody divorced Meri in 2014 and legally married Robyn to adopt her kids. After being deprived of love and support from Kody, Meri fell victim to a catfish scandal in 2015. The person she had an online relationship with turned out to be a woman. After the catfish scandal, Meri and Kody’s marriage deteriorated. The Brown family patriarch lost trust in his first wife and stopped having romantic feelings for her.

Kody feels that Meri isn’t taking responsibility for ruining her marriage with him. However, the couple’s relationship was broken before the catfish scandal. When Kody started spending more than two days a week with Robyn, he deprived Meri and the other wives of his time, love, and care. Unintentionally, he withdrew physically and emotionally from his first three marriages. He doesn’t deserve to sit back and call out Meri’s actions when he should be equally blamed for his failed marriage.




It’s high time Kody started taking ownership of his actions. During different seasons of Sister Wives, there have been many instances when Kody deflected and acted as a victim. He must self-reflect on how his three marriages failed when Robyn entered his life. He could even apologize to his first three wives because they had to survive emotional trauma when he couldn’t give them equal time and love. Most important, the Sister Wives cast member needs to sincerely make an apology to Meri for not meeting her emotional needs for years and inadvertently pushing her to have an affair.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
