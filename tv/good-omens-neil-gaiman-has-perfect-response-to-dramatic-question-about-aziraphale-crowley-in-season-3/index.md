# Good Omens Neil Gaiman Has Perfect Response To Dramatic Question About Aziraphale &amp; Crowley In Season 3


## SUMMARY 



  Good Omens creator Neil Gaiman jokes that in season 3, the characters Crowley and Aziraphale are &#34;barely in it&#34; and both get killed off.   Gaiman instead teases that season 3 will focus on a trio of rabbits who open a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in the big city.   Despite Gaiman&#39;s humorous suggestions, Crowley and Aziraphale are still likely to be central to the unfolding drama in season 3.

## Literature Review
Good Omens creator Neil Gaiman answers with the perfect response to dramatic questions about Aziraphale and Crowley&#39;s fate in season 3.




Good Omens creator and showrunner Neil Gaiman has provided a hilarious response to questions about Aziraphale&#39;s and Crowley’s fate in season 3. Based on the book of the same name Gaiman co-authored with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens season 2 followed an original story that picked up after the demon Crowley (David Tennant) and the angel Aziraphale (Michael Sheen) successfully averted the apocalypse. In a shocking moment, the Good Omens season 2 finale saw Tennant’s character reveal his true feelings toward his angelic counterpart, only to have the pair torn apart by Aziraphale’s new role as Heaven’s supreme archangel.




Recently, one fan reached out to Gaiman via his Tumblr account to ask whether the show’s leads will end up together during Good Omens season 3.

  

Responding with wit, Gaiman joked that Crowley and Aziraphale “are barely in it” and are both killed off during the events of the show’s final season. Instead, he quipped the show would focus on a trio of rabbits “who go to the big city to open a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.”


 Why Good Omens Season 3 May More  ly Mirror Season 1’s Tone 
          

Originally conceived as a limited series, when Prime Video announced that Good Omens would be returning for season 2 in 2021, the renewal surprised viewers. With season 1 covering the entirety of the original Good Omens book, there were initially some questions about where Gaiman would take the story without the benefit of working alongside his original collaborator. Thankfully, however, Gaiman later revealed that both authors had originally planned a sequel to their bestselling novel in the 1990s, with that story intended to eventually serve as the basis for a potential season 3.




                  What Aziraphale &amp; Crowley&#39;s Kiss Means For Good Omens Season 3   Aziraphale and Crowley finally act on their romantic feelings in the Good Omens season 2 finale, but what does this mean for the TV show next?    

Instead of wanting to head straight into that story, Gaiman developed the plot for season 2 as a bridge between the two pre-existing tales he had worked on with Pratchett. Despite his dedication to remaining faithful to the late Discworld author’s voice, there were still several key departures throughout Good Omens season 2 to the format and tone that was established in season 1. Not only moving away from Frances McDormand’s God as the show’s narrative voice, season 2 also followed a much smaller story, allowing for a greater focus on the two leads.

However, with Pratchett having been directly involved in developing the story behind Good Omens season 3 and Gaiman confirming that it will feature another apocalypse, the show may also see a similar return to other major season elements. Whether that may also hint at a potential return of characters like Adria Arjona’s Anathema Device and Jack Whitehall’s Newton Pulsifer remains to be seen. Nonetheless, both Crowley and Aziraphale are still likely to be front and center of the unfolding drama, despite Gaiman’s hilarious suggestions to the contrary.
