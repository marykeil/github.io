The Golden Bachelor contestant and fan favorite Ellen Goltzer fell in love with leading man Gerry Turner, but he didn&#39;t choose her, so Ellen deserves a second chance at love as the first leading lady of The Golden Bachelorette. Ellen is a 71-year-old retired teacher from Delray Beach, Florida. On premiere night, she opened up about her best friend of 60 years, Roberta, who encouraged her to apply for the show, but has since passed away from cancer. Ellen later told Gerry that she met her husband at camp in the Catskills when they were ten years old. Their relationship lasted 25 years. Ellen has two sons.




On The Golden Bachelor episode 3, Gerry chose Ellen for a one-on-one date. During this so-called Pretty Woman date, Ellen received a beautiful dress from fashion designer Michael Costello, shoes, and jewelry. Gerry gave Ellen a pair of earrings. They then went on a hot air balloon ride, during which their connection became even deeper, and they shared a kiss. Within the next few weeks, Ellen told Gerry that she was falling in love with him. However, he eventually decided to eliminate her. Ellen should now become the first star of The Golden Bachelorette.
