  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Frozen&rsquo;s
success can be attributed to Disney&rsquo;s clever marketing strategy that appealed to a wider demographic than in the past.
Spider-Man: No Way Home
benefited from the buzz and anticipation surrounding which actors would be appearing in the film.
The long-awaited sequels of
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
,
Incredibles 2
, and
Top Gun: Maverick
all saw financial success due to the anticipation built up over the years.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>We just knew that movies like The Force Awakens, Infinity War, or Barbie would be a success before they released, due to the hype surrounding them.</p>
<p>Many movies in cinematic history were given so much attention prior to release that everyone knew they were going to be box office hits. New installments in popular franchises can generally expect a good turnout, while long-awaited sequels benefit from years, sometimes decades of anticipation. These circumstances have contributed to some of the biggest movie events in recent memory, including the premieres of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Infinity War.
However, there were some more unique scenarios that gave people the sense that a movie would be a financial success. Frozen&rsquo;s success is partially due to Disney&rsquo;s clever marketing strategy, while Spider-Man: No Way Home benefited from unanswered questions about which actors would be appearing. More recently, the Barbenheimer phenomenon was one of the strangest movie events ever, which undeniably increased the profits of both movies.</p>
<p>10 Box Office Records That Will Likely Never Be Broken
Though breaking a record at the box office is rarely the ultimate goal of a film, it can help cement a movie or filmmaker as a great success.</p>
<p>9  Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)
Domestic Gross: $381 Million | Worldwide Total: $1.4 Billion</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2<br>
PG-13
Adventure
Family
Fantasy
Mystery</p>
<p>The conclusion to the film franchise based on the popular novel series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 centers on Harry and his allies as they prepare for the final battle against Lord Voldemort. The film follows Harry, Hermoine, and Ron as they continue to track down and destroy the Horcruxes to destroy Voldemort, all while the dark wizard approaches ever closer to Hogwarts with his army of followers.</p>
<p>Release Date    July 7, 2011     Director    David Yates     Cast    Daniel Radcliffe , Rupert Grint , Emma Watson , Helena Bonham Carter , Robbie Coltrane , Warwick Davis , Ralph Fiennes , Michael Gambon , John Hurt , Jason Isaacs , Gary Oldman , Alan Rickman     Runtime    130 Minutes</p>
<p>Unlike with The Hunger Games and Divergent, the Harry Potter franchise did not start to decline until after the series was well and truly over. The final movie in the decade-long series that showed most of its main cast growing up in real time was a massive event. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 remained in theaters for many weeks after its initial release. It was predictably a financial success given the 10 years of anticipation leading up to it and the steady box office profits of the movies that came before it.
All box office numbers are according to boxofficemojo.com.</p>
<p>8  Incredibles 2 (2018)
Domestic Gross: $608 MIllion | Worldwide Total: $1.2 Billion</p>
<p>The Incredibles 2<br>
PG
Adventure
Action
Animation</p>
<p>The sequel to Pixar&rsquo;s The Incredibles, Incredibles 2 follows the Parr family as they continue to fight crime as Supers. In a world that has only recently rediscovered its need for superpowered heroes, building trust is key. However, when Elastigirl uncovers a villainous plot to discredit the Super community, the family investigates, putting the Parrs in more danger than ever before. </p>
<p>Release Date    June 15, 2018     Director    Brad Bird     Cast    Sarah Vowell , Samuel L. Jackson , Holly Hunter , Craig T. Nelson , John Ratzenberger , Catherine Keener , Huck Milner , Bob Odenkirk     Runtime    2h 6m</p>
<p>The gap of nearly 15 years between the first and second Incredibles movies only gave fans time to appreciate the original more. The Incredibles could have had a sequel closer to when it first came out, as was the case with Toy Story 2. However, Pixar’s movies are not generally weighed down by common legacy sequel problems, since the settings are not too complex.
When the announcement for Incredibles 2 came, there were not as many concerns about the sequel “ruining” the original. Now grown-up fans came to movie theaters in droves, ready to see their favorite superhero family in action again. Additionally, the Father’s Day weekend release date contributed to Incredibles 2’s marketing of being a fun movie for the whole family.</p>
<p>7  The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)
Domestic Gross: $303 Million | Worldwide Total: $1 Billion</p>
<p>After Guillermo del Toro’s initial two-movie plan for The Hobbit was canceled, it was reinvented to be three longer movies. The trilogy desperately wanted to be a new The Lord of the Rings but was ultimately a dragged-out version of a relatively short book. However, no matter how the Hobbit movies turned out, fans were at least excited about the first movie, which was unsurprisingly a box office hit. The trailer advertised the return of Peter Jackson and veteran Lord of the Rings actors Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchette, and Andy Serkis, with chillingly nostalgic musical accompaniment.</p>
<p>6  Top Gun: Maverick (2022)
Domestic Gross: $718 Million | Worldwide Total: $1.5 Billion</p>
<p>Top Gun: Maverick<br>
PG-13
Action</p>
<p>Top Gun: Maverick is the sequel to the 1986 original film starring Tom Cruise as Pete &ldquo;Maverick&rdquo; Mitchell, a top-tier pilot in the Navy. Thirty years after the original film&rsquo;s events, Maverick is asked to head up a section of the TOP GUN program to embark on a dangerous mission. Things become personal when the program includes the son of Maverick&rsquo;s late friend, forcing him to confront his past.</p>
<p>Release Date    May 27, 2022     Director    Joseph Kosinski     Cast    Jennifer Connelly , Jake Picking , Raymond Lee , Tom Cruise , Lewis Pullman , Monica Barbaro , Miles Teller , Danny Ramirez , Val Kilmer , Manny Jacinto , Ed Harris , Glen Powell , Jon Hamm     Runtime    130 minutes</p>
<p>Top Gun: Maverick is another sequel that could have plausibly happened a long time ago. Yet it didn’t come out until more than 35 years after the original and therefore got the box office bonus of being a long-awaited sequel. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer were the only members of the original cast to appear. However, the movie’s promotion made it clear that Miles Teller would be playing Goose’s son, meaning that Maverick’s friendship with Goose would still be important to the story.</p>
<p>8 Movies We&rsquo;re Worried About At The 2024 Box Office
2024 promises to be a big year for the global box office with several major releases from every studio, but some films may struggle to turn a profit.</p>
<p>5  Frozen (2013)
Domestic Gross: $401 Million | Worldwide Total: $1.4 Billion</p>
<p>Frozen<br>
PG
Animation
Adventure
Comedy</p>
<p>In this animated Disney musical, the newly crowned Queen Elsa accidentally uses her power to turn things into ice to curse her home in infinite winter. Her younger sister, Anna, teams up with a mountain man, his playful reindeer, and a living snowman to change the weather conditions and restore peace.</p>
<p>Release Date    November 27, 2013     Director    Chris Buck , Jennifer Lee     Cast    Edie McClurg , Kristen Bell , Santino Fontana , Idina Menzel , Robert Pine , Maurice LaMarche , Jonathan Groff , Stephen J. Anderson , Alan Tudyk , Josh Gad , Ciarán Hinds , Chris Williams     Runtime    102 minutes</p>
<p>Frozen set itself apart from other Disney Princess movies from the beginning. Forbes argues that Disney’s marketing for Frozen was effective because it didn’t highlight the princesses. Early trailers focused on humorous moments with Olaf and Sven, making the movie appealing to a bigger demographic than only young girls. Girls still wanted to see it because it was still pitched as a Disney Princess movie, but generally more people were interested in it.
When the movie premiered, the snowball effect (pun intended) took off, and word-of-mouth did the rest. Frozen’s marketing laid the foundation, and it quickly gained traction for being the first Disney Princess movie with two heroines – one of which had no love interest – and focusing on the relationship between the sisters rather than a young woman and her Prince Charming.</p>
<p>4  Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)
Domestic Gross: $814 Million | Worldwide Total: $1.9 Billion</p>
<p>Tom Holland was immediately popular when he stepped into the role of Peter Parker, and his first two solo MCU movies received generally positive reviews. However, Spider-Man: No Way Home’s box office success was also driven by behind-the-scenes details that fans could not stop talking about. Early on, the cast list confirmed that the villains from the two previous live-action Spider-Man franchises would be appearing.
However, the coup de grâce was the now-infamous debate over if/how Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield would appear. Spider-Man: No Way Home was set up to be a box office success because of the constant attention it got from various media outlets. Everyone would go see it, if for no other reason, to confirm that they were right about Maguire and Garfield.</p>
<p>3  Barbie (2023)
Domestic Gross: $636 Million | Worldwide Total: $1.4 Billion</p>
<p>Barbie<br>
PG-13
Comedy
Adventure
Fantasy</p>
<p>Barbie is a film adaptation of the generational iconic toy directed by Greta Gerwig, who co-wrote the script with Noah Baumbach. The film centers on Margot Robbie&rsquo;s Barbie who is expelled from Barbieland and travels with Ken (Ryan Gosling) to the real world in search of happiness. The film also stars Simu Liu, Will Ferrell, and several other famous celebrities in cameo roles.</p>
<p>Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Greta Gerwig     Cast    Margot Robbie , Ryan Gosling , Simu Liu , Ariana Greenblatt , Helen Mirren , Nicola Coughlan , John Cena , Will Ferrell , Ritu Arya , Michael Cera , America Ferrera , Alexandra Shipp , Kate McKinnon     Runtime    114 Minutes</p>
<p>The lead-up to Barbenheimer will not be forgotten anytime soon. It was expected that both movies would be successful simply due to the public’s determination to compare them. However, Barbie had the potential to be the more typical box office hit. While both movies were able to boast an acclaimed cast and director/writer, Barbie had wider appeal. Its stars are also arguably more a part of mainstream pop culture. Barbie did end up grossing more than Oppenheimer (Oppenheimer came in just under the billion-dollar mark), although both movies were nominated for Best Picture.</p>
<p>10 Recent Movies That Were Bigger At The Box Office Than Anyone Expected
The only predictable thing about the box office is that it&rsquo;s unpredictable. These recent movies became smash hits seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>2  Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
Domestic Gross: $679 Million | Worldwide Total: $2 Billion</p>
<p>Avengers: Infinity War<br>
PG-13
Action
Sci-Fi
Superhero</p>
<p>Avengers: Infinity War is the third Avengers movie in the game-changing Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is positioned as the beginning of the culmination of everything that has transpired in the franchise to date. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who previously helmed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Civil War, have assembled the largest ensemble in a superhero film to date. Nearly every living character in the MCU is included as the Avengers join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down Thanos in a battle that has massive repercussions for the future of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. A sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was released in 2019 and marked the end of the Infinity Saga.</p>
<p>Release Date    April 27, 2018     Director    Joe Russo , Anthony Russo     Cast    Chris Hemsworth , Anthony Mackie , Elizabeth Olsen , Robert Downey Jr. , Scarlett Johansson , Mark Ruffalo , Sebastian Stan , Paul Rudd , Chadwick Boseman , Don Cheadle , Samuel L. Jackson , Josh Brolin , Tom Holland , Evangeline Lilly , Paul Bettany , Chris Evans , Jeremy Renner     Runtime    149 minutes</p>
<p>The earliest trailers for Avengers: Infinity War promised that it would be a superhero movie like no other. All the previous MCU movies would converge for what fans understood to be the beginning of the finale. It was going to dominate the box office no matter what, but the first teaser skillfully hypes it up even more. The veteran Avengers collectively reciting the description of the Avengers Initiative and the tease/confirmation of the Guardians of the Galaxy at the end contributed to anticipation for the first part of the movie event of the decade.</p>
<p>1  Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)
Domestic Gross: $936 Million | Worldwide Total: $2 Billion</p>
<p>Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens<br>
PG-13
Action
Adventure
Fantasy
Sci-Fi</p>
<p>Set 30 years after Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: The Force Awakens teams new heroes Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who is now a General in the Rebel Alliance. Together they try to track down Luke Skywalker while battling the First Order, led by the villainous Kylo Ren. The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film to be produced by Disney and was directed by JJ Abrams.</p>
<p>Release Date    December 17, 2015     Director    J.J. Abrams     Cast    Daisy Ridley , John Boyega , Oscar Isaac , Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill , Carrie Fisher , Adam Driver , Andy Serkis , Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o , Max Von Sydow , Peter Mayhew ,  Simon Pegg     Runtime    136 Minutes</p>
<p>Before the Star Wars sequel trilogy’s problems became apparent, the lead-up to the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a historic moment in Hollywood. The Star Wars fandom is timeless and would come out in force for the return of one of the biggest franchises of all time. The marketing advertised the return of the main cast along with elements reminiscent of the original trilogy, as opposed to the shiny CGI world of the prequels. The Force Awakens is probably the most guaranteed box office hit of the past decade.</p>
