## Literature Review

The White Lotus season 4 has seemingly been confirmed by HBO boss Casey Bloys before season 3 of the HBO anthology series has even begun filming.




Long before season 3&#39;s premiere, The White Lotus season 4 has seemingly been confirmed by HBO boss Casey Bloys. Originally intended as a limited series, the show&#39;s success led to HBO renewing it as an anthology following the exploits of various guests and employees at the eponymous resort chain, with each season set in a different luxurious locale. The White Lotus season 3, which will be set in Thailand, has set most of its main cast and is set to start shooting soon.




Talking to Variety after the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, where the show took home one award, Bloys seemingly confirmed plans for The White Lotus season 4. The HBO boss says he likes creator Mike White&#39;s formula for connecting each season with a returning cast member and is &#34;excited&#34; to see &#34;who is going to come back for Season 4.&#34; Read his full comment below:


Iâ€™m already excited about who is going to come back for Season 4. It really is a fun model that Mike has set up.


                  The White Lotus&#39; Domination In One Emmys Category Is Truly Ridiculous   The White Lotus has completely dominated one category of 2023 Emmy nominations, but stiff competition from other acclaimed series could pose a threat.   


 Who Could Return For The White Lotus Season 4 
          

So far, the show&#39;s returning characters have all been from The White Lotus season 1. The quirky Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) and her deceitful husband Greg (Jon Gries) returned for the second season, though Tanya&#39;s death during The White Lotus season 2 ending seemingly rules out the possibility of future returns. The upcoming White Lotus season 3 will bring back Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), the resort&#39;s empathetic and spiritual spa manager from season 1.




If the anthology series continues following this format, The White Lotus season 4 would bring back a different character from season 1. Rachel and her husband Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) are a few characters that immediately come to mind, especially since actress Alexandra Daddario expressed interest in returning to The White Lotus:



I love working with Mike [White]. I&#39;d always go back if it made sense and he had a good idea. I just want to see what he has in store. He&#39;s such a genius and everything is so wild and you never know what to expect. I just want to see more of the same.




Olivia Mossbacher is another character from season 1 that audiences would love to see return, as actor Sydney Sweeney has since become a big movie star with lead roles in Anyone But You and the upcoming Madame Web. No matter who returns for The White Lotus season 4, it&#39;s clear that HBO is interested in continuing the series for as long as creator Mike White wants.



The White Lotus season 3 is expected to premiere on HBO in 2025.
