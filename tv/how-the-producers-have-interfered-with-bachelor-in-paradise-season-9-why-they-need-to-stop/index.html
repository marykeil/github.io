The Paradise Truth Box sessions seemed forced and fake, painting certain contestants as villains and causing unnecessary drama.   Katie Thurston&rsquo;s Comedy Roast was cruel, causing public embarrassment and hurt feelings for the contestants involved.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>In the past, Bachelor in Paradise has led to many successful relationships, but can the season 9 couples survive the producers&rsquo; manipulations?</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise season 9 has been full of romance, but it&rsquo;s also had a lot of drama thanks to the interference and manipulation of the producers. Bachelor in Paradise season 9 features cast-offs from previous Bachelor and Bachelorette seasons, primarily contestants from Zach Shallcross and Charity Lawson&rsquo;s seasons. Former Bachelorette Rachel Recchia also is looking for another chance in Mexico, along with several of her former suitors. In addition, Blake Moynes, who appeared on Clare Crawley and Tayshia Adams&rsquo; season, and then got engaged to Katie Thurston on hers, is back to try his luck on the beach.</p>
<p>Throughout Bachelor in Paradise season 9, the producers have found ways to throw a wrench into developing relationships on the beach. As if having contestants come and go on a regular basis isn&rsquo;t enough, they&rsquo;ve introduced elements such as the Paradise Truth Box and had former Bachelorettes come to the beach to engage the contestants in activities that force them to reveal information. Here are three ways that the producers have interfered with Bachelor in Paradise season 9, and why they need to stop.</p>
<p>: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now</p>
<p>The Paradise Truth Box
Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 Episodes 4 &amp; 8</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise season 9 bartender Wells Adams introduced the Paradise Truth Box early in the season. He explained that the contestants could write anonymous messages and place them in the box to be revealed later. As Wells told the contestants about the box, Aaron Schwartzman made a big show of wanting to get straight to the point and dramatically smashing the box open. It was a cringeworthy moment because it appeared to be so scripted.</p>
<p>That Paradise Truth Box session had many anonymous warnings about Kat Izzo playing Brayden Bowers, and how Tanner should watch out for her, which were most likely written by Aaron S. This led to an intense confrontation between him and Kat. Kat did leave Brayden for Tanner, but isn&rsquo;t exploring connections what Paradise is all about? The Truth Box scenes seemed designed to continue to paint Kat as the villain that the producers tried to make her out to be during Zach&rsquo;s Bachelor season. However, they just seemed forced and fake.</p>
<p>The Paradise Truth Box reared its ugly head again later in the season, this time targeting Tyler Norris, but hurting Mercedes Northup in the process. Someone wrote an anonymous message that read, &ldquo;Tyler, everyone knows you&rsquo;re not that into Mercedes. You better come clean &lsquo;cause she deserves the truth.&rdquo; Tyler seemed unfazed by the revelation, but Mercedes was very concerned. Their relationship now seems headed for a breakup. Although Mercedes should know the truth if Tyler is indeed playing her, she didn&rsquo;t have to find out so publicly and feel embarrassed on top of heartbroken.</p>
<p>Hannah Brown’s Burning Questions Bonfire
Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 Episode 2</p>
<p>Former Bachelorette Hannah Brown arrived on the beach in one of the most bizarre segments ever to air on Bachelor in Paradise. Hannah held a bonfire in which the contestants were forced to answer burning questions about each other. As the contestants were brutally honest with each other, feelings were hurt. There was no reason that the contestants should&rsquo;ve had to bare their souls like that.</p>
<p>For example, Kat and Brayden revealed that they could see a future with each other. Although Brayden said he only wanted to date Kat, she admitted that she might be interested in Tyler or Tanner. In addition, Blake said that he was open to possibly making connections with other women on the beach, which upset his current relationship partner, Jess Girod. These were just two examples of the many truths that were told. For contestants in their 20s and 30s, it seemed like a middle school game, and created unnecessary drama. Some truths are better kept to oneself.</p>
<p>: Bachelor In Paradise Season 9: Every Potential Spoiler Revealed So Far</p>
<p>Katie Thurston’s Comedy Roast
Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 Episode 8</p>
<p>The worst example of Bachelor in Paradise producer interference came from Katie&rsquo;s appearance on the show. For starters, it was the first time that she and Blake had spoken since ending their engagement two years ago. There was absolutely no reason for Katie, who had no intention of dating anyone on the beach, to come to Paradise and disrupt Blake&rsquo;s experience. Their conversation should have been private. It felt as though Katie and the producers were exploiting Blake.</p>
<p>The second part of Katie&rsquo;s appearance was also unnecessary and cruel. She hosted a Comedy Roast, in which the contestants mocked each other. While some of the barbs made the contestants laugh, there were a few jabs that were unexpected and just plain mean. Once again, Mercedes was publicly embarrassed when Tyler joked, &ldquo;Mercedes thinks she&rsquo;s a Mercedes. But she&rsquo;s more like a [expletive].&rdquo; Aaron Bryant added that Tyler was more committed to getting his ear pierced than in his last two weeks with Mercedes.</p>
<p>In addition, after Rachel and Tanner had a heartfelt conversation in which they agreed that they wanted to try to make their relationship work, Tanner decided to insult Rachel in front of everyone at the roast. He said, &ldquo;We were all really, really excited when we found out that there was gonna be an ex-Bachelorette on the beach, and obviously we were really hoping for Gabby, but we got Rachel.&rdquo; This understandably upset Rachel very much. A roast is only funny when everyone is having a good time, and this event was too harsh, and left people with hurt feelings for no reason other than the producers wanted to cause drama.</p>
<p>: Bachelor In Paradise Season 9: Are Eliza Isichei &amp; Aaron Bryant Still Together? (Spoilers)</p>
<p>Bachelor In Paradise Relationships Can’t Thrive In These Situations
Bachelor in Paradise Season 7 Was A Success, But Bachelor in Paradise Season 8 Was A Failure</p>
<p>Like Bachelor in Paradise season 8, which separated couples during the Split House twist, season 9 has caused unneeded conflict. For a show that expects people to get engaged after only about two and a half weeks of knowing each other, the producers should take more of a hands-off approach. Bachelor in Paradise season 7, which had hardly any producer manipulation, led to three couples&ndash;Serena Pitt and Joe Amabile, Mari Pepin and Kenny Braasch, and Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs&ndash;getting married after the show, and Abigial Heringer and Noah Erb eventually getting engaged. In addition Alana Milne and Chris Conran are still together and dating.</p>
<p>However, Bachelor in Paradise season 8, which had more producer interference than any other season, has no couples who are still together. Serene Russell and Brandon Jones got engaged during the finale, but eventually split up, while Danielle Maltby and Michael Allio, who left as a couple, but not engaged, also broke up. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that when the producers manipulate the show, the success rate is much lower. The Bachelor in Paradise season 9 couples need more time to explore their relationships and less time participating in childish activities that only cause needless drama.</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise season 9 has several couples with the potential to get engaged at the end of the season, including Kylee Russell and Aven Jones, Eliza Isichei and Aaron B., Kat and John Henry Spurlock, and Sam Picco and Peter Cappio. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that these couples haven&rsquo;t been at the center of the conflict created by the producers&rsquo; manipulation. Hopefully, the seemingly scripted drama will stop now that the season is wrapping up, and the remaining Bachelor in Paradise season 9 couples will be able to fall in love in peace.</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.</p>
