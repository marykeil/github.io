## Literature Review
Love Is Blind season 1 kicked off a hit Netflix franchise. Here&#39;s what to know about the original contestants.




Love Is Blind season 1 was incredibly popular, and here&#39;s everything to know about the inaugural cast members. While fans patiently wait for Love Is Blind season 6, they regularly check up on cast members from previous seasons. Over five seasons, there have been great Love Is Blind couples and disastrous relationships that make for excellent reality TV. While Love Is Blind season 5 was a letdown, season 4 produced some of the best couples yet. For example, Bliss Poureetezadi and Zack Goytowski are having the first Love Is Blind baby.
The original Love Is Blind cast members remain in the public eye, but fans may need a reminder since the show was filmed five years ago. Since they became media personalities, fans can learn everything they need to know about them, including zodiac signs, ages, relationship statuses, and heights. Love Is Blind season 1 cast members had varying outcomes, and it&#39;s time to check in on them.









 








 1  Jessica Batten 
Cancer, 38, Married, 5&#39;8
        

Jessica Batten was born on June 26, 1985, which makes her a 35-year-old Cancer. She&#39;s one of the oldest cast members from season 1, which she constantly reminded her ex-fiancé Mark of and the entire audience. Jessica had some bad moments on Love Is Blind when it came to love but has since found love in the arms of a foot surgeon, Dr. Benjamin McGrath. She gave birth to a son, Dax, in June 2023.





 2  Giannina Gibelli 
Aries, 30, In A Relationship, 5&#39;3


 







The fact that Giannina Milady is an Aries shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise. After all, she is feisty, passionate, and also aggressive. Born on April 3, 1993, Giannina is 30 years old. Despite dating former fiance Damian Powers after the show, they later broke up. Giannina is having a baby with The Bachelorette alum Blake Horstmann, with whom she&#39;s been in a relationship for a couple of years.





 3  Kenny Barnes 
Aries, 31, Married, 5&#39;9
        

In Love is Blind, Kenny Barnes matched up with Kelly Chase, but since she rejected him at the altar, he has moved on and found love with Alexandra Garrison. The charming bachelor went down on one knee and popped the question in August 2020. The two are now happily married.
Kenny turned 31 at the end of March, which makes him an Aries. His zodiac sign comes as a bit of a surprise. After all, his relationship with Kelly was the only wholly drama-free relationship. The fiery rams aren&#39;t typically the most patient and agreeable people!





 4  Mark Cuevas 
Pisces, 29, Married, 5&#39;8
        

Mark instantly became a fan-favorite, but unfortunately, his better half, Jessica, wasn&#39;t that fond of this sensitive Piscean. Since the show wrapped up, Mark has become a father and tied the knot with baby mama Aubrey Ann Cuevas. The two welcomed another child in March 2022. Mark might be the shortest male cast member of the squad, but he probably has the biggest heart. Pisces signs are known for boundless love, potentially to their detriment.





 5  Amber Pike 
Aries, 31, Married, 5&#39;8


 







Amber Pike turned 31 in April and has been enjoying married life since the show wrapped up. Despite the hate, she&#39;s living her best life with her husband Matt Barnett. At the reunion, she admitted she and Barnett almost got divorced at one point. There&#39;s no doubt that there&#39;s a lot of passion between them, and they&#39;ve been enjoying life away from cameras since tying the knot on reality TV, having recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary.





 6  Matthew Barnett 
Libra/Scorpio, 32, Married, 5&#39;10
        

Barnett is a year and a half older than his wife, Amber. He was born on October 23rd, which makes him a Libra if he was born in the earlier half of the day or a Scorpio if he was born in the afternoon. He identifies as a Scorpio, but he must be a Libra since he was one of the most indecisive cast members in the pods. However, he&#39;s stuck with Amber for over five years.





 7  Damian Powers 
Pisces, 32, Single, 5&#39;9


 







Damian Powers has become a controversial reality TV star since appearing on Love Is Blind. Since the show wrapped up, he&#39;s starred in Perfect Match season 1, where he rekindled an old flame with Too Hot To Handle&#39;s Francesca Farago. Unfortunately, his behavior on the show sealed his fate as a reality TV villain. He is single as of 2023.





 8  Kelly Chase 
Leo, 38, 5&#39;6
        

No wonder Kenny and Kelly instantly bonded on Love is Blind: they are both fire signs! The 35-year-old is among the oldest cast members and the only Leo on the show. She&#39;s about raising awareness about mental health issues and mindfulness and living a single life as of 2023.





 9  Diamond Jack 
Sagittarius, 32, Single, 5&#39;5
        

Another fiery lady with no other fellow zodiac representative is Diamond Jack, the charismatic Sagittarius who left the show in Mexico after a massive fallout with Carlton. She is the CEO of the Lady Box and is currently happily single. Diamond also starred in Perfect Match season 1 but didn&#39;t meaningfully connect with anyone.





 10  Lauren Speed Hamilton 
Scorpio, 36, Married, 5&#39;7
        

Besides Amber, Lauren is the only woman who entered the show looking for a husband and got one by the end of it. The 36-year-old Scorpio is one of the most famous cast members of season 1 and has fully harnessed the exposure that the show provided. Not only did she launch a YouTube show with her husband, Hanging With The Hamiltons, but they also co-authored a book called Leap of Faith: Finding Love the Modern Way. The two recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary and are considered the pinnacle of Love Is Blind success.





 11  Carlton Morton 
Scorpio, 39, Single, 5&#39;6
        

Just like Lauren, Carlton is a Scorpio, too. He&#39;s among the shorter cast members, but he fully compensated for it with his charm and wit. He left the show early on and has since kept his private life on the down-low. There are no indications of him being in a serious relationship. After all, Scorpios tend to be secretive.





 12  Cameron Hamilton 
Cancer, 32, Married, 6&#39;
        

While some contestants were a letdown as Love Is Blind season 1 progressed, Cameron only got better. This shy Cancer needed some time to come out of his shell, but once he did, he showed just how deep his love for Lauren was. Nobody loves a Scorpio as much as a Cancer, so it&#39;s no wonder they made it last with such effortless ease. He is 6 feet tall and the tallest cast member from season 1.
