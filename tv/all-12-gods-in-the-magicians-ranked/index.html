<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While all the gods in Syfy&rsquo;s The Magicians play an important role in the plot, some are much more likable, kind, and well-behaved than the others.</p>
<p>Summary
The gods in The Magicians are flawed and often selfish, cruel, or cowardly, treating others poorly or disregarding their well-being.
Some gods, like Prometheus and Julia Wicker, stand out as compassionate and use their powers to help others, while others, like Clarion and Aengus, are more self-serving and lacking in empathy.
While Nameless and Nameless&rsquo; sister may cause harm due to their child-like mentality, they cannot be judged in the same way as other gods, as they lack the ability for emotional regulation and hypothetical thinking.</p>
<p>Throughout The Magicians, the gods play a central role in the plot, but not every god is as good as the others. Syfy’s The Magicians follows a group of graduate students attending the magical Breakbills University. Across five seasons, they interact with a number of gods who all have different personalities. The gods are important to the story because they grant Magicians access to magic, using it as a tool to control their behavior. Additionally, gods like Reynard the Fox, Bacchus, and Nameless interact directly with humans.
While some of the gods care about less powerful beings, most are selfish, cruel, or cowardly. They treat others poorly or completely disregard others’ well-being. These flaws make the gods in The Magicians fascinating. Additionally, the human-like quality of these omnipotent beings allows the gods to be ranked based on criteria like their behavior, treatment of others, and likability.</p>
<p>Where To Watch The Magicians Seasons 1-5<br>
The Magicians is a captivating fantasy show that is full of magic and mystery. Here&rsquo;s where the popular Syfy original series can be streamed.</p>
<p>13 Prometheus, The Creator Of The Seven Keys
Appearances: The Magicians Season 3, Episode 13, &ldquo;Will You Play With Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he only appears in The Magicians’ season 3 finale, Prometheus is by far the best and most compassionate god in the series. Despite the way that most gods thought, he truly believed in the good in people. As such, he created a fail-safe so that humans could access magic even if the gods decided to abandon them. This thoughtfulness and optimism really set him apart from the other gods in The Magicians. The fact that he selflessly laid down his life for humans, gaining nothing in return, gives him the number one spot over even Julia.</p>
<p>12 Julia Wicker, “Our Lady Of The Tree”
Appearances: 15 Episodes In The Magicians Seasons 1 To 5</p>
<p>After Persephone puts Reynard’s spark in Julia, she grows the power until she reaches goddess status, making her one of The Magicians&rsquo; most powerful characters. Unlike every other god except Prometheus, Julia consistently uses her powers to help others, making her one of the best gods.
However, in contrast with Prometheus, she isn’t consciously doing good acts with her powers. The power comes out of her when she has a strong emotional reaction, like when she removes Skye’s collar. Additionally, when she finally does knowingly use her powers for the good of others, it’s to repair the destruction that she caused, making her slightly less noble.
While Julia appears in 65 episodes, she is only god-touched for 15 of those episodes.</p>
<p>11 Iris, The Messenger Goddess
Appearances: 2 Episodes In The Magicians Seasons 3 And 4</p>
<p>When Julia becomes a goddess at the end of The Magicians season 3, she’s welcomed by Iris, a goddess who seems kind and creative. She has a passion for creating worlds which gives her a softer humanity not found in most of the gods. While she’s emotionally removed from humans like the other gods, she seems to have some empathy for them, committing miracles to boost human morale. However, she shows a meaner side towards human Magicians when put under the stress of stopping Nameless. Despite her harsher moments, Iris is still one of the best gods in The Magicians.</p>
<p>10 Bacchus, The God Of Revelry
Appearances: 3 Episodes In The Magicians Seasons 3 And 4</p>
<p>Throughout The Magicians seasons 3 and 4, Bacchus is a god who’s perfectly nice to humans as long as they amuse him and want to party. He’s willing to provide Magicians with some iota of magic when the Plumber shuts off their access, but he limits it to magic that will benefit him. In the same vein, he’s willing to give humans drugs and alcohol since it will keep his party going. However, unlike many of the other lower gods, Bacchus fully rejects the Old Gods, calling them “imperious and distant d*ckwads.” This moral stance makes Baccus better than most of the other gods in The Magicians.</p>
<p>9 Hades, The God Of The Underworld
Appearances: 2 Episodes In The Magicians Seasons 3 And 5</p>
<p>Of all the gods shown in The Magicians, Hades is quite reasonable and caring. He has a warm but pragmatic way of speaking to others, making him extremely likable. What’s more, he really seems to want the underworld to be a pleasant, peaceful place. He doesn’t seem to have the same emotional distance from humans with which other gods struggle. These aspects of Hades make him better than most other gods.</p>
<p>9 The Magicians Spinoffs That Could Even Be Better Than The Original TV Show<br>
While the original TV show went over exceptionally well, many spinoffs of Syfy&rsquo;s dark fantasy series The Magicians could perform even better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he cannot rank among the best, though, because of one massive issue. Hades is the stepfather of Reynard the Fox. While it’s never explicitly stated whether Hades knows that his stepson is raping and murdering women, it’s probable that he had some awareness due to his power and reach. In this case, remaining impartial and silent on the matter makes him culpable in horrific atrocities.</p>
<p>8 Clarion, The Goddess Of Melody
Appearances: The Magicians Season 4, Episode 5, &ldquo;Magicians Anonymous&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the gods in The Magicians are selfish, and Clarion is no exception. She’s only willing to grant miracles in exchange for something equally beneficial to her. Clarion has no compassion for Julia’s conflicting desires, forcing her to choose between saving the world and the person she loves. Yet, there’s one endearing and redeeming quality to Clarion. While she doesn’t have much humanity, she wants it. She understands that there’s so much beauty in being human and appreciating the small things in life. Sadly, she’s just incapable of experiencing it herself without the help of the Binder.</p>
<p>7 Nameless, The Castle Blackspire Monster</p>
<p>One of the most dangerous and feared god characters in The Magicians is Nameless. This monster has an unimaginable amount of power combined with the mental capacity of a child, making him destructive when he’s upset or bored. He doesn’t hesitate to go on a killing spree when he’s throwing a tantrum. These actions out of context would make him one of the worst gods in The Magicians, only barely ranking above Reynard the Fox; however, this title would be wildly unfair.
Despite Nameless’ actions, he can’t be judged in the same way as most of the other gods. Considering his child-like mental capacity, he doesn’t have the ability to emotionally regulate himself or rationalize effectively. He does cause harm to others, but it isn’t necessarily from a place of manipulation, as that requires hypothetical thinking skills that Nameless doesn’t have. Instead, Nameless is simply trying to get his needs met.</p>
<p>6 Nameless’ Sister, The Disembodied God
Appearances: 2 Episodes In The Magicians Season 4</p>
<p>Like Nameless, Nameless’ sister is a child god with unfathomable power in The Magicians. While she has slightly more mental capacity than her brother, she still is extremely immature in her way of thinking. She gets angry and decides to lash out at the people who make her angry. There’s no deeper level of thought that would change this from a basic reaction to revenge. Considering this and her childlike state, she can’t be held to the same standard as other gods. She isn’t well-behaved, but she is far from the worst god in the Magicians.</p>
<p>1 Crucial Thing Made The Magicians Different (&amp; Smarter) Than Every Other Fantasy Show<br>
Magic is treated differently–and far darker and more dangerous–in The Magicians, and it&rsquo;s what sets it apart from other fantasy TV shows.</p>
<p>5 Aengus, The Trickster God
Appearances: 2 Episodes In The Magicians Season 4</p>
<p>The Magicians season 4 introduces multiple previously unknown gods, including Aengus. The Celtic trickster god is a coward first and foremost, disguising himself as the god Enyalius in order to stay hidden from Nameless. While self-preservation isn’t a bad thing, Aengus puts another living god at risk, unlike Bacchus who pretends to be a dead god. This alone wouldn’t make him bad – only pathetic. However, the god’s sadism makes him one of the worst gods in The Magicians. The show provides a glimpse into the past, which shows Aengus excitedly preparing to sacrifice a girl with no signs of hesitation.</p>
<p>4 Umber, The Fillorian God Of Order
Appearances: 3 Episodes In The Magicians Seasons 2 and 4</p>
<p>Of the two Fillorian gods, Umber is the lesser of two evils; however, that bar is extremely low. Umber makes a deal with the Beast, faking his death and going into exile. This prevents the Beast from killing him. What’s extremely disturbing about Umber’s choice is that he has no issue leaving Martin Chatwin to wreak havoc on the people and world he helped create. His cowardice and selfishness ultimately allow the Beast to gain control over Fillory and the Wellspring. As such, Umber is one of the worst gods throughout The Magicians.</p>
<p>3 Ember, The Fillorian God Of Chaos
Appearances: 5 Episodes Between The Magicians Season 1 and 5</p>
<p>Throughout The Magicians, Ember is one of the most odious characters, coming across as obnoxious and manipulative. He makes decisions based on what will entertain him the most, no matter how it will impact others. Rather than offering any empathy, Ember banishes Martin Chatwin from Fillory because the god gets tired of watching the child after he becomes depressed due to experiencing repeated sexual assault. This shows a whole other level of depravity for Ember. Additionally, he’s willing to kill an entire world of people and creatures simply because he grows bored.</p>
<p>2 Persephone, “Our Lady Underground”
Appearances: 6 Episodes Between The Magicians Seasons 1 And 4</p>
<p>While many of the gods in The Magicians do despicable things, Persephone is truly one of the worst. It’s revealed that Persephone knows the entire time that Reynard the Fox is raping, torturing, and murdering women. However, she chooses complacency and allows him to continue his rampage, knowing that she could stop it at any point. Additionally, she only intervenes when Julia and Kady plan to kill Reynard. Instead of doing anything to stop Reynard, she defends her son. This makes Persephone a rape apologist in The Magicians.</p>
<p>All 9 Fillory Rulers In The Magicians, Ranked From Worst To Best<br>
Fillory went through multiple kings and queens in The Magicians, but not every ruler performed their duties with the same level of care.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it shouldn’t be any shock that she massively breaches Julia’s consent by planting Reynard’s spark in her without ever asking whether she wanted his powers. She also refuses to take it away. Ultimately, this makes Julia feel violated once again just after she starts healing from the trauma of getting raped by Reynard and struggling to get an abortion. Taking this into consideration, Persephone is one of the worst gods in The Magicians, only being trumped by her son.</p>
<p>1 Reynard The Fox, The Trickster God
Appearances: 10 Episodes Between The Magicians Seasons 1 Through 3</p>
<p>Throughout The Magicians, Reynard the Fox is a primary villain and the absolute worst god. He spends over a thousand years targeting Magicians who pray to Persephone. Reynard murders almost all these victims in a gruesome way, but not before torturing or raping them. This is shown in one of the darkest moments in The Magicians. He doesn’t hesitate to hurt people he deems weak. Additionally, he’s so depraved that he&rsquo;ll traumatize and manipulate his own son. It’s infuriating that Reynard never gets killed in The Magicians, allowing him to live an immortal but powerless life.</p>
