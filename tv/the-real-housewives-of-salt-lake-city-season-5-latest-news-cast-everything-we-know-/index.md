# The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 5 Latest News, Cast, &amp; Everything We Know 


## SUMMARY 



  RHOSLC season 2 had a major plot twist when Jen Shah was abruptly arrested for fraud and money laundering, shocking the cast and changing the show forever.   Despite a slight decline in ratings, RHOSLC is still popular and it is very likely that Bravo will renew the show for a fifth season.   If RHOSLC season 5 is confirmed, it will likely follow the show&#39;s pattern of premiering in September or possibly November 2024, staying on a similar timeline as previous seasons.

## Literature Review
The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City season 4 has been a fan favorite in the franchise in 2023. Will RHOSLC season 5 be just as good or even better?




Despite being newer to the franchise, The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City has taken the fans by storm, with many wondering about season 5. The Bravo series began in 2020, introducing six new ladies to the franchise: Lisa Barlow, Mary Cosby, Heather Gay, Meredith Marks, Whitney Rose, and Jen Shah. Their first season included a lot of interesting topics that The Real Housewives franchise has never really focused on before, such as the Mormon religion, how religion plays into their lives, and how a woman (Mary) married her step-grandfather. RHOSLC was a whole new type of Housewives that viewers were eager to know more about.




RHOSLC season 1 was captivating, but season 2 is one of the best seasons in the franchise, let alone the series. During RHOSLC season 2, Jen got a phone call from her husband, Sharrieff Shah, while in a sprinter van getting ready to leave for a trip to Aspen and abruptly left. Shortly after Jen left, the van was swarmed by the FBI, looking to arrest Jen. The cast was visibly shaken by the random FBI search and was extremely confused by why they were there. After finally leaving to head to Aspen, Whitney does a quick Google search and finds out Jen was arrested for fraud and money laundering. This changed RHOSLC forever.

 The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 5 Latest News 
         




So far, RHOSLC season 5 has yet to be confirmed by Bravo. Nonetheless, that doesn&#39;t mean the show isn&#39;t returning. RHOSLC season 4 has been doing great in terms of ratings and fan praise, so it&#39;s very unlikely that Bravo wouldn&#39;t renew the show for a fifth season. Even though the ratings aren&#39;t what they used to be (TV Deets revealed that they have gone from an average of 700,000 viewers to under 500,000), RHOSLC is still popular.

All the ladies were at BravoCon 2023 in Las Vegas recently (except for Mary, who&#39;s now a friend of in the show), which is another good sign that RHOSLC season 5 is underway. The women have also all appeared on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen (even Mary!). This is another clear sign that the show is doing well and will likely return for another season.



 The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 5 Potential Release Window 
          




Since RHOSLC season 1, the show has aired towards the end of the year. RHOSLC season 1 aired mid-November 2020, while seasons 2-4 have premiered at the beginning or the end of September. If the show does come back for a fifth season, RHOSLC season 5 will likely premiere sometime in September 2024. Since the series has been airing at roughly the same time for the past three seasons, it only makes sense for production to keep on the same timeline. If anything, RHOSLC may air a bit later in the year, in November 2024.



 The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 5 Potential Cast 
          

Since RHOSLC season 4 has received a lot of positive reception from viewers, the full cast will likely return. RHOSLC season 4 included original cast members Heather, Whitney, Meredith, and Lisa, along with Angie Katsanevas, who was a friend of last season, and newbie Monica Garcia. RHOSLC season 4 also saw the return of Mary, who was a full-time cast member from seasons 1-2, return as a friend of the cast. It&#39;s unclear whether or not Mary will return for RHOSLC season 5, but it&#39;s very likely the main cast will all return.






 Has The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Season 5 Been Filmed? 
          

It doesn&#39;t seem like RHOSLC season 5 has started filming yet. Past seasons of the series all started filming around January or February and completed filming sometime in April or May. If the show does come back for another season, they will likely start filming around late January to early February 2024. The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City season 4 reunion still needs to air, so they will likely begin filming shortly after that.



The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo
