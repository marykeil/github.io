  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From classics like Ghost In The Shell to the more recent Fate or Violet Evergarden, these anime are all about the strong female leads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that some of the best anime feature strong female characters. Anime is an incredibly diverse media that has something for everyone. Whether the audience is looking for an action-packed, battle-oriented story with larger-than-life characters who possess all kinds of cool powers, or a down-to-Earth, heartwarming tale of everyday life with a relatable cast of characters, there&rsquo;s a whole list of anime to choose from.
From mystery thrillers to magical girl adventures, these are some of the best female-led anime series of all time.</p>
<p>With that in mind, female leads aren&rsquo;t exclusive to magical girl or shoujo outings, either, as plenty of quality romance, isekai, and action-thriller series prominently feature women in leading roles.</p>
<p>20 Darling In The Franxx&rsquo;s Female Hero Makes Up For Its Lackluster Writing
Anime Series By Studio Trigger &amp; A-1 Pictures</p>
<p>Release Year 2018  Number Of Episodes 24  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll</p>
<p>Of all the eccentric and overall entertaining characters of Darling in the Franxx, none have stood out more than its female lead, Zero Two. Zero Two&rsquo;s intensity and aggressive impulses are what make this anime so much fun to watch, and the depth of Zero Two&rsquo;s character does a lot to make up for the various shortcomings of Franxx&rsquo;s script.
The soundtrack also helps to boost this show&rsquo;s ratings along with other strong female characters like Ichigo, Miku, Kokoro, Ikuno, and, of course, their Franxx, which are every bit as important to the series as their operators.

<p>19 Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End Is Already A Landmark In Fantasy Anime
Anime Series Produced By Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Release Year 2023  Number Of Episodes 21+  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll</p>
<p>The first great anime with a female protagonist to discuss is 2023&rsquo;s Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End. Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End uses its high fantasy setting to tell a poignant story about dealing with loss and the importance of forming meaningful connections with others, and that, naturally, results in Frieren being a character who always grows as a person and can always showcase how good a person is expected to be. Add in how she&rsquo;s always more than capable of fending for herself, and Frieren is bound to go down as one of the best female protagonists in all of anime.

<p>18 Canaan Is Action Thriller At Its Finest</p>
<p>Release Year 2009  Number Of Episodes 13  Where To Watch It Currently Unavailable</p>

<p>17 The Twelve Kingdoms Is A Great Take On The Isekai Genre
Anime Series By Pierrot</p>
<p>Release Year 2002  Number Of Episodes 45  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll</p>
<p>High school can be hard enough on students without them suddenly being transported to a whole new world where their status as an Earthling makes them a wanted fugitive, but that&rsquo;s exactly what happens to Youko Nakajima in this 2002 isekai anime.
Based on a novel series that began a decade earlier, aspects of The Twelve Kingdoms are definitely dated, but watching Youko grow from a whiny teen into a full-blown strong female protagonist is worth it. The anime also features a great musical score.

Anime Series By Madhouse</p>
<p>Release Year 2011  Number Of Episodes 76  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll, HIDIVE</p>

Chihaya&rsquo;s passion also draws many of the show&rsquo;s other characters to the sport of karuta, making her the anime&rsquo;s most important character. Chihaya is one of the most unique strong female protagonists on this list and she makes Chihayafuru compelling despite its niche subject.

Anime Series By Ufotable</p>
<p>Release Year 2011  Number Of Episodes 25  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll, Hulu</p>
<p>Saber is essentially the mascot of the Fate franchise, and Fate/Zero is one of her strongest showings.

While it might be a prequel, the success of Fate/Zero paved the way for the Fate franchise to become the major success it is today, and Saber&rsquo;s writing undoubtedly played a big part in that.

<p>11 Love Is Hard For Otaku Is A Near-Flawless Adult Romcom
Anime Series By A-1 Pictures</p>
<p>Release Year 2018  Number Of Episodes 11  Where To Watch It Amazon Prime</p>
<p>Most romance anime tend to focus on the pursuit of the relationship rather than the actual relationship, but that&rsquo;s not the case for Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. Wotakoi tells two love stories: there’s the story of two friends who have common otaku interests and decide to start dating, eventually falling in love with each other realistically; and then there’s the already established, occasionally dysfunctional relationship of their two friends.
With its refreshingly adult take on romance anime, Wotakoi sets itself apart from the abundance of high school-based romance series. If anime fans are sick of standard sappy rom-com, Wotakoi will feel like a breath of fresh air.

Anime Series By Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Release Year 2006  Number Of Episodes 47  Where To Watch It Hulu, HIDIVE</p>

Nana’s story is that of friendship, romance, and the difficulties of transitioning to adulthood, and the execution is where this anime truly shines. Nana relies on realistic dialogue and thought processes, relatable characters that act like real people, and believable plot lines that resonate in order to explore themes relevant to young adults who are stumbling through adulthood.

Anime Series By Kyoto Animation</p>
<p>Release Year 2018  Number Of Episodes 13  Where To Watch It Netflix</p>

<p>2 Puella Magi Madoka Magica&rsquo;s Dark Story Perfectly Complements Its Cast
Anime Series By Studio Shaft</p>
<p>Release Year 2011  Number Of Episodes 12  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll, Hulu</p>
<p>When it comes to anime with predominantly female casts, very few stand out like 2011&rsquo;s Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Madoka Magica is a famously deconstructive take on the magical girl genre, and it&rsquo;s through that dark storytelling that the five protagonists go through such emotionally resonant character development surrounding self-worth and their relationships with others.
Over a decade later, Madoka Magica&rsquo;s strong writing still makes it one of the best anime to watch for great female characters, and with 2024&rsquo;s Madoka Magica movie on the horizon, that&rsquo;s bound to become even more apparent.

<p>1 Claymore Is Still A Standout Fantasy Anime
Anime Series Produced By Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Release Year 2007  Number Of Episodes 26  Where To Watch It Crunchyroll, Hulu</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no arguing that Clare is an incredible female protagonist in Claymore. While seemingly just a stoic warrior at first, the way in which Clare&rsquo;s history is revealed, coupled with the physical and personal growth she goes through, makes for some incredible character writing that still stands out over a decade later. There are very few protagonists written as well as Clare, female or otherwise, and that writing easily makes Claymore stand out as one ofbest anime with a female protagonist.
