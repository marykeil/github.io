## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Christine Brown may have moved on from her marriage to Kody Brown, but she&#39;s still subtly shading her ex-husband with a new outfit.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown may have moved on from her marriage to her ex-husband Kody Brown, but she’s relishing in getting the opportunity to shade him in her sassy new sweatshirt. Christine and Kody’s marriage may have ended before Sister Wives season 18, but the majority of the season focused on the fallout from their relationship. For Christine, the separation between herself and Kody created a divide that allowed her to move into a healthy new relationship with her now-husband, David Woolley. For Kody, dealing with the split between himself and Christine pushed him into a negative headspace and helped cause Janelle Brown and Meri Brown to leave him.




In a recent Instagram post, Christine shared a fun new sweatshirt she received for Christmas from her sister that made it clear that while she’s moved past her marriage to Kody, she’s not above being a little shady. “My sister gave me this for Christmas!! All I can say is, YES!!!” Christine shared, wearing a sweatshirt that reads “Away from me with all thy bull****tery”.


 

Christine also included some telling hashtags in her post, including “#truestory”, “#itwastime”, and “#onlyonelife”, making it clear that she was subtly shading Kody and the life they shared together. While it’s not directly insulting her ex-husband, Christine’s post is clearly pointed toward the marriage she was in for nearly three decades.





 Christine &amp; Kody Brown’s Relationship Explained 
          

Christine was Kody’s third marriage and though he’d been married to both Janelle and Meri prior to meeting her, their relationship was different for Kody. The pair were married in 1994 after courting for a short time, and they wasted no time before beginning their family together. Welcoming children in 1995, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2003, and 2010, Christine and Kody’s family grew alongside the rest of the Browns. By the time Truely, the couple’s youngest, was born in 2010, Kody had met Robyn Brown and was hoping to bring her into the family. While Christine supported his decision to bring another wife into the fold, it wasn’t an exciting time.


 




It was obvious from the beginning to Christine that the relationship Kody and Robyn shared wasn’t like his other marriages. While it would take her years to vocalize it, it quickly became clear that Kody and Robyn’s relationship was built on romantic love, while his other marriages had been built on an entirely different foundation. Christine began to feel the strain in her relationship with Kody over the course of his early years with Robyn, and things got worse as time went on. By the time Sister Wives season 17 was filming, she knew it was time to take action. Christine chose to leave Kody in 2021, moving from Flagstaff to Salt Lake City to be closer to her family.

Christine’s relationship with Kody wasn’t an easy time for the Sister Wives star, but she’s shared that she’s done her best to look back and laugh at it as that’s the only way she’s been able to move through it. For Christine, taking time away from her relationship with Kody and decompressing gave her the ability to make light of the drama she’s faced in her life. She was able to reflect, ultimately pushing herself to a place where she could move on and find something that made the Sister Wives star happier and healthier than she’s ever been.
