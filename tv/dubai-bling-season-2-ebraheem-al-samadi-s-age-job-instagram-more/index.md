## Literature Review
Dubai Bling cast member, Ebraheem Al Samadi is in his mid-30s. Since age 14, he has set up several successful businesses under his name.




Ebraheem Al Samadi from Dubai Bling has the perfect personality to be an iconic reality TV star. When the young Kuwait native debuted in the series, he introduced himself as a successful businessman. He was looking for love then and went on a blind date with socialite Loujain ‘LJ’ Adada. Ebraheem showed off his wealth from the first episode onwards. He sent a helicopter to pick up his date, making the whole thing grander than it was. At the same time, he got flowers for LJ, flaunting his flower company, Forever Rose.




Ebraheem proved himself to be one of the most villainous characters in Dubai Bling. In one of the earlier episodes, the Middle Eastern reality star learned about LJ’s fight with her friend Farhana Bodi. He immediately stirred the pot when it wasn’t necessary. Ebraheem stood out as one of the biggest scandalmongers in the series due to his habit of gossiping. During one episode, he attended a brand party where he told the ladies not to gossip. In the same episode, he called Farhana to spill the tea and share what Zeina Khoury was up to.
