## Literature Review

There are a variety of Hulu subscription plans to choose from, so anyone interested in signing up for the platform will need to do their research.




Determining whether a Hulu subscription is worthwhile requires researching what exactly the streaming service offers. Hulu is a major streaming service available to consumers, competing with other top platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Disney&#43;, Paramount&#43;, and Apple TV&#43;. For TV and movie fans on a budget, it often comes down to selecting just one of these major platforms as their streamer of choice. Hulu had its start in 2007 as a joint venture between NBC Universal and News Corporation Ownership stakes changed hands until 2019 when the Walt Disney Company assumed full operational control of the platform.




The name &#34;Hulu&#34; comes from a Mandarin word that has two meanings, one comes from a proverb that describes &#34;Hulu&#34; as a &#34;gourd&#34; where precious things are stored; the second meaning is &#34;interactive recording&#34;, accurate summations of the platform (via Hulu). As such, Hulu contains many &#34;precious recordings&#34; in its vast catalog of original Hulu movies; content library of shows and films from FX, Comedy Central, and more; as well as Emmy Award-winning original TV series. The platform has a lot to offer for those interested, but the variety of ever-changing subscription plans may feel daunting at first.

 Is Hulu Available To Watch For Free? 
          

Hulu is available to watch for free for 30 days, but only to first-time subscribers. It&#39;s important to note that this 30-day trial does not extend to the bundle or live TV packages. A free trial does require payment details and the subscription will automatically renew after one month, so it pays to keep track of when that payment date is approaching in case a user wants to cancel beforehand.

At one point, there was the ability to subscribe to Hulu for free. It was a with-ads option in which users could watch the most recent episodes of certain ABC, NBC, and Fox shows following an eight-day delay. However, this model began to be phased out in 2016 (via The Wall Street Journal). Now, streaming users will have to determine the price package that suits them best to access the Hulu library.
