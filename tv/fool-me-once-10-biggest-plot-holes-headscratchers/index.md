## Literature Review
Despite solving its many mysteries all simultaneously once the last piece of the puzzle was offered by Maya, Fool Me Once has various plot holes.




Warning! SPOILERS about Fool Me Once ahead.
Netflix’s Fool Me Once seamlessly tied up most loose ends solving the majority of mysteries, but the presence of some small plot holes and inconsistencies still highlighted how not everything fit perfectly in the mystery thriller. Based on the Harlan Coben novel of the same name, Fool Me Once managed to give a satisfying conclusion to all the intertwined mysteries involving various murders and even more mindboggling secrets in episode 8, granting solutions and a final confrontation between Maya and the Burketts. However, despite the many answers neatly delivered, Fool Me Once still included various plot holes, with some minor and others more evident.
From Maya’s revelations to Shane about her involvement in Joe’s murder and how she explained very little about the guns both she and Joe went to grab ahead of their confrontation to how convenient some realizations were for some characters, Fool Me Once included plenty of headscratchers. While some were so big that they counted fully as Fool Me Once’s unanswered questions and mysteries, most plot holes only made part of the solution to Fool Me Once’s mysteries less believable without impacting the general enjoyability of the mystery thriller. This made Fool Me Once’s plot holes not as affecting, especially considering how the bigger mysteries’ solutions fit generally perfectly together.









 








 1  The Police Never Found Maya&#39;s Gun At The Scene 
She is never seen disposing of it


 







Maya’s revelation at Fool Me Once episode 7’s ending finally explained why she wasn’t particularly affected by Joe’s death, but her admission of killing Joe still didn’t tell Shane a seamless story. Indeed, her flashback showed Maya chucking her coat and gun in a bag that she left next to Joe’s body, but the scene never showed Maya disposing of said bag. As she waited in the park with Joe’s body till the ambulance and the police came, they would have likely checked the scene and her bag, easily finding the gun with which she shot Joe and solving the murder in seconds if it wasn’t for the plot hole.
            
 
 10 Best TV Shows Like Fool Me Once 
Though Fool Me Once won&#39;t get a second season on Netflix, multiple other dramas and thrillers exist that offer a similar storyline and themes.









 2  Nobody At The Sports Club Ever Found Sami Unconscious 
He seemingly stayed there for hours
        

One of Sami’s worst blackouts happened as he followed Coach Phil and PJ in the Burkett-financed Sports Club, where he fell with part of his body paralyzed and woke up after what seemed hours given Marty’s worry. Not only did Sami weirdly manage to enter the club without being seen, but he also spent quite some time unconscious behind the shed. While the poignant moment was instrumental in bringing Sami and Marty closer together, it didn’t make sense that such a busy club wouldn’t check the grounds, highlighting the inconsistency behind the event. If security checked the grounds, the beautiful moment between Sami and Marty wouldn’t have existed.





 3  Izabella &amp; Luka Kept Joe&#39;s Clothes For An Unnecessarily Long Time 
There was no point in keeping them
        

When Maya caught up with both Luka and Izabella by following them, she finally managed to get the truth out of them about the nanny cam video. Although the gun would have been enough to convince them to talk, they had managed to evade Maya’s questions throughout the series. However, Fool Me Once’s ending conveniently had Maya find Luka and Izabella as they were disposing of Joe’s clothes that Maya saw on the nanny cam, making it impossible for them to lie. Still, it didn’t make sense for Izabella and Luka to wait that long to discard Joe’s clothes, as the longer they kept them, the longer they implicated themselves.





 4  Nobody Questioned Sami Talking Alone When Hallucinating Nicole 
He saw &amp; spoke to Nicole in various public spaces


 







CoreyTheWhistle’s investigation into the Burkett pharmaceutical company finally gave Sami a reason for his many unexplained symptoms, including his frequent hallucinations of his dead fiancée talking to him. However, most of his talks with Nicole throughout Fool Me Once happened outside or in public spaces. While Fool Me Once episode 7 showed Marty being puzzled and worried by Sami talking to himself at the precinct, no one confronted Sami for what he believed were long talks with Nicole, despite many of them happening in public, making the uncertainty of what was happening last longer but resulting entirely improbable because of it.





 5  Shane Activated Maya&#39;s Car Alarm Without Any Reason 
He didn&#39;t do anything apart from lurking around her house
        

Shane’s behavior in Fool Me Once was a confusing mystery all in itself, but one of his most disturbing actions stands out as entirely senseless. While his putting a GPS tracker on Maya or checking if she told him the truth about where she was could still be substantiated by his book counterpart’s justification of following her because he was worried about her erratic behavior, the activation of her car alarm as Shane hid behind a wall made entirely no sense. His actions could have worked as a red herring, but the presence of so many extremely disturbing ones makes them one of Fool Me Once’s biggest unexplained headscratchers.





 6  Mrs. Dark Conveniently Found Proof Of The Burketts&#39; Payouts Lying Around 
She didn&#39;t trust Maya on her word despite her husband missing for weeks
        

Maya’s visit to Dark’s house looking for Tommy didn’t prove particularly fruitful because Tommy’s wife refused to give her information about his whereabouts. However, after Mrs. Dark found proof of the Burketts’ payments to keep Tommy silent about Joe murdering Andrew, she promptly contacted Maya asking her to find Tommy. Mrs. Dark immediately finding the bank statements with the secret payments after Maya went after her was already too convenient, but her exchange with Maya proved especially bizarre because she already knew Tommy had been missing for the past six weeks, making her refusal to give Maya answers particularly odd as she could have used Maya’s help to find him.





 7  Joe&#39;s Gun Was Also Nowhere To Be Found 
He had the deactivated gun in his hand when he was shot


 







Maya not only didn’t explain where she put her bag with the gun in to hide it from the police but also left Joe’s deactivated gun unaccounted for when she told Shane the truth. The police would have logically searched the area of Joe’s murder, and the presence of even just one gun would have easily let them veer off Maya’s version that it was a robbery gone wrong. However, Maya never explained how she made sure that the police never found her and Joe’s guns, leaving their disappearance one of Fool Me Once’s biggest plot holes.

 8  Sami &amp; Marty Never Officially Combed Through Maya&#39;s House 
Despite Joe being murdered Maya&#39;s house was never searched
        

Despite Maya being the only witness to Joe’s murder per what she told Sami and Marty, the two never searched her house. Sami informally asked her about the weapons she kept in the house, and Maya brought him to see them, essentially controlling what to show and what to hide from him. The secret compartment where Maya stashed the working gun could have easily been found in an official search, but even when Maya became a person of interest after finding Tommy Dark’s body, Marty and Sami never made an official request for a house search, making the investigation last three episodes more without it making sense.





 9  Lily Pointed At The Bush Saying &#34;Dada&#34; 
Nothing really prompted Lily&#39;s weird behavior
        

Of all the unusual reactions of Lily, her brief disappearance to go next to the front door to say “Dada” and point to the bush was among the least explainable. Indeed, had Joe really faked his death and it wasn’t all Judith’s ploy to let Maya admit she had killed him herself, Lily’s words could be the proof Maya needed to know Joe was still alive. Judith could have never involved Lily in her ploy against Maya, so even that explanation couldn’t have worked. In the end, Lily’s weird behavior remained unexplained, and it proved completely illogical no matter how Maya looked at it.





 10  Sami Conveniently Found Rambo During His First Visit To The Estate 
He only had a nickname to go on but he found him immediately
        

While PJ’s fall from the roof made Sami’s suspension immediate, it also gave him the name of PJ’s other accomplice, Rambo, and where he usually stayed. However, Sami’s success in going to the estate and finding Rambo the first time he went there proved pure luck, as he didn’t have access to the police’s tools anymore, and he still was able to learn straight away from him that Maya was Joe’s killer. Although Sami’s luck could also not be considered a headscratcher, his success with Rambo was so immediate and convenient that it stood out, proving too easy considering the difficulties he faced throughout his investigation in Fool Me Once.
