## Literature Review

Casting directors are under a lot of pressure to make good decisions with little information to go on. Unsurprisingly, things sometimes go wrong. 




Perhaps more than any other element of production, poor casting choices can have a disastrous effect on a TV show. Even with stellar writing, direction, and set design, a series can fall apart without chemistry between the cast, or if an actor just doesn&#39;t fit. As a result, casting directors are under huge pressure to make the correct call, sometimes with very little information to go on.
In the worst-case scenario, one poor casting decision can have a negative impact on the entire course of a TV show. Even classics like The Office, and Star Trek: The Next Generation have suffered due to a single casting mistake. In other cases, bad casting may not be the only problem with a series, but is emblematic of its wider decline, highlighting other issues in the process. As is true in every production, big casting mistakes don&#39;t happen in isolation. However, when things go wrong, they are extremely noticeable. Here are 10 prime examples of bad casting calls that hurt the overall series.
            
 
 12 Casting Decisions That Hurt YA Adaptations (And 12 That Saved Them) 
Many YA adaptations have become instant hits. While some choose great actors for their movies, other casting decisions aren&#39;t as great.












 








 10  Dominic West As Prince Charles 
The Crown


 







Although The Crown ran into several narrative problems the closer the series got to the present day, these issues were overshadowed by West&#39;s performance as Charles. As proven by his multiple movie credits and acclaimed role in The Wire, West is undeniably a fine actor. However, many critics felt that he was simply too debonair to play the aloof and uncertain heir to the throne. Whereas other seasons of The Crown could take liberties with physical resemblance, The Crown seasons 5 and 6 faced much more scrutiny due to the audience&#39;s familiarity with the characters. As such, West just didn&#39;t feel believable as Charles – a major problem given his prominence in the show.





 9  Diaz, Jeffrey, And Mantock As The Three Sisters 
Charmed
        

While the Charmed reboot received criticism for issues with its story and differences from the original, the show was generally noted for the diversity of its cast. This, however, also caused a problem in the case of the three central sisters. Although the family was said to be Latina, only one of the cast (Diaz) had a Latina background. This stirred significant controversy prior to release, potentially helping to turn viewers against the series before it even started.





 8  Richard Madden And Priyanka Chopra As Spies 
Citadel


 







With an estimated budget of $300 million, Citadel was supposed to be Amazon Prime Video&#39;s next big hit. However, things turned out very differently – in no small part due to the disastrous combination of Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra in the leads. While both actors have proven their screen credentials, together they lacked chemistry, dragging the whole show down with them. Citadel&#39;s script and story may have left something to be desired, but Madden and Chopra conveyed all the energy of a delayed Amazon delivery driver.





 7  Cindy Williams Removed As Shirley 
Laverne &amp; Shirley
        

Given Laverne &amp; Shirley&#39;s title, getting rid of either Laverne or Shirley would seem nonsensical. Yet this is exactly what happened towards the end of the once-popular Cheers spin-off. After being made to work on the show throughout her pregnancy – including on her due date – Cindy Williams&#39; sued producers for $20 million. Consequently, Lavern &amp; Shirley&#39;s final episodes simply featured Laverne by herself, ruining the entire concept of the series in the process.





 6  Glee Supplementing The Original Cast 
Glee
        

All high-school set TV series face an inescapable problem when it comes to actors&#39; aging, and Glee was no different. However, while some shows do manage to successfully revamp and replace previous casts, Glee provided a textbook example of how not to keep going. Not only did the show attempt to follow original Glee cast members as they left school, but it also introduced an entirely new collection of Glee-clubbers at the same time. The result was narrative chaos, with too many characters and storylines to keep track of.





 5  Gates McFadden Leaving As Beverly Crusher 
Star Trek: The Next Generation


 







Given her status as a Star Trek all-star, the idea of Dr. Beverly Crusher being considered anything less than essential in The Next Generation crew is bizarre. And yet, the show nearly shot itself in the foot by replacing actor Gates McFadden with a new character after season 1 following a feud with a producer. Fortunately, McFadden returned in season 3 and the show became a soaring success. However, there&#39;s no doubt that The Next Generation&#39;s slow start and poor season 2 was partly down to this major casting mistake.





 4  Lennie Weinrib Cast As Scrappy-Doo 
Scooby-Doo
        

Often cited as one of the most annoying characters ever created, Scrappy-Doo&#39;s introduction is emblematic of everything that&#39;s wrong with cynical stunt casting. Introduced in order to reinvigorate Scooby-Doo&#39;s flagging ratings, Scrappy arguably succeeded in his original objective. However, his character transformed the tone and content of the original show, turning it into a merchandising, as opposed to a mystery, machine.
Such is Scrappy-Doo&#39;s notoriety that The Simpsons famously parodied the move with the introduction of Poochie to the fictional Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show.







 3  Finn Jones Cast As Iron Fist 
Iron Fist and The Defenders
        

After the success of Daredevil and Jessica Jones, hopes were high for the future of Marvel&#39;s grounded Netflix television series. However, things started to go badly wrong with the decision to cast Finn Jones as the superhero Iron Fist. Although the show was panned for its pacing and derivative story, particular criticism was reserved for the failure to award the main part to an Asian actor. Finn Jones&#39; performance was by no means the only problem with the series, but it certainly highlighted other issues and made audiences less forgiving.





 2  Joseph Fiennes As Michael Jackson 
Urban Myths
        

Throughout its limited four-season run, Urban Myths was generally received pretty warmly – despite little accompanying fanfare. However, almost the only thing that most viewers can remember about the British comedy-drama is the disastrous decision to cast actor Joseph Fiennes as Michael Jackson. The subject of endless internet memes, Fiennes&#39; performance was criticized heavily by members of the Jackson family and the wider public, many of whom took offense. So notorious is the episode that it has since been pulled from transmission.





 1  James Spader Cast As Robert California 
The Office
        

As Michael Scott, Steve Carell was the beating heart of The Office, to the point where many questioned how the iconic TV comedy could continue after he decided to leave. These concerns were not alleviated by the decision to cast James Spader as his replacement, Robert California. Although the backlash is arguably not Spader&#39;s fault, fans were outright hostile to the character, resulting in poor reviews for The Office season 8. While some criticism was reserved for Ed Helms&#39; Andy Bernard, most of the negativity – unfairly or not – was aimed at Robert California.
