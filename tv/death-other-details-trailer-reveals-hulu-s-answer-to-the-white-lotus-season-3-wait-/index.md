## Literature Review
The new trailer for Death and Other Details reveals a new White Lotus-esque white-collar mystery from Hulu, hinting at ample twists and turns.




Hulu reveals the trailer for their upcoming show Death and Other Details. The series is a crime-drama with a plot that focuses on a detective and his protégé who search for the truth while on a wealthy sailing boat whose inhabitants are all hiding something. Death and Other Details is set for a series premiere on Hulu on January 16.




Now, Hulu has revealed the trailer for Death and Other Details. The trailer sets up the detective plot line, saying “if you want to solve a crime, you must first learn to see through the illusion. Details matter.”


 

Soon, the scene evolves into an attempt to solve a murder, as the inhabitants of a cruise ship soon become suspects as they curiously skulk around the ship amid an investigation. Alongside the trailer, Hulu also released a poster for Death and Other Details, which can be found below: 

          


 What To Expect from Death and Other Details 
          




Death and Other Details stars Mandy Patinkin as the protagonist and master detective Rufus Cotesworth, who works to find the truth with Violett Beane’s Imogene. In addition to Patinkin and Beane, Death and Other Details features a supporting cast of Fall of the House of Usher&#39;s Rahul Kohli, Linda Emond, Lauren Patten, Angela Zhou, Christian Svensson, Pardis Saremi, and Hugo Diego Garcia. The series was co-created by Mike Weiss (Chicago P.D., The Mentalist) and Heidi Cole McAdams (The 100, Stumptown).

From the trailer alone, it&#39;s clear that Death and Other Details is riding the wave of hugely popular white collar satire The White Lotus. Similarly to The White Lotus, Death and Other Details sets the scene in a lavish environment, which in this case is a luxurious cruise ship. The show will usurp the safe, placid facade of the cruise ship by introducing a murder mystery plot replete with twists and turns. 






Death and Other Details will have a ten-episode season, airing its finale on March 5.




Based on the trailer, it looks like Death and Other Details will feature conniving characters and enticing plotlines galore. Patinkin looks particularly charming as Rufus Cotesworth, providing calculated logic through a series of seemingly unreliable narrators. Hopefully, Death and Other Details can deliver a promising premise and cast of characters as it premieres on Hulu later this month.
