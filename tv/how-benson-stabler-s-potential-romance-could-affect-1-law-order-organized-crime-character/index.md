## SUMMARY 



  Danielle Moné Truitt&#39;s character, Sergeant Ayanna Bell, is aware of the potential romance between Stabler and Benson and wants it to not interfere with their work.   Bell would encourage Stabler and Benson to either get together or move on, as she is not heavily concerned about their relationship.

## Literature Review
Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime star Danielle Moné Truitt addresses how Benson and Stabler&#39;s potential romance could impact another key character.




Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime star Danielle Moné Truitt has addressed how a potential romance between Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson could impact her character, Sergeant Ayanna Bell. In their most recent seasons, both the newest spinoff of the franchise and Law &amp; Order: SVU have teased the potential of Stabler and Benson becoming a couple. This possible romance is built upon the many years of working side-by-side, which could be explored in upcoming seasons.




Speaking with TV Insider, Truitt explained how a Stabler and Benson romance would impact Bell&#39;s leadership in Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime. The actor addressed how her character likely sees what&#39;s going on between the pair and wants to make sure it doesn&#39;t impact her team&#39;s ability to do their jobs properly. Check out what Truitt had to say below:


I think Bell, for the most part, minds her own business until she’s brought into something, you know what I’m saying? She knows that Stabler and Benson have this connection. Stabler’s never went in depth with her, but she’s a smart lady, so she kind of figured out like, ‘Okay, they have something going on.’ She just doesn’t want it to get in the way of Stabler’s work, number one, and she cares about Stabler as a friend, so she doesn’t want whatever this is to keep him in a place where he can’t fully actualize joy and who he should be in his life.
I think for Bell, it would be like, ‘Either y’all going to get together or you’re not. Just make a decision. Either you’re going to be together or you just need to move on.’ And I think she says that in Season 1 — just move on and enjoy your life and enjoy whatever that connection and that friendship is. I don’t think she is that concerned.






 Will A Benson &amp; Stabler Romance Happen? 
          

Benson and Stabler were both introduced at the start of Law &amp; Order: SVU, where both characters spent up through season 12 working together. However, Christopher Meloni left the show before season 13 began, returning to his role in a new spinoff, Organized Crime, in 2021. Since then, there have been multiple crossovers between the two shows, some episodes possibly hinting at a romance between the leads of the respective series.

Since Organized Crime season 4 and SVU season 25 are set to premiere on the same night, there may be more connections between the pair unfolding throughout. Perhaps the next ongoing case on Stabler&#39;s side will bring Benson in for a guest appearance, giving them more time to develop a relationship. However, since they&#39;re both leads of their own series, it&#39;s unclear how often each would appear on either show if a romance did blossom.




                  Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime Hints A Benson &amp; Stabler Romance Won&#39;t Happen Anytime Soon   The Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime crossover with SVU continues to tease a Benson and Stabler relationship, but it still won&#39;t happen soon.    

Although a romantic relationship between Stabler and Benson is possible, it&#39;s unclear how long it would take for the pair to admit such feelings for one another. This is especially true for the former, who is still grieving his late wife&#39;s death. As their characters seem to have a long road ahead, Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime may not be confirming a romance between them soon. However, with enough development, the pair could wind up together in the end.



All three Law &amp; Order series will be returning to NBC on January 18, 2024.
