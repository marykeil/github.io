## Literature Review
Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s backstory involves a lot of time travel. Here is when, exactly, the USS Protostar arrived in TNG&#39;s timeline from the future.




Star Trek: Prodigy season 1&#39;s backstory involves the USS Protostar and the Diviner (John Noble) time-traveling from the 25th century into the mid-24th-century timeline of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s backstory establishes that the USS Protostar led by Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran) accidentally left 2383 and time-traveled to the 25th century, where they were taken prisoner on the Vau N&#39;Akat&#39;s homeworld of Solum. After the Vau N&#39;Akat hid a weapon called the Living Construct on the Protostar, Chakotay sent his starship back in time to keep it from the aliens&#39; hands. The Vau N&#39;Akat then sent 100 agents back in time to find the Protostar, including the Diviner, who tracked the Starfleet ship to Tars Lamora.




Twitter/X user Jörg Hillebrand (@gaghyogi49), who was a researcher for Star Trek: Picard season 3, confirmed exactly when the USS Protostar arrived in the 24th century after Captain Chakotay sent it back. Hillebrand matched the Stardates from Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, episode 6, &#34;Kobayashi&#34;, to Star Trek: The Next Generation season 3, determining &#34;Kobayashi&#39;s&#34; Protostar flashback happened right before TNG season 3, episode 18, &#34;Menage a Troi&#34;, which took place in 2366, Star Trek: Prodigy season 1&#39;s main story takes place 17 years after the Protostar landed in Tars Lamora, which lines up as 2383. Check out Jörg&#39;s post below:


 



The Diviner creating his daughter and progeny, Gwyndala (Ella Purnell), also happened in 2366, which makes Gwyn about 17 in Star Trek: Prodigy season 1.







                  Everything We Know About Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2   Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will stream on Netflix after the animated series was canceled by Paramount&#43;, with 20 brand new episodes coming in 2024.    


 Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 Also Involves Time Travel 
Where and when will Admiral Janeway and the USS Voyager-A go?
         

The ending of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 set up a huge time travel mission for Star Trek: Prodigy season 2. The destruction of the USS Protostar created a temporal anomaly that leads to an alternate 25th-century timeline. But a distress signal from Captain Chakotay sent through the anomaly was all Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) needed to lead a new mission to find and rescue Chakotay from Solum in the alternate future. With The Doctor (Robert Picardo) from Star Trek: Voyager overseeing the ragtag former crew of the Protostar, who are now Janeway&#39;s warrant officers, the new USS Voyager-A will go to Solum to save Chakotay.




While Star Trek: Prodigy season 2&#39;s initial mission statement is clear and intriguing, it only scratches the surface of Prodigy season 2&#39;s scope, which promises to be even more epic than season 1&#39;s. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will reportedly touch upon the entire legacy of Star Trek, and that could involve even more time travel and tie-ins to multiple Star Trek eras. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 could very well be the most expansive Star Trek adventure in the franchise&#39;s storied history.



Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 is available to stream on Netflix. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix in 2024.
