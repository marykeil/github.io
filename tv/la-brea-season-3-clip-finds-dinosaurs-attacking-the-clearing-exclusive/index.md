## Literature Review
Exclusive: Screen Rant is proud to present a clip from the La Brea season 3 premiere, in which Gavin, Izzy, and Ty witness an attack on the Clearing.




Consisting of six episodes, La Brea season 3 concludes the Harris family’s journey after the thirtieth installment. Episode 6, &#34;The Road Home - Part 2&#34; serves as the series finale. The show was created by David Appelbaum and stars Eoin Macken, Zyra Gorecki, Chiké Okonkwo, Rohan Mirchandaney, Lily Santiago, Josh Mckenzie, Jon Seda, Nicholas Gonzalez, Jack Martin, Veronica St. Clair, Tonantzin Carmelo, and Natalie Zea.




In anticipation of season 3, Screen Rant is proud to present an exclusive clip from La Brea season 3, episode 1, &#34;Sierra.&#34; The sneak peek opens on Gavin and Scott, who are startled to see their fellow survivors running from the Clearing. After learning that dinosaurs have attacked, Gavin searches for Izzy and Josh amidst the chaos. The Clearing has served as the group&#39;s base camp since the pilot and its destruction could have devastating repercussions. The extent of the damage is yet to be determined, but given the time and effort the survivors invested in their makeshift home, they will likely find themselves at a loss.

 What To Expect During La Brea&#39;s Final Episodes 
         




The season 2 finale of La Brea sees the show come full circle when Eve is sucked into a portal and transported to an unknown time period. However, unlike the pilot, Eve is separated from all three of her family members, as Josh remains with Gavin and Izzy. The Harrises have always been the heart and soul of the series, so their journey back to each other will likely be the main plot point of the remaining episodes.

The survivors will also be forced to face whatever emerges from the sinkholes that appeared in season 2&#39;s final moments. As displayed in Screen Rant&#39;s exclusive clip, dinosaurs have arrived to stake their claim on the Clearing. Yet, they may not be the only creatures appearing in 10,000 B.C. Multiple portals were shown in the sky, indicating that anything from any time period is fair game.

In addition to its central story, there are several loose ends that La Brea needs to tie up before the show concludes. Veronica and Lucas are preparing for the birth of their child, while Scott has learned game-changing information about the day he fell in the sinkhole. Given that the writers were aware of the final season in advance, it&#39;s safe to assume that La Brea will deliver an ending that does the characters justice and satisfies loyal fans.






La Brea season 3 premieres Tuesday, January 9 at 9pm ET on NBC and is available to stream the next day on Peacock.
