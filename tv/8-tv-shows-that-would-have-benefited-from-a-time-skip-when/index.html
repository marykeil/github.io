  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Some long-running TV shows, like The Simpsons and Two and a Half Men, could have benefited from a time skip to refresh their storylines and allow for character development.
Time skips can help move the plot along and cut out unnecessary details, especially in shows with a tired storyline.
Shows like The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family could have used a time skip to age their characters and explore new storylines.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There have been plenty of great, and terrible, time skips in TV shows. However, quite a few series would have benefited from having one.</p>
<p>Although time skips in TV shows can be divisive, some shows could have been better with one. A time skip can be used in TV for a few reasons, such as a change in cast or a major plot shift. While this can be exciting or dramatic, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s always good, with plenty of shows going downhill after a time skip.
A time skip can vary from a few months to several years, usually depending on the context of the story. The use of a time skip allows writers to move things faster, purposely cutting out details to either be revisited later or because the next exciting part of the story needs to happen. Especially with long-running TV shows, a plot can eventually get tiresome and need a refresher, and jumping ahead can help with this. While moving forward in the story and time isn&rsquo;t always a definite fix, some TV shows would have benefited from a time skip.</p>
<p>8  The Simpsons
Should Have Had A Time Skip After The Simpsons Movie</p>
<p>The Simpsons</p>
<p>Release Date    December 17, 1989     Cast    Tress MacNeille , Julie Kavner , Harry Shearer , Pamela Hayden , Nancy Cartwright , Hank Azaria , Dan Castellaneta , Yeardley Smith     Seasons    35</p>
<p>The Simpsons has notably seen its characters remain the same age for over 35 seasons. With it being the longest-running American animated sitcom ever, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the show&rsquo;s continuity suffered over time, which caused some plot holes in The Simpsons. Even though Springfield always seems to be living in the present, a time skip could have helped the show develop further. In July 2007, The Simpsons Movie was released, just two months after season 18 finished airing, and the finale, &ldquo;You Kent Always Say What You Want,&rdquo; marked the 400th episode of the show.
With an already long run under its belt, this could have been an interesting time to see The Simpsons use a time jump, especially after Springfield was almost destroyed in the movie. The Simpsons movie could have been a great final story that heavily involved each character in some form or another, with season 19 starting a new era. It would allow for new stories to be told, especially for the likes of Bart, Lisa, and their friends, as hypothetical flash-forward scenes have always seen some great character development for them.</p>
<p>7  The Big Bang Theory
Should Have Had A Time Skip After Season 11</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory</p>
<p>Release Date    September 24, 2007     Cast    Kaley Cuoco , Johnny Galecki , Jim Parsons , Melissa Rauch , Mayim Bialik , Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg     Seasons    12</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory ran for 12 seasons across as many years, but the hit sitcom could have benefited from a jump in its timeline. Season 11 saw Sheldon (Jim Parsons) get married to Amy (Mayim Balik), something nobody expected to ever happen. Their wedding day was also the moment they came up with the asymmetry theory, which awarded them the Nobel Prize in The Big Bang Theory finale. It seemed unusual that the pair put their work together so quickly, so the end of season 11 could have been a great place to insert a time skip.
Not only would it have made more logical sense, giving the show a good few years for them to finish their paper, but it could have allowed for some character development for Sheldon, jumping forward so audiences could see the kind of person he&rsquo;d become as a married man. It would also have given a more realistic timeline for Penny (Kaley Cuoco) to come around to being a mother, rather than the few episodes it took in season 12, and give the Wolowitz children some time to grow up, so their appearance in the finale matched their canonical ages.</p>
<p>6  Rick And Morty
Should Have Had A Time Skip After Season 6</p>
<p>Rick and Morty</p>
<p>Release Date    December 2, 2013     Cast    Spencer Grammer , Kari Wahlgren , Chris Parnell , Sarah Chalke , Ian Cardoni , Harry Belden     Seasons    7</p>
<p>Rick and Morty famously saw a big shake-up with its cast, following the announcement that Justin Roiland was no longer going to be part of the show. Rick and Morty recast Roiland&rsquo;s characters from season 7, and while the show made changes along with its new voice actors, it missed an opportunity for a time skip. With Space Beth (Sarah Chalke) making more appearances in season 6, notably having an affair with her clone, a time skip could have seen a possible future for the two, either with or without Jerry (Chris Parnell).</p>
<p>Like many other animated shows with a timeline consistently set in the present (The Simpsons, Bob&rsquo;s Burgers, Family Guy), the children would also be able to move on to the next stage of their lives. Summer (Spencer Grammer) could finally graduate high school, and if she still wished to, &ldquo;do something with turquoise.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s also been an ongoing reference in Rick and Morty that Morty&rsquo;s (Harry Belden) grades suffered because of his adventures with Rick (Ian Cardoni), and a time skip could show whether his future was indeed affected by it or not.</p>
<p>5  Modern Family
Should Have Had A Time Skip After Season 10</p>
<p>Modern Family</p>
<p>Release Date    September 23, 2009     Cast    Ed O&rsquo;Neill , Sofia Vergara , Julie Bowen , Ty Burrell , Jesse Tyler Ferguson , Eric Stonestreet , Sarah Hyland , Ariel Winter , Nolan Gould , Rico Rodriguez     Seasons    11</p>
<p>When Modern Family ended with season 11, its cast looked very different compared to its beginning. Not only had the Dunphy kids and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) become adults, but Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) was deep into her teen years and the Pritchett brood had grown with the addition of Joe. The end of season 10 saw Haley (Sarah Hyland) give birth to twins, with a lot of season 11 following her journey as a new mother.
While season 11 was still well-written and a good end for the show, a time skip could have made it even better. A jump into the future, even just a few years, would have missed her adjusting to being a parent, but skipping ahead to see Haley as a Super Mom would have been a fascinating piece of character development. It would have also been great to see how street-smart Luke&rsquo;s (Nolan Gould) life would have turned out, as well as what Joe would have been like as a preteen.</p>
<p>4  Two And A Half Men
Should Have Had A Time Skip After Season 9, Episode 2</p>
<p>Two and a Half Men</p>
<p>Release Date    September 22, 2003     Cast    Charlie Sheen , Jon Cryer , Angus T. Jones , Marin Hinkle , Melanie Lynskey , Holland Taylor , Conchata Ferrell , Ashton Kutcher , Amber Tamblyn     Seasons    12</p>
<p>Two and Half Men season 9 saw Charlie Sheen be replaced by Ashton Kutcher, introducing a new character to the show. However, after two episodes, Walden (Kutcher) and Alan (Jon Cryer) quickly settled into the show&rsquo;s standard format, and the fact that Walden was essentially a stranger seemed to be forgotten. At this point, Alan also believed that his brother was dead, and the discussion of his recent demise started to fade, so episode 3 could have been a great place to insert a time skip.
A time skip would have made Walden&rsquo;s permanent fixture more natural but would also explain Jake&rsquo;s (Angus T. Jones) gradual disappearance from the show. Jake had less on-screen time in season 10, graduating and joining the army, but was then absent from season 11, and only made a brief appearance in the Two and a Half Men finale. Jake was a senior in season 10 and a lot of his storylines focused on more adult themes, such as him sleeping with older women, but a time jump to make him an adult would have made these plots more appropriate.</p>
<p>3  You
Should Have Had A Time Skip After Season 3</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Release Date    September 9, 2018     Cast    Elizabeth Lail , Michaela McManus , Ambyr Childers , Victoria Pedretti , Luca Padovan , Scott Speedman , Travis Van Winkle , Penn Badgley , Jenna Ortega , Shay Mitchell     Seasons    4</p>
<p>You season 4 saw Joe (Penn Badgley) up to his same tricks once again, except this time, in London. You season 3 ended with the death of Joe&rsquo;s wife, Love (Victoria Pedretti), and he ends up giving their son away before faking his death. Although it&rsquo;s not specified just how much time has passed between seasons 3 and 4, it&rsquo;s not very long, as the show is still set in the present day.
The main issue with You season 4 is that Joe&rsquo;s character hasn&rsquo;t changed, and his behavior starts to feel repetitive, which is why it would have been a great place to have a time skip. It would make sense for Joe to be lying low for a while, given that he murdered Love. However, it would also have been interesting to see Joe living a normal, quiet life, only to be eventually overwhelmed by his temptations and pulled back into his obsessive ways.</p>
<p>2  The Mandalorian
Should Have Had A Time Skip After Season 1</p>
<p>The Mandalorian</p>
<p>Release Date    November 12, 2019     Cast    Werner Herzog , Emily Swallow , Pedro Pascal , Nick Nolte , Omid Abtahi , Gina Carano , Carl Weathers , Giancarlo Esposito     Seasons    3</p>
<p>The timeline of The Mandalorian seasons 1 and 2 essentially broke the Star Wars universe, especially when considering The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka. In these two seasons, there is so much that happens: traveling across the galaxy, visiting various planets, and encountering an array of characters. While it could be possible that Grogu and Din (Pedro Pascal) just had a very action-packed year, it feels unrealistic and affects the pacing of the show, even more so after they get separated.
A lot of quick character development in this time, most notably with Grogu, who not only seems to speed through his training with Luke (Mark Hamill) but then decides to rejoin Din, all in a very short period. An actual time skip during these events would have made a lot of sense for The Mandalorian. If season 2 had begun with Grogu and Din having been apart for a decent amount of time, a lot more of the show&rsquo;s events may not have felt as rushed.</p>
<p>1  Cobra Kai
Should Have A Time Skip After Season 5</p>
<p>Cobra Kai<br>
Comedy
Drama
Action</p>
<p>Seasons    5     Cast    Tanner Buchanan , Xolo Mariduena , Mary Mouser , Connor Murdock , Ralph Macchio , Nichole Brown , Jacob Bertrand , Griffin Santopietro , William Zabka     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix</p>
<p>The Cobra Kai timeline is rather short compared to the actual off-screen time between seasons, which causes issues with some of its characters&rsquo; ages. While Cobra Kai focuses on the reignited rivalry between Johnny (William Zabka) and Daniel (Ralph Macchio), it also introduces a group of teenage students. For example, when introduced in season 1, most of the new generation of characters are 15.
While a year went by on-screen between seasons 1 and 2, it took until season 5 for another calendar year to pass. It&rsquo;s not unusual to see actors play characters younger than their actual age, but in season 6 films, some of the Cobra Kai actors will be more than a decade older than Sam is supposed to be. If Cobra Kai season 6 were to introduce a time skip, even of just a few years, it would help characters catch up to the actual age of their actors, making their performances feel more authentic.</p>
