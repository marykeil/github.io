## Literature Review
Selling The OC season 3 is packed with many dramatic moments, including a breakup and physical altercation between two male cast members.




Selling The OC season 3 seems dramatic, as the trailer shows some of the wildest moments yet. The Netflix series has been widely popular since 2022. However, it wasn’t until season 2 that the on-screen tension picked up, and cast members faced real challenges. In the last season, Kayla Cardona called out Polly Brindle at Gio Helou’s party by mentioning her makeout incident with Tyler Stanaland. Brandi Marshall and Alex Hall also had an altercation. Brandi wasn’t happy about Alex flirting with Tyler and almost slapped Alex in Cabo.
Alexandra Jarvis and Alexandra Rose fell apart in another unpredictable moment on the show. The two cast members were on friendly terms in season 1, but things worsened in season 2. The two ended their friendship with no hopes of reconciliation. The season was full of wild plot twists, but the upcoming one seems even more dramatic. Selling The OC season 3 trailer shows some noteworthy moments indicating that fans will have much to discuss when the show drops on Netflix again.

The trailer doesn’t show what Alex may have done, but it may have to do with her relationship with Tyler.
