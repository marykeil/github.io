When Akshay Jakhete was first introduced on Indian Matchmaking, the clock was ticking, even for a successful businessman. Expert matchmaker Sima Taparia was searching for a suitable woman for Akshay. At the time of filming, Akshay was 25 and supremely eligible. While Taparia eventually did find someone Akshay and his mother approved of, the Mumbai-based businessman still caught the attention of many female fans. Considering his dating life is more of an open book, courtesy of Indian Matchmaking, there&#39;s a lot to know about what he does for work.




Fresh out of college in Boston, Akshay returned to India, only to find his family waiting for him to get married. With the help of Indian Matchmaking and Taparia, his mom, Preeti, wanted a wedding as soon as possible. Akshay was considered difficult on Indian Matchmaking for rejecting so many potential matches. He then revealed that he wanted his wife to be like his mother. Eventually, he met his match in a Chartered Accountant, Radhika. Their families conduct a “roka” (pre-engagement ceremony). Unfortunately, the Indian Matchmaking engagement was short-lived. Akshay is now focused on his work with the family business again.
