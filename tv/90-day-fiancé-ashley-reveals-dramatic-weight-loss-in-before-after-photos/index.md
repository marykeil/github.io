## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Ashley Michelle is looking different in her latest photos. The witch from season 10 is &#34;happy&#34; with her dramatic weight loss.




90 Day Fiancé star Ashley Michelle is revealing her weight-loss story in unseen before-after photos. Ashley is a 33-year-old woman from Rochester, New York who is a witch by profession. Ashley met construction worker Manuel on New Year&#39;s Eve in Ecuador 10 years ago and fell in love with him. Ashley and Manuel became engaged after a week. She tried to have a long-distance relationship with Manuel when she came back to America. Ashley and Manuel spent seven years apart before he messaged her when she was just out of a relationship. 90 DF&#39;s Ashley went to Ecuador again, where Manuel proposed to her for the second time.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 is documenting Manuel and Ashley&#39;s journey to becoming a married couple within 90 days. However, there&#39;s another journey that Ashley hasn&#39;t discussed on the show, which is about her remarkable weight loss.

          

Ashley recently had a Q&amp;A session with her followers on Instagram. One fan wanted to tell Ashley that she looked &#34;amazing.&#34; Ashley replied, &#34;thank you babe.&#34; She said she&#39;d put in a ton of &#34;hard work, discipline &amp; commitment&#34; to gain her current physique. Ashley shared side-by-side pictures of herself before and after she dropped her extra pounds.

 Are Ashley and Manuel Still Together? 
          

Ashley&#39;s present-day selfie showed her in a gym wearing a black sports bra and leggings as she revealed her new, slimmer body. In a different Instagram story, Ashley replied to a fan who wanted to know if Ashley was &#34;happy.&#34; Ashley posted a video of herself dancing. She told the fan, &#34;I must say, I am the happiest I have ever been in my life.” Ashley said she was mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually satisfied. &#34;Blessed be the Goddess,&#34; Ashley wrote. She did not reveal whether Manuel was the reason behind her happiness. However, Ashley has hardly been happy with Manuel whenever they are together on screen in season 10.


 




Manuel didn&#39;t like that Ashley&#39;s dog Rico Suave slept on the bed. It led to an argument between the couple as soon as Manuel stepped into her house. Religious man Manuel didn&#39;t approve of his future wife being a &#34;witch.&#34; According to him, witches were evil. Manuel got along only when they were having sex. Ashley took Manuel to therapy against his wishes. Ashley was livid at Manuel after the session because of his rudeness. Moreover, Manuel demanded $250 to send to his family by the end of the month. Obviously, Ashley was required to do it since he didn&#39;t work in America.

Ashley has been feeling disrespected by Manuel on 90 Day Fiancé. She&#39;s now left wondering if she is making the right decision by marrying him. However, Ashley also didn&#39;t want to end the relationship they&#39;d worked so hard on building within 30 days. However, Ashley recently posted a selfie with Manuel on her Instagram feed to wish him a happy birthday. The selfie seemed to indicate that the couple is still together, and most probably, married. Whatever issues they had between them, Ashley and Manuel may have overcome in the past few months, which is how Ashley is feeling happier than she&#39;s ever been.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
