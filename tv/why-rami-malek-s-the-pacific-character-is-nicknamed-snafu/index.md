## Literature Review
Rami Malek&#39;s memorable character in the celebrated HBO series The Pacific is given a sarcastic nickname that actually has a significant WWII meaning. 




Rami Malek&#39;s character in the HBO miniseries The Pacific got his nickname based on a real-life military expression. The acclaimed war series chronicles the Pacific Theatre of World War II told through the eyes of a group of young United States Marines. The series was made by the same creators of HBO&#39;s other celebrated WWII miniseries Band of Brothers and offers one of the most gruesomely realistic depictions of the horrors of the historic battlefield.




Malek plays PFC Merriell &#34;Snafu&#34; Shelton, one of the central characters of The Pacific, who appears in six of the ten episodes. The role was one of Malek&#39;s most significant of the early part of his acting career, which likely played a part in his eventual casting in Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s The Master in 2012 and the Emmy Award-winning series Mr. Robot, which aired from 2015 - 2019. Malek also noticeably starred as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, for which he earned an Oscar, and as the James Bond villain Lyutsifer Safin in 2021&#39;s No Time To Die.

                  Every The Pacific Episode, Ranked Worst To Best   HBO&#39;s critically-acclaimed miniseries The Pacific tells a tight story of World War II survival in ten parts, but not every entry is created equally.    


 Rami Malek&#39;s The Pacific Nickname References The SNAFU Slang Expression 
          




Rami Malek&#39;s character&#39;s nickname in The Pacific is in reference to a very specific military slang expression that was popularized during World War II. Malek&#39;s character &#34;Snafu&#34; is based on the acronym for the expression &#34;Situation Normal: All F––d Up&#34;, which is meant as a sarcastic sentiment about any given current scenario that appears awful but is the typical state of affairs. The origin of the slang military term is thought to be directly sourced from the United States Marines Corp. during World War II, making it highly appropriate to be featured in The Pacific.

The nickname &#34;Snafu&#34; is also relevant to the cocky attitude that Malek&#39;s character displayed throughout the HBO miniseries. In a similar character arc to the young soldiers in the Academy Award-winning All Quiet on the Western Front (2022), Malek&#39;s &#34;Snafu&#34; soldier gradually has that overconfident personality, and quite frankly his humanity, stripped from him as the horrors of war take over and begin to consume him. He often got lost, reckless, and in trouble, which made the &#34;Snafu&#34; nickname a perfect fit.




                  The Pacific: Why Snafu Didn&#39;t Say Goodbye To Sledge   At the end of The Pacific, Snafu leaves the train without saying goodbye to Sledge, which raises questions about why the men never got a real ending.    



 Snafu Is Also A Cartoon Character Created During WW2 
         

Malek&#39;s character&#39;s nickname &#34;Snafu&#34; also references a military cartoon that was created during World War II. The animated Private Snafu was notoriously lazy and prone to make mistakes, which made him the perfect character to use in instructional videos to show soldiers how things can go wrong. The character was created by Frank Capra, who directed several classic movies such as It&#39;s A Wonderful Life, It Happened One Night, and Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. In reality, Private Snafu was one of the most effective educational methods for American soldiers who struggled with literacy. The Pacific can be streamed on Netflix and Max.
