## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor Wedding with Gerry and Theresa was executed perfectly, but buzz surrounding a Golden Bachelorette spin-off has come to a halt.




The Golden Bachelor’s Golden Wedding may have gone off without a hitch, but there was some disappointing news from the producers of the series about the future of another spin-off. Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist’s love story came full circle during their live televised wedding event, complete with a massive showing of Bachelor Nation alums. With everyone watching the happy couple tearfully exchange vows, there&#39;s been a lot of speculation over what&#39;s next for the Golden era of the franchise. After the success of The Golden Bachelor season 1, anticipation has been building for a possible Golden Bachelorette, in hopes of seeing fan-favorites find their own love.




While spin-offs of The Golden Bachelor are almost guaranteed to happen, according to The Wrap, ABC’s EVP Rob Mills shared that The Golden Bachelorette season 1, or any other Golden series, most likely won’t be happening soon. “We will take the time we need to be thoughtful and meticulous with the same approach for any subsequent seasons,” Rob shared, explaining that the original iteration of The Golden Bachelor took four years to get off the ground. According to Rob, any new Golden content will be handled with the same careful touch they gave to The Golden Bachelor season 1.

The Golden Bachelor’s EP &amp; co-showrunner Jason Ehrlich shared that The Golden Bachelorette will likely look quite different than The Golden Bachelor season 1. He explained that the production team “hope[s] that we do get the opportunity and that we get the same genuine feeling of reasonable people who are looking for love.” In trying to recreate the same genuine feelings, it’s likely the producers don&#39;t want to rush anything surrounding The Golden Bachelorette despite there being a demand for the series and a massive amount of buzz about the idea.


 

While The Golden Bachelorette season 1 may not be premiering on ABC anytime soon, there has already been some major speculation about the potential for the series, especially after the cast of The Golden Bachelor turned out for Gerry and Theresa’s wedding. While there were initial calls for second runner-up Faith Martin to be the lead of her own Golden spin-off, Gerry&#39;s heartbreaking end with Leslie Fhima led to calls that she should take the lead spot. Though there was hope that an announcement would be made during The Golden Bachelor finale or the Golden Wedding special, things are moving more conservatively.




With Gerry and Theresa’s wedding over, there are still things for Bachelor Nation to look forward to. Though The Golden Bachelorette won’t be coming anytime soon, the upcoming season of The Bachelor promises to be a major moment for the franchise. With Joey Graziadei taking on the lead role for The Bachelor season 28, the franchise is continuing to create love stories for Bachelor Nation to root for, and in the future, The Golden Bachelor or The Golden Bachelorette will likely return with a fresh new take on mature love.
