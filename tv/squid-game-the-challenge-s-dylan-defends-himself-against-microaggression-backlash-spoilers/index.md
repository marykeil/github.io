# Squid Game The Challenge s Dylan Defends Himself Against Microaggression Backlash (SPOILERS)


## SUMMARY 



  Dylan Scanlon addresses accusations of microaggressions on Squid Game: The Challenge, claiming that the edited version doesn&#39;t accurately portray what happened.   Some viewers argue that Dylan needs to be educated about his behavior and its impact, particularly when asking Aurora, a Black woman, to stop yelling when she wasn&#39;t.   Dylan&#39;s lack of accountability and disrespectful behavior towards Aurora in a high-stakes game is disappointing and not representative of other players&#39; conduct on Squid Game: The Challenge.

## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Dylan (player 065) speaks up about the microaggression backlash he&#39;s facing after his behavior during the Marbles game.




Squid Game: The Challenge player 065, Dylan Scanlon, spoke out about the accusations that he lodged microaggressions at another player during the Marbles game in a recent episode. While not quite as dangerous as the original South Korean drama Squid Game, which the reality TV competition series is based on, Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 creates an entirely different level of drama. With 456 players having started out in the competition, as those left in the game are thinning out, the social dynamics between players are being scrutinized on a closer, more in-depth level. The stakes are high, and with a prize of $4.56 million on the line, anyone could win Squid Game: The Challenge.




In a recent Instagram post, Dylan shared that he didn&#39;t feel his character was accurately portrayed in that episode of Squid Game: The Challenge. &#34;It’s important to note, what you see is only the edited version of what really happened,&#34; Dylan shared, explaining the rules of the Marbles game that he played with Aurora, player 399. In the clip, Dylan asks Aurora to stop yelling at him when she hasn&#39;t raised her voice, which is a common microaggression. Dylan, a white man, asking a Black woman using a normal speaking voice to stop yelling shows some potential internalized racism.


 

Dylan continued in the post, sharing, &#34;Me following instructions isn’t a judgment of my character or who I am as a person. Linking the confessionals directly after the game from both player 399 &amp; myself (065) in my bio. More to come but I’m not a manipulator &amp; I’m not a bully - I won’t be made out to be that way, I was just adhering to the rules of the game.&#34; There&#39;s not a lot of interest in Dylan&#39;s explanation, though.





 Squid Game: The Challenge Fans Aren&#39;t Buying Dylan&#39;s Excuse 
          

Many Squid Game: The Challenge viewers are correcting Dylan in the comments section of his post. While his excuse may seem like a valid one, many feel like Dylan needs some education on his behavior and how to rectify it. One comment explains the issue with Dylan&#39;s behavior. &#34;I don’t think any of us really care about the rules of the game that you all established,&#34; @quinthomasx wrote. &#34;The bigger issue is...[you] specifically telling her to stop yelling at you when she wasn’t raising her voice at all...She is a black woman and sometimes black people are falsely labeled as aggressive or loud.&#34;

Though Dylan may not see the error of his ways, it&#39;s clear that his actions have some sort of subtext to them that proves he needs to be more careful and respectful with the way he speaks to others. In a game where the stakes are so high, and the pressure is even higher, it can be difficult to think or speak with clarity. Regardless, the foundation of respect and understanding for others should be present at all times, despite the circumstances. Dylan&#39;s lack of accountability for his behavior isn&#39;t unexpected, but it&#39;s still disheartening to see in such a large, public venue.

While Dylan&#39;s behavior may not be out of the ordinary, it&#39;s not something viewers have otherwise seen on Squid Game: The Challenge. In the way that Dylan spoke to Aurora, he made it clear that he didn&#39;t have respect for her and didn&#39;t feel wrong to belittle her in a difficult moment. Dylan allowed his own ego to take over, and while the game can be pressurized enough to make that happen, other players were speaking clearly and deliberately without disrespecting others. With just one episode of Squid Game: The Challenge to go, it&#39;s possible Dylan&#39;s is the only microaggression viewers will see this season.




The Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 finale streams Wednesday, December 6 on Netflix.
