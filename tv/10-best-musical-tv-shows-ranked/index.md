TV musicals are renowned for their fabulous musical performances with meticulously choreographed dance routines, beautifully composed songs that often become instant hits, and stunning acting and singing performances.

The episodic nature of a TV series provides an excellent platform for musicals to unfold their stories and explore their characters gradually, intertwining music with drama and comedy in a way that&#39;s both engaging and innovative. With streaming services now in the mix, there&#39;s more room for experimentation and creativity in the musical genre than ever before.









 








 10  Nashville (2012) 
Drama and rivalries saturate the country music scene.
        

Nashville is a musical drama following the lives of fictitious country music stars in Nashville, Tennessee. The show initially explored the interesting rivalry of country music stars Rayna James (Connie Britton) and Juliette Barnes (Hayden Panettiere) with depth, offering a feminist view of the country music industry. However, the show gradually lost its substance in later seasons, descending into a soapy mess of accidents, love triangles, and melodrama between Nashville&#39;s characters, including ridiculous plotlines with faked miscarriages. Despite fantastic performances, the series increasingly relied on implausible scenarios and clichés, ultimately losing its charm with Rayna&#39;s dramatic departure in the fifth season.
Stream on Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV. 






 9  Smash (2012) 
Musical theater actors juggle stage careers with their personal lives.
        

Smash is a musical TV drama series created by playwright Theresa Rebeck and further shaped by Robert Greenblatt for NBC. The show follows the lives of several musical theater actors as they attempt to balance the demands of the stage with their own lives. It features original music by composers Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. The foundation for a great musical series is all there - fantastic music, excellent casting, and even Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. However, no matter how catchy and enjoyable the musical performances are, the show is let down by clichés, boring plot lines, and melodrama.
Stream on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 8  Empire (2015) 
The power struggle within the family behind Empire Entertainment
        

The 2015 hip-hop drama Empire tells the story of a power struggle within a musical family. The show&#39;s first season, focusing on the Shakespearean battle between three sons vying for their father Lucious Lyon&#39;s record company, Empire Entertainment, was a hit with fans and critics alike. However, by season two, Empire loses itself in far-fetched storylines and even sidelines some of the fans&#39; favorite characters, like Cookie (Taraji P. Henson). Season three brings back some of what was so great about the show originally, with dramatic twists and even a guest star appearance from Mariah Carey. Sadly, Empire ended without a season finale airing.

 7  Galavant (2015) 
Knight Galavant undergoes adventures in a whimsical, song-filled world.


 







ABC&#39;s fairy-tale musical comedy Galavant combines fantasy satire with musical performances in one of the most underrated shows of the last decade. The musical series follows the adventures of a valiant knight, Galavant, as he embarks on quests involving love, revenge, and eccentric characters in a whimsical, song-filled world. The show humorously deconstructs fairy-tale tropes with jest and wit. Sadly, despite its cleverness and fun, the show struggled with low ratings and was overshadowed by bigger shows. It was one of ABC’s worst shows that year and was cut short to just two fun-filled seasons.
Stream on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney&#43;. 






 6  Zoey&#39;s Extraordinary Playlist (2020) 
Zoey gains the power to hear inner emotions as songs following an MRI accident.

Zoey&#39;s Extraordinary Playlist is a musical dramedy following Zoey, a character who suddenly finds herself able to hear people&#39;s hidden emotions through song after an MRI mishap.
The show exudes optimism and shines when it really nails its main theme - that music can express our unspoken emotions and truths. The series also explores complicated issues of grief, gender fluidity, and illness with stoicism. However, many of the musical selections are extremely on the nose, and the show tends to be rather cheesy at times. Nonetheless, it&#39;s an entertaining show that&#39;s easy to become engrossed in.

 flight of the conchords 

 Release Date   June 7, 2007    Cast   Jemaine Clement , Bret McKenzie    Genres   Sitcom    Seasons   2    




The fantastic HBO show Flight of the Conchords follows the story of two New Zealand musicians as they seek fame in New York. Starring Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie, the show captures the duo&#39;s adventures in the city with low-budget charm and quirky humor that differs from HBO&#39;s usual big-budget style. The comedy leans closer to self-parody and refreshing self-awareness that blends perfectly with the show&#39;s silliness. One of the few gripes about the show is that it only has two seasons.
