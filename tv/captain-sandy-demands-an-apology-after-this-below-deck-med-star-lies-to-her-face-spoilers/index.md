# Captain Sandy Demands An Apology After This Below Deck Med Star Lies To Her Face (SPOILERS)


## SUMMARY 



  Captain Sandy Yawn expects Max Salvador to apologize for his food-related blunder, as he complained about a lack of food when there was actually pasta available.   Max&#39;s bad attitude and constant complaints have made him unlikable among his co-workers on the yacht.   The crew&#39;s main goal is to keep the guests happy and provide the best experience possible, so Max should focus on working hard and helping others instead of complaining about the food.

## Literature Review
Captain Sandy Yawn gets furious after one of her Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 crew members falsely complains about not having food.




WARNING! This article contains spoilers for Below Deck Mediterranean season 8!




Below Deck Mediterranean’s Captain Sandy Yawn expects Max Salvador to apologize to her for his food-related blunder. The new deckhand has had a fairly decent journey on the yacht. He had followed the bosun’s instructions and proved himself to be a useful asset to the team. Unfortunately, he has recently become unlikable due to his bad attitude toward his superiors. In previous episodes, Max made a big deal about not having enough breaks and complained unnecessarily. He also argued with Luka Brunton and Lara Du Preez about the schedule, spreading a lot of negativity on the yacht among his co-workers.

Most recently, Max made a fuss about the lack of food on the yacht and complained about it in front of captain Sandy. However, Lara exposed him by sharing that there was pasta, which made the captain very angry. Bravo posted a sneak peek from Below Deck Med season 8, episode 14, where Sandy called Max into the cockpit and called him out.


 




She said, “Don’t ever lie to me again,” stating that the junior deckhand shouldn’t have thrown a fit about the food when there was pasta. Max then changed his stance and said he wasn’t craving pasta because it negatively affects his digestion. However, captain Sandy told him he was wrong and added, “What you need to do now, say you’re sorry.”


 Kyle Viljoen Reveals What Caused His Below Deck Med Downfall 
          

The preview clip also showed the controversial Kyle Viljoen sharing what caused him to lose his reputation on the yacht. He said, “It’s been an interesting ride for me,” as the next few scenes showed his most dramatic moments from Below Deck Med season 8. One clip showed Kyle crying on the floor, while another showed him calling his former best friend, Natalya “Nat” Scudder, a “fake a** b****.” Kyle looked regretful of his past actions as he claimed that there were certain “expectations” that he failed to meet. He admitted that his inability to attain what was expected of him led to his downfall.




    

It seems Kyle understands what exactly led him to become unlikable. The South African man was previously on Below Deck Med season 7, where he seemingly learned from his mistakes. Captain Sandy invited him back onto her yacht because she had high hopes for him. There was hope that Kyle&#39;s changed behavior would be on full display. However, he let everyone down by acting way worse than last year. In 2023, Kyle went from being somewhat likable to despicable. His actions cause Natalya to quit Below Deck Med, which is unforgivable.

As for Max, he deserves to be called out by captain Sandy. The yacht crew’s prime purpose is to keep their guests happy and feed them the best food. They aim to make the experience comfortable for those who pay for chartering. Each cast member’s time on the yacht isn’t a trip or a party. They are there to work hard, eat what’s available, and help each other. If Max wants to eat what he wants, he should probably ask the chef or cook it himself. The Below Deck Mediterranean cast member shouldn’t complain about the lack of food when it’s available.






Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
