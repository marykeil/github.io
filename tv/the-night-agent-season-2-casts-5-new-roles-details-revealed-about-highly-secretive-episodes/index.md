## Literature Review
The Night Agent has added five new cast members, whose character descriptions offer clues as to the storyline for the upcoming season 2.




The Night Agent season 2 has brought on a variety of new cast members, with character descriptions hinting at details of the mysterious new story. The show stars Gabriel Basso as FBI agent Peter Sutherland, whose nighttime shift manning a mysterious phone for Night Action led him into an action-packed adventure to uncover a major conspiracy. The show, which became Netflix&#39;s third most-viewed debut program, was quickly renewed for season 2, which is set to follow a new storyline with a largely new ensemble cast.




Netflix has revealed that five new cast members have been added to The Night Agent season 2, which recently announced the addition of The Leftovers&#39; Amanda Warren in late 2023. The new cast members are Brittany Snow as Peter&#39;s original Night Action partner Alice, Berto Colon as fixer Solomon, Teddy Sears as under-investigation intelligence officer Warren, Louis Herthum as well-connected businessman Jacob Monroe, and Arienne Mandi as UN aide Noor. It has also been confirmed that season 1 stars Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan will be reprising their roles as Peter Sutherland and Rose Larkin respectively.


 Where You Know The New Night Agent Cast Members 
         

Quite a few of these new cast members are widely recognizable names, perhaps drawn to the show due to the success of The Night Agent season 1. This includes Snow, who is best known for movies including the Pitch Perfect trilogy, Hairspray, Prom Night (2008), and X. Sears is likewise well-known for playing Hunter Zolomon on the CW superhero show The Flash, a role he reprised in the 2023 series finale.






Hunter Zolomon, also known as Zoom, is a character who has superspeed just like The Flash and jealously guards that power.




The other three cast members also have extensive television experience, including Herthum, who has appeared on Hacks, Dirty John, Chicago Med, Westworld, True Blood, and The Peripheral. Mandi has a similarly robust filmography, which includes The L Word: Generation Q, NCIS: Los Angeles, and In the Vault. Additionally, Colon, who is perhaps best known for his role as Lorenzo Tejada on Power Book II: Ghost, has previously worked with Netflix on their flagship comedy Orange is the New Black.

The show taking a new narrative direction in its second season has the potential to alienate viewers who loved the storyline of season 1. However, bringing on this many strong additions to the Night Agent cast could very well help propel the upcoming season to the same level of notoriety. The new mission for the Night Action program seems much more sure of success with this many entertainment veterans providing their services.
