 9  Player 002, Favour 
An Actor From Spain
        

As an actor, Favour has been able to make himself appealing to the masses on Squid Game: The Challenge. Strong and agile, Favour has done well on the competition&#39;s physical side, but the game&#39;s social aspect has been more difficult for the entertainer. Favour&#39;s athleticism has made him a threat, but his personality has drawn some of the other competitors in and allowed him to make alliances in the game. With a big target on his back for other players, his future is still up in the air. While he may not be the sole player standing, Favour could still easily win Squid Game: The Challenge.





 8  Player 302, LeAnn 
Playing With Her Son Trey
        

LeAnn may be playing alongside her son, Trey, but there&#39;s much more to her than simply being a mother. LeAnn hopes to break the stereotypes younger people have about older competitors during her time on Squid Game: The Challenge. An athlete of her own right, LeAnn was the first woman at Kansas State University to receive a full scholarship for basketball, playing throughout her time in school and long after. LeAnn has been great under pressure and could take herself all the way to the end of Squid Game: The Challenge if she plays her cards right.





 7  Player 018, Bee 
A MENSA Certified Genius
        

Although Bee is one of the most intelligent people in the game, she&#39;s using her smarts to keep herself under the radar on Squid Game: The Challenge. A 28-year-old in the gaming industry, Bee joined MENSA at 13-years-old and boasts that her intelligence is ranked in the top 0.5% in the entire United Kingdom. While Bee may be smart, she&#39;s been doing the physical challenges on Squid Game: The Challenge to the best of her ability and coming out strong. While her social gameplay may not be as predictable as some other contestants, she has a definite shot at taking the prize on the Netflix hit.





 6  Player 232, Rick 
A Grandfather With Game


 







Rick, who celebrated his 69th birthday in the Squid Game: The Challenge dormitory, is a long shot to win the competition, but he could make it far with the strategies he&#39;s employed so far in the game. As a jack of all trades, Rick has held all kinds of jobs and finds his passion to be beekeeping and gardening. The game has been difficult for Rick in terms of athletics, but the moral situations Rick has been put into by the tests throughout the game have been a place for him to shine. With Rick&#39;s sharp mind and his ability to blend into the crowd, he could find himself taken far on Squid Game: The Challenge.





 5  Player 097, Jada 
A Marketing Coordinator From New Jersey
        

As a 24-year-old Marketing Coordinator, Jada is aware of what it takes to sell herself and is doing just that on Squid Game: The Challenge. Originally from New Jersey, Jada shared that she was the most excited to be fully immersed into the game of Squid Game: The Challenge, though she wasn&#39;t looking forward to living in the dorms. Despite the fact that she may not be the most comfortable, Jada has been doing well with the physical and strategic sides of the game. In working with other contestants on Squid Game: The Challenge, Jada has opened herself up to alliances that could carry her through the game.





 4  Player 030, Jinwoo 
A New Father Looking To Win


Although Jinwoo had to take time away from his new baby to play Squid Game: The Challenge, the lack of sleep he&#39;s surely used to with a young child has likely helped him in the game. While his road hasn&#39;t always been easy, Jinwoo is hoping that his skills can take him far in the game. Originally from Illinois, Jinwoo is a 27-year-old in the finance industry and hopes he can use his intelligence to his advantage on Squid Game: The Challenge. While there&#39;s no way to tell who will win the game, it&#39;s possible Jinwoo will be able to use his athleticism and charm to take home the prize.





 3  Player 301, Trey 
Playing With A Familial Advantage
        

One duo has been making waves on Squid Game: The Challenge throughout the competition. Trey, a 25-year-old delivery driver from Illinois, is playing the game in tandem with his mother, LeAnn. While Trey and LeAnn have been threatening to the other contestants because of their close bond, it&#39;s also kept them a part of the game. Trey has been great in the physical challenges and has done his best to keep the confidence of his older mother while they compete in grueling conditions. While Trey may not make it to the end with his mother, he could still make it on his own and take the $4.56 million prize home.





 2  Player 183, TJ Stukes 
A Professional Athlete
        

TJ Stukes, one of the players left on Squid Game: The Challenge, may look somewhat familiar to viewers as he used to be a professional basketball player. He currently works as an assistant coach for a college basketball team in New Mexico, and is hoping he can use his coaching abilities to lead him through the game. With Squid Game: The Challenge pushing TJ into a leadership position, his target may be bigger than other players, but he has a great chance to win with his athleticism and leadership at hand. TJ is hoping to bring home the massive prize to his wife and two children.





 1  Player 179, Chaney 
A Teacher From Texas
        

Chaney is a 32-year-old teacher from Texas who&#39;s still in the running to take the grand prize of Squid Game: The Challenge after the most recent episode. While Chaney&#39;s struggled through some of the challenges, she&#39;s been able to outlast the difficult tests that have already eliminated over half the competition on the series. According to Netflix, Chaney was more concerned with what the contestants were going to be fed during the competition than the tests themselves before the game began. Though she feels her weakness is making impulsive decisions, Chaney may be able to use her impulsivity to her advantage.
