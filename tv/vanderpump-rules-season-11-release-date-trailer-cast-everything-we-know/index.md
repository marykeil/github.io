With Vanderpump Rules season 10 making a comeback for the series, many are already interested in everything there is to know about Vanderpump Rules season 11. With Tom Sandoval&#39;s affair with Raquel Leviss rocking the VPR world to its core, the next installment of the series will likely look a lot different than the show viewers are used to. Ariana Madix, Tom&#39;s ex-partner, has openly said she&#39;s not interested in filming with Tom or Raquel in the future. What will this mean for the future of the series?




Vanderpump Rules season 11 is moving into an entirely new era. Many cast members no longer work at SUR or with Lisa Vanderpump, and their lives change drastically yearly. With breakups, babies, and businesses to consider, it&#39;s a new era for the Vanderpump Rules cast. The show will likely change along with them. As one of the most-watched series in Bravo history, at this point, it&#39;s clear that even with a new direction and changes on the horizon, the only place Vanderpump Rules can go from here is up.
