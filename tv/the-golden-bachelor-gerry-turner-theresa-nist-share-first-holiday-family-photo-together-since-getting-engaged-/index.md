## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist are celebrating the holidays together for the first time, along with their families. 




Gerry Turner, The Golden Bachelor lead, is celebrating the holidays with his new fiancé, Theresa Nist, and their families. The new couple began a relationship while starring in the new Bachelor franchise series together this year. Gerry was named The Golden Bachelor season 1 lead over the summer, and the show began filming almost right away. For months, viewers speculated who would win Gerry&#39;s heart, and it was not shocking to see that Theresa was the one to win Gerry over.




On Saturday, December 9, Gerry took to Instagram to share a photo of his and Theresa&#39;s family getting ready to spend the holidays together. He wrote in the caption, &#34;Going to be a very Gerry Christmas with Theresa and our blended family.&#34; In the photo, Theresa is sitting next to her daughter, Jen Woolston, and her daughter-in-law, Amanda Nist, along with Gerry’s two daughters, Jenny Young and Angie Turner, above them. Besides Theresa, the four women are all wearing bright red sweaters that read &#34;A Very Gerry Christmas&#34; in white letters.

 Gerry Shared A Holiday Instagram Photo Of Their Blended Family 
          




In the picture, Theresa was also wearing a pink sweater that seemed to have some sort of lettering on it as well, but her arm was covering the writing on the garment. The sweet family photo was shared less than two weeks after Gerry and Theresa&#39;s engagement was revealed on The Golden Bachelor season finale. The couple seemed madly in love once they made their first public debut as fiancé during the live After The Finale Rose special with host Jesse Palmer.

During the live special, Gerry and Theresa also said they planned on getting married as soon as possible and didn&#39;t want to wait too long to tie the knot. That&#39;s when it was revealed that Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding will be broadcast live on ABC on January 4, 2024. Now that they are both in their 70s, Gerry and Theresa don&#39;t see the need to wait so long to walk down the aisle. It&#39;s not surprising that ABC is giving Gerry and Theresa a chance to get married on live TV. The Golden Bachelor has done incredibly well since its premiere, with rumors of a potential Golden Bachelorette coming soon. 




Now that Gerry and Theresa&#39;s relationship is out in the public eye, the two seem excited to spend their first holiday season together. Not only are they spending it together, but they have involved their families in their holiday celebrations. The Golden Bachelor couple has created a cute little blended family together.
