## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda has two kids. Juance and JC are coming to America to stay with her and Gino. Jasmine is scared of having a new baby.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is revealing the real reason she’s been avoiding having a baby with Gino Palazzolo. Panama resident Jasmine is a 36-year-old former English literature teacher. Jasmine was married previously to a man who is a doctor and a lawyer. Jasmine has accused the man of cheating on her. After their divorce, Jasmine and her ex-husband share custody of Jasmine&#39;s two sons Juance and JC. While Gino was also married to a Brazilian woman named Denise for eight years, they never had any kids together.




Gino was excited about starting a family with Jasmine even before he had seen her in person. However, Jasmine was secretly on birth control during Gino’s first Panama trip. The last time Gino mentioned a baby, Jasmine reminded him that they were getting old and Gino was going to retire soon. She told him kids were chaotic and that she still needed help from her family in raising her two sons. When Gino reminded Jasmine he has his own family in America, Jasmine commented that thinking of having babies at the time was delusional and crazy. However, there was a different reason why Jasmine was avoiding the baby topic.

 Jasmine Pineda Has Two Sons From 1st Marriage 
          




Jasmine first mentioned her kids during 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5, episode 1. Jasmine said that while they were no longer babies, they were always going to remain her “babies.” She’d said her eldest son lived with her ex-husband and her younger son lived with her. However, Jasmine’s son, JC, has a special condition because of which he was having a hard time in the city with the lockdown during the pandemic. Jasmine’s mother decided to take him with her “temporarily to the countryside.” Jasmine added she was missing her son “so much” and 2020 was “very difficult” for her.



 Jasmine Was Affected By Son&#39;s Diagnosis 
          

In 90 Day Fiancé season 10, episode 12, Jasmine revealed that one of the “hardest things” that she’d experienced as a mom “was to accept” her younger son’s diagnosis. “You picture your son or your daughter, like, ‘Oh, I’ll do this, I’ll do that’ and then reality is different,” she added. Jasmine asked Gino what would happen if they had a kid and “he’s also special needs.” Jasmine told the cameras that before she agreed to marry Gino, they made a decision that both her kids would have to come to America. Jasmine said she shared custody with her ex-husband, who’s their father but, “JC, he’s special needs.”




Jasmine explained that it’s very hard for JC to communicate. “He doesn’t have a verbal language,” she added. However, Jasmine said that what makes it difficult to have a child with special needs “is not the child.” She said it was “the people.” Jasmine said some people were mean with no tolerance. Jasmine felt glad that her son sometimes didn’t even realize what was going on around him, “but me as a mom, I do,” she told Gino. Jasmine mentioned that if they go to a restaurant, and he’s not behaving like a “neurotypical kid,” she has to deal with the stares and the “ugly looks,” even from the restaurant staff.

“And it hurts me a lot,” Jasmine confessed. She admitted that she doesn’t know if she will have the strength to go through another pregnancy. “What if I cannot give you a neurotypical kid?” she asked Gino while adding that the thought scares her to death.



 Gino Understands Jasmine&#39;s Pain 

 




“He’s still a child, it makes no difference whether he has a disability or not,” 90 Day Fiancé star Gino assured Jasmine, while she kept insisting that “even doctors cannot tell why.” Gino assured Jasmine that it wasn’t her fault. It was painful for Gino to see Jasmine so sad. He felt hopeless because there was nothing much he could do about it. Gino wanted to assure Jasmine that even if they didn’t have a child in the future, he was always going to be there for her. Gino had decided never to abandon Jasmine, no matter what happened.

Moved by Gino’s reaction to her confession, 90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine realized how lucky she was to have Gino as a partner, and her sons were lucky that he was in their lives. “If we ever have a baby, he or she is gonna be very lucky to have you as a dad,” Jasmine told her husband-to-be.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
