## Literature Review
Russian 90 Day Fiancé star Julia Trubkina makes an exciting announcement, revealing the latest career she&#39;s set her eyes on in the U.S.




90 Day Fiancé star Julia Trubkina has announced a surprising new career as fans await her possible franchise comeback with Brandon Gibbs. Julia is a Russian woman who worked as a go-go dancer when she met Brandan, a pest control specialist from Virginia. Julia left her city-slicker life behind to move to the U.S. on a K-1 visa during 90 Day Fiancé season 8. Little did Julia know that she&#39;d have to wake up early and tend to animals at the farm while also tackling the constant interference from Brandon&#39;s parents Ron and Betty Gibbs. Years later, Julia has become a favorite of her in-laws and lives in a separate house with Brandon.




However, Julia is still trying to find a job that she loves in America after Brandon expressed his displeasure with her getting back into go-go dancing. Julia recently revealed she&#39;s trying a hand at a brand-new career. She posted a photo of herself on stage and confessed that she&#39;s now going to try her hand at comedy (as shared by TV Season Spoilers).

          

Julia felt it was the right time for her to see if she could get up on stage and tell jokes while she was at an open mic night at a restaurant in Richmond, Virginia. She said there were about 30 to 50 people in the audience. The night went well for Julia as she watched people laughing at her jokes and enjoying her set.

 Why 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Julia Might Fail At New Job 
          

The response that she received that night gave Julia the confidence to try and participate in another open mic night. She could see herself becoming a well-loved comedian. However, Julia was also worried about something that could throw a wrench in her plans. She said that those who know her in real life know that she loves jokes. &#34;It&#39;s hard to offend me,&#34; she added. However, Julia is not sure if her jokes will offend someone else. It&#39;s the only thing stopping her from taking the next step. Julia has been writing her material but doesn&#39;t know if her content could come across as offensive to others.


 




Julia had been wondering if she could get some professional help with her jokes. She hopes someone can tell her if her jokes are “too much” or “not enough.” Julia wants an expert to tell her if she can be funny on stage without rubbing someone the wrong way. Julia appears to be taking her passion seriously and just might pursue it if she manages to do away with all the doubts she has in her mind about herself. Julia is not confident about her work, and it&#39;s not a good sign if she wants to be an entertainer and interact with a live audience.

Her personality on 90 Day Fiancé was endearing and her content with Brandon on Instagram does get fans laughing out loud. Julia was a model, a writer, a waitress, a promoter, an event planner, a babysitter, an office cleaner, a dancer, a saleswoman, and more before becoming a reality TV star. She currently also works as a dog trainer and seems to be loving what she does. It has been a long time since Julia and her husband were seen on 90 Day Fiancé. Julia might just put her wit and humor to good use and become a world-famous comedian if she manages to get things right.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
