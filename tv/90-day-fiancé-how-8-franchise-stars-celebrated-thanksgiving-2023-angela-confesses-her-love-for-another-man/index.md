## Literature Review
After showcasing several dramatic moments in 2023, many 90 Day Fiancé couples are celebrating Thanksgiving with their partners and families.




90 Day Fiancé cast members love celebrating the holidays, especially Thanksgiving, and spreading their holiday cheer on social media. Over the years, many couples have shared several holiday-related posts with their fans. In 2022, Yara Zaya and Jovi Dufren dressed as the Grinch family for Halloween. Their celebratory makeover sparked baby rumors, which didn’t turn out to be true. Yara and her husband also became the main characters of the classic movie Addams Family and dressed their sweet daughter, Mylah, for the family photoshoot.
During Christmas 2022, Big Ed Brown shared a controversial post on social media. He posted an illustration of himself standing naked with a holiday hat covering his private parts. Ed used the shock tactic to promote his Cameo and offered his followers a discount. One of the cutest holiday photos came from Armando Rubio and Kenneth Niedermeier last year. The couple shared a family portrait of themselves, their daughter, and their dog. They wore matching brown and white holiday outfits and took a Pinterest-worthy photo for the special occasion.
