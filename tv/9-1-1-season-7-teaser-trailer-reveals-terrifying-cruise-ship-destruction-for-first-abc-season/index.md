## Literature Review
The first teaser trailer for 9-1-1 season 7 unveils a haunting cruise ship disaster to be included in the show&#39;s first season on its new network, ABC.




The new trailer for 9-1-1 season 7 hints at a plot featuring a terrifying cruise ship accident. The first responder procedural&#39;s season 6 concluded back in May 2023, which included some huge plot lines left on major cliffhangers and emotional resolutions, including a daunting tsunami that left viewers on the edge of their seat. Now, 9-1-1 season 7 is slated to premiere on March 14, 2024.




ABC has released a teaser trailer for 9-1-1 season 7 as the show moves over to their network. 


 

The video, as seen above, features a brief clip of a cruise ship venturing out in the ocean that&#39;s suddenly rocked by a massive explosion in its hull. A passenger aboard can then be heard on the phone calling 9-1-1 for help as the ship capsizes, with half of it completely sinking under the water, including the unseen passenger&#39;s phone.


 How 9-1-1&#39;s New Network Will Impact The Show 
          

Not only will season 7 have to pick up some of 9-1-1 season 6&#39;s major plotlines, but it will do so during a time when the series is experiencing massive changes. Following the sixth season of the series, it was announced that 9-1-1 had been canceled on Fox, but would be moving to ABC. The show’s spinoff, Lone Star, will stay on Fox for season 5.

There are several reasons behind this shift, one of which being part of Fox’s ongoing attempts to cut costs following its acquisition by Disney. While this does mean a major paradigm shift for 9-1-1, as a new network could beget potentially big changes for the series, this could be good news for the show. Rather than being strained at Fox as the company would continue to pay licensing fees for both series, 9-1-1 might be able to get a more reliable budget on ABC, as the show is still popular and will likely have a successful run on its new network. 

As of now, very little has been revealed as to the plot details for season 7 overall. Just the brief teaser trailer would indicate, however, that 9-1-1&#39;s episodes will be full of massive disasters, much like previous seasons&#39; tsunamis, destructive earthquakes and plane crashes. Hopefully, ABC can maintain 9-1-1’s quality as it welcomes the show for the first time.


9-1-1 season 1 premieres on ABC on March 14, 2024, followed by Hulu the next day.
