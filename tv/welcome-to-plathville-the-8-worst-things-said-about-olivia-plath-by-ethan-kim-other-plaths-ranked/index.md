## Literature Review

Welcome to Plathville season 5 features some serious family dysfunction, and the Plaths, including Ethan, have said shocking things about Olivia.  




Welcome to Plathville star Olivia Plath is always at the center of the storm, and some of the Plaths, including her former husband Ethan Plath, have said terrible things about her. She can be very hard-headed, so Olivia may need to take responsibility for some of the feuds. However, she&#39;s never really been accepted by the family. Now, Kim and Barry Plath are more relaxed - they were very uptight in early seasons of the show, when they disapproved of Olivia because of their ultra-conservative beliefs.
On Welcome to Plathville season 5, the Plath family&#39;s problems have hit critical mass. Olivia feuded with everyone, and her issues with Moriah Plath, Ethan and his parents may have led to a divorce. Kim and Barry drifted apart, but they&#39;re trying to be friends. Olivia and Ethan may not be able to achieve that kind of amicable relationship. Their divorce has gotten messy, thanks to cheating rumors about Ethan and communication problems. Since there&#39;s been so much turmoil, it&#39;s not surprising that some of the quotes shown below fall into the &#34;blistering&#34; category.

 8  “If I was to get married, I would hate for my marriage to look like this.” 
Micah Plath Obviously Disapproves Of Olivia Plath


 







Everyone&#39;s turning on Olivia, including Ethan&#39;s brother Micah Plath, who&#39;s usually a fairly gentle person. When he talked about how bad Ethan and Olivia&#39;s marriage looked, as per the show, he was clearly taking a jab at Olivia. After their split, he became even more critical, implying that if anyone cheated in Ethan and Olivia&#39;s relationship, it was Olivia.
There&#39;s no proof that anyone cheated. Ethan was spotted with a brunette (her identity&#39;s still a mystery), but it&#39;s quite possible that Ethan and Olivia were already separated when an eagle-eyed fan caught him &#34;red-handed&#34; at a bar. As for Olivia, there has been chatter that she stepped out on Ethan, but nothing&#39;s been proved. Since Ethan was getting slammed for cheating, Micah probably felt defensive. He said things that might not be true. Even if they are, it is his place to talk about their marriage and what went wrong? Probably not.





 7  &#34;You were my best friend for a while, I love you, I wish you the best, but I don’t wanna be a part of it anymore.’ 
Moriah Plath Has Had It With Olivia Plath


 







Moriah and Olivia were as thick as thieves, and now they&#39;re not. Their relationship may have unraveled simply because they spent too much time together. Maybe they were just too close. When Moriah moved into Ethan and Olivia&#39;s Tampa, Florida home, it seemed idyllic at first. However, Moriah started to clash with her housemates, and when Ethan and Olivia were in Europe, Moriah moved out without telling them first. This signaled a rift that may never be repaired. Ethan and Moriah will probably be okay, but now that Ethan and Olivia have split up, it&#39;s highly unlikely that they&#39;ll make up.
The quote above shows just how bad Olivia and Moriah&#39;s relationship has gotten. The fact that Moriah would unload on Olivia this way while the cameras rolled speaks volumes. When Moriah said the words shown above, she&#39;d obviously given up on their friendship. Olivia must be very hurt by all of this.
Olivia&#39;s probably glad that she doesn&#39;t have to interact with the Plaths anymore. 






 6  &#34;We as a family have decided not to be divided anymore.&#34; 
The Plaths Released A Barely Cryptic Joint Statement


Lydia and other Plath family members seemed to throw shade at Olivia when they made a shocking joint statement. It&#39;s seen above, and the other Plaths who are active on Instagram, except Ethan, posted just the same. While their shared statement was somewhat cryptic, it&#39;s almost certain that it was directed at the &#34;villain&#34; Olivia. She&#39;s the one they don&#39;t get along with. She&#39;s the one who accused Kim of misusing Ethan&#39;s credit card. They really triggered the other Plaths. The statement followed her accusation, and it&#39;s safe to say that there was a connection between the two events.
Olivia should have thought twice before publicly accusing Kim of theft. Of course, the kids are going to defend their mother. While Kim isn&#39;t perfect, she&#39;s their mom. They love her despite her flaws. However, Olivia&#39;s clearly past caring how her missives are received. She&#39;s interested in telling her side of the story. Her truth may differ from Kim&#39;s. Everyone has their own perspective. Sometimes, the &#34;truth&#34; is a gray area. Kim&#39;s never going to admit to using Ethan&#39;s credit card and not repaying him, if she did it. She&#39;s way too stubborn for that kind of thing. So, the truth may always be murky.





 5  &#34;Kim Plath Thinks Olivia Plath&#39;s Filled With &#34;Evil Spirits.&#34; 
Kim Plath Basically Compares Olivia Plath To The Devil


 







Kim is a bit of a drama queen, always needing conflict. She appears to be bored by feud-free living. That may be why she thought it was appropriate to blast Olivia for being filled with &#34;evil spirits.&#34; Of course, Kim was way out of line. Olivia isn&#39;t as devoutly religious as Kim, but that doesn&#39;t mean that she&#39;s the devil. There are plenty of atheists out there who aren&#39;t the devil either. Conversely, there are Christians who don&#39;t live their faith. They just pretend. Kim may actually be one of those people.
Where does Kim get off telling the world that Olivia&#39;s possessed? She&#39;s making her sound like that girl from The Exorcist. Did she say that because Olivia drank boozy beverages now and then, or ate something sugary? Did Olivia watch too much TV or enjoy using the Internet? Olivia didn&#39;t actually corrupt Ethan. He wanted more from life than being sequestered in Cairo, Georgia could provide. That&#39;s why he chose a partner who was adventurous.
In the end, he chose someone too different. However, he clearly didn&#39;t want someone who was just like him. In her role as a mother-in-law, Kim failed with a vengeance. Instead of welcoming Olivia into a troubled family, she excommunicated the young woman, who&#39;d already been through the wringer with her own uber-religious family. On a human level, Kim was cruel and nasty. Now, she&#39;s surely gloating over the divorce. This side of Kim is rather ugly and indefensible.





 4  “I didn’t know what happened, I didn’t know if she had stolen it from me.” 
Moriah Plath Implies That Olivia Plath Stole Proceeds From Her Music


 







The Welcome to Plathville stolen music controversy was yet another example of family dysfunction. In the quote above, Moriah stops just short of calling Olivia a thief. She plants the seed that Olivia&#39;s some kind of scammer. Olivia may have actually done something improper, such as putting Olivia&#39;s music on her website and then failing to pass on the proceeds from downloads. However, making this all public was sketchy to say the least.
Barry Plath eventually got involved, threatening legal action against Olivia. That apparently led to some kind of settlement. Now, Moriah and Olivia are estranged. This scandal was another sign that Olivia and Moriah are so over. Few friendships could survive this sort of turmoil.





 3  &#34;Going along to get along: That&#39;s a recipe for a miserable life. I don&#39;t want that.&#34; 
Ethan Plath Was Tired Of Trying


 







Ethan&#39;s not the most rebellious person, but the formerly mild-mannered reality TV show star definitely reached his breaking point during the newest Welcome to Plathville season. He started speaking out in ways that he never had before. He became quite harsh about his marriage, whereas before, it seemed like he would do anything for his wife.
In the quote above, Ethan seemed so bitter. Inside his mind, his marriage was obviously in its death throes. They&#39;d been together for years, and at this moment, Ethan was realizing that there was no hope. He was mentally preparing for what the future would bring i.e divorce. Olivia isn&#39;t all bad, but she&#39;s such a bossy person. She pushed Ethan around, and his comment showed that he was tired of taking orders. He wanted a happier life.





 2  &#34;Relationally Destructive&#34; 
Barry Plath Doesn&#39;t Like Olivia Plath&#39;s Communication Style


 







Barry isn&#39;t exactly the poster boy for drama-free relationships, but he felt comfortable calling out Olivia&#39;s &#34;relationally destructive&#34; ways. Sure, she&#39;s got problems. Olivia wants her way, and she&#39;ll do just about anything to achieve her goals. Sometimes, she goes too far. She pushed people right to the edge. Those who are strong enough not to break under the strain are likely to be cut off. If people don&#39;t do what Olivia wants, she&#39;s so black and white.
Barry has had to toughen up. His wife left him, and that was perhaps a nasty shock. When Kim fled to have her mid-life crisis, the kids who remained needed parenting. Barry had to do the lion&#39;s share of that. All of this requires a lot of grit. Before, Barry deferred to to Kim, and then, he was on his own. He had to learn to take care of a family alone. That may be why he&#39;s now so open about his distaste for Olivia. She hasn&#39;t walked a mile in his shoes, and seems to judge him all the time. So, he judges her right back.
People change and trying to stop the evolution is pointless. Everyone needs to acknowledge and accept change. That evolution has led to a seismic shift in the Plath family dynamic. Barry is not as weak now. He&#39;s not Kim&#39;s puppet. Olivia is someone he doesn&#39;t like, and he&#39;s not going to pretend otherwise. He may have good reasons for feeling the way he does. However, her issues with him are also valid.





 1  With the way you have changed I don&#39;t see how I can do that.&#34; 
Ethan Plath Had Doubts About Having Kids With Olivia Plath


Ethan and Olivia planned a family together, but the forces acting against the couple, including their basic incompatibility, meant that they weren&#39;t destined to breed. Ethan was brutal when he said that Olivia had changed so much that he didn&#39;t want to have kids with her. In the TLC clip above, she looks very upset while he&#39;s talking, and seems angry too. She&#39;s clearly trying not to say too much, as she might say something that she&#39;ll regret. During this conversation, the couple are not at peace. They&#39;re coming to terms with a situation that is making both of them miserable. The only answer is honest communication and a clean break.
The Welcome to Plathville season 5 stars now have ample time to contemplate the timeline of their relationship, and each side needs to consider their own role in the split. While it&#39;s human nature to look for a villain, it&#39;s possible that neither of them deserve that label. A true villain is a, &#34;thief&#34; that &#34;comes only to steal and kill and destroy,&#34; as per the Bible. Ethan and Olivia are just normal people, with good and bad points, who couldn&#39;t work it out.
