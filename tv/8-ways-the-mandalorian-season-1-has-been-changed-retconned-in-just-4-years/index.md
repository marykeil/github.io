# 8 Ways The Mandalorian Season 1 Has Been Changed &amp; Retconned In Just 4 Years


## SUMMARY 


 The timing of the Great Purge of Mandalore has been clarified, placing it after the Galactic Civil War rather than during Din Djarin&#39;s childhood, as previously thought. 
 Din Djarin&#39;s injuries are more severe than they appear, with the novelization highlighting the extent of his wounds underneath his beskar armor. 
 Nevarro&#39;s location in the Star Wars galaxy has been changed in season 3, now officially placed on the Hydian Way instead of being far away from the hyperspace route.

## Literature Review
Four years and three seasons later, The Mandalorian season 1 has undergone several changes and retcons, most notably in these 8 different ways.



In the four years following its release, The Mandalorian season 1 has been changed and retconned in 8 different ways. The Star Wars TV show made history early on, as both the very first live-action series of the franchise and the flagship show of the Disney&#43; streaming platform. With such a big responsibility already cut out for the show, The Mandalorian has since given itself room to change and grow, taking ideas from season 1 and developing them later on.
The Mandalorian has now run for 3 seasons with a fourth on the way, giving the story plenty of time to breathe. This has caused some ideas from The Mandalorian season 1 to change over time, particularly as the lore of Mandalore has grown more and more. From the show itself to additional add-on materials, here are 8 ways The Mandalorian season 1 has been changed and retconned in just four years.

 8  The Great Purge Is No Longer Tied To Din Djarin&#39;s Childhood 
The Mandalorian Season 3 &amp; Ahsoka




The exact timeline of the Great Purge of Mandalore as introduced in the premiere of The Mandalorian season 1 has been unclear for years, but both The Mandalorian season 3 and Ahsoka have at last narrowed the window during which Mandalore&#39;s devastation could have happened at the hands of the Empire. Previously, materials such as Joe Schreiber&#39;s Star Wars: The Mandalorian Junior Novel predicted the Great Purge could have happened when Din was just a child, but this is no longer. The droid Huyang confirms in Ahsoka that this tragedy occurred after the Galactic Civil War, just a few years before the events of The Mandalorian season 1.

 7  Din Djarin Suffers More Wounds 
Star Wars: The Mandalorian Junior Novel
        

It&#39;s easy to see Din bounce back so quickly from hits taken to his beskar in The Mandalorian, but his wounds underneath are graver than what meets the eye. Schreiber&#39;s junior novelization of season 1 confirms Din truly gets more hurt than viewers think, from the bite of the Trandoshans&#39; vibro-axes in The Mandalorian season 1, episode 2 to the blasts from Fennec Shand&#39;s MK-modified sniper rifle in season 1, episode 5. Din is always seen just shaking it off in the show, which makes these extra details a great reminder of the human he is underneath all his armor.


 6  Nevarro&#39;s Location In The Galaxy Has Been Moved 
The Mandalorian Season 3
        

Ever since its debut in The Mandalorian, Nevarro has only been placed on an official Star Wars galaxy map once. This, however, is already an outdated placement, as The Mandalorian season 3 has completely changed where Nevarro is located in the galaxy. Nevarro is announced as an official trade spur on the Hydian Way, despite it originally being placed quite far away from the hyperspace route. Now, Nevarro has been left off of recent Star Wars maps, with this recent location change clearly taking time to process.

 5  Paz Vizsla&#39;s Name Has Been Changed &amp; Corrected 
The Mandalorian Season 1, Episode 3 &#34;Chapter 3: The Sin&#34;
        

Paz Vizsla is one of the only other members of Din&#39;s tribe who gets a name, but it&#39;s changed since his initial debut. In the ending credits of The Mandalorian season 1, episode 3 &#34;Chapter 3: The Sin,&#34; Paz&#39;s last name was spelled as &#34;Vizla,&#34; causing viewers to wonder whether he was truly a descent of the famous House Vizsla or not. This has since been changed in the credits to &#34;Vizsla&#34; following Paz&#39;s return in The Book of Boba Fett, confirming it was merely a typo beforehand.


 4  Sorgan Isn&#39;t As Good Of A Hiding Place For Cara Dune 
Star Wars: Dawn Of Rebellion
        

Going back to the Star Wars galaxy maps, the official placement for Sorgan has since made Cara Dune&#39;s - and Din Djarin&#39;s - remote hiding place less of an ideal spot. The New Republic rangers have an outpost on the planet Adelphi, and the galaxy map in Pablo Hidalgo&#39;s Star Wars: Dawn of Rebellion sourcebook sets Adelphi very close to Sorgan. This means Cara is truly hiding right under the New Republic&#39;s nose, despite being cautious of her past misdeeds.


 3  Din Djarin&#39;s Episode 4 Romance Has Been Elevated 
Star Wars: The Mandalorian Junior Novel; The Mandalorian #4



Din&#39;s time spent on Sorgan sees him becoming rather close with the widow Omera, whose daughter Winta quickly befriends Grogu. Din trusts Omera enough to both leave Grogu permanently in her care and to consider letting her remove his helmet, if even for just a moment, but this relationship between them has been elevated significantly since this episode aired. Both the junior novel and the comic adaptation have elevated Din&#39;s and Omera&#39;s romance even more, between detailing unspoken words to adding lingering looks and touches. They&#39;re all subtle, but certainly stand out from the show itself.


 2  The Night Of A Thousand Tears Is Even More Gruesome 
The Mandalorian Season 3
        

Moff Gideon is the first to name and describe the fateful Night of a Thousand Tears that precedes the full Mandalorian purge, but it has only worsened since that moment. Initially, Gideon discusses how the E-Web blaster cannons devastated the ranks of Mandalorian recruits, though viewers now know there were weapons much worse than E-Webs at play. The Empire dropped fusion bombs all over the surface of Mandalore, devastating it to the point of turning everything into glass - and making Mandalorians believe for years its atmosphere was no longer breathable.


 1  Din Djarin&#39;s Name Isn&#39;t Nearly As Mysterious 
The Book Of Boba Fett; The Mandalorian Season 3
        

Din Djarin&#39;s name isn&#39;t spoken at all until The Mandalorian season 1 finale, where Moff Gideon addresses Din directly. This is the clue that makes Din realize who their enemy truly is, and the reason he gives for this is &#34;the only record of [his] family name was in the registers of Mandalore.&#34; Despite this seeming like such a mysterious fun fact in the show, Din Djarin&#39;s name has since been used a total of twenty times in the show and its spin-offs thus far, with The Mandalorian season 3 making it the norm to differentiate Din from other Mandalorians in the series.
