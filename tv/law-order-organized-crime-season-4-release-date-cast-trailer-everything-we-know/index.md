## Literature Review
Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime season 4 is coming, but there may be a few changes to the formula of the formula-defying Dick Wolf spinoff show.




Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime finished its third season on a strong note, and NBC has confirmed that Stabler and company will be back for season 4. One of many Dick Wolf shows with a home on NBC, Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime started as a limited series, telling a serial story rather than the normal episode-of-the-week procedural format of other Law &amp; Order shows. This changed slightly with the second and third seasons, but Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime will return to its serialized roots for season 4.




While there haven&#39;t been many specifics revealed about the next season of Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime, there&#39;s been enough confirmed that viewers are eagerly anticipating the next installment. It&#39;s been confirmed that season 4 will see the return of Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler. The next season of Organized Crime will also most likely crossover once again with SVU to give viewers the Stabler-Olivia moments they&#39;ve missed so much for the years that he was out of the franchise. Here is what is known about the next season of Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime before it arrives in 2024.
