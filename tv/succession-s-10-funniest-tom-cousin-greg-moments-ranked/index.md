## Literature Review
Tom and Cousin Greg are iconic in Succession, as the two share some of the HBO show&#39;s most hilarious scenes. Here are their funniest moments.




Tom and Cousin Greg made up a fan-favorite duo in Succession, and some of their funniest moments are the comedic highlights of the show. The four-season HBO series chronicles the life of the ultra-wealthy Roy family, where patriarch Logan Roy is the aging CEO of a global news conglomerate. As potential suitors vie for power in preparation for his eventual passing, two characters who often find themselves at the bottom of the totem pole establish their own hilarious dynamic.
Tom Wambsgans married into the Roy family, and though he finds success relative to the average person, he&#39;s often treated as a joke in the scope of the show, which is ironic due to the Succession ending. The one person actively lower than Tom is Cousin Greg, who incidentally finds himself involved in the family business starting in season 1. Tom takes Greg under his wing as someone he can use as a lackey and feel powerful with, though it seems apparent he also truly desires to have a buddy in the family. Their shenanigans and banter made for some hilarious scenes.









 








 10  Greg &amp; Tom Meet 
Season 1, Episode 1
        

Episode 1 introduces audiences to the Succession cast, and a bit at the end shows the star-crossed duo meeting for the first time. Tom seems like he&#39;s being polite at first before saying, &#34;If you need any help, seriously, any help, any advice, just don&#39;t f***ing bother.&#34; Tom instantly spots someone he can mess with and enjoys the dynamic with Greg, kicking off the fan-favorite dynamic between the pair.





 9  Tom Catches Greg Stealing Cookies 
Season 1, Episode 4 Early in season 1, Tom catches Greg in the break room stealing cookies, which he&#39;s stashing in dog poop bags. Tom notices the bag and asks if he&#39;s carrying dog poop, to which Greg responds by explaining that he&#39;s out of money and needs the cookies for sustenance. Greg hilariously has to defend the usage of the poop bag, saying, &#34;It&#39;s not like they pre-poop them. They&#39;re just bags, really. It&#39;s just a mental barrier.&#34; 





 8  Greg Sues Greenpeace 
Season 3, Episode 4
        

In season 3, Greg discovers that his grandpa Ewan, tired of the family&#39;s obsession with wealth, has decided to donate his inheritance to Greenpeace. Cousin Greg is obviously not fond of the idea, hoping to get a share of the money for himself, and decides the only option is to sue Greenpeace. He fills Tom in on the situation, who encourages him, saying, &#34;I like your style, Greg. Who do you think you&#39;re gonna go after next, Save the Children?&#34; It&#39;s a quick moment between the two, but a great exchange of lines that demonstrates Greg&#39;s willingness to worm his way to money.





 7  Greg &amp; Tom Try Prison Food 
Season 3, Episode 6
        

When Greg and Tom think they&#39;re going to prison, the two go out for a meal meant to resemble what prison food tastes like. Only, according to Tom, it&#39;ll taste worse in prison. The two eat the disgusting food while grappling with the situation, with Greg noticeably growing scared. He suggests that his &#34;physical length&#34; may make him a target, revealing some of the terrible things that could happen to him behind bars. The moment becomes a heartwarming scene between them, as Tom offers to take responsibility for Greg&#39;s wrongdoings so they won&#39;t both have to suffer.





 6  Greg Blackmails Tom

His attempt to blackmail is ridiculously unthreatening, and Tom handles it like a proud father, excited to see Greg playing the game. Tom lovingly calling Greg &#34;a f***ing slimeball&#34; is one of the funniest moments in Succession.

 5  The Disgusting Brothers

When Succession resumes for season 4, Tom has been split from Shiv for several months. In the season 4 premiere, Tom grills Greg for the date he&#39;s brought to Logan&#39;s birthday party. Greg refers to her as &#34;another tick on the chart,&#34; reminding Tom that the two have been referring to themselves as &#34;the disgusting brothers,&#34; which Tom claims was &#34;heavily ironized.&#34; The idea of the duo hyping themselves up as a two-man playboy wolfpack in Shiv&#39;s absence is hilarious, and it&#39;s made even funnier by the fact that Tom is now embarrassed by it.

Tom&#39;s face is priceless as the camera zooms in on his moment of embarrassment, having just insulted Logan Roy&#39;s brother, albeit estranged. He solemnly replies, &#34;Well, I shouldn&#39;t be, Greg,&#34; holding his head down in shame.

Of course, Tom panics and says no before hilariously retracting the statement. Tom denying that he knows Greg is hysterical on its own, but Eavis follows it up by revealing that Tom sent Greg 67 emails in the same evening that contained the contents: &#34;You can&#39;t make a Tomlette without breaking some Greggs.&#34;
