## Literature Review
David Dangerfield’s Instagram post gets backlash from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days fans, who think he needs to make better financial decisions.




David Dangerfield from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days wants to make an expensive purchase, but many fans think he should save the money for his fiancée instead. The Nebraska man proposed to his Filipina girlfriend, Sheila Mangubat, on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Soon after, he flew to the United States to kickstart his fiancée’s K-1 visa process. Unfortunately, David and Sheila haven’t yet been able to reunite in the United States. They’ve seen numerous delays in the process and are anguished by their long-distance relationship awaiting a visa.




While many viewers have supported David from the start, his recent content has made some question his motivations and ethics. Lately, David has been posting about video games on his Instagram. He even shared a photo of a Sony PlayStation 5 or Microsoft Xbox Series X, asking his followers to help him decide between the two. Unfortunately, many people didn’t like his post and called him out.


 

A social media user wrote, “shouldn’t you be saving for your family that’s coming,” asking David why he was wasting his hard-earned money on leisure. Another user commented, “aren’t you a grown a** man...??” Someone even suggested a cheaper alternative, saying, “instead read a book to keep yourself occupied.”

 How Some 90 Day Fiancé Fans Defended David 
          

Not all fans were against David’s newfound interest in gaming and defended him in the comment section. One of his fans wrote, “this man cant buy himself a christmas present,” asking the critics to mind their own business as they’ve no idea about David’s intentions. Another fan praised the reality TV star and wrote, “this man works very hard for his family, so what are you doing?” Many people told the critics not to tell David what he could and couldn’t do with his money. David also responded to the criticism by stating that he’s “@work,” implying he doesn’t need to save because he’s making a financially conscious purchase.

David’s fans are right to defend him on social media, as he needs all the support he can get against negativity. While he often doesn’t get criticism because of his charming personality, there are times like these when some people are a bit too harsh on him. Previously, some haters called him out for posting AI content for fun. Fortunately, many fans supported David at that time, saving him from pointless backlash.




Social media critics are probably wrong to call out David for wanting to make a leisure-oriented purchase. They don’t know what he has gone through or why he wants to buy a gaming console. Like any hobby, gaming is a way for many people to escape the usual routine and have moments of joy amidst their harsh reality. David may want to pick up a new hobby as a stress buster. If not, the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days alum could also be looking to get a PlayStation or an Xbox for Shiela’s son, Jhonreil, who’s 12 years old.
