The story and cast of Coppola&#39;s Megalopolis are revealed along with other updates and explanations for the long timeline and high cost. 












 








 10  Megalopolis Is A New Film From Director Francis Ford Coppola 
        

One of the most exciting aspects of Megalopolis is that it is simply a new film by director Francis Ford Coppola, with new releases from the beloved filmmaker becoming incredibly rare. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s movie history has been an almost unparalleled history of hits, and there is no reason to think that Megalopolis won&#39;t live up to this high bar of quality that the director has set. The last film that Coppola directed was 2011&#39;s Twixt, and the fact that Megalopolis is the director&#39;s first film in over 13 years is incredibly exciting on its own.





 9  Megalopolis Is A Genre That Coppola Isn&#39;t Known For 


 







Another exciting part of Megalopolis is that the film falls into the sci-fi genre, with this not being a genre that Coppola is known for. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s most famous films have mostly fallen into dramas and crime stories, with him sporadically making horror films throughout his career. While he has had a hand in a few sci-fi projects, Megalopolis is by far the biggest sci-fi movie that Francis Ford Coppola has made, with the potential for a director to delve into an unfamiliar genre being immensely exciting.





 8  Megalopolis Has A Star-Studded Cast 
        

One of the most well-known aspects of Megalopolis is that it has a star-studded cast, with some of the most talented actors working today appearing in the film. Adam Driver will star in Megalopolis, with him being joined by immensely talented performers like Nathalie Emmanuel, Forest Whitaker, Laurence Fishburne, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Schwartzman, Giancarlo Esposito, Dustin Hoffman, and plenty of others. An ensemble cast of this scale is rarely seen anymore, with it being one of the main attractions of Coppola&#39;s Megalopolis.





 7  Megalopolis Has Been Four Decades In The Making 
        

One of the reasons that Megalopolis is surrounded by so much excitement is that the film has been four decades in the making, with the finished project being the culmination of decades of work by Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola first started working on the project back in the 1980s, with it being discussed while on the set of 1983&#39;s The Outsiders. However, funding and the appearance of other projects caused Coppola to consistently push off Megalopolis, with it taking four decades for the film to finally get made.





 6  Megalopolis Is A Big-Budget Sci-Fi Movie 
        

Megalopolis is a big-budget sci-fi movie, with the rarity of this making the film immensely exciting. While sci-fi is often an aspect of blockbusters from the MCU and Star Wars, an original sci-fi story with a huge budget is much rarer, with it being a treat for fans of the genre. The budget of Megalopolis is estimated to be over $120 million, meaning that the scale of the project is undoubtedly massive.





 5  Megalopolis Is An Original Story From Coppola 
        

Another exciting part of Megalopolis is that the story of the film is actually an original idea by Francis Ford Coppola, meaning that it will be an entirely new experience for audiences. The film follows a woman named Julia who has to decide between her father&#39;s traditional views on the world and her lover&#39;s more progressive views, with her lover wanting to shape New York into a utopia after a massive disaster shakes the city. While Coppola does direct original scripts, he has done adaptations in the past, so it&#39;s nice to see him directing his own writing.





 4  Megalopolis Will Explore If Utopias Are Possible 
        

One of the main themes of Megalopolis will seemingly be the exploration of whether utopias are possible, with this exciting idea being a great subject for a film to explore. While there is a lot of literature on the concept of utopias, very few films have attempted to delve into this idea due to the scale required. Luckily, Megalopolis&#39; big budget will allow the film to fully flesh out these themes, making the project a provocative piece of work.





 3  Megalopolis Will Be Full Of Social Commentary 
        

Due to Megalopolis&#39; main story being about differing views on how society should be structured, it will undoubtedly feature lots of social commentary, meaning that there will be a lot of discussion to be had once Megalopolis releases. Political satire in sci-fi movies has been a staple of the genre forever now, with it being one of the main draws of sci-fi. Now that Francis Ford Coppola is tackling the genre, an entirely new perspective will be given to these ideas in Megalopolis, with it undoubtedly raising some interesting questions.

 A $120 Million Movie That&#39;s Been In The Works For 40 Years Is 2024&#39;s Riskiest Sci-Fi 
It took 40 years for Francis Ford Coppola to finally get his 2024 sci-fi on screens, and its $120 million budget makes it a massive personal risk. 








 2  Megalopolis Is A Huge Financial Risk 
        

One of the biggest reasons that Megalopolis struggled to get made was that it was a huge financial risk, with studios not wanting to back it. Risky movies are always exciting, as it allows audiences to know that they&#39;re not going to get a film that is playing things safe. While Megalopolis&#39; financial risk may cause the movie&#39;s box office to struggle, viewers who do choose to see it will undoubtedly get an exciting film that they can&#39;t see anywhere else.





 1  Francis Ford Coppola Is Independently Financing Megalopolis 
        

Coppola has decided to independently finance Megalopolis, with this too being an immensely exciting part of the film. Francis Ford Coppola is spending $120 million of his own money on Megalopolis, signaling that the movie is truly a passion project. This also means that there won&#39;t be any studio interference in the making of the film, with it being purely the vision of Coppola. Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s Megalopolis has a lot of risk involved, but the final product will be the version of the film that he wanted to make.
