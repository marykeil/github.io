## Literature Review
Theresa Nist is a successful investor who should protect her net worth from The Golden Bachelor lead Gerry Turner, who has lied multiple times. 




The inaugural season of The Golden Bachelor ended with Gerry Turner getting down on one knee and proposing to Theresa Nist, but she should make him sign a prenup. Gerry, the widower and retired restaurateur, hit it off with multiple women during the season, eliminating all but Theresa and Leslie Fhima. Though Gerry told both of the final women that he loved them, he ultimately gave his final rose to Theresa and sent Leslie home heartbroken and in tears.




Gerry and Theresa wasted no time planning their big wedding. Gerry cited the hastiness of the wedding being because of the pair&#39;s ages of 72 and 70. Gerry and Theresa&#39;s dream wedding will be the first Bachelor Nation wedding in ten years and will air on national television on January 4, 2024. Theresa has said she would invite the entire The Golden Bachelor cast to the rand event.

 Theresa Has A Lot To Lose 
          

Theresa may be marrying a retiree, but the career-driven woman still works as a financial services professional. She is passionate about trading stocks and has an estimated net worth of between $500,000 and $1 million. Theresa works for TFS Financial Services as a senior complication and operations liaison, according to the wealth management company’s website. Theresa wasn&#39;t always a trader, however. She taught herself to invest in the stock market and used this knowledge to make money in the market before landing her high-paying job at TFS.






 Gerry Has Told Several Lies 
          

Gerry had misled contestants into believing that he&#39;d been single since the 2017 death of his wife. However, shortly after proposing to Theresa, the 72-year-old Gerry confessed he’d dated several women following during that time. The dad of two also had his professional status as a “retired restaurateur” questioned, as his most recent jobs were in maintenance work. Considering multiple examples of Gerry&#39;s dishonesty, Theresa would be wise to protect her financial assets.
