## Literature Review
Big Brother&#39;s Danielle&#39;s Reyes is widely regarded as &#34;The Greatest Houseguest to Never Win.&#34; Here&#39;s what to know about this BB legend.




Big Brother 3 runner-up Danielle Reyes was just eliminated from Big Brother Reindeer Games, and there&#39;s a lot to know about this legend, who&#39;s widely regarded as &#34;The Greatest Player to Never Win.&#34; During Big Brother 3 in 2002, Danielle only won two competitions (one Head of Household (HOH) and one Power of Veto), but it was her extraordinary social game and strategies that made her a Big Brother icon. She and Jason Guy had a secret alliance, which allowed them to control the game. Danielle made it to the Final 2 with Lisa Donahue, but she only received one vote to win, from Jason, because of the bitter jury.




This happened because, during Big Brother 3, the jury wasn&#39;t sequestered, and was able to watch everything that Danielle said about them in the Diary Room. From then on, the Big Brother jury was sequestered in the Jury House to prevent this problem. In 2006, Danielle came back for Big Brother 7, the first all-stars season, placing 6th after winning one HOH and one Power of Veto competition. In 2023, Danielle finally returned for Big Brother Reindeer Games. Although she had a strong start, she ended up placing 7th when she was eliminated during the Santa Showdown.
