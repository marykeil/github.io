Summary

  La Brea&#39;s final season will see the journey of the 10,000 B.C. survivors come to a close, with the entire cast of characters integral to the plot and forming an unbreakable bond.   The actors discuss their experience filming the final season, expressing sadness at its end but also excitement and love for the show&#39;s limited time.

The final season of La Brea premieres Tuesday, January 9 on NBC and will see the 10,000 B.C. survivors&#39; journey come to a close. While the series centers around the Harris family, the entire cast of characters has become integral to the plot and one another. Thrown together under impossible circumstances, they have formed an unbreakable bond, and with Veronica and Lucas expecting their first child, the found family may be expanding.

 Lily Santiago, Josh McKenzie &amp; Rohan Mirchandaney Talk La Brea 
         




Screen Rant: With season 3 being the last, how has this experience been for you overall and how is it to bring your characters&#39; journeys to a close?


Lily Santiago: It was very sad to film knowing that we were ending. I think it made it that much more fun. We all came in every day with an endless amount of love and excitement for the show because we knew we had a limited time to share it with each other. The arc of my character has fascinated me and been really great to play because she has shifted. Everyone&#39;s changed so much, obviously.
We&#39;re always put in new circumstances, and we&#39;re starting new relationships and ending old ones. I think the amount Veronica changed was shocking to me. I&#39;m so happy to see her starting to find joy and starting to figure out who she wants to be and taking on more leadership herself, even though other people are doing it in different ways, and having this responsibility. She&#39;s a young woman full of love and hope for the first time, so that&#39;s really fun to do.
Josh McKenzie: This has definitely been the most fun season. Overall, it&#39;s been an incredible journey for these characters and for us, as actors, being able to play with all the many crazy things that the writers have thrown at us. I think, this season, things were elevated a bit. Things are coming to a close and there&#39;s a bit of sweetness about that, but you can just tell that everyone&#39;s having a really good time and I hope that shows through the end product. Everyone had a better sense of who they were.
We are all friends now. We&#39;ve been working together closely through intense conditions for three years and that really bonds you. Coming into this final season, the energy on set was a little bit different and a little bit better. Every season got a little bit stronger and a little bit better. Because they&#39;re wrapping it up, they just got to do whatever they wanted. Dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff are thrown at us, and it&#39;s all sandwiched into six episodes. It&#39;s just so fast and there are so many twists and turns.
Rohan Mirchandaney: With season 1 and 2, there were a lot of unknowns and a lot of trying to figure things out. By season 3, when we knew that it was the end, there was a sense of closure and a sense of clarity that we were all working together towards a final goal. Shooting up north in Queensland was a real big shift for everybody. The location, the environment, the crew, the people, and just how we felt when we were up there really injected a whole new energy into the show and that comes across. It really added a lot. This is my favorite season by far, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one who feels that way.





          

Josh and Lily, we have to talk about Veronica&#39;s pregnancy. Lucas and Veronica seem to be in a good place about it at the end of season 2, but how is preparing to raise a baby in 10,000 B.C. going to affect them both as individuals and as a couple?


Lily Santiago: We&#39;ve been talking about fear a lot today and that they both sort of exist excited but terrified. The characters address that. They&#39;re both excited but terrified. They have a lot more responsibility. They have a lot more to lose. They have to unite in a different way than they&#39;ve ever had to before and the trust that they have for each other and that everything will be okay and that they can make things okay if they are together and believe in themselves.
They just have to trust a lot and that&#39;s really scary. I like seeing them grow. At the end of season 2, they&#39;ve just started this relationship, and they&#39;re still awkward together, and they&#39;re still figuring out who they are to each other. Season 3, you&#39;ve got mom and pop leading the people in the Clearing and ready to raise a human together even despite their creepy pasts. It&#39;s hopeful to me.
Josh McKenzie: Yeah, hopeful. At the end of the second season, Lucas is conflicted between being able to be the person that he&#39;s slowly starting to forge for himself in 10,000 B.C., versus the person he was back in present-day L.A. where he was a heroin dealer. He wasn&#39;t the greatest role model, and he doesn&#39;t have great role models. On an individual level, it&#39;s hope, but also fear. Hope that he can be a better person, that he wants to be a better person, and that he can take this version of himself anywhere he goes, and can take this version he is forging for himself down in 10,000 B.C. anywhere and be that person.
As Lily rightly said, trust is a huge part of that. He needs to trust that he can be that person. He needs to trust that Veronica is going to support him, and that if he does have moments of vulnerability or moments where that darkness that follows both of those characters around makes its way back, that Veronica is going to support him through that and that they can raise this child together, and it&#39;s not going to be screwed up like either of them. [Laughs]





Rohan, Scott is definitely not the same person he was when we met him in the pilot, so in what ways do you feel he has evolved throughout the series?


Rohan Mirchandaney: Scott&#39;s gone through a lot this season and throughout the whole show. He&#39;s experienced near-death a couple of times. He&#39;s faced some of his fears—crossing the river in season 1 and killing Taamet. In season 2, there are some really life-changing moments for Scott. Meeting Paara, and developing a kinship with her, and having a bromance with Lucas, and having a lot of new experiences and new relationships as well. It&#39;s really impacted his maturity and his sense of responsibility.
All of that really comes to fruition by the end of this season. We learn a lot more about Scott&#39;s past, and some other elements that he hasn&#39;t been talking about yet, and how he chooses to deal with them, with the new skills that he&#39;s learned and the new confidence that he&#39;s grown to have this season. It&#39;s been a real growth experience for myself, but for Scott, looking back at earlier episodes and seeing how far he&#39;s come, it&#39;s a real shift.
