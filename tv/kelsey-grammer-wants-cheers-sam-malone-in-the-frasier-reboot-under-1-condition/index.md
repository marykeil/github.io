## Literature Review

Kelsey Grammer admits he wants Ted Danson to reprise his iconic Cheers role as Sam Malone in the Frasier reboot, but he has one condition.




Ted Danson&#39;s Sam Malone could return in the Frasier reboot, but Kelsey Grammer has one condition. Paramount&#43; has finally ordered season 2 of the Frasier revival. Plot details are scant since the Frasier reboot season 1 finale can double as a series capper, but Grammer&#39;s character living in Boston keeps the door open for a possible Cheers crossover. However, there are unclear details about the status of the Cheers bar in the Frasier reboot. Although the show is unlikely to visit the underground pub, at least in the foreseeable future, there are hopes that a cameo with some of Frasier&#39;s old friends from the establishment would suffice.




While speaking to Deadline, Grammer shared that he is open to Frasier crossing paths again with Sam. Whether this happens in Frasier season 2 or at any time in the future, he stressed that the reunion needed to happen under one condition. Read his full quote below:


“If Sam Malone is still alive and has a vital connection of making Frasier move to another place.”



 Should Frasier Leave Boston In The Reboot? 
He Just Got Back...
          

Frasier and Sam have one of the most interesting dynamics in the Cheers/Frasier universe. Starting as romantic rivals with Diane at the center, the pair eventually developed a bond after she left Boston for Los Angeles. The characters cannot be any more different, however, with Sam being more like Martin Crane, as highlighted during the Cheers character&#39;s guest appearance in Frasier. Still, after a couple of decades, it will be interesting how their dynamic has changed and if Sam can influence Frasier&#39;s decision on where to live.




It&#39;s an odd task that Grammer bestows on Ted Danson&#39;s usually carefree character. It&#39;s also unusual that he&#39;s floating the idea that Frasier might leave Boston after just moving back to the city to reconnect with his son. However, considering his increased wealth after being a successful TV host in Chicago, he can live anywhere. It would also resolve issues about whether the Frasier revival should feature the Cheers bar or disregard the pub entirely and focus on the present.

                  Frasier&#39;s Cheers Bar Confusion Highlights The Big Problem With Kelsey Grammer&#39;s Reboot   The Frasier reboot&#39;s inability to decide what actually happened to Sam&#39;s Boston bar, Cheers, highlights the issue with the Paramount&#43; revival.    

 Recently, the cast of Cheers had a reunion at the 75th Emmys, which both featured Grammer and Danson. It&#39;s uncertain if they discussed the possibility of their characters crossing paths in the Frasier revival. If Danson agrees to make a cameo, it&#39;s only a matter of coming up with the right storyline for his appearance.






Sam and Frasier were last on screen together in Frasier season 2 episode 16, &#34;The One Where Sam Shows Up,&#34; released in 1995.






 Which Other Cheers Characters Could Show Up In The Frasier Reboot? 
Could That Cast Help Make Up For Niles &amp; Daphne&#39;s Absence?
         

 Grammer has been candid about trying and failing to bring back the rest of the legacy cast of Frasier, with both David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves having opted out of returning as Niles and Daphne. The reboot was able to bring back Peri Gilpin as Roz and Bebe Neuwirth as Lilith, but only as one-time guests. Prior to the revival&#39;s release, he never discussed actively seeking out his former Cheers castmates to make a cameo, and perhaps it was because the status of the Cheers bar in the Frasier reboot remains unclear. 




Joining Grammer and Danson in the 2024 Emmys reunion were Rhea Pearlman, George Wendt, and John Ratzenberger. Assuming that Grammer brought up the idea, it isn&#39;t impossible that Frasier season 2 can stage another group comeback for Carla, Norm, and Cliff — the same way that the original series did. Beyond them, Grammer has also been vocal about wanting Shelley Long&#39;s Diane to return. Apparently, Frasier still has unresolved issues with his first Cheers girlfriend after the way they split almost 40 years ago.
