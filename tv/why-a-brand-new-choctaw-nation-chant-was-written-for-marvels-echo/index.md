# Why A Brand New Choctaw Nation Chant Was Written For Marvels Echo


## SUMMARY 



  Echo&#39;s biggest strength lies in its exploration of Maya Lopez&#39;s relationship with her Choctaw Nation roots. Marvel and composer Dave Porter worked with the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma to create a new chant that represents Maya&#39;s story while honoring Choctaw culture.   The decision to create a new chant tailored to Maya&#39;s experience reinforces the overall design of the show and its multi-generational themes. It adds authenticity and speaks to a forward-thinking view of culture that adapts and stays relevant.   Dave Porter incorporated the new chant into the main &#34;Echo&#34; theme, the season finale episode, and the Echo soundtrack. It would be fascinating to see how Choctaw culture could further be incorporated into the music of a potential Echo season 2.

## Literature Review
Echo composer Dave Porter discusses his collaboration with members of the Choctaw Nation to create a brand-new chant for Maya Lopez and her history.




Marvel’s Echo rounds out a character who threatened to steal the show when she was first introduced in 2021’s Hawkeye. Alaqua Cox returns as Maya Lopez/Echo in the series, which also brings back Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin and Charlie Cox’s Daredevil. The 5-episode series explores Maya’s conflicted relationship with her past, even as it reckons with the consequences of her actions at the end of Hawkeye (namely, shooting Kingpin).




As exciting as it is to see Daredevil and Kingpin back in the fold, Echo’s biggest strength may be in how it explores Maya Lopez’s relationship with her Choctaw Nation roots. Echo’s MCU powers are drawn from her connection with her ancestors, and Marvel took care to involve the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma in the creation of the series. So did composer Dave Porter, who ended up helping with the creation of a brand new Choctaw chant for the show. The reason why is an interesting one, as revealed by Porter during a recent interview with Screen Rant: 


Dave Porter: One of the things that I wanted to [incorporate], and was really struck by, was a traditional style of chant that the Choctaw have in their history. I had this wonderful ability to meet a group of folks there from the Choctaw Nation who perform these chants. They date back hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, from the point where they were forced to relocate to Oklahoma from the Southeast, which is where the Choctaw Nation originally is from, historically.
Just to get a flavor of that, they very kindly allowed me to record some of those traditional chants, and I had that in my mind. Then, sort of off the cusp while we were in the studio, I had this sense that this stuff is so beautiful and so powerful, but so sacred to them and so historical, that we shouldn&#39;t use it. But I wanted to use it.
So, together, we came up with this idea to create a new chant based on those historical ones but that, in a soft sell way, told our story of Maya. It&#39;s essentially a chant that is about the power of women and how they&#39;ve carried the seeds of life and pride and power and prosperity through their forced march from their historical lands to Oklahoma and kept the nation alive.






 Why Writing A New Chant Was A Good Decision For The Show (And Beyond) 
         

While Echo’s Marvel Cinematic Universe Easter eggs and references point to Marvel’s broader universe, Echo is designed primarily as an exploration of the character of Maya Lopez. The choice to create a new chant tailored to her experience reinforces the overall design of the show, even if subtly, while still creating the authenticity that Marvel, Porter, and their Choctaw Nation collaborators clearly strove for. Given Porter’s description of the chant’s meaning, it’s hard to imagine anything else so clearly fitting Echo’s multi-generational themes.

Porter was also quick to add that the creation of a new chant for Echo can speak to a forward-thinking view of culture that doesn’t just present aspects of Choctaw lifestyle but can also potentially give something back. It’s up to the Choctaw Nation to determine the success of Echo’s representation, but Porter’s intention was to create something that can live beyond Echo. Here are the composer’s words about the process:





Dave Porter: One of the people I got to work with—a wonderful guy named Seth Fairchild at the Choctaw Nation—told me that there&#39;s an importance to culturally historical stuff, but that culture also has to live, breathe, adapt, and stay relevant. That really struck me. It seemed like a more effective way, and a more direct way, that I could incorporate the power of that historical chanting idea, but have it tailored for us and keep it fresh and new. It&#39;s something new for them too. It&#39;s something new that they can now use if they want to, wherever they want, which is pretty cool.


Something that may not have necessitated the creation of a new chant but is an exciting evolution of the creative process is the way Dave Porter utilized the piece multiple times across Echo’s five-episode run. The chant was incorporated into the main “Echo” theme, but was also played during the season finale episode, and will appear in a straightforward way on the Echo soundtrack. While nothing has been confirmed, it would be fascinating to hear how the Porter and his collaborators would further work to incorporate Choctaw culture into the music of an Echo season 2.
