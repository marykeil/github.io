A new, mysterious teaser for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live hints at the new characters joining Rick Grimes at the CRM. The upcoming spinoff will focus on Rick&#39;s time captured at the CRM, alongside Michonne&#39;s mission to bring him home. In addition to returning characters from the flagship series, the show will introduce multiple new characters to the universe as well.




Now, The Walking Dead has released a teaser ahead of The Ones Who Live&#39;s release, highlighting a row of people&#39;s shoes.


 

The shoes are from unfamiliar characters except the last pair, which seemingly belong to Rick. This indicates he might be teaming up with some new faces as he tries to go back home.


 Who Will Be Introduced In The Ones Who Live? 
          

The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live sees Andrew Lincoln return as Rick Grimes and Danai Gurira come back as Michonne. The pair will be joined by Pollyanna McIntosh’s Jadis, last seen in The Walking Dead season 9 and World Beyond season 2. Their familiar presences will anchor the series, introducing a new world through the tyranny of the CRM.




In addition to returnees from the flagship series, the show will be introducing multiple new characters associated with the CRM. This includes residents Pearl Thorne (Lesley-Ann Brandt) and Nat (Matthew August Jeffers), two characters whose roles are currently unclear. The show will also reveal more about Major General Beale (Terry O&#39;Quinn), who was previously mentioned in World Beyond.

                  1 The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live Detail Proves It Can Accomplish What Dead City Couldn’t   Despite scarce updates, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has revealed a new detail that proves it can achieve what the Dead City spinoff couldn&#39;t.    

With a cast of characters old and new making up the spinoff, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live is shaping up to be a memorable entry in the franchise. This is especially true because it&#39;s unclear where some allegiances lie, meaning Rick and Michonne might have some unexpected help in getting back home. With plenty to explore surrounding the CRM and the show&#39;s newcomers, it may prove to be one of the most engaging spinoffs so far.






The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live premieres on AMC and AMC&#43; February 25, 2024.
