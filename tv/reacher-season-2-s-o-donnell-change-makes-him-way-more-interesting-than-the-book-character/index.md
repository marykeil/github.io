Summary

  Reacher season 2 has made a significant change to O&#39;Donnell, making him a family man instead of a bachelor, which adds more depth to the character.   The addition of a family for O&#39;Donnell gives him something to lose and adds a new layer of tension to the investigation.   O&#39;Donnell&#39;s transformation shows Reacher that change is possible and raises questions about whether the title character himself could ever settle down and lead a &#34;normal&#34; life.  







Reacher season 2 has made a key change to the character of O&#39;Donnell compared to Lee Child&#39;s novel - and made him more compelling as a result. Reacher season 2 covers Bad Luck and Trouble, which was the eleventh book in the series. The story involves Reacher reuniting with the 110th Special Investigators from his army days, who are the people who know him the best. The idea for the book came to Child as he reminisced about his former career, and what became of the people he used to work with.

That is what makes Bad Luck and Trouble one of Child&#39;s more emotionally involving novels since readers see a slightly warmer side to the main character. Reacher season 2 cast Serinda Swan as Dixon - who becomes the title character&#39;s latest love interest - and Shane Sipos as O&#39;Donnell; fan favorite Neagley (Maria Sten) also returns from the first series. Reacher&#39;s Special Investigator pals are all faithful to their characterizations from the source material, with a few tweaks along the way.





 

                  Reacher Season 2: 9 Biggest Changes To Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck &amp; Trouble   Amazon Prime Video&#39;s Reacher season 2 is largely faithful to the source material, but takes some liberties with Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck and Trouble.    


 Reacher Season 2 Gives O&#39;Donnell A Family 
He&#39;s no longer the ultimate ladies&#39; man
          

O&#39;Donnell was basically the class clown of the 110th, who became a private investigator after leaving the army. O&#39;Donnell famously wields a ceramic switchblade and ceramic knuckleduster as weapons, which are not only helpful in any fight but can get past metal detectors too. He was also noted as a total bachelor in Bad Luck and Trouble, and like his old friends, had no family of his own to look after. Reacher season 2 changes that, revealing O&#39;Donnell married a woman named Lilly, and they have three children.




Instead of being a private investigator, this version of O&#39;Donnell is a lawyer. Other than that, Sipos&#39; O&#39;Donnell is a very faithful translation of the one from Child&#39;s source text, but the addition of a family actually makes him more interesting. O&#39;Donnell&#39;s got the same glib attitude and irreverent sense of humor, but underneath that, he&#39;s also a happily married man and proud father. His old teammates are shocked by this change too, considering his wild side when he was part of the unit.



 O&#39;Donnell Follows Roscoe And Finlay In Being Improved By Amazon&#39;s Show 
Amazon&#39;s adaptation has added more texture to the book&#39;s characters
         

O&#39;Donnell being a family man in Reacher season 2 makes him more three-dimensional than his book counterpart. His mind might be on the investigation, but in the background, he&#39;s thinking of his family too. This also means he has something to lose since the villain would no doubt be happy to threaten his family to get him to back off. This continues a nice trend for Amazon&#39;s Reacher of adding more dimensions to the characters from Child&#39;s books.




Both Roscoe and Finlay play major roles in Killing Floor, the book adapted for Reacher season 1. Their characterizations and roles in the story are broadly similar, but the TV version brought more humanity and nuance, largely thanks to the work of Willa Fitzgerald and Malcolm Goodwin as Rosoce and Finlay respectively. Fitzgerald brought an intelligence and toughness to Roscoe that improved on the character&#39;s novel counterpoint - which is something Child himself has admitted to.

                  Reacher Season 2&#39;s Little Wing Weapon Explained   The fourth episode of Reacher season 2 has just clarified the threat, as Reacher and the team discover what the &#34;Little Wing&#34; weapon actually is.    

Finlay is a more tragic character than the one found in Killing Floor, but Goodwin gave him a nice, dry sense of humor too. It&#39;s little wonder viewers were so disappointed to learn neither character was returning for the second season since they were part of why season 1 clicked the way it did. O&#39;Donnell is getting the same treatment, and he&#39;s a richer character for it.






 O&#39;Donnell&#39;s Story Proves To Reacher That A Normal Life Is Possible 
Would Reacher ever just settle down?
          

Reacher is the ultimate loner, and once he retired from the military, decided he would see the country on his terms. Reacher has no home, his only possession is a folding toothbrush, and his romantic relationships are brief. He claims he was born a wanderer, but season 2 shows there are a few cracks in his usual thought process. He becomes visibly uncomfortable when his old friends are discussing their lives since leaving the army, as they all went on to successful careers and somewhat healthy, &#34;normal&#34; lives.

O&#39;Donnell settling down and having a family also shows Reacher that anybody can change. In the past, Child has spoken of two possible endings for Jack Reacher as a character; one where he heroically sacrifices himself to save the day, or another where he decides to finally settle down in some small town, get a home and raise a bunch of dogs. Season 2 sees Reacher in a more reflective mood and maybe thinking it&#39;s time to make a change, but it&#39;s doubtful the next season will see him worrying about his mortgage or mowing his just yet.
