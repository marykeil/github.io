## Literature Review
Julio Moya rose to stardom during his time on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. Here&#39;s everything fans need to know about his life outside the show.




Julio Moya rose to fame on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, and there&#39;s curiosity surrounding his age, job, Instagram, and more. The American man planned to move to The Netherlands to be with his girlfriend, Kirsten Schoemaker. However, his journey didn&#39;t go according to plan, as Kirsten and Julio split halfway through the season. Luckily, the two reappeared on the reunion and cleared the air regarding their ill-fated romance, including addressing Kirsten&#39;s cheating scandal on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way.




Julio was framed as a villain in The Other Way season 5, but it seems prudent to revisit his unfair villain edit in the wake of a potential cheating scandal. His time on The Other Way was short, as he got cold feet before moving to The Netherlands and called off the romance with Kirsten over an awkward phone call, citing a desire to remain close with his mother. What else is there to know about Julio?


 Julio Moya&#39;s Age 
          

             90 Day Fiance: The Other Way   Release Date   June 3, 2019    Genres   Reality    Network   TLC    Franchise(s)   90 Day Fiancé       

Julio was born in 1996, making him 27 years old. He and his ex, Kirsten, are pretty close in age; her birthday is June 15, 1999. She is 24 years old. Their closeness in age is in stark contrast to many 90 Day Fiancé franchise couples, as one person is often markedly older than the other. An iconic example of this age displacement is Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi. Unfortunately, their closeness in age didn&#39;t save their relationship.






 Julio Moya&#39;s Job 
          

Julio is a school safety officer by day and a DJ and producer by night. While Kirsten worked in human resources in The Netherlands, Julio had a more flexible career. The musician goes by DJ Wikii and started creating mixes as a teenager. His jobs don&#39;t tie him down, so he may have been eager to join Kirsten in a new country, unfazed by upending his life in the United States.



 Julio Moya&#39;s Instagram 

 

Julio&#39;s Instagram can be found at @julio90day. The aspiring DJ showcases his love of travel on the page, asserting in his bio that he&#39;s been to &#34;30 countries and counting.&#34; He&#39;s become good friends with fellow franchise star Daniele Gates and has posted photos with the yogi. Most recently, the world traveler visited Portugal, Spain, Costa Rica, and Mexico. While he didn&#39;t want to upend his entire life for Kirsten, he liked to explore new places. Julio&#39;s Instagram hinted at a breakup with Kirsten before publicizing it on The Other Way. 






 Julio Moya&#39;s Height 

 

Julio is over 6 feet tall, making him a fairly tall man. His height can be seen when standing next to tiny Daniele, who is only 4&#39;11&#34;. However, Yohan towers over Daniele even more, and watching them kiss when they were together was comical.



 Julio Moya&#39;s Hometown 
          

Julio was born in the Dominican Republic, but he and his mother, Ana Elizabeth Lopez, relocated to Long Island, New York, after his parents divorced. The DJ has strong ties to New York and ultimately decided to stay closer to his mother rather than move to The Netherlands to be with Kirsten. While his time on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way was short, Julio may not be the villain he was made out to be.
