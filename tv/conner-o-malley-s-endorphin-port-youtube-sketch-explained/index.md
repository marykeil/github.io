## Literature Review
Conner O&#39;Malley&#39;s &#34;Endorphin Port&#34; has become more than just a YouTube sketch and has taken on a whole bizarre and virtual life of its own.




Conner O&#39;Malley is a name that resounds with a unique blend of absurdity and satire in the world of comedy, and &#34;Endorphin Port&#34; remains a significant moment in his career. Known primarily for his work as a writer on Late Night with Seth Meyers, O&#39;Malley&#39;s journey into comedy is as unconventional as his humor. He started his career not on the stand-up circuit but rather as a Vine creator. Vine was a social media app that let users post videos no longer than six seconds, and O&#39;Malley used this to showcase his raw, offbeat comedic style, quickly gaining a cult following.




O&#39;Malley&#39;s humor is characterized by its intense energy and often surreal, exaggerated portrayal of characters, frequently focusing on the absurdity of modern life and politics. His move from Vine to YouTube allowed O&#39;Malley to explore longer-form content, where his distinctive voice found new depths. O&#39;Malley, who plays Max in the Bodies, Bodies, Bodies cast, often blends the lines between reality and parody, creating incredibly thought-provoking sketches. O&#39;Malley&#39;s ability to turn everyday scenarios into surreal and bizarre experiences has made him a standout figure in contemporary comedy. His work is a commentary on society, media, and the human condition, and that&#39;s exemplified by the Endorphin Port.

 Conner O&#39;Malley&#39;s &#34;Endorphin Port&#34; Is About A Digital Society 
          




&#34;Endorphin Port,&#34; one of Conner O&#39;Malley&#39;s most talked-about YouTube sketches, takes a satirical look at our increasingly digital society. The sketch, which sees the Palm Springs actor create a hub where human interaction is mediated through absurd technological means, exemplifies the comedian&#39;s flair for highlighting the ridiculous aspects of modern life. The video portrays a society obsessed with digital stimulation, where people enter a Matrix-like state with users living vicariously through an avatar for emotional satisfaction, offering a sharp critique of our dependence on technology for happiness and connection.

The humor in &#34;Endorphin Port&#34; stems from its hyperbolic portrayal of a world not too dissimilar from the real one, where O&#39;Malley plays a member of the public who&#39;s become dissatisfied with the modern age and creates the Endorphin Port. O&#39;Malley&#39;s exaggerated character serves as a funhouse mirror, reflecting our own world&#39;s absurdities in a humorous light. The sketch resonates because it captures a fundamental truth about the human condition in the digital age, making viewers laugh while also prompting them to question their relationship with technology.





 



 What&#39;s On The Endorphin Port Website 
          

The &#34;Endorphin Port&#34; experience extends beyond the YouTube sketch, with O&#39;Malley creating an accompanying website, Endorphinport.com, that further immerses viewers in the sketch&#39;s bizarre world. The website, much like the sketch, is a testament to O&#39;Malley&#39;s creative genius, offering a surreal and interactive exploration of the sketch&#39;s themes. The website is many things, including a place where O&#39;Malley can sell his content directly to fans, but it most notably features Jeremy, a &#34;fully synthesized human consciousness&#34; on a computer, something which O&#39;Malley laments is not A.I. Anyone who visits Endorphinport.com can speak with Jeremy, who has his opinions on politics, sports, and his own life experiences.




O&#39;Malley has even more plans for Endorphin Port to turn it into the fully realized concept he had joked about in the two-year-old sketch (via Vulture), including &#34;a VR thing.&#34; O&#39;Malley said of his ambitious Endorphin Port undertakings:



Well, soon they&#39;ll be meeting Jeremy, the world’s first fully synthesized human consciousness on the computer. It’s not AI, it’s a real person. You can speak to him at EndorphinPort.com. There’s a VR thing we’re working on that’s still in the early stages. There’s a lot of stupid s**t I’d like to do with it. I’m not trying to be coy about it. But eventually, people can enter the Endorphin Port and experience what life would be like free of flesh and living fully inside of the computer.




Along with various elements that mimic the absurdity of the sketch, including nonsensical products, bizarre testimonials, and cryptic messages, all designed to enhance the satirical nature of the project, Endorphin Port continues to grow. This statement highlights Conner O&#39;Malley&#39;s skill in using humor to make poignant observations about the world along with comedy that can be interactive, making &#34;Endorphin Port&#34; more than just a sketch, but a reflection of our digital era.
