# Why So Many Sitcom Characters Use Their Actors  Real Names


## SUMMARY 



  Sitcom characters often share the same first name as the actor playing them, creating a stronger association between the two personas.   Sitcoms were commonly used as a promotional tool for the main actor, making the use of their real name beneficial for building their career.   Using the actor&#39;s real name in a sitcom makes filming and communication easier, eliminating confusion and streamlining the process.

## Literature Review
Many sitcom tropes have become important traditions of the genre, and this has led to certain character names on TV being pretty unoriginal.




Sitcoms wouldn&#39;t be the same without their many traditions, but there&#39;s a certain quirk of the genre that&#39;s quite interesting: a lot of characters use their actors&#39; real names. This trope is less common nowadays, but it&#39;s not gone. Although some may not think twice about this character trend, it can stick out like a sore thumb to others. Sitcom characters can sometimes become inseparable from the actors that portray them in the eyes of fans, and there&#39;s often a good reason why this can happen.




The TV sitcom is a long-running genre, with the format dating back to the 1940s. Over the decades, the backgrounds of sitcom stars have varied across some of the best sitcoms of all time. Traditionally, trained actors have filled certain leading roles, whereas other shows have had comedians taking the spotlight instead. However, the latter of these two groups is largely responsible for a pattern that has continued into 21st-century sitcoms, albeit on a less common basis.


 Many Sitcom Characters Share The Same First Name As Their Actors 
The reason for this can depend on the type of sitcom being made.
         

There are a variety of sitcoms from various periods of television history where the stars have the same first name as the character they&#39;re portraying. However, this isn&#39;t a coincidence, as the character&#39;s personality is also often very similar to the actor&#39;s. The choice has been made on a conscious level by the writers and studios to create a stronger association between the two personas.




In certain cases, only the first name is carried over. For example, Charlie Sheen&#39;s character in Two and a Half Men is called Charlie Harper. In other instances, the first and last names are used by the character â€” Seinfeld&#39;s Jerry Seinfeld and Will Smith from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air are instances where sitcom actors shared their entire names. There also tends to be a disparity between multi-camera sitcoms and single-camera sitcoms when it comes to an actor&#39;s in-show identity.

A multi-camera sitcom tends to be filmed in front of a live studio audience, and it can be more common for a sitcom actor in a setting such as this to share at least their first name with their character. For example, Ray Romano plays Ray Barone in Everybody Loves Raymond. Scrubs is an example of a single-camera sitcom, a format that tends not to feature a live audience and is instead shot like a more conventional TV show. Scrubs&#39; leading man is Zach Braff, who plays John &#34;JD&#34; Dorian on the show instead of a version of himself.






There are exceptions to this single/multi-camera trend. For example, Friends is a multi-camera sitcom where none of the main cast use their own names.






 Sitcoms Were Often Vehicles For The Main Character 
The TV sitcom format can be a good promotional tool for the star.
          

One of the main purposes of a sitcom, besides entertainment, has been to promote the actor in the lead role. If the actor in question was not already a star, the production aimed to make them into one. As such, using the actor/comedian&#39;s first (and sometimes last) name creates a stronger association between the performer and their character. This was reinforced by the actors essentially playing a semi-fictionalized version of themselves.

                  12 Actors Who Went From Sitcoms To Movies   Many A-list actors start in small-screen roles, including sitcoms, before making it big in the movie business.    




Although the traditional multi-camera sitcom format does still exist on modern television, it&#39;s much less common. Instead, single-camera sitcoms such as Community and New Girl have become more prevalent, with actors tending to be cast rather than comedians. Due to the reduced popularity of the multi-camera sitcom in recent years, the format is no longer seen as the promotional tool for a comedian&#39;s career to the level that it once was. Ensemble casts have also had great amounts of success rather than focusing so heavily on a star. As a result, the trend of sitcom characters having the same name as the actor has also been on the decline.



Seinfeld is one of the more obvious examples of a sitcom being used to promote a comedian&#39;s career. Jerry Seinfeld would often open and close an episode of the show with a stand-up comedy routine.






 Using Real Actor Names Makes Recording Sitcoms Much Easier 
This tradition takes one step out of the process of filming a sitcom.
          




There can be a lot to consider when shooting a sitcom, especially one in front of a live studio audience. Therefore, certain steps can be taken to help the process go more smoothly. For instance, communicating with actors can get confusing when discussing their characters. This is especially true if the actor is a stand-up comedian with little or no acting experience. Addressing an actor by their own name can help dispel any confusion regarding who&#39;s being referenced.

Some sitcoms may also include child stars or guest actors who are not always on set. For both groups, learning two names for each actor can be a confusing and possibly daunting task. If the incoming actor is already aware of the star of the sitcom, it can also be easy to only think of them only as their character if they do not know them personally. If the actor&#39;s name and persona are already the same as their character, the distinction between the two doesn&#39;t need to be so clear.

                  The 10 Highest-Paid Sitcom Stars Of All Time   Many of the sitcom genre&#39;s most looming stars have significantly profited from their work, despite television&#39;s former reputation as a lesser medium.    




So, although this sitcom trend can seem like lazy writing on the surface, there are actually many functional reasons why so many of the genre&#39;s big names also apply to their characters. Not only does it streamline the process of writing and filming a sitcom, but the real-life personality of a comedian can sometimes be engaging enough to carry most of the show on its own.
