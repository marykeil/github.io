 Jordan Made A Strong First Impression On Rachel 

 

On the premiere of Rachel&#39;s Bachelorette season, race car driver Jordan made Rachel&#39;s heart race when he pulled her aside to show her the bright red race car that he drives. He impressed her by attempting to make a connection with her over the fact that he had to learn how to operate his car in the same way that she spent hours and hours learning the controls in order to fly an airplane. Jordan told her that hopefully some day she could teach him how to fly a plane, and he could show her how to drive a race car.




In her confessional, Rachel said that Jordan really surprised her, and she was smitten with him. This only intensified when he told her, &#34;I came here for you.&#34; However, Rachel admitted that she was a little bit surprised when Jordan didn&#39;t kiss her. She said that she knew that it was only night one, but Clayton Echard kissed her on night one of his Bachelor season.



 Rachel Gave Jordan The First One-On-One Date Of Her Bachelorette Season 

 

When it came time to select someone for her first one-on-one-date of her Bachelorette season, Rachel chose Jordan. On the date, they flew in a plane in order to experience zero gravity.

In his confessional, Jordan said that he was grateful that Rachel saw something in him, and that &#34;the beginning of forever could start today.&#34;

When they had dinner together, Jordan opened up to Rachel about his family, and how his parents&#39; divorce affected him. Although she listened attentively, Rachel began to feel that she didn&#39;t have any chemistry with Jordan. She left the table to think. Rachel eventually told Jordan that she couldn&#39;t give him the date rose, and ended their relationship. However, she felt terrible about it. Rachel was the first Bachelorette lead ever to eliminate someone on her first one-on-one date of the season.

Even though Rachel didn&#39;t feel much of a spark with Jordan on The Bachelorette, the fact that she said that she always wondered what could&#39;ve been with him is a great sign. Jordan is a sweet and kind man who would make a great match for her. Rachel has already dated Sean McLaughlin, Brayden Bowers, and Tanner Courtad during Bachelor in Paradise season 9, but perhaps Jordan will be Rachel&#39;s perfect match. It&#39;s exciting to know that Rachel and Jordan might have a second chance at true love during Bachelor in Paradise season 9.
