## Literature Review
These 90 Day Fiancé men are known for their conniving ways. They may be true sanky pankys, who used women in order to get cash and Green Cards. 




In 90 Day Fiancé and its spin-offs, women who are searching for love visit resorts in the Dominican Republic and beyond, only to find that there are sharks on land, as well as in the aquamarine waters. Vulnerable females with checkered romantic histories frequently have their heads turned by handsome men who lurk on the sugar-sand beaches. 90 Day Fiancé sanky pankys like Yohan Geronimo have money and Green Cards on their minds, but they&#39;re hardened seducers who know how to convince their targets that they&#39;re in it for love. Of course, these weird relationships, which often feature major league age gaps and dramatic power imbalances, end in tears.




These men come from poorer countries, and if they get the chance, they will use women for money. Grinding poverty can create a ruthless mindset. People who are very poor can perhaps be forgiven for doing anything to change their circumstances, but the 90 Day Fiancé gold diggers come off like human cash registers. Their motives are transparent, and only the women they&#39;re duping really believe in them. When these women figure out what everyone else already knows, the tears start to fall. After the heartache fades, the women sometimes give in to the kind of female rage that drives works of fiction like Gillian Flynn&#39;s Gone Girl.

 Yohan Geronimo Really Played Daniele Gates 
How Could She Believe In The Man With The Dollar Sign Tattoo?
         

Yohan spotted his prey (Daniele) while she frolicked at a resort. Like a shark, he smelled fresh chum in the water and raced towards it. It could be argued that Daniele&#39;s life was ruined by this man, even though she wouldn&#39;t give him what he really wanted - the American Drwam. Why should he stay in DR when bright lights and big cities beckoned? In the USA, he could shoot for the sort of glitzy lifestyle that is the sanky panky&#39;s brass ring.




To the sanky panky, America&#39;s like Oz. It&#39;s all about following a yellow brick road that seems to be paved with pure gold. Behind the curtain, the Wizard of Oz wasn&#39;t all he was cracked up to be. Likewise, the American Dream isn&#39;t always so dreamy. However, to Yohan, America was everything.

Daniele wanted a different lifestyle. She hoped to live in the Dominican Republic, where she could leave the pressures of life in the Big Apple behind. Yohan was desperate to take a bite of that same apple. This impasse led the couple to the rocks. The sanky panky/older woman dynamic only succeeds when the younger man gets the perks that he&#39;s expecting. By moving to DR, Daniele drove the first nail into the coffin.

While Yohan&#39;s the gold digger, Daniele&#39;s own blunders are now legendary. She decided to forfeit some of her pension in order to go for her dream. Now, she&#39;s lost that money... and Yohan too. The romance ended in a way that seasoned 90 Day Fiancé viewers probably anticipated. She discovered that Yohan had been cheating on her for two full years. Now, she&#39;s picking up the pieces back in the city that she tried to flee.




This cautionary tale&#39;s a sad story, but she can rebuild. Her life isn&#39;t over. Right now, she&#39;s still in the &#34;female rage&#34; phase. When she&#39;s haunted by the phantoms of the past, she may revert to the &#34;tears&#34; phase. Accepting disappointment is part of life and there&#39;s a lot that she has to come to terms with. While Daniele&#39;s lashing out right now, by cryptically commenting on &#34;transactional&#34; relationships via Instagram, she&#39;s also moving forward. She&#39;s sharing pieces of her life with her followers and focusing on getting the most out of every day. Yohan is gone, and life goes on.



Daniele Gates deserves some grace even though she was gullible. She seemed to really love her partner. Yes, she made a mistake, but that doesn&#39;t make her a villain. The user Yohan&#39;s a worse human being.






 Pedro Jimeno&#39;s Another Sanky Panky Heartbreaker 
Did Pedro Jimeno Ever Really Love Chantel Everett?
         




Pedro didn&#39;t meet Chantel at a resort, so he&#39;s not the classic sanky panky. However, he has plenty in common with the types of guys who look for wealthy females at sun-soaked destinations. In Pedro&#39;s case, he was hired to teach Chantel Spanish, but he taught her way more than that. Right before their split (and afterward), those lessons were brutal. Early on, Chantel was alerted to a significant red flag. Someone told her that Pedro was using her for a Green Card, but that wasn&#39;t enough to change her mind. She was deeply in love with Pedro, who broke her heart in The Family Chantel season 5.

Chantel ignored a lot of clues that Pedro wasn&#39;t her &#34;forever&#34; match. He might be more like his greedy and grasping family members than she could ever have imagined. He would defend Nicole Jimeno and Lidia Morel sometimes, but they were cold and callous. Pedro acted just like them onscreen during the newest season, which is possibly the final The Family Chantel installment.




It&#39;s not like Pedro&#39;s unwilling to work hard. Post-split, he&#39;s really leaning into his real estate agent career. However, to achieve his goals, he seemed to feel like he had to be in America. That&#39;s where things get sketchy. To get where he wanted to be in life, he had to get a Green Card. The easiest way to do this was to use an American woman. Chantel is very glamorous, just like Pedro, so it seemed like their relationship might be the real thing. However, in hindsight, Pedro might have been playing Chantel.



 Luis Mendez Wasn&#39;t A Real Partner To Molly Hopkins 
Luis Mendez Couldn&#39;t Handle Life With Molly &amp; Her Kids

 

The clip shown above (as per TLC UK) makes it crystal clear that Luis and Molly were a terrible mismatch. The former bartender from the Dominican Republic fit the sanky panky mold to perfection. He went for the easy life in Georgia, USA with Molly, but the realities of living with an older woman with children were simply too much for him. He got inappropriate with the kids. In a semi-paternal role, he failed spectacularly.




Molly hasn&#39;t been lucky in love because she&#39;s chosen badly. All the women mentioned in this article have made the same mistakes. After Luis, who&#39;s now married to an American woman and living in the USA (he did have a deportation scare) and Molly divorced, she moved on too. However, she chose Kelly Brown, whose tumultuous relationship with her was featured on 90 Day: The Single Life. Now, she&#39;s rumored to be dating a man who ended up in prison on drug trafficking charges.

Where would the 90 Day Fiancé franchise be without sanky pankys? They add so much spice but also wreak havoc. Women who fall for their smooth lines and fit bodies often end up regretting every single minute that they spent with these &#34;resort guys.&#34; Sanky pankys are there to teach women important lessons about life. In this sense, the show and spin-offs are deeply educational. Viewers can watch and learn, and hopefully avoid temptation during their next tropical getaways.



The Family Chantel airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
