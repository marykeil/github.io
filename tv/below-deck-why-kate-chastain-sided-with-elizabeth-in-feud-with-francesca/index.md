# Below Deck Why Kate Chastain Sided With Elizabeth In Feud With Francesca


## SUMMARY 



  Former Chief Stew Kate Chastain supports stewardess Elizabeth in her feud with Francesca on Below Deck season 8, defending her actions and highlighting her apologetic and respectful attitude.   Kate&#39;s tweet defending Elizabeth&#39;s firing received mixed reactions from fans, but she stood by her opinion and hinted that she never fired anyone during her time on the show.   Kate&#39;s support for Elizabeth may be because she wasn&#39;t aware of everything that happened on and off camera, and Elizabeth&#39;s focus on her relationship with James affected her performance as a stewardess.

## Literature Review
Former Below Deck chief stew Kate Chastain came to Elizabeth Frankini&#39;s defense after she was fired by Francesa Rubi for sleeping in a guest cabin.




Former Chief Stew Kate Chastain sided with stewardess Elizabeth Frankini in her feud with Francesca Rubi on Below Deck season 8. Bravo&#39;s Below Deck and its spin-offs document the fabulous lives of the guests and crews onboard chartered superyachts. The show might feature dramatic guests, but the primary focus is on the crew and how they cope with both each other and their demanding clients. The crew runs the gamut of emotions and relationships throughout their season. Whether fighting, romancing, or beyond, they never stop entertaining.




On the terrible Below Deck season 8, stewardess Elizabeth had problems with the new chief stew, Francesca. Whether it was how slow Elizabeth was with her duties or her copious mistakes, it seemed she could never do right by Francesca. The drama peaked thanks to Elizabeth&#39;s one-sided relationship with fellow crew member James Hough, in which the pair spent the night in a guest room. The yacht had no guests on board, but sleeping in guest rooms was disrespectful to the rest of the crew.


 Kate Weighed In On Elizabeth&#39;s Firing On Below Deck 
          

Francesca drew the line at Elizabeth and James&#39; disrespect. Following that mistake, Elizabeth was fired with only two charters left. That makes her the first stew ever to be fired from Below Deck. After the fallout onscreen, Kate defended Elizabeth, tweeting, &#34;I seriously can’t even count how many times I’ve slept in a guest cabin.&#34; Later, Kate continued her defense of Elizabeth, clarifying she didn&#39;t think she was that bad of a stew. When a fan asked if Kate would want Elizabeth on her team, she tweeted, &#34;Mistakes happen. But I appreciate how Elizabeth was always apologetic and respectful and kept working after making mistakes.&#34;






 Fans Were Mixed On Kate&#39;s Tweet Reacting to Elizabeth&#39;s Below Deck Firing 
          

Some fans disagreed with Kate&#39;s interpretation of the problem. However, she stayed strong in her opinion. When a fan suggested Kate would have fired Elizabeth as well, she responded, &#34;Lol remind me of a stew that I fired.” While Kate certainly had issues with some team members, she never fired anyone during her time on the show.

Still, while Kate may not have had a problem with Elizabeth&#39;s behavior, she was not around for everything that happened on and off camera. Francesca and Ashling Lorger had to pick up Elizabeth&#39;s slack, as she was more focused on getting strung along by James than on service. Perhaps if Elizabeth were excellent in every other respect as a stew, Francesca would not have fired her.

Francesca might not have been able to deal with Elizabeth after the guest room debacle, but it seems like Kate would have been just fine since she had a stellar track record. That being said, perhaps if Kate experienced the kind of trouble Francesca did because of Elizabeth, she would not be so quick to tweet. However, Kate has never been one to keep quiet with her opinions regarding Below Deck.
