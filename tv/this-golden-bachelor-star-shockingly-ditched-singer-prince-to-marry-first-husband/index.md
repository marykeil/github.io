## Literature Review
A Golden Bachelor contestant recalls the golden days of her youth when she received &#34;explicit&#34; letters from &#34;Sexy Dancer&#34; singer Prince.




A cast member from The Golden Bachelor season 1 is spilling unknown details about her relationship with Prince when they were both 18 years old. The Bachelor franchise&#39;s first senior citizen star Gerry Turner was announced as the lead of The Golden Bachelor in July 2023. The 71-year-old grandpa from Indiana got a second chance at love after the death of his wife Toni when he searched for a partner with whom he could share the sunset years of his life. Gerry was joined by 22 women between the ages of 60 and 75. In November 2023, there were just two women left on The Golden Bachelor going into the finale.




Out of the two, Gerry gave the final rose to Theresa Nist, but Leslie Fhima is now talking about another incomplete love story of hers in the latest episode of the Bachelor Happy Hour podcast. Leslie opened up about how she met the &#34;Purple Rain&#34; singer and how she chose her first husband. Leslie and Prince had made a plan to meet at midnight &#34;at a certain location.&#34; While she waited for Prince to arrive at her cousin&#39;s house, Leslie saw Bradley Chazin, her first husband, across the room. &#34;I had known him before, but I saw him and he is so handsome,&#34; she remembered. Leslie decided to stay with Bradley as she thought Price &#34;probably [is] not going to be my husband someday.&#34;

Leslie said she had a cousin named Bobby Z who was Prince&#39;s friend and drummer for The Revolution. Leslie and Prince were the same age when Bobby introduced them. &#34;And he was amazing,” she added. Leslie would go to his house and he’d play guitar and sing for her. Leslie recalled Prince having a great sense of humor and being &#34;hysterical,&#34; even though people thought he was shy and reserved. Leslie claims Prince&#39;s song &#34;Sexy Dancer&#34; from 1979 is about her. “I was dancing in a fashion show and Bobby brought him to the fashion show, and he&#39;s kind of like hiding behind a pole, and I was coming downstairs dancing,” Leslie remembered.





 

According to Leslie, Prince praised her dancing skills and told her he was going to write a song about her. The song came out not too long after that, and Leslie graduated from high school to become a professional figure skater in the Ice Follies. At the same time, &#34;Prince started to become Prince.” Leslie was with Prince when he went on tour. Whenever he used to be &#34;in a city—especially in L.A. at the Forum—he drove the limo up that ramp, and all the girls saw me get into the limo.&#34; Leslie said it was around that time that Prince wrote some letters to her, which were &#34;amazing&#34; but also “a little explicit.&#34;

Leslie has two children, Chloe and Elijah, from her second marriage with David. Leslie remained single for 22 years in search of a true partnership. She was one of the first women in the competition to catch Gerry&#39;s eye. However, she eventually landed in second place after Gerry decided his feelings for Theresa were stronger following the overnight dates.
