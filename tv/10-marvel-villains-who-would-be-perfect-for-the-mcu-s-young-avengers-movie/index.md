## Literature Review

The MCU has a wide range of villains who could appear in the franchise’s premier Young Avengers movie, some of which have already been introduced.




As the Marvel Cinematic Universe establishes its line-up for a Young Avengers movie, the potential villain they will face is still unknown. However, there are numerous examples from Marvel Comics who would be the perfect antagonists for the superhero team, some of which already exist in the MCU timeline. Considering the franchise&#39;s changes to canon and cast, their next major villain will be vital to the MCU&#39;s future, and a Young Avengers movie is the ideal place to establish them.
There are already several potential members of the Young Avengers team in the MCU. The hero&#39;s line-up often consists of younger counterparts to the Avengers team. The Marvels depicted Kamala Khan&#39;s transformation into Ms. Marvel, who promptly recruited Hawkeye&#39;s protégé, Kate Bishop. Further members have been teased, who will need a formidable villain to face, necessitating the Young Avengers assembling.
            
 
 9 Original Avengers Replacements Introduced In MCU Phase 4 &amp; 5 (So Far) 
After the events of Avengers: Endgame, Marvel Studios has slowly been replacing the MCU&#39;s original Avengers team with several new legacy heroes.












 








 10  Kingpin Is A Prominent Villain In The MCU&#39;s Future 
The Kingpin Is A Famed Marvel Antagonist


 







Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin has been triumphantly reintroduced into the MCU canon with Hawkeye and Echo. With more villainous deeds expected in future MCU entrants, the Kingpin could be the ideal foe to bring the Young Avengers together in the MCU. Though the Young Avengers have little interaction with Wilson Fisk in Marvel Comics, the crime lord&#39;s insidious network is far-reaching enough to warrant the young heroes&#39; team-up. He has already made an enemy out of Kate Bishop, whom Ms. Marvel recruited at the end of The Marvels. With Kang&#39;s future unclear, Kingpin could be the MCU&#39;s new major villain.





 9  Kang Is The Multiverse Saga&#39;s Main Villain 
Kang&#39;s Future In The MCU Is Unclear


 







Kang the Conqueror was the intended main villain for the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga. However, after Jonathan Majors&#39; exit from the franchise, this has been thrown into question somewhat. Nevertheless, with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, it was expected that a new team of heroes would face the multiversal threat Kang poses. Kang would, therefore, be an ideal movie for the Young Avengers to be officially introduced into the MCU. While this is likely to change considering the changes to Avengers 5, it is possible a Kang variant played by a different actor can resume the role.





 8  The MCU Could Adapt A New Version Of Madame Masque 
Madame Masque Is A Notable Avengers Villain


 







Madame Masque, also known as Whitney Frost, is a significant Marvel character, recognized for her presence as both a formidable villain and a complex antihero. Though primarily associated with Iron Man, she has repeatedly confronted the Avengers. Her combat skills, strategic mastery, and connections to organized crime position her as a compelling Avengers adversary in the comics. She could, therefore, be a potential villain in the MCU&#39;s Young Avengers movie, proffering a more grounded villain to face the younger heroes. Madame Masque previously appeared in Agent Carter but could be re-established in the MCU.





 7  The Wrecking Crew Previously Appeared In She-Hulk 
The Wrecking Crew Faced The Young Avengers In The Comics
        

The Wrecking Crew, a quartet of villains with enchanted construction tools, made an impact in Marvel Comics and was featured in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. Comprising Wrecker, Bulldozer, Piledriver, and Thunderball, they often clash with She-Hulk and other heroes. The Wrecking Crew faced the Young Avengers in Marvel Comics&#39; Seige event, providing a comic book precedent. The Wrecking Crew&#39;s appearance in She-Hulk was brief and seemed to tease their return. They would make an ideal villain team for the Young Avengers movies, potentially returning as a more considerable threat that requires the Young Avengers team to unite.





 6  Doctor Doom Is A Long Awaited Marvel Villain 
Doctor Doom Is A Prolific Marvel Comics Villain With Ties To The Young Avengers
        

Doctor Doom is one of the greatest and most iconic Marvel villains ever, but he still hasn&#39;t made his MCU debut. A formidable adversary, Doom&#39;s arrival in the MCU has been highly anticipated, with the potential to carry an entire saga. In the comics, Doom frequently interacts with Wiccan, Scarlet Witch&#39;s son, and appears prominently in Marvel Comics&#39; 2010-2012 miniseries, Avengers: The Children&#39;s Crusade, in which the Young Avengers search for the missing Scarlet Witch. These could prompt potential narratives to establish the Young Avengers team while finally introducing Doctor Doom to the MCU.





 5  The Dark Avengers Could Imitate Established MCU Avengers 
The Dark Avengers Is A Notable Marvel Comics Supervillain Team
        

Marvel&#39;s Dark Avengers, led by Norman Osborn, emerged as a twisted counterpart to the original superhero team. Formed during the aftermath of the Secret Invasion storyline, Osborn handpicked villains like Bullseye, Venom, and Moonstone, who assumed established heroic identities. The Dark Avengers&#39; morally ambiguous exploits explored themes of manipulation and corruption, offering a unique perspective on heroism. The Dark Avengers could be introduced into the MCU as crooked imitations of previous Avengers. A subsequent clash with the Young Avengers could bridge the Avengers generations in the MCU, with the Young Avengers symbolically defeating their predecessors and assuming the mantle.





 4  Master Pandemonium Is A Classic Young Avengers Foe 
Master Pandemonium Could Be Introduced With Mephisto
        

Master Pandemonium is a demonic supervillain who frequently clashes with the Young Avengers in Marvel Comics. A former Hollywood actor named Martin Oreston, Pandemonium made a Faustian deal with Mephisto, leading to his transformation. Seeking to reclaim the fragments of his soul scattered across different dimensions, Master Pandemonium has the power to transform his limbs into grotesque demons. He often came into contact with Marvel heroes, including the Young Avengers. The character&#39;s infernal nature makes Master Pandemonium a fascinating and tormented figure who could be perfect for the MCU - particularly if the franchise introduces Mephisto and the Hell dimension.





 3  The Skrulls Could Continue Posing A Threat 
There Are Still Skrull On Earth After Secret Invasion


 







In the dramatic conclusion to Secret Invasion, the potential was left open for further conflict with the alien race known as the Skrulls. The Skrulls have been firmly established in the MCU and had frequent clashes with the Young Avengers in Marvel Comics. The shape-shifting nature of the Skrulls could help forge the Young Avengers into a formidable force while exploring themes of unity and trust. Dealing with any hostile Skrulls that are remaining on Earth could provide the perfect threat to assemble the Young Avengers for their first MCU outing.





 2  Scarlet Witch&#39;s Conflicted Status Has Comic Book Precedent 
Scarlet Witch&#39;s Children Are Members Of The Young Avengers


 







Scarlet Witch would be a captivating villain in the MCU&#39;s Young Avengers, primarily as two of her children are members of the Marvel Comics Young Avengers team. Tommy and Billy appeared in WandaVision, and are key members, Wiccan and Speed. Scarlet Witch&#39;s character evolution seemingly concluded in the MCU with her death in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. While Billy and Tommy only exist in a separate timeline. However, the Multiverse Saga has the potential to make some dramatic changes, which could bring the twins and a Scarlet Witch variant into the MCU&#39;s primary universe.





 1  The Young Masters Is The Evil Counterpart to The Young Avengers 
The Young Avengers Frequently Clash With The Young Masters
        

The Young Masters is the villainous counterpart to the Young Avengers and would, therefore, make ideal villains for the MCU&#39;s Young Avengers movie. Much like Marvel Comics&#39; Dark Avengers, the Young Masters is a supervillain team designed as a villainous analog to the Young Avengers, who often pose as them. The dynamic between the young Avengers and their counterparts would bring themes of identity and morality while also posing a threat that requires the team&#39;s assembly. The clash of emerging heroes and their dark reflections could create a complex and emotionally charged story for the MCU&#39;s Young Avengers.
