## Literature Review

The big twist in the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 finale finally gives the Monsterverse an opportunity to introduce its missing mecha-Titan.





Summary

  The season finale of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters hints at the introduction of a mecha-Titan, potentially on Skull Island.   The show deviates from the heroic portrayal of Monarch in the Monsterverse movies, as APEX rescues the main characters.   Monarch: Legacy of Monsters may explain why Monarch desires a mechanized giant and how it ties into Mechagodzilla in the Monsterverse.  







The twist at the end of the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 finale means the Monsterverse may be on the cusp of introducing its missing mecha-Titan. Wrapping up on a game-changing development, the finale revealed that two years had passed on the surface while Kurt Russell&#39;s Lee Shaw, Cate, and May were stuck in the underground world. In addition to moving the story forward to 2017, the show made the surprise move of putting the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters characters on Skull Island, Kong&#39;s home in the Monsterverse.

Despite people within Monarch typically being portrayed as heroic figures in the Monsterverse movies, it wasn&#39;t the organization that came to the main characters&#39; rescue. Rather, it was APEX who helped retrieve them from the Hollow Earth entrance. The villains responsible for the creation of Mechagodzilla in Godzilla vs. Kong, APEX was approached by Tim, Kentaro, and Hiroshi Randa off-screen after they figured out that Cate and the others were still alive. As a result of their unexpected alliance, it would seem that instead of strengthening their ties to their family legacy, they&#39;ll be spending time with APEX in their base on Skull Island.





 Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters&#39; Skull Island Reveal Sets Up A New Mecha-Titan 
          

Given the presence of Kong and all sorts of other creatures, the decision to make Skull Island a future setting for the series grants the show all sorts of opportunities when it comes to monster action. One of these avenues relates to a tease from Godzilla: King of the Monsters that the Monsterverse never paid off. In the movie&#39;s credits, a newspaper article titled &#34;Monarch Boosts Forces Around Skull Island,&#34; described the claims of a scientist named Del La Rosa about Monarch&#39;s activities on the island. According to Del La Rosa, Monarch had attempted to develop both &#34;organic Titans&#34; and a &#34;mechanized giant&#34; on SKull Island.

In 2019, Monarch&#39;s interest in building a &#34;mechanized giant&#34; on Skull Island certainly sounded like setup for Mechagodzilla. However, the knowledge that Mechagodzilla was built by APEX in a secret facility underneath Hong Kong completely dispelled that notion in Godzilla vs. Kong. Clearly, whatever was being constructed on Skull Island was something other than Godzilla&#39;s robotic counterpart. The Monsterverse has yet to clear up that loose end, but if Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 happens, a chance to do that may still present itself.




Monarch: Legacy of Monsters heading in this direction seems feasible, especially when keeping in mind the fact that Monarch has a base on Skull Island. So while the characters may be with APEX for the time being, Monarch&#39;s presence on Skull Island is likely to be heavily featured as well. After all, the organization - and the Randa kids&#39; connection to them - is at the heart of the show. For that reason, the series should be in an excellent position to take a peek into what Monarch has been up to. And given that Del La Rosa&#39;s account detailed something that had happened before 2019, the 2017 setting goes hand-in-hand with that setup.



 Monarch&#39;s Show May Have Already Explained Why Monarch Builds A Mecha-Titan 
          

What&#39;s more, the Monsterverse may already have a working explanation for why Monarch would even desire a &#34;mechanized giant&#34; under their control. It&#39;s important to note that the plot of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters emphasized Monarch&#39;s alleged failure to combat the Titan threat. Lee Shaw, for instance, pointedly told Verdugo that Monarch had been doing &#34;nothing&#34; to stop the Titans even though they&#39;ve had 60 years to prepare for their arrival. He argued that Monarch had no contingency plan for a scenario in which the MUTOs defeated Godzilla.




In a sense, Lee Shaw isn&#39;t wrong in his belief that Monarch doesn&#39;t have a defense against the Titans. It&#39;s possible in the aftermath of what took place in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1, Verdugo and other Monarch officials will reluctantly agree that at least in this respect, Shaw was right. If that&#39;s the case, Monarch may endeavor to create a weapon capable of stopping a Titan. As for why it doesn&#39;t show up to fight Ghidorah or Mechagodzilla in the Monsterverse, the events of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 may be able to explain what became of the project and perhaps why it failed.



 Monarch&#39;s Mecha-Titan Can Continue Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters&#39; Mechagodzilla Story 
          

Not only would using the mecha-Titan allow Monarch: Legacy of Monsters to solve a Monsterverse mystery, but it would also fit in well with the show&#39;s efforts to give a proper origin story for APEX&#39;s Mechagodzilla. Little was known about what led to Mechagodzilla&#39;s construction - until Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 7. The series cleverly used May&#39;s backstory to reveal clues about where Mechagodzilla came from. Apparently, it conducted illegal experiments on monkeys as part of their plan for a &#34;neuro-cybernetic interface.&#34; By all indications, this was one of the first steps toward the technology they used to let Ren Serizawa mentally control Mechagodzilla in Godzilla vs. Kong.




It stands to reason that if Monarch: Legacy of Monsters does use the missing mecha-Titan, it too would be a step toward Mechagodzilla&#39;s awakening in Godzilla vs. Kong. As for how that could work, one possibility is that APEX assists Monarch as a continuation of the deal they made with Verdugo. In episode 7, Brenda Holland made it clear that learning about the Titans is among their goals in the Monsterverse. That&#39;s why working together with Monarch to build a Mecha-Titan can be a learning experience that will benefit the Mechagodzilla project.



 Who Is Monarch&#39;s Mecha-Titan In The Monsterverse? 
         

Partially because Mecahgodzilla isn&#39;t the only robot in Godzilla&#39;s universe, the prospect of there being two mecha-Titans in the Monsterverse isn&#39;t too hard to fathom. There are two others that Godzilla has come in contact with over the years: Jet Jaguar and Moguera. Appearing in Godzilla vs. Megalon, Jet Jaguar was an Ultraman-esque robot who fought beside Godzilla in a two-on-two showdown against Megalon and Gigan. As for Mogeura, it was a robot the Japanese government designed to beat Godzilla in Godzilla vs. Spacegodzilla. Ultimately, though, Moguera emerged as an ally to Godzilla against SpaceGodzilla.




Since both have been used by humans to fight on their behalf, either would fit with Monarch&#39;s modus operandi. That said, Jet Jaguar is one of the campiest characters in the Godzilla franchise, and a robot the Monsterverse may struggle to include in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, a project much darker and more serious than recent installments like Godzilla vs. Kong. Moguera is the much more sensible option, as the robot could fit into the show&#39;s world. Alternatively, the Monsterverse could create an original mecha-Titan. Due to season 1 opting for an original monster as Godzilla&#39;s opponent in episode 10, that could indeed be the course it takes with Monarch&#39;s robot - if it appears.



All 10 episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 are available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.
