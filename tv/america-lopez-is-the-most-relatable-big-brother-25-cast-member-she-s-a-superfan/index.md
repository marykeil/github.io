## Literature Review
After getting released from the house, it&#39;s quickly become clear Big Brother 25&#39;s America Lopez is the most relatable cast member from this season.




Big Brother 25 has come to an end, but many enjoy getting to know the houseguests outside the game and is making it more obvious than ever that America Lopez is the most relatable houseguest from the BB 25 cast. While some were already under the impression that America was the most fun player to watch throughout Big Brother 25, seeing her outside the pressure of the game has brought out an entirely new side to the native Texan. With her time in the BB house over, America is learning more about what happened in the game and sharing her thoughts online for her new followers to hear.




Throughout Big Brother 25, America has shared her passion for the game, which she&#39;s been a fan of since an early age. A first generation Mexican American, America explained that as a child she found Big Brother because it was on basic cable, which was all she had access to. After getting into the series when she was young, America got the chance to keep up with Big Brother as she grew older. As an avid fan of the game, America has observed from afar for years, and finally took her chance to play seriously.


 America Is A Genuine Big Brother Superfan 
         

Every BB superfan knows that going into the game with a strategy may not matter, especially when there are always twists to be accounted for. America was able to fly under the radar for the first weeks of the game after ensuring her safety during the opening night competitions, but coming into the game, she knew she would have to come up with a BB strategy as the game began. America&#39;s time on Big Brother was fascinating to watch, as she was able to talk about past BB seasons and strategies with ease, referencing things other superfans loved to hear while some of her fellow houseguests were none the wiser.






 America&#39;s Social Media Presence Is Hilarious 
America Can Be Found On Instagram &amp; Twitter

 

Although America&#39;s social media was locked down during her time in the Big Brother house, since coming out of the jury house, she&#39;s reactivated her profiles. Initially only on Twitter, America&#39;s past tweets have proven to be some of the funniest, most relatable out of the rest of the cast. Sharing her love for all things reality TV, America has been an avid member of Twitter for years along with her love for Bachelor Nation. Her social media presence has been authentic, funny, and generally left viewers realizing they&#39;d seen the real America on the BB live feeds. While it was something she spoke about not doing in the house, America also reactivated her Instagram account.

While she was adamant about no longer having Instagram during her time in the BB 25 house, America chose to reinstate her profile after a years-long hiatus. Sharing her first post with Cory Wurtenberger, her Big Brother 25 showmance turned boyfriend, America showed off a few photos of the couple in the days after the finale. Though she hasn&#39;t posted actively since 2019, America&#39;s return to Instagram allowed fans to see her past posts, which are just as funny as her Tweets. With a sharp, sarcastic sense of humor, America&#39;s return to social media has made her even more relatable to BB viewers.






 America&#39;s Honest About Big Brother 25 
          

While America was in the BB house, she mentioned the difficulty of the competitions throughout the season. Noting that, at the time, very few women had won any competitions during BB 25, she was surprised to see just how difficult the competitions were, especially with comp beast and eventual Big Brother winner Jag Bains part of the game. After America was evicted from the BB 25 house during the season&#39;s second double eviction, she was quick to call out the competition inequity during her exit interview with host Julie Chen Moonves. Her honesty about the game was refreshing for viewers who had been complaining about the same thing all season.

Although she&#39;s only been out of the house for a few days, America has already been able to take in some elements of the game she wasn&#39;t aware of previously. After learning about the biggest twist of the season, that Cirie Fields was playing the game with her son, Jared Fields, in secret, America was in for even more realizations as the post-finale weekend began. Reacting to some of the content she hadn&#39;t seen in the jury house, like many of her fellow houseguests being personally hostile about her relationship with Cory, America has been using social media to share her unfiltered opinions on Big Brother 25.






 America &amp; Cory&#39;s Relationship Has Been A Fan Favorite 
          

Although showmances can be dangerous on Big Brother, there have been seasons where romantically linked duos have made it to the end of the game together. Though America and Cory didn&#39;t, watching their relationship grow from a flirty final 2 alliance into a full-blown relationship was sweet for viewers. Their relationship has been unlike anything Big Brother viewers have seen before, as they&#39;re both superfans of the series. America, who was hiding the fact that she graduated from Brown University, and Cory, a student at Vanderbilt University who is a national speech &amp; debate champion, were two of the most intelligent players in the game.

While Cory wasn&#39;t trying to hide his intelligence, it was often alluded to that America was the secret genius of BB 25. Watching a superfan secret genuis showmance come to life was a first for Big Brother, as the duo were able to talk about the game in a shorthand that had never been seen before. Cory and America&#39;s connection was deeper than the game of Big Brother, and knowing that they were able to build a relationship during their time in a legitimate pressure cooker made it even sweeter to see them happily together during their final weeks in the game.






 America&#39;s Continuing To Be Her Authentic Self 
          

As America has posted more on social media and shown off her personality, it&#39;s clear that the America Big Brother viewers got to know on the show is very close to the America who lives in the real world. Seeing someone be their unabashed true self, for better or worse, is always a marker of great reality TV. America was able to give Big Brother 25 a houseguest who was aware of the game, but also aware of what she&#39;d want to see as a viewer. She consistently did as much as she could to be authentic on Big Brother 25, and will surely continue to do so in her life outside the game.
