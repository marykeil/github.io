## SUMMARY 



  Logan Roy&#39;s death in Season 4 of Succession was a pivotal moment, but it almost happened in Season 1.   Keeping Logan alive throughout the series allowed for complex family dynamics and character development.   Logan&#39;s death in Season 4 had a greater impact due to the audience&#39;s understanding of his role and their emotional investment in the character.

## Literature Review
Succession season 4 shocked audiences with a sudden and lethal twist, but it turns out that same plot point was almost used three seasons earlier.




Though the final season of Succession was full of wild twists and turns, there was no plot point more shocking than the death of Roy family patriarch, Logan Roy, but as it turns out, this incredible Succession twist almost happened three seasons earlier. Succession is a drama that ran for four seasons on HBO. The series follows the Roy family, who are at the helm of a massive media conglomerate called Waystar Royco. When the family&#39;s patriarch begins to show signs of illness, the question of who will take over the company becomes incredibly prevalent, to the point where the Roy siblings quickly turn on each other for power.




In Succession season 4, the most impactful moment was the death of Logan Roy. Over the seasons, Logan proved himself to be a cold and cruel man who rarely showed love for his children. However, even then, Logan&#39;s reputation for building Waystar Royco from the ground up preceded him. In this way, his death was not just emotionally challenging for the complete Roy family, but also became an event that the children had to navigate from various angles. Most of all, the Roys had to figure out who would take their father&#39;s throne. In this way, it is surprising to imagine that this plot point nearly happened during Succession season 1.

 Succession Almost Killed Off Logan Roy In Season 1 
          




Although Succession fans will never forget watching that fateful season 4 episode when Logan Roy suddenly died, it seems that this moment nearly happened in the very first season of the show. In an interview with Deadline, the show&#39;s creator, Jesse Armstrong, revealed that he originally intended to have Logan Roy die in the first ever episode of Succession. He said, &#34;I originally thought Logan Roy might die at the end of the first episode then I thought he might die at the end of the first series, but those thoughts were never definitive, they were just vague feelings.&#34;

Despite what Jesse Armstrong felt, he did not end up killing Logan until the very last season. His reasoning for this is that &#34;[Logan] is the planet, the sun they all revolve around.&#34; By this, Armstrong is saying that, for most of Succession, the Roy children would have no purpose without their father. This proves true simply by watching the series itself. The majority of the Roys&#39; decisions are made with their father in mind. In reality, they likely don&#39;t even want to be the CEO, but because their father did it, that is what they want.






 Keeping Logan Roy Alive For Most Of Succession Made The Show Much Better 
         

Jesse Armstrong made the right decision by keeping Logan alive. While Logan&#39;s death felt sort of inevitable, it was great for audiences to be able to watch him for three whole seasons. Once again, it has to do with Logan&#39;s role as the sun of his childrens&#39; lives. Logan is not just a major symbol in the world as the CEO of Waystar Royco. He is also a mammoth for his children, who love him and fear him in equal measure. Every move he made caused a ripple effect on his children. Their complicated relationships, mixed with the family business, made for a particularly interesting and complex story.

Also, in general, Logan is a very interesting character to watch. Succession is full of morally gray characters, all with their own motives and personalities, but Logan is definitely the villain among them. He is a character that is the most difficult to redeem throughout the series, but he is also the most consistent. He is a looming presence throughout the series. Brian Cox&#39;s portrayal of Logan Roy is frustrating, scary, and effective in making the audience feel like they are a Roy child, waiting for his next move. The longer Logan remained in the series, the more effective his death became.

Keeping Logan in every Succession season made his death even better. If Jesse Armstrong had killed Logan in season or episode 1, it is likely that most audience members wouldn&#39;t have cared. So early in the show, he would have been more a symbol than an actual character. But because audiences got to see him over time, they grew to understand his role in the show and developed their own opinions on him. So, when he died, they were impacted just as much as the Roys were. This is especially true because of how sudden it was. Ultimately, Succession succeeded when it came to Logan Roy&#39;s story and ultimate demise.
