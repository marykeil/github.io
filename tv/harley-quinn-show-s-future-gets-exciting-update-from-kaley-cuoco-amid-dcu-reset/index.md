Summary

  Kaley Cuoco expresses surprise but excitement about the future of Harley Quinn and confirms she will continue playing the role.   The show&#39;s renewal for a fifth season in 2023 is not only a testament to its success, but could potentially lead to a larger DC franchise on HBO Max.   With a spinoff centered on Kite Man in the works and James Gunn&#39;s interest in producing DC spinoffs, Harley Quinn could fill the void for fans wanting more of the iconic character.  





With four successful seasons already under its belt, Kaley Cuoco offers a promising update on the Harley Quinn show&#39;s future amid the recent DC Universe reset. Cuoco leads the cast of the animated Max show as the titular DC villain-turned-antihero as she&#39;s left the Joker for good and set out to make her own path in Gotham City, including building her own criminal crew and forming a relationship with Poison Ivy. Being one of the only shows to survive the shuttering of the DC Universe streaming service, Harley Quinn has been a strong hit for both HBO Max and Max since the jump, garnering consistently rave reviews.




During an interview with Screen Rant for her Prime Video action-thriller Role Play, Cuoco opened up about her time working on Harley Quinn. The executive producer/star expressed her surprise at the show&#39;s longevity thus far and expressed her confidence in its ongoing future, confirming she&#39;ll continue to play the role &#34;as long as they want it.&#34; Check out what Cuoco said below:


Hell yeah, we do [incredible work]. We&#39;re already starting a new season, and that&#39;s been such fun. I don&#39;t even know how that happened, and it just keeps going and people love it. I love doing it, and people seem to just love it. So, it&#39;ll go on and on as long as they want it. I&#39;m here for it.



 Harley Quinn Can Spawn An Animated DC Franchise To Rival The DCU 
         

As James Gunn looks to build a more coherent franchise with his impending DCU reboot beginning with the animated Creature Commandos show and Superman: Legacy, the future of many extra DC projects like Harley Quinn have been left in question. Though Doom Patrol and Titans enjoyed similar success in their leaps between streamers, they recently came to an end, while The CW&#39;s Arrowverse has also officially closed its doors, with the network&#39;s sole DC property, Superman &amp; Lois, also set to end with season 4. With Harley Quinn getting renewed for season 5 in November 2023, it not only assured the show&#39;s future was safe, but could even lead to something bigger.




It was announced in mid-2022 that a spinoff of the animated show centered on Kite Man was in the works for Max, with Matt Oberg reprising the role of the bizarre DC supervillain. A teaser released for the show around the time of Harley Quinn&#39;s renewal confirmed that Kite Man: Hell Yeah! would premiere sometime in 2024, with the mainline show also expected to return at an unknown point in the year. Though a seemingly humorous and self-contained expansion of its predecessor, should Kite Man become a similar hit for Max, it could lead to the creation of an animated DC franchise at the streamer to rival Gunn&#39;s DCU.

                  Harley Quinn: 8 Characters That Should Get Their Own Spin-Off Like Kite-Man   Following the announcement that Kite Man is getting his own spin-off series, here are eight other characters that deserve their own too.    

The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker filmmaker has already confirmed his interest in producing DC Elseworlds titles for both the big and small screens, including the upcoming Joker: Folie à Deux and The Batman — Part II, leaving the door open for him to collaborate with the creative team behind Harley Quinn for future spinoffs. Additionally, with Gunn recently confirming that there are no plans to recast Margot Robbie for the live-action Quinn, nor are there any current plans for her return, Cuoco&#39;s show could fill the void for DC fans to see more of the iconic character in future seasons.






The first four seasons of Harley Quinn are currently available to stream on Max.
