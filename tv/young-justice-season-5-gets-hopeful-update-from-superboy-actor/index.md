## Literature Review

Exclusive: Nolan North, who voices Conner Kent, a.k.a. Superboy on the DC show, offers a positive update on a potential Young Justice season 5.




Superboy voice actor Nolan North opens up on the possibility of Young Justice season 5, following the DC show&#39;s recent season. After the end of Young Justice: Phantoms (a.k.a. season 4), the world was left without a proper answer to whether or not this was the end of the DC animated series. With all the changes that have been happening at Warner Bros. Discovery concerning the DC properties, as they are getting ready for James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe, many have assumed Young Justice was done.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant, while promoting Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - Part One, Nolan, who voices multiple characters in the movie, was asked for an update about Young Justice season 5. While an official renewal for Young Justice season 5 hasn&#39;t happened, Nolan stressed that Young Justice has not been canceled, sharing the following:


Well, we have Warner Brothers people on the Zoom right now, I&#39;m telling you guys, we can do this. We can make another season. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not privy to that. I know it&#39;s a hit. I know fans want it desperately. I don&#39;t know, I wish I did. We were so fortunate to get [to do the first two] seasons and three and four. As you know, if you saw season four, Superboy had a big storyline in that and it was so much fun. I love Greg Weisman and Brandon Vietti, we just have so much fun. They&#39;re so passionate about their stories. So fingers crossed that something gets done. Maybe in the future. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s plans right now. But we always say we&#39;re not canceled, we just haven&#39;t been picked up yet. That&#39;s how I always feel about this show. So nobody&#39;s ever definitively said there will no longer be any [more] Young Justice. Now, if tomorrow, they put that article out there, it&#39;s our fault you understand that right? [laughs]

 Everything We Know About Young Justice Season 5 
         

At the end of the Young Justice: Phantoms finale, the show once again featured Darkseid, who has been built up over the last few seasons. As he got two new Female Furies, one of them ended up being none other than Kara Zor-El, a.k.a. Supergirl, Superman&#39;s famous cousin. While it was never stated, Young Justice season 5 would most likely have been the season where Darkseid finally takes on the role as a big bad.

Young Justice season 5 would also explore Mary Marvel&#39;s further descent into darkness, as she was the other new Female Fury to join Darkseid&#39;s elite. Outside of the Darkseid angle, very little is known about Young Justice season 5, as Weisman and Vietti have kept details closely under wraps. This is likely due to the fact that if Young Justice season 5 gets picked up, they wouldn&#39;t want too many spoilers to be out there already.




It would be ideal to see Young Justice season 5 happen, if only so they can give the show a proper ending. Young Justice has always been one of the most beloved shows when it comes to DC in animation, and given its cancelation history, it would be a shame to see them go through another cancelation after what happened on Cartoon Network. But for now, the world will have to wait and see if Young Justice season 5 will ever happen.

Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - Part One is on Blu-Ray/DVD, as well as available for purchase on Digital Download.
