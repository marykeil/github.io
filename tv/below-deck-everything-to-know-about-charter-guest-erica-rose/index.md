## Literature Review
Erica Rose made a splash as a Below Deck Sailing Yacht charter guest. Learn more about her life before the popular nautical reality show.




Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 2 introduced charter guest Erica Rose, and it&#39;s time to learn more about her. She joined the Parsafil crew alongside several friends to enjoy a mini-getaway in Croatia. However, the crew was getting annoyed with her and her friends, as they were more demanding than the crew expected. Second stewardess Dani even had to give one of the guests a massage because she felt stressed out due to being on a yacht 24/7, surrounded by her friends. As fans await Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 5, previous charter guests should be revisited.




Before Erica and her group of girlfriends joined the yacht, seasoned captain Glenn Shephard and the rest of the crew were unsure if they would go through with the charter after crashing the boat twice. While Captain Glenn was parking the yacht by the dock, a mechanical error occurred that short-circuited the thrusters. This caused him to crash into the pier. Luckily, no one was hurt, but a significant amount of cosmetic damage was done to the back of the boat. However, Erica Rose and her friends were able to board the Parsifal. The drama on Below Deck Sailing Yacht is just one of the reasons all the shows in the franchise are some of the best reality TV shows.


 Erica Rose Was On The Bachelor 
          

Before Erica Rose was known as the second to last charter guest on Below Deck Sailing Yacht, she was known as a contestant on The Bachelor. Erica competed on The Bachelor season 9 in 2006. Prince Lorenzo Borghese was the leading man during that season. The lawyer exited the limo wearing a bejeweled tiara to prove to the Prince that she was ready to become his princess. However, Erica was not destined to be his princess, as she was eliminated after three weeks. Soon after being eliminated, Erica appeared on the first season of the VH1 reality series You&#39;re Cut Off! and later starred in two seasons of the now-canceled The Bachelor spin-off, Bachelor Pad (via Distractify).






 Erica Rose Is A Lawyer 
          

Since her early days as a reality star, Erica has started a family and grown her career as a lawyer. After she left The Bachelor, she attended the University of Houston Law Center for four years and later obtained her Master&#39;s Degree in Entertainment Law from Southwestern Law School. Erica and her now-husband, Charles Sanders, are partners at the Rose Sanders Law Firm PLLC. Before she found love with Charles, she was engaged to fellow lawyer Galen Gentry. They welcomed a daughter, Holland Rose Madelaine Gentry, born in September 2016. After she married Charles in 2017, the couple welcomed their daughter, Aspen Rose Sanders.

Erica may have moved on from her The Bachelor days, but she still enjoys being on camera. Her time on Below Deck Sailing Yacht may have ended, but she and her friends made quite an impression on the show. Hopefully, there will be equally exciting games in seasons to come.
