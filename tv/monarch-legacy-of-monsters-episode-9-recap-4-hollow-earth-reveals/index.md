## Literature Review
The twists and turns in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 contributed some unexpected additions to the Monsterverse&#39;s Hollow Earth lore.




Summary
 Monarch launched a secret Hollow Earth mission in 1962, revealing their involvement in Operation Hourglass. 
 Monarch lost government support due to the disastrous result of Operation Hourglass, leading to their weak state in Kong: Skull Island. 
 Lee Shaw disappeared for 20 years in the Hollow Earth, explaining his age difference, and Keiko Randa has been alive in the Hollow Earth for 53 years. 


Easily among the most eventful entries in the series yet, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 was filled with major developments ahead of the season finale. The penultimate episode delivered on the game-changing tease promised by episode 8&#39;s cliffhanger ending, which saw three of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; main characters descend into the Hollow Earth. Lee Shaw&#39;s attempt to close the rift in Kazahstan had ended in a disaster that set up an expected escapade into the world of the Monsterverse Titans.
What May, Shaw, and Cate encountered in the hidden, underground world first glimpsed in Godzilla vs. Kong offered interesting insight into the inner-workings of the Hollow Earth. In addition to that, episode 9 finally circled back to the tragedy shown in the series premiere&#39;s ending, which showed Keiko Randa seemingly meeting her end in Kazakhstan. Exploring the aftermath of that incident through a series of flashbacks to 1962 was equally illuminating, as this storyline answered a handful of lingering questions. Based on the importance of its reveals, there&#39;s a chance some of these will factor into the Monsterverse&#39;s future.









 








 8  Monarch Launched A Secret Hollow Earth Mission In 1962 
        

11 years before the government sanctioned an expedition to Skull Island to investigate Houston Brooks&#39; Hollow Earth theory, Monarch launched a mission to explore the Titans&#39; underground domain. The flashback story in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 confirmed that the government and Monarch worked together to orchestrate Operation Hourglass, which was designed to send a team down into a Hollow Earth tunnel found in Kansas. According to General Puckett, Dr. Suzuki (the scientist who had previously developed a method to call Titans) figured out a supposedly safe way to bypass the rifts in the Hollow Earth tunnels, allowing a team to explore the secret region.





 7  Monarch Lost The Government&#39;s Support Because Of Operation Hourglass 
        

While the vessel invented to make the trip to the Hollow Earth did wind up making it to the hidden world, the operation was a catastrophe nonetheless. The Titan they summoned - the Monsterverse&#39;s Ion Dragon - caused great destruction, leading to many deaths. Lee Shaw was the only surviving member of the team lost in the Hollow Earth. A scene with General Puckett and Bill Randa revealed as a result of what happened, and Monarch&#39;s failure to figure out exactly what went wrong, the government cut off its funding to the organization. This explains why Monarch was so weak at the start of Kong: Skull Island, which was set in 1973.





 6  Lee Shaw Disappeared For 20 Years In The Monsterverse Timeline 
        

New rules about time in the Hollow Earth turned out to be the explanation for one of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; biggest mysteries, which was Lee Shaw&#39;s age. The characters in the show have openly acknowledged the fact that Kurt Russell&#39;s character has the appearance of a man in his 70s, despite being closer to 90. It was discovered in episode 9 that Shaw was stranded in the Hollow Earth world for 20 years after crash-landing there during Operation Hourglass. For him, he was only there for a short time, but when he returned to the surface, it was already 1982. 20 years had passed, yet he hadn&#39;t aged a day.





 5  Keiko Randa Has Been Alive In The Hollow Earth For 53 Years 
        

Lee Shaw wasn&#39;t the only one to have his life turned upside down by the Hollow Earth&#39;s time rules. At the end of the episode, Cate was rescued from a monster by a bow-wielding Keiko Randa. The surprise reveal that the wife of Bill Randa and grandmother to the Randa kids is still alive has yet to be explained, but previous events paint a picture of what happened. It would seem that after falling through the Hollow Earth entrance in 1959, Keiko landed in the Titan realm and has managed to survive on her own.
In other words, she&#39;s been there for 53 years, possibly unaware of all that&#39;s occurred in her long absence. As for how long it&#39;s felt like for her, that remains to be seen. But based on her unchanged appearance, it looks like she hasn&#39;t been there for more than a few years - if that long. Regardless of how much she knows about her situation right now in 2015, what going to the Hollow Earth has done to both her and Kurt Russell&#39;s Lee Shaw speaks volumes about the dangers of stepping into Godzilla&#39;s world. It underscores the idea that the boundary between the Hollow Earth and the surface is one that shouldn&#39;t be crossed.





 4  There Are At Least Two Ways For Humans To Enter The Hollow Earth World 
        

It&#39;s been known since Godzilla vs. Kong that humans aren&#39;t able to easily get through these portal-like barriers in the tunnels. Monarch failed to cross over until a special aircraft created by APEX gave them the means to overcome the gravitational incursion. Interestingly, it&#39;s now known that humans had a way of getting down there long before the 2021 movie. In 1962, Monarch had concluded that if a Titan passed through the Hollow Earth rift, the portal would briefly become stabilized, allowing humans to follow the monster through.





 3  The Hollow Earth Is Composed Of Different Realms 
        

While trekking through the Hollow Earth with May in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9, Lee Shaw remarked that this place is comprised of different &#34;realms.&#34; This accounts for the distinct visual difference between the wooded region featured in the episode and the area seen in Godzilla vs. Kong. This reveal creates the expectation for each Hollow Earth voyage in the Monsterverse to stand apart from the rest. This allows the Monsterverse to build individual, unique worlds in the various corners of the Hollow Earth, with all of them complete with their own ecosystems, wildlife, and rules.





 2  How Time Works In The Hollow Earth 
        

Perhaps the most important reveal in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 is the one concerning time. Lee Shaw&#39;s experience with Operation Hourglass in 1962 revealed the devastating truth about the Hollow Earth: time works differently there. The amount of time that passes by while one is in the Hollow Earth isn&#39;t equal to the time that transpires on the surface.
It was for this reason that Shaw was insistent on the characters finding a way out as soon as possible. While they could be there for mere hours, months - if not years - could go by in the world above. This is a massive development that could shape the story of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, considering that the Hollow Earth is likely to play a fundamental role in the movie. Unless this aspect of the Hollow Earth applies only to the &#34;realm&#34; explored in the episode, it could pose a challenge to the upcoming sequel. That could be the case, especially since it seemingly had no effect on the story in Godzilla vs. Kong.





 1  Mysterious Boar Monsters Live In The Hollow Earth 
        

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9&#39;s ending added a new monster to the lineup of creatures confirmed to exist within the Hollow Earth world. A strange-looking boar creature with bone-like appendages on his back, comparable in size to most of the animals that lived on Skull Island, cautiously approached Cate. At first, it seemed somewhat peaceful, but it wound up attacking Cate nonetheless.
