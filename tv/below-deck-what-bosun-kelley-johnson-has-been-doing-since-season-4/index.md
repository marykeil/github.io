## Literature Review
Kelley Johnson was featured on two seasons of Below Deck on the exterior team. Find out if he still works in yachting.




Kelley Johnson was featured on two seasons of Below Deck working on the exterior team, but there&#39;s curiosity about what he&#39;s been doing since appearing on the show. The former reality star was first seen on Below Deck season 2 as a deckhand. Captain Lee Rosbach was impressed with Kelley as a deckhand and decided to promote him to bosun. Today, Kelley is still involved in the yachting industry. As fans await Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to revisit Kelley&#39;s time on the hit Bravo series.




When Kelley first joined Below Deck, he was pretty new to the yachting industry. Even though Kelley had experience in the Marine Corps, he was still learning the ropes on a yacht during season two. However, he greatly improved his skills within two years, and Captain Lee was happy to invite him to Valor as his bosun. Although Kelley and Captain Lee may have butted heads while working together the second time around, Kelley is still someone Lee would work alongside again.


 Kelley Is A Captain After Below Deck 

 

Since leaving Valor at the end of season four, the 36-year-old has increased in the yachting industry ranks. Kelley now lives in Fort Lauderdale and works full-time as a captain. However, his career as a captain only started after 2020. During an interview with BravoTV, Kelley&#39;s sister, Amy, revealed Kelley decided to become a captain during the pandemic. Before that, Kelley was working as an emotional support advocate for individuals who may be struggling with anxiety or depression (via Showbiz Cheat Sheet). He even had a YouTube channel called The Military Guy, where Kelley would post self-help videos, practical ways to manage lifeâ€™s stresses, and all his travel destinations.






 Kelley Is Also A Photographer Post-Below Deck 

 

Kelley has since moved on from self-help and is focusing on being a captain and his new side gig. After Kelley finished season four of Below Deck, he dabbled in videography and photography. Before becoming a full-time captain, Kelley built his photography portfolio, hoping to do the job full-time. While he may work as a captain now, Kelley is still passionate about photography and always uploads his work to Instagram. His work consists of scenic views such as mountains, the ocean, the open road, and so much more. Kelley can use his love for travel in his work as a captain and in photography.

Now that Kelley is a captain, fans will unlikely see him on Below Deck for a third time. The former cast member is also married to Nicole Viljoen Johnson and seems settled into his life as a married man. He focuses on being the best captain and creating great content with his photography skills. He&#39;s unlikely to return to the Bravo series since he&#39;s established in his career and personal life.
