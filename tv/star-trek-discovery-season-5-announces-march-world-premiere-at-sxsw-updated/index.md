Star Trek: Discovery will premiere its fifth and final season in March at SXSW. After a long delay resulting from the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Paramount&#43; previously announced that Star Trek: Discovery season 5 will premiere on the streaming service in April 2024. Discovery season 5 is the flagship Star Trek on Paramount&#43; series&#39; final season following the show&#39;s surprise cancelation in March 2023. This means Discovery season 5 will premiere one year after Paramount&#43; announced the end of Captain Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) and the USS Discovery&#39;s 32nd-century voyages.

Star Trek on Paramount&#43;&#39;s official Instagram account (@startrekonpplus) announced that Star Trek: Discovery season 5 will have its world premiere in March at SXSW. The South by Southwest Conference and Festivals takes place in Austin, Texas on March 8-16, 2024. Star Trek: Discovery season 5 will be part of SXSW&#39;s TV Spotlight event, with screening info TBA.

A synopsis of Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s season 5 premiere has been released. Discovery season 5, episode 1 is titled &#34;Red Directive&#34; and it&#39;s written by showrunner Michelle Paradise. Check out the description below:



Captain Burnham &amp; the Discovery are sent to retrieve a mysterious 800 year-old Romulan vessel; until the artifact hidden inside is stolen, leading to an epic chase. Meanwhile, Saru is offered the position of a lifetime, and Tillyâ€™s efforts to help pull her into a tangled web of secrecy.



Fascinating clues are contained in the description. An 800-year-old Romulan vessel has the secret treasure that is Star Trek: Discovery season 5&#39;s Macguffin. Captain Saru may be offered a new starship command or some greater honor by Starfleet. Could Tilly&#39;s &#34;tangled web of secrecy&#34; connect to the Star Trek: Section 31 movie starring Academy Award-winner Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Phillipa Georgiou?




                  Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 - Episode Titles For Final Season Revealed   Star Trek: Discovery only has 10 episodes left, and the titles for each season 5 episode, which is also the final season, have been revealed.    


 What To Expect From Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 
A hunt for the greatest treasure in the known galaxy.
         

Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s creative team and cast didn&#39;t expect season 5 to be the final season, and the upcoming 10 episodes of the series were designed with an Indiana Jones-style adventure in mind. Star Trek: Discovery season 5 is a hunt for &#34;the greatest treasure in the known galaxy&#34;, said to be an ancient power that has been dormant for centuries. Captain Michael Burnham and the USS Discovery will compete with new aliens, including mercenaries L&#39;ak (Elias Toufexis) and Moll (Eve Harlow), for the prize, and Burnham must also contend with Starfleet Captain Rayner (Callum Keith Rennie), who is no fan of Michael&#39;s.




Following the announcement of Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s cancelation, reshoots were held in spring 2023 before the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes to turn Discovery&#39;s season 5 finale into an ending for the entire series. Jonathan Frakes directed the first half of Discovery&#39;s two-part ending, episode 9, &#34;Lagrange Point,&#34; while Olatunde Osunsanmi helmed Discovery&#39;s final episode (and the reshoots), titled &#34;Life, Itself,&#34; As the only live-action Star Trek series in 2024, Star Trek: Discovery is the biggest Star Trek on Paramount&#43; event of the year, and the lucky audience at SXSW will be the first to see the world premiere episode of Star Trek: Discovery season 5.



Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 premieres in April on Paramount&#43;.
