# Kurt Russell s Monarch Legacy of Monsters Season 1 Arc &amp; Potential Season 2 Return Addressed By Monsterverse Showrunner


## SUMMARY 



  Showrunner Chris Black believes that Kurt Russell&#39;s character, Lee Shaw, had a satisfying conclusion to his story in the season 1 finale of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.   Despite this, Black leaves room for Lee to potentially return in season 2 and expresses a desire to reunite with the original cast if the show is renewed.

Despite this, Black leaves room for Lee to potentially return in season 2 and expresses a desire to reunite with the original cast if the show is renewed.

Following the emotional events of the latest episode, showrunner Chris Black weighs in on Kurt Russell&#39;s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 arc and his potential season 2 return. Russell starred in the Monsterverse show as Lee Shaw, one of the co-founders of the titular organization who struggled to find a balance between the world of the Army he knew and that of the monster-studying Keiko and Bill Randa introduced him to. After being reunited with Keiko in Hollow Earth, Lee sacrifices himself to allow her, Cate and May to successfully escape back to the world, with the group returning after two years have passed.

In honor of its premiere, Screen Rant interviewed Black to break down Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 10. When asked about Lee&#39;s fate in the season 1 finale and potential return in a season 2, the showrunner expressed the feeling that Russell&#39;s story reached a &#34;satisfying conclusion&#34; with his seeming demise, though teased that &#34;there&#39;s always room&#34; and sharing his hopes to reunite with as much of the original cast should the show be renewed. Check out what Black shared below:





I always think there&#39;s more to tell. You’ve now seen the final episode; I think it&#39;s a very satisfying conclusion to his story. It feels like he started the season with a very specific mission that kind of haunted him over the decades. Then, at the end of the season, he gets an opportunity to go back and revisit what he considers to be the mistakes he made, and accomplish his mission. I think we all agree internally [that] it feels complete; that story feels complete.
That said, there&#39;s always room. Those actors were so great. They&#39;re so great to work with. They anchor the show in the two timelines. We do not have an official pickup for a second season, but we&#39;re always thinking of ideas. We’d love to have as much of our original crew back to tell more stories as we could.



 Could Russell&#39;s Lee Return For Monarch Season 2 (&amp; Should He)? 
         




The final few episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters dropped some of the biggest bombshells on Russell&#39;s character in the present day timeline. Between the reveal of his mysterious age stemming from a slower progression of time in Hollow Earth to reuniting with Keiko after believing her to be dead for over 50 years, the charming-yet-jaded character was forced to confront much of his past and his actions as he had to find a way to save Cate, May and Keiko from being stuck in Hollow Earth. His being willing to trade his escape for Keiko&#39;s further cemented his arc completing as he pushed her to help Monarch get back to the benevolent roots the two and Bill Randa wanted for the organization.

While Black indicates that Lee&#39;s story was &#34;complete&#34; by the end of season 1, there is plenty of room for Lee to return in the potential Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2. Keiko&#39;s fate was seemingly much more dire as she was dragged down into the Kazakhstan power plant by freshly born Endoswarmers, and yet episodes 9 and 10 not only confirmed she had survived, but had even figured out a way to signal to the outside world for help. Though the fall from the pod might have been high enough and fast enough to kill him, his overall resilience could result in season 2 finding Shaw still alive and stranded in Hollow Earth.




More than just the emotional nature of his ending, however, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 bringing back Russell&#39;s Shaw could result in some issues for the overall timeline of the Monsterverse. Keiko, May and Cate&#39;s emergence didn&#39;t come until two years after they were thought to be lost, despite being stuck down there for a week, and with a return to Hollow Earth not having happened until Apex&#39;s expedition in Godzilla vs. Kong in 2024, it would have to be explained in The New Empire or the 2017 timeline of Monarch season 2 that Apex had begun trips down to Hollow Earth prior, and subsequently came across Shaw.
