## Literature Review
Known for being in Stranger Things, Joe Keery played a dark villain in season 5 of Fargo which serves as a reminder to watch a great horror film.




Joe Keery&#39;s dark role in season 5 of Fargo serves as a reminder to watch a great horror film that was released four years ago. Before obtaining his big break on Stranger Things, Keery appeared in a number of commercials and had smaller roles in popular television shows like Empire and Chicago Fire. After landing the role of Steve Harrington in Stranger Things, Keery&#39;s career has been on an upward trajectory. He has managed to carve out a name for himself and establish himself as a young actor to watch.




When thinking of Keery, many may think of someone who is best at playing light-hearted and goofy characters. His recent role as Gator Tilman as Fargo challenges this notion, though, and proves how well-rounded of an actor he truly is. Tilman is a charmer who is desperate to prove himself to his sheriff father, regardless of what that takes. One of the most dangerous parts of the character is his misguided pride despite his incompetence and the way nepotism emboldens him to have little regard for other people.

                  Who Plays Linda In Fargo Season 5   Season 5 of FX&#39;s TV show Fargo introduces viewers to an important character named Linda, who is played by a seasoned and talented actress.     


 Before Joe Keery Played A Villain In Fargo Season 5, He Played A Dangerous Influencer In Spree 
          

Joe Keery did an excellent job playing the dangerous Gator Tillman in Fargo, which makes sense when considering he&#39;s played a villain before. Keery starred in Spree, a 2020 American satirical horror film that follows a rideshare driver who live streams himself murdering passengers. Keery plays the murderous and virality-obsessed rideshare driver and was praised for his performance and ability to bring such a horrific character to life.




Though the movie is not incredibly well-known, it is an interesting and eye-opening take on modern times and the lengths people will go to for their &#34;five minutes of fame&#34;. Seeing Keery shed his lighthearted shell to reveal the ability to portray as dark of a character as Gator Tilman was captivating, and Spree delivers the same thing. Those who enjoyed Keery&#39;s performance should add Spree to their watchlist to witness him breathe life into another horrifying villain.



 Joe Keery&#39;s Next 2024 Project Will Be Much Different Than Past Movie &amp; TV Roles 
          

Keery is best known for his role as Steve Harrington in Stranger Things, but these villainous roles in Fargo and Spree proved the actor&#39;s range. This range will be proved once again, as Keery&#39;s next 2024 project will be significantly different than his past movie and television roles. Releasing in February 2024, audiences will have the chance to see Keery in a romantic heist film called Marmalade. The movie follows a man in prison who narrates the story of a romantic bank heist while trying to escape and reunite with the love of his life.
