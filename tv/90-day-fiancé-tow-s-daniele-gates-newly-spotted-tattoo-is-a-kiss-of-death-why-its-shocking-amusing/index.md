## Literature Review
Many 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way viewers are surprised to see Daniele Gates’ tattoo on her arm, which she might have to get rid of soon.




Daniele Gates from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way has many nice-looking tattoos, but one of them could become the worst mistake of her life. The single mom from New York debuted on the popular spin-off in 2022. At the time, she seemed compatible with her Dominican Republic beau, Yohan Geronimo, and married him without hesitation. Unfortunately, Daniele soon realized she and her husband weren’t the best pair. Yohan wanted Daniele to take him to the United States, but she feared he would probably dump her after getting his green card. The duo argued about many things throughout their journey with the franchise.




In 2023, Daniele and Yohan faced new issues on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. Daniele felt his wife didn’t respect him enough and expected her to give him a baby at the age of 43. Similarly, Daniele expected Yohan to step up and provide for their family, knowing he couldn’t. In the latest episode of the spin-off, Yohan opened up about how Daniele was supposed to give him a better life, but she didn’t keep her promise. He implied he was unhappy in the relationship and compared his marriage to a horror story.

 Daniele Has Yohan’s Name Tattooed On Her Arm 

 

Daniele’s social media posts hint that she isn’t content after marrying Yohan. She often takes shots at fans for siding with her husband and likes to call them out for hypocrisy. While Daniele regrets her marriage, there’s something else she may soon regret even more. Daniele has a massive tattoo of Yohan’s name on her arm. It is unclear when she got the tattoo, but it happened sometime after her stint on 90 Day Fiancé: Love in Paradise. The tattoo is also visible in her 44th birthday post.






 Daniele’s Marriage With Yohan Is In Shambles 

 

Recently, Reddit user KiefRichards666 shared a picture of Daniele’s tattoo, stating how bizarre it was. The Redditor noted it was a bad idea for her to get Yohan’s name tattooed on herself when she didn’t respect him or trust him. Daniele and Yohan no longer show romantic feelings or treat each other right. The couple had a blowout fight in episode 17 after Yohan took money from Daniele’s account without telling her. The situation led Daniele to get angry and kick Yohan out.



 Why Daniele Will Probably Have To Remove The Tattoo Soon 
          

Daniele and Yohan exposed themselves on TV while pretending to be the victims. Now, Daniele is stuck with Yohan’s name on her arm, which will forever remind her of her toxic marriage. She may get it removed but may not be able to overcome the scars. A Reddit user commented, “kiss of death just like in the housewives franchise.” Another one said, “she can re-tat it with Yahoo.” Someone recalled that Yohan had Daniele’s name tattooed on his chest, so both of them may have to get tattoos removed.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
