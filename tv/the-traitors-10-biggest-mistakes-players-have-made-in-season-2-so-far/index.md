## Literature Review
The Traitors UK season 2 is off to a great start, but plenty of mistakes have been made already. Here are the top ten.




The Traitors UK season 2 sees 22 contestants battle for Â£120,000 in a castle, but treachery lurks, and mistakes have already been made. The Traitors UK was so popular it spawned The Traitors US, making it one of the best reality TV shows. Among them lie hidden &#34;Traitors,&#34; secretly eliminating the innocent &#34;Faithfuls&#34; one by one. While The Traitors UK season 2 is just getting underway, it is much different than The Traitors UK season 1.
The Traitors UK season 2&#39;s cast varies in age, career, and background. While The Traitors have been chosen, there have been many twists and turns, leading to the faithfuls&#39; difficulty ascertaining which players are the traitors. It&#39;s been a decent game thus far, but plenty of mistakes have been made. Where have the contestants gone wrong thus far?









 








 1  Anthony Changing His Personality

Any shift in personality can cause suspicion, and Anthony learned that the hard way. While he started talkative and engaging, he became secretive and aloof, causing alarm among some contestants. Diane raised alarm bells regarding Anthony, but others were frustrated with him when he was unhelpful in the water due to his lack of aquatic skills. His shift was a big mistake because it made him look less faithful.





 2  Everyone Blindly Trusting Paul 


 







Paul is proving to be the best traitor, as he&#39;s consistently popular with the group, stays quiet at the correct times, and speaks up when it helps his fellow traitors. While there was one vote for Paul at the last banishment, it&#39;s clear he is not raising red flags among most of the group. The faithful will regret trusting Paul with their prize money.





 3  Zack&#39;s &#34;Sleep Well&#34; Comment 


 







Zack got so loud within the first three episodes that he put a giant target on his back. Between snagging shields for himself and commenting he would &#34;sleep well&#34; because of his shield, he consistently raised alarm bells. Interestingly, the focus shifted away from him in the third episode, with him becoming too obvious of a choice. Despite being faithful, he distracts from other potential traitors and hurts his cause.





 4  Sonja Stirring The Pot 
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  

Sonja stirred the pot too much for a contestant aligned with the faithful. She repeated conversations in secret and constantly accused others of being a traitor. While she claimed to use her social science background to her advantage, she distracted the other faithfuls from the real traitors by stirring the pot for no good reason and wasting a vote.





 5  Eliminating Sonja 
        

Unfortunately, Sonja was too outspoken in her attempts to deduce the traitors and looked suspect. Despite being faithful, she distracted from the actual traitors and got herself banished. It was a blatant mistake of the faithful to go for such an obvious player when traitors tend to fly under the radar if they&#39;re playing correctly.





 6  Diane And Anthony Making Enemies With Each Other

 7   
Diane mentioned in the first episode she would make a lousy traitor because of her inability to be disingenuous, but her honesty hasn&#39;t done her any favors. While she immediately accused Harry of being a potential traitor, she focused too much on Anthony because he wasn&#39;t nice to her. This changed the minds of a few faithful, distracting from the actual traitors.





 8  Kyra Being Too Outspoken 
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  

Kyra&#39;s elimination was unfortunate because she was an intelligent and likable player. Unfortunately, she was murdered by the traitors because she was an obvious threat to their game. Kyra acknowledged she could&#39;ve been less outspoken and flown under the radar more, but it wouldn&#39;t have been her personality to do so. It would&#39;ve been exciting to see Kyra go further, as she likely could have figured out the traitors due to her cunning and intelligence.





 9  No One Realizing Diane And Ross Are Mother And Son

Diane was accused of being related to someone in the show, but it wasn&#39;t Ross. The pair looks alike, and Diane has been going for everyone except Ross. Ross has proven to be an uninteresting player thus far in comparison to his mother. If the others could figure out Diane and Ross were mother and son, it could significantly help their game.





 10  Voting Paul As Popular 
        






 11   
The group choosing Paul as the most popular player shows how far they are from picking out the traitors and solidifying his standing as a well-liked group member. The faithfuls are too fixated on obvious giveaways from Anthony, Sonja, and Zack to notice the most likable players are simply using them to get ahead as traitors. Trusting Paul is a big mistake.





 12  Ash Acting Suspicious 
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  






 13   
The weakest link of the traitors is Ash, and the rest of her fellow traitors are aware. During the round table of episode 3, Ash&#39;s shifty behavior was proven to have garnered attention from many of the faithfuls. Intelligently, Harry and Paul choose to turn on Ash in the final vote, distancing themselves from their weakest link. However, her gameplay was a big mistake and could not help the faithfuls win.





 14  The Faithful Turning On Brian And Diane 
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  

While it&#39;s unclear which contestant will be eliminated, Brian and Diane distract from the real traitor: Ash. Diane has been too open with her opinions, putting an immediate target on her back. However, Brian seems to be a victim of herd mentality rather than genuine reasoning. He looks baffled at the accusation. Ash is extraordinarily flustered at the accusation, and it&#39;s unclear whether she will live to fight another day for the traitors. While some intelligent gameplay has occurred, the cast of The Traitors UK season 2 still has a lot to learn.
The Traitors UK airs Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Friday nights at 9 p.m. GMT on BBC.
