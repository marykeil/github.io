## Literature Review
Brayden Bowers from Bachelor in Paradise has an interesting personality, but his fun persona doesn’t make him worthy to be a lead on The Bachelor.




Bachelor in Paradise star Brayden Bowers doesn’t deserve to be The Bachelor lead in the future. The 25-year-old is a travel nurse who first left a mark on fans during his journey on The Bachelorette season 20. During the season, he tried his luck with Charity Lawson but couldn’t win her over. While Brayden managed to leave a good impression and got the first rose, he didn’t impress her enough to give him her final rose. He quit the show in week four and decided to part ways with Charity. 




Despite his villain edit, he still appeared on Bachelor in Paradise season 9, which premiered in September 2023. Upon returning, the San Diego resident tried his luck with co-star Kat Izzo. His connection with her made sense since she was also a nurse. Unfortunately, Kat left Brayden for Tanner Courtad. Brayden then moved on with Rachel Recchia but ditched her to be with Becca Serrano. However, Becca self-eliminated herself, pushing Brayden to move onto Olivia Lewis, which didn’t work out either. Brayden’s lack of commitment to the ladies led to his elimination at the next rose ceremony. Does Brayden deserve to be The Bachelor or not?

 Brayden Bowers Isn’t Looking For Commitment 
          




Brayden isn&#39;t the best pick for a future Bachelor season because he’s not mature enough. Marriage is a serious step, and it seems Brayden would rather have fun with the ladies than find a soulmate. In one of the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 episodes, Brayden had a date with Rachel, where he painted her body. He turned what could’ve been a meaningful date into an activity, making the date all about having a good time. Brayden doesn’t realize that the goal of BIP is to have serious conversations about life, which will lead him to find a good partner, not for a good time.



 Brayden Has Past Relationship Trauma 
          

Any Bachelor lead should have a confident personality and the desire to be a good husband. However, Brayden still struggles with past relationship traumas, which ruined his connection with Charity. During The Bachelorette season 20, he was worried about falling in love with Charity because he wasn&#39;t fully healed from his last breakup. He felt Charity wanted him to move too fast, which wasn’t an ideal scenario for him. Brayden has previously been in love, which has left a traumatic effect on him. He needs a slow and steady relationship and not a quick reality TV romance.






 Brayden Bowers Doesn’t Agree With The Format Of The Show 
          

Brayden shouldn’t be The Bachelor because he is uncomfortable with the show’s concept. Earlier, he explained how it wasn’t ideal for The Bachelorette lead to try out 25 different men before her engagement. It probably didn’t sound too romantic, loving, and genuine to him. Since Brayden feels relationships form over time, he isn’t the type of person who would want to settle down with someone after a few weeks. Even if the Bachelor in Paradise star appears on the show, he probably won’t be able to fall in love or get engaged at the end.



Bachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on ABC.
