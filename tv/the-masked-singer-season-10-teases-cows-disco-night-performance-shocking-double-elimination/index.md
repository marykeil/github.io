## Literature Review
The Masked Singer Group A finals will take place on Disco Night. Here&#39;s a sneak peek, including Cow&#39;s epic performance and a double elimination.




The Masked Singer season 10 Group A finals will take place on Disco Night, and there are many surprises in store for this groovy episode. As The Masked Singer season 10 finals get underway, all 16 contestants have performed. Now the three finalists from Groups A, B, and C, will sing for host Nick Cannon, the panelists--Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger--and the audience. The finalists from Group A (Gazelle, S&#39;More, Cow), Group B (Tiki, Husky, Sea Queen), and Group C (Donut, Candelabra, Anteater), will compete within their groups in order to earn a spot in the finale.




In a teaser for The Masked Singer season 10 Disco Night (shared by Masked Clips via YouTube), Nick announces, &#34;The Masked Singer is taking you to Funky Town!&#34; 


 

A voiceover then states, &#34;It&#39;s the first group final!&#34; A short clip of Cow&#39;s stellar performance of Anita Ward&#39;s disco classic, &#34;Ring My Bell,&#34; is then shown. The voiceover then teases a &#34;shocking double elimination,&#34; as Jenny says, &#34;Oh my God!,&#34; and Ken looks down sadly.


 The Masked Singer Ding Dong Keep It On Bell Returns 
          

Although The Masked Singer season 10 Disco Night preview teases a double elimination, the panelists have a new option for the finals - The Ding Dong Keep It On Bell. The bell was introduced in season 9 as a way for the panelists to save contestants from elimination. However, during that season, it was used during the group rounds, rather than the finals. According to EW, for season 10, the bell can only be used after one Battle Royale during the group finals. This means that the panelists can only save one singer from elimination. Because of this, the finale will consist of four finalists: one from each group and one saved by the bell.




The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Group A finalists, Gazelle, S&#39;More, and Cow, are three of the best singers in the competition. They&#39;ve wowed everyone with their incredible performances. All of them deserve a place in the finale, but, if the preview is telling the truth, two of them will be unmasked on Disco Night. The panelists might&#39;ve thought that it was too early to use the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell for the first group, and so they saved it for Group B or C. Whatever they decided, Disco Night is certain to be an out-of-sight night of music and entertainment.

So far, many iconic stars have been unmasked on The Masked Singer season 10, including Anthony Anderson (Rubber Ducky), Tom Sandoval (Diver), Michael Rapaport (Pickle), Billie Jean King (Royal Hen), Tyler Posey (Hawk), Luann de Lesseps (Hibiscus), and Metta World Peace (Cuddle Monster). In addition, superstar singer Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse in a special unmasking during The Masked Singer season 10 premiere. Group A&#39;s Disco Night will add one or two more legendary stars to this list. The Masked Singer season 10 is one of the best yet.




The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
