  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Swamp People is back for season 15. Here&rsquo;s a guide to the cast for the anticipated reality TV show, featuring old and new faces.</p>
<p>Swamp People is returning for season 15, and here&rsquo;s a guide to the cast for the show. While sometimes considered one of the worst History Channel reality TV shows, the program following the lives of alligator hunters in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana remains a popular reality TV show. The show documents the hunters&rsquo; traditional alligator hunting methods and the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives. Some of what happens on Swamp People is fake, but it&rsquo;s one of the real TV shows on the History Channel.</p>
<p>Swamp People may not be one of the most anticipated reality TV shows of 2024, but it is one of the first to return, garnering interest in the new season and cast. The History Channel show has been on the air for 14 seasons and is one of the network&rsquo;s most popular shows. It has been praised for its portrayal of the unique culture of the Atchafalaya Basin and for its suspenseful alligator hunts. While there are some returning cast members, there are also new faces in the latest installment.</p>

<p>Nicknamed the &ldquo;King of the Swamp,&rdquo; Troy is a renowned alligator hunter and star of Swamp People. He&rsquo;s known for his larger-than-life personality and his no-nonsense approach to hunting. The show&rsquo;s core revolves around alligator hunting during the 30-day Louisiana season, and the Landry family is often at the center. Various teams of swampers are followed as they employ traditional methods and strategies to catch as many gators as possible within the legal limit. Troy is always at the forefront of navigating the treacherous swamp waters, setting traps, wrestling gators, and facing the constant threat of injury.</p>
<p>Jacob Landry</p>
<p>As Troy&rsquo;s son and heir to the Landry family&rsquo;s alligator-hunting legacy, Jacob is a skilled hunter in his own right, learning the ropes from his father. Because of their close ties, family and community play a significant role in the swampers&rsquo; lives and the themes of Swamp People.
