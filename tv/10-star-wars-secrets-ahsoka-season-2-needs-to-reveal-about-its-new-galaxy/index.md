## Literature Review

Ahsoka season 1 promised further exploration of Peridea and Star Wars’ second galaxy, with season 2 of the show positioned to answer many questions.




Ahsoka season 2 is primed to answer several mysteries about Peridea, Star Wars&#39; second galaxy, and the secrets both hold. Ahsoka season 1&#39;s ending promised an intriguing story for the continuation of the show with the titular Jedi and her Padawan - Sabine Wren - stranded in another galaxy. Despite failing to stop Star Wars&#39; Grand Admiral Thrawn from returning to the core galaxy, the future certainly looks interesting for Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice.
While Thrawn&#39;s resurgence is sure to be explored in other upcoming Star Wars TV shows, Ahsoka&#39;s story seems to be taking a different direction. The threat of Baylan Skoll and the links Perdiea has to ancient gods of the Star Wars galaxy position Ahsoka Tano&#39;s future as one that will be consequential to the entire franchise. Therefore, Ahsoka season 2&#39;s story has several questions it needs to answer about Peridea and the galaxy to which the planet belongs.









 








 10  What Is Peridea&#39;s Connection To The Mortis Gods? 
The Mortis Gods have a hold on Star Wars&#39; second galaxy.
        

Undoubtedly the most compelling, exciting teases in Ahsoka season 1&#39;s finale were the connections Peridea has to the Mortis Gods. The ending of the season saw Baylan Skoll standing atop giant statues depicting the Father, the Son, and the Daughter from Star Wars: The Clone Wars. These three beings are deities in the Star Wars galaxy that represent the three different sides of the Force. The Father represents balance, the Son represents darkness, and the Daughter represents light.
The Mortis arc in Star Wars: The Clone Wars was certainly one of the more interesting of the entire show due to its exploration of the Force, the Chosen One, and the gods themselves. Therefore, Ahsoka&#39;s inclusion of the Mortis Gods in an entirely different galaxy is overwhelmingly intriguing and promises big ramifications in Ahsoka season 2. Not only does the show need to answer the connection Peridea has to the Mortis Gods but also how the deities will affect the shape of the New Republic era and beyond.





 9  Why Were The Great Mothers Banished There? 
What is the true history of the Great Mothers?
        

While the Great Mothers supposedly originated in Peridea and traveled to the main Star Wars galaxy eons ago, one line in Ahsoka season 1 hints that they were banished back to Peridea. This line throws the entire storyline of the Great Mothers into doubt and creates one of the biggest mysteries about the three characters. Therefore, Ahsoka season 2 needs to answer what happened to the Great Mothers to cause them to end up back on Peridea.





 8  What Were Thrawn &amp; The Great Mothers Fleeing, According To Baylan? 
Baylan&#39;s knowledge spelled trouble for even the strongest members of Thrawn&#39;s team.
        

Linking back to Baylan Skoll&#39;s story, the Jedi-turned-anarchist tells his apprentice that Thrawn and the Great Mothers are leaving Peridea out of fear of something. Baylan says that something unseen is at work on Peridea and that its power outweighs that of Thrawn and the Nightsisters, hence their haste to return to the core Star Wars galaxy. This was one of the biggest teases in Ahsoka season 1 with the mystery of what Baylan was referring to needing to be answered in Ahsoka season 2.





 7  How Is Peridea’s Connection To The Force Different? 
Does the Force manifest differently in a different galaxy?
        

As alluded to, Ahsoka season 1 mentioned that the Nightsisters originally came from Peridea. Since then, this has been used as an explanation for the Nightsisters&#39; Magick. Magick has always been described as a different kind of Force power which is utilized solely by the Nightsisters. After Ahsoka season 1, the different style of the Force used by the Nightsisters could be because it stems from Peridea. Therefore, Ahsoka season 2 could explore how Peridea&#39;s connection to the Force is different from the main Star Wars galaxy.





 6  Does Perdiea’s Galaxy Hold Other Forms Of Life? 
How important could the other life forms of Peridea&#39;s galaxy become?
        

One of the most interesting elements of Ahsoka season 1 was the highlighting of different life forms shown on the planet of Peridea. From the Noti to the Howler mounts and the bandit raiders of the planet, Ahsoka season 1 showcased the alien creatures of Peridea perfectly. Therefore, Ahsoka season 2 has the opportunity to explore the life forms on other planets in Peridea&#39;s galaxy. This could lead to several possibilities from other planetary stories and potential threats to Ahsoka&#39;s cast of characters.

 5  How Will Baylan’s Goal Impact Both Star Wars Galaxies? 
Baylan&#39;s discovery could reshape the entire Star Wars franchise.
        

Baylan&#39;s quest was undoubtedly the most intriguing aspect of Ahsoka season 1, meaning season 2 has to explore how it could impact the two Star Wars galaxies. From theories that Baylan is searching for the Legends character of Abeloth/The Mother to any other mystical possibility within the realm of the Force, Baylan&#39;s storyline promises to have huge ramifications. With Ahsoka season 1 ending on a cliffhanger regarding Baylan, season 2 has to explore what the aforementioned ramifications could be on the Star Wars franchise.





 4  Does Star Wars’ Second Galaxy Have Other Groups Of Force Users? 
The main galaxy has several established Force groups, does Peridea align with this?
        

As has been established throughout Star Wars&#39; vast transmedia franchise since 1977, the core galaxy has multiple groups of Force users. From the Guardians of the Whills to the Jedi, Sith, and Nightsisters to name but a few, the Star Wars galaxy has several tribes that utilize the Force in a variety of ways. Concerning the second Star Wars galaxy that houses Peridea, it would be supremely interesting for Ahsoka season 2 to explore whether other groups of Force users exist beyond the Great Mothers.





 3  Is Peridea Really The Origin Of The Force? 
Peridea could prove to be integral to the origin of the Force.
        

During Baylan&#39;s storyline in Ahsoka season 1, the character mentioned that Peridea was the place where the cycle of light vs. dark began. This statement implies that the Force originated on Peridea, or at least the concept of the light side and the dark side. With Ahsoka season 2&#39;s further exploration of Baylan&#39;s journey, it would be a disappointment if the show did not further explore this line. If the Mortis Gods are further involved in Ahsoka season 2, it seems likely that exploring Peridea&#39;s place in the Force will happen.





 2  If Nightsisters Come From Another Galaxy - Do The Jedi As Well? 
What if the Jedi originated outside of Star Wars&#39; main galaxy?
        

Ahsoka season 1 insisted that the Nightsisters hailed from Peridea, begging the question of whether this was the case for other Force users. Given that the Force is known to exist beyond the reaches of Star Wars&#39; main galaxy, it would not be unbelievable to suggest the Jedi also come from another galaxy. This could be explored in Ahsoka season 2 and even tie into future movies that will explore the origins of the Jedi&#39;s connection with the Force.





 1  Are Howlers Native To Peridea, Or Was It Brought By Thrawn? 
The interesting mounts of Peridea may have been brought to the planet by the Grand Admiral.
        

Finally, the Howler creatures ridden by Sabine and other members of Thrawn&#39;s crew could provide an answer for a Peridea mystery in Ahsoka season 2. In Star Wars Legends, the Howlers are mentioned to be native to the core Star Wars galaxy. That said, Ahsoka season 1 seemed to imply they were native to Peridea. Therefore, Ahsoka season 2 could provide an answer either way: are the Howlers a native Peridean creature or did Thrawn somehow transport them there to help him escape?
