## Literature Review

The merits of these overlooked sci-fi movies are preserved in the witty, rich, and always entertaining reviews of legendary film critic, Roger Ebert.




Checking out overlooked sci-fi movies Roger Ebert loved is a good way to find obscure, forgotten, or underrated entertaining films. Ebert was largely regarded as the greatest film critic of all time, and much of this was due to his exemplary taste for quality movies. For decades, Ebert single-handedly dominated public perception on quite a number of films. At the same time, like any critic, Ebert&#39;s subjective points of view didn&#39;t always agree with most viewers&#39; experiences.
Indeed, there are terrible movies that Roger Ebert loved, and some of the films he didn&#39;t like have actually aged well. However, even though his reviews moved against the tide from time-to-time, Ebert&#39;s opinions held weight because of his sheer passion. Even if he hated certain movies, he made sure to also write about the reasons why others might enjoy them. This is why - although Ebert had no specific preferences in terms of genre - his review style aligned deeply with those who love science fiction. While Ebert&#39;s movie reviews weren&#39;t always agreeable, audiences and industry professionals alike consistently looked forward to his critical reading of new sci-fi worlds.
            
 
 10 Movies Roger Ebert Didnâ€™t Like That Actually Aged Really Well

 10  Cloud Atlas (2012) 
4 Stars
        

  Cloud Atlas  


  Release Date    October 26, 2012     Director    Tom Tykwer , Lilly Wachowski , Lana Wachowski     Cast    Tom Hanks , Halle Berry , Jim Broadbent , Hugo Weaving , Jim Sturgess , Doona Bae     Runtime    172minutes    


Roger Ebert praised Cloud Atlas for its ambitious narrative structure and visual spectacle, describing it as a daring cinematic experiment. Ebert appreciated Cloud Atlas&#39; interconnected storytelling and the actors&#39; versatile performances across different timelines and characters. While acknowledging its complexity, he also recognized that it can be challenging to follow. &#34;On my second viewing, I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections.&#34; Despite his reservations, Ebert called it &#34;a demonstration of the magical, dreamlike qualities of the cinema.&#34; Notably, Ebert also gave Cloud Atlas all coveted 4 stars, even though it was a box office disaster that&#39;s typically categorized alongside movies that are too complicated to enjoy.





 9  Dark City (1998) 
4 Stars


 







  Dark City  


  Release Date    February 27, 1998     Director    Alex Proyas     Cast    Rufus Sewell , William Hurt , Kiefer Sutherland , Jennifer Connelly , Ian Richardson     Runtime    100 minutes    


Although Dark City is a cult sci-fi movie with very little mainstream appeal, Roger Ebert commended director Alex Proyas for creating an immersive world that blended sci-fi and film noir. Impressed by Dark City&#39;s intricate plot and captivating visuals, he described it as &#34;not only a beautiful film but a generous one, which supplies rich depth and imagination and many more details than are really necessary to tell the story.&#34; While acknowledging the influence of other pivotal works, Ebert appreciated the film&#39;s unique take on existential themes and the nature of reality, and even noted how it accomplished what The Matrix also achieved but &#34;earlier and with more feeling.&#34;

 8  Total Recall (2012) 
3 Stars
        

Roger Ebert&#39;s review of the 2012 adaptation of Total Recall leaned towards criticism. He noted that Colin Farrell is objectively a better actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger - but also that &#34;Schwarzenegger is more of a movie presence and better suited for the role of a wounded bull stumbling around in the china shop of his memories.&#34; While recognizing the advancements in special effects, Ebert believed that the film ultimately fell short of expectations. At the same time, while Ebert said that the remake didn&#39;t resonate with him &#34;the way the 1990 film did,&#34; he still appreciated it as a successful and worthwhile Philip K. Dick adaptation that deserved 3 stars.





 7  The Andromeda Strain (1971) 
3 Stars
        

While it&#39;s one of the best Michael Crichton sci-fi movies, The Andromeda Strain remains one of the most overlooked entries in the genre. This didn&#39;t stop Roger Ebert from celebrating The Andromeda Strain&#39;s realism, production design, and its successful attempts &#34;to create a plausible environment&#34; for astronauts in deep space. At the same time, he felt that it lacked in terms of creating a more emotionally engaging experience due to its focus on scientific processes. Yet, Ebert also noted how The Andromeda Strain is a film with &#34;buried levels,&#34; urging viewers to look beyond the plot and engage with its interpretations of artificial intelligence and human dwellings in the future.





 6  Equilibrium (2002) 
3 Stars


 







Despite Roger Ebert&#39;s mixed feelings about Equilibrium, he saw it fit to confer the film with 3 full stars. Ebert noted the clear influence of other dystopian classics like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451, but suggested that Equilibrium didn&#39;t bring much new to the table. However, like many viewers, Ebert was impressed by the movie&#39;s visual aesthetics and stylistic action scenes. Though he had reservations about the movie, Ebert fully resonated with Equilibrium, particularly loving &#34;the sneaky way Kurt Wimmer&#39;s movie advances its philosophy in between gun battles.&#34; Overall, Ebert saw Equilibrium&#39;s &#34;pure kinetic energy&#34; as an appropriate vehicle for depicting socially relevant dystopia.

 5  Monsters (2010) 
3 1/2 Stars
        

Roger Ebert praised the ingenuity of Monsters despite its limited budget, acknowledging director Gareth Edwards for his dual role as both director and visual effects artist. Over a decade later, Ebert&#39;s observations on how Monsters tackled America&#39;s &#34;current border situation and the controversy over undocumented aliens&#34; - and wars &#34;where expensive and advanced aircraft are used to fire missiles at enemies who are mostly invisible&#34; - still remain relevant. While recognizing Monsters&#39; strengths, Ebert also pointed out its deliberate pacing, noting that some viewers might find it slow. However, he argued that the slower pace allowed for a deeper exploration of the characters and the world they inhabited.





 4  The Cell (2000) 
4 Stars
        

Considering the movie&#39;s less than stellar reputation, viewers may be surprised that Roger Ebert gave The Cell a 4-star review, and even called it &#34;one of the best films of the year.&#34; Aligning with contemporary film critics who argue why The Cell was ahead of its time, Ebert loved the movie not just for its wild and haunting visuals, but also because it&#39;s &#34;a story where we care about the characters; there&#39;s a lot at stake at the end, and we&#39;re involved.&#34; Whereas many found The Cell to be too pretentious when it came out, Ebert was impressed by the spectacular visualization of the film&#39;s mind-sharing tech and premise.





 3  Timecrimes (2009) 
3 Stars
        

Over the years, Timecrimes has received wildly mixed reviews, and among those to praised the movie&#39;s merits is Roger Ebert, although he did it in a way that properly pays tribute to this confusing time travel film. According to Ebert, Timecrimes is &#34;a temporal chess game with nudity, voyeurism and violence, which makes it more boring than most chess games but less boring than a lot of movies.&#34; Citing his personal love of time travel paradoxes, Ebert appreciated the film&#39;s ability to deliver suspense and complexity within the constraints of its budget, ultimately recommending it to those seeking complicated and thought-provoking science fiction.

 2  Titan A.E. (2000) 
3 1/2 Stars
        

When Titan A.E. first came out, Ebert lauded it as &#34;the animated space adventure I&#39;ve been hoping for--a film that uses the freedom of animation to visualize the strangeness of the universe in ways live action cannot duplicate, and then joins its vision to a rousing story.&#34; Indeed, though Ebert commented on the derivative nature of the plot and characters - particularly noting similarities with Star Wars and Starship Troopers - he also saw Titan A.E. as a huge step for animation overcoming the inherent limitations of live-action film. Overall, Ebert&#39;s review of Titan A.E. aligns with how the movie&#39;s resulting cult following regards its legacy in the sci-fi genre.





 1  Gattaca (1997) 
3 1/2 Stars


 







  Gattaca  


  Release Date    September 7, 1997     Director    Andrew Niccol     Cast    Ethan Hawke , Uma Thurman , Gore Vidal , Xander Berkeley , Jayne Brook , Loren Dean    


&#34;This is one of the smartest and most provocative of science fiction films,&#34; said Ebert in his review of Gattaca, noting how the film deftly revolves around the resulting class struggles from mass genetic engineering. He admired Gattaca&#39;s focus on suspense and character development, particularly the performances of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, as they navigated a society where a person&#39;s genetic makeup determined their success. Ebert favorably compared Gattaca to the classic sci-fi works of Orson Welles and King Vidal, citing the movie as an example of how the &#34;best of the genre deals with ideas&#34; rather than mere visual spectacle.
