Warning: This article contains spoilers for the Ted prequel show.




From Seth MacFarlane regulars like American Dad!’s Scott Grimes to newcomers like Euphoria’s Alanna Ubach, the cast of Peacock’s Ted prequel show is full of great actors, each bringing their own colorful character to life. Set in a Massachusetts suburb in 1993, the Ted prequel series goes back to Ted’s childhood as he attends school with his best friend John Bennett. Originally played by Mark Wahlberg in the movies, John is 16 years old in the TV show. The series finds Ted and John dealing with adolescent curiosities like drug use, pornography, and underage drinking.

To round out the ensemble of his latest NSFW family sitcom, MacFarlane recruited a handful of his old cohorts from Family Guy, American Dad!, and The Orville. Patrick Stewart, the narrator of the Ted movies, has been replaced by one of his X-Men co-stars. The Ted cast includes actors from the main casts of such hit shows as Parenthood, The Practice, and Never Have I Ever. Almost every actor in this ensemble is recognizable from a few other high-profile projects.
