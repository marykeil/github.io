# 10 TV Shows Set In The Real World That Are Very Hard To Believe


## SUMMARY 


 Over-the-top dramas often choose high-profile subjects like politics and criminal justice to stretch the boundaries of reality and introduce outlandish plots. 
 Shows like Prison Break and 24 push the limits of what can happen within a given time-frame, introducing convoluted plot lines and improbable threats. 
 Series like Alias and The Americans take the concept of spies undercover to the extreme, with complex webs of lies, betrayals, and shocking twists that become increasingly unrealistic.

## Literature Review
While these shows might take place in the real world on paper, many of their plotlines and character developments are not rooted in reality. 




Suspension of disbelief is a large part of what makes television enjoyable, but sometimes a show takes what could reasonably happen in the real world and pushes it to its limits. It&#39;s accepted that even if a series is supposed to take place in reality, it takes some dramatic liberties, but even a dedicated fan base may start to question how some of the plot points could be possible. Shows that take place in a fantasy world or have a magic system are supposed to play with out-of-this-world concepts, but it&#39;s expected that other series have a more grounded approach.
The dramas that are a little too over-the-top to be considered true realism often deal with topics like politics, criminal justice, and espionage. All of these are high-profile subjects that the general population of the audience most likely doesn&#39;t have strong experience with. It&#39;s for this reason that show creators choose these settings as a backdrop for the outlandish plots and interpersonal drama that make up the major beats of the story. Taking a topic already rife with intrigue and secrets provides an excellent opportunity to stretch the boundaries of reality.









 








 10  Prison Break (2005 - 2017) 
A man battles the prison system and a political conspiracy


 







 Prison Break 

 Release Date   August 29, 2005    Cast   Curtis Lum , Sarah Wayne Callies , Marina Benedict , Amin El Gamal , Wentworth Miller , Steve Mouzakis , Dominic Purcell , Bobby Naderi , Christian Michael Cooper    Genres   Drama , Crime , Action    Seasons   5    Story By   Paul Scheuring, nick santora    Writers   Paul Scheuring , Nick Santora    Network   FOX    Directors   Paul Scheuring    Showrunner   Paul Scheuring    




After Michael&#39;s (Wentworth Miller) brother Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) is wrongfully incarcerated and put on death row, Michael makes it his mission to set him free. Already a daunting and difficult task, the brothers are then caught up in political secrets and intrigue and eventually are recruited by Homeland Security in the latter half of the series. What started with an unlikely enough concept kept getting more and more convoluted as the show progressed. The fact that the brothers ended up back in prison so many times in so many different countries makes it obvious that the show was introducing plot lines just for the drama.
            
 
 10 Most Unexpected Things To Happen In Prison Break 
Throughout the five seasons, Prison Break always kept audiences guessing because of its frequent unexpected storylines and plot twists. 









 9  24 (2001 - 2010) 
Every episode is an hour of Jack Bauer&#39;s life
        

24 made its name with the unique premise that every episode of the season is happening in real-time. The protagonist, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), encounters a terrorist threat, and the season spans each hour of the day that he has to stop it. With 24 hours and episodes, one episode for each other, the limits of how much can happen within that period are frequently pushed. As the series progressed, the stakes got higher and the threats that Bauer encountered became more improbable. Due to having multiple storylines unfold at once, ridiculous plots of kidnapping, the threat of nuclear war, and the White House being invaded would occur simultaneously. 





 8  Psych (2006 - 2014) 
The police recruit a phony psychic to help them solve murders
        

 Psych 

 Release Date   July 7, 2006    Cast   Dule Hill , Kirsten Nelson , Corbin Bernsen , James Roday , Maggie Lawson , Anne Dudek , Timothy Omundson    Genres   Comedy , Mystery , Crime    Seasons   8    Story By   Steve Franks    Writers   Andy Berman , Steve Franks    Network   USA    Directors   Mel Damski , Steve Franks    Showrunner   Steve Franks    




Shawn Spencer (James Roday Rodriguez) is not a psychic, he just has strong powers of observation. Unfortunately, this gets him in trouble with the police. To cover his tracks, he tricks the officers into believing he&#39;s psychic, and that&#39;s why he has such amazing crime-solving capabilities. A police department would never consult a psychic, or, for that matter, believe a man who says that he has the power of clairvoyance. With each season, Shawn becomes a more integral part of the department, and the detectives come to rely on him for many cases. Though he and the police do have fun together, in reality, this arrangement would never work.





 7  Alias (2001 - 2006) 
A woman is recruited to the CIA, but it turns out not to be the real CIA, and then she loses her memory
        

 Alias 

 Release Date   September 30, 2001    Cast   Jennifer Garner , Michael Vartan , Bradley Cooper    Genres   Thriller    Seasons   5    Story By   j.j. abrams    Writers   J.J. Abrams    Network   ABC    Streaming Service(s)   Disney&#43;    Directors   J.J. Abrams    




Jennifer Garner stars as Sydney, a woman whose life is continuously turned upside down by the world of espionage in Alias. Despite thinking that she is working for the CIA, it&#39;s soon revealed that she&#39;s been deceived, and it&#39;s a terrorist organization that&#39;s tricking her. Once she uncovers this, she becomes a double agent, but that&#39;s only the beginning. She later suffers extreme amnesia and loses two years of her life.
Although the lives of secret agents remain a mystery to the masses, this level of subterfuge seems a little far-fetched. Each agent changes sides and double-crosses the others so many times it&#39;s easy to lose track of who&#39;s good and who&#39;s evil. In the final season, the show truly goes off the rails by introducing ghosts and immortality to the once slightly more realistic show.





 6  Castle (2009 - 2014) 
An author becomes a detective and a detective becomes a muse


 







 Castle 

 Release Date   March 9, 2009    Cast   Jon Huertas , Tamala Jones , Molly C. Quinn , Stana Katic , Susan Sullivan , Seamus Dever , Nathan Fillion    Genres   Drama , Crime , Comedy , Mystery    Seasons   8    Story By   Andrew W. Marlowe    Writers   Andrew W. Marlowe    Network   ABC    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Prime Video , Apple TV&#43;    Directors   Andrew W. Marlowe    Showrunner   Andrew W. Marlowe    




Castle revolves around the unexpectedly exciting life of Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) after he gets permission to follow Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) while solving crimes. The pair get off to a rocky start, but Castle brings surprising insight into criminal cases, and Beckett is a fantastic inspiration for a character in his novels. Of course, an author would not be allowed to shadow criminal investigations, and Castle would have a much more difficult time convincing Beckett to allow him to mine her life for dramatic details. To top it all off, the pair ends up falling in love, and Castle becomes a vital member of the NYPD. 





 5  The Americans (2013 - 2018) 
Two Russian spies hidden in plain sight
        

 The Americans 

 Release Date   January 30, 2013    Cast   Keidrich Sellati , Richard Thomas , Holly Taylor , Annet Mahendru , Matthew Rhys , Keri Russell , Noah Emmerich , Maximiliano Hern√°ndez    Genres   Mystery , Drama , Crime    Seasons   6    Story By   joseph weisberg    Writers   Joseph Weisberg    Network   FX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43;    Directors   Chris Long    Showrunner   Joseph Weisberg    




Though spies do end up going deep undercover, and this can last for years, The Americans takes this to the next level. The show has been lauded as one of the greatest TV dramas of the 21st century, but that doesn&#39;t mean that every plot line was plausible. It revolves around the lives of two Russian spies living in the D.C. suburbs during the height of the Cold War.
While this premise is exciting, it&#39;s not unbelievable, but the experiences that Elizabeth (Keri Russell) and Phillip (Matthew Rhys) end up going through are boundary-pushing. The web of lies, betrayals, and shocking twists becomes increasingly complicated and unbelievable as the show progresses. By the final season, characters are driven by their emotional realities rather than their patriotic loyalties, which doesn&#39;t often happen in cases of serious espionage.





 4  Designated Survivor (2016 - 2019) 
The President is killed, along with high-level members of his staff
        

 Designated Survivor 

 Release Date   September 21, 2016    Cast   Kiefer Sutherland , Adan Canto    Genres   Drama    Seasons   3    Story By   kiefer sutherland    Writers   Kiefer Sutherland    Network   ABC , Netflix    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Directors   Kiefer Sutherland    




There are many ways that Designated Survivor could have been better as a series, but part of the fun was how unbelievable the developments of each episode were. Tom Kirkman (Kiefer Sutherland) is promoted to President of the United States after an attack leaves him the remaining cabinet member, and next in line for the position. This premise is quite wild and unlikely, but what follows is even more so. Threats of war, terrorism, and political betrayals reach alarming heights and devolve into ridiculous conspiracies while Kirkman attempts to do a good job leading the American people.





 3  Orange Is The New Black (2013 - 2019) 
A woman is sent to prison and ends up falling in love
        

 orange is the new black 

 Release Date   July 11, 2013    Cast   Taylor Schilling , Dascha Polanco , Natasha Lyonne , Samira Wiley , Kate Mulgrew , Danielle Brooks , Michael Harney , Uzo Aduba , Jason Biggs , Laura Prepon    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Rating   TV-MA    Seasons   7    Story By   Piper Kerman    Writers   Jenji Kohan , Piper Kerman    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Showrunner   Jenji Kohan    




Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling) is sentenced to a few months in prison after being tied to a drug trafficking incident many years before. When she enters Litchfield prison, she finds her ex-girlfriend there, and quickly reconnects with her, but this coincidence isn&#39;t the strangest part of the show. The plot lines in Orange Is The New Black range from corruption in the penitentiary system to interpersonal drama that would never happen in prison or the outside world. In the final few seasons, the show goes off the rails and strays into melodramatic plots that uncover inconsistencies in character development and depart from the original tone of the show. 





 2  White Collar (2009 - 2014) 
A criminal is brought in to be a confidant for the FBI
        

 White Collar 

 Release Date   October 23, 2009    Cast   Matt Bomer    Genres   Mystery    Seasons   6    Network   USA    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43; , Netflix    




Similar arrangements to the one Neal Cafferty (Matt Bomer) has with the FBI in White Collar have happened in real life, but the extent to which the show stretches this reality is questionable. Neal chafes against the leash the FBI puts him on, but the amount of freedom he has increased as the show goes on, as does the unexpected criminal cases that he finds himself working on. He faces rings of criminal masterminds with impossible technology and tracks down valuable information and items that don&#39;t exist in the real world.
As a con artist, Neal easily finds ways to wriggle out of the confines the FBI places on him, and it seems that no one is keeping tabs on him except for his &#34;partner&#34;, Peter Burke (Tim DeKay). Despite his initial annoyance with Neal, Burke grows to trust and rely on him, even though Neal is a grifter. Not only that, but the way that Neal finds to stop other thieves is by committing illegal acts himself, something the FBI would not allow.

 1  Scandal (2012 - 2018) 
A political fixer can&#39;t escape her dark and haunted past


 







 Scandal 

 Release Date   May 4, 2012    Cast   Kerry Washington , Tony Goldwyn , Scott Foley    Genres   Drama    Seasons   7    Story By   Shonda Rhimes    Writers   Shonda Rhimes    Network   ABC    Streaming Service(s)   Prime Video , Hulu , Apple TV&#43;    Directors   Scott Foley    Showrunner   Shonda Rhimes    




Kerry Washington plays Olivia Pope in Scandal, a show that lives up to its name in every sense. It&#39;s quickly revealed that Olivia has been having an affair with the President (Tony Goldwyn), but they have been keeping it a secret, despite being obvious, and this is one of the least scandalous storylines on the show. As a fixer in the political arena, Olivia is involved in wild schemes to cover up wrongdoings and help people hold on to power. By the end of the series, more than one character has committed murder, and almost everyone has thrown their hat in the ring to be the next President.
