The Bachelor season 28 may be getting ready for it’s season premiere, but fans are already angry over one of the season’s contestants who was a White House aide for President Donald Trump. With Joey Graziadei ready to take the lead on The Bachelor season 28, his massive cast of over 30 women are looking forward to their chance to find love with the tennis pro.

After being selected as the new Bachelor, Joey shared he was finally ready for love.




A Reddit post sharing that one of The Bachelor contestants, Marlena Haddad, was a White House aide for Donald Trump has been getting a lot of traction after fans realized her values may seriously conflict with Joey’s. Reddit user u/PA_MallowPrincess_98 shared a screenshot of a tweet confirming Marlena’s position, then shared, “his is MESSED UP and needs to be addressed! Producers decide to put someone homophobic, anti-democratic, &amp; an insurrectionist by proxy onto the show. JOEY’S FATHER is a member of the LGBTQIA COMMUNITY.” While some were unhappy with the casting, others were outraged that Marlena’s participation was being questioned.

While many Bachelor fans were concerned about the idea of Marlena being on the series, others were hoping Bachelor Nation would allow her to speak up for her career before piling on. “Everyone has a job. Everyone has a stance. It isn’t a crime to work for a man that you personally disagree with,” u/EnormousPrunis shared. Some felt that until Marlena shared her beliefs of her own volition, it wasn’t on Bachelor Nation to judge her for her work. Despite the criticism, many are still hopeful for the contestants looking to fall for Joey on The Bachelor season 28. Bachelor Nation trusts Joey, at least to guide his love life.


 

With many fans of Bachelor Nation already concerned about the idea of someone being blatantly against Joey’s views on the series, the season will be off to a controversial start.

From contestants lying outright to Joey and creating personal issues with one another, the show has always had a thread of drama and The Bachelor season 28 will be no different. Joey will have to navigate his way through tough decisions as the lead.




With the contestants of The Bachelor season 28 already coming under fire when the season has yet to premiere, things are already getting dramatic for the series as it moves into a milestone season. Joey’s time as the lead is rumored to be highly dramatic and emotional, which many believe will lead to an exciting season of roses and real feelings for Bachelor Nation. Though The Bachelor season 28 is still a few days away, it’s clear that fans are more ready than ever to watch an all-new love story unfold.
