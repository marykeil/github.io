## SUMMARY

Kody&#39;s troubled behavior and relationships with his wives have been called into question, but he is rarely called out on the show.

## Literature Review
Sister Wives One On One host Sukanya Krishnan is asking the cast about their lives, but she&#39;s getting called out for not holding Kody accountable.




Sister Wives season 18 may be coming to a close, but there are still several parts of the Tell-All One On One episodes hosted by Sukanya Krishnan to go, though fans are calling the host out for not holding Kody accountable for his actions. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Kody had issues with each of his wives. While Christine Brown left Kody at the end of Sister Wives season 17, he was still married to Janelle Brown, Meri Brown, and Robyn Brown at the beginning of the season. After Kody had issues with each of his wives, his marriages broke down leaving him with only Robyn in his corner.




It was expected that these issues and others would be covered by Sukanya, or Suki, on Sister Wives: One On One, but many were shocked when she didn&#39;t call him out for his behavior. According to ET Online, an Instagram comment left on a preview clip for the first Tell-All episode expected that the host would &#34;let him get away with murder again. He’ll say whatever crap he wants, and she’ll just let him. Tell all? Tell nothing!&#34; Suki replied to the comment, explaining, &#34;Respectfully think you are hearing more than you ever have. I try to be fair.&#34;


 Kody Brown’s Sister Wives Behavior Explained 
          

While Kody has spoken out about some of his wrong-doings in the first episode of Sister Wives: One On One, it was on his own terms. The patriarch of the crumbling Brown family has been called out time and time again, even by members of his own family, but he doesn&#39;t tend to talk about his more abhorrent actions unless he&#39;s interested in doing so or can find something to gain from apologizing. Kody believes his own way is best, and has never truly deviated from that despite claiming he&#39;s grown and learned from his mistakes.





 

Kody has always been difficult to understand, especially in the more recent seasons of Sister Wives. His troubled behavior has been a topic of conversation all over the media, but his relationships with Christine, Janelle, and Meri have been called more into question in the last few years than ever. While viewers expect to see Kody held accountable for his behavior, it&#39;s rare that he actually is on Sister Wives or in the Tell-All episodes. Though Kody is asked to explain his actions, he&#39;s never called out for what he&#39;s done wrong and is always given the time to speak or explain.

While there are still three parts of the Tell-All episodes left to air, if the first part is any indication, it&#39;s likely that Kody will get to skate by without answering for his actions again. While host Suki has to be fair to all the parties involved, it&#39;s interesting that she chooses to let Kody off with lighter criticism than she does with his wives. The Sister Wives One On One episodes may be a breath of fresh air when it comes to airing grievances for the cast, but it can be difficult to see someone like Kody continue to get away with so much harm without being called out.
