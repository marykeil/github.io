  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Ben and Mahogany&rsquo;s relationship began on the show 90 Day Fiancé, with Ben being smitten by the 23-year-old Peruvian despite her lies about her appearance, age, and address.
Mahogany finally met Ben in person after three months of excuses, and they got married in a civil ceremony in Peru, with plans for a religious ceremony in the future.
The couple has faced financial struggles, with Ben selling his blood to make money and not being able to afford a visa for Mahogany to come to the U.S. There have been sightings of them together in the U.S., but it&rsquo;s unclear if Mahogany is currently in America with Ben.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack about Ben and Mahogany&rsquo;s storyline after 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. The couple is now married, and are broke.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5 couple Ben Rathbun and Mahogany Roca are back in the news, and here’s everything to know about their life now. Mahogany is a 23-year-old Peruvian woman who debuted in the 90 Day Fiancé show with Ben, 52, from the U.S. Ben was smitten by Mahogany even though they had never seen each other in person. Ben was giving her money while Mahogany had lied to him about how she looked, her age, and her address. Mahogany even refused to video call Ben at the time.</p>
<p>Potential catfish Mahogany was under wraps for the longest time, and all fans had seen of her were her highly filtered selfies. Mahogany became one of the biggest franchise mysteries as she kept ghosting Ben. When she did meet him, she was confused about her feelings for Ben. Mahogany had walked away from Ben in the finale. Meanwhile, Ben got into trouble off-screen and never returned to tell the rest of the story despite rumors of them filming a spin-off.</p>

<p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Mahogany Was A Catfish
Fans Still Suspect Whether Mahogany Was A Real Person</p>
<p>Ben slid into Mahogany’s DMs after he saw her liking his pictures. Ben and Mahogany bonded over their love of God and shared religious beliefs. Ben was 51 years old at the time and believed Mahogany was 24 years old. She refused to chat with Ben on video calls, and all her pictures on social media were heavily edited. However, Ben was now keen on making Mahogany his wife. Even though she was shy and Ben wanted to bring her to the U.S. Ben’s family, friends, and viewers could see the obvious signs that Mahogany was a catfish when he didn’t. However, Ben, who had been catfished in the past by a Nigerian man, didn’t give up.</p>
<p>52-Year-Old Ben Had Fallen For 22-Year-Old Mahogany
Mahogany Was Younger Than Ben&rsquo;s Daughter</p>
<p>Mahogany kept making excuses to avoid meeting Ben, but three months later, he still flew to Peru to see her. Mahogany ghosted Ben and didn’t show up to pick him up at the airport. He tried again and asked her to meet him for dinner in her town of San Bartolo. She agreed, and, shockingly, Mahogany turned out to be real. Not only did she look different from the girl in the photos, but Ben also found out Mahogany had lied to him about her age and address. However, this didn&rsquo;t stop Ben from wanting a relationship with a 22-year-old Mahogany.</p>
<p>Ben saw Mahogany as his future wife, but she refused to say &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; to him. Mahogany agreed to go to Huacachina with Ben, where they got into an argument after Ben accused his ex-wife and 27-year-old ex-fiance of their relationship not working out. Ben later sent Mahogany a slew of text messages, but she did not respond to them. Mahogany had already left for San Bartolo and refused to interact with Ben in the finale when he tried to confront her.</p>
<p>Ben &amp; Mahogany Got Married
Ben &amp; Mahogany Still Needed To Plan Religious Wedding</p>
<p>However, Ben and Mahogany were together during the Tell All. Mahogany accepted Ben when he went back to Peru without a camera crew. In August 2022, Ben and Mahogany made a shocking announcement on their YouTube channel that they were engaged. Ben even tattooed Mahogany’s name on his wrist.</p>
<pre><code>    90 Day Fiancé: Why Ben &amp; Mahogany Have Gone Missing From Instagram  90 Day Fiancé couple Ben Rathbun and Mahogany Roca's Instagram profiles are nowhere to be found. There may be reasons why they're lying low.   
</code></pre>
<p>In the same month, Mahogany revealed she was married to Ben before taking back her claims and saying she wasn’t. The truth was revealed in an episode of 90 Day Diaries. Ben said that he married Mahogany “just a few months ago.” Ben and Mahogany had a civil ceremony that was attended by her parents. He said they were still planning on having a religious ceremony. Even though they got married, Mahogany still needed Ben to build trust with her. He admitted they were going through a “difficult transition.”</p>
<p>Ben Is Selling His Blood To Make Money
Ben Doesn&rsquo;t Have Money To Pay His Bills</p>
<p>Ben had moved to New Bern, North Carolina, from Fraser, Michigan, and revealed he had gone six months without a good job. Things were  &ldquo;tight” for Ben, who was doing anything he could to pay the bills. However, Ben had not been able to get a visa for Mahogany because of his financial situation, even though the plan had always been for her to come to the U.S. Ben had last seen Mahogany three months ago, so he decided to donate his blood at the blood bank in America to fund his trip to Lima.</p>
<p>Ben filmed himself going to Peru, where they planned on meeting at a park. Mahogany was late as usual to meet Ben, but she didn’t ghost him this time. Ben and Mahogany had to plan a Peruvian wedding. He had to decide between getting a spousal visa and going to Peru to financially support Mahogany. She threatened him that she&rsquo;d “change her mind” and not marry him. Ben saw that Mahogany was still not convinced about him, but hoped they could build trust so Mahogany would believe in him.</p>
<p>Is Mahogany In America Now With Ben?
Mahogany Allegedly Spotted In U.S. With Ben</p>
<p>It’s not known exactly when Ben and Mahogany filmed 90 Day Diaries. However, in September 2022, Reddit user u/not-cheetos claimed they saw Ben and Mahogany in Beverly Hills. They said the couple was walking on the sidewalk where the fans were standing. They called out to Ben, who gave them an awkward wave and a nervous smile. The fan got a “yes it’s me but we don’t want to talk” vibe from Ben. The 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days viewer also added that Mahogany was acting like a celebrity and didn’t want to show her face. “Probably because it was unfiltered but it was her,” the fan joked.</p>
