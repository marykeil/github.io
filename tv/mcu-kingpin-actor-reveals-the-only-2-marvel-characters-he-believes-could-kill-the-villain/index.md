## Literature Review
Kingpin actor Vincent D&#39;Onofrio, who soon returns in Echo, has answered who are the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters that could kill Wilson Fisk.




Kingpin actor Vincent D&#39;Onofrio thinks that two Marvel Cinematic Universe could get the closest to taking Wilson Fisk out. D&#39;Onofrio will soon return as Fisk as part of the cast of Echo — which also includes Charlie Cox as Daredevil — on Disney&#43;. Based on recent rumors, D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin is said to become a major force in the street-level MCU, appearing in future Marvel movies and series, and that could lead to the character dying at the hands of an MCU hero.




Speaking to Jake&#39;s Takes, D&#39;Onofrio revealed that Spider-Man and Daredevil are the two MCU characters who could ultimately beat Kingpin.


 

While he was asked about which MCU characters could kill Kingpin, D&#39;Onofrio answered differently, as the actor does not think Fisk needs to die. Instead, he proposed Spider-Man and Daredevil as the two heroes who could — together — get the closest to killing Kingpin. That story could certainly lead to one of the MCU&#39;s best movies, perhaps Spider-Man 4. Check out the full exchange below:


&#34;Interviewer: If Fisk is going to be killed, who would be the Avenger or the character that should be the one that finally gets to do it?
D&#39;Onofrio: This is a very difficult question, because I don&#39;t see that happening. I don&#39;t see Kingpin dying. Kingpin never died in the canon of the comic books, so that&#39;s very difficult. I&#39;ll talk in terms of who could come close to it. I think that it would have to be either Daredevil or Spider-Man... together, the two of them together, maybe. But I don&#39;t see Kingpin going away. He never did when I was a kid, so I don&#39;t expect he will now.&#34;

 Will Marvel Ever Kill Off Kingpin In The MCU? 
          

Like D&#39;Onofrio states, Kingpin is a very important character to Marvel, both in the comics and the MCU, so it is very hard to believe that Wilson Fisk will ever bite the dust. Netflix&#39;s Daredevil series is one of the most successful live-action projects Marvel has ever done, with D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s ruthless Kingpin exploding in popularity. That translated to the actor&#39;s MCU debut as Kingpin, with the character stealing the headlines with his Hawkeye entrance.

Now that Kingpin and Daredevil are firmly in the MCU, with the duo finally facing off again in Daredevil: Born Again, the true potential of the characters can be realized. In the comics, there have been multiple storylines that saw Kingpin be a threat to several Marvel heroes, with the character being sent to prison after being defeated. The MCU could repeat that plan, allowing D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin to have a looming presence throughout the MCU.




Marvel Studios has a knack for killing villains after just one appearance. That practice has led to many complaints over the years as intriguing villains like Ultron and Killmonger were killed in their first movie, wasting the villains&#39; potential. Based on his recent comments, D&#39;Onofrio continues as excited as ever to keep playing Kingpin, with the actor wanting to see the villain trade blows with Spider-Man like he has done in the comics countless times. While Kingpin might lose to the MCU&#39;s heroes at the end of whatever story Marvel seems to be setting up for him, the MCU is unlikely to kill Kingpin.
