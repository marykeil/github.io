# Dragon Ball Super Fixed DBZ s Biggest Problem With One Big Hint


## SUMMARY 



  Dragon Ball Super had more foresight in its story arcs compared to some of Dragon Ball Z&#39;s.   Toriyama originally wanted Goku to have white hair earlier instead of blue, but saved it for a later arc.   Despite the planning, some arcs in Dragon Ball Super still felt disjointed and vaguely connected.

## Literature Review

Author Akira Toriyama shared a shocking clue about Dragon Ball Super&#39;s most powerful characters, and it&#39;s something that would have made DBZ better.




A small clue provided by Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama revealed one incredible change that helped make Dragon Ball Super better than Dragon Ball Z. Goku obtained some incredible new power-ups throughout the franchise&#39;s history, and Dragon Ball Super was no exception. The stunning transformations often feature new hair colors, and an interview from the past revealed some important information about an upcoming foe and, more importantly, a significant advantage in DBS&#39;s creation over DBZs.




The divine and incredibly powerful Ultra Instinct form gave Goku his best transformation yet, complete with a godly glow and white hair. However, Toriyama originally wanted to give the Saiyan white hair instead of blue during the Resurrection &#39;F&#39; film, and a translation of a 2016 interview found on kanzenshuu provides more clarification on the topic.



&#34;In Battle of Gods it was red, so I figured for Revival of &#34;F&#34; I should go with blue. That&#39;s all (laughs). Well, actually I was thinking about having it be white, but then it would color-clash with the &#34;next enemy&#34;â€¦ so I figured I should save it for another occasion (laughs).&#34; - Akira Toriyama




Included in the release of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s manga Volume #1, the comic&#39;s illustrator Toyotaro interviewed Toriyama and asked about the origin of Super Saiyan Blue. The Dragon Ball creator&#39;s answer not only hinted at the next villain that&#39;d turn out to be the evil Kai Zamazu, but also that Dragon Ball Super&#39;s arcs were more planned than Dragon Ball Z&#39;s weekly manga originally was.





 More Planning Went Into Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Story The Z&#39;s 
          

Toriyama&#39;s comment refers to Zamazu from DBS&#39;s Future Trunks Saga, which began to air months after the manga&#39;s first volume was published in April 2016. Goku and Vegeta battled Goku Black and Zamazu consistently in their Super Saiyan Blue forms, which contrasted effectively against Black&#39;s pink-haired form and Zamazu&#39;s godly white hair. The author&#39;s comment slyly teased both Zamazu and revealed that Goku&#39;s eventually white-haired Ultra Instinct form was baking in Toriyama&#39;s mind long before it debuted in the epic Tournament of Power arc. A example of planning ahead that Dragon Ball Z could have done better.

                  Dragon Ball&#39;s Creator Wanted to Kill Goku and Replace Him With Gohan   Goku is one of the most recognizable manga protagonists of all time, yet Dragon Ball&#39;s creator originally wanted Gohan to take his place.   




Like most mangas released through Weekly Shonen Jump, Dragon Ball Z&#39;s storyline consistently changed due to the reader&#39;s and staff&#39;s input. Other series can also influence mangas by showing authors what works and doesn&#39;t work. Naruto&#39;s most heartbreaking moments were often a response to One Piece&#39;s light-hearted ones. One such change in Dragon Ball Z&#39;s manga saw the focus remain on Goku instead of Gohan, as initially intended. While DBS&#39;s manga releases monthly, it&#39;s comforting to know that the return of a beloved series was more carefully constructed instead of being a thoughtless cash grab.

          

Despite Dragon Ball Super seemingly being more planned out than DBZ was, many of the anime&#39;s arcs still felt disjointed and vaguely connected. It&#39;s a shame because many of the franchise&#39;s best arcs are improved thanks to previous story elements setting each other up, like the Saiyan Saga&#39;s escalation to the clash with Frieza and the Tournament of Power&#39;s many payoffs. With Dragon Ball Super&#39;s last arc seemingly on the horizon, hopefully, Toriyama and Toyotaro have more well-planned reveals for fans.
