## Literature Review
Kingpin actor Vincent D&#39;Onofrio has revealed his two favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe shows, teasing their influence on Daredevil: Born Again.




Vincent D&#39;Onofrio explains how his two favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe shows will help define Daredevil: Born Again. D&#39;Onofrio and Charlie Cox are back as Kingpin and Daredevil, respectively, to lead the cast of Marvel&#39;s Daredevil: Born Again. Following a major creative overhaul, which saw the series delayed and the MCU reassess its TV show development practices, Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s story seems to now be coming along nicely.




Speaking to Collider, D&#39;Onofrio revealed that his favorite MCU series are Moon Knight and Loki, and they share a connection with Daredevil: Born Again. D&#39;Onofrio commented on how the upcoming MCU series has added Moon Knight and Loki directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, as well as The Punisher writer Dario Scardapane, Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s new showrunner. According to the Kingpin actor, after the changes, &#34;We’re in a very happy place right now.” Check out the full quote below:


“I think all the powers out there that control this whole creative world of the MCU, also believe that we’re in the right place right now… I have to say, it’s luck, really. I mean, my favorite series so far have been Moon Knight and Loki, and we’ve got those guys as directors, and so that’s pretty lucky. And we’ve got Dario [Scardapane], who’s an incredible writer who wrote The Punisher. We’re in a very happy place right now.”





                  Every MCU TV Show Ranked Worst To Best   From WandaVision to She-Hulk, from Loki to Ms. Marvel, the MCU&#39;s Disney&#43; TV shows have been hits - but how do they all compare to one another?    


 How Daredevil: Born Again’s Creative Overhaul Can Help The MCU Series 
Marvel Studios Is Changing How It Does TV
          

Last October, a report revealed that Daredevil: Born Again was in chaos. Marvel Studios fired writers Chris Ord and Matt Corman, as well as the directors for the remaining episodes of Daredevil: Born Again. The decision was said to be due to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and other executives reviewing the footage that had been shot for the series and realizing that &#34;The show wasn’t working.&#34;

Daredevil: Born Again was said to be more of a legal procedural than an action series in the vein of the original Netflix show. With the new changes, fans can expect to see more of Cox as Daredevil, as the original version of the MCU series only had the actor suit up in episode four. The report also claimed that Marvel was looking into changing how it makes TV, with actual showrunners now being looked at for projects and a focus on multi-season shows rather than limited series.




Daredevil: Born Again was rumored to kill Foggy Nelson and Karen Page offscreen, explaining why the characters who were integral to Netflix&#39;s Daredevil were not part of the MCU show. With the new creative overhaul of the series and the fan outcry over the characters&#39; potential demise, Marvel could go back and write Foggy and Karen into the series, especially since Echo&#39;s new trailer seemingly confirmed Netflix&#39;s Daredevil is MCU canon. By bringing in the directors behind two of the MCU&#39;s best shows and a showrunner who was a writer on Netflix&#39;s The Punisher, Daredevil: Born Again has a decent shot of bringing back what fans loved about Netflix&#39;s Daredevil.
