## Literature Review
Christina Crochet didn&#39;t have the best Married At First Sight experience, but she has moved on.




Christina Crochet from Married At First Sight has been busy since her time on the show, and it&#39;s time to revisit what she&#39;s been up to. As one of the best reality TV shows, MAFS took onscreen dating up a notch when it premiered in 2014 by having contestants marry each other &#34;at first sight.&#34; In the series, each couple is paired with experts, meets at the altar, gets married, goes on a honeymoon, and then lives together for eight weeks. While some couples stay together on Decision Day, others call it quits, and Christina and Henry Rodriguez weren&#39;t destined to last. As fans finish MAFS season 17, it&#39;s time to revisit Christina from season 11.




MAFS season 11 was an exceptionally wild ride for contestants. Filming began in New Orleans in March 2020, just as the pandemic started wreaking havoc worldwide. While it was difficult enough for normal married couples to stay entertained during quarantine, living with spouses that the contestants had just met was even more trying. While several Louisiana-based couples opted to stay together on Decision Day, Christina and her then-husband Henry unsurprisingly chose to get a divorce. The two were an odd match from the beginning, and in their case, opposites did not attract.


 Christina Moved To Mexico After MAFS 
          

After the show ended, Christina appeared ready to put all the drama of a disastrous Married At First Sight match behind her. After the finale aired, Christina relocated to Mexico, working her first-ever remote job. The move south of the border appears to have been good for her, physically and mentally. The former flight attendant looked energized and more beautiful than ever in pictures from her private Instagram account. Christina was seen relaxing by the pool and spending time with her dog, according to Monsters &amp; Critics.






 Christina Expressed Mixed Feelings About MAFS 
          

Christina also seems to have mixed feelings about her time on MAFS. She laughed when asked about her time on the show, &#34;I sometimes forget that I did the show!&#34; While her contract with the show most likely prevents her from discussing all aspects of her MAFS experiences, she has made several cryptic comments about her feelings. She acknowledged that a hostile and dramatic Decision Day moment was possible and didn&#39;t want to play the victim card. However, she also said that she looked at the situation &#34;as a life lesson&#34; because she was &#34;more aware of how corrupt and money-hungry people will be for a few more bucks.&#34;

Unfortunately, there&#39;s little update on what Christina has experienced in the past couple of years, as she&#39;s gone off the radar. Despite being paired by experts on the show, Christina completely clashed with her husband. The whole experience left her with a negative view of fame and celebrity. Hopefully, she continues to enjoy life in privacy after Married At First Sight.
