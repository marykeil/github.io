# Sword Art Online Leaving Aincrad Saved Kirito And Asuna s Relationship


## SUMMARY 



  Moving to ALfheim Online made Sword Art Online better, as it allowed for the escalation of Kirito and Asuna&#39;s relationship.   The shift in scenery, character designs, and power system in the &#34;Fairy Dance&#34; arc was criticized by fans, but it was necessary for the story to progress.   The next logical progression in the story that amplified Kirito and Asuna&#39;s relationship could only be told in ALO, where Sugo threatened to make Asuna his slave in both the game and the real world.

## Literature Review
Sword Art Online leaving its first MMORPG world, Aincrad, for ALfheim was the logical step for the story and it improved the series.




Many fans still can&#39;t reconcile with how Kirito and Asuna&#39;s story in Sword Art Online had to end and that the second half of season one (and beyond) needed to move to the new world of ALfheim Online (ALO). In fact, that&#39;s why some think that Dot Hack is Sword Art Online done right. Although later arcs help explain the reason why SAO needed to change worlds, the answer also lies in where Kirito and Asuna&#39;s journey was in SAO&#39;s Aincrad at the very end.




Part of the harsh critique of Sword Art Online&#39;s ALfheim arc, called the &#34;Fairy Dance&#34; arc, is the shift in scenery, character designs, and power system that fans had grown accustomed to in the original story based on the light novels by Reki Kawahara. Moreover, arguably Aincrad&#39;s greatest moments occur when Kirito and Asuna are honeymooning together in peace, and moving to ALfheim Online separates them for the majority of the story when Kirito and Asuna had just started battling together on level 75 of Aincrad. However, moving past Aincrad arguably made Sword Art Online better.


 Kirito and Asuna&#39;s Journey Had Already Reached Its Apex In Aincrad 
Sword Art Online season 1, produced by A-1 Pictures and based on the light novels by Reki Kawahara.
          

However, the main source of conflict between Kirito and Asuna that Sword Art Online introduces by the end of level 75 had already been resolved, and the best way to escalate the tension was to send them to a new world. Before Kirito and Asuna&#39;s honeymoon, the two warriors were just close friends and therefore comfortable fighting even if their lives were in danger. But during their honeymoon, they grow accustomed to living in peace together. So, when they are faced with the level-75 mission in episode #13, Kirito is terrified at the prospect of Asuna dying and asks her to stay behind., Asuna responds she can&#39;t because if Kirito died then she would end her own life. The only force keeping them from running away is that their real bodies could be dying, and completing level 100 is their only hope.




In other words, episode #13 sees Kirito and Asuna having to deal with the terror of each other dying, which they face head-on in episode #14 against level 75&#39;s boss. But once it&#39;s defeated, and they are about to continue on, their journey gets expedited when Kirito fights and defeats the true villain Akihiko Kayaba, thus ending the game. Circumventing floors 76 to 100 was a gift in disguise because otherwise the story would have just gone through the same motions with Kirito and Asuna&#39;s newfound fear.

          

The next logical progression in the story that truly amplifies Kirito and Asuna&#39;s relationship could only be told in ALO, when Sugo captures Asuna. Sugo&#39;s plan for Asuna is much more terrifying than anything that could have happened to her in Aincrad: he threatened more than her life because he was going to make her his slave in the game and in the real world. So, while fans fell in love with Sword Art Online&#39;s world inside Aincrad, elongating that story would have just resulted in a more watered-down version of what was shown at level 75, instead of naturally escalating the relationship between Kirito and Asuna as it happened in ALfheim Online.
