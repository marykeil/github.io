UPDATE: 2024/01/09 17:34 EST BY THOMAS BACON


Ahsoka season 2 officially in development.


Lucasfilm has officially confirmed that Ahsoka season 2 is in development.







Ahsoka Tano actress Rosario Dawson has spoken about the future of Ahsoka, though her words about the Star Wars TV show are not promising. Set in the New Republic era along with The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka serves the purpose of not only detailing Ahsoka&#39;s transformative journey into Ahsoka the White, but also sets up the future of this Star Wars era. Grand Admiral Thrawn has made his triumphant return to the Star Wars galaxy, and Baylan Skoll&#39;s mysterious interest in Peridea could pose an even greater threat to the galaxy. The ending of Ahsoka left viewers hungry for season 2, though it has not yet been confirmed by Lucasfilm - and Dawson has now further confirmed this disappointing reality.

                  Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know   Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project.    

In speaking with the Dagobah Dispatch podcast, Dawson is asked if she&#39;s had any conversations about the future of Ahsoka. Her response, unfortunately, is a disappointed &#34;No.&#34; Still, she looks to the positive side as she discusses an upcoming reunion with her fellow cast members and their participation at recent cons.





No. We&#39;re supposed to be having a dinner soon, of the whole cast, which will be really nice because I haven&#39;t seen everyone. I was very jealous seeing everyone at some of their cons recently, which I wasn&#39;t able to be at.


In mentioning the cast dinner, Dawson doesn&#39;t mention any of the crew, or any types of creators who may be responsible for making the decision on Ahsoka season 2. This means any conversations about Ahsoka season 2 may not happen anytime soon. With The Mandalorian season 4 presumably filming soon and early development on Dave Filoni&#39;s The Mandalorian movie still in progress, it could be a long time before Ahsoka season 2 is addressed whatsoever.


 When Will Lucasfilm Announce Ahsoka Season 2? 
          

The demand for Ahsoka season 2 has only continued to rise ever since the conclusion of season 1, especially with Filoni&#39;s Mandalorian movie on the horizon. The ending of Ahsoka is somewhat of a cliffhanger, with Ahsoka and Sabine Wren trapped on Peridea while Thrawn and Ezra Bridger return home to the familiar galaxy. The motivations of Baylan are also still unclear, which seems in and of itself to promise another story that ought to be told sooner rather than later.




Holding out on this crucial Ahsoka story will only damage the future of this Star Wars era. Trying to tie the loose ends of this series in The Mandalorian season 4 or Filoni&#39;s Mandalorian movie will cause a pacing problem many viewers have had recent frustrations with, and thus granting Ahsoka season 2 sooner would avoid that issue altogether. Whether or not Ahsoka season 2 actually does arrive before then is left to be seen, but waiting any longer may hurt the current demand the Star Wars TV show has, as well as the future of the New Republic era&#39;s story.
