## Literature Review
Keiko actor Mari Yamamoto details her experience filming one of the most emotional Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 finale moments.





Summary

  Dr. Keiko Miura returns after being presumed dead for decades, missing out on her husband&#39;s death and scientific advancements.   The emotional reunion between Keiko and her long-lost son Hiroshi was impactful and their recognition was instant.   Keiko&#39;s return opens up potential storylines for the show&#39;s modern timeline, including the exploration of her relationships with her grandchildren and navigating Monarch&#39;s legacy.  







Monarch: Legacy of Monsters ended its first season with the return of Dr. Keiko Miura, who had been presumed dead for decades. Thanks to the time fluctuation between the Earth and Axis Mundi, Keiko’s two-month sojourn in the realm of the Titans has caused her to miss the death of her husband and a slew of scientific and technical advancements. Still, she was able to reunite with her longtime friend Lee Shaw, albeit a much older version of him.

Even more emotional was the Randa family tree reunion as Keiko reconnected with her son Hiroshi, who has long believed his mother to be dead. Thanks to the performances of Mari Yamamoto (Keiko) and Takehiro Hira (Hiroshi), the reunion was incredibly impactful, but one of the scene’s best moments wasn’t a part of the screenplay. In an interview with Screen Rant tied to Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 10, Yamamoto had this to say about the scene:


Mari Yamamoto: That was a fascinating scene because I really wondered, like, “After 50 years, would you recognize your own child?” I was looking at videos of families who had been separated by horrific circumstances for decades, and then reuniting. There is some footage online, and I was looking at it to see, “What is that moment like?” I could see that in each case, it&#39;s instant. There’s something so primitive about recognizing your own blood, I guess. I was like, “Oh, okay. This isn&#39;t like a question at all. You see him and it&#39;s like, ‘You&#39;re my boy.’” He&#39;s such a wonderful actor as well, you see that recognition; he literally turns into that boy the moment he sees me. It just washes over [him]. It&#39;s so great when you just get to react off of another actor; I think that was happening for both of us.
There are very few lines spoken in that scene, and I felt the need to say something, so I added the line “You got so big,” which is so silly but also so real, and encompasses all of the things that she&#39;s feeling in the moment. She’s feeling what she&#39;s missed, so I felt the need to say something before I could go in to hold him.






 How Keiko’s Return Could Make Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters A One-Timeline Show 
         

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters’ time periods can be confusing as the show not only juggles its own timelines, but also fits in between other MonsterVerse films. With Keiko now a part of the series’ modern timeline, however, the show could afford to drop the storyline that began in the 1950s. Considering that the flashback timeline seemed to show Wyatt Russell’s Lee Shaw essentially giving up (until the character returns to the action as played by Kurt Russell) and Keiko presumed dead, the only character with obvious story potential left in that era is Anders Holm’s Bill Randa.

That isn’t to say that the well has run dry for exciting Bill Randa stories. Kong: Skull Island’s Bill Randa and Monarch: Legacy of Monsters’ Bill Randa are very different people, and it would be fascinating to see the character change from Anders Holm’s version into the one originated by John Goodman. The question in that case would be whether Bill Randa’s story warranted a continued exploration of that timeline without Lee Shaw or Keiko Miura, who would both be largely out of the picture.




Thanks to the last-second reveal of King Kong in the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season finale, the show also ended with a sense of urgency tied to its modern timeline. Not only is King Kong on the table, but there is an immense amount of emotional baggage to unpack concerning Keiko’s return to her family. How Keiko deals with meeting her grandchildren and establishing a relationship with her son, all while navigating Monarch’s legacy and the morally grey intentions of Apex Cybernetics, is more than enough ground for a Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 to cover.

             Monarch: Legacy of Monsters The Legendary MonsterVerse continues with Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, a sci-fi action series created for Apple TV&#43;. Set after the events of Godzilla vs. Kong, the series follows two siblings retracing their father&#39;s footsteps to uncover the truth behind their family legacy. What they find sets up a story over three decades and explores the foundations of the mysterious company.
