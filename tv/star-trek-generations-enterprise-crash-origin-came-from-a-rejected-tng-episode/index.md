# Star Trek Generations Enterprise Crash Origin Came From A Rejected TNG Episode


## SUMMARY 



  The destruction of the USS Enterprise-D in Star Trek Generations was almost a cliffhanger in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.   The crash of the saucer section would have resulted in the Enterprise-D crew being split up and the ship becoming non-functional.   Although the original plan was scrapped, the idea of the saucer crash was later revived for the movie and became a significant moment in the storyline.

## Literature Review
Star Trek Generations famously destroyed the USS Enterprise-D, but this moment almost happened years earlier on Star Trek: The Next Generation.




One of the biggest moments in Star Trek Generations is when the saucer section of the USS Enterprise-D crashes on Veridian III, but this moment almost happened in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the first big screen adventure for the crew of the USS Enterprise-D, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew must thwart the plan of Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell), who is obsessed with finding the heaven-like Nexus realm. Picard finds Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) within the Nexus and convinces the former Enterprise captain to help stop Soran.




While Star Trek Generations may be most remembered for the death of Captain Kirk, the destruction of the Enterprise-D feels almost as tragic. Picard&#39;s iconic ship had become a character in its own right over seven seasons of TNG, making its destruction hit just as hard as the death of a beloved character. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Star Trek Generations co-writer Ronald D. Moore spoke about the original plan to crash the Enterprise-D on TNG. Read his full quote below:


The genesis of the saucer crash was in a story called “All Good Things,” which was not the series finale, but a story that was going to be a cliffhanger for the sixth season of Next Gen. Brannon and I had come up with a story where Starfleet recalls the Enterprise home and is going to split the crew up. The Enterprise is going to become the Queen Mary, basically, and on the way home, the characters all decide what they’re going to do with their lives. But in the course of returning home, there’s a big battle and the saucer separates from the battle section, which explodes, and the saucer crashes on the planet’s surface. The producers hated that story for the cliffhanger and we tossed it aside, but when we were doing the movie, the crash of the saucer was one of the first things Brannon and I came to Rick with. We crash in the jungle and we know that Soran is going to extinguish that star pretty soon—and when he does, the shock wave is going to destroy the planet. So they are going to evacuate the children [in the one surviving shuttlecraft] and are leading kids out across the destroyed hull of the Enterprise, when all of a sudden these laser beams come out of the jungle and pin them down. It turns out Lursa and B’Etor have survived with a few of their men. There is a standoff and a mediation that takes place in Ten Forward, which has been completely trashed. It was fun stuff, but the script was 140 pages, and at some point it had to go. David Carson said, “Cut it all,” and we said, “But it’s got our favorite stuff.” When we took a hard look at it, though, we realized he was right. The first draft came in and they budgeted it at some ridiculous figure.





                  Every Star Trek Movie In Chronological Order   With 13 entries in the Star Trek movie series from 1979-2006, there are a couple of ways to watch the films chronologically.    


 Despite Its Destruction, Star Trek Refuses To Leave The Enterprise-D Behind 
Maybe fate really does protect &#34;fools, little children, and ships named Enterprise.&#34;
         

Although Captain Picard would command the USS Enterprise-E for the next three TNG movies, Star Trek later found creative ways to bring back the Enterprise-D. Star Trek: Lower Decks briefly depicted the bridge of the Enterprise-D within the imagination of Ensign Brad Boimler (Jack Quaid), as he practiced his captain&#39;s speech. Star Trek: Prodigy used the holodeck to bring the Enterprise-D back to life, complete with some of Starfleet&#39;s best officers, as Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray) tried out the infamous Kobayashi Maru.




But the true return of the USS Enterprise-D happens in Star Trek: Picard season 3, when Commodore Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) reveals that he has spent the last 20 years rebuilding his former ship. The Enterprise-D proves to be instrumental in saving the galaxy yet again, as the TNG crew reunites for one last adventure on the ship that was their home for seven years. Star Trek Generations may have destroyed Captain Picard&#39;s beloved ship, but even a devastating crash couldn&#39;t keep the Enterprise-D down for long.



Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;. Star Trek Generations is streaming on Max.
