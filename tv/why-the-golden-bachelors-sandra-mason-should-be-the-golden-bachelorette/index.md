## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Sandra Mason didn&#39;t find love with Gerry Turner, but she stole everyone&#39;s hearts, and should be the first Golden Bachelorette.




The Golden Bachelor contestant and fan favorite Sandra Mason didn&#39;t find a lasting relationship with leading man Gerry Turner, but Sandra should get a second chance at finding her true love as the first leading lady of The Golden Bachelorette. Sandra is a 75-year-old retired executive assistant from Doraville, Georgia. Although she and Gerry shared a great friendship on the show, their relationship didn&#39;t progress beyond that.




Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Sandra was a bright light. She was kind, caring, and very funny. Sandra proved time and again that she&#39;s entertaining to watch on television. She has what it takes to carry a TV show. Sandra should be the first lead of The Golden Bachelorette for the following reasons.

 Sandra Is Kind &amp; Caring 
          

Throughout her time on The Golden Bachelor, Sandra was kind and caring towards Gerry and her fellow contestants. She was never involved in any drama, and was soft-spoken and sweet. Sandra&#39;s demeanor would be perfect for The Golden Bachelorette because she knows how to deal with all types of personalities. She&#39;d be an understanding and empathetic lead.



 Sandra Is Hilarious 

 




Sandra has a very hilarious personality. She caught Gerry&#39;s attention on The Golden Bachelor premiere night when she had him do some meditation while using curse words as their mantra. She said in her premiere night package that she&#39;s a woman who speaks her mind, and, although she tries to filter herself, she likes curse words. Sandra brought a lot of entertainment to the show, including telling a great joke during her comedy act in the Golden Bachelor talent show. She&#39;d be a funny and engaging lead of The Golden Bachelorette.



 Sandra Wasnâ€™t In Love With Gerry Turner 
          

Although Sandra and Gerry shared a great friendship, she wasn&#39;t in love with him. This means that she would come into The Golden Bachelorette without any previous relationship baggage. On The Golden Bachelor, Sandra learned that she&#39;s ready to open up and love again, so she could take that knowledge and apply it to her new experience.






 Sandra Is Ready To Find Love Again 

 

On The Golden Bachelor episode 4, Sandra revealed that she was missing her daughter&#39;s wedding to be on the show. After Gerry brought Sandra a phone so that she could FaceTime her daughter on her wedding day, he gave her the group date rose to acknowledge how much she had given up to be there that day. Missing her daughter&#39;s wedding for the show proved that Sandra was very devoted to finding true love again, and would commit herself fully to her role as The Golden Bachelorette. She repeatedly said on the show that she was ready to find love again.

                  The Golden Bachelor: Signs There Will Be A Golden Bachelorette   There are signs that ABC&#39;s The Golden Bachelor will produce a spinoff in The Golden Bachelorette since the franchise has several trends.    






 Sandra Is 75 Years Old 

 

At 75 years old, Sandra is truly in her golden years. Gerry is 72 years old, so it would make sense that The Golden Bachelorette would continue to cast people on the older side. Although some of the Golden Bachelor contestants were 60-65, it would be delightful to see a woman of Sandra&#39;s age prove that it&#39;s never too late to find true love again. Sandra was so inspiring during her incredible performance in the group date pickleball competition while playing with two artifical knees. She proved that there don&#39;t have to be limits on people just because of their age.

Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Sandra was kind, funny, and open to finding love. All of these qualities would make her the ideal woman to be the first Golden Bachelorette. Hopefully, if ABC decides to proceed with the show, Sandra will be their star.




The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
