## Literature Review
In an exclusive from an upcoming episode of 1000-lb Sisters season 5, Amanda Halterman reveals which of her family members is dealing with depression.




1000-lb Sisters season 5 is underway, and in an exclusive clip Amanda Halterman reveals who in the family is dealing with some serious depression. After a tumultuous end to 1000-lb Sisters season 4, the family was hoping to regroup with Tammy Slaton returning home to Kentucky from her weight loss rehabilitation facility in Ohio. Though she was leaving her husband Caleb Willingham behind, Tammy was excited to be coming back home to her family. Amy Slaton, who married Michael Halterman during 1000-lb Sisters season 1, has been dealing with issues with both her health and her personal relationships after giving birth to her second son, Glenn. 




In an E! Online exclusive clip from the next episode of Sister Wives season 5, Amanda, Tammy, and their sister Misty Slaton were all hoping to help Amy through the issues she was experiencing as a brand-new mother of two boys. “I&#39;m just like exhausted all the time and I&#39;m hurting 24/7,” Amy explained, “because I&#39;m trying to take care of two boys and...the house.” Amanda pointed out that Amy wasn’t “the only parent” present. “You have a husband that is perfectly capable of taking care of these kids for you to have a moment,” Amanda shared.

While Amy pushed back against Amanda’s claims about Michael being able to support her and their sons, Amanda wasn’t interested in excuses about why Amy’s husband couldn’t be a better parent. “You have got to start doing better about supporting her. When she&#39;s upset like this, you&#39;re gonna have to take the kids away and give her a minute,” Amanda explained, while Michael looked on blankly. After Amy argued that they were hoping to hire a nanny to help care for the kids, Amanda explained, “The nanny is not going to fix the problems that you and your husband have.” Amy and Michael’s issues ultimately led to their 2023 divorce.





 

Though Amanda and her sisters were all hoping to be there for Amy in a difficult moment, she didn’t feel like sugarcoating the issues she was seeing in Amy and Michael’s relationship would be helpful to the situation. Michael had shared with Amy previously that she wasn’t allowed to leave the house without at least one of their kids, as he didn’t feel he would be able to watch both of them at the same time. Amy was feeling deeply overwhelmed by how much responsibility she was tasked with as the only parent in the house who had other things to do and couldn’t manage to catch a break.

With Amy and Michael’s marriage hurtling towards its abrupt end on 1000-lb Sisters season 5, it’s clear that the couple were heading toward trouble throughout the last season and first episodes of the current one. Amy’s relationship with Michael was never easy, but it became more difficult after their children were born and Amy was hoping to rely on Michael more for support. When he couldn’t offer her the support she needed, Amy’s family was more proactive than she was, jumping in to let the 1000-lb Sisters star that she needed to take action before things got worse.
