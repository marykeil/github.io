## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Ximena might be revealing her wedding photos on Instagram as Mike keeps flaunting his new girlfriend.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days fans suspect Ximena Morales is married after she posted pictures hinting at a wedding. Ximena from Colombia was introduced on season 5 as Mike Berk’s girlfriend. The part-time firefighter claimed he had met Ximena on a dating app and was giving her money, so she could live a comfortable life in Pereira with her family. Mike went to meet her on the spin-off and the two got engaged. However, Ximena developed cold feet and decided to break up with Mike instead of moving to the U.S. and marrying him. It was revealed that Mike and Ximena were in a transactional relationship.




Ximena has shared photos with quite a few rumored boyfriends since her split with Mike, but now, it seems she could have married one of them (as shared by Reddit user u/TravelingLifestylist.)


 

Ximena posted a photo of her standing inside a church wearing a beautiful white dress. She accessorized her look with sparkly diamond jewelry and a jeweled headband. “I wonder if it’s the groom knows about the hitman ex or not,” wrote hairbrushloversss, referring to Ximena’s hitman ex she’d told Mike about on the show. “I think she looks pretty good. I hope she found a guy that is good to her and the kids,” wrote Anders676.

However, Reddit user Almahurst-Heritage explained that some comments on Ximena’s pictures suggest the photos were of Ximena attending a baptism. A different fan included a screenshot taken from Ximena’s Instagram which revealed it was her son Harold Steven’s baptism. The photo confirmed that Ximena may have wanted her Instagram followers to believe that it was her wedding, or perhaps, Ximena wanted to make Mike feel jealous. Meanwhile, Mike has found a new girlfriend whom he got engaged to last year. Mike is trying not to reveal his girlfriend’s name or show her face to the world when he poses with her on IG.

Mike recently shared photos from their vacation to Santa Marta where he expertly hid his partner’s face while taking selfies. Fans mocked Mike in the comments, which could be why he’s disabled the comments on the post. However, Mike’s friend Jasmine Pineda referred to his girlfriend as Tati. Mike’s fiancé’s name is Tatiana and his trying to keep her identity a secret might mean that he’s with her for a new spin-off after his split with Ximena. There were rumors that Mike was filming for a franchise show and there are chances that it could be the soon-to-be-released 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.




Mike and Ximena split on a sour note, but they seem to have buried the hatchet recently. Mike had posted a screenshot of a video call between him and Ximena on Instagram to show he had repaired his relationship with her. 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days fans had lost their trust in Mike when it was revealed that he had met Ximena on a cam girl website and lied about the dating app story. Mike was paying Ximena to be his girlfriend, but she may have drawn the line when it came to marrying him for money.
