## Literature Review

Exclusive: Bridgerton season 2 star Simone Ashley teases whether fans will be satisfied by Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma&#39;s season 3 storyline.




Bridgerton star Simone Ashley teases that fans won&#39;t be disappointed by Kate and Anthony&#39;s upcoming storyline. The Netflix Regency-era period drama is based on the series of romance novels of the same name by Julia Quinn, each of which focuses on a different sibling from the Bridgerton family. Season 1 followed Daphne Bridgerton&#39;s (Phoebe Dynevor) romance with the rakish Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page), season 2 featured Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey)&#39;s love triangle where he ended up with Kate Sharma (Ashley) over her sister, and the upcoming season 3 follows Colin Bridgerton&#39;s (Luke Newton) romance with longtime friend Penelope (Nicola Coughlan).




Screen Rant had the opportunity to sit down for an interview with Simone Ashley at Sundance to discuss her character&#39;s future in Bridgerton season 3. When asked if the season would have fans rioting in the streets or fulfilled by Kate and Anthony&#39;s domestic bliss, Sharma said, &#34;I think they’ll be really happy.&#34; She added that &#34;Johnny and I had so much fun exploring Kate and Anthony post season 2,&#34; though she acknowledged they are not the central focus of the season. Read her full quote below:


No, I think they will be. Gosh that is an intense quote, that is. No, I think they’ll be really happy. I think both Johnny and I had so much fun exploring Kate and Anthony post season 2. And we had a lot of fun enjoying the blissful domestic life, as you just really beautifully put it. It’s Luke Newton’s and Nicola Coughlan’s season and, if anything, I’m just really proud of them and the episodes; for the world to see them tell the story.






 How Much Will Kate and Anthony Actually Be in Bridgerton Season 3? 
          

So far, the return of one of the central couples in the Bridgerton cast is unprecedented. Although Phoebe Dynevor returned for season 2, Regé-Jean Page did not, meaning that the continuation of season 1&#39;s main romantic pairing took place offscreen. Dynevor has now also exited the show, so neither character will appear in season 3 while Colin and Penelope&#39;s romance unfolds.



Although Colin and Penelope have a solid foundation of friendship, their potential romance was rocked by the reveal that she is secretly the gossip columnist Lady Whistledown.




The fact that both season 2&#39;s central Bridgerton family member and his new bride are returning for season 3 is thus a unique prospect. It remains to be seen how much of the storyline will be given over to exploring the marriage between Kate and Anthony. However, while they will likely be given just as much attention as any supporting characters in the show, which features a sprawling ensemble cast, their presence could nevertheless be greatly diminished.




Bailey&#39;s participation in the new season could have been severely impacted by his busy schedule. Since season 2 wrapped, the star became attached to the Showtime historical miniseries Fellow Travelers, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe, as well as taking the role of Fiyero in the upcoming two-part Wicked movie musical. Those commitments, as well as his awards season and promotional duties, could have affected his ability to appear in Bridgerton for more than a few featured scenes.
