## Literature Review
A prequel to Treasure Island, the Starz show Black Sails features a clever Easter egg that references another of the network&#39;s hit series: Outlander.




Black Sails, a hit historical-adventure show on Starz, features a clever Easter egg that pays homage to Outlander, another one of the network&#39;s popular series. Written to be a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s 1883 book, Treasure Island, Black Sails follows a crew of bounty-seeking pirates of New Providence Island who are targeted by the British government for threatening the region&#39;s maritime trade. In response, the pirates at the center of Black Sails, including the fictional Captain J. Flint (Toby Stephens), wage &#34;war against the world&#34; across the series&#39; four seasons, setting the stage for the conflict-ridden seas of Stevenson&#39;s Treasure Island.




In the show&#39;s first eight-episode season, Black Sails&#39; characters are on the hunt for a Spanish treasure galleon, Urca de Lima. By the third and fourth seasons, however, Black Sails&#39; plot ramps up, culminating in a war between the pirates and the British Empire for control of New Providence Island and its surrounding waters. Despite airing from 2014 to 2017 on Starz, Black Sails is set to dock on Netflix by early 2024, which will likely reinvigorate the show&#39;s somewhat under-the-radar success. Needless to say, an influx of viewers will be wondering about Black Sails&#39; memorable Outlander Easter egg.


 Outlander&#39;s &#34;Skye Boat&#34; Theme Song Can Be Heard In Black Sails Season 1, Episode 2 
          

Set during the 18th century, also known as the Golden Age of Piracy, the show takes place about 20 years before the classic novel. Another of the Starz network&#39;s hit series, Outlander, also takes place in the mid-1700s — around the time of the Jacobite Rising of 1745. That said, even though the two shows don&#39;t share a setting, there&#39;s no denying the time-period overlap between Black Sails and the time-traveling historical drama adapted from Diana Gabaldon&#39;s series of Outlander books. Notably, Outlander&#39;s memorable theme song is a one-of-a-kind tune — even if it&#39;s a little anachronistic.




Although the title song is actually an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s poem Sing Me a Song of a Lad That Is Gone — adding an extra fun connection to Black Sails — it&#39;s set to the tune of the Scottish number &#34;The Skye Boat Song,&#34; which laments unrequited love. Given Claire Randall (Caitríona Balfe) and Jamie Fraser&#39;s (Sam Heughan) epic love story, the song is fitting. In Black Sails season 1, episode 2, &#34;The Skye Boat Song&#34; can be heard playing in the tavern at the episode’s end. In paying homage to Outlander&#39;s theme song, the Black Sails Easter egg provides a sense of connection between the Starz series.

                  Our Flag Means Death vs. Black Sails: Which Is More Historically Accurate?   Our Flag Means Death and Black Sails are both fantastic shows about the Golden Age of Piracy - but how do they compare to the real history of pirates?    



 Why Black Sails&#39; Reference To Outlander Makes Sense 
          




Given Outlander&#39;s successful run, its &#34;The Skye Boat Song&#34; riff will always conjure up the series, especially when it appears in other contexts. Although Outlander&#39;s theme song has a very brief cameo in Black Sails, viewers of both shows will surely pick up on the musical link. Not only are both Black Sails and Outlander Starz original series, but both shows are composed by Bear McCreary. With Outlander&#39;s title song adapting a Stevenson poem, and Black Sails being a prequel to Treasure Island, it&#39;s fun that McCreary further connects to the two hit shows through the song, even if the Easter egg has no bearing on the pirate series&#39; plot.
