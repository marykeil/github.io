## Literature Review

In RHOBH season 3, Brandi Glanville revealed a shocking secret about Adrienne Maloof, which had the other Housewives reeling. Here&#39;s what went down.




In The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 3, Brandi Glanville spilled a secret about her former friend Adrienne Maloof that was not aired, and here is everything to know about what was said. Adrienne and Brandi have been friends since Brandi entered the RHOBH scene in season 3, but the two Housewives got into a tiff during a girls’ trip to Ojai. During dinner, Brandi tried to have a moment with show alum Kim Richards, but Adrienne butted in. Kim started tearing up, and Adrienne looked over and said several times, “Uh oh! Someone’s crying.” Brandi grew exasperated as she felt like Adrienne was making a scene, so she told her to “Shut the f*** up.”




After that tense moment on one of the best reality TV shows, Brandi and Adrienne’s relationship went downhill. Following the Ojai trip, the RHOBH stars, minus Adrienne, attended a food tasting at former castmate Lisa Vanderpump’s restaurant, SUR. After having a few drinks, Brandi unleashed all the resentment she had felt towards Adrienne. She claimed that Adrienne and her husband, Paul Nassif, were trying to coerce her into speaking badly about Lisa. Brandi then called Adrienne a “liar” and spilled a secret that shocked everyone. While neither is on the show anymore, Brandi and Adrienne set the scene for drama on RHOBH season 13.

Adrienne had lied to the group as it was apparently a deep, dark family secret that was never supposed to have gotten out. Although Bravo never aired what Brandi said, it was later revealed that she claimed Adrienne and Paul lied about Adrienne carrying her twin boys, as the pair had used a surrogate. Kim told Adrienne what had been said about her, and things became explosive when Adrienne and Paul confronted Brandi about it. During an event held by RHOBH star Kyle Richards’ husband, Mauricio Umansky, Paul started yelling at Brandi and hurled expletives at her. It was unclear to fans what they were upset about, as Bravo didn’t air it, but it was a pretty tense moment. Paul and Adrienne threatened to sue Brandi and then left in a huff.



 Adrienne Maloof Took Legal Action Against Bravo 
          

To prevent the network from airing her secret, Adrienne took legal action against Bravo, and the network had to edit the scene out of the show. Adrienne explained after she left RHOBH that she wanted to keep that information private because her sons didn’t even know about her using a surrogate. She said that she was informed by her doctor that telling her kids at a young age might traumatize them and that she and Paul should wait until their sons were a bit older. It was hard to understand why Adrienne and Paul wanted to keep the secret because using a surrogate shouldn&#39;t be taboo.




After the drama surrounding the surrogacy, Adrienne’s appearance on the show tapered off for the rest of the season. She refused to attend the season 3 reunion and was later released from the franchise. Adrienne later admitted that she regretted not attending the reunion and that it would have done her good to address her issues. Adrienne and Paul’s marriage, which was already strained, took a hit, and they got divorced soon after. However, Adrienne has no regrets about starring in RHOBH and credits the show with getting her out of a relationship that wasn’t right. She and Paul are now friends and co-parenting peacefully. As for Brandi, she continues to stir up trouble, even though she is no longer starring in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.



The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
