Summary

  Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 questions the flaws of the Greek gods, portraying them as vain and vengeful, setting up a potential betrayal twist.   The show&#39;s criticisms of the gods allow the audience to understand the flaws of Olympus and make Luke&#39;s eventual betrayal more understandable.   By constantly criticizing the gods, the series makes Luke a more compelling and sympathetic villain than in the original books, building anticipation for his shocking betrayal.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 has made a lot of criticisms about the Greek gods, and this commentary is setting up the show&#39;s perfect betrayal twist. The first season of Percy Jackson and the Olympians has remained pretty faithful to the original book series, with very few details being changed. Because of this, many fans are expecting one major betrayal to occur in the show&#39;s future, with this heartbreaking twist being one of the series&#39; most memorable moments. This seems to be the case, as Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 is already setting the stage for the Greek gods&#39; role in this betrayal.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 is finally here, with the highly-anticipated adaptation of Rick Riordan&#39;s beloved YA fantasy novels now streaming on Disney&#43;. This isn&#39;t the franchise&#39;s first adaptation, as the failed Percy Jackson movie series already attempted to bring the series to live-action once. After only a few episodes, however, it is clear that the Disney&#43; show is a far better adaptation when it comes to being faithful to the source material. Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 has stuck close to the story of the first book, meaning that one betrayal twist is already being set up.




                  10 Easter Eggs &amp; Hidden Details In Percy Jackson Season 1 Episode 4   Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 4 sees the show’s trio facing the biggest threat yet, and it contains more book and mythology Easter eggs.    


 Percy Jackson Season 1 Is Constantly Questioning The Greek Gods 
         

Since episode 1, Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 has constantly been questioning the Greek gods, with the series not showing the reverence to the gods of Olympus that other mythological stories typically do. Throughout season 1, the Greek gods have been portrayed as vain, lazy, short-tempered, and vengeful, with these traits applying to pretty much every divine deity that has been discussed in the show so far. Even the parents of Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; main characters are portrayed as terrible people, with Percy and Annabeth both being abandoned by their parents. Percy even questions the practice of offerings, showing that everything about Olympus can be criticized.




Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 4 especially shows off how terrible the Greek gods are, with the climactic final battle being caused by the gods. After Percy sends Medusa&#39;s head to Olympus, Annabeth&#39;s mother Athena sends Echidna to kill them. Echidna released a Chimera that hunts Percy, Annabeth, and Grover throughout St. Louis, showing that Athena really wants the kids to die. The worst part is that Athena is only doing this because Medusa&#39;s head embarrassed her, with Athena attempting to kill Annabeth over something that Percy did. So far, Percy Jackson and the Olympians has portrayed the gods as awful.



 The Series&#39; Olympian God Criticisms Are Setting Up The Perfect Betrayal Twist 
          

Percy Jackson and the Olympians is preparing the future of the story in a brilliant way, as the series&#39; criticisms of the gods of Olympus are setting up the perfect betrayal twist. Early in the series, Percy hears a prophecy that a friend will betray him. Fans familiar with the Percy Jackson books know that the traitor is a fellow Camp Half-Blood attendee, Luke Castellan. Luke is contacted by the franchise&#39;s overarching villain Kronos and is convinced to join his side, betraying Percy and the rest of Camp Half-Blood, with this betrayal being a major turning point for the series.




The main reason for Luke&#39;s betrayal of Camp Half-Blood is his disdain for the gods of Olympus, with him hating the gods after a quest goes wrong. Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1&#39;s criticisms of the Greek gods allow the audience to get on board with understanding the flaws of Olympus, something that will make Luke&#39;s betrayal of his friends more understandable. Luke&#39;s betrayal will most likely be unveiled by the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, meaning that it won&#39;t be long until this twist is unveiled.

 How Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Is Making Luke A Better Villain Than The Books 
          




Percy Jackson and the Olympians may not have revealed Luke&#39;s betrayal yet, but the series is already making him a better villain than the books. Percy and Luke have spent a lot of time together, with the duo becoming pretty good friends before Percy&#39;s departure. The series&#39; constant criticisms of the gods will make audiences essentially end up on the side of Luke, even if joining Kronos wasn&#39;t the best way to handle things. There is still a lot of setup to be done before Luke&#39;s betrayal is unveiled, but it will undoubtedly be one of the most shocking moments in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1.
