## Literature Review
Andrew Lincoln played Rick Grimes for nearly a decade on The Walking Dead, and here&#39;s why he decided to leave the show during season 9.




Following actor Andrew Lincoln&#39;s exit from the hit series, the reason given why Rick left The Walking Dead during season 9 ended up setting up much of the rest of the series and beyond. AMC launched The Walking Dead in 2010, a series that remains popular over a decade later. Based on the acclaimed comic series by Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead&#39;s lead role of Rick Grimes was played by Andrew Lincoln. A mainstay from season 1, it seemed inevitable that Rick would be one of the few season 1 TWD characters to stay the course. However, Rick leaving The Walking Dead in season 9 opened up the franchise&#39;s future.




Even for a show like The Walking Dead with its shocking character deaths and an ever-changing cast list, Lincoln&#39;s season 9 exit was a huge shock to viewers. One of the reasons The Walking Dead gained such a big following was the frequency and unpredictable nature of major characters suddenly dying during the zombie apocalypse story — a story told with Rick Grimes as a narrative anchor. Surprisingly, the reason why Rick left The Walking Dead was not due to his character&#39;s death but rather a decision by the actor that left the future of Rick Grimes open — enabling him to return for the TWD finale and upcoming spin-off The Ones Who Live.

By the time season 9 rolled around, Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) seemed to be The Walking Dead mainstays who would last until the end. Rick was there until the end of the story of The Walking Dead comics, so viewers of the AMC show familiar with the source material expected Andrew Lincoln to be a permanent TWD cast member. However, that changed on the TV series during season 9 with his surprising departure — although he did return for one final appearance in The Walking Dead series finale.

As for why Rick Grimes was written out of the show, Andrew Lincoln left The Walking Dead because of his desire to be close to his family. Andrew Lincoln is the father of two young children, and they live in the UK. Since The Walking Dead&#39;s production takes place primarily in Atlanta and lasts several months, Lincoln wasn&#39;t able to spend as much time at home as he&#39;d like. Ultimately, Lincoln realized that, to spend more time with his family, he needed to leave The Walking Dead (via EW):





&#34;I have two young children, and I live in a different country, and they become less portable as they get older,&#34; Lincoln said . It was that simple. It was time for me to come home.&#34;


Regardless of why Rick left The Walking Dead, it proved to be a turning point for the series. Without its biggest character, the show had to turn its focus elsewhere and reinvent the story. The Walking Dead season 9&#39;s six-year time jump coincided with Lincoln&#39;s exit, which allowed the series to show what happened to the core group of characters without Rick around. For the creators, writers, and viewers, Rick Grimes&#39;s departure seemed to be a blessing in disguise. The Walking Dead was well-received afterward and managed to carry itself through to the season 11 finale without the group&#39;s leader.

Rick&#39;s Early Exit Set Up A New The Walking Dead Spinoff
         

Rick&#39;s exit from the series was a reminder of the hero he had always been on The Walking Dead. In the episode, &#34;What Comes After,&#34; a hoard of Walkers headed for the survivors and Rick knew he needed to act fast. With Michonne, Daryl, Maggie, Carol, and his own daughter Judith in danger, Rick did what he thought was best. He sacrificed himself to save his friends and family. Rick blew up the bridge filled with walkers to save those he loved. It was an ultimate sacrifice — except that Rick didn&#39;t die. Jadis showed up in the CRM helicopter, and they took Rick away, and off the show until the series finale.

That made Rick&#39;s reappearance in The Walking Dead series finale so shocking. In the last moments of the series ending, Rick writes a letter to Michonne about both the dead and the living. Rick can be seen on a beach, packing a backpack. He puts his message in a bottle and then throws it into the lake when a helicopter can be heard from off-screen. He quickly throws the backpack into a nearby boat, when a CRM helicopter says via loudspeaker, &#34;Consignee Grimes, you&#39;ve been located and are instructed to surrender.&#34; Rick ends up putting his hands in the air, smiling as the helicopter descends.




Michonne is also alive, racing on horseback to search for Rick after finding evidence that he might still be alive. That is, of course, from the backpack that Rick threw on the boat. It all tied together nicely and that final scene in The Walking Dead sets up the upcoming Rick and Michonne six-episode miniseries, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, set to premiere on February 25, 2024. Presumably, the miniseries will cover Michonne and Rick&#39;s respective journeys to find one another in what Danai Gurira called a &#34;love story&#34; and hopefully give The Walking Dead&#39;s most beloved character a proper ending.

             The Walking Dead Based on one of the most successful and popular comic books of all time, AMC’s The Walking Dead captures the ongoing human drama following a zombie apocalypse. The series, developed for television by Frank Darabont, follows a group of survivors, led by police officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), who are traveling in search of a safe and secure home. However, instead of the zombies, it is the living who remain that truly become the walking dead. The Walking Dead lasted for eleven seasons and spawned several spinoff shows, such as Fear the Walking Dead and The Walking Dead: World Beyond.   Release Date   October 31, 2010    Cast   Steven Yeun , Andrew Lincoln , Chandler Riggs , Laurie Holden , Jeffrey DeMunn , Sarah Wayne Callies , Melissa McBride , Norman Reedus , Jon Bernthal , Iron E.
