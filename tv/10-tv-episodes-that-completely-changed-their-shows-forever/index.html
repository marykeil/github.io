  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Many TV shows have one episode that changed everything. For example, the
How I Met Your Mother
finale retroactively altered the entire narrative, killing off the Mother and opening the door for Ted and Robin.
Doctor Who
was changed for the worse when it revealed the Doctor&rsquo;s mysterious childhood, as the plot point felt messy and uncomfortable.
Chevy Chase&rsquo;s departure from
Community
had a significant impact, causing a decline in quality and the show&rsquo;s future, whereas Charlie Sheen&rsquo;s exit from
Two and a Half Men
allowed for a fresh direction for the sitcom.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While a TV show tends to grow and change with each season, several series can pinpoint a specific episode that caused a significant shake-up.</p>
<p>While there have been plenty of great plot twists on TV, there have also been instances where an individual episode changed its show completely and forever. Whether due to a recasting, behind-the-scenes drama, or a big change to a story, there are many ways a TV show can find itself taking a brand-new path. A significant shift in a TV show can make it either better or worse, and on some occasions, both.
Some episodes might not immediately seem to be important to the future of a show. This can be because the repercussions may have happened behind the scenes, or if it is concerning the plot, it can sometimes take years to reach fruition. Either way, there are plenty of examples of when the power of a single episode completely changed a show.</p>
<p>12 TV Shows That Switched Locations Halfway Through (&amp; What Happened Next)
While it&rsquo;s common for TV shows to stay put in their original location, some series significantly change their locations for better or worse.</p>
<p>10  How I Met Your Mother: &ldquo;Last Forever, Part 2&rdquo;
The series finale killed off the Mother.</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother</p>
<p>Release Date   September 19, 2005    Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   9</p>
<p>The ending of the hit sitcom faced a lot of backlash upon its release, so much so that the production team released an alternate ending to How I Met Your Mother.</p>
<p>Despite it being the very last episode of the show, the How I Met Your Mother finale completely changed the entire narrative of its previous nine seasons. The death of the Mother (Cristin Milioti) came as such a surprise in the show&rsquo;s final moments, and despite a few hidden clues to the Mother&rsquo;s death dotted throughout, it dampened her great love story with Ted (Josh Radnor). Knowing that this huge build-up to meeting the Mother only had a limited span, made the finale almost insensitive.
By killing off Tracy, it, in response, once again opened the door for Ted and Robin (Cobie Smulders). While it had been known for a long time that Robin wasn&rsquo;t the Mother, it made Tracy feel more like a filler for Ted. The ending of the hit sitcom faced a lot of backlash upon its release, so much so that the production team released an alternate ending to How I Met Your Mother.
All episodes of How I Met Your Mother, including &ldquo;Last Forever, Part 2,&rdquo; are available to stream on Hulu.</p>
<p>9  Roseanne: &ldquo;Into That Good Night&rdquo;
The original two-part series finale told viewers that season 9 &ldquo;was all a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roseanne</p>
<p>Release Date   October 18, 1988    Cast   Roseanne Barr , John Goodman , Laurie Metcalf , Sara Gilbert , Lecy Goranson , Michael Fishman    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   10</p>
<p>While it could be considered that Roseanne is a sitcom that ended with the wrong episode, it was the two-part finale of season 9 that really cemented the downfall of the show. The entirety of season 9 was revealed to have been a dream, retconning some huge plot details, including that the Conners had never won the lottery, and Dan (John Goodman) hadn&rsquo;t had an affair and rather had died at the end of season 8. Although Roseanne did return for season 10, with over a decade between installments, the final season of the show once again retconned huge details, and Dan mysteriously rose from the dead.
All episodes of Roseanne, including both parts of &ldquo;Into That Good Night,&rdquo; are available to stream on Peacock.</p>
<p>8  Doctor Who: &ldquo;The Timeless Children&rdquo;
The 10th episode of season 12 revealed the Doctor&rsquo;s mysterious childhood.</p>
<p>Doctor Who</p>
<p>Release Date   November 23, 1963    Cast   Jenna Coleman , Jodie Whittaker , Alex Kingston , David Tennant , Matt Smith , Peter Capaldi    Genres   Adventure , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   26</p>
<p>Despite it seeming that Doctor Who&rsquo;s Timeless Child storyline is now dead, it still completely changed the Doctor&rsquo;s backstory and past for the entire show. The introduction of various other incarnations of the Doctor, in the days before they truly became the Doctor, felt messy and too complicated. It also revealed that the Doctor was supposedly the first ever Time Lord and that the race&rsquo;s regenerative qualities came from scientific experimentation on them as a child. Not only was this plot point complex enough, but the Doctor&rsquo;s vague childhood and how they were treated made the entire concept just a little uncomfortable.
All modern-era episodes of Doctor Who through season 13, including &ldquo;The Timeless Children,&rdquo; are available to stream on Max.</p>
<p>7  Star Trek: &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s Stepchildren&rdquo;
The 10th episode of the original series&rsquo; third season introduced interracial kissing on TV.</p>
<p>Star Trek: The Original Series</p>
<p>Release Date   September 8, 1966    Cast   William Shatner , Gene Roddenberry    Genres    Sci-Fi , Action , Fantasy , Adventure    Seasons   3</p>
<p>While Star Trek has seen many firsts on TV, one particular episode from Star Trek: The Original Series stands out among the bunch. The episode &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s Stepchildren&rdquo; aired in 1968 and is frequently referred to as one of the first interracial kisses on television. The kiss between Kirk (William Shatner) and Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) sparked a huge conversation worldwide upon its initial airing. There was even debate between its cast members whether the filming of the scene actually involved Shatner and Nichols kissing or not.
&ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s Stepchildren&rdquo; was the first instance of one Black and one white actor kissing on-screen.</p>
<p>While the show had previously seen scenes with physical affection between Star Trek: The Original Series cast members of differing races, &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s Stepchildren&rdquo; was the first instance of one Black and one white actor kissing on-screen. Even though the kiss was forced by the power of psychokinesis, there was no doubt that the action would see a huge reception from audiences. Despite the time, the scene was generally well-received.</p>
<p>All episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series, including &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s Stepchildren,&rdquo; are available to stream on Paramount+.</p>
<p>6  The Good Place: &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s Gambit&rdquo;
The season 1 finale revealed that the show isn&rsquo;t set in the Good Place.</p>
<p>The Good Place</p>
<p>Release Date   September 19, 2016    Cast   Kristen Bell , William Jackson Harper , Jameela Jamil , D&rsquo;Arcy Carden , Manny Jacinto , Ted Danson    Genres   Comedy , Fantasy    Seasons   4</p>
<p>The last episode of The Good Place season 1 set up one of TV&rsquo;s biggest plot twists but also redefined the future of the show going forward. In one tense scene, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finally realized that for the entire season, she had been in the Bad Place rather than the Good Place. This was then confirmed by Michael (Ted Danson) with a twisted grin, causing stomach drops and goosebumps all around. With this simple but unspoken moment, the show was completely changed. This moment not only shifted from the previous episodes, with other seemingly minor details clicking into place, but it also built huge anticipation for the next season.
All seasons of The Good Place, including &ldquo;Michael&rsquo;s Gambit,&rdquo; are available to stream on Netflix.</p>
<p>5  Jane The Virgin: &ldquo;Chapter Fifty-Four&rdquo;
Michael died suddenly in the 10th episode of season 3.</p>
<p>Jane the Virgin</p>
<p>Release Date   October 13, 2014    Cast   Gina Rodriguez , Andrea Navedo , Justin Baldoni , Ivonne Coll , Brett Dier , Jaime Camil    Genres   Comedy , Satire    Seasons   5</p>
<p>While Jane the Virgin had many plot twists during its five-season run, the death of Michael Cordero (Brett Dier) was easily its biggest. What makes Michael&rsquo;s death more of a twist is that it was so unexpected. Seeing as the injuries he&rsquo;d sustained and almost died from on their wedding day had seemingly healed, they were the cause of his rather sudden and mysterious death on a random, mundane day. Although the reveal that Michael was actually alive in Jane the Virgin season 4 was impactful and shocking, as it&rsquo;s not uncommon for a character to return from the dead in a telenovela, it wasn&rsquo;t as surprising as his death.</p>
<p>All episodes of Jane the Virgin, including &ldquo;Chapter Fifty-Four,&rdquo; are available to stream on Netflix.</p>
<p>4  Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy: &ldquo;How To Save A Life&rdquo;
Derek Shepherd died in season 11, episode 21.</p>
<p>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</p>
<p>Release Date   March 27, 2005    Cast   Kelly McCreary , Patrick Dempsey , Kevin McKidd , Chandra Wilson , Jesse Williams , Jake Borelli , camilla luddington , Ellen Pompeo , Chyler Leigh , Eric Dane , Caterina Scorsone , Giacomo Gianniotti , Anthony Hill , Kate Walsh , Justin Chambers , Sarah Drew , Greg Germann , Martin Henderson , Katherine Heigl , T.R. Knight , Sara Ramirez , Jerrika Hinton , Richard Flood , Sandra Oh , Kim Raver , Jason George , Tessa Ferrer , Isaiah Washington , James Pickens Jr. , Gaius Charles , Chris Carmack , Brooke Smith , Jessica Capshaw    Genres   Romance , Drama    Seasons   19</p>
<p>The pilot of Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy set up one of TV&rsquo;s best on-again, off-again couples, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). While Meredith and Derek&rsquo;s relationship timeline was long and complex, Derek&rsquo;s death in season 11 was a sudden shock. This plot point also caused double devastation, as it was initially implied that Derek had survived the accident, but it ended with Meredith having to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off her husband&rsquo;s life support. Not only was his death painful enough, but Meredith being forced to be the one to pull the cord was easily more difficult than if he&rsquo;d been killed instantly.
All episodes of Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy through season 19, including &ldquo;How to Save a Life,&rdquo; are available to stream on Netflix. Season 20 of the show premieres in March 2024 on ABC.</p>
<p>3  Two And A Half Men: &ldquo;Nice To Meet You, Walden Schmidt&rdquo;
The first episode of season 9 dealt with the departure of Charlie Sheen.</p>
<p>Two and a Half Men</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 2003    Cast   Charlie Sheen , Jon Cryer , Angus T. Jones , Marin Hinkle , Melanie Lynskey , Holland Taylor , Conchata Ferrell , Ashton Kutcher , Amber Tamblyn    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   12</p>
<p>Two and a Half Men saw a huge change to the show, both on-screen and behind the scenes. The season 9 opening episode was the first story not to star Charlie Sheen, with season 8 having been cut short due to the actor being admitted to rehab. Sheen was fired from Two and a Half Men shortly after this, following comments he&rsquo;d made about showrunner Chuck Loree in several interviews. With plans for the show to continue with more of a focus on Alan (Jon Cryer), who would take more of a lead role going forward, the show started production on season 9.
Kutcher&rsquo;s presence in Two and a Half Men could be considered the reason for what kept the show running past its expiration date.</p>
<p>While there was a Sheen-sized gap in the hit show, rather than recasting Charlie, a brand-new character was introduced. Ashton Kutcher then took Sheen&rsquo;s place in the show&rsquo;s lineup as billionaire tycoon Walden Schmidt, starring in season 9 and a further three seasons until the show&rsquo;s end in 2015. Despite the two characters being different, Kutcher&rsquo;s presence in Two and a Half Men could be considered the reason for what kept the show running past its expiration date.</p>
<p>All episodes of Two and a Half Men, including &ldquo;Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt,&rdquo; are available to stream on Peacock.</p>
<p>2  Community: &ldquo;Advanced Documentary Filmmaking&rdquo;
The sixth episode of season 4 said goodbye to Chevy Chase.</p>
<p>Community</p>
<p>Release Date   September 17, 2009    Cast   Ken Jeong , Chevy Chase , Joel McHale , Jim Rash , Gillian Jacobs , Alison Brie , Yvette Nicole Brown , Donald Glover , Danny Pudi    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   6</p>
<p>While on-screen, &ldquo;Advanced Documentary Filmmaking&rdquo; seems like an average episode of Community, drama behind the scenes caused a significant change to the future of the show. During filming, there were reports of Chevy Chase, who played Pierce Hawthorne, having a racial outburst. Although Chase claims this concerned the direction that the character of Pierce was being taken, the use of insensitive language and slurs caused a lot of upset with other members of the Community cast and crew.
Chevy Chase left Community before season 5, having come to a mutual decision with NBC to walk away from the show after these dramatic events. However, Chase did briefly appear in the season 5 episode &ldquo;Repilot,&rdquo; although this was as a hologram and used as a setup for the character&rsquo;s death just a few episodes later. It could be argued that the show was seeing a decline in quality around this time anyway, so Chase&rsquo;s departure wasn&rsquo;t as impactful as expected.
All episodes of Community, including &ldquo;Advanced Documentary Filmmaking,&rdquo; are available to stream on Netflix.</p>
<p>1  Breaking Bad: &ldquo;ABQ&rdquo;
In the season 2 finale, Walter heartlessly allowed Jane to die.</p>
<p>Breaking Bad</p>
<p>Release Date   January 20, 2008    Cast   Dean Norris , Bob Odenkirk , Aaron Paul , RJ Mitte , Anna Gunn , Giancarlo Esposito , Betsy Brandt , Bryan Cranston , Jonathan Banks    Genres   Crime , Drama , Thriller    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Breaking Bad is another show that had many a plot twist during its time on the air, but the death of Jane (Krysten Ritter) caused a domino effect. Not only did Jesse (Aaron Paul) spiral, with the guilt and loss of his girlfriend destroying him, but watching Jane choke to death was a great example of how Walter&rsquo;s (Bryan Cranston) character was warped by the world of drugs. The man who allowed an innocent woman to die so that he could control Jesse again was very different from who was when first introduced in the Breaking Bad pilot, and even actress Krysten Ritter was shocked by the game-changing death.
However, Jane&rsquo;s death caused more of a ripple throughout the show than was initially apparent. At the end of the episode, the Wayfarer 515 crashed into another airliner, causing the death of 167 passengers aboard both planes. The show later revealed that this tragic accident was caused by Donald Margolis (John de Lancie), Jane&rsquo;s father, who was grief-stricken over the loss of his child, so much so that the grief and guilt over the incident led him to kill himself. These events cemented how deep Walter was in the world of dealing, and proved that there was no going back for the previously mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher.</p>
<p>All episodes of Breaking Bad, including &ldquo;ABQ,&rdquo; are available to stream on Netflix.</p>
