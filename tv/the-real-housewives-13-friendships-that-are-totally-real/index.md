## Literature Review
Many of the alliances between the reality stars on Bravo&#39;s Real Housewives are for the cameras, but sometimes the friendships are real.




The Real Housewives is one of the most entertaining reality series ever, and some friendships on the show are more realistic than others. The show follows groups of affluent women in different parts of the country, navigating their very privileged lives. Everything about the ladies who star on The Real Housewives is extravagant and embellished, including most friendships. Many of the alliances between reality stars are all for the cameras. While plenty of relationships are forged for the show, some of them are authentic. It might interest fans of the hit series to learn that these relationships are tried and true, even when the cameras stop rolling. While plenty of reality television is made for ratings, these friendships are made for real life.




The one winning aspect of any city in The Real Housewives franchise is friendship. The series doesn&#39;t typically end well without depth within the friend group. This is why cities like New Jersey, New York, and Atlanta have some of the best seasons. The friendships among the cast are real, and they continue hanging out even when the cameras aren&#39;t rolling. And while these famous duos have had their ups and downs on and off camera, their bond remains strong outside of Bravo.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Kyle Richards And Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave 
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
         

Plenty is fake in a town like Beverly Hills, but the relationship between reality stars Kyle Richards and former RHOBH cast member Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave is as real as it gets. Their friendship fell under scrutiny in season 10, where the ladies got immature about who was closer to whom. The women refused to engage in the nonsense, only commenting on how quickly they struck up a friendship, and many felt left out. Where some friendships take years to cultivate, theirs happened almost immediately and is still going strong even though Teddi is no longer on the series. Teddi wasn&#39;t the most entertaining former Housewife but her friendship with Kyle sure was.






 Gizelle Bryant And Robyn Dixon 
Real Housewives of Potomac
          

The Real Housewives of Potomac&#39;s Gizelle Bryant and Robyn Dixon are more than just the &#34;green-eyed bandits.&#34; They&#39;re best friends. Despite Gizelle getting into drama with the other women, Robyn always supports and doesn&#39;t go behind her back. The other Housewives of Potomac don&#39;t always keep their bond and have said nasty things about Robyn not being her own person without Gizelle&#39;s influence, but these two ignore the haters and have their own alliance on and off the show. With Robyn&#39;s quiet storylines, most of her iconic scenes on RHOP are shared with Gizelle.



 Dorit Kemsley And Kyle Richards 
Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
         




Kyle Richards may be one of the longest-lasting Housewives on RHOBH, but that doesn&#39;t stop her from making new friends. When Dorit Kemsley joined the series in season 7, the two weren&#39;t instant best friends, but over time, their friendship grew. What helped the two grow closer was actually their husband&#39;s tight-knit bond. Nowadays, the two bicker on TV, but they&#39;re still seen hanging out outside of filming. Kyle has been a pillar of strength for Dorit after strangers broke into her home and stole her belongings.



 Sonja Morgan, Ramona Singer, And Luann De Lesseps 
Real Housewives of New York
          

What makes The Real Housewives of New York so unique is the friendships between the women — primarily Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, and Luann de Lesseps. The three have been longtime friends, even before the show aired. After filming for so many seasons, the threesome has only become closer. The magic of this friendship is that no matter how often they fight, bicker, or bother each other, they always find a way to prioritize their friendship and get over it. Thanks to social media, fans of RHONY see that these three hang out often outside of filming. Additionally, they star in Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip season 4 this winter.






 Teresa Guidice And Dina Manzo 
Real Housewives of New Jersey
         

Teresa Guidice is not exactly known for being a great pal. In her years of appearing on The Real Housewives of New Jersey, the mother of four has run through almost every possible friend. While she struggled to keep friendships intact, one former Housewife still stands by Teresa&#39;s side: Dina Cantin (formerly Manzo). Dina and Teresa had one of the best friendships on RHONJ and have been close with Teresa since the ladies were in their twenties.



 Kenya Moore And Kandi Buress 
Real Housewives of Atlanta
          

Kenya lovingly calls Kandi &#34;Kandi Yams.&#34; Kandi has been one of the few women to accept Kenya for the woman that she is, which was not easy to do. Kenya was seen as the villain in many seasons, but Kandi always stood up for her. The two have been allies in recent seasons of The Real Housewives of Atlanta and genuinely like one another. According to Reality Tea, Kandi said, &#34;Over the years, Kenya and I have really built a real friendship. Like, we really call each other, check on each other.&#34; As Kenya moved through her issues with her ex, Marc Daly, Kandi is one of the women lending support and a shoulder to cry on.






 Denise Richards And Garcelle Beauvais 
Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
          

Denise Richards and Garcelle Beauvais have known one another for a very long time before teaming up on RHOBH. They met over two decades ago while filming an unaired pilot and went on to cultivate a friendship and work in reality television together. Denise was at the center of a scandal involving castmate Brandi Glanville in season 10, leading to her departure. Beauvais stood by her side and defended her. The ladies continue to support and love each other even after Denise&#39;s departure from RHOBH.



 Cynthia Bailey And Kenya Moore 
Real Housewives of Atlanta
          

Kenya and Cynthia have had a rollercoaster friendship over the years on RHOA — sometimes being pals and other times being enemies. Recent seasons have seen the two women grow closer and support one another through babies, marriages, and divorces. So, is the support authentic? When asked about her friendship with Kenya, Bailey told Bravo that Kenya is her friend at the end of the day. Cynthia even asked Moore to serve as a bridesmaid in her wedding to Mike Hill. And while the two have their ups and downs on the spinoff Ultimate Girls Trip, they&#39;re still close.






 Heather Dubrow And Meghan King Edmonds 
Real Housewives of Orange County
          

Meghan King no longer appears on The Real Housewives of Orange County, but Heather Dubrow made a comeback in season 16. Even without Meghan in the series, the two are still friends and going strong outside of filming. Heather and her husband were close with Meghan&#39;s ex-husband, Jim Edmonds, so when he married Meghan, she was instantly brought into the fold. Meghan and Jim went on to get divorced, but the two have remained friends despite that.



 Gina Kirschenheiter &amp; Emily Simpson 
Real Housewives of Orange County
          

Gina and Emily were both new kids on the block together in the OC franchise in season 13, and they quickly buddied up in the tight-knit community of Orange County. Their friendship went through some growing pains, but it appeared stronger than ever in later seasons. Unsurprisingly, the ladies are friends off-camera and on. Most of their iconic scenes on RHOC revolve around their friendship.






 Tamra Judge And Vicki Gunvalson 
Real Housewives of Orange County
          

Anyone who has tuned into the OC installment will say that Tamra and Vicki were two of the most two-faced turncoats in Housewife history, but it&#39;s impossible not to root for their friendship. These two have gone through the wringer as friends but always came out together in the end. The ladies have gone from best friends to worst enemies and climbed their way back to bestie status during their years of appearing on reality television. Most of Vicki&#39;s biggest fights involved her best friend; shockingly, the two are still so close.



 Whitney Rose And Heather Gay 
Real Housewives of Salt Lake City
          




The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City is still reasonably fresh, so there&#39;s room for friendships to grow. One relationship that is shown on the show and is legit in the real world is that of Heather Gay and Whitney Rose. The beautiful blondes are tight on television and support one another offscreen. The pair pose together at functions and support each other on social media. Aside from being true friends, Whitney and Heather are also related. They are third cousins, with Whitney&#39;s great-grandfather and Heather&#39;s great-grandmother being siblings.



 Brandi Redmond And Stephanie Hollman 
Real Housewives of Dallas
          

Brandi Redmond and Stephanie Hollman were lovable, goofy, and loyal, and their television friendship extends beyond what we see on cameras of The Real Housewives of Dallas. The ladies became friends long before they ever appeared on RHOD, and it was great to see them display their affection for each other. The families and pals are friends, making hanging out easy after filming. Brandi supported Stephanie when she struggled with her mental health, and Stephanie was by Brandi&#39;s side as she adopted her son Bruin after facing tragedy. And while RHOD is no longer on air, the two are still friends. They have had a Real Housewives franchise friendship for the ages.
