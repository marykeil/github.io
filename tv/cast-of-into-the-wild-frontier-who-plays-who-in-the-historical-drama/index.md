## Literature Review
The cast of Into the Wild Frontier features some lesser-known actors portraying some of the most famous characters of American folklore.




The cast of Into the Wild Frontier is a mix of TV and movie actors as well as some historians brought in to explain the exciting and real events of the series. Into the Wild Frontier is a historical TV series that uses dramatic reenactments and documentary-style interviews to tell the story of the American West and the frontier culture that developed during the country&#39;s expansion. The series first premiered in February 2022 on INSP, an American cable channel that primarily shows Western movies and TV shows and is available to stream on FuboTV and Sling TV. The third season of the show premiered in May 2023.




Even those Western movies that are close to real-life events tend to alter true events in service of the story. Into the Wild Frontier instead makes a point of being period-accurate with historians, professors, and a narrator. Legendary figures from American history are depicted in reenactments that often go beyond simply posing. There are stakes comparable to any historical drama, and the actors, though many unknown, are adept at portraying real-life figures while adding some interesting personal touches to make Into the Wild Frontier enjoyable for drama and history lovers.
