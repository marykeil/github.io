## Literature Review
It&#39;s almost universally agreed upon that Alan Ritchson is the perfect Jack Reacher, especially since he nails some key Reacher traits from the books.




It&#39;s almost universally agreed upon that Alan Ritchson was well cast in the role of Jack Reacher, and there are some traits from the Reacher books that the actor absolutely nails. Based on Lee Child&#39;s best-selling Jack Reacher book series, the Amazon Prime Video show has proven to be an incredibly faithful adaptation of its source material — at least in the ways that matter. For Reacher devotees, that&#39;s a welcome relief, especially on the heels of Tom Cruise&#39;s not-so-book-accurate portrayal of Child&#39;s titular character. After a much-loved first season, Ritchson returns as the ex-military police officer for another round of day-saving. 
Reacher season 2 adapts Bad Luck and Trouble, the eleventh novel in Child&#39;s long-running series. In the jump to TV, Reacher makes some necessary changes to the book&#39;s plot, but retains elements that are crucial to Jack Reacher&#39;s enduring character. For starters, Reacher is still a self-proclaimed hobo, hopping buses from town to town with nothing but an ATM card, a toothbrush, and the shirt on his back. When one of the members of the 110th, Reacher&#39;s former Special Investigations Unit, is murdered, however, Jack Reacher is ready to knock some heads and unravel a life-threatening conspiracy that puts him at the very center.









 








 10  Jack Reacher&#39;s Fighting Style 
Alan Ritchson&#39;s Reacher Is Brutally Proficient In Hand-To-Hand Combat


 







Jack Reacher actor Alan Ritchson&#39;s television debut was as Smallville&#39;s Aquaman, and, before landing the starring role in Reacher, he played the crime-fighting vigilante Hawk in DC&#39;s Titans. In fact, the actor has appeared in big-name action-packed franchises, from The Hunger Games to Fast &amp; Furious. Even so, Ritchson doubted his fighting skills ahead of playing Reacher. The series borrows from the Jason Bourne school of quick cuts and close-ups, allowing Ritchson to convincingly pull off Reacher&#39;s brutal, fist-filled combat sequences. Even better, Reacher&#39;s best fight scenes often involve the &#34;Big Guy&#34; making use of his environment.





 9  Reacher&#39;s Lack Of Responses 
Alan Ritchson Does Reacher&#39;s Stoicism Perfectly
        

One of the many traits that Ritchson absolutely nails is Reacher&#39;s stoicism. Unlike other action heroes, Jack Reacher doesn&#39;t feel the need to toss out a quip or comeback every time he chats with an enemy. Instead, he leverages his opponents&#39; eagerness to monologue to his advantage. The character&#39;s lack of responses is actually one of the best running gags from the Reacher books, so it&#39;s great to see Amazon Prime Video translate this defining quirk to the small screen. Throughout Child&#39;s books, he often writes the phrase, &#34;Reacher said nothing.&#34; The character thrives in silence — and makes his enemies squirm.





 8  Reacher&#39;s Large Physique 
Alan Ritchson&#39;s Imposing Stature Bests Tom Cruise&#39;s Portrayal


 







When Tom Cruise was cast as Jack Reacher in the 2012 movie adaptation of Lee Child&#39;s One Shot, long-time fans were a little let down. While Cruise might be the lead of ultra-successful action film franchises like Mission: Impossible, he just couldn&#39;t capture Reacher&#39;s imposing stature. Alan Ritchson, who put on even more muscle for the role, is as bulky, broad-shouldered, and tall as the Jack Reacher of Child&#39;s novels. Given that Reacher&#39;s physique is such a defining trait — sometimes, he&#39;s often assumed to be the bad guy in the novels due to his bulk — it&#39;s great to see Ritchson fully embody the character.

 7  Reacher&#39;s Lack Of Remorse 
Alan Ritchson Captures Reacher&#39;s Commitment To Justice — No Matter The Cost
        

At times, Reacher seems like a gentle giant, but when it comes to persuing justice, he doesn&#39;t let anything stand in his way. In fact, Reacher is so committed to doing the right thing that he&#39;ll throw any potential remorse out the window. If anyone messes with his friends or someone who can&#39;t defend themselves, he&#39;ll show no mercy. It&#39;s a reminder of both Jack Reacher&#39;s military backstory and his hard-and-fast moral code. Ritchson captures Reacher&#39;s lack of remorse, all while maintaining the character&#39;s charm.





 6  Reacher&#39;s Acute Skills Of Deduction 
Ritchson&#39;s Ex-Military Man Is Incredibly Observant


 







In comparison to Lee Child&#39;s novels, the show suffers from one glaring disadvantage: viewers don&#39;t get the opportunity to really see inside Reacher&#39;s head. Not only is he a physical force to be reckoned with, but Jack Reacher has excellent skills of deduction. When it comes to investigating crime scenes and conspiracies, his ability to hone in on the details is unparalleled. While that&#39;s harder to portray on screen — and without any internal monologue or narration — Ritchson is able to capture Reacher&#39;s always-thinking character with ease. Even when he&#39;s silently observing, it&#39;s clear that Reacher is running through many outcomes and possibilities in his head.





 5  Reacher Will Do Anything For His Friends 
Alan Ritchson Proves In Season 2 That Reacher Will Put His Life On The Line


 







There&#39;s no doubt that Reacher season 2 proves just how dedicated Reacher is to those he considers friends. In season 1 of the hit series, the ex-MP officer meets a bunch of new allies, including Oscar Finlay and Roscoe Conklin. As the eight-episode season progressed, Reacher proved he&#39;d put his life on the line for his new colleagues. In the show&#39;s sophomore outing, Ritchson gets the chance to show off a little more emotional nuance, especially considering that Reacher&#39;s long-time friends are being targeted. Without teetering into melodrama, Ritchson&#39;s performance illustrates just how much Reacher values those closest to him.





 4  Jack Reacher Is A Man Of Honor 
Ritchson Taps Into His Character&#39;s Military Upbringing
        

A former Army officer, Reacher abides by a strict moral code. However, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll blindly follow orders or trust his superiors because of their rank alone. In fact, he left military life behind after uncovering some hard-to-stomach corruption. Reacher&#39;s moral code may not always go hand-in-hand with the law, but he&#39;s clearly a man of honor. Ritchson taps into this strong sensibility, turning Reacher into a believable protagonist who&#39;s been shaped by circumstances. While the military might be responsible for his strict code, that&#39;s also why he works outside the system.





 3  Ritchson&#39;s Reacher Deeply Trusts Others (&amp; Himself) 
Season 2 Interrogates Reacher&#39;s Convincing Faith In His Friends
        

One of Jack Reacher&#39;s greatest flaws might just be his unwavering trust in those he calls friends. Of course, this stems from his faith in himself. While Reacher is right to trust his gut ninety-nine percent of the time, season 2 hammers viewers over the head with the fact that Jack hand-picked the members of the 110th — and, because of that fact, there&#39;s no chance one of them would betray the team decades later. It&#39;s a flawed approach, but Ritchson fully embraces this aspect of Reacher, convincing viewers that he&#39;s the kind of guy to trust rarely, but, when he does, he&#39;s fully committed.
Ahead of season 2&#39;s premiere, Reacher season 3 was green-lit by Amazon Prime Video. 






 2  Reacher&#39;s Love Of His Drifter Lifestyle 
Lee Child&#39;s Protagonist Is At Home In His Wanderlust
        

As in the books, Alan Ritchson&#39;s Reacher insists he&#39;s a hobo (not a vagrant). His penchant for wanderlust is something novel-Reacher thinks about quite a lot. Not only does his fractured upbringing play into it, but Reacher believes he&#39;s simply predisposed to wandering. The conceit works well given the series&#39; premise, but, in a live-action format, it could be harder to accept an untraceable drifter like Reacher. Thankfully, Ritchson really sells Reacher&#39;s aversion to settling, making it feel more about himself than his fear of getting too close to others.





 1  Reacher Abides By His Rules 
Reacher&#39;s Rules Make Ritchson&#39;s Character Feel Lived-In
        

In Lee Child&#39;s series, Reacher&#39;s &#34;rules&#34; are a crucial element of the character — so much so that Child penned a book about the character&#39;s most famed sayings. From &#34;assumptions kill&#34; to &#34;details matter,&#34; Reacher and the 110th are full of clear-cut advice, and have no problem turning them into rules to live by. Alan Ritchson lends a hand to making Reacher&#39;s rules all-the-more compelling by making the character feel lived-in. Viewers can tell this is a person who&#39;s dedicated to what works — and to sleeping when he can. Hopefully, Ritchson&#39;s spot-on portrayal continues in Reacher season 3.
