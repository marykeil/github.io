## Literature Review
House of the Dragon&#39;s Matt Smith seemingly reveals the release month for season 2, which has not yet had an official premiere date revealed.




House of the Dragon star seemingly reveals the season 2 release month. The Game of Thrones spinoff released its first season in August 2022, introducing the first 10 episodes of the show and the early years of Westeros and centering on the conflict between House Targaryen and House Hightower. House of the Dragon was renewed for season 2 shortly after the season 1 premiere.




Speaking with the BBC on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show, House of the Dragon star Matt Smith may have let the season 2 release window slip, implying it would come out in August 2024. In his interview, Smith was asked to tell the podcast team when the show was coming out. The actor was not definitive in his statement, but responded “August, I think.” Check out the full quote from Smith below:


August, I think, I think summer. This summer, yeah. I’ve not seen any of it yet but we finished last year.



 House of the Dragon Season 2 Production Timeline Explained 
         

While House of the Dragon season 2 has been confirmed for over a year now, HBO has yet to announce a release date for the sophomore season’s commencement. This remained the case even as filming finished up in September 2023, marking the start of post-production for the popular series. HBO has previously suggested that House of the Dragon season 2 would come in summer 2024, but never confirmed when within that large window the show would arrive.




House of the Dragon is rare among upcoming TV shows in that its production was not affected by the strikes that afflicted Hollywood in 2023. The show’s scripts were finished before the WGA went on strike, advantaging them in production. Furthermore, House of the Dragon was able to continue filming during the SAG-AFTRA strikes because the majority of its cast is composed of U.K. actors who were working under local contract rather than a Hollywood union. The ability to film in Summer 2023 gave House of the Dragon an edge over other major shows that were put on pause.

                  House Of The Dragon Season 1&#39;s Ending Change Made Rhaenyra Better (&amp; Season 2 More Exciting)   House of the Dragon made a subtle but important change to the ending of season 1, which had key benefits for Rhaenyra Targaryen and season 2&#39;s story.    

Because of this, releasing House of the Dragon as soon as it&#39;s ready will likely be a priority for HBO as they are forced to adjust their timelines on other shows. While Smith’s statement is far from certain, an August release window would make sense for the series. After all, House of the Dragon season 1 released in August 2022, so an August 2024 release window would mark almost exactly two years since the first season. However, HBO will still have to confirm whether or not Smith’s statement holds true.
