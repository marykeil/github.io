## Literature Review
SyFy&#39;s Resident Alien is returning for season 3, with filming already wrapped, so when will the alien calling itself Harry return to screens?




Resident Alien season 3 is due to arrive on SyFy, and although the release date is still unclear there are plenty of story, cast, and plot details to digest. Debuting on SyFy in 2021, the quirky dramedy stars Firefly’s Alan Tudyk as an alien sent to destroy Earth. Upon crash landing, he assumes the identity of Harry Vanderspeigle, and while living as a human inadvertently experiences emotions. “Harry” decides that he doesn’t want to wipe out Earth after all and would rather spend his life with the townsfolk of Patience, Colorado.




However, just because Harry has renounced his alien invader ways doesn’t mean characters like Linda Hamilton’s General McCallister believe it. Nor are the aliens who sent Harry in the first place pleased with his change of heart. When Resident Alien returns to SyFy with season 3 the story will be taking one of its most interesting turns yet, and since the Alan Tudyk-led show was renewed it’s only a matter of time before viewers can return to Patience to find out what’s next for the alien pretending to be Harry Vanderspeigle.

It has now been confirmed that season 3 of Resident Alien will arrive on February 14th, 2024. The long-awaited season was confirmed back in 2022, but a series of industry delays pushed the show further and further down the line. Now that the delays have been resolved, the truncated third season is arriving sooner rather than later.



 Resident Alien Season 3 Cast 
          

The cast of Resident Alien season 3 is expected to be more-or-less the same as prior seasons, with most of the cast reprising their roles. Alan Tudyk will once again be reprising his role as extraterrestrial interloper “Harry Vanderspeigle”. Linda Hamilton (The Terminator) will also be back as General McCallister, who’ll be reportedly playing a prominent role in season 3 and is now one of Harry’s allies. The trailer confirmed many returning cast members, and the voice of George Takei is heard as one of the Grey Aliens.




Beyond this, the returning cast for Resident Alien season 3 is confirmed to include:

 Actor  Resident Alien Role   Sara Tomko  Asta Twelvetrees   Alice Wetterlund  D&#39;Arcy Bloom   Corey Reynolds  Sheriff Thompson   Elizabeth Bowen  Deputy Baker   Levi Fiehler  Mayor Hawthorne   Meredith Garretson  Kate Hawthorne   Judah Prehn  Max   Gary Farmer  Dan Twelvetrees   Enver Gjokaj  Joseph Rainer

 Resident Alien Season 3 Plot 
          




The climax of the preceding season saw Harry and General McCallister put aside their differences and work together in the face of a much greater existential threat - the impending invasion of the Greys. However, despite the sci-fi elements of the Resident Alien plot gaining momentum in the third season, creator Chris Sheridan has been clear that the story of the town of Patience and its residents will still be at the heart of the Resident Alien season 3 plot.

Many of the residents of Patience have learned of Harry’s extraterrestrial origins by the end of season 2, and this will likely have ramifications in Resident Alien season 3. The sinister Joseph Rainer was last seen interviewing for a job as the Sheriff’s Deputy at the end of season 2, and this is also bound to be a big plot point when the Resident Alien season 3 release date arrives on SyFy.

The trailer for Resident Alien season 3 was released in January 2024, and it offers a clear picture of what to expect in the new episodes. The invasion of the Greys is continuing as planned and Harry has made it his mission to stop them from destroying the planet. The trailer also shows off Linda Hamilton&#39;s return as General McCallister who will clearly play a much larger part in the upcoming episodes. Though shortened, Resident Alien season 3 is already shaping up to be the biggest yet.
