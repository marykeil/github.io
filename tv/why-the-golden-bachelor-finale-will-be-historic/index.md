## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale will be historic from Bachelor Nation as Gerry Turner chooses between Theresa Nist and Leslie Fhima. 




The Golden Bachelor finale will air next week and be historic for The Bachelor franchise and fans. Lead Gerry Turner narrowed down his search for love from 22 senior women to just two. Theresa Nist and Leslie Fhima are Gerry&#39;s two choices, and each has formed a different kind of connection with Gerry. Gerry, 72, will have an emotional decision to make as Theresa, 70, or Leslie, 64, will have their heartbroken.




Gerry and Theresa bonded over the loss of their spouses and have been able to have a deeply caring and supportive connection. With Leslie, she has had a troubled past with love, and Gerry wants to make Leslie feel nurtured and safe. Gerry was also in love with his third runner-up, Faith Martin, and he met her family during the hometown visits. Faith was shattered by Gerry&#39;s decision, and the two had a tearful reunion during The Women Tell All. As Gerry&#39;s ultimate decision looms on the finale of The Golden Bachelor season 1, fans have a lot to look forward to.
