## Literature Review
There&#39;s plenty to learn about The Bachelor season 28, including when it premieres, lead Joey Graziadei, and the 32 women who&#39;ll compete for his heart.




The Bachelor season 28 has been announced by ABC, and there are many details to know about it. The Bachelor premiered in 2002 and has become one of the most popular reality dating competition shows. Its spin-offs, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, are also highly successful. In addition, The Golden Bachelor was a huge hit, with lead Gerry Turner marrying Theresa Nist in a live television event. Other franchise series have included Bachelor Pad, The Bachelor Winter Games, The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart, and The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons Ever!




Regarding successful marriages, The Bachelor is the least successful series in the Bachelor franchise. Only one lead, Sean Lowe, married the woman he proposed to on the show, Catherine Giudici. Two other couples, Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell, and Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar, are currently together. Matt and Rachael have been dating since they reconciled after his season in April 2021. Zach and Kaity have been engaged since he proposed during his finale, which aired in March 2023. It&#39;s time to share facts about The Bachelor season 28.

 The Bachelor Season 28 News 
          




As predicted, a contestant from The Bachelorette season 20 starring Charity Lawson was chosen as the next official Bachelor. In August 2023, it was announced that Joey Graziadei would be the star of The Bachelor season 28.

One of the most significant changes to The Bachelor in season 28 is the exit of show creator Mike Fleiss. Mike announced his departure from the franchise the day after The Bachelor season 27 aired in March 2023. Claire Freeland, Jason Ehrlich, and Bennett Graebner will take his place as franchise executive producers and show-runners. Although Mike has been associated with the Bachelor franchise for over 20 years, he hasn&#39;t been involved in the day-to-day operations of the shows in about ten years.

Still, many blame Mike for the problematic issues with the shows. In addition, former Bachelorette Kaitlyn Bristowe has accused Mike of hating women. It will be interesting to see what, if any, changes happen with The Bachelor season 28 now that Mike is no longer part of the franchise.

                  The Bachelor: Joey Graziadei Is The Lead Bachelor Nation Actually Wanted   Joey Graziadei from The Bachelorette has received much love and support from fans after being announced as the lead of The Bachelor season 28.    



 The Bachelor Season 28 Lead 
         




In August 2023, it was announced that Joey from The Bachelorette season 20 would be the star of The Bachelor season 28. Joey was Charity&#39;s runner-up, and he had his heart broken when she chose Dotun Olubeko instead of him. Charity and Dotun got engaged during the season finale. Joey&#39;s vulnerability and sensitivity led him to be cast as the next Bachelor.

Joey is a 28-year-old tennis pro originally from Collegeville, PA, currently living in Koloa, HI. His date of birth is May 24, 1995, and his astrological sign is Gemini. Joey is very close to his family, including his parents, Cathy and Nick, his sisters, Carly and Ellie, his brother-in-law, Zach, and his Uncle Joe, all of whom viewers met during The Bachelorette season 20. When Joey was in kindergarten, his dad came out as gay. Joey told Charity that this made him &#34;more loving and accepting.&#34;

According to Joey&#39;s ABC bio, after graduation, when he realized that the corporate world wasn&#39;t for him, he moved to Hawaii. He relocated there to pursue his passion for teaching his favorite sport, tennis. Joey spends his days on the court and his evenings on the beach watching the sunset with his friends. He&#39;s a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan, an avid star gazer, and lists golf and country music as his recent obsessions. Joey can be found on Instagram at @joeygraziadei.






 The Bachelor Season 28 Cast 

 

The Bachelor season 28 cast features 32 women of various ages from all around the United States and Canada. The first Bachelor season 28 contestant to be revealed, Lea Cayanan, met Joey during The Bachelorette season 20 &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; episode. She was given an envelope, which she was instructed not to open until premiere night. In addition, two sisters--Allison and Lauren Hollinger--will compete for Joey&#39;s heart. According to Parade, Joey&#39;s cast members are:

  Allison Hollinger, 26, Philadelphia, PA   Autumn Waggoner 26, St. Louis, MO   Chandler Dewgard, 25, New York, NY   Daisy Kent, 24, San Diego, CA   Chrissa Perez, 26, Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada   Edwina Dorbor, 25, Atlanta, GA   Erika Cardenas, 25, North Bergen, NJ   Evalin Clark, 28, San Antonio, TX   Jenn Tran, 26, Hillsdale, NJ   Jessica Edwards, 24, San Diego, CA   Katelyn DeBacker, 25, Santa Fe, NM   Kayla Rodgers, 27, Hamilton, OH   Kelsey Anderson, 25, New Orleans, LA   Kelsey Toussant, 31, Los Angeles, CA   Kyra Brusch, 25, Miami, FL   Lanie Latsios, 27, Philadelphia, PA   Lauren Hollinger, 28, Philadelphia, PA   Lea Cayanan, 23, Los Angeles, CA   Lexi Young, 30, Atlanta, GA   Madina Alam, 30, Charlotte, NC   Maria Georgas, 28, Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada   Marlena Haddad, 26, West Palm Beach, FL   Natalie Crepeau, 25, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada   Rachel Nance, 26, Rancho Cucamonga, CA   Samantha Hale, 30, Nashville, TN   Samantha Washington, 25, Miami, FL   Sandra Rabadi, 26, Nashville, TN   Starr Skyler, 25, Delray Beach, FL   Sydney Gordon, 28, Newport, RI   Talyah Jackson, 23, Huntington Beach, CA   Taylor Wiens, 23, Chicago, IL   Zoe Antona, 23, Roswell, GA  




In addition to the cast members, Jesse Palmer will return as the host.

The Bachelor season 28 will most likely follow the same format as previous seasons. However, with a significant behind-the-scenes shake-up after Mike&#39;s exit, there&#39;s a good chance that the show&#39;s overall atmosphere could change. Zach&#39;s season saw a shift away from drama, with more of a focus on the love stories. Hopefully, with a man like Joey as the season 28 lead, the season will end with an engagement. One thing is sure: The Bachelor season 28 has the potential to be the most romatic (and, of course, dramatic) yet.



The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
