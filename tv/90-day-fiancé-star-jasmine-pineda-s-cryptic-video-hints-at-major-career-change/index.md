## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is making big moves after coming to America. She is launching a new brand soon but hasn&#39;t revealed many details.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda has found a new money-making gig since moving to America to get married to Gino Palazzolo. Jasmine, who is from Panama, was divorced and a mom to two sons, Juance and JC, when she met Michigan resident Gino online. Jasmine and Gino were in a long-distance relationship for several months before they met in person in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. While Jasmine did not agree with Gino forwarding her private photos to an ex and always wanted him to prioritize her over his family, they still got engaged, and Jasmine moved to the U.S.




Jasmine has been making herself comfortable in the United States since moving to Canton in early 2023, and her Instagram Stories reveal she has also found a new way to make money.

          

Jasmine recently posted a photo taken from an airplane window, which she captioned, “Business trip! Good things are [in] the making.” Jasmine added the hashtags &#34;veganprotein&#34; and “jazzyfitness.&#34; Moreover, Jasmine later posted a video saying she had a photo shoot planned for “something” she was working on. “But I’m not gonna say anything until I have everything ready,” she added.

 What Job Did Jasmine Pineda Do Before 90 Day Fiancé? 
          

Jasmine was waiting for her makeup artist to arrive to help with her photos for her new business. However, she told her followers that she was “gonna be quiet.” Jasmine admitted she was “dying to tell” them, but they will eventually learn what she&#39;s working on. “It’s a very personal project,” Jasmine explained. She said it was a dream that she was shaping into reality. Jasmine later posted a behind-the-scenes photo from the photo shoot with her makeup artist and photographer posing next to her while again adding the hashtag &#34;#veganprotein&#34; and a GIF that said, “Coming soon.”


 




Jasmine used to work as an English literature teacher and a private tutor when she lived in Panama. She once told Gino that she made $3,000 a month. Jasmine still relied on Gino for her cosmetic procedures and her hair and nails. She wanted Gino to pay her rent as she decided to stay in a luxurious apartment before coming to the U.S. Jasmine claimed she lost her job when the private photos that Gino shared with his ex somehow reached her employer. Jasmine blamed Gino for her unemployment. Meanwhile, she began earning via platforms such as Cameo and OnlyFans after launching her reality TV career.

Jasmine continues to earn money via her online jobs. However, she had expressed an interest in real estate before she came to America. It appears Jasmine has let her dream real estate agent job take a backseat now as she’s focused on being a businesswoman in a different endeavor. Jasmine could be waiting for 90 Day Fiancé season 10 to conclude so she can finally launch her new business while confirming that she’s now married to Gino and is allowed to work legally in the U.S.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
