## Literature Review
Below Deck reprising chief stew Fraser Oldener spent his New Year&#39;s Eve hanging out with another notable and popular chief stew from the franchise.




Below Deck chief stew Fraser Olender shared a picture from his New Year&#39;s Eve festivities where he was hanging out with another notable and popular franchise chief stew. Fraser first appeared on Below Deck season 9, where he was second stew under chief stew Heather Chase on Captain Lee&#39;s boat. He excelled and had notable moments and was asked back to be the chief stew himself on Below Deck season 10. Now, Fraser is poised to reprise his Below Deck chief stew role in season 11, which looks like it will be very eventful with a lot of workplace drama.




Fraser spent time with Below Deck Sailing Yacht chief stew Daisy Kelliher on New Year&#39;s Eve. Daisy has been the chief stew under Captain Glenn Shephard for three straight seasons now. To showcase his night involving Daisy, Fraser shared an Instagram Story.

 Will Fraser &amp; Daisy Maintain Their Below Deck Chief Stew Positions? 
         

Fraser and Daisy&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve hangout signals that the pair have a friendship. It could also mean that the two department heads plan to continue running things within the franchise because they&#39;re not trying to separate themselves from the Below Deck spotlight and shared notoriety. Daisy has been widely praised for her witty personality and strengths as an effective chief stew, and she&#39;s brought the drama, most recently with her love triangle between Gary King and Collin MacRae. Similarly, Fraser has proven himself to be funny and an entertaining leader.

Fraser will once again get the time to shine as he is set to be the chief stew on Below Deck season 11 under Captain Kerry Titheradge. He has already won the favor of fans, but his role as a department head is rather new, and he is still figuring out how to be an effective leader and deal with difficult personalities and interpersonal conflicts that have arisen. Daisy was spotted filming with Gary King in Ibiza, Spain, over the summer, which means she will be returning for Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 5. Daisy&#39;s work performance waned in season 4 and her personal life was a mess, so she has a lot to prove in the upcoming season.






Below Deck season 11 premieres on February 5, 2024, at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
