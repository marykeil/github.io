# The Simpsons Characters In Live-Action Art Get A Major Glow-Up (&amp; Look Surprisingly Normal)


## SUMMARY 



  The live-action AI art of The Simpsons showcases impressive accuracy for some characters, like The Comic Book Guy, while others, like Principal Skinner, are barely recognizable.   Patty and Selma, as well as Apu, receive positive transformations in the art, resembling characters from a moody A24 thriller and appearing cool and aged down, respectively.   Although the live-action art highlights the fun that can be had with AI, it also suggests that a live-action adaptation of The Simpsons may not be necessary due to the charm and unique form of the animated series.

## Literature Review
Live-action versions of The Simpsons look surprisingly normal in new AI art, with some characters like Marge getting an impressive glow-up.




Live-action versions of The Simpsons look surprisingly normal in new art, with some characters getting an impressive glow-up. Given that the television staple has been around for decades, it&#39;s been rendered in different animation styles and its characters have been utilized and spoofed in various ways. But one idea that&#39;s never found much traction is the idea of transporting The Simpsons into the world of live-action.




Ahead of The Simpsons season 35, a showcase posted on the Midjourney subreddit by user Crows_HeadIC offers a glimpse of what a live-action Simpsons project might look like, highlighting a variety of main and supporting characters from Homer and Marge Simpson to Mr. Burns and Apu.


 

The showcase is kinder to some characters, imagining what seems to be a younger version of several supporting players that look more modern.

The Art Ranges From Lifelike To Zany
          

Some of the characters in The Simpsons live-action showcase look impressively accurate to the cartoon version, such as Comic Book Guy. The same is true for Homer, while others like Marge are more loosely-inspired. Meanwhile, some, like Principal Skinner, are hardly recognizable at all. The art imagines the characters as young and smoldering, giving them a glow-up that doesn&#39;t match the source material.

But some changes are for the better. Patty and Selma look ready to star in a moody A24 thriller. The same is true of Apu, who looks aged down and quite cool. But while The Simpsons live-action art highlights the fun that can be had with AI, provided with the right prompt and the human touch of creativity, it also points to why a live-action take on the popular animated series shouldn&#39;t happen — and likely why there hasn&#39;t been a lot of movement in that direction.

Live-Action Simpsons Are Fun As Art - But Won&#39;t Work As A Movie
         

This is far from the first time that someone has created art of what The Simpsons&#39; characters and settings might look like in live-action. In September 2023, a reddit post imagined The Simpsons as a live-action horror, perfect for a star-studded gory movie. Another AI art prompt led to the Simpsons family as they would appear in a Wes Anderson movie - including some big-name celebrities and the director&#39;s iconic use of color. 

While images like these are fun to look at, part of the charm of The Simpsons is rooted in its form. If it were to be taken out of animation, there would have to be a strong story and hook to support it rather than just a group of actors resembling their cartoon counterparts. But as the series itself continues to take risks and attempt to reinvent itself, perhaps there could be an episode that deals with live-action if the story is strong enough.
