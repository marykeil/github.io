<p>Summary</p>
<p>The Brothers Sun is a Netflix action-comedy series with martial arts, family drama, and comedy elements mixed together.   Michelle Yeoh leads the cast as Eileen Sun, the wife of a triad leader who moves to Los Angeles with her son Bruce. Bruce&rsquo;s life takes a drastic turn when his father is attacked, and his older brother Charles comes to protect the family.   Sam Song Li, who plays Bruce, discusses his excitement about landing the role and working with Michelle Yeoh. He also talks about his improv experience and the dynamics between his character and his family members in the show.</p>
<p>Nearly two years after its initial announcement, action comedy The Brothers Sun is finally landing on Netflix. The 8-episode season was created by Brad Falchuk (one of the minds behind Glee, American Horror Story, and Scream Queens) and Byron Wu, and it manages to be a mix of martial arts action and family drama with a sprinkle of comedy throughout. Michelle Yeoh leads the cast, playing Eileen Sun, the wife of an intimidating triad leader who has left Taiwan behind to live in Los Angeles with her son Bruce (Sam Song Li).</p>
<p>Eileen&rsquo;s day-to-day family life undergoes a huge upheaval, however, when her husband is attacked by an unknown assassin. The plot of The Brothers Sun takes off when her eldest son Charles (Justin Chien) makes his way to the U.S. to protect the family, setting off a chain of events that changes Bruce&rsquo;s future forever. Before his sibling reunion, Bruce is an improv-loving theater geek who lives in fear of having to become a doctor as his mother wishes, having no idea that he should instead fear the bloody triad life that he&rsquo;s been sheltered from up until now. The show also stars Highdee Kuan, Joon Lee, and Jon Xue Zhang.</p>

<p>Screen Rant interviewed Sam Song Li about booking his first major television role with The Brothers Sun, building the complicated family dynamic with Justin Chien and Michelle Yeoh, and learning action work secondhand despite not being directly involved in many fight scenes.</p>
<p>Sam Song Li Talks The Brothers Sun</p>
<p>Screen Rant: How did you react when you found out that you got the part, and now Michelle Yeoh is your mom?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: I found out when I was at Disneyland. I was in line for a ride. I was in line for Splash Mountain. So I was already at the happiest place on Earth, and it just made my day even happier. It was even better. It was probably one of the best days of my life, I think, when I found out because this is something that I had been trying to work towards my whole life. This is a dream come true. So it was really special to get that call. But I will say, they played a prank on me.
Apparently, they did this to Justin as well, who plays my brother, but they called me and they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Sam, we just want to thank your time and thank you for coming in. We thought about it a lot and we had to make some tough decisions.&rdquo; It was just really stoking in the moment. And I&rsquo;m just like, &ldquo;Okay, just tell me I didn&rsquo;t get it. All right, you could just thank me for my work. I&rsquo;ll go back to auditioning again.&rdquo; Then they were like, &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, yeah, Sam, we really liked what you did, but, but after thinking about it a lot, and there&rsquo;s a lot of decision-makers here… We want to offer you the part.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Why did you tell it to me like this?&rdquo; And Kevin&rsquo;s response, who&rsquo;s the executive producer and director, is like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more fun that way.&rdquo; So, yeah, they really got me there.</p>
<p>I love the element of being an improv kid for Bruce. As a theater kid myself, it was really fun to see that side of him. How much improv experience do you have and what was it like tapping into that part of him?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: Well, it&rsquo;s really interesting that you asked that because I, at the time, didn&rsquo;t have as much improv experience, but I was making comedy videos online, and I made a lot of them at the time. All throughout the pandemic, I was filming these comedy sketches where a lot of times I would be improving. And so, I think a lot of those skills sort of translated during the audition process, but also, it was just very easy for me to be comfortable making comedic choices and bold choices during that process.
Also, when I was filming the show, I actually took Groundlings classes in preparation for the show for Bruce, who is a Groundlings actor. So it was a lot of fun to really explore that in depth. And there&rsquo;s a lot of nuance to, actually, all of the acting schools, all of the improv schools. When it comes to UCB or Groundlings, they have different styles. So it was really interesting to kind of balance all of that, but I really liked it. And I think “yes and,” is a huge part of the show, a part of Bruce&rsquo;s character, but I also think it&rsquo;s a great way to tackle life, to live life. It makes life so much more exciting, and I think that&rsquo;s why Bruce does so well throughout The Brothers Sun. He just, yes-ands everything no matter how crazy it is.</p>
<p>Bruce and his mother&rsquo;s relationship is so fascinating, a very different kind of mother-son dynamic than we might be to seeing and certainly than his brother is used to seeing. Can you talk about building that relationship with Michelle on set and then, just how Bruce feels being so separate from everyone else in his family?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: It&rsquo;s so easy because it&rsquo;s Michelle Yeoh, so I just felt like it came really naturally. Who she is as a person, actually, is very inviting. She has a very inviting aura, a very maternal aura, not just to me, but to anybody on set. She really treated everybody like they were her own kids, and that was really special for me to witness, and also get to experience as an actor.
But it is interesting because I have a lot in common with Bruce, including the fact that I was also raised by a single mom who took care of me and raised me alone. And so, I think, even that first day on set when I was with Michelle, I just kind of pictured my own mom, and I think it was very easy, it was very, very easy to really get comfortable and build that dynamic. It came very naturally luckily.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he barely knows his father and brother. How much do you think that he questioned the status quo before his brutal introduction to the Jade Dragons in this show?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: That&rsquo;s a good question. Actually, I&rsquo;m not quite sure. I definitely know as an actor, I had questions about what I was thinking about it, and that&rsquo;s actually what&rsquo;s so cool about working with Byron and working with Brad is that when I have questions like these, they&rsquo;re really good at encouraging and figuring out answers for me.
I think there was even one line that made it into the show about Michelle talking about how he thinks that his father is a gambler. And that was actually a conversation that I had with Byron to talk about what did I think of my dad, of my brother. So I think he is clueless in that sense. But also, Michelle&rsquo;s character, Eileen, is such a master puppeteer, and so, she&rsquo;s really good at selling anything she says. So I think she did a great job of fooling me into never really questioning these things.</p>
<p>When Charles and Bruce meet again, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re practically strangers, but you and Justin have a really nice chemistry that builds over the course of the season that feeds into what the show is giving us. Can you talk about bouncing off each other on set?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: Absolutely, yes. Justin Chien is phenomenal. He is so much more, he has so much more to offer as a person than what we see as Charles. And something that I found really fascinating even before we had started working with each other when we just got to hang out and meet for the first time was that he grew up in a family with brothers, and I grew up in a family with a sister, so we both had siblings and so, there is this playful element of this sibling rivalry that you kind of feel in the show, there&rsquo;s undertones of it. And I think that both came very naturally to us because we both experienced what it&rsquo;s like to have siblings.
It was very easy to bounce off him. And he&rsquo;s a phenomenal actor and an even better person. He&rsquo;s so giving, so encouraging, and something that he doesn&rsquo;t get enough credit for because we know him as the badass Charles Sun who brutally murders multiple people, but what&rsquo;s great about him as a person is he&rsquo;s actually very funny and he has great comedic chops in my opinion. He&rsquo;s a very fun person to be around and does great impressions, and he&rsquo;s always making everybody laugh. So he&rsquo;s really fun and a really great person to work with.</p>
<p>Bruce is more of a lover than a fighter probably, but he is present for countless fight scenes by the end of the season. What&rsquo;s it like to be on the fringes of those moments? And did you learn any martial arts or any stunt choreography through osmosis?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: Through osmosis, yes. But it&rsquo;s so funny because I feel like everybody in the show is so badass, right? They&rsquo;re doing all kinds of martial arts. And I remembered talking to the stunt coordinators who are wonderful, they&rsquo;re really awesome, the people over at 87eleven, I believe, some of the people worked on John Wick and Day Shift, a bunch of other great action pieces, but I was so excited to jump in, I&rsquo;m such big fans of the work, and I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Cool. Okay, cool. How do I get started? I want to get involved.&rdquo; And they were like, &ldquo;No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You should stay over there because the less you know, the better it plays.&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a good point. That&rsquo;s a good point.&rdquo;
They were really encouraging for me. Even though they asked me if I had martial arts experience, have I had these experiences, which I do. I&rsquo;ve taken martial arts classes in the past and definitely have dabbled in that. They were really encouraging of me to actually stay away from it because I felt like it built contrast, a lot of contrast to Bruce and what he represents and getting tossed into this cool kung fu, martial arts world. I stayed away from that, but I&rsquo;m glad they were very open to me doing my own stunts. And I think it helped that I did come from an athletic background where they were very encouraging of me to go ahead and do my own stunt sequences, even though they weren&rsquo;t necessarily a fight, more like running away.</p>
<p>I love what you said before about Bruce being a yes-and person, but that can be difficult when both his mother and brother want him to say “yes and,” to very different things. Can you talk about that dynamic of being pulled in different directions, neither of which is necessarily what he wants to do?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: Yeah. Bruce is struggling with those choices a lot. And I think this is what&rsquo;s great about the show is the theme of making your own choices, the power of your own choices. And there was a lot for me to actually draw from my own personal experience because my own mom, actually, it&rsquo;s not surprising, but she really didn&rsquo;t want me to pursue acting and the arts because there was really no, at the time when I really wanted to get involved, which is about 10 years ago, there was really not a flourishing industry that I think we see now, especially when it comes to diversity and stuff on screen.
My mom was very discouraging of me because here&rsquo;s the thing about Asian moms is they just want the best for you, but they&rsquo;re going to be very passionate about how they want the best for you. And sometimes, it can be very overwhelming, and I think Bruce has a sense of that, but also, Bruce trusts his mom. So that internal conflict is what I feel makes Bruce such an interesting character, and by the end of it, he has to make his own decisions and he has to make his own choices. And I think that&rsquo;s what creates so much chaos in the show is the way he goes about making those choices.
I guess that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so fun about the character of Bruce; he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily do the right thing or the wrong thing. And this show does a great job of portraying what is right or wrong. The lines are blurred. It&rsquo;s not black and white, it&rsquo;s a whole gray world that they live in. So, it&rsquo;s really fun to just explore the nuances of that</p>
<p>Brad Falchuk is a monster creator, working on Glee, American Horror Story, and even 9-1-1: Lone Star. What was the most important takeaway that you had from being under his and Byron Wu&rsquo;s tutelage?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: I&rsquo;ll tell you a story. I met Brad and Byron in the audition process, but the first time, this was after I had been offered to play Bruce Sun, I had a meeting with Brad and Byron. And Brad just said one thing, he was like, &ldquo;Listen, we just need two things from you, okay, as an actor. We just need two things. We do these two things, you are fine, that&rsquo;s your job, you&rsquo;re done, you don&rsquo;t have to do anything else, it&rsquo;s be on time and know your lines, and that&rsquo;s it.
I was like, &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;ve never really thought about it like that. I guess there&rsquo;s so much more that I was thinking about, but it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Hey, you know what? I get what you&rsquo;re saying because it&rsquo;s like I feel like we&rsquo;re all here for a reason. There&rsquo;s been a very elaborate, selective process for how they want to go about choosing the characters. And we&rsquo;ve gotten to a point where I think as long as I show up on time and know my lines, we&rsquo;re going to have something.&rdquo; So I think it was very relieving in that way, and I think that was also very humorous to hear in that perspective.
But on top of that, all jokes aside, he is a very collaborative person. And I think the faith and the flexibility for me to be my own person and be my own artist and make my own choices was very freeing and I think, all you can ask for as an actor, that&rsquo;s all you can hope for. So I think they made that process very, very fun for me in that sense. And it felt very collaborative, and I felt like I was really able to contribute to this in a very personal, creative way of being able to bring my own flair into this character and to the show.</p>
<p>Season 1 leaves me being like, &ldquo;Well, Season 2 can come now, so we can do more of this.” What aspects of the family, Bruce, or just the world in general, would you like to explore if we get to come back around?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: Man, there&rsquo;s a lot of ways I could answer that question, but I think the plot is going to thicken for everybody. We got a chance to see what Big Sun is up to, but I feel like now we get to really see what the Jade Dragons are like and dive into that. I would love to see more elements of where Bruce can go too, because we get a taste of what he&rsquo;s like when he gets the confidence to make bold choices. But what if he gets pushed into a corner? What if we get to explore him going down a darker path? Think about that.
I think he has real potential to have his own Breaking Bad moment. Which would be interesting because he&rsquo;s so sweet. Season 1, episode 1? Bruce is such a sweet, adorable, cute kid. What happens, though, if he is really in the thick of it?</p>
<p>You’ve gotten a little taste of action, and a little taste of comedy with this first really big TV role. What would you like to step into next? Are there any genres you want to tackle?</p>
<p>Sam Song Li: I think being a part of The Brothers Sun has been a dream come true because this checked off every single box I could have asked for as an actor. I tell my friends this, if I retire from acting tomorrow, I never book a single role, I will be fully happy and content because I feel like this project has done it all. It&rsquo;s so genre-bending, there&rsquo;s so many different elements. And so, I feel so blessed to have been able to be a part of this process. I feel like I&rsquo;ve experienced everything an actor could ever possibly have wanted to experience.
But with that aside, I consider myself a hopeless romantic. I think romance and love is a very big part of my life. I&rsquo;m on a quest to find the love of my life, and so, I would love to explore more in that department. I think doing a rom-com would be really awesome. I feel like I have a lot to give. One of my favorite films of the year was Past Lives. I think doing something in that genre would be a real treat.</p>
