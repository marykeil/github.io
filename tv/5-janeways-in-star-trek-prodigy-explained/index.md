## Literature Review
Star Trek has a whole host of Janeway variants, and Prodigy season 1 added four new versions of the beloved Voyager captain to the canon.



Fans of Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) were treated to five different versions of the character in Star Trek: Prodigy season 1. Going into Prodigy, Janeway fans knew that Kate Mulgrew was playing a holographic version of her historic Star Trek captain. However, there was a big surprise in the Star Trek: Prodigy mid-season cliffhanger when the real Vice Admiral Janeway was revealed to be hunting down the stolen USS Protostar in the search for the missing Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran).
However, these two versions of Janeway were just the start of the alternate versions of the Star Trek: Voyager character. The nefarious plans of the Diviner (John Noble) and body swap shenanigans toward the end of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 created some other Janeway variants. These five Prodigy variants now sit alongside Janeway&#39;s evolved salamander self, the &#34;silver blood&#34; biomimetic duplicate, and the multiple alternate timeline versions of the beloved Voyager captain.

 5  Hologram Janeway in Star Trek: Prodigy 
The series regular Janeway
        

Hologram Janeway was designed to accompany Captain Chakotay in Star Trek: Prodigy on his mission back to the Delta Quadrant. This holographic recreation of Janeway had been programmed with a love of both coffee and dogs, and also had the memories of her family back on Earth. After the USS Protostar was discovered beneath Tars Lamora, Hologram Janeway was activated and became a mentor to the young Prodigy crew. Because she believed Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray) and his fellow youngsters to be Starfleet Academy cadets, Hologram Janeway taught them how to operate the USS Protostar&#39;s systems and instilled in them the values of the Federation.
After Holo-Janeway discovered that Dal and the Protostar crew were actually fugitive slaves from the Tars Lamora prison colony, she continued to tutor them. She also gained command privileges from Dal. Tragically, the Living Construct&#39;s attack on Starfleet forced Hologram Janeway to sacrifice herself to save the crew of the Protostar and her real-life namesake. Piloting the USS Protostar away from the fleet, Hologram Janeway left a final gift; a temporal anomaly that could lead Starfleet to the whereabouts of Captain Chakotay and his missing Protostar crew.





 4  Evil Janeway Vision On Murder Planet

In Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, episode 3, &#34;Dream Catcher&#34;, the crew of the USS Protostar explored a mysterious &#34;murder planet&#34; which was located in the Hirogen system. It contained a superorganism that would use various enticing visions to ensnare and consume unfortunate travelers. One of these visions was the sinister version of Hologram Janeway that tried to convince Dal to stay on the planet. The shapeshifting superorganism was part of the planet itself, made up of vegetation and tied together by roots. Dal was unconvinced by the illusory Janeway and quickly dispatched the vision with a blast of his phaser.




 3  Evil Hologram Janeway Who Served The Diviner

Hologram Janeway was an unwitting pawn in the Diviner&#39;s plot against Starfleet in Star Trek: Prodigy. Unknown to Hologram Janeway and the crew of the USS Protostar, the Diviner had added a failsafe to ensure that the ship would always return to Federation space. In Prodigy season 1, episode 17, &#34;Ghost in the Machine&#34;, it was revealed that Hologram Janeway had used the command codes to redirect the USS Protostar to the Terran system. Hologram Janeway was given these command codes when she trapped the crew in the holodeck to retake control of the Protostar. Horrified at what she had done, Hologram Janeway deactivated herself, until she was reawakened by the real life Vice Admiral Janeway in the following episode, &#34;Mindwalk.&#34;

 2  Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway In Star Trek: Prodigy 
The original Janeway hunted the Prodigy crew in season 1.




Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway led the search for the USS Protostar in the second half of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1. In command of the USS Dauntless, Janeway pursued the Protostar and its young crew from Tars Lamora to the Romulan Neutral Zone. Janeway became fascinated with the crew of the Protostar when she discovered that the starship thieves were actually just a group of kids that were out of their depth. After a body swap enabled Janeway to discover the truth about the Diviner&#39;s plot and the Living Construct, she teamed up with the crew of the USS Protostar to save Starfleet from destruction.
After her holographic replica sacrificed herself to save both Starfleet and her young charges, Vice Admiral Janeway spoke up for the Protostar crew at a tribunal. When Starfleet refused to accept Dal into the Academy due to his genetic augmentations, Janeway stood by the youngster. In the Star Trek: Prodigy finale, Vice Admiral Janeway commissioned the young Protostar crew as warrant officers for a new mission. It&#39;s now known that Vice Admiral Janeway&#39;s warrant officers will be serving aboard the USS Voyager-A, on a mission to rescue Chakotay and the crew of the Protostar from the alternate future in which they&#39;re stranded.




 1  Dal&#39;s Mind In Admiral Janeway&#39;s Body

A crucial moment in Vice Admiral Janeway&#39;s turnaround in her opinion on the Protostar thieves was when she swapped bodies with Dal R&#39;El. Her prejudices and assumptions were challenged by the time she spent with the youngsters, and it&#39;s for this reason that they&#39;ll be vital members of her crew in Star Trek: Prodigy season 2. While Janeway learned about the Diviner&#39;s plot against Starfleet, Dal had to convincingly inhabit the body of a middle-aged Starfleet admiral. Unfortunately, Dal&#39;s attempts to impersonate Janeway only led to him being confined to sickbay and deemed medically and mentally unfit for command.
A repentant Diviner ultimately helped Dal/Janeway escape from sickbay, allowing him and the Vice Admiral to swap minds once again. While Dal and Janeway were swapped back into their respective bodies, the Vice Admiral still had to deal with the fallout of the body swap aboard the USS Dauntless. She was taken to the brig for reckless and borderline criminal behavior, seriously impacting her ability to warn Starfleet about the Living Construct. Now that Dal and Janeway have spent some time in one another&#39;s heads, they should have a fascinating dynamic in Star Trek: Prodigy season 2.
All episodes of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 are streaming now on Paramount&#43;.
