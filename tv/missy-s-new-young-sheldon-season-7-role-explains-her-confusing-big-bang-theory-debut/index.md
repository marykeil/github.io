## Literature Review

Missy has a new role in Young Sheldon season 7, and it explains the confusing way that The Big Bang Theory debuted her all the way back in 2008.




Young Sheldon season 7 gives Missy a new role, and it explains the confusing way she debuted in The Big Bang Theory. It has been 16 years since Sheldon&#39;s sister was introduced in the nerd-centric sitcom. As fraternal twins, there was an expectation that she would be like his socially-inept brother, which couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Despite only appearing in two The Big Bang Theory episodes, Missy made an impression that makes her one of the more interesting characters in Young Sheldon. Unfortunately, the prequel hasn&#39;t always appreciated what she brings to the table.




Countless times over its run, Missy proved that she was the best Cooper family member. She is kind, witty, and funny, not to mention emotionally and socially capable. That said, she strayed in Young Sheldon season 6, which introduced her rebellious storyline. After being regularly ignored by her parents, she acted out, even trying to run away from home at one point. The near-death experience during the Medford tornado in the Young Sheldon season 6 finale seemed to have shaken her enough to promise redemption.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Hints It&#39;s Fixing A Controversial The Big Bang Theory Crime   Young Sheldon season 7&#39;s trailer strongly suggests that it will fix a controversial crime against The Big Bang Theory&#39;s version of Sheldon Cooper.    


 The Big Bang Theory Missy Is No Longer Angry At Sheldon 
          

Missy seems to be sticking to her promise as the prequel starts its final year. As confirmed by the official Young Sheldon season 7 synopsis, she will step up in light of Mary&#39;s absence and on the heels of the Medford tornado. Missy getting an expanded role by having the opportunity to show off her ability to take on bigger responsibilities. Aside from being a way to make up for her crimes in season 6 while ensuring that she doesn&#39;t get sidelined anymore, this explains Missy&#39;s change of heart about Sheldon when she was introduced in The Big Bang Theory.




After years of catering to her brother, Missy finally got fed up with Sheldon in the Young Sheldon season 6 finale. Granted that the boy genius was only looking at her best interest, Missy&#39;s anger was also mixed with all the pent-up grudge from all the years that her parents catered to him. When they reunite in The Big Bang Theory, however, she no longer has any animosity towards him, and taking on Mary&#39;s role in the Young Sheldon season 7 premiere may have kickstarted her shift to become more patient and forgiving with his socially incapable brother.



 What Happens To Missy After The Big Bang Theory 
          

Missy had limited appearances in The Big Bang Theory for several reasons. The last time she was on the show, however, she was pregnant with her second kid while also in the middle of separating from her husband. Old Sheldon&#39;s narration in Young Sheldon revealed that Mary eventually got re-married, had more kids, and is living a happy life with her family. Granted that the prequel didn&#39;t get into specifics about who her second husband is, but knowing that life turned out great for her, despite some rocky patches, is a major relief.
