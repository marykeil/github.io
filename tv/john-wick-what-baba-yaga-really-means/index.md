# John Wick What Baba Yaga Really Means


## SUMMARY 



  John Wick&#39;s nickname, Baba Yaga, inaccurately refers to him as the &#34;Russian boogeyman,&#34; causing confusion for those familiar with the real Baba Yaga from Russian folklore.   While John Wick and Baba Yaga do not share many similarities, the use of the nickname adds to the distinct vibe and lore of the John Wick franchise, contributing to its success.   Baba Yaga has been referenced in various other media, including The Witcher and Hellboy, but John Wick has become practically synonymous with the name in popular culture.

## Literature Review

Basil Iwanyk and Derek Kolstad’s John Wick franchise gives the titular assassin the nickname &#34;Baba Yaga&#34; but doesn&#39;t feature its actual origins. 




Basil Iwanyk and Derek Kolstad’s action thriller franchise John Wick follows Keanu Reeves&#39; titular and stylish assassin feared throughout the Russian criminal underworld as Baba Yaga — John Wick&#39;s nickname — which supposedly means boogeyman. The first installment in the franchise followed John Wick as he comes out of retirement to take revenge on the men who have killed his dog. Daisy, the dog, was an unexpected final gift from John’s late wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) — and the entire underworld is terrified at the mere prospect of the &#34;Baba Yaga&#34; returning.




By killing Daisy, the assassins trigger John&#39;s rage-fuelled revenge spree across all four John Wick movies, leading to the tragic conclusion of John Wick 4. Throughout John Wick, Keanu Reeves&#39; titular assassin is described in mythic terms. He lurks behind shadows and appears when he must seek revenge for the wrongdoings of others, with every weapon John Wick uses further cementing his legendary reputation. Ultimately, his past gave him the Baba Yaga nickname, but its true meaning is deeper than simply meaning John&#39;s the criminal underworld&#39;s boogeyman.

                  John Wick: Chapter 5 - Confirmation, Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Despite being confirmed, John Wick: Chapter 5 is one of the most mysterious - and uncertain - upcoming movies, as the John Wick 5 news so far shows.   


 The Russian Witch Named Baba Yaga 
John Wick&#39;s Nickname Came From A Russian Folklore Legend
          




The John Wick franchise is actually wrong about Baba Yaga being the &#34;Russian boogeyman.&#34; This has been a source of confusion for people who are familiar with the name, as well as fans who dedicate time to understanding John Wick&#39;s surprisingly extensive backstory. The real Baba Yaga’s roots and origins in Russian folklore create an even deeper meaning to John Wick, which makes it surprising that the franchise was not as attentive to this detail to strengthen the story.

Baba Yaga is not the &#34;Russian boogeyman&#34; at all, she is a different being altogether. That said, considering John Wick&#39;s kill count, the Baba Yaga is not that different from the modern-day assassin. In Russian folklore, Baba Yaga is a witch who lives in a disheveled home that stands on chicken legs. The &#34;real&#34; Baba Yaga lures children into her home to devour them. She surrounds her home with the human remains of her victims. Baba Yaga has been mythologized as living in this world and the next, appearing anywhere at will without warning — just like John.

 The Baba Yaga John Wick Nickname Is Part Of The Franchise&#39;s Success 
John Being The Boogeyman Of The Mob Is One Of Many Worldbuilding Gems
          

If John Wick&#39;s nickname was truly referential to the boogeyman, he would be called a Babay. The term translates to “a boogeyman,” not a particular individual, but one of many. Moreover, Baba Yaga is a nickname that might be better suited for a member of John Wick&#39;s High Table — someone with the personality and influence that actually matches that of the Russian witch.

In fact, save for their penchant for murder, John Wick does not share any other similarity with Baba Yaga — he is not malevolent nor does he seek to harm the innocent. On the contrary, he wants revenge on those who have done wrong. The use of Baba Yaga in the John Wick franchise is confusing and a bit unnerving if his character is based primarily on his nickname.





 

Despite these problems with the John Wick Baba Yaga nickname, the fact is that it&#39;s part of what makes the franchise successful. Much like many of the small-yet-stylish details in the world of John Wick, John Wick&#39;s nickname is a four-syllable story on its own, directly connected to the affairs of the Continental, the Russian mob, and the existence of the High Table. These elements come together to provide the distinct vibe and concrete lore that differentiate John Wick from any other action movie franchise in recent history.

As John Wick franchise creator and screenwriter Derek Kolstad explained (via Bulletproof Screenwriting):


&#34;What&#39;s been great in developing John Wick, too, is we love John Wick, you know, I mean, he was the Baba Yaga. He was the devil. And there may be a bit of that still inside of him. But there&#39;s something about that you love, you know.&#34;

 The Baba Yaga In Other Media 
The Russian Folklore Witch Has Been Referenced In Many Movies And Shows
         

Though John Wick might be the most famous character associated with Baba Yaga, she has long lingered in the zeitgeist. For instance, Baba Yaga is the primary inspiration for The Witcher&#39;s Deathless Mother, also known as Voleth Meir. Not only did Voleth Meir&#39;s hut have basilisk legs — similar to Baba Yaga&#39;s chicken-legged house — the incantation to get into Voleth Meir&#39;s hut is also the same as the one for finding Baba Yaga&#39;s. Another version of Baba Yaga also exists in The Witcher video games.




Meanwhile, in the 2019 Hellboy reboot, the main antagonist is an extremely horrifying version of Baba Yaga that is much closer to the Russian myth — a twisted spirit that commands ancient magics and manipulates others for her own malevolent ends. Baba Yaga&#39;s influence can even be traced back to the seminal Dragon Ball saga, particularly through Master Roshi&#39;s sister Fortuneteller Baba Saga, who is loosely based on the mythic witch. While these interpretations are much more faithful to the real Baba Yaga, the fact is that, today, John Wick is practically synonymous with the name.

              John Wick: Chapter 4  R Following the events of Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick Chapter 4 will see the titular character battle against some of his most dangerous foes yet. With a bounty on his head that continues to skyrocket, John decides to take the fight to the High Table on a global scale and battles across areas like Osaka and Paris to wipe out some of the strongest players in the underworld.     Release Date    March 24, 2023     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Hiroyuki Sanada , Clancy Brown , Scott Adkins , Keanu Reeves , Ian McShane , Bill Skarsgard , Laurence Fishburne , Rina Sawayama , Donnie Yen , Lance Reddick , Shamier Anderson     Runtime    169 minutes     Studio(s)    Lionsgate     prequel(s)    John Wick , John Wick: Chapter 2 , John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum     Franchise(s)    John Wick
