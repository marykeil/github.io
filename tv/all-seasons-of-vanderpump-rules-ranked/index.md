## Literature Review
Vanderpump Rules is a hit Bravo reality show that follows the lives of SUR servers and friends. Here&#39;s how its eight seasons stack up.




Vanderpump Rules is one of the best reality TV shows, and it’s been a wild ride since the series began in 2013. Over the past decade, the cast members have dated each other, cheated on each other, and much more. While every show fan has their favorite moments and cast members, some seasons are better than others overall. Ever since the notorious Scandoval cheating scandal occurred, the show as reached new heights, leading the SUR crew getting renewed for Vanderpump Rules season 11.
While the show started rather fascinating, it took a while to hit its stride, and, like many long-running reality television series, it’s struggling to continue with the same momentum as earlier seasons. However, season 10 switched this up, and there&#39;s renewed excitement for Vanderpump Rules season 11. This list looks at all the seasons of Vanderpump Rules and ranks them leading up to the best of them all. Which are the best and worst seasons?









 








 Season 7 
Vanderpump Rules
        

Unfortunately, Vanderpump Rules season 7 was probably one of the most boring seasons as the contestants are getting older and more settled. One of the most significant flaws of this season is that instead of seeming relatively real with minimal acted scenes or influences from producers, it felt very produced. It looks like the cast has a lot more say now that they’ve become reality TV stars, and they seem to be controlling more of the narratives of themselves on the screen. Sadly, this means that fans&#39; expected dramatic moments were lacking this time.





 Season 9 
Vanderpump Rules


 







Unfortunately, season 9 was a mixed bag. While there were some excellent moments, the season lacked its usual energy and humor. Stassi and Kristen were also missed, as they were central figures in previous seasons. While it offered a deeper look into the cast&#39;s lives, catering to viewers who prefer character development over dramatic clashes, it also received criticism for its shift away from the show&#39;s original formula and the loss of beloved cast members.





 Season Eight 
Vanderpump Rules
        

Vanderpump Rules season 8 was better than seasons 7 and 9, but the show struggled. Season 8 switched things up, with Bravo bringing in some new faces. While some new blood is needed, knowing how they will integrate always takes some time. Luckily, the show picked up significantly by season 10.





 Season Four 
Vanderpump Rules
        

Season 4 was good, but there are just other seasons that stand out a little more. Where season 5 had the Katie and Tom wedding and season 6 included Jax cheating on Brittany, it’s a little hard to remember season four. A lot of the relationships were in flux at this point. One of the worst things about this season was seeing so many women, especially Katie, slut-shame Lala. This was a transitional season. While it was dramatic, it just wasn’t quite there.





 Season Five 
Vanderpump Rules
        

Season five wasn’t the show&#39;s worst, but it wasn’t the best, either. This season gave audiences iconic moments like Tequila Katie and the Scheana/Shay divorce. While there was a lot of drama this season, it suffered because almost everything was just a lead-up to Katie and Tom’s wedding.
While these two clearly should not have been getting married at the time, Vanderpump Rules then tried to change the narrative at the very end to make it seem like they were having a romantic wedding that was the marriage of soul mates. But, this season will always be the one that gave fans a scene of Tom and Tom kissing and Kristin and Brittany hooking up.





 Season One 
Vanderpump Rules


 







Vanderpump Rules season 1 holds a decent spot on the list because it was the one that started it all. But, as with almost any series&#39; first season, it took a little while to build that momentum. The cast was messy and dramatic right from the get-go, and the fact that all the prominent cast members were close friends and dating each other drew everyone in. The first season isn’t higher on the list because it was still figuring itself out at this point.





 Season Six 
Vanderpump Rules
        

While season 6 might be later, it was explosive and fascinating to watch. It gives a couple of the early seasons a run for their money. This season was full of iconic moments from Vanderpump Rules, such as “It’s not about the pasta,” so it’s better than season seven. The drama was in ample supply this season. This is because it centered so much on Jax cheating on Faith, and that one horrible thing led to so much drama this season. It also featured Stassi dating her awful boyfriend Frank, and that’s just to scratch the surface of the drama.





 Season Three 
Vanderpump Rules
        

The third season of Vanderpump Rules is one of the most iconic, as it was when the show had a ton of energy and drama. No one had learned how to try and censor their issues on television at this point, so the cast was doing one wild thing after another. Stassi was still at the height of her mean-girl status, and this season was filled with many hilarious moments related to Scheana’s wedding. Almost every cast member was full of messy drama in season 3, which is what the fans were looking for at the end of the day.





 Season Two 
Vanderpump Rules
        

With all the iconic and memorable moments from the series, it was season 2 that had the most iconic of them all. This is the season where Kristen and Jax admitted to sleeping together, and everything was pandemonium. This was when the core cast of Jax, Stassi, Katie, Tom, Tom, and Kristen were at their peak. Friends drama, fights, cheating scandals, and more were off the charts. Some new revelations were revealed every week. While it might have been over the top, it was clear that, for the most part, these people were being themselves, and there was something so enthralling about that.





 Season 10 
Vanderpump Rules


 







Season 10 of Vanderpump Rules brought the show back from the brink. A potent blend of explosive betrayal, personal growth, and heartwarming milestones replaced the repetitive SUR shenanigans. The Scandoval saga, fueled by Tom Sandoval&#39;s infidelity, shook the very foundations of the friend group, igniting fiery confrontations and emotional breakdowns. Amidst the turmoil, Raquel Leviss emerged from the shadows, navigating newfound confidence and a surprising connection with Schwartz.
Scheana Shay, finally finding love with Brock Davies, defied expectations with a secret elopement and a dreamy Mexican wedding. This season wasn&#39;t just about drama but about reckoning, forgiveness, and moving forward. The result? Record-breaking ratings and a renewed passion for the show prove that Vanderpump Rules can still surprise and captivate its devoted audience even after a decade.
