Summary

  Adaine Abernant has overcome her past challenges and is in a better place in Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year.   She may have fewer setbacks with her anxiety with her parents no longer in the picture.   Adaine may develop new relationships and further explore her future and identity outside her parent&#39;s shadow.  





Dimension 20 star Siobhan Thompson teased how Adaine Abernant will be in a better place in Fantasy High Junior Year after facing down her demons in the first two seasons. Adaine Abernant has faced many challenges in her tenure at Aguefort Adventuring Academy, but with the help of her friends and supportive educators, she has managed to overcome them. In the first season, Adaine&#39;s anxiety is diagnosed and taken seriously after being dismissed for years. Adaine finally faced down her abusive parents in Sophomore Year.




In an interview with Screen Rant for Dimension 20: Burrow&#39;s End, Thompson also touched on Fantasy High Junior Year. She teased how Adaine will be dealing with the aftermath of facing her demons in the first two seasons. Thompson also compares Adaine to her Burrow&#39;s End character Jaysohn, explaining how she is a bit more similar to him than before. Check out Thompson&#39;s full quote below:


Siobhan Thompson: It&#39;s so fun to be playing [Adaine Abernant] again, especially now, I feel like a lot of her biggest issues have been resolved. It was kind of... I&#39;m trying to frame this in a way that isn&#39;t spoilery, but it was nice to play this character. She&#39;s in a better place this season. I think Adaine in Junior Year is a little bit closer to Jaysohn, just a scooch, just an inch or two, in that she maybe isn&#39;t over analyzing everything and that anxiety is at a lower point, and so she can maybe interact with people in a way that&#39;s a little healthier for her.






 What Adaine Abernant Can Explore In Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year 
         

Fantasy High Junior Year can explore a new side of Adaine Abernant. In the first two seasons, she confronted the abuse she suffered at the hands of her family and stepped into her own as the Elven Oracle. Now, she and her friends have an opportunity to move past the nightmares they were forced to face as they prepare for the future after Aguefort.

  0:40                       Brennan Lee Mulligan Reveals What Inspired Dimension 20 Fantasy High Junior Year &#34;I Couldn&#39;t Stop Dreaming About It&#34;   Exclusive: Brennan Lee Mulligan teases silliness and how his dreams inspired the long-awaited new season of Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year.    

While Adaine will undoubtedly continue to deal with her anxiety, she may have fewer setbacks with her parents no longer in the picture. Comparing her to Dimension 20: Burrow&#39;s End Jaysohn is an interesting clue that could point to her using her instincts a bit more. While Adaine often overthinks her actions, which can heighten her anxiety, Jaysohn was a character that very much acted solely on instinct, not thinking beyond what he was doing in the moment.




However, Adaine may find new struggles as she begins to think about her future after Aguefort, what will happen with The Bad Kids, and how much her life has changed. Thompson discussing how Adaine may be interacting with more people could point to her developing more relationships outside of The Bad Kids. Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year is an opportunity to further flesh out Adaine as she fully embraces her future and discovers who she is outside her parent&#39;s shadow.
