## Literature Review
The Frasier reboot season 1 ends on a high note for Frasier Crane, but it leaves several questions about his past and future unanswered.



The Frasier reboot season 1 properly wraps up Frasier Crane&#39;s first year back in Boston, but it also leaves several questions unanswered that season 2 must address. After years of trying to get the revival off the ground, Kelsey Grammer has successfully brought the beloved snooty psychiatrist back on the small screen, with a brand-new mission in life — reforge his connection with his grown-up son, Freddy. Inspired by the original Cheers spinoff, the Frasier reboot grounds its premise on the complicated relationship between the father and son, but it also features other smaller storylines, especially in light of Frasier&#39;s new life in Boston.


Admittedly, coming back to Boston poses major risks in storytelling, considering the character&#39;s history with the city. However, aside from leaning on Cheers nostalgia, it also separates him from his family and friends in Seattle, effectively explaining Niles and Daphne&#39;s absence in the Frasier reboot, while also putting him in proximity with his son. Only time will tell if these creative choices will pay off, but while Paramount&#43; has yet to officially renew the revival for season 2, there&#39;s an expectation that Grammer and his Beantown ensemble will return for at least one more year, giving it time to tie all loose ends that its debut year has left hanging.

After his stint in Cheers, Frasier Crane&#39;s family became a more prominent factor in his life — something that remains the same in the Frasier reboot.




 8  Are Frasier and Freddy Now In Good Terms? 
Frasier and Freddy share an emotional moment in the Frasier reboot season 1 finale.



Frasier and Freddy&#39;s relationship is the most important storyline in the Frasier reboot, so it makes sense that there&#39;s a considerable focus put on developing their story. While it&#39;s patterned from Frasier and Martin&#39;s own dynamic in the original show, there are some differences, most obviously that it isn&#39;t as contentious and argumentative. Throughout the revival, the pair has gone through several conflicts. Despite this, they still always manage to reconcile. In the Frasier reboot season 1 finale, however, it seems like the pair has finally fully reconciled, making it curious if they are finally past their issues. If so, it&#39;s curious how that impacts Frasier season 2.




 7  Will Niles and Daphne Ever Visit Boston? 
Niles and Daphne have several reasons to come to Boston.
        

David Hyde Pierce has been vocal about his decision not to return for the Frasier reboot, even though Grammer personally invited him and Jane Leeves to reprise their roles as Niles and Daphne. The revival ensures that they remain relevant in the series, not just because of their relationship with Frasier, but also due to the involvement of their grown-up son, David, who is also based in Boston attending Harvard. Because of these, it&#39;s curious if the couple will ever find their way to the city, even for a visit in the Frasier reboot season 2. Narratively, there isn&#39;t really anything stopping them from doing so.




 6  Will Frasier Get Professorship At Harvard? 
Frasier is severely underqualified to teach at his alma mater.
        

On the heels of his stint in Chicago, Frasier doesn&#39;t really need to work in Boston because of his expanded wealth hosting Dr. Crane. He could have enjoyed retirement and focused on taking care of Freddy, which seems to be his priority. However, hesitant to be a bum and motivated by his desire to hone the next generation of thinkers, he takes on a visiting lecturing gig at Harvard despite being severely underqualified. Regardless, Frasier shoots his shot at a Harvard professorship — he is denied by Provost Sharma, but that doesn&#39;t mean that he cannot try again in the Frasier reboot season 2.



 5  Will Freddy and Eve Become A Couple? 
Freddy and Eve could be the new Niles and Daphne.
        

One of the fresh element in the Frasier reboot is the relationship between Freddy and Eve as friends who bond over their shared grief of losing their loved one. Despite that, there remains a hint of romance in their dynamic — something that even executive producers Chris Harris and Joe Cristalli admit to. While different from Niles and Daphne, their circumstances could make Freddy and Eve the Frasier reboot&#39;s modern take on the will-they/won&#39;t-they trope, but considering the show&#39;s limited run compared to a traditional broadcast, season 2 could be the perfect time to decide on their fate.

Kelsey Grammer&#39;s Frasier may have more Emmy wins, but its parent series, Cheers will always be better than the Seattle-based spin-off sequel. 




 4  What Happened To Cheers In The Frasier Reboot? 
Sam&#39;s underground pub is supposedly still open.




When it was confirmed that the revival was going to be set in Boston, there were immediate questions about whether Frasier would visit his old drinking hole in the city — Sam Malone&#39;s Cheers. After Frasier&#39;s first 10 episodes, however, it&#39;s clear that he has no intention of stepping back into the underground pub. Behind the scenes, Grammer has mentioned that the writers of Cheers seemingly didn&#39;t want them to revisit Sam&#39;s iconic pub. However, with the insinuation from Cheers and original Frasier co-writer Ken Levine that Sam&#39;s bar is still open, the Frasier reboot season 2 must confirm whether this is true canonically.




 3  Why Did Charlotte Break Up With Frasier? 
Frasier and Charlotte were together for more than a decade.
        

Given how much time passed since Frasier&#39;s move out of Seattle to his return to Boston, a lot happened in his life. While the Frasier reboot doesn&#39;t dwell on the past, it offers information about what he was up to until his reunion with Freddy, including the end of his relationship with Charlotte. As it turns out, the pair was together for more than a decade, but just around the time when Frasier decided to leave Dr. Crane, Charlotte also chose to leave him. The fact that Frasier never proposed may have been a factor, considering how long they had been together, but the Frasier reboot season 2 needs to give an official reason for their break-up.





 2  How Did Martin Die? 
Martin&#39;s legacy looms over the Frasier reboot.
        

Grammer was clear about the Frasier reboot honoring the legacy of the late John Mahoney as Frasier&#39;s father. Inspired by the actor&#39;s demise, the revival opens with the confirmation that the Crane patriarch recently passed away. Throughout its run, Martin&#39;s impact on his son remains evident without letting his demise bog down the series. Freddy often discusses his grandfather&#39;s memory with his dad, but the reason for Martin&#39;s death has never been revealed. It can simply be due to old age, but the Frasier reboot still needs to establish what caused the massive family loss.





 1  Will Frasier Finally Find A New Love Interest? 
Frasier needs his life partner.
        

Frasier&#39;s love life has always been part of his personal arc — both in Cheers and the Seattle series. Given this, it only makes sense the revival also tackles it, especially on the heels of his break-up from Charlotte. It floats the idea that he can get together with some familiar faces, including Lilith. Meanwhile, it seems like a Frasier and Roz romance makes more sense now than during their time working at KACL. In the original Frasier, he dated so many women in 11 years, but given the nature of streaming, it may be best that Frasier reboot season 2 already sets up the arrival of Frasier&#39;s eventual life partner.
