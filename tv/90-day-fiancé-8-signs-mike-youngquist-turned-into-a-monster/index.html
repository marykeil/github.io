While Natalie&rsquo;s often seen as the villain, Mike isn&rsquo;t innocent. He did many things to provoke her during their relationship.
Mike chose to display a Confederate flag in his home, showing his problematic side.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Mike Youngquist used to seem like a nice guy, but now he&rsquo;s gone to the dark side. Is Mike a monster? He&rsquo;s done some bad things.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Mike Youngquist rose to fame due to his turbulent relationship with his now-ex Natalie Mordovtseva, and he&rsquo;s done some shady things on and offscreen. These days, he&rsquo;s showing off a new love interest and Mike seems to be smitten. However, he doesn&rsquo;t have the best track record. While he&rsquo;s gushing about his girlfriend now, if she crosses him, he might change his tune. Scorpios are notoriously vengeful and Mike was born under this sign. If he isn&rsquo;t happy, he will sting.
90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Natalie is considered the villain, but Mike isn&rsquo;t exactly innocent. He did a lot of things to provoke his ex while they were together. Then, he let her get ripped apart by fans. To this day, Natalie gets tons of shade. While she leans into the villain role, knowing that it helps her to earn money and stay relevant, she didn&rsquo;t deserve all the blame for what went wrong in their relationship.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Mike Youngquist Had A Confederate Flag Scandal
90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Mike Youngquist&rsquo;s Chose Offensive Home Decor</p>
<p>The Confederate flag shouldn&rsquo;t be displayed. It references years of oppression. It&rsquo;s a symbol that needs to die forever. However, Mike flouted his &ldquo;good ole boy&rdquo; image when he showed off the racist flag at home. What an awful misstep from a man who&rsquo;s clearly intelligent enough to know better. Of course, people were going to notice that he chose this unfortunate item to display at home. While TLC blurred the flag, perhaps to try and protect Mike (or maybe to avoid backlash from viewers), fans were able to figure out what it was.
There&rsquo;s just no excuse for choosing this type of decor. It showed a new side of Mike that was really problematic. The charitable view is that he doesn&rsquo;t fully understand what &ldquo;the Stars and Bars&rdquo; represents. However, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that he&rsquo;s that obtuse. It&rsquo;s more probable that he understood everything and put the flag in his home anyway.</p>
<p>7  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Mike Youngquist&rsquo;s Kooky Views Annoyed Natalie Mordovtseva
Mike Youngquist Believes In UFOS &amp; He&rsquo;s An Atheist</p>
<p>Natalie from Ukraine&rsquo;s a traditional person. She wanted Mike to be just the same. However, his views are quite modern. While a lot of people are atheists and this really can&rsquo;t be considered kooky, Natalie clearly thought that it was. Mike&rsquo;s belief in alien life forms also disturbed her. Sometimes, Natalie seems very childish. She&rsquo;s not the most open-minded woman.
On the face of it, Scorpio Mike and Cancer Natalie were a great match. Cancers are nurturing people who are considered ideal partners for intense Scorpios. However, Natalie has all the glaring flaws of his sign, including its biggest pitfall - immaturity. While they were together, Mike was a busy person. He had a good job and a long commute. When he got home, he wanted to eat a steak, drink a beer and relax. Natalie was constantly whining about everything, from the temperature in his home to his eating habits and penchant for booze. She was the ultimate killjoy.</p>
<p>6  Mike Youngquist Let His Mom Tear Natalie Mordovtseva Apart
Trish Youngquist Called Natalie A &ldquo;Cheating, Scammin&rsquo; Snake&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trish didn&rsquo;t exactly appreciate her daughter-in-law. Natalie&rsquo;s quirks upset her and Trish wasn&rsquo;t shy about expressing her disapproval. Onscreen, she&rsquo;s really unloaded on Natalie, calling her a, &ldquo;cheating, scammin&rsquo; snake.&rdquo; That wasn&rsquo;t the only time she put down Natalie. When she called Natalie a &ldquo;whore,&rdquo; she really went low.
Sure, 90 Day Fiancé in-laws from America are often extremely skeptical of their adult kids&rsquo; international partners, but that&rsquo;s no excuse for hurling this type of verbal abuse. Trish had valid concerns about Natalie but expressed them in the nastiest, tackiest ways. What makes Mike a monster is the fact that he let this go on. He should have put a stop to it, or tried to.
Usually, the apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree, so maybe Mike and his lowbrow mom are a lot alike. Whether Mike&rsquo;s going full redneck by brandishing the Confederate flag or 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Trish Youngquist is implying that Natalie will do almost anything for cold, hard cash, the mother-son duo are extra trashy. No one expected elegance, but come on.
In their defense, Natalie was often a nightmare, but it&rsquo;s still not okay. Mike let his mother say some bad stuff about Natalie, and someone should have shut Trish down. Natalie may not be perfect, but even she isn&rsquo;t as bad as Trish made her out to be. Natalie used to get extremely worked up about Mike. She would be very emotional when things weren&rsquo;t going well. She didn&rsquo;t seem particularly mercenary then. So, the &ldquo;whore&rdquo; stuff was a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>5  Mike Youngquist&rsquo;s Been Accused Of Emotional Abuse
Fans Have Issues With Mike Youngquist</p>
<p>At Reddit, Mike was panned for the way that he treated Natalie. Bear in mind that she&rsquo;s also been eviscerated on the popular social media platform. In a thread started by [deleted], an unhappy 90DF fan said:
Mike Youngquist in season 8 is one of the most emotionally and mentally abusive people ever on the show.</p>
<p>The fact that a &ldquo;fan&rdquo; was willing to go this far speaks volumes. Sure, people at Reddit are keyboard warriors who &ldquo;express themselves&rdquo; freely because they are permitted to post without revealing their IRL identities. They can unload without repercussions, and might have trouble stating some of these opinions if they weren&rsquo;t hiding behind Reddit handles. Regardless. Mike isn&rsquo;t always a nice guy and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.
Natalie was emotionally abusive too, but Mike took the cake when he allowed Natalie to come to America and live with him, despite the fact that he had major doubts about their relationship. He set the stage for a twisted dynamic that admittedly made for great TV. Whether she was tossing her engagement ring away in a theatrical huff or they were having yet another spaghetti Western-style showdown in the kitchen because Mike just wasn&rsquo;t vegetarian enough for his partner, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a laugh riot. However, it was sometimes unintentionally hilarious.</p>
<p>4  Mike Youngquist &amp; Natalie Mordovtseva&rsquo;s Divorce Dragged On Endlessly
Why Did Mike Youngquist &amp; Natalie Mordovtseva Take So Long To Make It Official?</p>
<p>Divorce is bad enough without it going on forever. That&rsquo;s why Mike and Natalie should have tried to wrap up the grueling process a little sooner. In fact, their divorce went on for so long that it seemed like maybe they didn&rsquo;t really want to cut the cord. There have been signs that there&rsquo;s still a bond between the two 90DF stars. However, now that Mike&rsquo;s really moved on, it&rsquo;s possible that Mike and Natalie&rsquo;s drawn-out relationship is finally (and thankfully) over.
Mike and Natalie have nothing to give each other. They are a mismatch for the ages. There is Natalie, who&rsquo;s dreaming of babies after many failed relationships, including marriages that tanked. Then, we have the debt-ridden Mike, who&rsquo;s really not so psyched up to become a father. He knows that&rsquo;s going to cost a bundle. So, life goals are in opposition and that really just scratches the surface.
It&rsquo;s possible that both tried to keep the drama going with each other because it helps them to earn money. The more they clash, the more viewers like it. People who get along typically don&rsquo;t ignite the fan base. So, Mike and Natalie&rsquo;s extended &ldquo;hatefest&rdquo; has superb entertainment value. Now and then, they soften with each other, but before too long, they&rsquo;re arguing again. There&rsquo;s gnashing of teeth and sadness and all the tiresome emotions that are part and parcel of their doomed relationship.
If Mike really has found happiness, good for him! However, he has to take responsibility for dragging out this mess for such a long time. They could never find common ground, and they never will.</p>
<p>3  Mike Youngquist Has Trouble Maintaining A Relationship
Marcia Brazil Alves Broke Up With Mike Youngquist</p>
<p>Before he moved on with a new girlfriend, who&rsquo;ll be discussed in more detail a bit later in this article, he tried to make things work with Marcia Brazil Alves. She seemed like a fun person who brought out Mike&rsquo;s playful side. The thing is, the relationship was long-distance. Eventually, Marcia got tired of that. She wanted a partner who was in her own city. So, she ended things with Mike, but said nice things about him. However, there could have been negative aspects of their relationship that she wasn&rsquo;t discussing with the public.
If she really thought Mike was her perfect match, she probably would have stuck it out. She could have relocated to be with him, or perhaps he could have done the same for her. No one was willing to relocate. This means that the romance just wasn&rsquo;t important enough. So, ultimately, Mike failed to make this work. He wouldn&rsquo;t sacrifice for his partner. That issue often came up with Natalie too.</p>
<p>2  Mike Youngquist Couldn&rsquo;t Get Natalie Mordovtseva Back
Natalie Mordovtseva Said: “I Just Couldn’t Cope, I Couldn’t Cope With What Life I Got&quot;</p>
<p>Natalie and Mike have a bond, but it&rsquo;s frayed, and when he tried to reconcile with her, things didn&rsquo;t work out. Natalie wasn&rsquo;t happy with Mike, in part because the lifestyle in Sequim, Washington wasn&rsquo;t to her liking. Natalie is a city girl who was ill-prepared for small-town life. Living in a rural area after enjoying a bustling city is quite a shift, and a lot of people would have trouble with it. Although Mike knew that Sequim wasn&rsquo;t a good fit for Natalie, he wasn&rsquo;t really prepared to make big changes for her. So, they were at an impasse.
Mike is set in his ways. He wants a woman to fit into his lifestyle. This kind of stubborn attitude makes him a sometimes-difficult partner. He&rsquo;s not so soft and sweet. In fact, he often mocked Natalie. He seemed to appreciate her looks more than anything else. While she is very glamorous, there&rsquo;s more to a woman than her outward appearance.
Maybe Mike&rsquo;s too focused on externals. It&rsquo;s possible that he falls in love with a woman&rsquo;s face and body rather than her soul. When faced with the reality of a woman, with all of her emotion and complexity, he seems overwhelmed. All of Mike&rsquo;s love interests after Natalie are also glamorous, although they&rsquo;re brunettes rather than blondes.
What&rsquo;s weird is that Mike seems to be providing his new girlfriend with the type of urban, fun-filled lifestyle that Natalie always wanted. That&rsquo;s one reason why it seems like he&rsquo;s rubbing his newfound happiness in her life. Why couldn&rsquo;t he have done this stuff for Natalie? It might have helped them to stay together.</p>
<p>1  Mike Youngquist&rsquo;s Rubbing His Happiness In Natalie Mordovtseva&rsquo;s Face
It Seems Like Mike Youngquist&rsquo;s Gloating Over His New Relationship</p>
<p>Mike said he was, &ldquo;missing his sugar,&rdquo; in a sickly-sweet moment that probably made Natalie wince. Yes, he&rsquo;s totally bewitched by his new partner, an attractive brunette who frolicked in Las Vegas with him. They seemed to have a lot of fun together, and based on the vibes in the pictures shown above, his new love interest seems more playful than Natalie. However, Mike&rsquo;s laying it on so thick that it honestly seems like he&rsquo;s trying to get a rise out of Natalie. He did the same thing when he was dating Marcia, and look how that ended.
90 Day Fiancé star Mike is kind of a character. He&rsquo;s quite intelligent - more than smart enough to push someone&rsquo;s buttons. The buttons he prefers to push are Natalie&rsquo;s. Why he continues to focus on her is a mystery. With so much going on in his life, it seems like he should have better things to do. At the same time, it seems clear that a part of him is living in the past. While his expressions of love for his new partner may be wholly sincere, there&rsquo;s always the chance that this 90DF &ldquo;monster&rdquo; is playing a sly game. He may be trying to make Natalie jealous.
