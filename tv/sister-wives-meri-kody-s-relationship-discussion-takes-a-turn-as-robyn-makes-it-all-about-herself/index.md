## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Robyn Brown is criticized for trying to become the center of attention and not letting Kody and Meri Brown discuss their marriage.




Many Sister Wives viewers are disappointed that Robyn Brown hampered Meri Brown and Kody Brown’s heartfelt moment by making a discussion all about herself. Kody has been distant from Meri over the last decade. While he married her in the early &#39;90s, he hasn’t been on the same page with her since the catfish scandal. Meri had been hoping that Kody would one day accept her again. However, Kody has claimed that he has no desire to have a relationship with his first wife because he no longer wants to be part of her life.




According to Us Weekly, Kody claims in the next episode of Sister Wives season 18 that he could “fake being in love with Meri,” but she denies it. The two then discuss the end of their plural marriage, during which Kody’s fourth wife, Robyn, starts crying because she doesn’t want the family dynamic to change anymore. After seeing the preview, Redditor SodaPop788, discussed how it was wrong of Robyn to insert her emotional melodrama into what could’ve been a nice moment between Kody and Meri.


 

The Redditor commented, “Robyn needed her d*** screentime,” stating it was “ridiculous” the way she reacted. Another Redditor wrote, “Two people breaking up and she cries, talks over them and makes it about herself.”

 Meri &amp; Kody&#39;s Sister Wives Relationship Explained 
          

Kody and Meri’s journey began in 1990 when they tied the knot and started their family. They were deeply into each other at the time and agreed to add other wives into their relationship. In 1993, Kody married Janelle Brown and soon brought Christine Brown into the mix. He had 12 kids with the two ladies before he ditched them all to focus on his fourth wife, Robyn. The plural marriages started great, but things soon became more dramatic. Kody started prioritizing Robyn over Meri, Janelle, and Christine, leading them to fall out of love.




Sister Wives fans are right to call out Robyn for sobbing. The Brown family matriarch is mature enough to know that Kody and Meri needed space to bid their final goodbyes. She should’ve tried to stay calm instead of ruining the special moment. It was hypocritical of Robyn to cry about Meri leaving the marriage when she didn&#39;t care about her before. Robyn hasn’t tried much to fix Kody’s splits with his other wives. Instead, she has always tried to make things about herself by getting emotional.

From an alternative viewpoint, it’s understandable why Robyn would cry about losing Meri. The plural marriage was a big reason the Utah woman joined Kody’s family in 2010. She wanted polygamy from the beginning and thrived in that environment. Unfortunately for Robyn, the family dynamic changed after Christine left Kody to be with someone else. Her departure encouraged Janelle and Meri to rethink their relationship and split up. Since Robyn is now Kody’s only wife, she may have cried thinking about the uncertain future and what is yet to come.






Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
