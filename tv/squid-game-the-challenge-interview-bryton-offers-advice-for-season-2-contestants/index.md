Summary

  Squid Game: The Challenge faithfully replicates the original series, emulating its production design and iconic elements like the doll and crowded dormitory.   Bryton, a fierce competitor in the show, was largely out of control of his demise when his ship in the &#34;Warship&#34; game was sunk by the opposing team&#39;s captain.   The experience of Squid Game: The Challenge is 24/7, with contestants constantly thinking about alliances, strategies, and potential threats, as there are no breaks from the competition.  







Netflix’s Squid Game: The Challenge turns the 2021 drama sensation Squid Game into a cutthroat reality competition series. The production design from the Korean series has been emulated to a T, with Squid Game: The Challenge faithfully replicating the original series’ iconic doll, crowded dormitory, and more. Episodes of Squid Game: The Challenge will be released in three batches, ensuring that some element of suspense remains even for the most binge-prone audience members.

Few contestants made as big of an early-game impression as Bryton, the college student who left school to fight through Squid Game challenges and hopefully win the $4.56 million prize. Bryton established himself from the get-go as a fierce competitor, building a close alliance with some contestants while being labeled a villain by others. Ultimately, Bryton’s demise was largely out of his control, when his ship in the Battleship clone game “Warship” was sunk by the opposing team’s captain; he was calling the shots for neither side.




                  Netflix’s New Squid Game Show Completely Misses The Point Of The Record-Breaking Streaming Hit   Squid Game: The Challenge will take the franchise into an entirely new medium, but it proves that Netflix completely missed the point of the original.    

Bryton spoke with Screen Rant about his elimination, advice for season 2 contestants, and more.


 Bryton Talks Squid Game: The Challenge 
         

Screen Rant: I watched the Squid Game show; so many people watched it. I think it&#39;s natural to be watching the challenges being like, “Oh, I can do that one. I can do that one.” How did how did they match up with your expectations once you were actually there and doing the things?


Bryton: Red Light, Green Light blew me away because we were doing it all day long. It was easy, though. Let me rephrase that: it was not as easy as people think, because people think they can just run, and stop, and run, and stop. No. That doll turns around so fast that you have, like, half a second to stop. But it was really challenging.
[With] the cookie challenge, I kind of lucked up. My cookie broke, and I got passed, and I was really surprised. Warships… you can&#39;t do anything about Warships.





Did that drive you crazy? You seem like someone who very much wants to be in control of their destiny, and you weren&#39;t really making the calls there.


Bryton: Yeah. The one thing I could have changed while I was there would have been to vouch for myself a little bit harder to become captain of the warship because [then,] even if we lose, it&#39;s on me; It&#39;s not on somebody else. I hate leaving it up to other people. Not because I don&#39;t think they could do a good job; just because I know if things go sideways, it might not…
You saw what happened. We lost. Some people are crying, some people are this, some people are that. If we lost, and I was the captain, I would have shook everybody&#39;s hand and got out of there, because it&#39;s my fault. But I was a little mad.


I would be, too. You have some quotes in the edit. I think it has you saying, “Sympathy is only weakness,” and then you also have a moment where you&#39;re like, “If I would get a pizza if I were to eliminate someone, I wouldn&#39;t do it.” Coming into this, where was your line of what was fair and what was heavy competition?





Bryton: I think everything is fair. You know what you&#39;re signing up for; you know what you&#39;re getting yourself into. The only reason I said sympathy is a weakness is because of the environment that we were in. In there, sympathy is a weakness. In real life, no; it’s okay to have sympathy and be a normal person.
In there, everybody was against everybody, no matter if people said that they had friends and alliances or whatever. I had friends in there; I also had plenty of enemies. So, everybody was out to get everybody at the end of the day.


Is it 24/7 In terms of the mental and social aspects of this? The cameras aren&#39;t showing everything, but are you constantly thinking about alliances, who&#39;s gunning for you and who&#39;s not, and that kind of stuff?


Bryton: I know the cameras don&#39;t show everything, but this is a rare case of 24/7. Around the clock, there&#39;s no “We get to cut; take a break.” No. If we cut anything, we&#39;re going right back to that dorm, then we&#39;re all together. You’re still miked up, the cameras are still rolling, [and] we don&#39;t know if they&#39;re going to use these clips or not. So, it&#39;s really 24/7, and you’ve gotta keep your head on a swivel and make sure nobody stabs you in the back.





If someone came to you and said they were jumping on a season 2 of this, what would your advice be for them?


Bryton: My advice would be don&#39;t have a strategy or a plan because it&#39;s probably going to go to s*** the moment that you get in there, and then you&#39;re not going to know what to do. Just go in there, have fun, and don&#39;t worry about the grand prize, because you&#39;re there to change your life and have fun. If the money comes, the money comes, but the more you chase something, the faster it runs.


Since you&#39;re unfortunately not coming away with all the money, is there something that was the most valuable for you to get from this experience?


Bryton: Yeah. I left school for this. I had a backup plan, of course, but this was my number one plan; to go there, make a name for myself, and hopefully do TV a few more times and just keep growing and growing and growing. So far, so good, and I think I&#39;ll be doing TV for a while.
