## Literature Review
Dance Moms propelled these women and their daughters to stardom. The infamous Dance Moms really brought the drama, but where are they now? 




Dance Moms propelled talented dancer and their overbearing mothers to stardom, but what are the original moms up to in 2023? The talent show debuted in 2011, but its main focus wasn&#39;t the dancers. Dance Moms featured big fights, as much of the action was centered on the antics of their erratic (and seemingly entitled) mothers. Shot on location at the famed Abby Lee Dance Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the young girls learned their skills under the watchful eye of the strict dance instructor and former Dance Mom star Abby Lee Miller. While some seasons of Dance Moms are better than others, the show was a hit mainly because of the moms.




The show featured competent dancers, and some girls went on to have acting and singing careers while continuing to dance. The most notable examples are Maddie Ziegler and the outspoken JoJo Siwa. Nia Sioux is another standout alum who secured a role as a dance instructor on the daytime soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. The OG competitive junior dance team included Maddie, MacKenzie, Chloe, Nia, Brooke, and Paige. While there was a focus on the dancers&#39; development, the moms and their drama stole the show. What are they up to today?


 Melissa Gisoni 
Maddie and MacKenzie&#39;s Mom
         

Melissa Gisoni is the mother of Abby&#39;s favorites, Maddie and MacKenzie Ziegler. This mom has grown her Instagram to over 3 million followers. She keeps in touch with her OG Dance Moms crew and posts selfies with them on her social media. However, these days, instead of butting heads with the other moms over how her daughters get treated on the show, Melissa is the co-host of the moms&#39; podcast called Because Mom Said So. Melissa has been married to Greg Gisoni since 2013, and they have three children. The reality star has also been featured in works such as Major Minors.






 Christi Lukasiak 
Chloe&#39;s Mom

 

Melissa&#39;s rival on Dance Moms was Christi Lukasiak. This no-holds-barred mom to Chloe defended her daughter at all costs, as she unfairly danced in the Zieglers&#39; shadow. These days, Christi is an Instagram influencer with over 2 million followers. She also created the self-help course, &#34;Adulting 101,&#34; which aims to educate young women on mastering the necessities of grown-up life. She and Chloe started a dance competition, Elevé, which they advertise on Instagram. Christi also has an Airbnb property in New Orleans, Louisiana.



 Holly Frazier 
Nia&#39;s Mom

 




When Holly Frazier isn&#39;t busy fulfilling her duties as a doctor, she continues to be a hard-working mom to her three children, including her famous daughter, Nia. She has been proudly married for 28 years and is a dedicated wife. Dr. Holly is available for public speaking engagements, is a co-host on the moms&#39; podcast, and is a published author. During Dance Moms season 2, fans witnessed Abby throwing shade. She mocked Dr. Holly at her book reveal, referring to her published work as a &#34;pamphlet.&#34; Dr. Holly maintained her dignity for the most part. However, there were times when she lost her cool with Abby, calling her &#34;...pure evil.&#34; Luckily, Dr. Holly has risen above Abby Lee&#39;s hateful commentary in 2023.



 Kelly Hyland 
Brook and Paige&#39;s Mom
          

Finally, who could forget the slap heard around the dance community? Kelly Hyland&#39;s daughters Brook and Paige were dancing darlings on the team. However, it was Kelly who gave the final performance. As a former student of Abby Lee Miller, Kelly grew up in the studio that made her and her daughters household names. When Abby got on Kelly&#39;s last nerve, Dance Moms season 4 grew tense. The heated argument resulted in a physical altercation that left Abby pressing abuse charges against her former student.




The confrontation was the last that fans saw of Kelly. Nowadays, she is proud of her two college-aged daughters and son. She also co-hosts the moms&#39; podcast. The former dance mom enjoys showing off her family and life in Texas and doesn&#39;t seem to regret pulling her kids out of Abby Lee&#39;s studio. It&#39;s safe to say that at least some of these Dance Moms infuriated and horrified viewers, but they were unforgettable.
