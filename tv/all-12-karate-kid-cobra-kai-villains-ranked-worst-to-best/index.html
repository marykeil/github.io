  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Some Karate Kid villains, like Mitch, lack depth and impactful character development, making them less interesting compared to others.
Characters like Kyler are one-dimensional and lack complexity, making them stereotypical bullies with little else to offer.
Villains such as Terry Silver and John Kreese are more compelling due to their clear motivations, complexity, and the layers of character-building they possess.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Karate Kid movies and Cobra Kai have introduced some excellent villains, but some have been far better developed (&amp; are far eviler) than others.</p>
<p>The Karate Kid franchise, including Cobra Kai, has introduced several great villains, but some are far more fleshed out than others. Of course, whether a character is a hero or villain isn&rsquo;t so black and white in The Karate Kid, with Cobra Kai often redeeming the baddies from the original films. The more we learn about those like Johnny Lawrence and Chozen Toguchi, the more interesting they become as characters. Then, there are those like Terry Silver, who, though irredeemable, is still made up of several layers of great character-building.
A lot goes into developing great villains, and The Karate Kid franchise has proven it knows how it&rsquo;s done. The best antagonistic characters will have clear motivations, complicated and multifaceted personalities, and a delicious desire to be bad. In general, the teachers and students of Cobra Kai dojo have been the primary villains of the movies and even the titular series since the concept of &ldquo;Strike first, strike hard, no mercy&rdquo; tends to breed individuals with a desire to shed blood. However, the baddies of The Karate Kid movies and Netflix&rsquo;s Cobra Kai come from all sorts of backgrounds, and the depth these characters are given (combined with their level of evilness) determines how they rank against one another.</p>
<p>All 5 Karate Kid Movies Ranked From Worst To Best
The Karate Kid movie franchise spans 3 sequels and a 2010 remake. Cobra Kai is continuing the story but here&rsquo;s which of the movies is the best around.</p>
<p>12  Mitch Is Only A Minor Villain
Villain In Cobra Kai</p>
<p>Mitch was only revealed to be a villain in Cobra Kai season 5 when he suddenly switched from being loyal to Johnny Lawrence to snitching for Terry Silver and Cobra Kai. Really, it&rsquo;s hard to blame him since, as he pointed out, his friends and fellow students have been calling him &ldquo;Penis Breath&rdquo; for the entirety of the series. This made his betrayal more comical than impactful and has served as the only point of interest for Mitch&rsquo;s character in Cobra Kai. Therefore, ranking him any higher among the other series villains is difficult.</p>
<p>11  Kyler Park Is the Stereotypical Bully
Villain In Cobra Kai</p>
<p>Kyler is one of the few Cobra Kai characters who is unlikely to find redemption in season 6. He filled the basic bully archetype in season 1, stepping into Johnny Lawrence&rsquo;s shoes as the jerk who endlessly picks on new kid Miguel Diez. However, unlike Johnny, Kyler is a pretty one-note character. He only got worse when he decided to join Cobra Kai, and though he&rsquo;s now a better fighter, there&rsquo;s nothing particularly interesting about his overall arc. Kyler gets some points for evilness, but aside from that, there isn&rsquo;t much to him.</p>
<p>10  Master Li Wasn&rsquo;t Quite To Kreese&rsquo;s Level
Villain In The Karate Kid (2010)</p>
<p>Master Li was the John Kreese equivalent in the 2010 remake of The Karate Kid. He is the teacher at Fighting Dragons Kung Fu Studio, and his teaching methods could only be described as abusive. In all, Li is about as interesting as Kreese was in the original The Karate Kid, but since there has been no further exploration of his character since 2010, he can&rsquo;t compare to the majority of other villains from the franchise. However, his skill and ruthlessness certainly earn him a few points.</p>
<p>9  Cheng Hasn&rsquo;t Been Explored Much
Villain In The Karate Kid (2010)</p>
<p>Cheng was Johnny Lawrence&rsquo;s archetypal counterpart in the 2010 The Karate Kid, and, as a bully, he was almost even worse. His motivations weren&rsquo;t quite as heavily developed, but he became a more sympathetic character at the end of the film since he left Master Li&rsquo;s Kung Fu school to be taught by Jackie Chan&rsquo;s Mr. Han instead. It would be interesting to see more of Cheng in the future, and he could potentially earn more points and become a more exciting character compared to the other franchise villains. Perhaps this will happen when Chan&rsquo;s character returns for the next Karate Kid movie, but for now, Cheng only moderately stacks up.</p>
<p>8  Kim Da-Eun&rsquo;s Backstory Needs Exploring
Villain In Cobra Kai</p>
<p>Kim Da-Eun was introduced in Cobra Kai season 5 when she joined Terry Silver as a sensei at Cobra Kai dojo. She is the granddaughter of the man who taught John Kreese and Silver karate, but this is all we know about her past. Kim is an absolutely merciless teacher, taking particular interest in her female students like Devon Lee and Tory Nichols. This is evident in Cobra Kai when she forces Tory to severely damage her hand while punching a stone. As far as frightening villains go, Sensei Kim ranks high, but her lack of character development places her slightly lower.</p>
<p>7  Kenny Payne&rsquo;s Arc Is Frustrating
Villain In Cobra Kai</p>
<p>Kenny didn&rsquo;t start as a villain. He was initially introduced as a new student being bullied by Daniel LaRusso&rsquo;s son, Anthony LaRusso. However, things began to fall apart when Robby Keene took Kenny under his wing. Cobra Kai ended up being a bad influence on Kenny, and it&rsquo;s still unclear as of the end of Cobra Kai season 5 whether there&rsquo;s any chance of him turning this around. Kenny has had one of the more dynamic arcs of the young Karate Kid villains, but he&rsquo;s such a jerk since joining Cobra Kai that he is almost too annoying.</p>
<p>6  Mike Barnes Was Terrifying
Villain In The Karate Kid Part III</p>
<p>Mike Barnes was the teen villain from The Karate Kid Part III and an absolute loose canon. His skills were far beyond Daniel&rsquo;s, and he only lost the film&rsquo;s final battle because Terry Silver told him to keep the score tied up as long as possible. Barnes was brought back in Cobra Kai season 5, where it&rsquo;s revealed that he turned his act around and gave up his outrageously violent ways. Still, he proved himself a force to be reckoned with when he tried to get revenge on Terry Silver at the end of the season. There isn&rsquo;t much more to his character than this, but his power and violence alone allow him to stand out.</p>
<p>5  Tory Nichols Has Had Excellent Development
Villain In Cobra Kai</p>
<p>Tory is pretty well redeemed by the end of Cobra Kai season 5, but she was a significant antagonist for most of her time in the series. Violent and full of rage, she started out determined to prove herself, and she didn&rsquo;t much care who got hurt in the process. Tory targetted in on Samantha LaRusso pretty quickly, and their fights at the high school in Cobra Kai season 4 (in which Tory brought spiked iron knuckles), the LaRusso house, and the All-Valley Tournament were all intense displays of skill and power. Ultimately, Tory is made even more interesting by her moral improvement throughout the series. Going into season 6, she is determined to win fair or not at all.</p>
<p>4  Johnny Lawrence Has Come So Far
Villain In The Karate Kid</p>
<p>Johnny Lawrence is the original teen villain of the Karate Kid franchise and is easily among the most interesting characters. As the lead of Cobra Kai, he has seen the most development from beginning to end, but that hasn&rsquo;t changed the person he is at his core—a non-PC jerk with a surprisingly good heart. Johnny still prioritizes being a badass over anything else, but his idea of &ldquo;no mercy&rdquo; has changed significantly. Overall, his goodness makes him rank lower than those who have maintained their evil nature going into Cobra Kai season 6, but that takes nothing away from Johnny being a great character.</p>
<p>3  Chozen Toguchi Is An Exciting Fighter
Villain In The Karate Kid Part II</p>
<p>Compared to Johnny, Chozen was a far fiercer villain for Daniel in The Karate Kid Part II. The top student of Mr. Miyagi&rsquo;s old friend and rival from Japan, Chozen had been raised with the same teachings as Daniel but poisoned by the hate and bad blood bred from Miyagi&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s favoritism. Ultimately, this was the titular karate kid&rsquo;s most dangerous fight yet since Chozen was out for blood. Of course, the character has only improved since he was brought back for Cobra Kai. He has been thoroughly redeemed, but his big fight with Silver in the final of Cobra Kai season 5 proves he is an excellent character—villain or not.</p>
<p>2  Terry Silver Is Deliciously Evil
Villain In The Karate Kid Part III &amp; Cobra Kai</p>
<p>Terry Silver is easily the baddest villain of the Karate Kid franchise. It has become clear that he has virtually no chance for redemption, with every opportunity for such in Cobra Kai disregarded by the character. He was first introduced in The Karate Kid Part III, where he took Kreese&rsquo;s aggression and mercilessness to another level. Still, aside from wanting to be the best around, there&rsquo;s minimal motivation for Silver&rsquo;s evilness, which makes him a somewhat less interesting character. Since the Karate Kid franchise is all about the complexities of morality, Silver&rsquo;s villainy alone doesn&rsquo;t rank him on top.</p>
<p>1  John Kreese Is The Most Dynamic Villain
Villain In The Karate Kid &amp; Cobra Kai</p>
<p>John Kreese may not be quite as evil a villain as Terry Silver, but he&rsquo;s a far more complex and interesting character. He was easy to hate when introduced in The Karate Kid—the antithesis of Mr. Miyagi&rsquo;s kind and calm nature. This has largely continued into Cobra Kai, especially since Kreese has resisted every opportunity for redemption. This has been frustrating to watch, especially since the flashback episodes that outlined Kreese&rsquo;s past made it clear that there was once some good to him. It&rsquo;s difficult to say what will happen to this Karate Kid villain coming into Cobra Kai season 6, and this is precisely what makes him the best villain of the franchise.</p>
