 Bachelor In Paradise Season 10 Latest News 
          




As of December 2023, there are no new updates on Bachelor in Paradise season 10. However, that doesn&#39;t mean the series isn&#39;t coming back for its milestone season. ABC usually doesn&#39;t announce the next season this early in the game, especially since Bachelor in Paradise season 9 is still airing. Nonetheless, the likelihood of the series coming back for another season is very high. According to Programming Insider, the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 premiere had over 2.6 million, only going down to 1.89 million viewers during episode 3, Programming Insider also claims. The Bachelor in Paradise season-high was the premiere, but has managed to stay close to the 2 million number.



 Bachelor In Paradise Season 10 Potential Release Window 
          

Bachelor in Paradise season 10 will not be released until late 2024 and will likely follow a similar release schedule to past seasons. Seasons 1 to 7 premiered sometime between early to mid-August, while seasons 8 and 9 premiered in late September. The show usually premieres right after The Bachelorette, which ends sometime in early to mid-summer. However, with the addition of The Golden Bachelor this year and the potential for a Golden Bachelorette in 2024, it&#39;s unclear if the release time will change for Bachelor in Paradise season 10.






 Bachelor In Paradise Season 10 Potential Cast 
         

The cast for Bachelor in Paradise season 10 has not been confirmed yet. Since The Bachelor season 28 just finished filming, and they have yet to choose a Bachelorette for season 21, ABC likely won&#39;t confirm their cast list until shortly before Bachelor in Paradise season 10 starts airing. While Bachelor in Paradise does usually fill out most of the cast with singles from the most recent season of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, they do sometimes choose contestants from past seasons. However, with the addition of The Golden Bachelor, who knows, viewers may see some women from Gerry Turner&#39;s season.

Some contestants that should be on Bachelor in Paradise season 10 are Susie Evans, Clayton Echard, and Justin Glaze, from the newer Bachelor franchise seasons. Even Leslie Fhima, the rummer-up on The Golden Bachelor, would make a great addition. Some contestants from older seasons, like Tyler Cameron, Zac Clark, or even Peter Weber, would make for a captivating Bachelor in Paradise season 10.






 When Will Bachelor In Paradise Season 10 Start Filming?  
          

Bachelor in Paradise season 10 hasn&#39;t started filming yet. Since season 9 is about to end and neither of the new seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette has started airing, season 10 likely won&#39;t start filming until next year. Since the show airs sometime between August and September, Bachelor in Paradise won&#39;t begin filming until around May or June. The series usually starts filming around the time The Bachelorette is airing, as Reality Steve has spoiled some contestant exits from The Bachelorette very early in the season.



Bachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on ABC.
