# Chicago Fire Season 12 Premiere Details Confirm Some Worst Fears About Season 11 Ending


## SUMMARY 



  Chicago Fire season 12 premiere will have a time jump, meaning it won&#39;t immediately address the cliffhangers from season 11.   The premiere will focus on the characters of Firehouse 51 navigating through big changes and trying to resolve the aftermath of season 11.   The decision to do a time jump allows the show to answer lingering questions through exposition, without bogging down the premiere with tying up loose ends.

## Literature Review
One of the worst things to happen regarding the season 11 cliffhangers is confirmed to come to fruition in the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere. 




One of the worst things to happen in the aftermath of the season 11 ending is confirmed in the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere. Firehouse 51 is gearing up for its return to the small screen after an extended hiatus due to the dual Hollywood strikes of 2023. The extended break was unfortunate since Chicago Fire season 11 ended on several cliffhangers, forcing One Chicago viewers to wait longer than usual to get their respective resolutions.




Per TV Line, some time has passed when Chicago Fire season 12 picks up. This means that the One Chicago series won&#39;t show the fallout from all the lingering plot lines that season 11 left hanging. That includes Stella Kidd&#39;s attempt to bring back Kelly Severide home, Mouch&#39;s situation at the hospital after getting shot, and Sylvie Brett&#39;s answer to Matt Casey&#39;s proposal. Read showrunner Andrea Newman&#39;s full quote below:


Yes, there will be some time jump going into the premiere, and viewers and 51 are in it together. There have been big changes, and the 51 gang is on a rollercoaster ride throughout the episode trying to navigate all of it.



 Why Chicago Fire Season 12 Premiere Needs A Time Jump 
          

The Chicago Fire season 11 finale was a jam-packed send-off to a rough year. It was hampered by a major death with Evan Hawkin&#39;s tragic demise and the unexpected leave of absence from series lead Taylor Kinney. This forced the writers to not just find a way to explain Kelly Severide&#39;s whereabouts but also alter their laid-out plans for him and his new wife, Kidd. The season 11 send-off didn&#39;t feel convoluted, even though it tackled several big plots, but addressing all of their aftermaths risks bogging down the season 12 premiere.




Because of this, it&#39;s understandable that Newman and her team decided to do a time jump. That way, they can still answer all the remaining questions left by the Chicago Fire season 11 finale, but not be forced to show them explicitly. Instead, they will be resolved through exposition, which is less time-consuming. The one-hour episode cannot simply devote its whole run time to just tying loose ends, especially since it also needs to lay the groundwork for another tricky year as it faces a few big cast departures.

                  5 One Chicago Characters Who Likely Won&#39;t Return (&amp; 2 Who Might Come Back)   NBC&#39;s One Chicago may look very different when it finally returns with brand new episodes thanks to several character departures and returns.     

Regardless of how they address the hanging plots in the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere, what&#39;s more important is that all of them have favorable outcomes. Severide is already confirmed to be returning to Firehouse 51, but there&#39;s no guarantee that he&#39;s staying for the long haul. Mouch seems to be back on duty per set photos, but One Chicago is known for unexpected deaths. Finally, just because Brett is leaving Chief Boden&#39;s house doesn&#39;t mean that she accepts Casey&#39;s proposal.






NBC&#39;s One Chicago returns on January 17, 2023.
