## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé and its spin-offs featured several dramatic scenes in 2023. Some moments from early this year still make fans initiate discussions.




90 Day Fiancé shows were quite entertaining throughout 2023. The year started with 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7, which showcased dramatic conclusions to some long-running journeys. One such story was about Kimberly Menzies and Usman “Sojaboy” Umar. The couple had met each other’s families and were on the verge of marriage. However, their plans changed after Kimberly rightfully accused Usman of not being respectful enough, which led him to break up with her. During Tell All, viewers learned Kimberly and Usman had broken up but decided to stay friends.
In the following weeks of January, TLC released 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. The spin-off featured an interesting cast, unique stories, and too many plot twists. Fans also got to see the next season of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, which showed Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo almost breaking up. However, the two somehow made their American-Panamanian relationship work and surprised viewers by joining 90 Day Fiancé season 10. The most surprising spin-off of the year was 90 Day: The Last Resort. The new show brought in old couples and gave them a platform to fix their relationships.

Riley and many other viewers felt that Violet was lying about the pregnancy to get sympathy for her terrible attitude. There were simply too many signs that she wasn’t being honest.
