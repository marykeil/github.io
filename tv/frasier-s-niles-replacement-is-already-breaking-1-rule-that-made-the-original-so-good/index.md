# Frasier s Niles Replacement Is Already Breaking 1 Rule That Made The Original So Good


## SUMMARY

## Literature Review
The Frasier reboot doesn&#39;t feature Niles Crane, but it features a replacement, who is breaking one golden rule from the original series.




The Frasier reboot introduced Alan (Nicholas Lyndhurst) as a Niles replacement, and while the new character has been received well, he breaks 1 rule that made the show&#39;s original 1993-2004 run so great. When Kelsey Grammer returned for 2023&#39;s Frasier reboot, it was without the titular psychiatrist and radio host&#39;s brother, Niles. Despite being asked to join the Paramount&#43; project, David Hyde Pierce opted against returning for the new episodes of Frasier, which forced Kelsey Grammer and the show’s developers to find another creative route for the revival. Geography turned out to be the solution, with Frasier relocating to Boston while Niles, along with Daphne (Jane Leeves), remain in Seattle.




This solved the issue of why Niles isn&#39;t in the new Frasier, but the sitcom&#39;s core chemistry was at risk without an intellectual friend, equal and (sometimes) rival for Kelsey Grammar&#39;s Dr. Crane to engage in witty banter with The Frasier reboot filled the void left by David Hyde Pierce introducing a replacement for Niles as Frasier’s partner-in-crime — Nicholas Lyndhurst’s Alan Cornwall. Niles has been mentioned a few times in the Frasier reboot, especially since his son David (Anders Keith) is a main character, and while many see Alan as Niles&#39;s replacement, they&#39;re very different — and the debate remains about whether the change is good for Frasier or not.

                  Frasier Reboot Season 2: Will It Happen? Everything We Know   The first season of the Frasier reboot premiered on Paramount&#43; in October 2023, and here&#39;s what we know about a possible second season.     


 Frasier&#39;s Niles Replacement Is Different In 1 Key Way 
Alan Isn&#39;t A Comedic Punching Bag For Frasier
          




 Nicholas Lyndhurst&#39;s Alan is seen as the replacement for Niles in the Frasier reboot. The character does stand in for David Hyde Pierce&#39;s Niles in many ways, especially since he&#39;s positioned as Frasier&#39;s best friend in the new Frasier episodes. Where Frasier and Niles used to get into hijinks and escapades in the original run, it&#39;s now Frasier and Alan, often with Professor Olivia Finch (Toks Olagundoye) either in tow or at the receiving end, depending on the episode.



It&#39;s clear that Frasier views Alan as a true equal.




Just like with Niles, Frasier and Alan’s relationship goes way back, although not quite as far. Despite never appearing or even being referenced in the original 1993-2004 run, Alan was Frasier’s old classmate from Harvard, where both he and — after accepting a teaching post in the reboot&#39;s premiere — Frasier now teach. Prior to the reboot&#39;s debut, Grammer spoke highly of Nicholas Lyndhurst and described Alan as Frasier’s first actual adult friend, and it&#39;s clear that Frasier views Alan as a true equal.





 

Meeting as adults, combined with the lack of a sibling rivalry dynamic, means the way Frasier treats Alan is very different from Niles. While the characters may hold similar positions in the broader sense, Alan in the Frasier reboot isn&#39;t a replacement for Niles, as the interactions Alan has with Frasier are incredibly different. Alan isn&#39;t the victim of his friend&#39;s barbs, which Niles very much was, which was a key source of the humor in Frasier&#39;s original run.

The first example of this came in the premiere the Frasier reboot. As Frasier goes on his rant about preferring drinking beer instead of wine in Boston, Alan sarcastically calls him an “everyman,” his way of calling him out for his pretentious tendencies. Since Niles was more self-aggrandizing than his older brother, Frasier was the one who always called him out on his ostentatious antics. This time, however, Frasier is the subject of the same scrutiny.




                  The Frasier Reboot Cast Guide: Every New &amp; Returning Character Joining Frasier In Boston   Kelsey Grammar is back as Frasier Crane for Peacock&#39;s 2023 Frasier reboot, and he&#39;s joined by both new faces and some returning characters.    



 Why Frasier&#39;s Reboot Makes Him The Butt Of The Joke 
Alan Serves A Different Purpose To Niles
          

It&#39;s an understatement to say that Paramount&#43;&#39;s Frasier reboot had its work cut out for it. The original series holds the most Emmy wins for a comedy, meaning that it was both popular and critically acclaimed. As Frasier returned to Boston, the new show had to revisit his old role in Cheers as the butt of jokes. Considering how he lived his life in Seattle, it&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that he had never fit in the New England city. Seeing him come back meant that he stood out and seemed more pretentious than ever. 




This is where the likes of Alan, along with characters like son Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott) and his roommate Eve (Jess Sagueiro) come in to ground Frasier when he&#39;s becoming too self-absorbed. The Frasier reboot had to do surprisingly little work making up for its missing cast members by reversing the dynamic of Frasier&#39;s role in the show entirely. While this was most evident with Frasier filling the role of the older parent held by his father Martin in the shows original run (played by the late John Mahoney), it was apparent in a subtler way in his social relationships too, especially with Alan.

In the 1993-2004 episodes of Frasier, Frasier would often jibe Niles for being incredibly pretentious, even by Frasier&#39;s standards. In the Frasier reboot, it is Frasier who stands out as having ideas too highbrow for reality, so much so that even Alan — a fellow Harvard professor — can&#39;t help but call him out on it. It makes the reboot feel like a very different show. Making Frasier the butt of the joke made it easier for the show&#39;s new cast to establish themselves, and ensured that the absence of the missing Frasier characters like Nile&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be too impactful.




                  Nicholas Lyndhurst Is The Best Thing About Frasier&#39;s Reboot - So Go Watch This 42-Year-Old Sitcom   Since Nicholas Lyndhurst is the best thing about Frasier&#39;s reboot, it&#39;s worth taking a look at his other work, namely a sitcom he made decades ago.    



 


 Why Alan Is A Very Different Character To Niles 
Nicholas Lyndhurst Isn&#39;t Playing A David Hyde Pierce Replacement
         

Alan may have replaced Niles as Frasier&#39;s best friend in the show, but the two characters are almost polar opposites when it comes to their personalities. One of the ways the Frasier reboot manages to distinguish David Hyde Pierce and Nicholas Lyndhurst&#39;s characters further beyond the different dynamic in their relationship with Frasier is that they are fundamentally different people — so much so that it&#39;s likely Niles and Alan wouldn&#39;t get on.

While Niles tries to be agreeable to the point that it&#39;s a fault, Alan is unashamedly antagonistic. He&#39;s barbed not just with Frasier, but with everyone. Much like Frasier, Niles was a fan of sly underhanded comments, often intended to go over the heads of those he aimed them at. Alan is also sarcastic, but is much more direct with his wry humor. Alan wants the person he&#39;s insulted to know they&#39;ve been insulted — and this makes for a very different kind of humor, with Nicholas Lyndhurst&#39;s laugh-out-loud moments in the Frasier reboot being nothing like David Hyde Pierce&#39;s in the original run.




 Cast Member  Character  Did They Return For The Reboot?  How They Returned (Or Why They Didn&#39;t)   David Hyde Pierce  Niles Crane  No  David Hyde Pierce was invited to return for the reboot by Paramount, but he declined.   Jane Leeves  Daphne Moon  No  Jane Leeves has stated that she wouldn&#39;t return for the Frasier reboot if it meant she couldn&#39;t work on her current show The Resident (via The Express).   John Mahoney  Martin Crane  No  Frasier cast member John Mahoney sadly passed away in 2018. The Frasier reboot honors Mahoney and Martin in several ways, and the death of Frasier&#39;s father has a significant impact on the events of the reboot, prompting Frasier to reconnect with his own son, Freddy.   Peri Gilpin  Roz Doyle  Yes  Freddy reached out to Roz as a Christmas present for Frasier, and Roz headed to Boston for a surprise visit. This meant an equally surprising appearance by Peri Gilpin in episode 10 of the reboot, &#34;Reindeer Games&#34;.   Bebe Neuwirth  Lilith Sternin  Yes  The only other cast member of Cheers besides Kelsey Grammer to appear in all three shows, Bebe Neuwirth reprised her role as Freddy&#39;s mom and Frasier&#39;s ex-wife Lilith in the reboot. Lilith appeared in episode 7, &#34;Freddy&#39;s Birthday&#34;.   



Aside from Kelsey Grammer as Frasier, only Peri Gilpin and Bebe Neuwirth returned from the original Frasier cast to reprise their roles for cameo appearances. However, the absence of these characters was felt significantly less as the show went on, and by the final episode of the Frasier reboot the new cast — especially Nicholas Lyndhurst&#39;s Alan — felt firmly established. While Alan might technically be a replacement for Niles, just as Freddy is the role-reversed Martin Facsimilie and David is the oddball Daphne once was, he is fundamentally his own character. He brings something unique and different to the world of Frasier, but it&#39;s not a replacement for David Hyde Pierce in the original.
