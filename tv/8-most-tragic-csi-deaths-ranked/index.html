CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, and CSI: NY had the most tragic deaths in the franchise.
Warrick Brown&rsquo;s death in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation was the most shocking and devastating in the series.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Numerous important characters have died in all five shows of the CSI franchise, but these eight deaths were undoubtedly the most tragic.</p>
<p>The CSI franchise consists of five shows — CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, CSI: Cyber, and CSI: Vegas — that, together, have produced 38 seasons and 828 episodes of television, meaning that this corner of television has experienced an endless number of deaths. However, some tragedies were more surprising and difficult to accept than others throughout the police procedural series. Of course, at least one person dies per episode. But it is all the more heartbreaking when a main or supporting character passes away or when a death significantly affects one of the main characters.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation kicked off the CSI universe in 2000 and was the most successful, having lasted 15 seasons and then being revived with CSI: Vegas in 2021. CSI: Miami and CSI: NY also did well for themselves, with ten seasons and nine seasons under their belts, respectively. The only dud in the franchise was CSI: Cyber, which only ran for two seasons before CBS canceled the third spin-off in 2016. As a result, the most tragic deaths in the franchise occurred in the first three shows — CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY.</p>
<p>8  Ruben Sandoval
CSI: NY</p>
<p>Although Ruben Sandoval, played by Anthony Tavera, only appeared in one episode of CSI: NY season 4, his tragic death had a long-lasting impact. Ruben was the son of one of Danny Messer&rsquo;s neighbors, Rikki, in his apartment building in New York City. Danny took the young boy to a ceremony called the Blessing of the Bikes at the local church, and on their way home, Ruben rode ahead on his bike and got caught in the crosshairs of a robbery at a bodega that resulted in a shooting. Danny caught up with Ruben and yelled at him to go straight home while he called in reinforcements. Unfortunately, the detective had no idea that Ruben had been shot.
Later that day, Danny saw Ruben&rsquo;s body in the morgue. He had been found in an alley, where he bled out from his wound. Danny felt immense guilt for Ruben&rsquo;s death, and he continued to spiral in the following episodes. His and Ruben&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s grief led to them sleeping together, even though Danny was dating Lindsay Monroe at the time. Eventually, their affair ended, and Danny apologized to Lindsay for pushing her away. The fan-favorite couple eventually reconciled by the end of CSI: NY season 4.</p>

All 7 CSI Team Leaders, Ranked Worst To Best
Throughout all of the shows in the CSI universe, there have been many supervisors in the crime lab, but some have had more success than others.</p>
<p>7  Jesse Cardoza
CSI: Miami</p>
<p>The CSI: Miami season 8 finale ended on a cliffhanger — serial killer Bob Starling had targeted the CSI lab and contaminated it with halon gas, resulting in everyone inside passing out. The episode concluded with Eric Delko returning to the lab and seeing what Starling had done, and viewers had to wait months to learn everyone&rsquo;s fate. Unfortunately, one of the crime show&rsquo;s main characters, Jesse Cardoza, played by Eddie Cibrian, did not survive the gas leak.
The season 9 premiere revealed that Jesse had sadly died after he passed out from the gas and hit his head on glass shards that pierced his brain. Jesse&rsquo;s death greatly affected the other characters and motivated them to catch Starling. The detective only appeared in one season of CSI: Miami, but his passing was still a difficult pill to swallow because he was a well-liked and respected character.</p>
<p>6  Julie Finlay
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</p>
<p>Elisabeth Shue&rsquo;s Julie Finlay&rsquo;s death was a bit confusing, given how it was relayed to the audience, but it was tragic nonetheless. The CSI: Crime Scene Investigation assistant supervisor first appeared in season 12 to replace Catherine Willows following her exit from the CBS show and was a series regular up until the season 15 finale. In her last episode, Finlay was kidnapped by Paul Winthrop, and the other characters later discovered her in the trunk of Paul&rsquo;s car, badly beaten and barely alive. Season 15, episode 18, ended with Finlay in a coma, but the series finale later revealed (via a plaque in remembrance of her) that she had died from her injuries.</p>
<p>5  Raymond Caine
CSI: Miami</p>
<p>Raymond Caine, portrayed by Dean Winters, was a recurring character in CSI: Miami and was Horatio Caine&rsquo;s brother. The audience met him during season 1 and had to bid him farewell during the season 5 premiere. Raymond was a cop just like his brother, even though his methods were quite different from Horatio&rsquo;s. He wasn&rsquo;t the most likable character on the show, but Raymond&rsquo;s complex relationship with Horatio made his death more tragic than others. Raymond was fatally beaten by the leader of the Mala Noche gang after trying to save his son, and Horatio was the one who found him barely hanging onto life. Raymond died in his brother&rsquo;s arms, traumatizing him and the viewers.</p>

The CSI universe as a whole has been largely successful since its debut back in 2000, but some entries in the franchise are better than others.</p>
<p>4  Marisol Delko
CSI: Miami</p>
<p>Part of what made Raymond&rsquo;s death devastating in the CSI: Miami season 5 premiere was that Horatio&rsquo;s wife, Marisol Delko, had just died two episodes prior in season 4, episode 24. Marisol, who was also Eric Delko&rsquo;s sister, was shot by a member of the Mala Noche gang and was rushed to the hospital. Unfortunately, the bullet significantly damaged Alana de la Garza&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s kidneys and spleen, and there was nothing that the doctors could do to save her. Horatio was by Marisol&rsquo;s bedside when she died, and he and Eric were then determined to get justice for their loved one before they could process their immense grief.</p>
<p>3  Jessica Angell
CSI: NY</p>
<p>Jessica Angell, played by Emmanuelle Vaugier, was only a recurring character in CSI: NY. But she was one of the most consistent (and likable) characters who wasn&rsquo;t a part of the main cast, as she appeared in multiple episodes from season 3 to season 5. The homicide detective became Don Flack&rsquo;s girlfriend in the fifth season (after many episodes that teased a possible romance between the two), and their relationship was one that most were rooting for.
Unfortunately, it all came to an end when Angell was fatally shot during the season 5 finale. Flack found her and rushed her to the hospital, where she died from her injuries. The detective was grief-stricken over the loss, which led to him shooting and killing Angell&rsquo;s murderer instead of arresting him at the end of the CSI: NY episode. Aside from Flack, the other characters were also distraught over Angell&rsquo;s death, as they all had a working and personal relationship with her.</p>
<p>2  Aiden Burn
CSI: NY</p>
<p>Aiden Burn, portrayed by Vanessa Ferlito, was one of the main characters introduced during CSI: NY season 1, but her status on the show changed in season 2. Aiden was so determined to catch the rapist who hurt her friend, Regina Bowen, that she almost planted evidence to implicate him in the crime. Even though she stopped herself, Mac Taylor found out about Aiden&rsquo;s actions and fired her in season 2, episode 2. She seemingly agreed with his decision and admitted that she didn&rsquo;t know if she would stop herself from planting evidence a second time.
Aiden continued her pursuit of the rapist, D.J. Pratt, which led to her death at the end of CSI: NY season 2. Pratt murdered Aiden, placed her in a car, and set it on fire, making her body unrecognizable. The CSI team discovered her in episode 23, and a facial reconstruction of the skull revealed her identity to her former colleagues, which devastated them. Thankfully, Aiden intentionally left behind evidence that led to Pratt&rsquo;s arrest, but the other characters, especially Danny, were greatly affected by her death.</p>
<p>10 Most Tiresome CSI Tropes Every Crime Procedural Continues To Use
CSI shaped forensic storytelling, but the overuse of some tropes has also paved the way for procedural narratives that feel far too formulaic.</p>
<p>1  Warrick Brown
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</p>
<p>The most tragic CSI death was and always will be Warrick Brown, played by Gary Dourdan, in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Warrick had been a main (and well-liked) character in the procedural series since the pilot episode, which made his passing in the season 9 premiere immensely shocking and devastating (for the audience and his colleagues). Warrick was framed for the murder of Lou Gedda by Undersheriff Jeffrey McKeen in the season 8 finale, and the episode ended with McKeen shooting the CSI in the neck and chest after he was found innocent.
The season 9 premiere wasted no time resolving the previous cliffhanger by opening with Gil Grissom finding Warrick bleeding out in his car. Warrick died in Grissom&rsquo;s arms, and the entire CSI team was consumed with grief by their friend&rsquo;s death. Thankfully, they eventually caught and arrested McKeen, but nothing could fix the tragic loss of Warrick in CSI.
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, and CSI: Vegas are available to stream on Paramount+.</p>
