## Literature Review
Lucas Sinclair and Max Mayfield are one of the best couples on Stranger Things, even if their relationship changes from season to season.




Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) are one of the best couples on Stranger Things, and it all started with a high score on Dig Dug. While the main focus of the Netflix sci-fi thriller may be fighting monsters from other dimensions, many romantic connections form on Stranger Things, and Lucas and Max are no exception. Though they may not share that much screen time as an actual couple themselves, the build-up and fallout of their relationship are just as significant as the time they spend together.




Throughout three seasons, Lucas and Max went from strangers to friends, to crushes, to a couple, to exes (six or seven times over), to friends again. Near the end of season 4, the prospect of Lucas and Max rekindling their relationship was looking good, until Vecna put Max in a comatose state. Max and Lucas could end up together in the long run as long as she recovers in Stranger Things season 5, the upcoming final season of the hit series.

                  Stranger Things Cast &amp; Character Guide   Stranger Things features an ever-expanding cast who will the likes of Millie Bobby Brown&#39;s Eleven and Finn Wolfhard&#39;s Mike.    


 Stranger Things Season 2 
First Meeting &amp; First Kiss
         

  &#34;Chapter Two: Trick or Treat, Freak&#34; (Season 2, Episode 2) - Lucas and Max meet for the first time   &#34;Chapter Five: Dig Dug&#34; (Season 2, Episode 5) - Lucas tells Max about the Upside Down   &#34;Chapter Six: The Spy&#34; (Season 2, Episode 6) - Lucas and Max have a heart-to-heart at the junkyard   &#34;Chapter Nine: The Gate&#34; (Season 2, Episode 9) - Lucas and Max share their first kiss at the Snowball Dance  




Max joins the show in the season 2 premiere as a skateboarding tomboy from California. The boys are shocked when they realize that she must be the mysterious &#34;MADMAX&#34; who beat Dustin&#39;s high score on the video game Dig Dug at the arcade. Lucas makes his first official introduction to Max when he and Dustin invite her to come trick-or-treating with them. She initially declines because she thinks they&#39;re &#34;stalkers,&#34; but ultimately decides to join them.

The boys keep Max in the dark as Will&#39;s condition starts getting worse, and they realize Dart is from the Upside Down, which makes her feel excluded from the party. Lucas seeks advice from his dad about how to fix things and apologizes to Max for being so secretive. He explains what really happened to Will and spills everything about the Upside Down. She doesn&#39;t believe him at first but is later convinced when she sees the Demodogs. Sparks fly as their bond strengthens during a heart-to-heart about Max&#39;s family problems. In the finale, they dance together at the Snow Ball and share their first kiss on the dance floor.




Lucas and Max&#39;s budding romance faces multiple obstacles throughout season 2. Both Lucas and Dustin initially show interest in Max and try to impress her, but Dustin notices she has a closer bond with Lucas and gives up. Lucas and Max also have to deal with her no-good step-brother Billy, who orders Max to stay away from Lucas. It is heavily implied that Billy doesn&#39;t approve of Lucas because he is racist, since he has no reason to dislike him otherwise. In the finale, Billy attacks Lucas at the Byers house before Steve intervenes. Max eventually stands up to Billy and tells him to leave them alone, and he complies.



 Stranger Things Season 3 
On-And-Off Relationship
          

  &#34;Chapter One: Suzie, Do You Copy?&#34; (Season 3, Episode 1) - Lucas and Max are confirmed to be dating   &#34;Chapter Two: The Mall Rats&#34; (Season 3, Episode 2) - Max dumps Lucas (again)   &#34;Chapter Eight: The Battle of Starcourt&#34; (Season 3, Episode 8) - Lucas and Max are presumably back together  




By the beginning of season 3, Lucas and Max have already been dating for a while, but their relationship isn&#39;t the most secure or mature. Max is easily irritated by Lucas&#39; thoughtless behavior, and they tend to let their friends&#39; drama affect their own relationship. When Mike upsets Eleven by lying to her, Max sets out to teach El that &#34;there&#39;s more to life than stupid boys&#34; and takes her on a shopping spree. Meanwhile, Lucas tries to help Mike fix things with El by searching for an apology gift. Empowered by Max&#39;s support and insight, however, El dumps Mike.

Given that Lucas has taken Mike&#39;s side and Max has taken El&#39;s side, it seems that Max might be dumping Lucas as well. This is confirmed when Max tells Eleven that she bets Mike and Lucas &#34;are totally wallowing in self-pity and misery like, &#39;Oh, I hope they take us back,&#39;&#34; and Will reminds Lucas and Mike that Max and El &#34;broke up with [them].&#34; However, Lucas and Max&#39;s breakup isn&#39;t serious or permanent, since Max had already dumped Lucas five separate times since they started dating.




Max and Lucas give a glimpse into this on-and-off dynamic through their relationship advice to their friends. In an attempt to reassure Mike that El will forgive him, Lucas tells Mike that he&#39;s made &#34;thousands&#34; of mistakes in his own relationship, but that he never despaired. Instead, he &#34;marched back into battle&#34; and &#34;won her back every single freaking time.&#34; When El does dump Mike, though, Max speaks from experience when she claims that &#34;he&#39;ll come crawling back to [her] in no time, begging for forgiveness,&#34; insinuating that this is what Lucas did every time Max dumped him.

The girls become further enraged with the boys when El uses her powers to spy on them and hears Mike and Lucas saying hurtful stuff about girls in general. However, they decide to put their issues with Mike and Lucas on pause to join forces against the Mind Flayer, during which Lucas and Max seem to be getting along again. Months after the explosive events at the mall, Lucas and Max appear to have reconciled as they help the Byers and El pack for their move to California. At the end of the finale, Max and Lucas interlock arms as Max leans on his shoulder, indicating they&#39;re back together.






 Stranger Things Season 4 
Broken Up &amp; Reconciliation
          

  &#34;Chapter One: The Hellfire Club&#34; (Season 3, Episode 1) - Lucas and Max are revealed to be broken up   &#34;Chapter Four: Dear Billy&#34; (Season 3, Episode 4) - Lucas witnesses Max get possessed by Vecna   &#34;Chapter Nine: The Piggyback&#34; (Season 3, Episode 9) - Lucas holds Max as she briefly dies in his arms  

It&#39;s revealed at the beginning of Stranger Things season 4 that Max broke up with Lucas sometime after the season 3 finale, only this time, it was for good. Ever since Billy&#39;s sacrifice, Max has been struggling with survivor&#39;s guilt along with other life changes, like her stepdad leaving, moving to a trailer park, and her mom&#39;s worsening alcoholism. Lucas tries to reach out to her, but she keeps pushing him away, claiming she&#39;s a different person now. Lucas has also become more popular since starting high school and joining the basketball team, which has created distance between not only him and Max, but Mike and Dustin, as well.




As they investigate the Vecna murders with the rest of the Hawkins gang, Lucas makes multiple attempts to connect with Max again, but she brushes him off. He also declines to read Max&#39;s letter to him because he refuses to accept that Vecna will kill her. However, when Max is possessed by Vecna, Lucas&#39; fear of losing her for good is palpable. This close call brings Lucas and Max closer together, and it becomes clear they still have romantic feelings for each other. When Lucas&#39; teammate Patrick is killed by Vecna, Max consoles him and he apologizes for not being there for her enough.

Before summoning Vecna at the Creel house, Lucas and Max express how happy they are to be back in each other&#39;s lives and make plans to go to the movies together. However, while Max is under Vecna&#39;s curse, Jason interrupts and Lucas has to fight him off. Vecna leaves Max in a critical state and she temporarily dies in Lucas&#39; arms while he sobs hysterically, begging her to try and stay alive. El was able to bring her back to life, but as of the Stranger Things season 4 finale, Max remains in a comatose state at the hospital, where Lucas has stayed by her side.
