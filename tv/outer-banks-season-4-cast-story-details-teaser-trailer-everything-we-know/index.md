Netflix’s hit series Outer Banks will be back for season 4, with Outer Banks season 4 news coming down the pipeline fast. The young adult drama centers on a group of working-class teens, the Pogues, whose lives in North Carolina’s Outer Banks are changed forever when they discover clues that may lead them to a fortune in hidden treasure.

 Outer Banks Season 4 Latest News 
         

Unfortunately, the most recent Outer Banks season 4 news sees delays due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While production on Outer Banks season 4 was scheduled to begin on May 30th, 2023, and conclude on December 15th, 2023, a report from ProductionWeekly (via What&#39;s On Netflix) stated that the start date was pushed back to June 12th, 2023. The extra time was given to the casting department to find extras from the Charleston, South Carolina area, and it was confirmed via Twitter that production did begin on June 12th. 

Due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, however, Outer Banks season 4 was officially halted. Over a month&#39;s worth of filming was completed by the time the strike officially went into action on July 14th, 2023, seeing the WGA and SAG-AFTRA unions striking together for the first time since the 1960s. However, since the strikes have been resolved, it can be assumed that Outer Banks has gotten back on track, though no official announcement has been made. 



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.






 Outer Banks Season 4 Is Confirmed 
          

The announcement that Outer Banks season 4 was confirmed came much earlier than expected. While celebrating the imminent release of Outer Banks season 3 in “Poguelandia,&#34; Chase Stokes announced onstage that Outer Banks season 4 had been renewed before season 3 premiered. Such an early renewal shows substantial faith in the series on Netflix’s part, but the viewing numbers for season 3 certainly justified their gamble.

The TUDUM teaser trailer for Outer Banks confirmed that all six of the “Pogues” will be returning to the Outer Banks season 4 cast. The trailer playfully shows each central character in sequence, starting with Sarah (Madelyn Cline), followed by Cleo (Carlacia Grant), Pope (Jonathan Daviss), Kiara (Madison Bailey), JJ (Rudy Pankow), and John B (Chase Stokes).

Though they haven&#39;t been officially announced yet, other expected returns include:

 Outer Banks Season 4 Story Details 
          

There isn&#39;t any Outer Banks season 4 news regarding the plot, but interviews with the creators and speculation based on the events of season 3 can give a strong impression of what&#39;s coming. The biggest clues for what to expect in season 4 come from the season 3 finale epilogue, set 18 months later. The closing moments of season 3’s final episode saw a man approaching the Pogues with a promising proposition. He has a captain&#39;s log from 1718 that contains information about the pirate Edward Teach, a.k.a. Blackbeard. By all indications, Outer Banks season 4 will see the Pogues on the hunt for the famed pirate’s treasure.

The Outer Banks season 3 epilogue also saw the main characters busy with their own pursuits. John B and Sarah are running a surf shop, Pope is at school, Kiara is saving turtles, and JJ bought a charter boat. The Outer Banks season 4 story will flesh out these developments and feature flashbacks to fill in the gaps from the last 18 months, as showrunners Josh Pate, Jonas Pate, and Shannon Burke confirmed. When asked whether Outer Banks season 4 will be the show’s last, the showrunners revealed (via EW) that they are no longer adhering to their initial plan of having the series run for only four or five seasons.

Presented at Netflix&#39;s TUDUM event, the Outer Banks season 4 trailer shows the Pogues in their natural habitat on Kildare Island in front of their reliable van, the Twinkie. The trailer doesn’t reveal much, but its playful tone and summery music are a good indication that in Outer Banks season 4, the series&#39; usual sense of fun is still intact, as is the connection between the group.
