## Literature Review
Love Is Blind fans have been awaiting the first baby from a couple on the show, and it&#39;s finally happened. Find out more about the pregnancy.




Love Is Blind has produced a few iconic couples, but the show made history this week as the first married couple from Love Is Blind announced their pregnancy. Season 5 was difficult to watch, with only one pair, Lydia Velez Gonzalez &amp; Milton Johnson, successfully tying the knot. Love Is Blind season 4 was significantly more fruitful, with three pairs, Chelsea Griffin &amp; Kwame Appiah, Tiffany Pennywell &amp; Brett Brown, and Bliss Poureetezadi &amp; Zack Goytowski saying yes at the altar. It&#39;s no surprise that one of these sets of lovebirds announced their pregnancy this week.




In an exclusive interview with People, Bliss and Zack happily revealed they were pregnant with their first child. According to the couple, they are looking forward to their &#34;beautiful blessing.&#34; Bliss elaborated, &#34;Babies are miracles and blessings, and I think we&#39;ve been so open to sharing our journey and our relationship with the world, and this is our next big beautiful thing. I&#39;m really happy and I hope that it brings joy to other people. It&#39;s definitely brought us a ton of joy.&#34; Zack, beaming with the pride of a soon-to-be father, added, &#34;I was incredibly happy. We both really wanted this and so we just felt really blessed that we were able to have this happen.&#34;


 Bliss &amp; Zackâ€™s Love Is Blind Journey Explained 
          

Despite becoming an idyllic married couple over the moon at the prospect of becoming parents, Bliss and Zack&#39;s journey on Love Is Blind wasn&#39;t exactly smooth sailing. While Bliss and Zack undoubtedly connected in the pods, Zack made the wrong choice by proposing to Irina Solomonova. When their lack of chemistry became clear in Mexico, Irina and Zack broke off their engagement. Bliss was rightfully reticent when Zack tried to connect with her again in Seattle, but she gave him another chance. The pair chose to get engaged, much to Bliss&#39; father&#39;s chagrin. However, he&#39;s since come around to their marriage after they passed their first wedding anniversary.




Bliss and Zack made it clear they were ready to have children after getting married in Love Is Blind season 4. While they were enjoying traveling the world together on After The Altar, they made it clear that children were something they would see in the near future. Their exclusive interview with People radiates their joy and gratitude that they have the opportunity to become parents. Both Zack and Bliss are nerdy and have a chemistry palpable in every scene of Love Is Blind, and they will make great parents. Their future child is fortunate to have them.

While Vanessa Lachey has yet to comment, she&#39;s likely thrilled at the prospect of the first official Love Is Blind baby. Bartise Bowden from Love Is Blind season 3 became a father with a relatively unknown woman in early 2023 after appearing on Perfect Match. Still, since the mother wasn&#39;t a star of the hit Netflix reality TV series, it didn&#39;t have the same effect. There&#39;s no better couple to usher in the first official baby from Love Is Blind than Bliss and Zack. Hopefully, Bliss will have a safe and healthy pregnancy, and more good news regarding the birth will come in spring 2024.
