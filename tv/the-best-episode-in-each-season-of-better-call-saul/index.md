## Literature Review

Better Call Saul shines with standout episodes in its 63-installment run, each season featuring an episode that shines brighter than the others.





Better Call Saul stands as a perfect spinoff, delivering exceptional episodes across its six-season run. Following Breaking Bad, which set the standard for prestige television, Vince Gilligan achieved another success by captivating audiences with intricate storytelling and compelling characters. The Breaking Bad prequel charts the transformation of Jimmy McGill from a struggling public defender into the morally compromised lawyer Saul Goodman. Across six seasons, Gilligan examines the complex relationship between Jimmy and his successful brother Chuck, as well as Jimmy&#39;s complicated romance with fellow attorney Kim Wexler.
With Breaking Bad season 6 already ended, the standout performances from Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, and Rhea Seehorn is an exemplifying presentation of turning an episode into a work of art. Though it produced only 63 episodes, the series contains several that stand out as the best from each season. These exceptional episodes showcase why Better Call Saul emerged from the shadow of its predecessor to become a dramatic masterpiece in its own right.









 








 1  Better Call Saul Season 1, Episode 6 
“Five-O”
        

&#34;Five-O&#34; stands out as the highlight of Better Call Saul&#39;s first season by delving into the tragic backstory of Mike Ehrmantraut. The episode reveals Mike as more than just the ruthless fixer for Gus Fring, showcasing his devotion to family and the guilt he carries from his son&#39;s death. When a crooked cop resurfaces to blackmail Mike over his role in that fateful event, Mike is forced to confront the truth he has long suppressed. Jonathan Banks delivers an emotional powerhouse performance that elicits new sympathy for his Breaking Bad character. Peeling back these complex layers in Mike&#39;s history provides the depth and complexity that makes &#34;Five-O&#34; the crown jewel of an otherwise slower-paced first season.
Additionally, this episode plants the seeds for his compromised morality in Breaking Bad. When Mike murders the crooked cops in cold blood, his methods preview the calculated killer to come. Mike’s anguish as he stares at his blood-spattered granddaughter drives home the heavy price of revenge. While his motives originate from family, &#34;Five-O&#34; shows how violence stains Mike&#39;s soul. This fateful turn from lawful avenger to hardened criminal in &#34;Five-O&#34; makes the episode pivotal for Mike&#39;s corrupted arc, proving Mike is one of the best characters of Better Call Saul.





 2  Better Call Saul Season 2, Episode 9 
“Nailed”


 







No episode better encapsulates the absurd humor that makes Better Call Saul unique than season 2&#39;s &#34;Nailed.&#34; The episode opens with Jimmy&#39;s latest ridiculous TV commercial exploiting patriotic imagery, setting the tone for his growing willingness to cut ethical corners. When Jimmy sabotages Chuck&#39;s ex-wife to force a speedy settlement, his cunning tactics highlight why image matters more than merit. The subplot of Mike using a pill-induced blackout to sneak into a police evidence room showcases the ingenious extremes characters will reach. Besides advancing pivotal arcs for Jimmy and Mike, &#34;Nailed&#34; lands comedically with its satire of shady legal dealings.





 3  Better Call Saul Season 3, Episode 5 
“Chicanery”
        

&#34;Chicanery&#34; sets itself apart from the rest in Better Call Saul season 3 for its riveting courtroom showdown between the McGill brothers. When Chuck aims to revoke Jimmy&#39;s law license, Jimmy masterfully manipulates Chuck&#39;s condition to portray him as mentally unstable. The brilliant scheming exemplifies why Jimmy&#39;s talents are wasted as an ethical lawyer. Michael McKean delivers a stunning monologue as the betrayed Chuck, but Bob Odenkirk&#39;s Jimmy checkmates his self-righteous brother in the end. Beyond the family drama, &#34;Chicanery&#34; exhibits the cleverness that enables Jimmy&#39;s moral compromise, making it the most memorable episode of the season.
            
 
 5 Reasons Chuck Is Better Call Saul&#39;s Most Tragic Character (&amp; 5 Reasons It&#39;s Howard) 
Better Call Saul was as tragic as Breaking Bad, if not more, and the two characters who suffered the most were arguably Chuck and Howard.



Not only does &#34;Chicanery&#34; showcase Jimmy outmaneuvering Chuck, it also examines the tragedy of their dysfunctional relationship and the damage done. When Chuck spews vitriol over Jimmy stealing from their father, his monologue reveals deep-rooted jealousy beneath the sanctimony. Meanwhile, Jimmy&#39;s ruthless exploitation of Chuck&#39;s condition destroys any hope of reconciliation between the brothers. Their courtroom confrontation highlights how Chuck&#39;s refusal to accept Jimmy forced him down the path of moral decay. By depicting the McGills as sympathetic antagonists locked in a toxic cycle, &#34;Chicanery&#34; adds an emotional weight that sticks long after the verdict.





 4  Better Call Saul Season 4, Episode 10 
“Winner”


 







The season 4 finale &#34;Winner&#34; earns its name by bookending Jimmy McGill&#39;s transformation into Saul Goodman. The episode opens with a bittersweet flashback of the McGill brothers harmonizing at a karaoke bar, highlighting their bond before their rift. When Jimmy gets reinstated as a lawyer, his impassioned speech ties his identity to the McGill name, making his decision to practice under the Saul Goodman moniker all the more impactful. As a culmination of Jimmy&#39;s compromises and consequences, &#34;Winner&#34; delivers the perfect closing note by promising sinister adventures still to come for the newly christened Saul.





 5  Better Call Saul Season 5, Episode 8 
“Bagman”
        

With its stark New Mexico landscapes and nail-biting tension, season 5&#39;s &#34;Bagman&#34; is arguably Better Call Saul&#39;s most intense episode. When Jimmy joins Mike to pick up $7 million for the Better Call Saul villains, the Salamancas, he soon realizes the danger of getting in bed with the cartel. As their desert cash run turns into a fight for survival, the characters showcase their desperation. Meanwhile, the episode examines how greed corrupts through ethical compromise, foreshadowing Jimmy&#39;s imminent transformation into Saul. Boasting some of the most striking visuals in the series, &#34;Bagman&#34; deserves its place as the highlight.
Beyond placing Jimmy on the path to Saul, &#34;Bagman&#34; also further develops Mike&#39;s morality. Mike&#39;s no-nonsense survival skills collide with Jimmy&#39;s naive panic during their ordeal. When a good Samaritan stops to help, Mike debates executing him in cold blood to protect their secret. Though he relents, Jonathan Banks wordlessly conveys Mike&#39;s resignation about losing his humanity. This subtle characterization builds on the groundwork of tragedy established in &#34;Five-O.&#34; By pitting Mike and Jimmy&#39;s different codes against each other, &#34;Bagman&#34; uses its moral crucible to forge potent questions about the costs of compromise.





 6  Better Call Saul Season 6, Episode 13 
“Saul Gone”
        

The highly anticipated series finale &#34;Saul Gone&#34; delivers an emotionally gratifying conclusion to the saga of Jimmy McGill. The action of the episode cuts between the present-day and flashbacks to Jimmy&#39;s last conversation with Kim. Her faith that Jimmy can change elicits his confession in court, finally taking responsibility despite the consequences. The candid courtroom scene proves Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn&#39;s chemistry persists through the end. By embracing the light still left in Jimmy instead of the sinister Saul, the finale earns its catharsis. Providing satisfying closure, &#34;Saul Gone&#34; ends Better Call Saul on a redemptive high note.
