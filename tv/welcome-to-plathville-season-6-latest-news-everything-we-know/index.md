## Literature Review
The current season may be over, but many are wondering when Welcome To Plathville season 6 will be after the drama of Welcome To Plathville season 5.




Welcome To Plathville season 5 finished off a dramatic season with Ethan Plath and Olivia Plath’s trouble marriage ending in shambles and viewers are already looking ahead to what comes next for the family and the series.

Regardless of where it’s headed, many are curious about Welcome To Plathville season 6.

The typical Welcome To Plathville cast would all be likely to return for another season, with the exception of one important cast member.

Despite the fact that she’s been able to explore herself and grow being on Welcome To Plathville, the series focusing so deeply on her ex-husband’s family may not be a great place for her to return to post-divorce. It remains to be seen if Olivia will appear on Welcome To Plathville season 6.
