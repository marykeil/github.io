# Deep Star Wars Lore Explains Ahsoka s Great Mothers - &amp; The Price Thrawn Paid To Awaken Them


## SUMMARY 



  Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers likely have a unique connection to death, just like Mother Talzin and the Nightsisters in general.   The Great Mothers could be ancient and have existed on Peridea for thousands of years, perhaps even being present when the world was cut off and it became a graveyard for the purrgil.   Thrawn may have awakened the Great Mothers through sacrifice. Having brought all the other fallen Nightsister exiles with him to Dathomir, they will likely require sacrifice for their resurrections as well.

## Literature Review
Deep Star Wars lore involving the Nightsisters helps explain the existence of Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers on Peridea and their relationship with Thrawn.




Star Wars lore provides strong insights regarding Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers and their relationship with Grand Admiral Thrawn. Living on the extragalactic world of Peridea, the Great Mothers were responsible for helping Thrawn make contact with the known Star Wars galaxy, having helped him return home from his exile which lasted just over a decade. However, there&#39;s still quite a bit of mystery surrounding the Great Mothers&#39; past and why &#34;the threads of fate&#34; demanded their service to Thrawn.




As exciting as the Great Mothers&#39; are who will undoubtedly continue the legacy of the Nightsisters in the future of the franchise, the trio is distinctly odd. Although Peridea was confirmed to be the original homeworld of the Nightsisters, it was confirmed that the Force witches eventually migrated to the known galaxy and settled on the world of Dathomir in the ancient past of the Star Wars timeline. However, it was not revealed when, how, and why the Great Mothers remained beyond clues pointing toward some sort of epic tragedy. To that end, there&#39;s a likely answer to be found courtesy of the preexisting Star Wars canon.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    


 Nightsister Great Mothers Do Not Die Easily 
Mother Talzin Had Influence Long After Death
         




As has been seen in the animated shows such as The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels as well as in the live-action Ahsoka, the Nightsisters have a very different connection to the Force compared to the Jedi or Sith. Their abilities in the Force itself are wholly different, and this includes the relationship the Nightisters have with death. For example, Count Dooku&#39;s desire for revenge against the Force witches resulted in the resurrection of several Nightsisters who were revived as the undead to protect their still-living sisters.

Furthermore, Great Mothers like Talzin were able to master death. Talzin in particular still had a role and presence long after she&#39;d given up her physical form during General Greivous&#39; massacre of Dathomir. As seen in The Clone Wars and the Son of Dathomir comics set in the aftermath, Mother Talzin appeared multiple times. Even though she was only an incorporeal spirit, she was still able to affect and influence the galaxy. To that end, it stands to reason that Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers could be the same, and they very well could have been dead before Thrawn&#39;s exile on what remained of their original homeworld.






 Nightsister Magick Means The Great Mothers Could Be Ancient 
Are They From The Galaxy&#39;s Earliest Age?
          

Assuming that Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers also have mastery over death just as Mother Talzin did, it means the trio of powerful Force witches could be extremely ancient. Although there&#39;s still the mystery as to what exactly happened to Peridea, it&#39;s quite possible that the Great Mothers could have been alive whenever Peridea was cut off from the rest of the galaxy. Ahsoka confirms that this dark event changed the purrgil&#39;s migration patterns, turning the world into a graveyard where the star whales would only come to die. Likewise, the Dathomiri kingdom that thrived on Peridea&#39;s surface fell apart as the world turned into a wasteland.

This would explain why the Great Mothers are on Peridea when there were plenty of Nightsisters in the known galaxy. They were effectively cut off and stranded on Perdiea when whatever happened to the world happened. It also explained why they were so eager to serve Thrawn as he was their means of finally getting off the planet after thousands of years. However, the idea that the Great Mothers were dead for most of that time is also likely, having only been reborn once Thrawn inadvertently arrived with Ezra Bridger following the Battle of Lothal as seen in the series finale of Star Wars Rebels.




                  New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s every upcoming Star Wars movie in development - including Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order, the Dawn of the Jedi, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu!    



 Thrawn &#34;Awoke&#34; The Great Mothers Through Sacrifice 
Just Like Talzin With Count Dooku
          

Although Mother Talzin lost her physical form, the Son of Dathomir comics saw her being reborn and fully resurrected via a sacrificial ceremony where she began draining Dooku&#39;s life force whom her son Maul had captured. However, the return to her physical body did make her more vulnerable, and she was finally killed by the combined efforts of Palpatine, Dooku, and Grievous. Nevertheless, the idea that a Great Mother&#39;s body can be fully reconstituted through sacrifice is a key reveal when it comes to Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers.




It&#39;s been suggested that Grand Admiral Thrawn and his forces faced a fair amount of struggle and conflict during their decade-long exile. After all, something has to be responsible for the disrepair and damaged state of the Night Troopers&#39; armor beyond normal wear and tear. To that end, it&#39;s not a stretch to suggest that any potential deaths might have served as the perfect sacrifice to awaken the Great Mothers, leading to their service where they helped Thrawn make his way back to the known Star Wars galaxy, provided he brought them along as well.



 Thrawn Seems To Have Brought The Rest Of The Nightsister Exiles With Him 
More Sacrifice Will Be Required
          

It&#39;s all but confirmed that the crates Thrawn&#39;s forces brought on board his Star Destroyer from the Nightsister temple&#39;s catacombs are filled with the corpses of fallen Nightsisters were were presumably cut off as well when Peridea faced its ancient dark event. Having headed immediately for Dathomir itself upon his return, it&#39;s evident that Thrawn has plans for the Force Witches and that Ahsoka&#39;s Great Mothers will continue serving him going forward during the New Republic Era. As such, one can imagine that these other Nightsisters will require sacrifice for resurrection to happen as well.
