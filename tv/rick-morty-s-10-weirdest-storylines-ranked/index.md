## Literature Review
Rick and Morty uses its absurdist humor to tell some of the strangest stories on television. The unpredictable plots are one of the show’s trademarks.




From its very first episode, Rick and Morty established its own unique brand of zany humor and absurdist storytelling. The sitcom often completely ignores the conventions of the format, using the freedom of animation to its full potential by creating bizarre characters and stories. A lot of this strangeness derives from Rick&#39;s portal gun, which gifts him access to different dimensions. Still, other movies and TV shows with multiverses rarely make things as weird as Rick and Morty does. The show&#39;s unique visual design creates plenty of strange characters, whether they&#39;re aliens, superheroes, mutants, or anything else the show&#39;s writers can dream up.
There are no limits to the multiverse of Rick and Morty, and there are also no limits to the show&#39;s imaginative plot lines. Even episodes which start off in a relatively pedestrian setting can escalate to nonsensical fun at any moment. Rick and Morty&#39;s peculiar stories all stem from the show&#39;s goal of probing the traditions of storytelling and people&#39;s assumptions about the universe. Rick and Morty is one of the most creative sci-fi shows around. It both parodies and pays tribute to the genre, acknowledging the many tropes which can sometimes hinder stories from fully exploring their potential. Rick and Morty tells stories without any traditional limitations.

 10  Rick Becomes A Turkey 
Season 5, Episode 6, &#34;Rick and Morty&#39;s Thanksploitation Spectacular&#34;
        

Rick&#39;s commitment to such a ludicrous plot is matched only by the President’s willingness to stop him. 

After yet again becoming the number one target of the U.S. Government, Rick resorts to his old tactic of turning into a turkey and receiving a Thanksgiving pardon from the President. Season 5, episode 6, “Rick and Morty’s Thanksploitation Spectacular” would be strange enough if this was how it ended, but Rick’s plan is only the set-up. His commitment to such a ludicrous plot is matched only by the President’s willingness to stop him. Both men engage in an escalating game of wits, which eventually evolves to include a half-man-half-spider mutant version of Franklin Roosevelt and a war between ancient aliens and turkey-dinosaurs.





 9  Birdperson &amp; The Battle Of Blood Ridge 
Season 5, Episode 8, &#34;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort&#34;
        

Rick’s ability to hop between different realities with ease makes it difficult for him to form any deep attachments, but he cares for Birdperson, one of Rick and Morty’s best characters. Birdperson is consumed by his war with the Galactic Federation, although this largely takes place in the background of Rick and Morty. Rick doesn’t concern himself much with the war until Birdperson’s wife, Tammy, turns out to be an agent of the Federation whose mission it is to capture both Birdperson and Rick. The Federation’s vendetta against the duo goes back to the Battle of Blood Ridge, seen only in Birdperson’s memories.





 8  Rise Of The Numbericons 
Season 7, Episode 8, &#34;Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie&#34;
        

Season 7, episode 8, “Rise of the Numbericons: The Movie” is based on a post-credits scene from season 2, episode 5, “Get Schwifty,” which in turn is based on nothing more than Ice-T’s name. It’s not one of the best episodes of Rick and Morty season 7, but it’s certainly a bold decision to have an entire episode without Rick. The episode focuses on the war between letters and numbers, and Water-T’s attempts to decode a mysterious prophecy with the help of Morty and Mr. Goldenfold. The post-credits scene sets up another movie, “Magma T &amp; Ice Cube in: Challenge of the Geomitrons.”





 7  Morty&#39;s Real Family 
Season 1, Episode 6, &#34;Rick Potion #9&#34;
        

Morty mostly treats his family as anyone would, but he and Rick both know that Morty’s home dimension deteriorated into a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by Cronenberg-style mutants. In season 1, episode 6, “Rick Potion #9,” Rick’s experiments ruin Earth beyond repair, and Rick finds a new dimension for him and Morty to live in. They abandon their family, and the first thing they must do in their new home is to bury the versions of themselves they find there. “Rick Potion #9” is the first time Morty realizes there can be terrible consequences for his adventures. It also details the finite nature of the multiverse.





 6  Time-Traveling Snakes 
Season 4, Episode 5, &#34;Rattlestar Ricklactica&#34;


 







The whole premise of season 4, episode 5, “Rattlestar Ricklactica” hinges on the fact that Rick’s spaceship manages to burst a tire while flying through the vacuum of space. A snake soon appears and bites Morty. From there, Morty’s attempts to make amends sends a planet full of intelligent snakes into a global war. There’s a clear parody of The Terminator played out with snakes and snake-like robots, but the snake planet also provides a good sandbox for a number of other time-traveling misadventures. Rick and Morty tends to stay away from time travel, and the paradoxes and tedious historical rewriting of the snake planet show why this is smart.

With time-traveling spaces snakes, Jurassic Park parodies, and even an appearance from Jesus, Rick and Morty&#39;s Christmas episodes are never dull.









 5  The Decoy War 
Season 5, Episode 2, &#34;Mortyplicity&#34;
        

Rick’s adventures get him into a lot of trouble, and he constantly has entire planets, the Galactic Federation, and the Council of Ricks going after him. To maintain a buffer zone between him and those trying to kill him, he sets up a series of decoy families to confuse any potential attackers. Soon, the decoys figure out that if they aren’t real, Rick could easily kill them at any time, and every decoy family begins fighting one another. The episode supports Rick and Morty’s nihilistic approach to the infinite expanse of the universe. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter who’s real or who survives.





 4  Tommy&#39;s Survival In Froopyland 
Season 3, Episode 9, &#34;The ABC&#39;s Of Beth&#34;
        

The visual design of the half-human offspring is weird even by the high standards of Rick and Morty. 

When Beth was younger, Rick created a dimension for her to use as a playground, filled with rainbow rivers and bouncy ground. Beth loses her friend Tommy in Froopyland, and she doesn’t return until decades later. In one of Rick and Morty’s darkest episodes, Tommy reveals that he has sustained himself over the years by mating with Froopyland’s magical creatures and eating the offspring. The visual design of the half-human offspring is weird even by the high standards of Rick and Morty. Setting a story about incestual cannibalism in a child-friendly fantasy world is particularly disturbing, and yet another reminder of the horrific consequences of Rick’s experiments.





 3  Pickle Rick 
Season 3, Episode 3, &#34;Pickle Rick&#34;


 







Although it has been almost memed into oblivion, season 3, episode 3, “Pickle Rick” remains a great showcase of Rick and Morty’s ability to inject absurd story lines with genuine tension. Rick turns himself into a pickle to avoid having to attend a family therapy session, but he must then engineer a mech-suit from discarded garbage and dead rats to fight his way back home. “Pickle Rick” is a quirky premise to begin with, and there are very few shows that would even attempt something so unusual, but Rick and Morty brings the story full circle and completes Rick’s emotional journey at the therapy session.





 2  Mr. Poopybutthole&#39;s Relationship With The Smith Family 
Season 2, Episode 4, &#34;Total Rickall&#34;


 







Although he started off as a ridiculous punch line, Mr. Poopy Butthole’s character developed into so much more. He first appears in season 2, episode 4, “Total Rickall,” when Beth shoots him because she believes he is an alien parasite implanting memories into her head. Mr. Poopybutthole has made a few more appearances, often breaking the fourth wall to wrap up a season finale. Gradually, his life has gotten worse and worse, after he lost his job and his wife left him. In season 7, he enters a different dimension to hijack the life of another Mr. Poopybutthole. Hopefully, Rick and Morty season 8 returns to this story line.





 1  The Story Train 
Season 4, Episode 6, &#34;Never Ricking Morty&#34;
        

Rick and Morty often can’t contain its surreal humor to just a few stories each season, and the show uses an anthology format, like in the interdimensional cable episodes, to squeeze in some rapid-fire absurdity. Season 4, episode 6, “Never Ricking Morty” features several fast-paced stories, but the overarching narrative involves one of Rick and Morty’s best villains. Story Lord can trap his enemies inside narrative structures, and the show uses his ability to comment on the conventions of storytelling and the show itself. “Never Ricking Morty” combines small slices of surrealism with a story which examines and shatters every convention of TV storytelling.
