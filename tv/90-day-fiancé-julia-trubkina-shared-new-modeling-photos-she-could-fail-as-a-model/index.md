## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Julia Trubkina&#39;s launched a modeling career, and based on fan reactions, it might not be the right career choice.  




Julia Trubkina from 90 Day Fiancé is trying her hand at modeling again, but she seems to lack the necessary skills. The 30-year-old reality star first appeared in the franchise in 2020. She joined 90 Day Fiancé season 8 and pursued her American beau, Brandon Gibbs. From the beginning, Julia shared excellent chemistry with her partner. However, she couldn’t impress her in-laws, who continually interfered in her life. While Julia married Brandon, she decided not to stay at his family farm. The couple moved to a new house to live independently.




It took Julia several months to form a stable relationship with her father-in-law, Ron Gibbs, and her mother-in-law, Betty Gibbs. However, befriending them didn’t resolve all her issues. In 2022, the Russian 90 Day Fiancé star was having trouble getting permission to stay in the United States. She was afraid that immigration officials would kick her out of the country. Julia also lost some important papers after a thief stole her purse. She clashed with a neighbor in 2023, and shared many worrying posts on social media. However, she stayed motivated, and returned to bodybuilding in August 2023.

 Julia Isn’t Focused &amp; Changed Careers Several Times 

 




While Julia&#39;s focused on her new fitness journey, she recently shared some modeling shots on Instagram. The 90 Day Fiancé star’s career history&#39;s why she hasn’t received much praise for her modeling photos. Julia&#39;s tried her hand at numerous things in the past three years, and didn&#39;t really wildly succeed at any of them. Julia doesn’t seem to have a passion for any particular line of work. She appears to change her jobs based on her mood. A few years ago, she was into marketing. Sometime later, she was a comedian, and then she promised to compete in fitness competitions. The reality star didn’t stick with those careers.



 Julia’s Makeup Receives Criticism 

 

Some social media users also disliked Julia’s modeling photos because of her makeup. They think she wears too much of it, as Julia&#39;s always encouraged people to embrace their real selves. She’s photogenic but not an expert makeup artist like Tiffany Franco. Some of Julia’s modeling photos didn’t impress her followers because they thought her cosmetics ruined her pictures. Some also felt that she used filters on top of her pictures, or edited them to accentuate her facial features. They felt that those tweaks looked odd. A social media user wrote, “too much make up.” Another user commented, “I wish this wasn’t so edited.”






 Julia Needs To Work On Her Poses &amp; Body Language 
          

Since Julia isn’t a professional model, she still has a lot to learn about poses and facial expressions. Unfortunately, some of her new modeling photos are lackluster. Julia&#39;s poses seem outdated. The only way for her to improve her skills is to dedicate time and effort to modeling. Perhaps she could find a mentor who might help her to excel. Julia can probably take tips from other 90 Day Fiancé stars, such as Juliana Custodio and Yara Zaya, who shine in their fashion-forward modeling pictures.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
