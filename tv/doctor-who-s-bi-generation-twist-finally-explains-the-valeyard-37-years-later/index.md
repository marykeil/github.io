# Doctor Who s Bi-Generation Twist Finally Explains The Valeyard 37 Years Later


## SUMMARY 



  The introduction of bi-generation in Doctor Who opens the possibility for the return of classic villain the Valeyard.   Russell T Davies&#39; theory suggests that every Doctor in the show&#39;s history has bi-generated, creating a Doctor Who multiverse.   Bi-generation means there could be an incredible number of Doctors in the Doctor Who universe, including multiple versions of the Valeyard.

## Literature Review

One of Doctor Who&#39;s classic villains has always had a mysterious backstory, but bi-generation could allow him to be sufficiently explained.




The introduction of bi-generation to Doctor Who led to a lot of unanswered questions, but it may also explain a classic villain known as the Valeyard. The Doctor&#39;s division into both David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor and Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth was a huge addition to the show&#39;s lore. It means there are now at least two active Doctors at all times within the Doctor Who universe. The showrunner has also suggested that Fourteen and Fifteen are not alone. This means that other iterations of the Time Lord, including the Valeyard, could also return at any point.




The Valeyard, played by Michael Jayston, first appeared in Doctor Who in 1986, during a story arc called &#34;The Trial of a Time Lord.&#34; Although his origins have never been officially confirmed, the Master informs the Doctor that the Valeyard is a darker version of the Doctor from somewhere beyond his twelfth regeneration. While this provides some background for the mysterious villain, Doctor Who&#39;s shocking bi-generation twist offers up a more satisfying explanation regarding the Valeyard&#39;s origin. It could also accommodate a return of the Valeyard in Doctor Who season 14 or beyond.

                  Doctor Who: Every Doctor &amp; Who Played Them (In Chronological Order)   Doctor Who has been played by a crop of fantastic actors going back several decades, and each version has been both unique and memorable.   


 Every Version Of The Doctor Bigenerated In Doctor Who&#39;s 60th Anniversary 
The process has had a potentially huge impact on the Doctor Who canon
         




In a video shared on Twitter (now known as &#34;X&#34;), showrunner Russell T Davies shared his theories regarding what happened to the Doctor&#39;s timeline during Fourteen&#39;s unusual regeneration scene. Speaking on a commentary track for &#34;The Giggle,&#34; the ending of the Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials, Davies claims, &#34;The whole timeline bi-generated then.&#34; This suggests that every version of the Doctor survived their respective regeneration processes, and continued in their current form, each also spawning a new Doctor.

If this is true, then every Doctor there has ever been still exists, creating a form of Doctor Who multiverse. This not only includes every past and future Doctor, but versions of the Time Lord with alternate titles such as the War Doctor and the Valeyard. As such, any regeneration could return to Doctor Who at any time. While certain actors, such as William Hartnell as the First Doctor, can no longer return due to passing away, the First Doctor has since appeared in the modern era due to him being recast.






The First Doctor is portrayed by David Bradley in the 2017 Doctor Who Christmas special, &#34;Twice Upon a Time,&#34; where he stars alongside Peter Capaldi&#39;s Twelfth Doctor.






 Matt Smith&#39;s Doctor Can Regenerate Into The Valeyard 
Smith&#39;s Doctor was originally the final version of the Time Lord
          

At the time of the Valeyard&#39;s debut, the Doctor, along with the other Time Lords, could only regenerate twelve times. This would mean that the Doctor had the potential to take thirteen different forms. While this has since changed due to revelations in the Doctor Who timeless child storyline, the rule of twelve was in place at the time of Matt Smith&#39;s regeneration. Despite Smith holding the title of the Eleventh Doctor, he had actually used up all his regenerations. One of his regenerations was used to take the form of the War Doctor, who came between Eight and Nine.




In addition, David Tennant&#39;s Tenth Doctor aborted a regeneration in Doctor Who season 4, but this still used up one of his cycles. As such, Matt Smith&#39;s Eleventh Doctor was actually his thirteenth and final form at the time. If the Master was correct about the Valeyard coming after the Doctor&#39;s final regeneration, then this would be where the Valeyard would appear. Russell T Davies&#39; theory about every Doctor bi-generating would mean Eleven survived the events of his final episode, and the Valeyard emerged from his body as Fifteen did from Fourteen in &#34;The Giggle.&#34;

                  10 Classic Doctor Who Villains Who Should Return After The Toymaker   57 years later, the Toymaker is finally returning to Doctor Who, but there are plenty of other classic era villains who are yet to reappear.    

Seeing as this didn&#39;t happen on-screen, one theory could be that the Doctor&#39;s history was altered as he bi-generated in &#34;The Giggle.&#34; If so, Matt Smith&#39;s &#34;final&#34; scene would now include the Valeyard, showing the villain&#39;s introduction to the Doctor Who timeline. However, the Valeyard shown in the 1980s episodes may have regenerated or bi-generated himself since coming into being, so he may not necessarily have the same face.






 Bigeneration Means Countless Other Doctors Exist In The Whoniverse 
The world will never be short of Doctors again
          

Bi-generation doesn&#39;t just account for the Fifteenth Doctor, it means the exponential growth in the number of Doctors throughout the Doctor Who universe. Starting with Hartnell, all of these Doctors will have at least doubled in number. However, The Timeless Child story revealed there are a great many versions of the Time Lord prior to Hartnell that the Doctor cannot remember. The only version with any substance shown so far is Ruth, the Fugitive Doctor. If the countless other pre-Hartnell Doctors also bi-generated, there would be an incredible number of Doctors roaming the universe.

If the Valeyard did stem from the Eleventh Doctor, then he too could have bi-generated several times between then and his first appearance opposite Colin Baker&#39;s Sixth Doctor. This would mean that while there would be far fewer versions of the Valeyard than the Doctor, but the number could still have increased. Seeing as the Valeyard is supposedly an amalgamation of all the darkest facets of the Doctor, this would make them all formidable enemies.






 Doctor Who&#39;s Bigeneration Twist Makes A Valeyard Return Possible 
The origin of the classic Doctor Who villain can now be more effectively explained
          

The original appearances of the Valeyard were shrouded in mystery, with there being no solid proof as to where he came from. If he were to return to the show, then a more detailed explanation would need to be provided. Although the Doctor&#39;s timeline has become infinitely more complex since the events of &#34;The Giggle,&#34; the lore about the Valeyard coming as the &#34;final&#34; version of the Doctor could still ring true.

Peter Capaldi has already been shown to canonically follow Matt Smith as the next Doctor, but the process of bi-generation affords the show&#39;s writers to slot the Valeyard in between the two iterations. As such, while it may have been too messy to bring the Valeyard back to Doctor Who before now, it&#39;s never made more sense to do so. The numbering system remains in place for the main Doctors, but they have been essentially rendered defunct.




                  Why So Many Classic Doctor Who Episodes Are Missing   Premiering in 1963, Doctor Who is an iconic sci-fi TV show with a large fanbase, many of whom will never get the chance to see some classic episodes.   

It&#39;s also possible that the Valeyard could be in the future for Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor. Technically, every Doctor after Matt Smith&#39;s is beyond their traditional limit of twelve regenerations. Therefore, the Master&#39;s statement about the Valeyard&#39;s origin would still be true even if Jayston&#39;s character appeared even further down the line. Due to Chris Chibnall&#39;s Doctor Who changes, including the Doctor now having unlimited regenerations, the door is now always open for the return of the Valeyard.

The process of regeneration in Doctor Who has undergone an overhaul more than once during the modern era, and Davies&#39; addition of bi-generation adds to the rich tapestry of the long-running BBC sci-fi story. So, the mystery of the Valeyard may not ever be fully solved, but bringing him back to Doctor Who after such a lengthy absence could provide at least a few key answers to the questions that surround him.






The classic run of Doctor Who is available to stream on Tubi, whereas the revival era is on Max. All episodes of Doctor Who from 2023 onward are available on Disney&#43;.
