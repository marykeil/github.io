## Literature Review
Yohan Geronimo’s intentions were always materialistic, and he showed that throughout his relationship with Daniele Gates on 90 Day Fiancé.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Yohan Geronimo continually displayed behaviors that showed he never loved Daniele Gates. Yohan and Daniele met at a resort in the Dominican Republic where she was vacationing. Within five months of meeting, Daniele married Yohan during the pair&#39;s reality TV appearance on 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise season 2.




Despite a language barrier, Daniele believed she and Yohan&#39;s spiritual connection was enough to make their relationship work. However, as the couple began to plan their lives together, questions about Yohan&#39;s motives started being raised due to certain red flags in Yohan&#39;s behavior. Despite Daniele&#39;s efforts, her relationship with Yohan was full of arguments and fights, culminating in their eventual breakup. In retrospect, Yohan exhibited several signs that showed he never really loved Daniele, as he claimed.

 Yohan Geronimo Got A Dollar Sign Tattoo After He Met Daniele Gates 
          




Due to the pace at which couples get together on 90 Day Fiancé, the cast&#39;s family, friends, and fans regularly ask questions regarding their intentions. When Daniele started dating Yohan, her friends were concerned about whether he was only using her for money. Daniele&#39;s friend, Sophy, called Yohan a scammer who only married Daniele for ulterior motives. While the weight was on Yohan to prove he genuinely loved Daniele, some of his actions betrayed his love confessions to the 42-year-old school teacher.

After Daniele and Yohan started dating in Love in Paradise: The Caribbean, A 90 Day Story, he immediately got the dollar sign tattoo on his arm. Yohan&#39;s decision to get the tattoo upset Daniele, who became concerned about Yohan&#39;s intentions; she also complained about how he wouldn&#39;t even take his wallet out whenever she was around. After meeting his supposed wife and partner, one would expect Yohan to get Daniele&#39;s name tattooed, not a dollar sign. However, his decision to get the dollar sign tattoo showed what he aimed to get out of the relationship.






 Yohan Geronimo Wanted The American Dream (Not Daniele Gates) 
         

Once it became evident that Daniele was prepared to take her relationship with Yohan to the next level, the fitness instructor was clear and straightforward about what he expected from his wife-to-be. Yohan wanted to move to the United States after his spousal visa got approved. He consistently spoke of his desire to move to New York City to make more money to send back home to his family in the Dominican Republic. Yohan&#39;s insistence on moving to the U.S. made Daniele hide her plan to retire to the Dominican Republic from Yohan.

When Yohan eventually learned Daniele was unwilling to help him fulfill the &#34;American Dream,&#34; his interest in their relationship decreased. The revelation also led to a blowout argument between the two. If Yohan was really interested in Daniele and not money, he wouldn&#39;t have minded her decision to retire in his native Dominican Republic, where they could build their lives together.






 Yohan Geronimo Cheated On Daniele Gates 

 

During the November 20 episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, Yohan and Daniele had a massive fight about money, leading him to move out of their home. Afterward, Daniele got a heartbreaking surprise when a woman reached out to her on social media to reveal she began an affair with Yohan a month before they got married. The mystery woman also disclosed that her relationship with Yohan had continued for over two years. The cheating revelations saddened Daniele, and the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way duo would break up shortly afterward, no thanks to the culmination of Yohan&#39;s shameless gold-digging antics.
