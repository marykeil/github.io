## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé alum Varya Malina has important news to share with fans. She is revealing what happens next in her partner Geoffrey Paschel&#39;s case.




Former 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days cast member Varya Malina provided a huge update on Geoffrey Paschel&#39;s case. Varya is a 33-year-old Russian woman who came to America during Before the 90 Days season 4 to get engaged to Geoffrey. Varya had met the Knoxville, Tennessee, man on a dating website. He flew to see her in person on the reality TV show, which was filmed in November 2019. Varya turned down Geoffrey&#39;s proposal the first time. However, she came to the U.S. herself and surprised Geoffrey while he was dating an ex named Mary Wallace.




Geoffrey is currently in prison, and Varya had news to share with her social media followers via her Instagram Live. Someone asked her, &#34;How&#39;s Geoffrey?&#34; and Varya said that she was going to have a call with Geoffrey&#39;s family and his lawyer&#39;s team &#34;soon&#34; to discuss a strategy of &#34;filing to the supreme court.&#34;


 

Varya began living in America sometime in December 2020 and confirmed her situation after months of fan speculation in April 2021. Meanwhile, Geoffrey was found guilty of aggravated kidnapping, domestic violence, and interference with an emergency call in October 2021 for a domestic dispute involving his ex-fiancée, Kristen Wilson, in June 2019.

In her video, Varya also asked fans to keep their fingers crossed and said they&#39;ve shown various documents to &#34;several smart people&#34; and will discuss Geoffrey&#39;s prospects soon. Geoffrey was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his crimes in February 2022. Varya stayed by Geoffrey&#39;s side throughout his trial and has kept updating fans on social media about what&#39;s next for her partner. Geoffrey filed a motion for retrial, which was also denied, and he was given 30 days to appeal. Geoffrey&#39;s appeal was denied in September 2023. Varya broke down on her Instagram Stories while telling her followers about the news that left her feeling devastated.

Geoffrey was raising two adult boys and a 4-year-old son from two previous relationships when he met Varya. He was grieving the loss of his newborn son Kazhem, and it was hard for him to trust women because he’d had four failed marriages. However, Varya gave him hope. “She is everything and more,” he told the cameras. Back then, Varya wished to move to the U.S. and live in a big city like New York City. Geoffrey had questioned Varya’s intentions and wondered if she was using him as a meal ticket. Varya eventually came to the U.S. by winning a Green Card lottery.




She never got to fulfill her dream of settling down in NYC because she had to stay in Geoffrey’s Knoxville home, managing his properties. Varya makes time for herself by taking frequent trips in and around the country. The 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star will be going to Boston next. Geoffrey is not a big fan of Varya’s adventures. He fought with her in May 2022 when she went on a cruise five days after his appeal. It appears Geoffrey is being controlling of Varya even when he’s in prison, although she doesn’t really mention it.
