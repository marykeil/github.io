Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina claims that fellow icon of the game, Rachel Reilly, was ghosted by the Big Brother Reindeer Games producers because they wanted Nicole Franzel on the show instead. Big Brother Reindeer Games will welcome back nine former players to compete in holiday-themed games. The players won&#39;t be living in the house, but instead will compete in games in order to win a $100,000 grand prize. The cast includes Nicole, Britney Haynes, Cameron Hardin, Cody Calafiore, Danielle Reyes, Frankie Grande, Josh Martinez, Taylor Hale, and Xavier Prather.

In an X Post, Janelle aired her grievances about Big Brother Reindeer Games.


 

Janelle wrote, &#34;CBS called my bestie Rachel Reilly to be on Reindeer games and GHOSTED her for Nicole. I’m absolutely disgusted by this decision! Rachel is a f*****g queen! How dare they! What are your thoughts on this? and why so few women??! #BBReindeerGames #ReindeerGames.&#34; Janelle later commented, &#34;I&#39;m terribly upset for my friend!&#34; In the comments section, Rachel&#39;s sister and Big Brother alum Elissa Slater, wrote, &#34;I love you.&#34; Rachel hasn&#39;t commented, but Elissa&#39;s statement speaks volumes because it indicates that she appreciates Janelle&#39;s support for her sister. Janelle and Rachel also appeared on Snake in the Grass together.

 Janelle Pierzina Doesn’t Care If Big Brother Ghosts Her Next 
          

When X user @IaurmaniTonreau warned Janelle, &#34;they gonna ghost you next girlie,&#34; Janelle replied, &#34;I don’t care?!!&#34; with a shrugging emoji. Janelle won&#39;t be appearing on Big Brother Reindeer Games because she&#39;s under contract with Peacock for her upcoming appearance on The Traitors season 2. However, it seems that she&#39;s not afraid to burn her bridge with CBS anyway. Janelle has never been afraid to speak up for what&#39;s right, and she won&#39;t allow anyone to silence her.

Janelle&#39;s goal appears to be not only to defend her friend Rachel, but also to shade Nicole, with whom she&#39;s had a long-running feud. It began in 2019, when Janelle, Rachel, Elissa, and Nicole were contestants on The Amazing Race 31, and Nicole and her partner and now-husband, Victor Arroyo, betrayed Rachel and Elissa. After that, Janelle stopped trusting Nicole. Her dislike for Nicole was evident when they both competed on Big Brother 22. Since then, Janelle has called out Nicole for her alleged pre-gaming for Big Brother 22. In Nicole&#39;s Big Brother 22 goodbye message to Janelle, she uninvited her to her wedding. Janelle later insulted Nicole&#39;s wedding plans on social media.




Janelle seems to be genuinely upset by Rachel&#39;s alleged slight by the Big Brother Reindeer Games producers. Rachel has always been one of the former houseguests who&#39;s promoted a legends season, so she would&#39;ve been a logical choice to participate in Big Brother Reindeer Games. Janelle also made a valid point about how perhaps there could&#39;ve been another woman on the show, and both Rachel and Nicole could&#39;ve been cast. It&#39;s admirable that Janelle spoke up for Rachel if this is true. Whatever the truth may be, it&#39;s clear that Janelle won&#39;t be rooting for Nicole as she competes on Big Brother Reindeer Games.

Big Brother Reindeer Games premieres Monday, December 11 at 9 p.m. on CBS.
