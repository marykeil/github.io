## Literature Review
There is one Married at First Sight season 17 couple&#39;s relationship that stands out as the most unhealthy because of their incompatibilities. 




The Married at First Sight season 17 couples have all had their share of issues, but one couple&#39;s dynamic stands out as the most unhealthy. The season was meant to showcase five couples, but viewers have been left with only three. Michael was ditched at the altar by his bride, who said she wasn&#39;t ready to marry a stranger. Lauren and Orion had several tense miscommunications on the honeymoon, which caused Orion to ask for a divorce before they started the living together portion of the experience.




Married at First Sight has a panel of three experts, Dr. Pepper Schwartz, Pastor Calvin &#34;Cal&#34; Roberson, and Dr. Pia Holec, who were tasked with matching up the Denver hopefuls. They paired people based on a variety of compatibility factors along with their personal preferences and non-negotiables. The experts have only had a 6% success rate over the last three seasons, and this season will also contribute to that low number.

 All Three Married At First Sight Couples Are Having Marital Issues 
          

The three remaining Married at First Sight season 17 couples are Brennan and Emily, Clare and Cameron, and Becca and Austin. Brennan and Emily seemed to have a great time on their honeymoon, and they bonded over their shared interests and similar visions about how they want their futures to look. They also share the same professional drive. However, upon returning from the honeymoon, Brennan announced that he was not attracted to Emily. He has not given a reason why, but the pair are working on Brennan&#39;s romantic feelings for Emily. Brennan doesn&#39;t believe in divorce, and Emily has never been in a relationship.




Becca and Austin have had obvious chemistry since the moment they met. They had fun during the honeymoon and share the same weird sense of humor. However, they have been avoiding big topics that could divide them. They already found out they have different religious views, but there are more issues to come. Becca also wants to have sex and Austin wants to go at a slower pace. While there are glaring red flags in both of the two outlined relationships, Cameron and Clare&#39;s dynamic is the most unhealthy.



 Cameron Has Called Out His And Clare&#39;s Dynamic As Unhealthy 
         

Clare and Cameron were initially attracted to each other, but their honeymoon night was awkward, and that&#39;s how things continued on. They could not find the &#34;spark&#34; between them, and Clare had a hard time reciprocating Cameron&#39;s affectionate gestures. Cameron thought Clare was putting off standoffish vibes, and that pushed him away. Now that they are living together, things have gotten worse in that regard, and Clare is not ready to move forward with any intimacy. Moreover, Clare&#39;s faith is important to her, and she wants to raise kids with religion, while Cameron does not.




Cameron has called their current dynamic &#34;unhealthy,&#34; and during the mid-season trailer, he said his feelings about the relationship were unsustainable. Last episode, Cameron and Clare showed up to their therapy appointment without their rings, ready to call it quits. After talking with Dr. Pia, they agreed to focus on quality time and having fun in their marriage to try and get on track, but it&#39;s clear that this Married at First Sight couple is doomed by their incompatibilities.



Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST.
