  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Letterkenny is a great example of truly Canadian humor, which is made even more evident in some of the series&rsquo; funniest quotes.</p>
<p>While fans had to bid farewell to the cult Canadian series in 2023, the funniest Letterkenny quotes will continue to live on. Set in the titular town in Ontario, Canada, Letterkenny follows Wayne (Jared Keeso), a country boy, and the various colorful characters in his community. Endlessly quotable, Letterkenny found its audiences with a quick pace and the rapid-fire delivery of its talented cast. The show delivers insults faster and more brutal than just about any other, meaning that there are plenty of hilarious Letterkenny quotes from the show that highlight its unique writing style.
The small Canadian show came from humble beginnings and proved to be a surprise hit, finding an international audience on Hulu. Letterkenny came to an end after season 12 while never letting up on its penchant for endless one-liners, unique sayings, and sharp verbal takedowns. The funniest quotes from the show highlight the different personalities that exist in this small town which made it such a fun place to return to again and again. Luckily, they are the kind of quotes that remain hilarious no matter how many times fans choose to revisit the series.

<p>10 Things Fans Didn&rsquo;t Know About Letterkenny
Though the Canadian sitcom is beloved by fans, there are still a few things about Letterkenny that even the most avid viewers don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>20  &ldquo;The Stupidest Thing I Ever Heard In My Life Is That A Baby Is Smart.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>While Wayne and the other Letterkenny characters are often busy with &ldquo;chorin&rsquo;&rdquo; they certainly still make time for a lot of immature conversations. They often get worked up and dive into silly topics, but Wayne&rsquo;s strong feelings about intelligent babies is particularly memorable. Wayne remarks on how stupid he thinks the idea of a smart baby could be. He supports his argument with well-thought-out examples and acted-out scenarios. These examples are hilarious, but even without them this Letterkenny quote is funny simply because he takes such an issue with someone complimenting an infant.</p>
<p>19  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s When You Leave But You Only Say Goodbye To The Cat.&rdquo;
Katy</p>
<p>The community of Letterkenny often knows how to come together for a good time. However, there are still situations where Wayne and the others would rather have a quick exit plan. Such is the case when they are invited to a hot tub party at the McMurrays&rsquo; and quickly become uncomfortable. This leads to Wayne, Katy, and Daryl debating what type of exit they should make. Starting with the &ldquo;Irish Goodbye&rdquo; which is simply leaving without telling anyone, they go through many options with the &ldquo;Tokyo Sayonara&rdquo; being the funniest and clearly the one for cat lovers.</p>
<p>18  &ldquo;Nobody Speaks Celine Dion&rsquo;s Name In A Hostile Tone.&rdquo;
Jean-Carl</p>
<p>Letterkenny is a great international comedy series that shows the many sides of Canada. There are occasionally some clashes of cultures in the show, despite the Canadian reputation for being friendly and welcoming. This is particularly the case when Wayne and the Letterkenny boys come upon some doppelgängers from Quebec. They quickly take umbrage at having to camp next to the francophones. While the language barrier prevents the Quebecers from understanding them, they still take offense to how Celine Dion&rsquo;s name was used in a hostile way.</p>
<p>17  &ldquo;You Are F***Ing Up Bud.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>As great of friends as Wayne and Daryl find themselves disagreeing on matters. Once again, the subjects of these disagreements are often hard to take seriously. For instance one of the best Letterkenny episodes features a disagreement about how to properly cook a steak, the pals quickly butt heads. It is hilarious how seriously each man takes his own approach and how certain they are that theirs is the only true method. When Daryl suggests cooking it without salt and pepper Wayne doesn&rsquo;t hold back his disappointment.</p>
<p>10 Things That Make No Sense About Letterkenny
Letterkenny is a hilarious look at life in a small Canadian town, but there are some things about the show that don&rsquo;t make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>16  &ldquo;Well, It&rsquo;s A Terrific Opportunity.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>Stuart is not a favorite member of the community in Wayne&rsquo;s eyes, which makes it all the funnier when he finds himself in an awkward situation with the &ldquo;degen.&rdquo; While picking stones in the field, Wayne unburdens himself to his friends that he caught a glimpse of Stuart when he was naked. Almost immediately, his friends ask for an assessment and Wayne has to admit he was impressed. Despite the dislike he has for Stuart, Wayne&rsquo;s happiness for him is hilarious, as if he is describing someone getting a promotion at work.</p>
<p>15  &ldquo;Pitter-Patter.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>While there are a number of seemingly common yet previously little-known Letterkenny slang phrases that are introduced by the main characters, there are also some classic lines that they&rsquo;ve made their own over the years. They have become some of the best running jokes in Letterkenny. &ldquo;Pitter-patter, let&rsquo;s get at &rsquo;er&rdquo; is Wayne and his crew&rsquo;s all-too-perfect way to say that there&rsquo;s no time to waste when a job comes up, and it&rsquo;s heard frequently across the series when their plans ultimately come together.</p>
<p>14  &ldquo;Your Sister’s Hot, Wayne! There I Said It! I Said It! I Regret Nothing! I Regret Nothing!&rdquo;
Squirrely Dan</p>
<p>Letterkenny&rsquo;s Squirrely Dan is a friend of Wayne and Daryl&rsquo;s who also has a crush on Wayne&rsquo;s sister Katy, though he is frequently warned away from acting or commenting on it by Wayne, who is the toughest guy in Letterkenny. However, Squirrely Dan decided to air his thoughts on Katy to Wayne once, but he quickly (for him) took off across a field to smartly avoid Wayne after the revealing comments. Katy herself usually playfully reciprocates Squirrely Dan&rsquo;s subtle flirtations, though she often calls him out for his gross behavior as well.</p>
<p>13  &ldquo;Vomit On Your Mom’s Spaghetti, Or Whatever That Talking Singer Says.&rdquo;
Coach</p>
<p>While Letterkenny is often focused on the &ldquo;hicks&rdquo; and the &ldquo;skids&rdquo; that populate the town, the series also focuses on hockey players to drive home the sport&rsquo;s importance in some Canadian communities. The unnamed Coach of the teams that Reilly and Jonesy play for has a particular way with words, which he is usually screaming at the top of his lungs while kicking a garbage can. He also occasionally tries to work in popular songs and sayings, like when he tried to work lyrics from Eminem&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lose Yourself&rdquo; into a pep talk for his team.</p>
<p>Letterkenny: The Main Characters, Ranked By Intelligence
The real brilliance of the Letterkenny comes from the different personalities of the main and side characters. Here&rsquo;s how they compare in smarts.</p>
<p>12  &ldquo;Jonesy, Your Life Is So Pathetic I Get A Charity Tax Break Just By Hanging Around You!&rdquo;
Shoresy</p>
<p>While Jonesy and Reilly can dish out insults to hicks, skids, and hockey players alike, they met their match when they first encountered Shoresy on the older hockey team, who is also played by Jared Keeso despite his face never being shown. During a vocal faceoff between Shoresy and Jonesy, the younger hockey player was put in his place by Shoresy who managed to tear down his life with a few quick words that highlighted the quick-witted insults the show became known for over the years.</p>
<p>11  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d Say Give Yer B***s A Tug, But It Looks Like Your Pants Are Doing That For You.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>Wayne is a pretty old-fashioned kind of country boy. He prides himself on being a tough and hard-working kind of person and won&rsquo;t put up with people who are anything less. He is quick to call out anyone he perceives as weaker than him. One of his favorite insults is to tell people &ldquo;give yer b***s a tug&rdquo; but when he sees Stewart standing in front of him wearing a pair of skinny jeans, Wayne is forced to change the insult slightly.</p>
<p>10  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re F****** Ten-Ply, Bud.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>The show is filled with inventive and hilarious insults that are thrown around by the characters, going back to Letterkenny&rsquo;s beginnings on YouTube. However, sometimes a war of words isn&rsquo;t enough which inevitably leads to some of the most epic Letterkenny fights. When Wayne gets challenged to a fight by someone who thinks he is the new toughest guy in town, Wayne doesn&rsquo;t back down. He makes short work of the man before calling him &ldquo;ten-ply.&rdquo; Getting compared to the softest tissue imaginable has to sting.</p>
<p>9  &ldquo;If You Gotta Problem With Canada Gooses, You Gotta Problem With Me And I Suggest You Let That One Marinate.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>Wayne and his friends have a lot of principles they are willing to stand up for and, of course, fight for. However, nothing seems to get them as worked up as when someone threatens a Canadian symbol as important as the Canada Goose. When the gang hears that the golf course is looking for ways of getting rid of the geese in the area, everyone takes dramatic offense to the idea. Wayne gets particularly defensive in standing up for them, adding the hilarious &ldquo;and I suggest you let that one marinate&rdquo; to each threat.</p>
<p>Why Letterkenny Never Showed Shoresy&rsquo;s Face
Throughout Letterkenny, Shoresy&rsquo;s face remained a complete mystery. Here&rsquo;s why the character was never fully revealed throughout the show.</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;I See The Muscle Shirt Came Today. Muscles Coming Tomorrow?&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>If there is one character in Letterkenny, who seems like the polar opposite of Wayne, it is the skinny young goth named Stewart. Whenever these two come face-to-face, Stewart tries to stand up to Wayne but then proceeds to be torn apart by insults. After Stewart calls Wayne and his friends &ldquo;shirt-tuckers&rdquo;, they calmly and relentlessly let him have it. The best insult is when Wayne simultaneously makes fun of Stewart&rsquo;s outfit and scrawny appearance.</p>
<p>7  &ldquo;Wish You Weren&rsquo;t So F****** Awkward Bud.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>Wayne and Daryl are best buddies who seem to spend all of their time together in Letterkenny. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean they always see eye-to-eye. Wayne is a very serious kind of guy while Daryl can sometimes embrace his childish side more often. As the friends are hanging out by the produce stand as they always do, Daryl spots a four-leaf clover. Excitedly, he tells the others to make a wish. Without even looking at him, Wayne just laments his buddy&rsquo;s awkwardness.</p>
<p>6  &ldquo;I Could Watch Kids Fall Off Bikes All Day.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>The show is quite impressive with how they use language in their comedy, but as sharp and witty as the writing is at times, they are also not above going for the most juvenile humor possible. One episode is dedicated solely to how hilarious farting is. Even Wayne, the toughest guy in Letterkenny, admits there are few things in life as funny as farting — except kids falling off of bikes. He admits he could watch that kind of stuff all day before adding &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give s*** about your kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;Figure It Out.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>Fans are unlikely to find any show that is more proudly Canadian than Letterkenny. The show goes out of its way to highlight the many things that make the Great White North such a special place to live and why the characters think it is superior to any other place on Earth. In one scene, the characters begin pointing out all of the great Canadian things Americans don&rsquo;t have. The idea that Americans don&rsquo;t have malt vinegar as a table condiment or sell ketchup chips just leaves them disappointed. They just shake their heads and say &ldquo;Figure it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Letterkenny: The Main Characters, Ranked By Likability
Canadian sitcom Letterkenny has seen a spike in popularity. Fans either love the citizens of this titular small Ontario town&hellip; or love to hate them.</p>
<p>4  &ldquo;Your Mom Just Liked My Instagram Post From Two Years Ago In Puerta Vallarta.&rdquo;
Shoresy</p>
<p>The entire show is mostly a setup for the characters to roast one another with insults or &ldquo;chirps&rdquo;, and no one is a more vicious chirper than Shoresy. The vulgar hockey player, whose face is never revealed, takes particular pleasure in chirping Reilly and Jonesy about their mothers. His insults are so outlandish and ridiculous, yet extremely biting. He really hits a nerve when he insinuates their mother has been taking an interest in his Instagram posts. It&rsquo;s not surprising that Shoresy got his own spinoff show.</p>
<p>3  &ldquo;Call Me A Cake, ‘Cause I’ll Go Straight To Your A**, Cowboy!&rdquo;
Gail</p>
<p>Lisa Codrington plays Gail, the original bartender of Letterkenny&rsquo;s local bar, Modeans, who has a crush on Wayne and a possibly unhealthy addiction to sex that results in a number of hilarious but also uncomfortable quotes that can be shocking to hear. One of her milder but still hilarious quotes was one of her many attempts to entice Wayne into a sexual relationship with her by comparing herself to a fattening piece of cake. Sadly for Gail, Wayne never succumbed to Gail&rsquo;s incredibly subtle advances.</p>
<p>2  &ldquo;Sing Us A Song Or Something. Do A Trick. You&rsquo;re F****** Useless.&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>The insults in the show come so fast and furious that the target of them barely has time to react before they are hit with another one. Wayne is particularly skilled at this kind of rapid-fire barrage of insults that make for some of the funniest moments in the show. As the hockey players come to visit the produce stand, Wayne unleashes on them. He degrades them and humiliates them before totally dismissing them as useless and all they can do is just stand there stunned.</p>
<p>1  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Like Algebra. Why You Gotta Put Numbers And Letters Together? Why Can&rsquo;t You Just Go F*** Yourself?&rdquo;
Wayne</p>
<p>Wayne likes to keep things as simple as possible in every avenue of his life. He also has very little patience for people who do try to complicate things. This can make him a bit harsh with his opinions at times on Letterkenny. When Wayne and his friends develop a social networking platform for farts, the idea catches on quickly and everyone wants to give their input. When the goth kids try to add their opinion, Wayne says they are over-complicating things and offers his own insulting solution.</p>
