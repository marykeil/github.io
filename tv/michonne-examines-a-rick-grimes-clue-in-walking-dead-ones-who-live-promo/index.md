## Literature Review
Michonne examines a mysterious clue to the whereabouts of Rick Grimes in a new promo for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live spinoff series.




A new promotional trailer for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has revealed Michonne examining a clue as to where Rick Grimes went after he disappeared. The upcoming spinoff will explain what happened to Rick after he was captured by the CRM, as well as his wife&#39;s mission to find him. It will feature the return of both major characters from the franchise, both of whom departed before the final season.




Now, The Walking Dead has unveiled a new promo ahead of The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live&#39;s release, showing Michonne looking at the mysterious cellphone carving she found in the flagship series.


 

The phone depicts a carving of both her and Judith, alongside Rick&#39;s name and Japanese text. The emphasis on the phone indicates it will be an important clue for her discovering what happened to the franchise&#39;s lead survivor.


 What Does Rick&#39;s Mysterious Phone Carving Mean? 
          

The phone carving was first found by Michonne on an abandoned military boat, signaling to her that Rick was still alive. This is what motivates her to go looking for him, experiencing her own journey during her quest to rescue him. Not only does it imply he&#39;s alive, but also that he or someone he knows managed to find her and Judith, carving their likenesses into the phone.




While it&#39;s unclear who made the phone carving, the Japanese text on the side indicates it may have been a new character. This means someone else within the CRM may be trying to escape, and whoever it is could be acting as an ally to bring about Rick and Michonne&#39;s emotional reunion. The new friend could be anyone the series is set to introduce, such as Lesley-Ann Brandt&#39;s Pearl Thorne. However, it won&#39;t be clear who it is until the show airs.

                        Rick Grimes&#39; Walking Dead Spinoff Sets Up The Return Of A Season 1 Villain   With Rick Grimes finally set to return to The Walking Dead, his spinoff presents the chance to bring back one of the show&#39;s earliest villains.    

If Rick does have an ally on the inside, then it would explain how he was able to briefly escape the CRM as depicted in The Walking Dead series finale. It could also make Michonne&#39;s rescue even easier if she meets this character, the duo deciding how to approach their attempt to bring him home. With the phone just one of many mysteries The Ones Who Live will need to explore, it appears this series will have a plethora of ideas to contend with.






The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live premieres on AMC and AMC&#43; on February 25, 2024.
