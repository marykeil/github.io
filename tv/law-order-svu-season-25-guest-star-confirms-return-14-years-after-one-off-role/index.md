# Law &amp; Order SVU Season 25 Guest Star Confirms Return 14 Years After One-Off Role


## SUMMARY 



  Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 brings back a familiar face from 14 years ago, ensuring a great milestone year.   David Krumholtz announces his return to SVU season 25 on Instagram, posing with series veteran Ice-T.   It&#39;s unclear if Krumholtz will play the same character, but if he gets a different role, it could be a regular stint as part of Benson&#39;s team to address cast departures.

## Literature Review
A one-time Law &amp; Order: SVU actor is coming back in its milestone year, and his return is bringing back a lot of Elliot Stabler memories. 




Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 is bringing back a familiar face that was on the show 14 years ago. Despite the expected casting reshuffles, the Wolf Entertainment and NBC police procedural are pulling all the stops to ensure a great milestone year. The Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 premiere will already bring back Kelli Giddish&#39;s Amanda Rollins, but beyond that, it&#39;s also recruiting another actor from the series&#39; past.




David Krumholtz has announced that he will be in Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 with a post on Instagram.


 

The image shows him posing with series veteran, Ice-T, although the snap doesn&#39;t reveal any additional information about Krumholtz&#39;s upcoming role. It&#39;s worth noting that he previously appeared in Law &amp; Order: SVU season 12, during Christopher Meloni&#39;s final year as Elliot Stabler before he returned for Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime.


 David Krumholtz&#39;s Law &amp; Order: SVU Season 12 Role Explained 


In October 2010, Krumholtz debuted as Dr. Vincent Prochik in Law &amp; Order: SVU season 12, episode 5, &#34;Wet.&#34; The outing had Benson and Stabler deal with the death of a young woman found in a fountain outside a park. She was supposedly raped, but also had a chunk of hair missing on her head. Vincent tried taking the blame for his girlfriend&#39;s crime. In the end, they still patched things up.




                  Why ADA Barba Really Left Law &amp; Order: SVU   Arguably the best ADA that the Manhattan SVU has had thus far, it&#39;s curious why Rafael Barba left Law &amp; Order: SVU after just six seasons.     

14 years since his debut performance, it&#39;s unclear if Krumholtz will play the same character in his procedural return. His case was one of the last ones that Stabler worked on as part of the Manhattan SVO before Meloni left Law &amp; Order: SVU. Considering Stabler being reinstated in the Manhattan PD, it&#39;s curious if there&#39;s a chance for them to reunite â€” assuming that Krumholtz will play the same role he did in 14 years.

If Krumholtz gets a different role in his Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 return, it may not be for a one-off role. Instead, it could be as a regular stint, being the newest member of Benson&#39;s team. Considering its recent cast departures, Manhattan SVU will be severely undermanned. Recruiting a more veteran team member could be the best way to address its issues.
