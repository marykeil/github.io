## Literature Review
The winter 2024 season of anime has arrived, and here&#39;s the finalized Crunchyroll lineup, promising another great season of anime entertainment.




With the fall 2023 season of anime is coming to a close, Crunchyroll announced their lineup of anime for winter 2024. Between old favorites like Jujutsu Kaisen and Dr. Stone returning to much fanfare alongside brand new hits like Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End and Shangri-La Frontier, it’s clear that many of the biggest anime of fall 2023, as is often the case, ended up being ones that were licensed by Crunchyroll.




Crunchyroll had a great lineup of anime for the fall 2023 season, and the winter 2024 season is looking to be no different in that regard. As always, there are plenty of older anime either continuing their runs from the past season or returning after a momentary absence, but more importantly, there’s a bevy of new anime with a variety of talent attached to them that are all sure to have a lot to offer viewers.

          

All in all, Crunchyroll will have a lot of anime to watch in the winter 2024 season, and that’s a great way for the streaming service to start things off in 2024.

The following series will also continue airing from the fall season: 

  Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End (Madhouse) – New episodes on Fridays   The Apothecary Diaries (TOHO animation STUDIO and OLM) – New episodes on Saturdays   Firefighter Daigo: Rescuer in Orange (Brain’s Base) – New episodes on Saturdays   Case  d (Detective Conan) (TMS Entertainment) – New episodes on Saturdays   Soaring Sky! Precure (Toei Animation) – New episodes on Saturdays   Shangri-La Frontier (C2C) – New episodes on Sundays   Captain Tsubasa Season 2: Junior Youth Arc (Studio KAI) – New episodes on Sundays  

In addition to highly anticipated sequels like High Card season 2 and One Piece’s Egghead Island arc, Crunchyroll’s winter 2024 lineup consists largely of fantasy and isekai anime. For isekai anime, The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic looks to be a fun and lighthearted take on the genre, as does Fluffy Paradise, which is also Crunchyroll’s first new anime of the year. Anime like 7th Time Loop and Villainess Level 99 also appear to offer unique spins on the villainess subgenre of isekai anime, so they’re sure to be great to watch.




For fantasy anime, Meiji Gekken: 1874 is the last of the “Crunchyroll Originals”, and while the label has been met with mixed results, the historical fiction story it’s setting out to tell appears to be an interesting one that’s sure to grab people’s attention. Not only that, but winter 2024 is the long-awaited debut of Solo Leveling&#39;s anime adaptation, and if the anime can live up to the source material, it has the chance to be the biggest anime of the season. Fantasy and isekai have long since become mainstays of seasonal anime, and Crunchyroll appears to have a lot of great titles in both fields for winter 2024.



 Crunchyroll’s Original Anime Lineup Makes For A Great Winter 2024 Season 

 

 Fantasy and isekai anime aside, there are plenty of anime with more varied stories to watch on Crunchyroll in Winter 2024. A Sign of Affection being a romance story with a deaf protagonist gives it a unique premise that’s sure to draw a lot of attention, and Metallic Rouge’s stellar animation and direction look to be setting it up as a perfect means for Bones to celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2024. These anime and others help make Crunchyroll the biggest anime streaming service to keep an eye on for winter 2024, and it’ll be great to see how many live up to their hype.




             Crunchyroll Crunchyroll is a North American-based streaming service owned by Sony that focuses largely on Japanese anime but also covers several East Asian drama series. The service is available in several countries and has a small catalog of self-created and published series, with most of its content licensed with partners overseas.
