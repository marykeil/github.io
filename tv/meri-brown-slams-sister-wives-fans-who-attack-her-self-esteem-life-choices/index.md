## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Meri Brown is coming for fans who criticize her self-esteem and the choices she&#39;s made in her life after separating from Kody Brown.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown shared that she&#39;s aware of the criticism surrounding her self-esteem, but she&#39;s happily rejecting the idea that choosing to fight for her marriage with Kody Brown was anything other than a display of her strength. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Meri has been working through some of the issues she&#39;s faced with Kody, who&#39;s been open about the fact that he doesn&#39;t want to continue their relationship. While Kody hasn&#39;t directly said he wants to split up, he&#39;s been straightforward with Meri about his thoughts surrounding their marriage. In a recent episode of Sister Wives, Kody even told Meri he felt their relationship was fake.




Meri has been exploring the idea of ending her relationship with Kody and, in Sister Wives season 18, episode 12, began the process of reflecting on her marriage outwardly as something in the past. In an interview with People, Meri shared that &#34;there’s a lot of misconceptions about me, personally, because people are always telling me, ‘You don’t know what you’re worth. You have no value,&#39;&#34; While Meri has been torn down by fans in the past, she&#39;s not letting the criticism get to her. &#34;I know what I’m worth, and I know what my value is,&#34; she shared.

Though she&#39;s taken a stand in speaking out about her marriage to Kody and the way it ended, Meri has always been the quickest to bend to Kody&#39;s will. She shared that even though many have slammed her lack of confidence, she&#39;s made the right choices for herself, which make her feel more confident in her decisions. &#34;I 100% gave it my all,&#34; Meri shared. &#34;I did everything in my power that I could do. And if I would’ve walked away any sooner, there would’ve always been a question in my mind.&#34; While Meri is confident in her choices, she&#39;s still having a hard time on her own outside of the family.





 

As Kody&#39;s first and original wife, Meri has always had a difficult time separating herself from the rest of the Brown family. While she runs her business, Lizzie&#39;s Heritage Inn, independently of the Brown family, she&#39;s always been one of the most vocal advocates for their plural family and has made it clear that she would have stayed in her marriage if it were possible. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Meri has proven that she wasn&#39;t really paying attention to her marriage with Kody, as the cracks in the relationship weren&#39;t as apparent to her as they were to the rest of the family or her fans.

Meri may have been fighting for her marriage with Kody, but she wasn&#39;t seeing the bigger picture on Sister Wives or in her own life. While it has been obvious for years that Kody wasn&#39;t interested in his relationship with Meri anymore, the shock of everything taking a turn was huge for Meri. After trying to keep her relationship stable for too long, Meri made the choice to separate from Kody. Thankfully, it seems that even though Sister Wives fans aren&#39;t being as supportive as they could be, Meri has enough confidence in herself not to need outside help.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
