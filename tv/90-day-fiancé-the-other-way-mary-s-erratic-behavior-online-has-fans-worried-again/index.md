## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Brandan Denuccio and Mary Demasu-ay could have split for good if Mary&#39;s cryptic IG posts are any indication.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Mary Demasu-ay is getting married to Brandan DeNuccio on season 5, but in real life, several clues suggest they&#39;ve split. Mary is a 23-year-old dance enthusiast from the Philippines. She was fascinated by Harry Potter and Justin Bieber, so she was quick to swipe right when she saw Brandan on a dating app. Mary, however, had a troubled past. Mary&#39;s ex-boyfriend cheated on her multiple times. She didn&#39;t want Brandan to do the same, so she made sure he was with her on a video call 24/7 for two years of their long-distance relationship. Mary&#39;s controlling nature didn&#39;t change when he moved to the Philippines.




Now that the spin-off is showing Mary and Brandan&#39;s wedding in season 5, Mary&#39;s Instagram stories are getting more and more disturbing. Reddit user u/Weezy-Jefferson has been keeping track of Mary&#39;s IG updates.


 

Her latest story is a repost that says &#34;Not everything is worth fixing.&#34; The post also advised that one should never give &#34;too many chances&#34; to a person who has accessed and abused them by taking them for granted. It added, &#34;There are better people out there&#34; who could cherish them. Mary could have related to the post because not too long ago, she had posted stories where she wished she&#39;d found someone better because Brandan was &#34;no good.&#34;

 Mary &amp; Brandan Might Be Going Through Relationship Troubles 
          

Mary had told Brandan through her stories that he should go and find someone better because they both did not deserve each other. Soon enough, Mary deleted all photos featuring Brandan from her Instagram. She even took down pictures that showed him caressing her belly while embracing her from when he was pregnant. Moreover, Mary did an Instagram Live where she was seen arguing with Brandan. The problems in Brandan and Mary&#39;s relationship began when Mary told him she was having a baby. Brandan may have eventually thought of returning to the U.S. but a baby meant he would have to marry her as soon as possible.

Brandan started distracting himself from Mary by sleeping till late in the afternoon and playing video games on his phone. He refused to help Mary make money. He didn&#39;t help her out when she managed their new store. In fact, Brandan lashed out at Mary for being poor with financial decisions. Mary complained about the same to Brandan&#39;s mother, Angela, on the day before their wedding. She married him regardless and now appears to be regretting it. Mary seemingly changed her Facebook account relationship status from being married to being in a relationship.




Brandan and Mary got married sometime in April 2023. They are rumored to have given birth to their first baby in a couple of months. Mary seems adamant about wanting to end her marriage with Brandan now. However, he has been posting their photos on Instagram, perhaps to avoid any spoilers ahead of the show&#39;s finale. If Brandan and Mary have indeed split, the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell-All might solve the mystery to provide fans with some satisfaction.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
