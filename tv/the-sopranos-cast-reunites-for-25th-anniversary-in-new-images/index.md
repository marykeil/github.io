## Literature Review
A compilation of photos shows The Sopranos cast reuniting to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the HBO show with a family dinner in Little Italy.




The Sopranos cast reunites for the 25th anniversary in new photos. Premiered in 1999, the acclaimed HBO series follows the angst-ridden New Jersey mob boss, Tony Soprano, as he balances his work and family life, with the cast led by the late James Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperiloi, Steven Van Zandt, Robert Iler, Tony Sirico, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, and Lorraine Bracco. The Sopranos is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential TV shows of all time and is commonly credited with kick-starting the current Golden Age of Television.




Now, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series premiere, The Sopranos cast reunited for a &#34;family dinner&#34; at the Da Nico restaurant in Little Italy, captured by Marion Curtis for GQ. Check out the collection of photos below:

         

Other than the photo of the entire cast, the photos single out Steve Buscemi, who starred in season 5 as Tony Blundetto, as well as series creator David Chase and Steve Schirripa (Bobby Bacala). Also pictured together are Lorraine Bracco (Dr. Melfi), Vincent Pastore (Big Pussy), and Kathrine Narducci (Charmaine Bucco). James Gandolfini&#39;s son Michael, who played young Tony in the prequel movie The Many Saints of Newark, was also present. The creator and cast members, such as Aida Turturro (Janice Soprano) and Federico Castelluccio (Furio), also shared comments reminiscing on the series:





Chase: [It means] everything to see everybody together again, you know, probably for the last time. Who knows? Time. Time marches on.
Turturro: I talk to James. I believe in that stuff, and it&#39;s more like in my heart, I know he&#39;s with me, like I talk to my mom and dad, and you know what? I&#39;m like, Get me a f***ing job, James.
Michael Gandolfini: I really do remember the Soprano house when I watch it, I remember sleeping in the Soprano bed when I&#39;d take naps.
Castelluccio: We would work 14, 16, 18, hours a day and then at the end of the night we would actually say, &#34;Hey, do you want to go grab a drink?&#34; You know, usually you get tired of people&#39;s faces.
Schrippia: That&#39;s the difference between The Sopranos show and other shows. We really eat.

The cast&#39;s family dinner isn&#39;t the only celebration of The Sopranos&#39; 25th anniversary, as fans can also join in on the festivities. On the streaming service Max, the show&#39;s landing page was updated with over five hours of behind-the-scenes content, including interviews with the cast and several never-before-seen deleted scenes. To kick off the 25th-anniversary celebration, HBO executive Zach Enterlin shared the following statement.





The Sopranos left an indelible imprint on the global entertainment culture and was instrumental in defining HBO as the destination for groundbreaking, award-winning programming. The many ways we will honor this 25-year milestone will allow fans to celebrate the Soprano legacy and pay tribute to the characters that have had such an enduring impact.








There are also a few upcoming events in addition to the new content on Max. At Da Nico in New York, where The Sopranos cast reunited to celebrate the 25th anniversary, the restaurant will be offering an authentic Sopranos-themed dinner from January 11 to February 4, with the menu including Carmela&#39;s baked ziti and Satrialeâ€™s special caprese. HBO is also partnering with Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler (who played Meadow and A.J. Soprano and currently host Not Today, Pal) for a special 25th-anniversary podcast.



The Sopranos seasons 1-6 are streaming on Max.
