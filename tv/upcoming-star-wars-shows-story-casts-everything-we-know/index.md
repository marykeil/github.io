## Literature Review
Several exciting Star Wars TV shows are set to be released on Disney&#43; in the coming years from the realm of both live-action and animation.




More Star Wars TV shows are on the horizon now than ever before. Disney has evolved Star Wars into a trailblazing transmedia franchise of interconnected books, comics, video games, and a stunning range of Disney&#43; TV shows. The Mandalorian was essentially the flagship Disney&#43; program, released as a launch title for the streaming service in 2019.
The TV shows are set at different points in the Star Wars timeline. The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka are spin-offs of The Mandalorian, set roughly five years after Return of the Jedi. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Andor both take place during the Dark Times of the Galactic Empire - as does the animated series Star Wars: The Bad Batch, a spin-off of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Now, even more Star Wars TV shows are on the way, along with new seasons of existing installments in Disney&#39;s TV library.
            
 
 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.













 








 6  Star Wars: Skeleton Crew 
The latest addition to the New Republic era of Star Wars TV shows will be the Jude Law-led series.
        

The next Star Wars TV show set during The Mandalorian era is Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, a show that promises to be one of the most unusual to date. Created by Jon Watts and Christopher Ford, Skeleton Crew is an Amblin Entertainment-style story that follows four kids who get lost in the galaxy far from home. The coming-of-age tale also includes Jude Law&#39;s unnamed Force-user character, generally believed to be a Jedi. The release date was initially slated for late 2023, but now Skeleton Crew will be released in 2024. The show will feature eight episodes, possibly tying into Dave Filoni&#39;s The Mandalorian Star Wars movie.

 5  Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 3 
The beloved animated spin-off of The Clone Wars comes to a close in 2024.


 







 The Bad Batch is returning for its final season in 2024, which will see Hunter, Wrecker, and Echo searching for Omega following her abduction by the Empire. With Tech no longer around and Crosshair reunited with Omega, Clone Force 99 must call upon whichever allies they can to bring the rest of their family home. Ming-Na Wen is confirmed to return as Fennec Shand, but other characters have yet to be announced. Season 3 will presumably follow the 16-episode precedent of seasons 1 and 2, while the Imperial base at Wayland is believed to tie in both to the Star Wars sequel trilogy and Filoni&#39;s plans in The Mandalorian era.

 4  Star Wars: The Acolyte 
 Star Wars&#39; High Republic era will be brought to live-action for the first time.
 Taking place 100 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, The Acolyte will see the fall of the Jedi from the perspective of the Sith. Set at the tail end of the High Republic Era, The Acolyte has been described as a mystery thriller with plenty of Star Wars-infused martial artistry on display. Attendees at Star Wars Celebration 2023 were given a first look at a trailer promising more Jedi action than ever, but the trailer has yet to be publicly released. The eight-episode series is currently in post-production after Disney confirmed the series for a 2024 release.

 3  Tales of the Jedi Season 2 
Star Wars&#39; Clone Wars-inspired anthology series will return for a second batch of episodes in 2024.


 







 Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi draws inspiration from stories not told during The Clone Wars, and season 1 was met with a warm reception. While Tales of the Jedi season 1 followed the stories of Jedi such as Count Dooku and Ahsoka Tano, it&#39;s still unknown who will be included in season 2. The second season was announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023, though it was given no exact release date. However, it was confirmed in December 2023 that Tales of the Jedi season 2 will be released in 2024.





 2  Andor Season 2 
The highly anticipated sequel to Andor will now be released in 2025.


 







 After a critically acclaimed first season, Andor season 2 will complete the story of Diego Luna&#39;s Cassian Andor. Creator Tony Gilroy has already explained the structure of Andor season 2, with every three of the 12 total episodes marking a year of Cassian&#39;s life leading up to the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. While Cassian continues to make his name within the Rebellion, so do his adversaries with the Empire, leading up to the climactic events of the beloved Star Wars movie. Andor season 2 was slated for an August 2024 release, yet the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes mean the continuation has been delayed to 2025.

 1  The Mandalorian Season 4 
Production on the latest season of The Mandalorian is yet to get underway, meaning a 2025 release is likely.


 







 As Star Wars&#39; first and longest-running live-action TV show, The Mandalorian season 4 has already been written by Jon Favreau. The story will follow Din Djarin and Grogu as they embark on journeys while helping the New Republic with unauthorized bounty-hunting jobs focused on Imperial remnants. Most other details are unknown and production has not begun on the show yet meaning an early 2025 release for The Mandalorian season 4 seems likely. The Mandalorian season 4 is expected to be eight episodes, and the overarching narrative should lead directly into Filoni&#39;s Mandalorian-era Star Wars movie - heralding the return of the villainous Grand Admiral Thrawn.
