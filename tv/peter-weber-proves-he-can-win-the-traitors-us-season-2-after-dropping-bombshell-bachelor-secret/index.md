## Literature Review
The Traitors US season 2 contestant Peter Weber reveals the most traitorous act he&#39;s ever committed involves his time on The Bachelor season 24.




The Traitors US season 2 contestant Peter Weber revealed that the most traitorous thing he ever did happened when he broke the rules during his Bachelor season. In 2019, Peter, an airline pilot, placed third in The Bachelorette season 15, which starred Hannah Brown. He was later cast as the lead of The Bachelor season 24, which premiered in 2020. During the season finale, he got engaged to Hannah Ann Sluss. However, during the &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special, the couple revealed that they&#39;d ended their engagement. Peter was later linked to Kelley Flanagan, who placed fifth in his season. They dated in 2020, and then again from 2022-2023, but have since broken up.




The Traitors US season 2 contestant Peter recently made a shocking confession about his time on The Bachelor.



I was trying to get as much info as I could on them and found a way to sneak an iPad through to the hotel room to do my own research.




In an interview with EW to promote The Traitors US season 2, Peter said, &#34;You’re only with the women so long, so I was trying to get as much info as I could on them and found a way to sneak an iPad through to the hotel room to do my own research a little bit on off-days and see what people were kind of saying so I could not feel like I was so in the dirt—just trying to level the playing field a little bit.&#34; During The Bachelor, contact with the outside world is forbidden except in special cases, so it&#39;s shocking to hear that Peter was regularly searching the Internet for information about the women.

 Johnny Bananas Feels &#34;No Remorse&#34; Over His Most Traitorous Act 
          

Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio explained that the move that he’s best known for on reality television is &#34;a move that propelled me into reality television super villainy, and that is stealing over a quarter of a million dollars from my partner Sarah [Rice] on The Challenge.&#34; In 2016, Johnny betrayed Sarah during The Challenge: Rivals III finale and took the $275,000 prize for himself. Johnny confessed, &#34;The move was one thing. Yes, that was traitorous in itself, but I think the real traitorous part was the fact that I felt zero remorse for it, and then I sent her a $10 gift card for Applebee&#39;s.&#34;


 




The Traitors requires the contestants who are chosen as the traitors to lie constantly and to betray the faithfuls in order to win the grand prize, even if they&#39;ve developed close relationships with them. The fact that Peter was able to keep such a big secret during his season and not get caught shows that he must be good at hiding things. This will be important for him if he&#39;s chosen as a traitor. If Peter is a faithful, the Bachelor situation proves that he&#39;s willing to do what it takes to find out information, which will be helpful for him to weed out the traitors.

Johnny Bananas was made for The Traitors, based on his ruthless gameplay during The Challenge. He understands that, on reality competition shows, contestants must do whatever it takes to win without worrying about their personal relationships. Sometimes, it&#39;s hard for contestants to separate their personal feelings from the game. The Traitors US season 2 contestants who&#39;ve played Big Brother and Survivor will also have this philosophy. It&#39;ll be intriguing to see how contestants who&#39;ve never before been on competition shows such as The Traitors fare against Johnny Bananas and his fellow The Challenge contestants Trishelle Canatella and CT Tamburello. However, like Peter, they could secretly be the most cunning of them all.




The Traitors US season 2 premieres with the first three episodes on January 12, 2024, on Peacock.
