## Literature Review
The Buccaneers consists of both cheerworthy and frustrating moments of friendship between the Americans and the high-class society in London. 




Season one of The Buccaneers shows the series&#39; friendships at their highest and lowest moments. Set in the 1870s, the series, based on the unfinished novel of the same title by Edith Wharton, follows a group of American girls who travel to London to find husbands. The theme of friendship is important throughout the series, especially for the &#34;Buccaneers.&#34;
The difference in social behavior and expectations is apparent from the first episode. The American girls are continuously looked down upon and made to feel alienated and unworthy. This theme brings many of the characters in the series closer together while tearing others apart.
Warning: Spoilers for season one of The Buccaneers.



 10  Worst: Conchita And Nan Argument 
Season 1, Episode 3, &#34;The Perfect Duchess&#34;
        

Conchita and Nan argue two times in &#34;The Perfect Duchess.&#34; They feel as though the other isn&#39;t there for them or present at the moment. Up until this point, Conchita had struggled to feel accepted by her husband&#39;s family in London and Nan had just been told by her sister, Jinny, that she&#39;s illegitimate and the woman she&#39;s believed to be her mother is not, biologically. It&#39;s frustratingly clear to the audience that better communication is needed. However, despite the girls&#39; need to confide in one another, they are too overwhelmed by their struggles to be able to do so.



 9  Best: Nan And Richard Talking About Conchita 
Season 1, Episode 1, &#34;American Poison&#34;




The first few minutes of the series premiere reveal that Richard is conflicted about following through with his marriage to Conchita. Nan runs into him outside as he arrives at the venue and he tells her he&#39;s worried about Conchita fitting in with the high society of London. This conflict is present throughout the remainder of the series, as Conchita is never able to feel fully accepted by Richard&#39;s family. In this encounter, Nan is a great friend to the couple. She reassures Richard that so long as he loves Conchita, how she fits in within London shouldn&#39;t matter.



 8  Worst: Lizzy Dancing With James 
Season 1, Episode 2, &#34;Women or Wives&#34;
        

Jinny and Lizzy are two of the girls interested in finding a husband while in London. Throughout the first two episodes, it&#39;s clear Jinny has feelings for Richard&#39;s brother, James. However, Lizzy has her eyes set on him as well and dances with him in front of Jinny. Not only was the move inconsiderate to her friendship with Jinny, but following their dance, Lizzy and James would have an interaction that would negatively stick with Lizzy for the rest of the season and cause more contention between the girls.




 7  Best: Jean And Honoria 
Season 1, Episode 5, &#34;Failed Betrayal&#34;




During a conversation between the characters Jean and Honoria, they open up to one another and discuss the struggles of living within high society London. They reflect on the way things have changed since the American girls&#39; arrival. They were raised to make themselves small, but now many of the men they wish to marry prefer women who are loud and who challenge them, rather than those who are quiet and submissive. It&#39;s a small moment, but one of vulnerability that provides more depth to the two characters, since much of London&#39;s high-class society has been dismissive and unfriendly up until this point.

 6  Worst: Jinny Doesn&#39;t Defend Conchita 
Season 1, Episode 3, &#34;The Perfect Duchess&#34;
        

&#34;The Perfect Duchess&#34; sees the newly married Jinny and James who make it their priority to achieve his parents&#39; expectations. Conchita notices how quickly Richard and James&#39; parents accept Jinny, despite their continued aim to make her feel unwelcome. She confronts them, asking what differentiates her from Jinny, but as she&#39;s doing so, Jinny says nothing. The tension is not only felt by the audience, but within the scene itself, therefore Jinny&#39;s silence is disappointing. Before London, the American girls reminded one another that their friendship comes before anything or anyone else. Jinny&#39;s inability to defend Conchita is the first of many times she&#39;ll end up betraying her friends.



 5  Best: Lizzy And Guy Hiding Away 
Season 1, Episode 5, &#34;Failed Betrayal&#34;
        

Lizzy and Guy step away from the rest of the group and hide away for a bit. It&#39;s during this moment that Lizzy opens up for the first time about what transpired between her and James. Though she doesn&#39;t give many details, and completely denies it has anything to do with a man in London, it&#39;s the first time she&#39;s talked about how that experience made her feel. Through their conversation, Guy reassures Lizzy that the only one who should feel ashamed is the guy she&#39;s talking about. The words of encouragement give Lizzy the courage and confidence to not only reconnect with Jinny but appear unafraid of James.



 4  Worst: Jinny Ignoring Lizzy&#39;s Truth About James 
Season 1, Episode 6, &#34;It&#39;s Christmas&#34;
        

Jinny speaks with Lizzy as she&#39;s aware something must have happened between Lizzy and James to make her distant. Lizzy tells Jinny that after dancing with him in &#34;Women or Wives,&#34; James took her upstairs and made her undress and lie down. Though James didn&#39;t hurt Lizzy, she felt humiliated as she lay in the same spot for hours, awaiting his return and fearful he might hurt her if she left. Jinny&#39;s response is heartbreaking when she denies her husband did anything wrong and insinuates Lizzy is only upset because she embarrassed herself. This is the start of James getting Jinny under his control, a key component moving forward.



 3  Best: Mabel Confiding In Lizzy 
Season 1, Episode 8, &#34;Wedding of the Season&#34;
        

The romance between the American girls and the men in London isn&#39;t the only love story in season one. Mabel, Lizzy&#39;s sister, has had romantic interactions with two women in previous episodes. During an instance when Mabel was kissing a woman in the bathroom, her mom walked in. This compelled Mabel to open up and come out to her sister, despite her worries surrounding what she might think. It&#39;s a touching moment between the two when Lizzy tells her sister that she must try to let go of any shame she might be feeling, calling back to her conversation with Guy in &#34;Failed Betrayal.&#34;



 2  Worst: Guy Confessing His Feelings For Nan 
Season 1, Episode 4, &#34;Homecoming&#34;




During a drunken fit, Guy confesses his feelings for Nan and sends her a telegram while she&#39;s back in New York before marrying Theo. However, before Nan can read the note herself, Theo reads it and keeps the information to himself. Guy&#39;s confessed feelings for Nan cause a few issues.
It creates a rift between him and Theo, who were close friends before, and once Nan learns how Guy feels, it causes her to feel upset and lied to by both men. In the season finale, Nan tells Guy she shares the same feelings, complicating things when she goes through with marrying Theo. It&#39;s a complication that&#39;s bound to be a main storyline in season two of The Buccaneers.



 1  Best: The Girls Help Jinny Escape 
Season 1, Episode 8, &#34;Wedding of the Season&#34;
        

Despite their contention, once Nan learns of James&#39; treatment of Jinny, she does all she can to help her escape. Before walking down the aisle to marry Theo, Nan and the girls come together for Jinny, putting all the conflict between them aside, and reminding each other once more that their friendship is what&#39;s most important. &#34;Wedding of the Season&#34; is the season finale, and it ends on a cliffhanger. After each bridesmaid walks in, James realizes Jinny has left, and it&#39;s equally troubling and intriguing to imagine what this will lead to in the next season.
