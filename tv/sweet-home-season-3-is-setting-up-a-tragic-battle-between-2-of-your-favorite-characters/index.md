## Literature Review

Sweet Home season 2’s finale sets up a battle between two of the show’s most popular characters, and season 3 could be the K-drama’s saddest yet.




Sweet Home season 3 could be even more heartbreaking than season 2, including by potentially featuring a tragic fight between two of the show’s most popular characters. The Sweet Home cast has grown bigger in season 2, although the original Green Home residents are still the show&#39;s protagonists. Although some of them have died already, others will return in the already confirmed season 3.




Given that the show was renewed for two new seasons after its debut, it is no surprise that Sweet Home season 2’s ending included a couple of major cliffhangers. Among those is the return of Eun-hyuk, played by Lee Do-hyun, whose fate after season 1 had yet to be revealed. Eun-hyuk is alive, but his reunion with his friends and family may not be a happy one.


 Hyun-su &amp; Eun-hyuk Could Be Enemies In Sweet Home Season 3 
         

Sweet Home season 2 ends with Eun-hyuk emerging from what was left of the Green Home building without any clothes on and smiling. This scene all but confirms that not only did Eun-hyuk turn into a monster and survive the destruction of the building, but he also entered the cocoon stage of the transformation. In other words, even though Eun-hyuk coming back should theoretically be good news, it is impossible to say how much of his original self is still there. Some neo-humans, like Hyun-su, can control their transformation relatively well, whereas others easily succumb to the curse.





 

Eun-hyuk’s smirk was quite scary and very out of character for him, strongly suggesting he is no longer in control – his monster self is. If so, Eun-hyuk may be a villain in Sweet Home season 3. Considering he now has powers, this could mean a fight between neo-humans between Hyun-su and Eun-hyuk. As cool as that may sound, it would be rather tragic for Eun-hyuk and Hyun-su, who built such as strong friendship in the first season, to become enemies in season 2. It must be noted that Hyun-su was last seen struggling to control his monster powers as well.



 Sweet Home Season 3 Could Be The Show’s Most Tragic Yet 
          




A couple of important characters died in Sweet Home season 2, but season 3 could be even sadder. Eun-yu spent the entire season hoping her brother was still alive and watching over her, only for her to learn that it was Hyun-su the one protecting her from the shadows. Although Eun-yu will obviously be very happy about her brother’s return, she will eventually have to confront the fact he may no longer be the person she knew. Yi-kyung’s daughter could also walk a path of villainy, whereas Ui-myeong/Sang-won is continuing his neo-human experiments.

                  Lee Jin-wook’s Sweet Home Season 2 Character Explained: Who Is He Actually Playing?   Lee Jin-wook returns in Sweet Home season 2 even though his character, Sang-wook, died at the end of season 1. Here’s his new character explained.   

Even Hyun-su could become a problem in Sweet Home season 3, as hinted at during his final scene with Eun-yu in the finale. Hyun-su is in a difficult position, as he wants to protect the lives of the “monsters” while also fighting for the protection of his friends. Eun-hyuk’s return as a neo-human in a different stage of the curse’s evolution complicates things, and it will be interesting to see how everything comes together. Dr. Lim and Ui-myeong/Sang-won want to learn more about the evolution of the monsters, meaning Eun-hyuk could become their target.
