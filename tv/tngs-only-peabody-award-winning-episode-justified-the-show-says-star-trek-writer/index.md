# TNGs Only Peabody Award-Winning Episode “Justified” The Show, Says Star Trek Writer


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s win of a Peabody Award for &#34;The Big Goodbye&#34; helped justify the struggling show&#39;s first season and validated its potential.   Tracy Tormé, the writer of &#34;The Big Goodbye,&#34; drew inspiration from classic film noir and detective stories to create a magical script that required minimal changes.   The Peabody Award was a surprise for Tormé and the show, providing a much-needed boost in response to the show&#39;s turmoil and difficulties, ultimately justifying the existence of The Next Generation.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: The Next Generation has only won one Peabody Award for an incredibly fun episode written by the late Tracy Tormé.




Star Trek: The Next Generation earned one Peabody Award, and the episode&#39;s writer pointed out how this helped justify the show in its rocky first season. Following in the footsteps of Star Trek: The Original Series was no small feat, and TNG didn&#39;t exactly hit the ground running. Still, the updated technology of the TNG era allowed the Star Trek writers to experiment more, and perhaps no invention proved as versatile as the holodeck. The late TNG writer Tracy Tormé capitalized on this new technology to pen Star Trek&#39;s first holodeck episode: TNG season 1, episode 12, &#34;The Big Goodbye.&#34;




According to the official website of the Peabody Awards, they seek to honor &#34;excellence in storytelling that reflects the social issues and the emerging voices of our day.&#34; Celebrating television, radio, and online media, the Peabodys had not honored much genre fiction prior to Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s win, and &#34;The Big Goodbye&#34; remains the only Star Trek episode to have earned a Peabody. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Tracy Tormé spoke about his experience working on &#34;The Big Goodbye.&#34; Read his full quote below:


I’d been interested from the [series] bible about the holodeck and I realized they hadn’t really done anything yet with that. That’s where “The Big Goodbye” came from. I’m a huge Raymond Chandler fan, and I thought it would really be fun to do a classic film noir and, of course, “The Big Goodbye” is a combination of The Big Sleep and The Long Goodbye. There’s also a lot of Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon in the story as well. It was a very magical script for me. It was very easy to write; it went through very few rewrites and changes and was not messed with by anybody. They left it alone.
I remember Susan Sackett calling me one morning in my office and saying “Oh my God, I have the most incredible news for you: ‘The Big Goodbye’ just won a Peabody Award. It’s the only one in science-fiction history.” It was absolutely out of nowhere. To this day, I’m grateful for it, but have no idea why it happened. And then Gene, Majel, Rick Berman, and I, and the director, Joseph Scanlan, flew to New York to spend the weekend in New York. I was given the award and had to wear a tuxedo. The show was really struggling at the time, it was actually not getting a lot of great response and word had gotten around about a lot of the turmoil on the show, so it was a big shot in the arm for the show to get the Peabody Award. It seemed to justify The Next Generation.







Tracy Tormé also wrote TNG&#39;s &#34;Haven,&#34; &#34;Conspiracy,&#34; &#34;The Schizoid Man,&#34; &#34;The Royale,&#34; and &#34;Manhunt.&#34; In TNG season 2, Tormé and then showrunner Maurice Hurley came into conflict with one another, and Tormé left the show at the end of the season.




                  7 Episodes From Star Trek: TNG&#39;s Worst Season Are Better Than You Remember   Star Trek: The Next Generation may not have hit the ground running, but these 7 episodes from season 1 hold up better than you might remember.    


 Tracy Tormé Created Dixon Hill, Star Trek&#39;s Favorite Fictional Detective 
&#34;The usual: martinis and skirts&#34;
         

Tracy Tormé, who tragically passed away on January 4, 2024, served as a story editor and writer on the first two seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Not only did he create the character of Dixon Hill, but he also pioneered the use of the holodeck as a means to send the TNG crew on adventures to various time periods. In &#34;The Big Goodbye,&#34; Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) takes a break from commanding the USS Enterprise-D to embrace his inner hard-boiled detective, taking on the role of Dixon Hill for a holodeck adventure that quickly turns deadly.




Picard&#39;s love for Dixon Hill would pop up in a few more episodes of TNG, as well as in Star Trek: First Contact. Star Trek: Picard season 2 also snuck in a shoutout to Dixon Hill, as Jean-Luc&#39;s ancestor, Renée Picard (Penelope Mitchell), is reading a Dixon Hill novel in the final moments of episode 4, &#34;Watcher.&#34; As with the other Dixon Hill novels, Tracy Torme can be seen to be the author of the book. As a writer for Star Trek: The Next Generation, Tracy Tormé certainly left his mark on the franchise, with the creation of a character who came to define an aspect of Captain Picard.

Star Trek: The Next Generation &amp; Star Trek: Picard are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
