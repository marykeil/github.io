# A Darker Our Flag Mean Death Replacement Came Out Exactly 10 Years Ago


## SUMMARY 



  Our Flag Means Death, a quirky and LGBTQ&#43;-friendly pirate series, has been canceled, but fans can still enjoy the darker series Black Sails, which also explores diversity within piracy.   While Our Flag Means Death focuses on the relationships between characters and has a lighter tone, Black Sails is more serious and includes intense action sequences with violence and morally ambiguous characters.   Black Sails may be a suitable replacement for fans of Our Flag Means Death due to its inclusion of LGBTQ&#43; relationships and characters, its exploration of similar themes, and its availability for streaming on platforms like Amazon Prime Video.

## Literature Review
Our Flag Means Death&#39;s cancelation is disappointing news for fans of the show. However, there is another alternative that could appeal.




The cancelation of Our Flag Means Death has shocked many fans of the show&#39;s uniquely quirky, LGBTQ&#43;-friendly comedy, but there is another – albeit, darker – pirate series available to watch. David Jenkins&#39; acclaimed series has been praised since its debut, particularly for its approach to diversity. While alternative shows may not be quite as focused on these issues, there are nonetheless parallels that make some of them suitable companion pieces.




Since its HBO Max premiere in March 2022, Our Flag Means Death has provided an irreverent take on one of the most romanticized periods of modern history. While some shows and movies, such as the Pirates of the Caribbean saga, have focused on swashbuckling supernatural elements of piracy, Our Flag Means Death&#39;s semi-true story revolves around the relationships between its characters. While there is no shortage of action and adventure, the dynamics between characters such as Stede Bonnet (the so-called &#34;Gentleman Pirate&#34; who abandons his family for life on the high seas) and Edward Teach set the show apart. While few series can claim such a commitment to character within the context of piracy, there is one that takes a comparable approach.

                  Our Flag Means Death Season 2 Ending Explained   In the finale of Our Flag Means Death season 2, Ed makes a surprising decision that impacts his future with Stede, while Zheng sets up season 3&#39;s arc.    





 There&#39;s Another LGBTQ&#43; Friendly Pirate Show (But It&#39;s Darker Than Our Flag Means Death) 
         

While Our Flag Means Death has understandably made headlines as the preeminent LGBTQ&#43;-friendly pirate TV show, the 10-year-old Black Sails arguably deserves just as much credit. Debuting in 2014, the Starz period drama is also set during the Golden Age of Piracy, blending fictional characters from Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s Treasure Island with real historical figures. Starring Toby Stephens as Captain Flint, the show is notable for including several prominent LGBTQ plotlines. However, while it does have some similarities with HBO&#39;s hit, there are some definite differences.

Whereas Our Flag Means Death has a light-hearted attitude to its criminal characters, Black Sails has a much more somber tone. Although not as violent as other Starz series such as Spartacus: Blood and Sand, the show definitely doesn&#39;t pull many punches in the action sequences. Particularly egregious scenes include a fistfight where one character is beaten to death, and several graphic instances of decapitation. The inclusion of some genuinely sinister characters alongside the main antiheroes also makes the series much more morally ambiguous than the comically quotable Our Flag Means Death. While these moments make Black Sails a very different sort of pirate show, it may still appeal to fans of Our Flag Means Death.






 Why Black Sails Is The Perfect Replacement After Our Flag Means Death&#39;s Cancelation 
          

The romantic subplot between Bonnet and Teach, along with the stories of several other queer and non-binary characters, has helped secure Our Flag Means Death&#39;s status as a boundary-pushing, inclusive show. Certainly, Black Sails does not have the same approach or explicit intention. However, there are reasons why the show can be seen as a worthy replacement for fans of the pirate genre.



Black Sails ran for four seasons between 2014-2017.




Although the action mainly focuses elsewhere, LGBTQ&#43; relationships and characters form a key part of the story – reflecting the reality of piracy in the early 19th century. For instance, Toby Stephens&#39; lead character Captain Flint is defined by his forced exclusion from society after he falls in love with another man. Flint&#39;s relationships with both male and female characters make his sexuality an essential part of his persona, in much the same way as it is for Bonnet and Teach in Our Flag Means Death. Tonally, the two shows take very different approaches to similar material. Nonetheless, they still speak to many of the same themes, as well as their main pirate story, making Black Sails a great alternative watch.






 Where To Watch Black Sails 
          

Another factor in Black Sails&#39; suitability as an Our Flag Means Death alternative is its ready availability. Black Sails season 1 is currently available to stream on Amazon Prime Video for free with a subscription. Additionally, other seasons may be purchased via Apple TV&#43;, or watched with an Apple TV&#43; Starz subscription. It is currently unclear if or when the remaining Black Sails seasons may arrive on Amazon Prime Video. However, the show&#39;s presence and enduring popularity suggest that seasons 2, 3, and 4 may be available at some point in the future.
