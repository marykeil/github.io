## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Kirsten Schoemaker found a surprising supporter in Tania Maduro while the world called her a cheater thanks to the evil Julio Moya.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Kirsten Schoemaker has found a surprising supporter in Tania Maduro at the Tell All. Kirsten and Julio Moya starred in season 5 of the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off after having met on Instagram. Julio wanted a change in life and moving to Europe seemed like a good option to him until he decided he should focus on his family first. While promising Kirsten that they would start a life together in the Netherlands, Julio brutally broke up with Kirsten on FaceTime. In the Tell All, Julio blamed the split on “trust issues” and accused Kirsten of cheating.




While the previous Tell All for 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 had a live audience to react to the bombshell reveals during filming, this time around, the show roped in seasoned cast members who had connections to the cast of The Other Way in one way or another. For instance, Tim was called because of his friendship with Kenny Niedermeier and Armando Rubio, while Tania was there because of her past relationship with South African man Syngin, as she would have been able to relate to Holly Weeks’ struggles in the country.

 Tania Stood Up For Kirsten 
          

Shaun Robinson asked Julio if Kirsten had cheated on him, and he revealed that he’d seen a photo of a man among some pictures from one of Kirsten’s dress-shopping trips. Kirsten defended herself, saying the man was just her friend. Julio claimed Kirsten called the man “Papi” and the cast even pushed her into calling her friend during the reunion. Kirsten said she used “Papi” as a term of endearment. Julio then accused her of sending “pictures” to her friend. Kirsten said it was a photo of her in a dress, and she’d asked her friend what he thought of her dress.




Tania rushed to Kirsten’s defense where she explained Kirsten had not sent anyone any nudes. It was just a picture of her trying on a dress. Tania explained that she herself had a lot of friends, and a lot of them were male. “I do like send them daily things,” Tania said. Tania revealed she speaks to her male friends all the time.



 No One Else From The Cast Called Out Julio For His Mistakes 

 

90 Day Fiancé star Tania questioned Julio directly about why he was accusing Kirsten of cheating on him. She said that nothing Kirsten sent to her friend was a nude. “Nothing was like, ‘Hey Papi…,’” Tania added. However, cast members such as Shekinah Garner, Daniele Gates, and Tim felt “off” about Kirsten. While Kirsten was unsuccessful in trying to convince them that she never cheated on Julio, Kirsten revealing the “real reason” Julio split with her was far more convincing. Kirsten said Julio had met a woman at a wedding they both attended where Julio was working as a DJ.




As per Kirsten, Julio fell in love with the woman and went on dates with her before splitting with Kirsten. Cast members were compelled to believe Julio was manipulating the entire conversation and trying to blame Kirsten for cheating when he was the one who was a cheater. However, they weren’t as hard on Julio as they were on Kirsten for simply calling her close friend her “Papi.” Moreover, they didn’t call out Julio for getting cold feet about leaving his family and not having the guts to say it to Kirsten. He strung her along hoping that she would break up with him.



 Why 90 Day Fiancé Fans Are Liking Tania More Following The Tell All Part 2 
          

Julio eventually decided he wanted to stay back in America and even found a reason, which was the new woman he was dating. Julio came to the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell All with a mission. It was to paint Kirsten as the villain. Fortunately for Kirsten, Tania supported her by being a “girl’s girl,” as discussed in a Reddit thread by u/MajesticMeasurement4. “I in general don’t like Tania, but she nailed it. I wish more women stuck up for Kirsten. I don’t believe Jew-lee-oh at all,” wrote Alycinwanderland. “Yesss I was glad Tania said something and Tim comes off as such a woman hater to me,” said Good_mornting.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
