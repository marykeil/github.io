## Literature Review

Lotus flowers play a major role in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 6, but why do they cause the characters to lose their memories?





Summary

  Percy Jackson&#39;s casino episode references The Odyssey, with lotus flowers causing the characters to lose track of time and fail in their quest.   The Lotus Hotel and Casino uses lotus flowers to create a euphoric state and keep visitors gambling.   The lotus flowers in The Odyssey and Percy Jackson impair memory and cause individuals to focus only on maintaining their joyful state.  







Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians references The Odyssey in its casino episode, which finds lotus flowers similar to those that appear in Homer&#39;s epic stalling Percy&#39;s quest. Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show brings Percy, Annabeth, and Grover to the Lotus Hotel and Casino in episode 6, but they spend more time there than they initially intend. Despite how close they are to the Underworld, the trio remain in Las Vegas past Zeus&#39; deadline for Percy&#39;s quest — and their failure can be attributed to the lotus flowers.

The Lotus Hotel and Casino pumps the flowers into the air, causing anyone who enters the establishment to forget things and lose track of time. This is a clever ploy to keep visitors gambling, and it prevents Percy, Annabeth, and Grover from moving forward as well. This plays out similarly in Rick Riordan&#39;s books, and the author draws the concept of the lotus flowers from The Odyssey.

 The Lotus-Eaters In Homer&#39;s The Odyssey Explained (&amp; How Odysseus Frees His Men) 
Homer&#39;s Hero Had To Chain Them To Their Ship
          

The Lotus Hotel and Casino in Percy Jackson gets its name from Greek mythology, drawing inspiration specifically from Homer&#39;s epic poem, The Odyssey. The Odyssey features a group of islanders called the Lotus-Eaters, all of whom live in constant bliss. This is because they eat lotus flowers that create a euphoric mental state. The Lotus-Eaters offer these plants to Odysseus&#39; men during their journey back to Troy in The Odyssey, bringing their travels to a grinding halt.

When given the lotus flowers, Odysseus&#39; companions fall into a similar trance, forgetting about their loved ones and home. Odysseus is only able to save them by forcibly chaining them to their ship, then sailing away (via Britannica). Much like Percy Jackson&#39;s lotus flowers, those in The Odyssey have effects that wear off after a while. However, Odysseus&#39; crew likely would have been trapped with the Lotus-Eaters forever if their leader hadn&#39;t gone to extreme measures to remove them from the island. That&#39;s because the lotus flowers in the text impair memory and cause those who consume them to focus only on maintaining their joyful state.






 The Lotus Flower&#39;s Narcotic Effects &amp; Powers Explained 
The Odyssey&#39;s Plant Has A Psychotropic Quality
          

The reason the lotus flowers have such a powerful effect on the characters in The Odyssey is because they have a narcotic nature, causing an inflated sense of joy and eliminating a person&#39;s negative feelings. This leads them to forget what matters most: their goals and purpose, their loved ones, and their homes. After consuming the plant, Odysseus&#39; men want more of it, suggesting an addictive quality. And in the quest to consume more of the plant, Odysseus&#39; men — and everyone else eating it — lose their memories.

While The Odyssey&#39;s portrayal of the lotus flower is somewhat exaggerated, the blue lotus flower does have psychotropic effects (via Healthline). It&#39;s been used to decrease anxiety and improve sleep, though its medicinal effects aren&#39;t scientifically proven or recommended. Still, the flower&#39;s history likely served as inspiration for Homer while writing The Odyssey. And Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians puts its own spin on the plant from The Odyssey, making it another Easter egg that appears in episode 6.






 How Percy Jackson&#39;s Lotus-Eaters Compare To The Greek Myth 
The Disney Show Puts A Fun, Modern Spin On The Odyssey
         

Percy Jackson puts a comedic, modern spin on the lotus flowers from The Odyssey, but the demigods&#39; experience with the plant is pretty similar to that of Odysseus&#39; crew. Riordan&#39;s books — and both on-screen adaptations — see the Lotus Hotel and Casino pumping the narcotic plant into the air, causing visitors to lose their memories and completely lose track of time. It&#39;s humorous that this happens in a casino, as such establishments often attempt to keep visitors there in other ways, like dimming the lights and removing windows. In the world of gods and demigods, the lotus flowers serve this purpose instead.

While Percy Jackson&#39;s modernized use of the lotus flowers is much different from eating them on an island, the characters&#39; reactions to the plant perfectly mirror Homer&#39;s poem. Grover completely forgets why he&#39;s at the casino and winds up following another satyr around before getting lost in a virtual-reality game. Percy and Annabeth nearly forget about Grover as well, and they lose track of time — so much so that they miss the deadline to complete their quest. Needless to say, the lotus flower has just as negative an impact in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians as it does in The Odyssey.
