# Star Trek Prodigy Creator Reveals His One Wish For Animated Series


## SUMMARY 



  Kevin Hageman&#39;s biggest wish for future episodes of Star Trek: Prodigy is to have longer episodes, allowing for more in-depth storytelling and dramatic moments.   It is unlikely that Prodigy season 2 will feature longer episodes, so Kevin Hageman&#39;s wish may only be realized if the show is renewed for season 3.   The decision to renew Star Trek: Prodigy for another season will depend on factors such as viewership statistics and negotiations between Netflix and Paramount.

## Literature Review

Star Trek: Prodigy co-creator Kevin Hageman looks back on the animated series and highlights his biggest wish for the future of the show.




Star Trek: Prodigy co-creator Kevin Hageman has revealed his biggest wish for future episodes of the Star Trek animated series. The story of Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray) and the former crew of the USS Protostar will continue when Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix later in 2024. All 20 episodes of Prodigy season 2 are prepped and ready to go, meaning that Kevin and Dan Hageman are looking toward what&#39;s next for the Star Trek animated series.




Kevin Hageman explained his one wish for Star Trek: Prodigy in a discussion at TrekTalks 3&#39;s Producing Trek Panel, which helped to raise over $109,000 for Hollywood Food Coalition. During the panel, brothers Hageman discussed Star Trek: Prodigy with Star Trek: Voyager writer and producer Brannon Braga. While Dan Hageman revealed that Star Trek: Prodigy season 2&#39;s release date is a mystery, Kevin Hageman outlined a desire to do longer-form episodes. Read Kevin Hageman&#39;s quote, and watch the panel at the 03:44:42 timestamp below:


Kevin Hageman: As I look back on Prodigy, my one wish would be: I wish we could have had longer episodes. To be able to do a 40-minute episode, it would have allowed us to sit on moments longer and dramatize stuff even more. Because right now, itâ€™s just so fast.



 




                  Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 Episodes Are Ready For Netflix, Say Executive Producers   Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s executive producers announce that production is in the final mix for season 2&#39;s finale as the episodes get ready for Netflix.   


 Will There Be A Star Trek: Prodigy Season 3? 
Kevin Hageman could get his wish if Star Trek: Prodigy is renewed.
          

Kevin Hageman is talking in the past tense at TrekTalks 3, so it seems likely that Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 won&#39;t feature any longer episodes. Instead, Prodigy season 2 will likely be peppered with occasional two-parters like season 1. The only hope for Kevin Hageman to realize his ambition for 40-minute episodes of Star Trek: Prodigy is if Netflix renews the show for season 3. It&#39;s unclear how likely a Star Trek: Prodigy season 3 renewal is at this stage. In considering this, Netflix will examine the statistics for Prodigy season 1&#39;s Christmas Day release alongside how many streams season 2 gets when it premieres.




It&#39;s also unknown whether the specifics of Netflix&#39;s streaming deal for Star Trek: Prodigy allow them to commission new episodes. When Paramount&#43; canceled Prodigy, they allowed the Hagemans, Aaron J. Waltke, and the production team to complete the remaining 20 episodes and sell them to another streaming service or broadcaster. It&#39;s hoped that there is a contract stipulation that will allow for future negotiations between Netflix and Paramount to ensure that Star Trek: Prodigy can continue to tell the story of the young Starfleet recruits and fulfill Kevin Hageman&#39;s desire for longer episodes.



All episodes of Star Trek: Prodigy are streaming now on Netflix.
