## Literature Review
It&#39;s no secret that Welcome to Plathville&#39;s Oiliva Plath had no patience left for her former in-laws, prompting her to move away from them.




Olivia Plath of Welcome to Plathville took to social media to not-so secretly put her in-laws, Kim and Barry Plath, on blast after the disastrous move to Minnesota. For multiple seasons, Olivia clashed with Ethan&#39;s family, often causing major tensions. While Ethan and Olivia are now getting divorced, the beginning of the end was the couple&#39;s move up north to Minnesota. The professional photographer has tried her best to get away from Ethan&#39;s hometown, but the drama always seems to follow her. As fans await the fallout of Welcome to Plathville season 6, it&#39;s time to revisit Olivia&#39;s obvious shade to Kim and Barry.




Ethan was raised on a secluded farm in Cairo, GA, where Kim and Barry implemented strict rules that were based on their religious beliefs. He and his siblings were homeschooled, and prohibited from eating candy or watching TV. Kim often controlled her children by not allowing them to dress how they wanted and keeping them sheltered from the outside world. While Olivia was also raised with strict beliefs, she had a bit more freedom that made her want to explore the world. These ideas caused significant tension between the Olivia and Ethan&#39;s family, causing Welcome to Plathville to be one of the best reality TV shows.

In a now-deleted Instagram story, Olivia posted about how she truly doesn&#39;t enjoy living in the cold but was willing to do it to have some space between her and the Plaths. A Welcome to Plathville fan asked why she and Ethan had chosen to move from sunny Florida, with Olivia revealing that they have a &#34;wonderful family&#34; in the state of 10,000 lakes. The reality star continued sharing that she and Ethan wanted to experience living in Minnesota but also had decided that &#34;being around family that loves, supports and wants to spend time with both of us was something missing in our lives.&#34; However, the move proved to be their downfall.






 Was Olivia Shading The Plaths? 
          

Olivia spent much of her time with her side of the family, the Meggs, especially her sister Lydia Grace, while out in Minnesota. Her comments seemed to be a dig at issues with Kim and Barry. As followers know, the young couple infamously had a falling out with Ethan&#39;s parents after Kim insinuated that Olivia might be possessed, and the problems only snowballed from there. Kim often tried to break the couple up, with Ethan being put in the middle of many of their arguments.

Ethan and Olivia first moved to Tampa to try and escape the grips of Kim and Barry and then spent the summer living in Paris and traveling around Europe. Olivia has always been outspoken when it came to her desire to travel, but Ethan was a bit more reserved. Welcome to Plathville season 5 saw the final dissolution of Ethan and Olivia&#39;s marriage, despite their move to Minnesota. The distance couldn&#39;t repair the damage Barry and Kim had already done.
