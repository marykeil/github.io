 10  Hold Tight 
Where To Watch: Netflix


 







Hold Tight centers on a group of friends who try and fail to bury the secret about their friend, Igor’s, accidental death. The series’ premise is undoubtedly grim, following those close to Igor as they cope with the aftermath of his tragic end. In light of its dour premise, the series does a very poor job of handling such a delicate subject. Featuring hired killers, drugs, revenge porn, and bokken skirmishes, the resulting narrative balks under the weight of its endless plot twists. Hold Tight’s saving grace is a handful of great actors, but it remains one of the most challenging entries in Harlan Coben’s collection to recommend.





 9  Just One Look 
Where To Watch: Not available on streaming
        

Just One Look centers on spouses, Eva and Bastien, whose world upends when Bastien disappears. While the miniseries benefits from its beautiful opening, the plot struggles to remain cohesive following Bastien’s disappearance. After forcing Eva to carry the story through a succession of bizarre twists, it doubles down with a conclusion that is at once unsatisfying and ridiculous. That said, Virginie Ledoyen’s performance as Eva is extraordinary. While the show doesn’t hold a candle to some of Harlan Coben’s other titles, with only six episodes to the series, Just One Look remains a binge-worthy watch that will still entertain even if it doesn’t always make sense.





 8  The Stranger 
Where To Watch: Netflix
        

Starring the affable Richard Armitage, The Stranger follows a man whose life implodes after a mysterious woman reveals upsetting secrets about his wife. The woman visits multiple families in town and reveals similar secrets, coalescing into a perfect storm of unearthed murders, shady affairs, and corrupt deals. The Stranger benefits from outstanding performances and its dark humor, with a plot that is intriguing even if it isn’t anything particularly new. Even though some elements of the story are highly unlikely, the series does a spectacular job of tying up its loose ends. While it isn’t as good as other Harlan Coben titles, The Stranger remains satisfying from start to finish.

The Stranger is one of Netflix&#39;s new hit shows, but some things just in the series really don&#39;t make sense. 









 7  Shelter 
Where To Watch: Prime Video
        

Shelter centers on Mickey Bolitar, a New Jersey high schooler who begins investigating the disappearance of a fellow student after peculiar events surrounding his father raise questions. While the series kicks off with an interesting premise, it struggles to be consistent, with Shelter&#39;s young cast, who can be jarring in one scene to quite charming in the next. The series’ biggest flaw is its plot, as it frequently demands a suspension of belief when transitioning between sequences. Despite these imperfections, Shelter is an enjoyable binge-watch, featuring an undeniably fun and intriguing plot, even when its coherence is not always maintained.

The Myron Bolitar series is author Harlan Coben&#39;s magnum opus work, but the reluctant detective is conspicuously absent from Coben&#39;s series Shelter.









 6  The Woods 
Where To Watch: Netflix
        

The Woods centers on a cold case from 1994 surrounding a boy and girl who go missing while at summer camp. The series takes place 25 years later and follows the girl’s brother, Pawel Kopinski, as he investigates their disappearance. Perhaps the worst thing about the series is its uneven pacing, as it frequently shifts between past and present events. That said, the plot is rewarding for those who manage to follow along, with a compelling storytelling style and intriguing characters. Harlan Coben&#39;s debut Polish adaptation, The Woods, features a brilliant cast, presenting an enticing option for anyone in pursuit of a binge-worthy mystery.





 5  No Second Chance 
Where To Watch: Not available on streaming
        

No Second Chance follows Alice as she embarks on a desperate quest to recover her kidnapped daughter after a violent home intrusion leaves her savagely attacked. Assisted by a team of detectives, Alice unravels a tragic family history at the center of an intricate global operation. Despite a somewhat underwhelming ending, No Second Chance starts with a compelling premise that builds into an intriguing mystery. A standout aspect is Hippolyte Girardot&#39;s portrayal of Detective Tessier, contributing to a tidy, interesting, and perfectly-sized miniseries. Overall, No Second Chance offers a captivating narrative, although the concluding moments may leave some room for improvement.





 4  Stay   
Where To Watch: Netflix
        

In the rip-roaring eight-episode thriller Stay  , Megan Pierce&#39;s past secrets threaten to disrupt her life when a young man goes missing, leading his affluent father to enlist killers for his retrieval. A standout and truly fantastic element of this series lies in its wholehearted embrace of the inherent perennial tomfoolery found in Harlan Coben’s novels. Notable characters include a pair of local police officers investigating a potential serial killer and another pair of psychotic thespians-turned-killers who seamlessly blend performance and torture. Stay   utilizes its ensemble cast of comedians for a captivating and humorous narrative, ensuring that the eight-episode journey is truly worthwhile.





 3  Safe 
Where To Watch: Netflix


 







Safe follows Tom, a widowed father whose life unravels as he realizes his seemingly secure neighborhood harbors unimaginable criminals. Infused with Harlan Coben&#39;s dark humor, the series explores the irony of a gated community&#39;s facade. Its standout feature is the exceptional cast of characters. Despite an unapologetically absurd premise, Safe emerges as one of Coben&#39;s superior works, offering an intriguing and enjoyable script. The narrative, while unconventional, captivates with its blend of humor and suspense, making it a compelling watch. The exploration of societal contradictions and the stellar performances contribute to Safe being a noteworthy entry in Coben&#39;s repertoire, providing entertainment that is engaging, amusing, and easily binge-able.





 2  The Innocent 
Where To Watch: Netflix
        

The Innocent emerges as a strong contender for one of Harlan Coben&#39;s finest works, tracing the journey of an ex-convict and lawyer in search of revenge and answers following his wife&#39;s disappearance. Despite encompassing elements like guns, murder, cults, and sexual violence, the series weaves a narrative rich in substance. The main character&#39;s quest for revenge becomes a poignant exploration of his past and regrets, creating a story that intertwines closure with redemption. At its core, The Innocent features a character worth investing in, elevating it into a thriller that undeniably warrants attention. The show stands out as a compelling, must-watch within Coben&#39;s collection.





 1  Fool Me Once 
Where To Watch: Netflix


 







Fool Me Once stands as the zenith of Harlan Coben&#39;s collection, weaving the harrowing tale around Maya&#39;s pursuit of truth following the death of both her sister and husband. The series swiftly ascended to Netflix&#39;s Top 10, captivating a global audience with its intricately plotted eight episodes. Its brilliance is underscored by a stellar ensemble featuring Michelle Keegan, Richard Armitage, Adeel Akhtar, Emmett J. Scanlan, Dino Fetscher, and Joanna Lumley. While Fool Me Once left a handful of questions unanswered, the show delivers a narrative that culminates in a neat and profoundly satisfying conclusion. With only eight episodes to fill out the series, this must-watch is easily binge-able.
