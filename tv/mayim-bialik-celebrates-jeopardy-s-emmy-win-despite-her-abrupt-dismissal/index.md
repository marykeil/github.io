## Literature Review
Mayim Bialik takes to Instagram to celebrate Jeopardy&#39;s recent Emmy win despite her sudden dismissal from the long-running television game show. 




Former Jeopardy! host Mayim Bialik celebrates the popular game show’s recent Emmy win despite her sudden dismissal from the show. Jeopardy!, since its inception, has primarily featured a single host who anchors the show and tests the knowledge of various contestants with clues in the form of the answer to a question. This format changed when Alex Trebek, the show’s longest-running host, unfortunately passed away in 2020, and was succeeded by Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik.




Following Jeopardy!’s recent Emmy win for Outstanding Game Show, Mayim Bialik took to her personal Instagram account to celebrate the show she was recently dismissed from while also congratulating Keke Palmer, who became the first woman to win the Emmy for Outstanding Host for a Game Show since 2009. 


 

In the post, Bialik expresses her pride to have been a part of the 2022 season of Jeopardy!, which won a Primetime Emmy. She also expressed “hearty congratulations” to Keke Palmer, saluting her and referring to her as an inspiration for women everywhere.

The news of Bialik’s sudden dismissal from Jeopardy! came as a shock to viewers. The former Big Bang Theory alum assumed co-hosting duties in 2021 alongside Jennings, both hosting the syndicated version of the show for seasons 38 and 39. Bialik also hosted various other tournaments, Primetime specials, and a season of Celebrity Jeopardy!.



The decision to move forward with Jennings as the single host was explained by a Sony spokesperson, who revealed that the resolution was prompted by an aim to provide continuity for the dedicated viewers of the show.




Following the announcement of Ken Jennings as the singular host of Jeopardy! season 40, Sony, also announced that Mayim Bialik had been dismissed despite receiving an Emmy nomination. The decision to move forward with Jennings as the single host was explained by a Sony spokesperson, who revealed that the resolution was prompted by an aim to provide continuity for the dedicated viewers of the show.

While Sony has yet to give any other clear-cut explanation as to why Bialik was dismissed from Jeopardy!, as stated above, her exit from the show might have been foreseen. Since she took over co-hosting duties on the show, she’s struggled to win over certain audiences due to her breaking some of Jeopardy!’s long-standing rules. Regardless, following her sudden exit, it’ll be interesting to see what new project the talented actress and host embarks upon.
