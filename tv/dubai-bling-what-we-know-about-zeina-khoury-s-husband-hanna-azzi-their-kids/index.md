## Literature Review

Dubai Bling season 2 star Zeina Khoury&#39;s married to Hanna Azzi, and he&#39;s a successful hospitality expert. He&#39;s also a loving father and husband. 




Dubai Bling star Zeina Khoury is married to Hanna Azzi, and it&#39;s time to share some fascinating facts about the man who won her heart. During season 2, Zeina&#39;s distracted by an increasingly temperamental and childish Ebraheem Al Samadi. When he tried to apologize for the iconic season 1 office invasion, Ebraheem didn&#39;t do a very good job. Things got tense - Zeina, openly disturbed by the man, physically avoided him after his apology triggered yet another argument. Sometimes, Dubai Bling&#39;s Zeina Khoury seems like a villain because she&#39;s strong. While Ebraheem tries to make her look like a bad person, her husband knows who she really is.




Dubai Bling season 2&#39;s Zeina&#39;s been married to Hanna for more than ten years. They&#39;re parents with busy and glamorous lives. Zeina has a nanny because she&#39;s juggling work and motherhood. The &#34;Queen of Versace&#34; dazzles in the Italian fashion house&#39;s iconic designs, no matter how bold and bright they are. She&#39;s an outgoing Sagittarius - risk-taking is second nature to this optimistic Sun sign. Of course, she&#39;s brave enough to go for outrageous style. Sag natives are natural gamblers and Zeina rolls the dice in the high-stakes world of luxury real estate. While she plays the odds, she keeps her husband close by. She&#39;s clearly found her perfect match.

Zeina Khoury&#39;s A Real Estate Mogul - Her Husband Works At A Resort

 

Nothing screams sun-soaked decadence like the words, &#34;Nikki Beach Resort &amp; Spa Dubai.&#34; This isn&#39;t an ad, but the resort was created to please well-heeled clients, so it&#39;s notably glamorous. At this resort, situated in Diamond City (yes, that&#39;s Dubai&#39;s nickname) it&#39;s all about people-watching. Naturally, there are some seriously enticing relaxation options. As per Nikkibeachdubai at Instagram, the resort was all lit up during the holidays, and the guests were radiant too.




At Nikki Beach Resort &amp; Spa Dubai, Hanna&#39;s all about ensuring that guests get the most from their time at the resort. As per Connecting Travel, he&#39;s the General Manager of Nikki Beach Resort &amp; Spa Dubai. In 2015, he began his stint with the Nikki Beach company. The Lebanese businessman helped to open the Dubai resort. He was promoted, starting out as the Resort Operations Manager. Before becoming a Nikki Beach employee, he worked at a range of impressive hotels, including the Four Seasons and Raffles.

The future hospitality expert grew up in Canada. So, the Great White North is a part of Dubai Bling&#39;s exciting melting pot of cultures. People from all over the world come to Dubai for business and pleasure. The playground for the rich is loaded with expats. Zeina and Hanna share Lebanese ethnicity, which is one more thing that they have in common. His time in Canada probably helped him to hone his people skills, as Canadians are known for their good manners. There are jokes about Canadians apologizing too much, and there&#39;s a grain of truth in that. In the hospitality world, that kind of consideration can really pay off.






 Dubai Bling&#39;s Zeina Khoury Has Two Kids With Hanna Azzi 
Their Names Are Alexa &amp; Joel Azzi

 

Zeina and Hanna have a daughter named Alexa and a son named Joel. In a clip posted at Zeina&#39;s YouTube channel, she mentioned her kids while wearing a dramatic fire-engine red evening gown. Yes, she looked fabulous, giving Dubai Bling&#39;s Ebraheem Al Samadi a run for his money in terms of groundbreaking fashion choices. However, at times, she dials down the over-the-top glamour, putting on comfortable clothes and hanging out with her children.

The previously mentioned nanny helps her to balance work and life, but Zeina has admitted to occasionally getting impatient with her kids. Zeina&#39;s very Type A - this ambitious career woman needs to shift gears when she&#39;s at home. However, there&#39;s nothing that she can&#39;t do when she puts her mind to it.




Her kids are adorable, and her son &#34;baby Joe&#34; is shown below, posing with Zeina and Hanna in Dubai. When Zeina adds this kind of content to Instagram, she shows her softer side. Zeina gets a bad rap sometimes, but some of her feuds aren&#39;t really her fault. She has encountered difficult people in Dubai, and loyalty and respect are important to her. If she isn&#39;t getting either of those things, she won&#39;t stick around. And who can blame her? With Ebraheem, it seems so hopeless. He&#39;s locked into a point of view and doesn&#39;t see his role in things. Arguing with him is like arguing with a brick wall.


 

Dubai Bling season 2&#39;s been a wild ride, thanks to a feud that&#39;s dividing the cast. The whole fracas seems to make Zeina feel uncomfortable. She&#39;s tough, but this installment of the show has brought her to tears more than once. Luckily, she has a loving family, not to mention the kind of fulfilling career that costar Mona Katty also enjoys. All the same, it must bother her that Ebraheem&#39;s inept apology was broadcast all over the world. He was bullied as a child, and now that he&#39;s an adult, he may get triggered when people attack him. This could cause him to overreact. Sometimes, he doesn&#39;t act his age.




In contrast, Zeina is a very poised woman. When a person like Ebraheem breaks her boundaries, there may be no going back. She tried to forgive him, but his apology didn&#39;t seem sincere. It seemed like another excuse to tangle with her. However, the drama is what makes Dubai Bling season 2 so exciting.



Dubai Bling season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.
