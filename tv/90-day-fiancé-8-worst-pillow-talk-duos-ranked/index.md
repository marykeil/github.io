## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk has been around since 2019 and has showcased the commentary of some duos that should not have been on the show.




90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk has been around since 2019, and there have been many duos on the show that should not have been. Pillow Talk airs after new episodes of currently airing 90 Day Fiancé franchise shows end. The twosomes give commentary and have witty banter while watching new episodes and dish on the drama and cast members. The show is shot from the duo&#39;s couch or bed and often involves animated narration and critiques.
There is a handful of90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk pairs that stand out from the rest as being the worst for their on-screen antics and appearance on the show in the first place. To get cast on Pillow Talk, cast members need to stand out from previous seasons and spinoffs for their entertaining dynamic and harsh takes. However, the most ideal cast member couples don&#39;t always make it onto the show, and instead, viewers have been left with some questionable commentating choices.









 








 8  Kimberly And Jamal Menzies 
        

Kimberly was on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4 and 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7 before she and her son Jamal Menzies were tapped to appear on Pillow Talk. Jamal had been an integral part of Kim&#39;s airtime and decisions during her seasons. On Pillow Talk, Kim and Jamal watch from a couch that appears to be in the middle of their kitchen, which fans have found bizarre. Moreover, it&#39;s clear that Kim tries too hard to make funny jokes and banter back and forth with Jamal.
There was one unbelievable situation that occurred during Pillow Talk where Jamal handed Kim a plate of tuna and crackers that Kim proceeded to try. The tuna ended up being cat food, and while the whole scene was funny, it was impractical. It only added to the notion that the pair force humor into their watch parties.





 7  Dean Hashim And Rigin Bado 
        

Dean is the brother of 90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Tarik Myers. Rigin is Dean&#39;s Filipina wife. Dean got little screen time alongside his brother,, and the pair had a falling out while appearing on Pillow Talk. From there, Rigin became Tarik&#39;s replacement after the couple&#39;s Philippines life and the birth of their son made it onto an episode of 90 Day Diaries. Dean was known for being loud and overbearing on Pillow Talk with Tarik, and his love of getting his point across loudly transferred over to Pillow Talk with Rigin.
Rigin remained primarily quiet on Pillow Talk while Dean got riled up at little things and used his famed sweat rag to wipe his face. The pair seemed like a strange choice for Pillow Talk, given that they had no real basis on the show itself and were D-list characters. Moreover, Dean&#39;s loudness was doing too much.





 6  Loren And Alexei Brovarnik 


Loren and Alexei were long-time Pillow Talk cast members to the point where they had been on the show long enough. At one point, not a season of Pillow Talk went by without seeing Loren and Alexei on it. It seemed like they were trying to keep their 90 Day Fiancé spotlight active by appearing on the show continuously. And it worked for them because they only took a break to film the spinoff Loren &amp; Alexei: After the 90 Days, where they were the stars.
Loren and Alex are historically well-liked within the franchise, but their appearance on Pillow Talk pushed out fresh faces and made the show less exciting. As fans got to know Loren and Alexei&#39;s humor and mannerisms while watching episodes on Pillow Talk, they became predictable. They were not as funny as they thought, and their appearance on the show was tiresome.





 5  Jenny Slatten And Sumit Singh 


 







Jenny and Sumit started their Pillow Talk journey after their three-season run on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. Neither Jenny nor Sumit ever really make any cutting remarks or give any hot takes on the drama they see from the other cast members. In all, Jenny and Sumit have been very vanilla on the show. While they might be a fan-favorite couple, that doesn&#39;t translate over to Pillow Talk necessarily.





 4  Betty And Ron Gibbs 
        

Ron and Betty Gibbs, the parents of 90 Day Fiancé alum Brandon Gibbs, were given a spot on Pillow Talk. Their run on the spinoff was marked by Ron&#39;s ultra-small shorts and camera angles that proved to be uncomfortable for the viewers. What actually became more cringy and iconic was Betty sitting in bed with Ron eating a big bowl of snails with her red wine. Ron and Betty, who liked to drink during 90 Day Fiancé, showcased their continued love of wine on Pillow Talk as well. They would get drunk and slam the new cast members and their behavior.





 3  Bilal Hazziez And Shaeeda Sween 


 







Bilal and Shaeeda were selected as Pillow Talk cast members shortly after their monotonous run on 90 Day Fiancé season 9 and 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7. Viewers had enough of the pair, and especially condescending Bilal, when they were confronted by them becoming cast members on Pillow Talk. Bilal&#39;s mansplaining and Shaeeda&#39;s complacency drove viewers up the wall during their time on the hit reality shows, and they were not good Pillow Talk choices because of it.





 2  Big Ed Brown And Norma Brown 


 







In between franchise appearances, Ed and his mom Norma were Pillow Talk cast members. Big Ed is a controversial figure in the network and often says unhinged and offensive things. While that sounds like a good recipe for reality TV, Big Ed crosses lines. Giving Ed more airtime on Pillow Talk only inflated his ego and feeling like he was a TLC star. Norma never said anything of note on the show, and Ed acted like his normal annoying self. Many viewers were upset by his appearance on the show because they felt like the network was rewarding his bad behavior, which has continued to be a trend.





 1  Stephanie Matto And Magda Ballaro 
        

Stephanie and her mom Magda were the oddest choice of a duo. Viewers only met Stephanie&#39;s mom for an episode, and Stephanie was widely perceived negatively by 90 Day Fiancé fans. During their time on Pillow Talk, Stephanie tried too hard to make edgy and uncomfortable remarks about what was going on on-screen. There were plenty of other great options of cast members to take the 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk spot other than Stephanie and her mom, who viewers did not connect with.
90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk airs Sundays at 11 p.m. ET on TLC.
