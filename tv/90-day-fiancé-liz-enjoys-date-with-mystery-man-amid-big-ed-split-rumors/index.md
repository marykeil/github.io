## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Liz Woods spotted on a date with rumored boyfriend after Big Ed Brown shared cuddly pics with female friend on Instagram.




Liz Woods from 90 Day: The Last Resort is going on dates with a mystery man while rumors of her split from Big Ed Brown continue to circulate. Liz is a 30-year-old American woman who worked in a San Diego restaurant when she met Big Ed, 56. Big Ed and his ex-girlfriend Rose Vega had just broken up on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. Big Ed became friends with Liz while frequenting her restaurant. Liz wasn&#39;t too keen on dating Big Ed when he asked her out. They even broke up in 90 Day: The Single Life season 1.




Shockingly, Big Ed and Liz ended up getting engaged when they got back together and decided they&#39;d get married on 90 Day: The Last Resort. However, Liz and Big Ed have both sparked split rumors since the show ended. Reddit user

u/cuddlyturtle945 posted a screenshot of a video posted by Liz on her Instagram Stories.


 

The boomerang video showed Liz clinking cocktail glasses with someone. She made sure to hide the face of the man sitting in front of her at the table. However, it did not look like Big Ed at all. Liz and her mystery date seemed to be enjoying cheesy fries and tequila shots on their date night with matching margaritas.

 Is Big Ed From 90 Day Fiancé Single Again? 
          

Liz did not caption her video, but the fan noted this wasn&#39;t the first time that Liz had been on a date with someone who wasn&#39;t Big Ed. They mentioned Liz posted other pictures recently on a “date night” but only showed the man&#39;s hand. &#34;Is she messing with us or in a new rebound relationship?&#34; the fan asked, as others such as TallRedhead1014 commented, &#34;oh good for her! Ed is the worst.&#34; Big Ed and Liz had broken up for the 11th time when they appeared in the 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7 Tell-All. Liz didn&#39;t like that Big Ed had slid into Rose&#39;s DMs.


 




By the time they attended 90 Day: The Last Resort, Big Ed and Liz had been through their 13th split. Surprisingly, couples therapy seemed to be working for them. Big Ed and Liz were perhaps the most drama-free couple in season 1. Their future looked promising to those who watched them on screen. Besides, fans knew of a supposed spoiler about the couple which hinted at their August 2023 wedding. There was a wedding website that revealed Big Ed and Liz were going to get married in front of family and friends during a ​wedding ceremony and reception held in Bentonville, Arkansas.

But alas, Big Ed and Liz have seemingly split again since she&#39;s sharing videos and photos from her dates with someone else. Earlier this month, Big Ed went to watch a game in San Diego without his alleged wife Liz. Instead, Big Ed was accompanied by a female friend. He shared cuddly photos with the woman on his Instagram. Big Ed and Liz&#39;s apparent breakup does not mean that 90 Day: The Last Resort wasn&#39;t the last time they were together on TV. If the cameras did film their split, fans would be in for more drama and chaos in an upcoming spin-off.
