## Literature Review
Tiki was one of the 16 mystery celebrity singers competing on The Masked Singer season 10. Find out his true identity and how his clues proved it.




During the Group B finals on &#34;I Wanna Rock&#34; Night, The Masked Singer season 10 revealed that Tiki was hard rock singer and Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach, and there were many clues to his true identity. Host Nick Cannon and panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger have all returned for The Masked Singer&#39;s milestone season. It kicked off on premiere night with the reveal of Anonymouse as Demi Lovato, one of the biggest unmaskings in the show&#39;s history.




The Masked Singer season 10 Group B consisted of Billie Jean King (Royal Hen), Hawk (Tyler Posey), Husky (Ginuwine), Tiki (Sebastian Bach), and Wild Card Sea Queen. During the Group B finals, Husky was unmasked first, sending Tiki and Sea Queen to the Battle Royale. Although both of their performances were fantastic, Sea Queen made it through to the finale, while Tiki was eliminated. The panelists had used their only save with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell during the Group A finals, so there was a double elimination. Here are the clues that helped prove that Tiki was Sebastian Bach.

 Tikiâ€™s Elton John Night Performance &amp; Clues 

 

During The Masked Singer season 10 Elton John Night, Tiki sang a fantastic version of &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&#34; showcasing his vocal range with some impressive high notes. When he first came out on stage, Jenny said that he looked &#34;really tall,&#34; and pointed out that people have to know how to walk in heels like his. Tiki&#39;s clue package began with the title, &#34;Behind the Tiki,&#34; from the channel MS10, which was a nod to Behind the Music, the tell-all show about singers and bands from VH1. Tiki opened the clue package by screaming &#34;Alright!&#34; in a high-pitched rock star voice.




Tiki was then shown inside a recording studio saying, &#34;From as far back as I can remember, I&#39;ve always wanted to be a rock star. As a kid, I knew I had the pipes.&#34; Tiki was then standing next to an alarm clock flashing the word, &#34;SNOOZE,&#34; in red letters while he said, &#34;So when my dream came true, it made perfect sense.&#34; 

Tiki was next seen walking in a room with a globe, two tikis, and four records hanging on the wall that said, &#34;Tiki #1.&#34; He continued, &#34;I got to sell millions of records, travel the world, and party with some of music&#39;s biggest names.&#34; At that point, a human skull was shown. Tiki then admitted, &#34;But I was a stiff drink with a loose mouth, and I got myself in a lot of trouble.&#34;

Tiki&#39;s friend, Pineapple, was then shown sitting in a dark room next to a piano. It was so dark that his face couldn&#39;t be seen. He shared, &#34;Yeah, he definitely rubbed some people the wrong way, so it was no surprise a few of them wanted to rum punch him in the face.&#34; Tiki went on to say, &#34;After all the highs, I was left fearing my career would be poured down the drain.&#34; Tiki was then shown in a black and white scene laying on a couch in a trashed room. His portrait on the wall was crooked. Then, a monkey in a party hat appeared in the room.




Tiki continued, &#34;Instead, I cleaned up my act, stepped out on my own, and showed that I&#39;m still at the top of my game.&#34; Tiki was then shown in another black and white scene, but this time he looked strong and powerful, standing on stage in front of a crowd of adoring fans. Tiki concluded his clue package by saying, &#34;And as for these other singers? I&#39;m here to &#39;tiki&#39; home that Golden Mask. And you&#39;re all grasping at straws.&#34;

After Tiki&#39;s performance, he danced around, with Jenny noting that he was &#34;very agile.&#34; Robin predicted that everyone would know Tiki when he was unmasked. He noticed he was walking in platform heels and effortlessly singing and moving, and guessed that he was a &#34;legend, icon, rock vocalist.&#34; Another clue was revealed about him which was one of the Men in Black playing Elton&#39;s song, &#34;I Guess That&#39;s Why They Call It the Blues,&#34; on the piano. Tiki explained, &#34;If you&#39;re ever feeling bluesy, you can come to me for a good laugh!&#34; He then laughed heartily.

 Tiki&#39;s Harry Potter Night Performances &amp; Clues 

 

For Tiki&#39;s first Harry Potter Night performance, he sang an enchanting rendition of &#34;Magic&#34; by Pilot. He began his clue package by saying, &#34;Making my debut last week was just &#39;beachy.&#39; And now, getting to perform again on Harry Potter Night feels pretty fitting &#39;cause I&#39;ve really found the magic in my life these days.&#34;

The camera then zoomed into an empty restaurant and bar, in which Tiki was snoring while sleeping on a staircase. He went on to say, &#34;There comes a time in every rockin&#39; tropical cocktail&#39;s life where they need to decide what comes next.&#34; He was then startled awake by a loud rock guitar chord, letting out a little &#34;oh.&#34; Tiki continued, &#34;Do you let yourself get watered down?&#34; He played some notes on a piano, and then said, &#34;Or do you change with the tides?&#34;




From behind the bar, Tiki shared, &#34;I decided to put the hard-partying lifestyle on the backburner. And my family on &#39;tap.&#39;&#34; Tiki then walked over to a garbage pail that had a clock in it. The clock&#39;s hands turned from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. He said, &#34;I used to be up every night partying until 6 a.m. Now that&#39;s what time my alarm goes off to take my kid to school.&#34; He looked out the window and waved, as a yellow school bus drove away. Tiki continued, &#34;It makes me emotional just thinking about it.&#34; A yellow box of tissues with a sad face on it was then shown.

Tiki then said, &#34;I definitely don&#39;t want tonight to be my last call, so when I get out on stage, you&#39;re gonna see that this tiki is still on the rocks!&#34; Tiki was shown making five tiki drinks, four with purple flowers and one with a blue one. They seemed to represent a group with a lead singer.

When Tiki finished his performance, another clue about him was revealed. The Harry Potter Sorting Hat sorted Tiki into Gryffindor, saying, &#34;Brave at heart, daring. Better be ... Gryffindor!&#34; Tiki explained his Gryffindor connection saying, &#34;You gotta be brave to be front and center of the types of stages I command.&#34; Later in the night, Tiki went into the Smackdown with Hawk, during which they both sang &#34;Monster&#34; by Lady Gaga. Tiki made it to the Group B final, while Hawk was unmasked and revealed to be Tyler Posey.




                  The Masked Singer Season 10: Every Celebrity Reveal   The Masked Singer season 10 had 17 incredible reveals. Here&#39;s every celebrity who was unmasked in the mystery singing competition&#39;s milestone season.    



 Tiki&#39;s &#34;I Wanna Rock&#34; Night (Group B Finals) Performances &amp; Clues 

 

For his first performance on The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s &#34;I Wanna Rock&#34; Night, Tiki sang an impressive version of &#34;I Was Made for Lovin&#39; You&#34; by Kiss. He began his clue package by saying, &#34;Making it into the Group B finals after chugging my competition in the Smackdown feels amazing. Especially since it&#39;s Rock Night, my jam, baby!&#34;

Tiki was then asked how he found out that he could sing. He replied, &#34;When I was a kid, my buddy asked me to join the choir. He told me if I got in, I&#39;d get a three buck stipend every month.&#34; Tiki then picked up a cowboy hat. A poster of the rock band Kiss was shown as he said, &#34;I said, &#39;What&#39;s a stipend?&#39; But I knew three bucks meant two more Kiss posters, so I auditioned, and, because I had a super high-pitched voice, I was made lead soprano.&#34; At that point, a green alien who was holding his microphone was shown.




Tiki continued, &#34;At eight years old, I hit the road, singing at churches all over. Who&#39;d a thunk I&#39;d be touring the rest of my life. So, just goes to show, never pass up an opportunity, &#39;cause you never know what it&#39;ll lead you to. And now, finale, hear I come!&#34; After Tiki&#39;s performance, Kelly Osbourne, who was The Masked Singer season 2&#39;s Ladybug, brought out another clue. The clue was a blue electric guitar with the word, &#34;JAPAN,&#34; printed on it. Tiki explained, &#34;I had the greatest time in Japan. I actually ran into Nicole Scherzinger there.&#34;

Nicole connected that clue to a show she did with the Pussycat Dolls in Japan in 2006. Kiss headlined, but other artists were there as well, including Sebastian Bach. She mentioned that she even thought that The Masked Singer season 9&#39;s Doll was Sebastian, and maybe she&#39;d manifested it. Doll was actually Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider.

After Husky was unmasked and revealed to be Ginuwine, Tiki and Sea Queen went head-to-head in the Battle Royale singing &#34;Nothin&#39; But A Good Time,&#34; by Poison. They both rocked the stage, but Sea Queen won the Battle, so Tiki was unmasked.

 Tikiâ€™s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists 
          

The Masked Singer panelists had some very varied guesses for Tiki&#39;s identity. Jenny thought that maybe he could be a comedian who knows how to sing. She mentioned that there are many comedic Broadway people who can sing beautifully. She wondered if maybe Tiki was an actor known for singing, a rocker who made everyone laugh, and someone who&#39;s been on Broadway, and guessed John Stamos. She also pointed out that John has toured with the Beach Boys, which is reflected in the Tiki costume.

However, Nicole felt that Tiki was a singer. She guessed David Lee Roth, the former lead singer of Van Halen. She referenced their videos with their tongue-in-cheek energy. Robin thought that the vocals were screaming &#34;rock god legend.&#34; He used the snoozed alarm clock to guess Led Zeppelin&#39;s Robert Plant, whose solo album was titled, Dreamland.




After Tiki&#39;s Harry Potter Night performance, Nicole gushed that his vocal was so powerful that she felt as though Freddie Mercury had come back. Robin added that his voice is so iconic and so legendary, and doesn&#39;t sound like anybody else. He said that they should know who it is. Ken guessed first, saying that he&#39;s Dave Grohl, lead singer of the Foo Fighters, but Jenny disagreed. Nicole thought Tiki might be Jon Bon Jovi, while Robin mentioned Roger Daltrey of The Who. However, he didn&#39;t think Tiki had Roger&#39;s voice. Instead, he said that he thought vocally, Tiki was closer to his original guess of Robert Plant.

On &#34;I Wanna Rock Night,&#34; the panelists made their final guesses for Tiki&#39;s identity. Ken guessed Jon Bon Jovi, while Jenny thought he was Adam Lambert. Robin theorized that Tiki might be Jane&#39;s Addiction frontman, Perry Farrell. However, Nicole was the only panelist who correctly guessed that Tiki was Sebastian Bach.

                  The Masked Singer: Husky Identity &amp; Clues   The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Husky was one of 16 contestants competing on this milestone season. Find out how the clues revealed his true identity.    






 Tiki&#39;s Identity Is Revealed 

 

Tiki was revealed to be hard rock singer and Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach. Sebastian has also acted on television, film, and Broadway. From his height to his iconic voice, Sebastian&#39;s identity was obvious to his fans. However, there were several clues that proved that Tiki was the legendary singer.

Tiki&#39;s first clue package referenced the fact that he was in a rock band, but got himself into trouble. Sebastian was a controversial figure, and even was fired from Skid Row in 1996 due to disagreements about music with his fellow bandmate, Rachel Bolan. The clue that said that Tiki stepped out on his own referred to Sebastian&#39;s solo career. The monkey was a clue to Skid Row&#39;s song &#34;Monkey Business.&#34;

Tiki&#39;s Harry Potter Night clues revealed that he&#39;d put his rockstar lifestyle on the backburner in order to focus on his family. He explained that he now takes his child to school at the time he used to go to bed after partying all night. Sebastian has three children--Paris (1988), London (1994), and Sebastiana (2007). He was most likely referring to taking 16-year-old Sebastiana to school. Tiki also mentioned that people have to be brave to command the stages that he has. This was most likely a clue that Sebastian has not only been on rock stages, but also Broadway when he starred in Jekyll &amp; Hyde and The Rocky Horror Show.




On &#34;I Wanna Rock&#34; Night, Tiki revealed that he found out he could sing when he joined a church choir when he was eight years old, which is exactly what happened to Sebastian. The cowboy hat was a clue that Sebastian won Gone Country season 2. Gone Country was a reality singing competition show in which celebrities competed to be a country music singer. The alien referred to the fictional band Hep Alien from Gilmore Girls, in which Sebastian played guitar when he guest starred on the show as Gil. The Nicole Scherzinger clue referred to the 2006 Udo Rock Festival in Japan, in which Sebastian performed, along with Kiss and the Pussycat Dolls.

From Sebastian&#39;s first performance as Tiki on The Masked Singer Elton John Night, he proved that he&#39;s a true star. He continued to mix things up on Harry Potter Night, and packed a punch during &#34;I Wanna Rock&#34; Night, when he was completely in his element. It&#39;s always exciting to see artists of different genres perform on the show. Sebastian&#39;s unmasked performance of Skid Row&#39;s &#34;Youth Gone Wild&#34; was totally epic. The iconic Sebastian will always be remembered as a Masked Singer rock legend.




The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.
