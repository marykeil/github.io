1000-lb Sisters star Amy Slaton may have just finalized her messy divorce with ex-husband Michael Halterman, but she&#39;s not waiting for love to come and find her after sharing photos with the new love in her life. Amy, the younger sister of 1000-lb Sisters co-star Tammy Slaton, has had several tumultuous years in a row. After having weight loss surgery and improving her overall health, Amy got pregnant with her older son Gage. She and Michael welcomed their first son, then quickly got pregnant for a second time, welcoming their second son Glenn in 2022. After Glenn&#39;s birth, Amy and Michael&#39;s dynamic changed entirely as Michael stopped helping his wife.




After difficulties that left them at an impasse, Amy and Michael chose to divorce. The end of their relationship will be covered on 1000-lb Sisters season 5, but Amy&#39;s already keeping her followers updated with photos of her new boyfriend, which she shared recently on TikTok. Amy debuted her boyfriend, Tony Rodgers, in a TikTok featuring several photos of the pair that appear to span over several months. While she didn&#39;t share many details about the relationship, the photos reveal that Tony has already met Amy&#39;s sons. Tony, Glenn, and Gage already seem to have bonded, with Tony looking happy in candid photos with the boys. As for Amy, the photos of her and Tony show a different side of the 1000-lb Sisters star. She seems happy, confident, and excited by her new relationship.

Throughout 1000-lb Sisters season 4, viewers watched Amy and Michael struggle in their marriage after welcoming a second child. While Michael and Amy were excited about their first pregnancy, the second was a surprise. While both were excited about another baby, it was clear that they hadn&#39;t adjusted to having one child yet and another would be overwhelming. With Amy dealing with her own problems on top of everything going on with her sister Tammy&#39;s health, which was at an all-time low, things were hard on the marriage. Michael and Amy began to fight, and Michael didn&#39;t have much involvement in her pregnancy or Gage&#39;s life.


 

While Amy and Michael struggled, they continued to try and prioritize their relationship as best they could. The couple tried to make things work, but after some bitter fights previewed in the 1000-lb Sisters season 5 trailer, things became impossible to manage. Michael and Amy decided to get a divorce after many long years together and nearly five years married. While Amy was heartbroken over her marriage falling apart, she was determined to stay strong for her sons. Putting her life back into perspective, Amy worked on her health, shedding some weight and keeping her followers updated on social media. The love in her life is an exciting, well-deserved development.




With Amy moving on after a difficult time in her love life, seeing her happy with Tony is a huge development for her friends, family, and followers. Knowing that Amy feels comfortable enough in her relationship to share Tony on social media is huge, especially seeing he&#39;s been spending time with her family and taking care of her sons. While more will be revealed when 1000-lb Sisters season 5 premieres, the fact that she&#39;s happy in her new relationship with Tony is already an exciting new piece of her brand-new life as an independent woman.
