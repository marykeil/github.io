## Literature Review
The Brothers Sun has assembled a fantastic cast led by the Oscar-winning Michelle Yeoh. We break down the cast details, who the actors play &amp; more.




The Brothers Sun debuted on Netflix with a fantastic cast led by Michelle Yeoh. The drama-comedy follows a Taiwanese Triad family who must unite after patriarch Big Sun is shot by an assassin. Yeoh is an Oscar-winning actress whose film resume is quite impressive and has covered most genres.

The Brothers Sun is one of the first series to hit Netflix this year, and it’s already received a positive reception from critics and audiences alike. The cast not only has to act, but they must fight their way through action scenes, and the actors assembled are more than up to the task. Yeoh herself has a long history of starring in martial arts movies, so The Brothers Sun is right up her alley.
