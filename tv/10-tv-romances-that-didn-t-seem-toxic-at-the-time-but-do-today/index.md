## Literature Review

Even though these TV couples were very popular at the time, looking at their relationships years later reveals that they had some toxic elements. 




Social attitudes toward relationships are constantly shifting, so some TV romances which used to seem harmless can often appear to be toxic in retrospect. Plenty of long-running shows depend on complicated romances to keep things fresh. Simple, wholesome relationships often aren&#39;t as interesting to watch as those with a little bit of drama. However, there can be a fine line between routine drama and toxic behavior, especially considering how relationships from many years ago can look different today. Relationships from diffferent eras play by a different set of rules, and the definition of acceptable behavior can change.
Judging old relationships by modern standards can be tricky, because the context in which the characters lived is imoprtant to how they act. Some behaviors and attitudes are just a product of the times, but others should be seen as unacceptable no matter what. Some of the most common toxic relationship behaviors include lying, jealousy, and being controlling. All of these have been used in TV shows to generate tension between couples, but if they are misused then they can paint the relationships in a troubling light, and they can end up looking problematic when viewed through a modern lens.









 








 10  Ross &amp; Rachel 
Friends


 







Ross and Rachel&#39;s relationship on Friends is the most famous example of a sitcom on-again-off-again relationship. They always shared feelings for one another, but some of their biggest relationship milestones happened completely by accident. Even after an unplanned pregnancy, a drunken marriage in Las Vegas, and a delayed divorce, the couple eventually ended up together in the Friends series finale. Because of their constant fighting, their happiness at the end of Friends could well be fleeting. It&#39;s not difficult to imagine Ross&#39; jealousy causing problems in the future, especially after Rachel gave up her dream job for him.





 9  Homer &amp; Marge 
The Simpsons
        

Homer and Marge&#39;s marriage is complicated. She makes him a better person, but he still makes some unforgivable errors. Homer is largely inattentive to Marge&#39;s needs. He buys her a bowling ball for her birthday, despite her having no interest in bowling, and he lies to her about getting rid of his gun. Perhaps his worst sin is teaching a class about marriage to the entire town which devolves into airing all of her secrets. Homer tends to find a way to gain forgiveness, but it&#39;s no surprise that some versions of the future timeline have them living separately.

 8  Carrie &amp; Aidan 
Sex and the City
        

Aidan seems like a better fit for Carrie than Big, but he also has some major red flags. Aidan tries to give Carrie an ultimatum about her smoking habit, he wants to believe she has never had an abortion, and he proposes to her when she tells him she isn&#39;t ready. All of this shows that Aidan wants to preserve a certain image of Carrie, rather than loving her for who she is. Carrie isn&#39;t blameless in their relationship either, as she repeatedly goes back to Big when things get serious. And Just Like That could bring them together after all.





 7  Rory &amp; Dean 
Gilmore Girls
        

Dean is Rory&#39;s first real boyfriend in Gilmore Girls, and he&#39;s a much better fit for her than some of her love interests, like Logan or Jess. A lot of their issues can be chalked up to the fact that neither one of them has much relationship experience, and a lot of high school romances are messy to some extent. But Dean has a bad habit of getting upset whenever Rory is too busy to spend time with him. Dean is too demanding of Rory, even trying to pressure her into saying &#34;I love you&#34; before she feels ready.





 6  Meredith &amp; Derek 
Grey&#39;s Anatomy
        

Even at the time, Meredith and Derek&#39;s relationship was riddled with problems, but this made some fans root for them even more. In retrospect, their relationship is even more toxic. Derek never treated Meredith with respect when they weren&#39;t together, even going so far as to try and shame her for her sexual freedom. Their relationship was marked by consistent deceit and communication problems, although they did mostly work things out in the end. Derek learned to fully commit to their relationship, and Meredith grew to understand Derek more and respect his boundaries.





 5  Leonard &amp; Penny 
The Big Bang Theory
        

Leonard and Penny embody the &#34;opposites attract&#34; trope which many TV shows use. When they first meet, he is a socially awkward genius, and she is a ditzy bombshell. He obsesses over her instantly, even if she doesn&#39;t pay much attention to him, but their proximity as neighbors means they have plenty of opportunities to interact. Opposites attract relationships can be a good thing. Ideally, the partners complement each other&#39;s personalities, and they can each grow and learn from each other. However, Leonard and Penny&#39;s relationship had them both feeling inferior and insecure at times.





 4  Ted &amp; Robin 
How I Met Your Mother


 







The controversial ending of How I Met Your Mother finally revealed how Ted met his future wife, but then he ended up with Robin anyway. Ultimately, they were much better as friends. How I Met Your Mother shows Ted&#39;s flaws as a romantic partner, and he is too possessive of Robin when they are together. He also gets in the way of her happiness at times, especially when he confesses his love for her just before she is set to marry Barney. This could be seen as a last-ditch romantic gesture, but he doesn&#39;t take her feelings into account.





 3  Finn &amp; Rachel 
Glee
        

Rachel pines after Finn for a long time on Glee, using the glee club as a way of spending more time with him. She always sees him as a status symbol that might elevate her social standing in school. However, once they get together, Rachel becomes jealous. Finn&#39;s reputation suddenly becomes a threat to her, although she does gradually mature. Finn also struggles to deal with the shift in their relationship dynamic once they become serious. He sees himself being left behind, because Rachel is much more assertive and driven when it comes to getting what she wants from life.

 2  Schmidt &amp; Cece 
New Girl
        

Schmidt makes a few racially insensitive comments to and about Cece, but he mostly fixes this behavior as the show progresses, and he becomes less obnoxious. However, this isn&#39;t even the worst offense Schmidt commits. He deceives Cece and secretly continues his relationship with Elizabeth behind her back. She breaks up with him, but ultimately takes him back and ends up marrying him. Schmidt grows a lot through his relationship with Cece, but it shouldn&#39;t be her responsibility to nurture him. He also tries to undermine her happiness when the two are apart, like when she dates Robbie.





 1  Eric &amp; Donna 
&#39;That 70s Show


 







Eric and Donna do eventually get back together for good, but their relationship is far from plain sailing. Eric is extremely possessive of his first love, pressuring her into committing to their relationship in ways that make her feel uncomfortable. They are only teenagers, but Eric tries to give her a promise ring that acts as a placeholder for an engagement ring. Donna clearly needs more time to figure things out. The spinoff, &#39;That 90s Show, reveals Eric and Donna stayed together and had a daughter, so hopefully they have gained a better mutual understanding.
