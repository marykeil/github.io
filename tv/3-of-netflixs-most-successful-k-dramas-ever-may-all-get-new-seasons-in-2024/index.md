## Literature Review
Three of Netflix’s biggest Korean shows are getting new seasons in the near future, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they all premiered in 2024.




Three of Netflix’s biggest Korean shows may premiere new seasons in 2024, which is set to be a big year for K-dramas on the platform. From love stories to action-thrillers, the best Korean shows on Netflix are also some of the streamer’s most popular titles. The list of most exciting K-dramas releasing in 2024 includes a lot of Netflix productions, three of which performed very well on the platform and have been renewed for second or third seasons.




Recently, Netflix has either produced or distributed a lot of great K-dramas. This includes binge-worthy shows whose seasons are released all at once, such as Squid Game or All of Us Are Dead, but also weekly releases like Crash Landing on You or My Demon. Although the weekly-released series usually don’t return for a new season and instead end with 16 episodes, original shows like Sweet Home leave the door open for sequels.


 Sweet Home 3, Squid Game 2, &amp; All Of Us Are Dead 2 Could All Premier In 2024 
     

Sweet Home season 3 will premiere in 2024, as revealed in the ending credits of season 2. The show was renewed for two additional seasons following the massive success of season 1 in 2020, although it took quite a while for the show to return. Now, instead of the three-year wait for season 2, the third season will premiere in less than a year. The exact release date for Sweet Home season 3 remains to be announced, but a trailer or a first look at the show’s third chapter should be released in the following months.



 

Squid Game, one of Netflix’s biggest shows of all time whose impact on pop culture is still felt more than two years later, was renewed for season 2 in June 2022. The release date for Squid Game season 2 has not been announced yet, but a solid prediction is that the series will premiere at some point in late 2024. An official season 2 teaser revealing Sweet Home’s new cast has already been released. Lastly, All of Us Are Dead, one of Netflix’s most-watched Korean dramas, is also getting a new season, most likely in late 2024 or early 2025.



 Netflix’s Biggest Upcoming K-Dramas All Face The Same Challenge 
          



Even if they do not all come out in 2024, three of Netflix’s biggest non-English language shows will premier new seasons relatively close to each other. Interestingly, Sweet Home 3, Squid Game 2, and All of Us Are Dead 2 all face the same challenge – how to recapture the magic of their original seasons now that so much about the shows’ status quos have been changed. For example, the Green Home building was destroyed at the end of Sweet Home season 1, which is why season 2 expanded the scope of the story and introduced multiple new characters. Similarly, most Squid Game characters died in season 1.


 

All of Us Are Dead will also have to reinvent itself, as the show’s premise of a zombie outbreak inside a school cannot be replicated now that the school in question has been destroyed, and the characters are all living in a quarantine zone. The original seasons of Sweet Home, All of Us Are Dead, and Squid Game could all have worked as standalone K-dramas, but their successes meant that they would have to continue. Sweet Home struggled with continuing the story beyond the first season, and it will be interesting to see how the upcoming second seasons of Squid Game and All of Us Are Dead will fare in this aspect.
