## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé’s Michael Ilesanmi may not be as loud and rude as Angela Deem, but he has also done some terrible things, which no husband should.




Michael Ilesanmi from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise ruined his reputation with his behavior over the years. The 35-year-old Nigerian native made his reality TV debut on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 2 in 2018 alongside Georgia native Angela Deem. Michael had a sweet relationship with Angela when they first appeared on the show. However, their dynamic changed after they tied the knot and decided to settle together. While Angela became more dominant and controlling as a wife, Michael became shady and untrustworthy.




Like most 90 Day Fiancé duos, Michael and Angela faced cultural and personal differences. However, it wasn’t until Angela underwent weight-loss surgery that she became a completely different person. After her procedure, Angela became more disrespectful towards Michael, pushing him to make terrible choices. In 2022, Angela caught Michael having an affair with another woman online. The pair butted heads during the Tell All before joining 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 to seek therapy. Angela brought divorce papers with her but tore them up as she reconciled with Michael again.

 Michael Ilesanmi Clearly Took Advantage Of Angela Deem 
         




There is some suggestion that Angela is the main villain in her relationship. She not only verbally tortured Michael, but she also hurt him emotionally. However, she doesn’t deserve all the blame for the ups and downs in their relationship. Like Angela, Michael is equally responsible for ruining his marriage and creating issues. He has been accused of using his Angela for social media clout, money, and a better life. During 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, Angela revealed she sends her husband money every month.

Michael has shown a clear desire to utilize his relationship with Angela to his benefit. Last year, he demanded that she let him create an Instagram account so he could make extra income. He even asked Angela to send more money and blackmailed her. Michael had wanted to come to the U.S. for a long time. He knows the cultural, geographical, and age gap but isn’t ending his relationship with Angela, likely because of ulterior motives. It has been speculated that the two cast members use each other to appear in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise.






 Michael Ilesanmi Cheated On Angela 
         

Over the seasons, Michael has done some terrible things that wrecked his marriage with Angela. The drama began in 2019 when the Nigerian reality star became intimate with another woman. As a married man, Michael had no reason to seek physical intimacy from another person. He did it knowingly and even tried to make others feel sorry for him. At the time, Michael agreed to his mistake and admitted he “did the BJ thing.” However, Angela didn’t trust him and continued to doubt him for a long time.

Angela has always shown a lack of trust in Michael as he has a shady personality. Despite his past cheating scandal, he never learned how to be a good husband. Instead, he kept sneaking behind Angela’s back and got caught. In 2022, once again, Michael tried to ease Angela’s pain by letting her know it was “just a plaything.” However, she was over his nasty behavior and obtained evidence of his infidelity. One of Michael’s messages to the other American woman read, “let me come to the States, and I’ll come to you.”




                  90 Day Fiancé: Angela Deem &amp; Michael Ilesanmi’s 5 Biggest Scandals   90 Day Fiancé franchise star Angela Deem is a true villain who often mistreats Michael Ilseanmi. They&#39;ve had some major scandals over the years.     



 Michael Ilesanmi Tried To Chase Clout (&amp; New Women) 
         

Before the cheating scandal in 2022, Michael tried to blackmail Angela into letting him keep his Instagram account so he could cash in on his reality TV fame. He claimed he wanted to make extra income and gave her an ultimatum. As expected, Angela knew her husband was up to no good. She refused his demands and asked him about the money she normally sends him for groceries and other bills. Michael claimed he needed more money and demanded she give him $5000. He played on Angela’s insecurities and promised to delete his Instagram so other women couldn’t message him.




Regardless of what Angela had done, it wouldn’t have stopped Michael from being shady. As viewers may know, Michael tried to pursue the other American woman strategically. He used his secret account to message her and tried to lure her into his trap until he got caught. During the Tell All, Michael admitted that he wrote the messages to another woman but “never meant it.” He said, “I would never leave my wife for anything.” However, Angela knew better than to trust him again. She replied, “you’re not sorry, Michael. You’re sorry you got caught.” If Michael had a little shame, he would’ve left Angela alone after the incident, but he didn’t.



 Michael Ilesanmi Didn’t Support Angela’s Body Transformation 

 

Ideally, husbands should help their wives overcome their insecurities. However, Michael never supported Angela&#39;s weight loss from the beginning. A few years ago, the 90 Day Fiancé franchise alum opted for a bariatric procedure to reduce her weight so she could lead a healthy life. She also decided to get breast reduction surgery so she could breathe better. However, Michael got so anxious about Angela losing her breast size that he bluntly refused to support her. When Angela’s doctor revealed her new breast size, Michael simply couldn’t hold his thoughts and said, “I don’t think this is big.”




Only a terrible person overlooks his partner’s health for their own selfish reasons. Michael proved he wasn’t a good partner to Angela when he chose her physical attributes over her inner beauty. In 2021, Michael changed his statement and suggested his lack of support for Angela’s transformation was something else. He said, “people have lost their life getting this kind of surgery here in Nigeria.” The 90 Day Fiancé franchise alum stated that he was afraid that Angela was risking it all, implying that he didn’t want to lose her if there were complications.
