  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Clayton humiliates Anali by joking about their lack of sex life in front of their friends, making her feel uncomfortable and disrespected.   Anali realizes Clayton&rsquo;s need to appear macho in front of his friends, which bothers her and raises questions about their compatibility.   Clayton&rsquo;s actions may push Anali to consider leaving their relationship, especially since she already felt uneasy about Clayton&rsquo;s lack of friends.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Clayton Clark is out to impress his best friend Kameron by insulting his wife-to-be Anali Vallejos in the most hurtful way possible.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Clayton Clark has shown his dark side to Anali Vallejos by humiliating her in the worst way possible in season 10. Lexington, Kentucky resident Clayton debuted as a reality TV star with Anali from Chiclayo, Peru after they applied for their K-1 visa. Clayton, 29, met the 26-year-old Anali on a language learning app. Anali was learning English and Clayton was learning Spanish when she found his profile and visited it. The couple started talking to each other via text messages in Spanish. Eight months later, Clayton was in Peru to meet Anali in person.</p>
<p>Clayton liked Anali so much that he proposed to her on the fourth day of his trip. Anali gave him a halfhearted yes, but convinced him enough that he applied for a K-1 visa. Anali might have been unsure about accepting Clayton’s proposal because she’d not told her dad about him. Anali was also aware that Clayton had his mom, Violet, living in his closet. However, once Anali came to the U.S. she saw how Violet’s closet was barely 10 feet away from Clayton’s bed. Anali refused to show any interest in having sex with Clayton. Instead of asking her why, Clayton decided to ridicule Anali.</p>

<p>Clayton Made Anali Feel Like A Third-Wheel</p>
<p>Clayton has been playing video games since he was a teenager. Clayton had a friend named Kameron he’d met while playing the game several years ago. However, Clayton had never met Kameron in person. Anali, being a sociable person, craved company and wished to go out and make friends, while she was going to marry a man who only had “online friends” and kept working from home or playing on his computer in his room all day long. It was Anali who suggested Clayton should finally meet Kameron in the real world, which would also allow her to get some “alone time” with her husband away from his closet-dwelling mother.</p>
<p>Clayton said he had known “half” his life. He said he got along with Kameron better than any of his friends ever. He was excited about hanging out with him in person. It took Clayton and Anali seven hours to fly to San Diego. Kameron said he felt “weird” to have such a close friend who he’d never seen in person. He knew he was in for a shock, but he was also ecstatic to be meeting Clayton in the flesh for the first time. Anali noticed that Clayton was happier to see Clayton for the first time than he was to see Anali for the first time in Peru.</p>
<p>Clayton told the cameras that it was “almost like” meeting Anali again. Anali complained that Clayton had not run the same way as seeing her when Clayton saw her the first time. Clayton joked he had a “bromance” going on with Kameron. Clayton and Kameron spent a lot of time greeting each other while Anali stood by the side waiting for her fiancé to introduce her to his best friend. Clayton told Anali he wanted to “translate” the connection he had with Kameron online into a real-life connection. Anali said that she knew it was important to her, and it made her happy as well.</p>
<p>Clayton Joked About Him Being A &lsquo;Virgin&rsquo; Because Of Anali</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Clayton called Anali a “third wheel.” Clayton and Anali met Kameron and his girlfriend Vy for dinner and drinks that night. Clayton had splurged on a “proper house” to get some privacy. Anali admitted that being in San Diego felt like she was living a different life. The house was spacious and not messy at all. She realized that she liked having this kind of space together. She was finally alone with Clayton and felt good about it. It seemed as if Anali was finally ready to explore intimacy with Clayton again because she felt comfortable in the space they were now living in, even if it was briefly.</p>
<p>However, Clayton foiled his own plan by what he did next during his dinner outing with Kameron. Clayton said that it was a “big deal” for him as he didn’t socialize much in real life. He wanted the conversation between him and Kameron to be easy and as natural as it had been online the whole time. When Kameron and Vy arrived, Clayton asked Kameron to be his best man, because he had no other choice and Kameron was his only friend. Kameron was excited about being his best man and gave him “full consent.” When a waitress decided to visit their table to take their orders, Clayton ordered a margarita flight.</p>
<p>Clayton said that he wanted it to be “virgin” since he didn’t drink. “I gotta get the virgin because I’m effectively living as a virgin because we haven’t been having any sex recently,” Clayton announced to the table, as Kameron and Vy laughed along with the server before an awkward silence fell on the table.</p>
<p>Clayton may have thought Anali wouldn’t understand what he said in English, but she did as her eyes immediately welled up with tears. She gave a death stare to Clayton, which Kameron noticed. Kameron joked that Anali’s eyes were telling Clayton to “shut up.” However, Clayton continued to poke fun at her as he asked, “What’s she gonna do? Not have sex with me?”</p>
<p>Clayton Planned The Double Date To Humiliate Anali</p>
<p>Kameron asked Clayton if it was an ongoing issue. Clayton told him that the “streak” was running long. Kameron said that the “dry streak” was a bad thing for Clayton. In their separate conversation with the producers, Kameron said that it had been “a while” since he had heard about someone’s sex life in such detail, especially the “frequency,” while Vy said her only feeling about the sensitive conversation was “Yike.” Vy could sense how uncomfortable Anali was feeling because of Clayton and asked him if he had ever bothered to find out the reason why Anali was not “ready.”</p>
<p>Anali used the translator app to convey her feelings. She made Clayton read out what she said out loud. She said that the main reason was that Clayton’s mother lived with them. She said the apartment was very small and one could hear everything that was happening in the house. Clayton claimed that Anali was lying by giving a “scientific” explanation. He spoke about them going on a romantic getaway to Indiana where his mom wasn’t with them. “I can tell you it&rsquo;s uncomfortable for you, the topic,” Kameron asked Anali. It was then that Anali told Clayton it was a private matter between them not to be shared with others.</p>
<p>During her confessional, Anali told the cameras that she felt uncomfortable when Clayton started talking about the subject at the table. She said it was “disrespectful” even more because she was sitting right beside him at the table. Anali quietly wiped away her tears. She asked herself if the purpose of the double date was for them to have a good time or just to “criticize” her.</p>
<p>Clayton Wanted To Feel Macho In Front Of His Friend</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Anali realized that Clayton wanted to act “macho” in front of his friends just to boost his ego. She said that his friends would realize how Clayton is a “kitten” if they were at his house instead. Seeing this side of Clayton bothered her. Anali decided to leave the dinner table and head home. If Anali was finally feeling comfortable about getting physical with Clayton that night, he was the one who ruined his only chance by doing what he did. Anali, who was anyway bothered by Clayton not having friends, might just choose to leave Clayton after what he did this time.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
