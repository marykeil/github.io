  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Jackie Chan is one of the most recognizable martial arts stars in the world and throughout his career he&rsquo;s had several frequent collaborators.</p>
<p>Jackie Chan was the most recognizable Hong Kong actor of all time and throughout his filmography, which included appearances in more than 150 movies, he has frequently collaborated with many of the same actors. A major reason for this was that the studio Golden Harvest, who played a major role in introducing Hong Kong action movies to the world, often relied on the same pool of actors that included Chan. This meant, Chan was often cast opposite the same performers, in particular his close collaborators Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung, who collectively became known as the Three Dragons.
However, there have also been a number of other notable stars that Chan has worked with regularly, including the Academy Award-winning actress Michaelle Yeoh with whom Chan has made several movies. A lot of Chan’s frequent collaborators also stem from his time working as a stuntman in uncredited roles. It was in this capacity that Chan first crossed paths with legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, and they appeared in several movies together. There were plenty of frequent co-stars that Chan made a number of films with in the action, drama, and kung fu genres.</p>
