## Literature Review
Quantum Leap season 2&#39;s midseason premiere and two-part finale dates have been revealed, and, like everything with Quantum Leap, there is a big twist.




Quantum Leap is finally back, but there have been some changes to the show&#39;s schedule. A follow-up to the original 1989 show, the new series follows Dr. Ben Song (Raymond Lee), as he leaps across time and space and finds danger in every new location. Song&#39;s mission is to eventually return to the present time, where he hopes to stay, but his efforts are constantly in vain.




While the wait continues for a Quantum Leap season 3 announcement, word on the release dates for the mid-season premiere and the season finale has finally arrived. TV Insider reports that season 2 will return on January 30, while the finale will air on February 20. In a twist, the show will also be moving from its regular Wednesday slot into the Tuesday time slot at 10pm Eastern. The two-hour finale, specifically, will begin at 9pm Eastern.


 The Future Of Quantum Leap 
          

It&#39;s hard to say where Ben&#39;s future will take him, considering that his leaps are rarely straightforward. Throughout Ben&#39;s many leaps, he has been at odds with individuals from across time, and any upcoming seasons will be sure to see him journeying across reality once again. Because of the importance of time travel to the show, it&#39;s unlikely that he will be able to fully resolve his leaps at the end of season 2. A resolution will likely have to come in the series finale, rather than a season finale.

Unfortunately, the show has not yet been approved for season 3. NBC is likely waiting until the season is over to consider whether the ratings support another season. Season 2 was ordered three months after the season 1 premiere, and a similar timeline is possible with the second-half of this season. Because of that, its future is in flux, as executives and producers wait to see how the show does now that the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes are no longer affecting promotion.



Quantum Leap is available for streaming through NBC or Peacock.




Raymond Lee&#39;s version of Quantum Leap has taken unprecedented steps to drive the show&#39;s narrative forward. Season 2 has seen him connect with someone who can see through his leaps to the man beneath his borrowed form. It&#39;s a sign that the show is always ready to reconsider its fundamentals. Regardless of what happens, Quantum Leap season 2, part 2 is sure to change everything about Ben&#39;s life.
