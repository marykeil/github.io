# Gen V Teased A Terrible Compound V Side Effect The Boys Hasn t Discussed


## SUMMARY 



  Gen V&#39;s season 1 finale reveals that Compound V can have unexpected negative effects, potentially dooming supes in the long run.   Polarity&#39;s medical condition hints at wider issues: Polarity, a retired supe in Gen V, suffers from seizures and brain damage from his magnetic powers. This suggests that other supes may also face similar medical problems as they age.   The introduction of V24, a temporary superpower drug in The Boys&#39; season 3, raises the possibility that the harmful effects of Compound V, like seizures, could be more common than previously thought.

## Literature Review
Compound V has a terrible new side-effect that The Boys never mentioned. Gen V introduces the symptom and addresses its implications.




Gen V season 1 has set up a terrible truth about Compound V that has not yet been discussed in The Boys, and it could have massive implications for all supes. As the franchise&#39;s primary source of superpowers, Vought&#39;s miracle drug has a lot to answer for. The Boys&#39; Compound V is already known to be dangerous, especially when administered to adults, but in Gen V season 1&#39;s finale, &#34;Guardians of Godolkin,&#34; a shock reveal confirms a superpower isn&#39;t the only thing Compound V can give a recipient.




In the world of Gen V, parents consent to Vought International injecting their young children with Compound V. The hope is that their offspring then develop superhuman abilities when they reach a certain age. Although the goal is for the young Supes to become stars, Gen V&#39;s season 1 finale reveals that these chosen youngsters may be doomed in an unexpected way.

                  All Seasons Of The Boys &amp; Gen V, Ranked Worst To Best   The Boys universe has produced three seasons of the main series as well as a spinoff show, Gen V. Here is every season ranked from worst to best.    


 Andre&#39;s Father Suffered Brain Damage Because Of Compound V 
          

Andre Anderson has lived his life in the shadow of his Supe father, but Polarity&#39;s powers have come at a price. In Gen V season 1, Polarity suffers a seizure, resulting in his magnetic manipulation abilities going haywire. After Polarity undergoes a medical examination, an exposition-laden doctor explains that by using his powers throughout the decades, Polarity has been doing irreparable damage to his neural pathways. There is even an implication that Polarity&#39;s reaction to Compound V could be passed onto his son, with Andre experiencing at least one of the same symptoms as his father.




Gen V avoids digging fully into the ramifications of Polarity&#39;s diagnosis, but the impression given is that Polarity&#39;s seizures are a side effect of his magnetism powers specifically, rather than a broader side effect of the Compound V drug. Nevertheless, Polarity&#39;s condition does open up the possibility that other supes in The Boys will eventually suffer similar medical problems. Although Vought has been pumping V into kids for decades, Polarity is retired in Gen V. As the current supe generation grows older, cases like Polarity&#39;s could become increasingly common.



 Butcher&#39;s The Boys Season 3 Story Already Teased A Larger Problem With Compound V 
          

The Boys season 3 introduced V24, otherwise known as Temp-V, which provides superpowers for a limited period of time. While Butcher and Hughie made full use of Vought&#39;s latest innovation, they later discovered that only a handful of V24 doses would result in irreversible brain injuries. Since V24 is closely modeled on the main Compound V drug, it stands to reason that the side effects would be alike for both. While Polarity&#39;s seizures may have been triggered by his magnetism, therefore, it seems equally plausible that the root cause is actually the Compound V itself.






Vought often sends ill supes to facilities like the Wellness Center, keeping them out of the public eye.




Perhaps the deadly side effects are more common with V24 because the user&#39;s powers disappear, leaving them ordinary and human, whereas a full-time supe never loses their abilities. In the case of a retired supe such as Polarity, who would be using their powers less and less, however, medical drawbacks may be more likely to manifest. By revealing more veteran Compound V users experiencing seizures and brain issues, The Boys season 4 can certainly capitalize on Gen V&#39;s Polarity revelation.
