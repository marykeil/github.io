# Former Doctor Who Showrunner Wants To Develop A British West Wing


## SUMMARY 



  Former Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat wants to create a British version of The West Wing, believing that British politics needs the level of insight provided by the original.   Despite Moffat&#39;s success in the realm of fantasy and detective shows, he lacks experience in purely dramatic productions like The West Wing.   Moffat&#39;s range as a writer and showrunner, demonstrated by his work on various genres, suggests that he may be capable of creating a successful British adaptation of The West Wing.

## Literature Review
Former Doctor Who showrunner and Sherlock creator Steven Moffat hopes to develop a British version of the acclaimed show The West Wing.




Former Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat is interested in developing a British adaptation of the American TV show The West Wing. Developed by Aaron Sorkin, The West Wing was a show that ran from 1999 to 2006 and followed a cast of staffers working for a fictional American president in the White House. Moffat made his name as a writer and showrunner for Doctor Who, before going on to create BBC&#39;s Sherlock.




While Doctor Who prepares for season 14, Moffat is now interested in moving away from science fiction and detectives to develop a more political show. In an interview with the British paper The Sunday Times, Moffat revealed that he would love to develop a British version of The West Wing. He believes that British politics desperately needs the level of insight granted by the original Sorkin drama. Check out his quote below, via Deadline:


We’ve got a problem — we think that being cynical is sophisticated, but that’s how adolescents think. Our cynicism about our politics has resulted in cynical politicians. If you tell a child they’re bad, they become bad. If you tell politicians they’re a bunch of egotistical maniacs, then where is the value in trying to be anything else? I think it might be necessary.



 Is Stephen Moffat The Right Choice For The West Wing? 
          




Despite having a long track record as a popular showrunner and writer, Moffat has never had experience on a show as purely dramatic as The West Wing. Moffat, who is an Officer of the prestigious Order of the British Empire, has a long television career that includes many successful productions. All the same, Moffat has primarily focused on fantastical shows, rather than anything primarily geared toward politics.



The West Wing is available for streaming on Max.




Moffat&#39;s first gained fame with the sitcoms Chalk and Coupling, before signing on to write for Doctor Who during the first Russell T Davies era. He wrote the episodes &#34;The Empty Child&#34; and &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34;, before writing the acclaimed &#34;Blink&#34;, which is often regarded as one of the best in the show&#39;s 60-year history. He also created Sherlock, which became an international hit. His other show, Jekyll, failed to draw much positive notice. After becoming the showrunner of Doctor Who, Moffat would last for several seasons before later developing Dracula and The Time Traveler&#39;s Wife.




                  How Accurate Is The West Wing’s White House?   The West Wing made history with its intricate portrayal of the inner mechanisms of the White House, but the series&#39; reproduction takes some risks.    

By the time Sorkin created The West Wing, he had already written The American President, A Few Good Men, and Sports Night, all of which provided high drama and suspense. Moffat has always relied on ever-escalating stakes, while Sorkin prefers a subtle dramatic touch. That change may not be the perfect fit for Moffat. Still, he has worked across a variety of genres over the years, including comedy, sci-fi, and mysteries, so a British version of The West Wing could prove just how much range Moffat truly has.
