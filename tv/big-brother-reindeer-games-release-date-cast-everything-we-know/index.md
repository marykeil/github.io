## Literature Review
Big Brother is returning to CBS sooner than expected for their special, Reindeer Games. Find out more. 




Big Brother is returning sooner than expected for Reindeer Games. The popular reality competition show premiered nearly two decades ago and has become a cultural phenomenon since. It has produced hundreds of episodes and countless memorable moments. Recently, CBS aired Big Brother season 25 in early August 2023. The newest edition started with a bang as the contestants competed for the $750,000 grand prize. It featured a new time travel twist that made it stand apart from the other seasons.




While Big Brother season 25 is excellent, it isn&#39;t the best the series has produced. Over the last 23 years, the iconic reality TV franchise has dropped a few entertaining seasons that fans still remember. One example is Big Brother season 14, which premiered in 2012. The season was full of iconic moments like Dan Gheesling&#39;s funeral and Willy Hantz&#39;s expulsion. Moreover, the high ratings prove that it is still worth watching. Another memorable season was Big Brother season 4 from 2003, which is still raved about today. However, fans of the hit reality TV series don&#39;t have to wait much longer for a particular installment of the series.
