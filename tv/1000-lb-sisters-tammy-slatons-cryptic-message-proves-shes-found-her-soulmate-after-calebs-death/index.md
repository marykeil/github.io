## Literature Review

Six months after the passing of her husband, Caleb Willingham, 1000-Lb Sisters’ Tammy Slaton seems optimistic about the new changes in her love life.




1000-Lb Sisters cast member Tammy Slaton posted a cryptic message implying she has fallen in love with someone. The 37-year-old Dixon native recently had a short but sweet relationship with her former husband, Caleb Willingham. She met him at a rehab center, where he was also improving his health and saying goodbye to unhealthy habits. Tammy and Caleb’s bond grew stronger with each passing day together. They fell in love and tied the knot after a few months of dating. Unfortunately, their marriage didn’t last forever. Caleb passed away due to health issues after Tammy had moved out of rehab.




Tammy hasn’t posted many love life updates since Caleb’s passing. However, she has recently begun sharing cryptic updates hinting she’s in a new relationship. Most recently, the 1000-Lb Sisters star posted a Facebook photo and a TikTok video with a loving message. Tammy wrote, “Imagine falling in love and it works out for the rest of your life,” and used a song with the lyrics, “I love you.” The post got love from fans who applauded Tammy for moving on. Someone even wrote, “I hope you find who you deserve! Man or woman,” highlighting the recent speculation over Tammy&#39;s sexual orientation.

 How Is Tammy Moving On After Caleb’s Death? 
          




 Like most people who lose their spouse, Tammy was in rough shape after Caleb’s passing. She didn’t post much or stay active on social media. However, things have changed drastically in recent months. Tammy has begun posting new content and sharing cute videos showing herself glowing amid her weight-loss journey. In early January 2024, Tammy stunned her followers when she added a Pride flag to her TikTok bio. She posted a few videos with the trans flag. She later clarified that meant she was an ally and also added she&#39;s a lesbian. Tammy even posted a few romantic duets with nonbinary TikToker Justice Faith, hinting she may be dating them.

It’d be great if Tammy decided to move on from Caleb. While she had a decent relationship with him, he wasn’t a good fit for her new life. Caleb struggled with the same issues Tammy was trying to fix herself. She was making progress but wasn’t able to embrace the change freely due to her husband. Caleb’s love for fast food was dragging her down and not letting her be herself. She had to reject his gestures just to convey that she was no longer interested in having things like fried chicken. She had to let go of him to live her new truth.




Whether Tammy has fallen in love or wants to find someone new, it may be too soon for her. She has just recovered from one of the biggest tragedies of her life. She needs time to rediscover herself and focus on her health above everything else. Tammy has been doing great and losing weight over the last few months. If she falls in love with someone who breaks her heart, it may hamper her progress. The depression from another failed relationship could push her back to the same old unhealthy habits. The 1000-Lb Sisters star must spend the next year achieving her personal goals before adding another person to her fabulous new life.



1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
