## Literature Review
The School Spirits season 1 finale threw in an unexpected twist involving Janet, meaning there&#39;s much more to Maddie&#39;s story to explore.




Maddie&#39;s story isn&#39;t over after the School Spirits finale added an unexpected twist surrounding her death and a spirit named Janet. Maddie (Peyton List) went into the final episode of the season convinced her mother was her killer. Maddie&#39;s friend Simon (Kristian Ventura) investigated the possibility and found Maddie&#39;s necklace in her mother&#39;s drawer. It was the same necklace Maddie was wearing the day she died. However, Maddie had a flashback to the day she died when she went with Simon to interrogate her mother, and she realized her mother was innocent. Her actual death was connected to a spirit named Janet, who everyone in the spirit support group thought had crossed over.




After the character Dawn (RaeAnne Boone) caused a light display in the school when crossing over, everyone began questioning why the same thing didn&#39;t happen when Janet crossed over. It became obvious Janet didn&#39;t actually cross over. At the finale&#39;s end, it&#39;s revealed that Janet&#39;s spirit possessed Maddie&#39;s body, and Maddie isn&#39;t dead. Janet did this right in front of Mr. Martin (Josh Zuckerman), which also means he&#39;s been hiding information from Maddie. Unfortunately, the final scene shows Janet in Maddie&#39;s body leaving town, meaning Maddie will be stuck as a spirit for a little longer until she can figure out where Janet went.

 Maddie Needs To Track Down Her Body In School Spirits Season 2 
          

School Spirits season 1 followed Maddie and her friends&#39; mission to find out who killed her. Now that the truth is out, season 2 has a new mission: figuring out how Maddie can find Janet and regain her body. In the final scene of School Spirits season 1, Janet buys a bus ticket to get out of town. However, before getting on the bus, she tears down a missing poster about Maddie&#39;s disappearance. This will be a challenge as Maddie and the spirits aren&#39;t allowed off school property. Because they died at the school, they&#39;re trapped there until they cross over. In Maddie&#39;s case, she&#39;s trapped there until she gets her body back.




                  School Spirits Season 2: Cast, Story Details &amp; Everything We Know   With Season 2 of School Spirits in the works, here&#39;s everything you need to know about the cast and story details.    

Luckily, there is a way Maddie can get back inside her body. Maddie was warned not to use hypnosis to try and restore her memory of how she died because it could cause another spirit to go inside her body. This was a hint at what actually happened to Maddie. However, it could also be the perfect way for her to kick Janet out of her body and reclaim it. It&#39;s unclear if Maddie can do this from anywhere or if she needs to get Janet to come back to the school for her to use hypnosis to get her body back.



The first season of School Spirits is also available to stream on Netflix.






 How Will Maddie&#39;s Return Affect Her Friendships With The Spirits? 
         




In School Spirits, the living can&#39;t interact with the dead. The only exception is Simon can see Maddie, and the Janet twist proves the reason is that Maddie isn&#39;t actually dead. She&#39;s just been separated from her body. If Maddie goes back to her body, it could mean she can&#39;t interact with the other spirits anymore. This would be a bittersweet ending because Maddie would get to go back to her life, but she might have to say goodbye to the friends she made.

It would be especially sad for her to say goodbye to Wally since the two had something of a romantic relationship throughout the season. However, because she previously spoke to the ghosts, she might still have this ability when she returns to her body. Another option would be that the friends she made can cross over because they helped her get her body back, meaning things end well for everyone in School Spirits.
