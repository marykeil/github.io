  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Deaths in both The Vampire Diaries and The Originals were often temporary, making it hard to remember who truly died.   The deaths of certain characters, like Kol and Davina, were especially tragic and heartbreaking due to their relationships and potential storylines.   Fans were deeply affected by the deaths of beloved characters like Josh, Elijah, Klaus, Hayley, and Cami, as their deaths brought sadness and emotional repercussions throughout the series.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Originals saw a lot of characters dying through its 5 seasons. Some of them were exceedingly heartbreaking to watch. Here are the saddest deaths.</p>
<p>Like The Vampire Diaries in the same universe, The Originals&rsquo; deaths were a crushing part of being a fan of the franchise. That said, the fact that many characters come back to life throughout the series made it tough to gauge who really died and who didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why questions like &ldquo;does Marcel die in The Originals&rdquo; are still being asked since it&rsquo;s tough to remember who stayed dead.</p>
<p>Some characters were taken too soon while others weren&rsquo;t killed off until the very end of The Originals. Even so, everyone who died was still brought back in some shape or form in the future, whether it was through magic or something more simple like a flashback or vision. Despite the return of many characters, seeing them perish often made for some of the saddest and most heartbreaking scenes on the show.</p>
<pre><code>              When The Originals &amp; Legacies Are Set In The Vampire Diaries Timeline   The Vampire Diaries inspired two spin-offs: The Originals &amp; Legacies. Here's how the timeline between the shows intersects and where they diverge.   
</code></pre>
<p>Kol Mikaelson
Season 3, Episode 17</p>
<p>Kol, just like his other Mikaelson siblings, died plenty of times in both The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. For the most part, Kol was also an antagonist who often went against his brothers Klaus and Elijah, who were main characters. Yet, his untimely death was still tragic for a few reasons. First, he was possessing a witch at the time and he had to die a slow and agonizing death this time due to a hex.</p>
<p>That stood out since a lot of vampire deaths are quickly done at the hands of a stake to the heart. Also, before his death, Kol developed a sweet romance with Davina, which made this death scene even more distressing to watch. Davina had finally found someone who accepted and loved her, yet she now had to be alone again. Although Kol ultimately returned in his human form, this was still crushing.</p>
<p>Aiden
Season 3, Episode 20</p>
<p>Aiden was Josh&rsquo;s boyfriend in season 2. They are considered to be one of the best couples in The Originals because they had such a caring relationship, though it was a forbidden romance since Josh was a vampire and Aiden was a werewolf. The two supernatural beings were typically enemies and it was made even trickier since a bite from Aiden could kill Josh.</p>
<p>However, they had real feelings for each other which made it sweet. Unfortunately, their romance was extremely short-lived since Aiden&rsquo;s heart was ripped out of his chest just before the duo was about to run away and start a life together. It was not only a shocking moment but extremely saddening since the two deserved their happily ever after, especially since Josh was such a beloved character.</p>
<p>Marcel Gerard
Season 3, Episode 21</p>
<p>Although he wasn&rsquo;t a Mikaelson by blood, Marcel Gerard was very much a family member due to his close bond with Klaus and his love for Rebekah. He was often in an interesting position as someone who went up against Klaus, putting him at odds with the viewer even though Klaus did some truly heinous things. That antagonistic relationship was tested like never before when Marcel died in season 3.</p>
<p>Threatened with the possibility that Marcel took a serum to become an upgraded Original Vampire, Elijah took matters into his own hands and ripped Marcel&rsquo;s heart out. Like the audience, Klaus was crushed at the loss of someone important to him. Marcel seemed like he had a lot left to do on The Originals, making it all the more shocking. Of course, he had already taken the serum, allowing him to return as a true threat to the Mikaelsons.</p>
<p>Davina Claire
Season 1, Episode 11</p>
<p>Davina used to be an innocent girl before she became a powerful witch in the later seasons. Like so many other characters in The Vampire Diaries universe, Davina died multiple times on the show, but her first death in season 1 has to be the saddest. She and other young witches were supposed to die and come back during the Harvest, meaning that they were ultimately sacrificed for something the witches believed in.</p>
<p>However, the ancestors didn&rsquo;t bring her back, meaning they left children to die. Characters die consistently on these shows but rarely do kids and teens get killed, seemingly with no return in sight. Moreover, seeing Marcel&rsquo;s reaction to that made her death all the more heartbreaking because he loved her as his own daughter. As is seemingly always the case, Davina eventually returned but that doesn&rsquo;t make the death any less crushing.</p>
<p>Josh
Season 5, Episode 10</p>
<p>Josh is one of the most beloved characters in the fandom. He was a sweetheart in a show full of people fighting for power. Josh remained loyal to Marcel throughout the series, even though it brought him a lot of harm. His death came in the final season and was immensely heartbreaking for the fans since he was one of the few people in this universe who felt legitimately innocent.</p>
<p>Josh didn&rsquo;t get a fitting ending because what he deserved were happiness and peace. Instead, he was killed by advanced werewolf venom, which is the kind of thing that stood in the way of his romance with Aiden. There was also the fact that Josh was a rare case of a character who didn&rsquo;t get the chance to come back after his death. However, he did at least get to reunite with Aiden in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Elijah Mikaelson
Season 5, Episode 13</p>
<p>Elijah Mikaelson is extremely revered and loved by fans of this franchise. Elijah had been staked multiple times by Klaus and died so many times that he was even killed in his very first appearance. Of course, his final death came in the series finale of The Originals. Klaus was about to die and Elijah chose to die with his brother because, according to him, he couldn&rsquo;t live without his brother after being at his side for centuries.</p>
<p>As beautiful as it was to see the strong bond of the brothers, many fans feel that Elijah&rsquo;s death didn&rsquo;t sit right with them. They believe that Elijah should have gotten a chance at a happy life since he never really got one due to his brother and it felt his entire arc was reduced to just being Klaus&rsquo; brother. He succeeded in seeing his brother get redeemed after centuries and should&rsquo;ve had a chance to find happiness after Klaus&rsquo; death.</p>
<p>Jackson Kenner
Season 3, Episode 10</p>
<p>Many fans didn&rsquo;t like Jackson because of how he separated Elijah and Hayley while some loved him for all his great qualities. Still, his death was saddening for basically everyone watching, even if they didn&rsquo;t like him. Jackson died right after confessing his love to Hayley, which made his death even more upsetting. He was ultimately a good person in a world full of bad ones and didn&rsquo;t deserve to die so young, just when he was starting to build a good life with Hayley and Hope.</p>
<p>Klaus Mikaelson
Season 5, Episode 13</p>
<p>Klaus Mikaelson was the protagonist of the series and despite the horrific things he did throughout his long life, fans still loved him. The complex personality of Klaus made him an intriguing character to build a show around and for the audience to root for. He was introduced as a villain in The Vampire Diaries universe, but many instances proved that Klaus could be a good person.</p>
<p>Becoming a father to Hope helped him embrace his good side and form real bonds with people like Cami, Marcel, Hayley, and his siblings. When he had to take his own life to save his daughter, he accepted his death in stride. His character arc was extremely satisfying and his death in the series finale seemed like the right thing for the character. He was always afraid of death but took it to protect Hope. It was sad but fitting for his story.</p>
<p>Hayley Marshall
Season 5, Episode 6</p>
<p>The last season saw plenty of major deaths and one of them was Hayley Marshall. Like Klaus eventually did, Hayley died a martyr&rsquo;s death as she sacrificed her life to save her daughter, Hope. Moments before she died, she expected Elijah to save her but he didn&rsquo;t and that made her death even more tragic because she felt betrayed.</p>
<p>Her death also had a lasting impression because the series dedicated multiple episodes to portraying characters dealing with her death. That means that every time a character handled her loss in their own way, it heightened the emotional repercussions of her death and brought the sad feelings back to the viewers each time. Like Klaus, Hayley didn&rsquo;t get to see her daughter grow up and become the powerful tribrid she turned out to be.</p>
<p>Cami O&rsquo; Connell
Season 3, Episode 19</p>
<p>There have always been comparisons between Cami and Caroline, mostly because they were two women who played a vital role in Klaus&rsquo; redemption. Cami was truly a good person who brought out the best in Klaus and she was so important to the story that her death stretched on for an entire episode. Lucien bit her at the beginning of the episode and then viewers followed her slow death as Klaus tried everything to make her as happy as possible in her last moments.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bittersweet episode as the couple endured some of the sweetest moments but they also ended up being separated forever. Camille was an incredibly good soul and she remained that way until her last breath. Deaths like hers are sad on their own but seeing the reaction of Klaus, who cared deeply for her, made it more heartbreaking.</p>
