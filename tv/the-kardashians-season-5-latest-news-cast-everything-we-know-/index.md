## Literature Review
The Kardashians season 4 ended at the end of November 2023, but the series has been extended for at least 2 more seasons. Heres an update on season 5.




The Kardashians season 4 has come to an end, but season 5 isn&#39;t far behind. The Hulu series began in early 2022, less than a year after their original series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, came to an end after 20 seasons. The new series includes most of the Kardashian-Jenner clan like the original series, including Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian Barker, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, and their mother, Kris Jenner. Viewers also see more of the Kardashian-Jenner kids and how they&#39;ve grown up since they were first introduced in KUWTK and the new kids the Kardashian-Jenner ladies have welcomed into the family.




While the family has gone through many ups on The Kardashians, viewers have also seen many downs. Even though Kim and her now ex-husband, Kanye West, had already separated by the time they started filming The Kardashians, the show did give more of an inside look into how Kim was doing post-divorce and their co-parenting situation. The Kardashians even showed the moment Kim found out Khloé&#39;s partner and father of her two children, Tristan Thompson, had not only cheated on Khloé but had fathered another child while they were together. There is so much more to come in The Kardashians season 5.

 The Kardashians Season 5 Latest News 
          




The Kardashians season 5 has been confirmed via Daily Mail after Disney announced at an event in May 2023 that the series was renewed for another 20 episodes right before the premiere of The Kardashians season 3. The first 10 episodes went to The Kardashians season 4, and the next 10 will be given to season 5. It&#39;s unclear what the premise of The Kardashians season 5 will be, but they will likely continue the storyline of Kim and Kourtney&#39;s ongoing feud.

There has also been a romance update for Kylie, who recently went public with her relationship with actor Timothée Chalamet. Kendall has also been dating singer Bad Bunny for a while, so they may touch on that as well. Kim was also in American Horror Story: Delicate, which might be brought up too.



 The Kardashians Season 5 Potential Release Window 
          




The Kardashians season 5 will likely be released sometime between April and May 2024. According to past seasons of the Hulu reality show, The Kardashians airs two seasons per year: one early in the year and another towards the end of the year. Since season 4 ended toward the end of 2023, it only makes sense for The Kardashians season 5 to premiere in early 2024 if Hulu is following the same schedule. Season 5 will also follow the same episode order, so it will likely include ten episodes in total.



 The Kardashians Season 5 Potential Cast 
         

The cast for The Kardashians season 5 will presumably have the same cast they&#39;ve had since season 1. The cast will more than likely include Kim, Khloé, Kourtney, Kylie, Kendall, and Kris. Scott Disick, Kourtney&#39;s ex and the father of her first three children, will potentially pop up in a few episodes as he has in past seasons. Tristian, Khloé&#39;s partner, will also probably make a few appearances here and there if he&#39;s not playing basketball. Kourtney&#39;s now-husband and drummer for Blink-182, Travis Barker, will more than likely appear on the show as well since Travis and Kourtney are expecting a baby together.






 When Will The Kardashians Season 5 Start Filming?  
          

Since The Kardashians season 5 will more than likely premiere between April and May 2024, it&#39;s possible the Kardashian-Jenner clan has already finished filming or is currently filming the new season. There has been no concrete evidence that the family has resumed filming on social media; however, they might be trying to keep their filming timeline under wraps. It seems the Kardashian-Jenner&#39;s are constantly filming, so it&#39;s very possible that they are filming right now. However, viewers won&#39;t find out when the gang started filming until The Kardashians season 5 airs, which will likely be sometime in early 2024.



The Kardashians seasons 1-4 are available to stream on Hulu.
