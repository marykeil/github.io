  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Family Chantel just ended, and Chantel Everett made sure to provide some bombshell remarks about her ex, Pedro Jimeno, in the series finale.</p>
<p>The Family Chantel has just concluded its run after five seasons, and Chantel Everett stepped up to demolish her ex-husband Pedro Jimeno verbally in the final episodes of the hit reality TV show. Pedro and Chantel were once a golden couple on 90 Day Fiancé, but their happy image was shattered when Pedro filed for divorce from Chantel during The Family Chantel season 4. However, Chantel came out swinging when clapping back at her ex-husband in a number of scathing remarks since their divorce.
Chantel remained mostly silent after the dramatic The Family Chantel season 4 finale, as it was clear she wanted to stay married to Pedro and start a family. While the divorce was being finalized, the TLC star didn&rsquo;t often directly address her split since it became public news in summer 2022. While Chantel hinted at tension through lip-synch videos as she declared herself single and made it clear her past relationship was troubled, it wasn&rsquo;t until The Family Chantel season 5 that she was able to address her anger publicly. Therefore, many of Chantel&rsquo;s most scathing remarks about Pedro came out during the short-lived six-episode final season.</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;The marriage is irretrievably broken with no hope of reconciliation…. cruel treatment [including] physical domestic violence, as well as mental pain.&rdquo;
Chantel&rsquo;s legal documents with Pedro are released</p>
<p>Chantel and Pedro both kept rather quiet about their split after The Family Chantel season 4. That is why fans pounced all over documents about Chantel and Pedro&rsquo;s split. After the couple separated on April 27, 2022, Pedro filed for divorce on May 27, 2022. Then, both Pedro and Chantel filed restraining orders against each other. It was then revealed that Chantel accused Pedro of mental and physical abuse in legal documents, as her side of the split began to become public.</p>
<p>7  “No, because it hurts. Because I was so stupid. It’s because I was so stupid. And even that, from the beginning, it was all a lie.&quot;
Chantel opens up to Obed about Pedro&rsquo;s betrayal</p>
<p>In the penultimate episode of The Family Chantel, Chantel opened up with Obed Corporan about Pedro. Obed was a former friend of Pedro&rsquo;s family who formerly tried to warn Chantel that they were using her. He confirmed to Chantel during season 5 that Pedro&rsquo;s family and friends insulted Chantel and called her ugly in front of Pedro while they laughed about how quickly she fell for Pedro during their dating days. A heartbroken and angry Chantel then tearfully accepted that her marriage had been a lie from the start.</p>
<p>6  &ldquo;I want to tell you and your family to move on. Why do you pay so much attention to my family?”<br>
Chantel accuses Pedro and his family of being obsessed</p>
<p>Chantel expressed her full frustration for Pedro and his family during The Family Chantel finale. Her anger reached an all-time high after Lidia Morel and Nicole Jimeno sent voodoo items to Chantel, her parents, Thomas and Karen Everett, and her siblings Winter and Riverknight Everett. Chantel told Pedro off and came equipped with holy water, sage, and a crucifix when meeting with his family for a final time.</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;I want you and your family to stop bothering my family and to leave me the f*** alone.”<br>
Chantel accuses the Jimenos of &ldquo;terroristic threats&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chantel ramped her anger up a notch when it came to how she felt about the Jimeno family during The Family Chantel finale. The Everett family was openly disturbed when receiving the voodoo dolls, which led to the TLC star accusing Pedro&rsquo;s family of &ldquo;terroristic threats&rdquo; against her family, as the dolls were placed in a small coffin. While Nicole and Lidia laughed at Chantel and called her crazy, she expressed real anger and fear over their vindictive move as she urged them to get out of her life for good and used strong language when telling Pedro.
: Chantel Won’t Let Divorce From Pedro Stop Her From Having Kids On The Family Chantel</p>
<p>4  “You’re going to do it yourself, you’re going to get yourself deported. I don’t need to do anything… everything that you did. You scammed me, preyed on me.”
Chantel responds to accusations her family tried to get Pedro deported</p>
<p>One of the biggest he-said-she-said aspects of Chantel and Pedro&rsquo;s messy split is whether he used her for a green card and financial gain. Chantel&rsquo;s family infamously accused Pedro of being a user from the start, while Chantel eventually agreed with them during The Family Chantel season 5. A furious Pedro accused the family of trying to have him deported after their divorce, while Chantel snapped back and told him he would manage that all on his own.</p>
<p>3  “You treated me so bad, you only stayed with me for the money.&rdquo;
Chantel brands Pedro a user in the dramatic series finale Chantel truly did not hold back in The Family Chantel finale, as she essentially echoed her parents&rsquo; former words. Karen and Thomas previously claimed that Pedro married Chantel to “harvest the American dollar.&rdquo; Chantel seemingly agreed with this infamous assessment, as she said that Pedro was only with her for the money. Although Pedro, Nicole, and Lidia denied her claims, she held her ground in their messy confrontation.</p>
<p>2  &ldquo;You have a family of predators. You prey on people because you are pathetic users.”<br>
Chantel shuts down Pedro&rsquo;s scheming family.
The Family Chantel&rsquo;s Chantel Everett And Pedro Jimeno</p>
<p>Chantel made it clear that she wasn&rsquo;t going to cut ties with Pedro on amicable grounds. The Dominican Republic native admitted to being a bad husband and even apologized to Chantel. However, Chantel refused to accept Pedro&rsquo;s apology since he denied infidelity claims. Chantel insisted that it was Pedro&rsquo;s plan all along to use her and that he, like his family, was predatory. Though she didn&rsquo;t accept his apology, she said that calling her ex out freed her and allowed her to move on at the end of The Family Chantel season 5.</p>
<p>1  &ldquo;You are nothing. Pathetic user. A pathetic predator. Do you know that I changed your life? “If it wasn’t for me, you would be standing barefoot on a dirt road in the Campo eating chicken feet.&rdquo;
Chantel destroys Pedro in fiery FaceTime call</p>
<p>Chantel may have ended The Family Chantel season 5 with hope for her future, as she said she was free of Pedro. However, she managed to release her most scathing quote to date that might even top her calling Nicole a &ldquo;b****-a**, s<strong>t-a</strong> w***e.&rdquo; Chantel unleashed her full fury towards her ex-husband in a heated FaceTime call during The Family Chantel finale. She made it fully clear that she considers it thanks to her that Pedro has the life he does today.</p>
