## Literature Review
Surviving Paradise season 1 is considered a big success, and its host Jessimae Pelus’ social media reveals if she has begun filming season 2.




Surviving Paradise was a hit show, but it may be a while before it returns to Netflix. The competition-focused reality TV show premiered on the streaming service in October 2023. It featured 12 young contestants duking it out and surviving in the tropical location to win the $100k cash prize. Surviving Paradise season 1 got mostly positive reviews online, and most episodes achieved above-average ratings on IMDB. Therefore, the new show will likely return for a second season on Netflix sometime in the next year or so.




Sadly, the streaming service hasn’t announced Surviving Paradise season 2 yet. A reason for this could be internal delays that have also previously halted the show. According to past production details, the show’s production company started casting for interesting and entertaining competitors in 2020. It took them over two years to produce the show for its October 20, 2023 premiere on Netflix. If the production time frame is similar to last time, viewers shouldn’t expect Surviving Paradise to return for a while.

 Surviving Paradise Season 2 Latest News 
          




Netflix hasn’t greenlit Surviving Paradise season 2 yet. Neither the official website nor the social media channels have anything to say about the sequel of the competition series. However, the silence may not suggest there’s a piece of bad news. The streaming platform often releases the official trailers two or three months before premiering the shows. Since Surviving Paradise season 1 isn’t too old, an announcement will likely happen sometime next year. The show’s production company, Studio Lambert, has made five Netflix shows in 2023, including Squid Game: The Challenge. Therefore, their partnership with Netflix will likely continue.



 Surviving Paradise Season 2 Potential Release Window 
          

There is no confirmed premiere date for Surviving Paradise season 2 yet. Since the show is the first of its kind, it’s hard to precisely predict when fans can expect to see it return to Netflix. However, some of the other release schedules and the production company’s past work make the premiere date of Surviving Paradise season 2 guessable. Studio Lambert also produces another reality competition series for Netflix called The Circle. There was a 15-month gap between the series’ first and second seasons, so fans shouldn’t expect Surviving Paradise season 2 before October 2024.






 Surviving Paradise Season 2 Potential Cast 
          

Like other details, the cast of Surviving Paradise season 2 isn’t official yet. However, the casting of other Studio Lambert shows hints that viewers will mostly see new faces in season 2, except a few. Netflix’s The Circle season 5 featured Big Brother and The Circle alums, such as Shubham Goel, the runner-up from The Circle season 1. Therefore, viewers may likely see some Surviving Paradise season 1 cast members in season 2. The show’s host and popular comedian, Jessimae Peluso, may also return to the series.



 Has Surviving Paradise Season 2 Been Filmed? 

 




There’s no news about the filming stage of Surviving Paradise season 2 as of December 2023. Therefore, it’s easy to assume that the show is likely in its pre-production phase. The producers are likely looking for new cast members; however, they haven’t made an official casting call yet. The show’s host, Jessimae, has also not posted much content from tropical locations. Previously, she shared many pictures from the beachside, likely around the time of season 1’s filming. Since she has only been focusing on her comedy and podcast, the filming for Surviving Paradise season 2 has likely not started.
