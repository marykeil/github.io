## Literature Review
A furious American 90 Day Fiancé star claims Daniele Gates is a &#34;complete trash&#34; woman who &#34;belongs to the streets&#34; for messaging her boyfriend.




A 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cast member is accusing Daniele Gates of secretly DMing their boyfriend and claiming that Daniele is &#34;complete trash&#34; who &#34;belongs on the street.&#34; Daniele is a 43-year-old New York woman who debuted in 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise season 2 with Yohan Geronimo, 33. Daniele married Yohan, and they planned on moving to the U.S., but Daniele kept him in the dark about what she wanted to do. Daniele moving to the Dominican Republic made Yohan resent her as he turned to other women to give him money. Daniele exposed Yohan at the Tell-All, but not everyone believed her.




Shekinah Garner did not raise her hand when Shaun Robinson asked if they believed Yohan was a cheater, and the aesthetician is now suggesting she may have done it because of a message Daniele sent to her boyfriend Sarper Güven.

          

Daniele reposted an Instagram Story in which she was tagged by Shekinah, who was offended that Daniele had &#34;poked the tiger.&#34; She wrote that Daniele &#34;messaged MY BOYFRIEND&#34; before the Tell-All to tell Sarper that she was &#34;sorry in advance for anything she might say&#34; at the Tell-All but sent Shekinah &#34;nothing.&#34; Shekinah was offended by Daniele calling her a &#34;woman hater.&#34; She said all Daniele did on set was ask if there&#39;s &#34;anyone with a penis&#34; to help her.

Shekinah claimed that the number of times Daniele said the words &#34;penis and vagina&#34; on set was &#34;appalling.&#34; Meanwhile, Daniele asked Shekinah to &#34;post the exchange please.&#34; Daniele noticed certain Instagram accounts commenting things like she shouldn’t have attacked Shekinah and that she was jealous of Shekinah. Daniele went through their pages and realized they were bots. She suspected it was a “network thing” and that someone was trying to create a fight between her and Shekinah for a possible spin-off. Daniele knew it was a “campaign” where someone was paying bot accounts to tweet things. Daniele then saw Shekinah responding to one of them.


 

“Oh this b**** is paying bots,” Daniele thought to herself. She said she was happy to have a public conversation with Shekinah about whatever her problem was. Daniele shared a screenshot of Shekinah replying with clapping hands emojis to a comment that called Daniele “miserable” for relying on “witchcraft” to get what she wants and praising Sarper for being “HONEST!! about his PAST!” Daniele added a caption where she said, “Nothing good has ever come to a cast member supporting the harassment of other cast members like this, ESPECIALLY with bots.” Daniele told her followers that no one should “move through your world in this way.”

Daniele and Shekinah seem to have locked horns over the message that Daniele reportedly sent Sarper, but Shekinah forgot to talk about it on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. Now that the season is over, Shekinah going after Daniele is a futile exercise. Daniele did not have a lot of fans when she started her reality TV journey because it seemed like she tricked Yohan into believing he could live his American Dream. However, Yohan&#39;s cheating scandal being exposed has turned Daniele into a hero for talking openly about her unfaithful husband while warning other women about him.
