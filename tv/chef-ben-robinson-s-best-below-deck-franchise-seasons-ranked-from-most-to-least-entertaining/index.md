## Literature Review
Ben Robinson from the Below Deck franchise has saved several yachts from their downfalls. He isn’t only a great chef but a problem solver.




Ben Robinson has given Below Deck viewers countless memorable moments over the last ten years. The iconic chef is known for his stint on numerous Bravo shows, including Below Deck and Below Deck Mediterranean. He’s famous for being one of the most entertaining crew members of the show due to his likable personality and nearly two decades of culinary experience. Ben debuted in the franchise in Below Deck season 1. He remained a regular on the series for three more seasons and continued his run on Captain Sandy Yawn’s yacht in 2016 and 2019.




Ben became very popular in the series for his friendship with chief stewardess Kate Chastain. The two gave fans many dramatic moments on-screen and social media, which sparked their dating rumors. In 2023, Kate welcomed a baby with a man, who most fans think is her chef friend. Ben quit the series before the COVID-19 pandemic. He fulfilled his job as a chef in Below Deck Mediterranean season 4 and became a health coach. Nowadays, Ben is a celebrity chef, a Below Deck icon, and a culinary influencer.

 Below Deck Season 4 
         

Over the last ten years, Ben has been on six different Below Deck franchise spin-offs. However, some of his appearances have been more entertaining than others. Ben’s least fun run was on Below Deck season 4. It was his last season on Captain Lee Rosbach’s yacht, and it didn’t go well. Ben had several problematic moments in season 4, including with Kate Chastain and Emily Warburton-Adams. At one point, Emily questioned the popular chef’s relationship with Kate, which ended poorly. Overall, Ben’s relationship drama and cooking on the yacht weren’t too exciting or worth watching.

 Below Deck Med Season 1 

 

Ben’s new beginning on Bravo’s Below Deck Mediterranean was way better than his last run on the original series. He brought a bold attitude and witty humor during the spin-off’s premiere season and made viewers laugh. In episode 1, Ben hilariously mocked the guests for thinking his dish was too heavy. He said, “I don’t care if I have to run an extra half mile, one day, I want moussaka in Greece.” He also called out stew, Hannah Ferrier, for underselling his dish. He added, “if you tell them it’s vegetables and beef and it’s white in a bowl, I’m not gonna want that either.”




The famous chef continued making his sarcastic and witty remarks throughout season 1. He had arguments with the chief stew that continued in every episode. Sometimes, the two debated the type of dish to serve the charter guests. Other times, they dealt with miscommunications or simply discussed more personal things. Ben’s run on Below Deck Mediterranean’s debut season was fun, including his to and fro with Hannah. However, the main drama was between the younger and newer crew members, making Ben’s appearance in the season somewhat forgettable and less interesting than in other seasons.

 Below Deck Med Season 4 
         

Ben’s final season on Captain Sandy’s yacht was way better than his last season on Captain Lee’s ship. The chef joined Below Deck Mediterranean season 4 halfway through. Despite that, he left a mark and saved the crew from embarrassing themselves when former chef Mila Kolomeitseva was let go due to her unacceptable culinary skills. Ben joined the spin-off in episode 13 after third stew Anastasia Surmava had tried her hands at being the yacht’s temporary chef for a few episodes. He came in and seamlessly integrated himself into Captain Sandy’s crew.




Ben left a great mark on his co-workers during his final appearance. He applauded Anastasia for handling the chef job for nearly four charters and made Aesha Scott fall in love with his attitude. He also made good fun of former chef Mila, stating that she looked like a “cleaner” who didn’t know any better. During one episode, Ben pushed a drunk Travis to help him out. However, he later felt that he may have overreacted to the situation. Travis’ only misjudgment was when he cooked a fancy meal for drunk guests. He realized he should’ve cooked something more fatty, like a burger and fries.



 Below Deck Season 3 

 

Bravo alum Ben also rescued Captain Lee’s yacht in Below Deck season 3 after former chef Leon Walker messed up. Leon, the crew’s only chef for ten episodes, started a fire, which led the Captain to fire him. Lee then called on Ben to help them with the final few charters and assume the role of the head chef. Ben joined the yacht in episode 10 and was only there on the show for three episodes. Despite that, he was able to showcase to everyone why he’s the ultimate Below Deck franchise chef and why everyone calls him for help.






 Below Deck Season 1 
         

Below Deck season 1 was one of Ben’s most entertaining appearances. Not only was it his debut, but also the premiere season for the reality TV series that has now become a global name. Ben’s first appearance under Captain Lee was marvelous. He got the right amount of screen time and was able to wow viewers with his cool personality and culinary skills. Unlike other cast members, Ben had the looks and style of being a reality TV chef from the start. His journey in season 1 solidified that the network should bring him back for season 2.



 Below Deck Season 2 
          




Ben’s best Below Deck appearance happened in Below Deck season 2. While the popular chef liked his run on Below Deck Med season 1 because he loves Greece, viewers liked his on-screen appearance on Captain Lee’s yacht in season 2. Ben faced numerous ups and downs during his second run. From his boiling friendship with Kate to his cooking sessions with flirty lady guests, he entertained through and through. Overall, Ben was one of the main attractions of Below Deck season 2, making it his best yet.





Below Deck returns on February 5, 2024, on Bravo.
