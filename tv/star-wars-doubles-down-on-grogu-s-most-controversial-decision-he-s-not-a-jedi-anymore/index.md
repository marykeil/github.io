## Literature Review
Grogu is officially a Mandalorian apprentice, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie will focus on Grogu&#39;s Mandalorian identity rather than his Jedi past.




In an announcement from Lucasfilm that confirmed the next Star Wars movie will be The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, the franchise also doubled down on Grogu&#39;s controversial decision to leave the Jedi and begin his training as a Mandalorian apprentice. Director Jon Favreau confirmed that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be the next Star Wars movie in the franchise, meaning Din Djarin&#39;s and Grogu&#39;s relationship will be further explored in the near future. In The Mandalorian TV show, Din and Grogu developed an extremely close relationship, with the pair forming a father-son bond.






The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be the first Star Wars movie to hit theaters since 2019&#39;s Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.




Grogu was saved by Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian season 2 finale, but the Jedi Master gave him an ultimatum during their training in The Book of Boba Fett. Grogu could have either taken a lightsaber and continued the path to becoming a Jedi, or taken the armor Din had given him and returned to his father figure forever. Grogu chose the armor, and his life as a Jedi ended. Since then, the ending of The Mandalorian season 3 saw Grogu welcomed into the Children of the Watch, and saw Din officially adopt him as his son. While Grogu is over 50 years old, he still has a lot of growing to do before he becomes a full-fledged Mandalorian.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    





 Grogu Is Officially A Mandalorian Apprentice, Not A Jedi 
          

In the announcement from Star Wars, Favreau said, &#34;The prospect of bringing the Mandalorian and his apprentice Grogu to the big screen is extremely exciting.&#34; The wording of the quote implies that Grogu is now officially Din&#39;s apprentice, and that any dreams of becoming a Jedi have been squashed. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will likely focus solely on Grogu&#39;s new life as a Mandalorian, meaning that he won&#39;t receive much formal training in the Force. Instead of a lightsaber, Grogu will learn to fight with a blaster.



 How Will The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu See The Apprentice Grow &amp; Change? 
          




Grogu&#39;s life as a Mandalorian apprentice has many opportunities to see the youngling grow. With his time now dedicated fully to training under Din, Grogu&#39;s combat abilities will likely develop very quickly. His connection to the Force will also be a huge advantage, especially with Din encouraging Grogu to use it in The Mandalorian season 3. Now that Din and Grogu are back in good standing with the Children of the Watch, they will likely have many new resources available to them, one of which could be Grogu&#39;s own Mandalorian helmet and armor. Grogu wasn&#39;t given a helmet in the show because he was too young to speak the Creed. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu could solve that problem, though, and have Grogu speak his first words.

Grogu&#39;s journey is far from complete, and his time as a Mandalorian apprentice will soon be featured in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. With the possibility of becoming a Jedi removed, Grogu will have plenty of time to develop his skills and train with Din. How much he changes and what kind of Mandalorian he grows into remain to be seen, but no matter what the future of Star Wars holds for him, he will always have his teacher and father by his side.




             The Mandalorian Set to be the culmination of The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and The Mandalorian Disney&#43; television series, The Mandalorian film is set to conclude the stories collectively. Little information on the project is available other than Dave Filoni will lead the project, and the film will act as the replacement for the fourth season of The Mandalorian.
