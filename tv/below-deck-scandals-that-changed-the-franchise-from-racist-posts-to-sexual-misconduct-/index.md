## Literature Review
Through the years, the Below Deck franchise has seen several scandals happen both on and off-screen. However, a few of them are worse than others.




Through the years, there have been several Below Deck scandals that have taken place, with some being more heinous than others. With five spin-offs and more than 20 seasons in the franchise, Below Deck is bound to have a few scandals in its time. The franchise focuses on the personal and work lives of yachties, and it&#39;s not that surprising when something goes wrong on board between the crew members. However, there were several times when the crew got out of hand, which caused something to go awry. Because of their antics, scandals were created while filming.




Below Deck is known for being a fun Bravo series that fans can watch to unwind. The relatability to their work life is what viewers loved about the show. The beautiful scenery is also a plus since they&#39;ve gone to amazing countries such as Italy, Spain, Thailand, and more. However, the drama is what viewers love the most, seeing as it&#39;s on the same network as The Real Housewives. While the Below Deck drama is a huge part of the franchise, sometimes it got a little too out of control, and it created some of the most well-known Below Deck scandals.

 Malia White Snitching On Hannah Ferrier 
          




During Below Deck Mediterranean season 5, Malia White was under fire for snitching on Chief Stew Hannah Ferrier for having unregistered Valium and a vape pen on board. At the time, Malia and Hannah were sharing a cabin, and all was well between the two. However, things changed after Chef Kiko Loren was fired, and they had to find a new chef. Malia suggested her boyfriend at the time, Tom Checketts, and Captain Sandy Yawn agreed. While this solved their chef issues, it caused issues between Malia and Hannah. Malia wanted to room with Tom, and Hannah refused to leave her cabin as she didn&#39;t want to bunk with Stew Budgsy Drake.

Shortly after the room debacle started, Malia found Hannah&#39;s unregistered Valium and vape pen in their room. Malia took a photo and sent it to Sandy. The Captain was furious and called Hannah into her office the following day. Sandy immediately fired Hannah once they began their chat.

What makes this such a scandal is Hannah had Valium because she suffered from anxiety, which was diagnosed by her doctor. Malia and Sandy received a ton of backlash following the incident, making Below Deck Med season 5 the most popular Bravo show of 2020. However, this scandal hurt Malia the most as she received a lot of hate from viewers. It was surprising when she returned for Below Deck Med season 6, but she was able to redeem herself as she is now starring in Winter House season 3.






 Luke Jones&#39;s Sexual Misconduct 
         

One of the most talked about scandals from the franchise this year is Luke Jones&#39;s on Below Deck Down Under season 2. Luke was the bosun on board and had quite a flirty personality. He immediately took a liking to Stew Margot Sisson but also had a thing for Second Stew Laura Bileskalne. However, Luke did have more of an attraction to Margot and would let up with the flirting. At first, Margot was fine with some innocent flirting and sharing a few kisses with Luke here and there during their crew nights off. However, things took a turn between them when everyone had a little too much to drink.

                  What Happened To Luke Jones After Below Deck Down Under Season 2?   Luke Jones was fired on Below Deck Down Under season 2 for inappropriate behavior towards a stew. Find out what the bosun has been up to since.    




After their night out, the crew went back to the boat to party some more. While some went to the hot tub, others went to bed, like Margot. She felt like she was too drunk and wanted to sleep it off. Luke noticed that Margot had gone down to her cabin, but he wasn&#39;t ready for her to go to sleep. Luke then hopped into her bed naked, and Margot was completely unaware.

Thankfully, the Below Deck Down Under camera crew was there to pull him out of her cabin before anything worse took place. Luke was then fired by Captain Jason Chambers. Not only was Luke fired, but he received a ton of backlash online following the sexual misconduct incident.



 Peter Hunziker&#39;s Racist Post 

 

Peter Hunziker was the lead deckhand on Below Deck Med season 5. He joined the boat as someone who was really cocky, and Bosun Malia didn&#39;t like it. She put him in his place several times after he would refer to her as &#34;sweetheart,&#34; which Malia found to be sexist and condescending.






Peter was also demoted from lead deckhand to a regular deckhand.




Peter was already on the verge of a Below Deck scandal while filming, but his scandal didn&#39;t take place until the season began to air. Peter was fired by Bravo for a racist post he had on his social media. Shortly after the post came to light, the Below Deck Med production company fired him and removed any scenes he had on the season (via Bravo&#39;s Instagram). It was the most talked about Bravo scandal, along with Hannah&#39;s firing during the same season.

                  Below Deck Sailing Yacht&#39;s Gary King Plays The Victim After Sexual Misconduct Allegation   Below Deck Sailing Yacht&#39;s Gary King has been called out for alleged sexual harassment on the Bravo series, but he&#39;s still playing the victim.    



 Gary King&#39;s Sexual Assault Allegations 

 




Over the summer, a production assistant from Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 4 accused Gary King of sexual assault in an exposé with the Rolling Stones. Samantha Suarez, the woman who accused Gary of assault, claims the first officer made several unwanted advances towards her while filming the most recent season of the Bravo series. She says the assault took place after filming wrapped and Gary was very drunk.

She alleged that he wouldn&#39;t let her leave the room and even pushed himself against her so she couldn&#39;t leave. Samantha then alerted production about what had happened. However, they did nothing and simply let him sleep on the boat instead of in the hotel during their &#34;dark days&#34; of filming.

Gary&#39;s scandal was the most unexpected as it came out of nowhere. Yes, Gary can come off as a little creepy and forward on BDSY, but he never seemed like the type to go to this extent. Gary has since denied the claims in the press and most recently on his Instagram. He wrote in the caption, &#34;It’s sad that people will do anything in their power to bring you down. It’s not about how you fall but how you get up [...].&#34;




Over the years, the Below Deck franchise has seen a number of scandals. Some were worse than others but riveting nonetheless. Who knew that yachties could cause so much trouble?
