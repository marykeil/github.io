## Literature Review
Sister Wives: Christine and David’s Wedding special shows how much love Christine Brown receives from her family and David Woolley on her special day.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown walked down the aisle with David Woolley in a brand-new preview of her wedding special. The reality star was in an incompatible relationship with her polygamous ex, Kody Brown, for nearly 30 years. She craved love and wanted to find someone who truly cared for her. In 2023, Christine revealed she finally found her match in David. She revealed he was her soulmate and didn’t waste much time before introducing him to her family. The following year, Christine married David, surrounded by her family. She allowed TLC to film her beautiful ceremony.




The second part of Christine and David’s Wedding, which wraps up Sister Wives season 18, airs January 14. Recently, TLC shared a sneak peek from the episode and showed how the pair shared some beautiful moments together. The preview clip, reported by People, featured David waiting for Christine as she walked down the aisle with her son, Paedon brown. The mom of six grabbed her son’s arm as he slowly walked her to his new step-dad. “There’s my goddess, there’s my queen, my unicorn,” the new Sister Wives star said in a confessional while remembering the unforgettable moment and making Christine blush with love.

The preview clip also filmed some significant reactions from the family members. One moment from the video showed Christine embracing her dad while walking to the altar. She said, “Hey, Daddy,” as her father, Rex, hugged her tight and shared some kind words. He responded, “Wonderful day, honey, he’s a wonderful man.” The Sister Wives cast member thanked her father for her love as he assured her emotionally. Rex added, “You guys are gonna love each other.” Janelle Brown then claimed it was heartwarming to see Christine share that moment with her father. She claimed, “It feels right.”


 

Christine’s heartwarming wedding was the perfect celebration she needed to restart her life again. The former polygamist was truly miserable for nearly 30 years with Kody. While the Sister Wives cast member did welcome six kids with the man, she never really got true respect and care in return. When Christine divorced Kody in November 2021, she entered uncharted waters full of uncertainty. She received a lot of criticism for betraying her religion and not following through with her past commitments. Christine would’ve probably regretted leaving her old life behind if it hadn’t been for David and his love.




It was also great to see Christine’s family members support her as she tried something new. Most of her relatives attended the ceremony and seemed happy in the preview clip. The standout moment was when Christine hugged her father, who has supported her throughout her life. The old man was there for his daughter when she was in a polygamist relationship with Kody, and he was there for her during her divorce. Now he came to cheer her on at her wedding with the love of her life. Rex seemed genuinely happy about the Sister Wives star’s new journey with David.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
