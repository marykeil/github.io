## Literature Review
Twelfth Doctor Peter Capaldi shares his thoughts on the David Tennant Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials and opinion on the new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa.




Twelfth Doctor actor Peter Capaldi opens up about his thoughts on the David Tennant-led Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials, giving his honest reactions and thoughts on Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s upcoming adventures. The actor was announced as the Twelfth incarnation of the Doctor in 2013 through a special live show, and would make a brief appearance in the show&#39;s 50th-anniversary special &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34; before making his full debut in 2013&#39;s seasonal special &#34;The Time of the Doctor&#34;. After three seasons in the TARDIS, Capaldi took his final bow in 2017&#39;s seasonal special &#34;Twice Upon A Time&#34;, passing the baton to Jodie Whittaker.




While Capaldi has firmly ruled out a Doctor Who return, the actor has nevertheless opened up about his thoughts on the latest chapter of the sci-fi series. As reported by Forbes, Capaldi revealed that he enjoyed the 60th-anniversary episodes, praising the storyline&#39;s plot and the performances of returning stars Tennant and Catherine Tate, while joining in on the excitement surrounding Gatwa&#39;s new era. Check out Capaldi&#39;s full response below:


I enjoyed it. I thought it was great and a lot of fun,It was wonderful, exuberant, and full of life, drama, and monsters. David was wonderful, and Catherine Tate, of course. It&#39;s Doctor Who, you know, it&#39;s a gas and a good thing in the world. It&#39;s a nice, fun, exciting thing, and I look forward to the rest of the specials and Ncuti Gatwa coming along. I&#39;ve met him, and he&#39;s very inspiring and charming.



 How Doctor Who&#39;s 60th-anniversary Paid Tribute To The Twelfth Doctor&#39;s Era 
          




Though Capaldi did not make his return in Doctor Who&#39;s 60th-anniversary milestone storyline, the celebrations still made sure to feature nods to the actor&#39;s era. Capaldi&#39;s incarnation is explicitly mentioned as the Fourteenth Doctor (Tennant) is listing through his prior incarnations since he last had that face to Ruth Madeley&#39;s Shirley Ann Bingham in &#34;The Star Beast&#34;. &#34;The Giggle&#34; also sees Kate turn to the Doctor when faced with the geopolitical ramifications of shooting down a satellite, stating she needs permission to do so that the Time Lord gives, a potential nod to the protocol established in season 8 that names the Doctor as the President of the Earth should it fall into unfathomable crisis.

A more explicit nod to Capaldi&#39;s Doctor Who tenure comes later on in &#34;The Giggle&#34; when the Fourteenth Doctor comes face to face with Neil Patrick Harris&#39; Toymaker in his Soho shop. Made a captive audience to a twisted puppet show, the Doctor is taunted by the Toymaker over several companion&#39;s fates, including Clara Oswald (Jemma Coleman) in season 9 and Bill Potts (Pearl Mackie) in season 10. The nods to Capaldi-era companions have a stronger impact, as they are one of the factors leading to why the Fourteenth Doctor chooses to retire and handle his traumas.




While many may wish for Capaldi to return on screen, it is clear that the actor still appreciates Doctor Who as both a creative involved and as a longtime fan since the show&#39;s earliest episodes. As such, it is clear that the show&#39;s milestone celebrations left him impressed on both fronts. Furthermore, with Capaldi eager to see more of Doctor Who season 14, excitement for the series&#39; return in May 2024 is sure to keep building.



Capaldi&#39;s Doctor Who adventures can be streamed on Max, while Doctor Who&#39;s 60th-anniversary specials are available on Disney&#43; for international viewers and BBC iplayer for UK audiences.
