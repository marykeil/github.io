Summary

  Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 5 brings the Greek god of war into the modern world, targeting a new generation of viewers.   Ares&#39; line about starting a fight on Twitter perfectly blends fantasy with reality in a hilarious way.   The show&#39;s use of relatable references like Twitter helps it appeal to viewers of all ages while staying true to the timeless elements of the Percy Jackson story.  







Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 5 introduces the Greek god of war, and Ares&#39; best line perfectly targets the Disney adaptation&#39;s modern audience. Rick Riordan&#39;s Percy Jackson books are still popular today, but they first hit shelves in the 2000s. Their real-world references reflect that, with one scene in The Lightning Thief even talking about instant messaging. Such concepts are updated in the Percy Jackson show, increasing its appeal for a new generation of viewers.

Of course, Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&#39; main storyline is steeped in Greek mythology, offering a tale that&#39;s essentially timeless. Still, scenes set outside Camp Half-Blood need to feature a believable real-world backdrop. One line from Ares in episode 5, &#34;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers,&#34; attempts to blend the series&#39; fantastical elements with reality, and it does a hilarious and effective job of it.

 Ares Reveals He&#39;s A Twitter Troll In Percy Jackson Episode 5 
          

Perhaps the funniest line from Ares in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 5 is dropped when Percy and his friends meet the Olympian god at a diner. They sit down to speak with him, and he tells the trio, &#34;Give me a second. I&#39;m just starting a fight on Twitter.&#34; With these words, the Disney&#43; show turns the god of war into a Twitter troll — and that&#39;s the perfect depiction of how many human beings wage war with each other in the year 2023. From minor arguments between users to genuine political spats, Twitter is known for stirring the sort of controversy Ares thrives on.

Although the story itself doesn&#39;t take place in the present day, the Twitter line still makes sense given the site&#39;s 2006 launch. And it bridges the gap between the show&#39;s early-2000s setting and the audience watching it. The best part about this quote is that it makes total sense that Ares would be plugged into sites like Twitter. Not only are such websites famously vicious in their interactions, but the god of war would need to keep up with social media in the 21st century to stay updated on current events and conflicts.






 Ares&#39; Twitter Comment Perfectly Targets The Disney Show&#39;s Modern Audience 
          

Ares&#39; hilarious fixation on Twitter in Percy Jackson episode 5 perfectly targets the show&#39;s modern audience, presenting a relatable moment for viewers in the midst of the fantastical things unfolding on-screen. Fantasy stories set in the real world are most believable when they drop references like this, and Ares&#39; comment doesn&#39;t take away from Percy Jackson&#39;s almost timeless setting. The show hasn&#39;t made many pop culture references to suggest its timeline, as those would likely age poorly or read as confusing to generations that didn&#39;t grow up with them. It&#39;s mostly stuck to well-known movies and songs, like Saving Private Ryan or &#34;What Is Love (Baby Don&#39;t Hurt Me).&#34;

Twitter is another piece of real life that most viewers will recognize, even if they themselves haven&#39;t used the social media platform. And those from younger generations will almost certainly have been on Twitter before, allowing them to pick up on the joke about Twitter and its constant conflicts easily. References like this blend reality with the world of gods and demigods nicely, setting it up for success with viewers of all ages.






 Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Blends The Books &amp; Present Day For A New Generation 
         

Ares&#39; Twitter line is just one example of how Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians is blending the events of the books with modern life to appeal to a new generation. The kids who grew up with Riordan&#39;s series as it was published — all of whom are now adults — may be tuning in for its TV adaptation. However, the show needs to expand its reach beyond early fans. It also needs to capture the attention of younger generations in order to succeed and deliver Percy Jackson&#39;s five-book arc. That means crafting a story that appeals to more than just its established fan base.

By keeping specific references to a minimum and nodding to the real world in ways every generation will understand, Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show is already making strides toward that goal. The Greek mythology that inspires Percy&#39;s story and the magic of Camp Half-Blood are timeless elements that will land no matter when the story is visited. Details like Ares&#39; love of Twitter ground the narrative in reality in ways that aren&#39;t over the top or unbelievable but still appeal to Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&#39; viewership.
