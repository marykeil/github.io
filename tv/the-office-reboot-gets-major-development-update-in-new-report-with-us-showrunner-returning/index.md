## Literature Review
The Office reboot gets a major development update, with a new report suggesting returning US showrunner Greg Daniels has taken another step forward.




Plans for a revival of the hit comedy series The Office have taken a major step forward under the tenure of original US showrunner Greg Daniels. Based on the British mockumentary show of the same name, the US version of The Office would go on to become one of the most popular sitcoms of the early 2000s and would also pave the way for similar shows such as Parks and Recreation. Plans for a revival had been spoken about as early as 2019, and in September last year the project was reported to be in active development with Daniels potentially returning as showrunner.




Per a new report from The Hollywood Reporter, the highly anticipated revival of The Office has now taken one step closer to becoming a reality with Daniels reportedly assembling a writers room to develop a new take on the property. Universal Television, who was responsible for producing the original show, has declined to comment. Furthermore, at this stage, no network or streaming platform is attached to the project.


 What We Know About The Office Revival 
         

Rumors of a potential reboot or revival of The Office first began to circulate following comments made by NBCUniversal&#39;s Vice Chairman Bonnie Hammer in 2019 about wanting to reboot the series for Peacock. However, shortly following those original comments, Daniels himself expressed doubts about the chance of a reboot being possible and as recently as November 20223 categorically said “the notion of a reboot is not of interest”.




                  The Office’s 8 Biggest Scandals Dunder Mifflin’s Doc Would’ve Exposed   There were countless scandals throughout The Office&#39;s nine seasons that could have been exposed by the Dunder Mifflin documentary if it was released.    

Instead, Daniels suggested that he would be potentially interested in creating a spin-off show set in the same universe as the original. Raising the possibility of the same “documentary crew doing a documentary about a different subject”, his comments might suggest that the newest iteration of The Office may not return to the Scranton branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company or its eclectic group of office workers.

Yet whether or not Daniels’ new take on The Office will introduce viewers to a whole new workplace, there is still considerable interest in seeing several original characters return. With several cast members of The Office, including John Krasinski and Rainn Wilson, expressing their interest in revisiting the show, it is possible a string of cameo appearances could help connect the two shows together. While it is still very early days, the prospects of The Office’s triumphant return are looking increasingly brighter.
