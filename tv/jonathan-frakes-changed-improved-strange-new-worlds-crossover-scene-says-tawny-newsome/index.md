## Literature Review
Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; Tawny Newsome dropped a behind-the-scenes tidbit about how Jonathan Frakes improved a Strange New Worlds crossover scene.




Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; Tawny Newsome shares a behind-the-scenes tidbit about director Jonathan Frakes changing and improving a scene in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&#39; crossover episode. Newsome and Jack Quaid brought their Lower Decks Ensigns, Beckett Mariner and Bradward Boimler, to live-action in Strange New Worlds&#39; crossover, and Mariner got to meet and encourage her hero, Ensign Nyota Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding).




Strange New Worlds&#39; crossover has been lauded as one of the best TV episodes of 2023, and Tawny Newsome shared an Instagram Story thanking Strange New Pod (@strangenewpod) for naming her and Mariner Star Trek Collective Actress and Character of the Year. Tawny also added how director Jonathan Frakes changed Mariner&#39;s scene with Uhura and that &#34;he was correct&#34; to do so. Check out Newsome&#39;s post below:

          

Frakes eliminating snacks from Uhura and Mariner&#39;s scene not only allowed the emphasis to be on the characters, but the very next scene had Mariner bring Uhura to the Port Galley to serve her and Lt. Erica Ortegas (Melissa Navia) Orion Hurricanes. Two scenes in a row of the characters eating and drinking in different locations would have been redundant.

 Star Trek: Strange New Worlds &amp; Star Trek: Lower Decks Will Be Back With New Seasons 
But will there be another crossover?
         

There is no indication that another crossover between Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Star Trek: Lower Decks will happen, but both Star Trek series will be back with new seasons. Lower Decks season 5 is in production, with screenplays completed and the cast recording their dialogue as the animation team works to make the animated series&#39; traditional late summer/early fall release date on Paramount&#43;. Meanwhile, Strange New Worlds season 3 commenced filming in December, and production is expected to last until May 2024. The likely release date for Strange New Worlds season 3 will be in 2025, but fans can&#39;t help but hope to see the new episodes as soon as possible.




Jonathan Frakes will also be back to direct an episode of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, although it isn&#39;t known which episode Frakes is helming. Jonathan&#39;s next Star Trek directing gig is Star Trek: Discovery season 5, as he directed the penultimate episode titled &#34;Lagrange Point,&#34; which is the first half of Discovery&#39;s 2-part series finale. Frakes is perhaps the most popular director among the Star Trek casts, and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&#39; Anson Mount, Rebecca Romihn, and Ethan Peck have said the crossover wouldn&#39;t have worked without Frakes&#39; style, sense of humor, and proficiency with actors. Tawny Newsome would surely back that assessment up.



Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
