# Bridgerton Season 2 Ignoring This Couple s Breakup Was A Huge Missed Opportunity


## SUMMARY 



  Benedict and Genevieve&#39;s relationship was never concluded, leaving their storyline unresolved and unimportant to the overall plot.   The missed opportunity for drama between Benedict and Genevieve could have added depth to Benedict&#39;s character and given him more to do.   The show could have explored class issues through Benedict and Genevieve&#39;s relationship, offering a different perspective on the theme that has been previously addressed in the series.

## Literature Review
Benedict and Genevieve did not have an especially deep relationship in Bridgerton, but glossing over their bond was a big mistake for the series.




In Bridgerton season 1, Benedict Bridgerton and the modiste Genevieve Delacroix had a casual relationship that the series never actually concluded, and ultimately, this was a big mistake for the show. Bridgerton is a period romance series with two seasons on Netflix, and based on novels by Julia Quinn. The show follows the Bridgerton family during the Regency Era in England. Each season centers on one of the eight Bridgerton siblings as they find love during the social season. Bridgerton season 3 is set to be released in May and June of 2024.




Although the main focus of Bridgerton season 1 was Daphne Bridgerton and her enemies-to-lovers romance with the Duke, there were other romances taking place at the same time. For example, Anthony could not be with Siena Rosso, despite being desperately in love with her. But he wasn&#39;t the only Bridgerton brother maintaining a more physical relationship in the season. Benedict Bridgerton, the second eldest, had a notable relationship with Genevieve Delacroix, the modiste behind the ladies&#39; beautiful dresses. However, as much as this relationship existed, the series never really saw it end.



Although Benedict&#39;s story is the third of Julia Quinn&#39;s novels, Netflix skipped over his story in favor of Colin and Penelope. Presumably, Benedict&#39;s love story will come in season 4 or 5.





 Bridgerton Season 2 Never Really Addressed Genevieve &amp; Benedict&#39;s Split 
          




Despite the fact that Bridgerton season 1 established a relationship between Benedict Bridgerton and Genevieve Delacroix, the series never actually saw the relationship conclude in any way. While the two were definitely sleeping together in season 1, their connection is never mentioned in Bridgerton season 2. In fact, it is just generally assumed that the relationship ended off-screen, leaving Benedict free for his Bridgerton love story. All in all, this insinuates that Benedict and Genevieve&#39;s relationship was unimportant to the plot, and more than anything, was for fun rather than actual romantic purposes.

But even then, the lack of clarity from Bridgerton is slightly disconcerting. It is clear that Benedict is something of a rake like his brother Anthony, so his casual bond with Genevieve makes sense. Plus, throughout Bridgerton seasons 1 and 2, Benedict has never really shown signs of wanting to settle down, instead pursuing his art and his most base desires. However, because Genevieve is a recurring character, it is strange that the series never thought to give the two a clear ending. In many ways, brushing over the issue was a missed opportunity.






 Bridgerton Wasted An Opportunity For More Drama Between The Pair 
         

Because Bridgerton never saw an official end to Benedict and Genevieve&#39;s relationship, the show missed the opportunity for more drama for the second eldest Bridgerton. In general, Benedict and Genvieve&#39;s relationship was lowkey and unproblematic, portrayed as more of a fun affair than a genuine connection. However, that does not mean that their bond had to end in a similar way. Bridgerton could have included moments of discontent between them that would at least explain why they ended their tryst. This potential disagreement between them would have added to the drama of whatever season it happened in, and would have given Benedict a bit more to do.

Compared to the other Bridgerton siblings, Benedict is particularly laidback and unconcerned with the plot. For the most part, his storylines add more fun and intrigue as opposed to problems and drama. However, if the series had given a dramatic explanation for his break with Genevieve, this would have been different. For once, Benedict&#39;s actions could have made an impact on the plot. Not only could he have hurt someone that he had a relationship with, but Genevieve is particularly important. She is one of the first people to figure out that Penelope is Lady Whistledown. This most definitely could have come into play between Benedict and Genevieve.






 The Netflix Show Could Have Used Benedict &amp; Genevieve To Address Class Issues 
          

One obvious way that Bridgerton could have used to explain Benedict and Genevieve&#39;s break-up was class issues. So far, both Anthony and Eloise have faced this problem with their respective love interests, so it would make sense that Benedict would run into it too. Because Genevieve is a modiste, and not part of the upper class like the Bridgertons, her relationship with Benedict would eventually have to end. This could have led to an argument between the two which led to their break-up. However, because the issue has come up so often in Bridgerton, Benedict and Genvieve&#39;s situation could have shown a new side to it.

While Anthony knew that he could never be with Siena because of his duties, Eloise was left disappointed by Theo Sharpe because she did not understand his situation, perhaps Benedict could have told a different story. Unlike his siblings, maybe Benedict could have been willing to shirk his responsibilities as a wealthy person to continue seeing Genevieve. Maybe his bohemian lifestyle would make their class issues a more artistic, melancholy break-up rather than a dramatic one. Either way, Bridgerton dropped the ball when it glossed over this Benedict plot point.
