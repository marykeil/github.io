Summary

  The Mandalorian season 4 has already been written, indicating that the show will continue to explore plot points from the canceled series Rangers of the New Republic.   Din Djarin will unofficially serve the New Republic as a bounty hunter, hunting down Imperial warlords in the Outer Rim.   The Mandalorian season 4 is likely to focus on Din Djarin taking down Imperial Remnants and potentially leading him to discover Grand Admiral Thrawn, setting up his involvement in future Star Wars films.  







The final scenes of The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 seemingly confirm that Din Djarin will serve as a replacement for Cara Dune in a previously canceled Star Wars show. After putting an end to Moff Gideon&#39;s cloning plans and destroying his base on Mandalore, Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin was shown in an epilogue of sorts, rounding out his and Grogu&#39;s story for the season. One of these scenes involved Din reuniting with Paul Sun-Hyung Lee&#39;s Carson Teva, in a conversation that hinted at the potential story for The Mandalorian season 4.

As reported by Variety, writer and co-creator of the show Jon Favreau revealed that The Mandalorian season 4 has already been written. This means that the ending of The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 was all intentionally placed to lead into future stories set in this sect of the Star Wars universe. With the one scene with Carson Teva, The Mandalorian has all but confirmed that the show&#39;s next outing will be delving even further into the plot points originally intended for one of Star Wars&#39; canceled TV shows.





 Din Djarin Has Effectively Become A Ranger, Hunting Imperial Warlords 
This Would Have Been The Focus Of Rangers of The New Republic
         

The canceled TV show in question is Rangers of the New Republic, which was rumored to focus on the exploits of Cara Dune as a newly-anointed New Republic marshal. However, after Gina Corano was fired from Lucasfilm, the show was seemingly scrapped. Despite the show&#39;s cancelation, The Mandalorian season 3 incorporated some of the elements intended for Rangers of the New Republic into its story, through the subplots of Elia Kane, Dr. Pershing, and Carson Teva. With Mando&#39;s visit to the Adelphi bar filled with Easter eggs in Mandalorian season 3, episode 8, The Mandalorian season 4 is now confirmed to even further cover these canned plot points.

As per the conversation with Carson Teva, Din Djarin is reverting to his bounty hunting ways - only this time, with a twist. After his feud with Moff Gideon and the Empire, Mando told Teva that he will unofficially serve the New Republic, attempting to hunt down Imperial warlords in the Outer Rim. The tentative bond that has been set up between Teva and Mando across three seasons of The Mandalorian means the former likes the idea of the deal, setting up The Mandalorian season 4 as the pseudo-Rangers of the New Republic.

 Rangers Of The New Republic&#39;s Subplots Must Feature In The Mandalorian Season 4 
Din Djarin Should Take On The Imperial Remnants
          

The core plot of Rangers of the New Republic was expected to center on the titular organization discovering that the Imperial Remnants were more coherent than first thought. Therefore, The Mandalorian season 4 must include the same plot. The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7 already established the Shadow Council that is serving Thrawn as a means of restoring the Empire&#39;s power, something that eventually transforms into both the First Order and Final Order from the sequel trilogy. This means that the story of The Mandalorian season 4 should be about Din Djarin taking down these Imperial Remnants, which would benefit the overarching story of this section of the Star Wars timeline.




If this was to be the case, it would set Din Djarin and Grogu up to be part of Filoni&#39;s newly-announced Star Wars film. The film is set to culminate the story of The Mandalorian and its respective spin-offs, likely in a battle between the New Republic and Grand Admiral Thrawn. If The Mandalorian season 4 does indeed feature Mando thwarting the Empire&#39;s plans and potentially leading him to discover Thrawn himself, it would position the story of the show to not only incorporate Rangers of the New Republic elements, but perfectly set up Din Djarin&#39;s theatrical debut in the process.



 How The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Will Impact The Mandalorian TV Show 
The New Movie Will Likely Replace Season 4
          

The biggest Star Wars news of 2024 so far is the announcement that Din Djarin will be coming to the big screen, with the announcement of a new movie: The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. The movie will be spun off from The Mandalorian season 3, and Jon Favreau is helming the project. Few other details about the project have been confirmed, including its official impact on the next season of The Mandalorian as a TV show, however, there is a good chance that the movie is going to replace season 4 of the show entirely. 




Favreau had already written the scripts for season 4, but it&#39;s likely that he will re-write these for the movie, with the movie coming out before a new season of the show. What this means is that Din Djarin&#39;s storyline against the Imperial Remnants will play out on the big screen - marking another shift for the subplots that were originally planned as part of a different TV show. However, at this point, it is still early days for news about the movie - and without a release date confirmed or an official explanation of how the films will tie into the show (and whether they will exist at the same time, or the movie will replace the series permanently), it&#39;s impossible to say exactly how this will play out. 



All episodes of The Mandalorian are now available on Disney&#43;.
