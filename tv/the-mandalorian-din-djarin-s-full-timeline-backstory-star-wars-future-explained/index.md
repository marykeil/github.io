                  Star Wars&#39; Mandalorian Timeline &amp; History Explained   As the greatest warriors in the Star Wars galaxy, Mandalorians have a rich and expanding history, and this is their full timeline in canon explained.    


 Din Djarin&#39;s Backstory 
Born &amp; Raised On Aq Vetina
          




At some point not long before the Clone Wars, Din Djarin is born on the planet of Aq Vetina. He&#39;s raised by his parents on their homeworld in the Outer Rim, with their family of three living in peace for many years. Presumably around the end of the Clone Wars, or 19 BBY, Aq Vetina falls under attack by Separatists, causing Din&#39;s parents to be killed while saving him from B2-series super battle droids - thus forever instilling Din&#39;s hatred of their kind.

Rescued By The Mandalorians
          

Din&#39;s also nearly killed by these battle droids until the Mandalorians rescue him. A faction of Death Watch, now known as the Children of the Watch, arrive on Aq Vetina just in time to save Din from the droid attack. His Mandalorian savior is directed to take him from the planet to safety, thus making Din a Mandalorian foundling.




Raised On Concordia In The Fighting Corps
          

Din is brought to the Children of the Watch&#39;s tribe on the Mandalorian moon of Concordia, where he goes on to swear the Mandalorian Creed under the Way of the Mand&#39;alor and earns his Mandalorian helmet. After embarking on his apprentice journeys with his mentor, Din is raised in the Mandalorian Fighting Corps. Amidst his learning, Din trains in the Rising Phoenix, thus helping him to earn a jetpack later on in his life. Din becomes one of the covert&#39;s strongest warriors, earning him various unique roles within his tribe.

Working With Ranzar Malk&#39;s Mercenary Gang
          




At some point between his training and the events of The Mandalorian season 1, Din works with Ranzar &#34;Ran&#34; Malk&#39;s mercenary gang, running jobs out of Ran&#39;s space station, the Roost. The group embarks on dangerous yet profitable jobs for what Din considers to be &#34;target practice,&#34; with one job in particular on Alzoc III truly marking Din&#39;s brutality as a Mandalorian warrior. At some point, Din breaks away from the group in a less-than-amicable way, leaving the remaining members of the gang to feel betrayed as he builds up his solo bounty hunting reputation instead.

                  The Mandalorian Cast &amp; Characters Guide   The Mandalorian has created a long list of new Star Wars characters and brought back some familiar ones, with an incredible cast to match.    

The Great Purge Of Mandalore
          




Between the end of the Galactic Civil War in 5 ABY and the start of The Mandalorian in 9 ABY, Mandalore is devastated in the Great Purge of Mandalore. The Empire, under the command of Moff Gideon, releases fusion bombs upon Mandalore&#39;s surface, turning the planet to glass and killing thousands of Mandalorians in the process. Din and his tribe being cloistered on the moon of Concordia is what saves them, but this event causes them and all other survivors to flee into hiding throughout the Outer Rim of the galaxy.



 Din Djarin In The Mandalorian (&amp; More) 
The Mandalorian Season 1: Meeting &amp; Protecting Grogu
         

In 9 ABY, Din&#39;s in the prime of his bounty hunting career when he&#39;s offered a direct commission from an Imperial warlord on Nevarro. This dangerous job leads him to Grogu, a 50-year-old child of Yoda&#39;s species. When Grogu uses the Force to save Din&#39;s life from a mudhorn, he experiences a change in heart and betrays both the Bounty Hunter&#39;s Guild and the Imperial warlord to save Grogu.




The two spend months on the run, jumping between planets such as Sorgan and Tatooine and even reuniting with Ran&#39;s gang before they ultimately return to Nevarro to face the Imperials once and for all. Din unites with unexpected allies Greef Karga, Cara Dune, Kuiil, and IG-11 to take down the warlord, just to discover Moff Gideon is the one behind it all. Gideon nearly captures Grogu and almost kills Din, causing IG-11 to remove Din&#39;s helmet to save him with a bacta spray. Afterward, Din gains his mudhorn signet and is quested by the Armorer to reunite Grogu with the Jedi, and he embarks on this quest after he defeats Gideon by taking down his TIE fighter.

                  The Mandalorian: Grogu&#39;s Identity, Backstory, and Future Explained   Introduced as Baby Yoda, Grogu is the emotional heart of The Mandalorian. Here&#39;s everything Star Wars has revealed about Grogu to date.    

The Mandalorian Season 2: The Quest For Jedi
         




Din and Grogu traverse the galaxy looking for the Jedi, embarking on many adventures to gain information about Grogu&#39;s kind. Upon meeting Bo-Katan Kryze, Din realizes there are Mandalorians who don&#39;t adhere to the Way of the Mand&#39;alor, creating a rift between them. Still, after receiving his help on a mission, Bo-Katan guides Din to the Jedi Ahsoka Tano on the planet of Corvus. Din helps Ahsoka defeat the planet&#39;s cruel magistrate in hopes of her agreeing to train Grogu, but she refuses due to the child&#39;s strong attachment to Din, instead sending the pair to the planet Tython for Grogu to choose his own path.

Moff Gideon, having survived their last encounter, catches up with Din on Tython and destroys his Razor Crest gunship, taking Grogu and leaving him trapped with Boba Fett and Fennec Shand. Din and his new team of allies journey to an Imperial refinery on Morak to gain the coordinates to Gideon&#39;s light cruiser, where Din breaks his Mandalorian Creed by removing his helmet to scan his face at an Imperial terminal. With the help of Bo-Katan, Din and his allies infiltrate Gideon&#39;s cruiser, and Din not only rescues Grogu but also accidentally wins the Darksaber. Din, however, has to give Grogu away to the Jedi Luke Skywalker when he arrives, leading Din to break his Creed once more by showing the foundling his face.




The Book Of Boba Fett: Life Without Grogu
         

Din tries to return to his life of bounty hunting, but a self-inflicted Darksaber wound proves his struggle. He reunites with the Armorer and Paz Vizsla on the Glavis Ringworld, though his time with them doesn&#39;t last long. After getting armor made for Grogu, Paz challenges Din to a duel for the Darksaber, and though Din&#39;s victorious, the Armorer learns of him breaking his Creed and excommunicates him from the tribe.

Din heads to Tatooine to buy a replacement for his Razor Crest, fixing up an old Naboo N-1 starfighter with Peli Motto before Fennec Shand asks for his help in her and Boba Fett&#39;s war against the Pykes. Din agrees, but first attempts to reunite with Grogu on the planet of Ossus, where he&#39;s turned away by Ahsoka Tano. Din returns to Tatooine and helps his allies, and Grogu soon appears after choosing to stay with Din rather than pursue his Jedi training. After the battle, the two depart Tatooine, beginning Din&#39;s quest for redemption.




The Mandalorian Season 3: Redemption &amp; Reclaiming Mandalore
         

Din and Grogu head to Mandalore so that Din may be redeemed in the Living Waters beneath the planet&#39;s mines. While navigating the mines, Din is captured by a cyborg creature, causing Grogu to seek Bo-Katan for help. Din is rescued by Bo-Katan twice over, with her also helping him after he nearly drowns in the Living Waters. TIE interceptors pursue them as they leave Mandalore, and when they destroy Bo-Katan&#39;s castle on the planet of Kalevala, Din takes her back to the covert - earning redemption for both of them.

After living amongst the covert and saving Nevarro from a pirate siege, Din helps Bo-Katan unite the Mandalorians to retake Mandalore once and for all. He confronts battle droids while assisting with a droid investigation on the planet Plazir-15, just before he reveals to Bo-Katan she earned the Darksaber from him back on Mandalore. While scouting the surface of the planet, Din is captured in Moff Gideon&#39;s secret base, but he&#39;s rescued with Grogu&#39;s help. The two of them, along with Bo-Katan, at last defeat Moff Gideon, liberating Mandalore and heralding a new age. Din officially adopts Grogu as his own and returns to Nevarro to live on a tract of land offered to them by Greef Karga, lying low before embarking on Grogu&#39;s apprentice journeys.




                  The Mandalorian Season 3 Ending Explained   The Mandalorian season 3 has come to an end with an action-packed finale, complete with more than a few surprise twists and teases for the future.    



 Din Djarin&#39;s Future 
Working For The New Republic
          

Din has struck a deal with the New Republic ranger Captain Carson Teva, agreeing to hunt Imperials under-the-table as contracted &#34;bounty hunting&#34; work. This will see Din and Grogu hunting down and fighting against Imperial Remnants throughout the galaxy in The Mandalorian season 4, mostly as a part of Grogu&#39;s apprentice journeys. Between adventures, Din and Grogu will be lying low in their home on Nevarro, and surely visiting Bo-Katan and the Mandalorians as they rebuild their homeworld.

Training &amp; Raising Grogu
          




Grogu, as Din&#39;s adopted son and apprentice under the name of &#34;Din Grogu,&#34; will officially be trained as a Mandalorian. Just like his mentor once did for him, Din will be taking Grogu on his apprentice journeys, training him under the Way of the Mand&#39;alor. Hopefully, Din&#39;s training and encouragement will lead to Grogu at last being able to speak, and he&#39;ll get to witness Grogu speak the Creed earn his Mandalorian helmet.

Joining The Fight Against Thrawn
          

Din, now solidified as one of Star Wars&#39; most important heroes, is only intertwining himself more within the web of greater galactic conflicts. Another war is brewing now that Grand Admiral Thrawn has returned from his extragalactic exile, and there&#39;s no doubt Din&#39;s hunts of the Imperials will get him roped up in whatever schemes Thrawn is planning. It&#39;s expected that Din will help other heroes, such as Bo-Katan, Ahsoka, and more, fight against Thrawn whenever the time comes, and there&#39;s no doubt Thrawn will prove to be more than a formidable foe even for a seasoned warrior like Din - whether they meet in the future of The Mandalorian or beyond.
