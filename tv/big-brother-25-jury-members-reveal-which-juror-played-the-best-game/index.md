# Big Brother 25 Jury Members Reveal Which Juror Played The Best Game


## SUMMARY 



  The Big Brother 25 jury members have praised each other&#39;s gameplay, with many choosing Cory Wurtenberger as the best player due to his solid mental game and ability to manipulate others.   Felicia Cannon believes she played the best game because she stayed true to herself, trusted in God, and treated everyone with respect, while Blue Kim admired Cirie Fields&#39; ability to make it far without winning competitions.   While Cory had a strong strategic game, his lack of competition wins limited his direct power, but his success in making it far without winning is impressive. Cameron Hardin, who wasn&#39;t mentioned by the jury, has the strongest resume with multiple competition wins and surviving nominations.

## Literature Review
The Big Brother 25 jury members will choose the winner of the game, but they also have praise for each other. Find out who they say played the best.




The Big Brother season 25 jury members may not have won the game, but they have a lot of praise for each other&#39;s gameplay throughout the season. The Big Brother 25 jury will be made up of Cameron Hardin, Cory Wurtenberger, Blue Kim, America Lopez, Cirie Fields, Felicia Cannon, and whichever houseguest is evicted on finale night (either Jag Bains, Bowie Jane, or Matt Klotz). Reduced to seven members from nine as a nod to earlier seasons of the show, the jury will choose the winner of the $750,000 grand prize on finale night.




In an interview with EW, many of the Big Brother 25 jury members chose Cory as the juror who was the best player. Cameron said that Cory &#34;played a pretty solid mental game,&#34; and he would’ve been more of a problem if he had &#34;more of a physical competitive component.&#34; America stated that Cory &#34;made alliances, he made deals, broke promises, lied—all this stuff that is just classic Big Brother.&#34; Cirie said that Cory &#34;was able to manipulate a bunch of the houseguests to get his targets out of the house.&#34; Cory chose himself but also picked America because she made it to the Final 6.

 Big Brother 25&#39;s Felicia Cannon Claims She Played The Best Game 
          

Felicia felt that she played best because of her &#34;honest game.&#34; She said, &#34;I tried to genuinely be me through the whole game.&#34; Felicia added that she &#34;trusted in God to carry me, and I showed that I wasn&#39;t afraid to show that I had a faith higher than the game.&#34; Felicia also pointed out that she talked to everybody based on who they were, not just when they were in power. She said, &#34;I felt like you&#39;ve got to treat people the way you want to be treated.&#34; Blue chose Cirie because she felt that Cirie didn&#39;t have to win competitions to make it as far as she did.





 

It&#39;s interesting that so many of the Big Brother 25 jury members chose Cory as the best player among them. He definitely had a strong strategic game, but he only won one competition, which was the Head of Household (HOH) competition during the first double eviction. While competition wins aren&#39;t everything because Big Brother is, at its core, a social game, Cory rarely had the power to put forth his plans directly. His showmance and number one ally, America, never won a competition, so they were constantly playing a game of defense rather than offense. However, the fact that they made it as far as they did without winning is very impressive.

None of the Big Brother 25 jury members mentioned Cameron as the best player, but he has the strongest resume of them all. Cameron not only won three HOH and two Power of Veto competitions, but he also resurrected his game by winning both the Resurrection Rumble and Do or Die competitions. He was on the chopping block five times and was able to survive four of those nominations. In fact, it wasn&#39;t until after Cameron was evicted that Jag won most of his competitions. Hopefully, there will be another all-stars season someday and the Big Brother 25 jury members can play again because there are many new legends among them.




The Big Brother season 25 finale airs Thursday, November 9, at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
