## Literature Review
During his second date with Christine Brown, David Woolley used an shocking word to describe notorious Sister Wives cast member Kody Brown.




Christine Brown’s new husband, David Woolley, referred to Sister Wives star Kody Brown as a &#34;dumb***.&#34; Kody and Christine were once very much into each other. However, things changed when the polygamous man married Robyn Brown and began putting all his effort into her. In 2021, she took a big step after she grew tired of her relationship with Kody. Christine ended her plural marriage and started finding her true soulmate. Christine and David tied the knot in October 2023 after she went public with the relationship back in February. She also invited him to support her during Sister Wives season 18&#39;s One On One.




Recently, Christine talked to People and revealed some interesting facts about David. She shared that he had been open with her from the get-go and had expressed his honest opinions. The mom of six said that it was their second date when David shared his real feelings about Kody. She said, “I blurted out everything and I told him about the show,” adding that the conversation led David to call Kody a “dumb***.” Christine claimed, “He knew of the show, yes. But he would rather not be on the show.”


 David Woolley Thought Christine Was A Catfish At First 
          

David has also shared his views of Christine. During the Sister Wives: One on One, he revealed he wasn’t even sure about Christine initially because he thought someone was catfishing him. He shared that his family members also felt it was impossible for such a popular reality TV star to date him randomly. David claimed his daughter was skeptical, but things eventually played out fine. David fell for Christine during their second date on his birthday. He took her to a play, where he realized that she was “passionate about life.”





 

Christine and Kody were never a good couple to begin with. While they were married for nearly three decades, they didn’t share a romantic chemistry. Kody was only ever compatible with Robyn, who was submissive and ideal for his behavior. Even now, Kody and Robyn are a good fit because they balance out each other. Christine was always independent, like other sister wives such as Janelle Brown. She was self-sufficient and didn’t depend on Kody. Therefore, Kody never loved her or Janelle as much as he cared for Robyn.

Christine’s bond with David is special. The 51-year-old reality star was polygamous for such a long time that she never realized how good it can feel to be in a caring relationship. Now Christine can feel real happiness. She can experience what a marriage is supposed to be because David is her ideal husband. Christine has struggled far too much for far too long on Sister Wives. She deserves to be happy, and David is her answer. The best part is Christine never has to justify her past to her new husband. He knows the Sister Wives cast member inside out and loves her for who she is.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
