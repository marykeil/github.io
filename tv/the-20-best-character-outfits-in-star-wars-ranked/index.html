  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Star Wars has a long list of eclectic and vibrant costumes, with 20 outfits that stand out among the rest.
The retrofuturism of the Star Wars universe leads to creative and eccentric style choices, especially among species and groups like Jedi, Sith, and Mandalorians.
These Star Wars outfits are ones with not only a big cultural impact, but also a key significance within their respective Star Wars contexts, becoming both memorable and iconic.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Star Wars franchise has had some excellent costuming as far back as the 70s, but 20 outfits in particular stand out as the galaxy&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>Star Wars has had eclectic, vibrant costumes since its inception in 1977, but these 20 character outfits beat out all the rest. Originally billed as a space opera, Star Wars was, by necessity, full of unique, alien outfits from the very beginning. As the galaxy grew and was further developed throughout the Star Wars timeline in the prequel and sequel trilogies, and now additional spin-off shows and movies, the long list of stellar costumes has only grown.
Despite being a long time ago, Star Wars is marked by a retrofuturism that has led to a number of creative, eccentric outfits. With the creation of a number of species and groups, including Jedi, Sith, and Mandalorians, innumerable style choices have had to be made, and they only seem to become more fun as the world-building is expanded. Although a tough call, 20 outfits from across the franchise nevertheless stand head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
<p>How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.</p>
<p>20  Finn&rsquo;s (Poe&rsquo;s) Leather Jacket
Star Wars: The Force Awakens</p>
<p>Finn and Poe&rsquo;s friendship is excellent from the beginning, with Poe immediately spotting that Finn&rsquo;s offer to help him escape is really self-serving, but their best moment is when Poe sees that Finn is wearing his jacket. Surely, Finn takes the jacket to honor Poe, whom he believes died in their TIE fighter crash (it definitely wasn&rsquo;t needed on the desert planet of Jakku), so when he sees him alive, he starts to take it off to give it back. When Poe sees him do so, he says, &ldquo;Keep it; it suits you.&rdquo;
This is such a precious moment between the two, and it&rsquo;s a reminder throughout the sequels that the two are really this trilogy&rsquo;s best friendship. It&rsquo;s also reminiscent of Han Solo, which makes sense, given that Poe takes on that role in the sequel movies and remains a nice on-screen homage to him throughout these last few Skywalker saga movies. While the sequel films are inarguably the least focused on fashion, this jacket is nevertheless one of the best in Star Wars.</p>
<p>19  Kylo Ren&rsquo;s Masked Outfit
Star Wars: The Force Awakens</p>
<p>Kylo Ren&rsquo;s mask is one of the other few Star Wars sequel movies&rsquo; inclusions on this list. Kylo Ren has a very complicated relationship with his mask, with Snoke rubbing a bit of salt in the wound after Kylo loses to Rey by calling him &ldquo;a child in a mask,&rdquo; but it nevertheless makes up his best look in the franchise. In particular, in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, before he smashes it and then puts it back together, the mask is intimidating, modulating his voice and concealing who or what lies beneath.
In The Force Awakens, Kylo remains a faceless threat for the first two-thirds of the movie, and while it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s modeled his look after Darth Vader (even before it&rsquo;s revealed that he&rsquo;s Vader&rsquo;s grandson), the helmet makes him so much scarier. Once it&rsquo;s revealed that he&rsquo;s a young, even boyish, human, Kylo becomes less threatening. Under the mask, however, he&rsquo;s impenetrable, and it&rsquo;s clear in The Force Awakens that Rey feels the same; her entire disposition toward him changes when she sees what he really looks like.</p>
<p>18  Luke&rsquo;s Farmer Robes
A New Hope</p>
<p>Although Luke Skywalker becomes a powerful Jedi Master, his innocent farm boy look in A New Hope is one of his best. It&rsquo;s also a bit ironic because this outfit is very similar to Jedi robes, nodding to his future. Other than young Anakin in The Phantom Menace, it&rsquo;s difficult to think of a more innocent leading character than Luke in Star Wars&rsquo; first movie, who is, at the time, little more than a teenager who navigates the galaxy with wonder and awe. While it&rsquo;s thrilling to see Luke develop into a true Jedi, this outfit spurs on nostalgia.</p>
<p>17  Sith Rey&rsquo;s Robes
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</p>
<p>Despite her iconic triple bun hairstyle, Rey&rsquo;s best look so far in Star Wars is one that never really came to be: her Sith robes. After seeing Rey as such a powerful light side user, it was a shock (but an exciting one) when she saw herself as a Sith in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. In addition to her double-bladed red lightsaber and razor-sharp teeth, Rey&rsquo;s robes in this scene demonstrate just how terrifying she could have been had she joined Kylo Ren on the dark side of the Force.</p>
<p>16  Han Solo&rsquo;s Original Outfit
A New Hope</p>
<p>The classics always deserve respect, and Han Solo&rsquo;s first outfit is no exception. When Han is introduced in A New Hope, he has a suave, devil-may-care demeanor, a bit of an anomaly in the franchise. Even Poe Dameron, who goes on to fill the Han role in the sequel trilogy, can&rsquo;t really match Han&rsquo;s rugged style in the first Star Wars movie. This is, of course, in large part due to Harrison Ford, who had a very similar aesthetic and attitude in his real life.</p>
<p>15  Boba Fett&rsquo;s Armor
Return of the Jedi</p>
<p>While a certain Mandalorian has crowded him out somewhat in the franchise, Boba Fett donned the original Mandalorian armor in Star Wars, and, like Han Solo, he deserves a spot on this list for that reason. Boba Fett&rsquo;s vibrant green and red armor is also a bit more colorful than other examples of Mandalorian armor, which is somewhat surprising given his severe, dry manner, beginning when he was a child in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Regardless, when Boba Fett arrived on the scene during the original trilogy, his armor became iconic.</p>
<p>14  Queen Amidala&rsquo;s Throne Room Gown
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</p>
<p>Padmé is a key figure on this list, and her iconic Queen Amidala throne room gown from Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace makes it clear why. Padmé&rsquo;s complete wardrobe is largely unmatched in Star Wars, but that&rsquo;s not solely for fashion&rsquo;s sake. The series of three canonical Star Wars novels about Padmé explains why her clothing is so important. The Queen&rsquo;s Shadow, the first novel of the three, reveals that Padmé and her handmaidens used outfits, hair, and makeup almost as a weapon.
Purchase The Queen&rsquo;s Shadow by E.K. Johnston on Amazon
As was on display during their Queen switch in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, heavy makeup and distracting hair and outfits allowed the handmaidens to take Padmé&rsquo;s place unnoticed, keeping her safe. This means that, while regal (and fashionable), the deep red gown, elaborate crown of hair, and striking makeup the Queen wears are meant to act as a disguise in case one of her handmaidens needs to take her place. This outfit also makes clear from the beginning that Padmé is a powerful, pivotal character in the franchise.</p>
<p>The 10 Best Padme Amidala Outfits, Ranked
Padmé Amidala one of the best characters in the Star Wars prequel era, most notably because of her sense of fashion. Here are her 10 best outfits.</p>
<p>13  Little Leia&rsquo;s Alderaan Outfit
Obi-Wan Kenobi</p>
<p>One of the best surprises of the Obi-Wan Kenobi series—perhaps usurped only by the encounters between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan—was that the focus was not on young Luke Skywalker, as much of the advertising suggested, but on young Leia. With this choice, audiences got to see Alderaan and finally got to see Leia interact with her adoptive parents. This is perhaps best reflected in Leia&rsquo;s first outfit in the series.
In the original trilogy, all Star Wars showed about Leia&rsquo;s parents (who are later revealed to be adoptive) was that they tragically died along with the planet of Alderaan at the hands of the Empire. The prequel trilogy fleshed them out somewhat, though Bail Organa in particular, but Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith only shows Bail and Breha Organa holding Leia. Obi-Wan Kenobi depicted the family in much greater detail, including in an emotional scene where Bail tells Leia she is an Organa in every way.
Leia&rsquo;s appearance in the first episode is a perfect representation of that. With this outfit, Leia is representing her connection to Alderaan, showing herself as a true princess of the planet. Leia&rsquo;s status as a princess is heavily referenced throughout the franchise, but that role on the planet gets so little screen time, making this outfit critical and so much more than just a fashion choice. That it ties into her relationship with Bail so directly makes it all the better.</p>
<p>12  Padmé&rsquo;s Jubilation Gown
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</p>
<p>Padmé continues to be a front-runner on this list due to her elaborate outfits and their significance in the scenes in which they appear. While Padmé&rsquo;s outfits in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith are the most iconic and reproduced for cosplays and in art, her Jubilation dress at the end of The Phantom Menace has just as much impact. In fact, this scene is too often overlooked; it repeats the celebration scene at the end of A New Hope so clearly, and it demonstrates how close Palpatine, who stands to the side, really was to Anakin and Padmé. It&rsquo;s also just a beautiful dress and a fun look.</p>
<p>11  Leia&rsquo;s Iconic White Gown (With Two Hair Buns)
A New Hope</p>
<p>Like mother, like daughter, and Leia and Padmé dominate the list for that reason. Like Padmé&rsquo;s best outfits, Leia&rsquo;s first outfit in A New Hope is perhaps her most iconic, although this prominence is as much about the hair as it is about the outfit. Leia&rsquo;s twin hair buns have become a staple of the Leia aesthetic, and they are reminiscent of the elaborate hair choices Padmé makes throughout the prequel movies. It&rsquo;s also the outfit Leia wears during her &ldquo;Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi; you&rsquo;re my only hope&rdquo; message, securing its spot as one of the 20 best outfits.</p>
<p>10  Padmé&rsquo;s Geonosis Outfit
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>While not nearly at the top of the list for Padmé&rsquo;s most elaborate fashion choices, her Geonosis outfit couldn&rsquo;t be left out of the top 20 at minimum because it&rsquo;s such an iconic Padmé look—maybe her most iconic. In addition to being a great choice for cosplay, though, this outfit also reveals how brave and capable Padmé really was. Although her bravery was on display during The Phantom Menace and has definitely since been fleshed out in The Clone Wars series, Revenge of the Sith relegates Padmé to the girlfriend and mother role a bit, as Padmé starting the Rebellion became a deleted scene.
In contrast, Padmé is her fiercest and most resourceful during the Geonosis scene when she, Anakin, and Obi-Wan are tied to poles, about to be mauled by various creatures. While Obi-Wan and Anakin banter, though, Padmé has climbed to the top of her pole, which earns her the slash to her back that slices her shirt from this outfit. Throughout the scene, she goes on to fight valiantly, making this one of her best scenes and, related, one of her best outfits.</p>
<p>9  Obi-Wan&rsquo;s Revenge of the Sith Jedi Robes
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Obi-Wan&rsquo;s appearance on Mustafar in Revenge of the Sith was inadvertently funny (why does he stand at the top of the steps with his hands on his hips for so long while Anakin chokes Padmé?), but it&rsquo;s also one of the best shots of his Jedi robes throughout the Star Wars franchise. Jedi robes are a staple of the prequels, which see many iterations for the individual Jedi, but Obi-Wan&rsquo;s are perhaps the best, this look in particular. It&rsquo;s also the outfit that is most often used for cosplays, art, and action figures, making it perhaps Obi-Wan&rsquo;s best-known look.</p>
<p>8  Anakin&rsquo;s Live-Action Clone Wars Outfit
Ahsoka</p>
<p>While Anakin donned this armor throughout the Clone Wars series, seeing it in live-action during the flashback scenes in Ahsoka episode 5 was absolutely thrilling. With surprising accuracy, Ahsoka recreated Anakin&rsquo;s look from the Clone Wars show, giving fans a glimpse into what a live-action Clone Wars series or movie could have looked like. This was also an excellent way to bring Hayden Christensen into that era, as he was not the voice of the Clone Wars Anakin. Because of its significance to the character and the Star Wars TV show, this outfit is high on the list.</p>
<p>7  Padmé&rsquo;s Lakeside Gown
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Many of Padmé&rsquo;s outfits on this list have to do with her strength or strategies throughout the original trilogy, but the ombré gown she wears on Naboo during Attack of the Clones earns a high spot on the list specifically for being stunning. This is easily one of Padmé&rsquo;s most beautiful looks in all of Star Wars, which is a hard-won accomplishment given the sheer number of outfits she wears and how detailed each one is. This is also the outfit she wears when she and Anakin share their first kiss and when Anakin delivers his infamous line about hating sand.</p>
<p>6  Lando Calrissian&rsquo;s Cape
The Empire Strikes Back</p>
<p>While Lando Calrissian&rsquo;s betrayal of Han Solo, Leia, and Chewbacca in The Empire Strikes Back is pretty egregious, he nevertheless remains a style icon in the original Star Wars trilogy, and he&rsquo;s surely redeemed himself by saving the Resistance in The Rise of Skywalker. Matching the aesthetic of Cloud City, Lando first appears in an almost regal blue cape, and, while cloaks are very common in Star Wars, capes are less so. Lando even keeps that fashion statement going, wearing a more subdued cape in Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>5  Padme&rsquo;s Wedding Dress
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Like her ombré lakeside gown, Padmé&rsquo;s wedding dress is beautiful, with a delicate lace not often seen in Star Wars. More than that, though, it&rsquo;s the only wedding dress in the whole franchise, marking it with great significance. It&rsquo;s also a symbol of a critical moment in the Skywalker saga. In fact, this dress represents an event that in some ways sets in motion all other events in Star Wars; it signifies the union between Anakin and Padmé, which ultimately leads Anakin to his obsession with keeping her alive, thereby creating Darth Vader.</p>
<p>4  Din Djarin&rsquo;s Mandalorian Armor
The Mandalorian</p>
<p>This titular Mandalorian of The Mandalorian series is precisely the character who steals Boba Fett&rsquo;s Star Wars spotlight, and for good reason. Din Djarin&rsquo;s Mandalorian armor has become absolutely iconic in the franchise, and not only because he keeps it on at all times (except for those two missteps). This armor reflects exactly what a Mandalorian should be, with its sleek design and classic &lsquo;T&rsquo; shape on the helmet. It&rsquo;s also become the easily identifiable outfit of one of the most prominent Star Wars fan favorites—perhaps the most successful live-action new addition other than Grogu.</p>
<p>8 Ways Din Djarin’s Armor Has Changed Since His Mandalorian Debut
Din Djarin’s armor in The Mandalorian has gone through several subtle change, each of which represent a milestone in his journey with Grogu.</p>
<p>3  Luke Skywalker&rsquo;s Rebel Pilot Suit
A New Hope</p>
<p>While Luke&rsquo;s farmer robes are certainly nostalgic, his Rebel pilot suit is his most iconic Star Wars outfit and easily the most fun stylistically. In fact, the clothing company Columbia recently sold versions of the pilot suit for a pretty penny, the most expensive of which was a Rebel pilot jacket signed by Mark Hamill himself. Just as noteworthy as the bright orange jumpsuit is the Rebel helmet, which sits front and center when Luke destroys the Death Star in A New Hope.</p>
<p>2  Ahsoka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ahsoka the White&rdquo; Outfit
Ahsoka</p>
<p>Although the most recent addition, Ahsoka&rsquo;s white outfit in the Ahsoka series easily secures a second-place spot on the list. In addition to being a beautiful play on the classic Jedi robes, this outfit reflects Ahsoka&rsquo;s critical transformation in the series, marking an incredible moment in her overall character arc. Before the Ahsoka show, Ahsoka still struggled with the loss in her past due to Order 66 and her intense feelings of guilt about Anakin&rsquo;s turn to Darth Vader. These events inhibited her willingness to become a true Jedi.
It isn&rsquo;t until the World Between Worlds, when she sees her former master again, that Ahsoka learns her final lesson from Anakin and becomes a Jedi. To signify this change, Ahsoka&rsquo;s drab gray robes worn in the Ahsoka series until that point become a vibrant, crisp white. Robes like these have never been seen before in Star Wars, which indicates the significance of this new version of Ahsoka, unofficially referred to as her &lsquo;Ahsoka the White&rsquo; outfit.</p>
<p>1  Darth Vader&rsquo;s Suit
A New Hope</p>
<p>Despite the many excellent outfits on this list, there is simply no beating Darth Vader&rsquo;s suit. If it can be considered an &lsquo;outfit,&rsquo; given that it is a life-sustaining suit that is also incredibly painful for Vader, it has become perhaps the singular icon of all of Star Wars. From the curious buttons on the front to the helmet that Kylo Ren so desperately emulates, Darth Vader&rsquo;s suit is absolutely the best outfit in Star Wars, and, as Ewan McGregor himself experienced while filming Obi-Wan Kenobi, it is simply terrifying.</p>
