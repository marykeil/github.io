# 10 Sitcom Characters Who Shared Their Names With The Actors Who Played Them


## SUMMARY 


 Sitcoms often use the actors&#39; real names to establish a closer connection between the actor and the character. 
 Some sitcoms, like Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, present fictionalized versions of comedians living their lives, making it necessary for the character and actor to have the same name. 
 Characters who share the same name as the actors who portray them are popular figures in sitcoms because it helps to establish the actor and creates a stronger connection with the audience.

## Literature Review
Sitcoms actors sometimes name their characters after themselves, especially if there are already recognizable names like Jerry Seinfeld or Will Smith.




Plenty of sitcom characters share their names with the actors who play them. This happens a lot more frequently in sitcoms than in many other genres, partly because sitcoms often have comedians playing key roles, rather than actors. But this isn&#39;t the only reason sitcoms use their actors&#39; real names. Usually, it&#39;s a good way to tie an actor and a character closer together. This can help to establish an actor, but it also works when an actor is so well-known that audiences wouldn&#39;t be able to think of them as just another character.
Some sitcoms present fictionalized versions of comedians living their lives, like Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm. In these cases, not only does it make sense to keep the same name, but it&#39;s central to the entire premise of the show. The comedian is playing an exaggerated version of themselves, so naturally they must have the same name. There are plenty of other reasons this happens in sitcoms, though, and sometimes it just makes things easier for production. Whatever the reason, characters who share the same name as the actors who portray them are some of the most popular figures in sitcoms.









 








 10  Jerry Seinfeld 
Seinfeld (1989-1998)


 







 Seinfeld 

 Release Date   July 5, 1989    Cast   Jerry Seinfeld , Julia Louis-Dreyfus , Jason Alexander , Michael Richards    Seasons   9    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




Jerry Seinfeld&#39;s self-spoofing portrayal on Seinfeld is the blueprint which many other comedians continue to follow to this day when making sitcoms. 

Jerry Seinfeld&#39;s self-spoofing portrayal on Seinfeld is the blueprint which many other comedians continue to follow to this day when making sitcoms. The original concept for Seinfeld was that the show would peek into Jerry&#39;s life and discover how he comes up with his material. The show strayed from this premise almost immediately, but Jerry Seinfeld still played himself, and some of the other characters from Seinfeld were based on real people in his life, although they were named differently. Seinfeld works so well because Jerry isn&#39;t afraid to portray himself as shallow and self-absorbed, so he is often the butt of the joke.





 9  Larry David 
Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000-2024)


 







 Curb Your Enthusiasm 

 Release Date   October 15, 2000    Cast   Larry David , Jeff Garlin , Cheryl Hines , Susie Essman , J.B. Smoove    Seasons   11    Streaming Service(s)   Max    




Seinfeld co-creator Larry David appeared in a few episodes, most notably as George Steinbrenner and Frank&#39;s cape-wearing lawyer, but he didn&#39;t become a star of the show until Curb Your Enthusiasm. Like Jerry in Seinfeld, Larry plays a fictionalized version of himself. Curb also features tons of great guest stars playing ridiculous self-parodies, including Ben Stiller, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jon Hamm. The upcoming season 12 of Curb Your Enthusiasm will be the show&#39;s last, so Larry David has one last chance to put his fictionalized self through some more chaos. Hopefully, there will also be time for some more great guest stars.





 8  Roseanne 
Roseanne (1988-2018)
        

 Roseanne 

 Release Date   October 18, 1988    Cast   Roseanne Barr , John Goodman , Laurie Metcalf , Sara Gilbert , Lecy Goranson , Michael Fishman    Seasons   10    Network   ABC    




Roseanne focuses on the perspective of a working-class mother, which was a very unusual premise for a sitcom when it first aired. Roseanna Barr played the role of Roseanna Conner. Barr was one of many comedians, much like Jerry Seinfeld, who were given their own sitcoms in the 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, this has become a less common practice, and sitcoms usually stick to hiring actors instead. Roseanne was revived for a single season in 2018, and its popularity carried over to the spinoff show, The Conners, which features most of the same cast, but notably excludes Roseanne Barr.





 7  Angela 
The Office (2005-2013)
        

 The Office 

 Release Date   March 24, 2005    Cast   Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski    Seasons   9    Network   NBC    




The theory is that the improvisational moments of the show will be easier if actors are less likely to slip up and call somebody by the wrong name. 

Angela isn&#39;t the only character in The Office who is named after the actor portraying her. While most of the more prominent characters have different names, some of the less central figures at Dunder-Mifflin, such as Creed, Oscar, and Phyllis, share the same name as the actors playing them. The theory is that the improvisational moments of the show will be easier if actors are less likely to slip up and call somebody by the wrong name, although this rule only applies to a select few characters in The Office. Angela started out as a fairly one-dimensional cat-lover, but her relationship with Dwight helped her stand out eventually.





 6  Charlie 
It&#39;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia (2005-)


 







 It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia 

 Release Date   August 4, 2005    Cast   Charlie Day , Rob McElhenney , Kaitlin Olson , Glenn Howerton , Danny DeVito    Seasons   16    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu    




The stars and creators of It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia took a strange approach to naming their characters. Charlie Day&#39;s character is called Charlie Kelly, and Rob McElhenny&#39;s character goes by Mac, but Glenn Howerton&#39;s character is called Dennis Reynolds. Dennis is a very dark character, so it makes sense that Howerton would want to draw a firmer distinction between himself and his character. Charlie&#39;s character was originally supposed to be called Phil, but Charlie Kelly found that it was easier to keep up with the fast-talking improvisational style of the show if the other actors just called him by his real name.





 5  Tracy 
30 Rock (2006-2013)
        

 30 Rock 

 Release Date   October 11, 2006    Cast   Tina Fey , Alec Baldwin , Tracy Morgan , Jane Krakowski , Jack McBrayer , Scott Adsit , Judah Friedlander , Katrina Bowden , Keith Powell , Lonny Ross    Seasons   7    Streaming Service(s)   Peacock    




Tracy Morgan&#39;s extremely thinly veiled self-parody, Tracy Jordan, is the most outlandish character in 30 Rock. Within the show&#39;s risible entertainment industry satire, Tracy represents any volatile and unreliable celebrity. TGS can&#39;t exist without him, but most of Liz&#39;s job consists of babysitting Tracy to make sure he isn&#39;t going to a strip club or trying to stab Conan O&#39;Brien. Members of Tracy&#39;s entourage, Grizz and Dotcom, also share the same names as their actors. 30 Rock had plenty of guest stars playing themselves, but they rarely matched Tracy&#39;s eccentric style. This just made his antics stand out even more.





 4  Miley 
Hannah Montana (2006-2011)
        

Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart and her pop star alter ego in Hannah Montana. Her real-life father, Billy Ray Cyrus, plays her fictional father, Robby Ray Stewart, too. Movies and TV shows with younger actors often use the names of the actors to make things easier for them, like in Drake and Josh, for example. The reasoning behind using Miley Cyrus&#39; real first name in Hannah Montana could be a little different though. With the presence of her famous musician father, and plenty of opportunities for her to sing, Hannah Montana was built to launch Miley Cyrus&#39; music career. She ultimately proved to be talented enough not to need help.





 3  Lucy 
I Love Lucy (1951-1957)
        

 I Love Lucy 

 Release Date   October 15, 1951    Cast   Lucille Ball , Desi Arnaz , William Frawley    Seasons   6    Network   CBS    




One of the most influential sitcoms of all time, I Love Lucy also pioneered the use of an actor&#39;s name as a character&#39;s name. Lucille Ball plays Lucy, a woman who desperately wants to break free from the tedium of her duties as a homemaker and get into show business. I Love Lucy pairs Ball with her husband Desi Arnanz on screen, so there is more than one parallel between her life and the fictional world of the show. I Love Lucy was the first scripted show to be filmed in front of a live studio audience, and the first sitcom to use an ensemble cast.





 2  Bret &amp; Jemaine 
Flight of the Conchords (2007-2009)
        

 flight of the conchords 

 Release Date   June 7, 2007    Cast   Jemaine Clement , Bret McKenzie    Seasons   2    Streaming Service(s)   HBO Max    




The short-lived HBO sitcom Flight of the Conchords is named after the band comprising the show&#39;s two stars, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement. The show follows their attempts to break into the music industry despite having just one fan and a string of poorly attended gigs in libraries and aquariums. Because the show is a fictional representation of a real band, the show&#39;s stars keep their own names. The end of the show didn&#39;t spell the end for the band, who continued to perform occasionally at much more impressive venues than their fictional counterparts. All they needed was a better manager than Murray.





 1  Will Smith 
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990-1996)
        

 Fresh Prince of Bel-Air 

 Release Date   September 10, 1990    Cast   James Avery , Ross Bagley , Will Smith , Karyn Parsons , Janet Hubert , Tatyana Ali , Daphne Reid , alfonso ribeiro , DJ Jazzy Jeff , Joseph Marcell    Seasons   6    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Netflix    




Will Smith had already reached a certain level of fame as a rapper alongside DJ Jazzy Jeff, but The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air gave him his first acting role. The fictional Will Smith shares a few key traits with the actor, notably his West Philadelphia upbringing and his cheeky, affable persona. Will is an outsider in Fresh Prince&#39;s Banks family and their luxurious surroundings, but his charms soon win them over. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air helped make Will Smith a household name, and he might not have become so popular had his character been named differently. The name choice tied Smith&#39;s public persona to the character.
