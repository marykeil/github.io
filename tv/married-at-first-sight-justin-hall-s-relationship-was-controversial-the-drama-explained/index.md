## Literature Review
Justin Hall was extremely vocal about his married life back on Married At First Sight, and he faced the repercussions in early 2023.




Married at First Sight star Justin Hall couldn&#39;t catch a break as fans trolled him over his new relationship in January 2023 by bringing up the reality star&#39;s past comments. During previous MAFS season 15, Justin and Alexis Mitchell were vocal about their relationship&#39;s emotional and physical aspects. It turns out that was not the most brilliant move.




Justin and Alexis matched on a dating app and just happened to get married on MAFS season 15; it seemed like destiny was on their side. With the couple being rather vocal, Justin did not shy away from talking about his two-year celibacy or how well-endowed he claimed to be, among other things. One of his many comments has returned to haunt him, even though Justin had found a new partner.


 Fans Called Out Justin For His Previous MAFS Comments 
          

Justin and Alexis had their share of drama, but when it came to Decision Day, they ultimately chose to stay together. However, they broke up shortly after. A confrontation between the pair followed where Alexis brought up the lack of their intimacy, with Justin claiming that her &#34;PH balance was off.&#34; His retort thoroughly amused MAFS fans. In a Reddit thread started by u/Turbulent-Ad-593, fans began discussing the reality star&#39;s new relationship. Viewers couldn&#39;t help but make a few jokes about the past comment. &#34;Hope her ph is on point,&#34; joked one fan. Others commented similarly, jabbing at Justin and his new relationship, saying, &#34;I hope her PH is in balance.&#34;






 MAFS Miguel Santiago Was Quick To Defend Justin 
          

More MAFS fans had a lot to say about Justin and the woman in the photo, unfortunately, not all of which were kind words. &#34;Ughhhhhh Crazy anyone wants him,&#34; wrote a fan, while another called him out for being a &#34;crybaby.&#34; However, Justin&#39;s fellow castmate, Miguel Santiago, quickly jumped to his defense. Miguel out people on the thread for their intense criticism. &#34;Ouch! Some of these comments are way out of line. These are real people that are living real lives [...] I&#39;ve hung out with them and they&#39;re happy, that&#39;s all that matters :)&#34; he wrote.

Some users in the Reedit thread agreed with him that certain comments were uncalled for. Fame certainly does come with a price, but it looks like Justin himself had a few choice words to share, allegedly. One comment, in particular, was signed with his name and directed at Miguel, where the commenter wrote, &#34;Bro, I appreciate you as always. Don’t waste your time with people on here. There sad individuals who are looking for engagement. Let’s link soon though. - Justin&#34;. However, seeing that it isn&#39;t a verified profile, there is no way of knowing whether it was Justin.




Justin bore the brunt of some mean comments recently following his stunt on Married At First Sight season 15. Luckily, Miguel was there to defend Justin and his new partner from the trolls. Even though Justin and Alexis had a rough relationship, hopefully, he and his new partner are much happier. He&#39;s living a private life after the show and appears to eschew the spotlight.
