## Literature Review
Several love triangles have formed during Single&#39;s Inferno season 3. It&#39;s hard to predict who will end up together and who will go home alone.




Season 3 of Netflix&#39;s Korean dating show Single&#39;s Inferno has been rife with complex love triangles. The 12 single contestants, 6 male, and 6 female have been living on &#34;Hell Island&#34; in rough conditions with minimal supplies for several days. They get to know each other as they compete for dates and other rewards. If they successfully couple up, they are able to escape the inferno for a night in paradise, which is a luxurious hotel.




After 7 episodes, couples are starting to form. As the singles get to know each other and spend time together in the inferno and in paradise, relationships run hot and cold. Affections ebb and flow, and interests grow and wane. It&#39;s not a surprise that love triangles would form in this environment. The 12 singles have found themselves in several interesting love triangles so far this season.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Lee Jin-seok, An Min-young, Cho Min-ji 
          

Cafe owner Lee Jin-seok hit it off with Pilates instructor An Min-young right away. The two matched up during the premier episode of season 3 and spent the first night together in paradise, away from the inferno. They had a great time in paradise and their chemistry was undeniable. Jin-seok giving Min-young a piggyback ride in the pool was the most physical contact between contestants so far this season. It looked like it would be smooth sailing for the couple, but when Jin-seok expressed his interest too enthusiastically, Min-young pulled away. Jin-seok was obviously disappointed but handled it admirably, even encouraging Min-young to give all the other guys a look.




As Min-young turned her focus to other men, a new girl arrived on the island. 26-year-old former Miss Korea contestant Cho Min-Ji was immediately interested in Jin-seok. After meeting all the men, she was allowed to choose two men to take to paradise. She chose Jin-seok and Choi Min-woo, but it was clear during the night that she was more interested in Jin-seok. Once Min-young saw that another woman wanted Jin-seok, she was immediately jealous. After he got back from paradise, Min-young bared her heart to Jin-seok. But he replied by saying he&#39;s not as sure of his feelings for her anymore.



 Choi Min-woo, Kim Gyu-ri, Yu Si-eun 
          

Choi Min-woo and Yu Si-eun hit it off early in the season, even spending a night in paradise together. But Kim Gyu-ri liked Min-woo too. In fact, during the first episode of the season, Gyu-ri selected him to go to paradise with during the couple&#39;s matching. He, however, didn&#39;t select Gyu-ri, so they were the only two left behind while everyone else went to paradise. Gyu-ri&#39;s interest in Min-woo didn&#39;t stop there. When she unexpectedly won a physical challenge during episode 6, she got first choice of whom to take to paradise. In a repeat of the premiere episode, Gyu-ri selected Min-woo, and they had a great time together in paradise.




Gyu-ri&#39;s newfound connection with Min-woo has thrown his relationship with Si-eun into question. After losing the competition to Gyu-ri, Si-eun was concerned that one of the other women would choose to take Min-woo to paradise. She pulled him aside to have a private chat, during which she revealed to him that she had wanted to go to paradise with him. He revealed that he wanted to talk to her more than the other girls. That being said, he had a good time with Gyu-ri, so it&#39;s hard to predict if Min-woo will choose Gyu-ri or Si-eun by the finale of Single&#39;s Inferno.



 Park Min-kyu, Choi Min-woo, Kim Gyu-ri 
          

Park Min-kyu was instantly interested in Gyu-ri. During episode 6, he even told the other men that he intended to be with her by the end of the season. Despite his interest, he hasn&#39;t been able to really find a way to connect with her. When Gyu-ri won the chance to choose a man to take to paradise, she considered Min-kyu but ended up choosing Min-woo, whom she had liked since the premiere episode. Min-kyu was disappointed but still expressed confidence in his intention to end up with Gyu-ri. He was slightly mollified by the fact that Si-eun came in third in the matching competition and chose him to go to paradise, so at least he didn&#39;t get left behind on &#34;Hell Island.&#34;






 Lee Gwan-hee, Choi Hye-seon, Yun Ha-jeong (And Maybe Cho Min-ji) 
        Single&#39;s inferno season 3 Split images of castÂ    

During the first episode and the first couple&#39;s matching, professional basketball player Lee Gwan-hee matched with student Choi Hye-seon, and they had a nice time together in paradise. The next day, in a shocking twist, it was revealed that there was a whole other inferno with a different group of contestants. Gwan-hee and Ha-seon were separated, and Gwan-hee was immediately introduced to office worker Yun Ha-jeong. The two had immediate chemistry, they shared fun banter and an exciting dynamic, to the delight of the hosts.

Though their relationship runs hot and cold, Ha-jeong came clean with him during the seventh episode, telling him that she is interested in him. Though Gwan-hee is still interested in her, he does not reciprocate her strong feelings. This conversation between them was awkward and lacked the fireworks of their usual banter. Gwan-hee has also expressed interest in getting to know Gyu-ri, but the two haven&#39;t had a chance to connect yet. To complicate matters even further, a new girl, Min-ji, showed up halfway through the season and shook things up.




Min-ji had shown interest in Gwan-hee and even pulled him aside to talk. Surprisingly, he implied to Min-ji that he is attracted to her and has feelings for her. In an on-camera interview, Gwan-hee referred to Min-ji as the one he had been waiting for. As for Min-ji, her feelings for Gwan-hee don&#39;t seem as strong as her interest in Jin-seok. With only three episodes left in season three of Single&#39;s Inferno, it&#39;s hard to predict who will end up together and who will go home alone.



Single&#39;s Inferno is streaming on Netflix. Episodes 8 and 9 drop on Tuesday, January 2, 2024. Episode 10 drops on Tuesday, January 9, 2024.
