## Literature Review
With the great success of HBO&#39;s The Last of Us season 1, there&#39;s even more excitement about which theories season 2 could potentially confirm or deny.




HBO&#39;s adaptation of Naughty Dog&#39;s The Last of Us video game made some changes and answered some theories, but with season 2 confirmed, there are a few others it can validate or disprove. Video game adaptations are often a hit or miss, and The Last of Us shows that it can be faithful without being a direct copy. The positive critical and fan reception of the series is evidence of this.

Interestingly, some of the changes to the show answered theories the games didn&#39;t explore. For instance, Ellie&#39;s immunity origins are explained in The Last of Us&#39; season 1 finale, with her mother being bitten while pregnant, and the confirmation of the fungus infection spreading is via contaminated flour. While these answer major infection questions, a few expected topics based on the games and broader Last of Us universe theories should still be addressed in season 2 and beyond.

 8  The Hive Mind Mythos In The Last Of Us Show Makes The Worst Infected Unbeatable 
The Rat King from The Last Of Us Part II is singular but formidable.



Since The Last of Us season 1 connected the contraction and spread of the infection to consuming contaminated flour-based foods, being bitten, or exchanging saliva, the idea that everyone is slightly infected may be less likely. However, the hive mind approach instead of airborne spores might be even more terrifying than the idea of dormant infections, since it amplifies the infected threat because of their link supposedly through consciousness. The second game&#39;s Rat King is already a hive mind of sorts because it&#39;s made up of multiple types of infected all melded together.
Adding the show&#39;s mythos would theoretically mean the Rat King could incite more infected to join in on attacking Abby. In the TV format, it&#39;s much more implausible for one human - even one as strong as Abby - to take down the Rat King in addition to numerous other infected while in a sectioned off area. Additionally, the special effects alone would make this fight a huge undertaking that could add to the complaints about the limited infected since it might require much of the budget to go into only one infected.
            

 The Last Of Us Season 2 Is Fixing Your Two Biggest Infected Problems 
The Last of Us became an instant success for HBO, despite a few minor infected complaints. Season 2 promises to fix those problems with all haste.



 7  The Fireflies Wanted To Control The Cure 
This theory suggests the Fireflies had more sinister plans for Ellie.
        

While Joel thwarted The Last of Us&#39; Fireflies, who planned to use Ellie&#39;s immunity as a way to reverse-engineer a cure, there&#39;s no confirmed outcome of how the group would&#39;ve handled having this cure. If the Fireflies successfully achieved a cure or vaccine, it would immediately give them much more power. Having the knowledge of how to create a vaccine for the infection could be more cynical than it seems. The Fireflies have already shown an ability to control regions with their bombing of FEDRA areas. With a vaccine, the Fireflies could control people more easily because a cure or vaccine would be a sought-after commodity.




 6  Abby’s Immune In The Last Of Us (And Jerry Knows) 
Abby&#39;s potential immunity adds to the complexity of Joel saving Ellie.
        

If Abby were immune, Jerry would know she would have to die during the surgery, making Joel&#39;s actions oddly aligned with the surgeon he killed. This is set up when Marlene repeatedly asks Jerry if he&#39;d be so willing to go through with the surgery if Abby were in Ellie&#39;s shoes, and he avoids answering. While this is speculation, it is worth unpacking since it adds an even deeper layer to the causes of revenge and anger that thematically make up much of the second game&#39;s story. With little else to go on, the TV series can address Abby&#39;s status while also expanding on the mythos behind the infection.



 The Last Of Us Season 2&#39;s Perfect Abby Casting Is Who We All Wanted For Ellie 10 Years Ago 
As the casting for Abby in The Last of Us season 2 ramps up, one candidate originally fan-casted as Ellie presents herself as the perfect choice,




 5  There’s No Cure In The Last Of Us 
Despite the Fireflies&#39; planned surgery for Ellie, it&#39;s not confirmed it would work.
        

Much like some theories on this list, the surgery planned for Ellie being a successful way to create a vaccine is speculative. Even if they had gone through with Ellie&#39;s surgery, perhaps the chemical receptors that relay to the infected that she has the Cordyceps fungus infection can&#39;t be severed from a living organism in order to be effective. Perhaps the elements of the receptors that make her immune can&#39;t be modified or replicated into a vaccine. Because there&#39;s never been exploration of the effectiveness of a surgery like this, since Ellie would need to die to find out, the show can address it by introducing other immune characters.




 4  Multiple People Could Be Immune Like Ellie In The Last Of Us 
The series introduced a potential way to create immunity.
        

Fans have often speculated that the chances of one person in the whole world being immune is questionable. With the adaptation noting Ellie&#39;s immunity was due to her mother being bitten and giving birth before the infection spread, there&#39;s a clear sign that other babies could&#39;ve been delivered under similar circumstances. While still very specific in circumstances, it removes the more mystical idea that Ellie is the only supposed savior of humanity by chance. Even if there&#39;s a limited few other immune people in the apocalypse, season 2 can address this. This is useful, particularly because the root of Ellie&#39;s immunity was only established in the season 1 finale.
            

 The Last Of Us Season 2 Cast &amp; Character Guide 
The Last of Us season 2 cast hasn&#39;t yet been confirmed, but several key characters are sure to return along with some intriguing new additions.



 3  Ellie&#39;s Final Scene At The Farm In The Last Of Us Part II Was Her Last Visit 
Clues suggest Ellie may have already moved back to Jackson before the final cutscene.
        

Ellie&#39;s return to the farm in The Last of Us Part II suggests she wasn&#39;t surprised to find the house empty, but rather just reminiscent, indicating it was likely not her first visit there since Santa Barbara, where she spared Abby. There are other clues that suggest Ellie had already reconciled with Dina after leaving to pursue revenge, and she returned to Jackson after her altercation with Abby.


These include some missing Dina and JJ artwork, most of the studio items relating to Joel, the season seeming the same (suggesting about a year has passed), Ellie leaving behind reminders of Joel (like the guitar), and Ellie wearing Dina&#39;s bracelet again. These suggest Ellie&#39;s process of grief moved toward acceptance, and she likely resumed her life with her partner and JJ, even facing Jackson, which is a reminder of Joel. Although perhaps more for a possible season 3, this theory can be addressed if season 2 follows similar non-linear storytelling as the game.
            

 Casting This Last Of Us 2 Character Is Crucial To Season 2’s Success (&amp; It’s Not Abby) 
There&#39;s been tons of buzz about the importance of casting a perfect Abby in The Last of Us season 2, but casting this TLOU2 character is also crucial.



 2  The Seraphite Prophet’s Death Was A Power Play By The WLF 
There are a lot of untold stories about different groups, like the Seraphites and the WLF.


It&#39;s established in The Last of Us Part II that the Seraphite Prophet was all about egalitarian living and peacefulness. However, the direct cause of her death is not explicitly explored. Luckily, it&#39;s been teased that untold side stories could appear in subsequent seasons of the TV adaptation, such as the Seraphite Prophet&#39;s story. Although the WLF and Seraphite disputes are already clear from the second game, it&#39;s plausible they might have had an amicable arrangement about territory. There seems to be a geographical boundary since the growing Seraphite numbers resulted in a split between the island and the Lower Queen Anne suburb, suggesting an agreement about territories.
However, given the WLF leader Isaac&#39;s ruthlessness, it&#39;s possible the Prophet&#39;s death was a power play. There&#39;s no explanation as to why the Prophet was targeted, specifically, so it&#39;s possible she was taken to prove a point that any violence against them can be returned tenfold. Additionally, the WLF showed sadistic pleasure in their executions and torture, which indicates that they had multi-layered sinister motives. This is further supported by some Wolves, who were questioning the WLF&#39;s approach, and defected to the Seraphites.
            

 7 The Last Of Us Part II Characters We Can’t Wait To See In Season 2 
The Last of Us season 2 will follow the story of The Last of Us Part II, meaning several exciting characters from the latter will make their TV debut.


 1  The Surviving Fireflies Haven’t Been Able To Restart Because of The Rattlers 
The Last of Us Part II introduced Firefly survivors.
        

Some surviving Fireflies are on Catalina Island, which would require a boat trip, thus isolating them. However, given how easily Abby and Lev were taken by the Rattlers, preventing them from continuing their mission, it&#39;s possible other people who came to the 2425 Constance Firefly outpost were ambushed and kept as slaves. The Last of Us season 2 can explore this as it&#39;s a major hint to why the Fireflies haven&#39;t restarted their operations in a more widespread manner as before. This could also blend the TV and game world as it potentially would set up points for a third game.
The Last of Us season 2 is expected to premiere in 2025.
