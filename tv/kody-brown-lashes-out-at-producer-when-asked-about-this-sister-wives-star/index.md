## Literature Review
In a preview for the upcoming Sister Wives look back at season 18 Kody Brown lashed out at a producer for asking him about his big fight with Janelle.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown is lashing out at producers of the series in a new exclusive clip of Sister Wives: Look Back after he&#39;s asked to relive the massive fight he and ex-wife Janelle Brown had early on in the season. While Janelle and Kody&#39;s marriage was explored throughout Sister Wives season 18, the couple ultimately decided the best choice for them was to split after having one of the most extreme disagreements of their relationship. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Kody dealt with the fallout from his divorce from Christine Brown and how it impacted his marriages with Janelle, Meri Brown, and Robyn Brown.




During a preview clip for the upcoming Sister Wives: Look Back at season 18 (via ET Online), Kody lashed out at producers who were asking him to comment on the fight he had with Janelle during Sister Wives season 18 episode 3. &#34;All right, you ready for the big fight,&#34; the director of the Tell-All special asked, explaining it was the fight between him and Janelle when Kody asked. After tossing the iPad he&#39;d been given to watch it to the side, Kody snapped.


 

&#34;I&#39;m not watching that again,&#34; Kody said, his tone firm. &#34;Listen, I don&#39;t want to talk about my breakup with Janelle anymore, okay?&#34; After continuing to berate the production team, Kody went on to share that his breakup with Janelle was still a tough subject for him to discuss in depth. &#34;She&#39;s not a loyal wife, and I&#39;m probably a s***** husband. I don&#39;t care â€“ we&#39;re not working anymore and I don&#39;t want to talk about it anymore.&#34;




ABCD


 Kody Says His Breakup With Janelle Was &#34;As Bad As Christine&#34; 
          

While Kody and Janelle&#39;s breakup has seemed somewhat more amicable than his split with Christine, he shared that he&#39;s not working through the pain of the divorce quickly or easily. &#34;It&#39;s very painful,&#34; Kody explained, &#34;it&#39;s as bad as Christine&#39;s, but I didn&#39;t want to admit the same things that were going on with me and Janelle...I still struggle to admit that Janelle and I aren&#39;t good together.&#34; While Janelle was able to watch the footage comfortably and comment on her argument with Kody, his feelings were still tremendously hurt by the argument. The Sister Wives star was having a tough time compartmentalizing, which caused him to lash out.


 




After nearly 30 years with Janelle, Kody&#39;s relationship with his ex-wife was a tough one for him to let go of. The issues between the couple weren&#39;t easy to understand, as they weren&#39;t just things that happened between Kody and Janelle, but involved their children as well as Robyn. While Janelle appeared for a time she would be willing to talk to Kody and try to reach a place of agreement, it became clear as time went on that she wasn&#39;t interested in reconciling the way that Kody was. Kody, unlike Janelle, was hopeful that they would be able to come to terms with their issues and move forward.

While Kody and Janelle&#39;s relationship may be over, the issues between them are still large and difficult to resolve. Janelle has been the one to initiate conversations about her split with Kody, and while she had a hard time with their separation in the beginning, it became clear to her that separating from Kody was the best possible choice after their fight. With Kody struggling to reach a place of peace surrounding their divorce, it&#39;s difficult for the Sister Wives patriarch to speak openly about and has led to more than one highly intense emotional moment for Kody.
