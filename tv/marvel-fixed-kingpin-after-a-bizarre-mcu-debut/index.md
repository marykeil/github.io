## Literature Review

Marvel Studios received criticism for Kingpin&#39;s depiction in Phase 4&#39;s Hawkeye, but these concerns have now been addressed with Wilson Fisk&#39;s return.




After his questionable debut in Phase 4&#39;s Hawkeye, Marvel Studios has finally fixed Kingpin in the MCU. Vincent D&#39;Onofrio first appeared as Wilson Fisk in Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil series in 2015, introduced as the primary antagonist to Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil throughout all three seasons of his self-titled series. After Daredevil&#39;s cancelation in 2018, D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s future as Wilson Fisk was put in jeopardy, but he has since reprised the role in the MCU proper, making his official debut in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye on Disney&#43;. Unfortunately, D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s different portrayal of Kingpin in Hawkeye received some criticism, but these concerns have now been addressed.




While Netflix&#39;s Defenders Saga may now be canon to the MCU, Kingpin&#39;s MCU timeline has revealed that some events from Daredevil have been altered slightly in the current continuity of the MCU. This has included giving Wilson Fisk a decades-long father-daughter relationship with Alaqua Cox&#39;s Maya Lopez, which was non-existent in Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil series. This relationship has been one of the central themes of Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s appearances in the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga, both in Hawkeye and the MCU&#39;s first Marvel Spotlight series, Echo, but there are several other differences that some viewers have struggled to wrap their heads around.

  

                  Kingpinâ€™s MCU Return Supports Shocking MCU Theory   Vincent D&#39;Onofrio returned as Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin in Phase 5&#39;s Echo, though his current MCU storyline may support a game-changing power theory.   





 Why Kingpin&#39;s MCU Debut In Hawkeye Was So Bizarre 
          

Vincent D&#39;Onofrio returned to the MCU in Hawkeye, but while his inclusion was hugely exciting, particularly for those fond of his performance in Daredevil, this did garner some criticism. Most of this scrutiny was aimed at Fisk&#39;s apparent increase in strength. In Daredevil, Fisk displayed his physical strength on several occasions, but he was ultimately only human. In Hawkeye, however, Kingpin seemed to display a level of superhuman power that confused many, especially during his battle with Kate Bishop, as he survived an arrow to the chest, getting hit by a car, and being blown up by Bishop&#39;s trick arrows.

Another jarring aspect of Wilson Fisk&#39;s return in Hawkeye was his interesting wardrobe change. In Daredevil, Kingpin demonstrated a penchant for simple suits in neutral and dark colors, but Hawkeye featured the villain sporting Hawaiian shirts and differing color schemes. While this may have been more comic-accurate for the villain, it seemed to contradict the ominous nature of Kingpin himself. This all could be attributed to the fact that Daredevil was rated TV-MA, while Hawkeye fit the MCU&#39;s more family-friendly tones, meaning Kingpin needed to be dulled-down. Nevertheless, this still marked a strange reintroduction to Wilson Fisk in the MCU.






 How Marvel&#39;s Echo Fixed Kingpin 
         

Marvel Studios&#39; Echo series was the MCU&#39;s first TV-MA project, and the first to release under the Marvel Spotlight banner, allowing it to be more realistic, grounded and character-driven. This meant that Wilson Fisk was able to fully embrace his more brutal and aggressive tendencies throughout the five-part Disney&#43; series, especially in moments which saw him beat an ice cream vendor to a pulp and in Echo&#39;s finale, where Fisk threatens to kill Maya Lopez&#39;s entire family. This provided viewers with an intense glimpse of the real Wilson Fisk, sharing more similarities with his depiction in Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil series.

                  Marvel May Have Just Solved An MCU Kingpin Problem Created By Daredevil Season 3   Daredevil season 3 created a key problem for Kingpin&#39;s future in the MCU, but it may have just been solved thanks to Marvel&#39;s new Echo series.   




While demonstrating a more terrifying version of Kingpin, Phase 5&#39;s Echo also managed to showcase Wilson Fisk&#39;s more emotional qualities. The mob boss figure seen in Hawkeye lacked Fisk&#39;s realistic textures, but these returned in Echo, particularly with Fisk wanting to recreate his Sunday dinners with Maya, empathizing with her yearning for freedom, and attempts at finding ways to speak directly to her - however twisted these may have been. The fact that Wilson Fisk is ultimately still human in Echo, while also displaying impressive feats of strength, may assuage some of the criticisms aimed at his depiction in Hawkeye.



 Kingpin Could Be A Thanos-Like Threat For The MCU&#39;s Street-Level Heroes 
          

In a recent interview with Screen Rant, Marvel Studios executive producer Brad Winderbaum referred to Kingpin as the &#34;Thanos of the street-level corner of the MCU,&#34; suggesting his power and influence will affect a huge number of small-scale heroes. Echo&#39;s post-credits scene supports this idea, as the scene teased Wilson Fisk becoming the Mayor of New York City, potentially leading to an adaptation of Marvel Comics&#39; Devil&#39;s Reign storyline. This story saw Mayor Wilson Fisk outlaw vigilantism in New York, which has been a heavily-rumored storyline for Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming Daredevil: Born Again, marking D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s return alongside Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil.




An adaptation of Devil&#39;s Reign could span several MCU projects and impact many heroes. While Daredevil: Born Again will likely be the epicenter, Kingpin could also be featured as an antagonist in Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, and Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming Spider-Man 4. This would bring Fisk into conflict with the MCU&#39;s most popular heroes, and may lead to tragedy for many, just as the Avengers&#39; previous battle against Thanos did. This could mean criticisms aimed at Hawkeye&#39;s Kingpin may not arise again, as he is set to become an even more threatening force in the MCU&#39;s future.
