## Literature Review
Cleo Corraine and Christian from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise have reconciled. However, some reasons suggest that their relationship isn’t meant to be.




Cleo Corraine and Christian Allgood from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 are back together, but their reconciliation probably won’t last long. The British woman and the American man had a painfully terrible relationship on the show. They didn’t share mutual romantic feelings and didn’t live matching lifestyles. When the two debuted on the show, Christian introduced himself as an outgoing, extroverted man who had only dated women. In comparison, Cleo talked about her past struggles being an autistic transwoman and shared that she was an introvert who liked to spend her time alone.




During 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days season 6, Cleo pursued Christian despite their personality differences. However, she soon regretted trusting him when he mistreated her. In one episode, Christian falsely told the cameras that he hadn’t been physical with Cleo when he was. This hurt the 32-year-old as she contemplated her relationship. Christian also met another woman at the bar and befriended her without telling Cleo. He later denied being interested in the stranger and blamed his free-spirited nature. Cleo and Christian broke up sometime after the Tell All.

 Cleo &amp; Christian Will Keep Fighting To Change Each Other 

 




Cleo recently posted a photo of herself and Christian, stating they are back together. However, many fans quickly took to the comment section and told them it was a bad idea. People aren’t happy with Christian and Cleo’s reconciliation because the two aren’t compatible. They have drastically different personalities and want each other to change. Even in past episodes, the couple fought to change each other’s lifestyle. Cleo wanted Christian to accept her and conform to her ways. At the same time, Christian expected Cleo to understand him and take him for who he was.



 Christian Could End Up Cheating On Cleo (Physically or Emotionally) 
          

Christian and Cleo’s reconciliation isn&#39;t a great idea, as there&#39;s the potential for cheating. While most viewers don’t like Christian for how he treated Cleo on the show, some also dislike him because he seems shady. Christian comes off as creepy and seemingly has no boundaries. From the bar scandal in the finale to talking to the group of girls during his first date with Cleo, there are far too many red flags that hint the 30-year-old is a potential cheater. Since Christian is into casual friendships, especially with females, he could cheat one day.






 Christian Doesn’t Cater To Cleo’s Special Needs 
          

Christian is just not emotionally mature enough to understand Cleo. While the couple has no drastic age difference, they have different mindsets. Christian is still young at heart, while Cleo is in her mid-30s and wants to settle down and be with a man who loves her. Cleo is sensitive and emotional; she needs someone who can cater to them. However, Christian has already proved that he isn’t the man who can be there for Cleo as she wants him to. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days pair will realize their incompatibility issues before getting serious again.
