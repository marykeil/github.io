Larissa, Danielle, Leida, and Molly are some of the most despised cast members in the franchise.
Angela&rsquo;s outspoken and controlling behavior has made her enemies and prompted fans to petition for her removal from the show.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Women cast members in the history of 90 Day Fiancé who were either bad from the start or turned to the dark side as their relationships soured.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Angela Deem faces tough competition when it comes to the female villains in the franchise who’ve created conflict and chaos both on screen and in real life. While 90DF as a show, could have been all about the K-1 visa processes, meet-cutes, and happily ever after’s, its cheating allegations, affairs, cultural differences, and age gaps that entertain viewers. The cast members that create tension might make for good TV, but some of them are just plain awful. Fans don’t enjoy watching them treat their partner badly or proving the gold digger accusations right.
However, it’s not easy for them to hide their true nature for long since the camera captures it all. These cast members and their over-the-top demands, mistreatment of their partners, or simply the words that come out of their mouths have become a reason for fans to detest them every time they’re on-screen. Their terrible attitudes continue to grow worse with every new spin-off they’re in. If one had to announce a competition for the worst 90 Day Fiancé cast members, these names would take the crown. Here’s a look at what makes them so vile and evil.
: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now</p>
<p>5  Larissa Lima</p>
<p>Larissa is considered one of the worst cast members of 90 Day Fiancé by some viewers. Colt Johnson from Las Vegas met Larissa online, but they saw each other in person for the first time when they vacationed in Cancun, Mexico. Larissa made for good TV thanks to her fiery personality and sense of humor. Still, she did marry Colt because she wanted to come to America and marry a man who would cater to her every whim and provide her with a life of luxury. Larissa was disappointed when she saw Colt living under the same roof as his mother and sharing a joint bank account with her.
Larissa was slammed online when fans discovered she’d moved to the U.S. to chase her dreams while leaving her kids in Brazil. In her earlier days with Colt, she told Debbie that she had children. Debbie was shocked and burst into tears. Larissa’s son lives with her ex-Marcos Hack’s sister, who adopted him after Larissa and Marcos split, while Larissa’s daughter Luane resides with Larissa’s father. Larissa told Debbie she planned on bringing her kids to the U.S. once she moved into a bigger house. However, despite her being in America for over five years, it doesn’t look like Larissa will get her kids to live with her.</p>
<p>4  Danielle Mullins (Jbali)</p>
<p>Daniele is regarded as one of the most memorable cast members in the franchise. She was not likable, but the challenges in her relationship with Mohamed Jbali created some of the most dramatic moments on the show. Danielle was the original cougar of 90 Day Fiancé. She married a younger man and was constantly crying and cribbing throughout the relationship. While Danielle made it look like Mohamed was after a Green Card, Danielle’s mission to ruin him after he left her turned the tables. She talked to him and obsessively messaged him while trying to get him deported. Daniele’s behavior proved Mohamed’s claims that she was unstable.
While 90 Day: The Single Life redeemed Danielle to a certain extent, it still didn’t change the opinion of fans who remembered her from the olden days. Daniele had threatened to deport Mohamed when he refused to get intimate with her and could cry at the drop of a hat when she wanted to look like a victim. Danielle was a master manipulator who tried to worm her way out of tough situations by playing innocent. What Danielle did on 90 Day Fiancé was extremely concerning. Daniele was never able to move on from Mohamed, which is why she continues to use his last name and has kept him around as a “friend.”</p>
<p>3  Leida Margaretha</p>
<p>Leida from season 6 of 90 Day Fiancé became one-half of the most controversial couple in the show’s history, with Eric Rosenbrook. Leida was supposedly rich but very spoiled and criticized everything in Eric’s home once she moved in. Fans recall Leida not getting along with Eric’s daughter Tasha. She had one of the show’s biggest blowouts with Tasha and ended up kicking the girl out of the house. Eric helped Leida execute her evil schemes by taking her side against his family. She managed to place a 4-year restraining order against Tasha. Leida wanted Eric to stop paying child support, so he could have more money to buy her flowers.
Leida and Eric made headlines in 2019 because of allegations of domestic abuse. Leida alleged that Eric got physical during a fight while she was allegedly threatening to kill herself with a knife. The couple got over the drama quickly but Leida was back in the news in 2023 after getting arrested. Leida was arrested for theft, fraud, and forgery in Colombia County, Wisconsin, according to PageSix. She was accused of making fraudulent payments and withdrawals to several outside business accounts and customers using her company Loggerhead Deco’s account information. The glass bottle decorating business reported thousands of dollars missing from their accounts.</p>
<p>2  Molly Hopkins</p>
<p>Molly’s failed relationships on 90 Day Fiancé aren’t the only reason why she gets hate from viewers. Molly has done several things for her to make it on the list of controversial female cast members. Lately, it’s her relationship with Kelly Brown which was in the spotlight after her appearance on 90 Day: The Last Resort. She made it look like she was ready to reconcile with Kelly but may have come to the show to promote her business and not fix the relationship. Molly has been arrested more than once and is reportedly dating a much-married man (via merrypants) with an alleged criminal record after breaking up with Kelly.
Molly’s social media have posts of her before and after her weight loss. She claims to have lost several pounds from sipping on a pink drink that fans suspect is an MLM scheme. Molly was friends with Cynthia Decker for several years. They were an inseparable Pillow Talk duo and co-owned LiviRae Lingerie. After Cynthia revealed they were no longer friends, Molly accused Cynthia of stealing money from their business. Fans treasured Molly and Cynthia’s friendship and even wished for them to come back to Pillow Talk. However, the chances of it happening are slim considering how badly Molly ends her relationships.</p>
<p>1  Angela Deem</p>
<p>Angela’s outspoken nature on 90 Day Fiancé has made her plenty of enemies. Angela’s blunt remarks to cast members and heated fights with Michael Ilesanmi have made her look abusive on screen. While Angela does have co-star friends such as Kalani Faagata who vouch for her supposed kindheartedness, fans are yet to see and believe that side of the Georgia woman. Angela’s notoriety precedes her. She mocked Michael’s appearance and said offensive things about him. Angela has flirted with other men openly while expecting Michael not to stray from the relationship. Angela has been controlling Michael’s social media activities and even tried to track his phone location by invading his privacy.
Angela has a monstrous side that could stem from physical insecurities. She’s aware of the age difference between her and Michael. She’s tried several cosmetic procedures to keep herself younger-looking. Angela has had explosive fights with 90 Day Fiancé colleagues, that have prompted fans to create petitions to have her fired from the series. Angela’s wild confrontations on camera have even involved producers trying to calm her down, but it’s too late, since she’s already crossed over to the dark side.</p>
