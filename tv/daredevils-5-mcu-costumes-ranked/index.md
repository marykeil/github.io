## Literature Review
Charlie Cox&#39;s Matt Murdock returned in Echo, and with the new series, Daredevil now has 5 exciting MCU costumes, though some are better than others.




Daredevil might still be missing his iconic comic book look, but Charlie Cox&#39;s Matt Murdock has already worn a few suits in his time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige has yet to formally say that the three seasons of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil are canon to the MCU, recent events have made that significantly closer to reality. A trailer for Disney&#43;&#39;s Echo teased Daredevil&#39;s MCU canon status by using footage from the series to showcase Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin. Then, Echo&#39;s five episodes showed that some parts of Wilson Fisk&#39;s backstory are officially canon to the MCU.
With Cox&#39;s Daredevil part of the MCU for sure since his cameo in 2021&#39;s Spider-Man: No Way Home and his series looking increasingly canon to the MCU, with Disney&#43; even including The Defenders Saga in the official MCU timeline, that means that Daredevil has sported many different looks in Marvel Studios&#39; universe. In the comics, Daredevil has worn a bit of everything, with red, black, yellow, and more colors and variations of suits. While Cox&#39;s Matt Murdock has yet to sport Daredevil&#39;s iconic &#34;DD&#34; logo in one of his suits, the hero&#39;s MCU costumes have delivered exciting visuals to different levels.

 5  Daredevil Season 1 Red Suit 
Charlie Cox&#39;s Original Red Daredevil Costume
        

Daredevil&#39;s most famous comic book suit style features the hero in a sleek superhero suit. While the costume choice works out great for Marvel Comics&#39; Daredevil, Cox&#39;s version of the hero would have looked out of place in the gritty Netflix Daredevil series if he emerged in the show&#39;s season 1 finale with the spandex version of the suit that the character wears in the comics. Plus, other heroes, such as Spider-Man, already have that area of the MCU covered. Besides, the iconic all-red comic book Daredevil costume might have looked too silly even if it were in another project, as not all suits translate well to live-action.
The red and black costume that Cox appeared in the final episode of the first season of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil was worth the wait. The suit was exciting, using a patterned look that cut the red of the suit with many black attachments and padding to give it a rich variety. While the suit was great, it would not be better than Matt&#39;s other Daredevil suits, which improved on the hero&#39;s initial design. The main issue with the Daredevil season 1 suit was that the hero&#39;s helmet made it seem like Daredevil was always squinting his eyes, which made Matt look off in many close-up shots.





 4  Daredevil&#39;s Red &amp; Yellow Suit In She-Hulk 
Daredevil&#39;s First Costume At Marvel Studios


 







Following his cameo in 2021&#39;s Spider-Man: No Way Home, Cox would soon return to the MCU for two episodes of 2022&#39;s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. As Cox had only appeared as Matt Murdock in the Spider-Man movie, the Disney&#43; series marked the first time that he played Daredevil in a Marvel Studios project. As such, Marvel decided to give the character a new suit. Daredevil&#39;s yellow and red costume for She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was equal parts a throwback to the character&#39;s history, an attempt to differentiate the hero for this new phase, and a great fit for the lighter tone of the MCU series.
The yellow and red Daredevil suit is a direct nod to the hero&#39;s first comic book suit, which was not fully red like he would be known for. While the idea of honoring Daredevil&#39;s comic book debut in his first full-on role with Marvel Studios was exciting, the suit had its pitfalls. The yellow and red suit was very similar in design to the character&#39;s suits from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil, with the color scheme being the only major difference. Adding to that, the Daredevil suit made the character look extremely goofy in a few of the show&#39;s scenes in broad daylight.





 3  Daredevil&#39;s Black Costume 
The Look Netflix&#39;s Daredevil Made Iconic
        

While the Daredevil season 1 black suit was quite simple, it became perhaps the most iconic look for Cox&#39;s version of the character. Before getting his first red and black suit from Melvin Potter in Daredevil season 1&#39;s finale, Matt took to the streets of Hell&#39;s Kitchen to fight crime in a mostly black suit, which consisted of a compression shirt, cargo pants, gloves, boots, his striking mask, and white ropes tied against his first that gave the look a distinct element that elevated the whole homemade Daredevil suit.
While fans like to see characters wear their superhero costumes in shows like Daredevil, it made sense for the series to feature Matt in the prototype black suit for a large portion of season 1. The black Daredevil suit was perfect for the grounded, gritty vibe of the series, with the added element of the blood of Matt&#39;s enemies painting the white ropes wrapped in his fists red being an incredibly cool look. Besides, the black suit was so iconic that Daredevil would don it again during season 3, with Cox&#39;s Daredevil famously beating Wilson Fisk while wearing his first superhero costume of the series.





 2  Daredevil Season 2 Red Suit 
Matt Murdock Upgraded His First Red Costume


 







With his second red and black suit in the series, Daredevil never looked any better in the three seasons of his Netflix series. Cox&#39;s second red and black maintained most of the elements of Matt&#39;s first proper superhero suit from the show; however, the little nuances of the suit helped make it the best version of the Netflix Daredevil costumes. The new Daredevil suit featured more red than black, getting closer to the hero&#39;s comic book look, and fixed the original suit&#39;s biggest issue, the helmet, by doing away with the triangular-shaped design that made Daredevil look like he was frowning all the time.





 1  Daredevil Red Suit In Echo 
Charlie Cox&#39;s Latest Daredevil Suit Is His Best
        

Daredevil&#39;s second suit under Marvel Studios is the best one that Cox has donned as the hero. The cowl of Echo&#39;s Daredevil costume is less robust and gives the whole look a sleeker feel. The chest plates are considerably bigger and give Daredevil a more physically imposing presence. The suit maintains the traditional design and red/black style of the Netflix Daredevil suits; however, Echo&#39;s Daredevil costume adds a lot more red in the suit&#39;s central area, doing away with the black on the paddings and making it the coolest suit Cox has donned. It remains to be seen how Daredevil: Born Again will try to top Daredevil&#39;s latest suit.
