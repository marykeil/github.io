## Literature Review
These mighty Pokémon are often introduced in movies and are said to be responsible for several natural phenomena around the world.




Legendary Pokémon are powerful beings featured in myths and legends across the Pokémon universe. While there are no explicit criteria to define the Pokémon from this group, many of them are associated with natural phenomena and creation lore. Despite their rarity, some trainers, such as Ash and Noland, have managed to capture and train them for battle.
It&#39;s implied that Legendary Pokémon often appear in front of extraordinary people, such as Ash, who sees Ho-Oh in the anime&#39;s first episode. Every region has its own set of lore and Legendary Pokémon, such as Lugia, the &#34;Beast of the Sea&#34; who creates storms in Johto. Additionally, there are Mythical Pokémon, which are said to be so rare that people doubt their very existence. Examples of Pokémon in this group include Mew and Celebi, who are sometimes classified as Legendary instead. While Ash encounters several Pokémon throughout his journey, some of his strongest encounters have been with Legendary Pokémon.









 








 10  Mewtwo Is One Of The Most Intelligent Pokémon 
First appears in Pokémon: The First Movie
        

Mewtwo is a psychic-type Pokémon who was artificially created using Mew&#39;s DNA. Twenty years before the main story, Team Rocket&#39;s Giovanni ordered Dr. Fuji to clone Mew using its eyelash and create the most powerful Pokémon in existence. This leads to the birth of Mewtwo, who is tragically stored in a tank on New Island until it breaks out and attacks its creators. In addition to its telekinesis and telepathy, it has regeneration abilities that allow it to survive otherwise fatal injuries. With its destructive psychic powers and hatred for humans, Mewtwo proves itself to be a formidable opponent in battle. However, what makes the Pokémon truly dangerous is its human-like intelligence, which allows it to process complex philosophical ideas.





 9  Xerneas and Yveltal Have Powers of Creation and Destruction 
First appears in Pokémon the Series: XY movie, Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction


 







Representing the forces of life and death, these two Pokémon are part of a Legendary trio from Kalos. Hundreds of years ago, Yveltal&#39;s ability to absorb life energy almost caused it to destroy life in Allearth Forest. However, through a stunning display of light, Xerneas infused the forest with life energy and reversed the damage. After completing its lifespan, the Dark Pokémon transforms into a cocoon to sleep, while its Fairy counterpart transforms into a tree to replenish its life energy. The two Pokémon use their opposing powers to maintain the natural order of the world and, as dual forces of nature, are equally matched in battle.





 8  Zygarde Protects The Planet&#39;s Equilibrium 
First appears in Pokémon the Series: XY
        

Zygarde is the third member of Kalos&#39; Legendary Trio and is known as the keeper of the natural order. It closely watches Xerneas and Yveltal to ensure they are maintaining the natural balance and protecting the ecosystem. The Ground-type Pokémon is made up of Cores and Cells and has three different forms resembling creatures from Norse Mythology. It only assembles its complete form when there is a serious threat to the planet, becoming much more powerful than its life-and-death counterparts. A Zygarde Core escapes from Lysandre Labs and is found by Bonnie, who calls it &#34;Squishy&#34;. It later transforms into its complete form when the Azoth Kingdom is threatened.





 7  Eternatus Almost Destroyed The Galar Region 
First appears in Pokémon Journeys: The Series
        

Eternatus&#39; nightmare-inducing appearance comes with equally frightening powers. Having arrived via a meteor over 20,000 years ago, the Pokémon absorbed Galar&#39;s energy and caused a black storm to appear over the region in a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day. This event occurs again in the present day after it is captured by Macro Cosmos. The dual-type Pokémon absorbs Galar Particles from the region and causes the Dynamax and Gigantamax phenomena, which are transformations that cause Pokémon to change their forms. When it suddenly absorbs large amounts of energy, Eternatus transforms into its Eternamax form. This allows it to potentially rip holes in space-time and release infinite levels of energy.





 6  Kyogre and Groudon Are Even More Powerful In Their Primal Forms 
First appears in Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire
        

Often called the Super-ancient Pokémon, the two are part of an ancient elemental trio that is said to have played a role in forming the Hoenn region. In prehistoric times, Kyogre, a Water-type, gave rise to the oceans, while Groudon, a Ground-type, expanded the continents. Through their battle for dominance, they nearly destroyed the world, forcing humans to create the Red and Blue Orbs to calm them in the future. The Pokémon make several appearances throughout the anime and are feared for their ability to generate natural disasters through their clashes. It&#39;s speculated by Steven that the Pokémon are fighting over an energy source called the Giant Rock.

 5  Rayquaza Is The First Pokémon to Mega Evolve 
First appears in Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys
        

Rayquaza is the master of the lithosphere and a Dragon/Flying-type from the Super-ancient trio. Having control of the atmosphere, the Pokémon served as a mediator during Kyogre and Groudon&#39;s world-shattering conflicts, overwhelming the two with its power. Having a snake-like appearance, Rayquaza becomes aggressive when it perceives a threat to its territory, such as when Deoxys emerges from a falling meteorite. In a special episode of Pokémon the Series: XY, Lysandre and Steven accidentally summon the Pokémon, which then evolves into Mega Rayquaza and awakens the rest of the Weather Trio. This version of the Sky Master is more threatening than its predecessor and is often considered one of the strongest Pokémon in the world.





 4  Necrozma Is A Dangerous Extraterrestrial Pokémon 
First appears in Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon


 







Necrozma is a terrifying Pokémon from Ultra Space, which is an interdimensional realm only accessible by portal. Its light once radiated through different dimensions, until it lost the ability to shine and entered a berserk state. While Necrozma&#39;s ability to steal light from other worlds makes it scary enough, the psychic Pokémon can also merge with Solangelo and Lunala to create new forms. This allows it to open Ultra Wormholes and evade capture by the Ultra Guardians. It is eventually restored to its original form of Ultra Necrozma, regaining the power to create light and becoming a benevolent Pokémon once more. Despite this, it has the potential to once again become a cosmic threat in the future.





 3  Dialga and Palkia Are The Masters Of Time And Space 
First appears in Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai
        

According to legend, the Pokémon of Myth were created when the universe began. The two Dragon-types were then given dominion over the elements of reality, with Dialga having total control over time, and Palkia having full command over space. The Pokémon reside in separate dimensions and have the power to create or destroy universes at will. When the Temporal and Spatial Worlds intersect, the territorial beings have a destructive battle in the Unown Dimension. When they later move to Alamos Town, their power is so great that it causes distortions in time and space, threatening to destroy the universe. In the past, Dialga and Palkia were worshiped as deities by two clans from the Sinnoh region.





 2  Giratina Can Open Portals Through Any Dimension 
First appears in Pokémon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior
        

The final Pokémon of Myth, Giratina was created alongside Dialga and Palkia. However, its potential for destruction was so great that it was banished to the Reverse World, an alternate dimension where time and space don&#39;t exist. Just like its compatriots, Giratina has full control over an element of reality and represents antimatter. In its Origin Forme, it can freely travel through dimensions and can potentially rip a hole through space-time. While the Pokémon&#39;s powers already make it a cosmic-level danger, its violent nature makes it even more prone to destruction. This is shown when Giratina seeks revenge against Dialga after the Pokémon&#39;s battle with Palkia causes toxic pollution to appear in the Reverse World.

 1  Arceus Is The Original Creator Of The Universe 
First appears in Pokémon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life


 







When Arceus was born, it willed the universe into existence and created the three Pokémon of Myth. With its godlike powers, it serves as a deity for the Pokémon world and protects it from catastrophic events. Arceus is also the only Pokémon with Multitype, which is a move that allows it to transform into any of the 18 existing types. It is sometimes classified as a Mythical Pokémon due to its extreme rarity and has a series of Plates that infuse its body with life energy. When Dialga and Palkia&#39;s worlds intersect, it&#39;s revealed that Arceus&#39; awakening caused distortions in space-time. With its near-omnipotent power, Arceus is easily the anime&#39;s strongest Legendary Pokémon.
