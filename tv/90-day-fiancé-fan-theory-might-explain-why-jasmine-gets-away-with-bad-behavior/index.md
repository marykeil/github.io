## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé viewers discuss what makes Jasmine Pineda keep insulting Gino Palazzolo on the show and never give him the respect a partner deserves.




Many 90 Day Fiancé viewers have theorized the real reason behind Jasmine Pineda’s terrible behavior toward Gino Palazzolo. The 36-year-old Panamanian model has been with her Michigan-based beau for years. In 2023, she came to the United States on a k-1 visa to marry him. Unfortunately for her, things didn’t go as smoothly as planned. When Jasmine landed in Michigan, she realized it was too cold for her. Soon after, she had to deal with Gino’s shady behavior, followed by her future in-laws’ skepticism.




Recently, Redditor MeringueTop151 discussed how Jasmine gets away with bad behavior toward Gino. Many others theorized that the Panamanian woman has a habit of using her abandonment issues to make herself look like the victim in every situation. A Redditor wrote, “Those ‘abandonment issues’ are now being brought up to justify her behavior,” adding that there’s no excuse for Jasmine’s abusive behavior toward Gino.


 

Another commented, “She now is trying the abandonment issues line to try and clean up her image.” People think that Jasmine is manipulating everyone by using her emotional state and phobia as an excuse for her terrible personality.

Jasmine’s bad behavior toward Gino became evident in 2021 when she debuted in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. At the time, she accused him of infidelity for being nice to a waitress. Jasmine tried to hurt Gino’s feelings after that since he didn’t bow down to her spoiled demands. She claimed she had sex with her ex-boyfriend and trashed Gino’s masculinity on reality TV. In a recent 90 Day Fiancé episode, Jasmine had a meltdown after finding lip gloss in Gino’s car. Once again, she verbally abused him and threatened to leave him.

The fan theory about Jasmine makes sense, considering her past. She does have abandonment issues from her previous relationships. However, she has begun using those as excuses for her every bad action nowadays. Jasmine must own up to her mistakes instead of treating herself like a victim. Plenty of people have faced far worse hardships in their lives. She should be thankful that Gino puts up with her regardless of her behavior. Jasmine is nearly 37, but she is still not mature enough. She has a lot of growing up to do.




Reality TV may be another reason for Jasmine’s bad behavior. She tends to go over the top while appearing on 90 Day Fiancé. Since her debut in 2021, Jasmine has been part of numerous viral moments with Gino. She shows a very different side to herself on social media. She seems to be level-headed on Instagram. She’s rarely unreasonable in her posts like she is on 90 Day Fiancé.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
