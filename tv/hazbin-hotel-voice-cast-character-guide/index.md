## Literature Review

Hazbin Hotel required a talented cast of singers to pull off its musical premise, with stars like Erika Henningsen and Stephanie Beatriz taking lead. 




Hazbin Hotel introduces a variety of unique characters, and it takes a cast of talented voice actors to bring them to life. The series, based on Vivienne Medrano&#39;s successful webcomic series of the same name, is an adult-animation comedy set in Hell and, therefore, follows a unique and exciting premise. As a musical, a cast of talented singers was a must for Hazbin Hotel, so Broadway stars like Erika Henningsen, Stephanie Beatriz, Krystina Alabado, and many more were brought on board.




Vivienne &#34;VivziePop&#34; Medrano&#39;s Hazbin Hotel series got its start with the creator&#39;s webcomics, and she created a pilot that was released on YouTube back in 2019. Shortly after, an entire TV series was ordered by A24 in August 2020, but delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meant a long road to making season 1 a reality. Finally, Hazbin Hotel premiered in January 2024, bringing comedy, musical theater, LGBTQ&#43; representation, and an excellent voice cast to the screen after a wait that proved to be entirely worth it.

 Erika Henningsen As Charlie Morningstar 
          




Actor Erika Henningsen was born and raised in Moraga, California, and began her theater career at a young age. She is best known for originating the role of Cady Heron in the Tony-nominated Broadway musical adaptation of Mean Girls—a role which earned her an Outer Circle Critics Award. Henningsen also had a reoccurring role playing Young Gloria in the 2021 series Girls5eva before landing the lead voice role of Charlie Morningstar in Hazbin Hotel.

Henningsen&#39;s character, a hellborn demon, is the star of Hazbin Hotel. Daughter of Lucifer, Charlie is the founder of the titular hotel, which she hopes will be an opportunity to redeem sinners and thus solve Hell&#39;s overpopulation problem.



 Stephanie Beatriz As Vaggie 
          

Born in Neuquén, Argentina, actor Stephanie Beatriz is best known for playing Detective Rosa Diaz in the NBC series Brooklyn Nine-Nine from 2013 to 2021, Carla in the 2021 movie adaptation of In the Heights, and for lending her voice to the lead heroine, Mirabel Madrigal, in the 2021 Disney film Encanto. Beatriz&#39;s other notable voice roles include General Sweet Mayhem in 2019&#39;s The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part and Chloe Barbash in The Bob&#39;s Burgers Movie in 2022.




Beatriz lends her voice to Vaggie in Hazbin Hotel, Charlie&#39;s devoted girlfriend. Vaggie is far more level-headed than her partner and is fiercely protective and devastatingly powerful. However, all of this conceals a gentle heart.



 Blake Roman As Angel Dust 
          

Actor and musician Blake Roman was born and raised in Erie, Pennsylvania. According to his official website, he now lives in New York City and is building his career in voice-over, film, television, and theater. Roman is most known for playing Chopin in the Broadway musical Harmony. He also played Peter Guerrero in the Paramount&#43; series Blue Bloods.

Roman plays Angel Dust in Hazbin Hotel, one of the titular hotel&#39;s first seemingly irredeemable residents. A flamboyantly eccentric porn star, Angel Dust is resistant to Charlie&#39;s mission of fixing up Hell&#39;s sinners but is ultimately affected by her nonetheless.






 Amir Talai As Alastor 
          

Amir Talai is an Iranian-American actor primarily known for his voice work, though he also appeared in various movies and TV series. Talai has lent his voice to series like Family Guy, American Dad, and Hollywood Residential and notably took over the role of Crane in Netflix&#39;s Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. As far as movies, the actor played Raza in Harold and Kumar&#39;s Escape from Guantanamo Bay in 2008 and Patel in the 2012 movie What to Expect When You&#39;re Expecting.

Talai&#39;s character in Hazbin Hotel, Alastor, is one of the powerful Overlords of Hell, also known as the Radio Demon. Charismatic as they come, Alastor is good at convincing others that he is on their side, which is precisely what he does to Charlie. Of course, his intentions are far from honorable.






 Keith David As Husk 
          

Born in Harlem, New York City, and raised in Queens, Keith David has had an active career since the 1980s. The Emmy-winner is best known for narrating Ken Burnes films, including 2007&#39;s The War and 2021&#39;s Muhammad Ali.

In the world of television, David has lent his voice to series such as Gargoyles, Adventure Time, Rick and Morty, Pluto, and now, Hazbin Hotel.

David voices a character named Husk, a cranky magician who works as a bartender at the Hazbin Hotel. Endlessly cynical, Husk is the comedic balance to Charlie&#39;s optimism. However, his backstory reveals that there is far more to his character.



 Kimiko Glenn As Niffty 
          




Kimiko Glenn, born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona, is best known for playing Brook Soso in the Netflix hit series Orange is the New Black, a role which earned her several Screen Actors Guild Awards.

In addition to this, the actor voices Stefani Stilton in BoJack Horseman, Izzy Moonbow in My Little Pony: A New Generation, and Paper Star in Carmen Sandiego.

Glenn&#39;s character, Niffty, is a Cyclops demon originating from the 1950s. She serves as the Hazbin Hotel&#39;s overly enthusiastic cleaning lady. Described as a hyperactive cyclops, Nifty is yet another surprising addition to the leagues of Hell.

Brightman plays Sir Pentious, a Victorian-era, serpent-like demon eager to adapt to the modern age. Sit Pentious is memorable for the steam-punk weapons of his own invention, as well as his army of Egg Boiz. He starts as a significant antagonist, but Hazbin Hotel reveals that there is far more to him than only this.
