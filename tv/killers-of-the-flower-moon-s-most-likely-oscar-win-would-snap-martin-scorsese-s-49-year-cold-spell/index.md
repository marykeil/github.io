# Killers Of The Flower Moon s Most Likely Oscar Win Would Snap Martin Scorsese s 49-Year Cold Spell


## SUMMARY 



  Killers of the Flower Moon has garnered critical acclaim and numerous nominations, but faces stiff competition from other dominant films in the ongoing award season.   Lily Gladstone&#39;s portrayal in the film has positioned her as the best chance for the movie to secure at least one Oscar, particularly for Best Actress.   If Gladstone wins the Best Actress Oscar, she will break a 49-year-old cold spell for Martin Scorsese, who hasn&#39;t had a Best Actress win since 1975.

## Literature Review

A Killers of the Flower Moon Oscar win in one particular category would break a decades-long cold spell for the movie&#39;s director, Martin Scorsese.




Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s most likely Oscar win would break a half-decade-long cold spell Martin Scorsese films have had in one particular category. Scorsese&#39;s epic Western boasts rave reviews and critical acclaim, fashioning it as a noteworthy film contender in several categories throughout the ongoing award season. Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s true story, which depicts the Osage Nation murders during the era of history known as the Reign of Terror, is the standout element of the film - though the epic&#39;s reception also acknowledges its phenomenal ensemble cast, striking production design, and original score as considerable strengths as well.




Already, Killers of the Flower Moon enjoys hundreds of nominations and a slew of wins representing all aspects of the film. Although it relishes notable considerations from the National Board of Review, the Golden Globes, and more, Killers of the Flower Moon often loses out in the competition of awards to dominating films like Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie and Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer. The stiff competition this season will likely overshadow Killers of the Flower Moon at the upcoming Oscars ceremony, but the film has a solid shot at triumph in one category that would mark history for Scorsese.



The Oscars will air on Sunday, March 10, 2024.





 Lily Gladstone Has Become Killers Of The Flower Moon&#39;s Best Chance To Win An Oscar 
          




Since Oppenheimer, in particular, continues to prevail this award season, Killers of the Flower Moon is overlooked in the consideration of bigger award categories. With wins like the Critics Choice Award for Best Picture, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and the Satellite Award for Best Ensemble, Oppenheimer has proven victorious at a number of ceremonies, becoming a favorite choice in most all categories except Best Actress. Remarkably, Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s lead, Lily Gladstone, has commanded the category and has become the movie&#39;s best chance at securing at least one Oscar in the midst of such competition.

For her portrayal as Mollie in Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s cast, Gladstone has won crucial best actress awards on behalf of institutions like the National Board of Review and has made history as the first star of Blackfeet and Nimiipuu heritage to win a Golden Globe (via Harper&#39;s Bazaar). Gladstone&#39;s winning streak consequently positions her as the contender most likely to score the coveted Oscar Award for Best Actress. Her triumphant strides are seemingly set to continue, and granted she secures the Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon, Gladstone will even break a 49-year-old Scorsese cold spell.






 Lily Gladstone Could Be Scorsese&#39;s First Best Actress Oscar Winner Since 1975 
          

There hasn&#39;t been a Best Actress Oscar winner to emerge out of a Scorsese-directed film since 1975. Ellen Burstyn won for her role as Alice Hyatt in Scorsese&#39;s romantic comedy drama Alice Doesn&#39;t Live Here Anymore, but his movies don&#39;t often give rise to Best Actress Oscar winners. In fact, most actress nominations that emerged from Scorsese movies come in the category of Best Supporting Actress, and only one other actress, Sharon Stone of Casino, was ever nominated for the lauded Best Actress Oscar award.

If Gladstone secures the Oscar for Best Actress, she will be Scorsese&#39;s first Best Actress Oscar winner since Burstyn. The achievement, while just a minor aspect in the grand scheme of her massively successful award season run, is a testament to her monumental and history-making effort as a theatrical performer. This March, the Oscars will reveal the winner of the Best Actress award, which may prove exceptionally fruitful for both Gladstone in her sensational Killers of the Flower Moon performance and Scorsese&#39;s winning track record in film.
