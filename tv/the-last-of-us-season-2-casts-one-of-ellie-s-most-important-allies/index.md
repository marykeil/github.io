## Literature Review
In an exciting The Last Of Us season 2 casting announcement, it’s been confirmed that Dina, one of Ellie’s key allies, now has an actor attached.




The Last of Us season 2 has now officially cast Dina, one of Ellie&#39;s biggest allies. Based on the popular Naughty Dog video game franchise, the hit HBO adaptation premiered last year, bringing the post-apocalyptic story of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) to life in live-action. The show is now preparing to enter into production on season 2, which will include some exciting additions to The Last of Us&#39; cast.




Now, as the wait continues for The Last of Us season 2, Deadline reports that Dina, a key figure from the second game, has been cast. Actor Isabela Merced (Sicario: Day of the Soldado) will take on the role, with the character set to serve as Ellie&#39;s love interest. Co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann released a statement on Merced&#39;s casting, which is included below:


“Dina is warm, brilliant, wild, funny, moral, dangerous and instantly lovable. You can search forever for an actor who effortlessly embodies all of those things, or you can find Isabela Merced right away. We couldn’t be prouder to have her join our family.”


  


 What To Expect From Dina In The Last Of Us Season 2 
          




Although there was speculation that Dina may have made a brief cameo in The Last of Us season 1, Merced&#39;s casting affirms that the character is set to have a much bigger role this time around. Dina doesn&#39;t feature in Naughty Dog&#39;s debut game in the franchise, and is introduced in the 2020 sequel when Ellie is 19 years old. In the games, the two characters meet in the community of Jackson, Wyoming, eventually striking up a romantic relationship.



Filming on The Last of Us season 2 is reported to be getting underway in early February, with release likely set for some point in 2025.




After the shocking Last of Us season 1 finale, Mazin and Druckmann confirmed that season 2 will not necessarily follow the second game beat for beat. Two other recent casting announcements, however, suggest certain elements from the game will be included. This includes the introduction of Abby, who is now confirmed to be played by Kaitlyn Dever, and Jesse, who will be played by Young Mazino. Dina, in the games, was previously in a relationship with Jesse, suggesting a love triangle of sorts could be coming in season 2.




The Last of Us season 1 reviews were glowing, with particular praise levied at the talented cast of actors assembled. Merced certainly has the resume to suggest she will make a strong addition to the show, with the actor having previously showed off her range in projects like Sicario: Day of the Soldado, Transformers: The Last Night, and Dora and the Lost City of Gold. With The Last of Us season 2 filming having not yet started yet, however, it will likely be quite a while before audiences get to see Merced in action as Dina.



The Last of Us season 1 is currently available to stream on Max.
