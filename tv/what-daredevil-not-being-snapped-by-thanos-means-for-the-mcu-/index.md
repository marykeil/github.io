## Literature Review
Marvel confirmed that Daredevil survived Thanos&#39; snap, and this revelation could have an impact on what&#39;s happening with the character in the MCU.




Marvel confirmed that Daredevil survived Thanos&#39; snap, and this revelation could have major consequences for his character&#39;s place in the MCU. Marvel never officially declared if the Netflix shows were canon to the mainstream MCU, but Echo seemingly made it official. Kingpin&#39;s incident with his father makes it clear that this is likely the same Wilson Fisk from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil. This means that the snap would have impacted the Netflix characters and there is a detail in Echo that answers if Daredevil and Kingpin survived.




The fight between Echo and Daredevil takes place between 2018 and 2025. It&#39;s after Ronin killed Maya&#39;s father but before the events of Hawkeye. So, the fight between the pair of them likely took place during the blip, meaning Daredevil, Echo, and Kingpin were a part of the lucky half who survived the snap. While this could be a minor detail, there are also several ways this could affect the MCU, along with the escalating conflict between Daredevil and Kingpin.

 New York City Had An MCU Hero During The Blip Despite Missing Spider-Man 
          

Everyone remembers watching Peter Parker turn to dust in Avengers: Infinity War and it left New York City without a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. However, Daredevil being left alive means New York was not without a hero. Matt Murdock still kept the city&#39;s criminal underbelly in check, and he was probably helping people as a lawyer as well. There were several Avengers still left in the universe, but they didn&#39;t know about this criminal underworld like Daredevil did. Plus, characters like Hawkeye had taken a turn to the dark side.




Since Echo seemingly made the Netflix universe canon, it means there&#39;s a chance that Daredevil wasn&#39;t the only New York hero left. There is a possibility that other heroes like Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Iron Fist survived the snap and could have saved the day in their own way. Since Daredevil made his MCU debut in Spider-Man: No Way Home, it&#39;s unclear what he did during the blip, and it would be fascinating to find out.



All five episodes of Echo are now streaming on Disney&#43; and Hulu.






 Daredevil&#39;s MCU History Has Even More Mysteries To Solve 
         

The last time audiences saw Daredevil in his own story, he defeated Kingpin for the second time and sent him back to jail. However, Hawkeye confirmed that Kingpin got out and Echo suggests that he has been out of prison for some time. Daredevil&#39;s fight with Echo and Kingpin&#39;s reaction gives the impression that Daredevil is still doing whatever it takes to take down Kingpin and is a consistent nuisance for him.




Still, there isn&#39;t much known about what Daredevil was doing during the blip, and there is a lot of mystery surrounding Matt&#39;s character. Even though he interacted with She-Hulk, he never discussed what he did during the blip or what had happened to him since Daredevil season 3. What is known is that he is still working as a lawyer as he represented Spider-Man, Happy Hogan, and Leap-Frog, while still providing extra justice as Daredevil. It&#39;s also unclear what happened to all the characters in his mini-universe, including Foggy Nelson and Karen Page.



 Daredevil &amp; Kingpin&#39;s Conflict Seemingly Takes Place Throughout The Blip 
          

In Echo, Kingpin tells Maya that she held her own against Daredevil better than most of his other men did. This confirms that Fisk and Murdock have had a long conflict where Daredevil has interfered with his work, and this continued throughout the blip. Their conflict will carry over to Daredevil: Born Again, and there could be plenty left to learn about how much their conflict has escalated. Audiences who know the storyline of the Born Again comic book know that it&#39;s a dark, brutal story that capitalizes on Kingpin and Daredevil&#39;s long-brewing conflict.




However, it&#39;s most likely that Marvel would avoid a story that dark, especially as it presents drastic character turns for people like Matt and Karen. The post-credit scene of Echo showed Fisk&#39;s budding interest in running for mayor of New York, which is already different from the comics. Still, Daredevil and Kingpin have a burning hatred for each other, and it will be fascinating to find out how it&#39;s been building in the MCU and to finally see it come to a boiling point when Daredevil: Born Again debuts.
