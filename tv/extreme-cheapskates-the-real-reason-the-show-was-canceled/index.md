## Literature Review
Extreme Cheapstakes was canceled back in 2014, but there seems to be confusion as to why. Here&#39;s the real reason why the series was canceled.




Extreme Cheapskates featured exceptionally frugal individuals, but there are questions regarding why the reality TV series was canceled. Featured on the same network as hit series such as 90 Day FiancÃ©, My 600-Lb Life, and Welcome To Plathville, the show documents participants&#39; unconventional methods for saving money, often going to extreme and disturbing lengths. From dumpster diving for everyday food and clothing to reusing items indefinitely and even collecting rainwater for personal use, the folks featured on Extreme Cheapskates would famously do anything to save a buck. It was often difficult to watch but equally difficult to look away.




Personal wealth had little effect on who was featured as a cheapskate on the show. For example, millionaire Aimee appeared on Extreme Cheapskates season 2. While the methods featured on the show may raise eyebrows, Extreme Cheapskates highlighted cast members&#39; dedication to extreme frugality. An offshoot of Extreme Couponing, the show took saving money to the next level. The network features many shows with folks living alternative lifestyles, but it&#39;s unclear why this one was canceled when shows that cause viewers to ogle at others, like Doctor Pimple Popper and Sister Wives, are still on air. Why was the controversial show canceled, and will it ever come back?


 It&#39;s Unknown Why Extreme Cheapskates Was Canceled 
However, There Are Theories
          

             Extreme Cheapskates   Release Date   December 28, 2011    Genres   Reality    Rating   TV-PG    Network   TLC    Streaming Service(s)   HBO Max       




The network that aired Extreme Cheapskates has yet to reveal why the show was canceled. However, there is ample speculation. According to an article published by The List, it&#39;s possible the show was canceled for being too extreme for viewers. Other theories include a propensity for producers to encourage cast members to go to greater lengths to increase ratings. On the flip side, it&#39;s possible the show was canceled because it wasn&#39;t as popular as other shows on the channel.

While not corroborated by the network, a Reddit theory claimed Extreme Cheapskates was canceled partly because it was fake. In the post, u/Psymarc claimed that some cast members were actors, leading to the belief that the extreme cost-cutting measures in the show were fake. In the post, the user explains, &#34;Proof that TLC&#39;s Extreme Cheapskates is fake: &#34;Christina Oster&#34; from Worst Cooks in America (left) is also &#34;Kia Campbridge (right) from Extreme Cheapskates.&#34; Another user provided a Staff Me Up link to Christina Oster, appearing to back up the original Reddit user&#39;s claim.






 Extreme Cheapskates Wasn&#39;t For &#34;Weak Stomachs&#34; 
Cast Members Showcased Gross Practices
          

According to The List, Extreme Cheapskates wasn&#39;t for &#34;weak stomachs&#34; for various reasons, but the bottom line was that many of the practices cast members showcased were disgusting to the average person. For example, one of the grosser practices was dumpster diving behind grocery stores and other businesses. Other folks featured on the show reused dental floss or didn&#39;t flush toilets to save water. Perhaps one of the grossest scenes was a family using a swimming pool to wash dishes after their children splashed around.



 Extreme Cheapskates Was Disturbing To Watch At Times 
The Participants Went Too Far


 
Its gross nature encompasses many reasons Extreme Cheapskates was disturbing to watch. The show sometimes depicted situations that were creepy or disturbing. For example, one participant was shown dumpster diving for food thrown away at her workplace. Another was shown collecting rainwater for personal use. Other disturbing moments included a cast member reusing the same piece of toilet paper for several weeks, another eating roadkill she had found on the side of the road, and yet another collecting rainwater in the bathtub to save on water bills.






 Will Extreme Cheapskates Be Renewed One Day? 
Was The Show Canceled Too Soon?
          

The cancelation of Extreme Cheapskates is shrouded in mystery, so it&#39;s no surprise whether or not it will be renewed is also unknown. Many other shows on the network are incredibly popular, so it seems unnecessary to revive a show that caused such controversy and didn&#39;t provide the ratings other shows garner. While an offshoot of Extreme Couponing, in practice, the show just didn&#39;t land. Whether because the participants were too gross or the premise was faked, Extreme Cheapskates was a disappointment for the network. Perhaps as folks continue to grapple with increased prices, a renewed interest in frugality will rise, but for now, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a renewal on the horizon for Extreme Cheapskates.
