## Literature Review
Sophie Sierra and Rob Warne have been hinting at a split on social media. Fans discover if they stayed together after 90 Day Fiancé season 10.




90 Day Fiancé couple Rob Warne and Sophie Sierra’s relationship status in 2024 has been revealed by a major clue spotted on the couple’s social media pages. Rob, 32, and Sophie, 23, currently star in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Sophie, who&#39;s from England, had DM&#39;d Rob after spotting his profile on a page about mixed-race men. The biracial Sophie and Rob started dating and got engaged, with Sophie moving to the U.S. to marry Rob. What bothered Sophie was Rob’s house, which didn’t have a bathroom, and his tendency to cheat online. Meanwhile, rumors began spreading online about the couple’s split off-screen.




However, Reddit user Lemmeglow shared a post captioned, “Rob &amp; Sophie are STILL together!” with a big clue about the couple’s relationship status.


 

The fan investigated the couple’s Instagram profiles to see if they were still together. They took a screenshot of Rob’s Instagram Story in which a kitchen with a neon pink sign and a soft pink sofa was visible behind him. The fan also provided a screenshot of an Instagram Reel video from Sophie’s page showing the same pink neon sign glowing in the background from the kitchen. “Is that why Rob &amp; Sophie unfollowed each other to pretend that they’re not together?” the fan asked fellow viewers.

 Rob &amp; Sophie&#39;s Split Rumors Explained 
          

Rob and Sophie have neither confirmed nor denied their current relationship status in real life. Still, rumors of their split started with Sophie confirming that she moved into her own apartment in October 2023. Sophie had filmed a Get Ready With Me video in which she did her skincare routine and said that she has a bathroom now and is “pretty happy” about having her “own bathroom.” Sophie had shared the video after fans watched her quarreling with Rob on 90 Day Fiancé about the bathroom outside his apartment, which has poor lighting. Sophie, who came from a wealthy background, was not comfortable with the living situation.


 




Meanwhile, Sophie’s updates from Austin, Texas, on social media confirmed she was no longer living in Los Angeles. The couple did not follow each other. Rob and Sophie did not have any posts together to hint at them being married, which was one of the biggest clues about a possible split. Rob was not happy with Sophie’s decision to not have kids, despite her having a medical issue to avoid pregnancy. Sophie was also hiding her sexuality from Rob but eventually came out to him on the show to avoid any more disagreements. In the latest 90 Day Fiancé episode, Rob lashed out at Sophie’s mom, Claire Sierra.

Claire wasn’t impressed that Rob’s apartment was small and didn’t have a bathroom, which set him off. He screamed at Claire and Sophie. Claire wasn’t a big fan of “Rob the knob” because he didn&#39;t have a proper job to support her daughter in America. Regardless, Sophie and Rob are seemingly still together and living in the same house, which has a functional bathroom inside. In all likelihood, Sophie and Rob got married on 90 Day Fiancé, which was filmed over two years ago, and haven’t broken up as they’d like their fans to believe.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
