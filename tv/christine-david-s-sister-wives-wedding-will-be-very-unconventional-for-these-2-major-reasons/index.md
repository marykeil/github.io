## Literature Review
Christine Brown from Sister Wives is glad she didn’t follow two significant traditions in her short and simple wedding with David Woolley.




Christine Brown’s wedding with David Woolley will be one of a kind for Sister Wives viewers to watch. The mom of six recently settled with her new husband. Before that, she was married to polygamous man Kody Brown, who didn’t give her the love she deserved. Christine spent nearly 30 years with her last husband. However, his lack of acknowledgment and care made her want to focus on herself. In 2023, Christine met David and immediately fell in love. She felt he was her soulmate and didn’t wait long before tying the knot with him in October.




Christine and David’s Sister Wives season 18 wedding is going to be truly special. However, it won’t be the traditional American wedding viewers are used to seeing in the United States. Recently, Christine talked to InTouch and revealed that her wedding, as seen in the upcoming two-part special, will be unconventional because there aren&#39;t any vows. She said, “We wanted it small. We wanted it short.” Christine explained that her goal was to have a very intimate ceremony with David. Therefore, she chose to do some things differently. The Sister Wives star added, “There weren’t any vows or anything like that.”

 Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding Won&#39;t Have Bridesmaids Or Groomsmen 
          




Besides vows, Christine and David’s wedding will have a lack of other traditional activities. Christine said she opted for a wedding without bridesmaids and groomsmen because she wanted her family members to walk her down the aisle. She told In Touch, “We just wanted all of our grandkids there and our daughters and my son walking me down.” Christine shared that her dream did come true, and she was happy to be surrounded by her loved ones. She confirmed, “We didn’t have anyone up there with us though.”


 

It’s great to see how Christine’s life turned around within a year. A few years ago, she was struggling to find a purpose in life after being abandoned by Kody during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was hurt and didn’t know how to make her marriage work. Thankfully, Christine realized something was worth giving up on. She tried her best to make her last marriage work but eventually gave up on polygamy because it didn’t give her the happiness she wanted from her life. Christine realized her God wanted her to be happy.




Christine’s choices for her wedding are a little surprising. However, the changes won’t make her new marriage any less than the traditional ones. The Utah woman tried to follow the customs and serve her former husband the best she could. She deserves a bit of freedom now that she’s no longer a polygamous woman. Christine’s choice of not having anyone stand with her and David is fine. It’s also okay for her not to have any vows when she’s wholeheartedly committed to David. The Sister Wives cast member’s choice of only wanting her family members to accompany her down the aisle is also lovely.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
