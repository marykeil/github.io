## Literature Review

Despite True Detective season 1&#39;s critical acclaim, True Detective: Night Country has already proven one major problem with the series&#39; first season.




Spoiler Warning: This article contains spoilers to True Detective: Night Country




Despite the critical acclaim of the first season of HBO&#39;s True Detective, True Detective: Night Country has already demonstrated one of the acclaimed first season&#39;s biggest weaknesses in just one episode. As is par for the course with crime dramas, the True Detective: Night Country theories after episode 1 aid significantly in recontextualizing the show&#39;s events, thus compelling audiences to reconsider the direction the case is headed in. While it&#39;s still too soon to tell whether there will be a True Detective season 5, True Detective: Night Country is already shaping up to be one of the best seasons.

Although the reception of Night Country and True Detective season 1 is positive, True Detective: Night Country is superior in one major area that the first season perpetually came up short. While there are plenty of crime dramas with compelling characters, well-written drama, and genuinely unexpected twists and turns, True Detective sets itself apart from the rest by thrusting its characters and, by relation, the audience, into different time periods, thus effectively giving each case a greater sense of scope. However, despite True Detective&#39;s brilliant first season, it failed in one area in which Night Country excels.




                  True Detective: Night Country&#39;s Secret Connection To Mike Flanagan&#39;s Hit Show May Solve Its Biggest Mystery   True Detective: Night Country&#39;s hidden connections with a hit Mike Flanagan Netflix series might provide answers to some of its biggest mysteries.   


 True Detective: Night Country Is Fixing The Show&#39;s Approach To Women 
Jodie Fosters&#39;s Liz Danvers and Kali Reis&#39;s Evangeline Navarro have complexity.
As seen in the premiere, the season is led by Jodie Foster&#39;s Chief Liz Danvers and Kali Reis&#39; Trooper Evangeline Navarro, two women working with True Detective: Night Country&#39;s Alaskan Police Force (APF), attempting to solve a bizarre disappearance of a remote group of scientists that might be linked to the prior murder of an Indigenous woman. With the show&#39;s complex female leads, the constant reinforcement of women&#39;s importance to the story, and showrunner Issa LÃ³pez dictating the flow and direction of True Detective: Night Country, it has a decidedly distinct feel from previous seasons.

Furthermore, the women in True Detective: Night Country don&#39;t suffer from the same &#34;Mary Sue&#34; issue that has sometimes plagued other projects that try too hard to sell audiences on their female protagonists&#39; abilities. The women in True Detective: Night Country are just as flawed as their previous male counterparts. Liz and Evangeline&#39;s strong personalities and their personal connections to the case and the world of Ennis, Alaska, make them both compelling characters to follow. With True Detective: Night Country&#39;s strong female cast and characters, it&#39;s already rectifying many of True Detective season 1&#39;s biggest mistakes.






 Why True Detective Season 1&#39;s Female Characters Were So Problematic 
The female characters in True Detective&#39;s first season were badly written.
          

Although True Detective season 1 has solidified itself as the best season among the original three seasons, its greatest weakness lies in its handling of its female characters. While Michelle Monaghan&#39;s Maggie Hart character bodes better than most other women, she ultimately fell prey to clunky writing that gradually saw her fall from a dignified woman to an emotional wreck courtesy of her husband&#39;s infidelity, Woody Harrelson&#39;s Marty Hart. As such, much of her dialogue from the latter half of the season consists of crying and lashing out in a way that undermines her previous complexity and strength.

Alexandra Daddario&#39;s Lisa Tragnetti character bodes even worse than Maggie in that she&#39;s in the show purely as eye candy. Other than her sex scene with Marty that breaks Marty&#39;s family apart and her attempt to get Matthew McConaughey&#39;s Rust Cohle to go on a date with one of her friends, she serves no real purpose to the story. With other female characters merely portrayed as sex workers and Marty&#39;s oldest daughter sleeping with multiple guys at the same time, the female characters are reduced to objects, a real disappointment considering the rest of the series&#39; quality.






 True Detective: Night Country Needed To Change The Franchise&#39;s Approach 
True Detective season 1 raised the bar in every other aspect of the crime drama.
         

Although True Detective&#39;s second season somewhat corrected season 1&#39;s lackluster female characters, with Rachel McAdams as Detective Sergeant Antigone &#34;Ani&#34; Bezzerides, she still fell victim to some of the negative tropes associated with female characters. She used sex as an empowering tool and was an overall wreck who essentially needed a man to save her from herself. While Ani proved to be one of the more competent female characters in the entire True Detective franchise, her sister&#39;s work as a sex worker once again perpetuated the negative stereotype that women are only as useful as the sex they sell.

Although it&#39;s still very early, thus leaving everything subject to change, True Detective: Night Country feels like it will remain committed to depicting multidimensional female characters. Liz&#39;s no-nonsense attitude reinforces how she became police chief, and Evangeline&#39;s tough exterior and persistence display her aptitude to be a great officer of the law. True Detective: Night Country&#39;s emphasis on complex and outspoken women solving a case involving Indigenous women&#39;s tongues being cut out is a strong metaphor for the previously silenced women of the series, and a much-needed change in direction for the show.
