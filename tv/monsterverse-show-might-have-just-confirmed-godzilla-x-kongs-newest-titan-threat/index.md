# Monsterverse Show Might Have Just Confirmed Godzilla X Kongs Newest Titan Threat


## SUMMARY 



  Episode 8 of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters reveals a parallel storyline that references a mysterious Titan in the 1950s timeline, potentially posing a major threat to Godzilla.   The show brings back a forgotten Titan tease from five years ago, hinting at a Titan located in Siberia that may be linked to a new dragon Titan named Shimo with ice-based powers.   It is speculated that Shimo has been dormant in the Hollow Earth since the 1950s and may play a significant role in Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire, although it is unlikely to be officially revealed in the TV show.

## Literature Review
A throwaway observation in the 1950s timeline of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters may actually have been a reference to a mysterious modern Titan.




Episode 8 of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters contained a number of key revelations, and it may have also made reference to a mysterious Titan that will threaten the world in Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire. The first TV show set in Legendary&#39;s Monsterverse has delved deeper into the origins of the Titan-tracking organization Monarch by telling two parallel stories set more than 60 years apart. While Godzilla himself is the most obvious connection between Monarch: Legacy of Monsters and the Monsterverse movies, a Titan referenced in the show&#39;s 1950s timeline could actually turn out to be one of the biggest threats Godzilla will face.




The Monsterverse show revived a forgotten Titan tease from the Monarch website five years ago, which was, at the time, being used to promote Godzilla: King of the Monsters. A Titan map that has since disappeared from the website showed that there was a Titan being monitored in Siberia, only for it to not appear on the current map with locations of Titans being monitored shown in the 2019 sequel. The mysterious Titan being referred to (and subsequently dismissed) again during the lead-up to Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire seems like no coincidence, and the Titan&#39;s location may provide some insight into its identity.

 Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters May Have Made The First Reference To Shimo 
Shimo could be the Titan that Bill Randa thinks is in Siberia.
          

In an effort to organize and legitimize Bill Randa&#39;s field notes, Keiko Miura suggests that they discard any alleged sightings that have no direct evidence, and the first one she dismisses is a Titan supposedly located in Siberia. It&#39;s possible that this is the first mention of Shimo, the new dragon Titan who will make his debut in Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire. Shimo&#39;s name (which translates to &#34;frost&#34;) points to the dragon having ice-based powers, and assuming his size is comparable to Godzilla and Kong&#39;s, he will be a very legitimate threat to the two Alpha Titans.




Shimo&#39;s icy powers make sense for a Titan that dwells in the subarctic cold of Siberia. Far away from most major civilizations, an oft-hibernating ice dragon could easily go unnoticed for many years, as many of the Titans seem to have done for most of human history. Keiko easily convinced Bill not to pursue the Titan further, so any sightings that took place between the Titan being mentioned in the 1950s timeline of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters and the events of Godzilla: King of the Monsters likely never made it into Monarch&#39;s research.



 Where Has Shimo Been Since The 1950s? 
Shimo has likely been dormant, possibly in the Hollow Earth.
          

Many of the Monsterverse&#39;s most massive Titans seem to spend a great deal of time in a dormant state, only reawakening when they are disturbed or called. If the Siberian Titan is in fact Shimo, then he can&#39;t have been very active if he has stayed off Monarch&#39;s radar for decades. It seems likely that Shimo has been dormant since at least the 1950s, perhaps in something similar to the crystalline cocoon that Godzilla appeared in in the Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire trailer.




Given that there have been no major sightings of what is most likely a dragon of a size comparable to Godzilla, it would make sense that Shimo has been in the Hollow Earth the entire time. In fact, given that the new ape foe, Skar King is based in the Hollow Earth, it makes perfect sense that Shimo would be located there as well. It seems likely he will be awoken by the villainous ape Titan.



 Will Shimo Appear in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters? 
It seems unlikely, but not impossible, given how closely the show is tied to the movies.
         

Given how significant a role Shimo is poised to have in Godzilla x Kong: the New Empire, it seems unlikely that he will be officially revealed in a tie-in TV show. It&#39;s very clear, given the budget and effort that has gone into Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, that it is intended to be an extension of the cinematic content of the Monsterverse. However, it likely won&#39;t ever be &#34;required viewing&#34; for those wishing to follow along with the Monsterverse, and therefore, it would be truly shocking for a Titan of Shimo&#39;s status to be revealed.




With that said, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has done an incredible job filling in gaps in the historical narrative of the Monsterverse. It is much more significant than a spin-off or a timeline-adjacent companion show; it is actively expanding the lore of the universe that Legendary Entertainment started on the silver screen. It might make sense for an Easter egg, or even a post-credits scene that further teases Shimo&#39;s presence in the Monsterverse, especially with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to release just a few months after the conclusion of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.
