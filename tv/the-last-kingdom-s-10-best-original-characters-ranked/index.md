## Literature Review
The Last Kingdom depicts several historical figures, but it also has a wealth of original characters, making it worth ranking the 10 best of them.




The Last Kingdom bases many of its characters on real historical figures, but the show also has a wealth of fascinating original characters. Based on Bernard Cornwell&#39;s Saxon Stories novel series, The Last Kingdom follows Alexander Dreymon&#39;s Uhtred of Bebbanburg across medieval England. From season 1 to the end of The Last Kingdom&#39;s movie, dozens of layered and engaging figures join Uhtred as he seeks to recover his stolen birthright, the fortress of Bebbanburg.
The Last Kingdom&#39;s excellent cast makes every character intriguing, and though many of the show&#39;s best, like David Dawson&#39;s Alfred and Millie Brady&#39;s Aethelflaed, are based on real people, the original characters often outshine the historical ones. That may be because the original characters have more flexibility, since they don&#39;t have to follow historical facts. Regardless, there are loads of great original characters in the show, which makes it worth ranking the best 10 of them.
            
 
 The Last Kingdom Season 5 Ending Explained 
The Last Kingdom season 5 finally paid off Uhtred&#39;s arc. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the series finale and how it sets up The Last Kingdom&#39;s sequel film.













 








 10  Eadith — Played By Stefanie Martini 
The Last Kingdom seasons 4-5
        

Lady Eadith (Stefanie Martini) is one of The Last Kingdom&#39;s most likable characters, first appearing in the show&#39;s fourth season before returning to play a major role in season 5. Eadith is compassionate and clever, and she demonstrates her resilience by enduring the abuse of the despicable Lord Aethelred (Toby Regbo) in an effort to help her brother gain influence. Layered and engaging as she is, she&#39;s definitely one of the characters who should have appeared in The Last Kingdom&#39;s movie. Regardless, her brief time on the show is enough to earn her a spot among the best original characters in The Last Kingdom.





 9  Leofric — Played By Adrian Bower 
The Last Kingdom season 1
        

Leofric (Adrian Bower), the man who created Uhtred&#39;s nickname, is one of the most memorable single-season characters in The Last Kingdom. Though he dies during the climactic battle at the end of The Last Kingdom season 1, his brusque demeanor and rugged companionship with Uhtred are irresistible on-screen. He is also an extremely loyal and able soldier, and probably one of the few characters who would have a chance of defeating Uhtred in a duel. With that in mind, Leofric certainly deserves a spot among the best original Last Kingdom characters, but he doesn&#39;t stick around long enough to warrant a higher ranking.





 8  Sihtric — Played By Arnas Fedaravičius 
The Last Kingdom seasons 2-5
        

Sihtric (Arnas Fedaravičius) is one of Uhtred&#39;s most loyal companions, following him from The Last Kingdom season 2 through the rest of the series. He is a capable warrior and an intelligent strategist, helping Uhtred win a variety of battles and skirmishes. He is also the only member of Uhtred&#39;s entourage, excepting Uhtred himself, to have a family. Sihtric&#39;s presence is magnetic and there&#39;s little not to like about the character, but he lacks the depth of some other original characters, preventing him from ranking any higher.





 7  Aldhelm — Played By James Northcote 
The Last Kingdom seasons 2-5
        

James Northcote&#39;s Aldhelm is one of The Last Kingdom&#39;s most intriguing secondary characters. When he is introduced as an advisor to Aethelred he serves as an intelligent antagonist, but he soon betrays his lord to save Aethelflaed, whom he later advises when she becomes Lady of the Mercians. Aldhelm&#39;s transformation from antagonist to protagonist is fascinating to follow, and it forces the audience to wonder if his loyalty to Aethelflaed will be absolute, or if he will betray her as he did his former master. As things transpire, Aldhelm proves to be completely dedicated to Aethelflaed, helping him become one of the show&#39;s best characters.





 6  Gisela — Played By Peri Baumeister 
The Last Kingdom seasons 2-3
        

Gisela (Peri Baumeister), perhaps Uhtred&#39;s best romantic partner, is one of the most lovable characters in The Last Kingdom. She displays nothing but compassion, fierce love, and incredible bravery throughout her time on the show. As a wife to Uhtred, she is dedicated and caring, raising their children with love until her tragic death in childbirth. Gisela&#39;s demise is one of the most heartbreaking deaths in The Last Kingdom, which proves how great of a character she is. Sadly, she was not around long enough to be considered as the show&#39;s best original character.





 5  Hild — Played By Eva Birthistle 
The Last Kingdom seasons 1-5
        

Another fan-favorite from The Last Kingdom is Eva Birthistle&#39;s Hild. Hild becomes something of a sister to Uhtred, especially after helping him recover from the trauma of his enslavement in season 2. Her dogged persistence and unwavering courage are her defining traits, making her one of the most easily likable characters in The Last Kingdom. She is also principled and honest, serving as a positive influence on whomever she encounters. The only thing preventing Hild from ranking higher is that her arc is somewhat flat because she already knows herself so well that she has little room for character development.
            
 
 The Last Kingdom: Every Character Based On Real Life Figures 
The Last Kingdom is full of fascinating characters, and a fair amount of them are based on real historical figures from medieval England and beyond.









 4  Brida — Played By Emily Cox 
The Last Kingdom seasons 1-5


 







Emily Cox&#39;s Brida is easily one of The Last Kingdom&#39;s best overall characters. Fans may not always like her, and she does some terrible things in later seasons of the show, but that&#39;s exactly what makes her a great character. Moving from main protagonist to lovable side character to crazed villain, Brida has perhaps the most dynamic arc in the series. Her story is heartbreakingly sad, but also incredibly captivating, and importantly, it showcases the brutality of the medieval era The Last Kingdom takes place in.





 3  Finan — Played By Mark Rowley 
The Last Kingdom seasons 2-5


 







Finan (Mark Rowley) is easily one of The Last Kingdom&#39;s best original characters, bringing the show an important bit of comic relief and providing Uhtred with a reliable sidekick. Finan is also an outstanding warrior, and his participation in some of the show&#39;s best action sequences helps his case as well. Finan is probably Uhtred&#39;s best friend and closest advisor, and their relationship becomes one of the pillars of the show when he appears in season 2. Of all the fantastic original characters in The Last Kingdom, only two can top Finan.





 2  Father Beocca — Played By Ian Hart 
The Last Kingdom seasons 1-4
        

While a lot of The Last Kingdom&#39;s original characters play important roles in the story, Ian Hart&#39;s Father Beocca is as integral to the core of the narrative as anyone else. In many ways, he becomes a father figure to Uhtred, and without Beocca, Uhtred would likely have been a much darker person. Beocca is the constant voice of reason in Uhtred&#39;s ear, and though they sometimes become exasperated with one another, Uhtred&#39;s palpable grief after Beocca&#39;s death proves how important the priest was to him. The Last Kingdom simply isn&#39;t the same after Beocca&#39;s death, which is why he ranks so high.





 1  Uhtred Of Bebbanburg — Played By Alexander Dreymon 
The Last Kingdom season 1-5


 







The best original character in The Last Kingdom is none other than the main protagonist, Uhtred of Bebbanburg. The whole series revolves around Uhtred, and without Dreymon&#39;s magnetic performance in the lead role, The Last Kingdom could not have been the same. Further, Uhtred grows tremendously across the course of the series, changing from the brash young man he is in season 1 to the cautious and calculated veteran seen in Seven Kings Must Die. The Last Kingdom has a lot of engaging original characters, but without Uhtred gluing the narrative together, the show could never have succeeded.
