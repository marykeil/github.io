## Literature Review

Fans of romantic films and erotic thrillers should enjoy these movies similar to Netflix&#39;s 365 Days, from Fifty Shades to Call Me By Your Name.




Erotic movies like 365 Days usually make a big splash upon release, and the Netflix original joined a long list of films that gained attention because of their steamier content. The Polish romantic drama dropped on the streamer in 2020, and it follows Laura Biel (Anna-Maria Sieklucka), a young woman who is kidnapped by a Sicilian mafioso named Masimo (Michele Morrone) and given a year to fall in love with him. Immediately controversial for its plot, 365 Days gained loads of attention and delivered on its promise of steamy romance — albeit of a more problematic nature.
The film was summarily rejected by critics and even earned an elusive 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However, movies like 365 Days are rarely popular with critics, and it managed to deliver everything that was promised. The first film proved popular enough to spawn several sequels, and every 365 Days movie was a steamy affair with plenty of sensuality, even if the overall quality hadn&#39;t improved. And for those looking for movies with similar steamy love scenes and complicated relationships, there are plenty of movies like 365 Days.
            
 
 365 Days: 10 Things About Netflix&#39;s New Movie That Don&#39;t Make Sense 
Netflix&#39;s 365 Days is seen by some as handling serious issues in a haphazard way and many feel that nothing about this film makes any sense.












 








 15  The Fifty Shades Trilogy (2015, 2017, &amp; 2018) 
Steamy Romance Based On The Novels By E.L. James


 







   
R



  Release Date    February 13, 2015     Director    Sam Taylor-Johnson     Cast    Jennifer Ehle , Dakota Johnson , Jamie Dorman , Marcia Gay Harden , Eloise Mumford , Victor Rasuk , Luke Grimes , Rita Ora     Runtime    125 Minutes    


Though erotic romance movies have been a staple of subversive cinema for decades, the international sensation that was the Fifty Shades trilogy brought it to the mainstream. Based on the novels by E.J. James, the Fifty Shades series concerns Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a literature student who begins a torrid romance with eccentric millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan).
Like 365 Days, the Fifty Shades movies touch on a romantic relationship that isn&#39;t exactly healthy, and the problematic way the series depicted BDSM drew ire, but its overwhelming success proved it was popular enough with audiences looking for the darker side of romance.





 14  Betty Blue (1986) 
A Romantic Thriller That Received An Oscar Nomination
        

Adapted for the screen by auteur director Jean-Jacques Beineix from author Philippe Djian&#39;s novel, Betty Blue flipped the script from the typical erotic romance movies like 365 Days. Betty (Béatrice Dalle) begins a sexual relationship with a handyman (Jean-Hugues Anglade) that is complicated by her increasingly reckless behavior.
A pioneer of the cinéma du look movement of that time period, Beineix&#39;s movies gained a reputation for their emphasis on atmosphere and stylization, with Betty Blue being a prime example. Scoring an Oscar nomination and earning applause for its gripping psychological thriller plot, Betty Blue didn&#39;t skimp on the steamy romance either.





 13  Secretary (2002) 
James Spader &amp; Maggie Gyllenhaal Star In This Romantic Thriller
        

Though Secretary contained elements that are commonplace in many erotic romance movies, it was the film&#39;s brilliant execution that set it apart. An emotionally troubled woman named Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) begins a sadomasochistic relationship with her demanding boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader). Setting the template for later films like Fifty Shades of Grey,
Secretary is similar to movies like 365 Days because of the romance derived from a seemingly dark situation. Still containing plenty of scintillating and steamy scenes, the characters&#39; relationship journey is much more wholesome, humorous, and satisfying than many other famous examples of the genre, and Secretary is ranked among James Spader&#39;s best movies.

 12  The Twilight Saga (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, &amp; 2012) 
A Young Adult Supernatural Romance Series That Made $5.28 Billion


 







   
PG-13



  Release Date    November 21, 2008     Director    Catherine Hardwicke     Cast    Robert Pattinson , Ashley Greene , Peter Facinelli , Rachelle Lefevre , Elizabeth Reaser , Kristen Stewart , Nikki Reed , Jackson Rathbone , Cam Gigandet , Kellan Lutz , Taylor Lautner , Anna Kendrick , Billy Burke     Runtime    121 minutes    


Though the steaminess was somewhat dialed down in The Twilight Saga, the complex romance of the series is very similar to that of 365 Days. Set in a small Pacific Northwest town, the series sees teenage Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) caught in a love triangle between vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner).
Though the films weren&#39;t critical darlings, The Twilight Saga added elements of the supernatural to the romance formula, which made for an intriguing story on its own. The complicated love story is gripping enough to remain interesting throughout, even if the late aughts staple lacked the abundant sexuality of movies like 365 Days.

 11  9 1/2 Weeks (1986) 
Mickey Rourke Stars In This Romantic Thriller
        

 9 1/2 Weeks 

  Release Date    February 14, 1986     Director    Adrian Lyne     Cast    Mickey Rourke , Kim Basinger , Margaret Whitton , David Margulies , Christine Baranski , Karen Young     Runtime    117 Minutes    


One of the most famous erotic movies ever made and among the best movies like 365 Days, 9 1/2 Weeks proved how successful the romance genre could be when taken to steamier places. Art gallery assistant Elizabeth McGraw (Kim Bassinger) begins dating Wall Street broker John Gray, (Mickey Rourke) but is troubled as their relationship goes to sexual extremes without any real emotional connection.
Often remembered as one of Mickey Rourke&#39;s best films, the conventional story of risque boundary-pushing in a torrid affair is packed with the steamy style of director Adrian Lyne. Like 365 Days, the movie features plenty of sexual scenarios but goes deeper by using its erotic backdrop to deconstruct modern romance in the &#39;80s.





 10  Below Her Mouth (2016) 
        

The Canadian film Below Her Mouth is somewhat different from movies like 365 Days because it deals with a torrid affair that is largely healthy. In it, Jasmine (Natalie Krill) is a successful fashion editor who begins an affair with a roofer named Dallas (Erika Linder) that forces them both to reevaluate their lives.
The introduction of an LGBTQ&#43; relationship made Below Her Mouth immediately stand out and the dramatic writing largely overshadowed the erotic elements of the story. While Below Her Mouth’s storyline was fast-moving and abrupt, the movie offered audiences an erotic thrill while also challenging their perceptions.





 9  Lie With Me (2005) 
A Hidden Gem Among The Romantic Thrillers
        

Lie with Me was neither a critically acclaimed movie nor a popular one, but it&#39;s an erotic gem for fans of movies like 365 Days. The story concerns Leila (Lauren Lee Smith) and David (Eric Balfour), a couple who have a deep sexual connection but lack effective communication skills to maintain a real relationship. Eschewing most common romance movie tropes, Lie with Me uses erotic imagery to break down the boundaries of what a healthy relationship is. While 365 Days also uses eroticism abundantly, Lie with Me explores the emotional nature of physical relationships.





 8  After (2019) 
        

   
PG-13



  Release Date    April 11, 2019     Director    Jenny Gage     Cast    Peter Gallagher , Josephine Langford , Khadijha Red Thunder , Pia Mia , Jennifer Beals , Swen Temmel , Meadow Williams , Samuel Larsen , Hero Fiennes Tiffin , Shane Paul McGhie , Inanna Sarkis , Dylan Arnold , Rebecca Lee Robertson , Selma Blair , José Alfredo Fernandez     Runtime    106minutes    


While most viewers seek out movies like 365 Days because they push the boundaries of their R-ratings, After offers a slightly tamer alternative for those looking for steamy romance on screen. The story focuses on the college romance between studious Tessa (Josephine Langford) and rebel student Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).
Offering a much more realistic alternative to 365 Days, After nevertheless provides a scintillating and troubled romance with many of the trappings of an erotic drama, well within the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. The After film series grew out of the success of the first film and has blossomed into a bona fide romantic franchise.





 7  Basic Instinct (1992) 
The Sharon Stone &amp; Michael Douglas Classic


 







   
R



  Release Date    March 20, 1992     Director    Paul Verhoeven     Cast    Michael Douglas , Sharon Stone , George Dzundza , Jeanne Tripplehorn , Wayne Knight , Denis Arndt , Leilani Sarelle , Bruce A. Young     Runtime    128 minutes    


Basic Instinct is the film that catapulted Sharon Stone to superstardom and is considered the pinnacle of the erotic romance genre. Crime novelist and homicide suspect Catherine Tramell (Stone) becomes involved with homicide detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas) who is investigating the murder. Made with director Paul Verhoeven&#39;s signature over-the-top style, Basic Instinct not only had erotic romance but a compelling murder mystery as well.
Like 365 Days, Basic Instinct drew controversy because of its plot elements, and the film has diminished somewhat in the public eye because of its negative depiction of the LGBTQ&#43; community, specifically bisexual women.





 6  Femme Fatale (2002) 
A Romantic Thriller Starring Antonio Banderas &amp; Rebecca Romijn
        

The best erotic romance movies typically add another ingredient on top of their steamier aspects, and Brian De Palma&#39;s Femme Fatale is no exception. Starring Antonio Banderas and Rebecca Romijn, the movie tells the story of Laura Ash (Romijn), a professional thief who betrays members of her crime ring, finding herself entangled in a familial identity switch. Sexuality is at the forefront of the story, but Femme Fatale takes things further with a thrilling main storyline. Movies like 365 Days are defined by their sexual components, but Femme Fatale shines on merits beyond its steamy sex.





 5  Y Tu Mamá También (2001) 
Alfonso Cuaron&#39;s Spanish-Language Masterpiece
        

 Y Tu Mamá También 

  Release Date    June 8, 2001     Director    Alfonso Cuarón     Cast    Maribel Verdú , Gael García Bernal , Diego Luna , Daniel Gimenez Cacho     Runtime    106 Minutes    


Iconic Mexican road movie Y tu mamá también is similar to 365 Days in that steamy romance is the heart of the story, but Alfonso Cuarón&#39;s masterpiece explores deeper themes. Teenagers Tenoch Iturbide and Julio Zapata (Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal) embark on a cross-country road trip with Luisa Cortés (Maribel Verdú), an older woman. The movie is a mix of a road trip and sexual adventure, with a deeper look into teenage rites of passage and the disillusionment that can exist within friendships. Y tu mamá también is considered one of Alfonso Cuaron’s best works.





 4  Nymphomaniac (2013) 
Lars Von Trier&#39;s Arthouse Romantic Thriller
        

One of cinema&#39;s most divisive filmmakers, Lars Von Trier managed to outdo himself with his two-part epic Nymphomaniac in 2013. The film concerns Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac who recounts her wild sexual experiences to the man who took her in after she was savagely beaten. Making movies like 365 Days look tame by comparison, the explicit sexual scenes in Nymphomaniac drew in crowds, but Von Trier&#39;s arthouse style left many baffled. Romance takes a back seat to pure sexuality, and the challenging nature of the story demands deep reflection.





 3  Love (2015) 
An NC-17 Erotic Thriller From Gasper Noe
        

Director Gaspar Noé is celebrated for his visual approach to storytelling, and his hit film Love delivered a distinct erotic romance. Set in Paris, an American man named Murphy (Karl Glusman) has a sexual relationship with Electra (Aomi Muyock) that is challenged when Omi (Klara Kristin) is invited to join them. Famously, the sex scenes in Love were unsimulated, and the movie was even screened in 3D (via NPR).
Like 365 Days, Love has plenty of erotic moments, and is even recognized as one of the best NC-17 films of all time, but it also uses its visual motifs to make broader statements about the connection between sexuality and love.





 2  Blue Is The Warmest Color (2013) 
An LGBTQ&#43; Drama Based On A Comic Book
        

   
NC-17



  Release Date    October 9, 2013     Director    Abdellatif Kechiche     Cast    Lea Seydoux , Adèle Exarchopoulos , Salim Kechiouche , Aurélien Recoing , Catherine Salée , Benjamin Siksou     Runtime    180minutes    


Winner of the Palme d’Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Blue Is the Warmest Color is one of the most critically acclaimed erotic movies of the 21st century. It concerns Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos), an introverted high school girl questioning her sexuality, and her newfound relationship with graduating art student, Emma (Léa Seydoux).
The film is famously known for its sex scenes, which elicited a controversial response upon its release, but it has also been praised for its romantic storytelling. Blue Is the Warmest Color broke many barriers for the erotic genre through its raw and bold look at young love and chronicled healthy sexual exploration, unlike 365 Days.

 1  Call Me By Your Name (2017) 


 







   
R



  Release Date    January 19, 2018     Director    Luca Guadagnino     Cast    Armie Hammer , Timothee Chalamet , Michael Stuhlbarg , Amira Casar , Esther Garrel , Victoire Du Bois     Runtime    2h 10m    


Though movies like 360 Days draw in large crowds for their explicit sexual nature and steamy forbidden romance, Call Me by Your Name made a splash more lovingly. Set in the 1980s, the film concerns young Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and his romance with graduate student Oliver (Armie Hammer) throughout a hot Italian summer. With a closer look at the harsh realities of forbidden love in less progressive and expressive times, the film elicited both a response of joy and sadness towards its romantic plot. Though more subtle than 365 Days, Call Me by Your Name was no less erotic.
    365 Days   Release Date:   2020-02-07    Runtime:   114 minutes    Cast:   Michele Morrone, Anna Maria Sieklucka, Bronislaw Wroclawski, Otar Saralidze, Magdalena Lamparska, Natasza Urbanska    Director:   Barbara Bialowas    Writers:   Barbara Bialowas, Tomasz Klimala, Blanka Lipinska, Tomasz Mandes    Genres:   Documentary, Romance
