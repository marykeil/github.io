## Literature Review

The Iris Messaging scene in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 6 is more important than it first appears —  and not for the reasons viewers expect.





Summary

  Percy Jackson episode 6 introduces Iris Messaging, a method of communication the trio uses to have a revealing conversation.   The Iris-Messaging scene hints at Luke&#39;s betrayal, as he is the one who stole Zeus&#39; Lightning Bolt, and he manipulates the situation to work in his favor.   Luke&#39;s betrayal becomes even more tragic as Percy, Annabeth, and Grover trust him with their quest, which will make things harder when he turns on them.  







Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians introduces the concept of Iris Messaging in episode 6, and this scene is far more revealing than it initially seems. Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show is masterfully recreating the story told in Rick Riordan&#39;s books, and it&#39;s foreshadowing future developments in its early episodes. Percy Jackson episode 6 contains more Easter eggs and references to the source material, and its Iris-Messaging scene alludes to season 1&#39;s looming betrayal.

Iris Messaging in Percy Jackson is a method of long-distance communication, allowing demigods to speak with one another by throwing a drachma through a rainbow. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover reach out to Camp Half-Blood using this strategy, and they have a conversation with Luke. The trio reveal that they believe Clarisse is the Lightning Thief, but this admission is meant to throw viewers off — and the Iris Messaging scene hints at the real twist coming in Percy Jackson season 1.

 Percy Jackson Episode 6&#39;s Iris-Messaging Scene Is Meant To Throw Viewers Off 
Grover&#39;s Suspicions Turn Out To Be Wrong
          

The Iris Messaging scene in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 6 is meant to introduce a red herring, as Clarisse isn&#39;t truly responsible for stealing Zeus&#39; Master Bolt. Although Ares&#39; behavior in episode 5 leads Grover to believe his children are involved, the satyr&#39;s assumption is incorrect. Taking his concerns to Camp Half-Blood may confirm this, but that&#39;s assuming the message gets through to Chiron and Dionysus in the first place. Despite intentionally throwing viewers off, the Iris Messaging scene still teases the actual Lightning Thief.



 Luke&#39;s Response During The Iris-Messaging Scene Teases The Real Lightning Thief 
There&#39;s A Reason Luke Goes Along With The Trio&#39;s Accusation
         




It&#39;s significant that Percy, Annabeth, and Grover speak to Luke during Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 6, as he&#39;ll be the one to betray Percy at the end of season 1. The Oracle tells the show&#39;s lead that he&#39;ll be betrayed by a friend, and Luke has already set this in motion by gifting Percy Hermes&#39; sneakers. Luke&#39;s intention is for the sneakers to drag Percy into Tartarus after he reaches the Underworld. This will free the villain Luke is working for: Kronos. Kronos is the one Percy keeps dreaming about, and he persuades Luke to betray Olympus using his resentment toward his father.

During the Iris-Messaging scene, Luke is all too willing to believe that Clarisse is the Lightning Thief. In fact, he barely questions Percy, Annabeth, and Grover&#39;s accusation. Initially, it seems like this is because Clarisse is a bully. However, it makes more sense upon the realization that Luke is the Lightning Thief, and framing someone else for the deed works in his favor. And it&#39;s possible he won&#39;t even relay the trio&#39;s message to Chiron and the other adults at Camp Half-Blood. Doing so wouldn&#39;t further his plan, which requires Percy and his friends to visit Hades to reclaim the Lightning Bolt.






 Percy Jackson Episode 6 Makes Season 1&#39;s Betrayal Much More Tragic 
Luke&#39;s Dark Turn Will Be Far More Heartbreaking
          

Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 6 makes Luke&#39;s betrayal much more tragic, and it partially does so through the Iris-Messaging scene. The fact that Percy, Annabeth, and Grover so easily trust Luke with information about their quest will make it more difficult for the trio to digest the reality that he&#39;s turned on them. Such a development would hurt less coming from a character they were already suspicious of. However, the possibility of Luke betraying Camp Half-Blood doesn&#39;t seem to cross their minds, meaning this turn of events will pack a powerful and painful punch.

Episode 6 also introduces Luke&#39;s father — Lin-Manuel Miranda&#39;s Hermes — and reveals why the young demigod resents him so much. Percy Jackson hints that something terrible happened to Luke&#39;s mother, suggesting that he blames his Olympian father for her fate. While it&#39;s unclear if Hermes is actually responsible, this backstory makes Luke&#39;s betrayal more understandable, painting him as a more complex and tragic figure.




Hermes&#39; discussion with Percy, during which he reveals how difficult it is for parents to watch their children suffer, also alludes to Luke&#39;s looming character arc. The Percy Jackson books reveal that Hermes can&#39;t interfere with Luke&#39;s destiny, so the Greek god is forced to watch as Luke makes terrible choices — choices that are likely to lead to a tragic end. Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians doesn&#39;t get into this just yet, but Hermes&#39; comments about parenting are already setting it up. Needless to say, Luke&#39;s storyline will prove heartbreaking for just about every character involved.
