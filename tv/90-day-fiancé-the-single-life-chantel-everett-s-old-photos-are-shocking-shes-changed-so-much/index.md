## Literature Review

The Family Chantel alum Chantel Everett is looking very different during her confessional scenes in 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life season 4.




Chantel Everett from 90 Day: The Single Life has physically changed a lot since she joined the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. Chantel and Pedro Jimemo’s messy storyline has been a part of several spin-offs, such as 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? and their standalone series, The Family Chantel. The young couple married in 2016 after Pedro moved to Atlanta, Georgia, from the Dominican Republic. Chantel and Pedro’s married life seemed like a fairytale on paper, but they had fights over money, communication issues, and cultural differences. Their families were also very much involved in the couple’s storyline.




Chantel’s family could never get themselves to believe that Pedro hadn’t married their daughter for a green card. The marriage started falling apart slowly but surely, and Pedro finally filed for divorce in 2022. Chantel knew she now had to move on quickly. Chantel went on to star in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 as she explored the dating pool and flew to Greece to find herself a new man. Chantel has been trying to make changes to the way she approaches dating all over, while viewers have noticed some other striking changes she’s made in her life.

Chantel was 25 years old when she joined 90 Day Fiancé season 4. When she first joined the show, Chantel revealed she was pursuing her Bachelor’s Degree in nursing. She then opened up about meeting Pedro for the first time as she was interested in learning Spanish and had a friend introduce her to Pedro. The idea was for her to learn Spanish and for Pedro to learn English. Chantel was attracted to Pedro “right away” after meeting him. She went to the DR for a vacation to have fun but fell in love with Pedro.



 Chantel&#39;s Glamorous Makeover In The Family Chantel 
          

Chantel looked slightly different during every season after 90 Day Fiancé. She looked drastically different in The Family Chantel season 2 in 2020 when there were rumors of her getting her breast implants. Even Chantel’s co-stars on 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk from June 9, 2020, noticed the change when Stacey Silva exclaimed, “Oh, she looks good!” and her twin Darcey yelled, “Oh, Chantel! Woo! She needs to be in New York Fashion Week!” Meanwhile, Loren Brovarnik commented, “These f****** boobs, they’re like, ridiculous,” gesturing at the TV and added, “She definitely got them done.”




Chantel had denied the rumors at the time, saying her chest was all natural. However, there were also changes in her face that weren’t so subtle. Chantel had begun experimenting with makeup and kept switching her hairstyles from straight hair to bouncy curls. Chantel developed her style and was always dressed to the nines on the show now, especially during her confessionals. She changed the lengths of her hair and opted for makeup that made her eyes pop, and her lips appear fuller.



 Chantel Is Looking Unrecognizable After Getting Divorced 

 

Those following 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Chantel on Instagram are aware of her Peloton workouts and her love for pole dancing. Regular exercise has helped Chantel stay fit and healthy, which is also reflected in her glowing skin and hair. However, Chantel’s face in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 is attracting attention for the wrong reasons, as viewers see her looking awkward and uncomfortable or even in pain as her face appears to be swollen. Chantel recently revealed that she got lip fillers. Still, Chantel’s 2024 look is all about gaining back her confidence as she explores her new life as a single woman.
