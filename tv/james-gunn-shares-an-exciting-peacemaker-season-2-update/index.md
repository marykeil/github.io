## Literature Review
James Gunn is working on Peacemaker season 2 before he starts filming Superman: Legacy, and he has shared an exciting update for fans of the series.




James Gunn has shared an exciting Peacemaker season 2 update. Gunn is currently writing the new season of the DC Universe series. The director has given a more direct Peacemaker season 2 update, revealing where exactly he is in the new season&#39;s writing process. The reveal could mean exciting news for when Peacemaker season 2 could start filming.




On Threads, Gunn revealed that he is nearly done writing Peacemaker season 2, episode 6.

          

John Cena as Peacemaker, Freddie Stroma as Vigilante, and more will reprise their roles as canon characters of the DCU in Peacemaker season 2. After recently having commented about his decision not to reboot the series, Gunn&#39;s latest Peacemaker update shows he might be further along writing the new season of the series than expected, which could impact season 2&#39;s release timeline.

                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.    


 When Peacemaker Season 2 Could Premiere 
Likely After 2025
          




Gunn has been clear from the beginning that Peacemaker season 2 would only go into production once he was done with Superman: Legacy. The DCU movie will begin filming in March, and Gunn will continue working on Superman: Legacy until it premieres on July 11, 2025. Based on that, the earliest Peacemaker season 2 could start filming would be late 2025.

Based on how far along Gunn is with writing Peacemaker season 2, it seems like the DCU series could go into production immediately after the director wraps his work on Superman: Legacy. As was the case for Peacemaker season 1, Gunn is also writing all the episodes for season 2. With all the scripts done well before the likely late 2025 filming start and Gunn free to direct most of Peacemaker season 2&#39;s episodes, the series could be done filming still in 2025.

Peacemaker season 1 was released in January 2022. While the series could finish filming before 2025 is over, Peacemaker season 2 arriving in January 2026 would make for a very tight deadline. As Peacemaker season 1 began shooting in January 2021, a full year before the show premiered, the same should happen with Peacemaker season 2. Based on that, the earliest Peacemaker season 2 could arrive is likely to be late 2026.
