## Literature Review
Black Jack Randall is easily the most evil character in Outlander - and he&#39;s done truly horrifying things to most of the main characters. 






Content Warning: This article contains references to gratuitous violence and sexual assault







From the first to the third season, Outlander&#39;s Jonathan &#34;Black Jack&#34; Randall made his mark as one of TV&#39;s most brutal villains. Known for his sadistic mannerisms and penchant for torture, Randall was responsible for tormenting the Frasers and MacKenzies for years, with the militant leader using his status as Captain to get away with his violent and horrific crimes. Even years after his death, Black Jack Randall managed to have a major impact on all the characters, with many of them still traumatized by what they had witnessed or what they were subjected to.

While the Outlander books certainly showed what a terrible person he was, the series also highlights some of his worst crimes. Things have changed somewhat with Black Jack Randall gone, and while Governor Tryon hasn&#39;t been as brutal as Captain Jack Randall, he&#39;s not so far off as he has, inadvertently, been responsible for the death of the fan-favorite character, Murtagh. There&#39;s still a long way to go, but there&#39;s always a possibility that Tryon might end up committing a few similar to Black Jack Randall if it helps him to get what he wants in the end.  




                  Outlander Timeline Explained   Here is a complete breakdown of the Outlander timeline and its rules about time travel, including everything from seasons 1 through 6.    


 Randall Runs A Corrupt Facility At Wentworth Prison 
Black Jack Randall Tortured Prisoners
          

With Black Jack Randall holding quite a prestigious position in the army, it&#39;s not that surprising that he ends up becoming the garrison commander at Fort William for a while. Unfortunately, this also means the prisoners within the facility are mistreated by the guards and Randall too. Randall encourages the other English soldiers to look the other way when he mistreats and tortures Jamie, and he also doesn&#39;t care how his soldiers treat the other prisoners either. The sadistic Black Jack Randall has likely been responsible for other prisoners&#39; trauma too, and faces no punishment for his crimes.






 Randall Framed Jamie By Killing The Soldier 
Black Jack Randall Betrayed His Own Allies
          

While the murder didn&#39;t take place on-screen, the reason Jamie has been on the run is that Black Jack Randall framed him. Everyone knows that Jamie was wrongly accused of murdering an English soldier, but he wasn&#39;t sure who the culprit was. However, this all changes when Horrocks reveals the person Jamie has been looking for is Black Jack Randall. Not only does it seem the Captain is out to ruin Jamie&#39;s life, but he also shows he is a traitor to his country. The fact that Black Jack Randall will murder his allies proves how low he will go and how he should never be underestimated.



 Dueling With Jamie 
Black Jack Randall Set Up Jamie To Fail
          




It comes as a great shock when Black Jack Randall turns up in France where Jamie and Claire are. He shows great pleasure knowing they were both there and has no qualms about accepting the duels Jamie challenges him to. Considering Randall warns Claire that dueling in France is illegal, it makes this move puzzling. However, it was clear what Black Jack&#39;s intentions were once it was over. He knows Jamie will be killed no matter what the result of the duel is. He knows that he won&#39;t face any of the consequences due to his ranking and connections to the crown. It shows how calculating and devious he can be.



 Randall Burns Jamie&#39;s Pardon 
Black Jack Randall Taunts Jamie In Prison
          

After Jamie fought back against Black Jack, the Captain had an unhealthy obsession with the Scottish Highlander. His obsession with Jamie increases when he manages to evade capture from right under his nose. However, this changes once Jamie is imprisoned in Fort William. It is here that Black Jack Randall takes great pleasure in tormenting Jamie, with his mind games starting when he burns Jamie&#39;s pardon right in front of his face. Jamie would have gotten his life back if the note had reached the right officials. Black Jack Randall was rubbing salt into Jamie&#39;s wounds by cruelly mocking him.






 Attacking Claire When He First Met Her 
Black Jack Randall Was Evil From The Beginning
          

The first time Claire meets Black Jack is in the pilot episode, as she confuses him for her husband Frank. He introduces himself as &#34;the Captain of His Majesty&#39;s Eighth Dragoons&#34; and then begins interrogating her. He then attacks and assaults Claire before Murtagh Fraser shows up and saves her. While he has only been on-screen for a short amount of time, Black Jack Randall&#39;s introduction certainly leaves a bad impression as a deplorable and awful person. Not only is Randall&#39;s behavior and manners disgusting, but the way he carries himself with authority makes him one of the show&#39;s main antagonists from the start.



 Punching A Corpse 
Black Jack Assaults His Brother&#39;s Corpse
          




Season 2&#39;s &#34;The Hail Mary&#34; sees Black Jack Randall marry Mary Hawkins after Claire discovers Mary is pregnant with Black Jack&#39;s brother Alex&#39;s child. Sadly, despite Claire&#39;s best efforts, Alex dies after contracting tuberculosis and discovering he has congestive heart failure. When it is clear Alex is dead, Randall jumps on top of his corpse and begins punching it several times, much to the horror of Claire and Mary. Black Jack Randall claimed to love his brother, so this act is quite horrific and shows he has no respect for Alex. What is worse is that he is relentless in his attack and shows no remorse for his actions.



 The Jenny Incident 
Black Jack Randall Brutalizes Jamie&#39;s Sister
          

In season 1&#39;s &#34;Castle Leoch,&#34; Jamie narrates to Claire how Black Jack Randall led a group of Redcoats to their home to collect horses, food, and valuables. He hears his sister Jenny screaming, then rushes to the house and finds two soldiers trying to assault her. As he fights them off, Black Jack appears and places a gun to his head. Despite Jamie begging Black Jack to leave his sister alone, he strips her and claims she is very attractive. Randall then ties Jamie up and proceeds to whip him as Jenny watches. He then takes Jenny with him, saying she will give him plenty of entertainment. It is one of Black Jack&#39;s most horrific actions.






 Forcing Corporal Hawkins To Kick Claire 
Black Jack&#39;s Soldiers Cover Up His Crimes
         

Just after Black Jack Randall finishes torturing Jamie in the Season 1 episode, &#34;The Garrison Commander,&#34; Randall summons Corporal Hawkins. When Claire mistakenly thinks he is about to leave her alone, he punches her in the stomach. Black Jack then orders a terrified Hawkins to kick her. It becomes quite apparent that Randall enjoys torturing and hurting others. However, not only are the other soldiers under his command frightened of him, but it also appears Claire won&#39;t get any justice, since none of them reports Randall, implying he has likely gotten away with other crimes too.



 Flogging Jamie To Make A Point 
Randall Gave Jamie Over 200 Lashes
          




In &#34;The Garrison Commander,&#34; Black Jack Randall has a conversation with Claire, in which he informs her of how he&#39;d whipped Jamie for trying to escape. He sarcastically tells her he ordered a corporal to give Jamie 100 lashes, but he did not break. Feeling this sets a bad example for future offenders, he grabs the whip and gives Jamie 100 more lashes. In a flashback scene, Jamie&#39;s scarred back can be seen as Randall whips him continuously. Randall doesn&#39;t stop the lashes until there is torn skin hanging from Jamie&#39;s back. He delivers a line only a villain could make: &#34;Jamie and I created a bloody masterpiece. It was the most beautiful thing I&#39;d ever seen.&#34;



 Punishing Claire For Lying 
Black Jack Assaulted Claire More Than Once
          

In the season 1 episode &#34;Both Sides Now,&#34; Black Jack Randall demands to know what Claire knows about the Duke after she claims she is working for him. Randall discovers she is lying after he tricks her into thinking the Duchess is calling the shots, but in reality, the Duke never married. As a result, Black Jack Randall attacks and assaults Claire, holding her at knife-point. He also demands that she reveal information about Dougal, threatening to kill her if she does not. Luckily, Jamie appears and stops the attack before he hurts Claire any further.






 Indirectly Causing The Death Of Jamie&#39;s Father 
Jamie&#39;s Dad Died Watching His Son Being Flogged
         

Jamie and his sister Jenny reunite in &#34;Lallybroch.&#34; There is good news, as she reveals Randall didn&#39;t sexually assault her. However, Jamie reveals a disturbing detail to Claire. While he is held captive at Fort William, his father tries to negotiate for his release. After that fails, and Jamie opts not to give in to Randall&#39;s demands, Black Jack delivers another brutal flogging. Sadly, his father witnesses the torture and falls dead after suffering from a stroke. What makes this all the more heartbreaking is that Jamie and Jenny end up blaming themselves and spend years living with guilt. It cements Randall&#39;s place further as one of the most hateful characters in Outlander.



 Destroying Jamie&#39;s Hand 
Black Jack Tried To Handicap Jamie
          




After he is imprisoned in Wentworth Prison, some of the saddest and most horrific things happen to Jamie as Black Jack Randall tortures him. First, the English Captain damages Jamie’s hand by hitting it with a hammer and nailing it to the table, resulting in Jamie not being able to hold a sword. This is something that deeply affects Jamie because he believes he won&#39;t be able to protect his family or loved ones once war is upon them. Since Jamie is also stubborn and independent, he also doesn&#39;t like the fact Randall might have taken this away from him. It is only because of rigorous training that Jamie learns how to hold a weapon again.



 Sexually Assaulting Jamie 
Black Jack Didn&#39;t Limit His Assaults To Claire
          

The season 1 finale is one of the most brutal and heartbreaking TV episodes of Outlander, as the viewers discover Randall has sexually assaulted Jamie. During the episode, the ordeal is shown in a series of flashbacks, with the writers exploring in great depth how the incident has deeply affected Jamie, physically and mentally. It certainly devastated Jamie, showing how much pain he was in during the assault. This makes the eventual fate that the Captain faces in the future fit his crimes.




                  Outlander Season 8: Cast, Story Details &amp; Everything We Know   With Starz confirming that Outlander season 8 will be the last one, here&#39;s everything you need to know about the cast and story details     



 The Encounter With Young Fergus 
Black Jack Randall Was Responsible For Fergus&#39;s Pain
         

As if he hasn&#39;t committed enough evil acts in Outlander, it is revealed in the season 2 episode &#34;Faith&#34; that Black Jack Randall sexually assaulted Fergus, which is the reason Jamie challenges him to a duel for a second time. While the Fraser family is suffering once again, the revelation that Randall caused the pain Fergus is enduring adds to his villainy. It is also frustrating that Randall doesn&#39;t face any consequences for these actions either, still keeping his title and rank despite his crimes. It seems like it took forever for Black Jack Randall to receive his comeuppance, and even then, it is almost like he got away with too much for too long..
