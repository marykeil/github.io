## Literature Review
Big Brother 25 is coming to an end, and legend Dr. Will Kirby, host of the jury roundtable each year, has a lot to say about the current jury.




Big Brother season 25 may be coming to a close, but things are heating up with the jury of 7 as they decide the winner of the game, and Big Brother 2 winner Dr. Will Kirby shared his take on the annual jury roundtable in a recent interview. While Dr. Will hasn’t played Big Brother since the first installment of Big Brother: All-Stars in 2006, where he took fourth place, he’s been hosting the jury roundtable segments for the last decade on the CBS reality competition series. Will, a Big Brother legend, had an exciting strategy in his game, taking the route of ruthless honesty.




In an interview with The Exclusive With Sharon Tharp (shared by VintageWingnut1 on Twitter), Dr. Will shared his thoughts on the Big Brother 25 jury, explaining that it “was the single best jury I’ve ever been part of” and praising their intelligence. When asked if he thinks any of the jurors could cast a bitter vote after being systematically taken out by Jag Bains and Matt Klotz, Will explained, “There’s a very real chance that some of these people are going to be–they are bitter, so they might vote bitter.”


 

While Dr. Will stayed quiet about who stood where among the jury of 7, he was clear that the houseguests were spirited in their debate about who deserves to win the $750,000 grand prize. He explained that the jury was quite vocal with one another, teasing that filming took hours and got heated at times, but “they are not afraid to disagree, they’re not afraid to be outspoken, and when I challenged them, they responded right back.”





 Dr. Will Kirby Isn&#39;t A Fan Of Unanimous Votes On Big Brother 
          

While Big Brother 25 viewers won’t know how the jury votes fall until the finale, Dr. Will shared his thoughts on the vote, explaining that he isn’t sure how uniform things will go during the vote. “I’m not a fan of unanimous votes; to me, that’s extremely boring,” Will explained (as shared by VintageWingnut1), sharing that while the Big Brother 25 cast had mostly unanimous votes during the season, the jury may be different. “They might’ve all agreed during the individual eviction process that occurred during the [game], but now there’s a strong level of disagreement now that they’ve had some space and some time to think about what they’re doing.”


 




Each year, Dr. Will’s jury roundtable segment allows the jurors to hash out the gameplay of the final three houseguests, sharing their views on who made what moves. Typically, the jurors get somewhat heated, as they’re passionate about the game of Big Brother they were a part of. For the Big Brother 25 cast, the jury consists of some of the strongest players in the game who were taken out by Jag and Matt, whom most felt were allies. As they debate over the pros and cons of each player, Dr. Will facilitates the conversation to the best of his ability.

Big Brother 25 may be coming to an end, but some of the houseguests will continue to share their lives after the season is over, regardless of who the winner is. While some jurors are hopeful to see Jag take the money, others have been rooting for Matt since the beginning. While the jurors seemed solid in their assessment of the game before the roundtable, Dr. Will may have changed their minds during his time with the jury. Big Brother viewers must tune in to the two-hour finale to see the chaotic segment that may be life-changing for one of the final three competitors.




The Big Brother season 25 finale airs Thursday, November 9 at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
