Summary

  Fast and Furious movies have strayed from their original premise of street racing.   Only 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift truly focus on the street racing and car aspects of the franchise, even more so than the first film.   These two films stand out from the rest of the saga, offering unique and stylized car sequences.  





Fast and Furious has abandoned its original premise for a while now, and there are only two films that fully deliver on the franchise’s title. Between nuclear submarines and Dwayne Johnson’s Hobbs changing the trajectory of a missile with his bare hands, it is easy to forget Fast and Furious was once about cars and street racing. However, even though the Fast Saga has indeed changed a lot, there are more examples of Fast and Furious movies that were not about cars than the other way around.




Each new Fast and Furious movie comes with bigger, bolder action sequences, not to mention some absurd plotlines. As a result, it is impossible not to compare the superhero-scale aspect of Fast X and the upcoming Fast and Furious 11 with the simplicity of The Fast and the Furious (2001). Still, in 23 years of Fast Saga movies, most installments ignored the franchise’s original tone.

                  Every Fast And Furious Movie In Chronological Order   Fast and the Furious launched a massive franchise - but the films were not released in chronological order! Here&#39;s how to watch.     


 2 Fast &amp; 2 Furious And Tokyo Drift Are The Only F&amp;F Movies Truly About Street Racing 
         

Fast and Furious’ newest films are often criticized for not having stuck to the franchise’s original premise, but two entries in the Fast Saga are truly about street racing. Even The Fast and the Furious, which is where it all started, did not focus entirely on that aspect. Although Dominic Toretto’s reputation and his first race against Brian were essential parts of the story, the movie’s plot had more do to with the heists Dom’s crew was performing and the investigation Brian was conducting. The same cannot be said about 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift, both of which lived up to the franchise’s name.





 

Although the plot of 2 Fast 2 Furious is not too different from the first film – Brian has to work undercover to expose a criminal – the street racing aspect plays a much bigger part in the sequel. Everything about 2 Fast 2 Furious ties into the cars and the races, and the film has some of the most entertaining car sequences in all of the Fast Saga. Likewise, even though Tokyo Drift has a mafia subplot, the heart of the movie comes down to Sean rising through the ranks of the underground street race circuit to defeat the Drift King.



 2 Fast &amp; 2 Furious And Tokyo Drift Stand Out From Other Fast Saga Movies 
          




2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift may not be the most well-received or financially successful Fast and Furious movies – quite the contrary – but they are some of the most unique entries in the saga. Whereas most Fast and Furious films are about Dominic Toretto’s family and everything that comes with it, the franchise’s first two sequels tried to do things differently. 2 Fast 2 Furious’ stylized car sequences, although a product of their time, brought something that neither The Fast and the Furious nor subsequent films quite matched. Additionally, the buddy cop dynamic between Brian and Roman is something other movies have failed to recapture.


 

Tokyo Drift’s car sequences also stand out from the rest of the saga but for different reasons from the ones in 2 Fast 2 Furious. There are more practical effects and stunts in Tokyo Drift as opposed to 2 Fast 2 Furious’ CG cars, an exciting approach that would impact the franchise for years to come. It is no coincidence that Justin Lin, who directed Tokyo Drift, would go on to helm some of the best Fast and Furious movies, including Fast Five. Neither 2 Fast 2 Furious nor Tokyo Drift are perfect films, but compared to the recent installments, they at least feel original.
