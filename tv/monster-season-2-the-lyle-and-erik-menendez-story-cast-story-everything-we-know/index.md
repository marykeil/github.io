## Literature Review
Netflix is following up Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story with Monster season 2 - but it will focus on new killers, changing a lot from season 1.




After Evan Peter&#39;s depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer captured the cultural zeitgeist in 2022, Ryan Murphy&#39;s Monster season 2 and 3 are on the way. Monster chronicled the life and crimes of notorious American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, and through Ryan Murphy&#39;s signature style, attempted to find the man behind the titular monster. Though plenty of media has covered the high-profile case, the Netflix series was the first to approach the story from a truly cinematic angle.




Although Netflix&#39;s Monster has been mired in controversy, its immense popularity has led the streamer to carry it forward with a double renewal. Monster took a much more in-depth look at the serial killer&#39;s murders, chronicling many of them in real-time. The serial killer subject of season 1 was wrapped up by the final episode, and season 2 of Monster will focus on an entirely different chapter of American true crime history -- the Menedez brothers murder.


 The Latest Monster Season 2 News 
          

The most attention-worthy Monster season 2 news comes in the form of the show&#39;s first bit of casting. After the announcement that the new season of the anthology series would focus on Erik and Lyle Menendez, Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander Chavez have joined Monster season 2 to play the notorious brothers. Koch (Power Book II: Ghost) will play Erik while Chavez (General Hospital) will play Lyle. Season two offers yet another star-making opportunity for the relative newcomers.






 Monster Season 2 Production Status 
          

The Monster season 2 teaser released by Netflix reveals that the Lyle and Erik Menendez story should hit the screens sometime in 2024. Monster season 1 was released on September 21st, 2022, and it&#39;s likely that season 2 could follow this same release schedule, with Ryan Murphy&#39;s other shows like American Horror Story favoring fall releases nearing Halloween.



It is unclear how the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strikes affected Monster season 2.






 Monster Season 2 Cast 
          




The Monster season 2 cast is beginning to come into place with Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander Chavez set to play Lyle and Erik Menendez. Though no other cast announcements have been made so far, the real story of the Menedez brothers was filled with supporting and major figures, and it opens the door for interesting casting opportunities. Since Koch and Chavez are newcomers to Ryan Murphy&#39;s stable, it&#39;s possible the Murphy regulars won&#39;t appear in the season.



 Monster Season 2 Story Details - Erik and Lyle Menendez Murders Explained 
          

On August 20th, 1989, wealthy corporate executive José Menendez and his wife Kitty were murdered by their sons Erik and Lyle in the den of their Beverly Hills home. José was shot six times, while Kitty was shot ten. Lyle called the police, claiming that he and his brother were out and came home to find their parents murdered. Erik confessed the murder to his therapist, Jerome Oziel, and since the police were already building a case against Lyle and Erik Menendez, Lyle was arrested on March 8th, 1990 and Erik turned himself in three days later.




The two trials of Lyle and Erik Menendez will assuredly be a focal point of Monster season 2, as they were widely publicized. While the brothers hired Robert Shapiro first, defense attorney Leslie Abramson will be the main event. Her case hinged on the Menendez brothers&#39; allegations that they killed their parents due to life-long emotional, physical, and sexual abuse at the hands of their father José, while their mother Kitty was physically abusive. The prosecution argued that the murders were perpetrated for financial gain. The brothers claimed they threatened to out their parents, and out of fear that their parents would kill them first, they shot them.

The first trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez ended in a hung jury, due to their tearful testimonies of sexual abuse at the ages of 6 and 8, as well as compelling evidence regarding José&#39;s character from defense witnesses. For whatever reason, Abramson wasn&#39;t able to persuade the second jury it was a crime of self-defense. Therefore, Monster season 2 will see the second trial&#39;s results being first-degree murder charges for the Menendez brothers, resulting in a conviction of life without parole for both brothers.
