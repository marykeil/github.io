# Cobra Kai Season 6 s New Villain Means Chozen Absolutely Has To Return


## SUMMARY 



  Chozen&#39;s future in Cobra Kai season 6 is uncertain, but new casting details hint that he may play a more relevant role than ever before.   Kim Sun-Yung, Terry Silver&#39;s martial arts master, has a connection to Sato, Chozen&#39;s uncle, and tensions between the two may define Chozen&#39;s role in the upcoming season.   Chozen&#39;s personal link to the show&#39;s villains and his previous involvement in protecting the LaRusso family give him strong reasons to stay in the Valley and potentially engage in conflicts with both Kreese and Kim Sun-Yung&#39;s successors.

## Literature Review

Details regarding one of the villains in Cobra Kai season 6 makes it all the more important that Chozen return for the show&#39;s final chapter.




Though Chozen&#39;s status in Cobra Kai season 6 remains unconfirmed, new casting details make it imperative that he come back. After Cobra Kai season 3 successfully reinvented The Karate Kid Part II villain, season 5 further endeared him to the fanbase, making him one of the show&#39;s most popular characters. But in spite of what he brought to season 5, there&#39;s no assurance as of yet that Chozen will stay on as a main character.




After all, it shouldn&#39;t be forgotten that Chozen is a resident of Okinawa and not someone who was ever supposed to stay in the Valley for the long term. He came to the Valley specifically to help Daniel LaRusso beat Terry Silver. That goal has been accomplished, meaning Chozen is free to move on with his life. So storywise, there was a sense that Cobra Kai no longer needed Chozen. But judging by what the show has planned for Cobra Kai season 6, that won&#39;t be the case at all. In fact, it looks like Chozen may be more relevant to the story than ever.


 A Cobra Kai Season 6 Character Has A Massive Chozen Connection 
          

C.S. Lee has been cast as Kim Sun-Yung, a major figure in the world of Cobra Kai and The Karate Kid. As Terry Silver explained in the third movie, Kim Sun-Yung was his martial arts master. A practitioner of Tang Soo Do, Kim created the specific form of karate used by Silver and Kreese. He is also the grandfather of Cobra Kai&#39;s Kim Dae-Eun, the martial arts sensei who partnered with Silver to strengthen Cobra Kai. Another character connection he shares in the show is to Sato, Chozen&#39;s uncle and karate instructor. As explained by Chozen in the Cobra Kai season 5 premiere, Sato and Kim Sun-Yung have a tense history.




Chozen told Daniel that Sato had &#34;much anger&#34; toward Kim. Kim developed a reputation during the Korean War and trained American soldiers during this time. Exactly what it was that Kim did during these years that upset Sato wasn&#39;t known to Chozen, but with Kim being a part of Cobra Kai&#39;s season 6 story, there&#39;s a good chance the series is about to elaborate on that. Presumably, it&#39;ll do that through flashbacks since C.S. Lee is 52 years old, which is far too young to play someone who trained Silver and Kreese. Not only that, but the flashbacks may be the only way Kim can appear; he may be too old to still be alive in the 2010s.



 Sato&#39;s Feud With Kim Sun-Yung Can Explain Chozen&#39;s Season 6 Role 
          

Whatever issue Sato had with Kim Sun-Yung could be what defines Chozen&#39;s role in Cobra Kai season 6. While Chozen did say very little about Sato&#39;s history with Kim, there was enough to infer a martial arts rivalry between the two. Sato and Kim turning out be enemies would make Chozen a natural foe of Kim&#39;s granddaughter and her family, whether it be from Chozen&#39;s perspective or hers. If Kim reciprocated Sato&#39;s hatred, Chozen could represent the latter&#39;s legacy and in turn pose a threat to Kim Dae-Eun&#39;s plans for the future of the Cobra Kai dojo. Either way, he holds a personal link to the characters expected to serve as Cobra Kai season 6&#39;s villains.




Heading in this direction makes sense, considering that Cobra Kai must have mentioned Sato&#39;s problem with Kim Sun-Yung for a reason. Not explaining it was likely purposeful, as it set up a storyline for season 6 to explore. Possibly through an explanation from Kim Dae-Eun, Chozen can learn more about the villain&#39;s history with his uncle. Whatever he uncovers could lend him extra motivation to beat Kim and whoever she has on her side. Following this course would grant Chozen a fitting place in the narrative of the show&#39;s final chapter.



 Cobra Kai Has Two Reasons To Keep Chozen In The Valley 
          

It&#39;s worth noting that Kim Sun-Yung isn&#39;t the only reason Cobra Kai has to keep Chozen onboard. There&#39;s also the matter of Kreese, who should be considered a danger to the LaRusso family. As someone with a tendency to hold grudges and a recently escaped prison convict, Kreese is certainly someone Daniel should be worried about. And with Chozen acting as a bodyguard to the LaRussos in season 5, it would be almost out-of-character for him to walk away with there being any uncertainty regarding their safety.




As long as Kreese is free and bent on revenge, Chozen has an excellent reason to stick around. His prolonged presence in the Valley could last long enough for him to get entangled in the story Cobra Kai seems to be setting up with Kim Sun-Yung and the people carrying on his legacy. Depending on how things play out, Chozen could wind up in fights with both Kreese and Kim Sun-Yung&#39;s successors.
