## Literature Review
Angela Deem continues to be one of the most controversial 90 Day FiancÃ© franchise cast members, largely due to her constant posting on Instagram.




Angela Deem is one of the most controversial 90 Day FiancÃ© cast members, mainly due to her constant posting on Instagram. While there are many posts, some egregious commentary from the franchise star is worse than others. Angela&#39;s relationship with Michael Ilesanmi made 90 Day FiancÃ© one of the best reality TV shows, but sometimes, she&#39;s too much and needs to be reined in. Despite the controversy, Angela is considered a 90 Day FiancÃ© fan favorite.




Angela debuted on 90 Day FiancÃ©: Before the 90 Days season 2. She was introduced as a 52-year-old nursing assistant who started an online relationship with a significantly younger Nigerian man, Michael. The age difference and cultural contrasts became significant elements of their storyline. Despite their constant ups and downs, the pair tied the knot in 2020 and are back together as of early 2023. Amidst cheating scandals and numerous attempts at separation and reconciliation, Angela couldn&#39;t help but post controversial photos on Instagram. What were some of the worst in 2023?


 Angela Teased Her Relationship With Michael 

 

             90 Day Fiance   Release Date   January 12, 2014    Main Genre   Reality    Network   TLC       




After months of uncertainty due to Michael&#39;s cheating scandal and Angela&#39;s constant issues, the reality TV star seemed to drop that she and Michael were back together in May 2023. Simply captioning, &#34;Thank you both...Love yall&#34; on a reel featuring multiple photos of the controversial franchise couple. Fans in the comments were immediately confused and shocked saying, &#34;Waaaait is he HERE NOW???&#34; and &#34;Michael is here oh boy Good luck Michael,&#34; followed by a crying laughing emoji.

However, the post was misleading. Angela reposted a young couple&#39;s attempts at recreating hers and Michael&#39;s photos, not confirming he was in the United States. Despite causing a stir online, the images were initially posted in 2022, the last time Angela visited Michael in Nigeria. It was especially controversial because it wasn&#39;t clear whether they were together again.



 Angela Sent Kisses To Her Doctor 

 




In October 2023, Angela shocked her fans once again by posting a reel of her surgeon, Dr. Michael Obeng, seemingly blowing a kiss at the 90 Day FiancÃ© star. As the reality TV sensation is known to put ample filters on her photos, she added an emoji in her likeness, blowing a kiss at Dr. Obeng and a regular kissing emoji. The video was captioned, &#34;THANK YOU @DR.MICHAELOBENG FOR SAVING MY LIFE FOR THAT I WILL ALWAY BE GRATEFUL AND ALWAYS LOVE YOU #QUEENOFME,&#34; and caused an uproar in the comments.

The pushback from this post caused immediate backlash, prompting Dr. Obeng to delete his Instagram, with one fan noting, &#34;Click on his name. He shut down his whole account tho! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. It even says no internet connection!&#34; There was very little support for Angela in the comments, with users saying, &#34;I hope Michael goes to an attractive doctor too. And I hope they have a really good relationship like you have with your doctor,&#34; and, &#34;THIS is why she doesn&#39;t allow Michael to have an IG..Because she wanna be able to flirt in peace. But if this was michael she&#39;s be hitting him with stuff &amp; abusing him.&#34; Fans also noted that he was the surgeon who did her breast reduction, but someone else performed her weight loss surgery, which is arguably much more life-saving.






 Angela Posted A Disrespectful Homage To Tina Turner 

 

When musical icon and legend Tina Turner passed away at 83, Angela made Tina&#39;s death about her. The 90 Day FiancÃ© star posted a reel of herself transforming into Tina, an action which was arguably both disrespectful to a recently deceased artist and racist. Angela has a history of racism on 90 Day FiancÃ©, both toward her husband and in general commentary on social media. Therefore, her selfish tribute wasn&#39;t well-received.

Angela captioned the reel, &#34;R.I.P QUEEN_OF_ROCK_AND_ROLL,&#34; seemingly a nod to her propensity toward labeling herself as a queen in many of her posts. Fans were shocked at her callousness in the comments, saying, &#34;What is wrong with Angela. No Respect for the deceased. Pls Angela go rest yourself,&#34; and, &#34;A brand new level of uncouthnessâ€¦.blackface is beyond




shameful.&#34; Followers also pointed out that Tina was a noted survivor of domestic violence, and Angela&#39;s behavior toward Michael has often crossed the line into domestic abuse, further adding to the controversy.

Despite her growing fan base, Angela remains a controversial figure on Instagram. Though there have been numerous attempts to remove her from the 90 Day FiancÃ© franchise, she&#39;s a cockroach who continues to escape public ire. While suggesting she&#39;s learned her lesson would be tempting, shocking and controversial posts from Angela Deem will likely continue in 2024.



90 Day FiancÃ© season 10 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.
