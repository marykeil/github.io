  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Tom Wambsgans&rsquo; path to CEO of Waystar Royco was subtly foreshadowed throughout Succession.
The series finale hinted early on that none of the Roy siblings would have a happy ending.
Tom&rsquo;s actions, from trying to impress Logan to stepping up during crises, positioned him as the ultimate winner.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Tom Wambsgans was the winner of Succession, and there were several scenes throughout the show’s four seasons that foreshadowed his ultimate victory.</p>
<p>Tom Wambsgans won Succession’s “Game of Thrones,” and while that may have come as a surprise, there were several scenes throughout the show that indicated he would become the next CEO. The Succession series finale was predictable in the sense that it was clear none of the Roy siblings would get a happy ending based on everything that happened during the show. Assuming Kendall, Shiv, and Roman would not win, there were not a lot of options left for who Succession would crown as the winner of it all.
A lot changed across Succession’s four seasons, especially in the final one. With Logan Roy out of the picture, the search for the next CEO was now part of a larger storyline involving the GoJo deal. Kendall and Roman did get to run Waystar Royco in the aftermath of Logan’s death, but Tom was the one sitting in the chair at the end of the show. Between throwaway jokes and dramatic scenes, there were multiple indications that Tom was going to be the successor.</p>
<p>10 When Tom Was Worried Whether Logan Would Like His Birthday Gift
Tom Wambsgans has been trying to please Logan since the pilot</p>
<p>Tom Wambsgans’ very first scene in Succession makes it clear that he wanted to impress Logan Roy in every possible way. While it can be argued that Tom simply wanted to impress his girlfriend’s father, Succession’s characters often have several reasons behind their actions. Of course, Tom wanted to impress Logan because of his relationship with Shiv, but he also wanted to make sure to stand out among the members and friends of the Roy family. Logan couldn’t care less about the watch he was given, but Tom was at least trying.</p>
<p>9 When Tom Handled The Cruises’ Documents By Himself
Tom “eats sh*t&quot; silent for the Roys in season 1</p>
<p>Tom was “cursed” with the secret documents that exposed years of irregularities committed by Waystar Royco’s cruises division, which he was now running. Although Tom quickly “infected” Greg with the virus, he made sure not to expose Logan to this knowledge. Tom did try to tell Kendall about it, yet the latter simply thanked the former for “eating sh*t” in the name of the company. Tom could have panicked and brought everyone into the mess, yet he tried to fix it by himself. Both Kendall and Logan valued what Tom did once it all became public.
Tom became one of Logan Roy’s most valuable allies when handling the cruises’ situation.</p>
<p>8 When Tom &amp; Shiv Discussed Their Plans For Him To Become CEO
The original agreement was for Tom to get the top job</p>
<p>Considering how much Succession’s power scale changed throughout the show, it is easy to forget that Tom and Shiv’s original agreement was for him to try to become CEO. Shiv was not working at Waystar at the beginning of the show and instead wanted to follow a career in politics, whereas Tom wanted to position himself as a worthy successor to Logan Roy. Their plan lost its purpose once Shiv was offered the top job and abandoned her career in politics, yet it shows that Tom had pretensions of becoming CEO of Waystar Royco since the start.</p>
<p>7 When Tom Was Given ATN To Run
Tom was given Waystar Royco’s biggest asset</p>
<p>Succession&rsquo;s Roy siblings spent most of the show fighting amongst themselves to see who would succeed Logan Roy, yet they were rarely actually working. Kendall, Roman, and Shiv were more worried about the power struggle than taking care of the company, not to mention how they were often not the most trustworthy businesspeople. Logan himself pointed out that the kids were “not serious people.” Tom, on the other hand, spent most of the show running ATN, arguably Waystar Royco’s biggest and most challenging asset. Tom was even the one to call the elections&rsquo; results on behalf of ATN.</p>
<p>6 When Tom Ate Logan’s Chicken
Tom’s power move actually worked</p>
<p>Most of Succession season 2 was about the Roys trying to damage control the cruises’ situation. It didn’t take long for Logan to realize that someone would have be to “sacrificed” for the company to survive, and it would have to be someone important. This is when Tom began to perceive that he was not as big within the company as he wanted to, be and that Logan could not care less about him at that point. Tom’s ridiculous power move of eating Logan’s chicken surprisingly worked, and it symbolized that Wambsgans had his eyes on the prize the whole time.</p>
<p>5 When Tom Offered Himself To Go To Prison
Tom was ready to sacrifice himself for Logan</p>
<p>Building up from the infamous chicken scene, Tom eventually positioned himself as the one to take the blame for the crisis. It seemed that at least one person from Logan Roy’s inner circle would have to go to jail if the company was to survive what was about to happen, and Tom was determined to be that person. From not telling Logan about the documents so that the decisions could not be traced back to him to offering himself to go to jail, Tom became one of Logan Roy’s most valuable allies when handling the cruises’ situation.</p>
<p>Succession: 12 Of The Strangest Things Tom Wambsgans Ever Said<br>
On HBO&rsquo;s Succession, Tom Wambsgans is a weird guy, to say the least. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s not so much what he says but how he says it.</p>
<p>4 When Tom Exposed The Siblings’ Plan To Take Over Logan
Tom was no longer Shiv’s partner by that point</p>
<p>Although their marriage was quite complicated, to say the least, Tom and Shiv were business partners first and foremost. They would make plans together and share information about the different corners of Waystar, always making sure they would both be at the top at the end of it all. However, this changed at the end of Succession season 3, during which Tom betrayed Shiv by revealing the siblings’ plans to Logan. The scene in which Shiv realized Tom was the one to warn Logan as he reached for her shoulder confirmed their relationship would never be the same again.</p>
<p>3 When Tom Was Working Rather Than Attending Logan’s Funeral
Lukas Matsson noticed that Tom wasn’t there</p>
<p>Following Logan Roy’s death in Succession, Lukas Matsson was now the target of those who were seeking power. Although Tom was not necessarily trying to impress Matsson at that point, he accidentally did so by not attending Logan’s funeral. Matsson noticed that Tom was skipping the funeral to continue working at ATN ahead of the elections, which showed how serious Wambsgans was about his job. A member of the Roy family not attending Logan Roy’s funeral seemed absurd, yet Tom was willing to do it for the sake of the company.

<p>2 When Shiv Described Tom To Lukas Matsson
Shiv was vouching for Tom without even noticing it</p>
<p>Shiv believed Lukas Matsson was going to be chosen as CEO once the GoJo deal was finished. However, not only was Matsson no longer interested in giving Shiv the top job, but he was also starting to think about Tom for the position. By trying to roast Tom in front of Matsson, Shiv ended up making the best sales pitch in favor of her husband. Shiv all but said that Tom would do whatever Matsson asked him to and would never have an opinion of his own, which is exactly what the GoJo owner was looking for.</p>
<p>1 When Lukas Matsson Had Dinner With Tom
Tom was now playing for the winning team</p>
<p>The last and biggest indicator that Tom was going to win at the end of Succession came in the finale when he and Matsson went out for dinner. Lukas confirmed everything Shiv told him about Tom and concluded that there was no better option to become CEO of Waystar once the deal was completed. Although Lukas Matsson had yet to buy Waystar at that point, Tom was now playing for the winning side while the siblings were fighting amongst themselves.
