## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Sam Wilson opens up about his appearance on Instagram after reading critical comments from viewers mocking him.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Sam Wilson has something to say to all the viewers curious about his “baby face.” Sam is a reality TV star from Cameron, Missouri, who is getting married to Citra from Bogor in West Java. Sam and Citra met on a dating app, even though the Indonesian woman was looking for friends. Citra was curious about how Sam looked so young for a 26-year-old and decided to message him. There has been a lot of online curiosity over the secret behind Sam’s youthful look during 90 Day Fiancé season 10. There has been unfortunate speculation that it has something to do with his past drug addiction.




Sam, who is now 30 years old, decided to end the rumors via an Instagram update.


 

There have been some comments on the Internet about Sam missing his lower teeth or having bone loss in his face due to his opiate addiction. However, Sam decided not to indulge the critics on his Instagram page when he posted a selfie wearing a black and white striped tee and gave a smoldering look to the camera. “I look the way I look,” Sam wrote while adding a shrugging man emoji.

“Hey Sam there’s nothing wrong with the way you look, people just want to be haters on this show,” a supporter told Sam in the comments section. Someone else told Sam to stay strong and not listen to “miserable” critics who try to bring others down. One of his followers told Sam that they love his story with Citra and are proud of how far he has come. Sam has spoken in detail about his heartbreaking past on 90 Day Fiance. Sam got addicted to pain medicine when he was just 15 years old. He became a cold and numb person who wasn’t able to maintain healthy relationships.

He often fell sick and, as a result, could not keep a job. Sam became clean when he was 22 years old, and although he managed to quit his opiate addiction for over a decade, he did relapse a few times. Sam was able to take up a job as a dockworker at Amazon. He worked two shifts back to back because it took too much time for him to drive back home and come back. Moreover, Sam got into trouble before Citra could come to the U.S. He was taking a prescription drug called Suboxone but was arrested during a work trip when he was caught with the drug and didn’t have the prescription for it.

Sam was put into a diversion program so he could correct his behavior to avoid a criminal record. However, Sam missed his deadline to complete the diversion program and is now facing jail time. Sam didn’t tell Citra about his arrest or possibly getting jailed in the future. He has more things to worry about, since Citra’s dad, Herman, who’s accompanying her to America, is a police officer. Sam’s secret could put his 90 Day Fiancé relationship in trouble, so the criticism he is getting about his face is perhaps the last thing on his mind.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
