## Literature Review
Din Djarin&#39;s strict helmet rule in The Mandalorian keeps his face hidden, but there are still 13 Star Wars characters who have seen him thus far.




Despite the strict helmet rule established early on in The Mandalorian, there are still 13 Star Wars characters who have seen the real face of Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin. The Creed of Din&#39;s tribe came as a surprise to viewers during the premiere of The Mandalorian season 1, as the Mandalorians of the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars series and more had always been able to remove their helmets at their leisure. This has helped to create even more new Mandalorian lore, but it has also helped to make the moments when Pascal&#39;s face is shown as Din in The Mandalorian even more significant.
As of the end of The Mandalorian season 3, Din has only shown his face a grand total of three times in the series, all of which take place under tense or emotional circumstances. The first is in the burning cantina on Nevarro in The Mandalorian season 1 finale, when IG-11 removes Din&#39;s helmet to save his life. The second and third times occur in back-to-back episodes of The Mandalorian season 2, with Din breaking his Creed to save Grogu and then allowing the child to see his face before giving him away to the Jedi. Din, however, hasn&#39;t always been alone in these moments, and thus there are 13 characters who have seen him without his helmet.
            
 
 The Mandalorian Cast &amp; Characters Guide 
The Mandalorian has created a long list of new Star Wars characters and brought back some familiar ones, with an incredible cast to match.













 








 13  Din Djarin&#39;s Parents 
Season 1, Episode 1 &#34;Chapter 1: The Mandalorian&#34;
        

Quite obviously, the first characters to ever see Din&#39;s face are his parents. Only seen in flashbacks throughout The Mandalorian season 1, Din&#39;s parents sacrificed themselves on Aq Vetina so that Din could live. They no doubt had the honor of seeing Din&#39;s face for the longest amount of time in his life, as it would be only a few months or years later that Din would swear the Creed and keep his face hidden from the galaxy.





 12  Din Djarin&#39;s Mentor &amp; His Mandalorian Rescuers 
Season 1, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 8: Redemption&#34;
        

All the Mandalorians involved with Din&#39;s rescue on Aq Vetina, most notably his savior and presumed mentor, also get to see Din&#39;s face upon taking him back to Concordia. The Mandalorian season 3 makes it clear that only children who can swear the Creed willingly are given a helmet, which means Din&#39;s mentor and fellow Mandalorians likely saw his face for quite a while before Din participated in this ritual. The exact timeline is unknown, but they were the last to truly see him before the events of The Mandalorian.





 11  IG-11 
Season 1, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 8: Redemption&#34;
        

Though he&#39;s not a living thing, as he tells Din to convince the warrior to remove his helmet, IG-11 is the only character who witnesses Din&#39;s first face reveal in The Mandalorian. The deed is done out of necessity to save Din&#39;s life, poetically making Din&#39;s savior a droid after he was nearly killed by droids as a child. Din&#39;s fear is palpable in this moment, and his willingness to kill IG-11 and die rather than break his Creed shows how much it truly means to him.





 10  Valin Hess 
Season 2, Episode 7 &#34;Chapter 15: The Believer&#34;
        

Tragically, the first living person to see Din&#39;s face is the Imperial commanding officer Valin Hess on Morak, thus officially breaking Din&#39;s Creed. He approaches Din just after the Mandalorian retrieves the coordinates to Moff Gideon&#39;s light cruiser, beginning an intimidating interrogation that makes the moment even more stressful for Din. Thankfully, another character comes to his rescue, becoming the second person to see Din without his helmet in The Mandalorian.





 9  Migs Mayfeld 
Season 2, Episode 7 &#34;Chapter 15: The Believer&#34;


 







Migs Mayfeld is the one who tries his best to save Din from his uncomfortable situation, even jokingly attributing the nickname &#34;Brown Eyes&#34; to him. In a surprising type of redemption arc, Mayfeld instantly assures Din after Hess&#39; death that he&#39;ll forget he ever saw Din&#39;s face, promising to forget Din&#39;s shattered Creed - a surprising change of heart for the man who previously would have done anything to have the upper hand over Din. Mayfeld instead proves himself to be more honorable than expected, from the way he takes charge when Din is helmet-less to the honest words he shares afterward.





 8  Imperials On Morak 
Season 2, Episode 7 &#34;Chapter 15: The Believer&#34;
        

The Imperial mess hall on Morak isn&#39;t empty when Din removes his helmet, and Mayfeld killing Hess at the table certainly earns the pair many eyes. Thus, every Imperial trooper present in the mess hall has also seen Din&#39;s face, even if they do meet their fates at the hands of Din and Mayfeld immediately after. This makes Mayfeld the only living person to have ever seen Din&#39;s face - until Din risks breaking his Creed one more time.
            
 
 15 Best Din Djarin Quotes In The Mandalorian 
Between hilariously-delivered dry humor to some of Star Wars&#39; most articulate lines, here are Din Djarin&#39;s 15 best quotes in The Mandalorian thus far.









 7  Grogu 
Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;


 







In one of the most beautiful moments of both The Mandalorian and Star Wars to date, Din willingly breaks his Creed once again and removes his helmet to show Grogu his face. This makes their goodbye even more emotional, with Din&#39;s expression offering the little one strength and encouragement until his sadness reigns supreme in the tearfulness of his brown gaze. Grogu is just as elated to see his father as the audience is, and hopefully, this isn&#39;t the last time Grogu gets to see his father&#39;s face.





 6  Luke Skywalker 
Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;
        

Similarly to Morak, Din isn&#39;t alone when he removes his helmet. The bridge on Moff Gideon&#39;s light cruiser is full, and standing directly across from him is none other than Luke Skywalker himself. The Jedi waits patiently for their moment to pass before he walks away with Grogu, offering the traditional farewell of &#34;May the Force be with you&#34; to the Mandalorian&#39;s devastated face as he does so.





 5  R2-D2 
Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;
        

Luke&#39;s trusty companion also has a chance to face Din directly, as it&#39;s his presence that truly convinces Grogu to leave with the Jedi. R2-D2&#39;s focus is much more on the child in this moment than it is on Din, but in a way that&#39;s unique to anyone else who&#39;s seen him thus far, R2 only really knows Din without his helmet. Of course, the two get to meet again afterward in The Book of Boba Fett, introducing R2 to Din&#39;s more common helmeted appearance.





 4  Cara Dune 

Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;
        

As one of Din&#39;s closest companions in The Mandalorian, it&#39;s almost a surprise that Cara Dune doesn&#39;t see Din&#39;s face earlier somehow. The former Rebel Shock Trooper is easily the most sympathetic towards Din in this moment, especially as she witnesses his goodbye with the child he&#39;s come to care for. Unless Din turns around after this, however, Cara really only gets to see the back of his head, which is the case for the rest of the following characters on this list.





 3  Fennec Shand 
Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;
        

One of the more shocking characters who&#39;s also present for Din&#39;s most recent helmet-less moment is Fennec Shand, formerly an enemy of his. The master assassin is simply working on behalf of Boba Fett in holding up their end of the deal they made with Din to protect Grogu when this all takes place, but it no doubt brings the pair a bit closer together. This is shown in their amicable reunion at Peli&#39;s hangar in The Book of Boba Fett, where Din eagerly agrees to help Boba and Fennec against the Pykes at no extra cost.





 2  Koska Reeves 
Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;
        

Serving as Bo-Katan Kryze&#39;s right-hand throughout The Mandalorian season 2, Koska Reeves is also present for Din&#39;s and Grogu&#39;s goodbye. The Mandalorian is rather judgmental of Din&#39;s adherence to the Way of the Mand&#39;alor, and this is something that doesn&#39;t get resolved until The Mandalorian season 3. Still, it&#39;s likely this moment at least affects her opinion of Din somewhat, as she is quickly accepting of him when it comes time to reclaim Mandalore.





 1  Bo-Katan Kryze 
Season 2, Episode 8 &#34;Chapter 16: The Rescue&#34;


 







With such a large group standing behind Din on Moff Gideon&#39;s bridge, it can be easy to forget that Bo-Katan Kryze herself has witnessed Din without his helmet on one occasion. This makes their friendship in The Mandalorian season 3 even more significant, as it proves to Bo-Katan just how honorable Din is about sticking to his word and doing what&#39;s difficult for those he cares about. She&#39;s the last person to have seen Din&#39;s face thus far, but with The Mandalorian season 4 on the way, it&#39;s possible the helmet may come off again.
