  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Zodiac Signs of The Sister Wives Cast explains their behavior on the show and why their relationship might have always been destined to end.</p>
<p>The Sister Wives cast embodied their zodiac signs, explaining some of their behavioral traits on the show. The inaugural season of Sister Wives introduced fans to the polygamous family of Kody Brown and his wives Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, and Robyn Brown. However in Sister Wives season 18, Kody found himself in a monogamous marriage after three of his wives left.</p>
<p>In a marriage involving four people, personality traits sometimes determine just how successful the family will be. However, Kody married his wives without considering how their personality traits might work collectively. Nonetheless, examining Kody, Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn&rsquo;s zodiac signs provides an insight into their behaviors on the show and why their marriages turned out the way they did.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Meri Brown<br>
Zodiac Sign - Capricorn</p>
<p>Meri Brown was born on January 16, making her zodiac sign Capricorn, ruled by the planet Saturn. Due to their connection to Saturn, Capricorn women are known for their dedication, focus, and commitment, which Meri embraced throughout her marriage to Kody. Despite Kody neglecting Meri and her kids, Meri stayed dedicated and committed to the marriage. Even when two of the wives left, Meri stayed, and she remained the woman who was married to Kody the longest. Capricorn women are also known as powerhouse leaders who act as the backbone of their family, providing stability and structure.</p>
<p>As Kody&rsquo;s first wife, Meri laid the foundation for the other wives to follow. She served as the backbone of the Brown family for as long as she could, allowing the other wives and their children to thrive. In terms of noteworthy weaknesses, Capricorn women are known for their stubbornness, pessimism, and pride. Despite the obvious writing on the wall, Meri&rsquo;s stubbornness to accept defeat in her marriage kept her in the relationship longer than necessary. Meri&rsquo;s sense of pride also kept her from seeking help from the other wives and asking for their feedback when their relationship with Kody started suffering.</p>
<p>Kody Brown
Zodiac Sign - Capricorn</p>
<p>Kody Brown was born on January 17, which makes his Zodiac sign a Capricorn, just like Meri. Capricorn men are generally hardworking, very mature, and determined to achieve success in their lives, (via Astroyogi). Despite the money Kody makes as a reality TV star, he is also involved in several businesses, all to provide for his family. Despite his many faults, Kody always tries his best to provide for his family. Capricorn men value loyalty in relationships, so it was hard for Kody to forgive Meri after her online cheating scandal.</p>
<p>Capricorn men also love being in control, and it was evident to see Kody&rsquo;s frustrations when some of his wives and kids weren&rsquo;t sticking to his COVID-19 lockdown rules, which ultimately led to many relationship breakdowns within the Brown family. Capricorn men also have strong sexual stamina, and some of Kody&rsquo;s ex-wives have, on certain occasions, lauded him for his bedroom skills. Meanwhile, Capricorn men often get emotionally detached, which Christine, Janelle, and Meri complained about. A Capricorn man&rsquo;s thirst for control often makes them domineering and dismissive of other people&rsquo;s opinions.</p>
<p>Janelle Brown
Zodiac Sign - Taurus</p>
<p>Janelle Brown was born on May 6, making her zodiac sign Taurus, ruled by planet Venus, the goddess of love and beauty. Taurus women are known for being graceful, independent, and blessed with moral and emotional courage, traits Janelle embodied throughout her marriage to Kody. Janelle&rsquo;s independent nature made her fan&rsquo;s favorite wife, branching out from the other wives to earn her Nevada real estate license and try to help Kody provide for the family when he was struggling. Janelle is always graceful in her dealings with the other wives, and her emotional and moral courage shines in the way she readily speaks her truth and voices her opinions.</p>
<p>Taurus women are also known for their loyalty, and Janelle was highly loyal to Kody until their separation. Even after their split, Janelle left the door open for a reconciliation if Kody was willing to change. A Taurus woman&rsquo;s artistic and sensual traits are shown in Janelle&rsquo;s love of concerts and her openness about how much she enjoyed sex with Kody. Taurus women are also known for being good mothers, and Janelle will stop at nothing to care for her kids. One of the significant reasons Janelle even left Kody was his neglect of their kids. Janelle embodies what it truly means to be a Taurus woman.</p>
<p>Christine Brown
Zodiac Sign - Aries</p>
<p>Christine Brown was born on April 18, which makes her zodiac sign Aries, ruled by the planet Mars. Aries&rsquo; women are known for being vibrant, their unapologetic assertiveness, and their warrior spirit, per Yahoo! Due to her assertiveness, Christine never hesitates to express her opinions, once calling Kody a failure after their divorce. She also became the first wife to leave the marriage, which earned her a lot of plaudits from fans. A perfect display of Christine&rsquo;s warrior spirit occurred in Sister Wives season 3, episode 7, during the family&rsquo;s camping trip when she drove the family&rsquo;s car through a swamp to get to the campsite.</p>
<p>Although Aries women are also known for their resilience, Christine showed this trait by staying in the marriage for as long as she did, hoping Kody would one day notice her efforts to make the relationship work. Christine also embodies Aries&rsquo; women&rsquo;s generosity and loyal traits, which makes her always ready to help and be supportive. Besides sharing a poem as a show of support for Janelle after her divorce from Kody was announced, Christine has supported Janelle in other ways since the separation.</p>
<p>Robyn Brown<br>
Zodiac Sign - Libra</p>
<p>Robyn Brown was born on October 9, making her Zodiac sign Libra, ruled by Venus. According to Love To Know, Libra women enjoy the luxuries of life and are gifted with charm, tact, and flirtatiousness, traits Robyn used to win Kody&rsquo;s heart and separate him from his other wives. Libra women are also known to be dreamers who often dream and fantasize broadly, the same way Robyn wants a polygamous family without being willing to put in the work and sacrifices needed to keep families together.</p>
<p>One of the less impressive traits of Libra women is their knack for avoiding accountability and admitting to their mistakes. Robyn was directly responsible for the breakdown of Kody&rsquo;s marriages to Meri, Janelle, and Christine, as she never advocated for Kody to pay attention to the other wives and their kids. Still, she has refused to acknowledge how her actions led to the broken state of the Brown family. Libra women can also be vain and selfish, the same way Robyn enjoyed all the benefits of being Kody&rsquo;s wife on Sister Wives, including taking Meri&rsquo;s &ldquo;legal wife&rdquo; title without contributing much like the other wives.</p>
<p>Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>

<pre><code>           Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family's life over a decade later.
