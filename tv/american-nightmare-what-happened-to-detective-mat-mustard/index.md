## Literature Review

American Nightmare offers many updates at the end of the series but leaves out what happened to Detective Mat Mustard after the Denise Huskins case.




Netflix’s American Nightmare tells a terrifying tale of police misconduct, but what happened to the lead detective, Mat Mustard, after the events of the series? The three-part docuseries American Nightmare tells the tragic story of a woman named Denise Huskins who experienced a stranger-than-life kidnapping that the Vallejo Police Department deemed a Gone Girl hoax. Rather than properly investigating the crime, they first jumped to the conclusion that her boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, killed her and fabricated the kidnapping story.




After receiving proof that Huskins was alive, they shifted gears, accusing her of pretending to disappear like Amy Dunne in Gone Girl. By getting tunnel vision and not properly investigating, the police traumatized Huskins and Quinn. The end of this series provides many answers, like what happened to Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn after American Nightmare. It also addresses what happened to kidnapper Matthew Muller, albeit leaving out some details about the sentencing. However, the ending fails to explain what happened to the lead detective, Mat Mustard, after the Denise Huskins case.

                  American Nightmare: What Happened To Denise Huskins&#39; Kidnapper, Matthew Muller   The kidnapping of Denise Huskins is now being covered in a new Netflix documentary, but what happened with her kidnapper, Matthew Muller?   


 Mat Mustard Received A Promotion Within The Vallejo PD After The Denise Huskins Case 
          




As mentioned in American Nightmare, former Police Chief Andrew Bidou named Mat Mustard Officer of the Year for 2015 – the same year as Denise Huskins’ kidnapping. This seemingly indicates that the Vallejo PD defended the way Mustard handled the case. When it comes to the department having his back, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Even though Huskins and Quinn settled their lawsuit with Mat Mustard and the Vallejo PD in 2018, being awarded $2.5 million, there’s no public record of Mustard being reprimanded for his defamatory statements about the victims and his botched investigation.

In quite the opposite move, the department promoted Mustard to the role of Detective Sergeant of the Vallejo Police Department in 2018. Captain John Whitney, a whistleblower and Mustard’s former coworker, alleges that – after failing his exam in 2017 – Detective Mat Mustard lobbied former Police Chief Andrew Bidou to change the written sergeant’s exam to lower the standards so that he could get the promotion he wanted (via Vallejo Sun). If true, this shows that the Vallejo PD was not only negligent in Mustard’s poor police work but allegedly encouraged it, giving him more power than he deserved.
