## Literature Review
Selling Sunset season 6 was explosive, and another season just dropped. Here&#39;s everything we know about Selling Sunset season 7.




Though season 6 may have just ended in May, the buzz around Selling Sunset season 7 has risen to a fever pitch. As one of the 20 best reality TV series, the Selling Sunset cast had to find a new center of balance with the hole left by original cast member Christine Quinn. Luckily, the Selling Sunset crew did their best to ensure the drama was in high gear throughout the season. With Chrishell Stause in a new relationship, Mary Fitzgerald at her professional breaking point, and newcomers Bre Tiesi and Nicole Young looking to make a name for themselves on the series, things were never dull during Selling Sunset season 6.




At the very end of the final episode of the season, a supercut of clips from Selling Sunset season 7 was shown to give viewers an idea of what to expect from the upcoming season. With some intense moments, the preview was a drama-filled montage of the agents from The Oppenheim Group, clearly defining the new social structure of the office. Heather Rae El Moussa is heavily pregnant and likely won&#39;t appear as frequently, while Amanza Smith, who revealed she might be amid a health crisis during the end of Selling Sunset season 6, seems to have more of a presence in the trailer.

The reunion will air on Wednesday, November 15, at 9 p.m. ET and 6 p.m. PT on Netflix.

Though Selling Sunset is currently only renewed through its next season, it feels like a given that the Netflix hit may be around for years to come.
