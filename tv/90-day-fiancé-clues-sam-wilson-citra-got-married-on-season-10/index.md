## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé couple Sam Wilson and Citra are facing a unique dilemma on season 10. There&#39;s a chance Citra might have to go back to Indonesia.




90 Day Fiancé couple Sam Wilson and Citra’s future in season 10 has been revealed thanks to several clues posted online. Sam, from Missouri, and Citra, from Bogor, West Java, met on an app while Citra was there looking for friends. Citra was curious after looking at Sam’s photos because he looked much younger than a 26-year-old. Citra started talking to Sam about his “baby face” and the two started as friends with no attraction to each other. However, things started to slowly change and around a year later, Citra and Sam were officially boyfriend and girlfriend.




Once they’d completed a year of dating, Sam told Citra that he had been addicted to opiates since he was 15 years old. Sam became clean at 22, but he had relapsed a few times after that. Citra accepted Sam for who he was. Sam decided he wanted to get married to the Indonesian woman. Sam went to meet Citra in person, two years after they’d started exchanging messages. They got engaged and Citra came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. However, their love story wasn’t an easy one. Sam and Citra have faced several challenges since they started filming.

While Sam had come clean about his past drug addiction to Citra, he had yet to tell her about the possibility of him going to jail. Sam told Citra he was caught with suboxone without a prescription while on a work trip. Sam was using the medication to treat his opiate addiction since he was 22. The judge offered Sam a way to avoid jail time, but Sam missed the deadline to submit his paperwork. Citra understood Sam’s dilemma but worried that once her dad found out he would take her back to Indonesia.

Meanwhile, Sam had to abstain from having sex with Citra until they became a married couple. Sam also had to convert to Islam before he could marry Citra. Upon becoming a Muslim, Sam would have to give up things such as alcohol and pork. “Alcohol, sex, drinking, drugs, used to be a big part of me,” Sam admitted. He said he was going to try to stay on the wagon after he converted. Sam seemed to get along well with Citra’s family after they came to America, but Sam has yet to tell Herman about his possible jail time.






 Sam &amp; Citra Are Posting Romantic Social Media Updates 

 

A preview of the next episode of 90 Day Fiancé shows Sam finally telling Herman about his secret. Herman tells the cameras, “I will bring Citra back to Indonesia” if Sam loses in court and goes to jail. Fortunately for the couple, Sam and Citra’s social media pages confirm the couple is still together. Sam has been posting about their day-to-day updates. Sam has shared videos of him shopping with Citra on Instagram. They post mirror selfies together while Citra’s newest Reel shows her dancing with Sam and declaring, “Having a man with the same vibes as you is a different level of happiness.”



 Citra&#39;s Sister Has Shared Wedding Photos 
          




The reason for Citra still being in America is that she’s married to Sam. In December 2023, Starcasm posted a report confirming Sam and Citra’s union near his hometown of Cameron, Missouri on September 10, 2023. The wedding took place at the Far West Farm House and Citra’s sister shared photos on her Instagram. Interestingly, Citra’s sister Nafa is now engaged to Sam’s brother Timmy. The couple met for the first time in person when Nafa came to America to attend the 90 Day Fiancé couple’s wedding.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
