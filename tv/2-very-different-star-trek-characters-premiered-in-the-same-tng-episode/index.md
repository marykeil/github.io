# 2 Very Different Star Trek Characters Premiered In The Same TNG Episode


## SUMMARY 


Dr. Pulaski&#39;s debut in TNG season 2 was problematic, as she came across as rude and unlikeable, failing to capture the charm of Dr. McCoy from the original series.   

Pulaski&#39;s treatment of Lt. Commander Data as a mere piece of technology rather than a person was a stark contrast to the dynamic between McCoy and Spock, where their verbal sparring conveyed underlying care for each other.   

On the other hand, Guinan&#39;s mysterious character in her TNG debut brought intrigue and valuable advice to Ensign Wesley Crusher, setting the stage for her gradual revelation as one of Captain Picard&#39;s oldest friends.

## Literature Review
Two very different characters both made their Star Trek debut in the season 2 premiere of Star Trek: The Next Generation.




Star Trek: The Next Generation introduced two very different characters in its season 2 premiere. Following the adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the USS Enterprise-D, TNG got off to a rocky start in its first season. As the second season began, the 1988 WGA Strike caused more problems for the already strained writer&#39;s room. Despite this, TNG season 2 would improve upon the previous season and set the tone for TNG moving forward. Although TNG didn&#39;t truly begin firing on all cylinders until season 3, season 2 produced some outstanding episodes of sci-fi television and introduced some fascinating new characters to the franchise.




In Star Trek: The Next Generation season 2, episode 1, &#34;The Child,&#34; Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) is impregnated by a mysterious alien entity. The new Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) wastes no time in jumping to Troi&#39;s aid, bringing the captain and senior staff up to date on the situation. &#34;The Child&#34; is Pulaski&#39;s debut episode, and while she appears to be an accomplished doctor, she also comes across as a bit rude and unlikable. In contrast, Ten Forward bartender Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) also makes her Star Trek debut here, with significantly more success.

Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast &amp; Character Guide   Star Trek: The Next Generation has one of the most beloved cast of characters in all of science fiction. Here are the major characters of the classic.    


 Diana Muldaur&#39;s Dr. Pulaski Was A Problem From Her TNG Debut 
Dr. Pulaski appeared in all but 2 episodes of TNG&#39;s second season.
          




Before portraying Dr. Pulaski, Diana Muldaur had appeared in two episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series (season 2&#39;s &#34;Return to Tomorrow&#34; &amp; Season 3&#39;s &#34;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&#34;). And while she is undoubtedly a talented actress, the character of Dr. Pulaski feels out of place among the TNG crew. Pulaski is inspired by TOS&#39; Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), whose cantankerous nature usually came across as the charm of an old country doctor. Pulaski fails on this score, as she comes across as rude to both Captain Picard and the android Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). It seems TNG was trying to make Data the Spock (Leonard Nimoy) to Pulaski&#39;s McCoy, but it simply doesn&#39;t work.



Dr. Pulaski&#39;s debut wasn&#39;t helped by the fact that she was so different from the previous CMO, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). McFadden had been fired after the conclusion of TNG season 1, but she would return for seasons 3 through 7.




McCoy&#39;s verbal sparring with Spock worked because Spock, unlike Data, never failed to give it right back to McCoy. When Pulaski first meets Data, she mispronounces his name twice, failing to see why it matters, immediately treating Data as less human than his counterparts. When Data offers to help Troi as she&#39;s giving birth, Pulaski replies that Troi needs &#34;the comfort of a human touch, not the cold hand of technology.&#34; With Spock and McCoy, it was always apparent the two cared about one another despite their sparring, but Pulaksi does not even know Data and still treats him more like a piece of technology than a person.



 Whoopi Goldberg&#39;s Guinan Is Delightfully Mysterious In Her TNG Debut 
Guinan appeared in 19 episodes of TNG, as well as Star Trek Generations and Star Trek: Nemesis.
   

In addition to rounding out the USS Enterprise-D crew, Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s season 2 premiere also expanded the footprint of the Galaxy Class starshship. &#34;The Child&#34; introduced Ten Forward, the bar/lounge where crew members could go to unwind. The introduction of Ten Forward created a space where the characters could have more personal discussions that didn&#39;t necessarily pertain to the big sci-fi mystery of the week. With Ten Forward also came the mysterious bartender, Guinan, played by Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg had been a fan of Star Trek: The Original Series and Whoopi actively pursued a role on TNG, which led to the creation of Guinan.



Guinan will eventually be revealed to be an El-Aurian, a race of listeners who live extremely long lives. Although Guinan tells Wesley that she only recently met Picard, she&#39;s later revealed to be one of his oldest friends.



In her first appearance, Guinan offers advice to Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton), as he struggles to decide whether to join his mother at Starfleet Medical or remain on the Enterprise. Guinan tells him that it is okay to be selfish sometimes, as she can see that the young ensign wants to remain on board. Later, Wesley questions Guinan about her past, saying that people on board are &#34;very curious&#34; about her. The mystery of Guinan is revealed slowly throughout Star Trek: The Next Generation and beyond, but she&#39;s an intriguing character from the very start.



Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
