# What The Conners Season 6s Tyler Return Means For Roseannes Spinoff


## SUMMARY 



  Tyler&#39;s return in The Conners season 6 gives Becky the opportunity to take center stage and finally have a major role in the show.   The presence of Tyler also indicates that the upcoming season will focus on new couples and give a break to the relationships of characters like Darlene and Ben or Dan and Louise.   Tying together Becky&#39;s story and giving her a happy ending in season 6 would be a fitting conclusion for the show, providing a better sense of closure for Roseanne and Dan&#39;s children.

## Literature Review
The news that Sean Astin&#39;s Tyler will return in The Conners season 6 proves that Roseanne&#39;s spinoff will highlight one long underrated character.




While Tyler’s comeback in The Conners season 6 is good news for Becky, this twist also bodes well for the rest of the Roseanne spinoff’s unresolved stories. The Conners season 6 is likely to be the show&#39;s final outing. Both executive producer Bruce Helford and star John Goodman have hinted at this possibility in interviews, and the Roseanne spinoff surviving for six seasons after the death of its former title character is already a monumental achievement. The Conners began life as a revival of the popular ‘90s sitcom Roseanne in 2017 but, when Roseanne Barr’s racist tweets got her fired, her character was killed off and the show was retooled in 2018.




Since The Conners season 6 looks like it will be the final outing of the series, there are many lingering plots for the show to wrap up. After Mark spent years saving, scamming, and studying to get into college, the spinoff must decide whether all this effort was worth the wait. Since Harris’ engagement to Aldo ended in disaster and she found herself back home with Darlene, season 6 now needs to give her a new sense of purpose. However, no character requires more story focus than Lecy Goranson’s Becky. Luckily, Sean Astin’s comeback as Tyler bodes well for numerous storylines, especially Becky’s uneven character arc.



The Conners season 6 premieres on February 7, 2024 on ABC.

Even though she has been a lead character in the series since Roseanne’s original run, Becky hasn’t had a major role in The Conners in some time. She did have a season 4 subplot where she secretly dated her professor, but this went nowhere. Luckily, season 6 can fix this, and The Conners doesn’t even need to bring back major Roseanne characters to pull this off. In season 5, episode 20, “What&#39;s So Funny About Peas, Love and Understanding?,” Becky met Sean Astin’s charming cargo plane pilot Tyler at a bar. The pair hit it off, but Tyler was subsequently never seen again before season 5&#39;s finale.


 

Although Becky had earlier promising love interests who went nowhere, such as the same season’s Steve, the fact that Tyler was played by a notably famous guest star boded well. Indeed, the first trailer for The Conners season 6 confirms that Tyler will return in the upcoming outing, with Astin’s character joining the Conner clan for a game of poker in the promo. Tyler even claims that he will take Dan’s son Becky and his money in the trailer, hinting at the possibility of Becky and Tyler getting engaged or married before the spinoff ends. This could be an ideal ending for Becky’s troubled, inconsistent story.

While The Conners failed to prioritize Becky and Harris in season 5, the presence of Tyler in the spinoff’s trailer bodes well for these supporting stars. Ben and Darlene’s unhappy marriage got a lot of screen time in season 5, meaning there was little focus left for Becky. Meanwhile, Dan and Louise’s struggles dominated The Conners season 4, so the fact that Tyler is back may bode well for season 6 centering a new couple instead of rehashing the same relationship struggles between these pairings. Meanwhile, Harris could use Becky moving out of Darlene’s home as an opportunity to strike out on her own, thus wrapping up her story.

The Roseanne spinoff’s heroes have always struggled with poverty, unemployment, and their dysfunctional personal relationships. However, Dan, Darlene, and Jackie still ended up in loving supportive relationships, so things could look up for the brood if Becky is happy by season 6&#39;s ending. It seems increasingly unlikely that The Conners season 6 will address Roseanne’s missing son Jerry Garcia Conner, and there was no sign of Michael Fishman’s DJ making a return in the season 6 trailer. As such, this final outing could lean into Becky’s story without sacrificing anyone else’s plot. Harris and Mark also need screen time, but they are not as central as Roseanne’s own children.

It took a long time for Darlene and Jackie to find happiness, and Dan’s unexpected loss of Roseanne reshaped his story. However, now that all of these characters are in happy, stable relationships and DJ is largely absent from the series, Becky is overdue some narrative focus from the spinoff. For two seasons, she has been a major supporting character in The Conners without receiving a meaningful character arc of her own. Her last impactful storyline was her struggle with addiction, and Becky never received credit for how much she overcame in that plot. As such, the Roseanne alumni is overdue happiness in The Conners season 6.
