## Literature Review
Sister Wives Christine Brown has always been honest about her life, especially when it comes to the Brown family and her interactions with Meri.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown shared how much she&#39;s talked to her ex-sister wife Meri Brown since her split from Kody Brown during Sister Wives season 17, and the answer is shocking for fans. While Sister Wives season 18 focused on Meri and Janelle Brown&#39;s relationships with Kody amidst his anger after splitting up with Christine, the series didn&#39;t take much time to focus on how Christine&#39;s relationships with Meri or Robyn Brown had faired through the divorce. Meri, who married Kody in 1990 after just a few months of courting, was the first wife in the Brown family, followed by Janelle and then Christine for the first few decades.




In a recent interview with People, Christine shared that her relationship with Meri has been virtually non-existent since her split from Kody. &#34;I haven&#39;t really spoken with Robyn or Meri very much,&#34; Christine shared. &#34;I spoke with Meri one time, I think, since I&#39;ve separated from Kody.&#34; She shared that though they&#39;ve spoken at a few family functions, it&#39;s all been short and cordial. &#34;I thought it would be different, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be different than that,&#34; Christine explained, &#34;It&#39;s going to stay separate and I don&#39;t need to be close to either of them, really.&#34;

 Meri Brown Isn’t “Closing Any Doors” To Christine &amp; Janelle Reconciliation 
          




While Christine and Janelle revealed they don&#39;t feel the need to reconcile their relationships with Meri, Kody&#39;s original wife shared that her outlook is different. &#34;It&#39;s going to take all parties involved, you know what I mean?&#34; Meri shared, making it clear she wouldn&#39;t be making the effort alone. &#34;But I&#39;m not closing any doors.&#34; Janelle and Christine may not be interested in having a relationship with Meri in the future, but Meri explained that if they all choose to keep in contact, she wouldn&#39;t be opposed to having her ex-sister wives in her life. After Sister Wives season 18, they may be able to find solace in each other.


 

With Meri, Janelle, and Christine all moving forward from their relationships with Kody, their time within the Brown family seems to have come to a close, at least in the way the family once was. While Robyn and Kody are still hopeful that their family structure will include his ex-sister wives and their children in the future, it seems unlikely that they&#39;ll come to a point where they keep in the same sort of contact that they did in the past. For Christine and Janelle, starting over with new lives and new love, including Christine&#39;s husband David Woolley, has meant leaving the difficulties of their shared past behind.




Though Sister Wives season 18 is over, the issues between the estranged Brown family are only just starting to get explored. As Christine and Janelle move into the next phase of their lives together, Meri hasn&#39;t been able to keep a hold on the family she once had. Though she still seems to have relationships with Robyn, and to an extent, Kody, things are incredibly different for her in her newfound independent life. Though they have a long shared history, the women of Sister Wives have all chosen to move forward separately.
