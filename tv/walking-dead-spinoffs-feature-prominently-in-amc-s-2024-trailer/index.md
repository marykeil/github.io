## Literature Review
AMC releases a trailer for its 2024 slate, and a handful of The Walking Dead spinoff shows, including The Ones Who Live, feature prominently.




The Walking Dead&#39;s spinoff show stake center stage in a new AMC 2024 slate trailer. After 11 popular seasons, the hit AMC zombie drama came to an end in October 2022, bringing to a close a journey that first started in 2010. The larger universe timeline of The Walking Dead lives on, however, with spinoffs focusing on a variety of different characters now either having aired debut seasons or gearing up for their premieres this year.




Now, the AMC Plus Instagram account has shared a new trailer for 2024, with The Walking Dead spinoffs featuring very prominently. Check out the new trailer below:


 

The trailer features looks at The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, Daryl Dixon season 2, and The Book of Carol, and, though none of the footage appears to be new, it does tease just how prominent the zombie franchise will be this year. Other shows featured in the trailer include Monsieur Spade, Parish, Orphan Black: Echoes, and Interview with a Vampire.


 2024 Could Be A Big Year For The Walking Dead 
          

For a time, The Walking Dead was one of the most popular shows on television. Although it remained popular up until its series finale, there&#39;s no question that viewership waned slightly and general interest took a bit of a hit in later seasons as more and more original characters departed. So far, the franchise has had mixed success with its spinoffs, and 2024 could be the year that signals just how much longevity the Walking Dead universe has.




While The Walking Dead: Dead City was met with somewhat lukewarm reviews and Fear the Walking Dead faltered toward the end of its run, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon&#39;s reviews were mostly glowing. Critics praised the latest spinoff for its freshness, with the Norman Reedus-starring show transporting the franchise to Europe with a mostly new cast. Though The Walking Dead: Dead City season 2 won&#39;t be airing in 2024, Daryl Dixon season 2 will, and it seems poised to continue the same quality of season 1.

  

The Book of Carol, which is itself a spinoff of Daryl Dixon, also looks promising, with Melissa McBride&#39;s Carol having been one of The Walking Dead&#39;s most beloved characters. Most excitingly, however, is The Ones Who Live, which will see the return of Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes and Danai Gurira as Michonne, two powerhouse characters from the original show. Rick&#39;s return, especially, could mark a return to form for the franchise, with the character serving as the original show&#39;s anchor for much of its run.






The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live is scheduled to premiere on February 25, 2024, while Daryl Dixon season 2 and The Book of Carol are currently expected to release later in the year.
