## Literature Review
House of the Dragon&#39;s intense season 1 led to audiences deeply hating certain characters. For the likes of Aegon or Larys, it&#39;s going to get worse.




Warning: Contains SPOILERS for Fire &amp; Blood, the book on which House of the Dragon is based.Very few shows have characters as divisive as those on House of the Dragon, and season 2 will likely generate even more hatred toward certain characters. Based on George R.R Martin&#39;s Fire &amp; Blood, the Game of Thrones prequel explores a pivotal era for the historic Targaryen dynasty, where a civil war erupts between the heirs of King Viserys. Season 1 saw a divide build between factions led by Rhaenyra Targaryen, the king&#39;s eldest child, and Aegon Targaryen, the king&#39;s eldest son, represented as the black and green parties. In season 2, Westeros will erupt into war.
While Game of Thrones covered characters worldwide, House of the Dragon is primarily contained under the roof of the Red Keep, adding an interpersonal intensity to the main rivalries. House of the Dragon&#39;s cast of characters is connected through blood, romance, and broken friendships. The series generally favors Rhaenyra and the blacks, but viewers are left with complex moral choices when deciding who they support. Any series that allows for such personal engagement is bound to be filled with characters people hate, and as war ensues and stakes escalate, the hatred will only grow.









 








 10  Rhaenyra Targaryen 
Rhaenyra will be vengeful after the loss of her son.


 







Rhaenyra&#39;s expression at the end of House of the Dragon season 1 says it all. After losing her son Lucerys to her younger brother Aemond, the Queen will be back for vengeance, and anyone who sees the greens as the morally righteous party will grow to hate her even more. Though she&#39;s not directly involved with the Blood &amp; Cheese assassination, she doesn&#39;t reprimand Daemon for his cruel actions. She also will appoint Mysaria a position as mistress of whisperers later on, so it&#39;s likely that the series won&#39;t show much guilt from her over the brutal baby murder.
            
 
 9 Biggest Battles &amp; Events Teased In House Of The Dragon Season 2â€™s Trailer (&amp; What Happens In The Books) 
The House of the Dragon season 2 teaser trailer hinted at some major events from the book. Here&#39;s everything that happened and what it means.









 9  Alicent Hightower 
Alicent will grow more cruel as the war ensues.
        

Comparisons were made early in House of the Dragon that suggest Alicent might end up being a similar character to Cersei Lannister. In reality, Alicent ended up being far more reasonable and sympathetic than anyone anticipated. While she does try to stab Rhaenyra, she&#39;s at least more apprehensive about starting a war and seems to care less about who sits on the throne than her father. The events of season 2 will likely drive her toward cruelty, especially after Blood and Cheese.
            
 
 House Of The Dragon Season 2 Is Fixing A Huge Season 1 Targaryen Complaint With Devastating New Twist 
The first teaser for House of the Dragon season 2 highlights one dragon moment that reveals a Targaryen complaint from season 1 will be addressed.









 8  Aemond Targaryen 
Aemond will continue to be a powerful asset to the greens.
        

At the end of season 1, Aemond Targaryen became an exciting character, creating an intriguing foil to Daemon as a powerhouse for the greens. As the war escalates, Aemond will continue to be a great asset for his younger brother, heavily involved in leading his side as a dragonrider. However, his immaturity and bitterness will continue to shine through. While he may learn some control after the incident with Lucerys, the show has constructed Aemond as one of the more erratic characters, and he&#39;ll grow more dangerous with more power.
            
 
 Cregan Stark Is The Perfect Replacement For House Of The Dragon Season 2&#39;s Biggest Missing Character 
Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) will make his debut in House of the Dragon season 2, and returning to Winterfell will be key to the Game of Thrones prequel.









 7  Otto Hightower 
Otto will be a powerful ally to the greens in season 2. Given that his meddling was a large part of the division of the Targaryen house, Ser Otto Hightower was one of the most hated characters in season 1. Heading into season 2, Otto Hightower will be one of the most powerful House of the Dragon characters, able to amass large forces from the Reach. His contributions to the greens won&#39;t help his case, but the unhinged king, Aegon, will overshadow Otto&#39;s primarily rational actions.





 6  Mysaria 
Mysaria will be complicit in a gruesome child murder.
        

Like Larys Strong is to the greens, Mysaria will be the untrustworthy, unlikable ally of the blacks in season 2. In season 1, she establishes her own spy network in King&#39;s Landing, which Daemon will utilize to hire Blood and Cheese. Mysaria&#39;s complicity in the child murder will increase hatred for her, especially as she continues to reap the benefits of her political alliance with Rhaenyra and the blacks.





 5  Aegon Targaryen 
Aegon II will be a terrible king.
        

Like his brother, Aegon II Targaryen will only get worse as he gets more comfortable with power. The end of House of the Dragon season 1 saw Aegon coronated as the new monarch of Westeros, a responsibility he initially disdained. The House of the Dragon season 2 trailers showed Aegon seemingly embracing his new-found seat on the Iron Throne. In Fire &amp; Blood, Aegon welcomes Aemond back with a feast after he slays Lucerys, and as the war ensues, Aegon becomes paranoid and starts to drink heavily, making terrible decisions.





 4  Blood &amp; Cheese 
The pair of assassins will commit unspeakable acts in season 2. Though they technically haven&#39;t been introduced in House of the Dragon yet, Blood and Cheese were teased in season 1. The pair will be introduced early in season 2, as they&#39;re tasked with getting vengeance for Lucerys Velaryon&#39;s death. It will be one of the show&#39;s most gruesome and brutal scenes, as the two sneak into the Red Keep, bound and gag Alicent, then take Helaena captive and force her to choose which of her children will die. It&#39;s one of the most horrific events in George R.R. Martin&#39;s universe, and the characters will surely be hated.





 3  Larys Strong 
Larys will continue doing the dirty work for the greens in season 2. Lord Larys Strong became a helpful ally to Alicent late in season 1, but he&#39;s unlikable even to those he supports. The unsettling &#34;foot scene&#34; aside, Larys is a worm willing to backstab anyone, including his own family. Alicent will continue to utilize Larys for her dirty deeds in season 2, including torture. As a green supporter who&#39;s naturally unlikable, the hate for Larys will only get worse.





 2  Daemon Targaryen 
The Dance of the Dragons will see Daemon do horrible deeds.


 







In season 1, Daemon Targaryen was the type of bad guy that was sometimes possible to root for, as Matt Smith plays the character with charm and wit. Still, he&#39;s inarguably an awful person who does terrible things, and that will only get worse in season 2. Daemon is the one who will task Blood and Cheese with murdering a child earlier in the season, and it likely won&#39;t be the first war crime he commits. The season finale showed a division between Daemon and Rhaenyra in handling the loss of Viserys, and the war could continue to push them apart.





 1  Criston Cole 
Ser Criston Cole will continue to grow more bitter and petty in season 2.


 







Criston Cole was already among the most hated characters in House of the Dragon season 1 due to his bitterness after the falling out with Rhaenyra. In season 2, the knight will continue to grow more vengeful and angered. Cole personally sees to the beheadings of Rhaenyra&#39;s supporters in King&#39;s Landing who refuse to bend the knee to Aegon II, as seen in the season 2 trailer. Like Aemond, Criston Cole will be an essential leader for the greens, leading armies to battle.
