## Literature Review
The Traitors season 2 star Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio opens up about which of his fellow contestants he trusts the most in this game of deception.




The Traitors season 2 star, Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio, reveals that he trusted his The Challenge co-stars, Chris &#34;CT&#34; Tamburello and Trishelle Cannatella most during the competition. The three competitors all got their start on various seasons of MTV&#39;s The Real World, and have since gone on to become rivals in past seasons of The Challenge. Johnny holds the record for the most Challenge wins with seven, while CT has won five times and Trishelle has placed second in one final, but hasn&#39;t won. As they take on former contestants from Big Brother, Survivor, and other reality television shows, Johnny explains why they&#39;ll stick together during The Traitors season 2.




In an interview with Parade, Johnny revealed that, although there has been great rivalry among him, CT, and Trishelle, he trusted them the most during The Traitors. He explained, &#34;I&#39;m gonna know Trishelle and CT better than anyone else. From an overarching &#39;protect this house&#39; mindset, I&#39;m like &#34;We&#39;re all here representing the old-school Real World and The Challenge.&#34; Johnny also acknowledged that one or more of them might be Traitors. He said, &#34;At some point, the knives are going to come out, regardless, it&#39;s going to happen.&#34; However, he added, &#34;But I look at these two as people I can trust, and I think you&#39;re gonna go to bat for me at least early on.&#34;

Trishelle revealed that she, Johnny, and CT &#34;have a lot of history. We were doing Spring Break MTV like 20 years ago together. So I&#39;ve known Bananas for two decades, and CT and I&#39;s last show was like 14 years ago.&#34; Although they all haven’t always gotten along, Trishelle explained, &#34;They&#39;re like my brothers, and I can talk bad about my brothers, but you can&#39;t. I have not seen them in a long time, but when I saw them it felt like home, and I was like, &#39;Oh, my guys. I know they&#39;re gonna protect me.&#39;&#34; Johnny added, &#34;Sometimes the evil you know is better than the evil you don&#39;t.&#34;


 

On The Traitors season 2, Johnny, CT, and Trishelle will be playing against real-life couple Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan, Big Brother contestants Janelle Pierzina and Dan Gheesling, and Survivor rivals Parvati Shallow and Sandra Diaz-Twine, among others. The history between these Traitors players could give them an advantage even if they aren&#39;t the best of friends, so Johnny, CT, and Trishelle are smart to utilize their long-standing friendships in order to gain the upper hand against them. Although one or more of them might be Traitors in the end, this doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t protect each other from the beginning. They don&#39;t have to murder each other right away if they&#39;re Traitors.




The Traitors is a game of deception, so it&#39;s definitely an advantage when contestants enter the game with people they&#39;ve known for a long time. When they know their fellow contestants well, they not only can trust them, but can most likely figure out when they&#39;re lying. When viewed from that perspective, it&#39;s really not too surprising that these Challengers would stick together while competing on The Traitors. Johnny is right that, although he, CT, and Trishelle might have been rivals in the past, sticking with the people they know best might help them get to the end of The Traitors. Whatever happens, it&#39;s certain to be a very exciting season watching them all play together again.

The first three episodes of The Traitors will be available to stream on Peacock on January 12, 2024.
