Eric and Donna&rsquo;s daughter, Leia, experiences many of the same places, activities, and people her parents did 15 years earlier in Point Place.
The opening of That &rsquo;90s Show mirrors the pilot of That &rsquo;70s Show, and iconic catchphrases, like Red&rsquo;s insults, and Eric&rsquo;s Star Wars obsession make a return.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Netflix&rsquo;s That &rsquo;90s Show season 1 features numerous Easter eggs and references to That &rsquo;70s Show, including visits to familiar locations.</p>
<p>WARNING! This article contains SPOILERS for That &rsquo;90s Show&rsquo;s season 1!That ‘90s Show season 1 is full of Easter eggs and callbacks to That ‘70s Show, which makes for a nostalgic continuation of the original characters’ stories. Set in the summer of 1995, That ‘90s Show picks up 15 years after That ‘70s Show’s finale, though primarily focuses on a new generation of Point Place teens. While the 1990s setting leads to plenty of pop culture references and decade-specific Easter eggs, Netflix’s That ‘90s Show also features numerous nods to the original series, including its characters, locations, iconic gags, and memorable storylines.
Watch on Netflix
That ‘70s Show established early on that Point Place was a small town where not much changed, with That ‘90s Show certainly proving this reputation true. As Eric and Donna’s daughter Leia Forman stays in Point Place for the summer with her grandparents Red and Kitty, she finds herself hanging out in the same places, enjoying the same activities, and coming into contact with the same people that her parents did 15 years earlier. Here’s a breakdown of every That ‘70s Show Easter egg and reference featured in That ‘90s Show season 1.</p>
<p>That &rsquo;90s Show Season 2: Cast, Plot &amp; Everything We Know
That &rsquo;90s Show season 1&rsquo;s ending sets up future storylines and character returns. Here&rsquo;s everything we know about That &rsquo;90s Show season 2 on Netflix.</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show’s Opening Repeats That ‘70s Show’s Pilot</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show episode 1 opens with title cards that read: “Point Place, Wisconsin. July 3rd, 1995. 11:47 a.m. Location: Kitty Forman’s Kitchen.” This opening is the same as That ‘70s Show’s pilot, which began with title cards reading: “Point Place, Wisconsin. May 17th, 1976. 8:47 p.m. Location: Eric Forman’s Basement.” Instead of cutting to the gang figuring out how to steal beer, That ‘90s Show begins as returning characters Kitty and Red dance to music and make a sandwich.</p>
<p>Red’s Best Catchphrases Are Back In That ‘90s Show</p>
<p>Red Forman uttered two of the most iconic catchphrases of That ‘70s Show throughout That ‘90s Show. While essentially raising six teenagers throughout the late ‘70s, Red frequently had to bring out his best insults, which involved calling people “dumbasses” or staying he would “put [his] foot in [their] ass.” In That ‘90s Show episode 1, Kitty, Donna, and Eric join in with Red as he remarks that standing behind one’s kids is a good idea because it makes it easier to “put your foot in their ass.” As Leia and her friends get into more trouble throughout the season, the gang earns their fair share of “dumbass” insults from grandpa Red.</p>
<p>Eric’s Star Wars Obsession Has Grown Since That ‘70s Show</p>
<p>Since Star Wars premiered during That ‘70s Show season 1’s timeline, Eric Forman has been an obsessive fan since the very beginning. Staying true to form, Eric’s Star Wars obsession is made even better throughout That ‘90s Show episode 1 as he makes numerous references to the franchise, reveals that he teaches a college course on “The Religion of Star Wars,” and even named his daughter after Carrie Fisher’s iconic character Princess Leia. Since the Star Wars prequel trilogy hasn’t even been released yet in That ‘90s Show’s timeline, Eric’s love for the franchise will certainly evolve throughout the sitcom.</p>
<p>Gwen Is Living In Donna’s Old Bedroom</p>
<p>Leia’s new best friend Gwen is now residing in Donna Pinciotti’s old bedroom, passing it on from one generation’s feminist rocker to another. While the Forman house was the most common location in That ‘70s Show, the series often took place in Donna’s bedroom when entering the Pinciotti house next door. Donna’s father Bob moved to Florida in That ‘70s Show season 8’s ending, so Gwen, Nate, and Sherri are the newest bunch living in the familiar home.</p>
<p>The Gang Opens Up Eric’s Candyland Stash</p>
<p>At the end of That ‘90s Show’s season 1 premiere, Kitty hands the teens a box of Eric’s old stuff from the 1970s, which includes a memorable board game. Eric’s Candyland stash became a frequent gag throughout That ‘70s Show, as Eric would often hide money or weed in the board game hoping that his parents and friends wouldn’t look there. However, everyone was aware that the game was his secret hiding place. That ‘90s Show reveals that Eric forgot to clear out his stash from the late 1970s before moving out of his parents’ house, as Leia and her friends join in their very first Forman basement Circle with the 15-year-old weed found in the box.</p>
<p>The Underage Gang Tries To Buy A Tap For A Keg</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show season 1, episode 1 pays homage to one of the earliest and most memorable misadventures of the Point Place teens from the 1970s. In That ‘70s Show season 1, episode 6, “The Keg,” the gang finds a keg and decides to throw a party, but gets into trouble when realizing it doesn’t have a tap. Kelso goes to the liquor store and pretends to be a 25-year-old to buy a tap, only for the employee to say there’s no age limit on buying taps.
That ‘90s Show repeats this storyline after the gang is mistakenly given a keg, which similarly comes without a tap. Donna&rsquo;s daughter Leia has to disguise herself as a pregnant adult to avoid being carded by the liquor store owner, though she ultimately has to blackmail her way into getting the tap. Just like their parents 20 years before, Leia, Jay, and Point Place’s new teens find creative ways to party with a stolen keg.</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show Works Because Of That ‘70s Show’s Plot Holes
That &rsquo;90s Show has been a success, despite timeline inconsistencies, and it owes this to the many plot holes established in That &rsquo;70s show.</p>
<p>Party On The Water Tower (Which Still Has Kelso’s Graffiti)</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show’s pilot also brings audiences back to a familiar location from That ‘70s Show when the teens venture up to the Water Tower. The landmark was best known in That ‘70s Show for being a structure that Kelso, Eric, Hyde, and Fez fell off of on numerous occasions, as well as a place for the teens to drink and make graffiti. When Leia and her friends climb up the Water Tower in That ‘90s Show, Kelso’s graffiti of “Michael + Jackie” and the pot leaf giving the finger are still visible. While nobody falls off the Water Tower in That ‘90s Show season 1, Leia and Gwen do end up spray-painting their names.</p>
<p>Eric &amp; Donna Repeat Their First That ‘70s Show Flirtations</p>
<p>Before leaving Leia with Red and Kitty, Donna and Eric sit on the hood of the car in the driveway, which was a common location for the two to be alone together. They also playfully push each other’s heads, referencing their first flirtation in That ‘70s Show’s pilot when they sat on the steps of the basement. Eric directly references this pivotal moment when talking to Leia about the basement, as he mentions to his daughter that he realized he loved Donna when they sat together on those stairs in That ‘70s Show episode 1.</p>
<p>The Formans Kept The Stupid Helmet</p>
<p>While the object itself is never explicitly mentioned, That &rsquo;70s Show&rsquo;s Stupid Helmet makes numerous appearances in the background of That ‘90s Show season 1. The Green Bay Packers helmet sat in the corner of the Formans’ basement throughout That ‘70s Show, with the gear even being worn by characters like Kelso or Eric when they were deemed to be doing something stupid. The helmet still sits in the basement in That ‘90s Show, though it ends up being placed on top of a mannequin when Leia and her friends party and dance to music.</p>
<p>Pastor Dave Has Gone Down An “Unholy” Path</p>
<p>After spotting Pastor Dave at the video store, Kitty Forman looks into the “Adults Only” section and finds him doing something “unholy” behind curtains. While Pastor Dave doesn’t return on-screen in That ‘90s Show, he’s a memorable recurring character from That ‘70s Show. In the original series, Kevin McDonald’s Dave was the pastor at Kitty’s church who formed an unexpected bond with Red over their shared love of sports, with the clergyman also annoying the teens as he tried to be “hip” and connect with them.</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show Keeps Fez’s Homeland A Mystery</p>
<p>One of the greatest running gags in That ‘70s Show was the mystery of Fez’s home country. Fez never mentioned it by name with the other characters never being able to remember his homeland. That ‘90s Show keeps the mystery alive by revealing that Kitty knows where Fez is from, but audiences never will. When Sherri asks where Fez is from, Kitty answers, but her words are muffled by the sound of the tea kettle. There is a new detail about Fez’s mysterious origins, however, as Kitty mentions that she “hears it’s just lovely there.”</p>
<p>Red Remembers Kelso Gluing Himself To Their Fridge</p>
<p>When judging Jay for the stupidity of his father, Red references one of Kelso’s most memorable moments from That ‘70s Show in which he glued himself to their refrigerator. That ‘90s Show’s line is a callback to That ‘70s Show season 7, episode 12 when Red and Kitty were reflecting on some of Kelso’s dumbest moments. Red recalls one morning at 6 a.m. when he came downstairs to see Kelso standing in their kitchen, with Ashton Kutcher’s character sadly admitting that he glued himself to the fridge. Time will tell if Michael’s son Jay Kelso can top these moments and further disappoint Red.</p>
<p>That ‘90s Show’s Big Romance Pays Off Donna &amp; Casey’s ‘70s Show Story
That &rsquo;90s Show is teasing that its big romance will be between Leia Forman and Jay, calling back to Donna &amp; Casey Kelso&rsquo;s That &rsquo;70s Show relationship.</p>
<p>Kitty’s Dog Schatzi Is Still A Mystery</p>
<p>A clever Easter egg by That ‘90s Show season 1 is the box of dog treats that Jay uses to hide their stash. Kitty puts the box with the rest of the stuff they’re getting rid of because the family no longer has a dog. The unnamed dog being referenced is Schatzi, the Dachshund that Kitty owned in That ‘70s Show seasons 5, 6, and 7. However, Schatzi’s fate became a mystery after he suddenly vanished from the series without explanation, with That ‘90s Show at least confirming that he did, in fact, exist. It’s unclear what became of Schatzi, but Kitty seemingly couldn’t bring herself to throw away his treats.
That &rsquo;70s Show is available to stream on Peacock.</p>
<p>The Forman Bunch Doesn’t Forget About Laurie</p>
<p>While Eric’s older sister Laurie Forman is never mentioned by name, she is vaguely referenced by Red in That ‘90s Show. Red mentions that he originally only wanted to have one kid, referencing Laurie, but Kitty convinced him to have another, which gave them Eric. That ‘90s Show failing to actually name-drop Laurie suggests she won’t appear in the sequel series. Laurie’s original actress Lisa Robin Kelly passed away in 2013, with the recast second actress Christina Moore only appearing in six episodes before being written out of That ‘70s Show after season 6.</p>
<p>Leia Gets The Vista Cruiser</p>
<p>On her 15th birthday, Red grants Leia Eric’s old Vista Cruiser, the iconic car that hauled the gang on their wild misadventures in That ‘70s Show. Leia soon reveals that the license plates were still from 1980, which means that the car hasn’t been driven since shortly after That ‘70s Show’s finale. When Leia returns in That ‘90s Show season 2 with her driver’s license, Eric’s Vista Cruiser will have been given a second life as it carries a new generation of Point Place teens around town.</p>
<p>“I Don’t Know What You Heard But This Show Ain’t Free!”</p>
<p>Fez and Red find themselves in a familiar situation when discussing Sherri’s landlord in That ‘90s Show’s season 1 finale. When Fez goes to hug Red, he accidentally drops the blanket using to cover up, leading to the second time he has flashed Red. In response to Red being appalled, hair salon-owner Fez yells, “I don’t know what you heard, but this show ain’t free!” This is a direct reference to That ‘70s Show season 6 when Red walks in on Fez naked in the shower, prompting Wilmer Valderrama’s character to utter the same line.</p>
<p>Donna Recalls Her Bad Romance With Casey Kelso</p>
<p>When comforting Leia after she’s broken up with by Jay Kelso in That ‘90s Show season 1, episode 10, Donna relates her own experience dating a Kelso. Donna mentions that during one of the times that she and Eric were broken up in high school, she dated Jay’s uncle. This sentimental moment between Donna and her daughter Leia is referencing That ‘70s Show’s season 4 storyline in which Donna begins dating Michael’s older brother Casey Kelso (Luke Wilson).</p>
<p>The Kelsos Love A Good Burn!</p>
<p>Michael Kelso’s That ‘90s Show cameo begins as Ashton Kutcher yells “burn!” while entering the Forman house. This is a reference to his biggest catchphrase in That ‘70s Show, which he frequently yelled after one of the characters insulted, pranked, or proved wrong the other members of the gang. Passing off the torch to a new generation, Michael’s son Jay officially proves himself to be a Kelso when he successfully yells “burn” in the season 1 finale of That &rsquo;70s Show&rsquo;s spinoff. Jay screams Kelso’s catchphrase at Nate after Gwen makes a joke about dropping him down the stairs as a baby, which ironically also connects back to Michael’s insecurity in That ‘70s Show about being dropped on his head.</p>
<p>Donna &amp; Jackie’s Kids Reveal A Bizarre That ‘70s Show Ending Detail
Donna&rsquo;s daughter Leia and Jackie&rsquo;s son Jay in That &rsquo;90s Show subtly reveal an unexpected detail about That &rsquo;70s Show&rsquo;s character endings.</p>
<p>That ‘70s Show’s Circle Flashbacks</p>
<p>The end of That ‘90s Show’s season 1 finale includes a sequence in which Fez joins in the Circle with Nikki and Ozzie. Fez then imagines younger versions of his friends in That &rsquo;70s Show&rsquo;s Circles, with That ‘90s Show including flashbacks of Eric, Jackie, and Kelso in early episodes of the original sitcom. When adult Donna comes down to the Circle at the end, Fez remarks that “the old gang is here,” though the sequel series notably leaves out That ‘70s Show’s stoner character Hyde.</p>
<p>Fez &amp; Fenton’s Feud Is Still Alive</p>
<p>Jim Rash reprises his role as That ‘70s Show’s recurring character Fenton for a surprise cameo in That ‘90s Show’s season 1 ending. Introduced in That ‘70s Show season 5 as a jewelry store employee, Fenton later played a bigger role in the final two seasons as Fez’s landlord. The two often got into fights and established a fierce hatred for one another, which hasn’t waned in the 15 years leading up to That ‘90s Show. Fenton returns in That ‘90s Show as Sherri’s landlord, which makes Fez’s attempts to stand up for her more frustrating.</p>
