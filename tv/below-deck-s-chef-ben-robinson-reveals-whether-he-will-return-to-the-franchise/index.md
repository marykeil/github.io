## Literature Review
Notorious Below Deck chef Ben Robinson revealed a spoiler about the potential for him to return to the franchise that made him famous and well-liked.




Below Deck franchise chef and show OG Ben Robinson revealed a major spoiler about whether fans can expect to see him reprise his role in the future. Below Deck fans watched Ben chef it up on four seasons of the hit Bravo yachting show. He appeared on Below Deck seasons 1 to 4 and Below Deck Mediterranean seasons 1 and 4. Chef Ben also had a recurring role on Below Deck Galley Talk alongside his friend and Below Deck co-star Kate Chastain. These days, Ben has also been focusing on his chef career and brand promotions.




Ben recently shared a video of himself talking to a crowd about a menu with a backstory he curated. Food blogger Ben didn&#39;t reveal anything about his potential Below Deck future in the video, but he did share some key information in the comments section. When replying to a fan who asked Ben if he would ever &#34;go back on Below Deck,&#34; Ben replied, &#34;I don’t think so. But stay tuned please… Good things on the horizon…&#34;


 

While Ben dashed fans&#39; hopes of seeing on their TV screens in a Below Deck capacity, he did tantalize fans by not writing it off completely and noting there was more to come.

In another reply to a comment, Ben gave more hints as to what Below Deck fans could expect from him in the future. An admirer commented, &#34;You should have your own cooking show on Television! I would watch every episode!&#34; To which Ben wrote, &#34;cheers you… Soon.&#34; Ben&#39;s responses signal that a Below Deck return is unlikely, but anyone wishing to follow him as a chef could have happy days ahead.

Ben rose to fame in the Below Deck and Bravo world for his charismatic and wild personality. Not to mention, Ben is a very talented and reputable chef who delivered some highly entertaining kitchen drama and stellar meals. When Ben wasn&#39;t cooking in the galley, he showcased his boozy side and ability to attract the ladies. Ben had several notable boatmances on and off-screen over the years, and those connections proved interesting and dynamic.

It appears unlikely Chef Ben will grace Below Deck fans with his presence on the show once again. After all, his popularity on the show catapulted him to new heights and he has many professional endeavors to his name. However, despite the low odds of a return, Ben did not ax the idea entirely and could surprise Below Deck fans in the future, perhaps when he is less busy following his chef dreams off-camera.






Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays on Bravo at 8 p.m. EST.
