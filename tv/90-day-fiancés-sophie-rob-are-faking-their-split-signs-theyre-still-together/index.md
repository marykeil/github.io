## Literature Review
Despite having several heated arguments on 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Rob Warne and Sophie Sierra’s social media hints that they’re still together.




Rob Warne and Sophie Sierra from 90 Day Fiancé season 10 are probably still with each other amid breakup rumors. The 32-year-old Los Angeles native and his 23-year-old British lover had a decent relationship early on. They shared matching interests and related to each other’s past, which made them feel attracted to each other. Unfortunately, their relationship dynamic changed when Sophie arrived in the United States and realized Rob wasn’t the thoughtful and considerate man she hoped for. She struggled in his bathroom-less apartment and discovered that he had cheated on her during their long-distance relationship.




Sophie moved out of Rob’s terrible home and rented a place for herself during episode 5. She then called him out for all the r-rated content he had shared with another female. In a later episode, Sophie ended her relationship with Rob and they split. She left him and threw away his ring. While Rob tried his best to push Sophie to accept him and apologize for his mistake, Sophie didn’t give time to her day. She said that anything Rob was saying meant nothing to her.

 Rob Still Has Sophie’s Pictures On His IG Feed 

 

Most of the latest rumors and the couple’s social media actions hint they are no longer together. However, a few clues suggest that Rob and Sophie may be faking their split for different reasons. Recently, Rob has deleted all photos of Sophie from the top of his profile and doesn’t talk about her much. However, he still has many of her pictures on his Instagram feed, suggesting he may still be with her. If Rob had truly split from Sophie, he would’ve deleted everything related to her and tried his luck with other women. However, he hasn’t done that yet, which may be because he’s still in a relationship with his British girlfriend.






 Rob &amp; Sophie Post Pictures From The Same Corridor 
          

Rob and Sophie aren’t posting new photos with each other. However, they’ve shared some content from the same locations, hinting that they’re in each other’s proximity. In December, Sophie posted a cute modeling shot in cargo pants and a crop top. She stood in a long corridor with dual-toned walls and a painted floor. A few weeks later, Rob shared a photo of himself from the same area. He wore an urban outfit with a camouflage pattern that complemented Sophie’s pants. The two didn’t like each other’s photos on Instagram, which was probably something they had pre-planned to fake their split.



 Sophie Doesn’t Respond To Negative Comments About Rob 

 




90 Day Fiancé couples who break up on bad terms bad-mouth each other on social media. Jasmine Pineda did it to Gino Palazzolo during their brief split, Kalani Faagata did it to Asuelu Pulaa, Kelly Brown did it to Molly Hopkins, etc. Since Rob cheated on Sophie, she has all the right to talk about her experience and inspire her followers with her comeback story. However, she never really delves into the cheating scandal. Sophie doesn’t take shots at Rob or try to expose him. She never engages with people who talk bad about Rob. The 90 Day Fiancé cast member is either a mature woman or still in a relationship with her toxic American boyfriend. The latter sounds more plausible.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
