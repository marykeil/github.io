## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Christine Brown recalls the moment she knew she was in love with husband David Woolley while revealing she was cautious at first.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown revealed what made her fall for husband David Woolley and what makes him so different from Kody Brown. Christine got “spiritually” married to Kody in March 1994. She was the third of his four wives and was not able to marry him legally since he was still married to Meri Brown. Christine changed her last name from Allred to Brown. The Utah native became the mother to six of Kody’s 18 children, but tension started building up in the polygamous clan that only heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Christine realized she was no longer happy in the marriage and became the first of Kody’s wives to leave him.




Christine was engaged to David when she filmed the Sister Wives One on One with Sukanya Krishnan, as revealed in a clip shared by ET.


 

In the video, Sukanya asks Christine how different her relationship with David is from what it was with Kody. Christine admitted that the first thing she realized was that David loved her. “He loves me, and I feel so loved,” she added. According to Christine, being loved in the way she is by David comes with a kind of confidence that she can just be herself. “There’s no strings attached to it, nothing,” said Christine, confirming that the winner in this situation is her marriage with David.

Christine said that she doesn’t have to do “anything to earn his love.” The love that David gives her is always there. “It is always constant,” she confidently shared. Christine called David the “love of her life” as she flashed her engagement ring to the cameras. Christine was casually dating and not looking for “the one” when she signed up to do “this online dating thing.” Christine saw David’s profile on the night that she signed up for it. She went on a date with him and discovered how charming, kind, and sweet he is. “And he says everything right,” she exclaimed.

This made warning bells ring in Christine’s head. She thought to herself, “That can’t be right, there’s no way he can be that great.” However, Christine kept wondering if David was being “real.” He invited her to his house on his birthday so she could meet his family. Christine knew that it was real then. It was their fourth date, and she fell in love with him that night. Christine recalled them sitting with a huge group and David pulling her chair to him. “And he puts his arm around me and I put my head against his chest,” Christine continued. At that moment, Christine realized, “This was it.”




Christine confirmed she was dating someone new in February 2023. She revealed her mystery man on Instagram on Valentine’s Day 2023. Two months later, Christine was engaged to David and married him in October 2023. Ironically, Christine met David on a website that she’d seen being advertised during a Sister Wives commercial break. Christine and David&#39;s wedding ceremony will be part of a two-episode special that will air after Sister Wives season 18 is over.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
