## Literature Review
Angela Deem’s latest Instagram video suggests that Michael Ilesanmi’s spousal visa got approved, causing fans to question what&#39;s actually going on.




Angela Deem posted a romantic video featuring Michael Ilesanmi, which confused many 90 Day Fiancé fans on social media. The 58-year-old woman and her Nigerian husband have been together for over half a decade. However, it wasn’t until 2023 that they overcame their issues and truly embraced each other. Angela and Michael appeared on 90 Day: The Last Resort to re-evaluate their marriage. The Georgia native even brought divorce papers with her just in case things didn’t work out with her husband. Fortunately, Michael was able to win Angela over with his changed behavior. He reconciled with her after his mother’s passing.




Recently, Angela posted a video on Instagram that featured Michael kissing her on the cheek. She captioned it, “If you know you know you know,” hinting that her husband had finally made it to the United States. As expected, many 90 Day Fiancé viewers got curious and inquired about Michael’s whereabouts.


 

A social media user wrote, “Is he here?” Another joked, “Plot twist, he’s been here for years.” A few social media users also shared that Angela was in Nigeria to meet Michael, which seemed more probable. Monsters &amp; Critics confirmed the couple was in Michael’s hometown relishing their married life.

Angela and Michael met before they appeared on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days in 2018. They connected online, like most 90 Day Fiancé couples before them. Initially, they seemed to have a real connection that outshined their 22-year age gap. However, things worsened once they tied the knot, and Angela returned to the United States to focus on her family and happiness. The distance proved too much for Michael when he cheated on Angela by having an affair online. But she forgave her husband and stayed by his side.

Fans are rightfully confused by Angela&#39;s post because she rarely shares cuddly videos with her husband. The grandma of six likes to discuss her daily adventures or share cringe-worthy TikTok videos online. She is always displaying a certain persona and never really shows real love for Michael. However, her recent video was different from her other content. It seemed more genuine, which made her followers wonder if the two had reached a major milestone. Unfortunately, it looks like the spousal visa hasn’t brought them together just yet. Rather, they&#39;re likely celebrating Angela&#39;s 58th birthday in Nigeria.




There&#39;s a lot of anticipation for the day when Michael gets his American spousal visa approved. The 35-year-old man has endured a lot in his relationship with Angela and has even dealt with mental abuse. Sadly, he’s still stuck in Nigeria because Angela probably hasn’t tried her best to get him to the U.S. Angela has lived her best life, embracing reality TV fame, becoming fitter, and earning a lot since her wedding. In comparison, Michael has only suffered and hasn’t been able to live freely. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé star’s patience will pay off, and he will make it to America someday.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
