## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 villain Rob Warne has a criminal past. The Los Angeles native has revealed details of why he was arrested when he was 17.




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne has been arrested for two battery charges in the past. Rob is a 32-year-old from Los Angeles currently starring in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 with Sophie Sierra, who&#39;s 23. Rob and Sophie, from London, met on Instagram after following his account. Rob and Sophie dated for a couple of years but took a break during COVID-19 when the restrictions kept them apart. During this time, Rob began chatting with someone on social media. Sophie found out when the person told her about Rob messaging her.




Meanwhile, Sophie now lives in Rob’s apartment after moving to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. The couple also fought about kids, since Sophie had decided she didn&#39;t want to get pregnant. Sophie had a feeling that Rob was still cheating on her. She went through his phone and saw an app where he was getting inappropriate videos from other women. Sophie moved out of Rob’s apartment right away. Rob’s creepy behavior landed him on the list of franchise villains for 90 Day Fiancé fans. Moreover, his criminal past has given them one more reason to dislike Rob.

 Rob Was First Arrested When He Was 17 Years Old 
          




One of Rob’s first offenses took place in 2007. Rob was just 17 years old back then. Rob was charged with one count of aggravated battery and one count of battery. The information has been revealed through legal documents obtained by In Touch. The incident that led to Rob’s arrest occurred at 7 pm in Overland Park, Kansas. An argument had led to the charges. Rob agreed to a “pretrial diversion agreement,” meaning he had to pay a fine, participate in counseling, etc. The criminal proceeding was suspended by the court and his charges were reduced to “one count of disorderly conduct” before the case was dismissed.



 Rob Was Charged With Aggravated Assault In 2007 
          

Rob got into trouble once again after a very short amount of time. He was arrested just nine months later, on September 11, 2007. He was charged with aggravated assault and obstruction or impeding lawful activities. The charges involved an “air gun, air rifle, bow and arrow and slingshot.” Rob pleaded guilty and was asked to pay a fine, which he did.






 Rob Unhappy With 90 Day Fiancé Viewers Circulating His Mugshot 

 

After the news of Rob’s past arrests came to light, he decided to post a statement to claim he is no criminal and has no felonies (as shared by lakeju69.) Rob shared the mugshot himself and captioned it, “16 years ago as a kid arrested for a toy, &amp; having stupid friends.” He said he was in his car with a friend when his friend thought it would be fun to point a BB gun and shoot “some little BBs” at an apartment. Rob drove to the house where his car was recognized. “I got arrested for it and went to court and it came down to a misdemeanor,” he added.

According to Rob, he never did anything, but someone decided to put his mugshot online and tell everybody that he was arrested. Rob is upset that 90 Day Fiancé viewers seem to assume the worst about him, but “the real ones know what’s up tho,” he wrote. Rob thinks that people finding and spreading his mugshot is “wild,” and whoever is doing it has “got A LOT of time” on their hands. Rob thinks the internet is “so damn nosey,” and people should do some “real research” before bashing him for something they have no idea about.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
