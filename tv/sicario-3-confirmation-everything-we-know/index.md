## Literature Review

Sicario is one of the best crime movies of the 2010s, and Sicario: Day of the Soldado even set up a threequel, but why hasn&#39;t Sicario 3 been made yet?




Sicario is one of the most influential action dramas of the 2010s, as was the sequel, but despite years of Sicario 3 news, Sicario: Capos hasn&#39;t materialized. 2015&#39;s Sicario is about a task force attempting to take on the Mexican drug cartel led by CIA agent Matt Graver and the mysterious hitman Alejandro Gillick. However, it&#39;s revealed at the end of the movie that the task force&#39;s real mission is to further control the cartel. The 2018 sequel, Sicario: Day of the Soldado, sees Alejandro and Matt working together again, and while it isn&#39;t quite as beloved as the original movie, it does a great job of setting up Sicario 3.




The first Sicario movie was a huge critical success, and the audience response was overwhelmingly positive too. The movie made a respectable $85 million off a $30 million budget (via Box Office Mojo), which was good enough to get a sequel greenlit. 2018&#39;s Sicario: Day of the Soldado wasn&#39;t as well received, which is partly because Villeneuve didn&#39;t return to direct the sequel. However, Taylor Sheridan did return as the writer, and the sequel&#39;s narrative is just as compelling as the first movie. While Sicario 3 was announced with Sheridan returning as the screenwriter, the threequel still hasn&#39;t arrived.


 Most Recent Sicario 3 News 
The Producers Hope To Reunite The Original Cast
         

With most of 2023 lost to the Hollywood strikes, the future of the Sicario threequel seemed dour. However, the latest news reveals the film&#39;s plan to reunite the original stars for Sicario: Capos. Despite Josh Brolin&#39;s earlier statements which seemed to doom the sequel, it has now been announced that producers Molly Smith and Trent Luckinbill have an ambitious plan to bring Brolin back alongside former co-stars Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro.




The announcement was made in late October 2023 and came during the height of the SAG-AFTRA strike. This timing made casting a near impossibility, as most actors were standing in solidarity with the union and were unable to hash out any deals. However, with several months passing since the resolution of the strike, no further updates have come regarding Smith and Luckinbill&#39;s plan. Despite that, it is a good sign that Sicario: Capos is in active development.



The SAG-AFTRA strike began in July 2023 and was resolved in November 2023.

Sicario 3 has been confirmed by producer Trent Luckinbill, but it&#39;s seemingly stuck in development hell and there is no Sicario 3 release date. In a previous interview, Josh Brolin was very optimistic about the threequel (via The Hollywood Reporter). The actor revealed that Sheridan had even already completed the screenplay. Brolin commented, &#34;It’s very much at the forefront of all of our minds. It’s been written and...We think it deserves a third one&#34;. Luckinbill even hinted at the possibility of Villeneuve returning to direct (via Aubtu).

Will Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, And Benicio del Toro Return?
          

Given that the whole series is based around the hitman Alejandro, the Sicario 3 cast will undoubtedly be led by Benicio del Toro once again. The actor will almost certainly be accompanied by Josh Brolin, reprising his role as Matt Graver in the threequel. Elijah Rodriguez could return as Miguel Hernandez too. While Emily Blunt&#39;s Kate Mercer was essentially the lead character in Sicario but was absent in Sicario: Day of the Soldado. It&#39;s clear from the producer&#39;s comments that Blunt&#39;s return is quintessential to Sicario: Capos.

What Could Happen In Sicario 3?
          




The working title for Sicario 3 is Sicario: Capos, which translates to &#34;bosses&#34;. That could mean that Matt and Alejandro will be facing off against the heads of the Mexican drug cartel. The Sicario 3 story will also see Matt potentially being removed from his CIA position given that he disobeyed orders in Sicario: Day of the Soldado. If Emily Blunt returns as Kate, the Sicario: Capos story could see Kate trying to expose Matt and Alejandro for all of their illegal activity and trying to control the drug cartel.

               Sicario: Capos   Writers:   Taylor Sheridan    Distributor(s):   Lionsgate    prequel(s):   Sicario, Sicario: Day Of The Soldado    Franchise(s):   Sicario
