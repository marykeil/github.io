## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 couple Ashley Michelle and her Ecuadorian partner Manuel could be having a baby. A look at why they sparked pregnancy rumors.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 couple Ashley Michelle and Manuel have sparked pregnancy rumors with a new photo after filming the series. Ashley, a 31-year-old from Rochester, New York, who works as a professional witch, is in a relationship with Manuel from Puyo, Ecuador. He is 34 years old and used to be a construction worker back home. Ashley went to Ecuador to study marine biology when she met Manuel during a New Year’s Eve party. They got engaged within a week, but Ashley came back home and quickly realized their long-distance romance wasn’t working out.




Manuel reached out to Ashley 10 years later when she was dealing with a breakup. She went back to Ecuador and came back engaged a second time. Ashley decided to apply for Manuel’s K-1 visa. However, Manuel, who had two teenage sons now, moved to America without telling his family. He also informed Ashley that he had to send money home. Ashley started having second thoughts about marrying Manuel because she expected her partner to be truthful to his family. However, amid the ups and downs, it appears Ashley and Manuel could be having a baby.
