 What Will Happen In Solo Leveling Episode #1? 
          

As per the exclusive screener that Crunchyroll shared with Screen Rant, the first episode of Solo Leveling will introduce Sung Jin-Woo, the protagonist of the series, and his occupation as a hunter. Known as the weakest hunter in the world, he persists in such a deadly job as he desperately needs the money to take care of himself and his loved ones. Set in a world where dangerous dungeons appear, hunters are people with supernatural abilities who conquer these dungeons to make a living. An unexpected accident will give Sung Jin-Woo isekai-like powers that will allow him to grow and become the strongest hunter.






 Solo Leveling Promises To Take Over 2024 
          

As one of the most popular manhwa series, Solo Leveling had garnered a huge fanbase way before it was announced to receive an anime. Manhwa adaptations are fairly popular, with Tower of God and God of Highschool being the most popular, but Solo Leveling has the potential to be at the forefront of anime adaptations of South Korean comics. The anime had already multiple premieres all over the world before its release date, demonstrating the intense hype surrounding the series as the due date approaches.

With excellent and experienced staff, such as director Shunsuke Nagashike, and Hiroyuki Sawano as the music composer, Solo Leveling already has all the ingredients necessary to become the most successful anime of 2024.

Solo Leveling will debut on Crunchyroll on January 6.
