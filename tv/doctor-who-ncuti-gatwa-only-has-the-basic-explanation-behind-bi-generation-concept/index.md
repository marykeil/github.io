## Literature Review
Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa reveals he only has a basic explanation behind bi-generation, a concept he equates to myth in the show&#39;s universe.




Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa has revealed he doesn&#39;t have a full explanation for what bi-generation is, or what it means for the series overall. In the show&#39;s 60th anniversary specials, the Toymaker shot the Fourteenth Doctor with a weapon that caused another version of himself, Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor, to form. This process, known as bi-generation, means two Doctors now exist at the same time after the two split apart.




Speaking with Inverse, Gatwa explained he only has a basic idea behind bi-generation and what it means for Doctor Who season 14. The actor revealed showrunner Russell T. Davies is hoping to expand the series&#39; lore, with how the Fifteenth Doctor came to be acting as part of that expansion. Check out what Gatwa had to say below:


All very, very, very, very good questions that I don’t know whether I know the answers to, actually. I know that Russell wants to expand massively the universe as we know it, and is bringing in this lovely element of fantasy in, and a bit more Time Lord lore and mythology. So this, as you say, is a very new thing. I guess it’s a myth that has existed in Time Lord history gone by. I guess 14 also knows that it’s a myth, but 15 has been the one to prove it is real... is all I can tell you so far.



 What Bi-Generation Means For The Future Of Doctor Who 
          




Unlike regular regeneration, where one Doctor is replaced by another, bi-generation allows the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Doctors to exist at the same time. At the end of Doctor Who&#39;s 60th anniversary specials, the older Doctor decides to settle down with his friend Donna Noble on Earth. However, he is also gifted a TARDIS by the newer Doctor, hinting at the concept of two of them existing at once being revisited in the future.

While it&#39;s still unclear why the Toymaker&#39;s weapon resulted in bi-generation, it opens the door for different types of regeneration in Doctor Who&#39;s future. If the Fifteenth Doctor were to go through the same process again, multiple Doctors could exist at the same time. This means every version of the character could get their own satisfactory ending instead of always having to become a new version of themselves.

Doctor Who&#39;s bi-generation could also be setting up a major crossover between multiple Doctors sometime down the line. While multi-Doctor stories have happened in the past, this new version of regeneration means a larger cast could be built up over many years for a future event. No matter the outcome of this new concept, it will likely be important to the show&#39;s expanding universe in the future.






More information about bi-generation could be revealed when Doctor Who season 14 officially begins in May 2024.
