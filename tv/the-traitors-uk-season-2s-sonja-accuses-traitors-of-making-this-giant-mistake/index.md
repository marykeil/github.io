## Literature Review
The Traitors UK season 2&#39;s Sonja may have been one of the first to be banished from the series, but she believes the traitors made one huge mistake.




The Traitors UK season 2 is off to an exciting start with the traitors having gotten rid of three faithful in just the first few episodes, but banished cast member Sonja feels they made a huge mistake. While The Traitors UK season 2 has only just started, the drama has already been well-established throughout the first several episodes. After the traitors were named and recruited a fourth member of their team, they discussed who they would target for the first murder of the season. While the cast worked to figure out who the traitors were with the limited information they were given, they wound up banishing Sonja, who was faithful.




Even though The Traitors UK cast member was playing the game as a faithful, her penchant for stirring the pot wasn’t unnoticed by group and her name quickly came up at the round table. Although Sonja tried to impress upon the group that she was faithful, they chose to banish her and were crushed to find out they’d taken out a faithful so early. In an interview with Metro.co.uk, Sonja shared she felt the traitors “made a mistake” when they chose not to recruit her, explaining, “I would have probably played a different game if they’d made me a Traitor.”

 The Traitors UK Contestants Shouldn’t Get On Diane’s Bad Side 
          




While Sonja shared that she “didn’t have any negative tension…I had a really nice couple of days,” she did share that there were a few competitors who surprised her with their behavior during her time on The Traitors UK season 2. According to Sonja, Diane Carson is “a strong lady, and she’s not frightened to say what she thinks. If you remember in my banishment before Claudia finished speaking, Diane was like, ‘I’ve got something to say.’ You think, ‘Wow, here’s a force of nature.’…You don’t want to cross Diane, but she’s fair and she looks out for everybody.” Sonja feels Diane is a force to be reckoned with.


 

While Sonja hopes to see Diane continue in the game, it’s possible that she could be joining her devious friend on the outs fairly quickly. Diane, who was revealed to be playing the game in secret with her son Ross Carson, has been one of the names thrown around for the second banishment of The Traitors UK season 2. Though many are convinced she’s faithful, it has been theorized that the sweet, doting retired teacher may be using her persona to her advantage. With Diane and Ross’s secret already pushing them to play the game somewhat differently, it’s possible her life in The Traitors UK could be on the line.




With Sonja having been banished from the game early, her knowledge on what’s happened on The Traitors UK season 2 has been limited. While she was told who the traitors were after her banishment alongside murdered contestant, Aubrey Emerson, Sonja has very little intel on what else has happened on the series. Excited to watch along with the rest of the viewers, Sonja hopes to see another incredibly compelling season of The Traitors UK as the complex game play continues.
