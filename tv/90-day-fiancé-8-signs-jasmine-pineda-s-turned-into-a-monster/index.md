## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Jasmine Pineda&#39;s outrageous behavior and antics in her life and relationship have shown she&#39;s turning into a monster.




Jasmine Pineda is a 90 Day Fiancé franchise alum who has turned into a monster. Jasmine, 36, has been in a relationship with Gino Palazzolo, 53, for around three years. Gino had initially lied and said he and Jasmine met on an international dating site when, in reality, they met on a sugar baby website. Gino and Jasmine communicated for nine months before Gino went to Jasmine&#39;s native Panama to meet her for the first time in person on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. They got engaged that season, and Gino filed for the K-1 visa.
Jasmine and Gino appeared on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 while they were waiting for Jamsine&#39;s visa approval and figuring out their relationship. The controversial duo has issues over Jasmine&#39;s temper and jealousy, as well as trust, finances, and Gino&#39;s family. Jasmine and Gino are currently cast members on 90 Day Fiancé season 10, where Jasmine has arrived in America after being granted her K-1 visa. She moved into Gino&#39;s Michigan home as the two prepare for their potential wedding while working through their many problems.









 








 8  Jasmine Manipulates Gino Into Forgiving Her (She&#39;s Begged Him To Take Her Back) 
        

Jasmine uses yelling and screaming as a tactic to manipulate Gino. When that hasn&#39;t worked, she&#39;s resorted to begging and crying for Gino to take her back. After breaking up with Gino on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, Jasmine came to Gino saying she would make a mistake and change. Jasmine seems aware of her toxic traits and manipulates Gino by acknowledging them and promising to change. Her tactics tend to work on Gino, who has faith that Jasmine can control her temper.





 7  Jasmine Said Her Ex Dane Was A Better Lover 


 







Jasmine and Gino had one of their many explosive fights during an interview scene on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Jasmine grew angry when Gino said Jasmine was equal to his family members. Jasmine called him an idiot before telling him that she had sex with her ex, Dane, one month prior and that he was the best sex partner she&#39;d ever had. To further stab him in the heart, Jasmine said they had filmed their sexual encounter.
Jasmine has shown that she will go below the belt to deliver the meanest digs at Gino. Jasmine knows that her sex life with Gino is a major point of contention, so for her to compare Gino to Dane is uncalled for. Furthermore, Jasmine has put the negative inner workings of her and Gino&#39;s sex life on blast and painted the picture of their bad sex life being Gino&#39;s fault.





 6  Jasmine Threw A Fit About The Prenup To Get Her Way 
        

Jasmine was at one of her most furious points when she learned Gino wanted her to sign a prenup before they married. She insulted him verbally and threw an enormous fit to prove how disagreeable she was to Gino&#39;s request. After sitting with Jasmine&#39;s rage, Gino finally relented to Jasmine&#39;s upheaval and said he would drop the prenup idea. It seemed as though Jasmine wanted to teach Gino a lesson about the prenup by insisting that he make a will, leaving her comfortable. Jasmine&#39;s use of anger to get her way is a clear example of how she&#39;s become a monster.





 5  Jasmine Yelled At Gino In Public About His Family 
        

One of the only times Jasmine has received significant pushback from Gino has been when it&#39;s come to his family. Jasmine disliked several of Gino&#39;s closest family members for what she perceived as slights and insults. Additionally, Gino was adamant about not putting Jasmine above his family members in hierarchy before they married, which further upset Jasmine.
The tension over Jasmine&#39;s virulent feelings towards Gino&#39;s family has manifested several times in public situations where Jasmine has embarrassed Gino and talked down to him. During a trip where Jasmine dragged a surprised Gino to a ring shop, she put him on the spot about a new ring and to admit she was more important than his family, and Gino fought back before walking away. In America, Jasmine also yelled at Gino in public about her perception of his family as rude to her.





 4  Jasmine Is Still Talking To Her Ex-Boyfriend Dane (He Helped Pay For Surgery) 
        

Jasmine&#39;s hypocrisy regarding her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Dane, has been extremely apparent. She made it clear to Gino that Dane would always be in her life despite Gino&#39;s hurt and uncomfortable feelings over it. Meanwhile, Jasmine is cutthroat and jealous over Gino talking to any woman under any circumstances. She thinks the rules don&#39;t apply to her.
This season, Jasmine has yet to tell Gino that Dane gifted her $2000 to pay for her BBL surgery. That money from Dane was on top of money she took from Gino that was intended to buy a wedding dress that she actually put into her cosmetic surgery. Jasmine is calculating and keeps pushing to hurt Gino in every way she can.





 3  Jasmine Doesn&#39;t Take Care Of Her Kids In Panama 
        

When 90 Day Fiancé fans first met Jasmine, she explained that one of her two sons lived with her ex, the father. And her other son lived with her mom in the countryside. Meanwhile, Jasmine galavanted in Panama City on Gino&#39;s dime. Only during 90 Day Fiancé season 10 have viewers witnessed Jasmine interact with one of her children. While they seem to have a good relationship, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that Jasmine is not the one taking care of her kids.





 2  Jasmine Was Labeled As Toxic By Statler Riley 
        

Jasmine does not treat people the way she expects to be treated, and she has developed an extremely negative reputation for her behavior. During the Tell All for 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, Jasmine&#39;s fellow cast member Statler Riley labeled Jasmine as toxic within her earshot. Statler thought Gino needed to be protected from Jasmine&#39;s toxicity. Moreover, outside of Statler&#39;s label, Jasmine has proved that she is an unhealthy person to have any relationship with because she never checks herself and is quick to put blame on others.





 1  Jasmine Is Dependent On Gino&#39;s Money 
        

Jasmine has also turned into a 90 Day Fiancé franchise monster because she is reliant on Gino for his money, and she likes to spend it with wild abandon. Jasmine allegedly lost her teaching job after Gino&#39;s ex-sugar baby sent nudes Gino had sent her of Jasmine to her school authority. Jasmine now acts as if Gino owes her everything, and she endlessly harasses him when she doesn&#39;t get the allowance she wants. Gino has footed the bill for her many cosmetic procedures, her K-1 visa, money for her kids, her lavish accommodations, and everything else in Jasmine&#39;s life, but it never seems to be enough for her.
