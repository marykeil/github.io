The Golden Bachelor couple didn’t mind drinking frozen beverages on the cold day as the cameras caught Gerry sipping on a pink drink while Theresa enjoyed her iced coffee concoction. Theresa, 70, wore a brown teddy bear jacket and paired it with a pair of black trousers and heeled booties. Gerry decided to coordinate his outfit with his wife by dressing up in a navy blue fleece jacket on top of a colorful plaid shirt, blue jeans, and a pair of brown sneakers.  Theresa has been showing Gerry around her home state of New Jersey.


 

Theresa’s Instagram posts show her and Gerry visiting the best local spots in her hometown, such as a diner and the Jersey Shore. Their post-wedding outfits show that Gerry and Theresa prefer to wear comfy over glamorous. They’re keeping their clothes low-key and very different from what they were wearing while filming The Golden Bachelor or their wedding. Theresa had a bridal wardrobe malfunction mid-Golden Bachelor wedding ceremony when a strap of her Badgley Mischka gown broke even before she could exchange vows with Gerry. Theresa had chosen a traditional and modern look for herself with the mermaid silhouette of the dress and a plunging neckline.




Theresa and Gerry had announced that they were planning on relocating to Charleston, South Carolina after he proposed to her in the grand finale. However, Gerry has been coming around to the idea of relocating to New Jersey instead. Gerry started liking New Jersey after visiting it a few times. They now had two areas to explore house hunting. Gerry thought it was double the fun. Meanwhile, Gerry and Theresa’s honeymoon plan is a romantic getaway to Italy. Gerry and Theresa had discussed that they should learn Italian together and take a trip to Italy during their first date on The Golden Bachelor.
