# Reacher Keeping This Major Book Element Would Have Fixed A Season 2 Problem


## SUMMARY 



  Reacher season 2 stays loyal to the source material, incorporating elements from Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck &amp; Trouble, such as the back-and-forth between timelines and the portrayal of Reacher&#39;s former team from the 110th Special Investigations Unit.   While the early introduction of Dixon and O&#39;Donnell in the show improves upon the book, other deviations from the original events pose narrative problems.   The shift from a small-town setting in season 1 to the urban landscape of New York in season 2 diminishes the groundedness and realism that made the show compelling, as Reacher&#39;s presence gets overshadowed by the city&#39;s towering skyscrapers. Keeping the original California setting would have been better for raising the stakes and adding more color to the overall tone.

  Reacher season 2 stays loyal to the source material, incorporating elements from Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck &amp; Trouble, such as the back-and-forth between timelines and the portrayal of Reacher&#39;s former team from the 110th Special Investigations Unit.   While the early introduction of Dixon and O&#39;Donnell in the show improves upon the book, other deviations from the original events pose narrative problems.   The shift from a small-town setting in season 1 to the urban landscape of New York in season 2 diminishes the groundedness and realism that made the show compelling, as Reacher&#39;s presence gets overshadowed by the city&#39;s towering skyscrapers. Keeping the original California setting would have been better for raising the stakes and adding more color to the overall tone.  







By including one book element in its storyline, Reacher season 2 could have overcome one of its biggest problems. Based on Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck &amp; Trouble, Reacher season 2 stays loyal to most elements from its source material. For instance, just like the original book, it goes back and forth between Reacher&#39;s present and past timelines to offer new insights into the character&#39;s military background and relationships. Even when it comes to the portrayal of Reacher&#39;s former team members from the 110th Special Investigations Unit, the show avoids taking too many creative liberties.

However, other elements from the show&#39;s season 2 do not align too well with the original book&#39;s events. For instance, while Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck and Trouble takes its time to introduce Dixon and O&#39;Donnell, the show involves them in its story in its early episodes. In many ways, this change makes the show better than the book. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about another major deviation that Reacher season 2 takes from the original Lee Child novel.




                  Reacher Season 2 Is Making Its Main Heroes Very Difficult To Like   With every episode in Amazon&#39;s Reacher season 2, it is becoming hard to like the show&#39;s main heroes, potentially causing major narrative problems.    


 Reacher Season 2&#39;s New York Setting Feels Bland Compared To Margrave 
         

Reacher season 1&#39;s small-town setting worked wonders because it not only added a layer of novelty to the show&#39;s storyline but also provided a refreshing departure from the typical urban settings often portrayed in crime dramas. This allowed Reacher season 1 to create a distinct identity for itself in an overcrowded genre. Since the titular character was initially unaware of the inner workings and intricacies of the close-knit community and law enforcement of Margrave, the town introduced him to a unique set of challenges that served as a canvas for his early character development. Season 2&#39;s New York setting seems to lack these elements.




While Reacher season 2&#39;s New York setting effectively raises the stakes for Reacher and his team by immersing them in a complex, sprawling environment, the show&#39;s sudden shift from a small town setting to the urban landscape of New York kills the groundedness and realism that made season 1 compelling. Reacher season 1&#39;s relatively smaller setting also played a crucial role in highlighting how the titular character stood out because of his massive stature and aggressive crime-solving methods. His actions seemingly had direct implications in season 1, and everyone in the town noticed his presence. In season 2, however, a sense of anonymity looms over him and his team because, despite his massive stature, he gets overshadowed by the city&#39;s towering skyscrapers and other urban landscapes.



 Reacher Keeping Bad Luck &amp; Trouble&#39;s California Location Would Have Been Better 
          




Reacher season 2 adapts Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck and Trouble, which primarily unfolds in California. Although Alan Ritchson has explained (via Cinema Blend) that they changed the setting because of &#34;tax credits and the currency exchange,&#34; the show&#39;s storyline could have benefitted from the original setting. Compared to Margrave, California, too, is a relatively bigger setting, which would have effectively raised the stakes for Reacher and his team. At the same time, California is also more grounded and less clichÃ© than New York because of its geographical diversity and slower pace of life. This could have added more color to Reacher season 2&#39;s overall tone without making the titular character&#39;s brawn and intimidating demeanor less noticeable.
