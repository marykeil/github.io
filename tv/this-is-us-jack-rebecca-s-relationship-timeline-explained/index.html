  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Jack and Rebecca&rsquo;s love story was one of the best parts of &ldquo;This Is Us,&rdquo; and their chemistry was evident from the moment they met at a dive bar in 1972.   Despite facing challenges, including Jack&rsquo;s insecurity about his lack of wealth, their love for each other prevailed, and they married and had three children.   Tragically, Jack died in a house fire in 1998, but even in death, their love story continued as they reunited in the afterlife.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Jack and Rebecca Pearson&rsquo;s relationship in This Is Us is one of the best TV romances of all time – read on for a timeline of their life together.</p>
<p>Most agree that This Is Us was one of the most heartfelt and heartbreaking series on television, and Jack and Rebecca Pearson&rsquo;s epic love story certainly had its ups and downs over the course of the show&rsquo;s timeline. The NBC drama series, created by Dan Fogelman, was an immediate hit following its premiere in 2016. Critics and audiences applauded the show for its rich storytelling, pathos, complex characters, and relatable relationship dynamics. Sadly, viewers learned early on that Jack was dead in the present. But thanks to the series&rsquo; tendency to jump around between timelines, Jack (and his relationship with Rebecca) was still at the forefront of the story.</p>
<p>Milo Ventimiglia as Jack and Mandy Moore as Rebecca created a beautiful television romance that constantly tugged at the audience&rsquo;s heartstrings with their chemistry and impressive talent, which garnered both stars Emmy nominations. Jack and Rebecca were the main couple in This Is Us, seeing as their love story spanned numerous decades (even after Jack died) throughout all six seasons. As a result, Jack and Rebecca&rsquo;s relationship was undoubtedly one of the best parts of the show, even if it was not told in chronological order.</p>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca Meet At A Dive Bar
This Is Us season 1, episode 18</p>
<p>The audience didn&rsquo;t see how Jack and Rebecca met until This Is Us season 1, episode 18, but it was worth the wait. On December 23, 1972, both characters were set up on blind dates by their friends, but they ditched their dates and wound up at a dive bar called Ray&rsquo;s Tavern. Rebecca sang Cat Stevens&rsquo; &ldquo;Moonshadow&rdquo; on the stage since it was open mic night, and Jack was captivated by her. As they locked eyes, it seemed as though it was love at first sight.</p>
<pre><code>              This Is Us Cast: Where Are They Now?   The main cast of This Is Us has said goodbye to the series' characters and has since moved on to other various projects.     
</code></pre>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca&rsquo;s First Date
This Is Us season 3, episode 1</p>
<p>Jack took Rebecca out on their first date on the night they meet at that dive bar, as depicted in This Is Us season 3, episode 1. Unfortunately, the date was a bit of a disaster, but it ended on a positive note. Jack only had nine dollars, so there was only so much that he and Rebecca could do, and he took her to a carnival.</p>
<p>But since Jack was ashamed of his lack of wealth (compared to Rebecca, whose family was rich), the night didn&rsquo;t work out how they initially wanted it to. For example, Jack couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy an umbrella after it started raining, which embarrassed him. Rebecca didn&rsquo;t care, though, because of &ldquo;the way that he looks at her,&rdquo; and they shared their first kiss.</p>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca Take A Road Trip To Los Angeles
This Is Us season 3, episode 7</p>
<p>Following their first date, Rebecca almost moved to New York City with her high school boyfriend Alan after he randomly showed up on her doorstep in This Is Us season 3, episode 3. However, Rebecca&rsquo;s feelings for Jack were too strong. She returned to Jack and suggested they go on a road trip to Los Angeles (which was seen in season 3, episode 7).</p>
<p>There, Rebecca had an audition at a recording studio, and the executives called her &ldquo;Pittsburgh good&rdquo; and turned her down. Meanwhile, Jack visited the parents of one of the men he served in Vietnam with, who died in action. Jack felt responsible, but the parents reassured him he had nothing to feel guilty about. Afterward, Jack asked Rebecca to sing for him in the car, which brought him to tears (the first time he cried in front of her). Then, they drove back home to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Jack Breaks Up With Rebecca
This Is Us season 4, episode 10</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Jack was embarrassed about his lack of wealth while dating Rebecca, who came from money. In This Is Us season 4, episode 10, Jack broke up with Rebecca after her father, Dave, expressed his disapproval of their relationship. Jack thought Rebecca deserved better, but, of course, she thought otherwise.</p>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca Say &lsquo;I Love You&rsquo; For The First Time
This Is Us season 4, episode 10</p>
<p>Thankfully, Jack and Rebecca&rsquo;s break-up didn&rsquo;t last very long. Toward the end of This Is Us season 4, episode 10, Rebecca showed up at Jack&rsquo;s place of work and professed her love for him. She explained how she didn&rsquo;t care about money or his job and reassured him that he was good enough for her. Jack told Rebecca he loved her, too, and they officially got back together.</p>
<pre><code>              10 This Is Us Moments That Made Fans Cry   This Is Us has a reputation for delivering exceptionally emotional storytelling, and some scenes are almost guaranteed to make viewers cry.    
</code></pre>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca Get Married
This Is Us season 1, episode 14</p>
<p>Sadly, This Is Us never showed Jack&rsquo;s proposal to Rebecca (season 5, episode 12, featured Miguel helping Jack set up for the proposal, though). However, the NBC drama television series included a few looks at the couple&rsquo;s wedding (which took place on May 16, 1976) in This Is Us season 1, episode 14. Viewers saw Jack and Rebecca burst out of the courthouse shortly after getting married as they celebrated this monumental next step in their love story.</p>
<p>Rebecca Gives Birth
This Is Us season 1, episode 1</p>
<p>Rebecca unexpectedly got pregnant after she and Jack had sex in the bathroom at a bar on January 20, 1980, aka when the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl (as depicted in This Is Us season 1, episode 5). The surprises kept on coming when the doctor informed the couple that they were expecting triplets in season 1, episode 11. As a result, Jack and Rebecca bought their first house to prepare for their children.</p>
<p>The Big Three&rsquo;s birth was shown in the This Is Us pilot when Rebecca went into labor on Jack&rsquo;s birthday — August 31, 1980. Unfortunately, there were complications, and Dr. K was only able to save two of the three babies (and Rebecca). Kevin and Kate were the surviving infants, while Kyle died during the birth. Randall was born that same day and left at a fire station. The firefighters took Randall to the hospital, where Jack spotted him next to Kevin and Kate in the nursery. Jack convinced Rebecca to adopt Randall, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Rebecca Kicks Jack Out
This Is Us season 1, episode 18</p>
<p>This Is Us season 1, episode 18, featured Jack and Rebecca&rsquo;s first meeting, but it also depicted the big fight they had 25 years later in 1997. At this point in their love story, the Big Three were teenagers, and Jack&rsquo;s drinking was getting out of control. He got drunk and drove to Rebecca&rsquo;s show, where her ex-boyfriend tried to kiss her, so he punched him. Back at their house, Jack and Rebecca got into an explosive fight, resulting in him leaving to stay at Miguel&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca Reconcile
This Is Us season 2, episode 1</p>
<p>Shortly after kicking Jack out of the house, Rebecca decided it was a mistake and asked her husband to return home in This Is Us season 2, episode 1. However, Jack, who was drunk at the moment, admitted that he was an alcoholic and needed help but had to do it on his own. Rebecca refused to let that happen and forced Jack to return to their house, where they would work on his problem together.</p>
<p>Jack Dies
This Is Us season 2, episode 14</p>
<p>This Is Us season 2, episode 14 (one of the saddest episodes of the NBC drama series) finally explained to viewers how Jack died. The Pearsons&rsquo; home caught fire due to a faulty slow cooker on January 26, 1998. Jack got everyone out of the house in time — Kevin wasn&rsquo;t home — and he was seemingly okay. However, the paramedics wanted to take Jack to the hospital for smoke inhalation and to treat some of his burns. Rebecca went with him, and the horrible night turned even more devastating when Jack suddenly went into cardiac arrest and died.</p>
<p>Rebecca wasn&rsquo;t in the room when it happened, as she was making a few calls and getting snacks from the vending machine. The doctor approached her and explained what had happened, but Rebecca refused to believe him. She made her way to Jack&rsquo;s hospital room, where she saw her husband&rsquo;s dead body lying on the bed. Mandy Moore then gave the performance of her life as she reacted to the revelation that Jack had died, and the image of her breaking down was one that the audience wouldn&rsquo;t forget.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Jack &amp; Rebecca Reunite In The Afterlife
This Is Us season 6, episodes 17 &amp; 18</p>
<p>Even though Jack died in 1998 and Rebecca didn&rsquo;t die until 2033, their love story didn&rsquo;t end there. While on her deathbed in This Is Us season 6, episode 17, Rebecca&rsquo;s consciousness manifested on a train, where she looked back on important moments in her life and interacted with a few significant characters. Rebecca eventually made her way to the caboose, and when she died in real life, she was finally able to enter the room where Jack was waiting for her.</p>
<p>The series finale showed more of Jack and Rebecca&rsquo;s reunion in the afterlife. Rebecca expressed she was scared and didn&rsquo;t want to leave Kevin, Kate, and Randall, but Jack reassured her that she would always be with them. The final words in This Is Us were Jack and Rebecca saying &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to each other, and there was no better way to end the show.</p>
<p>This Is Us is available to stream on Netflix and Hulu.</p>
