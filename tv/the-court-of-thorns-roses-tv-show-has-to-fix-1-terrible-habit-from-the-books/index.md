# The Court Of Thorns &amp; Roses TV Show Has To Fix 1 Terrible Habit From The Books


## SUMMARY 



  The ACOTAR TV show needs to address the issue of supporting characters disappearing for long periods of time in the books.   This habit of characters going on lengthy quests lessens the impact of their storylines and can be improved in the adaptation.   The TV format allows for multiple perspectives, so the show can give more screen time to characters who are physically distant from the main protagonists.

## Literature Review
Hulu’s A Court of Thorns and Roses will bring Sarah J. Maas’ characters to the screen, but it must fix one terrible habit from the best-selling books.




Hulu&#39;s A Court of Thorns &amp; Roses TV show must capture the greatest moments from Sarah J. Maas&#39; best-selling books, but the series also needs to fix one terrible habit from the source material. Given the popularity of Maas&#39; ACOTAR series, there&#39;s little doubt its TV adaptation will ensnare longtime fans and newcomers alike. That&#39;s especially true because A Court of Thorns and Roses will fill a gap in the fantasy market by prioritizing romance in its storytelling.




The compelling cast of characters will make the romances in A Court of Thorns and Roses&#39; TV adaptation appealing, but the series needs to alter Maas&#39; approach to the books&#39; supporting players. While Feyre is a reliable perspective throughout the source material, the people around her are less consistent. That&#39;s something Hulu&#39;s adaptation will need to change. Fortunately, there are simple ways to go about that.

                  A Court Of Thorns And Roses: Everything We Know   A Court Of Thorns And Roses news is starting to come in as the bestselling fantasy novel series is coming to Hulu. Here is what you need to know.    


 Characters Disappear From The ACOTAR Books For Stretches At A Time 
        Lucien Vanserra - A Court of Thorns and Roses by Dominique Wesson    

Although A Court of Thorns and Roses has an intriguing cast of characters, many of them disappear from the story for long stretches of time. Maas has a habit of sending her characters off on lengthy quests when she&#39;s unsure what to do with them, which means that Feyre&#39;s allies and enemies appear fairly infrequently. Sometimes, ACOTAR&#39;s supporting players will be gone for multiple chapters, and other times, they won&#39;t appear for an entire book. Feyre and Rhysand are constants throughout the series, but everyone else gets less page time. That won&#39;t translate well on-screen.




A prime example of this unfortunate ACOTAR tendency happens with Feyre&#39;s father, Mr. Archeron, who&#39;s away on a trip for most of A Court of Mist and Fury. His reunion with his daughters feels less powerful as a result of him being gone for the entire second book, leaving little time to get to know him. Feyre&#39;s friend-turned-enemy Lucien also has an underwhelming character arc, playing a prominent role in the first ACOTAR book, then sticking to the sidelines for the latter installments. Even Rhysand&#39;s inner circle — dubbed the Night Court — is around sporadically. This is something that will need to change in the TV show.

Hulu&#39;s A Court of Thorns and Roses can fix Maas&#39; terrible character habit by fleshing out the journeys the characters embark on — or eliminating them altogether. It&#39;s easier to convey multiple perspectives in a TV format, so characters who aren&#39;t physically near Feyre and Rhysand can still get plenty of screen time while they&#39;re traveling. This would give meaning to their quests from the books and enable viewers to invest in their storylines more deeply. Alternatively, Hulu&#39;s A Court of Thorns and Roses show could find ways to keep supporting characters around for longer periods of time. Either way, it needs to strike the right balance to win viewers over.
