According to Food Network, Ebie is a pop singer from Los Angeles, California, who&#39;s used to living a rockstar lifestyle. She&#39;s the late iconic rapper Eazy-E&#39;s daughter, so she grew up eating in five-star restaurants.

Ebie&#39;s dad, Eazy-E, is often referred to as the &#34;Godfather of Gangsta Rap.&#34; He led the group N.W.A., and they were nominated for a Grammy Award.






 Jesse Money Is The Late Singer-Songwriter Eddie Money’s Daughter 

 

Jesse&#39;s Food Network bio shares that she&#39;s the daughter of the late singer and songwriter Eddie Money. She grew up with a rockstar lifestyle, and became accustomed to staying in five-star hotels and eating in fancy restaurants when she was on the road with Eddie and her family. Jesse is now a music artist who loves to be on stage. On Worst Cooks in America, her goal is to learn to perform in the kitchen. Her father,Eddie, loved food, so Jesse wants to honor him by recreating some of his favorite dishes. Eddie was a Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter, who had eleven Top 40 songs in the 1970s and 1980s.

Although Ebie and Jesse grew up with pampered lives with their famous fathers, they&#39;re now ready to learn how to cook meals for themselves. Jesse is a member of Anne&#39;s Red team, while Ebie is on Tiffany&#39;s Blue team, so, if they remain on these teams throughout the season, it&#39;s possible that they could compete against each other in the Worst Cooks in America season 27 finale.
