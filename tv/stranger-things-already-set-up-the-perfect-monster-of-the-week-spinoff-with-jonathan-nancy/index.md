# Stranger Things Already Set Up The Perfect Monster-Of-The-Week Spinoff With Jonathan &amp; Nancy


## SUMMARY 



  Stranger Things could potentially have spinoffs featuring Jonathan and Nancy, given their existing story and chemistry.   The show&#39;s large cast and popularity make spinoffs a logical next step, as the final season may not wrap up all storylines.   Shows like Supernatural and Buffy have successfully executed similar spinoffs, proving the potential success of a Jonathan and Nancy-focused Stranger Things show.

## Literature Review
Little is known about the upcoming Stranger Things spinoff, but a monster-of-the-week series starring Jonathan and Nancy could work perfectly.




While it’s not clear which Stranger Things characters the show’s forthcoming follow-up will center on, Jonathan and Nancy’s existing story sets up a perfect monster-of-the-week serial spinoff. The news that Stranger Things will spawn spinoffs isn’t particularly surprising given the show’s huge fan base and its massive, sprawling cast. Stranger Things has over a dozen main characters spread across three generations, and that’s not even including major supporting stars like Dacre Montgomery’s Billy or Joseph Quinn’s Eddie. It makes perfect sense for the series to continue their stories in spinoffs, especially when the show’s final season is unlikely to wrap up every plot perfectly.




The upcoming Stranger Things season 5 will likely center on Eleven’s final face-off with Vecna, but the outing will also need to find time to focus on her relationship with Mike. This love story shaped the first seasons of Stranger Things but was sidelined in season 4 as the series shifted focus to Sadie Sink’s Max. On the subject of Max, her recovery will also be central to the story of season 5, as will the burgeoning romance between Joyce and Hopper. As if this weren’t enough, Stranger Things also needs to give Dustin, Lucas, and Will central roles in the action and find a purpose for Robin and Erica.


 Stranger Things Set Up A Perfect Monster-Of-The-Week Spinoff With Jonathan &amp; Nancy 
          

With all of these main characters and supporting stars to consider, it is not a major surprise that Stranger Things season 4 effectively forgot about Jonathan and Nancy’s relationship. Jonathan and Nancy had a shaky start in season 1, but they became a pair of successful muckrakers and monster hunters in seasons 2 and 3. However, Stranger Things wasted Jonathan in season 4 as Will’s brother spent the outing getting high and avoiding thinking about his future with Nancy. To ameliorate this mistake, Stranger Things season 5 could set up a spinoff that focuses on Jonathan and Nancy investigating various mysteries together.




A monster-of-the-week Stranger Things sequel with Nancy and Jonathan in the lead could be fun, and their existing newspaper careers would make it easier for the spinoff to ground this idea. Jonathan and Nancy are among the more proactive members of the cast, with both of them actively seeking the Mind Flayer and the truth about Hawkins Lab in seasons 3 and 2 respectively. Where the adults and kids of Stranger Things are usually thrust into paranormal happenings unwillingly, Jonathan and Nancy intentionally root out conspiracies and cover-ups. This would make them a perfect pair of lead characters for the show’s spinoff, and their chemistry doesn’t hurt either.



 Shows Like Supernatural &amp; Buffy Prove This Type Of Stranger Things Spinoff Can Work 
          

Supernatural got 15 seasons and a spinoff out of the story of two brothers hunting demons on the open road, while Buffy the Vampire Slayer launched an entire sub-genre with its story of a plucky teen taking on monsters. However, the upcoming reboot of The X-Files is maybe the most obvious evidence that a Stranger Things spinoff starring Jonathan and Nancy could succeed. The ‘90s series became a beloved cultural touchstone thanks to the romantic chemistry between its central pairing, the shadowy conspiracy that lay under all their adventures, and the memorably gross monsters they encountered. Jonathan and Nancy’s potential Stranger Things spinoff already shares all these ingredients.
