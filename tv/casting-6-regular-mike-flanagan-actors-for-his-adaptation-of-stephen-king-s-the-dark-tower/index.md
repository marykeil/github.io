## Literature Review

Mike Flanagan&#39;s adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s Dark Tower book series could fill out its entire cast with actors he&#39;s already worked with. 




Mike Flanagan is perhaps the single most accomplished and adept Stephen King adapter ever, and his cast of regular collaborators present some interesting opportunities to cast his latest project, The Dark Tower. The beloved book series had been partially adapted before as a woefully underwhelming film, 2017&#39;s The Dark Tower, but Flanagan&#39;s track record with King&#39;s properties promises a more faithful version of the story. The episodic format will also be more fitting of the seven-book series, giving more time for characters to develop.
Already, actress Carla Guigino has teased involvement in The Dark Tower, a recurring performer in many of Flanagan&#39;s works, including his best King adaptations. While what role she could play isn&#39;t made immediately clear, looking at the major characters in the series, her involvement creates an interesting opportunity for Flanagan to fashion the cast of his newest series from a roster of familiar faces. Many actors and actresses Flanagan has worked with before would lend themselves excellently to playing some of the book series&#39; core characters.









 








 6  Bruce Greenwood 
as Father Callahan
        

A relatively minor character in The Dark Tower series, Father Callahan doesn&#39;t show up until the fifth book, Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla. However, the character showed up earlier in King&#39;s work, bin the novel Salem&#39;s Lot, the events of which carrying over into the Dark Tower universe. A weary vampire-hunting priest, Father Callahan&#39;s battles with neo-Nazi vampires on the streets of New York City and cybernetic wolves in the eponymous town of Calla eventually has him cross paths with Roland Deschain.
The oldest of Mike Flanagan&#39;s frequently-cast actors, Bruce Greenwood has decades of acting experience under his belt, getting his start in the medical drama St. Elsewhere in the early 80s. Greenwood has encountered vampires in Flanagan&#39;s works before, playing Dr. John Dalton in 2019&#39;s Doctor Sleep. His seasoned acting ability and previous experience with the more bizarre, supernatural creatures of the night that appear in King&#39;s work would make him an excellent Father Callahan, channeling the weary character&#39;s desperate resolve in the face of terrifying threats.





 5  Crystal Balint 
as Susannah Dean
        

The second addition to Roland&#39;s ka-tet, his party of fate-bound companions, Susannah Dean is a time-displaced woman who doesn&#39;t let her inability to walk get in the way of her sharpshooting or invaluable toughness. Originally the daughter of a well-to-do Black family in 1930s New York, Susannah Dean was targeted twice by the deranged killer Jack Mort, who is responsible for causing the accident that created her split personalities of Odetta Holmes and Detta Walker. After Mort struck again, costing Odetta the use of her legs, she is pulled into Roland&#39;s world, consoling her identities as Susannah Dean.
A Canadian actress who has already starred in 3 of Flanagan&#39;s series, Crystal Balint has the range to capture Susannah&#39;s gulf of personality, from the meek, timid Odetta Holmes to the chaotic, cruel Detta Walker. But most of all, Balint&#39;s stately sense of calm and ability to convey the assuredness of the reformed Susannah will do wonders for Flanagan&#39;s adaptation of the series. It helps that her character in Midnight Mass was a faithful devotee of the church -- While Susannah is no zealot, she trusts Roland and his faith in &#34;ka&#34; far more than the cynical Eddie.





 4  Igby Rigney 
as Jake Chambers
        

A crux of Roland&#39;s story, Jake Chambers is one of the most important characters in The Dark Tower&#39;s mythos. Originally meeting Roland in the first book, the gunslinger regretfully sacrifices his life in order to fervently pursue his quest for The Man In Black, and, by extension, the Tower. Roland gets the chance to correct this mistake in the third book, when Jake Chambers is revealed to have had a double life living as a normal student in modern-day New York City, before making the choice to return to Mid-World and reunite with Roland and his ka-tet.
By far the youngest of Mike Flanagan&#39;s recurring cast members, Igby Rigney&#39;s ability to channel optimism in the face of dire circumstances, most notably one of the terminally ill teens living in Brightcliffe Hospice in The Midnight Club would suit Jake nicely. Though the character would likely need to be slightly aged up for the 20-year-old Rigney to play him, the actor&#39;s boyish looks are still well within the realm of capability to believably play a teenaged Jake. His experience with characters that keep secrets, such as in the drama Joe Bell, would also go hand-in-hand with adapting Jake&#39;s arc.





 3  Michael Trucco 
as Randall Flagg
        

The overarching antagonist of The Dark Tower Series, Randall Flagg goes by many names -- Whether Walter O&#39;Dim, Marten Broadcloak, or simply &#34;The Man in Black&#34;, Flagg is one of the most dangerous men to ever feature in Stephen King&#39;s work. Appearing in multiple of the famed writer&#39;s books both before and since The Dark Tower, King credits Randall Flagg as the best villain he&#39;s ever created. A charismatic manipulator, powerful sorcerer, and death-defying enigmatic drifter, the casting of Randall Flagg could very well make or break the series adaptation.
Luckily, Flanagan already has ties to an actor whose looks and charisma would lend themselves excellently to bringing Randall Flagg to life. Michael Trucco has already worked with Flanagan in four other projects, frequently playing someone in a position of power, such as a CEO in The Fall of the House of Usher and the mayor of Crockett Island in Midnight Mass. Trucco has demonstrated the ability to convey a smooth talker who can utilize his lofty position if need be, perfect for the upcoming Dark Tower series&#39; Man in Black.





 2  Zach Gilford 
as Eddie Dean
        

The first member of Roland&#39;s ka-tet, Eddie Dean is a wise-cracking low-level criminal from the streets of New York who finds himself swept up in Roland&#39;s mad dash for the Tower and the center of all things when the gunslinger reaches into his world. An incredulous cynic and voice of comic relief throughout the bizarre events of the books, Eddie Dean is the entertaining everyman of The Dark Tower. His struggles with drug addiction, love for his brother, and romance with Susannah also make him a powerful emotional foil to Roland&#39;s zealous quest.
Having worked with Flanagan three times already, Zach Gilford would be perfect for Eddie Dean. Considering how central of a character Eddie Dean is, it would be wise to utilizie Gilford&#39;s experience carrying one of Flanagan&#39;s series, Midnight Mass, as protagonist Riley Flynn. As Riley Flynn, Gilford was able to portray a realistic and haunting battle with alcoholism and guilt that would serve as great experience to utilize in depicting Eddie Dean&#39;s struggles with the death of his brother and his own addictive vices.





 1  Matt Biedel 
as Roland Deschain


 







The central protagonist of The Dark Tower series, Roland Deschain is the iconic drifter drives the events of the series, and is half the reason for its popularity. A confident, cool gunslinger styled after an Old West cowboy, there are few practical problems Roland can&#39;t solve with his skill, toughness, or inspiring commitment to his beliefs in Ka, the series&#39; name for the driving force of fate. Casting Roland will be one of the most crucial elements for Flanagan&#39;s Dark Tower adaptation to get right.
Matt Biedel has made three appearances in Flanagan&#39;s works already, and would make an excellent Roland for a multitude of reasons. First and foremost, Biedel could nail the look of Roland, with a wiry but muscular build and piercing blue eyes that emulate his description from the books. His work as an antagonist in Midnight Mass could help channel Roland&#39;s darker side, and his ultimate willingness to forsake his companions for the sake of his quest. Finally, Biedel excellently played a lawman in the critically-acclaimed Narcos, giving him perfect experience for Flanagan&#39;s gunslinger.
