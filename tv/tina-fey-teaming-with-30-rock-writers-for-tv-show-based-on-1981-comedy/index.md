## Literature Review
Tina Fey reteams with 30 Rock writers for a new Netflix TV show based on a little-known 1981 comedy starring Alan Alda and Carol Burnett.




Tina Fey teams with a pair 30 Rock writers for a new Netflix TV show based on a 1981 comedy movie. Fey’s 30 Rock run lasted from 2006 to 2013 on NBC, and since then the star has forged a strong relationship with Netflix, producing The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt for the streamer, as well as the series Girls5eva, which began on Peacock before switching homes. Fey has also guest starred on the Netflix show Great News, produced by one-time 30 Rock writer Tracey Wigfield.




Fey’s relationship with Netflix is now reportedly getting even stronger, as the streamer has put in an 8-episode order on the Mean Girls star’s new comedy show The Four Seasons, which is based on a 1981 movie of the same name (via Deadline). The aforementioned Wigfield joins Fey on the project, along with fellow 30 Rock writer Lang Fisher. The show is set to begin shooting later this year.


 Will Tina Fey Bring Jon Hamm Or Alec Baldwin On For The Four Seasons 
          

The original 1981 movie The Four Seasons starred legends Alan Alda and Carol Burnett in a lightweight romantic-comedy about a group of middle-aged friends whose seasonal vacation tradition is disrupted when one of them splits from his wife and begins seeing a much younger woman. Directed by Alda himself, the film was a good-sized hit, grossing $51 million at the box office, and was critically well-regarded, as reflected in its 76% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.






The Four Seasons marks Tina Fey’s first small-screen starring role since 30 Rock went off the air.




The premise of The Four Seasons not only offers an opportunity for Fey to dive back into the TV comedy game, it also sets up the possibility of a great ensemble cast. It remains to be seen who will join Fey in that cast, but frequent Fey collaborator Jon Hamm would seem perfect for the role played in the original by Alda. It might be a long-shot for Fey to also be joined by her former 30 Rock co-star Alec Baldwin, given all the controversy currently swirling around the Rust actor, but if Fey should want to lend Baldwin a helping hand in getting his career going again, he might also be a good fit for the new show.
