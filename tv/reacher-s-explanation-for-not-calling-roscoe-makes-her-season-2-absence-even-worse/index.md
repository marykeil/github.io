# Reacher s Explanation For Not Calling Roscoe Makes Her Season 2 Absence Even Worse


## SUMMARY 



  Reacher claims that he can&#39;t involve Roscoe in season 2&#39;s investigation because the villains may already know about her.   If this is true, contacting her would surely be the right thing to do.   The possibility of a romantic connection with Dixon may be influencing Reacher&#39;s decision to avoid contacting Roscoe.

## Literature Review
Willa Fitzgerald&#39;s Roscoe has not appeared in Reacher season 2, and the show&#39;s explanation for this makes her absence even more perplexing.




Reacher season 2 finally offers a tangible explanation for Roscoe&#39;s absence, but this paper-thin reasoning actually makes the situation even harder to understand. Since Reacher&#39;s title character is a self-styled hobo that deliberately avoids making permanent ties to people and places, Willa Fitzgerald&#39;s Roscoe was not expected to appear in season 2 - especially since she also doesn&#39;t return in Lee Child&#39;s books. Nevertheless, Amazon&#39;s adaptation dropped hints that Roscoe might join the Reacher season 2 cast, if only for a cameo. Firstly, Reacher season 1 ended with Roscoe giving Reacher her phone number. Secondly, Finlay&#39;s season 2 cameo already proved Reacher is willing to call upon his allies from Margrave.




Reacher barely acknowledged Roscoe&#39;s existence during season 2&#39;s first six episodes, almost going out of its way to avoid giving her a mention. Reacher season 2, episode 7, &#34;The Man Goes Through&#34; finally references Roscoe by name, but then goes further by actually offering an explanation for her absence. Discussing potential places to hide Marlo Burns and her daughter, Reacher decides against sending them to Roscoe because Senator Lavoy had already drawn the connection between Reacher and Margrave. According to Reacher, that means his enemies could make the same deduction, so even Roscoe cannot keep the witnesses safe.

                  Reacher Season 3: Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Prime Video&#39;s Reacher is coming back for a third season, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the upcoming episodes.     


 Reacher&#39;s Excuse For Not Calling Roscoe In Season 2 Doesn&#39;t Hold Up 
          




On the surface, Reacher&#39;s logic for not calling Roscoe makes sense. Shane Langston and AM are powerful, well-connected enemies. With a little digging, they certainly could attach Reacher to the Margrave incident and identify Roscoe and Finlay as potential allies. For this reason, sending Marlo and Jane to stay with Roscoe would indeed be foolish. By making this argument, however, Reacher is effectively admitting that his battle against Langston and AM has put Roscoe in danger already.

Reacher is acknowledging the possibility that Langston&#39;s goons could visit Margrave in their efforts to track down Marlo and Jane, and may have even identified Roscoe as a potential target. Regardless of whether Reacher actually involves her, therefore, Roscoe is in danger. Willa Fitzgerald&#39;s character is capable of handling herself, but the very least Reacher can do is give her a heads-up that trouble may be coming.

Since her safety is already compromised, it would arguably make more sense for Reacher to bring Roscoe in as an ally, just like he did with Finlay several episodes prior. The heroes need extra firepower, and Roscoe would be safer with the 110th Special Investigators than by herself in Margrave. Reacher&#39;s own argument for not seeking Roscoe&#39;s help with hiding Marlo and Jane is the exact reason he should be frantically searching for that old Clark Bar wrapper.






 Season 2 Has Teased Reacher&#39;s Ulterior Motive For Not Calling Roscoe 
          

Various clues in Reacher season 2 point towards Ritchson&#39;s character having a more personal motivation for not calling Roscoe: his blossoming romance with Dixon. Very quickly after reuniting, Reacher and Dixon rekindled an unfulfilled romance from their days in the 110th. It was shortly after his first night with Dixon that Reacher involved Finlay in season 2&#39;s investigation, despite Roscoe being the more natural choice. When Reacher was last in Margrave, Finlay was teasing retirement and Roscoe was an active cop. If Reacher needed someone to stage a drugs bust, therefore, Roscoe was the obvious option.

Then, in Reacher season 2, episode 7, the protagonist is visibly annoyed when Neagley mentions Roscoe in Dixon&#39;s presence, brushing off Dixon&#39;s inevitable questions by describing Roscoe as just a &#34;friend.&#34; These examples suggest Reacher has deliberately found reasons to avoid contacting Roscoe because he wants to side-step any awkwardness between past and present love interests. Whatever tactical arguments he might make to justify Roscoe&#39;s omission, Reacher&#39;s emotions appear to be directing his decision-making more than he&#39;d admit.






Reacher season 2 concludes Friday on Prime Video.
