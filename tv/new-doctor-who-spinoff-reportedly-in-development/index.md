## Literature Review
A new production listing hints at Doctor Who&#39;s first major spin-off in Russell T Davies&#39; second tenure as showrunner, and it teases familiar foes.




A new production listing may have potentially confirmed a new Doctor Who spin-off will soon enter production. Last year, Russell T Davies returned and reunited with stars David Tennant and Catherine Tate for a three-part 60th-anniversary celebration before helming Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor adventures. The showrunner previously opened up about his ambitious shared universe plans for the franchise that could rival the Marvel Cinematic Universe in scope.




With Doctor Who season 14 preparing for its premiere in May 2024, a new listing on ProductionList.com may have revealed a new spin-off. Titled The War Between The Land and Sea, the series is rumored to focus on the 70s foes, the Sea Devils, and matches previous teases about a project with an eight-letter title from Davies&#39; monthly Doctor Who Magazine column. The listing details the involvement of current showrunner and producers Phil Collinson, Julie Gardner, Jane Tranter, and Vic Delow. While production on season 15 is currently ongoing, the spin-off is reported to begin filming in Cardiff, Wales, in March 2024.


 What Could A Sea Devil&#39;s Doctor Who Spin-Off Be About? 
          

Debuting in 1972&#39;s &#34;The Sea Devils&#34; during Jon Pertwee&#39;s Doctor Who tenure, the Sea Devils were created by Malcolm Hulke and were an amphibious race who once ruled the Earth long before Humanity came to be, much like their cousins, the Silurians. In each of their appearances across the show&#39;s television history, hibernating colonies across the globe have awoken and attempted to reclaim the planet from humanity via various methods, including cold war espionage and flooding. The Sea Devils made their revived series debut in Jodie Whittaker&#39;s penultimate Thirteenth Doctor adventure, &#34;Legend of the Sea Devils,&#34; in 2022, battling legendary pirates in 1807 China.




While it is currently unknown whom the Sea Devils may be battling in The War Between The Land and Sea, it is possible that the sci-fi show could see UNIT take a stand against the classic Doctor Who foes. UNIT had already faced the Silurians in various stories, and it had been previously rumored that the organization led by Jemma Redgrave&#39;s Kate Stewart would be the focus of its own spin-off while making multiple appearances across Gatwa&#39;s upcoming adventures. As such, the titular war of the Sea Devil&#39;s spin-off could see UNIT left to handle a newly awakened Sea Devil colony, torn between taking a stand or coming to an understanding in hopes of averting another unfortunate chapter in the conflict over who controls the planet.

                  Doctor Who Reveals What Happened To 9 Companions After Leaving The TARDIS   These nine Doctor Who companions return to share the events of their lives with one another in the brand-new spinoff Tales of the TARDIS.    

Doctor Who&#39;s new era has already seen one spin-off debut with Tales of the TARDIS, but The War Between The Land and Sea could represent a major step in Davies&#39; masterplan. While Tales of the TARDIS&#39;s iPlayer exclusivity kept it limited to UK viewers, the Sea Devils-centric spin-off could debut on Disney&#43; due to the company&#39;s involvement in hosting the franchise internationally and providing additional funding. With Davies having previously been open about the main series&#39; productions, it may not be long before Doctor Who&#39;s next spin-off receives an official reveal.






Doctor Who&#39;s 2023 specials are available on Disney&#43; for international audiences and BBC iPlayer for UK viewers. Doctor Who season 14 is set to air in May 2024.
