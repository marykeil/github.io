## Literature Review
Tulsa King is returning with a second season on Paramount&#43;. These are the things fans want to happen in Taylor Sheridan&#39;s cowboy mafia drama. 




Taylor Sheridan&#39;s Tulsa King has been confirmed for season 2, and there are several things fans want to see when the mobster-meets-cowboy drama returns to Paramount&#43;. The surprise hit for the streaming platform finds Sylvester Stallone&#39;s Dwight Manfredi, a capo for the mob in New York City, finally getting out of jail after serving 25 years for taking the fall for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. Unfortunately, his loyalty isn&#39;t rewarded, and he&#39;s exiled to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where the family doesn&#39;t expect him to create his own misfit crew from scratch and challenge their supremacy.
Tulsa King&#39;s season 1 ending saw Dwight&#39;s operation get attacked by a local biker gang and the FBI close in, ultimately leading to a cliffhanger ending that leaves his future uncertain. Lots of storylines and plot threads have been left dangling, including what will happen to his newly minted crew, his taboo relationship with an FBI agent, and of course, the now even-more-fractured relationship with his daughter, whose life was traumatized by his criminal lifestyle. There are some big questions Tulsa King season 2 needs to answer when it returns in late 2024.









 








 8  Dwight Gets Bailed Out 
Everything Was Looking Up Before He Got Arrested


 







In the Tulsa King season 1 finale, Dwight gets arrested for bribery while celebrating at Mitch&#39;s roadhouse with his crew, and the episode ends on a cliffhanger. His daughter and friends have to watch helplessly as he gets put into a squad car after being turned in by Stacey for a 1 million dollar &#34;gift&#34; he presented her for saving his life. It will be difficult to get the charges to stick given their romantic history coloring the gift, as well as the fact that it came from Coalan&#39;s account. He had the smallest taste of freedom before being threatened with incarceration again, and the series wouldn&#39;t be the same if half of the season was spent with Dwight behind bars.





 7  Dwight Repairs His Relationship With His Daughter 
He&#39;d Gotten So   Before Being Arrested
        

Dwight had finally repaired his relationship with his daughter when he got arrested, possibly shattering any further chance of building a life with her thanks to returning to a life of crime. She was even prepared to move to Tulsa to be closer to him, but now her trust in him is lost. Dwight wasted so much time in jail being separated from his daughter&#39;s life that he can&#39;t afford to walk out on her now, so Tulsa King season 2 will most likely involve more melodrama surrounding Dwight getting out of prison and working tirelessly to repair the precarious bond that he has with her.





 6  Chickie Tries To Take Over Dwight&#39;s Operation 
Chickie Moves On It While Dwight Is In Jail
        

Chickie and his crew flew out to Tulsa to get perspective on Dwight&#39;s operations and found that not only were potentially profitable enough to be a problem for Chickie and the family. One prominent aspect of Dwight&#39;s crew is that, unlike on the East Coast, his gang can open-carry weapons, which has prevented Chickie from being able to start any trouble out in the open. It seems like the bulk of season 2 could be devoted to Chickie crafting the perfect way to get rid of Dwight and his crew, while at the same time being reckless enough in the pursuit of revenge that he exposes his own weaknesses.





 5  Tyson Becomes A Made Man 
Tyson Needs More Responsibilities
        

In the world of organized crime that Dwight belongs to, a &#34;made man&#34; in the Sicilian mafia is a fully-fledged member of the &#34;family.&#34; Only Italians or those of Italian descent can be recognized, but given the nature of Dwight&#39;s crew,Tyson getting more authority and greater responsibilities would be enough. Not only is he one of the most loyal members of Dwight&#39;s crew, he was also the first member, and the way that Dwight has helped Tyson become a man of agency and means, especially in the disapproving eyes of his father, has helped him gain confidence, clarity, and focus.





 4  Tina Takes On Chickie 
Tina May Go After Chickie While Her Dad Is In Jail
        

Should Dwight be incarcerated for part of season 2, it might give Tina the chance to step into her dad&#39;s shoes. After what happened between Tina and Nico, Dwight tried to make right by his daughter in violent ways he thought he&#39;d put behind him, but she didn&#39;t have any concept of Chickie&#39;s retaliating cruelty, though she may decide to go to war with his rival while Dwight&#39;s on the inside. Sylvester Stallone has mentioned that the schedule for Tulsa King has been grueling, so having Dwight in jail for a portion of the season would make sure that he only filmed the episodes he was comfortable with and a storyline that made sense for the overall plot.





 3  Dwight Finds Love 
He Had 2 Love Interests In Season 1
        

In season 1 of Tulsa King, Dwight had two love interests; rancher Margaret Deveraux, one of Tulsa&#39;s social elite, and Stacy Beale, who was working for the FBI and supposed to bring Dwight down if he got up to his old tricks. Stacy ends up getting shot with a bullet meant for Dwight, and after turning him over to the FBI, it&#39;s unlikely that they&#39;ll be getting together anytime soon. Margaret, on the other hand, could help Dwight ingratiate himself to the locals and be one half of a power couple (she&#39;s also a more age-appropriate love interest, given that Stacy is half Dwight&#39;s age).





 2  Storylines With Grace &amp; Supporting Cast 
Grace &amp; Supporting Characters Don&#39;t Have Enough Screen Time
        

Grace, Bad Face, and several other supporting characters only really came into their own in the final few episodes of Tulsa King, leaving a lot of room for character development in season 2. Certain smaller characters, like Brian Gillen (Margaret&#39;s ex-husband) could come to the fore thanks to their influence in Tulsa. It will also be interesting to see how much Tyson&#39;s father Mike warms to the idea of his son&#39;s activities after the fight in the roadhouse, or if he&#39;ll continue to view Dwight as a bad influence and mentor for his son.





 1  Armand Becomes A Major Player In Dwight&#39;s Gang 
He Was Loyal To Dwight In New York
        

Armand Truisi was loyal to Dwight in New York even though he wasn&#39;t aware of the extent, so even though they got off to a bad start when they reunited, the two eventually repaired their rocky relationship. Armand becoming a major player in Dwight&#39;s gang, perhaps even stepping up in his absence, seems like a logical step in Tulsa King season 2. By the same token, gaining some newfound confidence as well as integrity might help Armand repair his relationship with his wife.
