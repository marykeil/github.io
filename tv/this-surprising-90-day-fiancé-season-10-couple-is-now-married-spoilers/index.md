The current season of the ever-popular reality TV show features two familiar faces--Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda--along with six new couples who are already making waves. Some relationships already look doomed. However, a few look promising. The show has released 10 episodes so far, and it&#39;s hard to come to a prediction about who out of the seven couples on 90 Day Fiancé season 10 will certainly marry in the finale.




Spoilers reveal that Jasmine and Gino, Nick Ham and Devin Hoofman, and Clayton Clark and Anali Vallejos do become husband and wife in the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 finale, but according to a report by Starcasm, Sam Wilson and his partner from Indonesia, Citra, are also married.

          

The publication confirmed that Sam and Citra tied the knot near his hometown of Cameron, Missouri, on September 10, 2023. The wedding was officially recorded two days after the ceremony, as per court records. Sam and Citra&#39;s wedding venue was Far West Farm House, which is a beautiful turn-of-the-century farmhouse located near Sam&#39;s home. Photos were shared by Citra&#39;s family member @faradilashr.


 Sam &amp; Citra&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Storyline Explained 
          




Sam wore a gray suit to the wedding, while Citra was dressed in a strapless white gown and flowy veil. Citra&#39;s sisters attended the ceremony along with her father, Herman. Citra and Sam were the last couple to be introduced in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Sam is a 30-year-old man who works as a dockworker for Amazon, while Citra is a 26-year-old from West Java, Indonesia. Citra and Sam met three years before filming began. Citra was bored at work and scrolling through a dating app looking for friends when she saw Sam. Intrigued by his baby face, Citra messaged him. The two began talking without having any romantic feelings for each other.


 

However, over time, their bond became stronger, and a year later, Sam told Citra everything about his drug addiction past. Sam had been addicted to pain medicine at 15. He became clean at 22. His addiction affected Sam&#39;s ability to get a good career. It also made him cold and distant. He was unable to maintain relationships. Citra accepted Sam&#39;s past. Another year passed and Sam finally went to Indonesia to meet Citra, where he proposed to her. Citra agreed to marry Sam but told him that he&#39;d have to convert to Islam before that. They also couldn&#39;t have sex before marriage as per her religion&#39;s beliefs.

Citra wished to marry Sam two weeks after she came to the U.S. Her father was also going to come with her. Sam knew he had a lot to prove to Citra&#39;s dad before he could marry her. He is also keeping a secret from Citra, which he thinks could end their relationship on 90 Day Fiancé. Still, Citra and Sam will get a happy ending as per their wedding photos, which confirms Citra chose to stay with him despite whatever secret Sam was hiding.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
