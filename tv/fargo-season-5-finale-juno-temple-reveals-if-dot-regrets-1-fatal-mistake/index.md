Summary

  Dot actor Juno Temple addresses her character&#39;s possible guilt after the events of Fargo season 5, episode 10.   Temple zeroes in on where Dot&#39;s regrets may lie after her actions during the siege on Roy&#39;s ranch.   Dot may feel remorse over her role in the death of a character who was trying to save her.  







Juno Temple reveals if Dot regrets one fatal mistake in the Fargo season 5 finale. Dot’s season-long survivor’s story came to an end in the stunning final episode of the latest season of FX’s Coen Brothers-inspired drama series. Though Dot herself lived through the carnage at Roy Tillman’s ranch and was reunited with her family, not every character proved so lucky. Among the dead was Lamorne Morris’ Witt Farr, the state patrolman whose life was previously saved by Dot, leaving him feeling honor-bound to rescue her from Roy’s clutches.

Witt Farr was indeed successful in helping Dot escape the violent events of the Fargo season 5 finale, but lost his own life at Roy’s hands in the process, opening up Dot to potential remorse over the fact that she herself did not take Roy out when she had the chance, but tried to make him suffer before ending him. Addressing the subject of her character’s possible guilt over Witt’s death, Dot actor Temple offered up some insightful remarks, saying she thinks Dot will have regrets. Check out what she had to say below (via THR):





I think she intended for Roy to feel it. She did not want Witt Farr to go after him, but Witt wouldn’t let that happen. Of course, she’s going to be aware of her involvement in the passing of an extraordinary life that died saving her and a lot of other people. But I think she wanted Roy to feel each bullet. So I don’t think the regret of not shooting him in one go is something she will feel, but she will absolutely regret that she couldn’t prevent Witt Farr from dying.



 Fargo Season 5 Was All About Debt, And Witt Farr Paid The Highest Price 
          

Fargo season 5 centered thematically on the concept of debt. Roy Tillman believed that, because Dot was once his wife, she owed him the debt of her life in repayment for leaving him. Gator set out to collect a debt, in the form of bloody vengeance, against Ole Munch, and Munch himself took Gator’s eyes in payment for his sins. In the finale, Dot was motivated to make Roy suffer out of the belief that he owed her blood after his abuse, a choice that allowed Roy to escape death.






Creator Noah Hawley recently said Fargo season 6 could happen, after previously telling FX that season 5 would be the last.




Belief in a debt owed indeed drove several Fargo season 5 characters to extreme acts of violence. But among all the show’s characters, Witt Farr stands out for wanting to repay his perceived debt to Dot by saving her life in recompense for her saving his. Farr finally did have a hand in saving Dot, but paid the ultimate price at the hands of Roy. Given her kind nature, it’s believable that Dot would feel remorseful for not killing Roy when she had the chance, a decision that led to the heroic Witt giving up his own life.
