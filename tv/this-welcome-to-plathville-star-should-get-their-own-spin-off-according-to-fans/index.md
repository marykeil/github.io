## Literature Review
Welcome to Plathville fans are calling for a spinoff centered around one of the controversial cast members who they think would make good TV.




Welcome to Plathville fans are calling for a spinoff centered around one controversial star from the show. The show is currently airing its fifth season, as it follows parents Barry and Kim Plath and their nine children. Barry and Kim are no longer together and are in the midst of a divorce. Also not together, are oldest Plath son Ethan, and his wife Olivia, whose marriage was a heavy focus on the show. The other older Plath kids, Moriah and Micah Plath, are out of the house, and their lives both within and outside the family have had the spotlight.




While the hit TLC show focuses on the Plath Family and all the dynamics, viewers seem to have grown attached to Olivia. Olivia and Ethan&#39;s complicated and turbulent relationship and Olivia&#39;s estranged relationship with the Plath family have been the core of the drama on Welcome To Plathville. Now, fans want to see more of Olivia, despite the fact she is now on the outside of her ex&#39;s family. A Redditor @OneBag962 made a poll asking &#34;This feels like the last season, who gets a spin off?&#34;


 

Olivia won the overwhelming majority of votes, with 616. The next runner-up, Micah, only had 94 votes. The results of this poll heavily show that Olivia&#39;s personality and all she brings to the show are what fans want more of, even though she&#39;s on the outs.





 Olivia Plathâ€™s Welcome To Plathville Journey Explained 
         

In the Reddit thread&#39;s comments, other fans showed up to give opinions on why they thought Olivia should get own spinoff. One person remarked, &#34;Not an Olivia fan at all, but she&#39;s the only one with a story line in breaking the fundie cult upbringing. The adult Plath kids are so broken and have nothing interesting going on in life.&#34; Another penned, &#34;Olivia is really the only one I care about. I&#39;d like to see more of her journey. Give her a dating show, a travelling show, I don&#39;t care.&#34; A spinoff with Olivia could work if the network works the right angle and incorporates the fallout of Olivia&#39;s breakup.

Olivia has had a rough journey on the show. During Welcome To Plathville season 1, Olivia and Ethan seemed smitten after having gotten married at 18. Olivia had a close bond with all of Ethan&#39;s siblings. Where the disconnect was, was between Olivia and Barry and Kim. Olivia did not agree with their fundamentalist viewpoints and behavior towards their children. As Moriah and Micah started to bond with their parents more and come to understand them better, Olivia became the enemy because she was pushing them to think their upbringing was bad.




Moreover, Olivia and Moriah had a falling out over Moriah&#39;s music, and Moriah took their mom Kim&#39;s side in bashing Olivia for Kim&#39;s shady credit card arrangement with Ethan. All the Plath kids put out the same social media message supporting their mom and essentially condemning Olivia. That move solidified the rift between Olivia and the Plath family while, simultaneously, Olivia and Ethan were moving in different directions in life. Welcome To Plathville has changed a lot over the years, but it&#39;s clear Olivia helped make the show as popular as it has been.



Welcome To Plathville airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.
