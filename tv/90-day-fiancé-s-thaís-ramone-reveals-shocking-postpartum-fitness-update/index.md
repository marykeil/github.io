## Literature Review
A year after welcoming her first baby, Thaís Ramone surprises 90 Day Fiancé fans and cast members with her impressive postpartum transformation.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Thaís Ramone unveiled her praiseworthy fitness transformation in a new Instagram video. The 27-year-old reality star pursued Austin resident Patrick Mendes in 90 Day Fiancé season 9. She loved him dearly but struggled to live with her brother-in-law, John Mcmanus. Like other couples, Thaís and Patrick faced trust issues during their journey on the show. However, they didn’t let their problems stop them from tying the knot. The couple announced they were pregnant during the 90 Day Fiancé Season 9 Tell-All last year. Shortly after, they welcomed an adorable daughter, Aleesi Ramone Mendes, in November 2022.




While Thaís has been quiet about her postpartum journey since 2022, she has been working hard for herself. The young mom recently shared a video of her transformation over the last 12 months. Thaís showed herself working out, lifting weights, running, jumping, squatting, and more.


 

Thaís also shared a sneak peek at the healthy diet she consumed to achieve her new look. She compared her postpartum body to her current physique, showing that she has toned up a lot after losing 38 pounds. The 90 Day Fiancé alum wrote, “My body is not the same but I’m happy with the change,” implying that having Aleesi was worth it.

 90 Day Fiancé Fans &amp; Cast Members React To Thaís&#39; Fitness Milestone 
Thaís’ transformation got love and support from 90 Day Fiancé fans, co-stars, and fellow mothers. A social media user commented, “You’re tall! You look fabulous,” asking if Thaís has returned to her pre-baby size. Thaís responded, “No still 14 pounds. But I’m good where I’m at now.” Another user wrote, “The motivation I needed to get back in the gym,” and Thaís replied, “I want to see you going!!! Tag me.” 90 Day Fiancé’s Anny Francisco and Julia Trubkina also applauded their Brazilian co-star. Thaís’ husband, Patrick, also shared a loving note. He wrote, “I’m so proud of you amor,” adding that Thaís is an amazing example to their daughter Aleesi.

A postpartum journey is a personal and emotional part of a mother’s life. The sudden change in the body and numerous other shifts can be hard to overcome. But Thaís is doing great and has overcome her hurdles within a year. She started her fitness journey in November 2022 and worked on herself. She opted for the right diet and continued progressing as swiftly as possible. Patrick may have assisted her with his gym experience as well. Aleesi’s daddy was previously a gym buff and powerlifter.




Thaís has provided a lot of inspiration with her transformation. However, she isn’t the only 90 Day Fiancé season 9 cast member who has motivated viewers with her postpartum journey in the last few months. Previously, mother of two Emily Bieberly surprised her followers with her fitness update. She discussed her struggles with an open heart and encouraged her followers to stay consistent. Similarly, Kara Rojer (née Bass) uplifted people with her postpartum post and a positive mindset. Hopefully, Thaís from 90 Day Fiancé season 9 will soon accomplish her final fitness goal of losing 14 pounds.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
