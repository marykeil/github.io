  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Sitcom plot twists can be unexpected and surprising, even though comedy is their main focus.
Not all plot twists in sitcoms are lighthearted, as they can include darker themes such as death and affairs.
Sometimes sitcoms throw off their audience by introducing unexpected plot twists, like sudden pregnancies or characters coming back to life.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sitcoms aren&rsquo;t designed for big, dramatic moments and are mainly pure comedy. However, over the years, they have had some incredible plot twists.</p>
<p>While a TV sitcom&rsquo;s main purpose is not to shock or surprise audiences with plot twists, there have been some completely unexpected moments in the sitcom format. A big shock in any television show is often foreshadowed, although this isn&rsquo;t exclusively, and when it isn&rsquo;t, it makes the moment even more surprising. Even in between laughs and giggles, sitcoms still have the power to completely throw off an audience.
It&rsquo;s worth noting that even in comedies, their plot twists aren&rsquo;t always light-hearted. Sitcoms have had their darker moments, even if they are underplayed with humor. Whether it is a death, an affair, new loves, pregnancies, or anything in between, there have been many big plot twists in sitcoms.</p>
<p>15  Leslie Gets Pregnant With Triplets
Parks And Recreation</p>
<p>Despite appearing to be the busiest woman in the world, in Parks and Recreation season 6, Leslie (Amy Poehler) discovers that she&rsquo;s pregnant with her husband Ben&rsquo;s (Adam Scott) baby. In one of Ben and Leslie&rsquo;s most important episodes, Leslie believes she&rsquo;s caught an awful case of the flu, but instead finds out that her family is growing. However, it didn&rsquo;t stop there, as in the very next episode the couple are told that they are expecting triplets. A sudden pregnancy is not an unusual concept in sitcoms, but the upcoming arrival of triplets is unheard of.</p>
<p>14  Michael&rsquo;s Death
Jane the Virgin</p>
<p>Jane the Virgin</p>
<p>Release Date   October 13, 2014    Cast   Gina Rodriguez , Andrea Navedo , Justin Baldoni , Ivonne Coll , Brett Dier , Jaime Camil    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Despite being one of Jane the Virgin&rsquo;s most crucial characters, Michael Cordero (Brett Dier) was rather suddenly killed off in the episode &ldquo;Chapter Fifty-Four.&rdquo; His death was particularly surprising as it happened at the end of the episode with no foreshadowing, and he had also already survived near death just a few episodes before. After these events, Jane the Virgin had a three-year time jump, and over time, Jane (Gina Rodriguez) entered a relationship with Mateo&rsquo;s father, Rafael (Justin Baldoni).
The show then lured audiences into a false sense of security. All loved up and a happy family, Jane believed that Rafael was going to propose, but he instead revealed that Michael was, in fact, still alive. Not only was Michael&rsquo;s death unexpected, but to watch Jane move on and then find out her husband wasn&rsquo;t really dead was just heartbreaking.</p>
<p>13  Clare&rsquo;s Father Dies
Derry Girls</p>
<p>Derry Girls</p>
<p>Release Date   January 4, 2018    Cast   Saoirse-Monica Jackson , Louisa Harland    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Even though Derry Girls was set during the Troubles in Ireland in the 1990s, which brought an expectation of possible casualties, the loss of Clare&rsquo;s (Nicola Coughlan) father was still a huge plot twist. Despite Sean (David Ireland) dying from an aneurysm, rather than anything related to the ongoing violence at the time, it was still completely unexpected, especially as it happened at the end of a rather normal episode. What made the Derry Girls season 3 death even more gutting was Gerry (Tommy Tiernan) having to announce the news to the kids, crushing Clare, who moments before had experienced her first kiss.</p>
<p>12  Brian Griffin Is Hit By A Car
Family Guy</p>
<p>Family Guy</p>
<p>Release Date   January 31, 1999    Cast   Seth MacFarlane , Alex Borstein , Seth Green , Lacey Chabert , Mila Kunis , Mike Henry , Patrick Warburton    Seasons   21</p>
<p>An unexpected moment in Family Guy that was thankfully rectified was the death of the Griffin&rsquo;s dog, Brian (Seth McFarlane). In a shocking twist of events, while playing with Stewie (McFarlane) in the street, Brian was hit by a car. While Family Guy typically downplays dark moments as being run-of-the-mill situations with humor, this was one occasion in which the show was incredibly emotional and moving. Luckily, he was able to come back to life just two episodes later after Stewie went back in time, but it was still a moment that nobody could have seen coming.</p>
<p>11  Penny&rsquo;s Pregnancy
The Big Bang Theory</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory</p>
<p>Release Date   September 24, 2007    Cast   Kaley Cuoco , Johnny Galecki , Jim Parsons , Melissa Rauch , Mayim Bialik , Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg    Seasons   12</p>
<p>In The Big Bang Theory, Penny (Kaley Cuoco) often voiced that she didn&rsquo;t have any interest in having kids. However, in the show&rsquo;s finale, Penny and Leonard (Johnny Galecki) announced that they were expecting. Although some of the later episodes from season 12 saw Penny slowly start to reconsider her decision, it was never fully addressed. Her conversations with her father started to turn Penny&rsquo;s head on the topic, but even so, such a big life decision is not something that happens overnight. So, when she and Leonard announced their pregnancy after being quiet about potentially having children for a while, it was quite the plot twist.</p>
<p>10  Dan Conner Had Died
Roseanne</p>
<p>Roseanne</p>
<p>Release Date   October 18, 1988    Cast   Roseanne Barr , John Goodman , Laurie Metcalf , Sara Gilbert , Lecy Goranson , Michael Fishman    Seasons   10</p>
<p>The sitcom Roseanne is remembered for its season 10 retcon, although given how season 9 ended, it was probably for the best. Roseanne spent an entire season focusing on The Conners&rsquo; lives after winning the lottery, as well as audiences watching Roseanne (Barr) dealing with Dan&rsquo;s (John Goodman) infidelity. However, its final episode revealed that all of these events were simply a figment of the titular character&rsquo;s imagination.
In reality, Dan had died at the end of season 8, and the Conners didn&rsquo;t win the lottery. Although it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see the whole &ldquo;it was all a dream&rdquo; trope on television, Dan&rsquo;s death was especially shocking in this context, as usually the cover-up for reality is overly positive. However, Roseanne&rsquo;s way of coping with her grief was to imagine he&rsquo;d cheated on her instead, which was simply stunning. When the show came back for season 10 after being off the air for eleven years, Dan was suddenly alive again, and the entire affair was retconned.</p>
<p>9  The Monkey Stole Annie&rsquo;s Pen
Community</p>
<p>One of Community&rsquo;s best episodes made use of a singular setting, as the gang spiraled into chaos over Annie&rsquo;s (Alison Brie) missing pen. &ldquo;Cooperative Calligraphy&rdquo; is a great example of a TV bottle episode, as well as an overall study of the Community characters, as they all turned against each other. Each member of the group&rsquo;s denial is not only hilarious, but with each one, complicates the story further, and the true identity of the thief slips further away with each minute.
The end of the episode reveals that the pen thief was actually Annie&rsquo;s Boobs, Troy&rsquo;s (Donald Glover) monkey. The animal was first introduced in the season 1 episode &ldquo;Contemporary American Poultry&rdquo; but hadn&rsquo;t been seen again until this moment. Not only was this a huge plot twist because of the return of the forgotten monkey, but also because, after a deep, psychological argument between the group had broken out, the true thief&rsquo;s identity was simply ridiculous.</p>
<p>8  Erin Finds Her Birth Parents
The Office</p>
<p>The Office</p>
<p>Release Date   March 24, 2005    Cast   Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski    Seasons   9</p>
<p>Since her introduction in The Office, one of Erin&rsquo;s (Ellie Kemper) most memorable details surrounded her growing up in foster care. Erin often spoke about finding her birth parents one day, and at one point, even took a DNA test to see if she was the child that Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) had given up years previously. Although it seemed like there was no hope for the Dunder Mifflin secretary to reunite with her birth family, the storyline was unexpectedly resolved in The Office finale, when the couple arrived at the meet and greet.
While the reunification was rather sweet and wholesome, it was still a big plot twist for the show. After years of waiting, it was unexpected for Erin to not only find her parents, but to find that the two were still together and wanted to be a part of her life. It was lovely to see Erin get a happy ending, and considering she wasn&rsquo;t one of the main characters in The Office, it was great to see her story get some closure that wasn&rsquo;t related to her romantic relationships.</p>
<p>7  The Identity Of The Ass Crack Bandit
Community</p>
<p>A recurring storyline throughout Community revolved around the Ass Crack Bandit, a mysterious serial prankster who would drop coins down students&rsquo; trousers at unexpected moments. Despite the satirical element, Greendale Community College treated the figure like a hardcore criminal, with Annie in particular determined to find out their identity. In season 5, after a year with no incidents, the Bandit struck again, and Annie launched an investigation.
After several characters get involved, developing psychological profiles and theories, everything is forgotten when it&rsquo;s announced that Pierce (Chevy Chase) died. Although Star-Burns (Dino Stamatopoulos) confessed to the crimes, the end of the episode implied that the true identity still had not been revealed. However, when the Bandit was brought up again in season 6, Annie began to look rather suspicious. Although it would seem that this Community storyline went unresolved, the clues were there, and in the 2020 Community reunion, creator Dan Harmon confirmed that the identity of the Ass Crack Bandit was indeed Annie.</p>
<p>6  Maggie Simpson Shot Mr. Burns
The Simpsons</p>
<p>The Simpsons</p>
<p>Release Date   December 17, 1989    Cast   Tress MacNeille , Julie Kavner , Harry Shearer , Pamela Hayden , Nancy Cartwright , Hank Azaria , Dan Castellaneta , Yeardley Smith    Seasons   35</p>
<p>One of The Simpsons&rsquo; biggest whodunnits surrounded the mystery of who pulled the trigger on Mr. Burns (Harry Shearer). The two-part episode &ldquo;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&rdquo; built up huge suspense throughout, considering almost the entire town of Springfield had reason to shoot the business tycoon. With a long list of suspects, it was a huge plot twist when it was revealed that the shooter was Maggie, who had retaliated after Mr. Burns tried to take a lollipop from her. Despite everyone assuming it was an accident, the episode&rsquo;s final moments saw the baby shoot a look that implied that she&rsquo;d done it on purpose, which was just all-around hilarious.</p>
<p>5  Monica And Chandler Sleeping Together
Friends</p>
<p>Friends</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 1994    Cast   Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer    Seasons   10</p>
<p>One of the biggest and most memorable moments from Friends was the reveal of Monica and Chandler sleeping together. The show&rsquo;s creators revealed that the couple wasn&rsquo;t going to last originally, but the audience reaction to the memorable scene the morning of Ross&rsquo; (David Schwimmer) wedding was so huge, that they decided to try and make Monica (Courteney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) work in the following season. What initially started in the writer&rsquo;s room as a quirky and silly plot point ended up blossoming into one of the show&rsquo;s core elements, and Friends may have been very different without it.</p>
<p>4  They&rsquo;re In The Bad Place
The Good Place</p>
<p>The Good Place</p>
<p>Release Date   September 19, 2016    Cast   Kristen Bell , William Jackson Harper , Jameela Jamil , D&rsquo;Arcy Carden , Manny Jacinto , Ted Danson    Seasons   4</p>
<p>In one of TV&rsquo;s biggest plot twists, The Good Place&rsquo;s season 1 finale completely flipped the show on its head. After a season of Eleanor (Kristen Bell) believing she was in the Good Place, she came to the realization that it was, in fact, the Bad Place. This reveal was a huge moment for the show, and even with a few clues littered in The Good Place pilot, it was completely unexpected. On top of this, the moment was made even more impactful by Michael&rsquo;s (Ted Danson) creepy grin, dropping his facade.</p>
<p>3  The Mother Had Died Before Ted Started The Story
How I Met Your Mother</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother</p>
<p>Release Date   September 19, 2005    Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Seasons   9</p>
<p>Throughout the entire run of How I Met Your Mother, the show&rsquo;s end goal was to introduce audiences to the mother of Ted&rsquo;s (Josh Radnor) children. It took nine seasons for the two to meet, but Ted finally met the love of his life, Tracy (Cristin Milioti), after Robin (Cobie Smulders) and Barney&rsquo;s (Neil Patrick Harris) wedding. However, the show&rsquo;s final episode &ldquo;Last Forever - Part 2,&rdquo; revealed that at some point after the kids were born, Tracy died from an unknown illness.
After audiences had committed over nine years to finding out the identity of the Mother, only for her to be killed off in the series&rsquo; final moments, this was a huge plot twist. In fact, it sparked such outrage, that production released an alternate ending to How I Met Your Mother.Regardless, the damage had been done, and Tracy&rsquo;s death makes re-watching the show feel different, considering what would happen.</p>
<p>2  Ben Is Actually Dead
Scrubs</p>
<p>Scrubs</p>
<p>Release Date   October 1, 2001    Cast   John C. McGinley , Robert Maschio , Donald Faison , Christa Miller , Neil Flynn , Judy Reyes , Aloma Wright , Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Sam Lloyd , Ken Jenkins    Seasons   9</p>
<p>Even though Scrubs had plenty of deaths during its 9-season run, Ben&rsquo;s (Brendan Fraser) was easily the show&rsquo;s most impactful. Not only was Ben Perry&rsquo;s (John C. McGinley) best friend, but he was also his brother-in-law, which makes the doctor&rsquo;s actions in the episode &ldquo;My Screw Up&rdquo; even more emotional. Throughout the episode, it&rsquo;s made to look like Cox is struggling with the death of a seemingly random patient, with Ben following behind him and offering commentary.
When arriving at what was originally thought to be the first birthday of baby Jack, it is revealed that Cox is instead at Ben&rsquo;s funeral. Ben had died from leukemia, which he&rsquo;d been diagnosed with in season 1. This heartbreaking moment, however, did allow Cox to let his walls down, allowing his friends and family to support him as he came to the realization that Ben was gone.</p>
<p>1  Ross Says Rachel&rsquo;s Name At The Altar
Friends</p>
<p>Another one of Friends&rsquo; biggest plot twists happened during the same storyline as Monica and Chandler. As he prepared to marry Emily (Helen Baxendale), Ross ended up saying Rachel&rsquo;s (Jennifer Aniston) name at the altar instead of his wife-to-be&rsquo;s. This shocking moment, in the final seconds of the episode, left Friends season 4 on a cliffhanger.
Although it&rsquo;s no surprise that Ross and Emily didn&rsquo;t work out, it truly seemed like he was over Rachel and ready to move on with someone else. But within a matter of seconds, his slip of the tongue ended up ruining his future. Even with Ross and Rachel&rsquo;s complicated relationship, for her ex to say her name at his wedding to someone else must have been a plot twist for her, let alone the audience.</p>
