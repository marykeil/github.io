## Literature Review

The Chi season 5 cast members include a handful of notable actors surrounded by many newer talents who play the show&#39;s colorful and varied characters.




The Chi season 5 cast members include many characters from previous seasons, comprising a talented and prolific cast. Created by Lena Waithe, the Showtime series premiered in January 2018 and is a coming-of-age drama that follows a group of individuals in the south side of Chicago who grow, love, and try to survive in a community that sees people and families intersect in unexpected ways. The show&#39;s fifth season premiered in June 2022 and, 10 episodes later, ended in September 2022. A sixth season of the series arrived in 2023, but the future of the show remains uncertain.




The main characters in The Chi have changed across seasons and though there are no new major ones in season 5, old characters play bigger roles this time around. Season 5 sees the series star Emmett Washington (Jacob Latimore) growing closer to the mother of his child and attempting to forge a new path in life. The show features a relatively young cast of actors playing the roles of people forced to grow up too quickly in the neighborhoods of Chicago. While not every actor is the most recognizable talent, most if not all have appeared in something noteworthy.

The Chi is Hibbert&#39;s first television role, but he began acting in movies in 2016 with his role in the coming-of-age movie Moonlight, playing the youngest version of Chiron, a character also played by Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes. Post-Moonlight, Hibbert played one of the young Oakland children at the beginning of Black Panther and later went on to appear in The Graduates as Ben and Good Burger 2 as Ed 2.
