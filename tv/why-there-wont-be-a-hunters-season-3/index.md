## SUMMARY

## Literature Review
Ahead of Hunters season 2&#39;s release, Amazon Prime Video confirmed that the second season would be the last. Here&#39;s a look at its cancelation.




WARNING! This article contains SPOILERS for Hunters season 2!After a long wait for the second season of the Amazon Prime thriller series, there will be no Hunters season 3 to follow. Hunters premiered in February 2020 to divisive reviews (via Rotten Tomatoes) and the second season was long delayed, finally coming out in January 2023. Given how long it took for Hunters season 2 to premiere, there were immediate questions about whether there would be more episodes. Sadly, after season 2 wrapped up many of the major storylines of the series, it was confirmed that Hunters season 3 was not happening.




Hunters season 2 follows two different timelines. The first takes place in 1979 as Jonah and the hunters track down Adolf Hitler in Argentina, while the second follows Al Pacino’s Meyer Offerman (revealed in Hunters season 1&#39;s twist ending to be Nazi Wilhelm Zuchs, A.K.A. “The Wolf”) from 1975, when he first begins killing Nazis, until 1977 when he orders the death of Ruth Heidelbaum. Hunters season 2 provides satisfying conclusions to both stories, which creator David Weil remarked to EW would provide “catharsis” and Jewish empowerment. While the somewhat open-ended finale could have led to more Nazi-hunting adventures for Jonah, Hunters season 3 isn&#39;t happening.

                  Hunters Season 2 Timeline Explained: When Each Story Takes Place   Hunters season 2 features multiple storylines taking place at different times, including extensive flashbacks of Al Pacino&#39;s character Meyer Offerman.    


 Prime Video Announced Hunters Season 2 As The Final Season 
No Reason Was Given For The Show&#39;s Cancelation
          




At the same time that Hunters season 2 received its official release date, Prime Video confirmed that the second batch of episodes would be the series’ last and that Hunters season 3 isn&#39;t happening. Amazon didn’t confirm exactly why Hunters was canceled, but the announcement comes alongside the confirmation that the neo-noir fantasy Carnival Row would also be one of Amazon&#39;s TV shows ending in 2023 after only two seasons. Not only is Hunters season 2 ending more quickly than anticipated, but the second season only received an eight-episode order compared to the first season’s 10 episodes.

Considering Hunters’ season 1 finale revealed that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun were alive and hiding in Argentina, it&#39;s the natural progression for the series to end with the biggest hunt of all. Hunters didn’t require two more seasons of anticipation as Jonah and his associates tracked down Hitler and brought him to justice. Jonah, Millie, Harriet, Lonny, Roxy, Joe, and Mindy were successful in locking Hitler in a cell for the remainder of his life, so Hunters&#39; season 2 cathartic ending made a third season less necessary.






 What Hunters Season 3 Could Have Been About 
The Villainous Travis Remains A Possible Threat
         

Though Hunters season 3 isn&#39;t happening, it likely would have mirrored the first season’s plot, with the group of hunters going after the rest of the Nazis around the globe who haven’t been brought to justice. However, instead of Hitler, Wilhelm Zuchs, or The Colonel/Eva Braun, Hunters season 3’s big villain likely would have been Travis, the evil neo-Nazi who escaped in the season 2 finale. Travis’s whereabouts are unclear in Hunters season 2’s ending, which leaves the series with a major mystery about how his plans to lead the “Fourth Reich” would be foiled.

However, the final scene of Jonah subtly tracking another Nazi in Hunters at a restaurant in Miami suggests he would eventually find Travis and stop the villain’s plans. Hunters season 2 Hitler storyline ended with him in prison, but evil isn’t dead, so there will inevitably be more villainous Nazis that the characters need to track down and end. Just as the finale implies, Jonah and his associates would continue their dangerous work in Hunters season 3 and beyond, only stopping when every Nazi is exposed and brought to justice for their crimes.

 What The Cast &amp; Crew Had To Say About Hunters Ending 
Logan Lerman Expressed Satisfaction With The Story&#39;s Conclusion
          

While many are disappointed that Hunters season 3 isn&#39;t happening, the cast and the crew have positive things to say about the ending of the series. Lead actor Logan Lerman spoke up about the sophomore season with THR, and he was quite satisfied with the series finale and Jonah&#39;s arc in Hunters season 2. In terms of playing the character from start to finish, Lerman admitted:


&#34;It was great. I mean, it’s been such a good ride for me. I mean, talk about a lot to work with in a character. This arc is a massive one from season one to season two, but I must say I was really excited about season two, Jonah and exploring this side of his character.&#34;





Hunters showrunner David Weil also spoke to THR, and was quite happy with the story he got to tell, despite the disappointment that Hunters season 3 isn&#39;t happening. Weil saw the utmost importance of putting Adolf Hitler on trial and in turn, giving the opportunity for Jonah to choose either the dark or the light:


&#34;Telling this story felt even more urgent, even more important, and you’ll see echoes, particularly in the trial in episode eight, that speak to not only the violence and the genocide of the Holocaust of what Adolf Hitler perpetrated, but that also speaks to the kind of hatred, bigotry, prejudice, antisemitism, racism that lives on today.&#34;


             Hunters Set in 1977 New York, Hunters follows Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman), who is recruited by Meyer Offerman (Al Pacino) to join a secret organization of Nazi hunters that work to prevent the formation of the Fourth Reich. The Prime Video original series lasted for two seasons and also starred Lena Olin, Josh Radnor, Jerrika Hinton, Carol Kane, Greg Austin, Tiffany Boone, and Louis Ozawa.
