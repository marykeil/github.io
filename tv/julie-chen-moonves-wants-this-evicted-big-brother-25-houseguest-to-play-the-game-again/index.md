## Literature Review
Big Brother host Julie Chen Moonves reveals which evicted BB 25 houseguest she&#39;d like to see return to the reality competition show in the future.




Big Brother 25 host Julie Chen Moonves revealed that she&#39;d like to see Cameron Hardin return for another season and a second chance to win the $750,000 prize. At the Big Brother 25 finale, one of the Final 3 contestants--Matt Klotz, Jag Bains, or Bowie Jane--will be crowned the winner of this milestone season. The Jury of 7, made up of Cameron, Cory Wurtenberger, Blue Kim, America Lopez, Cirie Fields, Felicia Cannon, and whichever houseguest is evicted on finale night, will make that decision.




In an interview with Pop Crave, Julie revealed that she wants to see Cameron return for a future Big Brother season. She explained, &#34;He appeared like an unstoppable comp beast and lasted for many weeks with no real allies working with him. Impressive!&#34; Cameron not only won three HOH and two Power of Veto competitions, but he resurrected his game by winning both the Resurrection Rumble and Do or Die competition. He was also on the chopping block five times, after having been betrayed by many of his alliance members throughout the season.

 Julie Chen Moonves Ranks Big Brother 25 In The Top 5 
          

Julie shared that she would rank Big Brother 25 in the Top 5 of all of the seasons. She explained, &#34;Iâ€™ve enjoyed watching how the gameplay this season was like a moving target.&#34; Julie pointed out that &#34;allegiances between houseguests has moved around a lot. There were no clear-cut alliances that were rock-solid.&#34; She concluded by saying, &#34;This group seemed to understand this is ultimately a game of one against all others.&#34; This is why she ranked Big Brother 25 in the Top 5.





 

Julie is right that Cameron deserves another chance to play Big Brother. Like many legends of the game who came before him, he was either in power or on the chopping block because he was always seen as a threat. His attempts to form alliances were always ruined by the fact that his allies saw him as too dangerous to keep in the game. As a superfan, Cameron showed his knowledge of the game when he tried to model his Fugitives alliance with Matt and Jag after Big Brother 12&#39;s iconic alliance, The Brigade. However, Cameron never got the chance to put his plan in motion because Jag and Matt turned on him. It would be incredible to see Cameron return and find a true alliance that he could team up with and run the house.

Julie&#39;s assessment of the Big Brother 25 houseguests&#39; gameplay is spot-on. Although they&#39;ve been criticized for flip-flopping too much and never really making true alliances, these houseguests showed that they were willing to do anything to bring home the grand prize. Ultimately, they were truer to themselves than anyone else. This is how Jag got to the end of the game. He was in an alliance with every single member of the jury at some point, and betrayed all of them. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if this style of gameplay backfires on him or makes him $750,000 richer. With Big Brother 25, everyone should always &#34;expect the unexpected.&#34;




The Big Brother 25 finale airs Thursday, November 9, at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.
