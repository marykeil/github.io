# Sister Wives Meri Brown Accuses Kody Of Doing This Disrespectful Thing Behind Her Back (SPOILERS)


## SUMMARY 



  Meri Brown feels deeply disrespected by her ex-husband, Kody Brown, for withholding his feelings and not communicating with her directly about the end of their marriage.   Kody chose to have Robyn Brown deliver the news of their divorce, instead of speaking to Meri, which further shows his lack of respect.   The fallout from their complicated and volatile relationship is still unfolding onscreen, but Meri is hopeful for a positive future without the burden of a difficult relationship.

## Literature Review
Sister Wives Meri Brown knows Kody Brown&#39;s feelings didn&#39;t change for her overnight and accuses him of a major act of disrespect in an exclusive clip.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown may be out of her marriage to Kody Brown, but she&#39;s revisiting her time with her ex-husband on Sister Wives: One On One and believes he&#39;s been deeply disrespectful to her in an exclusive clip. Throughout the last several seasons of Sister Wives, Meri and Kody have been navigating their difficult relationship and trying to find some common ground. Despite 30 years of marriage, the couple has had difficulty communicating over the last few years because of the betrayal Kody&#39;s felt from Meri. Though he claimed to forgive her for catfishing scandal, Meri still had to work her way back into Kody&#39;s good graces.




In a clip (via E! Online) from the next episode of Sister Wives season 18&#39;s four part Tell-All, Meri shares that she feels disrespected by the way Kody withheld his feelings from her. &#34;Looking back on it, he let go of me a long time ago emotionally,&#34; Meri explained to host Sukanya Krishnan. &#34;He&#39;s sitting here telling Robyn [about their agreement to share their real feelings]...And I&#39;m like, &#39;Why did you not respect me enough as a human being [to do the same]?&#39;&#34; While the couple have ended their marriage, Meri held out hope long after Kody.

 Meri &amp; Kody Brownâ€™s Relationship Explained 
          




Meri&#39;s anger with Kody isn&#39;t unfounded. He&#39;s expressed several times that he&#39;s felt his marriage to Meri has been over for years, but has never said that directly. &#34;I understand that you don&#39;t feel like that I&#39;m your wife anymore,&#34; Meri shared during the Sister Wives interview, &#34;even though we made covenants and nothing has happened to break them at that point. Like, I understand that&#39;s how you feel about me, but have the respect for me as a human being to tell me to my face. And he didn&#39;t.&#34; Appalled by her ex-husband&#39;s behavior, Meri was hopeful that he would respect her enough to end things like an adult.


 

Instead of speaking to a woman he&#39;s been in a relationship with for over half his life, Kody hid behind his only remaining wife, Robyn Brown, and made Meri take the first step toward their divorce. After over 30 years together, Meri and Kody&#39;s relationship has been complicated and sometimes volatile. Despite the fact that their experiences together haven&#39;t always been positive, Meri deserved the respect of Kody saying he was going to end things to her face. She&#39;s rightfully angry about the way she was treated in her marriage, and speaking out about it has likely been cathartic for Kody&#39;s first wife.




While Kody and Meri&#39;s marriage is over, the fallout from their relationship is still unfolding on screen. The couple&#39;s decision to separate didn&#39;t come easily, and while Kody had been checked out of his marriage to Meri for years, his ex-wife wasn&#39;t aware that he wasn&#39;t trying throughout nearly the last decade of their relationship. For Meri, Sister Wives season 18 has been a revelatory moment in her life, leading her to what she hopes to be a fruitful, loving next chapter without a difficult relationship weighing her down.
