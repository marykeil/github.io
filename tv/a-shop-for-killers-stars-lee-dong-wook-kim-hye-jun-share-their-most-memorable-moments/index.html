<p>Summary</p>
<p>A Shop for Killers is a new Korean drama on Disney+ internationally and Hulu in the U.S., following a young woman who must fight back against mysterious assassins to survive.   Lead actors Lee Dong-wook and Kim Hye-jun play uncle and niece, with the former&rsquo;s death triggering a series of unfortunate events for the latter.   Lee and Kim discuss their favorite moments in the show thus far, as well as the most challenging scenes they had to shoot.</p>
<p>A Shop For Killers is the latest original Korean drama from Disney+, following in the wake of 2023&rsquo;s The Worst of Evil. Airing on Hulu in the U.S., the 8-episode thriller follows a young woman named Jeong Ji-an (Kim Hye-jun) who lives with her uncle Jin-man after the shocking death of her parents. Unbeknownst to Ji-an, her quiet childhood was filled with survival lessons she will need to put to the test when her uncle inexplicably commits suicide. Mysterious assassins are now after her thanks to Jin-man&rsquo;s website &ldquo;Murthehelp,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s up to Ji-an to unlock its secrets and carry on its legacy.</p>
<p>Though Lee is perhaps best known for his supernatural romance roles in Goblin and Tale of the Nine-Tailed, he has also successfully tackled thriller and action genres in Strangers From Hell and Bad and Crazy. Despite his death at the start of A Shop for Killers, the prominent use of flashbacks allows his character to be fully fleshed out and gives him ample opportunity to show off his fighting skills. Meanwhile, Kim is an up-and-coming actor who made a strong impression in Netflix&rsquo;s zombie hit Kingdom, and her work as Ji-an further cements her talent.</p>
<pre><code>              10 Most Exciting K-Dramas Releasing In 2024 &amp; Beyond   The list of K-dramas releasing in 2024 and beyond includes long-awaited sequels like All of Us Are Dead season 2 but also new shows like Doctor Slump.   
</code></pre>
<p>Screen Rant interviewed A Shop for Killers&rsquo; leads about their most intense scenes in the Korean drama, the bond between uncle and niece after the former&rsquo;s death, and the most cherished characters in their filmography.</p>
<p>Lee Dong-wook &amp; Kim Hye-jun Talk A Shop For Killers</p>
<p>Screen Rant: Dong-wook, the scene where you and Jian are on the mountain left a really strong impression on viewers. Can you talk about your favorite moment filming either that scene or any other that spoke to you?</p>
<p>Lee Dong-wook: I think that was also one of my favorite moments with the adult Ji-an, the one in the mountains. What really intrigued me was how they scouted this location because there was no hiking trail up the mountain, so I was wondering how they found the spot. But it went really well with our show, the atmosphere, and everything, so I think that was fun.
My favorite moment with little Jian, played by the child actor Ahn Se-bin, is when she&rsquo;s locked up and I open the doors for her. That moment really pulled up my heartstrings, and Se-bin did so well. I think that&rsquo;s why I felt sadder and tearful. I would like to thank her for that too.</p>
<p>Hye-jun, Ji-an is really thrown into the action, but thankfully she has these lessons from her uncle. Can you talk about what you learned most as an actor or as an action actor from Dong-wook?</p>
<p>Kim Hye-jun: I had to learn the action skills from the stunt coordinator because that was the safest way to learn. But Dong-wook told me a lot about the attitude I should have as an actor doing action set pieces. He told me that even if I train really hard, I can&rsquo;t be a professional stunt actor. You have to act, not really do the action, and safety is your utmost priority.
I felt like he was rooting for me and cheering for me by giving me those words of encouragement because I was kind of worried that I might not pull this off, but he was always there telling me that there are so many people here to help you. You can do whatever you want, just be safe.
Lee Dong-wook: You should shed a tear or two.
Kim Hye-jun: Maybe later.</p>
<p>Speaking of the opposite of action, Dong-wook, it&rsquo;s really disconcerting to see you as a dead body so early on in the series. What&rsquo;s it like for you to play dead?</p>
<p>Lee Dong-wook: Yeah, it didn&rsquo;t really mean much to me because I have a lot of flashbacks. I have a lot of screen time. But when I was literally acting out the dead body, it was important that I stop breathing at the moment and make sure that you can&rsquo;t see my pulse in my neck. That was the important part.</p>
<p>Hye-jun, I was personally betrayed by Jung-min. Was it a surprise to you when you read the script? How does Ji-an feel right now, that the one person that she trusted is against her?</p>
<p>Kim Hye-jun: That appears at the end of episode 4 or beginning of episode 5, which is right in the middle of our narrative. When I was reading the script, I was completely shocked, and I thought it was very intriguing because while it&rsquo;s in the middle of the journey, it&rsquo;s the beginning of something totally new. As a reader of the script, I was very intrigued.
But as Ji-an, I felt very betrayed and felt like I was holding onto nothing. My only friend, as you said, that I trusted, is not there anymore for me. He betrayed me, and I thought about the choices that I made and how they were the wrong choices, so I thought of my uncle once again.</p>
<p>Do you each have a moment from the drama that was the most challenging for you to perform, whether it was emotionally or physically?</p>
<p>Lee Dong-wook: Instead of a challenging scene, I would say that there was a scene that was quite difficult for us to shoot location-wise. It&rsquo;s in episode 6, when Bale dies and we are burning off his belongings. That was on top of a warehouse, which was really high. It was 15 floors or maybe 20 floors high, and there were no safety railings there for us. It was very windy, so we thought it was really scary.
All of the actors there were like, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quickly get this done and just leave this place.&rdquo; But when we had to get up there and come down, it took so much time because it was just so high. We used a crane to get up there, and that was also a very scary experience.
Kim Hye-jun: I wouldn&rsquo;t pick a certain scene, but I think the entire production schedule was very physically challenging for me because I had the most days on set, and all those days were really packed with action. For a few weeks, I lived as Ji-an more than I lived as myself, Hye-jun, so it was very physically challenging.
But later on, I think that the physically challenging aspect really helped me get out the emotions in Ji-an. It created synergy, so it actually worked out well.</p>
<p>Finally, you both have a diverse filmography. Looking back on your roles, is there a character that you relate to most or that you think back most fondly on?</p>
<p>Lee Dong-wook: Instead of relating to this character, there is one who will always have a place in my heart. This was a character that I encountered when I was maybe 27 or 28. It was a show called La Dolce Vita, and I played the character Lee Joon-soo.
Joon-soo is scarred and haunted by a lot of things; he has been through a lot. At the end of the show, he commits suicide - so that&rsquo;s how he ends. I always have felt sorry for him and felt bad about him, so he always has this place in my heart.
Kim Hye-jun: I think the character that resembles me the most is Kwon Joo-ri in Another Child. It&rsquo;s a movie, and Joo-ri was there as a daughter of a father. I have really good relations with my father, so I think she really resembles me. I always think of her once in a while.</p>
