## Literature Review

Actress Sharon Stone recalls her failed attempt to make Barbie after pitching the film in the 1990s, saying she was &#34;laughed out&#34; by the studio.




Sharon Stone explains her failed attempt to make a Barbie movie back in the 1990s. The hugely successful Barbie movie finally came out in 2023, taking the box office by storm to become the highest-grossing film of the year. Barbie is directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach.




Stone reveals in a comment on Barbie star America Ferrera&#39;s Instagram that she previously tried to make a Barbie movie.


 

Even though Stone reportedly had “the support of the head of Barbie,” she was “laughed out” by the studio when she tried to pitch the film. Check out the full quote from Stone below:


I was laughed out [of] the studio when I came [with] the Barbie idea in the ’90s [with] the support of the head of Barbie. How far we’ve come. Thank you ladies for your courage and endurance.



 The Barbie Movie’s Multiple Pre-Greta Gerwig Attempts Explained 
         




Stone was not the only person who tried to make Barbie prior to Gerwig. At one point, a Barbie movie starring Amy Schumer was announced to be in development. That version of Barbie even attempted to get Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody attached to the project. The Schumer Barbie spent years in development hell before being shut down and eventually replaced by the Margot Robbie-led Barbie.

At one point, Anne Hathaway was also attached to a Barbie project. This film was to be directed by Australian filmmaker Alethea Jones and its story would have centered around Barbie being kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough. Both Hathaway and Schumer, despite their Barbie films being shut down, have gone on to praise Robbie’s work in the role.

                  The Barbie Movie Cast &amp; Character Guide   Led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the Barbie movie&#39;s cast is full of A-list actors playing either toy-based characters or original creations.   




Stone did not reveal details as to the plot of her would-be Barbie project, but it is nonetheless interesting to think about iterations of the film dating back to the ‘90s. Ultimately, 2023 was the perfect time for Barbie to be released. Not only is there better support now for women-led projects than there was 30 years ago, but movies like The LEGO Movie have proven that films based on toys, as unlikely as they may seem, can be successful. Succeed it did, as Gerwig’s Barbie received universal acclaim.
