Summary

  The show&#39;s protagonists, Arisu and Usagi, are both complex characters who inspire others to keep fighting.   The supporting cast includes fan-favorite characters like Chishiya, Kuina, and Ann.   Alice in Borderland season 3 will likely have an original story, as the first two seasons covered all of the manga, and it will be interesting to see which characters will return.  







Alice in Borderland’s cast of characters features compelling protagonists and fan-favorite anti-heroes, from Arisu and his friends to the citizens, all of whom are played by great actors. Following a short anime adaptation, Haro Aso’s Alice in Borderland manga received the live-action treatment with a Netflix series that premiered on December 10, 2020. The first two seasons covered all of the manga, and the upcoming Alice in Borderland season 3 is expected to be an original story.

Most of the Alice in Borderland characters have Alice in Wonderland counterparts, including the show’s protagonists. Arisu and Usagi are the show’s leads, but Alice in Borderland also features an extensive set of supporting characters. Although some of them died in season 1, season 2 welcomed a lot of new names.


 Kento Yamazaki as Ryohei Arisu 
Also known for Death Note (2015), Orange, Kingdom, Good Doctor
         




The “Alice” of Alice in Borderland, Arisu is the show’s main character and serves as the audience’s eyes inside the Borderland. Whereas most of the characters arrived in the Borderland before the events of the show and therefore already knew how everything worked, Arisu and his friends had to learn how to survive in this strange world. A fan of video games in the real world, Arisu has a complicated relationship with his dad. Aside from his brother, his real family were his friends – Chota and Karube. Despite going through terrible things in the Borderland, Arisu never gives up on returning home and inspires other characters to keep fighting.



 Tao Tsuchiya as Yuzuha Usagi 
Also known for Rurouni Kenshin Movies, The 8-Year Engagement, The Cinderella Addiction
         

The “rabbit” of Alice in Borderland, Usagi is an athlete who will always perform well in physically demanding games. She is also one of the most complex characters on the show and arrived in the Borderland before Arisu. Although Usagi had already learned how to survive day by day in the Borderland, her life took a turn after the arrival of Arisu. Together, they unveiled the mystery of the Beach and realized going back home would be more difficult than they thought. Usagi entered the Borderland not too long after her father took his own life following accusations of fraud, which is why she would often ponder whether returning to the real world was worth it.




                  All 4 Movies &amp; TV Shows Starring Kento Yamazaki &amp; Tao Tsuchiya (Including Alice In Borderland)   Whether they’re starring together in a movie or a TV show, Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya have a star power that shines incredibly bright.    



 Nijiro Murakami as Shuntaro Chishiya 
Also known for Isle Of Dogs, Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning, MIU 404, Tokyo Revengers 2: Bloody Halloween’s Part 1 &amp; 2
          

A fan-favorite Alice in Borderland character, Chishiya was introduced at the beginning of season 1 as a mysterious character tied to a place known as the Beach. Arisu and Usagi would meet him again a couple of episodes later, during which it was revealed that Chishiya was one of the Beach executives. Chishiya is constantly playing a game of survival, and every action he takes is carefully calculated. As a result, the character can be described as an anti-hero. Chishiya was part of Alice in Borderland’s best games, namely the Jack of Hearts and the King of Diamonds, both of which highlight how great of a character he is.






 Aya Asahina as Hikari Kuina 
Also known for Tokyo Alice, Girl Gun Lady, Red Shoes
          

Kuina was introduced midway through Alice in Borderland season 1 as one of the citizens of the Beach. Always by Chishiya’s side, Kuina was more experienced regarding the inner workings of the Borderland compared to Arisu or even Usagi. She usually knows exactly where to go and what to do, and she is also the only friend Chishiya has in that world. Unlike her father, Kuina’s mother always accepted her for who she was. She spent most of season 2 looking for her mother but could not find her. Although Kuina stole the show in Alice in Borderland season 2, she sadly didn’t reunite with Chishiya.



 Ayaka Miyoshi as Ann Rizuna 
Also known for Inuyashiki, Dance with Me, Bakumatsu Gourmet Bushi Meshi!
          




Alice in Borderland introduced a lot of important characters during the Beach segment of season 1, including Ann, one of the executives. During the Witch Hunt game, it was revealed that Ann was a foresense scientist working for the police in the real world. During season 2, driven by her scientific background, Ann had a hypothesis about how the world of Borderland worked and tried to prove it. She spent most of the season searching for the borders of that world to see if there was anything else beyond it. Ann also connected with Kuina during season 2, and they fought together against one of the show’s final bosses.



 Dori Sakurada as Suguru Niragi 
Also known for Hana Nochi Hare: Hanadan Next Season, Even: Kimi ni Okuru Uta
          

Niragi is one of Alice in Borderland’s most despicable villains. He was part of the Beach militia and helped Aguni orchestrate a cue following the death of the Hatter. Niragi tried to assault Usagi twice and killed countless people during the Witch Hunt game. Although he was seemingly burned alive by Chishiya, the character survived and returned in season 1. The actor does a great job of portraying the villain, especially during Alice in Borderland season 2&#39;s ending. Niragi was one of the final obstacles the main characters faced before they met the Queen of Hearts for the last game.






 Alice In Borderland&#39;s Supporting Cast &amp; Characters 
          

Sho Aoyagi as Morizono Aguni: The leader of the Beach’s militia. Aguni was the Hatter’s best friend in the real world and helped him establish the Beach. However, after realizing his friend had become a threat not only to himself but to others, Aguni ended up having to kill the Hatter. Driven by remorse, he killed dozens of people during the Witch Hunt and seemingly died at the end of the game. However, Aguni returns in season 2, during which he helps Arisu take down the King of Spades.

Yūki Morinaga as Chota Segawa: One of Arisu’s best friends. Chota did not have much confidence in himself but was always there for Arisu. During the tragic Seven of Hearts game, Chota selflessly gave up his life so that Arisu would live. Even though he died in season 1, episode 3, Chota continued to appear in visions and flashbacks.




Keita Machida as Daikichi Karube: Also one of Arisu’s best friends. Always with a positive attitude and often looking for trouble, Karube was the “cool kid” of the trio. He was the first to realize he and Chota would have to die if they wanted Arisu to survive. Karube’s death is one of the most tragic Alice in Borderland scenes, but he would appear again in Arisu’s visions and flashback sequences.

                  Alice In Borderland Season 2’s Joker Card Finally Makes Sense Almost 1 Year Later   Alice in Borderland season 2 shrouded the Joker card&#39;s meaning in mystery, but its significance is now finally starting to make sense after one year.    

Riisa Naka as Mira/Queen of Hearts: One of the executives of the Beach but also one of the Borderland’s citizens. The end of Alice in Borderland season 1 revealed that Mira was much more than just an executive of the Beach – she was the Queen of Hearts. In other words, she is the one who created every Hearts game, including the Seven Of Hearts. Mira was the final citizen Arisu and Usagi had to face in season 2.




Nobuaki Kaneko as The Hatter: The creator of the Beach. Despite appearing to be a funny and happy person, the Hatter was soon revealed to be a threat. Once a good person runs a small shop, the Hatter lets the power get to his head and begins to rule the Beach through cruelty. Despite his death in season 1, the Hatter appeared in season 2 during visions Aguni was having.

Yuri Tsunematsu as Akane Heiya: The Archer of Alice in Borderland. When the comet hit, Heiya was hanging out with her friends but entered the Borderland alone. Her leg got hurt after the very first game, and she had to amputate it to survive. It is unclear how much time passed for Heiya between her first game and the events of season 2, but by the time Arisu meets her, she has become a skillful survivor and mastered lethal archery techniques.

Tsuyoshi Abe as Keiichi/King Of Diamonds: Similar to Mira, Keiichi was introduced as an executive of the Beach but hid a much more sinister secret. His identity as the King of Diamonds was revealed in season 2 during the Beauty Contest game. Thanks to Chishiya, the King of Diamonds reconsidered some of his opinions about the purpose of life.




Tomohisa Yamashita as Kyuma/King Of Clubs: The first Borderland citizen Arisu properly encounters in season 2. Kyuma was the leading vocal of a band in the real world and continued to work with his band members in the Borderland. His way of perceiving the world differed from the rest of the Alice in Borderland citizens, resulting in him having some of the best lines of dialogue of season 2.



Alice in Borderland is streaming on Netflix.
