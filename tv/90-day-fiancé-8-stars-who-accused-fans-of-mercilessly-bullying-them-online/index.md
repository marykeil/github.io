## Literature Review
There are 90 Day Fiancé cast members who have called out their own fans for making negative comments about them online and giving them mental turmoil.




This article contains discussions of sexual assault. 

90 Day Fiancé cast members aren’t always getting the love and support of the show’s viewers. A cast member is crowned the hero or villain of their storyline within a few episodes. When viewers decide that they don’t like a particular reality TV show star, they certainly let the cast member know about it. While they believe the criticism might help this villainous cast member clean up their act, the stars often resort to slamming the fans instead.
Some cast members choose to ignore the hate, but others aren’t afraid to call out their critics and trolls online for their menacing comments. Despite the negativity, these cast members stand tall to let the trolls know that harassment won’t stop them from doing what they think is right. Sadly, there are a few 90 Day Fiancé cast members who have opened up about being mentally affected by the hate they get from people they choose to share their stories with.









 








 8  Mary Demasu-ay 


Mary from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way recently alluded to intense bullying from fans online. Mary is a 23-year-old from the Philippines who appears in season 5 of the reality TV show. Mary met Brandan DeNuccio on a dating app two years before filming took place. Mary and Brandan continued dating long distance while staying on video calls for the whole day. They even ate and slept while on video calls until Brandan moved to Candoni. Mary and Brandan were slammed for being immature because Mary became pregnant with Brandan’s baby within three months of his moving there.
The couple had no stable source of income and hence were criticized for not having planned things out before having a child. However, Mary also received mean comments about her appearance on social media for no reason at all. Mary shared one such meme where she was made to look like a clown. “Hope you guys are happy now bullying someone’s physical appearance and making fun of them,” Mary wrote in her caption (as shared by Ok-Station-4445.) She wrote that she is now “suffering from depression and crying every day nonstop” because of fans reminding her that she is “not pretty.”





 7  Big Ed Brown 
        

Big Ed was introduced to fans in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4. Big Ed was dating Rosemarie Vega from the Philippines. Big Ed has a condition known as Klippel-Feil Syndrome. The rare genetic defect makes him look like he has no neck because two of the seven bones in his neck have been fused. Big Ed’s appearance has led to fans calling him “No neck Ed” on the internet. During his interview with The Night Time Show podcast (via People) in 2020, Big Ed said, “I was teased about my neck since I was 5 years old.” He added, “People aren’t comfortable when they see something that’s not normal.”





 6  Angela Deem 


90 Day Fiancé star Angela has been accused of being a bully by fans thanks to her abusive antics on the show. Angela has verbally bullied and attacked cast members during Tell-Alls or recently in 90 Day: The Last Resort. She gets hate for the way she tries to control Michael Ilesanmi in their relationship. However, Angela herself claims she’s been bullied by fans on social media. In June 2021, Angela told a fan, “#cancelimnotgoingnowhereIDIOT” (via Monsters &amp; Critics.) Also, earlier this year, Angela took revenge on a person who called her an “old hag” by naming and shaming them on her personal Instagram.





 5  Jasmine Pineda 
        

Jasmine has been dealing with a lot of online bullying in 2023 ever since it was revealed that she’s now moved to America. Her bullies keep asking her to go back to her country in her Instagram comments. Jasmine has been accused of being a gold digger, and some fans think Gino could do much better by leaving Jasmine. Jasmine has been dealing with fans who wish her “[death] and even worse things.” The hate she’s getting has started to affect her so badly that she’s even afraid of opening her DMs. Jasmine recently lashed out at an immigration agent for coming to her social media and promoting hate speech.





 4  Miona Bell 


Miona’s social media followers now are more concerned about knowing if she is getting divorced. However, there was a time when Miona had to read such mean comments that she developed anxiety because of them. In October 2022, Miona made a video where she asked herself if being on reality TV was worth it in the end. “I spent months crying and dealing with anxiety because of internet abuse,” Miona wrote in her caption. Miona had been accused of blackfishing upon her debut. Jibri asked fans to show some love for Miona because she was getting death threats in April 2022.





 3  Kalani Faagata 
        

Kalani is divorcing her husband on 90 Day: The Last Resort. She has revealed that Asuelu cheated on her more than 10 times, and she eventually fell in love with a man named Dallas Nuez. Kalani’s decision to choose Dallas over Asuelu is not something that all her fans agree with. In October 2023, Kalani revealed she was getting rape and death threats because of what was shown about her on TV. Kalani went on to imply that Asuelu had impregnated her via sexual assault. Kalani wished to “clear some things up” for people who asked her to “keep [her] legs shut.”





 2  Scott Wern 
        

Scott is a newbie in the world of 90 Day Fiancé. He became famous for dating Pedro Jimeno’s mom Lidia Morel on 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise. Scott crushed Lidia’s heart when he chose to break up with her to date a younger ex-girlfriend. Moreover, Scott began flirting with other female cast members on Instagram. He openly asked Tiffany out on a date, offending franchise fans. Fans wrote comments in favor of Lidia on Scott’s Instagram. He warned his critics that he was going to block and delete them. He didn’t want to see or hear anything from negative fans and asked the trolls to not follow him anymore.





 1  Larissa Lima 
        

Like Scott, Larissa also became a target for online trolls during her 90 Day Fiancé stint and even after she was reportedly asked to leave the franchise. The relentless criticism and bullying didn’t stop despite Larissa’s exit. Larissa was getting hate for launching an online adult modeling job. “Now that I am emancipated and independent, I make decisions for myself, including how I choose to earn money. I will not tolerate any more bullying,” Larissa wrote on Instagram. She said her target audience was now adults, and her main focus had shifted to OnlyFans.
Larissa warned her critics that she was only going to post OnlyFans-related content on her Instagram. It may not have come as a shock to 90 Day Fiancé fans because Larissa had already been flaunting her body on social media after spending thousands to look like Kylie Jenner. Larissa told her critics that the hate between them was mutual. She told them that none of the viewers who wrote loathing comments or messages about her had the right to judge her. “This level of virtual harassment is completely out of control,” Larissa said in her post caption.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
