# No Actor Has Ever Been Nominated For An Oscar For 1 Type Of Acting Role (&amp; 2024 Should Change That)


## SUMMARY 



  No actor has ever been nominated for an Oscar for a voice-acting performance in the 95-year history of the Academy Awards.   The lack of recognition for voice-acting performances is a long-standing issue, even though there have been deserving performances in the past, like Robin Williams as Genie in Aladdin.   The introduction of a Best Voice-Acting Performance category at the Oscars would give voice actors the recognition they deserve and help elevate animated movies.

## Literature Review

There is one type of acting role that no actor has ever received an Oscar nomination for, but the 2024 Oscars have the opportunity to change that.




There is one type of acting performance for which no actor has ever been nominated at the Oscars, but the 2024 Oscars could change that. Awards season has been flying by, but the biggest awards show of them all is still a few months away. Oscar nominations will be announced on January 23, 2024, followed by the official Oscars ceremony on March 10, 2024. 2023 was an especially amazing year for film, which means each category at the 2024 Oscars is sure to be stacked with talented and deserving candidates.




Among the predicted nominees for the 2024 Oscars are actors who played a variety of different roles in 2023 films. Some played real people, such as the stars of Oppenheimer, Maestro, and Killers of the Flower Moon, while others played new versions of pre-existing characters, like the Barbies and Kens in Barbie. These and many other types of roles have been recognized by the Oscars countless times, but there is one specific type of acting role for which an actor has never earned an Oscar nomination.



The 96th Academy Awards ceremony will air March 10, 2024, at 7pm EST on ABC.





 No Actor Has Ever Been Nominated For An Oscar For A Voice-Acting Performance 
They&#39;re eligible but have never been nominated
          

In the Oscars&#39; 95-year history, no actor has ever been nominated for a voice-acting performance. Voice-acting and voice-over performances are eligible for Oscars, but every year, the Academy continues to overlook them. It&#39;s not that there have never been voice-over actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances; it&#39;s just that the Academy has opted not to nominate them. Standout performances like Robin Williams as Genie in 1992&#39;s Aladdin and James Earl Jones as Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise have continuously been overshadowed by live-action, visible performances in film.




The closest an actor ever came to an Oscar nomination for a voice-acting performance was Eddie Murphy for his role in Shrek. Murphy was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the BAFTA Awards for voicing Donkey in the 2001 DreamWorks animated movie, a rarity for an animated role. Shrek was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and even won the first-ever award for Best Animated Feature at the 2002 Oscars, but Murphy&#39;s performance was not nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, continuing the Oscars&#39; failure to recognize worthy voice-acting performances.

                  11 Oscars Achievements That Still Haven&#39;t Happened After 95 Years   The Oscars is the most prestigious event in Hollywood, but in 95 years of running, it has yet to make several achievements into a reality.   



 Why The Oscars Should Create A Best Voice-Acting Performance Category 
Voice actors deserve recognition too
         




With all the incredible voice-acting performances in films over the years, the Oscars are long overdue for a Best Voice-Acting Performance category. Every year, more and more praiseworthy acting performances get ignored or dismissed because they&#39;re in animated films or they&#39;re only voices in live-action films. Introducing a separate category for voice work at the Oscars would allow voice actors to receive the recognition they deserve without sacrificing any equally deserving live-action performers in the existing acting categories.

While accolades like the Annie Awards, which honor American animated film and television, recognize voice-acting performances, these aren&#39;t nearly as high profile as the Oscars. It&#39;s been 23 years since the Best Animated Feature category was first introduced at the Oscars, which means it&#39;s time for the Oscars to create a new category for voice-acting performances. Doing so would help animated movies be taken more seriously and given more respect and praise.




However, eligibility shouldn&#39;t be limited to animated movie roles. Live-action vocal performances in which the actor never appears onscreen should qualify for consideration as well. This would include actors voicing characters visually portrayed by CGI or puppetry, such as Andy Serkis as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings movies or Frank Oz as Yoda in Star Wars and some of The Muppets characters. Narrators would also be included, as well as disembodied voices like Scarlett Johansson as the AI virtual assistant, Samantha, in 2013&#39;s Her, for instance.

                  This 104-Year-Old Actor Set Multiple Oscars Records That Have Yet To Be Beaten   One Old Hollywood actor who lived to be 104 years old set multiple Oscar records during her long life, none of which have been beaten to this day.   



 A Voice-Acting Performance Should Finally Be Nominated At The 2024 Oscars 
There were tons of Oscar-worthy voice-acting performances in 2023 movies
          




Of course, it&#39;s too late in the game for the Academy to introduce a separate Best Voice-Acting or Voice-over Performance category at the upcoming 2024 Oscars. However, that doesn&#39;t mean voice-acting performances should keep getting overlooked this year. 2024 could finally be the year that the Oscars break the mold and nominate a voice-acting performance for the very first time.

One 2023 movie that featured some incredible voice-acting performances was Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the sequel to 2018&#39;s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Both films explore the Spider-Man multiverse, featuring different iterations of the Marvel superhero and associated characters in various animation styles and voiced by different actors. Across the Spider-Verse saw the return of actors like Shameik Moore as Miles Morales and Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, both of whom are worthy candidates for an Oscar nomination for their voice work in the film. 

Another actor who deserves some Oscars recognition for his voice work in a 2023 film is Robert Pattinson, who went above and beyond as the voice of the Grey Heron in the English dub of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s animated Japanese film, The Boy and the Heron. Pattinson completely transformed his voice into the deep, gravelly, and threatening voice of the Heron. The result is unrecognizable from what Pattinson normally sounds like. He should be considered for his dedication alone, but the stellar voice-acting performance he delivered should earn him a nomination at the 2024 Oscars.




Unfortunately, the nomination voting period concluded on January 16, 2024, which means it&#39;s unlikely that Moore, Steinfeld, Pattinson, or any other actor who gave an impressive vocal performance in a 2023 film will be nominated at the 2024 Oscars. It&#39;s a long shot, but it&#39;s possible that the Academy members decided to go ahead and nominate a voice-acting performance for the first time at the 2024 Oscars. Not only would this make Oscars history, but it would also bring the Academy one step closer to creating a separate category at the Oscars just for voice-acting performances.
