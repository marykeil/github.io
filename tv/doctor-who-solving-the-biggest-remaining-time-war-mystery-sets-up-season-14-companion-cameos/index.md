# Doctor Who Solving The Biggest Remaining Time War Mystery Sets Up Season 14 Companion Cameos


## SUMMARY 



  The Time War, a major event in Doctor Who, is being tied in with the classic run of the show in a new BBC short, revealing more about the conflict.   The new short featuring Leela, a companion of the Fourth Doctor, suggests that the Doctor distributed devices called Wayfinders to save people during the Time War.   Leela&#39;s survival opens the door for other characters to return to Doctor Who, including Romana and possibly the Doctor&#39;s biological family members, adding new dynamics to the show.

## Literature Review
Doctor Who&#39;s Time War is a central part of the Doctor Who canon, and its presence in the modern era may have allowed the return of a familiar face.




The Last Great Time War is a cornerstone of lore for the modern era of Doctor Who, and the franchise may have just tied the conflict in with the classic run of the show going into its new season. Despite having a huge impact on the world of Doctor Who, there are still many unanswered questions about the famous conflict. The Time War broke the Doctor, and between the Time Lords and the Daleks, it caused the loss of a great many lives. However, the Doctor has often been sparing with the details of who exactly they lost.




The Time War was introduced in Doctor Who&#39;s 2005 revival. Before the return of the show, the last installment was Paul McGann&#39;s 1996 Doctor Who TV movie. As such, the War retroactively took place between the events of McGann&#39;s debut as the Eighth Doctor and the arrival of Christopher Eccleston. The War is referenced throughout the revival era, but it wasn&#39;t shown on-screen until Doctor Who&#39;s 50th-anniversary special, &#34;The Day of the Doctor.&#34; Scenes on the Doctor&#39;s home world of Gallifrey have since become more common, and the BBC&#39;s YouTube channel has recently uploaded a short featuring footage from the heart of the action ahead of Doctor Who season 14.

                  Doctor Who: Every Doctor &amp; Who Played Them (In Chronological Order)   Doctor Who has been played by a crop of fantastic actors going back several decades, and each version has been both unique and memorable.    


 The Fourth Doctor Saved Leela From Dying During The Time War (&amp; Others?) 
The intervention from Tom Baker&#39;s Doctor has been revealed
         




The BBC short, &#34;Leela vs the Time War,&#34; shows Louise Jameson&#39;s return to the franchise. Leela traveled with Tom Baker&#39;s Fourth Doctor, eventually falling in love with another Time Lord and settling on Gallifrey. &#34;Leela vs the Time War&#34; would seem to line up with &#34;The Day of the Doctor,&#34; as the Fourth Doctor&#39;s presence is confirmed during the War in the show&#39;s 50th-anniversary special. As Leela watches the Citadel fall to Dalek forces, she&#39;s approached by a Gallifreyan soldier who gives her a device called a Wayfinder. The soldier informs Leela that the device is from the Doctor and that she is to survive.

Leela uses the Wayfinder, which acts as a teleporter, allowing her to take refuge in the Fourth Doctor&#39;s TARDIS. Although the short has been released to promote the next remastered installment of Doctor Who&#39;s classic era, events are so meticulously scripted that it would be difficult to see the addition as anything other than part of the official canon. If so, then the Doctor could have distributed Wayfinders to others on Gallifrey whom he wished to be saved. While this could include other companions from the classic era like Romana, a fellow Time Lord, it&#39;s possible that the Doctor could also have chosen to save family members.






 Leela&#39;s Survival Sets Up More Doctor Who Cameos In Season 14 
Louise Jameson&#39;s return opens the door for other characters to come back to Doctor Who
          

The fact that Leela has been confirmed to have survived the violence on Gallifrey makes it possible for Louise Jameson to once more reprise her role in Doctor Who itself. A run-in with Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor in season 14 would mean centuries passing for Fifteen while Leela is still within her comparatively short human lifespan. Such a cameo would make for an interesting dynamic between Leela and the show&#39;s title character. Similarly, another meeting between the Doctor and Romana would make for exciting viewing. Romana also being a Time Lord allows the show to recast the part due to her ability to regenerate.

As well as classic companions, Leela&#39;s survival and the implication of other Wayfinders could allow for the debut of characters who have only ever been mentioned in passing. For instance, the Doctor mentions that he was once a father in Doctor Who season 2, episode 11, &#34;Fear Her.&#34; The claim is also reinforced by the fact that William Hartnell&#39;s First Doctor traveled with Susan, his granddaughter.




As a Gallifreyan herself, it&#39;s possible that Susan was also on her home world at the same time as Leela, and also supplied with a Wayfinder. So, Leela may not be the only character capable of making a return to Doctor Who. Susan and other blood relations of the Doctor could also make their way back into the show. The introduction of additional biological family members of the Doctor could transform the title character&#39;s relationship with their past.



 Why The Time War Is Still So Important To Doctor Who Almost 20 Years Later 
Doctor Who&#39;s famous conflict is still offering new storylines
          

Despite largely taking place in the background, The Time War continues to crop up in Doctor Who and inject new life into the show. For example, it became the focal point for the 50th anniversary of the show. The War was also a great building block when it came to bringing the show back in 2005. Having the Doctor as the last Time Lord added a new layer to a very old character.




                  Doctor Who&#39;s Time War Secretly Began In A Seventh Doctor TV Story   Although he didn&#39;t give the command, the Seventh Doctor is responsible for the start of the Last Great Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks.    

The nature of the War has also fluctuated over time, both in terms of the show&#39;s lore and in how prominent it has been in the story. While having the Doctor alone for a time did wonders for their character, the return of the Time War and the Gallifreyans at large also offer a compelling emotional journey for the Doctor. So, even after so long, the Last Great Time War still has plenty left to offer the rich tapestry of Doctor Who, as proven by the recent rescue of Leela from the Time Lord battlefield.



Classic episodes of Doctor Who are streaming on Tubi, and the 2005 revival era is on Max. The 60th-anniversary specials and the 2023 Christmas special, &#34;The Church of Ruby Road,&#34; are Disney&#43;, which is where all future episodes will be available.
