# There s Only 1 Way An Uncle Fester Spinoff Could Work (&amp; Wednesday Teased The Idea)


## SUMMARY 



  An Uncle Fester spinoff ignores what made Wednesday successful unless it focuses on younger characters.   A prequel with a younger Fester and Thing as his sidekick would be a different and appealing concept for the franchise.   To appeal to the same demographic, a Wednesday spinoff should showcase Fester&#39;s journey as a young adult and explore Thing&#39;s origins.

## Literature Review
Netflix is considering an Uncle Fester spinoff, but Wednesday season 1 already hinted how the idea could work as a new Addams Family show.




There&#39;s only one plausible way to make an Addams Family spinoff focused on Uncle Fester work, and Wednesday subtly teased the idea. Over a year after Wednesday season 1 released, reports revealed that Netflix is developing an Uncle Fester spinoff, but the project is still in the early stages. Though Uncle Fester is a fan favorite among Addams Family fans, he only had a small role in Wednesday, which is understandable considering the show primarily centered on the titular teen played by Jenna Ortega. In the most recent franchise title, Fred Armisen portrayed Fester Addams, one of the few who could make Wednesday smile.




Despite the intriguing bond between Wednesday and her uncle, a Fester spinoff seems to ignore what made Wednesday so successful. The Jenna Ortega-led show quickly became one of Netflix&#39;s most successful titles in the show&#39;s history, with anticipation for Wednesday season 2 only growing as time goes on. Granted, the show clearly grabbed the attention of the younger demographic, as proven by the viral dance stemming from Wednesday&#39;s memorable performance during a school function. Granted, the show still teased how an Uncle Fester spinoff could work.

                  Wednesday Season 2 (&amp; Jenna Ortega) Have A Completely Different Challenge To Overcome Than Season 1   Wednesday season 2 and the showâ€™s star, Jenna Ortega, have new challenges for the follow-up installment, mirroring another Netflix series.    


 Netflix&#39;s Wednesday Spinoff Should Be An Uncle Fester Prequel With Thing 
          




Rather than feature an older version of Uncle Fester as seen in Wednesday, a spinoff should center on a younger version of the odd Addams Family character with Thing as his sidekick. When Fester first appeared in Wednesday episode 7, he was hiding out before it was clarified that he was actually a criminal mastermind. He still had his electricity powers and creepy traits, but his extensive criminal background added new appeal. A prequel following Uncle Fester&#39;s criminal escapades would be something different enough for the franchise while still incorporating beloved figures and elements.

In Wednesday, Uncle Fester and Thing were partners in crime, so a prequel could easily include the severed hand. There was also talk of a previous Kalamazoo job gone wrong that possibly soured their criminal partnership. A spinoff could shed more light on Fester and Thing&#39;s past while also showing their criminal adventures and schemes over the years. Seeing as Wednesday&#39;s version of Uncle Fester carried more confidence than past portrayals, and Thing had a bigger personality than most human characters on TV, throwing the two together in precarious situations could be an excellent foundation for a TV show.






 Why Netflix Would Need To Focus On A Younger Uncle Fester To Work 
          

As mentioned, for an Uncle Fester spinoff to truly work, the show must take pages out of Wednesday&#39;s playbook by primarily focusing on younger characters. A younger actor in the role of Fester Addams would also be in tune with Wednesday&#39;s flashbacks featuring young Morticia and Gomez during their time at Nevermore Academy. Though a spinoff wouldn&#39;t need to involve the school, showing Fester&#39;s journey as a young adult would still do the trick to appeal to the same demographic that led to Wednesday&#39;s massive popularity.

A prequel could also dive deeper into Thing&#39;s origins. Then again, any screentime given to the sentient hand would be satisfying enough, considering how much of a scene-stealer Wednesday&#39;s version of Thing had become. Granted, even if a younger actor is cast as Fester Addams for a spinoff, there&#39;s no reason Armisen couldn&#39;t reprise his role in Wednesday season 2 or other franchise projects that Netflix develops. This could just be the start of an even more expansive Addams Family universe for Netflix.
