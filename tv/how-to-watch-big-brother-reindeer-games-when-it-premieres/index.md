## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games is a new holiday-themed reality competition show featuring nine BB legends. Here&#39;s how to watch and when it premieres.




Big Brother Reindeer Games is a new holiday-themed reality competition show featuring nine Big Brother legends, and there are a few ways to watch, beginning with the premiere. The cast features Britney Haynes, Cameron Hardin, Cody Calafiore, Danielle Reyes, Frankie Grande, Josh Martinez, Nicole Franzel, Taylor Hale, and Xavier Prather. Unlike a regular Big Brother season, there will be no live feeds because the contestants won&#39;t be living in the house. Instead, it will be a show with pre-taped competitions.




Big Brother Reindeer Games will have a total of six episodes. Julie Chen Moonves won&#39;t be hosting, but rather Big Brother icons Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will serve as &#34;Santa&#39;s Elves,&#34; guiding the players through each episode. In each show, the contestants will play in three competitions that will culminate in &#34;Santa&#39;s Showdown,&#34; which determines which player will be eliminated. Four players will compete in the December 21 finale. The winner will take home the $100,000 grand prize.
