## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Christine Brown and her new love David Woolley are sharing more details about their wedding ahead of the upcoming two-part special.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown and her new husband David Woolley may have been married just a few short months ago, but they’re revealing all the details about their wedding before the two-part special airs in January. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Christine’s life has changed tremendously and her openness toward dating has been gradually building throughout the season. For Christine, meeting David and getting swept into a whirlwind romance wasn’t something she expected, but it was exciting to see her fall in love so quickly and so seriously. While their relationship may have moved quickly, Christine and David’s wedding was a celebration of their pure love for each other.




In the final installment of Sister Wives: One On One, Christine introduced David to the audience along with host Sukanya Krishnan, and the two dished about their relationship. At the time, they were only engaged and planning their wedding, so they were happy to share the details. Christine explained that while she would be inviting Janelle Brown to the wedding, she wouldn’t be inviting Meri Brown, Robyn Brown, or her ex-husband Kody Brown. Surprisingly, Christine shared she was planning to have Kody and Meri’s child, Leon Brown, at the wedding with their partner Audrey Kriss and the other Brown children.

Christine and David, who are both parents of large families, shared that their wedding would be centered around their kids and grandkids. Both were excited to bring their families together, building what they hoped to be a sense of unity in their blended family. On top of the Brown children being invited to the event, Christine revealed that she would be including Kody’s siblings and mother. After having a close relationship to Kody’s family, she explained that while her ex-husband wouldn’t be invited, she would be inviting the family she’d gained through their marriage despite moving on to a new husband. Both were excited on Sister Wives season 18, episode 18.





 

While Christine didn’t invite Kody, Robyn, or Meri to her and David’s intimate wedding ceremony, she did make some interesting decisions surrounding her guest list. While speaking out about Christine and David’s relationship and sharing her support during Sister Wives: One On One, Meri said she wasn’t hurt about being snubbed from the event. She explained that because of how intimate and special of a day a wedding is, she understood the choice to leave someone without close ties to the couple out of the celebration. While Meri wasn’t invited, she wished Christine and David nothing but the best and shared she hoped for her own love in the future.
