## Literature Review
Eight couples who began dating after meeting on Survivor are still together. Dee Valladeres and Austin Li Coon from season 4 are the newest pair.




Survivor season 45 features a classic showmance between contestants Austin Li Coon and Dee Valladeres, and eight past couples are still together. The two have been working together since the beginning of the game, both starting on the same tribe. Week by week, they worked together to eliminate, often by blindsiding other contestants. Both are currently part of the final five contestants vying for the million dollars and the title of sole survivor.
Aside from their compatibility in the game, there&#39;s an undeniable chemistry and romantic connection between Dee and Austin. In a game, in which strong partnerships are the difference between winning or losing, this alliance has served them both well. Regardless of the outcome of the game, only time will tell if Dee and Austin have the staying power of the following eight Survivor couples that have lasted long after the cameras stopped rolling.

 8  Elizabeth Beisel &amp; Jack Nichting 
Survivor Season 39


Elizabeth Beisel and Jack Nichting didn&#39;t make it to the end of Survivor: Island Of Idols, but they found love on the show. They posted the announcement of their relationship on Instagram the day after the season finale, which neither of them attended. This was likely due to an incident on the show, which involved Elizabeth&#39;s sexual misconduct claims against another contestant.
Elizabeth wrote, “WOAH. Did you guys hear the news? I’ve got a curly haired boyfriend named Jack and he is simply the most wonderful human being I know.” While Jack wrote, “I am beyond proud to call this curly headed, exuberant, and compassionate woman my girlfriend/twin.” Just last August, Jack again professed his love for Elizabeth on Instagram as he celebrated her birthday.





 7  Jenna Bowman &amp; Sebastian Lowe 
Survivor Season 36


For Jenna Bowman and Sebastian Lowe, it was love at first sight. They met on the flight to Fiji to film Survivor: Ghost Island in 2017. The two sat together and talked for the entire flight. Worried that their romance might make them a common target in the game, they kept the relationship private while filming the show. Sharing a love of travel and adventure, they have gone on several trips around the world, which they have documented on their YouTube channel, Seb And Jen.





 6  Joe Anglim &amp; Sierra Dawn Thomas 
Survivor Season 30


 







Though Joe Anglim and Sierra Dawn Thomas met while filming Survivor: World&#39;s Apart in 2014, they didn’t actually start dating until several years later. They weren&#39;t a match on the show, never voted together, and played in competing alliances. Sierra was one of the votes that eliminated Joe. After the show finished filming, they both found themselves at the airport heading home when Sierra helped Joe download Snapchat so they could stay in touch. They spent several years getting to know each other slowly this way. The couple has been married for more than three years now and are proud parents to two kids.





 5  Jon Misch &amp; Jaclyn Schultz 
Survivor Season 29
        

Jon Misch and Jaclyn Schultz were already dating when they competed on Survivor: San Juan del Sur. It was a Blood vs. Water season, which means players competed against their loved ones. Though neither of them won the million dollars and the title of sole survivor, their relationship survived and got married in 2015. In 2021, the couple welcomed their first child together via surrogacy. Jaclyn suffers from Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome, which affects a woman&#39;s reproduction. Using her platform to spread awareness, Jaclyn has been very public about their reproductive struggles, which tragically included a baby that didn&#39;t survive, two surrogates, and several rounds of IVF.





 4  Tyson Apostol &amp; Rachel Foulger 
Survivor Season 27


 







Tyson Apostol and Rachel Foulger were already dating when they competed together on Survivor: Blood vs. Water in 2013, which Tyson ended up winning. It was his third time playing Survivor and he&#39;d go on to eventually play a fourth time, boasting one of the biggest count of days played in Survivor history. The couple then appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars and got engaged during the show’s finale. They eventually tied the knot in March 2015, with Tyson’s Survivor: Tocantins co-star, Stephen Fishbach, officiating the ceremony. Soon after their wedding, Rachel gave birth to their first child and eventually welcomed a second.





 3  Whitney Duncan &amp; Keith Tollefson 
Survivor Season 23


Whitney Duncan and Keith Tollefson&#39;s relationship started in 2011, near the end of the season of Survivor: South Pacific. At the time, Whitney was still legally married to country singer Donny Fallgatter, but they eventually finalized their divorce. In 2014, Whitney and Keith competed together as a team on The Amazing Race season 25, where they finished in eighth place. The two married a few short months later. After struggling to start a family, Whitney and Keith welcomed their first child in 2022.





 2  Jamie Dugan &amp; Erik Huffman 
Survivor Season 15


Jamie Dugan and Erik Huffman grew up just 25 miles apart in South Carolina but didn&#39;t end up meeting until they were both across the world competing together on Survivor: China in 2007. The couple got engaged just a year later, in 2008, during a fake photoshoot elaborately planned by Erik. They married in 2009, becoming the first Survivor couple from the same season to marry each other when they tied the knot in 2009. The pair is still happily married and living in Charleston, South Carolina, with their 12-year-old son, Harper.





 1  Amber Brkich &amp; Rob Mariano 
Survivor Season 8


 







Amber Brkich and Rob Mariano are arguably the most well-known and beloved Survivor couple. Having each played the game separately during different seasons, they met in 2003 during Survivor: All-Stars, which pits popular past players against each other. In 2004, the couple got engaged during the season&#39;s live finale at Madison Square Garden in NYC, where Amber was crowned the winner. They got married a year later, in 2005, and have been together ever since, raising their four daughters together.
