## Literature Review
Sometimes it takes time for a TV show to find its feet, these are all shows that almost lost out on viewers due to a disappointing debut season.




There are plenty of incredible TV shows that almost lost out on the chance of reaching a large audience due to disappointing first seasons. The debut season of a show can often be its weakest, the characters haven’t had time to properly develop, the unique style and voice of the series haven’t yet been established, and actors, directors, and writers have not received enough audience feedback from viewers to properly hone into what is great about their show. Often, after a disappointing first batch of episodes, middle of the road series can turn into incredible shows by season 2.
One reason a show can failed to reach viewers in the first season only to turn into a great show later on is when the series is a remake of another show, like the American version of The Office. Remakes often focus too much on copying the original show in the first season, before embracing the new series strengths in subsequent seasons. Sometimes the full cast has not yet been established, such as with It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which felt incomplete before Danny DeVito joined the cast in season 2. There are lots of reasons that incredible TV shows almost lost viewers because of disappointing first seasons.









 








 10  The Office (2005 – 2013) 
The Office season 1 did not yet have its own unique voice


 







 The Office 

 Release Date   March 24, 2005    Cast   Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Sitcom    Seasons   9    




While the American version of The Office would become the most successful adaptation of a UK sitcom ever made, its six-episode first season tried too hard to recreate the original series and ignored the potential of its new cast of characters. The most obvious issue was Dunder Mifflin manager Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell. Initially, The Office tried to make Michael too similar to David Brent from the UK version, which disregarded the heartfelt sincerity and optimistic nature that Carell portrays so well. Later seasons embraced new aspects of the characters and the American version of The Office became a unique series in its own right.





 9  Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987 – 1994) 
Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1 featured some of the show’s most boring episodes
        

 Star Trek: The Next Generation 

 Release Date   September 28, 1987    Cast   Patrick Stewart , Marina Sirtis , Brent Spiner , Jonathan Frakes , LeVar Burton , Wil Wheaton    Genres    Sci-Fi , Superhero , Drama , Action    Seasons   7    




Star Trek: The Next Generation stands as the most popular of all the Star Trek television series, however, if this was based just on the first series alone that would not be the case. The first season did not live up to the show’s legacy and featured some of the worst episodes in the show’s run. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry was heavily involved in the show’s first season and wanted the show to be void of military conflict (via Game Rant), which although noble does not make for interesting television. The later seasons betrayed Gene Roddenberry’s original story plans but made for a much more engaging viewing experience.





 8  It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia (2005 - Present) 
It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia season 1 was missing one vital character
        

 It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia 

 Release Date   August 4, 2005    Cast   Charlie Day , Rob McElhenney , Kaitlin Olson , Glenn Howerton , Danny DeVito    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   16    




It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia was a clever and unique sitcom in its seven-episode first season, but watching it now feels oddly incomplete without the addition of Danny DeVito as Frank Reynolds. The first season of the show was well-received but did not reach a large audience and the studio insisted that a recognizable name join the cast for the season, so DeVito joined to complete the gang as they’re known today. The addition of DeVito was the secret ingredient to It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s success with viewers as Frank’s wealth allowed for the gang to get involved in ever more elaborate schemes that sometimes actually work.





 7  Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 – 2020) 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 1 lacked the depth of later seasons
        

 Star Wars: The Clone Wars 

 Release Date   October 3, 2008    Cast   Matt Lanter , james arnold taylor , Ashley Eckstein , Dee Bradley Baker , Matthew Wood , Tom Kane , Catherine Taber , Terrence Carson , Corey Burton , Nika Futterman , Katee Sackhoff , Sam Witwer    Genres   Animation ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   7    




While Star Wars: The Clone Wars was one of the most beloved entries in the franchise, there are some harsh realities of watching season 1 as the show took time to reach its full potential. The first season had a less crips animation style, focused more on stand-alone episodes versus ongoing narratives, and lacked the depth and maturity of later seasons. With a confusing anthology style and characters who acted inconsistently with their movie portrayals, Star Wars: Clone Wars season 1 almost lost viewers before improving greatly in subsequent seasons.





 6  Blackadder (1983 – 1989) 
Blackadder series one failed to reach the highs of later series
        

The first series of the acclaimed British sitcom Blackadder, known as The Black Adder, was set in the year 1485 at the end of the British Middle Ages. A joint creation between Richard Curtis and its star Rowan Atkinson, the first series cost £1 million which was a massively overblown budget for a comedy series in the 1980s and, unfortunately, the period piece setting of the series and its use of Shakespearian dialogue meant Blackadder series one would not be as popular with viewers as later series. Blackadder has garnered a reputation as one of the best British sitcoms of all time and Atkinson has even teased the possibility of a fifth season of Blackadder.





 5  Agents of SHEILD (2013 – 2020) 
Agents of SHIELD season 1 was not as exciting as later seasons
        

 Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 

 Release Date   September 24, 2013    Cast   Ming-Na Wen , Brett Dalton , Chloe Bennet , Clark Gregg , Elizabeth Henstridge , Iain De Caestecker , Henry Simmons    Genres    Sci-Fi , Action , Adventure , Superhero    Seasons   7    




The Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Agents of SHIELD had a slow start in its first season but over the years developed into one of the best shows in the MCU. The debut season had the daunting task of establishing the characters, following a case-of-the-week structure, and linking the narrative back into the overall MCU. It took time for Agents of SHIELD to properly find its feet and it was only in later seasons after the arrival of HYDRA that the show overcame its growing pains and connected with viewers through its expert blend of action, comedy, and drama.





 4  Parks And Recreation (2009 – 2015) 
Parks and Recreation season 1 had not yet fully developed its main characters
        

 Parks and Recreation 

 Release Date   April 9, 2009    Cast   Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&#39;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe    Genres   Sitcom , Comedy , Mockumentary    Seasons   7    




Originally envisioned as a spin-off to The Office, the first season of Parks and Recreation had a lot of growing pains and still had not fully found its feet when it aired in 2009. Amy Poehler’s character Leslie Knope was essentially a female version of Michael Scott and a romantic subplot involving Paul Schneider as city planner Mark Brendanawicz just did not work, and the character was removed in later seasons. Parks and Recreation underwent a lot of changes in the second season which improved the show greatly. After that, viewers started to connect with Parks and Recreation and it reached a much larger audience.





 3  Breaking Bad (2008 -2013) 
Breaking Bad season 1 was laying the groundwork for the show’s best seasons


 







 Breaking Bad 

 Release Date   January 20, 2008    Cast   Dean Norris , Bob Odenkirk , Aaron Paul , RJ Mitte , Anna Gunn , Giancarlo Esposito , Betsy Brandt , Bryan Cranston , Jonathan Banks    Genres   Crime , Drama , Thriller    Seasons   5    




The first season of Breaking Bad had just seven episodes due to the 2007 to 2008 WAG strike and although a very strong season of television had yet to reach the incredible highs that would draw viewers in during later seasons. The debut season of Breaking Bad leaned heavily into the more comedic side of the series and had a slower narrative pace. Walter White had yet to transform into the meth kingpin Heisenberg and characters like Jesse Pinkman were not as developed or three-dimensional as they would become. Breaking Bad season 1 was a good start to a great show that viewers would connect strongly with in later seasons.





 2  Doctor Who (2005 – Present) 
Doctor Who series 1 featured a different actor as the Doctor and viewers connected more with their later incarnations


 







 Doctor Who 

 Release Date   November 23, 1963    Cast   Jenna Coleman , Jodie Whittaker , Alex Kingston , David Tennant , Matt Smith , Peter Capaldi    Genres   Adventure , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   26    




In 2005, the long-running British sci-fi series Doctor Who was revived after a 16-year absence starring Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor and Bille Piper as Rose Tyler. The revived Doctor Who was a fun, imaginative, and more mature version of the show that successfully reintroduced the character to a new generation of viewers. However, it was in series 2, after David Tennent replaced Eccleston as the Doctor, that the show really started to pick up steam, as Tennent’s fun-loving and eccentric portrayal of the Doctor was more tenable than Eccleston’s more brooding and serious portrayal of the Doctor.





 1  Seinfeld (1989 – 1998) 
Seinfeld season 1 had just five episodes and audiences barely had time to discover the show
        

 Seinfeld 

 Release Date   July 5, 1989    Cast   Jerry Seinfeld , Julia Louis-Dreyfus , Jason Alexander , Michael Richards    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   9    




The debut season of Seinfeld had not yet found its distinctive voice, the characters weren’t fully developed, and their interactions did not feel as natural as in later seasons. Jerry Seinfeld was not as recognizable as he would later become and as the first season had just five episodes, it was not enough time for viewers to even discover the show. When looking at the rating for every season of Seinfeld the first season comes in dead last but, by the season 9 finale, Jerry, George, Kramer, and Elaine were watched by 76.3 million viewers in one of the most watched season finales of all time (via Mental Floss).
