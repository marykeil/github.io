# 10 Things We Want From Star Trek Strange New Worlds Season 3


## SUMMARY 


 Strange New Worlds season 3 picks up where season 2 left off, with Captain Pike facing a no-win scenario against the Gorn and the fate of the USS Enterprise crew hanging in the balance. 
 Captain Batel&#39;s survival and the defeat of the Gorn are key storylines for season 3. Batel&#39;s survival is in the hands of Nurse Chapel, while the Gorn threat should be resolved before a new enemy emerges. 
 Scotty makes an appearance in season 3, but it&#39;s too soon to replace Commander Pelia as Chief Engineer. Season 3 may also introduce Carol Marcus, Kirk&#39;s pregnant girlfriend, and further explore the relationship between Nurse Chapel and Dr. Roger Korby.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 is in production now, and hopefully the next 10 episodes will deliver on these storylines and plot threads.




Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 production is underway, and here are 10 things we want from the next batch of episodes. Strange New Worlds season 2 was a phenomenal success, with most of its episodes charting in Nielsen&#39;s streaming top 10 while also delivering innovative and all-time classic Star Trek episodes. Indeed, Strange New Worlds season 2 contained a couple of never-before-seen episodes: Strange New Worlds&#39; first comedy crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks and Star Trek&#39;s first-ever musical.
Strange New Worlds season 3&#39;s premiere will pick up where Strange New Worlds season 2&#39;s finale cliffhanger left off: Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) is in a no-win scenario against the Gorn. Although Starfleet ordered Pike to retreat, the Captain&#39;s instinct is to rescue the members of the USS Enterprise crew kidnapped by the Gorn. Captain Marie Batel (Melanie Scrofano) is also at death&#39;s door after she was infected by Gorn eggs, while new engineer Lt. Montgomery Scott (Martin Quinn) may come up with a way to defeat the Gorn. But after Strange New Worlds pays those season 2 bills, there are still 9 more episodes to address multiple storylines and character threads in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3.
            
 
 Star Trek Should Release Strange New Worlds Season 3 In 2 Parts 
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 is in production, and Paramount&#43; should release the new episodes ASAP rather than drop them all in 2025.













 








 10  Captain Batel Survives The Gorn 
Nurse Chapel has to save Batel.


 







Captain Batel looks like a goner in Strange New Worlds season 3. After all, no one has survived an infection of Gorn eggs, as evidenced by the death of Lt. Hemmer (Bruce Horak) in Strange New Worlds season 1. But Batel dying would be the predictable move, and it seems wasteful to keep Marie alive into Strange New Worlds season 3 only to kill her in the premiere episode. Further, Batel&#39;s survival was placed in Nurse Christine Chapel&#39;s (Jess Bush) hands, and Chapel has to pull Marie through somehow. While Batel isn&#39;t around when Pike is horribly disfigured in Star Trek: The Original Series, after building up Batel and Pike&#39;s relationship, it would be a disappointment to kill off Marie when Strange New Worlds season 3 premieres.
Batel was Captain of the USS Cayuga, which was destroyed by the Gorn when they attacked Parnassus Beta. 






 9  The Gorn Are Finally Defeated 
Strange New Worlds season 3 needs a new Big Bad.


 







The Gorn have menaced Captain Pike and the Starship Enterprise since Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1, but season 3 should hopefully mark the Gorn&#39;s defeat... for now. Strange New Worlds has done a deft job rebooting the Gorn into savage killers, and they have been a fearsome adversary like no other in Star Trek. However, the Gorn threat should conclude in Strange New Worlds season 3 before their menace is played out. Hopefully, a new enemy will emerge in Strange New Worlds season 3, and the Gorn can take a rest before they return in Star Trek: The Original Series.





 8  Scotty Joins Enterprise Engineering - But Pelia Doesn&#39;t Die 
Pelia should remain Chief Engineer.


 







Lt. Montgomery Scott (Martin Quinn) was a pleasant surprise in Strange New Worlds season 2&#39;s finale. The younger Scotty&#39;s reintroduction is yet another link to the future USS Enterprise led by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in Star Trek: The Original Series, and hopefully, Scotty will stick around to join the Engineering squad of Captain Pike&#39;s Enterprise. However, it is too soon to replace Commander Pelia (Carol Kane) as Chief Engineer, and Pelia, a long-lived Lanthanite, is one of the most fascinating new characters Star Trek has introduced in recent years. Strange New Worlds shouldn&#39;t kill off Pelia for Scotty. Rather, Scotty can sit under Pelia&#39;s learning tree for a while before he inevitably rises to Chief Engineer years from now.





 7  Carol Marcus Appears In Strange New Worlds Season 3 
Kirk&#39;s pregnant girlfriend should meet La&#39;an.
        

Lt. James T. Kirk (Paul Wesley) confessing to Lt. La&#39;an Noonien-Singh (Christina Chong) about his pregnant girlfriend, Carol, is a tacit promise that the future Dr. Carol Marcus could appear in Strange New Worlds season 3. Carol is the future mother of Kirk&#39;s son, David (Merritt Butrick), and the creator of the Genesis Device in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. But in Strange New Worlds, Carol would be an intriguing foil for the budding romance between James and La&#39;an. Strange New Worlds has a ton of storytelling potential to show what, exactly, led to Kirk promising to stay away as Carol raises David on her own.
            
 
 5 Actors Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Should Cast As Carol Marcus 
These five actresses would be perfect to play Lt. James T. Kirk&#39;s girlfriend, Carol Marcus, on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.









 6  Nurse Chapel Starts Her Relationship With Dr. Roger Kirby 
Spock and Chapel should remain friends.


 







Nurse Christine Chapel was en route to her fellowship in archeological medicine with Dr. Roger Korby when the Gorn attacked, but once the reptilian threat is over, Chapel should commence her studies with the mysterious Dr. Korby. Christine is destined to become Korby&#39;s fiancée according to Star Trek: The Original Series canon, and it&#39;s a story Strange New Worlds season 3 is uniquely poised to explore. However, Korby is also a great way to add a new wrinkle to the relationship between Chapel and Lt. Spock (Ethan Peck), as well as further the complications between Spock and his Vulcan fiancée, T&#39;Pring (Gia Sandhu).





 5  Sybok &amp; Captain Angel Return To Strange New Worlds 
It&#39;s time to officially meet Spock&#39;s criminal half-brother.


 







Spock&#39;s Vulcan half-brother Sybok, the future villain of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, was shockingly reintroduced in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1, episode 7, &#34;The Serene Squall,&#34; and it was an equal surprise when Strange New Worlds season 2 came and went without any mention of Sybok or his space pirate wife, Captain Angel (Jesse James Keitel). Angel still has to make good on her promise to break Sybok out of the Vulcan rehabilitation center run by T&#39;Pring, and Strange New Worlds season 3 would ideally bring Sybok formally back to reiterate the threat he and Angel pose to the Starship Enterprise as well as possibly plant the seeds of Sybok&#39;s mad quest to find the God of Sha Ka Ree (George Murdock).
If Sybok returns to Strange New Worlds, he can&#39;t meet Lt. James T. Kirk to preserve how Kirk had no idea Spock had a brother in Star Trek V, 






 4  More Information About Star Trek&#39;s Changed Timeline 
Are Khan and World War III the only things that changed?
        

Strange New Worlds season 3 will hopefully clarify the changes to Star Trek&#39;s Prime Timeline the prequel has made. Captain Pike&#39;s history lesson to Kiley 279 about Earth&#39;s World War III was Strange New Worlds&#39; first instance of timeline changes, and certain events have moved to happen later than established by Star Trek: The Original Series. Strange New Worlds season 2, episode 3, &#34;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&#34; confirmed the new timeline was caused by Romulan time travelers&#39; interference, resulting in Khan Noonien-Singh (Desmond Sivan) being born in the 21st century instead of decades earlier. What further changes to the timeline could be revealed by Strange New Worlds season 3?





 3  Starfleet Learns The Truth About Dr. M&#39;Benga Killing Ambassador Dak&#39;Rah 
Could another courtroom episode happen in Strange New Worlds season 3?
        

&#34;Under the Cloak of War&#34;, the darkest episode of Strange New Worlds season 2, ended with the unthinkable: Dr. Joseph M&#39;Benga (Babs Olusanmokun) murdered Klingon Ambassador Dak&#39;Rah (Robert Wisdom) in cold blood, an act Nurse Christine Chapel witnessed and helped M&#39;Benga cover up. Although Captain Pike believed his officers were telling the truth, this is a secret too big to not be dealt with in Strange New Worlds season 3. If Starfleet finds out and prosecutes M&#39;Benga and Chapel, it could jeopardize the entire Starship Enterprise under Pike&#39;s command, but it could also result in another spectacular Star Trek courtroom episode like Strange New Worlds season 2&#39;s &#34;Ad Astra Per Aspera.&#34; This could also plant the seed for why Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) replaces M&#39;Benga as the Enterprise&#39;s Chief Medical Officer.
            
 
 Star Trek&#39;s Best Courtroom Episodes Ranked 
Una&#39;s trial in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2, episode 2, &#34;Ad Astra per Aspera&#34; joins the ranks of Star Trek&#39;s very best courtroom dramas. 









 2  Dr. Leonard &#34;Bones&#34; McCoy and Mr. Sulu Appear In Strange New Worlds Season 3 
Kirk&#39;s Enterprise crew is almost complete.


 







The last two remaining main characters from Star Trek: The Original Series season 1 waiting to be introduced in Strange New Worlds are Dr. Leonard &#34;Bones&#34; McCoy and Hikaru Sulu (George Takei). Will Bones, Sulu, or both appear in Strange New Worlds season 3? Scotty&#39;s arrival in Strange New Worlds means that Kirk, Spock, Ensign Nyota Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding), and Nurse Chapel, as well as Dr. M&#39;Benga, have all come aboard Captain Pike&#39;s Starship Enterprise. Meanwhile, Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) may still be too young to appear in Strange New Worlds, but stranger things have happened in the prequel series already.





 1  More Strange New Worlds Gimmick Episodes In Season 3 
Strange New Worlds must continue with big swings.


 







Strange New Worlds season 2 took some big swings like the crossover and the musical that paid off in becoming instant modern Star Trek classics, and Strange New Worlds season 3 should be emboldened to keep trying new and crazy things. Strange New Worlds has proven it has a cast that can handle anything and a writer&#39;s room adept at spinning gold with the show&#39;s beloved characters. It boggles the mind what further gimmick episodes Strange New Worlds season 3 can try, but even if the show abandons gimmicks in the third season, maintaining Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&#39; incredibly high standards would be a guaranteed success.
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds seasons 1 and 2 are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
