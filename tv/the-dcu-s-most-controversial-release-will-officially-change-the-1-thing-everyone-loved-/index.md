## Literature Review
The DCU is moving full steam ahead, but James Gunn&#39;s recent reveal about Peacemaker season 2 promises a controversial change for the series.




James Gunn has revealed that Peacemaker season 2 will make a major change to a fan-favorite element. Gunn has shared quite a few updates on the status of Peacemaker season 2, such as confirming the series will be canon to the new DC Universe and part of its Chapter One. Now, the latest of Gunn&#39;s Peacemaker season 2 updates is related to the show&#39;s most popular aspect.

While all members of Team Peacemaker will likely return as canon DCU characters, the show will make a major change for season 2. According to Gunn, Peacemaker&#39;s viral opening dance number will make way for a different, &#34;Equally magnificent&#34; opening.

 Why Peacemaker Season 2â€™s New Intro Is A Big Deal 
Peacemaker Season 1&#39;s Opening Is Iconic
          




Peacemaker season 1 introduced gripping characters and their dynamics to the DCEU. While Peacemaker season 2 bringing back John Cena&#39;s lead anti-hero and likely the rest of the series&#39; cast to the new DCU, as well as potentially continuing story threads laid by the first season is great, Gunn&#39;s new update is a big deal. Peacemaker season 1 presented a major difference from the rest of the superhero series.

While Peacemaker season 1 had its fair share of dark moments and bloody fights, the series had a hilarious opening sequence. Peacemaker&#39;s dance opening, which featured all the series&#39; important characters dancing with a straight face, was an instant success. The intro quickly went viral, with several fans from all over the world sharing their attempts to recreate Peacemaker&#39;s iconic dance to the sound of &#34;Do Ya Wanna Taste It.&#34;

Peacemaker&#39;s dance sequence spreading like wildfire helped the show attract a huge audience. Gunn&#39;s first DC series became one of the most successful releases for Max yet, breaking records along the way, such as Peacemaker season 1&#39;s finale being the &#34;biggest single day performance for a Max Original series,&#34; as shared by leading man Cena. While it makes sense for Peacemaker season 2 to change its opening, as many characters from the original intro are dead, anything other than an equally exciting dance sequence would prove disappointing, though Gunn has teased that is where Peacemaker season 2&#39;s new opening is headed.
