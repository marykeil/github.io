# Athena s Percy Jackson Episode 4 Role Helps Prove Season 1 s Secret Villain Right


## SUMMARY 



  Medusa&#39;s portrayal in Percy Jackson challenges Annabeth&#39;s belief in Athena and highlights their shared experience of being wronged.   Athena&#39;s reaction to receiving Medusa&#39;s head exposes her flawed nature and shows the gods&#39; key failures.   Athena&#39;s treatment of Annabeth reinforces one character&#39;s late-season argument about the gods&#39; unfitness to rule.

## Literature Review
Known as the Goddess of Wisdom, Athena&#39;s not-so-wise move against Annabeth in Percy Jackson episode 4 helps prove season 1&#39;s secret &#34;villain&#34; right.




Known as the Goddess of Wisdom, Athena&#39;s not-so-gracious reaction to her demigod daughter in Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; fourth episode actually helps prove season 1&#39;s secret &#34;villain&#34; right. In Percy Jackson season 1, episode 3, the show&#39;s titular demigod (Walker Scobell) and his companions, fellow demigod Annabeth Chase (Leah Jeffries), and the satyr protector Grover Underwood (Aryan Simhadri) stumble upon Medusa&#39;s (Jessica Parker Kennedy) Garden Gnome Emporium. Even though her domain is littered with stone statues of her past victims, Percy Jackson&#39;s Medusa changes the Greek myth&#39;s story, painting the gorgon as a survivor who was wronged by Athena and Poseidon — Annabeth and Percy&#39;s respective parents.




The gorgon not only challenges Annabeth&#39;s deeply-held belief that Athena is wise, just, and infallible, but Medusa illustrates that she and Sally Jackson (Virginia Kull), Percy&#39;s mother, aren&#39;t so different. As the gorgon puts it, both women were wronged by the &#34;same monster.&#34; Percy might be skeptical of the gods — and he may dislike Poseidon — but Medusa&#39;s words plant an even more aggressive seed of doubt, especially in Annabeth. After the Camp Half-Blood trio slay Medusa, they ship her head to Mt. Olympus and continue westward to the Los Angeles-based entrance to the Underworld. In episode 4, another trial displays Athena&#39;s bad side once more.

While Athena has yet to appear in Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson, her presence is deeply felt, especially in the fourth chapter, &#34;I Plunge to My Death.&#34; During the Medusa incident, Percy learns that the baseball cap of invisibility, a gift from the Goddess of Wisdom, is the only link between Annabeth and her mother. In Percy Jackson season 1, episode 4, Annabeth reveals more about her past: the demigod is an idea born from Athena&#39;s mind and presented as a gift to her human father. Unable to earn her step-mother&#39;s love, Annabeth left home and, ever since, has spent her life trying to honor her birth mother.






Percy Jackson and the Olympians has not yet announced who will play Athena in the Disney&#43; series.




For Annabeth, Athena&#39;s harsh-yet-clear-cut rules ensure she&#39;ll receive her mother&#39;s love. During a scene that perfectly captures Percy and Annabeth&#39;s relationship, the two argue about what to do with Medusa&#39;s still-dangerous head. Ever-defiant, Percy insists on shipping the head to Olympus, though Annabeth warns him that the act will make them all look impertinent. In episode 4, this decision comes back to bite the trio. While taking refuge from Percy Jackson&#39;s Echidna in an Athenian sanctuary, Annabeth realizes that her mother has revoked her protection. Embarrassed by her daughter, Athena leaves the trio for dead.

Spoilers are ahead for Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief — the book upon which Percy Jackson season 1 is based.






 How Athena Treats Annabeth Only Proves Luke&#39;s Point About The Gods 
          

When Athena decides to revoke her protection, Percy Jackson&#39;s version of the monstrous Chimera and Echidna are able to enter the former sanctuary. The whole debacle underscores one of The Lightning Thief&#39;s key points: the gods are not infallible. Athena&#39;s decision is not only selfish, but immature; she needlessly puts her daughter&#39;s life and Percy&#39;s war-thwarting quest at risk. At the end of the source material, demigod Luke Castellan (Charlie Bushnell) reveals that he stole Zeus&#39; master bolt in order to encourage a war between the gods of Olympus. In Luke&#39;s opinion, the gods are unfit to rule, and Athena&#39;s treatment of Annabeth, her ever-devoted daughter, proves that.

New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians air on Hulu and Disney&#43; every Tuesday through January 30, 2024.
