## Literature Review
1000-Lb Sisters cast member Tammy Slaton breaks down in tears after her husband Caleb Willingham tells her shocking news about his weight loss.




Tammy Slaton is dumbfounded after hearing shocking news in the next episode of 1000-Lb Sisters season 5. Tammy has starred on 1000-Lb Sisters with her sister Amy Slaton since its premiere in 2020. The 36-year-old woman first became popular as a YouTuber and documented her weight-loss journey, which didn’t go according to plan. Tammy decided to change her lifestyle by entering the Windsor Lane Rehabilitation Center in Ohio, where she met Caleb Willingham and tied the knot with him. Tammy dropped 300 pounds and went home after spending 14 months in rehab. However, Caleb had trouble maintaining his weight loss back at the rehab facility.




In a new clip from the next episode of 1000-Lb Sisters season 5, as shared by E! News, Caleb is on a call with Tammy to tell her that his doctor advised him to bring his weight down to 500 pounds so he could “feel comfortable doing surgery.&#34;


 

However, Caleb’s weigh-in was 537 pounds. Moreover, there was a “worse part” to the conversation. He adds, “The trach is going to have to stay in.&#34; Tammy was not expecting this update from her husband. “It sucks,” she tells the cameras in her private confessional. Tammy was hoping that the doctor would tell Caleb he’d lost enough weight to have surgery and get his trach removed.

“It bothers me that he’s backsliding,” she continues. Tammy knows that Caleb is very sensitive, so she feels like she can’t say anything. “I feel like I have to be strong for him,” she says. “We knew this wasn&#39;t going to be easy on either one of us,&#34; Tammy tells Caleb during the video call. She reminds him that the one thing she asked him to do was to promise that he wasn’t going to sit in his room all day long. “I wanted you to go hang out with the boys, to keep your mind preoccupied, you know?&#34; she asks her spouse.

However, Caleb hasn’t been able to stick to the promises he made to his wife. “I eat my freaking feelings,” he admits. When Tammy tells Caleb that he “can’t do that” and suggests that he needs to find something else to keep him occupied like his “video games,” he responds that he doesn’t want video games but wants his “wife.” Tammy tells him that he needs to just focus on his weight for the moment. “I think he&#39;ll let the depression set in before he hits rock bottom again and gets determined to come home,” Tammy cries during her interview while admitting she’s worried about her husband.




Tammy felt guilty and overwhelmed in the clip. She wanted to be strong for Caleb, Amy, and the kids. Tammy didn’t want to “crumble” because that would mean her whole world would “go to h***.” She may not have expected Caleb to pass away. Tammy’s husband died in June 2023. She referred to him as her sweet angel in a loving tribute she shared about him on Instagram. For now, the 1000-Lb Sisters star’s latest updates reveal that she has been trying to figure out her own path to good health and happiness.



1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
