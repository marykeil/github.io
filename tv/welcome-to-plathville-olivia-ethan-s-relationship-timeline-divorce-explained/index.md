## Literature Review
After failing to resolve their marital issues, Welcome to Plathville’s Olivia and Ethan Plath have finally decided to go their separate ways.




Olivia and Ethan Plath from Welcome to Plathville are moving on from each other, and it’s probably for the best. The married duo has been appearing on TLC since the premiere of their reality TV show in 2019. Unfortunately, their relationship has only gotten worse each year, with the drama in Welcome to Plathville season 5 being the final nail in the coffin. Olivia and Ethan seemingly wanted to fix their marriage when they returned to the show. However, things didn’t go well due to their numerous differences, family issues, and lack of mutual understanding.




At the beginning of Welcome to Plathville season 5, Ethan failed to juggle his family and Olivia. He didn’t know how to balance being a Plath family son and husband to his wife. Similarly, issues between Olivia and Ethan’s sister, Moriah, escalated further. Olivia wasn’t ready to mend the differences, which further complicated things. In one instance, Ethan misbehaved when he took Olivia and her family out. He drove rashly in the snow, which scared Olivia as she had previously been in an accident. The couple moved to Minnesota, which didn’t help their marriage either.

According to The Things, Ethan and Olivia Plath met years ago in 2014 while on a camping trip. They connected at a Christian family event, the Smokey Mountain No Greater Joy Shindig. The event is also associated with the TLC show 19 Kids and Counting. The two Welcome to Plathville cast members were in their late teens and not serious about getting into a relationship. According to Olivia’s old blog, Ethan also didn’t make a charming impression on her when they first met. She previously stated, “we didn’t even really spend any time together, except for dancing a few times.”

The Christian event was rather uneventful for Ethan and Olivia. The two stars moved away and didn’t reconnect for the next 24 months due to hurdles such as a lack of Internet connection. Ethan was into Olivia from the moment he danced with her, but the same wasn’t true the other way around. Olivia was still unsure about Ethan, but that changed when she reconnected with him in 2016. The pair officially began their relationship soon after meeting each other again. They dated long-distance for a year and eventually fell in love.

Ethan and Olivia maintained a strong long-distance relationship initially. Their rock-solid compatibility allowed them to tie the knot a few months after their engagement. The couple had their wedding ceremony in October 2018 and took to Instagram to express their feelings. Olivia wrote (via US Weekly), “it is such a privilege to start a new chapter ... with my husband,” stating that she felt overjoyed by the love and support of their family. Some of Olivia’s older blogs show she considered Ethan’s family her “people.” As most Welcome to Plathville viewers know, that feeling changed soon after she got married.

Ethan and Olivia began contemplating divorce a few years ago. During season 4, Ethan revealed some dark secrets to the cameras. He said, “we were really really, close to getting a divorce and going our separate ways.” In June 2023, Olivia’s sister hinted that Olivia and Ethan were in the “middle of a divorce.” While she didn’t expand on it further, it was enough to spark rumors that Welcome to Plathville season 5 could be the popular couple’s last season together. Many viewers were sure something had happened as Ethan and Olivia seemed distant.

In early September 2023, the new episodes of Welcome to Plathville season 5 showed Ethan and Olivia facing even more differences and moving to Minnesota to build a better relationship. Unfortunately, their plan fell flat, as the new location didn’t “bring more joy, health and fun” as expected. Instead, the move pushed them further apart and made them realize they were no longer on the same page, be it regarding political opinions or religious beliefs. The couple split in episode 10 as Ethan left Olivia to return to his family in Cairo. They announced their breakup via Instagram in October 2023 and seemed to be on friendly terms.

 Why Did Ethan &amp; Olivia Break Up? 
Ethan &amp; Olivia Grew Apart
         

Ethan and Olivia broke up for numerous reasons. However, the most obvious cause for their split was their evolution. When the two first met in 2014, they were very similar individuals. They were teenage kids with similar dreams and matching expectations for their future. They fell in love at an age when they were supposed to be focusing on their careers and tied the knot before they were truly ready for the responsibility. As such, they grew apart and only realized their differences when it was too late. Ethan and Olivia just grew up to be very different people.




Another prominent reason for Ethan and Olivia’s split was the on-screen drama. Olivia and Ethan grew up in religious families and had similar values about what it means to be a family. Unfortunately, Olivia couldn’t coexist with Ethan’s parents, especially Kim Plath, which led to many problems. Olivia started getting distant from Ethan’s family after debuting in Welcome to Plathville season 1. This drama stressed Ethan, who felt stuck between the two sides. Eventually, the situation imploded and impacted the pair’s marriage. The Welcome to Plathville couple’s split and divorce was inevitable from the beginning.



Welcome to Plathville airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.
