 What To Know About Fire Country Season 2 
          

Fire Country season 2 will feature a few significant new characters. Empire and Dynasty reboot actor Rafael de la Fuente has joined the CBS show for at least three episodes. De la Fuente will play Diego, who is described as a charming and motivated paramedic and firefighter, in addition to a combat vet who served in Afghanistan. Diego will train Gabriela (Stephanie Arcila) for her paramedic certification. The two will reportedly hit it off, which could make Bode worry, given that the shocking season 1 finale drove a bit of a wedge between him and Gabriela.




Fire Country is also looking in the direction of a potential spinoff, which would be sheriff-focused. A new character will be introduced in season 2 that could lead to her own show. However, it&#39;s also stressed that plans are flexible. The new character could ultimately end up remaining with the main series instead. A decision could also be made to focus on a different character for the spinoff. The sheriff will begin as a guest star but could become a regular.

                  Fire Country Season 2 Couldn’t Happen Without That Bode Twist   The shocking twist changes things in a fundamental way for Bode, but it also guarantees interesting developments for Fire Country season 2.    

The return of Fire Country is poised to focus on the fallout of Bode&#39;s shocking decision from the season 1 finale. It seems that the CBS drama will resolve the cliffhanger and shift its attention to expanding the show&#39;s universe. But it still might be the case that Bode covering for a friend may prove to have long-term ramifications.






Fire Country season 2 debuts Friday, February 16 at 9 PM ET on CBS.
