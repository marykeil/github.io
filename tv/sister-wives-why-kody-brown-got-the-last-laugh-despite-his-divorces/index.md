## Literature Review
It’s shocking to see how unconcerned Kody Brown is after his three divorces. The Sister Wives star acts like a weight has been lifted off his chest.




Kody Brown from Sister Wives is standing tall despite all his divorces. The 54-year-old polygamous man was previously married to Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown. He liked them all but never really loved them. In 2010, Kody married his fourth wife, Robyn Brown, and brought her into his family. He fell in love with her subservient qualities and began treating her better than everyone else. His passion for Robyn irritated his other wives, who started feeling jealous. They got tired of their polygamous relationship and the lack of attention from their husband.




After 25 years of commitment, Christine finally ended her marriage with Kody in November 2021. She found love with David Woolley and married him in October 2023. After Christine left, Janelle reconsidered her relationship with Kody and eventually ended her marriage in December 2022. Kody&#39;s first wife, Meri, tried to work things out with him for the longest time, but she also gave up on him in January 2023. Kody, who lived as a polygamous man for over 30 years, is now in a monogamous relationship with Robyn.

 Kody Brown Is Still Married To His Soulmate 
         

Kody doesn’t seem as heartbroken as he should be after witnessing the end of his three marriages. In most of the latest videos, he looks happy and content that he now only has one wife, Robyn. For a long time, Kody refused to admit that he played favorites. Still, many Sister Wives viewers could clearly see him favoring his youngest wife, Robyn, over Meri, Janelle, and Christine. In October 2023, Kody finally admitted that his life “seems to center around” his fourth wife and their five children. He said there was no flame between him and his first three wives.




The Sister Wives star added, “so it’s been weird because I’m married to the love of my life.” In fact, Kody and Christine’s son, Paedon, believes that Robyn is his father’s soulmate. While talking to the US Weekly, he said, “dad found the woman he loves. Robyn found the man she loves. Robyn found someone who wants to take care of her children.”



During Sister Wives season 17 Tell All, Kody explained how Robyn doesn’t play games, unlike his first three wives.






 Kody Brown Looks Happier &amp; Healthier With Robyn Brown 
         

Kody never felt too overjoyed by spending time with women he didn’t truly love. He forced himself to be with his other wives when he knew wholeheartedly that he only loved Robyn. When Christine, Meri, and Janelle left Kody, it didn’t make things worse for him. Instead, it removed the clutter he felt and cleared his path to spending even more time with Robyn without guilt. While Janelle and Meri are still single, Kody is married to the love of his life, Robyn. He’s happier and healthier than he has been in the last ten years.






 Kody Brown Still Enjoys Patriarchal Role 
         

Kody has been the patriarch of his family for over 30 years. The middle-aged man married Janelle in 1993 and didn’t wait long before getting her pregnant. He did the same when he tied the knot with Christine in 1994. Kody welcomed fifteen kids over three decades and adopted Robyn’s three children from her previous marriage by legally marrying her in court. He showed the world that he truly cared about growing his family and assuming the role of the ultimate patriarch of his polygamous family.

Over the last five years, Kody lost connection with some of his kids as they grew older and more rebellious. He developed a closer bond with his younger children and gave them all attention and love. He’s still the head of the family and the provider. In fact, Kody is now much happier as a patriarch than he has ever been.






Nowadays, Kody enjoys being patriarch to his five kids with Robyn. Meri, Janelle, and Christine’s exit hasn’t put a single dent in Kody’s role in the family.






 Kody Brown Can Still Feature On The Show With Robyn 
          

The exit of Janelle, Meri, and Christine was scary for many viewers, as it could’ve led to the end of Sister Wives. However, the show’s ratings are still sky-high, and TLC hasn’t shared anything about concluding the series. The continuation of Sister Wives also means that Kody still has the platform to earn fame and money. He can televise his post-divorce journey and become wealthier. Many viewers don’t like Kody and Robyn, but they certainly enjoy their drama. Moreover, they enjoy watching Christine, Meri, and Janelle, who are still part of the series.






 Kody Brown Didn’t Want To Keep Up With Polygamous Lifestyle Anymore 
          

Divorces are extremely hard to overcome. They are sad situations that most people don’t want to go through. However, Kody is likely content with losing his wives. He’s happy with his new monogamous relationship and doesn’t even want to be polygamous anymore. At a young age, Kody had the energy and time to satisfy all his wives. He knew his goal was to grow his family and didn’t think twice before doing that. Nowadays, Kody is in his mid-50s. He knows that he can’t afford to have another wife.

Kody has considered reconciling with Meri or pursuing another woman because of Robyn. However, even Robyn has started liking monogamy. She has realized the benefits of an exclusive relationship and accepted her new truth. She wants to have a fulfilling life with Kody, and he wants to do the same. Kody is heartbroken by the demise of polygamy, but he visibly doesn’t miss his three wives. Instead, the Sister Wives star is more irritated by his failure but has begun to embrace the reality of the situation.
