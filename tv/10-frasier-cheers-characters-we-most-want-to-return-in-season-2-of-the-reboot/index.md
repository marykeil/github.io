# 10 Frasier &amp; Cheers Characters We Most Want To Return In Season 2 Of The Reboot


## SUMMARY 


 Niles Crane&#39;s return would add banter and witticisms, even if actor David Hyde Pierce is disinterested. 
 Charlotte&#39;s appearance would throw Frasier&#39;s world upside down and provide an interesting storyline. 
 It would be delightful to see Ronnie make an appearance to honor her marriage to Martin and advise Frasier on connecting with Freddie.

## Literature Review
The Frasier reboot had 2 notable guest stars from the original series. These are the other characters from Frasier and Cheers who should appear next.




The Frasier reboot had two notable guest stars, Roz and Lilith, but there are several more characters from both the original Frasier and Cheers that fans want to appear in the revival&#39;s second season. Lilith, who appeared in both Cheers and its spin-off as Frasier&#39;s wife, gave a boost of sardonic humor and tumult to the reboot&#39;s mid-season, and Roz appeared at the end of Frasier&#39;s ten episodes to offer some friendly advice to a Frasier who found himself at a crossroads. Without his father, Martin present to provide his signature candor, the good doctor struggled to connect with Freddie.
Returning to Boston has made Cheers season 2 cameos seem inevitable, particularly since Sam&#39;s bar is still open. Still, even with the bar nearby, Frasier had to get used to a new assortment of colleagues being a professor at Harvard University, as well as keep an eye on his nephew David, all the while occupying the same position as father did by moving in with his adult son. Original characters from Frasier and Cheers would both ground the reboot and lend it authenticity, particularly since the Frasier reboot got a lot wrong and only seemed to find its stride in the last few episodes.









 








 10  Niles Crane 
Frasier&#39;s Younger Brother In Frasier


 







Naturally, the most sought-after character to return for the Frasier reboot would be Niles Crane, Frasier&#39;s younger and more fastidious brother. David Hyde Pierce has expressed disinterest in playing Niles again, but the first season was successful, and there are many ways that Niles could make a cameo, even if it&#39;s just to keep an eye on his son&#39;s scholastic activities at Harvard. Niles&#39; presence has been salient, with his banter, witticisms, and barbs at his brother&#39;s expense given to several other characters to get Frasier&#39;s goat.





 9  Charlotte 
Frasier&#39;s Ex-Girlfriend In Frasier
        

In the final episode of the original Frasier, the titular character threw caution to the wind and jumped on a plane headed for San Francisco and a future with Charlotte (Laura Linney). As the first episode of the Frasier reboot tells us, he was with Charlotte for 20 years and then they separated for unexplained reasons after he stopped appearing on his nationally syndicated talk show in which he dispensed psychiatric advice in a similar format to Dr. Phil. Having Charlotte&#39;s side of the story told, or even just having her pop in to throw Frasier&#39;s newly minted world upside down would be delightful to watch.





 8  Ronnie 
Frasier&#39;s Mother-In-Law In Frasier
        

Ronnie is mentioned in episode 10 of the Frasier reboot when Frasier opens a box of Christmas decorations that used to belong to his father Martin, including the infamous dancing Santa Claus. It would be fun to see Ronnie make an appearance to honor her marriage to Martin and her significance in his life, particularly sine John Mahoney has passed away and can&#39;t be in the series at all. It would also be a perfect opportunity for Ronnie to advise Frasier on how best to connect with Freddie, occupying the same space his father did in the original Frasier went the two moved in together.





 7  Alistair Burke 
Frasier&#39;s Pseudo-Gay Boyfriend In Frasier
        

Patrick Stewart famously guest starred on Frasier as Alistair Burke one of Seattle&#39;s elite theater directors who memorably started, unbeknownst to Frasier, a relationship with the eccentric psychiatrist. After Frasier realized that Alistair had romantic intentions, he had to forgo any specialized attention from the socialite, thus ruining his chances of being in certain elite circles. Having Patrick Stewart guest star again as part of a touring show that lands in Boston would create a few hilarious scenes involving Frasier trying to explain how they know one another, complete with double entendres and innuendos.





 6  Sam 
Frasier&#39;s Friend In Cheers
        

Of all the cast of Cheers, Sam seems like the most likely to appear on the Frasier reboot. Given the fact that Frasier himself complained about how much they&#39;d drifted apart when Woody made a guest appearance on the original series, there are only a handful of Cheers cast members who could even relate to Frasier in his current iteration back in Boston. The showrunners have stated that a return to the Cheers bar is unlikely to happen because Frasier has moved on from needing that space, but not its owner, and perhaps Sam checking in for some timely advice would be just what Frasier needed (and wouldn&#39;t expect).





 5  Daphne Moon 
Frasier&#39;s Sister-In-Law In Frasier


 







Jane Leeves could likely return as Daphne even if Niles doesn&#39;t make an appearance, possibly showing up to visit David between classes. No doubt fans are curious about her life and whether or not she has continued to be a physical therapist in the decades since she was married to Niles. Daphne always added a certain quirkiness and warmth to the original Frasier, and her idiosyncrasies would be a perfect fit with the new cast, particularly in her interactions with Freddie and Eve.





 4  Bulldog Brisco 
Frasier&#39;s KACL Coworker In Frasier
        

Of Frasier&#39;s coworkers, Bulldog was arguably one of his most despised, but the KACL sports host went from being Frasier&#39;s rival and nemesis to being one of his friends. After Roz&#39;s guest starring appearance in the season 1 finale, it would be a change of pace to see Bulldog blow into Boston. He would get along well with Freddie and the rest of the gang at the fire station, and would have some truly hilarious scenes at Harvard making fun of all the faculty.





 3  Lilith 
Frasier&#39;s Ex-Wife In Frasier


 







Of the two original Frasier cast members who appeared on the Frasier reboot, Roz and Lilith, Lilith had the most substantial plot participation celebrating Freddie&#39;s birthday with Frasier in Boston. She also delivered some truly scathing lines that sharpened the wit of the series and returned it to the original&#39;s biting and sardonic glory. The barbs exchanged between Frasier and Liliith are always a highlight of any episode they&#39;re both in and an injection of Lilith&#39;s formidable and icy presence, particularly as Freddie achieves other milestones (promotion to fire chief, marriage to a girlfriend, adopting Eve&#39;s child as his own), can only elevate the revival even more.





 2  Kirby Gardner 
Frasier&#39;s KACL Intern In Frasier
        

Kirby, Frasier&#39;s hapless intern at KACL, was a character that fans of the original series either loved or hated because he always seemed like he was acting on a completely different show (not unlike some of the current cast of the reboot). Even so, his destiny might not have involved flunking college or failing to achieve professional success, and he could be a surprise guest lecturer at Harvard, or even have gone into psychology himself after Frasier&#39;s tutelage. Watching Kirby and characters like David and Alan interact would be particularly hilarious and lean into the chaotic, whimsical energy that so many of the original episodes of Frasier were known for.





 1  Gil Chesterton 
Frasier&#39;s KACL Coworker In Frasier
        

Gil Chesterton, host of KACL&#39;s &#34;Restaurant Beat&#34; only appeared in 29 episodes of the original series but became a celebrated fan favorite character thanks to his pithy exchanges with Frasier. The running gag in the original series involved Gil being in the closet, and it would be interesting to see if 20 years later Gil decided to embrace his sexuality and live his best life. Seeing him out and proud in the Frasier reboot would not only be a positive change for Gil, but also decrease the amount of derogatory gay jokes that the series made at his expense.
