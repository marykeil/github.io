# Normal People Ending, Explained


## SUMMARY 



  The ending of Normal People is emotional and ambiguous, leaving the future of the main characters, Connell and Marianne, hanging.   Despite their love for each other, Connell and Marianne&#39;s relationship is complicated and not any simpler than their previous romantic partners, making a carefree and happy ending unrealistic.   The final scene of Normal People hints at what could happen in the future but wraps up the story in a fairly mysterious way.

## Literature Review
The BBC miniseries Normal People follows the love story of two young adults, and the ending of the show is as memorable as the book it is based on.




The BBC miniseries Normal People is a clever adaptation of Sally Rooney&#39;s 2018 novel, and the ending is as emotional as it is ambiguous, as Connell Waldron (Paul Mescal) and Marianne Sheridan&#39;s (Daisy Edgar-Jones) future is left hanging. The story follows the characters as they fall in love in high school but are from different social backgrounds, as he is popular, and she is an outsider. This forces them to see each other in secret. Connell and Marianne have a complicated and sometimes painful relationship, as they get back together at Trinity College Dublin but struggle with speaking openly with one another and worrying about what other people think.




It makes sense to hope that by the final episode of the series Connell and Marianne stay together, but given the somber tone of the book and TV adaptation, a truly happy conclusion didn&#39;t appear likely. While the couple loves each other and has a difficult time opening up and relating to other romantic partners, they don&#39;t find their own relationship any simpler, which makes a carefree and happy ending seem unrealistic. The final scene of Normal People does hint at what could happen in the future, but it&#39;s a fairly mysterious way to wrap up the story.

 What Happens At The End Of Normal People? 
The Normal People Ending Reflects Connell And Marianne&#39;s Character Growth
         




In episode 12 of Normal People, Connell tells Marianne that he will go to New York for an MFA in Creative Writing program, and Marianne shares that she will continue to live in Dublin. The fact that they both make their own choices here shows that they have grown since the beginning of the story. Because Connell and Marianne are young in Normal People and are only 21 years old, at the most, in the end, they have shown signs of co-dependency and are unable to let go of each other. Now, however, they are each listening to their instincts and following their dreams.

The characters treat each other well in this final episode, as after Marianne enjoys Christmas at Connell&#39;s home, she is proud of him for being accepted into the MFA program and encourages him to live the life that he wants to lead. Because they are going to be living so far away, she shares that a long-distance romance would be a bad idea, but they will get together in one year and notice if any chemistry or sparks still exist. This is a contrast to the petty arguments and negative emotions that the two share earlier in the series.




Normal People is a strong young adult series because the characters have intense feelings and conversations that explore this strange and confusing time in their lives. Earlier in Normal People, Marianne is envious of Connell&#39;s girlfriend, Helen Brophy (Aoife Hinds), and Marianne and Connell are not honest about still being in love. In episode 12, they are able to share that they care about each other deeply but know that it isn&#39;t the right time to be together. At the start of the series, it doesn&#39;t appear that they would be able to approach the future in such a mature manner.

                  Normal People: 5 Realest Moments (&amp; 5 That Could&#39;ve Been Better)   Irish teen drama series Normal People seems to pride itself on realism, and, while it&#39;s certainly relatable, some things could&#39;ve been done better.    



 Do Connell &amp; Marianne End Up Together In The Book? 
The Normal People Novel Gives Even Less Away
          




Since the TV series gives more information, when comparing Normal People to the book, the TV ending offers the chance to reflect on how the characters have changed. In the novel, Connell has the opportunity to study writing through a Master&#39;s program at Cornell in Ithaca, but he doesn&#39;t make his choice. In the show, Connell is headed for New York and Marianne is going to remain in Dublin. It&#39;s smart to explain what each character wants to do, which makes the TV show ending much stronger than the novel&#39;s conclusion. While mysterious endings can work for the horror or thriller genre, they can be frustrating in a romantic drama.

However, both endings feature the same melancholy tone and the sentiment is the same: the strong characters in Normal People are not together at the present moment, and they will wait to make a more permanent choice about whether they will be together again. In both circumstances, the characters appreciate what they have meant to each other, although it seems that Marianne has changed the most as a result of their relationship. After growing up in a lonely home with her harsh mother, Denise (AislÃ­n McGuckin), and abusive brother, Alan (Frank Blake), Marianne didn&#39;t feel that anyone could love her.




Before Normal People, Sally Rooney wrote a short story called At The Clinic that was published in The White Review in 2016, and it depicts what happens to Marianne and Connell. They see each other again when they are 23 years old. Connell accompanies Marianne to the dentist as she is having her wisdom teeth taken out. The characters have just ended other relationships and realize that they still love each other. Rooney was inspired by this short story to write her novel, and even though the story came first, it&#39;s possible to view it as coming right after her novel&#39;s ending.

                  What To Expect From Hulu&#39;s Normal People Season 2   Will Normal People season 2 air on BBC Three and Hulu? IF so, when will new episodes premiere and what will the story be about? Here&#39;s what to expect.    



 The Impact Of Changing Aspects Of The Book Ending 
The Alterations Made The Ending Of Normal People Better
          




If the book ending hadn&#39;t been altered, episode 12 of Normal People wouldn&#39;t have had the same impact. Not finding out what Connell wants to do would be a shame, as he has become a more confident person through the course of his college years, and he doesn&#39;t want to run away from his feelings anymore. Like other great miniseries adapted from novels, creative decisions had to be made as what works on the page can feel lackluster on the small screen. What feels like a poetic conclusion in a book could feel unfinished on a TV series.

If Normal People had ended before Connell realized that he wanted to move away to study writing, he wouldn&#39;t appeared to have grown as much as a character, and neither would Marianne for telling him that, of course, he should go. This is the perfect conclusion because in sharing her opinion of his MFA acceptance, she is thanking him for what he has taught her and letting him know that she will be okay without him.



 The Real Meaning Of Normal People&#39;s Ending 
The Core Theme Of Normal People Is Love Isn&#39;t All That Matters
          




The ending of Normal People suggests that while love is important, so is identity, independence, and following dreams. The real, relatable moments in Normal People flesh out these characters, whether they are splitting up when they still love each other or accepting that they will never feel comfortable being vulnerable with others. It would be easy for Marianne to tell Connell that she will go with him to New York so that they can continue their romance, but she knows that wouldn&#39;t be fair to either of them. There might be anger or resentment if she did go with him, and she doesn&#39;t want to experience that.

The characters in Normal People learn a tough but valuable lesson about doing what will make them happy, not following other people, and staying honest. The ending shares the message that young adulthood is difficult and painful and, sometimes, people meet each other for a reason, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they will always remain in each other&#39;s lives, and that&#39;s alright.
