Summary

  Inspired by Brennan Lee Mulligan&#39;s character, Aabria Iyengar offers players a devil&#39;s bargain in Candela Obscura Chapter 3.   The success of Mulligan&#39;s character and the fun of playing with a hidden secret influenced Iyengar&#39;s decision.   Candela Obscura explores the monstrous elements and internal battles of its characters, delving into a different aspect of horror.  





Aabria Iyengar breaks down how Brennan Lee Mulligan&#39;s character in Dimension 20: Burrow&#39;s End inspired her to offer a similar devil&#39;s bargain to the player in Chapter 3 of Critical Role&#39;s Candela Obscura. Burrow&#39;s End is full of twists and turns, but perhaps one of the most shocking was the revelation that Mulilgan&#39;s character, Tula, had been a revenant the entire time after dying long before the beginning of the season. After seeing what Mulligan was able to do with this character, Iyengar wanted to offer a similar opportunity to the players of Candela Obscura, giving them the chance to start with a scar in exchange for an unexpected power.




During an interview with Screen Rant for Dimension 20: Burrow&#39;s End, Iyengar explained how Mulligan&#39;s choices influenced her decision to offer those characters a bargain at the start of Candela Obscura Chapter 3. She discussed how giving the players the option of taking a scar in order to gain something else came into play after the success of Mulligan&#39;s unexpected revenant character. Iyengar also broke down how the new season of Candela Obscura explores these monstrous elements of the characters. Check out Iyengar&#39;s full quote below:


Aabria Iyengar: 100%. Seeing what Brennan was able to do when he took my silly little devil&#39;s bargain in our session zero, or not even our session zero, our character gen. Watching him take that, and take that little bit of, &#34;What if I offer you something a little terrible,&#34; and it becomes your secret to keep. It becomes this little thing that informs so much of your choices that no one will know about until the reveal happens, and how fun it was to play that, and how fun it was to watch it.
It was definitely a thing that was like, &#34;New group. Hey, what if,&#34; and then, yeah, in exchange for a scar they got a little bit more of an ability. Everyone in Candela starts off with one scar, so they&#39;re all that much closer to oblivion across the three arc campaign chapter. I think seeing the success of how Tula felt was definitely a big mark in the, &#34;I think I can continue to offer this and see what new things I will get back from people from it.&#34; Yeah. Episode one, having all those big reveals up top...
You&#39;re all a little monstrous, and we should know why.&#34; Now the subsequent two episodes will be about the, &#34;Oh my God. What are they? What are they capable of? What are they fighting for, and what are they fighting, both within themselves and without, inside the world of the Fairlands?&#34;






 How Aabria Iyengar&#39;s Devil&#39;s Bargain Enhances The Story In Dimension 20: Burrow&#39;s End &amp; Candela Obscura 
         

While Dimension 20 often leans into comedy with emotional character arcs, Burrow&#39;s End tapped into horror in an unexpected way. Tula being a revenant was an exciting revelation that reflected not only the hardships of this world but also the devotion of family even in extreme circumstances. Motherhood was at the center of Burrow&#39;s End, including the lengths a mother would go to for their family, no matter how vicious.

                  Brennan Lee Mulligan Explains Matt Mercer&#39;s Meta Joke &amp; Time Jumps In Dimension 20   Exclusive: Dimension 20&#39;s Brennan Lee Mulligan explains the deeper meaning of Matt Mercer&#39;s meta-joke at the start of The Ravening War and time jumps.    

Mulligan&#39;s secret, once revealed, changes the perspective of every decision he makes throughout the game, including the fear that Tula lives with. Tula understands how harsh this world can be, not just because of the losses she has suffered but also because of her own decisions, first to give up due to grief and then to return out of sheer force of will and love. Iyengar bringing that same opportunity to the players in Candela Obscura opens the door to exploring a different corner of horror than in the previous two chapters.






Chapter 3 of Candela Obscura follows characters trying to hide how the monstrosities of this world have touched them.




For some, this means having a monstrous side of their own that they attempt to control, facing both internal and external demons. The world of Candela Obscura and the gaming system are perfectly set up for this bargain. Critical Role&#39;s Candela Obscura has delved into a different aspect of horror each season, but this one can truly explore the implications of this world and how it forever marks those fighting to protect it.
