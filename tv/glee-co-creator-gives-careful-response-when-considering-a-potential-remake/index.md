## Literature Review
Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk strikes a measured tone when addressing the potential of a remake and assesses the purpose of bringing back the dramedy.




Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk carefully responds about the potential for a remake. Falchuk co-created Glee with Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, with the Fox teen dramedy focusing in its initial seasons on a group of show choir kids, their passionate teacher, and the connections they form as they compete on the show choir circuit. The show grew to a massive hit in its first few years, running for six seasons and a total of 121 episodes.




In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss his new Netflix action comedy The Brothers Sun, Falchuk was asked about the possibility of revisiting Glee. Falchuk responds candidly and expresses doubt that a revisit would work. He says in part: “I wonder what the point would be — except it’d be a moneymaker.” Read his full comment below: 


I’m sure everything is always on the table, but is there a way to tell that story in a more modern way? So much of what Glee was about was really this transition from an old way of looking at representation to a new way. I’d never say no, but I wonder what the point would be — except it’d be a moneymaker.



 How The Cast and Crew Reacted To A Potential Reboot 
          

In a testament to its staying power, there have been frequent questions about rebooting Glee since the series ended in 2015. Fox Entertainment President Michael Thron mentioned the musical dramedy among the titles he would love to revive when asked in 2021. The cast has also weighed in, with star Jane Lynch sharing her view that the story couldn&#39;t be remade today as it was back then. Other former cast members have said the same, pointing to Glee&#39;s problematic aspects that would have to be changed.




Ryan Murphy has talked about rebooting Glee, mentioning his desire to do a Broadway take on the story. In the same vein, however, the co-creator acknowledged that Glee was a unique experience and noted that there wouldn&#39;t be another experience like it. Beyond these general statements, there haven&#39;t been any concrete efforts to bring back the Emmy-winning series.

Murphy has arguably become better known for the American Horror Story franchise, again collaborating with Falchuck, alon his stylized takes on true events. Falchuck himself just debuted The Brothers Sun, co-created by Bryron Wu and led by Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh. It seems that Glee will remain in the past, at least for the time being, since the creative team is focused on other projects.
