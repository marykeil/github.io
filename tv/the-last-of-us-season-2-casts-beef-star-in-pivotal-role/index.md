## Literature Review
The Last of Us season 2 recruits Beef&#39;s Young Mazino in a key role, marking another big casting choice for the highly anticipated installment.




The Last of Us season 2 casts Young Mazino in a critical role for season 2. Mazino is a breakout star known for his role in recent Golden Globe winner Beef. After an award-winning first season, The Last of Us will begin filming soon for its sophomore season, which will be based on the video game sequel The Last of Us: Part II.




According to Entertainment Weekly, Mazino has now been cast as Jesse for The Last of Us season 2. Jesse is a character from the video games who HBO describes as “a pillar of his community who puts everyone else’s needs before his own, sometimes at a terrible cost.” Of Mazino’s casting, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann said:


“Young is one of those rare actors who is immediately undeniable the moment you see him. We’re so lucky to have him, and we can’t wait for the audience to see Young shine in our show.”



 Why The Last Of Us Season 2 Cast Is So Exciting 
          

Mazino’s casting comes after The Last of Us confirmed another major season 2 casting this week. After much speculation and hype for the role, the show recruited Kaitlyn Dever for the role of Abby for season 2. Dever and Mazino will join a cast mainly dominated by leads Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal, both of whom will be returning for season 2. Tommy actor Gabriel Luna is also expected to return, which means Maria actor Rutina Wesley is likely to come back.




Mazino and Dever&#39;s casting comes when both actors have found lots of recent success on TV and in movies. Having acted in only a few one-off TV episodes, Mazino was a breakout star when he played Paul Cho on the Netflix series Beef, showcasing his “immediately undeniable” charm. Dever has a rich acting resume but has recently earned mainstream attention for her roles in No One Will Save You, Booksmart, and the TV series Dopesick.

                  8 Great The Last Of Us Theories That Season 2 Should Confirm   With the great success of HBO&#39;s The Last of Us season 1, there&#39;s even more excitement about which theories season 2 could potentially confirm or deny.    

It will be interesting to see how Joel and Ellie interact with the new characters in season 2. In particular, The Last of Us season 1 finale ends with both survivors returning to Jackson to reunite with Tommy&#39;s community, but their relationship seems to have crumbled after Joel&#39;s actions at the Firefly facility. Hence, season 2 is expected to showcase the complications of their relationship, with the new characters expected to play a part in their forthcoming journey. With The Last of Us season 2 continuing its development, more casting announcements are likely to happen soon as the team finalizes the lineup and prepares for production.
