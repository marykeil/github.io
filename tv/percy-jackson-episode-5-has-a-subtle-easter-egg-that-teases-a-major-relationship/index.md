Summary

  Percy Jackson episode 5 includes an Easter egg with Annabeth calling Percy &#39;Seaweed Brain&#39; for the first time, a nickname used throughout the book series.   The moment in episode 5 signifies the beginning of Percy and Annabeth seeing each other as true friends, solidifying their relationship&#39;s foundation.   Annabeth&#39;s use of the nickname &#39;Seaweed Brain&#39; is satisfying because it teases the long and satisfying build-up of Percy and Annabeth&#39;s relationship in the books.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 includes a subtle Easter egg to the original book series that teases an important relationship for the series&#39; future. After the major story reveals in Percy Jackson episode 4, episode 5 picks up where the former left off. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover continue their way west before encountering Ares, the god of war, who sends the children on an errand in return for aid in their quest for Zeus&#39; master bolt.

For every story reveal found in the installment, there was an equal amount of Easter eggs found in Percy Jackson episode 4. This only continued with Percy Jackson episode 5 as the Disney&#43; show adapted one of the more iconic chapters of Rick Riordan&#39;s original book. With more of Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek gods making an appearance in place of a new batch of mythological monsters, one subtle Easter egg found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 will play a big role in a certain relationship going forward.

                  Every Mythological Species &amp; Monster In Percy Jackson Season 1 Explained   Percy Jackson and the Olympians includes many monsters, creatures, species, and races from the world of Greek mythology in its opening season.    





 Percy Jackson Episode 5 Includes Annabeth’s Nickname For Percy 
          

The Easter egg in question comes as Annabeth and Percy are arguing over how to retrieve Ares&#39; shield from Hephaestus&#39; trap. Percy offers to sit on the golden throne that he knows will hold him forever, leading Annabeth to call Percy Seaweed Brain for the first time. This is a nickname that Annabeth has for Percy in the original Percy Jackson books and is used throughout all five stories.

However, Percy Jackson and the Olympians has not featured this nickname at all to this point. Percy Jackson episode 5 is the first time Annabeth calls Percy by this name, making for a satisfying moment for book fans but also making sense within the context of the story. The reason for this is that the events of Percy Jackson episode 5 are the first moments in which Percy and Annabeth begin to see each other as true friends. Including Annabeth&#39;s nickname for Percy at this moment, which goes on to become a term of endearment as the series progresses, is a perfect way of solidifying the foundations of their relationship.






 Percy &amp; Annabeth’s Relationship Is One Of The Best Book Stories 
          

Annabeth&#39;s use of the name Seaweed Brain is so satisfying due to her and Percy&#39;s relationship being one of the best book stories. The reason for this is that the growing relationship between the two is rarely the major focus, at least romantically. For the first four books, it is made clear that Annabeth and Percy have growing crushes on one another, but the characters&#39; young ages mean it is thankfully never touched on much more than subtle hints and teases.

It is only in the fifth book of the series, Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian, that Annabeth and Percy become a couple once they turn 16. By this point, the slow build-up of their friendship becomes incredibly satisfying as the relationship feels completely earned. Through Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5&#39;s usage of Annabeth&#39;s Seaweed Brain nickname for Percy, the first teases at the long build of their relationship are being planted.




New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians release every Tuesday on Disney&#43;.
