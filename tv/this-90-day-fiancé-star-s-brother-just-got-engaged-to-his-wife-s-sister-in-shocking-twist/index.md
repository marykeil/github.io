Summary

  There&#39;s a surprise twist surrounding 90 Day Fiancé: Sam Wilson&#39;s brother is now engaged to his wife Citra&#39;s sister.   Citra shares her excitement over her sister&#39;s engagement to Sam&#39;s brother, despite their occasional disagreements.   Sam and Citra&#39;s complicated journey includes a canceled wedding, family involvement, addiction struggles, and now accusations of a Green Card marriage.  







A 90 Day Fiancé couple’s storyline has taken an unexpected turn in 2024: the male cast member’s brother will be getting married to his wife’s sister soon. 90 Day Fiancé has been following international couples on their journeys to the altar. These journeys are rarely easy because they involve visa issues, cultural shocks, language differences, family difficulties, and baby drama. With the couple having just 90 days left to wed, the show documents their cold feet and excitement as they reconsider their decision to get married as the three months come to an end. This new 90 Day Fiancé season 10 couple, however, had just one major obstacle to cross before getting married.

Sam Wilson had yet to tell Citra’s father about his recent arrest and how he was facing potential jail time while wondering if Herman would take Citra back to Indonesia, but InTouch has confirmed that Sam’s brother is now engaged to Citra’s sister.

          




In an Instagram Story, Citra confirmed that her sister Nafa got engaged to Sam’s brother Timmy. “I’m so happy for both of them even though they can be such a pain our a**es sometimes,” Citra wrote in her update. She admitted she never thought her sister and Sam’s brother would end up together. “I know God has [a] mysterious way for everything,” she added.

 Sam &amp; Citra&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

According to Citra, Sam was going to come to Indonesia alone to get married to her, but the wedding was canceled. Citra’s father and her two sisters joined them before the wedding in Missouri. Citra was glad that she brought her family to America to meet Sam’s family. She was happy that her sister got out of a toxic relationship and began dating Timmy. Citra claimed she had tried to set up Timmy with some of her friends in Indonesia, but he was “so cold for girls out there.” She’s thrilled that Timmy and Nafa “got the easy way” because both know everything about each other’s families.





 

Sam and Citra got married near Cameron on September 10, 2023, as per Starcasm. They had met on a dating app over three years ago when a curious Citra messaged him to ask about his “baby face.” Two years later, Sam went to Indonesia to get engaged to Citra. She soon came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. Considering Citra is Muslim, Sam was going to convert to the religion before their wedding. Sam and Citra also couldn’t get intimate before they married.

Meanwhile, Sam, who had battled addiction in the past, was arrested in 2023 for carrying Suboxone without a prescription. Sam didn’t tell Citra about it as he was scared she would leave him. Little did Sam know that both he and his brother would marry into the Indonesian family. Citra and her sister are now being accused of using Sam and Timmy for a Green Card. It is suspected that Citra had always planned to bring all her family to America. Regardless, Timmy and Nafa’s romance is one to watch out for. It’s very likely they could be a part of either 90 Day Fiancé or one of the spin-offs.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
