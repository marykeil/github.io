## Literature Review
A preview of Sister Wives Talk Back shows Robyn Brown trying to calm Kody Brown down when he loses his temper while replying to a fan’s comment.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown explodes after feeling insulted by a fan’s comment. The 54-year-old man was happily married to his four wives in 2010. However, things changed when he started spending most of his time with his fourth wife, Robyn Brown, leaving Meri, Janelle, and Christine jealous and alone. While the polygamous family remained functional for nearly 10 years, the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be tough for them. During that time, Kody’s lack of concern pushed his other wives to seek other options. They divorced him one by one, forcing Kody to be monogamous with Robyn.




However, Kody is still very emotional and furious about the demise of his plural marriage. TLC recently posted a preview of Sister Wives season 18&#39;s Talk Back special, which showed Kody getting outraged at a fan.


 

The fan said, “I think it’s awesome that you guys found each other,” stating that Kody needs to show off his love with Robyn. However, Kody didn’t appreciate the remark and found it offensive. The Sister Wives star responded, “Well, Jeff, I think you’re a victim,” before Robyn shut him down with her bare hands. Robyn requested Kody to stop, adding that the fan wasn’t mocking him but simply “being nice.”

Unfortunately, Robyn’s attempt at shutting Kody down proved futile. The Brown family patriarch continued his rant and gave the fan a piece of his mind. He said, “Listen, we didn’t want our family to break up,” asking the fan if it wasn’t obvious. Kody also accused the fan of “reading too many tabloids,” adding that he never wanted his family to break apart. The clip ended with Kody admitting he’s been through three divorces and isn’t a happy camper. He said, “I’m not nice,” letting the fan know he was not playing games.

Robyn was right to try to silence Kody before he said something that ruined his reputation. Unlike the Wyoming man, the Utah woman is clever and understands the circumstances. She doesn’t let anger drive her. In comparison, Kody has been all about rage and revenge. He’s suffering and might need help. Robyn tried her best to do damage control before things got out of hand. She did what she could to give Kody enough clues not to act erratically or say something he’d regret later.




Despite Robyn’s best attempts, Kody did make a big statement against the fans. While he didn’t directly insult the viewer, he said enough to get his point across. According to Kody, he never wanted to split up or give up on his plural marriage. He simply wanted the relationships to continue for the rest of his life. Kody told the fan not to be inspired by watching 20 hours of his life. He claims there’s more to the story than what fans watch. Therefore, the Sister Wives viewers shouldn’t judge him or his wife, Robyn.
