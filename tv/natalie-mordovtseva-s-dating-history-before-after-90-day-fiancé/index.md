## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Natalie Mordovtseva is coming back to the franchise with 90 Day: The Single Life. A look at her three failed marriages before Josh.




Natalie Mordovtseva is returning to 90 Day: The Single Life with a mission to make her relationship with Josh Weinstein work, but Natalie’s past suggests she is heading to Splitsville soon enough. Natalie is a 39-year-old woman from Ukraine who worked as a model and TV actress in Kyiv when she met Mike Youngquist from America. Mike and Natalie met when they were introduced to each other by their mutual friends Matt and Svitlana. Matt named Mike the godfather to his daughter Pollyanna and Natalie happened to be the godmother. Mike was smitten instantly by Natalie when he saw her photos.




Mike soon went to meet Natalie in person in Ukraine and on their second meeting, he proposed to her at the Eiffel Tower. Natalie had dreams of making it big in the U.S. Mike was from California and was living in Nevada when they started talking. However, Mike got a promotion and moved to Sequim. He believed in aliens, was a carnivore, and didn’t want kids, while religious and vegetarian Natalie was yearning for a baby. While opposites did attract, Mike and Natalie couldn’t work through their differences to create a successful relationship. Moreover, Natalie’s past also suggested she was not meant for success stories.

 Natalie&#39;s First Husband Is Zenon Pierides 

 




Natalie never mentioned Zenon on the show. However, 90 Day-Detectives did an outstanding job when they discovered the husband, Natalie, was keeping a secret. 90DayTheMelnatedWay shares photos of Natalie with Zenon from her first wedding. Natalie was married to Zenon for less than two years. She is supposed to have stayed in Cyprus with Zenon while she was married. Natalie returned home to Ukraine when Zenon reportedly filed for bankruptcy, where she soon met her next husband.



 Natalie&#39;s Second Husband&#39;s Name Is Mr. Podyakov 

 

Natalie’s second husband is the one she referred to as her ex in 90 Day Fiancé while comparing Mike to him. He is named Mr. Podyakov and Natalie was married to him for eight years (as shared by 90DayTheMelnatedWay.) Natalie said she left her husband because he wasn’t ready to have kids. Natalie said he was a big businessman and was formerly in the army. Natalie was going through her divorce with Mr. Podyakov when she met Mike via their common friends. One of the reasons behind their instant connection was that Mike was also in the process of getting a divorce from his first wife.






 Natalie Was Married To Mike Younguist For A Few Months 
         

Natalie had tossed her engagement ring in Mike’s suitcase when he was going to America. They were split during the Tell All and Natalie accused Mike of cheating on her by sleeping with his best friend Sarah. However, Natalie and Mike gave their romance a second chance when her K-1 visa was approved. She moved into Mike’s trailer in Sequim and complained about the woods and cold temperatures. Natalie and Mike got married in Clallam County, Washington on April 15, 2020. Their wedding was documented in 90 Day Fiancé season 8. Mike had almost canceled the wedding and married Natalie on the day her K-1 visa was about to expire.

Eight months later, Natalie and Mike were filming 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 6 in Oklahoma. They were visiting Mike’s mom, Trish, for Thanksgiving, when she got into an argument with Mike over Trish allegedly calling her a “hooker.” It was the last straw for Natalie, who left to stay with her friend Julia in Seattle on Christmas Eve 2020. Natalie’s next stop was in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she moved to start a career in acting and modeling.






 Natalie Is Still Together With Josh Weinstein 
          

Natalie briefly dated a man called Johnny with whom she’d attended a modeling workshop in Florida. There, she met a man called Josh who was the CEO of a modeling agency in Los Angeles. Natalie enjoyed her golfing date with Josh but wasn’t okay with him having had two kids with two different women. She still decided to date him, but Josh never gave her the “girlfriend” status because Natalie was still legally married to Mike. Amid the drama, Natalie returned to Sequim to meet Mike because he’d helped her mother out during the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

Natalie admitted she was torn between getting back together with Mike or continuing to date Josh. In the end, Natalie chose to stay with Josh as she has now moved to California to be close to him and focus on her career. Natalie was still together with Josh as of early 2023 but a current update on their relationship status is unavailable. All questions about Natalie’s current relationship status will surely be answered on 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.
