# Tacoma FD s McConky-Penisi Family Tree Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Tacoma FD features the McConky-Penisi Family, but the show&#39;s humor comes from the characters and their relationships with each other.   Eddie Penisi, Jr. is the class clown and jokester of the firehouse, but he still maintains good relationships with his co-workers and family.   Lucy McConky provides some female power to the show as a firefighter and shares a complicated but ultimately healthy relationship with her father, Terry.

## Literature Review
Tacoma FD centers around a group of firefighters, and the show keeps it all in the family – read for an explanation of the McConky-Penisi Family tree.




Although Tacoma FD tells the story of the firefighters at Station 24 in Tacoma, Washington, the show is also about family — specifically, the McConky-Penisi Family. The truTV sitcom television series was created by Kevin Heffernan and Steve Lemme (also two of the show&#39;s stars) and has lasted for four seasons — it is still waiting for news regarding a possible season 5 renewal. Its humor is pulled from the characters and their relationships with one another, and also the fact that this group of firefighters works in one of the wettest cities in America, meaning that they do not have many fires to fight.




Of course, Tacoma FD does not completely revolve around the McConky-Penisi Family. The main cast of the truTV series includes Kevin Heffernan as Chief Terry McConky, Steve Lemme as Captain Eddie Penisi, Jr., Marcus Henderson as Granny Smith, Eugene Cordero as Andy Myawani (who exited the show after season 3), Gabriel Hogan as Ike Crystal, Hassie Harrison as Lucy McConky, and Christopher Avila as Andy Mickleberry. Now that Tacoma FD was added to Netflix in January 2024, a new audience is being introduced to these characters and learning more about the McConky-Penisi Family. However, the family tree can get a bit convoluted, given how many members are not series regulars.


 Eddie Penisi, Sr. 
Played by Joe Pantoliano
          

The senior patriarch in Tacoma FD is Edward &#34;Eddie&#34; Caesar Penisi, Sr., played by Joe Pantoliano. Eddie Sr. is the fire commissioner in Tacoma, Washington, and he just so happens to be one of the main character&#39;s father. However, Eddie Sr. is a recurring character who does not appear in many episodes of the truTV sitcom. In fact, throughout the show&#39;s four seasons, the fire commissioner has only shown up in four episodes. Eddie Sr. was introduced in Tacoma FD season 2, episode 5, and it was evident that he was a bit hard on his son, Eddie Jr., and his son-in-law, Terry, since he expected them to uphold his reputation.




                  Tacoma FD Season 5: Will It Happen? Everything We Know   Tacoma FD season 5 would continue the story of the funny firefighters from the Northwest and here is everything known about the renewal.    



 Eddie Penisi, Jr. 
Played by Steve Lemme
          

Steve Lemme, one of the sitcom&#39;s co-creators, portrays Edward &#34;Eddie&#34; Caesar Penisi, Jr., aka Eddie Sr.&#39;s son, in Tacoma FD on truTV. Eddie Jr. is one of the main characters, having appeared in all 49 episodes, and he works as the captain for the &#34;A&#34; shift at Station 24 in Tacoma, Washington. So, he co-leads the squad with his brother-in-law, Terry (more on him below). Eddie Jr. is the class clown, jokester, and prankster of the firehouse, seeing that he rarely takes most things seriously. Eddie Jr. still has good relationships with most of his co-workers and family despite his tendency to fool around.






 Vicky Penisi-McConky 
Played by Heather Mazur
          

Vicky Penisi-McConky, played by Heather Mazur, does not work at Station 24, so she&#39;s a recurring player in the truTV sitcom television series. However, she is related to many of the main characters, so she appears more than the other supporting cast members. Vicky is Eddie Sr.&#39;s daughter, Eddie Jr.&#39;s sister, Terry&#39;s wife, and Lucy&#39;s mother; therefore, she plays an important role in the show and has starred in 18 episodes. Vicky seemingly has a good relationship with her family and is often the voice of reason when her loved ones are acting a bit too absurd in Tacoma FD.



 Terry McConky 
Played by Kevin Heffernan
          




As mentioned above, Kevin Heffernan co-created Tacoma FD with Steve Lemme, but he also stars as Terry McConky, one of the main characters in the series. Terry, who is married to Vicky, works as the chief at Station 24, so he leads the team of firefighters alongside his brother-in-law, Eddie Jr. Terry often tries (and usually fails) to reign in the chaos at the firehouse and is as strict as any character in a sitcom can be. He has three daughters with Vicky — Lucy, Kelsey, and Quinn. However, Terry is probably the closest to Lucy since she is his eldest daughter, and she follows in his footsteps and works for him as a firefighter at Station 24.



 Lucy McConky 
Played by Hassie Harrison
         

Lucy McConky provides the main cast of Tacoma FD with a bit of woman power, seeing as her portrayer, Hassie Harrison, is the only female series regular. Lucy works as a firefighter with her father, Terry, and uncle, Eddie Jr., at Station 24 in the truTV sitcom. She is very compassionate and caring but also participates in the shenanigans that her co-workers often get themselves into. As a result, Lucy sometimes butts heads with her father, but she and Terry share a healthy relationship at the end of the day. Lucy is also Eddie Sr.&#39;s granddaughter, Vicky&#39;s daughter, and Kelsey and Quinn&#39;s sister in the show.




                  What Happened To Andy In Tacoma FD? Eugene Cordero&#39;s Exit Explained   Eugene Cordero, who has played Andy Myawani since season 1, does not return for Tacoma FD season 4. Why did the actor leave the television show?    



 Kelsey McConky 
Played by Kelsey Heffernan
          

Terry and Vicky&#39;s other two daughters, aside from Lucy, are Kelsey and Quinn McConky. Kelsey is played by Kelsey Heffernan, who is assumingly Kevin Heffernan&#39;s daughter in real life, and she has only appeared in a couple of episodes. Consequentially, not much is known about Kelsey other than the fact that she is often embarrassed by her dad (and his drunken antics at parties, as seen in Tacoma FD season 4, episode 8.



 Quinn McConky 
Played by Quinn Heffernan
          




Just like her sister, Quinn McConky, played by Quinn Heffernan, has only starred in two episodes of Tacoma FD on truTV. Quinn&#39;s character is a bit of a mystery since she and Kelsey are much younger than their older sister, Lucy, so she is not around the firehouse very often. But Quinn is also ashamed of her father, Terry, and made him sign a contract promising he wouldn&#39;t get drunk at a party (which he did not stick to). Additionally, it might be safe to assume that Quinn Heffernan is Kevin Heffernan&#39;s other daughter in real life.

 Cousin Terry 
Played by Brett Davern
          




The final member of the McConky-Penisi Family in the truTV comedy series is Cousin Terry, played by Brett Davern. Cousin Terry is Terry&#39;s nephew and Lucy&#39;s cousin, seeing as his mother, Jasmine, is Terry&#39;s sister. However, Jasmine has not appeared on the show (yet). Cousin Terry is introduced in Tacoma FD season 4, episode 4 when it is revealed that he is a part of the &#34;D&#34; shift at Station 24. While Lucy and her cousin appear to have a good relationship at first, she often discovers how close he is to her father, making her jealous.



All four seasons of Tacoma FD are available to stream on Netflix and Max.
