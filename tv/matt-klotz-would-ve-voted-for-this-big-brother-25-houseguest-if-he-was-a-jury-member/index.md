## Literature Review
Big Brother 25 runner-up Matt Klotz avoided going to the jury house, but which houseguest would he have voted for if he didn&#39;t make it to the Final 2?




Big Brother season 25 runner-up Matt Klotz made it to the Final 2 when his Minutemen alliance member Jag Bains chose him over Bowie Jane, and Matt&#39;s now revealing which houseguest he would&#39;ve voted for if he&#39;d been a jury member instead. Matt and Jag formed their Final 2 Minutemen alliance weeks ago. Although Matt and Jag both considered betraying each other at various points, the latter ultimately stayed loyal to the former and brought him to the end with him. This was a risky move because he was pretty much guaranteed the win versus Bowie. However, Jag&#39;s decision paid off, and he won the $750,000 grand prize, while Matt took home $75,000 as the runner-up.




In an interview with EW, Matt revealed that he probably would&#39;ve voted for Jag instead of Bowie if he&#39;d been a Big Brother 25 jury member. However, he said, &#34;It goes back and forth.&#34; Matt explained, &#34;Bowie was kind of slept on. She won three HOHs all of a sudden after winning nothing all season...She was doing great.&#34; Despite this, Matt thinks that, ultimately, he might&#39;ve voted for Jag because &#34;I know he played a great game.&#34; Matt said that Jag was his &#34;shield,&#34; adding that his alliance member &#34;had a target on his back most of the time, and that&#39;s what my strategy was.&#34;

 Matt Klotz Admits He Was Unprepared For Big Brother 25 Jury Questions 
          

Matt, who is Deaf, confessed that he was unprepared for the jury&#39;s hard-hitting questions. He said, &#34;I think an on-the-spot speech, I&#39;m not the best at that. I&#39;ve got to focus to just hear the questions, so I&#39;m not really prepared of all that.&#34; Matt also admitted that he thought the jury&#39;s questions were &#34;pretty critical,&#34; and he&#39;d &#34;never even thought about&#34; some of them before finale night. He added, &#34;I was just kind of unprepared on the questions, but I know in my heart I played my best game, and I got to the final two playing my game...Whether the jury agreed with it or not, that&#39;s up to the jury.&#34;





 

Matt&#39;s loyalty to Jag throughout Big Brother 25 was admirable. Matt saved Jag from his unanimous eviction during week 4 with his Power of Invincibility, a power which he could&#39;ve saved for another week just in case he had to use it on himself. Jag really owed his whole game to Matt because he wouldn&#39;t even have been there to play if Matt hadn&#39;t saved him. However, Jag repaid the favor by keeping Matt safe when he won competitions. Jag truly did play a great game, winning three Head of Household (HOH) and seven Power of Veto competitions, and breaking the single-season Power of Veto and combined wins records.

Although Matt&#39;s answers to the jury&#39;s questions weren&#39;t as polished as Jag&#39;s, his sincerity came through as he answered them. As the first Deaf contestant to ever play the game, he pointed out that he had no blueprint to follow for how to navigate a game of whispered conversations. The fact that he was able to maintain such a strong social game was truly incredible. He truly blazed a new trail in the Big Brother house. Matt should be very proud of what he achieved as a Big Brother houseguest and runner-up.
