# Why There Wasn t A Below Deck Down Under Season 1 Reunion


## SUMMARY 



  Despite its popularity, Below Deck Down Under season 1 didn&#39;t have a reunion, likely due to budget constraints on Peacock&#39;s part.   However, cast members Aesha, Tumi, and Brittani held their own unofficial reunion on Instagram Live, discussing their experiences and providing updates on their lives.   The lack of an official reunion was disappointing for fans of the show, but the mini-reunion gave viewers a glimpse into the lives of the cast members post-season.

## Literature Review
Below Deck Down Under season 1 was impressive, but it was disappointing when it didn&#39;t get a reunion. Why didn&#39;t that happen?




Reunions are a great way to catch up with cast members months after filming has ended, but despite its popularity, Below Deck Down Under season 1 didn&#39;t have one. As the second-newest Below Deck spin-off following the premiere of Below Deck Adventure in November 2022, Captain Jason Chambers and his crew enjoyed a charter season abroad the Thalassa in mid-2022. Aesha Scott was impressive in her new role as chief steward, while second stew Tumi Mhlongo became increasingly popular throughout the season. In fact, the show became so popular that Below Deck Down Under season 2 aired in 2023.




Although the first season of Below Deck Down Under was a hit, it didn&#39;t escape criticism. Captain Jason&#39;s leadership skills were criticized and compared to Captain Sandy Yawn and Captain Lee Rosbach&#39;s, while third stew Madga Ziomek and Chef Ryan McKeown were eventually fired. With a solid mix of drama and entertainment showcased on the Australian spin-off, there was excitement to watch the reunion after Below Deck Down Under concluded. The lack of reunion was disappointing, and it&#39;s time to find out why.


 Below Deck Down Under Is Technically A Peacock Original 
          

While it&#39;s unclear why Below Deck Down Under season 1 didn&#39;t get a reunion episode, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s because, unlike its sister shows, Below Deck Down Under is not an original Bravo program. Several outlets like Distractify pointed out that while the other Below Deck spin-offs air on Bravo and then make their way to Peacock, Below Deck Down Under, like The Real Housewives of Miami reboot, is given the opposite treatment. Unfortunately, while it would&#39;ve been nice to revisit unpopular Below Deck crew members like Jamie Sayed, a reunion simply doesn&#39;t appear to have been in Peacock&#39;s budget.






 Several Below Deck Down Under Stars Held A Mini-Reunion 
          

Although neither Peacock nor Bravo decided to host a reunion for Below Deck Down Under, several cast members chose to hold an official one anyway. Shortly after the Below Deck Down Under finale in June 2022, Aesha, Tumi, and deckhand Brittani Burton reunited on Instagram Live to talk about their experiences and provide an update on some of their costars. Highlights of the unofficial Below Deck Down Under reunion include Aesha&#39;s travels with her boyfriend Scott Dobson, Tumi and Brittani&#39;s charter assignments after their time on Thalassa, and Brittani&#39;s United States road trip with the Below Deck fan favorite deckhand Culver Bradbury.
