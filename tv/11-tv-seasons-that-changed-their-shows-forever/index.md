Some of the best TV shows of all time have one particular season that is recognized as having irrevocably changed the show. A season midway through a series that marks a shift in tone or genre will have this effect. Alternatively, major characters leaving the show or new ones being introduced will result in important changes to the overall plot.
On the other hand, a certain season can alter the perception of an entire TV show because it marks a change in the quality of writing. While some shows start badly before things pick up in the second or third season, others hit a point where the writers run out of ideas, and one season is recognized as the beginning of the end. For example, the later seasons of The Twilight Zone and Game of Thrones clearly demonstrated how things were headed downhill.









 








 11  Downton Abbey Season 3 
Sybil and Matthew both die.
        

Downton Abbey season 3 was forced to contend with multiple major actors leaving the series. While Siobhan Finneran was written out as having Miss O&#39;Brien take another job, members of the Crawley family posed a bigger problem. The youngest Crawley daughter Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay) dies in childbirth midway through the season, and the estate&#39;s heir Matthew (Dan Stevens) dies in a car crash just after the birth of his son in the season finale.
These back-to-back deaths were shocking, especially after most of the main cast survived World War I in season 2. Following Sybil and Matthew&#39;s deaths, Downton Abbey begins several new storylines, especially for the deceased characters&#39; spouses. Lily James&#39; Lady Rose is also introduced near the end of season 3 to replace Sybil as the &#34;younger sister&#34; character.





 10  Grey&#39;s Anatomy Season 11 
Derek dies, first season without Christina, and the introduction of the &#34;sisters.&#34;
        

Grey&#39;s Anatomy changed forever when Sandra Oh left the show, with her character Christina taking a major job opportunity abroad. While Grey&#39;s Anatomy is still finding its footing after Christina&#39;s departure, the show&#39;s main romantic storyline between Meredith and Derek comes to an end when Derek is killed in a car crash near the end of season 11. The season ends with Meredith dancing at a wedding with Maggie and Amelia, introducing the trio of &#34;sisters&#34; who will be Meredith&#39;s main support and the focus of many storylines in future seasons. Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 11 is essentially an overall, establishing a new focal cast.

 9  Buffy The Vampire Slayer Season 6 
The season is ruined by Buffy&#39;s toxic relationship with Spike.


 







Spike and Buffy&#39;s relationship in Buffy the Vampire Slayer is controversial, to say the least. The vampire Spike is first introduced in season 2 as a straightforward villain whom Buffy fights for a few seasons before their enemies-to-lovers storyline begins in season 5. However, Buffy dies in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 5 ending. She then becomes depressed after being resurrected and begins a destructive relationship with Spike in season 6.
Buffy struggling with her mental health after literally dying and having to deal with Dark Willow would have been a fine storyline on its own. However, Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 6 is controversial because of Buffy and Spike&#39;s relationship, culminating in Spike sexually assaulting her after she breaks up with him. Buffy the Vampire Slayer ended after season 7, which problematically depicts Spike&#39;s redemption and frames him as a hero.





 8  Stranger Things Season 3 
The Russian lab becomes a threat to the residents of Hawkins.
        

Stranger Things season 3 reveals that the Russians have a secret lab in Hawkins, while the post-credits scene confirms that they are also studying the Upside Down. While the first two seasons establish the Hawkins Lab where Eleven was created, this is a fictional and mysterious threat that contributes to the tone of a horror movie. When the Russians become the main threat, the series becomes a type of historical fiction that incorporates supernatural elements into the Cold War setting. Stranger Things season 2 hints at the Russians&#39; potential interest in the Upside Down, but they do not fully become part of the story until season 3.





 7  The Twilight Zone Season 4 
A change in episode runtime signaled a downturn for The Twilight Zone.
        

Season 4 is recognized as the worst season of The Twilight Zone. During this season, The Twilight Zone abruptly abandoned its half-hour episode format for longer one-hour episodes, creating some awkwardly long storylines. This coincided with poorer writing, resulting in some of the worst episodes of the show, including &#34;I Dream of Genie,&#34; &#34;Jess-Belle,&#34; and &#34;The Bard.&#34; Despite season 5&#39;s return to the half-hour format, it is not well-regarded either. This demonstrates how season 4 was ultimately the end of The Twilight Zone&#39;s heyday.





 6  The Good Place Season 2 
Nothing is the same after the Good Place is revealed to be the Bad Place.
        

The entire plot of The Good Place changes when Eleanor correctly guesses (for the first time) that the seemingly perfect paradise the main characters have been brought to is actually the Bad Place. While season 1 is about Eleanor trying to stay in &#34;the Good Place,&#34; believing she has been sent there by mistake, season 2 onward broadens the show&#39;s depiction of the afterlife with an increasingly complicated plot. Michael&#39;s character is developed, as he is initially determined for his experiment to work without the humans guessing the truth. Michael then becomes an ally of the humans as they try to avoid going to the real Bad Place.





 5  Doctor Who Season 12 
The Timeless Child twist retconned all of Doctor Who.
        

Jodie Whittaker changed Doctor Who by becoming the first woman to play the title character. Additionally, the second season of her run as the Doctor retconned a major plot point in the series&#39; lore. The Doctor Who season 12 ending reveals that the Doctor is not a Time Lord, as has been the assumption for most of the show&#39;s run. The Doctor is revealed to be the Timeless Child, a billion-year-old whose genetics are the basis of the Time Lord race. Despite the Timeless Child twist having no real effect on the plot, Doctor Who season 14 must handle the Timeless Child retcon in one way or another.





 4  Game Of Thrones Season 7 
Daenerys and Jon meet and the writing quality takes a downward turn.


 







While Game of Thrones&#39; final season is generally disliked, its seventh season is mostly fine. Some indicators of future story problems appear, such as hints of Daenerys becoming the &#34;Mad Queen.&#34; However, Game of Thrones season 7 also marks a turning point in the series as many separate storylines begin to converge. Jon and Dany finally meet, while the remaining Stark siblings reunite (Jon does not see Arya and Bran again until season 8, but Sansa writes to tell him they survived). Season 7 is in a gray area, as many long-awaited storylines come to fruition while the plot elements that will destroy the show begin to take shape.





 3  Lost Season 3 
Showing that the characters escape the island changed the tone of Lost.
        

In Lost season 3, the strange island setting continues. However, the season finale is the true game-changer. A major storyline in season 3 centers around the survivors trying to contact Desmond&#39;s girlfriend Penny, who could help them escape. In the famous &#34;Not Penny&#39;s Boat&#34; scene, Charlie seemingly dashes these hopes before he drowns. However, the episode&#39;s flashback is revealed to be a flashforward where some of the main characters have escaped the island. This sets up a new tone for season 4 because the audience now knows that they cannot depend upon a linear narrative and that at least some of the characters will make it off the island, only to potentially return.

 2  Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 7 
Ashoka returns and the timeline overlaps with Revenge of the Sith.


 







The seventh season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars is unique for several reasons. Anakin&#39;s apprentice Ahsoka leaves the Jedi Order after being framed for bombing a temple in The Clone Wars season 6 finale, the series&#39; apparent ending. When the show was revived for another season, Ahsoka returned but did not rejoin the Jedi Order. Ahsoka stands out in season 7 as a Jedi who has left the order but does not become a Sith. Her name has been cleared, and she is an ally to the other Jedi in season 7, but she is still disenchanted with the institution itself.
Meanwhile, the timeline of The Clone Wars begins to overlap with Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.The Clone Wars previously existed as an almost entirely separate Star Wars installment and season 7 brings it much closer to the live-action movies. While season 7 has an intriguing plot, it is jarring to see Anakin moments before a scene in Revenge of the Sith, when his characterization is so different in The Clone Wars.





 1  Supernatural Season 4 
Different mythology leads to Castiel and Lucifer&#39;s introduction.
        

The first several seasons of Supernatural focus on brothers Sam and Dean Winchester hunting standard monsters such as vampires and werewolves. Supernatural season 4 changes the show by beginning to incorporate biblical lore into the plot. Characters such as the angel Castiel and the devil Lucifer are now inseparable from Supernatural in fans&#39; minds. However, some would argue that biblical lore has always been essential to Supernatural because the Winchesters have been fighting demons since season 1 (via CBR). While this season of Supernatural may have changed a show for the better by introducing fan-favorite characters, several other examples undeniably changed their shows for the worse.
