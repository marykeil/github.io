## Literature Review
Raquel Leviss&#39; absence in Vanderpump Rules season 11 leaves narrative holes from unfinished business to missed chances for redemption.




Vanderpump Rules followers are disappointed as Rachel Leviss announced her decision to bow out from season 11, premiering on January 15, 2024. Rachel&#39;s departure follows the explosive revelation of her undercover months-long affair with co-star Tom Sandoval. While Rachel cites prioritizing her mental health as the primary motivation behind the exit, speculation runs rife among those interested in the show as they wonder if she&#39;ll regret not being able to defend her actions and restore her reputation. As the drama extends off-screen, observers ponder the repercussions of Rachel&#39;s avoidance of the show and how this decision could affect storylines. Her void could also cast a shadow over the forthcoming season.




In Vanderpump Rules season 11, Rachel&#39;s absence deprives her of a golden opportunity for self-reflection. Rachel&#39;s missing presence overlooks her unresolved matters following the Scandoval cheating scandal, leaving viewers curious about potential resolutions. Once a fan favorite, Rachel could have used this season to mend fences with her castmates and redefine her image. The absence also sidelines her personal growth while denying those tuning into the show a chance to witness the evolution of her relationships and the aftermath of past controversies. Without Rachel&#39;s attendance, the show misses out on a compelling narrative arc and loses a chance to delve into the tangled webs she weaved.


 Unfinished Business Post-Scandoval 
          

Ariana Madix unleashed a torrent of harsh words on Rachel during the record-breaking Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion, branding her &#34;diabolical, demented, disgusting&#34; and &#34;sub-human.&#34; Rachel, in defense, argued for humanity in making mistakes. The VanderPump Rules cast, however, united against her perspective, denouncing her rationale. People reported that during a BravoCon 2023 panel, VanderPump Rules producer Sheonna Mix hinted at regrets over Rachel&#39;s absence in season 11. Sheonna suggested it would have been &#34;more rewarding&#34; for Rachel to return despite the fallout from Scandoval. While stopping short of calling her retraction a mistake, Sheonna expressed believing Rachel has untold stories and unfinished business that could have added depth.






 Raquel Was a Fan Favorite &amp; Could Have Redeemed Her Reputation 
          

At a BravoCon 2023 panel titled &#34;Spilling Vanderpump Tea With Bravo Producers,&#34; Sheonna addressed Rachel&#39;s negative comments about not returning for season 11. USWeekly reported that despite the issues raised, Sheonna voiced excitement about working with Rachel during her season 10 narrative. Producers and fans of Vanderpump Rules anticipated Rachel&#39;s liberation from a longstanding, unhealthy relationship with James Kennedy, hoping she would embrace her individuality. Though Rachel remains distant, producers still see her in a positive light. Sheonna added, &#34;I will say that this team has loved her since she was a student traveling in [to film]. I still love her. We still very much love her.&#34;

If she returned, Rachel could have orchestrated a heartfelt sit-down with co-stars Scheana Shay, Charli Burnett, and the rest of the cast for open communication and closure.
