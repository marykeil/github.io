## Literature Review

Dubai Blingâ€™s Kriss Fade and DJ Bliss had their feud dominate parts of season 2. However, how did the beef between the two media personalities start?




Dubai Bling stars Kriss Fade and DJ Bliss&#39; decade-year-old feud dominated their season 2 stint. Kriss and Bliss made their reality TV debut in Dubai Bling season 1, during which fans learned about their personal lives, careers, and friendships with Dubai Bling co-stars. While Dubai Bling season 1 featured several dramatic moments, Kriss and Bliss ended the season as two of the less dramatic cast members.




However, when Dubai Bling season 2 premiered, one of the storylines that surprised fans was the feud between Kriss and Bliss. The duo had ended Dubai Bling season 1 without any apparent clash, and fans couldn&#39;t understand where and how the new drama had originated. Although some fans believe the feud felt forced and unoriginal, specific details from the season indicate there might be real bad blood between the duo.

 Are Kriss &amp; Bliss Just Too Competitive? 
         

Kriss and Bliss both work in the music and media industry, which has made them competitors throughout their careers. However, when they debuted on Dubai Bling, their similar careers didn&#39;t seem to be a problem until Dubai Bling season 2 premiered. According to Bliss, he once asked Kriss to collaborate on a gig, but Kriss allegedly snubbed him. The incident, which happened more than ten years ago, deeply hurt Bliss, who claimed he and Kriss haven&#39;t been friends since. Bliss also claims that Kriss is his biggest rival in the music industry, which might be why Bliss and his wife, Daria, were not invited to Kriss and Brianna&#39;s wedding.






 What Happened With Kris &amp; Bliss During Dubai Bling Season? 

 

Kriss and Bliss had one of the most surprising relationship dynamic changes in Dubai Bling season 2. Despite being quite cordial during the first season, Bliss could not stop talking about a supposed beef. However, despite Bliss&#39;s attempts to get confrontational with Kriss, the latter tried to ignore the drama. Nonetheless, things between the duo became weird when Bliss confronted Kris at a tattoo shop. However, Kris, who wanted no drama, tried to leave, leading to Bliss chasing Kris around a tattoo shop. For most of the season, Bliss and his wife Daria also tried to influence Ebraheem not to invite Kris to his wedding (via Reality Titbit).



 Will Dubai Bling&#39;s Kriss &amp; Bliss Make Up? 
          




Despite Bliss&#39; attempts to get a reaction from Kriss, Kriss did very well to avoid the drama throughout the season. Kris and Bliss have known each other for more than a decade. The resurgence of a feud over a failed collaborative effort several years ago felt unnecessary, since both have been hugely successful in their careers since then. Also, it takes two to tango, and Kriss seems uninterested in all the drama Bliss is trying to start, so it&#39;s hugely likely the duo will resolve their issues soon. Hopefully, by the time Dubai Bling returns to the screen, Kriss and Bliss will have put this drama behind them.
