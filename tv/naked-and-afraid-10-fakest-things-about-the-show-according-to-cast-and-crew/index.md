## Literature Review
Is everything that happens on Naked and Afraid real, or are some of it faked for entertainment?Â Here are some of the fakest things about it.





Naked and Afraid as a concept is brilliant, putting together two contestants who meet for the first time stranded in the wild and left to fend for themselves. The icing on top is that they are also left without any clothes to wear. The reality TV show has been a massive success since it started in 2013; the most recent season, Naked and Afraid: Last One Standing, was airing earlier this year and was as popular as ever.
There have been some amazing moments on the show throughout the years, with many of its contestants impressing viewers with their survival skills. While Naked and Afraid can be cringey, it still provides endless entertainment. Yet, there are questions about whether everything that happens on Naked and Afraid is real or if some aspects are staged for entertainment.









 








 10  The Cast Can Bring More Than One Personal Item 
Only Certain Items Are Allowed


 







The stakes are high in Naked and Afraid, not only because survivors are without clothes and have lived in the wild but also because they are supposedly only allowed to bring one item. This rule seems to have been changed behind the scenes. Former Naked and Afraid contestant Honora Bowen noted on her website, &#34;My partner and I each brought four survival items.&#34; While this may be the case, the showrunners stop them from bringing certain items like a water purifier.





 9  The Drinking Dirty Water Storyline Was Faked 
They Are Given Real Water
        

There&#39;s a good chance that anyone trying to survive in the wild will fall sick. One of the contestants from the show, Phaedra Brothers, ended up falling ill, and it was portrayed that it happened due to her drinking dirty water. However, the reality is far less scary; she had food poisoning. According to Channel Guide Magazine, Phaedra told a crew member about how she had been surviving on granola bars, and the crew member prepared a chicken curry dish to have some protein. Unfortunately, Phaedra ended up getting food poisoning from it.





 8  The Cast Can Ask For Help 
They Have An Emergency Radio


 







While the show&#39;s premise revolves around contestants trying to survive independently, the production crew must consider emergencies. In an interview with Reality Blurred, producer Steve Rankin noted that Naked and Afraid cast members are given an emergency radio and walkie-talkie to contact the crew in case of need. They are also provided with a whistle, which they can use to alert the team for immediate assistance.





 7  Storylines Are Scripted 
Contestants Are Told To Lie About Some Storylines


The main aim of any reality TV show is to be entertaining, and it&#39;s not entertainment without some added drama. Sometimes, the show producers instruct participants to lie about certain things. For example, Honora shared that the Naked And Afraid showrunners told her to lie about the origins of the magnifying glass by saying that it was a gift from her father. In reality, though, the magnifying glass was given to her by a crew member. She even stated that her storyline about her father passing away was also decided before filming.





 6  Female Participants Do Get Hygiene Products 
Showrunners Prove Assistance Here
        

Surviving in the wild without assistance is difficult, but it becomes even more complicated when female participants deal with specific hygiene issues among the wildlife. The Naked And Afraid showrunners provide some assistance to help them deal with these situations. For example, female participants are given sanitary products like tampons or pads. However, their usage is discreet to maintain the show&#39;s authenticity.





 5  Food Is Not Always Scarce 
Contestants Have Stolen From The Crew
        

Naked and Afraid is one of the most dangerous reality TV shows out there. Finding food is one of the hardest things to do for survival in the wild, and it seems like that from the show. Contestants are mostly hunting or scavenging for food during the runtime. Nonetheless, the situation isn&#39;t as dire as people would believe. Cast members sometimes ask for food items from the crew and even steal their food. Some contestants have stolen vitamin C packets, salt, chocolate, and alcohol. Although this is not the norm, the crew can help the contestants in dire situations.





 4  The Events Are Not Linear 
Everything Is Heightened For Drama


 







It&#39;s common for reality TV shows to edit things to heighten the tension or drama in the episode. However, there are also some glaring continuity issues within the same attacks that hint towards either the crew helping the cast members or the footage being used from another period. For example, a Reddit thread started by leavethemwithnothing noted that in one of the scenes, &#34;It went from clean-shaven Jeff to bearded Jeff, back to clean-shaven Jeff.&#34; Another discrepancy that viewers noted was when contestants were paddling a boat to the water, and in the next scene, the ship magically had palm trees on top of it.





 3  Character Portrayals Are Not Always True 
Fans Called Shane Lewis &#34;Pathetic&#34;
        

Shane Lewis, one of the contestants from the show, was shown to be suffering from a minor foot injury. He was also shown to suffer a lot in the episode, and some viewers started to see him as &#34;pathetic.&#34; It was later revealed by Daily Mail that Shane had broken three of his toes within the first couple of days into the challenge. While it&#39;s unclear why the extent of his injury was subdued in the final cut, it gave the wrong impression about his personality.





 2  The Show Does Not Always Take Place In Remote Areas 
Locals Have Seen Naked And Afraid Contestants
        

While it seems from the show that the contestants are dropped off in remote areas with no access to civilization, the reality is milder. Yes, they are dropped off among the wildlife, but the location is chosen based on its proximity to emergency services and, in some cases, even close to small towns. There have also been reports of contestants coming across residents from the local towns. This makes sense if the producers have to devise an emergency evacuation plan. But even with these caveats, Naked and Afraid is one of the most creative reality TV shows.





 1  The Fights Can Be Scripted 
Fights Have Been Staged By Producers
        

It&#39;s natural for two people to be stuck in a stressful environment to get into brawls and arguments. While this also happened on Naked and Afraid, the producers edited or staged some fights. Many things said between the contestants that led to conflicts were edited and shortened, and much was shown without context. Supposedly, producers even entirely staged some fights on Naked and Afraid.
