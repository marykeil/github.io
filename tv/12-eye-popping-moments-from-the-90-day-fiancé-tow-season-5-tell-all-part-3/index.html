Kenny rushed behind her to console Holly, where he convinced her to work on their communication issues. Kenny asked Holly to figure out why Wayne wasn’t providing her with emotional support. She then called up Wayne and apologized to him for crying. Wayne said Holly’s behavior was draining him, and she admitted it wasn’t fair to Wayne because he was going through his own issues. “I wanna be with you again,” Holly told him.
Wayne said that while they had a lot of things to work on, he still believed that Holly was his soulmate. “We’re meant to be together,” he declared.

Sarper confessed there was something else that Shekinah didn’t know about him. He fished out a notebook, which he claimed was from 1998 to 2012. He had been recording his body count in his book, marked with an “x” in blue pen, and the ones in color would indicate how “pretty” each girl was. Sarper had 1459 entries in his notebook. He mentioned that in the 11 years before he met Shekinah, he had made a “rough calculation of thousands.”</p>
<p>10  Mary Recalls Her Labor Scare During Pregnancy
Mary Thought She Was Going To Die</p>
<p>Mary and Brandan revealed details about their baby girl, Midnight. They announced their baby was one month old when they filmed the Tell All. Host Shaun Robinson told the crowd that the couple faced some intense moments during the delivery. Mary explained that the baby had its umbilical cord tied around its neck. It had been wrapped around three times in addition to Mary’s placenta being low in a condition called “previa.” Mary had to undergo a C-section and had to stay awake. She said she needed oxygen and was scared. Mary even left Brandan a note on her phone because she feared she was going to lose her life.</p>
<p>9  Brandan Says He Calls Mary A &lsquo;Bit**&rsquo; To Provoke Her
Brandan Reveals His True Colors</p>
<p>Mary said that Brandan was still unable to control video game addiction after becoming a father. Moreover, Mary was scared he would get angry at her if she approached him while he was playing. Brandan shouts at her and says terrible things, such as a “scammer” who is happy only as long as she has money. Brandan also called Mary a “bit**.” He claimed he didn’t mean what he said and only wanted Mary to get upset at him and fight back. Kalani Faagata accused Brandan of being narcissistic for calling her names to get a reaction.</p>

Brandan&rsquo;s Mother, Angela, Was Helping Them Financially</p>
<p>Brandan’s mother, Angela, revealed that the couple approached her for financial help, but she was fine doing it for her son and granddaughter. When asked how they were managing the baby&rsquo;s expenses, Brandan said they were already “prepared” by getting clothes, diapers, etc, before her arrival. Mary said they had reopened their business and were making money from it. Brandan didn’t expect to ask Angela for money again. However, Andrei Castravet and Armando reminded Brandan that he eventually will because raising a baby is expensive.</p>
<p>7  Shekinah &amp; Sarper Accuse Andrei Of Being Manipulative
Sarper Calls Andrei The &ldquo;Most Toxic&rdquo; Man</p>
<p>Mary’s provocative social media videos were shown to cast members during the Tell All.

They asked Shekinah to share an example of an aspect of her relationship where she needed to take responsibility. Shekinah couldn’t answer Daniele’s question. As Kalani talked about having a controlled family life, leading to her making poor decisions, Shekinah told Kalani not to insert her issues into her relationship.</p>

The woman said Yohan approached her via her DMs by sending a message at 11 p.m. while asking her if she was married and had kids. He then invited Memori to visit the Dominican Republic and that he would show her around. Yohan had told Memori that he was single and going through a divorce and that Daniele was trying to take “everything” from him.

She said she had refused Yohan’s advances and that she was sorry for the role she played in the situation. Daniele was sure Yohan and the woman had a physical relationship.
