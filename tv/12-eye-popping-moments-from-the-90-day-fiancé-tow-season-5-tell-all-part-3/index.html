She then called up Wayne and apologized to him for crying. Wayne said Holly’s behavior was draining him, and she admitted it wasn’t fair to Wayne because he was going through his own issues. “I wanna be with you again,” Holly told him.
Wayne said that while they had a lot of things to work on, he still believed that Holly was his soulmate. “We’re meant to be together,” he declared.

He had been recording his body count in his book, marked with an “x” in blue pen, and the ones in color would indicate how “pretty” each girl was. Sarper had 1459 entries in his notebook. He mentioned that in the 11 years before he met Shekinah, he had made a “rough calculation of thousands.”</p>

Host Shaun Robinson told the crowd that the couple faced some intense moments during the delivery. Mary explained that the baby had its umbilical cord tied around its neck. It had been wrapped around three times in addition to Mary’s placenta being low in a condition called “previa.” Mary had to undergo a C-section and had to stay awake. She said she needed oxygen and was scared. Mary even left Brandan a note on her phone because she feared she was going to lose her life.</p>

<p>Mary said that Brandan was still unable to control video game addiction after becoming a father. Moreover, Mary was scared he would get angry at her if she approached him while he was playing. Brandan shouts at her and says terrible things, such as a “scammer” who is happy only as long as she has money. Brandan also called Mary a “bit**.” He claimed he didn’t mean what he said and only wanted Mary to get upset at him and fight back. Kalani Faagata accused Brandan of being narcissistic for calling her names to get a reaction.</p>

Mary said they had reopened their business and were making money from it. Brandan didn’t expect to ask Angela for money again. However, Andrei Castravet and Armando reminded Brandan that he eventually will because raising a baby is expensive.</p>

They asked Shekinah to share an example of an aspect of her relationship where she needed to take responsibility. Shekinah couldn’t answer Daniele’s question.

He then invited Memori to visit the Dominican Republic and that he would show her around. Yohan had told Memori that he was single and going through a divorce and that Daniele was trying to take “everything” from him.
