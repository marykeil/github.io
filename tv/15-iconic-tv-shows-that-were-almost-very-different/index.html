  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Jesse Pinkman almost died in season 1 of
Breaking Bad
, but the character&rsquo;s value led to his survival and helped the success of the show.
Zooey Deschanel almost didn&rsquo;t read the script for
New Girl
due to the show&rsquo;s original title, which would have drastically changed the series.
Stranger Things
was almost set in New York, but the decision to change the setting to Hawkins, Indiana transformed the show&rsquo;s atmosphere and storylines.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>TV shows can change a lot before they finally hit the small screen, and these iconic series were almost very different from their final incarnations.</p>
<p>Some of the most iconic TV shows were almost very different from their final incarnations. The process of creating a television series is a lengthy one, and everything from casting to writing choices can shape what the end product becomes. In some cases, creators go into writing and filming with one vision for the story and come out with another. In fact, this has happened with some of the best TV shows of all time.
Given the strong associations viewers make between TV shows and their characters, casts, and overarching stories, it&rsquo;s difficult to envision most hits turning out any other way. Learning about original plans for well-known series can be a jarring experience. That&rsquo;s especially true when those plans don&rsquo;t involve some of the biggest characters and moments present in the finished episodes.</p>
<p>15  Breaking Bad (2008-2013)
Jesse Pinkman Almost Died Early On</p>
<p>Breaking Bad</p>
<p>Release Date   January 20, 2008    Cast   Dean Norris , Bob Odenkirk , Aaron Paul , RJ Mitte , Anna Gunn , Giancarlo Esposito , Betsy Brandt , Bryan Cranston , Jonathan Banks    Genres   Crime , Drama , Thriller    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Breaking Bad is known for its iconic duo, but Walter White and Jesse Pinkman weren&rsquo;t originally supposed to be partners for the entire show. In fact, Jesse Pinkman was going to die in season 1, but Vince Gilligan decided not to go through with this plan after realizing the value the character brought to the table (via New York Magazine). Given how popular Aaron Paul&rsquo;s character and Breaking Bad became, not killing Jesse worked in the series&rsquo; favor. It&rsquo;s hard to envision what Walt&rsquo;s journey would have looked like without him — and that&rsquo;s not to mention that Hank Schrader nearly died in Breaking Bad season 1 as well.</p>
<p>14  New Girl (2011-2018)
Zooey Deschanel Almost Didn&rsquo;t Read The Script</p>
<p>New Girl</p>
<p>Release Date   September 20, 2011    Cast   Zooey Deschanel , Max Greenfield , Hannah Simone , Damon Wayans Jr. , Lamorne Morris , Jake Johnson    Genres   Comedy    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   7</p>
<p>New Girl is one of the most iconic sitcoms to come out in the 2010s, and most immediately associate the series with its lead, Zooey Deschanel. Deschanel plays the quirky and entertaining Jess Day, and it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine the show without her presence. However, New Girl&rsquo;s lead almost didn&rsquo;t pick up the script to audition. New Girl&rsquo;s original title, Chicks &amp; Dicks, alluded to a much different kind of series — one that didn&rsquo;t initially catch Deschanel&rsquo;s eye (via Glamour). If New Girl had kept its first title and failed to cast Deschanel, the show would undoubtedly hold a much different place in pop culture.</p>
<p>13  Stranger Things (2016-Present)
The Hit Netflix Show Was Almost Set In New York</p>
<p>Stranger Things</p>
<p>Release Date   July 15, 2016    Cast   Finn Wolfhard , joe keery , Jamie Campbell Bower , Brett Gelman , Caleb McLaughlin , Maya Hawke , David Harbour , Matthew Modine , Priah Ferguson , Gaten Matarazzo , Winona Ryder , Charlie Heaton , Sadie Sink , Millie Bobby Brown , Joseph Quinn , Dacre Montgomery , Natalia Dyer , Noah Schnapp    Genres   Fantasy , Horror , Drama    Seasons   4</p>
<p>Stranger Things is among Netflix&rsquo;s biggest original series, and its setting contributes to its enduring popularity. The supernatural show takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the 1980s, and its atmospheric backdrop helps everything else fall into place. Oddly enough, Stranger Things almost took place in New York; its original title was even Montauk, alluding to the Long Island village it would have been set in. While Montauk isn&rsquo;t exactly Manhattan, the coastal town would have given off much different vibes than Hawkins&rsquo; rural, Midwestern location. The original Stranger Things plan also focused more on the adults, killed off Eleven, and could have been an anthology.</p>
<p>12  One Tree Hill (2003-2012)
The Teen Drama Could Have Been A Movie</p>
<p>One Tree Hill</p>
<p>Release Date   September 23, 2003    Cast   Chad Michael Murray , James Lafferty , Hilarie Burton , Paul Johansson , Sophia Bush , Barry Corbin , Craig Sheffer , Bethany Joy Lenz , Moira Kelly    Genres   Drama , Romance , Sports    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   9</p>
<p>One Tree Hill ran for nine seasons, but the popular teen drama was almost very different. According to Building a Winning Team: The Making of One Tree Hill (via YouTube), Mark Schwahn initially conceptualized One Tree Hill as a movie. The feature film would have been titled Ravens, an allusion to the basketball team Lucas and Nathan Scott play for. The WB liked the concept, but they insisted it would work better as a TV show. Fortunately, this is the format the teen drama eventually took. A movie would have condensed the characters&rsquo; storylines, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have become so iconic.</p>
<p>11  Full House (1987-1995)
The Sitcom&rsquo;s Original Premise Was Much Different</p>
<p>Full House (US)</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 1987    Cast   Bob Saget , John Stamos , Dave Coulier , Candace Cameron Bure , Jodie Sweetin , Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen , Lori Loughlin , Andrea Barber , Scott Weinger    Genres   Comedy , Family    Seasons   8</p>
<p>Full House is a classic sitcom revolving around a family coming together to raise three girls after their mother dies. However, this wasn&rsquo;t the show&rsquo;s original premise. The original Full House was called House of Comics, and it centered on three comedians who lived together. The popularity of other family-oriented sitcoms gave rise to the show Full House actually became. The sitcom kept Joey as a comedian to honor its initial premise. Still, Full House would have looked much different if its storylines focused primarily on three adults rather than a house brought to life by the Tanner children.</p>
<p>10  How I Met Your Mother (2005-2014)
Ted Could Have Ended Up With The Mother</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother</p>
<p>Release Date   September 19, 2005    Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   9</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother presents itself as the story of how Ted Mosby met his children&rsquo;s mother, but the show&rsquo;s ending — one of the most-hated TV finales of all time — flips this premise on its head. It reveals that the mother is dead, and the entire point of Ted&rsquo;s narrative is to ask his kids&rsquo; permission to date their Aunt Robin. It&rsquo;s an odd choice, and it&rsquo;s one that almost played out differently. Per Business Insider, the show&rsquo;s creators were torn about the conclusion. An alternate HIMYM finale almost saw Ted and Tracy staying together. This would have completely changed how the story is viewed in hindsight.</p>
<p>9  Lost (2004-2010)
Jack&rsquo;s Role In Lost Wasn&rsquo;t All That Prominent</p>
<p>Lost</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 2004    Cast   Evangeline Lilly , Naveen Andrews , Henry Ian Cusick , Daniel Dae Kim , Harold Perrineau , Dominic Monaghan , Emilie de Ravin , Jorge Garcia , Josh Holloway , Michael Emerson , Terry O&rsquo;Quinn , Matthew Fox , Ken Leung , Elizabeth Mitchell , Yunjin Kim    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi , Supernatural    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6</p>
<p>Although ABC&rsquo;s Lost had a huge ensemble cast, Jack Shepherd was arguably the show&rsquo;s main character. He became a leader on The Island, and many of the other plane crash survivors wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten by without him. Lost originally planned to kill Jack in the pilot episode, a development that would have completely upended everything that came after. Without Jack, another leader would need to arise — or the other characters would have had a much more difficult journey. Either way, there&rsquo;s no denying that Lost wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without Jack. Thankfully, the original plan never came to fruition.</p>
<p>8  Cheers (1982-1993)
Frasier Wasn&rsquo;t Supposed To Be A Regular Presence</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Release Date   September 30, 1982    Cast   Ted Danson , Shelley Long , Nicholas Colasanto , Rhea Perlman , George Wendt , John Ratzenberger , Kelsey Grammer , Woody Harrelson , Kirstie Alley , Bebe Neuwirth    Genres   Sitcom    Rating   TV-PG    Seasons   11</p>
<p>Another character who originally had a smaller role, Frasier wasn&rsquo;t meant to become a regular presence in the 1980s sitcom Cheers. Kelsey Grammer&rsquo;s character was also supposed to appear for a few episodes, but his performance left a mark on the show&rsquo;s creators. Not only did they keep him around for longer, but Frasier went on to have his own spinoff series. Although the show without Frasier isn&rsquo;t totally unimaginable, Cheers would have been somewhat different without his presence — and it wouldn&rsquo;t have spawned its most popular spinoff.</p>
<p>7  Supernatural (2005-2020)
A Shorter Run Would Have Been Much Different</p>
<p>Supernatural</p>
<p>Release Date   September 13, 2005    Cast   Jensen Ackles , Misha Collins , Jim Beaver , Jared Padalecki , Katie Cassidy , Lauren Cohan , Mark A. Sheppard , Mark Pellegrino , Alexander Calvert    Genres   Action , Adventure , Mystery    Seasons   15</p>
<p>Supernatural aired on The CW for a whopping 15 seasons, and there&rsquo;s even speculation about the Winchesters returning for Supernatural season 16. This lengthy run allowed the series to explore many of its supporting characters in further depth, and it took the Winchesters&rsquo; journey to some very unexpected places. However, Supernatural was originally meant to be just five seasons. If the show had ended with the season 5 finale, &ldquo;Swan Song,&rdquo; Castiel and Crowley wouldn&rsquo;t have become such prominent characters. Additionally, some of the most iconic episodes, scenes, and villains wouldn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>How Supernatural&rsquo;s Original Five-Season Plan Ended
Supernatural was originally supposed to run for a maximum of five years but is now readying season 15. How did that original plan come to an end?</p>
<p>6  The Big Bang Theory (2007-2019)
The Original Title Suggested A Smaller Scope</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory&rsquo;s original title was Lenny, Kenny, and Penny, and it hinted at a much different approach to the hangout comedy. With Kenny representing Sheldon Cooper in the show&rsquo;s trio, Lenny, Kenny, and Penny would have focused primarily on the three main characters rather than expanding to have an ensemble cast. Given how much better The Big Bang Theory got after abandoning its initial premise, it&rsquo;s disheartening to realize the series almost didn&rsquo;t prioritize characters like Amy, Raj, or Howard. Thankfully, the title change left the door open to switch up the sitcom&rsquo;s premise later as well.</p>
<p>5  Parks And Recreation (2009-2015)
The Show Was Intended As A Spinoff Of The Office</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation</p>
<p>Release Date   April 9, 2009    Cast   Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&rsquo;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe    Genres   Sitcom , Comedy , Mockumentary    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation very clearly drew inspiration from The Office, but as it continued, it set itself apart from the earlier workplace sitcom. This would have been more difficult to do if Parks and Rec had become an Office spinoff — the initial plan when the series was in development. If Pawnee&rsquo;s Parks Department inhabited the same world as Dunder Mifflin, Parks and Rec would have played out very differently. There might have been crossovers and cameos within the two series, and Parks and Rec might never have escaped The Office&rsquo;s shadow.</p>
<p>4  Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)
Several Absences Would Have Made A Very Different Show</p>
<p>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</p>
<p>Release Date   March 10, 1997    Cast   Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters    Genres   Action , Comedy , Drama , Horror , Supernatural    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a show that&rsquo;s essential to understanding the 1990s, and its most recognizable characters are still associated with their time on the series. It&rsquo;s hard to picture Buffy without its central cast, but several members almost didn&rsquo;t make it into the final product. For one, Sarah Michelle Geller nearly didn&rsquo;t play Buffy Summers, as a few other actors were considered for Buffy the Vampire Slayer&rsquo;s lead role. Additionally, Willow&rsquo;s actor changed from the original Buffy pilot, with Alyson Hannigan taking over from Riff Regan later on. Fans will be grateful things worked out the way they did, as both actors are perfect in their roles.</p>
<p>3  Game Of Thrones (2011-2019)
It&rsquo;s Hard To Imagine The HBO Show Without Emilia Clarke</p>
<p>Game Of Thrones</p>
<p>Release Date   April 11, 2011    Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Genres   Drama , Action , Adventure    Seasons   8</p>
<p>Game of Thrones changed pop culture and fantasy television forever, and its huge ensemble cast is partially responsible for its success. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the show without one of its most important presences: Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke played the character to perfection over Game of Thrones&rsquo; eight seasons, but she almost wasn&rsquo;t the Mother of Dragons in the HBO show. In Game of Thrones&rsquo; unaired pilot, Tamzin Merchant played Daenerys instead. Had Merchant been cast, Game of Thrones would have turned out quite differently — and another version of Dany would have dominated the cultural conversation.</p>
<p>2  Succession (2018-2023)
Logan Roy Could Have Died In Season 1</p>
<p>Succession</p>
<p>Release Date   June 3, 2018    Cast   Hiam Abbass , Alan Ruck , Sarah Snook , Kieran Culkin , Natalie Gold , Nicholas Braun , J. Smith-Cameron , Matthew Macfadyen , Peter Friedman , Brian Cox , Arian Moayed , Jeremy Strong , Rob Yang , Dagmara Dominczyk    Genres   Drama , Comedy    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Logan Roy&rsquo;s death took the world by storm in Succession season 4, but the series would have been much different if he&rsquo;d perished earlier. Creator Jesse Armstrong actually considered killing Logan at the end of Succession season 1 &ndash; and at one point, even at the end of the first episode (via Deadline). Doing so would have changed everything about the HBO series, putting the Roy children in a totally different fight for Waystar Royco. Ultimately, keeping Logan was the right call, as his presence complicated the family drama and showed exactly why the Roy kids were so messed up.</p>
<p>1  The Walking Dead (2010-2020)
Carol Nearly Perished In Season 3</p>
<p>The Walking Dead</p>
<p>Release Date   October 31, 2010    Cast   Steven Yeun , Andrew Lincoln , Chandler Riggs , Laurie Holden , Jeffrey DeMunn , Sarah Wayne Callies , Melissa McBride , Norman Reedus , Jon Bernthal , Iron E. Singleton    Genres   Horror , Thriller , Drama    Seasons   11</p>
<p>Carol became a fan-favorite from The Walking Dead, and Melissa McBride&rsquo;s character helped shape the series into what it is today. However, she almost didn&rsquo;t make it past the third season. Speaking with Looper, creator Scott Gimple admitted that there were plans to kill Carol in The Walking Dead season 3. Thankfully, these didn&rsquo;t come to be, allowing Carol to blossom into one of the show&rsquo;s best survivors (and later pop up in spinoffs like The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon). The original series and the franchise would look different without Carol, even with all the other characters to focus on.</p>
