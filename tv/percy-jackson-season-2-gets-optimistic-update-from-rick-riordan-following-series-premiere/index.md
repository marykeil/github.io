## Literature Review
Percy Jackson and the Olympians creator, Rick Riordan, offers an optimistic update about the chances for season 2 after the series premiere.




Percy Jackson and the Olympians creator Rick Riordan has high hopes that the show will earn its season 2. The show is an adaptation of Riordan&#39;s original Percy Jackson book, The Lightning Thief. As Percy discovers his identity as the half-blood son of Poseidon, he and his friends are forced to take a journey to retrieve Zeus&#39; stolen weapon. It premiered on Disney&#43; on December 19 with its frst two episodes.




While season 1 is still ongoing, the cast and crew are hopeful that Percy Jackson season 2 will earn a renewal. While speaking on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Riordan confirmed that they have not yet received any confirmation that season 2 will come. He has already started working on it, though, but he recommends that viewers spread the word about the series. Check out the quote below, via CBR:


&#34;We are doing what we can to prepare [for] the eventuality that we get the green light. We don&#39;t know. It is not official. You know, we&#39;re getting reactions like we&#39;ve had tonight, amazing reactions everywhere... so, if I was the Oracle, I would say the Auguries are good. But, we had started writing what those episodes would look like, sort of doing a series format, talking about the first few episodes, and that&#39;s about as much as we can do right now until we get the go-ahead. So, the best way to ensure that [the show] goes forward, [is to] tell your friends to tune in to Disney&#43; and watch.&#34;






 


 Will Percy Jackson Season 2 Happen? 
          

There is potential for the show to enjoy a long and prosperous future. Riordan has written numerous Percy Jackson books, and each can prove to be an entire season. There are also multiple spinoff books, each revolving around different mythologies, such as Roman and Norse. With so many ideas to move forward with, there are only a few issues that could keep Disney from green lighting season 2.

One issue is budgetary constraints. All of the Percy Jackson monsters require a high budget to ensure that the CGI can look realistic. The show has a bigger budget than the original Percy Jackson movie, which worked with just $95 million. With a higher budget than many other shows could dream of, the show needs to have a massive viewership to make it a success for Disney.




So far, Percy Jackson has become a success for Disney, having brought in 13.3 million viewers in just six days, but there is no way to know if that is enough to convince Disney to give the show another chance. The studio will need to continue to monitor the viewership numbers to see if the ratings rise or fall as the season progresses. That&#39;s why Riordan is urging viewers to spread the word in the hopes that Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2 will happen.
