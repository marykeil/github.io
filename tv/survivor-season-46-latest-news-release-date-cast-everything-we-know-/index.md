## Literature Review
CBS dropped a teaser for Survivor season 46 during the finale of season 45. An overview of what we know so far about the upcoming season.




As with past seasons of Survivor, the teaser for the upcoming season aired during the finale of the most recent season. On that note, on Wednesday, December 20, viewers of the long-running hit reality series got their first peak of Survivor season 46. The video clip was one minute and 47 seconds long and opens with Jeff Probst declaring a new tribe over footage of the newest castaways both on the island and at their homes.




In Survivor season 46, the show returns to its permanent location, Mamanuca Island, Fiji. For its first 16 years on air, the show traveled all over the world, filming in different exotic locations for every Survivor season. However, ever since Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X, which is season 33, the show has been filming in the South Pacific locale. When talking about the location, Jeff praised Fiji&#39;s clear water, beautiful beaches, and friendly government.

 Survivor Season 46 Latest News 
          

Survivor 45 ended with Dee Valladeres being named the winner of the $1 million grand prize and the title of sole survivor. She had been in a Survivor showmance with Austin Li Coon, who came in second place in a game that took over a total of 26 days. Seasons used to span a total of 39 days, except for the longest season ever, Survivor: The Australian Outback, which was filmed over a whopping 42 days.




Nonetheless, since Survivor season 46 was filmed over the course of 26 days, this new, faster pace appears to be here to stay. Regardless of the number of days spent filming, the show will air the usual 13 total episodes. However, the production time frame is much shorter for the castaways.



 Is Survivor Season 46 Confirmed? 
          

Survivor 46 is confirmed, with ABC airing a teaser during the Season 45 finale, though it&#39;s unclear when the show will air another All-Star season. The last All-Star season was Season 40, which welcomed back 20 winners in 2020. Since Survivor 46 will definitely not be featuring an All-Stars cast, that means it will be at least another year for a comeback cycle. There has been some online speculation that the show is planning for Survivor 50 to be the next All-Stars season, but there is no confirmation.
