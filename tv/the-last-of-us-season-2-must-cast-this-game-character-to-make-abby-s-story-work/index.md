# The Last Of Us Season 2 Must Cast This Game Character To Make Abby s Story Work


## SUMMARY 



  The Last of Us season 2 will feature new major characters, but an unconfirmed character, Lev, is needed to enhance Abby&#39;s story in the HBO adaptation.   Lev first appears in The Last of Us Part II after he and his sister free Abby, thus making him a crucial part of Abby&#39;s story moving forward.   Including Lev in Abby&#39;s story would add emotional weight, explore an important representation of gender identity, and showcase Abby&#39;s compassion and growth after her initial rage-led actions.

Summary

  The Last of Us season 2 will feature new major characters, but an unconfirmed character, Lev, is needed to enhance Abby&#39;s story in the HBO adaptation.   Lev first appears in The Last of Us Part II after he and his sister free Abby, thus making him a crucial part of Abby&#39;s story moving forward.   Including Lev in Abby&#39;s story would add emotional weight, explore an important representation of gender identity, and showcase Abby&#39;s compassion and growth after her initial rage-led actions.  







Many new major characters&#39; casting has been confirmed for The Last of Us season 2, but one missing character needs to be included to make Abby&#39;s story work in the HBO adaptation. The Last of Us season 2 cast includes the return of major characters like Bella Ramsey as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel, as well as the much-anticipated live-action renditions of Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), Dina (Isabela Merced), and Jesse (Young Mazino). While this is a promising start, there are still some big characters yet to be announced.

The Last of Us season 2 will follow most of The Last of Us Part II, yet show creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann shared they aren&#39;t strictly bound by the game&#39;s plot points. This could allow for The Last of Us season 2 to use non-linear storytelling to adjust the game&#39;s less TV-friendly structure. One of the most anticipated parts of the adaptation is Abby&#39;s character, since she&#39;s so controversial in the game. As supporting characters, like Tess, boosted Joel and Ellie&#39;s season 1 story, Abby needs one game character in the show to improve her arc.




                  Why The Last Of Us Season 2 Will Be So Divisive (You&#39;re Not Ready For It)   Considering what happens in the second video game, The Last of Us season 2 is setting up to be extremely divisive, but will it hurt the HBO series?   


 The Last Of Us Season 2 Needs To Include Lev In Abby’s Story 
          

Lev first appears in The Last of Us Part II after freeing Abby from the Seraphites. Even though Lev, Abby, and Lev&#39;s sister, Yara, part after this, Yara&#39;s deteriorating condition due to her arm injury poses a problem for Lev to handle. Abby returns and takes them to Mel for treatment. While Abby is a WLF member and Lev and Yara are from an enemy group, the Seraphites, her helping them is a pinnacle moment in Abby&#39;s story, and adds to why Lev is one of The Last of Us Part II characters most anticipated for season 2.




From here, Lev is connected to many of Abby&#39;s main story moments, such as her brawl with Ellie at the theater and her trip to the Seraphite island. Abby&#39;s brute-force and Lev&#39;s less hands-on tactics help them when combined. For example, Lev shoots Tommy and Dina to save Abby and Abby gives Lev a gas mask to get them through their journey to the hospital. Lev&#39;s difficult family situation also adds more emotional weight to the story overall and would give The Last of Us season 2 even greater room to explore the important representation of Lev&#39;s gender identity.



 Abby’s Antagonism Would Be Too One-Sided Without Showing Her Caring Side 
         

Abby&#39;s perspective is needed in The Last of Us season 2 to elaborate beyond her initial rage-led actions. Her relationships, seen in flashbacks with her dad and scenes with Owen, add more layers that highlight her compassion and growth. By accepting her father&#39;s death and acknowledging her guilt for the ruthlessness she adopted as a WLF member, Abby can move on from a lot of her pain. Her fractured relationship with Owen also helps her grasp how jaded she is at times. This highlights the dual revenge and retribution themes her and Ellie are expected to demonstrate in season 2.




This turn predominantly happens after encountering Lev. Lev and Yara freeing Abby proves not all Seraphites are amoral, as the WLF would have Abby believe. It also shines a light on Abby&#39;s own unjust actions, like when she&#39;s ashamed about almost killing a pregnant Dina in front of Lev. Moreover, after Yara&#39;s death, Abby works even harder to protect and care for Lev, seen at the end when Ellie threatens him. Thus, to show Abby as more than a rage-fueled antagonist and contrast thematically with Ellie&#39;s revenge struggle, The Last of Us season 2 needs to cast Lev.



The Last of Us season 2 has been confirmed to start filming on February 12, 2024.
