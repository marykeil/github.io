## Literature Review
Actors have to start somewhere before they go on to major careers in Hollywood, and several shows are common stepping stones for up-and-coming actors.




Hollywood is full of people trying to get their big break into the industry, and for many future stars, there are a few special shows that have made that happen repeatedly. Hollywood is the hub of entertainment for Western culture, and while studios exist in Atlanta, Georgia, Toronto, Canada, and London, England, Hollywood is still the word that is synonymous with stardom. But breaking into the industry can be challenging until someone lands a great gateway role that leads to bigger castings.
A breakout role can be playing the lead in a major motion picture, or appearing in a viral new series, but when playing a role in a new project, it&#39;s a total gamble on how successful it will be. Despite this, there are a few shows which have become famous for making people famous. These shows have produced some of the biggest names in Hollywood today, and many continue to introduce new talent to the world.

Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Andy Samberg, And Many More


 







Saturday Night Live is a sketch comedy show that has been running since 1975. Initially created by Lorne Michaels, who continues to have considerable involvement with the show, SNL has been responsible for fostering some of the biggest and best talent in comedy over the last 50 years. Whether these comedy actors began working in the writers&#39; room or were lucky enough to be a part of the cast, SNL is well known for launching comedy careers to another level.

While The Mickey Mouse Club initially came out in 1955, the series went through a few different versions. One iteration which ran from 1989 to 1994 was retitled The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, and it starred some young recurring cast members who would go on to have major success in music and acting. Justin Timberlake and other members of NSYNC, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera would all go on to have significant music careers, and Ryan Gosling became incredibly successful, appearing in films like The Notebook.

 8  Band Of Brothers 
Tom Hardy, Michael Fassbender, And James McAvoy
        

Band of Brothers was a miniseries developed for HBO and released in 2001. Despite the brief run of just 10 episodes, the show was responsible for highlighting some incredible young talent who would go on to have major success. Of course, the series stars Tom Hanks, but actors Tom Hardy, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy were largely unknown before appearing on the show.





 7  Barney &amp; Friends 
Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, And Debby Ryan
        

In the heart of Texas, Barney &amp; Friends was another show that gave young children a start in their acting careers. While the show has had more than 100 children appear, it has had a decent few go on to gain major success. The biggest name of the bunch is Selena Gomez, who earned great success with her acting and singing, along with Demi Lovato and Debby Ryan. All three went on to careers with Disney and beyond, while a few other children also found some success after the show.





 6  Stranger Things 
Joe Keery, Joseph Quinn, Maya Hawke, Finn Wolfhard, And Millie Bobby Brown


 







The virality and popularity of Stranger Things would have been hard to predict prior to the show airing, but considering the talent of the regular cast, it&#39;s easy to see how it happened. Several actors from the series have continued to develop their relationship with Netflix, like Millie Bobby Brown, who has starred in other Netflix projects like Enola Holmes, while other breakout stars have gone on to have more and more success with other projects.





 5  Freaks And Geeks 
James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, And Martin Starr
        

Freaks and Geeks was a short-lived show executive-produced by Judd Apatow. Due to erratic scheduling, the series struggled to maintain its audience when it first aired and was quickly canceled partway through season 1. However, in the years since, it gained a cult following, and several of the stars from the teen coming-of-age series have gone on to major success. James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jason Segel, and Martin Starr got their start on the show and went on to bigger and better projects.

Aside from him, actors Brad Pitt, Matthew Perry, and Hilary Swank all also appeared in multiple episodes which highlighted their talents and future potential.

 2  Home And Away 
Isla Fisher, Dannii Minogue, Chris Hemsworth, Heath Ledger, And Naomi Watts


 







Home and Away is another Australian soap opera that has had equal success in producing major celebrities over the years. Chris Hemsworth had a much more prominent role in this series than his appearances on Neighbours. Likewise, Dannii Minogue was able to carve out a name for herself away from the shadow cast by her sister Kylie on Neighbours. Other notable stars to come from the show are Isla Fisher, Heath Ledger, and Naomi Watts who all went on to major success in Hollywood.





 1  ER 
Chris Pine, George Clooney, Nick Offerman, Zac Efron

Likewise, Zac Efron, Chris Pine, and Nick Offerman all experienced a leap forward in their careers after appearing on ER.
