## Literature Review

Marvel Studios&#39; most recent Disney&#43; series may have come to an end, but there are plenty of upcoming MCU TV shows in development.




Loki season 2 was the most recent Marvel Cinematic Universe TV release, and there are still many reasons to be excited about the MCU&#39;s small-screen future, as several new TV shows are currently in development. After the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the inception of Disney&#43;, Marvel Studios began to expand the MCU timeline even further by developing long-form shows for the new streaming platform. Marvel Studios&#39; Disney&#43; shows gave supporting and secondary characters from previous MCU projects their time in the spotlight, and have also been used to introduce smaller-scale heroes to the MCU, such as She-Hulk, Daredevil, Ms. Marvel, and Moon Knight.
While not all of Marvel Studios&#39; Disney&#43; series&#39; have garnered a positive response, projects such as WandaVision, Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, Hawkeye, and Loki quickly became some of the most popular installments in the entire MCU. Bob Iger may have promised that Disney would be pulling back on Marvel releases, and a change of strategy will reportedly see TV shows given more time in the planning stage, but there are still a number of MCU TV shows already confirmed.

What Is The Next Marvel TV Show?









 








 11  X-Men &#39;97 
Premiering Early 2024

Adventure
Action
Superhero



  Cast    Jennifer Hale , Chris Potter , Alison Sealy-Smith , Lenore Zann , Cal Dodd , Catherine Disher , Adrian Hough , Ray Chase , Chris Britton , George Buza     Seasons    1     Streaming Service(s)    Disney&#43;    


Developed by Marvel Studios Animation - similarly to What If...? - X-Men &#39;97 will premiere in early 2024 as a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series, which released on Fox Kids Network between 1992 and 1997. The plot of the series will continue where The Animated Series ended, and will reintroduce some of the most popular X-Men characters, such as Wolverine (Cal Dodd), Cyclops (Ray Chase), Rogue (Lenore Zann), and Gambit (A. J. LoCascio). X-Men &#39;97 season 1 is set to consist of ten episodes, and a second season is already in development, though an exact release date has yet to be confirmed for either.





 10  Eyes Of Wakanda 
Arriving 2024
        

A surprise addition to the MCU slate in December 2023, Eyes of Wakanda is an animated spinoff of the Black Panther movies, which will expand the lore of Wakanda. The official synopsis revealed by Marvel Studios reveals “Throughout Wakandan history, brave warriors have been tasked to travel the world retrieving dangerous vibranium artifacts. This is their story.”
That suggests the series could be a prequel, focusing on Wakandan &#34;outreach&#34; prior to T&#39;Challa&#39;s reign as king, with the Dora Milaje and previous Black Panthers operating to retrieve lost vibranium. Nothing is yet confirmed on the story, nor any cast members, but it&#39;s an intriguing way to expand the rich potential of Wakandan lore.

Not much is yet known about the storyline for Darkhold Diaries, but several new witches will be introduced to the MCU.

Although no release date has yet been set, Ironheart has completed filming and is in post-production, so is expected to release at some point in 2024 as part of the MCU&#39;s Phase 5.
Riri Williams will become the superhero Ironheart in the self-titled series, and is expected to battle Anthony Ramos&#39; Parker Robbins, a.k.a. the Hood, in a feud between technology and magic. Ironheart will also star Alden Ehrenreich, Lyric Ross, Manny Montana, and drag queen Shea Couleé.
Riri Williams, a.k.a. Ironheart, is expected to be Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man&#39;s, legacy hero in the MCU.

  Cast    Charlie Cox , Vincent D&#39;Onofrio     Seasons    1     Streaming Service(s)    Disney&#43;    


Daredevil: Born Again will bring Charlie Cox and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio back together after they debuted as Matt Murdock&#39;s Daredevil and Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin, respectively, in Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil series on Netflix. Cameo appearances in Spider-Man: No Way Home, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Hawkeye, and Echo have geared them up to come back in full force.
Daredevil: Born Again has recently been reworked following a series of problems, so a release date is yet to be set, but Cox and D&#39;Onofrio will be joined by Jon Bernthal - returning as Frank Castle, a.k.a. the Punisher, Margarita Levieva, Sandrine Holt, Michael Gandolfini, and Nikki M. James, among several other MCU newcomers.





 6  Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man 
Premiering 2024


 







Produced by Marvel Studios Animation, Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man: (originally titled Spider-Man: Freshman Year) and its confirmed second season will explore an alternate version of Peter Parker in the MCU&#39;s multiverse. The animated series will explore Peter Parker&#39;s MCU origin story as Spider-Man from a different angle, seemingly retelling Spider-Man: Homecoming.
Intriguingly, it will see the return of Tom Holland&#39;s live-action Spider-Man, with What If...?&#39;s Hudson Thames instead returning to voice this version of Peter Parker, whose mentor is Norman Osborn instead of Tony Stark. Charlie Cox is also expected to voice Matt Murdock&#39;s Daredevil in the series, which will also introduce several iconic Spider-Man villains to the MCU, such as Rhino, Doctor Octopus, and Tarantula.





 5  Marvel Zombies 
Premiering 2024


 







Marvel Zombies is an MCU spinoff from Marvel Studios&#39; What If...? season 1, episode 5, &#34;What If... Zombies?!&#34; The series is expected to release in 2024, and will be primarily based on the Marvel Zombies storylines in Marvel Comics, while several actors from the MCU are thought to be reprising their roles as their characters&#39; voices - much like they did for What If...?.
Marvel Zombies is expected to feature a new generation of heroes, including the likes of Shang-Chi, Yelena Belova, and Kate Bishop&#39;s Hawkeye. Simu Liu is confirmed to return, along with Iman Vellani&#39;s Kamala Khan, who is said to be one of the main characters.
Marvel Zombies is a Marvel Comics series that began in 2005 and is still running today, currently spanning over 20 different comic titles. 






 4  Vision Quest 
Release Date TBC
        

As well as Agatha: Darkhold Diaries, Vision Quest was also confirmed as a WandaVision spinoff, expected to mark the return of Paul Bettany as the new White Vision who debuted during the Phase 4 series. White Vision is the rebuilt version of the original Vision&#39;s body, though his memories have been toyed with by SWORD. After WandaVision&#39;s Vision appeared to restore White Vision&#39;s memories, he vanished, and hasn&#39;t yet been seen in any subsequent MCU project.
Not much is known about Vision Quest, other than Jac Schaeffer is the showrunner following her creation of WandaVision. The series is expected to debut in 2024-25, though this has yet to be confirmed.





 3  Wonder Man 
Currently Filming
        

Following the successful release of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, director Destin Daniel Cretton signed a deal with Marvel Studios to work on further projects in the MCU. This includes Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, but Cretton also set to work developing a Wonder Man series, which will star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as the titular Simon Williams.
Wonder Man will also mark the return of Ben Kingsley&#39;s Trevor Slattery from Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi, while MCU newcomers Demetrius Grosse, Ed Harris, and Lauren Glazier have also been cast. The series was filming prior to 2023&#39;s Hollywood strikes, and is expected to resume shortly.





 2  Untitled Wakanda Series 
In Development
        

Ryan Coogler has been applauded as the visionary director behind the MCU&#39;s Black Panther franchise, and he is set to expand on the world of Wakanda even further with a dedicated Wakanda series, and a slew of rumored series set in Wakanda to follow. Danai Gurira has confirmed her involvement in the series as Okoye, the former General of the Dora Milaje and current Midnight Angel.
Coogler&#39;s Wakanda series has been speculated to be an origin story for Okoye, though there is also talk that a separate Okoye-centered series is in development, so it remains to be seen exactly how Coogler will expand on his Black Panther franchise.
Okoye became a Midnight Angel, alongside Michaela Coel&#39;s Aneka, after being stripped of her duty with the Dora Milaje during 2022&#39;s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. 






 1  Untitled Nova Series 
Reportedly In Development
        

A series focusing on the Marvel Comics hero Richard Rider, a.k.a. Nova, has been in development at Marvel Studios since March 2022, with Sabir Pirzada hired to pen the script. The MCU&#39;s Nova series has since become a victim of delays and behind the scenes issues at Marvel Studios, so not much is known about the upcoming series - which is also speculated to be a Special Presentation.
Although details are scarce, the series is expected to explore Thanos&#39; unseen attack on Xandar in Avengers: Infinity War, and will expand on the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in lieu of any confirmed future Guardians of the Galaxy stories.
