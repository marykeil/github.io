During the Holiday Sing-A-Long, Ne-Yo sang a delightful version of &ldquo;What Christmas Means to Me&rdquo; by Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p>On The Masked Singer season 10 finale night, Ne-Yo blew the roof off of the studio with his first performance of &ldquo;Rhythm Nation&rdquo; by Janet Jackson. His singing and dancing once again proved that he was a seasoned performer. Ne-Yo and John Schneider&rsquo;s Donut made it to the final round, during which Ne-Yo sang a beautiful version of &ldquo;Take A Bow&rdquo; by Rihanna, a song which he co-wrote.</p>
<p>Ne-Yo was declared the winner of the The Masked Singer season 10. Before he was unmasked, the panelists offered their final guesses for his identity. They included Usher (Ken), and Billy Porter (Jenny). However, Robin and Nicole correctly guessed that Cow was Ne-Yo. After his unmasking, he treated everyone to a spirited performance of his hit song, &ldquo;Miss Independent.&rdquo; Ne-Yo is one of the most effortless performers to ever grace the Masked Singer stage, and is perhaps the greatest winner in the history of the show. Ne-Yo&rsquo;s performances were like nothing the show had ever seen before, and he will always be remembered for what he achieved on the Masked Singer stage.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 10 unmasked some beloved celebrities. This milestone season was one of the best ever. It raised the bar for future competitors, as these contestants brought their extraordinary vocals, incredible dancing, charismatic stage presences, and emotional stories to the Masked Singer stage. It proved why The Masked Singer is the best reality singing competition show on television.</p>
