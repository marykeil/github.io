Subscribers attest to Hulu trumping the competition when it comes to the quality of its curated movie library, and the 30 best Hulu movies prove it.</p>
<p>Best Comedy TV Shows On Hulu
Broad City (2014-2019)</p>
<p>Broad City</p>
<p>Release Date   January 22, 2014    Cast   Abbi Jacobson , Ilana Glazer , Hannibal Buress , Paul Downs , John Gemberling , Arturo Castro , Stephen Schneider , Chris Gethard , D&rsquo;Arcy Carden , Susie Essman , Bob Balaban    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Responsible for introducing the mainstream to the wonderful comedic duo of Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, Broad City turns traditional sitcom fare into chaos. The show follows two best friends as they live their awkward and hilarious lives as two young women in the big city. The show leans into the big personalities of the characters and the bizarre humor of Glazer and Jacobson, but is fundamentally a surprisingly charming show about friendship that still makes viewers laugh out loud.</p>

The Bear (2022-Present)</p>
<p>The Bear</p>
<p>Release Date   June 23, 2022    Cast   Jeremy Allen White , Ebon Moss-Bachrach , Ayo Edebiri , Lionel Boyce , Liza Colón-Zayas , Abby Elliott , Oliver Platt    Seasons   2</p>
<p>A Hulu original that&rsquo; proved a major critical hit for the service, The Bear is a black comedy-drama about a classically trained chef (Jeremy Allen White) who has to return to his hometown in Chicago to help run the family restaurant. White, in one of his best roles, won a SAG and a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his work, and the series cemented its status with a stellar season 2.
The often spiky atmosphere between the uninterested chefs in the restaurant and White’s driven Carmy Berzatto is a delight to watch. The Bear is a funny and inspiring antidote to the self-serious Chef’s Table-like shows that have become ubiquitous in food programming.

Letterkenny (2016-Present)</p>
<p>Letterkenny</p>
<p>Release Date   February 7, 2018    Cast   Jared Keeso    Genres   Sitcom , Comedy    Seasons   11</p>
<p>With the exception of Trailer Park Boys, Canadian sitcoms are generally sweet, wholesome, and heartwarming, with Schitt&rsquo;s Creek as a prime example. Enter: Letterkenny. Premiering on Canadian airwaves in 2016 and on Hulu in the US in 2018, Letterkenny takes place in the eponymous fictional rural Ontario town and chronicles the day-to-day happenings of its locals.
The show is irreverent and silly and full of &ldquo;dude humor&rdquo;, though unlike other shows with a similar comedy style, it never punches down. In fact, Letterkenny has been praised for its inclusion of fully-rounded First Nations characters. The main Letterkenny cast has a distinctly relatable Canadian charm, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why viewers have wanted to hang out with them for 12 seasons and counting.

New Girl (2011-2018)</p>
<p>New Girl</p>
<p>Release Date   September 20, 2011    Cast   Zooey Deschanel , Max Greenfield , Hannah Simone , Damon Wayans Jr. , Lamorne Morris , Jake Johnson    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Gentle, frequently hilarious, and available on Hulu in its entirety, New Girl is another terrific sitcom perfect for binging. The show stars Zooey Deschanel as Jessica Day, a bubbly and optimistic young woman who, following a breakup, moves in with three men. It is another show that benefits from its incredible cast with Jake Johnson, Max Greenfield, and Lamorne Morris rounding out the winning ensemble. New Girl gained a huge following over the seven years it aired, and its arrival on Hulu should help maintain its understandable popularity.

<p>It is rare for a TV spinoff to find success, but Frasier matches and even surpasses Cheers in the opinion of many fans. The show picks up with Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) moving to Seattle where he reunites with his even more uptight and cultured brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) and his gruff father (John Mahoney), who provides a stark contrast with the two petty and snobbish brothers. Frasier was an intelligent and sophisticated sitcom that still had plenty of fun and laughs with tried and tested genre tropes.

Adventure Time (2010-2018)</p>
<p>Adventure Time</p>
<p>Release Date   May 10, 2010    Cast   Tom Kenny , Hynden Walch , Jeremy Shada , John DiMaggio , Niki Yang    Seasons   10</p>
<p>Following the psychedelic adventures of self-described heroes Finn the Human and Jake the Dog in the Land of Ooo, Adventure Time is a cult hit whose popularity spans generations. The winner of eight Primetime Emmys, one Peabody, two British Academy Children&rsquo;s Awards, and nominated for so much more, Adventure Time is a crowning achievement in Western animation and storytelling.
Underneath the clever absurdity and colorful action of Adventure Time lie clues about the fantastical mysteries of Ooo, post-apocalyptic and fantasy-inspired lore, and some of the most relatable surreal characters in animation history. Consequently, Adventure Time is one of the best Hulu shows for adults and children alike.

The Great (2020-2023)</p>

<p>Release Date   May 15, 2020    Cast   Sacha Dhawan , Adam Godley , Richard Pyros , Belinda Bromilow , Elle Fanning , Gwilym Lee , Sebastian de Souza , Phoebe Fox , Charity Wakefield , Nicholas Hoult , Douglas Hodge , Bayo Gbadamosi    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Though The Great&rsquo;s historical inaccuracies are obvious from the get-go, this fun and funny period piece embraces its eccentricity in such a way that its embellishments become its greatest strength. The show tells a version of the story of Catherine the Great (Elle Fanning), a young woman who is plucked out of rural life in the 18th century to be married off to the emperor of Russia (Nicholas Hoult). Both Fanning and Hoult bring wit and charm to their historical characters while leading this entertaining and captivating look at this empowering woman.

<p>Reservation Dogs</p>
<p>Release Date   August 9, 2021    Cast   Zahn McClarnon , Bobby Lee    Seasons   2</p>
<p>A coming-of-age story that spotlights one of the most underrepresented groups in mainstream entertainment, Reservation Dogs provides welcome relief from typical teen comedies. Featuring Indigenous writers and directors, along with a cast made up of nearly all Indigenous actors, the series follows a group of four friends in rural Oklahoma as they dream of running away to California, all while dealing with the stresses of growing up.
For its hilarious and unique takes on the social realities of reservation life, Reservation Dogs won the Peabody Award for Entertainment in 2022, alongside two Independent Spirit Awards, and was named by the American Film Institute as one of the Top 10 Programs of the Year.

<p>Although Modern Family&rsquo;s documentary-style camera work was nothing new, the hit comedy nonetheless manages to be completely original thanks to its colorful characters and domestic setting. An ensemble cast of Julie Bowen, Sofia Vergara, Ed O’Neil, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Eric Stonestreet, and Ty Burrell star as branches of a family as they live their day-to-day lives. Focusing on and celebrating each family member&rsquo;s individuality allows Modern Family to revel in creating chaotic, hilarious situations, without losing sight of the warm heart that makes the show such an enjoyable viewing experience.

Schitt’s Creek (2015-2020)</p>
<p>Schitt&rsquo;s Creek</p>
<p>Release Date   January 13, 2015    Cast   Catherine O&rsquo;Hara , Dan Levy , Noah Reid , Emily Hampshire , Tim Rozon , Dustin Milligan , Eugene Levy , Jennifer Robertson , Chris Elliott , Annie Murphy    Seasons   6</p>
<p>One of the most heartwarming comedy hits of recent years, Schitt’s Creek chronicles the fall and redemption of the affluent Rose family as they&rsquo;re forced to rebuild their lives. An innovative take on the classic fish-out-of-water trope, the show&rsquo;s comedy comes from the Roses&rsquo; wealthy sensibilities bumping against the down-to-earth and provincial citizens of a small town. Schitt’s Creek swept the comedy acting awards during the 72nd Emmy ceremony, winning nine in total. As such, it&rsquo;s easily a can&rsquo;t-miss show for viewers looking for a joyous modern take on classic comedy.

Atlanta (2016-2022)</p>
<p>Atlanta</p>
<p>Release Date   September 6, 2016    Cast   Brian Tyree Henry , Donald Glover , Zazie Beetz , LaKeith Stanfield    Seasons   4</p>
<p>Created by and starring Donald Glover, Atlanta is a dark fairy-tale and comedy-drama that follows college dropout and music manager Earn (Glover) as he tries to make it big. The show is only partially interested in following that plotline, however, and much of Atlanta is told through short anthology-style stories rather than an overarching narrative.
Through this fresh, unorthodox structure, Atlanta examines themes of race, class, America, and existentialism. It’s a unique story only Glover could tell, and his efforts have earned him multiple Emmy and Golden Globe nods. It&rsquo;s inarguably one of the best TV shows on Hulu for audiences looking for something out of the ordinary.

<p>Release Date   January 9, 2011    Cast   H. Jon Benjamin , Dan Mintz , Eugene Mirman , Larry Murphy , John Roberts , Kristen Schaal    Seasons   13</p>
<p>Among the many great animated series on Hulu, Bob&rsquo;s Burgers is perhaps one of the most underrated, yet undeniably brilliant. The show follows the oddball Belcher family as they run their small and struggling burger joint while trying to keep their madcap members together. The show&rsquo;s easy sense of humor and likable wacky characters have helped it develop a passionate following, and even led to a feature film in 2022.

<p>Scandal</p>
<p>Release Date   May 4, 2012    Cast   Kerry Washington , Tony Goldwyn , Scott Foley    Seasons   7</p>
<p>As its title suggests, Scandal is a gripping deep-dive into the salaciousness that sits just below the surface in American politics. Partially based on the experiences of real-life figure Judy Smith, the show follows Kerry Washington&rsquo;s Olivia Pope and her crisis management firm as they battle complex cases and put out fires across Washington D.C.
The show is joyously sordid and revels in its thrilling premise, making it a compelling watch across its seven seasons. With an impressive critical performance across its run, Scandal is a hugely enjoyable political procedural drama.

<p>Both life-affirming and devastating, This Is Us has a well-earned reputation as the biggest tearjerker on television. Cleverly told in different time periods, This Is Us examines the struggles, tragedies, and connections between a trio of siblings, the Randalls. The talented ensemble of actors helps to make these stories all the more emotional and impactful while still being a heartwarming multigenerational tale of a family&rsquo;s journey.

<p>Also available on streaming services such as Netflix, Friday Night Lights is an inspiring, thrilling, and heartwarming sports story tailor-made for the small screen. Kyle Chandler stars as Coach Taylor, a charismatic leader charged with leading a high school football team in a small Texas town where success on the field is everything. The series follows Taylor and the players on and off the field as they seek to be the best in the sport while also realizing that there&rsquo;s more to life than football. Triumphant and enjoyable melodramatic, Friday Night Lights also helped launch the careers of future stars like Michael B. Jordan and Taylor Kitsch.

The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale (2017-Present)</p>
<p>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</p>
<p>Release Date   April 26, 2017    Cast   O-T Fagbenle , Joseph Fiennes , Alexis Bledel , Elisabeth Moss , Amanda Brugel , Bradley Whitford , Max Minghella , Ann Dowd , Samira Wiley , Madeline Brewer , Yvonne Strahovski    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Based on the novel of the same name, The Handmaid’s Tale is a post-apocalyptic original series by Hulu that&rsquo;s become one of the most popular shows on television. The show takes place after a fictional second American Civil War, which leads to a dystopia where men are the ruling class and women are strictly controlled – especially regarding bodily autonomy.
The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale not only secured 15 Primetime Emmys, but is the first Hulu original series to win a major award. While the series can be uncomfortable and upsetting, it is also thought-provoking, and the struggling humans at the center of the story make The Handsmaid&rsquo;s Tale one of the best shows Hulu has available in any genre.

<p>Tiny Beautiful Things is a miniseries based on the book of the same name by Wild author Cheryl Strayed. Based on Strayed&rsquo;s real-life experience, this Hulu series sees struggling writer Clare Pierce (Kathryn Hahn) become a successful advice columnist despite her chaotic personal life. Like Wild, Tiny Beautiful Things is a heartfelt, emotional exploration of grief and its lingering effects, and the tearjerking miniseries is beautifully anchored by Hahn, who received an Emmy nomination for her performance.

<p>Release Date   December 2, 2013    Cast   Spencer Grammer , Kari Wahlgren , Chris Parnell , Sarah Chalke , Ian Cardoni , Harry Belden    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Irreverent, vulgar, and surprisingly heartfelt, Rick and Morty has quickly established itself as one of the most popular sci-fi comedies of the past decade. Subverting Back to the Future&rsquo;s central dynamic, the show centers on misanthropic genius Rick Sanchez, who travels the multiverse with his skittish grandson in tow. While Rick and Morty was initially known for its inventive standalone stories, its wider overarching narrative has come to the fore in later seasons, rewarding long-time viewers and newcomers alike.

<p>While somewhat overshadowed by creator Matt Groening&rsquo;s cultural monolith The Simpsons, Futurama remains one of the best and most consistently funny sci-fi shows to ever appear on television. Following the crew of a fictional delivery ship as they embark on journeys across a futuristic galaxy, Futurama is hailed for its colorful cast of characters, satirical look at contemporary concerns through a futuristic scope, and inventive world-building. Despite multiple cancellations and revivals, the show remains hugely popular and one of the best sci-fi shows on Hulu.

Firefly (2002-2003)</p>
<p>Firefly</p>
<p>Release Date   September 20, 2002    Cast   Ron Glass , Morena Baccarin , Alan Tudyk , Adam Baldwin , Summer Glau , Gina Torres , Nathan Fillion , Sean Maher , Jewel Staite    Seasons   1</p>
<p>One of the most notorious and oft-cited one-season wonders in the history of television, Firefly is perhaps the quintessential cult classic show. Despite its short lifespan, Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Buffy the Vampire Slayer follow-up enjoys a dedicated following of fans to this day, many of whom still wonder what might have been had the show avoided cancelation.
Nathan Fillion leads the cast as the captain of a ragtag crew of outlaws taking on various criminal jobs in the war-torn intergalactic world. Infusing Spaghetti Western elements into an original sci-fi setting makes Firefly stand out from other sci-fi shows, and the continuation of the mythos with the Serenity movie only helped secure its status further.

<p>Release Date   September 10, 1993    Cast   Gillian Flynn , David Duchovny , Robert Patrick , Annabeth Gish , Mitch Pileggi    Seasons   11</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget what a phenomenon The X-Files was when it first started airing in the 90s. The eerie and intense show followed FBI agents Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) as they investigated strange and unexplained cases as an unseen threat sought to stop them. The show ignited fan interest, launching the online fan community with theories and fan fiction. Its blend of horror, sci-fi, and classic mystery made for an engrossing story that captured the 90s zeitgeist and dominated pop culture for a decade.</p>

<p>Painting a somewhat romanticized portrait of biker culture, Sons of Anarchy won acclaim from fans and critics for its nuanced characters, exploration of complex ideas, and thrilling story. The series revolves around Hunnam&rsquo;s Jax Taylor, who serves as Vice President (and later President) of the titular gang.
Living on the wrong side of the law leads Taylor and his closely-knit compatriots to engage in vigilantism and other criminal acts, all while contending with the morality of their actions. The show never shies away from questioning the efficacy of the group&rsquo;s actions, while still placing them as heroes in a chaotic and morally confusing world.

Fargo (2014-Present)</p>
<p>Fargo</p>
<p>Release Date   April 15, 2014    Cast   Billy Bob Thornton , Allison Tolman , Martin Freeman , Kirsten Dunst , Patrick Wilson , Jesse Plemons , Ewan McGregor , Carrie Coon , Chris Rock , Jessie Buckley , Jason Schwartzman , Juno Temple , Jon Hamm    Seasons   5</p>
<p>As the original Fargo film is such a cultural and critical touchstone, the announcement of a spin-off series was met with some surprise and no small amount of skepticism. First premiering in 2014, Fargo follows an anthology format and takes place in the same continuity and Midwestern settings as the film. However, the crime series takes an entirely different approach from the Coen brothers&rsquo; classic.
Each season tells a different story, with the complex narrative allowing a new compelling cast of characters to shine. Fargo has seen gripping performances from the likes of Martin Freeman, Chris Rock, Ewan McGregor, and Jon Hamm establishing it as a showcase for some of the best talent working in the entertainment industry.

<p>Release Date   July 13, 2014    Cast   Kevin Durand , Jack Kesy , Mia Maestro , Richard Sammel , David Bradley , Corey Stoll , Jonathan Hyde    Seasons   4</p>
<p>Created by horror auteur Guillermo del Toro and based on his co-authored novel series of the same name, The Strain is a bold reinvention of the vampire myth.
