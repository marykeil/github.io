## Literature Review
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 13 has captivating storylines. However, viewers won’t get the next dose of drama until December 27.




The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills won’t air on TV on December 27. Over the years, the famous Bravo series has rebranded itself completely. Major cast members like Taylor Armstrong and Camille Grammer have left, while newcomers like Crystal Kung Minkoff and Sutton Stracke have joined the show. In the ongoing season 13, the series has featured Kyle Richards’ neighbor, Annemarie Wiley, as the newest addition. It also focused on Kyle’s relationship drama with her husband, Mauricio Umansky. Ahead of the season, Kyle promised fans would get the answers to the rumors surfacing on social media last year.




The first nine episodes of RHOBH season 13 featured drama between the famous housewives. They showed Sutton confronting Kyle about her split rumors, Erika Jayne apologizing for gossiping about Dorit Kemsley’s marriage, Garcelle Beauvais navigating her relationships, and much more. Lisa Rinna was the only major cast member who didn’t appear on the show. One of the earlier episodes showed her resignation letter stating she won’t renew her contract. According to Lisa, she quit the show because she had a dream where her late mother advised her to do so. She was also tired of the drama and editing blunders.
