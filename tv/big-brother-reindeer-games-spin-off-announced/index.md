## Literature Review
During the Big Brother season 25 finale, host Julie Chen Moonves announces a brand-new spin-off series called Big Brother Reindeer Games.




The Big Brother season 25 finale brought some brand-new holiday flair with the announcement of the new spin-off series Big Brother Reindeer Games. Ahead of the two-hour live finale event, host Julie Chen Moonves teased fans that a holiday surprise would be coming soon. Rumors started floating around online that the news would be a Legends edition of Big Brother. After crowning Big Brother 25&#39;s competition beast Jag Bains the winner and Matt Klotz the runner-up, Julie announced there was something happening in the house. Much like the Big Brother 25 premiere, Danielle Reyes, Britney Haynes, and Frankie Grande sneaked into the house to help Julie make the announcement.




Big Brother Reindeer Games, which will run this holiday season beginning December 11, is a new concept for the production team. According to Variety, nine former contestants will battle it out in holiday-themed challenges.


 

Inviting Big Brother legends and greats back to the Big Brother family to compete against each other, the new series will be a limited-run competition show, spanning just six episodes. While Big Brother 23&#39;s Derek Xiao and Tiffany Mitchell, along with Big Brother 11 winner Jordan Lloyd, will come on as hosts, Big Brother Reindeer Games will also feature a Big Brother 25 houseguest.
