# Black Sails Captain Benjamin Hornigold s History With The Jacobites Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Captain Benjamin Hornigold&#39;s historical connection to the English Jacobite movement adds important historical context to the story of Black Sails and explains how he became a pirate.   The Golden Age of Piracy was not just a romantic act of rebellion, but a complex result of the tumultuous political climate of the time, with the Jacobite movement playing a significant role.   The War of the Spanish Succession and the transition of power to George I left many Jacobite privateers politically homeless, driving them to turn to piracy for their livelihoods, as depicted in Black Sails.

## Literature Review
Before becoming one of history&#39;s most notorious pirates, Captain Benjamin Hornigold was associated with the famous English Jacobite movement.




Although his character in Black Sails is understandably defined by his piracy, Captain Benjamin Hornigold also had an interesting historical connection to the English Jacobite movement. Portrayed by British actor Patrick Lyster, the real Hornigold had a complicated life incorporating many different political alliances and affiliations. Although he is a supporting character in the show, understanding and appreciating these tendencies provides important historical context to the overarching Black Sails story, making the drama even richer in the process.




While many today view the Golden Age of Piracy through a romantic lens as an act of personal rebellion against the status quo, Black Sails makes it clear that the truth was much more complicated. While some pirates were certainly attracted by the thrill of adventure, others fell into the profession almost accidentally as a result of a tumultuous political climate. The Jacobite movement formed a key part of this landscape. As such, understanding its history helps shed light on many of Black Sails&#39; real characters, in some cases even explaining how they became outlaws in the first place.


 Captain Benjamin Hornigold Was A Jacobite Before He Turned To Piracy 
          

According to Black Sails, Hornigold was an avowed Jacobite before turning to piracy, identifying him as a supporter of the Stuart dynasty of British monarchs. The true extent of this political inclination is unknown, as many historical sources are unclear as to the depth of his commitment. However, the show makes this affiliation an important part of both his and his crew&#39;s identity, while also faithfully honoring the significance of the Jacobite movement in the era.

Hornigold&#39;s association with the Jacobites is clearly established in Black Sails season 1. In a conversation with Hal Gates, Hornigold reveals that he has recently discovered that James Francis Edward Stuart (the Jacobite claimant to the throne) has recently fled to France. This places Hornigold in the difficult position of having to reconcile his men to change from Catholic insurgents to simple criminals with no hope of seeing their preferred king ascend the throne. This Jacobite connection (and its failure as a political campaign) helps explain why a man like Hornigold could find himself forced into piracy despite initially having very different intentions.

The Jacobites played a vital role in establishing the so-called Golden Age of Piracy in which Black Sails is set. The political conflict between the Houses of Stuart and Hanover formed part of the backdrop to the War of the Spanish Succession, a Europe-wide conflict that had global implications. It was during this war that privateering, a form of officially sanctioned piracy, became especially prevalent in the Caribbean.

However, once the War of the Spanish Succession finished in 1714 and George I assumed the throne of Great Britain, many Stuart-sympathizing Jacobite privateers were left politically homeless. Combined with an aptitude for larceny honed by years as privateers, many of these men turned to full-blown piracy as a means of making their livelihoods. This context explains how characters like James Hornigold, who in some ways seem very different from the popular conception of a bloodthirsty murderous pirate, could be forced into such an infamous profession in Black Sails.
