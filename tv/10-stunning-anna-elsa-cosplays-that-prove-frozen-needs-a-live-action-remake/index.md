## Literature Review

Cosplayers from all over the world have had such extraordinary Anna and Elsa outfits, that they&#39;ve proved a live-action remake of Frozen is a must.




Disney’s Frozen was one of the most successful animated films of all time, and audiences continue to show their love for the movie with stunning cosplays that prove why a live-action remake needs to happen. Considering the extraordinary success of Frozen, it seems inevitable that eventually a live-action remake of the story of sisters Elsa and Anna will be told on the big screen. The winter wonder, magical music, and rousing adventure of Frozen would work well as a live-action story and countless cosplayers have showcased how good a real-life Anna and Elsa would look.
While viewers have speculated about which actors would be perfectly cast in a live-action remake of Frozen, there are plenty of cosplayers who have proved that they have what it takes to take up these iconic roles. From outfits that demonstrate the extraordinary potential of Elsa’s magical ice-powers to the beautiful resilience of Anna and Elsa&#39;s sisterly friendship, these are some of the best cosplays out there. With even a few appearances by the beloved snowman Olaf, these prove why a live-action remake of Frozen needs to happen.









 








 10  Elsa Hops On Her High Horse 


Elsa the Snow Queen in Disney’s Frozen was born with the power of ice and snow and possessed the magical ability to manipulate the frosty elements. From snow flurries to blizzards, Elsa’s powers are controlled by her emotions and this stunning portrayal of Elsa riding on the back of a horse made of ice expertly showcased the potential for magic and wonder in a live-action version of Frozen. Surrounded by the magic and wonder of Elsa’s ice palace, this cosplay highlighted just how incredible a real-life version of Frozen would be.





 9  The Snow Queen Elsa At Home With Nature 


The winter wonderland magical powers of Elsa from Frozen were controlled by her emotions. When she was angry, stressed, or afraid, she lost control and could do great damage. However, when Elsa was happy, peaceful, and content, she could control them better and create beautiful snowy creations. This cosplay showed Elsa at home with nature, having magically transformed the landscape into a blanket of snow, she looked in awe at the frozen branches of the tree. These beautiful snowy depictions of nature would look great in a live-action version of Frozen.





 8  The Sisterly Friendship of Anna and Elsa 


The central relationship at the heart of Frozen was the bond and understanding between sisters Anna and Elsa. After Elsa ran away because she could not control her powers, she was afraid of the negative consequences for those in her life. However, she left Anna without explaining what had happened, and she felt excluded and like the kindness they had shown to each other in childhood was falling away. A live-action version of Frozen could show the beauty of their sisterly bond on the big screen and once again warm the hearts of audiences with its enduring story of kindness.





 7  Elsa With Her Snowman Creation Olaf 


Perhaps the strangest and yet best thing to come from Elsa’s magical powers was the enchanted snowman Olaf. With a love for summer and all things hot, at his core Olaf had great quotes and was a hilarious contradiction. However, his fun-loving zest for life and devotion to both Anna and Elsa must be commended as he acted as an important part of Anna’s quest to reach her sister in hiding. A live-action remake of Frozen would have to account for the cartoonish wonder of Olaf and ensure he was just as much of an enjoyable character and a funny sidekick within the story.





 6  Elsa In Disneyland 


While audiences are excitedly looking forward to the possibility of a live-action remake of Frozen, there are actually some real-life examples of Elsa the Snow Queen that viewers can get to see. The magic of Frozen can melt the hearts of all those who wish it at the wonderous Frozen attractions in various Disneyland theme parks across the globe. Disneyland Paris featured a spectacular Frozen parade that included Anna, Elsa, Olaf, and Kristoff. While attendees can enjoy a royal welcome from Anna and Elsa themselves at Disneyland California Adventure Park.





 5  Anna On Her Way To The Winter Ball 


Anna was the optimistic, big-hearted, and slightly socially awkward little sister of Elsa. While the two sisters had a close childhood bond, it fell away as they grew older, and Elsa felt a need to feel shameful about her magical powers. This incredible cosplay of Anna captured the heart of the character and showcased her in her classic outfit from 2013’s Frozen. A live-action remake in this style would look absolutely incredible and demonstrate for audiences the real-live power of magic.





 4  Elsa And Jack Frost 


While Anna had two love interests in 2013’s Frozen, Elsa was too caught up in the negative aspects of her powers to focus on love. Anna realized the villainous side of Prince and Hans and soon formed a bond with the young ice-man Kristoff. However, this cosplay showed that Elsa may have a lot in common with another ice-based magician, Jack Frost, from Rise of the Guardians. While it may have not been part of the original story, a crossover with other Disney characters such as this in a live-action Frozen could be interesting.





 3  Anna, Elsa, and Olaf Together At Last 


The trio of friends, Anna, Elsa, and Olaf, shared so much in common and also had distinct personalities that made them work well together as a group. With Ann’s fun-loving nature and innate optimism, Elsa’s resilience and determination to protect those that she loved, and Olaf’s innocence and childlike sense of wonder, all three have something valuable to offer. A live-action remake of Frozen could bring all these qualities to the forefront and give viewers another reason to love this heartwarming trio.





 2  Elsa Became Popular All Over The World 


Frozen was not just a runaway success in the United States, the film was a smash hit all over the world and was an animated film that grossed over $1 billion at the box office. As a result, Frozen became a cultural phenomenon with viewers all over the world, such as this cosplayer at Tokyo Disneyland, joining in on the fun and dressing up all their favorite Frozen characters. A live-action remake of Frozen could utilize its cross-continental appeal and cast actors from all over the world to play parts such as Elsa, Anna, and Kristoff.





 1  Anna and Elsa Are Always There For One Another 


Frozen told the story of two sisters, one who ran away to protect the ones she loved, and the other who did not know why her sister became closed off and hid her emotions. Throughout this story of adventure, music, and winter wonder, a beautiful tale of friendship, connections, and the enduring power of family was told. This cosplay of Anna and Elsa showcased the extraordinary strength of their bond with one another, and a live-action remake of Frozen would provide the opportunity to bring this animated tale of togetherness into the realm of reality.
