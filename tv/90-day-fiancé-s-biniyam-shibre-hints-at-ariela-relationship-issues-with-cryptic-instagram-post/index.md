## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 9&#39;s Biniyam Shibre and Ariela Weinberg have sparked split rumors after the Ethiopian man&#39;s latest Instagram video confuses fans.




90 Day Fiancé star Biniyam Shibre fueled split rumors with Ariela Weinberg with his cryptic new video on social media. Biniyam is a 33-year-old actor, singer, and dancer from Ethiopia who was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 2 with Ariela in 2020. Ariela, a former freelance journalist, met him while hailing a cab in his country, and the couple dated for a couple of months before getting pregnant with their first child. Ariela welcomed their son Aviel Shibre and got engaged to Biniyam in the finale.




Ariela and Biniyam faced challenges regarding infidelity and trust issues before they married in 90 Day Fiancé season 9. Biniyam has been living in the U.S. with Ariela ever since, but Biniyam&#39;s latest Instagram post suggests he and Ariela could be headed toward a divorce.


 

Biniyam chose not to add a caption to his Instagram video. It showed a picture of him superimposed over a video of Lady Gaga singing &#34;Always Remember Us This Way&#34; from the movie A Star Is Born. The powerful ballad from the 2018 movie references the film&#39;s characters, Jackson and Ally. Lady Gaga sings a haunting tribute to the better memories of their intense relationship, which has come to an end.

 Biniyam &amp; Ariela&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Since Biniyam did not bother explaining the meaning behind his strange upload, fans in the comments section came up with theories about what Biniyam could have been trying to say. &#34;I’m confused did something bad happen?&#34; asked the top commenter on the post. &#34;Sounds like he broke up with the wife maybe?&#34; said someone else. A fan wrote that they&#39;d noticed both Biniyam and Ariela had stopped liking each other&#39;s Instagram posts for over a month. The fan wanted to know if the popular 90 Day Fiancé couple was still together.

Meanwhile, one fan even called Biniyam &#34;vain.&#34; Another fan&#39;s reply to them said, &#34;He seems to have become that way...Good ol&#39; America.&#34; Biniyam&#39;s other Instagram posts also feature him. He likes to show off his physique on social media. It makes sense, since Biniyam had aspirations of making it big in the MMA. Biniyam also hoped to launch an acting and singing career in America. The couple had seemingly moved to Las Vegas to help Biniyam achieve his dreams.




Biniyam&#39;s last video together with Ariela was posted in October 2023. However, he hasn&#39;t deleted or archived the post, which could mean all is well between him and his wife, and the Lady Gaga video is something that aesthetically appealed to him. Biniyam and Ariela often argued about their exes still being present in their lives. Ariela was still married to her ex-husband Leandro when she met Biniyam. Leandro and Ariela remained friends even after their divorce and Ariela&#39;s wedding to Biniyam. Unless Biniyam or Ariela don&#39;t deny the rumors themselves, fans might keep looking around for clues to figure out if the 90 Day Fiancé couple has indeed split.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
