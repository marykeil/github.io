 Hazbin Hotel Is A Unique Venture For Prime Video 
         

Across its near-10 years of producing original shows, Hazbin Hotel stands out as a unique step for Prime Video by venturing into the world of adult animation. Aside from producing continuations of Gary and His Demons and Pantheon, the streamer has only occasionally tackled said genre, with the few examples being the Critical Role-based The Legend of Vox Machina and acclaimed adaptation of Robert Kirkman&#39;s Invincible. The latter also came on the heels of Prime Video&#39;s success with The Boys, which itself got an animated expansion in The Boys Presents: Diabolical.




With Hazbin Hotel, however, Prime Video can look to mark their own stamp on the growing field of adult animated shows by being behind an original project. Adult Swim has been reaping the rewards of Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland&#39;s vision for Rick and Morty for the past decade, while FX has found success with the likes of Archer, Hulu with Solar Opposites and Netflix with the Big Mouth franchise. Though animated shows are often associated with younger viewers, it&#39;s become clear that audiences are just as keen for something that leans into R-rated territory in the same format.

While much of their previous output in the field has come from adaptations of prior works, should Hazbin Hotel prove to be a success, it could very well be the start of a lasting relationship with creator/director Vivienne Medrano. Season 2 has already been ordered for the show by the streamer, but with the unique world she&#39;s created in the show, it would be interesting to see if she sets up potential spinoffs that Prime Video would be keen to capitalize on.
