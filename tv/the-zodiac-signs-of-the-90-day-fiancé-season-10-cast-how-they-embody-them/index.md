A look into the birthdays and zodiac signs of 90 Day Fiancé couples from season 10 and how they affect their relationships. The iconic reality TV show is celebrating a decade of love stories, family drama, communication issues, cultural shocks, and age gaps with its 2023 edition. It’s the OG of them all which led to the network creating over 26 more spin-offs using older cast members and newcomers.

 7  Jasmine Pineda &amp; Gino Palazzolo 
Leo &amp; Aquarius


 







90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine was born on 22 August. Jasmine is a Leo woman. Gino hasn’t revealed what day and date his birthday falls on. However, Jasmine had once confirmed that Gino is Aquarius. According to some viewers, Jasmine embodied the characteristics of a Gemini woman, but she revealed that her star sign is Leo, even though one of her sons is a Gemini. Jasmine explained that Aquarius men are unique and authentic, and they don’t care about fitting in with the crowd. Aquarius men would rather stand out by being true to themselves and care more about their careers than popularity, friendship, or love.
Jasmine’s description of an Aquarius man fits Gino just right. Jasmine also wrote that there’s a “higher possibility” for a Leo woman and an Aquarius man to have a compatible relationship if they follow certain rules, such as cutting down their ego and starting to accept each other’s negative and positive traits. Jasmine, who is a strong, independent Leo woman who is devoted and loyal when she finds a partner to connect with, is passionate and loving. According to WikiHow, Aquarius men and Leo women make a strong but sexually and emotionally dramatic match. However, they have to put their egos aside to thrive.





 6  Sophie Sierra &amp; Rob Warne 
Libra &amp; Leo
        

British 90 Day Fiancé star Sophie was born on September 24, 1998. Sophie’s zodiac sign, according to her birthday, is Libra. As per GossipNextDoor, Rob celebrates his birthday on August 17 every year. His birthdate makes Rob a Leo. Cosmopolitan calls a Leo and Libra pairing the “best-dressed couple” of the zodiac. When a Libra and Leo come together, there’s nothing that can break them apart. It explains why, despite the cheating scandals and the fact that Sophie chose to hide her sexuality from Rob, they still decided to stay together. A Leo man is naturally drawn to an alluring Libra woman (via EastroHelp.)
While a Leo man showers her with gifts and attention, his Libra partner brings stability to the relationship and provides her mate with the composure he lacks in his life. However, “unhealthy communication” can create friction between the pair as demonstrated by the incident when Sophie saw Rob using Snapchat to receive naughty videos and accused him of cheating on her when he wasn’t. Libra is indecisive and Leo is impulsive, and they can go for days without speaking to each other like Sophie did when she decided to move out and get her own apartment to teach Rob a lesson, only for them to eventually get back together.





 5  Nikki Sanders &amp; Igor Shutencov AKA Justin 
Aquarius &amp; Libra
        

Nicole Sanders, who’s better known by her stage name Nikki Exotika, was born on January 27. As per GossipNextDoor, Justin celebrates his birthday on September 22. Like Gino, Nicole’s star sign is also Aquarius, while Justin is a Libra man. Both Aquarius and Libra belong to the element of Air, meaning they usually fall hard and fast in love, get together fast, and “in many cases- break up fast” according to ZodiacSign. This logic holds true for Nikki and Justin who began dating when they met each other on a friends&#39; site almost two decades ago and broke up within two years when Nikki told Justin about her past as a biological man.
Aquarius can truly help Libra express their sexuality. The problems with Libra’s Sun bring too much concern for the opinions of other people. They can go to extremes when it comes to the way they show their sexuality or are too afraid to be judged to the point of seeming “too asexual.” Nikki and Justin’s storyline this season has been all about her demanding sex from him, while Justin has been afraid of getting physical with her. He refuses to indulge in PDA, fearing what people might think of him given Nikki’s unique appearance, making Nikki feel unaccepted and unfulfilled.
Libra want to look nice and act nice for others, while Aquarius wants to go in the opposite direction of everyone, “sometimes even if there is no reason to do so,” which explains why Nikki has her individual style, which makes her stand out. A Libra and Aquarius couple often have difficulty adjusting to each other’s character and finding deep respect for one another. The Aquarius partner is upfront and direct, while Libra wasting too much time on making a decision can become quite unnerving for the partner. However, the compatibility between the two is high, which means Nikki and Justin could be in this relationship for the long haul.





 4  Ashley Rochelle &amp; Manuel Velez 
Unknown &amp; Scorpio


Manuel’s birthday is on 15 November according to GossipNextDoor, however, Ashley’s birthdate is unknown at the moment. Manuel is a Scorpio and Cosmopolitan writes that some of a Scorpio man’s best traits are that he is loyal, passionate, creative, and surprisingly romantic. He has a powerful intuition which means he can always tell when his partner is in a bad mood and knows exactly what to do to cheer them up. On the other hand, he is also notorious for holding grudges and is one of the most sensitive zodiac signs on the inside.
During fights, a Scorpio man will bring up resentments from ages that he has been holding on to all the time, which can be seen when Manuel and Ashley get into arguments on season 10. He can get obsessive and jealous, so it won’t be surprising if the show decides to introduce a forgotten ex or male friend of Ashley’s who will get on Manuel’s last nerve and make him paranoid.





 3  Devin Hoofman &amp; Seungdo “Nick” Ham 
Libra &amp; Unknown
        

As per GossipNextDoor, Devin was born on October 13. Nick’s birthday is not available. Just like Sophie and Justin, Devin’s birthdate makes her a Libra. A report by Vogue says that Libras can get overwhelmed with making decisions and, in the early stages of their relationship, desire their partner to be the assertive one. Nick began calling Devin a “piggy” when they started dating, and she never once complained about it leading him to think it was an okay thing for him to do.
They often won’t want to say anything if they’re angry or frustrated with their partner, because they would prefer to avoid conflict at all costs. Libras are also indecisive, which is a trait that Devin showed while shopping for her wedding dress. It takes a lot of effort to get a Libra to open up about their emotions. Devin’s mom confirmed this by saying Devin never really appears upset because she is an introvert with her emotions, which is why her mom has learned to read her through her body language.





 2  Clayton Clark &amp; Anali Vallejos 
Unknown
        

Both Clayton and Anali’s birthdays, unfortunately, have not been revealed online. This makes it difficult to deduce how compatible they are according to their zodiac. Clayton’s reserved nature and Anali’s outgoing personality are the perfect example of how opposites attract. However, it may not have been reason enough for Anali to split with Clayton, since they are reportedly married now.





 1  Sam Wilson &amp; Citra 


Sam’s birthday is on September 18, as per GossipNextDoor and that makes him a Virgo. Citra was born on June 20 which makes her a Gemini. WikiHow notes that both Virgo men and Gemini women have very strong communication skills. They can talk to each other about anything under the sun while feeling heard and understood. Sam came clean to Citra about his drug addiction within a year of meeting her online. Citra did not shun Sam for his past, but instead gave him the love and support he needed the most at the time.
Unfortunately, Virgo and Gemini also struggle when it comes to building trust. Sam doesn’t think Citra will want to be with him when he tells her that he’s facing jail time. While they are both masters at communication, Virgos have trust issues until they feel secure about the relationship. Moreover, they also have different personalities because a Gemini can be spontaneous and a Virgo values stability. If Sam and Citra manage to balance one another out and overcome their differences with clear, respectful communication, there’s no stopping them from being the best couple on 90 Day Fiancé season 10.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
