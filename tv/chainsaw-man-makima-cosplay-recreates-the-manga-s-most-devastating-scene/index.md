## Literature Review

A fan reimagines the shocking scene and shows why Makima will always be the most unforgettable character from the series.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for Chainsaw Man Part 1, chapter 75!!




Chainsaw Man has taken the anime community by storm â€“ and the enigmatic Makima is partly to blame for this. Fans quickly fell in love with her powerful and mysterious personality, establishing her as one of the most recognizable characters from the series. In a recent post on Reddit, u/Reyz_001 recreated the beloved character in one of her most terrifying moments.

The gallery of photos shows the fan donning a black dress while standing in the water. As a tribute to the character&#39;s true identity, they are seen holding a chain in their hands and staring menacingly into the camera. Much like Makima during the devastating reveal, Reyz_001&#39;s look is completed by a pink halo extending from their head.


 

However, the most chilling part of the cosplay is how the Reddit user recreates the Control Devil&#39;s ominous expression.




                  One Piece&#39;s Ultimate Enemy is Connected to Shonen Jump&#39;s Best Modern Villain   While One Piece and Chainsaw Man are extremely different series, their ultimate antagonists are eerily similar in a number of interesting ways.

Makima is introduced as a kind and friendly person who helps Denji after he becomes Chainsaw Man. However, she slowly shows her true colors as a manipulative person willing to go to any lengths to achieve her goal of controlling the Chainsaw Devil that inhabits Denji&#39;s body. In Chapter 75 of the manga, she is revealed to be the Control Devil after the President of the United States makes a contract with the Gun Devil to have her killed.

Reyz_001&#39;s cosplay reimagines the scene where Makima is attacked by the Gun Devil, but instead of dying, she forms a halo out of her brain matter. Giving off an angelic appearance, she uses her chains to harness the powers of Aki, the Angel Devil, and other deceased Devil Hunters. This leads to a devastating affair with thousands of casualties, including Aki. Denji later kills Makima with a chainsaw made from Power&#39;s blood, and is tasked with caring for the small child who becomes Makima&#39;s reincarnation.




Despite the antagonist&#39;s death, her influence remains present throughout the story. As the first of the Four Horseman to be revealed in the series, she brilliantly foreshadowed the appearances of her sisters, who serve as major antagonists in Part 2 of the manga. Makima is also notable for being one of the strongest characters in the series, a quality that makes her especially popular with fans. With Chainsaw Man&#39;s upcoming feature-length film and fan creations, like Reyz_001&#39;s stunning cosplay, it&#39;s unlikely that Makima will be forgotten anytime soon.
