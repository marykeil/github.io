## Literature Review
The performing artist of Dragon Ball&#39;s first opening song has confirmed that he will be lending his voice to Dragon Ball DAIMA.




Dragon Ball DAIMA is fully embracing its comparisons to the original Dragon Ball anime by recalling the artist of the franchise&#39;s first opening song, Hiroki Takahashi, to perform DAIMA&#39;s theme. Set to be released in October 2024, the original anime series is a much-needed addition to the franchise considering how long the franchise has been away for.




Announced on October 12 2023, in last year&#39;s New York Comic Con, Dragon Ball DAIMA is already a highly anticipated series. With a totally original plot that will have a lot of supervision from the creator of the series, there&#39;s a lot to be excited about.


 

As confirmed by the official X account of Hiroki, he will be the artist of Dragon Ball DAIMA&#39;s opening song.

Hiroki Takahashi has been there since the beginning of the series, so it is only right that he is involved in this new exciting project. Titled &#34;Makafushigi Adventure!&#34; (Mystical Adventure), he was the musician alongside composer Shinsuke Kikuchi behind the franchise&#39;s most iconic and nostalgic song. Besides being a talented artist, he has been a voice actor in many other anime, most notably Hunter X Hunter (2011), Bleach, The Prince of Tennis, and Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, to name a few. With more than 30 years in the anime industry, there are few people more suited for this role than Hiroki.

This move by the production committee is very brilliant, as it goes further in demonstrating that Daima embodies the soul of Dragon Ball more than any of the other spin-offs and sequels. This original series will see the main cast, such as Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, Picollo, and others transformed into their childhood selves by mysterious villains. To get their bodies back and put a stop to what these villains are planning, they go on an exciting adventure. Set to premiere in October 2024, 40 years after the start of the Dragon Ball manga, this series will invoke deep nostalgia as it depicts a form of Goku last seen in the 1980s.




          

The series will bring on board many veterans who have worked on the Dragon Ball series and other Toei Animation works such as One Piece and Sailor Moon. It will also feature an unprecedented level of supervision from Akira Toriyama, the creator of the franchise, giving fans hope that Daima will indeed be a success. Based on the trailer and every available information, there is a lot of optimism regarding this upcoming series, and although many fans wanted a continuation of Dragon Ball Super, Dragon Ball DAIMA will be a must-watch considering how much love and the amount of resources that are being poured into it.
