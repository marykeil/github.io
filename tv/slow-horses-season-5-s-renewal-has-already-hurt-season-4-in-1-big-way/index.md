# Slow Horses Season 5 s Renewal Has Already Hurt Season 4 In 1 Big Way


## SUMMARY 



  The early renewal of Slow Horses for a fifth season diminishes the suspense and stakes for season 4 as the audience knows major characters will return.   The death tease in the season 4 trailer is likely a red herring or refers to a minor character, as it is unlikely that one of Jackson Lamb&#39;s core team members will die.   Fans can expect the release of Slow Horses season 4 in 2024, and more information about the plot and additional characters will be revealed in the coming months.

## Literature Review

The renewal of Slow Horses for Season 5 means the show will be around for at least two more seasons but it hurts the story for Season 4 in one way. 




Slow Horses, the hit Apple TV&#43; show about disgraced British intelligence agents, was recently renewed for a fifth season of the series, but the season 5 renewal hurts season 4 in a major way. A trailer for Slow Horses season 4 was released at the conclusion of season 3 on December 27, 2023, as apparently the production for the next season is well underway and much of the filming has been done. Key moments from that trailer combined with information about casting and plot for season 5 might remove some of the drama that were teased about the new episodes.




Slow Horses, based on Mick Herron&#39;s novel of the same name, centers around a group of cast-offs from the British Intelligence Agency MI5 who have been banished to the dreaded Slough House because of unforgivable mistakes while on the job. Each season of the Slow Horses television series is based around one novel in Herron&#39;s series, with Slow Horses season 3 (based on Real Tigers) recently concluding in December 2023. Renewals for seasons 5 (based on London Rules) was quickly announced by Apple TV&#43;, but one moment from the new season 4 trailer lowers the stakes for the following season.


 


 Season 5&#39;s Confirmation Lowers The Stakes For Slow Horses Season 4 
          




It was a curious move to announce the renewal of Slow Horses for season 5 before season 4 begins, but it follows a pattern of Slow Horses announcing seasons 3 and 4 simultaneously. A move like this significantly lowers the stakes for season 4 when the audience knows there will be at least a major contingency of the characters returning for some new threat that MI5 will face in season 5. The move to quickly renew season 5 makes sense from a business perspective for Apple TV&#43; as the show has become wildly popular, but it does minimize the tension in the first of these new seasons.



The first three seasons of Slow Horses are available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.




The season 5 renewal confirmed four major characters Slow Horses cast would return: Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman), Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung), River Cartwright (Jack Lowden), and Diana Taverner (Kristin Scott Thomas). That makes the primary characters safe for season 4, which lowers the stakes. Season 4 of Slow Horses should be released in 2024, so the answers about the plot and additional characters should be answered sometime in the next few months, but knowing each major character in season 4 will return certainly will minimize any perilous situations they find themselves in for the upcoming episodes later this year.






 Slow Horses Season 4&#39;s Death Tease Was (Probably) A Fake Out 
          

The end of the trailer for Slow Horses season 4 teased a dead member of Lamb&#39;s team. Based on the above, it seems likely that this isn&#39;t a major character in the show. Another possibility, knowing the sarcasm and half-truths that Jackson Lamb uses as currency, is that he could be lying about the death or talking about someone who works at MI5&#39;s that they have tasked with trailing Lamb. Considering the emotion Lamb showed after the death of Sid Baker in Slow Horses season 1, it&#39;s unlikely Lamb would be that flippant and cold-hearted about one of his core team members.

Knowing that the show was renewed for a fifth season in 2025, the tease of a member of Jackson Lamb&#39;s team dying is probably a red herring meant to keep fans guessing about the primary characters. Another possibility is that a minor character will be added to Lamb&#39;s team in season 4 just to be killed off, much like they did with Jed Moody in season 1. Whether it&#39;s a lie, a new team member, or some kind of double agent, the likelihood of one of Lamb&#39;s core team dying in season 4 of Slow Horses is very slim.




              Slow Horses  Slow Horses is an adaptation of CWA Gold Dagger Award-winning Mick Herron’s first novel in the &#34;Slow Horses&#34; series, which follows a team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 – Slough House. Gary Oldman stars as Jackson Lamb, the brilliant but irascible leader of the spies who end up in Slough House due to their career-ending mistakes.
