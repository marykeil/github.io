# Doctor Who Showrunner Details Cut Seasonal Special Goblin King Battle 


## SUMMARY 



  Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies reveals that a creative battle between companion Ruby Sunday and the Goblin King was almost included in the recent seasonal special, but had to be cut due to budget constraints.   The Goblin King&#39;s attack on the Sundays&#39; flat would have been a chaotic and creative sequence, but the final scene focusing on Ruby&#39;s disappearance allowed for further characterization and exploration of the characters&#39; arcs.   While the battle with the Goblin King would have added excitement, the episode was still effective without it.

## Literature Review
Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies reveals that &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; almost featured a large-scale battle with the Goblin King.




Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies reveals the recent seasonal special almost featured a creative battle between companion Ruby Sunday and the Goblin King itself. Actor Millie Gibson joined the series as Ruby in the 2023 special, where the foundling in search of her parents crosses paths with Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor during a battle with the goblins. Gibson is set to return in both Doctor Who season 14, which debuts in May, and the already-confirmed season 15, which will air in 2025.




However, Davies revealed during Doctor Who: Video Commentaries that one moment focused on the companion didn&#39;t make the final episode. The showrunner revealed that before the Doctor visited the moment of Ruby&#39;s abandonment, the Goblin King originally attacked the Sundays&#39; flat, leading to Ruby creatively facing off against the beast by using their probability powers against them. The episode&#39;s budget wouldn&#39;t allow for this battle. Check out Davies&#39; explanation below:


Russell T Davies: Originally, they got back to the flat, and everything was fine, and then the Goblin King attacked, and he arrived in the bedroom, and came down the hall, so it was brilliant. Sorry, it was brilliant. He was coming down the hall. But earlier on we’d established that Carla gives everyone a scratchcard for Christmas, like when the social workers say, “Oh, have a scratchcard, have a scratchcard. Hope you win, blah blah blah.”
So, there’s a pile of scratchcards in the kitchen. So Ruby fought off the Goblin King with luck. She kept scratching them until she won. It was bad luck, bad luck, bad luck. Then she got to like the 15th card and she won £10. And she went “Good luck!” like that, and the Goblin King vanished. And then what we’ve replaced that with is a crack in the roof.






 Would The Goblin King&#39;s Cut Attack Have Changed The Doctor Who Special? 
          

It is understandable why Ruby&#39;s battle with the Goblin King was cut from &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; despite Doctor Who receiving a bigger budget from Disney. The puppet for the Goblin King is a hefty piece of practical effects that requires five people to operate, with the creature&#39;s full form not even being seen throughout the episode. While Ruby&#39;s creative scratch card attacks perfectly played with the Goblin&#39;s own powers, making the King himself lead a siege could have proved too much trouble to bring to life.

Furthermore, it could be argued that the episode&#39;s final scene was more effective. Ahead of Ruby&#39;s disappearance due to Goblin interference in her origins, the sequence in the flat allows the episode to slow down and provide further characterization to not only Ruby and her family, but the Doctor himself. Ruby&#39;s tale gives Gatwa&#39;s Doctor the opportunity to relate to her experience, while unpacking the personal trauma the Timeless Child revelations left on him in Doctor Who season 12. As such, a sudden action sequence could have detracted from a moment that allowed the characters to explore their arcs.




From Davies&#39; description, the Goblin King&#39;s siege of the Sundays&#39; flat would have been a chaotic, but creative sequence in the vein of the Christmas Tree attack from &#34;The Christmas Invasion.&#34; While budgetary reasons may have prevented the moment from being brought to life, it can be argued that the episode was still an effective introduction to the companion without it. Furthermore, with the Doctor Who season 14 trailer teasing plenty of action for the Doctor and Ruby, it is clear the companion will have plenty of opportunities to face off against terrifying foes when the series returns in 2024.



Doctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road is currently available on Disney&#43; for international audiences, and BBC iPlayer for UK viewers, while season 14 is expected to air in May 2024.
