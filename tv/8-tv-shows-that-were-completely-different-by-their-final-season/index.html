  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>TV shows often undergo drastic changes over time, whether it&rsquo;s due to casting changes or shifts in creative direction.
Some shows are well-planned from the start, while others adapt and reinvent themselves to keep the audience interested and deliver valuable storytelling.
Shows like Angel, BoJack Horseman, and others have demonstrated how a series can peak in its final season, delivering masterpieces that surpass earlier seasons.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Being able to evolve is a vital part of any successful TV show, but some change so much they&rsquo;re unrecognizable by the end of the series.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normal for a TV show to change over time, but sometimes, this change can become drastic and, for better or worse, make the series completely different by the final season. The premise of a show, or the defining themes of its narrative, might become tired or overdone while the show is still airing, or viewers might stop tuning in because they&rsquo;re growing bored with the content. If this is true, it&rsquo;s the job of a series to reinvent itself so that audience members are interested in the episodes and the show has something valuable to say.
Casting changes, running for many seasons, or simply a shift in the creative direction of the show can all contribute to differences in a series as it progresses. Some creators always planned that the show would change drastically over time, and had each season arc premeditated before they ever aired. While not every series is this well planned in its infancy, it will still change regardless, because of the elements on the show that are out of anyone&rsquo;s control.
It&rsquo;s the job of a series to reinvent itself so that audience members are interested in the episodes and the show has something valuable to say.</p>
<p>10 TV Shows That Peaked With Their Final Season<br>
Most TV shows run out of steam toward the end, but a select few manage to save the best for last, delivering masterpieces in their final seasons.</p>
<p>8 Angel (1999 - 2004)
What started as a simple spin-off told some of the best stories of the franchise.</p>
<p>Angel</p>
<p>Release Date  October 5, 1999   Seasons  5   Writers Joss Whedon   Network The WB   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , Disney+   Showrunner  David Greenwalt</p>
<p>After Angel (David Boreanaz) left Buffy The Vampire Slayer at the end of season 3, he became the star of Angel. The series revolved around his experience fighting crime in Los Angeles. Starting as an emulation of early Buffy episodes, it follows the traditional monster-of-the-week format with some longer arcs to keep the audience engaged. Although Angel was canceled after season 5, that season was its peak and proved how the series could have worked brilliantly if it had continued. At its height, Angel was a darker and more serious exploration of the fight between good and evil.</p>
<p>7 ER (1994 - 2009)
An enormous turnover in casting resulted in massive shifts in tone.</p>
<p>Although ER is best known for its early seasons, there is still plenty to be enjoyed from the later ones as well. By the end of the series, none of the original cast might have remained, but they were replaced by newcomers who worked hard to establish themselves as strong performers on the show. One pitfall that ER faced as it grew was that the incidents at the hospital became more melodramatic. In the beginning, the medical situations were still high-stakes, but the interpersonal drama was not as complex and entangled.</p>
<p>6 MASH (1972 - 1983)
The Korean War dramedy that made history time and again.</p>
<p>Though MASH was enormously popular, there was a cast exodus in MASH that made the show great by introducing some of its best characters in the later seasons. Though most viewers remember Hawkeye (Alan Alda) and Trapper (Wayne Rogers) the best, the changes that were made to the cast brought B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell), Hawkeye&rsquo;s best companion. Eleven seasons is a lot, and while that did affect the characters, it also made the show more complex. The series took a light look at the militaristic setting, but by the end, the serious consequences of war were on full display.</p>
<p>5 BoJack Horseman (2014 - 2020)
From a take on the life of an aging Hollywood star to a searing character study.</p>
<p>BoJack Horseman</p>
<p>Release Date  August 22, 2014   Seasons  6   Writers  Raphael Bob-Waksberg   Streaming Service(s) Netflix   Showrunner  Raphael Bob-Waksberg</p>
<p>Every episode of the final season of BoJack Horseman employs a unique storytelling method and brings the themes of the show full circle. When the series began, it was a comedic, if sometimes dark, satirization of the perils of fame and what the spotlight does to a person. By the end, it was a critical evaluation of trauma and was frequently asking itself if a person&rsquo;s difficult past can ever justify their bad behavior in the present. BoJack (Will Arnett) might have been the protagonist of the series, but by the end, he certainly wasn&rsquo;t the hero.
It wasn&rsquo;t only BoJack who evolved and showed his true colors throughout the show, but every single character. These characters were also not only what changed but also the style of filmmaking and episode formulas. Further into the series, more episodes become experimental and diverge from the linear storytelling of season 1. While season 1 is still a strong piece of television, it pales in comparison to what BoJack Horseman would become.</p>
<p>4 Halt And Catch Fire (2014 - 2017)
A workplace drama turned exploration into the evolution of technology.</p>
<p>Few people watched Halt and Catch Fire while it was airing, but that didn&rsquo;t stop the series from becoming new and pushing itself to expand the story with every season. At first, the series played it too safe, following the formula of other dramas that centered around office politics and took place in the past, the 1980s in Halt and Catch Fire. However, once the creators realized what an opportunity they had with the subject matter of the show, it soared in the following seasons.
Season 2 kicks things off beautifully by honing in on the stories of the two female leads, Cameron (Mackenzie Davis) and Donna (Kerry Bishé). Instead of delving into the business side of the tech boom, the show dives deeper into the internet itself, and the people who take refuge within its safety and anonymity. Running for only four seasons, the series worked quickly to make itself relevant, and the amount of ground covered between season 1 and season 4 proves how successful it was.</p>
<p>Halt And Catch Fire&rsquo;s Season 2 Soft Reboot Saved The Show<br>
Halt And Catch Fire season 1 was good but season 2 injected the show with fresh energy and renewed focus on its most interesting characters.</p>
<p>3 Fringe (2008 - 2013)
No longer a crime procedural, but a fully-fledged supernatural adventure.</p>
<p>Fringe</p>
<p>Release Date  September 9, 2008   Seasons  5   Writers  Roberto Orci , J.J. Abrams , Alex Kurtzman   Streaming Service(s) Amazon Prime Video   Showrunner  Jeff Pinkner</p>
<p>Fringe may draw frequent comparisons to The X-Files, but Fringe is a different animal that engages deeply with the supernatural world. Though it stuck to the tried formulas of crime procedurals in the show&rsquo;s infancy, Fringe quickly abandoned that for season-long arcs that explored supernatural phenomena and accepted without question that they were real. A big leap comes in season 5, when a time jump catapults the team into the future, and the series loses its base in reality. However, that reality was only holding the show back, and Fringe needed to distinguish itself by becoming a more fantasy-driven show.</p>
<p>2 Community (2009 - 2015)
A slightly quirky sitcom that becomes the subversive masterpiece of the genre.</p>
<p>Community<br>
TV-PG</p>
<p>Release Date  September 17, 2009   Seasons  6   Writers  Dan Harmon   Network NBC   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , Netflix   Showrunner  Dan Harmon</p>
<p>Created by Dan Harmon, Community is a great sitcom that subverts genre expectations while still being hilarious and fun to rewatch over and over again. Though the series always leaned toward the weird in its plot points, it started committing to this strangeness and reveling in it by the second season. By the end of the series, several characters had left, including Troy (Donald Glover), Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Pierce (Chevy Chase), but it&rsquo;s a testament to how willing the show was to grow that these absences didn&rsquo;t make it lose momentum.
The series weathered a lot over its run and was frequently on the brink of cancelation or actually canceled. Harmon was fired for season 4 but brought back for season 5 after the critical failure of the previous season. Season 6 seemed out of the question until it was picked up by Yahoo! and then ended as a different but high-quality series. Looking to the future the Community movie has been confirmed and will likely bring back the best elements of the TV show.
Harmon was fired for season 4 but brought back for season 5 after the critical failure of the previous season.</p>
<p>1 Atlanta (2016 - 2022)
An experimental, and sometimes surrealist, take on life in Atlanta for the Black community.</p>
<p>Atlanta</p>
<p>Release Date  September 6, 2016   Seasons  4   Writers Donald Glover   Network FX   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , Disney+ , Netflix   Showrunner Donald Glover</p>
<p>Donald Glover is the genius behind Atlanta. As a star, producer, and writer on the show, it&rsquo;s safe to say that Atlanta wouldn&rsquo;t be what it is without him. The series is considered one of the greatest of the past decade because of its strongly written characters and the chances the creators take with style and form. In season 4, many episodes don&rsquo;t feature the main cast at all but are still relevant to the show&rsquo;s themes.
Season 1 focuses mainly on Earn&rsquo;s (Glover) journey to help his cousin Alfred &ldquo;Paper Boi&rdquo; (Brian Tyree Henry) break into the rap scene in Atlanta. However, from there, the show becomes far less concerned with telling a linear narrative and more interested in the side quests of individual characters and the strange aspects of their interactions with the world. Dealing with issues of race, class, and the impact of fame, Atlanta became so successful thanks to its ability to not capitulate to the format of other shows.</p>
