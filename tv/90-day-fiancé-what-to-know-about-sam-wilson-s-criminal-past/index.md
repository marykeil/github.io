## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Sam Wilson has told Citra about his drug past, but he&#39;s keeping his shocking arrest a secret from the Indonesian woman.




90 Day Fiancé star Sam Wilson is keeping a shocking secret from his wife-to-be Citra in season 10, and it involves his criminal past. Sam is a 30-year-old from Cameron, Missouri and Citra is 26, from Bogor in West Java. Indonesian woman Citra saw Sam on a dating app while casually using it to make friends, but was fascinated by his face and decided to message him about it. Sam and Citra began an online relationship even though they were very different. A year into the relationship, Sam told Citra that he had been addicted to opiates for almost eight years.




Citra didn’t mind that Sam had a drug past. A year later, Sam went to Indonesia to propose to Citra. She said yes, and they filed for her K-1 visa so she could come to America to marry him. Citra expected Sam to convert to Islam before their wedding. Her father, Herman, and her two sisters were going to join her in the U.S. to attend the wedding. Sam revealed that Citra’s father is a police officer, and his secret could potentially end their relationship. Dockworker Sam hoped he could be on his best behavior and make a good impression on Herman, especially given his recent arrest.

 Sam Became Addicted To Opiates At 15 Years Old 
          

Sam explained that being a dockworker was not his career of choice, but he had no other option because of his past. Sam got addicted to pain medicine when he was 12. He stayed addicted for quite a few years. He spoke about opiate addiction making him a “really cold, numb person.” He could never maintain relationships and was falling sick every other day, which made it difficult for him to stick to one job. Sam said he was in a “dirty, ugly world” but became clean at 22. “It’s been almost 10 years now,” Sam said before he admitted that he had relapsed a few times as well.






 Sam Was Arrested For Carrying Suboxone Without A Prescription 

 

In a preview shared by E! News, Sam revealed that at 22, he started seeing a doctor who gave him Suboxone which is “kind of like an opiate.” He said, “It keeps you from getting sick, going through withdrawals.” Sam was recently on a business trip with a co-worker when he was pulled over by the cops. They found his Suboxone, but it wasn’t in a prescription bottle. Sam got arrested. “The judge offered me a diversion program,” he added. It’s a program that one could do for several years. Sam was supposed to take tests to show he wasn’t on drugs and take drug classes.



 Sam Is Facing Jailtime (Citra Doesn&#39;t Know) 
          




Sam said he could avoid jail time as long as he did everything properly. However, Sam is facing jail time because he missed the deadline to file the diversion application. While Citra knows about Sam’s drug past, she doesn’t know that his missing the deadline for the diversion could mean jail time. Sam decided to wait until Citra came to the U.S. to tell her because he feared if he told her before, she wouldn’t even come. The preview for the next episode of 90 Day Fiancé showed Sam saying, “There’s something I kinda need to tell you.”

Sam told her that he would probably not be able to get the diversion. When Citra asked how it would affect them, Sam said he would have to go to court and hear what the prosecutor offers. The 90 Day Fiancé star wondered if he would be offered probation or jail time. A shocked Citra was filmed during an interview saying she wanted to go back to Indonesia.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
