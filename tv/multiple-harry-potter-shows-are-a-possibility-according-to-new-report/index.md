## Literature Review

A new report reveals that multiple shows based on Harry Potter are possible, shedding light on Warner Bros. Discovery’s high-profile adaptation.




Multiple shows based on Harry Potter are a possibility, according to a new report. It was announced in April 2023 that Warner Bros. Discovery would be developing a TV show adaptation based on Harry Potter for their Max streaming service, which would cover all seven books in the famous novel series. The project is still in its early stages, with no casting or plot details.




In a new report, Deadline stated that “Max is open to the possibility of developing more than one idea based on Harry Potter.” This comes as the outlet reports on the status of the Harry Potter television show, along with the fact that a group of writers are working on their pitches for the premise.


 What The Latest Harry Potter Update Could Mean 
          

In the overall update about the television show, Martha Hillier, Kathleen Jordan, Tom Moran, and Michael Lesslie are among the writers developing their ideas about a TV adaption. It&#39;s stressed that it&#39;s still early in the process and that it&#39;s possible more than one writer could end up working on the upcoming Max show. At this early stage, it&#39;s too early to say what the possible Harry Potter television spinoffs could look like, but intriguing possibilities emerge with a closer look at the past credits of the writers.




Hillier wrote and executive produced The Last Kingdom, a fantasy series for the BBC, alongside past work on British soaps like EastEnders and Holby City. Along with her experience in genre work, her past in soaps reveals an emphasis on developing compelling relationships with the core cast. Jordan worked on the cult favorite young adult dramedy Teenage Bounty Hunters for Netflix, while Lesslie wrote the recent hit movie The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. As for Moran, he&#39;s notably created the supernatural thriller The Devil&#39;s Hour.

                  10 Harry Potter Book Details That Can Massively Improve The Show Compared To The Movies   The Harry Potter movies are hard to beat, but there is a way for HBO&#39;s TV reboot to improve its chances — by treating J.K. Rowling&#39;s books as gospel.   

All four writers mentioned have worked on projects that align nicely with what the Harry Potter series likely hopes to accomplish. The main goal would be to get the initial adaptation off the ground and see which characters would be suitable for their own show. But at this early stage, the goal is to find the right creative voice to make their own take on the familiar world.
