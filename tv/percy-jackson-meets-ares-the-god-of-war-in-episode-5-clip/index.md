## Literature Review
Percy Jackson meets Ares, the god of war, in a new clip from episode 5 of the Disney&#43; television series adapting the beloved book series. 




Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 will feature the titular hero meeting Ares, the god of war. Season 1 of the Disney&#43; show is adapting The Lightning Thief, the first novel in the popular book series by Rick Riordan. Percy Jackson episode 5, &#34;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers,&#34; is the title of a chapter in The Lightning Thief when Ares is seen for the first time.




A new clip from TV Insider shows this scene being brought to life as Percy, Annabeth Chase, and Grover Underwood meet Ares. The god of war is played by Adam Copeland, known as Edge from WWE. Check out the clips (via Percy Jackson News) below:


 

The Percy Jackson season 1 clip finds Ares facing off with Percy and his friends at a diner, where he lays out his offer. Ares requires their help, though he isn&#39;t above threatening the young heroes to get them to agree.


 

The intimidating and no-nonsense Ares tasks Percy, Annabeth, and Grover with retrieving his shield from a nearby amusement park. In return, Ares will help them reach the Underworld, which is where they believe Zeus&#39; lightning bolt is, along with Percy&#39;s mother.





 Why Meeting Ares Is Important For Percy 
          

The introduction of Ares is not only important to Percy&#39;s quest, but is integral to expanding the universe and the ultimate villain of the series. Thanks to the slew of monsters they&#39;ve already encountered, the heroes have had multiple modes of transportation destroyed, have barely any money left, and are still far from reaching Los Angeles, which is where the entrance to the Underworld is located. While Ares is certainly rough around the edges, his offer gives the heroes their best opportunity to move forward with their quest despite their many setbacks.

Outside of Dionysus at Camp Half-Blood, Ares is the first god Percy has met since he learned he was a demigod. Percy knows how invested Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades are in the whereabouts of Zeus&#39; lightning bolt, but Ares&#39; involvement shows that other gods beyond the Big Three are invested in the outcome of the quest and are even willing to get directly involved. As for Ares&#39; aggressive personality, it sheds more light on Clarisse La Rue and the other children of Ares who antagonized Percy at Camp Half-Blood, and how difficult it could be to have Ares as their father.






Clarisse becomes an important recurring character throughout the series.




In terms of where the series is headed, Ares is the key to introducing the primary antagonist in Percy Jackson and the Olympians. His agenda is furthermore connected to what the Oracle prophesied about Percy being betrayed by someone he trusts. Following Dionysus and Lin-Manuel Miranda&#39;s Hermes, Ares is the latest god to make an appearance in the series and will pave the way for Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades to make their debuts, while also setting the endgame for season 1 and the entire series.
