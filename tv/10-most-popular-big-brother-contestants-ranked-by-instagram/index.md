## Literature Review
Only one contestant takes the cash prize on Big Brother. But when it comes to the social media game, some former housemates are the clear winners.




For CBS, Big Brother has been a long-lasting success spanning over the last two decades with no end in sight, allowing many players to become popular online. While inside the house, competing for the final cash prize, contestants are completely cut off from the outside world for three months. The newest installment, Big Brother 25, saw the houseguests without television, cell phones, and social media for a record-breaking 100 days.
Outside the house, many contestants are active on social media platforms like Instagram. Especially after their turns on Big Brother, the house guests can connect with their followers over social media and typically find themselves becoming influencers. Only one houseguest per season goes on to win the prize money, but when it comes to the social media game, some former housemates are the clear winners. With followers from Big Brotherand other reality TV series, some houseguests have larger followings than others.

Former professional football player Kaycee Clark made history as the first openly LGBTQ woman to win Big Brother. Kaycee&#39;s strategy of laying low and playing a good social game for the first half of the season paid off, as did her final two alliances with Tyler. She went on to win the season, along with the $500,000 prize, after a tight 4-5 vote from the jury.

Christmas Abbott is perhaps most remembered for competing on Big Brother season 19, despite breaking her foot in week two. Her injury took this former fitness model out of the game for all physical competitions, but she still managed to take third place. She returned for Big Brother: All-Stars in 2020, again falling short of a win but definitely proving herself in the competitions. After the show, Christmas focused on continuing to build her fitness empire. She is now married to Memphis Garrett, originally from BB 10, and a fellow house guest from Big Brother: All-Stars season 22.

Despite her long history with the show, Franzel has distanced herself from the franchise in recent years.

Frankie Grande made a big splash on Big Brother season 16 when he waited several weeks to reveal to other house guests that his sister was none other than rising pop star Ariana Grande.

Since then, Grande has gone on to have guest spots on several Nickelodeon shows and starred in a streaming revival of the musical Rock of Ages.
