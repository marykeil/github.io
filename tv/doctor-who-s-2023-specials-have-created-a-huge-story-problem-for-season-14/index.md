# Doctor Who s 2023 Specials Have Created A Huge Story Problem For Season 14


## SUMMARY 



  Doctor Who season 14 faces a story problem due to the many mysteries introduced in the 2023 specials.   The abundance of unresolved mysteries may lead to dissatisfying conclusions in season 14.   Connecting these mysteries or spreading them across multiple shows within the Whoniverse could be a solution.

## Literature Review
Doctor Who returned with a series of specials in late 2023, but these episodes have created a sizable story problem for season 14 to overcome.




Doctor Who season 14 faces a potentially insurmountable obstacle thanks to the specials that aired throughout late 2023. In celebration of Doctor Who&#39;s 60th anniversary, a trio of specials released across November and December 2023, which were then followed by &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; marking the return of Doctor Who&#39;s Christmas special tradition. These episodes also served as a relaunch for Doctor Who, now once again under the leadership of showrunner Russell T Davies and enjoying its widest international audience yet thanks to a streaming deal with Disney&#43;.




Naturally, then, Doctor Who&#39;s 60th anniversary and Christmas extravaganza functioned as a lead-in for Doctor Who season 14. Scheduled for spring 2024, Doctor Who will resume its typical weekly format with Ncuti Gatwa starring as the Fifteenth Doctor and Millie Gibson as new companion Ruby Sunday. Rather than simply paving the way for Gatwa&#39;s reign in the TARDIS to begin proper, however, the 2023 specials have created a story problem that could prove fatal for Doctor Who season 14&#39;s hopes of success.

                  Doctor Who Season 14 Cast Guide: Every New &amp; Returning Character   The cast of Doctor Who Season 14 is filled with popular actors and actresses to push this classic sci-fi drama into the next generation.    


 Doctor Who Season 14 Has Too Many Mysteries To Solve 
         

Thanks to Doctor Who&#39;s 2023 specials, season 14 now has far too many mysteries to resolve properly. Across just four episodes, RTD sowed the seeds for a vast number of upcoming stories, with at least six major mysteries left dangling. &#34;The Star Beast&#34; used the Meep&#39;s parting scene to set up an unknown villain called the Boss, and 2023&#39;s remaining episodes did nothing to develop that hint. Instead, Doctor Who dropped yet more cryptic teases in &#34;The Giggle.&#34; The Toymaker referred to a second unknown villain called the One Who Waits, while the Toymaker himself made an allusion to his &#34;legions,&#34; and the episode also raised questions over the red-nailed hand that picked up the Toymaker&#39;s golden tooth containing the Master.




The Boss, the One Who Waits, the Toymaker&#39;s legions, and the red-nailed hand had already provided Doctor Who with plenty of mysteries for season 14, but the Christmas special went further, answering none yet adding two more to the growing pile - Ruby Sunday&#39;s parentage and the identity of Mrs. Flood. Russell T Davies is no stranger to enigmatically foreshadowing larger stories - Doctor Who season 1 had Bad Wolf, season 3 had Saxon, etc. The onslaught of twists Doctor Who has laid foundations for, however, could potentially result in dissatisfying conclusions, with each major mystery demanding its own resolution while jostling for narrative real estate in season 14.



 Doctor Who&#39;s Mystery Overload Dampens Excitement For Season 14 
          

When executed correctly, ominous hints and subtle teases can build intrigue and enhance excitement by generating discussion. Bad Wolf and Saxon are not the only examples of Doctor Who using this tactic effectively - even the first mention of &#34;Timeless Child&#34; in Doctor Who season 11 proved fascinating at the time and sparked endless speculation. Russell teeing up one mystery after another in quick succession, however, has diminishing returns, and the TARDIS cloister bell is a great parallel to show why this is problematic. The bell is supposed to ring whenever the universe is facing imminent and extreme danger, but the more frequently Doctor Who uses it, the less drama it creates.




Similarly, the more story hints and mysterious plot points get teased for Doctor Who season 14, the less intrigue they create. The One Who Waits was a huge piece of Doctor Who setup in &#34;The Giggle,&#34; but the spotlight has been taken away by discussion over who Mrs. Flood could be. Likewise, focusing on the identity of Mrs. Flood becomes difficult after remembering Doctor Who still hasn&#39;t addressed Meep&#39;s boss, and so the cycle continues. Ultimately, none of the mysteries are having the impact they should be because attention is spread too thinly between them. And that&#39;s without even factoring in the many unanswered questions still remaining from the Timeless Child.



 How Doctor Who Can Successfully Pay Off Its Multiple Mystery Teases 
          

If Doctor Who plans to give each of the above teases its own individual answer and payoff, season 14 could easily descend into a messy splodge of exposition and confusion, but there is hope for optimism. Although each moment of setup appears separate at present, many of the clues could be connected. Mrs. Flood&#39;s identity, for example, could easily factor into Ruby Sunday&#39;s parentage - especially if the theory that Flood is a future version of Ruby proves accurate. Likewise, Meep&#39;s Boss and the One Who Waits could refer to the same villain, and might then involve the unseen figure picking up the Toymaker&#39;s tooth.




Another possible solution to Doctor Who&#39;s abundance of cryptic hints can be found within the franchise&#39;s wider Whoniverse. It is no secret that Doctor Who is expanding, with 2023&#39;s Tales of the TARDIS the first spinoff of the new era. The stories started in Doctor Who&#39;s 2023 specials are not necessarily intended for season 14 alone, and may instead be spread across multiple shows, easing the burden. If the rumored UNIT spinoff comes to fruition, it could focus on Meep&#39;s boss. David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor, meanwhile, could leave the safe confines of Donna&#39;s garden to uncover the One Who Waits.



Doctor Who returns in spring 2024 on BBC1 &amp; Disney&#43;.
