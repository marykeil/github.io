# The Last Kingdom Every Character Based On Real Life Figures


## SUMMARY 


 The Last Kingdom is based on Bernard Cornwell&#39;s Saxon Stories novel series and features engaging characters based on real historical figures. 
 While the show&#39;s characters are not always depicted accurately, it&#39;s worth examining the differences between the fictional characters and their historical counterparts. 
 Characters like King Alfred, Aethelflaed, Edward the Elder, Lady Aelswith, and Aethelstan have significant roles in shaping the unification of England and its history.

## Literature Review
The Last Kingdom is full of fascinating characters, and a fair amount of them are based on real historical figures from medieval England and beyond.




The Last Kingdom is full of engaging and memorable characters, many of whom are based on real historical figures. The Last Kingdom is based on Bernard Cornwell&#39;s Saxon Stories novel series, which follows the unification of England as a single kingdom through the eyes of its fictional protagonist, Uhtred of Bebbanburg (Alexander Dreymon). By the end of Seven Kings Must Die, the show&#39;s sequel film, a vast number of historical figures are introduced as characters.
While The Last Kingdom&#39;s talented cast portrays a number of interesting historical figures, they are not always depicted accurately. Cornwell&#39;s novel series provides passages containing general historical information about the events dramatized therein, but the show&#39;s story and historical figures are never properly explained. With that in mind, it&#39;s worth taking the time to examine the characters in The Last Kingdom who are based on real figures and consider the ways they are different from their historical counterparts.
            
 
 The Last Kingdom Season 5 Ending Explained 
The Last Kingdom season 5 finally paid off Uhtred&#39;s arc. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the series finale and how it sets up The Last Kingdom&#39;s sequel film.













 








 18  Alfred The Great, King Of The Anglo-Saxons (849-899 CE) 
Played by David Dawson


 







David Dawson&#39;s King Alfred is both one of The Last Kingdom&#39;s most important characters, and he is responsible for many of the most critical historical events depicted in The Last Kingdom. King Alfred the Great is remembered for the sweeping military and administrative reforms he brought to Wessex, as well as his success in repelling Viking invasions and expanding the territory controlled by Wessex. Alfred was coronated as the King of West Saxons in 871, reining under that title until taking the mantle of King of the Anglo-Saxons in 886, a title he held until his death in 899.





 17  Aethelflaed, Lady Of The Mercians (870-918 CE) 
Played by Millie Brady


 







Aethelflaed, Lady of the Mercians, played by Millie Brady in The Last Kingdom, was the eldest daughter of King Alfred the Great, and she is known for being one of the few women to hold power in her own right in medieval England. Aethelflaed was married to Lord Aethelred of Mercia, as is depicted in The Last Kingdom, and after Aethelred&#39;s death in 911, she became Lady of the Mercians. Aethelflaed expanded Mercia&#39;s defensive infrastructure and strengthened its alliance with Wessex, which was ruled by her younger brother, Edward the Elder.





 16  Edward The Elder, King Of The Anglo-Saxons (874-924 CE) 
Played by Timothy Innes


 







King Edward the Elder, depicted by Timothy Innes in The Last Kingdom, was the son of King Alfred the Great, immediately succeeding Alfred following his death in 899. While it is his son, Aethelstan, who is credited with founding the first Kingdom of England, Edward&#39;s contributions to the achievement were essential. By the time of Edward&#39;s death in 924, East Anglia and Mercia were firmly under the yoke of Wessex, leaving Northumbria as the only Anglo-Saxon kingdom under Nordic control. Edward isn&#39;t always The Last Kingdom&#39;s most likable character, but he was undoubtedly one of the most impactful kings in Anglo-Saxon history.





 15  Lady Aelswith (c. 852-902 CE) 
Played by Eliza Butterworth
        

Eliza Butterworth plays The Last Kingdom&#39;s Lady Aelswith, the wife of King Alfred and mother to Edward and Aethelflaed. The historical Lady Aelswith is commonly considered one of the most influential noblewomen in medieval English history. She was born to a powerful Mercian noble, Aethelred Mucel, and her marriage to Alfred was one of the earliest and most critical ties between Mercia and Wessex. She is thought to have had a notable influence on her husband, and she is remembered for her steadfast support of Christianity in England.





 14  Aethelstan, King Of The English (894-939 CE) 
Played by Harry Gilby


 







Harry Gilby&#39;s Aethelstan is probably the most revered historical figure depicted in The Last Kingdom. He is remembered for being the first king to unite all four of the English kingdoms under one banner, earning the title, King of the English. He is often celebrated for expanding the military, educational, and religious reforms begun by his grandfather, Alfred. Though The Last Kingdom takes some creative liberties in its depiction of Aethelstan, the sequel film, Seven Kings Must Die, succeeds in portraying the most crucial moment in his life, the Battle of Brunanburh, which brought all of England under his control.
            
 
 King Alfred: How Historically Accurate Is The Last Kingdom Character 
King Alfred is one of the main characters in The Last Kingdom and like many on the show, he is based on a real-life figure from English history.









 13  Aelfwynn, Second Lady Of The Mercians (c. 888 CE -Unknown) 
Played by Phia Saban
        

Aelfwynn, played by Phia Saban in The Last Kingdom, was the daughter of Aethelflaed and Aethelred, and she ruled Mercia for a few short months after her mother&#39;s death in 918. For that brief period, Aelfwynn was known as the Second Lady of the Mercians, but she was spirited away to Wessex later that year when her uncle, Edward the Elder, seized direct control of Mercia for himself. Though The Last Kingdom depicts Aelfwynn as the daughter of Aethelflaed and her Viking lover, Erik, no historical evidence exists to suggest she was anything but the true-born daughter of Aethelflaed and Aethelred.





 12  Aethelwold The Aethling (c. 869-902 CE) 
Played by Harry McEntire
        

Harry McEntire&#39;s Aethelwold is one of The Last Kingdom&#39;s most deplorable characters, but the historical figure he is based on lived a notably different life. First and foremost, The Last Kingdom depicts Aethelwold as a grown man at the time of his father, King Aethelred&#39;s, death in 871, but the real Aethelwold was an infant at the time, making it impossible for him to challenge his uncle Alfred&#39;s ascension to the throne of Wessex as he does in the show. However, Aethelwold did challenge Edward&#39;s claim two decades later, mounting an impressive rebellion that might have succeeded if not for Aethelwold&#39;s death in battle in 902.





 11  Aethelred, Lord Of The Mercians (Unknown-911 CE) 
Played by Toby Regbo
        

Aethelred, Lord of the Mercians, played by Toby Regbo in The Last Kingdom, is another detestable character from the show whose historical background tells a slightly different story than The Last Kingdom. Little is known of Aethelred&#39;s heritage or early life, but more extensive records of his life become available after his accession to the Mercian throne around 881. Aethelred is remembered for accepting the overlordship of King Alfred and marrying his daughter, Aethelflaed, to solidify their pact. He became chronically ill in the early 10th century, and it&#39;s commonly suggested that his wife ran Mercia for nearly a decade before his death in 911.





 10  Guthrum, King Of East Anglia (c. 835-889 CE) 
Played by Thomas W. Gabrielsson
        

Thomas W. Gabrielsson&#39;s Guthrum is one of the earliest antagonists in The Last Kingdom, and his portrayal in the show is one of the more accurate depictions of a historical figure. The real Guthrum was born in Denmark, and after failing to oust his uncle as King of Denmark, he joined forces with the Great Heathen Army in attacking the Anglo-Saxon lands in England. After his crushing defeat at the Battle of Edington in 878, Guthrum made a peace pact with Alfred that granted him control of East Anglia if he should agree to be baptized. He remained King of East Anglia until his death around 835 CE.
            
 
 10 The Last Kingdom Spinoffs We Still Want To See 
The Last Kingdom is over after five great seasons and a sequel film, but there are still 10 incredible spinoff ideas that deserve to happen.









 9  Guthred Hardacnutsson, King Of Northumbria (c. 844-895 CE) 
Played by Thure Lindhardt
        

The Last Kingdom&#39;s Guthred, King of Northumbria, depicted by Thure Lindhardt, is based on Guthred Hardacnutsson, who was King of Northrumbria from around 883 until his death in 895. It&#39;s also possible that he had both Danish and Anglo-Saxon blood, as is suggested in the show. Further, the supposed prophecy spoken by Saint Cuthbert to abbot Eadred, which is included in The Last Kingdom season 2, did indeed suggest that Guthred, son of Hardacnut, should be made King of Northumbria. As The Last Kingdom suggests, it seems likely that this prophecy was invented to lend Guthred divine legitimacy in his claim to power.





 8  Jarl Hastein (Unknown- c. 896) 
Played by Jeppe Beck Laursen
        

The Last Kingdom&#39;s Haesten, played by Jeppe Beck Laursen, is based on the infamous Viking Jarl and raider, Hastein. Little is known about Hastein&#39;s upbringing or his death, but the active period of his life was spent raiding across continental Europe and in England. He became one of the most successful Vikings of the 9th century, and was an old man by the time he disappeared from historical records around 896. Previously, he led a sizable army across England, raiding extensively before finally being cornered by Alfred and Aethelred, at which time his army disbanded, scattering across Britain.





 7  Constantine II, King Of Alba (c. 879-952 CE) 
Played by Rod Hallet
        

King Constantine II of Alba is depicted in The Last Kingdom by Rod Hallet. Constantine&#39;s involvement in the series follows historical events fairly closely, though his involvement in the story is mostly limited to his interactions with the English kingdoms to the south. Constantine II was the King of Alba from 900 until he abdicated the throne in 943, marking one of the longest reigns in Scottish history. He often allied with the English kingdoms to repel Viking invasions, but after King Aethelstan ravaged southern Alba unprovoked around 934, he joined several other kings in opposing Aethelstan at the fateful Battle of Brunanburh in 937.





 6  Ubba (Unknown-878 CE) 
Played by Rune Temte
        

Rune Temte&#39;s Ubba in The Last Kingdom is based on the historical Viking leader of the same name, who is closely tied to the Great Heathen Army led by Ivar the Boneless. Though it&#39;s often suggested that Ubba was a son of the semi-mythical Viking, Ragnar Lodbrok, these claims are somewhat dubious. Ubba is absent from the oldest and most reliable sources of information on Lodbrok, which suggests that their familial ties may have been invented years after the fact. Even so, Ubba was a fierce warrior and one of the most feared Vikings in English history.





 5  Odda, Ealdorman Of Devon (Unknown Date Of Birth And Death) 
Played by Simon Kunz
        

Odda, Ealdorman of Devon, is depicted in The Last Kingdom by Simon Kunz, and though little of the historical figure&#39;s early life or eventual death are known, his actions as a loyal bannerman to King Alfred the Great are well-documented. Odda is often remembered for the victory he won over Ubba in 878 at the Battle of Cynwit. This battle is dramatized in The Last Kingdom season 1 when Uhtred enters Ubba&#39;s camp, burning his fleet and slaying Ubba in single combat. Odda probably died within a few years of his victory at Cynwit, but the exact date of his death is unknown.





 4  Sitric Cáech, King Of Dublin &amp; King Of Northumbria (Unknown-927 CE) 
Played by Eysteinn Sigurðarson
        

Eysteinn Sigurðarson&#39;s Sigtryggr in The Last Kingdom is based on Sitric Cáech, a Viking leader who was King of Dublin from 917-920 and King of Northumbria from 921-927. Though Sigtryggr is based on Sitric, little of his story in The Last Kingdom reflects real historical events. Sitric was the King of Dublin for several years, but after losing power in Ireland, he set himself up as King of Northumbria until his death in 927. The Last Kingdom&#39;s Sigtryggr does come from Ireland to Northumbria, but he is not given the crowns that the historical figure wore in life.





 3  Aethelhelm, Ealdorman Of Wiltshire (Unknown-897 CE) 
Played by Adrian Schiller
        

Aethelhelm, portrayed in The Last Kingdom by Adrian Schiller, was an Ealdorman of Wiltshire who was likely the father of Edward the Elder&#39;s second wife, Aelfflaed. Very little is known of the historical figure, and though it cannot be ascertained with true certainty that he was the father of Edward&#39;s second wife, he is widely believed to be the most likely candidate. It&#39;s unlikely that the real Aethelhelm held the same level of authority and influence as the character in the show does, but again, little is known for certain about Aethelhelm&#39;s life.





 2  Aelfflaed, Lady Of Wessex (Unknown Dates Of Birth &amp; Death) 
Played by Amelia Clarkson
        

Amelia Clarkson&#39;s Aelflaed in The Last Kingdom is based on Edward the Elder&#39;s second wife, Aelfflaed. As in The Last Kingdom, Aelfflaed was eventually put aside so the King could marry Eadgifu, but the reasons for this are unknown. She is believed to have joined a monastery after Edward put her aside. Aelfflaed had several children with Edward, but for reasons unknown, she was never consecrated as Queen.





 1  Other Minor Characters Based On Historical Figures 
A handful of The Last Kingdom&#39;s other characters are based on historical figures, but they either play too minor of a role in the story or have too little in the way of historical records to warrant further discussion. A roundup of these characters along with the actor who portrays them can be found below.
 Abbot Eadred (David Schofield) 
 King Hywel Of Wales (Steffan Rhodri) 
 Osferth (Ewan Mitchell)
