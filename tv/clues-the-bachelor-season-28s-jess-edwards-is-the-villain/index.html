  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Jess Edwards is already establishing herself as the villain of The Bachelor season 28, due to her telling the other women that she received Joey&rsquo;s first kiss of the season.   Jess is willing to do whatever it takes to spend time with Joey, including interrupting another woman&rsquo;s conversation.   Jess has already embraced the infamous Bachelor Nation catchphrase, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to make friends,&rdquo; indicating that she is solely focused on her connection with Joey and disregards the feelings of her fellow contestants.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Bachelor season 28 contestant Jess Edwards has already ruffled some feathers. Here&rsquo;s why she might be the villain of Joey Graziadei&rsquo;s season.</p>
<p>The Bachelor season 28 starring leading man Joey Graziadei is underway, and Jess Edwards already seems to be the villain of the season. During The Bachelor season 28 premiere, Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro from Collegeville Pennsylvania who currently lives in Koloa, Hawaii, met the 32 women who potentially could be his wife. Jess, a 24-year-old executive assistant currently living in San Diego, California, arrived on a boat pulled by a car. Jess told Joey that she grew up in Tennessee, but currently lives in San Diego. Before that, she lived in Denver, Colorado for three and half years.</p>
<p>During The Bachelor season 28 premiere, Jess and Joey bonded during their conversation. They then shared Joey&rsquo;s first kiss of the season. Joey said in his confessional that he could see himself sharing a life with Jess, while she admitted in hers that she could already be falling in love with him. She said that she never felt like that in her life before, and declared that she just had her first kiss with her future husband. However, Jess appears to be the villain of the season for a few reasons.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Jess Kisses &amp; Tells</p>
<p>Immediately after Jess and Joey kissed, she returned to the other women and told them what happened. She then joked, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t come get me!&rdquo; Many of the women were upset by the news, and felt that Jess should&rsquo;ve kept it to herself. In her confessional, Taylor Wiens said that it was disrespectful, awkward, and uncomfortable. Madina Alam said that she didn&rsquo;t know how Jess didn&rsquo;t read the room and wondered what she was doing. She added, &ldquo;Like get this girl out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Jess&rsquo; confessional, she laughed that the other girls should &ldquo;go on home,&rdquo; and maybe they&rsquo;d get an invitation to her and Joey&rsquo;s wedding. Jess&rsquo; behavior was reminiscent of Brayden Bowers&rsquo; actions during Charity Lawson&rsquo;s Bachelorette premiere night. He also told some of the other men, including Charity&rsquo;s brother who was undercover as the bartender for the night, that he and Charity had kissed. In addition, like Jess, he believed that no one else had a chance with Charity because his connection was so strong.</p>
<p>Brayden never really recovered from his night one blunder as his relationships with the other men were very contentious, and Jess seems to be headed down that same path. Later, Jess acknowledged in her confessional that she probably already had a target on her back for telling the other women that she kissed Joey. However, she said that she didn&rsquo;t care. Jess even stated that if the first impression rose didn&rsquo;t go to her, she didn&rsquo;t know who it was going to (it went to Lea Cayanan). She then danced in the confessional singing, &ldquo;I am pumped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess Steals Time With Joey From Another Woman</p>
<p>Jess enjoyed her time with Joey so much that she wanted more. However, there were 32 Bachelor women on premiere night, and it was hard for him to speak to each woman once, never mind twice. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for women to interrupt each other, but they usually try not to if they&rsquo;ve already had their time. When Taylor had her one-on-one time with Joey, Jess tried to interrupt, but Taylor said no and asked for one more minute. Jess then stood off to the side, eavesdropping on their conversation. She clearly ruined Taylor&rsquo;s moment, who later said in her confessional that they didn&rsquo;t kiss because Jess was standing right there.</p>
<p>When Taylor walked away, Jess told her that she was sorry and wasn&rsquo;t trying to be &ldquo;that girl,&rdquo; but Taylor stormed right past her without saying anything. Jess said in her confessional that she was surprised that Taylor gave her the cold shoulder, but she wasn&rsquo;t there to make friends. Rather, she was there to have something with Joey and potentially be his wife. Jess told Joey that a lot of the women wanted to talk to him, but she wanted to talk to him more, and she wanted to prove that to him. In her confessional she said, &ldquo;I hated that I interrupted Taylor&rsquo;s time, but sometimes it just happens like that.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>              The Bachelor Season 28: Daisy Kent's Age, Job, Instagram &amp; More   The Bachelor season 28's Daisy Kent is one of the 32 women competing for leading man Joey Graziadei's heart. Here's what to know about her.   
</code></pre>
<p>Jess Has Confrontations With The Other Women</p>
<p>In her confessional, Taylor said that Jess&rsquo; &ldquo;audacity is crazy.&rdquo; She pointed out that her actions were very disrespectful not only to her, but to the other women who were waiting to talk to Joey. Jess and Taylor then had a conversation during which they argued about whether Jess was eavesdropping on their conversation or not. Jess asked Taylor why she was trying to make it seem like something it wasn&rsquo;t. She said that she was putting actions and words in her mouth that didn&rsquo;t happen. Taylor told Jess that she had to respect people. Jess playing the victim was typical villain behavior.</p>
<p>Jess said in her confessional that Joey was worth people feeling any kind of animosity, &ldquo;period, end of story.&rdquo; She then stated that if she could go back in time, she would probably do it again. Jess laughed as she told Taylor, &ldquo;It is what it is. It happened. I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the previews for the rest of the season, Jess was shown having a fiery confrontation with her fellow contestant, Maria Georgas. Maria asked, &ldquo;Who the hell are you to tell me that I can&rsquo;t have time with Joey?&rdquo; Jess then said, &ldquo;You need to grow up, b****.&rdquo; Jess then said in her confessional that she didn&rsquo;t see what Joey saw in Maria. Jess then cried saying, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo; It seems that Jess&rsquo; aggressive behavior with Joey will eventually catch up to her.</p>
<p>Jess Would’ve Kept Lea Cayanan’s Advantage</p>
<p>During The Bachelor season 28 premiere, Lea finally opened the envelope and read the card that she was given during Charity&rsquo;s &ldquo;After the Final Rose&rdquo; episode. Lea received an advantage that would&rsquo;ve allowed her to steal a one-on-one date from someone else at any time during the season before hometowns.</p>
<p>Lea didn&rsquo;t want the advantage because she thought that it would force Joey to go on a date with her, while also hurting the woman from whom she stole it. Therefore, she threw the card in the fire. Jess responded, &ldquo;That was really sweet. I would take it.&rdquo; This was just another example of how Jess would do whatever it takes to spend time with Joey, even if it meant stealing a one-on-one date from another woman.</p>
<pre><code>              The Bachelor Season 28: What’s In Lea Cayanan’s Envelope? (Spoilers)   Bachelor Nation has been waiting for months to find out what's in The Bachelor season 28's Lea Cayanan's envelope. Now the secret is out.   
</code></pre>
<p>Jess Literally Said She Didn’t Come Here To Make Friends</p>
<p>Jess has already spoken the infamous Bachelor Nation catchphrase, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to make friends.&rdquo; This is a classic line that many Bachelor Nation villains have uttered throughout the years. It&rsquo;s become the mantra for contestants who only care about the lead, and don&rsquo;t acknowledge the feelings of their fellow contestants. Although there is some truth to the fact that the women aren&rsquo;t there to make friends, they also don&rsquo;t have to be disrespectful to each other.</p>
<p>During Zach Shallcross&rsquo; Bachelor season, his contestants bonded and became close friends. The final three women, Ariel Frenkel, Gabi Elnicki, and Kaity Biggar were very supportive of each other. Jess should realize that she can build her connection with Joey, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be at the expense of the other women.</p>
<p>Jess has already established herself as the Bachelor season 28 villain. She had a strong connection with Joey, but she will most likely sabotage it by being too aggressive with him, as well as confrontational with the other women. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see if, as in past seasons, the other women warn Joey about Jess. Jess deserves to find happiness and love, but she has to work on how she goes about doing it. It&rsquo;s possible that Joey proposes to Jess in the end, and they&rsquo;re now engaged. However, this seems unlikely considering that Jess will probably be the villain throughout The Bachelor season 28.</p>
<p>The Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p>
