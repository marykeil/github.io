## Literature Review

Despite positive praise, Reacher season 2&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes audience score shows that the season has been underwhelming, compared to season 1.




Reacher season 2 has been somewhat underwhelming for audiences. Based on Lee Child&#39;s Jack Reacher books, Prime Video&#39;s latest hit follows the adventures of Reacher (Alan Ritchson) as he takes down criminal organizations and battles various enemies. Season 2 saw him team up with his old military friends to avenge a fallen ally, all the while being hunted themselves.




While Reacher season 2 had countless twists, it wasn&#39;t enough to completely satisfy its audience. Critics gave the season a 98 percent Tomatometer score on Rotten Tomatoes, but audiences were far less pleased. They gave the show an 80 percent score, which pales in comparison to the 91 percent score that the show earned for season 1.


 Why Reacher Season 2 Was Lower Rated 
          

Critics may have loved Reacher season 2 more, having ranked season 1 six points lower on the Tomatometer, but audiences felt much less love for the follow-up. 80 percent is still a respectable score, but it pales in comparison to the near-complete agreement that was season 1&#39;s ranking. While the action remains a core part of the show, a major reason for the decline in audience respect is the team dynamics.



Reacher season 2 was based on Bad Luck and Trouble, the eleventh Jack Reacher book.







Jack Reacher is somewhat of a loner, but he is forced to align himself with new teammates each season. The other members give him people to bounce ideas off of. This serves the dual purpose of forcing him to explain his thoughts and having people check his more antisocial behaviors. In season 1, the teammates were new to Reacher&#39;s methods. In season 2, the team instead are already familiar with his habits, leaving little room for exploration. It&#39;s a drastic change, which inevitably alienates some viewers.

                  Reacher Season 3 Book Has Been Chosen, Author Confirms Solo Jack Story   Reacher author Lee Child confirms that the book for season 3 has been chosen, revealing a solo story for Alan Ritchsonâ€™s titular character.   

Other complaints are that the fight scenes are less fluid and original. The flashbacks also take away from tension by drawing attention away from existing strife to repeatedly cut back to campfires and office scenes. Flashbacks are an important trope that developed Reacher&#39;s friendship with his old teammates, but it hurt the pacing severely. There are many elements contributing to Reacher season 2&#39;s diminished audience score, and Prime Video will need to consider changing them before developing season 3.
