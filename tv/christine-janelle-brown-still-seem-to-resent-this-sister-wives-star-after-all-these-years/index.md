## Literature Review
A Sister Wives star doesn’t have a strong bond with Christine and Janelle, despite sharing many similarities with them, including their ex-husband.




Meri Brown isn’t on the best terms with her Sister Wives co-stars Christine Brown and Janelle Brown, which is probably for the best. The Brown family matriarch has lived with her former partner, Kody Brown, and his other three wives for years. Despite that, she hasn’t been able to get the respect she deserves for being the first wife in the polygamous family. Kody’s other two exes Janelle and Christine seem to specifically dislike Meri a lot. During Sister Wives season 18, the two ladies have maintained their distance and haven’t supported Meri during her split with Kody. Janelle even tried erasing her family history with Meri by avoiding talking about how she was previously her sister-in-law.




Viewers have been curious to know why Janelle and Christine dislike Meri and don’t consider her one of their own, especially since she has been in same polygamous relationship with Kody. Recently, Redditor Mommy0246 discussed this topic, and most fans concluded that jealousy is probably the main cause Christine and Janelle haven’t befriended Meri.


 

A Reddit user wrote, “There is a lot of resentment from the years that Meri was the head wife.” The Redditor added that it was probably better for Meri to move on and live away from the entire family. Janelle and Christine don’t need Meri, and she doesn’t need them either.

 Christine, Janelle &amp; Meri&#39;s Sister Wives Dynamic Explained 
          

Kody’s wives have had a strange dynamic from the get-go. Christine wasn’t happy about Robyn when she joined the polygamous family. She wasn’t welcoming towards her, but Janelle and Meri seemed okay. In comparison, Robyn was friendly to all three sister wives but probably hid her real intentions. Like with Janelle and Christine, Meri and Robyn formed a bond over the years. However, neither of the two duos ever formed one strong group. After Kody dumped Meri, Robyn also didn’t seem very interested in Meri, which left her with zero supporters.

Fans are right to speculate that the likely reason for these differences is contempt and jealousy. Meri was the first Brown family matriarch and spent two extra decades with Christine and Janelle before Robyn came into the picture. Therefore, she may have utilized her seniority in the family to gain the upper hand on Janelle and Christine in the early years. Since Sister Wives began in 2010, it’s hard to tell if there’s some history between Meri and the other two wives that may have led them to never form a good friendship.




Some Brown family kids have opened up about their opinions of Meri, hinting that she may not be as nice as she is in front of the cameras. Janelle’s daughter Maddie Brown has previously alleged that Meri was abusive in the family. Christine’s son, Paedon, has also claimed that Meri was mean to the kids in the family. There may be some truth to these claims, as Meri could’ve been a strict aunt to the Brown family children. The Sister Wives star was the head matriarch of the family and might have been doing everything to keep Kody happy.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
