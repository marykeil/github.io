## Literature Review
One of the best recurring jokes in The Simpsons is the series of McBain movies referenced throughout the seasons, and here&#39;s all 8 of them explained.




The Simpsons manages to have a series of hidden action-packed movies woven throughout its seasons that star an action movie hero named McBain. The fictional McBain movies are designed to play off of action movie clichés and are filled with cheesy one-liners. There are ten films with the character in total, with two of them being spin-offs about McBain&#39;s female counterpart. In The Simpsons universe, McBain is played by an actor named Rainier Wolfcastle. Wolfcastle is not only the star of the McBain movies but also various other movies referenced throughout the show.
Wolfcastle is one of The Simpsons&#39; many characters based on real people. He is based on Arnold Schwarzenegger, the real-life actor known for his action work and former governor of California. Wolfcastle is from Austria, just like Schwarzenneger, and he looks nearly identical to the real-life actor. Wolfcastle even expressed an interest in politics, as seen by his candidacy for mayor in the recall election of Mayor Diamond Joe Quimby. The McBain movies, themselves, also seem to take inspiration from the Die Hard franchise and parody a number of their scenes. Despite The Simpsons having such a long run and so many ongoing jokes, the fictional McBain movies manage to stand out and are one of the most memorable parts of the show thus far.

 8  McBain 
        

The first film, McBain, is referenced eight different times in The Simpsons. In addition to introducing audiences to the main character, the first film is the one that was shown in the most detail. The inaugural time the film was talked about was in season 2, episode 12, &#34;The Way We Was&#34;, and it gave valuable information about the titular character who is a former policeman. In it, McBain exposes Senator Mendoza&#39;s drug cartel, gets kicked off the force, and seeks revenge after his partner and friend is killed.
Throughout the film, McBain faces assassination attempts, defies regulations, and eventually defeats Mendoza by tossing him off a skyscraper. The story concludes with McBain celebrating his victory with his female accomplice, McBabe. There ended up being two spinoff films about McBabe referenced throughout The Simpsons.





 7  McBain II: You Have The Right to Remain Dead 
        

McBain II: You Have the Right to Remain Dead was released in 1991 and follows McBain&#39;s story after killing Senator Mendoza and leaving the police force to become a transport plane pilot. After Mendoza&#39;s death, McBain now has the task of fighting Commie-Nazis. The film first appeared in season 2, episode 15, &#34;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&#34;.





 6  McBain III: The Incredible Shrinking McBain 
        

Little is known about the third film in the McBain series other than that is a parody of the films, The Incredible Shrinking Man and The Incredible Shrinking Woman. The storyline is not shown in great detail within The Simpsons, with audiences only learning about the film&#39;s existence through Bart&#39;s visit to Greta Wolfcastle&#39;s house. She showed Bart her room, which was filled with props from The Incredible Shrinking McBain. When Bart picks up a Q-tip, he says that it is the same one that McBain used to kill a character in the film. This mention of The Incredible Shrinking McBain happened in season 13, episode 11, &#34;The Bart Wants What It Wants&#34;.





 5  McBain IV: Let&#39;s Get Silly 
        

McBain: Let&#39;s Get Silly is a deviation from the genre of the previous films. This one has McBain performing stand-up comedy throughout the entirety, though he is not very good at his joke-telling. When audience members criticize him, he kills them with various weapons, including a machine gun and grenade. The film appeared in The Simpsons, season 6, episode 18, &#34;A Star Is Burns&#34;.
On The Simpsons, Jay Sherman reviews the movie on his show and had Wolfcastle on as a guest. Wolfcastle explains that the movie costs eighty million dollars to make, which prompts Sherman to disgustingly ask how he sleeps at night. Wolfcastle then responds, &#34;On top of a pile of money with many beautiful ladies&#34;, which has become one of the most iconic lines when it comes to the McBain subplot and gives a rarer glimpse into the personality of the actor behind McBain.





 4  McBain V: Fatal Discharge 
        

McBain: Fatal Discharge appears in The Simpsons, season 7, episode 19, &#34;A Fish Called Selma&#34; and sees McBain getting a new sidekick. The process of getting the actor for that on-screen sidekick was a bit unconventional, as a person named Troy was promised the role by his agent if he and his wife had a baby. Troy decided to turn down this offer, as he was against bringing a baby into a loveless marriage. Not much is seen of the finished product but seeing the behind-the-scenes drama was a memorable part of the fictional McBain franchise.





 3  McBane VI: Escape From Newark 
        

Very little is known about the plot details of McBain VI: Escape from Newark. Clips from the film did not play in The Simpsons, but audiences are aware of its existence because a poster for the film was seen in the lobby of Aztec Theater. This poster can be seen in season 11, episode 1, &#34;Beyond Blundersome&#34;, but it has McBain spelled as &#34;McBane&#34;. This misspelling could indicate that the film is not actually a part of the McBain franchise, but instead is a knock-off.





 2  McBain VII: The Final Chapter 
        

Like its predecessor, very little is known about McBain VII: The Final Chapter. It did seem like it was going to be the conclusion of the McBain franchise, given its name, but there ended up being another film that followed. There was no dedicated The Simpsons episode to this film, but it is referenced throughout the series.





 1  McBane VIII: The Droopening 
        

Similar to McBane VI: Escape From Newark, this film is known from an ad featured within The Simpsons universe. The Simpsons family was shown in promotional materials for the Daytona 500 in 2016, and in the background of one of them a billboard is shown. That billboard is for McBane VII: The Droopening. Given that the titular character&#39;s name is spelled wrong, it is impossible to tell if this is a legitimate addition to the franchise.
        


 The Simpsons 
The Simpsons is a long-running animated TV series created by Matt Groening that satirically follows a working-class family in the misfit city of Springfield. Homer, a bit of a schmoe who works at a nuclear power plant, is the provider for his family, while his wife, Marge, tries to keep sanity and reason in the house to the best of her ability. Bart is a born troublemaker, and Lisa is his super-intelligent sister who finds herself surrounded by people who can&#39;t understand her. Finally, Maggie is the mysterious baby who acts as a deus ex machina when the series calls for it. The show puts the family in several wild situations while constantly tackling socio-political and pop-culture topics set within their world, providing an often sharp critique of the subjects covered in each episode. This series first premiered in 1989 and has been a staple of Fox&#39;s programming schedule ever since.
 Release Date   December 17, 1989    Cast   Tress MacNeille , Julie Kavner , Harry Shearer , Pamela Hayden , Nancy Cartwright , Hank Azaria , Dan Castellaneta , Yeardley Smith    Genres   Animation , Comedy    Seasons   35
