## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner had an awkward moment during his Golden Wedding to Theresa Nist that wasn&#39;t televised and viewers didn&#39;t see.




The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist got married in a spectacular live television event that was truly beautiful, but there was one awkward moment during a commercial break that viewers at home didn&#39;t see. Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, and Theresa, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, got engaged during The Golden Bachelor season finale after a whirlwind romance on the show. They were married on January 4, 2024, during a ceremony that included all of their children and their spouses, as well as their grandchildren.




Now, EW reporter Kristen Baldwin, who attended the Golden Bachelor wedding, reveals that Gerry had an awkward moment during a commercial break that viewers didn&#39;t see. Viewers might have noticed that when Gerry walked down the aisle, some of the wedding guests were laughing, and Gerry was mouthing some words to them. This was because, right before filming began, Gerry did a practice walk to the altar so that production could estimate how much time it would take. However, it appeared to some of the wedding guests that he started walking too soon, and then had to do it again. When Gerry walked down the aisle for the second time, he mouthed the words, &#34;It&#39;s for real this time&#34; to his guests.

Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Gerry and Theresa had a beautiful love story that had at its core the theme of hope. When they met on premiere night, it was Theresa&#39;s 70th birthday, and Gerry gave her a cupcake to celebrate. They also shared some kisses. He then gave her his first one-on-one date, during which they bonded over the losses of their spouses, Toni and Billy. However, they both said that they had the hope that they&#39;d find love again. They then joyously danced with a flash mob to Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believin&#39;.&#34; Through their meaningful hometown and Fantasy Suite dates, their love continued to grow. Gerry later proposed to an ecstatic Theresa during the Golden Bachelor season finale.


 

The Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding was not only a celebration of Gerry and Theresa&#39;s great love for each other, but also a reunion for the cast. Kathy Swarts was a &#34;Gold Carpet&#34; correspondent, interviewing guests along with The Bachelorette season 20 star Charity Lawson. Susan Noles was the wedding officiant, while runner-up Leslie Fhima, Faith Martin, Ellen Goltzer, Sandra Mason, April Kirkwood, Nancy Hulkower, Edith Aguirre, Natascha Hardee, Patty James, Joan Vassos, and Anna Zalk attended the event as guests.




It&#39;s interesting to hear the behind-the-scenes stories from The Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding. Not everything that viewers see on television is what it appears to be. Gerry and Theresa obviously gave a lot to the fans by allowing their wedding to be filmed on live television. With their beautiful families serving as the wedding party and their good friend and Golden Bachelor fan favorite Susan officiating the ceremony, the wedding was a touching and inspiring event.
