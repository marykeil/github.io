## Literature Review

Sister Wives viewers are sure there hasn&#39;t been one episode since Robyn Brown married into the Brown household that she hasn&#39;t cried on camera.




Robyn Brown constantly cries on Sister Wives, and fans who are tired of her behavior want Kody Brown’s wife to start acknowledging the issues she’s created herself. Kody met Robyn for the first time when he was out on a date with his first wife, Meri Brown. Kody began romancing Robyn while one of his first three wives was pregnant. He dated Robyn for six months before their 2010 spiritual wedding. Robyn came under fire for supposedly ruining Kody’s functioning plural marriage. She was declared the catalyst for trouble in the Brown family household.




Kody and Robyn are now monogamous where she is now his only remaining wife and, as pointed out by Reddit user Hgyxnj, they are almost “done with the show” because of Robyn.


 

“I truly believe there hasn’t been one episode since she has married into the family where she doesn’t ‘cry,’” the fan added. They predict Robyn will keep doing it until Sister Wives ends. “There is no way someone ‘cries’ this much,” the fan wrote while adding a photo of Robyn crying on Sister Wives and calling herself “too weak” to prove their point. “Robin&#39;s such a brave little trouper, dealing with problems mostly of her own making,” wrote TepidIcedCoffee61.

 Robyn Brown&#39;s Sister Wives Behavior Explained 
          

“She’s addicted to the chaos of her own making and she’s mad that no one wants to play her stupid f***ing games anymore,” posted sofaking-amanda. “The problem/web that Robyn has created for herself in what for most would be a non-issue is astounding,” said WeeklyAwkward. Robyn seems to have developed a victim mentality in recent years. She has not been easy for the rest of the family to handle, but her emotions became an issue for the Brown family in Sister Wives season 18. Robyn has cried through nearly all her conversations on Sister Wives.

A few observant viewers even noticed the way Kody looked at Robyn while she wept sitting next to him. He seemed disgusted with her behavior, as if he was beginning to feel the ick. Kody may have even rolled his eyes at his wife as she shed her tears. Robyn’s dramatics were at an all-time high in Sister Wives season 18. However, at the same time, she might have made it a habit to look weak and vulnerable while expecting Kody to wipe away her tears and play her protector. Robyn didn’t expect she’d be in a monogamous relationship with Kody when she married him.




Robyn had a hard time dealing with Kody as his wives started leaving him one after the other, leaving only herself behind to handle him. Robyn has admitted that she feels like she’s disrespecting her former sister wives by being happy with Kody. She hasn’t received the blessing of his exes. Robyn has been yearning for the three women to tell her it’s going to be okay as they enter the next phase of their life together. It’s high time that Robyn stopped crying and confronted the things that are ailing her. The Sister Wives star needs to understand she’s not the only victim of the entire situation.
