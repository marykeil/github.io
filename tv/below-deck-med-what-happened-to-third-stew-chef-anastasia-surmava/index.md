## Literature Review
Anastasia Surmava appeared on season 4 of Below Deck Mediterranean as the third stew and chef. She now has a new career and is back in her hometown.





During her time on the Bravo series, Anastasia became very close with chief stew Hannah Ferrier and second stew Aesha Scott. Together, the three ladies became the dream team. Not only did all three of them get along, but they all contributed something to their interior team. Hannah was sad to lose Anastasia after she became the chef, but she was excited to see Chef Mila Kolomeitseva finally get fired.





 Anastasia Relocated To Vermont After Below Deck Med 
          

According to a podcast episode of Dear Diary, You&#39;re Effed! with Hannah Ferrier, Anastasia relocated to Burlington, Vermont, her hometown. She told the former chief stew in June 2021 that she recently moved back home and was starting a new career, but she did not disclose the company or her new role. Besides her new career, she also started a new business with Hannah called the Ocean International Training Academy. The program provides courses to help those interested in a career in the yachting industry.



 Anastasia Got Married And Had A Daughter After Below Deck Med 

 

In July 2022, Anastasia married South Africa-based model Will Higginson. The pair likely met in January 2021, as Anastasia was in Cape Town hanging out with Georgia Grobler from Below Deck Sailing Yacht. In March 2023, Anastasia and Will welcomed a baby girl, Arabella Higginson, to the world. The couple keeps their social media updated with adorable photos of her development and their life as a family. Anastasia noted the difficulty of Arabella&#39;s birth in her first post, saying, &#34;I am in absolute awe of my body, my mind, and my supportive family. Her birth was THE most difficult thing I have ever done. I never knew such strength existed deep inside of me, inside of every woman.&#34;




Anastasia has been quite busy since she last appeared on Below Deck Med. She is now married with a daughter, has a new career, and built a business with one of her good friends. Despite a challenging birth experience, Arabella has significantly enriched Anastasia and Will&#39;s lives. While it would be great to see Anastasia return to Below Deck Mediterranean, she&#39;s accomplishing great things in her personal and professional life without the hit Bravo series.
