## Literature Review
Better Call Saul was as tragic as Breaking Bad, if not more, and the two characters who suffered the most were arguably Chuck and Howard.



This article contains multiple references to mental health and suicide.  



Better Call Saul centers around the exploits of unscrupulous strip mall lawyer Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill and how his actions lead to tragic moments in the lives of characters like Chuck McGill and Howard Hamlin. Throughout the series, audiences are reacquainted with Breaking Bad characters as well as meeting new ones. Chiefly among the new characters are Jimmy&#39;s older brother, Chuck McGill, and fellow lawyer/antagonist, Howard Hamlin. Rife with the same degree of nuance as Breaking Bad, Chuck and Hamlin share a common theme of tragedy, as their lives are wrought with despair despite their portrayals as mostly good people. Additionally, Jimmy&#39;s presence as a prominent source of their tragedy further binds their fates together.


On one hand, Chuck&#39;s relationship with Jimmy as his older brother makes it difficult for him to completely cut Jimmy out of his life, despite the impact his criminal ways have on his mental health. Additionally, Howard&#39;s status as Jimmy&#39;s superior initially means the two have to suffer each other in some capacity. However, as Jimmy&#39;s mischievous ways worsen, the effects of his actions on those around him also worsen, thus resulting in Jimmy&#39;s antics gradually creating bigger issues for characters beyond Chuck and Howard. From the beginning moments to its final moments, viewers aretreated to the gradual character assassination of both Chuck and Howard throughout Better Call Saul.
            


 Breaking Bad Timeline: When The Shows &amp; Movie All Take Place 
The Breaking Bad franchise consists of two shows and a movie. Here&#39;s a breakdown of the timeline for all, including Better Call Saul and El Camino.



 10  Chuck&#39;s Condition Is Psychosomatic 
Chuck struggles with his mental health throughout Better Call Saul
        

Although Chuck wasn&#39;t supposed to be a villain in Better Call Saul, the decision to make him one of Jimmy&#39;s greatest forces of antagonism paid dividends, since he was capable of affecting Jimmy on a deep, emotional level. Nevertheless, Chuck&#39;s mistreatment of Jimmy didn&#39;t deter Jimmy from looking after him as seen throughout Better Call Saul&#39;s earlier moments, thus exposing audiences to Chuck&#39;s acute case of agoraphobia, that is, Chuck&#39;s condition in which he doesn&#39;t feel comfortable leaving his house, and his hypersensitivity to electronics that forces Chuck to live a very simple, hermit-like lifestyle. While it endears audiences to Chuck early on, Jimmy questions the authenticity of his condition.
Despite Jimmy&#39;s belief that Chuck&#39;s conditions are psychosomatic, he goes along with it because it helps keep the brothers together despite their checkered history. While Jimmy&#39;s selflessness is honorable, Chuck never really shows genuine appreciation for Jimmy&#39;s efforts, thus making many of their interactions awkward. Furthermore, Chuck&#39;s insistence that his condition is legitimate further drives a wedge between himself and other people as well as keeping the ones who want to help him away. In the season 3 episode, &#34;Chicanery,&#34; Jimmy and Huell hatch a plot to expose Chuck&#39;s delusions about his condition, thus leading to a full-blown meltdown in a small courtroom in front of their family and peers.



 9  Howard&#39;s Dwindling Marriage 
Howard&#39;s failing marriage is one of the many things he&#39;s internalizing
        

In the season 6 episode, &#34;Axe and Grind,&#34; Howard Hamlin&#39;s marriage with his wife Cheryl isn&#39;t in a good place despite the chipper veneer Howard wears around his colleagues and peers. While Better Call Saul doesn&#39;t get into the marriage&#39;s finer details, it adds another layer of tragedy to Howard&#39;s life, as he&#39;s already undergoing therapy to improve himself yet is still afflicted by a plethora of hardships - many of which are directly related to Jimmy and Kim. However, despite the issues in their marriage, Cheryl is seen defending Howard&#39;s damaged reputation in the episode &#34;Waterworks,&#34; thus displaying that their issues weren&#39;t greater than her love for Howard.



 8  Chuck&#39;s Pride Ruins His Relationships 
Chuck&#39;s poor relationship with his wife and Jimmy is a direct result of his bruised ego
        

Chuck&#39;s inability to swallow his pride and accept other people and even undesirable situations for what they are holds him back. Chuck&#39;s insistence on always being right in any verbal conflict and the condescending tone he speaks to people in shows his pride early on, and his mistreatment of Jimmy and Ernesto reinforces it. However, the second season episode &#34;Rebecca&#34; shows audiences that Chuck was once married to a woman named Rebecca Bois, who appreciated Jimmy&#39;s quirks despite Chuck&#39;s disapproval. While it&#39;s unclear why Rebecca left Chuck, it&#39;s strongly implied his bruised ego over Jimmy making her laugh had a lot to do with it.



 7  Howard Enduring The Blame For Chuck Stunting His Career 
Jimmy holds a grudge against Howard after Chuck&#39;s death




Arguably one of Howard&#39;s most tragic qualities is the fact that he&#39;s a solid guy despite the negative light Jimmy paints him in. While he initially comes across as an austere and humorless man, it&#39;s later revealed that Howard maintains this facade because he believes it will bring out the best in his subordinates, thus contributing positively to his firm, HHM. However, because Howard refuses to offer Jimmy an entry-level lawyer position at the prestigious HHM as seen in the season 1 episode, RICO, Jimmy develops a lifelong hatred of the esteemed lawyer. However, audiences eventually learn that Chuck was the one responsible for stunting Jimmy&#39;s career growth.
What makes the reveal even more tragic for Howard is the fact that he endures the brunt of Jimmy&#39;s misdirected hatred without ever revealing Chuck&#39;s responsibility in the matter. What&#39;s worse, is that even after Chuck confesses to his role in Jimmy&#39;s inability to get started at HHM, Jimmy still goes out of his way to ruin Howard&#39;s life. Nevertheless, Howard speaks with his therapist regularly and takes up boxing classes as a healthier means of managing his stress. While Howard&#39;s death in Better Call Saul season 6 is tragic, the lengths he went through to maintain order and decency with the people responsible for his murder make things much worse.




 6  Chuck Jealousy Over Jimmy Being Their Mother&#39;s Favorite Child 
This is arguably the reason why Chuck&#39;s relationship with Jimmy sours
        

Although Chuck never outright vocalizes things, his obvious jealousy over Jimmy&#39;s success highlights one of the greatest sources of conflict in the siblings&#39; relationship. While Jimmy&#39;s conning ways as Slippin&#39; Jimmy and his morally bankrupt Saul Goodman persona&#39;s misuse of the law are justifiable reasons for Chuck to view Jimmy in a less-than-favorable light, it doesn&#39;t justify him going the extra mile to prevent Jimmy from redeeming himself. As revealed in &#34;RICO,&#34; Chuck refers to Jimmy, with a legitimate legal degree, as a &#34;Chimp with a machine gun,&#34; thus highlighting his inability to believe Jimmy can make a positive change.
A flashback to the season 3 finale, &#34;Lantern,&#34; shows a time in which Chuck and Jimmy had a better relationship in their youth, thus highlighting the tragic nature of their relationship as adults. Jimmy&#39;s ability to leave a significantly more positive impression on the women in the McGill&#39;s lives also contributes to the deterioration of their relationship. The season five finale, &#34;Klick,&#34; shows viewers that, despite Chuck arriving on time to see their mother on her deathbed, her final words are Jimmy&#39;s name. This results in Chuck withholding this from Jimmy when he does arrive, and it serves as one of the earliest blows to Chuck&#39;s ego.




 5  Howard Losing The Respect Of His Peers 
Jimmy and Kim&#39;s plan causes Howard to fall out of favor with his peers
        

Despite the obstacles that Jimmy and Kim put in Howard&#39;s life, one of the last things he has going for himself is his relationship with his colleagues and peers as seen throughout the series. From fellow attorneys and partners at HHM to the top brass at the equally prestigious Davis &amp; Main, Howard consistently brokers peace within the legal community and maintains a favorable relationship with just about everyone. However, Jimmy and Kim&#39;s sex worker setup and planting drugs in his country club locker room does irreparable damage to his reputation, thus reducing Howard&#39;s legacy from a shining example of a lawyer to an addict after his death.



 4  Chuck Bailed Jimmy Out Of Jail In The 90s 
A flashback shows that Chuck agreed to help Jimmy if he promised to clean up his act
        

A flashback in the season 1 episode, &#34;Nacho,&#34; reveals that Chuck put his reputation on the line by bailing Jimmy out of jail after he defecated through the sunroof of someone&#39;s car in the early 90s. Despite the flashback&#39;s humorous tone, it underlines an underrated quality that Chuck once possessed, his ability to believe Jimmy could change for the better. Chuck only agrees to bail Jimmy out after he swears he&#39;ll improve himself, and he agrees to take a job in HHM&#39;s mail room. Although things don&#39;t work out, this brief moment makes Chuck and Jimmy&#39;s relationship more tragic because it implies what kind of relationship they could have had.



 3  Howard Was Willing To Forgive Jimmy And Kim 
Despite Jimmy and Kim&#39;s antics, Howard still saw their potential and was willing to forgive them
        

Howard&#39;s character shines through as seen in the season 6 episode, &#34;Point and Shoot,&#34; when he offers scathing yet truthful words to Jimmy and Kim. After addressing the couple&#39;s shenanigans like throwing bowling balls at his car and hiring sex workers to appear at his business lunches, Howard reveals that he doesn&#39;t hold any grudges because he will overcome those issues the same way he&#39;s overcome debt and the complications in his marriage. Although he meets his untimely demise shortly afterward, Howard&#39;s ability to still view Kim as someone with potential recontextualizes him from a misinterpreted villain to a tragic hero.



 2  Chuck&#39;s Mental Breakdown Leads To Him Taking His Own Life 
Chuck&#39;s ending is very tragic



Chuck&#39;s suicide in the season three finale, &#34;Lantern,&#34; highlights two major elements in Better Call Saul, the lengths Chuck is willing to go to to prove his point, and the impact Jimmy&#39;s recklessness has on virtually anybody he interacts with. From the beginning, Chuck consistently belittles Jimmy and goes out of his way to prevent him from becoming a legitimate lawyer, largely because he doesn&#39;t believe Jimmy should hold such a distinction. Combined with his worsening mental health as a result of his psychosomatic relationship with his hypersensitivity to electronics, viewers witness Chuck grow increasingly more agitated in his efforts to expose Jimmy, while gradually spiraling out of control.
As Chuck&#39;s mental health worsens, he becomes less subdued in his interactions with those around him, with one of his most prominent examples centering around him telling Jimmy, &#34;The truth is, you&#39;ve never mattered all that much to me,&#34; thus serving as one of the quotes that perfectly sum up Chuck. After leaving Jimmy with those final words, he experiences a full-blown breakdown that sees him tear apart his house before ultimately deciding to take his own life. Chuck&#39;s suicide is easily his most tragic moment because of the events that culminate in him making the decision, and Jimmy&#39;s descent into Saul Goodman as a coping mechanism highlights its impact.



 1  Howard&#39;s Untimely And Unfortunate Demise 
Howard became a victim of right place, wrong time




While Howard deciding to give Jimmy and Kim a piece of his mind would be perfectly fine under normal circumstances, it proves to be fatal for the disgraced lawyer since the couple is involved with dangerous members of organized crime. Howard&#39;s death is one of Better Call Saul&#39;s most shocking and unfortunate events, but it also acts as one of the show&#39;s greatest displays in its common theme of the domino effect of one&#39;s careless actions. Throughout the entirety of Better Call Saul, Jimmy believes he can schmooze his way into and out of any situation with minimal repercussions.
However, Jimmy and Kim take things too far when they permanently damage Howard&#39;s reputation while also having relationships with cold-blooded killers. Lalo Salamanca&#39;s unexpected return on the same night Howard decides to scold Jimmy and Kim is one of the franchise&#39;s right place, wrong time moments, and his senseless murder perfectly highlights the tragedy of Howard. Even when Howard had every opportunity to take serious legal action against the couple, he deferred to civility, and as seen in &#34;Point and Shoot,&#34; he was willing to resolve things peacefully. However, Bette Call Saul emphasized the unfortunate nature of its most tragic character in the most unforgettable way.
