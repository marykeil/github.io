Amazon Studios&#39; Bosch: Legacy is entering into its third season, thus prompting discussions about which unique characters should return in season 3 in some capacity. Based on the Michael Connelly best-selling novels featuring LAPD detective Hieronymus &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch, Bosch: Legacy is Amazon Studios&#39; revival show that continues the legacy of the titular Bosch as he&#39;s now working as a private investigator for former enemy-turned ally, Honey &#34;Money&#34; Chandler. With Bosch: Legacy season 3 theories populating internet forums, there&#39;s a wealth of characters that the popular police procedural&#39;s third season could bring back to the small screen in Bosch: Legacy season 3.
Bosch: Legacy is renowned for its colorful cast of characters, each of whom stand out for reasons ranging from their speech patterns, chemistry with their fellow actors, interesting sub-plots, etc. Considering Connelly&#39;s novels go as far back as 1992, Bosch: Legacy season 3 can bring in characters ranging from the most obscure to the most popular. Although there are many characters from Bosch who made appearances in Bosch: Legacy, it remains to be seen just who exactly will make yet another return in the third season. From obvious choices to more subtle options, there are a good number of Bosch characters who should be in Bosch: Legacy&#39;s third season.
            
 
 Bosch: Legacy Season 3 - Renewal, Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know 
Bosch: Legacy has been renewed for season 3 following Harry Bosch&#39;s upcoming second spinoff season on Prime Freevee. Here&#39;s all the news so far.













 








 10  Maurice Bassi 
Stephen A. Chang plays tech genius Maurice
        

Introduced at the beginning of Bosch: Legacy, Maurice Bassi is a main character and the show&#39;s technical consultant who typically assists both Honey Chandler and Harry Bosch. Maurice is renowned for his playfully antagonistic role that he plays with Bosch, considering Bosch&#39;s misunderstanding and unwillingness to learn more about technology. This typically prompts Maurice to make a quip about the character, thus resulting in hilarious back-and-forth banter. However, despite their playful rivalry, Maurice and Bosch develop a mutual respect for one another after discovering their shared love of jazz music. Amiable and resourceful, Maurice can continue to be an asset in Bosch: Legacy&#39;s third season.





 9  Rico Perez 
Rico Perez is played by Anthony Gonzalez
        

Introduced to audiences in Bosch: Legacy&#39;s first season, Rico Perez is a fellow LAPD Police Officer who works alongside Bosch&#39;s daughter, Maddie, and their partner Paulina Calderon. Known for his big brother-like energy and resourcefulness out on the field, Rico acts in something of a mentorship capacity to Maddie, helping her quickly learn the ropes to becoming a successful police officer within a relatively brief amount of time. In addition to the two quickly getting along, their professional relationship eventually develops into a romantic one as the two grow closer. Rico&#39;s energy and chemistry justify his return in Bosch: Legacy season 3.





 8  Sgt. John &#34;Mank&#34; Mankiewics 
Scott Clace plays &#34;Mank&#34;
        

One of Bosch&#39;s older characters, Sgt. John &#34;Mank&#34; Mankiewics is a desk sergeant working for the LAPD, and he once worked closely with Bosch back in the day. Currently, Mank has taken it upon himself to look after his former partner&#39;s daughter, Maddie, as a show of good faith, since the two former partners got along incredibly well despite their differences in approach to doing their jobs. Having appeared in most of Bosch&#39;s episodes and nine of Bosch: Legacy, Mank&#39;s presence is sorely missed whenever he isn&#39;t onscreen, despite not being one of the central characters. Given his relationship with the Bosch&#39;s, he&#39;ll likely return for Bosch: Legacy season 3.





 7  Robert &#34;Crate&#34; Moore 
Gregory Scott Cummins plays the hilarious Crate Moore
        

Never seen without his partner Barrel Johnson, Robert &#34;Crate&#34; Moore is one half of the comedic duo prominently featured throughout Bosch and briefly appearing in Bosch: Legacy&#39;s first two seasons. Considering that Bosch and Bosch: Legacy are police procedurals, the subjects that both shows cover tend to veer off into the darker side of things, but Crate and Barrel help keep things light. Nevertheless, Crate and Barrel are competent lawmen as seen in the Bosch: Legacy episode, &#34;Horseshoes and Hand Grenades,&#34; when Bosch recruits them to conduct surveillance. Given their resourcefulness and humor, they should be in Bosch: Legacy&#39;s third season.





 6  Barrel Johnson 
Troy Evans plays the comedic Barrel Johnson
        

Also appearing prominently in Bosch is the older Barrel Johnson, an equally hilarious Investigator with the Los Angeles Police Department&#39;s Hollywood Division. Perpetually seen with his partner Crate, Barrel is just as intelligent as he is funny, often coming up with solutions to Bosch&#39;s problems despite his jovial personality. On account of assisting Bosch in the Bosch: Legacy episode &#34;Horseshoes and Hand Grenades,&#34; Bosch warns the duo to watch their backs as the FBI might investigate them. However, Crate and Barrel reveal that they&#39;re retired, thus reassuring Bosch. Despite their retirement, Crate and Barrel&#39;s return in some capacity would be a welcome addition to Bosch: Legacy season 3.
            
 
 Bosch: Legacy Season 2&#39;s Ending Tease Sets Up A Much Darker Season 3 
After Maddie&#39;s kidnapper is murdered in prison, Bosch: Legacy season 2&#39;s ending tease sets up a much darker season 3 for its titular character.









 5  Lt. Grace Billets 
Lt. Grace Billets is play by Amy Aquino
        

Lt. Grace Billets is the commanding officer of the LAPD Hollywood Division&#39;s detective bureau and has been since 1994. Known for her commanding presence and managerial style of running the bureau, Grace gets along with just about everyone and, despite its unorthodox nature, Grace&#39;s style goes hand-in-hand with leading her superiors to successfully solving cases. Another great aspect to Grace is her ability to mediate between the brash Bosch and her superiors, Captain LaValley and Assistant Chief Irvin Irving. Although there&#39;s been no mention of Grace in Bosch: Legacy season 1 or 2, there&#39;s hope she&#39;ll eventually return, as she was promoted to Captain in Bosch&#39;s seventh season.





 4  Jerry Edgar 
Jamie Hector plays Bosch&#39;s partner Jerry Edgar


 







Jerry Edgar is Bosch&#39;s partner, thus appearing in every episode of the original series in some capacity or another. Known for his good taste in suits, sarcastic delivery, and intense presence, Jerry is nearly the opposite of Bosch in many ways. Despite this, he&#39;s loyal and always ready to do what&#39;s necessary to help Bosch. Although he doesn&#39;t play a major role in the Bosch: Legacy episode, &#34;Chain of Authenticity,&#34; it set him up as a character who will once again help Bosch - this time with investigating Maddie&#39;s disappearance. Considering the nature of the stakes, Jerry will likely be in Bosch: Legacy season 3 in a more substantial role.





 3  Maddie Bosch 
Bosch&#39;s daughter Maddie is played by Madison Lintz
        

Maddie Bosch is Bosch&#39;s daughter and is seen growing from a teenager to a young woman throughout Bosch&#39;s seven seasons. By the events of Bosch: Legacy, Maddie is seen following in her father&#39;s footsteps as she is now a Los Angeles Police Department Police Officer learning the ropes. Despite getting off to a rocky start, Maddie gradually becomes more competent as a police officer thanks to Rico and Reina, even starting a romantic relationship with Rico in the process. Although season 2 of Bosch: Legacy ends on a cliffhanger, Maddie will be back in Bosch: Legacy season 3 as her character is essential to the story.





 2  Honey &#34;Money&#34; Chandler 
Mimi Rodgers plays Honey Chandler


 







Honey &#34;Money&#34; Chandler is a defense attorney who is introduced in Bosch&#39;s first season, thus appearing in every episode of the seven-season original series. Known for her austere and stern presence, Honey initially starts the series off as an antagonist to Bosch, since her profession dictates that she defend many people Bosch knows is guilty. However, after experiencing some of the corruption in the justice system firsthand, Honey reconsiders her stance on law and on Bosch. After Bosch retires, Honey hires him as a private investigator, thus seeing them continue a more friendly relationship. Appearing in every Bosch: Legacy episode, Honey will likely be in season 3 as well.





 1  Harry Bosch 
Bosch is played by Titus Welliver


 







Hieronymous &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch is the protagonist of the titular show and is an old-school LAPD Detective who plays by his own rules to solve crime, often to the ire of many of his colleagues and superiors. Despite his brash personality, Bosch proves time and again that he&#39;s an effective cop, thus it comes as a surprise when he retires from the LAPD in Bosch: Legacy and takes up work as a private investigator. Furthermore, he&#39;s conflicted about seeing his daughter follow in his footsteps, but he supports her nonetheless. With Maddie&#39;s kidnapping in Bosch: Legacy season 2, Bosch will no doubt return in the third season to find her.
