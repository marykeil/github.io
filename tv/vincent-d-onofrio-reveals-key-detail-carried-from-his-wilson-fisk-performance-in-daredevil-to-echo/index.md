Summary

  Vincent D&#39;Onofrio is reprising his role as Kingpin in the upcoming Echo show in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.   The show will retain the darker elements of the character from the original Daredevil series.   Kingpin&#39;s caring nature and complex layers make him a compelling and interesting villain in the MCU.  





Vincent D&#39;Onofrio shares what he is bringing over from Daredevil onto Echo as he returns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Kingpin. While Netflix may have ended the Daredevil TV show after three seasons, those characters are far from done in the MCU. 2024 will mark the return of both Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk as they both will be showing up in the Hawkeye spinoff show, Echo.




When Screen Rant recently interviewed D&#39;Onofrio about his gig on Echo, the MCU veteran reflected on his time during Daredevil before coming back to the MCU in Hawkeye and now Echo. Regardless of whether the audience had seen the original Daredevil series or not, D&#39;Onofrio stressed that Echo included a lot of the darker elements that followed the character during his Netflix run. For him, it was key that his caring for Maya is a huge quality that existed with Kingpin on Daredevil, sharing the following:


Vincent D’Onofrio: I realized that whether the audience had ever seen the original Daredevil or not, they&#39;re going to get that same feeling as they did in Daredevil when I first came on screen. They&#39;re going to feel uneasy about him, and I think Fisk works best in that kind of tone.
I wanted there to be an emotional life first. His connection to Maya. I wanted to remind people, if they had seen the original Daredevil, that he can care for people in a real way. And if they didn&#39;t see Daredevil before, that this character can care for people in a certain way. And so that was one important aspect because without that, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s as scary or as interesting.






 What Netflix&#39;s Daredevil Says About Kingpin&#39;s Echo Arc 
         

Something that is always crucial to remember about Kingpin in the MCU is that he wasn&#39;t born a villain but rather became one through his tragedy. Daredevil showed his complicated family life and how he eventually succumbed to the criminal world while still having the capacity to love and care for others — whether it be Wesley, Vanessa, or Maya. Wilson does a lot of bad things, but not because he wants to be evil for the sake of it.

That is one of the many reasons why Kingpin became an MCU fan favorite because there were complex layers to him rather than being a mustache-twirling antagonist. With Echo continuing this important character trait, it will not just be honoring the Daredevil audience but also likely pull in a new audience who will want to follow this character. Time will tell how they will also continue Wilson&#39;s further spiral into villainy, as there will be a reason why MCU heroes have to fight him in the future.






After Echo, Kingpin will next be seen in the Daredevil: Born Again TV show with Charlie Cox.




With only a week to go before Echo premieres, it will be exciting to see what the MCU is planning to do with Kingpin after his brief time in the final episodes of Hawkeye. Given the rich history that Kingpin has in the comics, there are still so many directions they can go with him in the MCU. Echo will also be crucial for Kingpin before he continues his saga through Daredevil: Born Again, which is currently being re-developed.



Marvel Studios&#39; Echo drops all five episodes on Tuesday, January 9 on Disney&#43; and Hulu at 6pm PT.
