  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>True Detective season 4&rsquo;s ep. 2 drops clues that not only connect it to its predecessors but also seem instrumental to solving its central mysteries.</p>
<p>Summary
The condition of the dead researchers, with burnt corneas and ruptured eardrums, suggests a killer&rsquo;s intricate ritual involving submersion in ice-cold water.
A surviving researcher, still alive when found, suggests they were frozen only a few hours before being discovered.
The researchers were trying to sequence the DNA of an extinct microorganism with potential groundbreaking medical implications.</p>
<p>Many questions remain unanswered in True Detective: Night Country, but season 4&rsquo;s episode 2 reveals several new clues that bring Navarro and Danvers closer to solving the overarching mystery. After featuring a gripping hook, where it highlighted how a group of scientists vanished in thin air from their research facility, True Detective season 4&rsquo;s episode 1 left viewers with more questions than answers surrounding what happened to the researchers. Although episode 2 does something similar, it progresses the plot in several intriguing directions that allow audiences to come up with theories.
Compared to episode 1, True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2 proves to be a lot less supernatural with its story explorations. However, it still presents a metaphysical undertone to its narrative by drawing some surprising references to season 1. In its closing moments, the episode also concludes with a shocking revelation surrounding the central murder mystery that changes everything Navarro and Danvers knew about the researchers at Tsalal.</p>
<p>Is True Detective: Night Country Based On A True Story?
True Detective: Night Country, season 4 of the HBO anthology series, revolves around the disappearance of eight men – is it inspired by real life?</p>
<p>10  The Researchers Have Burnt Corneas, Ruptured Eardrums, And No Clothes On
The dead researchers&rsquo; condition reveals a lot about what might have happened to them</p>
<p>As Danvers and Peter investigate the frozen bodies of the researchers, they notice several patterns: none of them have any clothes on, and their eyes and eardrums are severely damaged. Moments later, Navarro finds their neatly folded clothes lined up next to their footwear. These small details surrounding the researchers suggest that removing their clothes and stacking them up near the crime scene was a part of the killer&rsquo;s intricate ritual. The killer also likely submerged the researchers underwater, which would explain how their corneas got ice burnt.
The ruptured ear drums could have been from the killer immersing them too deep into the Alaskan waters, but the fact that their bodies were found on the surface suggests that the killer wanted them to be discovered by law enforcement. It also looks like the researchers were in a state of delirium because of extreme hypothermia, suggesting that the killer submerged them in ice-cold water and then pulled them out before waiting for them to freeze to death.</p>
<p>9  One Frozen Researcher Is Not Yet Dead
The surviving researcher could be a key puzzle piece in the overarching murder</p>
<p>While trying to get the researchers&rsquo; bodies out of the ice, one police officer accidentally snaps a researcher&rsquo;s arm. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the researcher starts screaming in pain, revealing that he is still alive. Although it remains unknown whether he will survive, Danvers talks to a nurse in True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2, who reveals that the researcher&rsquo;s foot is being amputated, and he is in an induced coma. The fact that the researcher was still alive suggests that, even though he and the other had been missing for days, they were frozen in ice only a few hours before the APF found their bodies.
Extreme cold can sometimes have a protective effect on the human body, which seems to be the case for the surviving researcher. However, the human body cannot withstand freezing temperatures for days, confirming that the researchers were frozen not too long before the APF found them. The fact that even their clothes were not buried under a layer of snow further reinstates this, making it hard not to wonder where they were and what they were doing before they were frozen to death.</p>
<p>True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s Supernatural Theories Get A Major Boost From This 65-Year-Old Mystery Case
True Detective: Night Country incorporates several supernatural elements in its plot. However, the series&rsquo; case has a surprising real-life inspiration</p>
<p>8  True Detective: Night Country Confirms Travis Is Rust&rsquo;s Father
True Detective season 4 confirms one major season 1 connection</p>
<p>In a brief scene from True: Detective Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2, Rose opens up to Navarro about her visions of Travis and even tries to explain why people in Ennis often see the dead. While talking about Travis and his last visit, Rose calls him Travis Cohle, confirming that he is Rust&rsquo;s father. True Detective season 1 mentions that Rust had a father named Travis who lived in Alaska. Considering how Rust, too, could seemingly see things beyond humanity&rsquo;s plane of consciousness, it makes sense that his father can bend the boundaries between the material and the supernatural world to contact Rose despite being dead.</p>
<p>7  The Researchers Were Trying To Make A Scientific Breakthrough
There is likely more to the researchers&rsquo; purpose than meets the eye</p>
<p>Danvers visits a geology teacher at Ennis&rsquo; local school to learn more about what the researchers wanted to achieve at Tsalal. Although Peter had previously told her that they were trying to discover the origin of life, her interaction with the geology teacher reveals that they wanted to sequence the DNA of an extinct microorganism that could prevent cellular decay. The teacher also mentions that their discovery could not only change everything humanity knew about medicine and healthcare but could potentially cure chronic autoimmune conditions and even cancer. However, he also cautiously adds that they were chasing an impossible goal.</p>
<p>6  The Researchers Have Spirals On Their Foreheads
More spirals appear in True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2</p>
<p>Rose also draws the spiral on the ice and claims that it might be older than the ice in Alaska, pointing towards the origins of the Yellow King/Hastur.</p>
<p>After discovering that the researchers have spiral symbols on their foreheads, Danvers wonders whether they drew them themselves or the killer drew them on their foreheads. If they drew them themselves, they must have drawn them before leaving the Tsalal facility because they could not have possibly drawn the spirals after being affected by hypothermia. If the killer drew them on their foreheads, it seems likely that he has connections with True Detective season 1&rsquo;s Yellow King cult and drawing spirals on his victims before killing them was a part of his meticulous ritual.
In another scene, Rose asks Navarro if she noticed the spirals on the researchers&rsquo; foreheads, and Navarro claims that she has seen the spirals before. Rose also draws the spiral on the ice and claims that it might be older than the ice in Alaska, pointing towards the origins of the Yellow King/Hastur. These subtle clues hint that True Detective: Night Country will delve deeper into the supernatural underpinning introduced in season 1.</p>
<p>True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s Opening Quote Is A Major Hint Its Repeating Season 1&rsquo;s Mystery
True Detective: Night Country is already establishing a connection with season 1 of the hit anthology series. It&rsquo;s opening quote is a major link.</p>
<p>5  Tsalal Connects To True Detective Season 1&rsquo;s Tuttle Family
True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2 reveals a major Tuttle connection</p>
<p>Peter briefly talks about Tsalal in True Detective season 4&rsquo;s episode 2 and mentions that the facility is funded by an NGO. He goes on to add that when he followed the tax records of the NGO that funds Tsalal, he discovered that the NGO was linked to a shell company called NC Global Strategies, which was owned by Tuttle United. In True Detective season 1, the Tuttle family was revealed to be the leading force behind the Yellow King cult. The appearance of the spiral symbols in True Detective: Night Country and the mention of Tuttle United seems to suggest that the Yellow King cult has its roots spread across Ennis as well.</p>
<p>4  True Detective: Night Country Reveals Why Danvers Hates The Beatles &ldquo;Twist And Shout&rdquo;
Danvers&rsquo; flashback in True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode reveals a tragic detail about her past</p>
<p>In all of its revelations surrounding the central murder case, True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2 also drops a flashback that reveals how Danvers would often listen to &ldquo;Twist and Shout&rdquo; while playing with her son. Although the show has not yet revealed what happened to her son, several clues in episode 1 suggest that he died in a car accident. The Beatles&rsquo; &ldquo;Twist and Shout&rdquo; reminds Danvers of her late son, explaining why she rushes inside the Tsalal research facility in episode 1&rsquo;s opening moments to turn off the stereo when she hears it playing.</p>
<p>Every Song In True Detective: Night Country &amp; When They Play
True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s soundtrack has several atmospheric songs that effectively channel the brooding and mysterious ambiance of the show.</p>
<p>3  Ted Corsaro Threatens Danvers To Drop The Researchers&rsquo; Case
True Detective: Night Country&rsquo;s episode 2 seemingly draws parallels between Ted and a season 1 character</p>
<p>After an initial confrontation, where the regional Chief of Police, Ted Corsaro, asks Danvers to let higher authorities handle the researchers&rsquo; case, Danvers sleeps with Corsaro. Their interaction discloses that they have had a secretive affair for nearly two decades. However, things suddenly go south between the two when Ted threatens Danvers to let go of the case. This could mean that, like Sheriff Steve Geraci from True Detective season 1, Ted is following a chain of command that links up to the Tuttles, who are trying to shroud their sinister connections to the crimes in Ennis just like they tried to cover up their involvement in the Carcosa murders.</p>
<p>2  Clark Got The Same Spiral Tattoo As Annie Four Days After Her Death
True Detective season 4&rsquo;s episode 2 discloses some shocking details about Annie K and Clark</p>
<p>Clark might have indirectly been responsible for Annie&rsquo;s death, and his guilt for killing her gradually manifested in disturbing ways.</p>
<p>When Danvers traces the studio where Clark got his spiral tattoo, she acquires a picture that reveals how Annie, too, had the same tattoo on her back and was also secretly in a relationship with Clark. The date of Clark&rsquo;s tattoo reveals that he got it four days after Annie&rsquo;s death, and the tattoo artist who made his tattoo says that he cried after getting the spiral inked on his chest. This connection between Clark and Annie does not confirm whether Clark killed Annie, but it highlights how they were likely up to something evil before Annie died.
Clark&rsquo;s research notes also reveal that he was growing increasingly paranoid after Annie&rsquo;s death and would often feel her presence. He even dreamed of her, which seemingly prevented him from sleeping and further drove him to the brink of insanity. Peter learns that Clark would also often mumble to himself in the research facility and walk around naked while the rest of the researchers kept ignoring him. This could mean that Clark might have indirectly been responsible for Annie&rsquo;s death, and his guilt for killing her gradually manifested in disturbing ways.</p>
<p>1  Clark Was Obssessed With Spirals And Straw Dolls
Clark&rsquo;s van reveals several True Detective season 1 and season 3 connections</p>
<p>Navarro deduces that Clark and Annie secretly lived in a van to ensure no one learned about their relationship. When she and Danvers visit his van, they find a giant spiral on the van&rsquo;s ceiling, right above Clark&rsquo;s bed. They also discover a human sized straw doll on Clark&rsquo;s bed, with several tiny straw dolls hanging down the van&rsquo;s roof. The straw dolls seemingly connect to True Detective season 3. In season 3&rsquo;s 1980 timeline, Hays finds similar straw dolls near Will Purcell’s body. Later, in 2015, True Detective season 3&rsquo;s Montgomery theorizes that &ldquo;the straw dolls are a sign of pedophile groups — like the crooked spiral.&rdquo;
