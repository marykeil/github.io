## Literature Review
Max confirms a season 2 renewal for Bookie, the new comedy that is executive produced and co-created by Big Bang Theory creator Chuck Lorre.




Bookie, the new comedy which is executive produced by Big Bang Theory creator Chuck Lorre, has been renewed for season 2. Consisting of eight episodes and premiering on the Max streaming service in November 2023, Bookie focuses on an embattled veteran bookie. The show garnered headlines since it showcased the reunion between Lorre and Charlie Sheen after the two had a very public falling out during Two and a Half Men. Sheen plays a fictionalized version of himself, recurring as one of the demanding clients that the main character has to deal with.




Max has now confirmed Bookie season 2, just weeks after its December 21 finale. In a statement, co-creators Lorre and Nick Bakay expressed their excitement for the show&#39;s future and made a sly reference to the high-stakes comedy:


“We couldn’t be more excited that Max listened to their gut, paid the juice, and let it ride on season two of Bookie.”



 What To Know About Bookie 
          

Bookie is described as a darkly funny comedy, centering on veteran Los Angeles bookie Danny (Sebastian Maniscalco). The potential legalization of sports gambling in California threatens to upend Danny&#39;s business for good. Alongside best friend and former NFL player Ray (Omar J. Dorsey), his side-hustling sister Lorraine (Vanessa Ferlito), and the reformed drug dealer Hector (Jorge Garcia), Danny has to contend with increasingly unstable clients like Sheen&#39;s character.




In particular, Danny has to juggle this while he does his best to settle their debts. To make matters even more complicated, Danny is making some risky bets of his own. On the whole, the Max show chronicles Danny&#39;s journey to adapt to an ever-changing world. His charm and readiness will have to help him con his way to the top.

Bookie, which also stars Andrea Anders and Maxim Swinton, is created, written, and produced by Lorre and Bakay. The latter&#39;s television credits include the comedies Young Sheldon, Mom (both produced by Lorre), and The King of Queens. On the big screen, Bakay wrote the screenplay for Paul Blart: Mall Cop and its sequel. With its renewal, the comedy extends Lorre&#39;s relationship with the Max streaming service. That may also include the upcoming Big Bang Theory spinoff.



All episodes of Bookie season 1 are now on Max.
