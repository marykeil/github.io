## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Jasmine doesn&#39;t want to marry Gino after his bachelor party scandal. She may have already found a potential new partner.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is declaring her love for one of her fellow cast member and is even ready to marry them, according to her new update. Jasmine and Gino Palazzolo have become one of the franchise&#39;s best-known faces since 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. It&#39;s hard to become a memorable couple with so many new faces being introduced every year, but Jasmine and Gino&#39;s storyline has hooked viewers in. Jasmine came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa during 90 Day Fiancé season 10 after her three-year long-distance relationship with Gino. Jasmine did not know that Gino had thrown a bachelor party behind her back, which led to their split.




The seemingly single Jasmine has now revealed her franchise crush in her Instagram Stories.

          

It&#39;s none other than Nicole Sanders aka Nikki Exotika from 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Jasmine reposted a photo of Nikki on her Instagram Stories with the caption, &#34;My crush #TheNikki.&#34; Meanwhile, Nikki promoted her friend&#39;s FanBasis account on her Instagram Stories. She requested her followers to book video content from her friend. Jasmine was thankful when she reposted Nikki&#39;s story about her and wrote, &#34;I freaking love the Nikki.&#34; Jasmine added, &#34;I&#39;ll marry you in a heartbeat.&#34;
