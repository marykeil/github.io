## Literature Review
Phalisia Boothe was polarizing on Squid Game: The Challenge. Her business has been getting poor reviews from viewers, putting her livelihood at risk.




Squid Game: The Challenge may be one of the most popular reality TV series Netflix has ever produced, but one contestant’s livelihood is being threatened after her appearance on the show. Based on the South Korean drama Squid Game, the reality TV version of the series has been an overnight sensation for the streaming platform. Beginning with a massive group of 456 players, competitors were eliminated as they failed to do challenges in the game, with each eliminated player adding money to a growing prize fund. When the final player is left standing, they’ll earn $4.56 million, beating out the rest of the Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 competition.




Phalisia Boothe, known as player 229 on Squid Game: The Challenge, was a standout early on in the series but ultimately got eliminated from the competition during the Marbles game with her ally Ashley, player 278. After the series, Phalisia returned to her normal life and has been running her own business, but reported on Twitter that people have been leaving negative reviews on her business page after seeing her on Squid Game: The Challenge. 


 

“This is crazy! People are giving my company negative reviews! Now you guys are really affecting my livelihood for a reality tv show GAME,” Phalisia shared, along with screenshots of the fake reviews. “These people have never used my services EVER! What the **** is wrong with people?”

 Phalisia’s Squid Game: The Challenge Behavior Explained 
          

While Phalisia was a strong competitor in the game, many Squid Game: The Challenge viewers have found her to be difficult to watch in her time on the series. After aligning with Ashley, Phalisia’s loyalties were clear in the game, and she worked hard to keep both herself and Ashley safe in every scenario. During the jack-in-the-box test, Phalisia volunteered to go up for the group, choosing a jack-in-the-box to stand behind and eventually open. Though she could’ve received immediate elimination, Phalisia was given the opportunity to immediately eliminate three players from the game. Phalisia chose two of the stronger players from the Gganbu Gang alliance, Stephen and Rick.


 




After making her choice and eliminating two strong competitors, Phalisia became one of the least liked Squid Game: The Challenge players. Though it was her right to choose who to eliminate, Phalisia knew her decision would be polarizing for the competitors and the audience. She was preserving her life in the game, but ultimately the choice made enough people angry that she’s received backlash in her personal life and profession. Sadly for Phalisia, the dark side of reality TV fans can be tricky to navigate, especially for a show as massive as Squid Game: The Challenge. Many have expressed outrage at the fake reviews, hoping to support Phalisia moving forward.

As Squid Game: The Challenge winds down, most players are out of the competition. While Phalisia and her ally Ashley have both been facing major criticism for playing the game selfishly, their gameplay has been refreshing to watch for some other viewers. The game may not have been a successful experience for the women, but hopefully with support from Squid Game: The Challenge stars and fans alike, her time on the series will have been well worth the criticism.
