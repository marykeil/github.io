## Literature Review
True Detective season 4, Night Country, has debuted with the anthology show&#39;s best reviews yet, and the lead actor&#39;s biggest role underscores why.




At the lead of True Detective: Night Country’s critically acclaimed new season is Jodie Foster, whose Oscar-winning role from 33 years ago already revealed the HBO show’s new outing would be a hit. The reviews for True Detective: Night Country, the fourth outing in HBO’s anthology crime show, have set records as it earns the highest Rotten Tomatoes score for the entire series. At a “Certified Fresh” 100% score from critics, True Detective season 4’s Rotten Tomatoes score surpasses even that of the show’s first season in 2014, starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, which is widely considered to be one of the greatest TV seasons of all time.




While True Detective season 1 is a masterclass in television writing, acting, and drama, the following two seasons of the anthology show failed to achieve the same critical and audience acclaim as the debut outing. As such, True Detective: Night Country simultaneously had plenty riding on it to succeed and redeem the show while also having lowered expectations. However, with Jodie Foster leading True Detective season 4’s cast and story about two detectives solving the mystery of the disappearance of eight men in Alaska, its success should have already been a given.

 Season  Rotten Tomatoes Score   True Detective Season 1  91%   True Detective Season 2  47%   True Detective Season 3  84%   True Detective Season 4  100%   




 Silence Of The Lambs Already Revealed How Great True Detective Season 4 Would Be 
          




True Detective season 4 marks the first time since 1991’s Best Picture Oscar-winning movie The Silence of the Lambs that Jodie Foster has played a detective trying to solve a grisly crime. For her riveting performance as FBI Agent Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs, Foster won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Foster’s role as Clarice remains one of the most cherished and acclaimed performances of her career, with the drama also becoming the first and – as of yet – only horror movie to take home the Oscar for Best Picture. Now, returning Foster to this type of role and premise after 33 years, True Detective season 4 already had the perfect recipe for success.


 

In addition to casting Foster as the detective leading another brutal investigation, True Detective season 4 also integrates more horror elements that hark back to The Silence of the Lambs. Foster herself has been at the center of much of the praise for True Detective season 4, making it curious as to why it took over three decades for the actress to return to this award-winning character and story premise. Night Country showrunner Issa López also revealed that Foster had been a top choice to lead the season since the beginning, implying that Clarice going toe-to-toe with Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs had been the perfect preface to the skills necessary for embodying True Detective’s Liz Danvers.






 True Detective Season 4&#39;s Record-Breaking Reviews Hint At Jodie Foster Repeating Another Silence Of The Lambs Success 
         

With True Detective season 4 already setting records for the 10-year-old series ahead of its release, the prospects for Night Country’s future success are even greater. In particular, True Detective season 4 could see another parallel to Silence of the Lambs with awards success. True Detective season 1 was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, including a nod for Outstanding Drama Series and two Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nominations for McConaughey and Harrelson.



True Detective season 4 premieres Sunday, January 14 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.




Considering Foster’s Silence of the Lambs won Best Picture and Best Actress, her acclaimed role in True Detective season 4 could mirror these achievements. Based on season 1&#39;s performance, the show has the potential for an Emmy nomination or win for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. With Foster and her co-star Kali Reis receiving plenty of celebration even prior to the show&#39;s release, it&#39;s possible that True Detective: Night Country could become the show&#39;s most fruitful entry at the Emmys yet.
