## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Ariela Weinberg tells Biniyam Shibre she&#39;s considering ending her marriage in a shocking video from 90 Day Diairies.




90 Day Diaries is back for a new season, and it features Ariela Danielle making a major decision about her married life with Biniyam Shibre. Ariela and Biniyam, both 33, met in Ethiopia while she was trying to hail a cab. Ariela was six months pregnant during her debut in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 2 and was moving to Biniyam&#39;s country. Ariela was still married to her now ex-husband, Leandro Fosque, when she met Biniyam. Even after divorcing him, Ariela chose to remain friends with Leandro, much to the annoyance of Biniyam. Ariela brought Biniyam to the U.S. in 90 Day Fiancé season 9, where the two of them got married.




Ariela and Biniyam married almost two years ago but have sparked split rumors several times since then. Now their 90 Day Fiancé comeback via 90 Day Diaries suggests the speculation might have been true.


 

Biniyam and Ariela are sitting together on their couch sporting serious expressions in the 90 Day Diaries season 5 trailer as she accuses him of spending too much time with his friends. She claims he hasn&#39;t been &#34;very nice&#34; to her either. Biniyam adds, &#34;I don&#39;t believe for that one,&#34; and asks the cameras, &#34;What does she want?&#34; Biniyam says he doesn&#39;t want to separate or divorce Ariela.

Ariela has divorce on her mind as she tells Biniyam that he should be with someone who makes him happy. Ariela adds, &#34;Obviously I don&#39;t.&#34; Ariela and Biniyam could be on the verge of a painful split, but there&#39;s one 90 Day Fiancé cast member who seems to be happy to be single. Kimberly Menzies is best remembered for her storyline during 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5 in which she romanced Usman Umar, aka Sojaboy. Kim was Usman&#39;s biggest fan but wanted to be something more. He finally gave in to Kim&#39;s wishes and decided to date her. They got engaged, and Usman was all set to come to America on a K-1 visa.

However, Usman wanted to have a kid with her, which Kim couldn&#39;t give him due to his age. While the couple struggled to get on the same page, they decided to split. Kim found it difficult to move on from Usman and wanted to stay friends. Meanwhile, Usman was quick to find himself another girlfriend. He showed off the woman, named Kiera Ogden, while subtly throwing shade at Kim on Instagram. On 90 Day Diaries, Kim is revealing she&#39;s finally over Usman by setting fire to their old photographs. &#34;Really thought you were the love of my life,&#34; she says, and adds that there is not going to be any more &#34;Kimbaaaaly.&#34;




What Kim is retaining is her title of the &#34;Queen,&#34; which Usman affectionately called her as she starts a new life by moving out of her childhood home. Kim and Ariela are not the only cast members of 90 Day Diaries season 5. Popular couples such as Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods, Andrei Catsravet and Elizabeth Potthast, Emily Bieberly and Kobe Blaise, and more are making a comeback after their previous appearances to give important life updates.



90 Day Diaries season 5 premieres on Monday, January 8, 2024, at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
