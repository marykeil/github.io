Big Ed hasn’t had a great relationship with his daughter over the last few years. In 2020, he first talked about his fractured bond with his daughter, adding that he’d love to make amends with her. He said, “I’m sorry for not listening to you and that I hurt you,” pleading with Tiffany to forgive him. Big Ed and his daughter haven’t been on good terms because of many personal issues. However, Ed’s relationships with younger women were the top reasons that split them apart. Tiffany never liked that her father was dating women who were younger than her.

Big Ed looked genuinely happy about receiving a Christmas card from his daughter. He seemed ecstatic by the sheer thought of reconciling with Tiffany. Big Ed has been on reality TV for more than four years now. He was in his early 50&#39;s when he joined the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. However, things have changed a lot since then. Not only has he rediscovered himself, but he has also calmed down a lot. It seems the middle-aged man is slowly maturing with his age and has realized what truly matters to him. He probably wants to be a family man again.

Big Ed’s sudden personality change is attributed to his partner, Liz. She faced every challenge to make her relationship work. She made too many efforts to make him feel secure. Big Ed learned a lot from Liz on The Last Resort. He sensed her love for him and started improving his attitude. He became truthful with her and even leaked Jovi Dufren’s strip club plan. Big Ed seemed genuinely interested in making things work with Liz. Now, he’s hopeful to reconcile with his daughter. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé star can do it before 2023 ends.
