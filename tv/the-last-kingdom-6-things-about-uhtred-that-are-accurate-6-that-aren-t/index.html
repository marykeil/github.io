<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Last Kingdom is a great historical epic about the life of Uhtred of Uhtred. Here&rsquo;s what the show gets right and what is not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>Although The Last Kingdom may feel like a fictional story set in a real world, it wasn&rsquo;t drawn up out of thin air — especially when it comes to Uhtred the Bold. Based on Bernard Cornwall&rsquo;s series novel series The Saxon Stories, both the books and The Last Kingdom include characters that are based on real-life individuals. The story did take some historical liberties along the way. It&rsquo;s not like there was an immensely effective way to keep a detailed record of history from 800 to 1100. Nonetheless, all five seasons of The Last Kingdom make a valiant attempt at putting history onto the small screen.
This is why some of the things about Uhtred son of Uhtred are accurate to the real-life Uhtred the Bold. With there being limited records detailing Uhtred the Bold&rsquo;s life, there was only so much to work off of. In addition, what Uhtred son of Uhtred does share with Uhtred the Bold is still slightly different. Technically speaking, Uhtred of Bebbanburg isn&rsquo;t a real person, but he was partially based on Uhtred the Bold, despite his entire characterization being a work of fiction for The Last Kingdom and its feature film. That being said, there are six historically accurate things about Uhtred in the series and six things that aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked
The best TV shows of all time will be debated forever, but there are clear contenders. These are the very best TV shows of all time, ranked.</p>
<p>Inaccurate
The Era Of The Series</p>
<p>One Uhtred historical inaccuracy in The Last Kingdom is the era of the series. The Last Kingdom is set in ninth-century England when Alfred the Great ruled Wessex and eventually became King of the Anglo-Saxons. On the show, King Alfred is, of course, based on Alfred the Great, therefore the show&rsquo;s era is accurate to his character. However, it&rsquo;s not accurate to Uhtred&rsquo;s. Uhtred the Bold probably knew who Alfred the Great was, but he didn&rsquo;t know him personally. And there&rsquo;s no way Alfred the Great knew who Uhtred the Bold was since he was born late in the 10th century, nearly 100 years after Alfred died.
Birth Name</p>
<p>In The Last Kingdom, Uhtred son of Uhtred was originally someone else, not the main character who was also later known as Uhtred Ragnarsson. Uhtred was the old brother of the main character. He was killed by Danes in the very first episode of the show. At that point, the main character was named Osbert. His father, also Uhtred, made him change his name upon receiving the news. One of these Last Kingdom Uhtred changes was the birth name change (and Uhtred&rsquo;s nickname &ldquo;Arseling&rdquo;). Historical records show Uhtred the Bold was also known as Uchtred, but never Osbert. He was also not known as Uhtred son of Uhtred, given his dad&rsquo;s name was Waltheof.
Relationship With The Danes</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom portrays Uhtred the Bold as the blend of Saxon and Dane, making him the perfect candidate to bring the two groups together. It adds the element of internal conflict to the show. There are instances where it&rsquo;s an episode&rsquo;s driving force. However, one of the biggest of The Last Kingdom&rsquo;s Uhtred historical inaccuracies is that Uhtred the Bold was not raised by Danes. He did not fight on behalf of Danes. Uhtred the Bold did, however, marry the daughter of a Dane as a political move when he became Earl of York. Uhtred&rsquo;s obligations towards the Saxons and the Danes were probably a narrative move to create more tension.
Relationship With Ethelred</p>
<p>Uhtred Ragnarsson has a list of enemies in The Last Kingdom. There may be none more annoying than Æthelred of Mercia. He&rsquo;s unloyal to the king and could not be a worse husband to Lady Æthelflæd, who unfortunately passes away in season 5. Uhtred the Bold dealt with a lord by a similar name, Ethelred II, but was his ally, pointing out further Uhtred historical inaccuracies in The Last Kingdom. Ethelred the Unready had quite a bit to deal with in his time as King of England thanks to the Viking invasions. Uhtred the Bold helped him throughout this time and was rewarded as a result.
Blood Feuds Were Different</p>
<p>Uhtred the Bold was still surrounded by blood feuds; don&rsquo;t be mistaken. But he wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the one who saw them through, leading to more Uhtred historical inaccuracies in The Last Kingdom. Uhtred the Bold was killed in Thurbrand the Hold in 1016 after Ethelred had lost control of England to King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark a few years earlier. Thurbrand was then killed by one of Uhtred&rsquo;s sons, Ealdred. He was then killed by Thurbrand&rsquo;s son, Carl. Ealdred&rsquo;s grandson then took vengeance for his family years later. Such a loving family.
Utred Was Not Raised By The Danes With Their Religion</p>
<p>Another one of the biggest Uhtred historical inaccuracies in The Last Kingdom has to do with the religion of Uhtred the Bold. Not being raised by Danes likely means Uhtred did not believe in Valhalla or the Norse gods altogether. That, the fact he married a bishop&rsquo;s daughter and records indicating he met the bishop&rsquo;s daughter while helping transport the remains of St. Cuthbert meant he was likely of the Christian faith. It may seem like a small difference, but it is worth noting considering the contentious relations between Christians and pagans throughout history, chronicled in shows like Vikings: Valhalla.</p>
<p>Accurate
Uhtred Was From Bebbanburgh</p>
<p>Despite the era being wrong and Uhtred&rsquo;s age discrepancies, one of The Last Kingdom&rsquo;s Uhtred historical accuracies is his place of origin. Just like his fictional counterpart, Uhtred the Bold was a Saxon of Northumbria, the northern region of what is now England. Furthermore, he was from Bebbanburgh — which audiences are reminded is Uhtred son of Uhtred&rsquo;s home at least once an episode. It&rsquo;s even in one of his many names: Uhtred of Bebbanburgh. Though Bebbanburgh was known as Bamburgh throughout Uhtred the Bold&rsquo;s lifetime, it&rsquo;s still the same place geographically.
Uhtred Would Hold Significant Power</p>
<p>Uhtred the Bold&rsquo;s father, Waltheof, was the ealdorman of Bamburgh. Uhtred would even go on to take over as Earl of Bamburgh before his father&rsquo;s passing. He was also named Earl of York after Ælfhelm of York was murdered. This gave him significant power, now being the earl of both northern and southern Northumbria. Needless to say, there&rsquo;s a good chance Uhtred the Bold wasn&rsquo;t going around telling everyone he was going to take over the title that was stolen from him as a child.
Utred Was Such A Warrior He Was Named Earl Of Bamburg Even With His Father Still Alive</p>
<p>One of the greatest Uhtred historical accuracies in The Last Kingdom is his bravery as a fighter. He was called Uhtred the Bold for a reason. Uhtred son of Uhtred&rsquo;s inspiration may have had the birthright to become Earl of Bamburgh, but he put himself on the fast track to seat thanks to his work in battle. When King Malcolm II of Scotland invaded Northumbria, Uhtred led his people in battle, where his aging father could not. He was then rewarded the title Earl of Bamburg even though his father was still alive. Uhtred fought Danes, as well. He even dealt with a Viking named Cnut.
Uhtred Of Bebbanburgh Had Three Wives</p>
<p>Uhtred the Bold has taken two wives in the course of The Last Kingdom and its feature film, in addition to the relationship he had with the shadow queen Iseult, Lady Æthelflæd, Skade, and Brida. Although the characters he marries in the show are fictional, Uhtred of Bebbanburgh is much like Uhtred the Bold in the sense he took on multiple lovers. Uhtred the Bold was married three times. First, he married a bishop&rsquo;s daughter. Upon being named Earl of York, he &ldquo;repudiated&rdquo; her and married the daughter of a wealthy Dane from York. He would later marry King Ethelred II&rsquo;s daughter, though it&rsquo;s unclear how Uhtred&rsquo;s second marriage ended.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom: 10 Worst Things Uhtred Has Done
Uhtred might be everyone&rsquo;s favorite Dane Slayer but it did take fans a while to get here. After all, he has made some grave and horrific mistakes along the way.</p>
<p>Ealdred And Edward The Elder Were Friends Because Of Their Fathers</p>
<p>While Uhtred mainly gets his character inspiration from Uhtred the Bold, he&rsquo;s also inspired by Ealdred I of Bamburgh, who reigned at the beginning of the 10th century. While Uhtred and Edward prove to have more of a contentious relationship in the season 5 finale of The Last Kingdom, and Edward bites the dust in The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die, Ealdred and Edward the Elder were friends because of the relationship between their fathers, according to The Historia de Sancto Cuthberto. Whether their relationship was quite as involved as it is in The Last Kingdom, however, is contestable.
Utred&rsquo;s Battle In The First Season Was Based On A Real Event</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom tried to put its best foot forward in terms of Uhtred historical accuracies, as their account of Uhtred the Bold leading an army from Bernicia and Yorkshire against the Scots in season 1 did play out. Similar to the series, he lined his enemies&rsquo; severed heads on poles along the walls of Durham, and it was this victory that secured the real Uhtred the Bold&rsquo;s ealdorman of Bamburgh and later York. Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t much other accuracy to be found in The Last Kingdom&rsquo;s characterization of Uhtred the Bold, but the show and the movie are enjoyable historical fiction nonetheless.
The Last Kingdom   Cast:   Alexander Dreymon, Emily Cox, Ian Hart, Eliza Butterworth, Eva Birthistle, Mark Rowley, Cavan Clerkin, Tobias Santelmann, David Dawson    Seasons:   5    Genres:   Action, Drama, History    Summary:   Based on the Saxon Stories novel series by Bernard Cornwell, The Last Kingdom tells the story of a man who seeks to reclaim his birthright. Set in 872, the kingdoms that makeup England have come under Dane rule, with Wessex the last one standing under King Alfred. The protagonist, Uhtred, is born of noble descent but is captured by the Danes and raised to be one. As he ages, he must choose between his ancestral home or the family that caught but raised him. Uhted will wrestle with his loyalties as he battles between his Saxon and Dane lineages, and, when it all comes to a head, may be the deciding factor in the continuing Saxon lineage or the birth of a new nation. The Last Kingdom ran from October 2015 until March 2022.
