## Literature Review

Max&#39;s crime thriller series Full Circle took audiences from NYC to Guyana in a twisty tale about a botched kidnapping, but will there be a season 2?




Max&#39;s crime thriller miniseries Full Circle features a twisty tale that&#39;s full of surprises, but has it garnered enough viewership for Full Circle season 2? Full Circle sees a botched kidnapping turn into international intrigue as viewers are taken from NYC to Guyana to work out the finer points of this titillating mystery. The TV show was written and created by Ed Solomon (Men in Black). However, legendary director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich) was at the helm, directing all six episodes. Before it ever aired on Max, the series saw its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.




Led by the star-studded Full Circle cast, the series sees affluent couple Derek (Timothy Olyphant) and Sam (Claire Danes) as the subjects of a botched kidnapping, as Guyanese crime boss Mahabir (CCH Pounder) intended to kidnap their son Jared (Ethan Stoddard) to break a family curse, but ends up kidnapping the wrong kid. As Detective Harmony (Zazie Beetz) is on the case, she soon finds out there are secrets and lies the Browne family holds close. While the ending was pretty definitive, is it possible that Full Circle season 2 news is on the horizon?

 The Most Recent Full Circle Season 2 News 
          

The latest news on Full Circle sees the limited series completely snubbed at both the Golden Globes and Emmys. The series received no attention from the award shows and was largely bowled over by other high-profile shows like The Bear and The Last of Us. While this isn&#39;t a death sentence for the limited series, it doesn&#39;t help when it comes to generating interest in a second season. Shows like The White Lotus were able to break free of the bonds of the &#34;limited&#34; label, but that was a series riding a wave of critical momentum.






 Full Circle Season 2 Isn&#39;t Confirmed 
          

Full Circle season 2 isn&#39;t confirmed yet, but that doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be in the future. Max shows like True Detective and The Flight Attendant have proven time and time again that the crime thriller genre is a lucrative one. As audiences tune in to binge Full Circle&#39;s six episodes, they will surely want more as the series is jam-packed with jaw-dropping reveals, unpredictable twists and turns, and a talented cast to boot.



 Full Circle Season 2 Cast 
          

The Full Circle cast is filled with star power, and there&#39;s nothing to say the major players couldn&#39;t return to reprise their roles. Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2) gave a powerhouse performance as Harmony, and could reprise the role, with the same going for Claire Danes&#39; (Homeland) Sam and Timothy Olyphant&#39;s (Justified) Derek. Though the most logical route for the series would be to follow the anthology structure, a continuation is also on the table for every character that lived through season one.




This means season 2 of Full Circle could include:

 Actor  Full Circle Role   Dennis Quaid  Chef Jeff   Ethan Stoddard  Jared   Lucian Zanes  Nicky   Gerald Jones  Louis   Adia  Natalia   Sheyi Cole  Xavier   CCH Pounder  Mahabir   





 Full Circle Season 2 Story Details 
          

One of many shows like HBO&#39;s True Detective, Full Circle&#39;s primary mystery is solved by the end of the series, but the Browne family could have more secrets to tell. The show could go three routes: it could continue to pull at the thread of the Browne family&#39;s corruption, the Full Circle season 2 story could be an anthology tale and see an entirely new mystery around corruption in privileged families, or it could see Harmony become the protagonist as she takes on different complex cases.




There aren&#39;t many more options when it comes to following the Browne family, as Sam&#39;s big secret was revealed, but the other two routes show promise. Like The White Lotus, a Full Circle season 2 story could see more themes of how privilege and corruption intertwine with a different set of characters and new mysteries to explore. A Harmony-centric series could also run with these themes, as well as further explore her motivations for taking down the Guyanese mob. There are a couple of ways that the Full Circle season 2 story could go if it happens.
