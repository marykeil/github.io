  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé star Angela Deem has gotten so real about her love life with Michael Ilesanmi. Her &ldquo;no filter&rdquo; comments are definitely cringe.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé diva Angela Deem never holds back, and that&rsquo;s why some of her revelations about her sex life are cringe-inducing. Yes, Angela&rsquo;s a force of nature, and when she decides to get real, she can go way over the top. Unabashedly sexual and proud of her body, she isn&rsquo;t afraid to be who she really is. That&rsquo;s probably why she&rsquo;s still a franchise mainstay, despite some wild scandals that would have gotten anyone else canceled. With &ldquo;Angie,&rdquo; what people see is what they get. Her honesty can be brutal, but at least she&rsquo;s not playing a part. For years, she&rsquo;s been just the same - erratic, passionate, loudmouthed and funny. Angela will never change.
In the 90 Day Fiancé franchise, Angela and Michael&rsquo;s relationship saga&rsquo;s been unfolding for years. A month ago, the Georgia peach was spotted at an American Walmart with her man. Yes, Michael made it to America. It was very hard for him to get a visa, and Angela lashed out at another franchise star, Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar. She blamed him for making Nigerians look like scammers. She thought Usman and people like him were keeping good people like Michael out of the USA. Angie&rsquo;s always tangling with somebody. However, her &ldquo;tangling&rdquo; with Michael isn&rsquo;t always unpleasant. She seems to enjoy their intimate life, and that means that everyone has to hear about it.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now<br>
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8 Angela Deem Bragged About Her Hot &ldquo;Makeup Sex&rdquo; With Michael Ilesanmi
Is This Why She Keeps Putting Up With Michael Ilesanmi Year After Year?</p>
<p>Near the end of 2022, Angela, who certainly enjoys a good fight now and then, overshared by letting the world know that she had the
&ldquo;best makeup sex&rdquo;</p>
<p>with Michael. Maybe that was more than fans wanted to know, but Angie doesn&rsquo;t care. If she has a thought that she wants to communicate, she doesn&rsquo;t filter it. She just puts it out there. On 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, Angela and Michael got into it. Things actually became violent. During the dust-up, Angela decided that Michael shouldn&rsquo;t have his own Instagram account anymore. Apparently, he couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to interact with followers. Angela believed that Michael would use his IG account to find women. She was probably not wrong. To add insult to injury, he blocked the famous &ldquo;meemaw&rdquo; on Instagram.
Jealousy is a problem for Angela. When Michael makes her question his fidelity, she goes berserk. Anything can set her off - the Instagram account is just one example. The problem is that Michael has cheated. If he did it once, he might do it again. So, Angie&rsquo;s an older woman with a younger husband who&rsquo;s a cheater - that&rsquo;s not an ideal situation.
Angela finds ways to feel fulfilled in an often-troubled relationship. Sex is an outlet. Apparently, after Angela and Michael get into no-holds-barred fights, they make up in an equally dramatic fashion. Angela enjoys bragging about their sex life, which may be the reason why she&rsquo;s still in this ludicrous relationship.
These two aren&rsquo;t on the same page. Michael seems like a user and charmer, just like Usman. Angela tries to push away her suspicions about Michael, but they always come back. However, if Angela&rsquo;s &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; with Michael in other ways, she may be willing to overlook even the most blatant red flags.
Angela has forgiven him too many times and that trend will probably continue.</p>
<p>7 Angela Deem Said She &amp; Michael Had Sex 38 Times In Two Weeks
Was Angela Deem Telling The Truth?</p>
<p>Angela&rsquo;s into quantity as well as quality, as she also brags about how often she and Michael hook up. Why she feels compelled to share this information with the entire world is hard to determine. It might be to show her haters that she and Michael actually have a strong bond, but are Angela&rsquo;s claims actually true? Did she and Michael really get intimate &ldquo;38 times&rdquo; in two weeks? Why was Angela counting the encounters?
While she brazens it out regularly, this may be a sign that Angela doesn&rsquo;t enjoy all the criticism she gets. She&rsquo;s probably sick of people questioning her relationship with Michael, since she&rsquo;s also had to question it. Why else would she go out of her way to make it seem like they have the best sex life ever? Angela shared this tacky revelation at a Tell-All and her costars seemed skeptical. They may have been a bit grossed out too. When Angie overshares, she is next level.</p>
<p>6 Angela Deem Mentioned A &ldquo;Penis Warmer&rdquo; On 90DF: Happily Ever After?
Michael Ilesanmi Begged Angela Deem Not To Share Details About Their Sex Life</p>
<p>Michael doesn&rsquo;t actually want everyone to know what he and Angela do in the bedroom, so Angie betrayed him when she said that they used sex toys. Her TMI hit a new apex when she mentioned a &ldquo;penis warmer&rdquo; (a sock, basically) and &ldquo;handcuffs&rdquo; during a 90DF spin-off appearance. Angela is an extrovert who likes to shock, so it&rsquo;s not that surprising that she went against Michael&rsquo;s wishes. It was obviously more important to her to entertain viewers.
While Michael gets most of the criticism because he cheated, Angela isn&rsquo;t exactly easy to get along with. The fact that she would reveal these sorts of details when he pleaded with her to stay quiet says a lot about her lack of respect for him. Why would Angela want Michael to feel so exposed and uncomfortable? While it may not seem like a big deal that she talked about their sex life as she&rsquo;s so open about everything, it actually tells an important story about their relationship.
Angela won&rsquo;t listen. However, when she feels wronged, she will lash out.She attacked Michael&rsquo;s car - she once threw a strawberry shortcake at him, hitting Michael in the face. Angela may like to play the angry victim sometimes, but she isn&rsquo;t innocent. Michael was clearly cringing when she talked about their intimate life while the cameras rolled.
Angela shoudn&rsquo;t have said anything about her sex life with Michael.</p>
<p>5 Angela Deem Claimed Michael Ilesanmi Fibbed To &ldquo;Get Into My Pants&rdquo;
Angela Deem Said He Lied About Deleting His Instagram Account</p>
<p>When he vowed to delete his Instagram because she didn&rsquo;t want him to have his own account (she felt it was a tool he&rsquo;d utilize to cheat on her), she believed him. Then, they slept together. See Michael and Angela together in the IG post above, from the @michael_ilesanmi90dayofficial account. Sometimes, they seem happy, but the truth&rsquo;s more complicated.
Angela has trouble being realistic when it comes to her much-younger partner. Perhaps blinded by love, she believes all the sweet talk and empty promises. The thing is, Michael really hurts her sometimes. Angela tries to hide her softer side most of the time, but it&rsquo;s there, and no one can push her buttons like Michael does.
Things were fine that night. However, the next day, Michael the player changed his tune. He said that he wasn&rsquo;t going to delete the social media account. She was very upset. To her, the request probably seemed totally rational. It&rsquo;s like she was trying to protect Michael from himself. He has a history of being unfaithful. To him, her request must have seemed very emasculating. The underlying issue is lack of trust that is one hundred percent justified.
The lack of trust is the real issue that can&rsquo;t be fixed, although Angela keeps trying.</p>
<p>The best thing she can do is throw in the towel, but she seems to love Michael, although she&rsquo;s a bit of a flirt herself. Maybe Angela doesn&rsquo;t want to admit defeat even though she should. She&rsquo;s invested so much time, energy and money. This relationship has dragged on for years, and her dream was Michael coming to America to live with her. Now, that dream has come true, but is it really such a fairytale? What she has is a man who&rsquo;s proven again and again that he&rsquo;s conning her. It&rsquo;s such a hollow win, and it&rsquo;s bound to turn into a major loss someday. She should cut her losses immediately.</p>
<p>4 Angela Deem Said Michael Told Another Woman He Loved Her
Michael Ilesanmi Sent That Message While He Was In Angela Deem&rsquo;s Bed</p>
<p>Angela&rsquo;s given a lot to Michael by being with him. For example, he&rsquo;s a famous reality star now. He&rsquo;s made it to America, where he may have more opportunities than he did in his native Nigeria. However, he doesn&rsquo;t seem very grateful to his older partner. He goes out of his way to humiliate her, although he tends to get caught cheating rather than intentionally rubbing his infidelity in her face. In this case, she found out that he told another woman he loved her while he was in her bed. That&rsquo;s a terrible thing to do to a partner. The bed they share should be a safe space for both of them.
Anyone who would do this doesn&rsquo;t love their partner, but Angie keeps hanging on, waiting for something to change. She&rsquo;s willfully ignorant about Michael. The rage she&rsquo;s shown at times is a clear sign that she does understand who he is, but represses a lot of her anger. When she&rsquo;s really triggered, it comes out. When that happens, Angela can be violent and dangerous. Since she&rsquo;s gotten physical with him in the past, they shouldn&rsquo;t be together.
Another bad fight between Angela and Michael could go dangerously awry. Angela might really lose control.</p>
<p>3 Angela Deem Said That Michael Ilesanmi Was &ldquo;Big Enough To Make Me Sore&rdquo;
Angela Deem&rsquo;s Really Into Making Michael Sound Like A Great Lover</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Angela enjoyed some private time with Michael, to the extent that she was feeling
&ldquo;sore&rdquo;</p>
<p>after their sexual escapades. She was referring to the &ldquo;big&rdquo; number of lovemaking sessions rather than the dimensions of his private parts. However, while all of this action was going on, they weren&rsquo;t even in the same country. All of this teasing and pleasing was happening virtually. Again, it seems like Angela wants to make Michael sound like a great lover who&rsquo;s very into her. His cheating tells a different story.
Angela may be soothed by sexual interactions with her partner - possibly, they make her feel more secure in the relationship. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a woman being sexual - society&rsquo;s moved forward, but there&rsquo;s still some stigma when women are bold about their needs and how they meet them. Angie, like Madonna and other trailblazers, isn&rsquo;t interested in being demure. She&rsquo;s not hindered by the need to be a &ldquo;lady&rdquo; and why should she be? However, she can be so vulgar.</p>
<p>2 Angela Deem Said She Was A &ldquo;Lesbian&rdquo; On 90 Day: The Single Life
Was Angela Deem Just Trying To Shock The Audience?</p>
<p>Angela got frisky with Kalani Faagata in a bed during their 90 Day: The Single Life stint, but her proclamation that she was a &ldquo;lesbian&rdquo; seemed a bit contrived. The Meemaw&rsquo;s wild, but she&rsquo;s no fool - she knows that people want to watch her act outrageous. She might be bisexual, but her long-standing obsession with Michael&rsquo;s body and their sex life means that there&rsquo;s also the chance she was faking her sexuality for shock value.
Angie will do anything and say anything. She is always playing to the peanut gallery. So, some things that Angela does raise eyebrows. Everything she says can&rsquo;t be taken at face value. She&rsquo;s putting on a show.</p>
<p>1 Angela Deem Loved Singing &ldquo;Duets&rdquo; With A Male Stripper
Angela Deem Said Michael Ilesnamni&rsquo;s Phone Sex Skills Were Going Downhill</p>
<p>Angie gets mighty heated when Michael shows any interest in other women, but she&rsquo;s not afraid to branch out herself. One of her &ldquo;experiments&rdquo; was with a male stripper, Billy, whom she said she enjoyed singing &ldquo;duets&rdquo; with. Was this a double entendre? At the same time that she showcased Angela&rsquo;s shameless flirting, Angela dissed Michael. She stated that his phone sex skills were not what they used to be. Demanding, horny, temperamental - 90 Day Fiancé star Angela&rsquo;s a handful. Angela may end up single forever because she&rsquo;s too much for any man.
