## Literature Review
Lieutenant James T. Kirk is amiable in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2, but he&#39;s not far removed from surviving a tragedy on the USS Farragut.




Lieutenant James T. Kirk (Paul Wesley) projected an affable and amiable front in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2, but Kirk is not far removed from surviving a horrible tragedy aboard the USS Farragut. Strange New Worlds introduced three versions of James T. Kirk played by Paul Wesley, but the first two were Captain Kirks from alternate timelines. Lieutenant Kirk is the same canonical character who will eventually become the Captain of the USS Enterprise played by William Shatner in Star Trek: The Original Series and Wesley&#39;s James shares the same history and hidden traumas.




Star Trek: The Original Series season 2, episode 18, &#34;Obsession&#34;, which is set in 2268, revealed that 11 years prior, a Dikironium cloud creature attacked the USS Farragut. Lieutenant Kirk was serving aboard the Farragut on his first deep space assignment. Although Kirk wasn&#39;t among the casualties, the cloud creature killed 200 crew members, including James&#39; mentor, Captain Garrovick. Kirk was haunted by the deaths and his hesitation to fire upon the creature. Lt. Kirk remained aboard the Farragut after the tragedy, and he was promoted to First Officer in Strange New Worlds season 2. In Star Trek: TOS&#39; &#34;Obsession,&#34; Captain Kirk and Captain Garrovick&#39;s son, Ensign David Garrovick (Stephen Brooks), were faced with the Dikironium cloud creature killing crew members of the USS Enterprise.

                  10 Things We Want From Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Season 3   Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 is in production now, and hopefully the next 10 episodes will deliver on these storylines and plot threads.    





 Lieutenant James T. Kirk Survived Deaths On The USS Farragut 
Kirk is hiding some inner pain in Strange New Worlds.
         

In Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2, Lieutenant Kirk shows no signs of the terrible ordeal he survived on the USS Farragut just a couple of years prior. Kirk first appeared on a PADD when Lt. La&#39;an Noonien-Singh (Christina Chong) contacted him, but James beamed aboard the USS Enterprise in Strange New Worlds season 2, episode 6, &#34;Lost in Translation,&#34; where he reunited with his brother, Lt. Sam Kirk (Dan Jeannotte). Kirk also canonically met Ensign Nyota Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding) and Lt. Spock (Ethan Peck). Lt. Kirk returned in Strange New Worlds&#39; musical episode. Throughout his time compassionately helping Uhura, confessing he has a pregnant girlfriend named Carol (Marcus) to La&#39;an, and singing and dancing with the Enterprise crew, Kirk still harbored the buried trauma of the Dikironium cloud creature&#39;s massacre aboard the Farragut.




Interestingly, Strange New Worlds has another character who must have survived the Dikironium cloud creature&#39;s attack on the USS Farragut: Nurse Christine Chapel (Jess Bush) served on the Farragut prior to her assignment on the USS Enterprise under Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) and Dr. Joseph M&#39;Benga (Babs Olusanmokun). Chapel even wore a Farragut pin on Remembrance Day in Strange New Worlds season 1, episode 4, &#34;Memento Mori,&#34; although it hasn&#39;t been made clear yet if Christine knows James Kirk from the Farragut. Chapel has certainly had a difficult Starfleet career if she lived through both the Farragut and the Klingon War of 2256/2257 before she arrived on the Starship Enterprise, and Christine was also the lone survivor of the USS Cayuga being destroyed by the Gorn in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2&#39;s finale.



 Star Trek: Prodigy Ties Into Kirkâ€™s Tragedy In Strange New Worlds &amp; TOS 
&#34;All The World&#39;s A Stage&#34; is a sequel to Star Trek: TOS &#34;Obsession&#34;
          




Star Trek: Prodigy unexpectedly tied into Captain Kirk and Ensign David Garrovick&#39;s Star Trek: The Original Series history. In Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, episode 13, &#34;All The World&#39;s A Stage&#34;, the ragtag young crew of the USS Protostar landed on a planet that altered its culture to reflect (as best it could) Captain Kirk and the Starship Enterprise. At some point after Star Trek: TOS&#39; &#34;Obsession&#34;, Ensign Garrovick took on a mission to this uncharted planet but crashed shuttlecraft Galileo. The planet&#39;s natives rescued Garrovick, who they called &#34;En-Son,&#34; and remodeled their society after Starfleet (which they mistakenly call Starflight).

Star Trek: The Original Series season, episode 18, &#34;Obsession,&#34; wasn&#39;t one of the most well-known of the Starship Enterprise&#39;s adventures in the 1960s, but it has had a remarkable impact on the backstories of the newer Star Trek series. As a prequel to TOS, Strange New Worlds is filling in many blanks about James T. Kirk&#39;s life before he becomes Captain of the Enterprise, and although &#34;Obsession&#34; hasn&#39;t been directly addressed yet by Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, that history is part of Lieutenant Kirk and, likely, Nurse Chapel. Star Trek: Prodigy also ties into Star Trek: TOS, but it&#39;s over a century removed from the tragedy of the USS Farragut that Captain Kirk will eventually face again in Star Trek: The Original Series.
