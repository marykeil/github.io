## Literature Review
There have been many unlikable cast members on Below Deck and its many spin-offs, but fans think that Jamie Sayed from Down Under is the worst of all.




There were several villains on Below Deck Down Under, but fans think Jamie Sayed is the worst cast member in the entire franchise. The 38-year-old cop turned bosun had issues with everyone, including fan-favorite Captain Jason Chambers. When fans saw how he treated the rest of the Thalassa crew, they gave him the title of being the worst on Reddit. As fans await Below Deck Down Under season 3, it&#39;s time to revisit the terrible bosun.




Jamie showed a lack of respect for his superiors throughout Below Deck Down Under season 1 by consistently disregarding respect for his captain, calling him simply, &#34;Jason.&#34; Below Deck Down Under season 1 kicked off with a bang, introducing the crew of the Thalassa, a luxury yacht sailing the Whitsunday Islands off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Captain Jason oversaw a team of seasoned yachties, including Chief Stew Aesha Scott, Chef Ryan McKeown, and Jamie, who caused trouble from the start.


 Why Fans On Reddit Dislike Jamie From Below Deck Down Under 

 

Reddit user u/Alternative_Tower_34 compiled lists of everything Jamie has done that support the claim that he is the worst, such as bullying and degrading his crew instead of leading them. Viewers found Jamie&#39;s aggression to be the source of the issue, with one Reddit user saying, &#34;Jamie actually scared meâ€”his aggression level teetered into the uncomfortable zone.&#34; Another user added that &#34;he would say one thing to someone and then twist it around when talking to another person,&#34; insinuating he was manipulative throughout the season.






 Below Deck Down Under&#39;s Jamie Sparked Controversy Onboard 
          

When Jamie, who often clashed with Captain Jason, was not yelling at his captain or his deckhands, he was angry when things did not go his way. Jamie was also interested in third stew Magda Ziomek on Below Deck Down Under, and the pair had a flirtation early into the charter season. When it was revealed that she had a boyfriend back home, Jamie got furious and left the crew while everyone was hanging out. Despite that, Magda said she would still consider dating Jamie now that she and her boyfriend have broken up.

Below Deck Down Under got off to a rocky start, with inexperienced deckhand Benny Crawley and temperamental Chef Ryan, who was fired, causing issues for the crew. When the charter season started, many fans loved Jamie for putting Benny in his place when he did not take his job as seriously as he should. Throughout the season, he started competing against Chef Ryan for the worst cast member. What sets the two apart is that Jamie was more sneaky when it came to being an awful person; towards the other departments and as the leader of the exterior crew.




While Jamie certainly got on the bad side of many of his fellow cast members on Below Deck Down Under, he might not be the worst of all time. Chef Ryan is often regarded as the worst because he did not do his job well, often getting complaints about his lackluster food, and was continually rude to the rest of the Thalassa crew, leading to his ultimate firing. Nonetheless, Jaime&#39;s overall better-than-everyone attitude and anger are what made him the worst crew member from Below Deck Down Under. Due to his villain status, he didn&#39;t return for season 2.
