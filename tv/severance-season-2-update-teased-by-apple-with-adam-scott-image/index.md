  Apple TV Plus teases a possible update on Severance season 2 with an image of Adam Scott&#39;s character Mark Scout.   The image does not provide any plot details for Severance season 2.

Apple TV Plus teases a possible update on Severance season 2 with an image of Adam Scott&#39;s character Mark Scout. In the show, Mark manages a team of office workers who have had their memories of work and personal lives surgically divided. Severance has had one season so far, which ran for nine episodes in 2022.




Now, Apple TV Plus shares a Severance image, hinting at potential new information to come. Unfortunately, the image does little by way of providing plot details for Severance season 2.


 

Mark gives an ambiguous, but perhaps perturbed, expression as he looks into the camera. Apple TV Plus did not provide any caption or other context as to the nature of this post or potential update.

Ben Stiller Offers A Severance Season 2 Update


Following this cryptic post, executive producer and director Ben Stiller gave his own Severance season 2 update, confirming the creative team is &#34;working on it.&#34;





 Severance Season 2 Has Had a Rocky Production Path 
         




Severance season 1 was highly regarded by critics and viewers alike upon its release in 2022. Severance&#39;s cast received a multitude of Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Patricia Arquette, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Scott, and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for both Christopher Walken and John Turturro. The show as a whole was also nominated for Outstanding Drama series. Severance season 2 was announced in April 2022, just as season 1 was coming to a close.

                  Is Severance Season 2 Heading To The Outside World? Helly Tease Explained   A teaser for the season 2 of Apple TV&#39;s hit series Severance might suggest that the innies of Lumon will be spending more time in the outside world.    

Despite the quick renewal and awards success, viewers are still waiting for Severance season 2. This delay is due in part to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes which rattled many productions in 2023. As the writers&#39; strike started in May, Severance season 2 was forced to shut down production. However, Severance season 2 had already faced delays due to alleged on-set drama between its showrunners.




Since the conclusion of the strikes this fall, there has yet to be official confirmation that Severance season 2 has resumed production once more. Apple TV Plusâ€™ vague Twitter post is a good sign, however, as it suggests that more info about Severance&#39;s new episodes may be on its way. Hopefully, this elusive post manifests into the announcement of a release date or more for Severance season 2.
