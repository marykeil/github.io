## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Kalani is flaunting her relationship with boyfriend Dallas on Instagram. She is sharing a heartwarming update from Christmas day.




90 Day: The Last Resort star Kalani Faagata is celebrating a major relationship milestone with her boyfriend, Dallas Nuez, following her split with Asuelu Pulaa. Kalani and Asuelu&#39;s reality TV storyline began in 90 Day Fiancé season 6 when he moved to the U.S. from Samoa. Kalani had already welcomed her first baby with Asuelu, then they got married and quickly welcomed their second son. Kalani was aware that Asuelu had been cheating on her throughout their entire relationship. Compared to Asuelu, Dallas is someone who gives Kalani the much-needed attention and love she has been craving.




Kalani met Dallas in November 2022 when they began dating, and in December 2023, Kalani is celebrating Christmas for the first time with her new love.

          

Kalani has been trying not to share a lot of information about Dallas on social media, including his face, but she couldn&#39;t resist sharing a sweet moment featuring Dallas and her sons on her Instagram. It was Dallas who first posted a picture of Kalani’s sons Oliver, 5, and Kennedy, 4, opening their Christmas presents on Christmas morning. The boys wore matching pajamas and Dallas even tagged Kalani&#39;s parents&#39; IG account in his story before Kalani reposted it with a sticker of &#34;Merry Christmas.&#34;

 Is Kalani Still Friends With Asuelu After 90 Day Fiancé? 
          

Kalani celebrated Christmas 2022 with Asuelu even though he had just come back from his trip to Samoa where he seemingly cheated on her and developed an oral yeast infection. Kalani and Asuelu had already sparked split rumors in early 2022, but Kalani may not have thought of ending their marriage until this incident. Kalani and Asuelu posed for a happy Christmas photo with Oliver and Kennedy in front of a Christmas tree on December 20, 2022. While Kalani had already met Dallas by then, she also went out on a date with Asuelu on December 30, 2022.

Asuelu had shared a video of him clinking cocktail glasses with Kalani and suggested everything was going great in the marriage when it wasn&#39;t. Kalani and Asuelu filmed 90 Day: The Last Resort in January 2023 when they first confirmed they were facing marital issues on camera. Asuelu spoke about giving Kalani the hall pass to go and kiss someone else. He thought Kalani had just kissed Dallas when she had been secretly dating him behind Asuelu&#39;s back. Kalani blocked Dallas during filming but later unblocked him after she caught Asuelu slyly deleting some messages from his phone.




Dallas flew to the 90 Day: The Last Resort filming location to meet Kalani, and she knew it was over between her and Asuelu. Kalani decided to divorce Asuelu. However, the couple were to stay friends, so they could co-parent their sons. Kalani and Asuelu seemingly didn&#39;t get together on Christmas this time around. Asuelu hasn&#39;t shared any Christmas updates himself, and it appears he&#39;s been spending his time playing golf in Hawaii.
