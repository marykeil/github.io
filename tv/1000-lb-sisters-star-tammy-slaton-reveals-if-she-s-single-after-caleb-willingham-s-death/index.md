1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton revealed her current relationship status following Caleb Willingham&#39;s death in June 2023. Throughout her reality TV career, Tammy had dated men who used her for clout and were acting as &#34;feeders,&#34; which hindered her recovery. Tammy wished to be with a man who loved her for who she was but was let down by the men she ended up with. Then along came Caleb, whom Tammy married in November 2022, even though she was in rehab. However, Tammy&#39;s husband of less than a year died at just 40 years old. They were feeling the strain of distance in their marriage when Caleb passed away.




Kentucky native Tammy was devastated by the news of her husband&#39;s passing as she considered him to be her best friend, and according to Tammy&#39;s latest TikTok, she is still not ready to move on from the relationship.


 

Tammy recently shared a video where she participated in a trend and let the app guess who her Christmas soulmate was going to be. The app told Tammy that her soulmate would be a “coworker” who “will eat [her] cookies and cream&#34; in 2024. Tammy&#39;s response to the awkward results was &#34;no&#34; as she shook her head at the ridiculousness. “H*** naw I’d never be with a coworker,&#34; Tammy added in her caption.

Tammy explained that she could never date someone from work &#34;mostly because my coworkers are my family lol.&#34; Tammy also chose to include &#34;single life&#34; in her message to her followers. It has been reported that Tammy and Caleb were estranged at the time of his death. Tammy was staying at the Windsor Lane Rehabilitation Center in Ohio after suffering from a collapsed lung. Tammy and Caleb were both in the medical center so they could maintain their weight and get to know more about healthy lifestyle choices. Tammy said that Caleb made her feel special.

She married Caleb in an intimate ceremony within the rehab center itself. The news of Tammy and Caleb&#39;s wedding came as a shock. Amy Slaton supported her sister&#39;s choice. She was also Tammy&#39;s bridesmaid at the wedding. Caleb was looking forward to moving to Kentucky so he could better support Tammy in her weight-loss journey. Tammy also enjoyed wedded bliss for a few months. However, she was never physically attracted to Caleb. He had supposedly researched her online before approaching her. Caleb wanted to have kids with Tammy, but they had different goals in life.




Tammy was apparently ready to file for divorce in May 2023 after she had a falling out with Caleb over their diets. Tammy decided to end things with Caleb after he let his weight-loss journey slip and started gaining weight again. They had barely been together for five months when Tammy made the decision. Regardless, even if Tammy&#39;s marriage with Caleb was on the rocks, their failed relationship might have taught the 1000-Lb Sisters star that it&#39;s better to stay patient and wait for one&#39;s soulmate than rush into making another incorrigible mistake.



1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
