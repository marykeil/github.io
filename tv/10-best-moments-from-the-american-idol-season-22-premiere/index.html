<p>Meggie, an 18-year-old college student from Carmel, Indiana, blew the judges away with her sensitive and beautiful rendition of &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Make You Love Me&rdquo; by Bonnie Raitt. After her performance, all three judges gave her a standing ovation. Then, Luke and Katy&rsquo;s tables fell over, spilling everything onto the floor.

<p>9 Ajii Is A Diamond In The Rough
Sang &ldquo;Lose Control&rdquo; by Teddy Swims</p>
<p>Ajii, a 27-year-old nursing home security worker from Brooklyn, NY, revealed that he works the night shift, and when nobody&rsquo;s around, he sings in the hallways. His co-worker, Claire, heard him and convinced him to audition for American Idol. He grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he was exposed to many beautiful genres of music. However, his family didn&rsquo;t have the means for music school. Ajii shared that his hometown was his teacher. He explained that everyone&rsquo;s a musician or an artist, and being surrounded by it all made him keep doing what he&rsquo;s doing now.
Ajii&rsquo;s parents, Mohammad and Sabrina, emigrated from Pakistan &ldquo;with nothing.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re hard-working people who showed him that he should chase his dreams. Their dream was to give him and his brothers a great life. When Ajii began singing &ldquo;Lose Control&rdquo; by Teddy Swims, Lionel said, &ldquo;Hallelujah.&rdquo; At the end of his audition, all three judges gave him a standing ovation. Katy told Ajii that he was a &ldquo;diamond in the rough,&rdquo; and people like him are the reason that they do the show. Lionel told him that everything he does is &ldquo;so real,&rdquo; while Luke said that he &ldquo;just let it come from [his] soul and fly out.&rdquo;
Luke predicted that Ajii had a big chance of going pretty far in the competition, and Katy added that she thought he&rsquo;d make the Top 10. Ajii was then shown bringing his golden ticket home to Brooklyn. As he danced in celebration with his family, the camera zoomed in to the golden ticket hanging on the refrigerator. It was an inspiring moment, which made it seem that Ajii really could be an American Idol Top 10 contestant.</p>
<p>How To Watch American Idol Season 22 &amp; When It Premieres<br>
Here&rsquo;s when American Idol season 22 premieres and how fans can watch the search for the next music superstar on the singing competition series.</p>
<p>8 Micaela McCall Delivers A Fantastic Performance
Sang &ldquo;Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I&rsquo;m Yours)&rdquo; by Stevie Wonder</p>
<p>Micaela is a 28-year-old voice and piano teacher from Santa Barbara, California. She met her piano accompanist, Keith, when they were busking on State Street. One of their videos had 800,000 views on social media. She wowed the judges with her slowed down version of &ldquo;Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I&rsquo;m Yours)&rdquo; by Stevie Wonder, for which she received a standing ovation from all three of them.
The American Idol judges were very impressed because they&rsquo;d never heard the song done that way before. Luke marveled that he didn&rsquo;t know why Micaela hadn&rsquo;t already had a massive amount of success, and said that he could listen to her sing for the rest of the afternoon. Lionel said, &ldquo;I know what happened: the universe was saving her for us.&rdquo; Micaela is a truly gifted singer, and it&rsquo;ll be exciting to see how far she goes on American Idol.</p>
<p>7 Kennedy Reid Brings Life To The American Idol Auditions &amp; Sings A Duet With Luke
Sang &ldquo;River Deep - Mountain High&rdquo; by Ike &amp; Tina Turner</p>
<p>Kennedy is a 23-year-old mortician from New Albany, Indiana. As much as she loves being a mortician, her dream is to be a full-time singer. Kennedy&rsquo;s best friend, Jean Ann, accompanied her on the piano as she sang &ldquo;River Deep - Mountain High&rdquo; by Ike &amp; Tina Turner. After the song, Kennedy revealed that she and Jean Ann had known each other for one year, and had met at a John Conlee concert.
Jean Ann began to play John&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Rose Colored Glasses,&rdquo; to which Luke immediately began to sing along. He then pretended to be dead with Katy&rsquo;s encouragement, and laid on the judges&rsquo; desk. Kennedy sang in harmony with Luke, which Lionel loved. He felt that she was much more relaxed when she sang it and not &ldquo;on.&rdquo; In addition, he got to hear the texture in her voice. Katy thought that Kennedy seemed &ldquo;scared to death&rdquo; and wasn&rsquo;t sure if she was ready for American Idol, but she said that she was &ldquo;the kind of character&rdquo; that she wanted to throw in.
Despite their duet and saying that she had a big voice, Luke thought her performance felt &ldquo;a little bit pageanty.&ldquo;Luke said no for her to go to Hollywood, while Lionel and Katy said yes. Even though she didn&rsquo;t receive three votes of yes from the judges, Kennedy&rsquo;s performances were compelling enough that it&rsquo;ll be exciting to see her sing again in Hollywood.</p>

Mackenzie does social media for a living, creating prank-style videos that he said were &ldquo;kind of like wrestling in a kitchen.&rdquo;
Mackenzie is very close with his mom, and he said that there were no words to explain how much he loves her. However, he told her that she couldn&rsquo;t come to his audition because he&rsquo;d get too nervous. He thought it would be a better idea if his friend, Rodrigo, joined him instead. After Mackenzie received a standing ovation and rave reviews from the judges for singing &ldquo;Bring It On Home to Me&rdquo; by Sam Cooke, including Katy telling him that he could be Top 10, Ryan surprised him by bringing his mother in to hear the fantastic news that he was going to Hollywood.
Mackenzie cried as they hugged. It was a sweet and funny moment when he joked, &ldquo;Why do you guys do this to me? Girls are gonna be watching this.&ldquo;Luke and Katy assured him that girls love a guy who cries.

By the time he was 11, his mother, Hattie Mae, was with his stepdad, who he said was &ldquo;getting very abusive.&rdquo; They had to leave McIntosh, and &ldquo;everything went sideways just like that.&rdquo;
Triston shared that the lowest point was when he turned 12, and he and his mom had just become homeless and were sleeping on the sidewalk. His grandfather drove all the way from Alabama to Arkansas nonstop to get them. Triston shared that he never thought that he&rsquo;d be able to tell his story to American Idol, and it made him happy just thinking about it.
For his American Idol season 22 audition, Triston sang &ldquo;Cover Me Up&rdquo; by Jason Isbell. Lionel told him that his voice was a storytelling voice. Katy said that he was so authentic, so connected to himself, and singing from his soul. She was impressed that he was only 15 years old. Luke told Triston that he wanted to work with him.
Before the American judges gave Triston his golden ticket to Hollywood, they invited his mom into the room. Triston said that the opportunity meant the world to him, and it was a dream come true.

<p>4 The Judges Reverse Their Decision On Jack Blocker
Sang His Original Song &ldquo;I Was Wrong&rdquo;</p>
<p>For his American Idol season 22 audition, Jack, a 25-year-old graphic designer and artist from Dallas, Texas, sang an impressive rendition of his original song, &ldquo;I Was Wrong.&rdquo; When he was finished, Katy told him that he had a &ldquo;good-sounding voice,&rdquo; but he had some bad habits with the way he was delivering the song. She said that the performance felt &ldquo;put-on,&rdquo; he was really stretching to catch the notes, when he could just sing the notes instead, and be a little bit more relaxed about it.
Lionel told Jack that he was such an artist, but the judges knew his competition. Luke said that he thought that Paul Simon&rsquo;s audition would&rsquo;ve looked like Jack&rsquo;s, and said that he liked it, and it was different. He voted yes. Katy said no for Idol, but told Jack that she appreciated his artistry. Lionel also said no, which meant that Jack didn&rsquo;t receive a golden ticket to Hollywood. However, Luke wasn&rsquo;t happy about the decision, saying that he saw something in Jack, and Katy and Lionel let him go. He asked if they could bring Jack back in.
Luke then asked the crew, who&rsquo;d been introduced in an earlier segment, to vote. Many of them raised their hands for Jack, prompting Lionel to change his vote. Jack then received a golden ticket to Hollywood, ironically making the title of his song come true for the judges. He said that he watched the show for a long time and never saw votes flip like that, and it was pretty surreal. Jack said that it was &ldquo;always really cool just to have people in your corner, especially people that don&rsquo;t know you very well, and are just kind of getting an impression of you for the first time.&rdquo; It&rsquo;ll be thrilling to see what Jack does with his second chance in Hollywood.</p>
<p>3 Blake Proehl Gets A Second Chance In Life, Thanks To His Nana
Sang &ldquo;In Case You Didn&rsquo;t Know&rdquo; by Brett Young</p>
<p>Blake is a 24-year-old former pro football player from Charlotte, North Carolina. During his American Idol audition, he revealed that he wasn&rsquo;t used to performing because he&rsquo;d been an NFL wide receiver for three years. His father had played in the league for 17 years, and he grew up dedicating everything he knew to football. Blake signed with the Minnesota Vikings, but a severe injury forced him to stop. He was told that it&rsquo;d be a success story if he was able to run again in general. It was the toughest time for Blake, and he wasn&rsquo;t able to walk for so long, but music &ldquo;saved&rdquo; him.
Blake shared that his Grandma, whom he calls Nana, was the reason that he was auditioning for American Idol. She believed in him and gave him the confidence to try out. She stood next to him as he played the piano and sang &ldquo;In Case You Didn&rsquo;t Know&rdquo; by Brett Young. Katy got chills during his performance. When he finished singing, she joked with him and made him sign a pretend contract promising that he wouldn&rsquo;t leave the show. She told Blake that, if he allowed them to be his coaches, he&rsquo;d be Top 10. Luke told him that he sang the song in a believable way with innocence and vulnerability, while Lionel told him that he was &ldquo;natural.&rdquo;
Blake and his grandmother then informed his mom, who was waiting outside the audition room, that he made it to Hollywood. He said that he was going to frame his golden ticket and probably keep it at Nana&rsquo;s house because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where it all started.&rdquo; It was an inspiring moment that proved that second chances are possible in life.</p>

Sang &ldquo;Bring It On Home To Me&rdquo; by Sam Cooke</p>
<p>Odell is a 28-year-old airport security guard who was born and raised in Austin, Texas, but has lived in the Dallas area since 2000, so he considers that to be home too. He has five kids&ndash;an 11-year-old son, a 5-year-old daughter, a 4-year-old daughter, a 3-year-old daughter, and a 2-year-old son. Odell was six years old when he decided that he wanted to be a singer. He first started singing in church, and his mom taught him and his siblings how to sing.
Odell started music as a career at age 13, and he knew that it was all that he wanted to do. However, he took a break from music right around the time that his oldest daughter was born because he wanted to focus on being the best father that he could possibly be. He said that his kids are definitely the most important thing in his life right now, and the second most important thing is providing a great future for them. Odell worked the overnight shift at the airport, and he and his family were living in a hotel. He said that he wanted better for his kids because they deserved it.
During his American Idol audition, Odell sang a stunning version of &ldquo;Bring It On Home To Me&rdquo; by Sam Cooke. When he was finished singing, Lionel hugged him and told him that he had potential. Katy said that Odell was &ldquo;the best soul singer they have this season.&rdquo; Luke agreed, and said that he was incredible. He didn&rsquo;t know why Odell hadn&rsquo;t been discovered yet.
A week later, Odell was on a local news show in Dallas, Texas. He was surprised with a video of the judges telling him that they loved his audition so much that they decided to give him one of the three American Idol season 22 platinum tickets. In the past, the platinum ticket has come with perks such as skipping the first round of Hollywood Week. Odell cried, and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible. I don&rsquo;t really have the words right now to describe it. I&rsquo;ve been working really hard &hellip; Thank you so much.&rdquo; Odell said that he couldn&rsquo;t wait to see where the journey leads him, a sentiment that many viewers surely felt as well due to his inspiring story.</p>
<p>1 McKenna Breinholt Impresses With Her Stunning Vocals &amp; Meets Her Birth Family In Person
Sang &ldquo;There Was Jesus&rdquo; by Zach Williams &amp; Dolly Parton</p>
<p>McKenna is a 25-year-old esthetician from Gilbert, Arizona, who was adopted when she was born. She said that the family who adopted her has no musical talent at all. When she turned 21, McKenna asked her parents to tell her any info that they had about her birth mom. She just wanted to know where she came from. McKenna found out that her birth mom&rsquo;s name was Amy Ross Lopez, and she had passed away.
Amy was a musician, who even has some albums online, with her band, Nowhere Man and a Whiskey Girl. When McKenna listened to Amy&rsquo;s music, she instantly knew where she got her ear for music and voice from. She also feels that their voices sound the same. Last summer, McKenna came into contact with her entire birth family, and found out that they all sing. They met on FaceTime, and they&rsquo;d planned to meet in person about three weeks after McKenna&rsquo;s audition.
For McKenna&rsquo;s American Idol audition, she played the piano and sang an emotional version of &ldquo;There Was Jesus&rdquo; by Zach Williams &amp; Dolly Parton, which really showed her vocal and musical talent. She received rave reviews from the judges. Katy said that the song was &ldquo;beautiful,&rdquo; while Lionel called it &ldquo;gorgeous.&rdquo; Luke told McKenna that she was very in control of what she was doing, both with her voice and on the piano, and it was great. Lionel said that she had a &ldquo;story-telling, smoky voice,&rdquo; and he loved the &ldquo;little cry&rdquo; in her voice as well.
Meanwhile, outside of the audition room with Ryan, McKenna&rsquo;s mom, Lisa, revealed that she had invited McKenna&rsquo;s birth family to the audition, including her aunts, uncle, and grandma. McKenna&rsquo;s birth grandma, Ranelle, said that it was going to be &ldquo;like seeing a beautiful ghost, beautiful angel. Only she&rsquo;s gonna be alive, and I&rsquo;m gonna grab her.&rdquo; They were invited into the room for the final judgment, along with McKenna&rsquo;s adoptive family. When she saw her birth family, McKenna broke down crying.
Katy then asked McKenna if she knew any of her birth mom&rsquo;s songs. She said yes, and played and sang a song called &ldquo;Tumbleweed.&rdquo; Everyone cried, and her birth grandma sang along. McKenna thanked them for letting her do that. The judges then gave her a golden ticket to Hollywood. In her confessional, McKenna said, &ldquo;I feel extremely lucky and blessed that I have now two families who love and support me. This is the best surprise ever. I feel like I&rsquo;m for sure carrying on my birth mom&rsquo;s legacy, and I&rsquo;m excited to see where that goes. We&rsquo;re going to Hollywood. Amy, I did it. Hope you&rsquo;re proud.&rdquo; It was a truly beautiful moment, one of the best in American Idol history.
The American Idol season 22 premiere introduced viewers to ten contestants with amazing talents and inspiring life stories. Lionel, Katy, and Luke truly have a knack for discovering and nurturing the gifts within the contestants. It&rsquo;ll be very exciting to see how these ten contestants perform during Hollywood Week. American Idol season 22 began with some unforgettable entertainment. It already seems as though it could be the best season yet.
American Idol season 22 airs on Sundays at 8 p.m. on ABC.</p>
