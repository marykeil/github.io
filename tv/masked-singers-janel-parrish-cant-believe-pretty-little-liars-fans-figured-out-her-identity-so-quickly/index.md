## Literature Review
The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Gazelle, Janel Parrish, couldn&#39;t believe that Pretty Little Liars fans were able to identify her so quickly.




The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Janel Parrish, who placed third in the competition as Gazelle, couldn&#39;t believe that fans of her former show, Pretty Little Liars, were able to figure out her identity so quickly. None of the panelists--Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, or Nicole Scherzinger--guessed Janel correctly. Their final guesses included Ashley Tisdale (Robin and Jenny), Constance Wu (Ken), and Gina Rodriguez (Nicole). She concealed her identity the whole time from them. As Gazelle, Janel gave stunning performances, showcasing her stellar vocals.




In an interview with Us Weekly, Janel, who played Mona on Pretty Little Liars, revealed that Masked Singer viewers, who were PLL fans, figured out that she was Gazelle when they found clips of her singing on the teen drama. She said, &#34;I saw a hilarious comment from one of the PLL fans. They were like, &#39;You can’t hide, Mona, we know it’s you!&#39; I was like, &#39;Oh, wow.&#39; Those PLL fans, they’re little sleuths! They know what’s up. … There’s a whole network of PLL fans who were like, &#39;We know it’s you, Mona!&#39;&#34; A clue package contained a reference to Pretty Little Liars, which was a test paper with an A.

 Janel Parrish Lied A Lot While Competing On The Masked Singer 
          




Janel shared that, throughout The Masked Singer season 10, she had to lie to her family to keep her identity as Gazelle a secret from them. However, her aunt knew it was her right away. Janel explained, &#34;She said she thought that it was my voice, but then when she saw my mannerisms, even as Gazelle with the filter on my voice, she knew that it was me just from my body mannerisms.&#34; Janel confessed, &#34;I did a lot of lying — apparently some bad lying to some family members who were like, &#39;I know you’re lying, but it’s fine, you probably can’t tell me.&#39;&#34;


 

Janel was so impressive as Gazelle that Ken saved her from elimination with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell during the Group A finals. It was an especially significant moment because the panelists only had one save, and Gazelle was in the first group of competitors, which meant that they wouldn&#39;t be able to save anyone else after that. Throughout The Masked Singer season 10, Janel dazzled the audience with her incredible renditions of &#34;Uninvited&#34; by Alanis Morissette, &#34;The One That Got Away&#34; by Katy Perry, &#34;Lucky&#34; by Britney Spears, &#34;On the Radio&#34; by Donna Summer, and &#34;Chasing Cars&#34; by Snow Patrol.




As Gazelle, Janel brought so much talent and charisma to the Masked Singer stage. Her fans were able to identify her almost immediately, which is the mark of an authentic artist. One of her most triumphant moments on the show was when Ken saved her after she sang &#34;I Will Survive&#34; by Gloria Gaynor in the Battle Royale. The title of the song ending up ringing true for her. Hopefully, Janel will continue to pursue music in her career because she&#39;s incredibly talented. She performed like a seasoned star, with extraordinary vocal range and awesome dance moves. Janel was one of the best vocalists ever to appear on The Masked Singer.
