## Literature Review
Below Deck Down Under&#39;s Captain Jason is revealing how the Luke misconduct incident is shaping the way things will unfold on the upcoming season 3.




Below Deck Down Under is returning for season 3 and Captain Jason Chambers is revealing how Bosun Luke Jones’s sexual misconduct is going to affect production. The spin-off which premiered chronicles the lives of crew members who work and reside aboard a superyacht in northeastern Australia. Captain Jason became a fan-favorite thanks to his hands-on leadership skills and looks while he efficiently handled his job, especially the difficult situation between bosun Luke getting drunk and climbing into Margot Sisson’s cabin and getting into her bed. The same night that Luke went into Margot Sisson’s cabin, Laura Bileskalne went into Adam Kodra’s and tried to kiss and massage him.




Captain Jason spoke to InTouch recently where he addressed his handling of Luke and Laura being fired in the same episode. As per Captain Jason, NBC and Bravo are going to “put some policies and procedures in, and they’re going to implement them” going forward. “So there’s some more understanding from outside looking in that we can actually control some of,” Captain Jason added. He also wishes to implement some changes of his own, such as being an “advocate” for “no alcoholic beverages.” He sees it as something that would be great “from a captain’s point of view” because of how there’s a certain “safety aspect” to it.

 Captain Jason Is Left Out Of Below Deck Down Under Season 3 Discussions 
          




The more that Captain Jason looks back on the episodes, he tries to watch them from the audience’s point of view. Captain Jason revealed that he doesn’t prefer watching anything until the audience does. “I actually obviously will implement my own style going forward for season three,” the reality TV celeb declared. While he is not sure whether what he does will be in tune with NBC or Bravo, Captain Jason is sure that he will be putting in his two cents “as a captain” as he heads into season 3 of Below Deck Down Under.


 

However, Captain Jason confessed that he’s been “very much” left out of discussions for season 3 because that’s how “they operate.” Still, he likes that when the location is picked, he simply has to turn up to a boat and meet the crew. “Then I’ll get on with it,” he explained. This is a “pretty big essence” of the entire production of Below Deck Down Under. Captain Jason is kept “at an arm’s distance,” but he has no complaints about it. According to him, that’s what makes it more challenging for him, which is what he “actually really enjoys.”




There were chances that Captain Jason was not going to return to Below Deck Down Under. Considering he has a small daughter, viewers were left wondering if he was going to leave her behind to do his job because Captain Jason misses his family dearly while he is away. Now that it has been confirmed, viewers will get to see him lead another successful season. The show will likely have Captain Jason at the helm along with Chief Stewardess Aesha Scott making a return with a new cast, which, hopefully, won’t create drama that requires production to intervene again.
