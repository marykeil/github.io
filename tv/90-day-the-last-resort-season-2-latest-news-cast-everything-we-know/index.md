## Literature Review
With 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 now over, 90 Day Fiancé fans are already predicting couples for season 2. When does the new season release?




90 Day: The Last Resort has become one of the most refreshing 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs, and viewers want to if there will be a season 2. The drama and bombshell reveals made 90 Day: The Last Resort an instant hit among fans after its premiere in August 2023. The show offered a final attempt for 10 cast members to save their relationships as professionals decided whether they could heal and recover from their issues. Therapists Petey Silveira, Dr. Janie Lacy, and Dr. Jason Prendergast appeared in each episode as five couples navigated their issues at the Isla Bella Beach Resort in Marathon, Florida.




The group of couples included Yara Zaya, Jovi Dufren, Asuelu Pulaa, Kalani Faagata, Angela Deem, Michael Ilesanmi, Molly Hopkins, Kelly Brown, Liz Woods, and Big Ed Brown. They not only got to work on their own relationships but also got to know each other and work as a team for two weeks. Each couple had to decide if they wanted to stay together or move on at the end of the retreat. Kelly and Molly decided to quit the show halfway because their relationship was beyond repair, while Kalani’s boyfriend, Dallas Nuez, paid her a secret visit to the resort, leading her to officially end things with Asuelu.

 90 Day: The Last Resort Season 2 News 
          




On November 22, 2023, @90dayfiancecast, which is the official casting account for all 90 Day Fiancé shows, shared a casting call for “love sex life coaches and therapists.” While the name of the show wasn’t mentioned, the post addressed “innovative coaches with out-of-the-box therapy methods” for an “exciting reality show.” The now-deleted post encourages coaches with diverse backgrounds and methodologies who are willing to challenge “conventional norms and inspire change” to apply. The coaches will also be required to participate in “unconventional” activities for therapy. “Geography is not a constraint” for interested coaches as the show will be filmed in Arizona this time.



 90 Day: The Last Resort Season 2 Potential Release Window 

 




90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, episode 1, aired on August 14, 2023. The season included 12 episodes total, which makes it a shorter season compared to other 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs. The finale aired on October 30, 2023, and didn&#39;t have a Tell-All episode, even though viewers would have been interested in knowing if the recommitted couples actually ended up staying together. Filming for the show had seemingly begun in December 2022 when Colt Johnson had his trampoline accident in Reno and broke his leg. 90 Day: The Last Resort season 2 could start filming in December 2023/January 2024 and premiere sometime in August 2024/September 2024.



 90 Day: The Last Resort Season 2 Potential Cast 
          

In 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, five couples were cast. Colt and Vanessa Guerra were initially supposed to be on the show but were replaced by Molly and Kelly after Colt’s injury. This time around, the show could be looking at five couples who are in various stages of their relationships, whether they&#39;re dating, engaged, or married. One of the top contenders for the season is Miona Bell and Jibri Bell, who are rumored to be separated, as Miona is also flaunting a mystery man on her Instagram.




Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo and Sophie Sierra and Rob Warne might also add some drama to the show, considering they could be married by now after 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Big Ed and Liz might return as well since there is speculation they never actually got married in August 2023 and are now dating new people. Photos from the set were leaked for 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, and there&#39;s a chance the cast could be confirmed in the same way before the official announcement for season 2.
