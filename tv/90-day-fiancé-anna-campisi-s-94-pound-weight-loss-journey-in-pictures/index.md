Anna Campisi from 90 Day Fiancé has dropped nearly 100 pounds since featuring in season 7. The mom of four met her Turkish partner, Mursel Mistanoglu, in a bee enthusiast group. Since the two shared similar passions, they immediately connected despite the language gap and cultural differences. Anna and Mursel tied the knot in 2019 and settled in the United States. They made a successful business out of their knowledge of bees and started family planning. The couple began figuring out other ways to have a baby, knowing that they couldn’t conceive naturally.




In 2021, Anna and Mursel announced they had found a surrogate to help them. They revealed that they had discovered a Ukrainian woman who would love to carry their baby. Anna and Mursel welcomed their son, Gokhan, sometime in 2022. They shared the happy news via Instagram and shared that the network didn’t want to follow their story. After welcoming their baby in Ukraine, the couple went through numerous ups and downs. Thankfully, they finally united with him and brought him home. Anna achieved her milestone and started focusing on being a healthy mommy to Gokhan.
