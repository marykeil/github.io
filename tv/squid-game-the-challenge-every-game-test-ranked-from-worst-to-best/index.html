<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Squid Game: The Challenge includes both games and tests of character, each of which show off new sides of the players. Check out our complete ranking.</p>
<p>Squid Game: The Challenge has been a fascinating look inside the world of the popular South Korean drama full of intricate games and tests of character, some more interesting to watch than others. While the players on the original Squid Game dealt with harsher circumstances than those in the reality TV competition, things in Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 are difficult in a different way. While players may not deal with an untimely demise when they&rsquo;re eliminated, they are losing their shot at $4.56 million, and as the competition grows more difficult, the losses become harder to swallow. For players who have been competing, losing late in the game is devastating.
The games and tests on Squid Game: The Challengeoffer an interesting mix, some paying homage to the original Squid Game like Dalgona and Glass Bridge, while others are entirely new inventions, like Warships. The games themselves are, at times, more chance-based, while the tests of character included in the game are a striking look inside the psyches of the players. Pushing contestants to make difficult, sometimes cut-throat decisions, the tests show a nuanced element to the game that has captivated audiences. Many are wondering about the quality of the competitions, leaving no other solution but to rank them.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>13  Test 6: Allegiance Test
Players Pick Teams Until They Reach A Threshold</p>
<p>During Squid Game: The Challenge episode 6 player 182, retired professional basketball player TJ Stukes, was selected as the captain by the rest of the players. TJ was informed that he and 19 other players would be going into the next game, and the selection process would be a test. TJ was to pick one player, who would pick another player and so on and so forth until 20 players were standing on the platform, ready to play the next game. The players who weren’t chosen would be eliminated. While the test was interesting to watch, it wasn’t as high stakes or emotional as some of the other tests.</p>
<p>12  Test 1: Decision Test
The First Test Of Character Presents A Moral Dilemma</p>
<p>After passing through the first game on Squid Game: The Challenge, Red Light, Green Light, two contestants were tasked with peeling carrots as one of their daily chores. The players, player 101 and player 134, were given the ability to choose between giving someone else an advantage in the next game or eliminate a player of their choosing. While the pair debated their choice, it was ultimately clear that they should choose to eliminate someone they felt would be difficult competition. They decided to eliminate player 200, who had already been attempting to make alliances. Overall, this test was interesting for being the first test in the game, but basic.</p>
<p>11  Test 7: Die Test
Players Roll The Dice, Literally</p>
<p>During the Die test, the players who made it through Glass Bridge were tasked with taking turns rolling dice. Prior to their roll, they had to decide whether they would nominate themselves or another player for elimination. Once they made their choice, players would roll. If the die landed on 6, the nominated person would be immediately eliminated. The game ended when 3 players had been eliminated. Overall, the Die test was interesting for the players, but less interesting to watch as a viewer. Although the process of decision around who would be eliminated was still compelling, it didn’t hold as much weight as other Squid Game: The Challenge tests.</p>
<p>10  Test 4: Ddakji
Two Players Were Tested</p>
<p>Although Ddakji wasn’t exactly a Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 test, it was something that caused a bit of drama within the game. Player 232, Rick, and player 243, Stephen, were invited into the kitchen to perform a task. When they got to the kitchen they were invited to play the Korean game of ddakji. Both were nervous when Rick won the game that Stephen would be eliminated. When the guard entered, the pair were solemn, but Rick was simply given a chocolate bar. Though the test didn’t amount to anything, both Rick and Stephen were likely eliminated because of the suspicious faux-chore they were called to do.</p>
<p>9  Game 3: Warship
A High-Intensity Game Of Battleship</p>
<p>Warship, which is a life-sized game of Battleship, caused a huge amount of drama and some interesting shakeups to the competition. During the game, players were put into teams who would face off against one another. Two players were chosen to be the Captain and Lieutenant, while the rest of the players would sit in giant boats on the board. Teams went back and forth until they’d sunk two of their opponents’ warships, wherein the Captain, Lieutenant, and the players in the sunken ships would be eliminated. Warships was a replacement for the coveted tug of war, and while it was compelling, other games were more interesting overall.</p>
<p>8  Test 2: Phone Test
Temptation Overtook The Players</p>
<p>The Phone test was one of the earlier tests on Squid Game: The Challenge, and saw the guards bringing out a ringing phone and the players were all tempted to answer it. Once one of the players answered, a treat was brought out for the player who answered. While players apparently took turns answering the phone, the viewers only saw one treat-based phone call and got a burger and fries in the dormitory. The second time the phone rang on the series, the player who answered had to convince another player to take the phone to avoid elimination. The test was interesting, but ultimately didn’t live up to the others.</p>
<p>7  Test 5: Jack-In-The-Box Test
Five Players Take A Chance</p>
<p>The Jack-In-The-Box test happened shortly after the Warship game was completed, and many of the players were still on an adrenaline high from making it through the last Squid Game: The Challenge game. When the players gathered, they had a few minutes for five players to volunteer to participate in the test. The players who volunteered were all brought up to the platform and told to choose one jack-in-the-box. They opened their boxes, which could reveal an advantage, a task, or their immediate elimination. This test found seven players eliminated when it finished and caused quite a bit of drama when popular player 232, Rick, was chosen for elimination.</p>
<p>6  Game 5: Marbles
A Tragic Twist On The Schoolyard Classic</p>
<p>The Marbles game was disguised as a celebratory picnic for completing a chore in a certain timeframe, so it quickly turned sour when they realized that they would be competing head-to-head with the partners they’d chosen to innocently share a picnic with. During Squid Game: The Challenge episode 6, the players were tasked with playing a classic game of marbles. The winner would continue on in the challenge, while the loser would be eliminated. Marbles was a surprisingly emotional game, as many of the connections forged throughout the game were broken. The most heartbreaking elimination was easily player 302, LeAnn, who was beaten by her son, Trey, player 301.</p>
<p>5  Game 7: Circle Of Trust
The Players Take Guesses At Who Wants Them Out</p>
<p>Played like a classic game of 7-up or heads up, the remaining contestants were blindfolded and seated in a circle of desks. When a guard tapped them on the shoulder, each player would remove their blindfold one by one and place a gift box on another player’s desk, choosing who they’d like to eliminate. Once the player returned to their desk and put their blindfold back on, the players all removed their blindfolds and whoever had the present on their desk had to guess who they thought put it there.
If the guess was incorrect, the player was eliminated, but if the guess was right, the person who placed the box was eliminated. The Circle Of Trust was a fascinating look at strategic thinking and took out some of the strongest players left in the game, like controversial player 278, Ashley. This interesting game ended with just three Squid Game: The Challenge contestants remaining for the finale.</p>
<p>4  Game 1: Red Light, Green Light
The Classic Introductory Game</p>
<p>The first game on Squid Game: The Challenge was one of the most interesting to watch, though it was the least complicated. A typical game of Red Light, Green Light, players were to run from the starting line to the finish but had to pause with each “red light” signal. If anyone moved at all while the eyes of the robot girl were on them, they’d be eliminated. While Red Light, Green Light, may not have been the most interesting game to watch, it was the introduction to the majority of the cast. As a viewer, it was more compelling than some of the other games.</p>
<p>3  Test 3: Vote Test
Players Cast “Anonymous” Votes To Eliminate</p>
<p>Although the Vote Test was a quick test, it led to the shift in several dynamics within the cast of Squid Game: The Challenge. For the Vote Test, the players had to type the number of another player’s number into a machine and the three players with the most votes would be eliminated. Whenever a new player’s number was typed in, they’d appear on the large screen overhead. The test was an interesting push to change the dynamics in the game, and overall made many players doubt each other’s loyalties.</p>
<p>2  Game 6: Glass Bridge
A Strategic Game With A Twist</p>
<p>The Glass Bridge was originally the penultimate game on Squid Game but came a bit earlier on the reality competition. In Glass Bridge, players must make their way across a bridge with two types of glass tiles, one safe to stand on and one that contestants would fall through. Glass Bridge saw the players not only have to assign each other places in the competition but pushed them to work together until it wasn’t beneficial. Controversial player 278, Ashley, caused popular player 301, Trey, to fall despite saying she’d work with the team. Glass Bridge was a fascinating competition, leading to the eliminations of several major players in the game.</p>
<p>1  Game 2: Dalgona
A Test Of Persuasion &amp; The Iconic Game</p>
<p>The extremely popular challenge from the original Squid Game, the Dalgona cookie challenge was a huge part of Squid Game: The Challenge. While the decisions made prior to the game were difficult to watch with several players being eliminated prior to the game, the game itself was a shocking revelation. As the teams moved through the competition, many found themselves highly emotional as they tried to work with the temperamental cookie. The competitors on Squid Game: The Challenge did an incredible job, even for those who didn’t make it through the task.</p>
