## Literature Review
Dubai Bling season 2&#39;s &#34;Queen of Versace&#34; Zeina Khoury&#39;s feuding with Ebraheem Al Samadi. Learn about the reality star&#39;s background now. 




Dubai Bling star Zeina Khoury&#39;s known for her glamorous looks and feud with Ebraheem Al Samadi, and it&#39;s time to share information about her age, career and Instagram. Educated and sophisticated, Zeina&#39;s made her mark in the world - her self-confidence shows onscreen. She&#39;s a mature woman who knows what she wants. While she doesn&#39;t hesitate to get sucked into the Netflix series&#39; drama, there&#39;s more to her than snarky remarks and wild Versace prints. Versace is definitely &#34;the extrovert&#39;s fashion house&#34; - the brand&#39;s all about flaunting it, and she wears it like a boss. The outgoing Sagittarian Zeina&#39;s a powerful person who always hits the target.




In Dubai Bling season 2, the decadence is off the charts. Whether Fahad Siddiqui&#39;s looking at gigantic &#34;push present&#34; diamonds for Safa Siddiqui. (a yacht might not be good enough) or Ebraheem&#39;s showing off yet another splashy designer suit, every shot&#39;s the &#34;money shot.&#34; Sugar-sand beaches, desert zip-lining, glam dinner parties, palatial homes... could Dubai provide more grown-up pleasures? It&#39;s a playground for the rich. While it&#39;s literally sunshine and roses, people just can&#39;t get along. Conflicts push the narrative forward, and Zeina&#39;s in the mix, hanging onto resentment over Ebraheem&#39;s gauche season 1 office invasion.

 What Is Dubai Bling Season 2 Star Zeina Khoury&#39;s Age? 
Zeina Khoury Just Turned 40

 

Zeina was born on December 13, 1983, so she recently celebrated her 40th birthday. As the epic glamour showcased above illustrates, age is just a number. Ready for the catwalk in a short skirt and sexy boots, Zeina plays with her hair, showing off the effortless confidence that&#39;s sometimes interpreted as arrogance. It&#39;s a fine line between healthy self-esteem and egomania, and reality TV show stars often cross the line. While Zeina has her moments, she&#39;s so charismatic. The camera loves her.




Zeina looks like a model because she is one. Born in Lebanon, she won the genetic lottery. Blessed with height, striking bone structure and an in-your-face attitude, she really smolders in front of the camera. The most successful models are often very intelligent women. For example, Cindy Crawford was a high school valedictorian who won a chemical engineering scholarship. Models who are a cut above bring a lot of emotion into their expressions because there&#39;s plenty going on inside. Zeina&#39;s just like Cindy. She&#39;s got brains and beauty.

As the Instagram post above shows, Zeina&#39;s no shrinking violet. She&#39;s a queen and won&#39;t tolerate &#34;disrespect.&#34; That steely mindset may be the reason why she&#39;s gotten so far in her career. The phrase, &#34;nice guys finish last&#34; comes to mind, or even, &#34;snakes in suits.&#34; The fact that she&#39;s not a people pleaser frees her up to do whatever she wants. If someone gets offended, too bad. Since she&#39;s so strong, she gives off villain vibes. However, without villains, reality shows are unbearable. Someone needs to be unfiltered onscreen and stir up trouble. Zeina and Ebraheem mix like oil and water, and if they didn&#39;t, the show might be boring.




Zeina uses her education (she studied in London, England) and formidable drive to crush her goals and break through glass ceilings. She&#39;s a smart woman who&#39;s written about one of her areas of specialization, real estate. At Zeina&#39;s LinkedIn, she discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Dubai real estate scene, referencing Warren Buffett. She knows that even the darkest situations offer glimmers of hope and opportunity.

In the UK, she attended London Business School. She did that in 2023, and before then, she studied at the Wharton Online School. She also honed her knowledge at Columbia Business School. Her first educational achievement was earning a finance degree in her native Lebanon. Now, she&#39;s running High Mark Real Estate. In her role as the company&#39;s CEO, she oversees a range of elite properties. D1 Tower is in her portfolio and so is the ultra-glam Palazzo Versace. Since she wears the brand so well, some people call her the &#34;Queen of Versace.&#34;




Her fashion startup I Am The Company was featured in Dubai Bling season 2, and the clothes are available online at iamthecompany.com. It goes without saying that the brand&#39;s aesthetic mirrors Zeina&#39;s own style. Corset pants, strappy black dresses, jackets with tittilating cutouts and athleisure are offered, with many designs in anything-but-basic black. Throughout the collection, there are a few bold shots of color, including a backless hot pink jacket and a form-fitting sleeveless top in icy lime.

Zeina&#39;s Instagram account showcases her career and family. Her husband is Hanna Azzi. He also has an interesting job. Hanna is currently a general manager. He doesn&#39;t seem like a gold digger, as Zeina&#39;s costar Loujain &#34;LJ&#34; Adada does. He runs Nikki Beach Hotels &amp; Resorts EMEA. When it comes to social media, he lets his wife do the talking, preferring to keep a low profile. However, he does appear on her IG grid sometimes. One example is the post shown above. The duo have a couple of kids, Alexa and Joey. While work-life balance can be an issue for Zeina, as it is for so many working moms, her children look very happy.




Dubai Bling season 2 is a guilty pleasure, and Zeina&#39;s part of the reason why. She has a lot going on and juggles everything with ease. She&#39;s someone who&#39;s in control of her life. Her personality is strong, and she may be too much for some people. However, those who appreciate successful women who have a bit of attitude are bound to be charmed by the fierce entrepreneur. While she never backs down from a fight, she has more on her mind than petty drama. Zeina&#39;s someone who thinks big. Her vision is the reason why she&#39;s a reality TV star today. She imagined the perfect future and then made it happen.
