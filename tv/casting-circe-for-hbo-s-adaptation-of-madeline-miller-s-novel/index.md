## Literature Review

Actresses including Jenna Ortega, Vanessa Kirby, and Jessica Henwick would stun viewers as the lead in HBO&#39;s adaptation of Madeline Miller&#39;s Circe.




Bestselling-author Madeline Miller is famous for two young adult novels which are both reimaginings of Greek myths. Her first novel, The Song of Achilles, depicts the events leading up to and during the Trojan War from the perspective of Achilles&#39; lover Patroclus. Miller&#39;s second novel Circe follows the title character, a witch who is most famous for her brief encounter with Odysseus in The Odyssey. However, Miller&#39;s novel depicts a much more nuanced version of Circe. Circe is raised in the patriarchal setting of her father Helios&#39; house, where everyone is at the mercy of the gods&#39; whims.
Circe is &#34;not powerful and terrible, like her father, nor gorgeous and mercenary like her mother. But she has a dark gift of her own: witchcraft.&#34; The gods exile Circe to the island Aiaia because of her threatening power. At first, she is content on her island, befriending the animals and learning more about witchcraft. But she is disillusioned by her interactions with people and gods from the outside. Miller&#39;s version of Circe is a complex woman trying to assert herself in a world ruled by men and find a sense of peace – she poses a challenge to any actress cast to play her.









 








 10  Jessica Parker Kennedy 
Best known for playing Max in Black Sails (2014-2017) and Medusa in Percy Jackson and the Olympians (2023-Present).
        

Jessica Parker Kennedy has a talent for playing mysterious, powerful, and shrewd women. Kennedy plays Max in Black Sails, a prostitute who climbs the ranks and becomes the unofficial governor of Nassau. Furthermore, Kennedy’s recent appearance in Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians is another example of mythology reimagined to express feminist concerns. Kennedy delivers a powerful performance as Medusa, who recounts her tale to demonstrate the ways women are abused and manipulated in Greek mythology. Circe is undoubtedly one of those women as well, and it would be interesting to see Kennedy step into this similar role.
            
 
 10 Reasons Fantasy TV Shows Are Still So Hard To Adapt (Despite Fantasy Being Huge Right Now) 
Many studios have tried to recapture the success of Game of Thrones with their own fantasy shows. Here are the reasons why it&#39;s so difficult.








 9  Kathryn Newton 
Known for playing Abigail Carlson in Big Little Lies (2017-2019) and Cassie Lang in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023).
        

Kathryn Newton replaced Emma Fuhrmann as Scott Lang&#39;s teenage daughter Cassie in the most recent Ant-Man movie. It is easy to imagine her in the role of Circe, a young woman who is initially eager and slightly naive but becomes more calculated and defensive as time passes. From her recurring role as Abigail in Big Little Lies, Newton also has experience playing a daughter at odds with her parents. Newton is a rising star, with the movies Abigail and Lisa Frankenstein coming up. Both contrast with her previous performances and will give her the chance to shine in different roles.





 8  Sadie Sink 
Best known for playing Ellie in The Whale (2022) and Max Mayfield in Stranger Things (2017-2025).


 







Sadie Sink impressed everyone when she was added to the regular cast as Max in Stranger Things season 2. She gives an emotionally complex performance as Max – especially when Max becomes depressed following Billy&#39;s death – and could handle portraying Circe&#39;s feelings of loneliness, anger, and despair. Additionally, Circe&#39;s appearance is vague in the book: She is arbitrarily deemed unattractive, with yellow eyes like a hawk and brown streaks in her hair. But HBO could cast a redhead as a callback to Bernadette Peters as Circe in the 1997 TV miniseries version of The Odyssey.





 7  Jessica Henwick 
Best known for playing Bugs in The Matrix Resurrections (2021) and Peg in Glass Onion (2022).
        

Jessica Henwick is amazing in The Matrix Resurrections and the Knives Out sequel, Glass Onion. She is flexible in terms of genre, also starring in the recent thriller The Royal Hotel, as well as playing Nymeria Sand in Game of Thrones. Quite frankly, everyone should want to see Henwick in more movies and TV shows. Additionally, Bugs (Matrix) and Peg (Glass Onion) both bring moments of comedy to action and murder-mystery movies. Circe is a much darker story, but it would be interesting to see if Henwick can figure out how to include some morbid humor.





 6  Vanessa Kirby 
Best known for playing Princess Margaret in The Crown (2016-2023) and Martha in Pieces of a Woman (2020).


 







Vanessa Kirby gives a compelling performance as Princess Margaret in the first two seasons of The Crown. She perfectly conveys Margaret&#39;s sadness after her engagement to Peter Townsend ends, as well as her frustration with her subservient role in the royal family. She followed this up with an Oscar-nomination for Pieces of a Woman, in which she plays a woman mourning the death of her baby. Kirby delivers tearjerking performances, particularly in roles concerned with experiencing womanhood and motherhood within a strict social structure. These are also relevant themes in Circe, which is why Kirby would excel in the role.
            
 
 8 Fantasy Books That Are Getting Movies &amp; TV Shows 
Some of the most captivating TV shows and movies are in the fantasy genre, so here are 8 more fantasy novels that are being adapted for the screen.








 5  Ella Purnell 
Best known for playing Emma Bloom in Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home for Peculiar Children (2016) and Jinx in Arcane (2021-Present).
        

In Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home for Peculiar Children, Ella Purnell plays Emma, a teenage girl with aerokinetic abilities who lives at Miss Peregrine&#39;s home where she is protected from the outside world. Emma&#39;s life is noticeably similar to Circe&#39;s, but Purnell also appears in Wildlike, Kick-Ass 2, and Yellowjackets. Most recently, she has taken on the role of voicing Jinx in Arcane. Purnell conveys vulnerability, fury, and malevolence through her voice acting. It would be amazing to see her bring these same attributes to the live-action role of Circe.





 4  Alaqua Cox 
Best known for playing Maya Lopez/Echo in Hawkeye (2021) and Echo (2023-2024).
        

Alaqua Cox is immensely talented but has so far only starred in two of the MCU’s miniseries. Her character Maya is calculated and headstrong, first appearing as a sympathetic antagonist in Hawkeye. She is also now the protagonist of Echo, which further explores Maya’s relationship with her family as she continues to fight Wilson Fisk/Kingpin, who had her father killed. Cox has not had many Hollywood roles and deserves the chance to play another complex character. HBO could also incorporate her using sign language into Circe’s story.





 3  Daisy Edgar-Jones 
Best known for playing Marianne in Normal People (2020) and Kya Clark in Where the Crawdads Sing (2022).
        

Daisy Edgar-Jones previously played a young woman who is at home in nature. In Where the Crawdads Sing, she plays Kya, who spends most of her time in the marsh where she raised herself. Scenes of Circe exploring her island and interacting with the wildlife distinctly parallel Kya wandering through the marsh until she knows every plant, animal, and insect. Edgar-Jones also stars as Marianne in Normal People, the miniseries adapted from Sally Rooney’s novel of the same name. Edgar-Jones typically plays contemplative and curious characters, which is why she is also an excellent choice for Circe.
            
 
 10 TV Shows Stuck In Development Hell That We Really Want To Move Forward 
Some TV shows, such as the Aeon Flux reboot and Madeline Miller&#39;s Circe, have been in development for so long that fans doubt they will ever be made.








 2  Nina Dobrev 
Best known for playing Elena Gilbert and Katherine Pierce in The Vampire Diaries (2009-2017).
        

It is possible to argue that Circe lands somewhere between Elena Gilbert and Katherine Pierce. For most of The Vampire Diaries, Nina Dobrev portrays the romantic and kind-hearted protagonist Elena, as well as her evil look-alike, the wicked and clever Katherine. Throughout Miller’s novel, Circe searches for love and meaning, but is also Machiavellian at times. Since leaving The Vampire Diaries, Dobrev has taken on various roles in movies that do not do justice to her ability to give a multi-layered performance. Dobrev could play Circe at her most sympathetic and most devious.





 1  Jenna Ortega 
Best known for playing Tara Carpenter in the Scream movies (2022 &amp; 2023) and Wednesday Addams in Wednesday (2022-Present).


 







Of all the actresses suited to playing a witch, Jenna Ortega is one of the best. Ortega’s best-known character Wednesday Addams is, like Circe, manipulative when she needs to be. Everyone who has watched Wednesday knows Ortega can deliver deadpan lines like no one else. But she also conveys a sense of superiority and hidden knowledge.
At first, Circe is a welcoming hostess when men arrive at the island. After she is assaulted by a group of sailors, she never lets visitors have the upper hand again. At this point, Ortega’s ability to give the impression that she knows more than everyone else would be perfect. Most of all, it is easy to imagine her smirking just before the men surrounding her turn into animals. Miller’s Circe is a complicated character, but HBO has Ortega and a plethora of other talented actresses to whom they could offer the role.
