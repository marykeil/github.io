## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist spent Christmas with their own families ahead of their January 4, 2024 wedding.




The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist spent Christmas separately with their own families ahead of their live television wedding on January 4, 2024. Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, and Theresa, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, got engaged on the Golden Bachelor season finale. During the &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; part of the show, they announced that they were still together, and they&#39;d be getting married as soon as possible.




In an Instagram post, Theresa revealed that she and Gerry spent Christmas apart with their own families. 


 

Theresa posted three photographs with a caption that read, &#34;a Very Merry (Gerry) Christmas from us to you! I hope youâ€™re getting to spend time with your loved ones this holiday season. Gerry and I are celebrating with our own families but will be back together in just a few more days.&#34; Gerry&#39;s family consists of two daughters, Angie and Jenny, along with two granddaughters, Charlee and Peyton. Theresa has two children, Jenny and Tommy, along with six grandsons.

 What To Expect From The Golden Wedding 
          

Gerry and Theresa&#39;s Golden Wedding will take place on January 4, 2024. Many of the Golden Bachelor cast members are expected to attend, as they have become close friends with the couple since the show ended. After host Jesse Palmer officiated Mari Pepin and Kenny Braasch&#39;s wedding during the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale, fans speculated that he could do the same for Gerry and Theresa. However, their Golden Bachelor co-star, Susan Noles, is also a wedding officiant, so she could marry the couple instead. After the wedding, Gerry and Theresa will use the trip to Italy given to them by the show during the season finale as their honeymoon.

There&#39;s been some controversy since the Golden Bachelor ended, including revelations that Gerry might not have been entirely truthful about his career and dating history after his wife, Toni, passed away. However, Theresa and Gerry&#39;s separate Christmases seem to be more about logistics than any conflict between them. They&#39;ve expressed that, after their wedding, they&#39;ll most likely move to South Carolina to live together. This year, though, they spent Christmas with their own families.




Gerry and Theresa&#39;s relationship has moved very quickly since The Golden Bachelor began. However, they seem perfect for each other. Their connection began on the first one-on-one date of the season when they bonded about the losses of their spouses, but also about how they still had hope that they&#39;d find love again. They even danced with a flash mob to Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believin&#39;.&#34; Their relationship grew as they experienced a successful hometown date and a meaningful night in the Fantasy Suite. From their first meeting to their wonderful engagement, Gerry and Theresa have had a beautiful and inspiring relationship.
