## Literature Review
The extended 90 Day Fiancé franchise was full of controversial newcomers in the past year, but a number of cast members managed to earn support.




The 90 Day Fiancé franchise brought a ton of new content in 2023, though heroes came far and few. However, a number of cast members in the extended 90 Day Fiancé franchise managed to leave a mark due to their winning personalities. Meanwhile, a few 90 Day Fiancé franchise couples became popular among reality TV fans thanks to the many chaotic new shows that aired for viewers in the past year.
Fans of the extended 90 Day Fiancé franchise had plenty new storylines and narratives to follow in 2023. Familiar faces returned for shows such as The Family Chantelseason 5 and the new show 90 Day: The Last Resort. Meanwhile, new seasons of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Daysand90 Day Fiancé: The Other Wayboth aired. Although the majority of cast members actually behaved dramatically, there were a number of new standouts who had viewers rooting for them.









 








 8  Debbie Aguero Created Buzz 
        

Debbie Aguero earned a lot of early praise when she appeared on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4. The older woman injected much-needed humor into the dramatic season when she pursued a relationship with Morroco native Oussama. Debbie ended up recognizing her worth and dumping the decades younger man who was clearly using her. However, she then lost a portion of her popularity at the Tell All with her controversial takes. Despite this, she managed to be a breakout star in 2023. Debbie will next be appearing on 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.





 7  Jeymi Noguera Was A Standout 
        

Jeymi Noguera was the other star of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4. Unlike Debbie, Jeymi managed to retain a lot of her support. Her wife, controversial American Kris Foster, was the season villain due to her pathological lies. In contrast, Jeymi came across as a kind-hearted person who was genuinely looking for love. Jeymi earned overwhelming viewer support when the two women split up. However, she has yet to be cast in further franchise content. At the same time, there is a chance that a single Jeymi returns for something in the future.





 6  Single Chantel Everett Debuted 
        

The Family Chantel season 5 concluded the saga for the Everett and Jimeno families. It also allowed single woman Chantel Everett to reveal herself post-divorce from Pedro Jimeno. Chantel has received mixed reactions from viewers over the years due to her dramatic and meddling family. However, she had many fans siding with her during her messy divorce. Now, Chantel has the support of viewers as she goes on to find love after Pedro. Chantel stood up for herself during The Family Chantel season 5 and will now look for love during 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.





 5  Kirsten Schoemaker Earned Support 
        

90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 newcomer Kirsten Schoemaker had the majority of viewers siding with her over her ex Julio Moya. Kirsten and Julio only appeared in the first half of the season, as Julio dumped Kirsten over video chat. However, she managed to stay classy and dignified despite his treatment. In contrast, Julio tried his hardest to ruin her reputation at the Tell All. Kirsten came off as sane, kind, grounded, and logical in comparison to her ex. She also ended up being arguably the most normal cast member out of her season.





 4  Cleo Corraine Won Sympathy 


 







90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 newcomer Cleo Corraine also won fan sympathy and support by the end of her season due to her relationship with American Christian Allgood. Christian created controversy because he was always chatting up women and he was hesitant to be with a trans woman. Cleo, who is a trans woman, came across as a sweet person who was hoping for the best in her relationship despite red flags. Therefore, many viewers were happy when they heard that the couple split up. Unfortunately, Cleo recently took Christian back, as they appeared to be mending things





 3  Sophie Sierra Is Making A Splash 
        

90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomer Sophie Sierra is currently making an impression even though her partner, Rob Warne, is easily a season villain. Rob and Sophie have a messy relationship to say the least, as Rob has cheated on Sophie multiple times. Sophie, who is nearly a decade younger than the American, seems kind and relatively grounded during their season. She asks for reasonable things, such as an indoor bathroom, and expresses her emotions as best as she can. The British bombshell is currently building a large following online due to her popularity.





 2  Gabe Paboga &amp; Isabel Posada Won Hearts 


Only two new franchise couples really impressed viewers in 2023, and 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4 newcomers Gabe Paboga and Isabel Posada were two of them. Gabe and Isabel revealed their real love for each other as they overcame Gabe telling Isabel’s family that he is a trans man, as well as dealing with family drama on Gabe’s end with his sister. Gabe and Isabel formed a beautiful blended family and demonstrated genuine love for each other. They also supported each other and accepted one another&#39;s authentic selves.





 1  David Dangerfield &amp; Sheila Mangubat Amassed Fans 


 







Finally, the biggest standouts in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise in 2023 had to be 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 couple David Dangerfield and Sheila Mangubat. David and Sheila didn’t have an easy story, as David struggled to find love in a hearing world as a deaf man. Meanwhile, Sheila lost her mother in a terrible accent during filming. However, David and Sheila stood by each other’s sides throughout their heartbreak and challenges. David and Sheila are one of the most genuine couples in recent franchise history. They certainly have many viewers rooting for them to receive a hasty visa approval.
90 Day: The Single Life Premieres Monday, January 1, 2024, at 8 p.m. ET On TLC
