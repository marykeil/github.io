## Literature Review
Jasmine and Gino may have split after he visited a strip club in secret, but the 90 Day Fiancé couple is surprising fans with some exciting news.




Congratulations are in order as 90 Day Fiancé couple Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda are married. Jasmine is a 36-year-old Panamanian woman who&#39;s become a fan-favorite in the franchise thanks to her entertaining personality. While Jasmine&#39;s temper and suspicious nature create issues between her and Gino, 53, the couple have starred in back-to-back spin-offs since 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Gino proposed to Jasmine after meeting her on a sugar daddy website. Jasmine came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa during 90 Day Fiancé season 10, but things didn&#39;t get any better between them.




However, if 90 Day Fiancé fans expected Jasmine and Gino to split before their 90 days were up, they&#39;ve proved everyone wrong by getting married. InTouch has confirmed the happy news about the reality TV pair. Jasmine moved to Canton, Michigan, in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. While she described Michigan as &#34;h***&#34; for being cold compared to the sunny Panama City, Jasmine and Gino got married in the same state. Jasmine tied the knot with Gino a few months ago, in June 2023. A Wayne County, Michigan, clerk confirmed the news to the publication, thus revealing that Gino and Jasmine&#39;s current storyline ends on a happy note.


 Jasmine &amp; Gino&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Jasmine and Gino&#39;s storyline in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 is about them discovering shocking secrets about each other that could stop them from getting married. Jasmine used the wedding dress allowance that Gino gave her to get butt implants. The money wasn&#39;t enough, so she took some more from her ex-boyfriend, Dane. While Jasmine eventually had to tell Gino about the surgery, she didn&#39;t tell him about Dane. Meanwhile, Gino took a year-long break from his job to spend more time with Jasmine in America and to help her get comfortable. Gino told her about this only after she came to the U.S.





 

Jasmine planned on bringing her two sons with her to America. Gino not having a job put her plans in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Jasmine also had to try and get along with Gino&#39;s family, who had already assumed she was a gold digger. Jasmine found a used lip gloss tube underneath her seat in Gino&#39;s car. Gino responded awkwardly when she asked who it belonged to. She suspected it belonged to a female colleague whom Gino had been hanging out with. While he assured her he wasn&#39;t cheating on her, she tried to take her mind off the incident and went for a nail session with his sister-in-law Michelle.

Michelle innocently told Jasmine that Gino had a bachelor party a day before she came to America. Also, the bachelor party was at a strip club. Jasmine decided she&#39;d had enough of Gino&#39;s lies and threw away the engagement ring in the latest episode of 90 Day Fiancé. She told Gino she was going back home to Panama. While the preview of the next episode does not show what happens between Gino and Jasmine after their split, them getting married does confirm that they patched up once again and hoped for a happily ever after.
