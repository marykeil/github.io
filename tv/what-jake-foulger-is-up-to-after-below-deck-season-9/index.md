## Literature Review
Jake Foulger appeared as a cast member on Below Deck season 9. What has he been up to since?




Jake Foulger made a lasting impression during Below Deck season 9, but there&#39;s curiosity surrounding what he&#39;s been up to since leaving the show. He has become well known for his onscreen hookups with Fraser Olender and Rayna Lindsey and for being open about his relationship with ex-fiancee Paris Field. Jake was a fan-favorite Below Deck deckhand, and it was upsetting when he wasn&#39;t at the reunion. He was best known for being naked most of the time and for his fun-loving personality. As Below Deck season 11 approaches, it&#39;s time to revisit the former cast member.




Since Below Deck wrapped, Jake has undergone some significant changes, and one of the main questions surrounding his departure was why he didn&#39;t attend the reunion. Jake has been going through a lot in his personal life. His then-fiancee Paris later broke off the engagement, and he has been very open about his mental health. After the show wrapped, Jake went home to London and told fans he needed to take care of himself. However, the show had nothing to do with his issues.

Taking to Instagram, Jake did a Q&amp;A regarding his absence at the reunion. Fans were quick to comment on the fact that they could not wait to see him at that event. However, Jake responded to some questions, saying he would not be a part of the Below Deck reunion. One follower asked, &#34;Why won&#39;t you be at the reunion?&#34; Jake responded that he had &#34;broken his brain.&#34;




He expressed to viewers that he dealt with a lot, even before appearing on the show, and he is taking time to fight his demons and work on himself. Even though Jake didn&#39;t elaborate, he did say that he had been in therapy to resolve some problems. He concluded that he wanted to be open about his mental health and would continue to try to help others by sharing his story.

On his Instagram, Jake posts pictures of his loved ones and the great outdoors, and his photos show him spending time with friends and family. He still believes that his time on the show was a great experience, and he&#39;s not saying no to coming back. In fact, he let fans know that he would go back on the show. However, he wants to focus on himself for now. Jake hasn&#39;t officially given up on Below Deck, which is excellent news as he is such an entertaining and quirky character to watch.




He&#39;s interested in enhancing his mental health and taking time to work on himself. Fans are happy to see that Jake is taking such important steps. With his admission that he is not yet done with Below Deck, viewers are excited to see what will be next for him. There is hope that he will reappear on screens again, and there is ample support for his health, love life, and career.
