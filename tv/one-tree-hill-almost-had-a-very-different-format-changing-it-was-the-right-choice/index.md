# One Tree Hill Almost Had A Very Different Format (&amp; Changing It Was The Right Choice)


## SUMMARY 



  One Tree Hill was originally intended to be a movie called Ravens but was later developed into a TV series.   The name of the series was changed from Ravens to One Tree Hill to better reflect the broader premise of the show.   Turning One Tree Hill into a TV series allowed for more character development and the exploration of various topics and issues.

## Literature Review
Before it became a beloved teen drama TV series, One Tree Hill was almost a different kind of project, but thankfully, the format was changed.




One Tree Hill remains one of the best teen dramas to this day, but the hit TV series was almost developed in a completely different format. Created by Mark Schwann, One Tree Hill centers on the residents of a fictional small town in North Carolina called Tree Hill. The initial premise revolved around two half-brothers, Lucas and Nathan Scott, whose rivalry blossoms into friendship after Lucas joins the Tree Hill Ravens, their high school basketball team of which Nathan is the team captain and star player. One Tree Hill explores the lives of the Scott boys and their friends and loved ones, including their shared father, the deplorable Dan Scott.




One Tree Hill ran for nine seasons from 2003-2012. The show evolved from a teen drama after the central teen characters graduated from high school at the end of season 4, experiencing a five-year time jump in season 5 to focus on their lives post-college. Over the course of nine seasons, viewers were able to watch these once-teen characters grow up and become adults. However, before it turned into such a long-running series, One Tree Hill was originally conceptualized in a totally different medium.

                  One Tree Hill Cast: Where Are They Now?   One Tree Hill was a hit 2000s teen drama and made stars out of Chad Michael Murray, Hilarie Burton, and more. What are the actors up to now?    


 One Tree Hill Was Originally Supposed To Be A Movie 
The series creator wrote the initial premise as a feature film
          

In the documentary Building a Winning Team: The Making of One Tree Hill that was released after season 1 aired, executive producers Mike Tollin and Joe Davola discussed how Schwann had initially written One Tree Hill as a movie with a very different title. Before becoming One Tree Hill, the series &#34;had its first life as a feature project called Ravens,&#34; Tollin revealed. Schwann sent the producers a short 25-page script for Ravens with the intention of developing it into a full-length film.




After reading the script, Tollin and Davola approached Schwann about pursuing the project, but there was a catch. They were interested in the premise but believed that Ravens should be a TV series instead of a movie. &#34;While it would have been exciting to spend two hours in this world with these characters,&#34; Tollin had told Schwann, &#34;imagine developing a series and having the potential to spend a hundred and some hours with these characters in this world.&#34;

                  15 One Tree Hill Moments That Made Fans Cry   One Tree Hill kept fans guessing until the final season, but some moments caused more than gasps. These moments caused the most tears and heartbreak.     



 Why One Tree Hill Became A TV Show Instead Of A Movie 
The title was changed when the project became a TV series
          

Initially, Schwann was adamant that Ravens should be a movie, but Tollins and Davola refused to give up. They pursued Schwann for four years about the project, insisting that it would be better as a series. Eventually, Schwann gave in and agreed to develop the concept as a show instead. Ravens was then redeveloped as a TV series for the WB, which included a name change.






In 2006, The WB merged with UPN to form a new network called The CW. From season 4 onwards, One Tree Hill aired on The CW.




According to Schwann, the network wasn&#39;t &#34;in love with the title&#34; because &#34;they felt like it was too sport-centric,&#34; since Ravens was the name of the basketball team. While basketball is at the core of the series, it&#39;s likely that the network wanted the title to reflect the more broad premise—the drama and history between the residents of a small town in North Carolina—rather than limit the scope of the focus to the sport itself.

The series was eventually renamed One Tree Hill after the U2 song of the same name on the band&#39;s 1987 album, The Joshua Tree, which Schwann had on heavy rotation while writing the original script. The song itself is about a volcanic island and surrounding suburban neighborhood in Auckland, New Zealand called One Tree Hill. Presumably, Schwann suggested the title with the intention of naming the fictional town in the series Tree Hill.




The network loved the new title, but it confused viewers a bit. After the first six or so episodes aired, Schwann got word from the network that the audience didn&#39;t understand what &#34;One Tree Hill&#34; was supposed to mean. To explain the meaning of the title, Schwann decided to spell it out for viewers in the season 1 finale, &#34;The Games That Play Us,&#34; by having Lucas&#39; mom, Karen, remind him that &#34;there is only one Tree Hill, and it&#39;s your home&#34;—essentially, the town is special and cannot be replaced.



 Making One Tree Hill A Series Was The Right Choice 
One Tree Hill was able to thrive with some breathing room
         

While a series could have always been adapted from the Ravens movie, like fellow teen sports drama, Friday Night Lights, One Tree Hill was better off as a TV series from the start. Despite its initial low ratings, One Tree Hill quickly found its footing and gained a dedicated audience who tuned in every week to watch the drama unfold. The series&#39; nine-season run proves that it was able to maintain interest in stories about this world and its characters for years. Had the project been a movie as intended, it wouldn&#39;t have maintained the same longevity, even if it was popular enough to launch a franchise of sequels.




The TV show format allowed One Tree Hill to explore so many more topics and issues than a movie would have had the space to. The series was also able to really expand and flesh out its characters and build strong familial, romantic, and platonic bonds and relationships between them. Many of these characters, like Nathan and Brooke, underwent immense character development and are practically unrecognizable in the first episode compared to the last, which would&#39;ve been much harder for one movie to accomplish. Ultimately, it was the right call to turn One Tree Hill into a TV series.
