## Literature Review
Netflix is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of My Hero Academia, but its live-action adaptation will have numerous challenges to overcome.




Netflix intends to bring a live-action adaptation of My Hero Academia to the small screen, but the streamer faces numerous challenges in telling Kohei Horikoshi&#39;s story in this format. My Hero Academia is one of the biggest shōnen anime currently airing, and it&#39;s no surprise the streamer wants to capitalize on its popularity, especially after finding success with its live-action One Piece. Done correctly, Netflix&#39;s My Hero Academia could shepherd in a new era of anime adaptations on the streamer, welcoming a new generation of viewers with it.
This is assuming the streamer gets the details of My Hero Academia right, an undertaking that may be more difficult than it seems. The world of My Hero Academia is well-suited to its long-form manga and anime format, but it may not land as well in live-action. There are numerous obstacles this iteration of the story will need to overcome to capture the magic of the original.
            

 10 My Hero Academia Scenes We Can&#39;t Wait To See In Netflix&#39;s Live-Action Adaptation 
My Hero Academia contains many heartfelt moments and thrilling action sequences for viewers to look forward to in Netflix’s live-action adaptation.




 8  Capturing My Hero Academia&#39;s Huge Cast Will Be Challenging 
        

My Hero Academia boasts a huge cast of characters, and the manga and anime do a fairly decent job of balancing them. Horikoshi&#39;s story gives adequate attention to supporting players, whether they&#39;re Izuku Midoriya&#39;s classmates at U.A. High or the Pro Heroes he looks up to. Unfortunately, a live-action adaptation is unlikely to take this approach, even in a TV format. Netflix shows tend to have anywhere from eight to 10 episodes per season, while the My Hero Academia anime typically boasts more than 20 installments per outing (with season 1 being a 13-episode exception).
Given the shorter seasons, Netflix&#39;s My Hero Academia adaptation will need to make cuts to the original story. These are likely to come from the supporting characters&#39; subplots, meaning viewers won&#39;t get to know Class 1-A, Class 1-B, and the Pro Heroes as well as they do in the original story. Additionally, such a large ensemble may be confusing for newcomers, another incentive for Netflix to cut back.





 7  My Hero Academia&#39;s Story May Need To Be Condensed 
        

In addition to its supporting cast presenting a challenge, My Hero Academia&#39;s story is fairly long for a live-action show or movie. This isn&#39;t preventing Netflix from adapting One Piece, but like the earlier series, its live-action My Hero Academia will probably need to be condensed. It&#39;s unclear whether the streamer intends to make movies or a TV series, and there&#39;s no word on how long it intends to keep its adaptation going. However, some parts of Deku&#39;s story are likely to meet the chopping block. Given how almost every manga and anime arc contributes to his growth, choosing what to get rid of will pose another challenge.





 6  The Anime&#39;s Colorful Aesthetic Won&#39;t Work In Live-Action 
        

It&#39;s clear My Hero Academia draws its inspiration from comics, and its colorful aesthetic is a testament to that. From Deku&#39;s bright green hair to the almost-always blue sky in the background, the anime has a unique look that just won&#39;t be possible to recreate in live-action. The real world isn&#39;t anywhere near as colorful as Deku&#39;s, but it&#39;s difficult to envision the backdrop of My Hero any other way. Netflix&#39;s adaptation will need to find a way to stand out without this aspect of the anime, which could prove an obstacle for the streamer.





 5  Some Quirks Are Unlikely To Translate Well To Live-Action 


My Hero Academia is set in a world where most people are born with Quirks, or powers that give them extraordinary appearances and abilities. The manga and anime introduce a wide array of Quirks throughout their runs, and some of these will be difficult to capture in live-action. While CGI can go far for Deku&#39;s use of One for All, Bakugo&#39;s explosions, and even Todoroki&#39;s fire and ice, physical Quirks like Tokoyami&#39;s are unlikely to look as good in the Netflix adaptation.
Capturing characters with a bird head or the appearance of a whale is going to be difficult in the first place, but such players will also require near-constant CGI. And even characters with otherwise ordinary appearances have Quirks that may not look great in live-action. Kirishima&#39;s hardening or Mirio&#39;s permeation are going to require a lot of effort to look seamless in this format.





 4  My Hero Academia&#39;s Fights Won&#39;t Look As Good In Live-Action 

Quirks aren&#39;t the only aspect of My Hero Academia that won&#39;t look as good in live-action. The anime&#39;s fight sequences are among its greatest strengths, and it&#39;s hard to imagine them landing as well in another format. While certain Quirks can be replicated using CGI, it&#39;ll be exceedingly difficult to make them look good in action. That&#39;s not to mention that capturing the emotional stakes of My Hero&#39;s fights — which are a huge part of what makes them so compelling — will be a challenge for the adaptation. Deku&#39;s early injuries may also look too gruesome in live-action, though they&#39;re an unavoidable part of him learning to use One for All.





 3  Some Characters&#39; Behavior Will Need To Be Toned Down In Live-Action 
        

Over-the-top behavior is par for the course with anime, whether it&#39;s characters crying all the time, having angry outbursts that would be more off-putting outside of animation, or even making suggestive comments. All of these things happen in My Hero Academia, with Deku bursting into tears frequently during the early episodes, Bakugo irrationally exploding, and Mineta showcasing perverted behavior that&#39;s even criticized in the anime. These things don&#39;t seem that out there in an animated series, but they&#39;ll likely come off as more cringe-worthy in a live-action series. Netflix&#39;s My Hero Academia may need to tone down some of its characters&#39; more extreme behaviors if it wants to succeed.





 2  My Hero Academia Could Suffer From Superhero Fatigue 

One Piece may have broken the anime adaptation curse, but the series doesn&#39;t have nearly as much competition as My Hero Academia. There aren&#39;t a ton of pirate shows out there currently, but superhero media is abundant — and judging by Marvel and DC&#39;s recent movies, it&#39;s a genre that people are growing weary of. Shows that shake up the formula, including Amazon&#39;s The Boys and Invincible, manage to find an audience. However, this is just further proof that Netflix&#39;s My Hero Academia will need to work harder than One Piece to stand out.





 1  Anime Adaptations Still Have Bad Reputations To Overcome 
        

In addition to setting itself apart in the superhero genre, Netflix&#39;s My Hero Academia also needs to prove itself as a live-action anime adaptation. Although One Piece offers hope, mainstream anime adaptations still have negative reputations after a number of failed projects, including Netflix&#39;s Death Note. Fans of an original series are typically skeptical about such adaptations, so My Hero Academia will need to grab attention with its trailers and promotional images, proving that it&#39;s worth giving it a chance.
The My Hero Academia anime is currently streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll.
