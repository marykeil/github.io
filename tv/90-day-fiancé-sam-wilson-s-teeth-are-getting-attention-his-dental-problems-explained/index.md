 Sam Was Dealing With Opiate Addiction 
          

Sam opened up about overcoming years of addiction that started when he was just a teen during his first episode of 90 Day Fiancé. Sam said it was difficult for him to get the job that he wanted because of his drug past. He got addicted to pain medicine when he was 15 years old and stayed addicted to it for quite a few years. Sam said that being addicted to opiates made him a “really cold, numb person.” It made life hard for him, and he couldn’t maintain any long-term relationships. Sam was sick every other day while he tried to buy drugs on the street.




Sam was living in a “dirty, ugly world” until he got clean at 22. However, Sam wasn’t completely sober as he had relapsed a few times and was still struggling. Sam started seeing a Suboxone doctor when he was 22. “It’s still kind of like an opiate. It keeps you from getting sick going through withdrawals,” he explained. Sam was arrested while he was on a business trip with a coworker. The police pulled him over when they found Suboxone which wasn’t in a prescription bottle. Sam was offered a diversion program to avoid jail time, but he had missed the deadline to file the application.



 Sam Looks Drastically Different In Before &amp; After Photos 

 

While it’s yet to be revealed if Sam ended up going to jail after he married Citra on 90 Day Fiancé, there are other mysteries about Sam that fans think need some unraveling. Reddit user u/Kewchie-Lord567 discovered old photos of Sam from his Facebook which were seemingly from the time he was 14 or 15 and presumably not addicted to opiates yet. Viewers noticed how Sam looked different back then, and it wasn’t because he was 15 or so years younger than he is in 2024, but because “he definitely lost his bottom teeth, or most of them” as per user sansfards.




“Methadone, the drug that is used to treat opiate addiction, can cause your teeth to rot out over time too,” wrote tapatiocholula, while BiteOhHoney added, “So does Suboxone. It eats the enamel on your teeth.”



 Does Sam Have Bottom Teeth? 

 

However, Sam is insisting that he hasn’t lost any teeth even if he did have poor dental hygiene. Sam hoped for people to “think before they speak” so he decided to tell them his own story. Sam said that his family “didn’t have the best upbringing” and his parents were fighting a lot, so he was neglected a lot as a child. “My teeth being one of them and yes I have bottom teeth,” Sam added. The 90 Day Fiancé star claimed that he has the jawline courtesy of his “dad side” and that all of his dad’s family has the “same jaws” because they have “part of Irish.”






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
