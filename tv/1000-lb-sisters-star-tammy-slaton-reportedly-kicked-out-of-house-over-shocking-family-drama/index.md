## Literature Review
1000-lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton may be dealing with one of the most difficult moments in her life, but her family is still holding her accountable.




1000-lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton may be going through one of the toughest times in her life, but her family is still holding her accountable for her actions and may have kicked her out according to recent reports. Still reeling from the death of her husband, Caleb Willingham, Tammy has been doing her best to keep herself afloat as she&#39;s moved through her grief. Leaning on her family, Tammy has been dealing with her personal struggles alongside trying to care for her health sustainably after having weight loss surgery in early 2023. While she may be having a hard time, Tammy&#39;s family isn&#39;t treating her with kid gloves.




According to a source close to the family, Tammy has been kicked out of her Kentucky home by her sister Amanda Halterman, who owns the house. &#34;She was renting it from her sister, Amanda...and they just do not get along at all,&#34; a source told The Sun. They shared that while Tammy and Amanda may not be close, she was renting her home from her sister and has since &#34;had to move in with her brother Chris because she lost her house.&#34; Though Tammy&#39;s family has been caring for her through hardship, it&#39;s possible things became too much for Amanda.


 Tammy Slaton &amp; Amanda Haltermanâ€™s Relationship Explained 
          

While Tammy may be close with her sister Amy Slaton, who&#39;s showing off her new relationship after splitting from her husband Michael Halterman, the rest of the family has more difficulty in their relationships with Tammy. Amanda, who&#39;s five years older than Tammy, has been a massive help to both Tammy and Amy throughout their lives. As adults, Amanda has helped to care for both Tammy and Amy throughout their weight loss surgeries and illnesses, but Tammy hasn&#39;t always been thankful to Amanda. Even though Amanda has been a help to her sister, Tammy is resentful about the fact that Amanda feels like she has any control over her.





 

While Tammy and Amanda&#39;s relationship may be rocky, they&#39;re still family and will continue to treat each other as such. As 1000-lb Sisters season 5 gets underway, the drama surrounding the Slaton family is at an all-time high. Between Tammy&#39;s relationship with Caleb before his tragic death playing out on screen to Amy&#39;s divorce from Michael likely being one of the most dramatic moments of the series, the issues the Slaton sisters are facing are heavier than ever, while they&#39;re at their lightest. Between dealing with their health and grappling with their personal issues, the family is going through a rough patch.

With Tammy still reeling from her husband&#39;s passing, things have been markedly difficult for her in the past several months. After being arrested for alleged drug possession, Tammy has clearly been spiraling and fighting with her family throughout her grieving process. Her being kicked out of Amanda&#39;s house may seem harsh, but it&#39;s possible that Tammy&#39;s sister was just looking out for her best interest. As 1000-lb Sisters season 5 begins to reveal the truth behind the rumors, viewers will be paying close attention to the relationship between Tammy and Amanda.
