## Literature Review
Gino Palazzolo can&#39;t hide his tears during a vulnerable moment in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 after hearing Jasmine Pineda&#39;s shocking admission.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is making Gino Palazzolo cry after promising she can change a big thing in their relationship. Gino is a 53-year-old man from Canton, Michigan, who met Jasmine, 36, online and went to meet her in person in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Gino and Jasmine’s chemistry was undeniable, but they were also total opposites of each other. Jasmine was bold and brazen, while Gino looked like he was a pushover who let Jasmine do whatever she wanted. Gino gave in to Jasmine’s most outlandish demands, especially when it came to money.




However, Gino did not like it when Jasmine badmouthed his family, and a preview clip from 90 Day Fiancé season 10, courtesy of ExtraTV, reveals that Gino is finally getting what he wants.


 

Jasmine and Gino are enjoying their last date together in Miami as they cheer for their “bright future in all ways.” Jasmine tells Gino that she never dreamed that “someone like” Gino would become her life partner. She said she preferred men like her ex-boyfriend Dane, but she knows that what she has with Gino “is real love.” Jasmine admits that she’s “so b****y all the time” and wants to be “a better person,” which makes Gino tear up.

 Will 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Jasmine Keep Her Promise To Gino? 
          

Jasmine confesses she should feel thankful for meeting Gino. She wants to learn to be kind from Gino. Jasmine promises him that she’s ready to fight her emotions to become a better person. “Even complaining about your family, and not wanting them at my wedding,” she adds. As soon as Jasmine sees Gino getting teary, she wants to know what happened. It&#39;s Jasmine telling Gino that she will try to get along with his family that makes Gino so emotional. He may never have imagined Jasmine would ever speak so well about his family.

During their Miami vacation, Jasmine had told Gino she wouldn’t marry him if his family were invited to the ceremony. Gino comes from a large family, and his loved ones were looking out for him when he began dating Jasmine. They could see that Jasmine was using Gino for her money and decided she was a gold digger and was marrying him only to get a Green Card. One of Gino’s cousins left a rude comment on Jasmine’s Instagram when someone asked her not to get married on a certain date. Jasmine’s first in-person meeting with Gino’s folks also didn’t go too well.




Still, Jasmine has now realized how much Gino’s family means to him and how having a good relationship with them is a good idea for her own future in the U.S. Jasmine has often made Gino feel insecure and lashed out at him during arguments, and it’s rare for her to praise him. However, more than the good things that Jasmine said about him, Gino was overwhelmed by what she said about his family. It goes to show how close Gino is to his folks and how hurt he had been with Jasmine being at odds with them.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
