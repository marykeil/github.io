## Literature Review
There were several DC and Marvel TV shows that came to an end in 2023, be it narratively or due to cancellations from networks and studios.




As 2023 comes to an end, so have a slew of MCU and DC shows that either aired their final episodes or fell on the chopping block this year. Unsurprisingly, DC properties comprised the most frequently cut shows of 2023 in the wake of the DCU&#39;s reveal, which will begin ramping up the planning and production of its run of shows and movies in 2024 and beyond. Marvel, meanwhile, with its self-contained universe, has been more secretive about whether shows like Secret Invasion will receive a second season, even if another season is unlikely.
While some DC shows were subjected to cancelations before the narrative concluded, not every show this year ended too soon. In the case of many, the beloved DC and Marvel show reached a natural and satisfying conclusion. This is especially true for the best-rated comic book shows in 2023, of which there were thankfully plenty. Meanwhile, 2024 will debut new shows like Echo and The Penguin, stoking ample excitement for the future of the genre on the platform. For now, however, it&#39;s time to say goodbye to these DC and Marvel shows before the year is through.

 6  Loki 
June 2021 - November 2022


 







Loki Season 2 was among the MCU&#39;s best series created, with a finale that brought a satisfying end to Loki&#39;s MCU arc. After becoming the God of Stories, Loki&#39;s glorious purpose is sealed, meaning the series has come to a close after 2 Seasons. With Ke Huy Quan&#39;s Ouroboros becoming a fast fan-favorite alongside Owen Wilson&#39;s Mobius and the eponymous hero himself, Loki Season 2 was destined for success, but the mind-bending conclusion was exceptionally well received. Aside from potential spin-off shows featuring the TVA, or Loki&#39;s reappearance in a future MCU installment, Loki Season 2 was the final chapter that the erstwhile God of Trickery deserved in November.





 5  Titans 
October 2018 - April 2023
        

The live-action adaptation of the illustrious DC team, Teen Titans, has enjoyed a critically acclaimed run on the DC Universe streaming platform and HBO Max, with seasons that steadily increased in quality until it ended on a high note with Season 4. Split into two parts, the series saw the group go toe to toe with one of DC&#39;s most powerful villains, Trigon, before finally going their separate ways and calling time on the series in April. Suffice it to say, it was a fittingly dramatic end to a series that never shied away from the darker side of DC.





 4  The Flash 
October 2014 - February 2023


 







With nearly a decade under its belt, The Flash is one of the longest-running DC shows, beaten only by Smallville which ran for 217 episodes compared to The Flash&#39;s 184. With that in mind, the conclusion of The Flash in February felt particularly poignant as the DCU started to facilitate its all-new run of shows and movies to try and reinvigorate the franchise. The Flash began as a spin-off series for Arrow before becoming one of the most integral series of the Arrowverse. The finale, while crowded, was a heartfelt farewell to Barry Allen that drew a line beneath the long-running franchise.





 3  Doom Patrol 
February 2019 - October 2023


 







The off-the-wall series depicting the group of misfits that supposedly inspired Marvel&#39;s X-Men came to an end in November 2023 after a total of 46 episodes. It ended with a musical tussle with an army of &#34;were-butts,&#34; which was tonally perfect for the series that starred such offbeat characters as the fourth-wall-breaking Mr. Nobody and the Beard Hunter. Another series that ended on a high note, the live-action rendition of the weirdest DC comic book franchise will hold a soft spot in the hearts of many.





 2  Gotham Knights 
March 2023 - June 2023
        

Unfortunately for this live-action adaptation featuring the Batman family, Gotham Knights began and ended in 2023, as the network, The CW, canceled the series after just one season, citing a lack of profits. The network heads at The CW even went so far as to say that the network would be moving beyond Superhero shows entirely, as Gotham Knights and Superman &amp; Lois are both in the firing line. It didn&#39;t fare so well critically, either, as the 13-episode first season garnered middling to poor reviews.





 1  Pennyworth: The Origins of Batmanâ€™s Butler 
July 2019 - October 2022
        

Pennyworth: The Origins of Batman&#39;s Butler is the title of the third and final season of the Pennyworth series. It rounds off a list of six DC series that hit the chopping block in 2023. While the first two seasons of the series were ostensibly a prequel to Gotham, Pennyworth: The Origins of Batman&#39;s Butler was confirmed to be a prequel to Alan Moore&#39;s legendary V For Vendetta graphic novel. The final episode aired in November 2022, but HBO Max officially canceled the series in February 2023, which seemed to coincide with the earliest reveals of the DCU.
