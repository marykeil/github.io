## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Daniele Gates reveals her real relationship status with Yohan Geronimo, which she didn&#39;t talk about during The Other Way Tell-All.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Daniele Gates has a surprising answer for fans when asked if she&#39;s still married to Yohan Geronimo. Daniele is a 43-year-old woman from New York City. She made her reality TV debut with 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise season 2. Daniele had fallen for a much younger Yohan when she met him at her resort in the Dominican Republic. Yohan&#39;s good looks and height blinded Daniele, who married him within five months. Yohan had plenty of red flags, but Daniele chose not to see them.




Due to her blind faith in him, Daniele did not realize that Yohan was in a relationship with a different woman from the time they got married in 2021. However, according to Daniele&#39;s recent Instagram update, she has yet to divorce the unfaithful man.

          

A fan reached out to Daniele on Instagram to ask her, &#34;Are u still married to Yohan?&#34; Daniele said, &#34;Yes.&#34; She revealed that last week was their second wedding anniversary. Daniele and Yohan&#39;s wedding was documented on the Caribbean-themed spin-off before they continued their journey in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4.

Daniele moved to the DR on 90 Day Fiancé after promising Yohan that she was getting him a spousal visa. He was unhappy with what she had done, though. Yohan received sympathy because Daniele came across as controlling. She was slammed for lying to Yohan and crushing his American dream. However, Yohan showed his true colors in The Other Way season 5. Yohan openly declared that he had married an American woman, Daniele, as he expected her to be his sugar mama. Yohan didn&#39;t want to be paying rent for an apartment and car; he wanted his American wife to shower him with gifts.


 

He refused to give Daniele money for half of their monthly expenses and rent. He claimed he had nothing, not even a pair of shorts to call his own, and left Daniele&#39;s apartment in a hurry. Daniele was later contacted by Yohan&#39;s girlfriend, who told her everything about their relationship. Daniele came to the 90 Day Fiancé Tell-All with receipts. She revealed that she was &#34;still separated&#34; from Yohan. Their segment will air in Part 2 of the reunion, but a preview showed Daniele claiming that Yohan was bringing other women to their apartment to sleep with them and that he turned it into a &#34;w****&#34; hotel.

Yohan had allegedly been in touch with six other women online. He supposedly took money from these women as well as from his girlfriend. His girlfriend had even paid money to Yohan&#39;s family members. She had contacted Daniele to find out when she was getting a divorce from Yohan. Daniele has a four-page e-mail that she received from this anonymous woman. Daniele wants to expose Yohan for the monster that he is at the 90 Day Fiancé; The Other Way season 5 Tell-All. She might reveal why she has yet to initiate a divorce from him in the upcoming episode.
