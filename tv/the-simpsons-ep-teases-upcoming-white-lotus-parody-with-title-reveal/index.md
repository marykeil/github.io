## Literature Review
The Simpsons executive producer and co-showrunner Al Jean teases an upcoming parody of The White Lotus., revealing the title in an image.




The Simpsons executive producer and co-showrunner Al Jean teases an upcoming parody of The White Lotus. The Emmy-winning HBO dramedy created by Mike White focuses on the titular &#34;White Lotus&#34; resort, typically featuring an ensemble group of actors. There&#39;s also plenty of relationship drama and death that need to be solved by the end of the season. The White Lotus season 3 will return with new episodes in 2025.




Jean posted a photo on social media, teasing that an upcoming episode of The Simpsons is titled &#34;The Yellow Lotus&#34;, a clear reference to The White Lotus.


 

The episode will be written by Loni Steele Sosthand, a producer and writer on the animated show that&#39;s been credited in several episodes over the past few seasons.


 The Simpsons Has Famously Parodied TV Hits 
          

Some of the more recent examples of television parodies featured on The Simpsons include a riff on the Showtime thriller series Homeland. The episode is pointedly titled &#34;Homerland&#34;, the debut episode of season 25, and it features SNL alum Kristen Wiig voicing a character that&#39;s meant to riff on Claire Danes&#39; portrayal of Carrie Mathison. At the time the episode debuted, in 2013, Homeland was still one of the hottest shows on TV and Danes had earned waves of praise for her performance. It tracks well with how The Simpsons is poised to parody The White Lotus when the HBO show is at its most popular.




                  The Simpsons: The 10 Best Troy McClure Movie Parodies   Troy McClure has featured in a lot of movies that parody some of Hollywood&#39;s cinematic masterpieces. But which titles are the best?    

Another relatively recent example is the Real Housewives reality television franchise. The parody takes the form of The Real Housewives of Shelbyville, also serving as a joke about the rivalry between the central town of Springfield and Shelbyville where Marge is seen watching the parody program in the season 21 episode. As long-time watchers of The Simpsons know, the parodies are even more deeply embedded into the animated staple.

The titular family spends many scenes watching television. A lot of what&#39;s reflected by them is a parody or a spoof of a specific genre. Itchy and Scratchy are an ultraviolent duo that take Tom and Jerry to its extreme conclusion. One of the most famous episodes of The Simpsons, meanwhile, &#34;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&#34; tips its hat to an iconic storyline from Dallas.






The Simpsons season 35 returns with new episodes on Sunday, February 18 at 8 PM ET on Fox.
