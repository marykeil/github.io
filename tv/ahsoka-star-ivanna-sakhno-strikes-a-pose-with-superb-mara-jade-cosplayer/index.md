# Ahsoka Star Ivanna Sakhno Strikes A Pose With Superb Mara Jade Cosplayer


## SUMMARY 



  Shin Hati&#39;s character in Ahsoka shows a potential connection to the light side of the Force, similar to Star Wars Legends character Mara Jade.   Cosplayer Rei Kennex perfectly captures Mara Jade&#39;s original character design, adding a modern twist to the outfit while maintaining its integrity.   While Mara Jade can&#39;t help Shin in canon, Ahsoka&#39;s offer indicates that she will likely play a significant role in Shin&#39;s development in season 2.

## Literature Review

This Star Wars fan made the most amazing Mara Jade cosplay and struck a powerful pose with Shin Hati actress Ivanna Sakhno at LA Comic Con.




Ahsoka star Ivanna Sakhno just struck a powerful pose with an amazing Mara Jade cosplayer. Making her Star Wars debut in Ahsoka, Sakhno&#39;s Shin Hati is a force to be reckoned with. The apprentice of dark Jedi Baylan Skoll, Shin&#39;s ambitions and desires remain mysterious. While her Master believed that she craved power, there is evidence that he misjudged her. Shin clearly believes in honor and is drawn on some level to the light side of the Force, similarly to one notable character from the Star Wars Legends continuity.




                  Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know   Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project.   

Shin Hati herself recently took a photo with cosplayer Rei Kennex at LA Comic Con. Kennex was dressed in the perfect Mara Jade Skywalker cosplay, bringing Luke Skywalker&#39;s wife from Legends to life. Sporting a brown cape, bright red wig, and a futuristic black outfit complete with blaster holsters and goggles hanging around her neck, Kennex puts a modern twist on the character&#39;s outfit while keeping the integrity of Mara Jade&#39;s original character design. Posing with a lightsaber-wielding Sakhno, this gorgeous cosplay imagines what Mara Jade would look like standing next to one of Ahsoka&#39;s most iconic breakout characters.


 





 Mara Jade Would Be Shin Hati&#39;s Perfect Mentor 
          

Mara Jade was Emperor Palpatine&#39;s Hand and assassin. After Palpatine&#39;s death, she fell in love with Luke Skywalker, which caused her to turn to the light side. The two married, and she became a Jedi Master in Luke&#39;s Jedi Order. Unfortunately, Mara Jade is unlikely to be made canon again, as Luke Skywalker&#39;s sequel story went in a different direction. However, if she were still a part of the canon Star Wars universe, she would be the perfect person to help Shin Hati through her struggles.

Like Shin, Mara Jade began as a rogue Force-user working for the Imperials. She experienced what it was like to work for the most evil person in the galaxy and give in to hatred and a desire for power. She saw the pitfalls of choosing such a path and found a way to redemption. Similarly to how Mara Jade ended up working with smugglers after Palpatine&#39;s death, Shin joined a group of bandits in the Ahsoka season 1 finale. If Mara Jade were canon and somehow on Peridea, she could help Shin by teaching her the benefits of the light side.




While Mara Jade sadly cannot help Shin Hati in canon, Ahsoka likely will. At the end of Ahsoka, Shin was abandoned by everyone. She was left by both her Master and Grand Admiral Thrawn. The look on Shin&#39;s face was full of fear and conflict when she rejected Ahsoka&#39;s offer of help. However, given that Ahsoka did offer to help her, Shin will probably come around. If that happens in Ahsoka season 2, her powers combined with Sabine and Ahsoka&#39;s will make them a trio to be reckoned with.



Ahsoka is available to stream on Disney&#43;.
