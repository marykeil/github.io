Spoilers are ahead for Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 4, &#34;I Plunge to My Death.&#34;




Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 introduces a new mythical antagonist named Echidna, who educates Percy about their shared family history during her unexpected ambush on him and his companions. To fulfill the prophecy revealed in Percy Jackson episode 3, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover travel cross-country in the search of the Underworld to solve the mystery of Zeus&#39; master bolt when a strange woman and her dog confront them. The trio quickly piece together that the stranger is Echidna, the mother of all monsters whose bloodthirsty agenda causes them to divert from their pursuit of the Underworld to escape her clutches.

Before launching her attack on the group, Echidna feels inclined to express her agenda to annihilate all demigods, whom she feels are the universe&#39;s real monsters. According to the logic of the frightening Percy Jackson villain, Percy and Echidna could be considered equals, as they spawn from the same family tree. Percy Jackson episode 4 epically reveals Echidna and Percy&#39;s common ancestry, but also uncovers a complicated lineage that obscures the perception of the series&#39; heroes and villains.





 Echidna&#39;s Grandmother (&amp; Percy&#39;s Great-Grandmother) Is Gaea 
          

Echidna and Percy are kindred because of their blood relation to the primordial goddess Gaea, who&#39;s Echidna&#39;s grandmother and Percy&#39;s great-grandmother. In Greek mythology, from which Percy Jackson finds its influence, Gaea was the personification of the earth and the supreme mother who begot the earliest beings of the universe, such as the Titans, the Cyclopes, and more (via Mythopedia). With her offspring and lover, Uranus, the symbol of the heavens, Gaea allegedly molded the universe itself.

As the mother of all creation, Gaea often sired children with members of her own begotten family. For instance, with another one of her offspring known as Pontus - who is personified as the sea itself - she birthed the earliest sea deities, including Thaumus, Euybia, Nereus, Phorcys, and Ceto (via Mythopedia). Out of Phorcys and Ceto, the snake monster, Echidna, was born, substantiating the Percy Jackson antagonist as the direct granddaughter of the great primordial goddess.






 Echidna Is Percy Jackson&#39;s First Cousin Once Removed 
          

Based on Gaea&#39;s lineage in Greek mythology, Percy and Echidna are first cousins once removed in Percy Jackson. Greek lore often claims that Gaea and Uranus spawned the original 12 Titans, one of whom was Cronus (via Britannica). Cronus consorted with his sister Rhea, and together, they sired the gods and goddesses, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and most notably, Poseidon.



In Greek mythology, Gaea is not only Poseidon&#39;s grandmother but a brief lover whom he has the child Antaeus with.




In a Percy Jackson episode 2 reveal, Percy is claimed by Poseidon, verifying that he is indeed the son of Sally Jackson and the Greek god of the sea. Without delving too deeply into Greek folklore, Echidna asserts her and Percy&#39;s kinship but doesn&#39;t let the naked truth stop her from pursuing his murder. By the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4, Percy escapes Echidna with the help of his father, Poseidon, but the encounter will inevitably create further tension within the series&#39; vast and overarching family dynamic.
