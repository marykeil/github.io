## Literature Review

Exclusive: Mari Yamamoto, who plays Keiko in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, discusses her character&#39;s potential story in a second season of the show.




In a recent interview, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters star Mari Yamamoto discussed where she believes her character Keiko&#39;s story could go in a second season. The Apple TV&#43; show takes place in the overall MonsterVerse timeline, with the first season exploring both the founding of Monarch in the 1950s and the aftermath of G-Day in the 2010s. The series ended its first season earlier this month, bringing Keiko into a new timeline.




The season finale brought Keiko into the future, where she reunited with her son and grandchildren. This has given a lot of narrative potential for what can be explored with her character in a potential second season, which Yamamoto reflected on in a recent Screen Rant interview about Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. Check out the full quote below:


Mari Yamamoto: I mean, all of the family stuff, because we don&#39;t get to really address this. I think it&#39;s not until she sees Hiroshi that she really registers that Cate and Kentaro are her grandkids. That was hard to play because she&#39;s sort of in disbelief in Axis Mundi, and then Cate is the one that convinces her to come back with them; that there&#39;s more work to do. That was a really moving moment for me, but there&#39;s no real reckoning of, like, “You’re my granddaughter. You&#39;re my grandma.” We don&#39;t see that, so that would be really interesting to play. And how does she reckon with the guilt that she feels for what happened to Hiroshi’s life, and the fact that she&#39;s lost Billy as well?
I think another interesting relationship is always going to be her and her work; her fascination with the Titans and her work with her research. She has so much to catch up on; she has 50 years of science to catch up on, not to mention how the world is changed. Is she going to go back to Japan? What&#39;s that going to look like? The last time she saw it, it was in the ruins of the war, so to see all these tall buildings… what is that like? [There are] so many things I would love to explore from her point of view.





                  When Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Takes Place In Godzilla&#39;s MonsterVerse Timeline   Apple TV&#43;&#39;s new MonsterVerse-based TV show will occupy a very unique space within the MonsterVerse timeline that has been covered in the movies.   


 How Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Could Change In Season 2 
         

The focus on the Randa family in Monarch was split into different time periods in the show&#39;s first season, meaning it was never feasible for some members to interact with one another. However, with the ending of season one serving as a time jump family reunion of sorts, there&#39;s a ton of new things to be explored. Yamamoto&#39;s point about the characters not having time to come to terms with their familial connections is particularly important, and has the great potential for emotional moments if pursued in the second season.






But when it comes to reckoning with the future, Keiko&#39;s character has much more to contend with than just family.




There are decades of research on the Titans and general societal progress to catch up with as well. The ending of Monarch&#39;s first season set up a path for not only Keiko but the MonsterVerse as a whole to progress, teasing a new Titan focus with a Skull Island cliffhanger. Currently, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has yet to be renewed, but there&#39;s undoubtedly a lot it could explore with more episodes.



All 10 episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; first season are available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.
