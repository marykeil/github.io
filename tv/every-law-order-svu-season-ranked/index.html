  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>SVU has evolved from focusing solely on cases to incorporating the personal lives of detectives, but still produces great seasons.
The constantly changing cast and showrunners make each season feel different, but SVU remains the most successful Law and Order spinoff.
While all seasons have standout episodes, some struggle to strike the right chord, especially when addressing delicate subjects like police corruption and new technologies.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Law and Order: Special Victims Unit has produced 24 complete seasons since 1999, but the quality of the show hasn’t always been consistent.</p>
<p>Since 1999, Law and Order: Special VIctims Unit has been one of the most popular crime procedurals on TV, and there have been plenty of changes across its 24 seasons. SVU has recently started season 25, but even its oldest episodes still make for great viewing. In the early days of the show, the focus was squarely on the exciting cases that were presented each week, as a team of detectives sought to unravel the tangled web of criminal deceit. More recently, the personal lives of the detectives have become more important to the show, but the show still produces some great seasons.
There have been so many cast changes on SVU that it can be hard to keep track. The only everpresent actor on the show has been Mariska Hargitay, who plays Olivia Benson. The constantly changing cast means that the show often feels completely different from one season to the next, especially because the writers and showrunners also come and go. SVU is by far the most successful spinoff of Law and Order, even surpassing the original in terms of longevity. SVU is one of the longest-running scripted shows on TV, so naturally, some seasons are better than others.
Law and Order: SVU is streaming on Peacock. New episodes air on Thursdays on NBC, and are added to Peacock the next day.</p>
<p>24  Season 22
2020-2021</p>
<p>Even the worst seasons of SVU are still capable of producing one or two great episodes. Season 22, episode 9, &ldquo;Return of the Prodigal Son,&rdquo; is a fine example of this, bringing back Detective Stabler after years of being away as his family faces a terrible threat. Unfortunately, this is one of very few standouts in season 22, as the show struggled to strike the right chord after a fresh wave of questions against American law enforcement in 2020. SVU seemed unsure of how to approach such a delicate subject, and the result was a bit of a mess.</p>
<p>23  Season 16
2014-2015</p>
<p>Season 16 is the end of the line for Amaro, as his fiery personality finally gets him into too much trouble for him to overcome. As Amaro leaves, the show fills his spot with Carisi. Although he has since become a beloved character, Carisi starts out as an obnoxious presence, irritating everyone else in the 16th precinct. Season 16 is also notorious for having one of the worst episodes in the entire run of SVU. Episode 14 &ldquo;Intimidation Game&rdquo; tries to examine the toxic culture of masculinity in gaming, but its approach is heavy-handed at best.</p>
<p>22  Season 18
2016-2017</p>
<p>Season 18 was the only season with Rick Eid as showrunner, who has also worked on Law and Order and Chicago P.D. Season 18 has a heavy focus on stories based on real life, but some work a lot better than others. Episode 16, &ldquo;The Newsroom&rdquo; plays on the harassment claims at Fox News, as Benson and Barba team up to gather evidence about a news anchor accused of sexual misconduct and inappropriate workplace conduct. It&rsquo;s an interesting dive into the psychology of survivors who stand up to famous perpetrators, but not all of season 18&rsquo;s efforts are as nuanced.</p>
<p>21  Season 24
2022-2023</p>
<p>Season 24 starts off in the midst of &ldquo;Gimme Shelter,&rdquo; the brilliant Law and Order crossover event which also includes the original Law and Order and Law and Order: Organized Crime, which features Elliot Stabler. &ldquo;Gimme Shelter&rdquo; used SVU to give both of these shows a boost, but the crossover was more than just a publicity scheme. The rest of the season is rather hit-and-miss, but with a few more misses than hits. The later seasons of SVU have focused more on the detectives than the cases and the victims, and episodes without a compelling case don&rsquo;t have the same thrust.</p>
<p>23 Times Law &amp; Order: SVU’s Olivia Benson Has Appeared In Dick Wolf’s Other TV Shows
Since first appearing as Olivia Benson on Law and Order: SVU in 1999, Mariska Hargitay has brought the character to many other Dick Wolf shows.</p>
<p>20  Season 21
2019-2020</p>
<p>After initially departing after season 17, Warren Leight returned as showrunner for season 21. His seasons can be identified by the show&rsquo;s increased focus on the personal lives of the detectives, which suited season 21 perfectly, as Olivia Benson was made Captain and Carisi became Assistant District Attorney. Season 21 had to be cut slightly short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that there were only 20 episodes. In this truncated season, Rollins was frequently the most interesting character, with episodes like &ldquo;I Deserve Some Loving Too&rdquo; shining the spotlight on her.</p>
<p>19  Season 8
2006-2007</p>
<p>Season 8 came right in the middle of SVU&rsquo;s strongest era, but it doesn&rsquo;t have as many memorable episodes as those around it. Mariska Hargitay missed a few episodes while on maternity leave, and while the show wasn&rsquo;t as squarely focused on her character in season 8 as it is today, it still suffered during her absence. When she is involved, season 8 still produces a handful of great episodes. One of SVU&rsquo;s best guest stars appears in the season finale &ldquo;Screwed,&rdquo; which features Ludacris as Fin&rsquo;s nephew who goes on trial for murder and rape.</p>
<p>18  Season 3
2001-2002</p>
<p>Season 3 continued the long process of piecing the show together. It added some important fan-favorite characters to the show, like technology expert Ruben Morales, ADA Elizabeth Donnelly, and defense attorney Trevor Langan. All of these characters would go on to become vital to the show&rsquo;s detailed portrayal of the criminal justice system. Season 3 also helped refine the twisty nature of the criminal cases. Episode 21, &ldquo;Denial,&rdquo; is one example of a case which seems simple at first, but the detectives uncover dark secrets as their investigation continues.</p>
<p>17  Season 23
2021-2022</p>
<p>Season 23 features the 500th episode of SVU, which brings back old characters like Cragen and Amaro. It&rsquo;s a fitting way to mark such an incredible milestone in the show&rsquo;s run, but it&rsquo;s more than just a nostalgia trip. Other episodes sway between dense political drama and more old-fashioned cases, with one standout being &ldquo;Eighteen Wheels a Predator,&rdquo; which sees Fin and Rollins linking a crime in Kentucky to one committed in Central Park. Season 23 is bogged down by a few weaker episodes, and the changes to the visual style are too jarring at times.</p>
<p>16  Season 19
2017-2018</p>
<p>Most seasons have made one or two cast changes, and the big news in season 19 was ADA Barba (Raúl Esparza) leaving SVU. Barba has made a couple of guest appearances since, but season 19 was his last major involvement. Under the guidance of new showrunner Michael S. Chernuchin, season 19 gets off to a slow start, but the show eventually finds its feet. &ldquo;Gone Baby Gone&rdquo; combines SVU&rsquo;s twin focuses of dangerous cases and the personal lives of the detectives superbly, as the squad unites to track down Benson&rsquo;s missing son.</p>
<p>15  Season 14
2012-2013</p>
<p>Season 14 gets off to a great start, with Cragen and Amaro accused of being involved in a nefarious homicide plot in the first episode. There are other highlights peppered throughout the season, such as &ldquo;Born Psychopath&rdquo; and &ldquo;Monster&rsquo;s Legacy,&rdquo; which both raise difficult questions about the limitations of the criminal justice system, especially when it tries to apply strict rules to nuanced and morally complex cases. Overall, it&rsquo;s a strong season, and if the rest of the episodes had maintained this high standard, then it could have been up there with SVU&rsquo;s very best.</p>
<p>14  Season 1
1999-2000</p>
<p>Law and Order: Special Victims Unit faced a tough challenge as the first spinoff from the original show, but season 1 makes a solid start. Cragen crossed over from Law and Order, and a few other regular cast members made guest appearances in SVU season 1 to help it get started. But SVU also had to forge its own path. Fortunately, Benson and Stabler&rsquo;s compelling dynamic sprung up from the ground fully formed, and the show went from strength to strength throughout its first season. Some of the show&rsquo;s best characters hadn&rsquo;t joined yet, but the cases are still fascinating.</p>
<p>Every Law &amp; Order Series, Ranked By IMDb
Over the 32 years that the franchise has existed, Law &amp; Order shows have found enduring appeal, even if some are more popular than others.</p>
<p>13  Season 2
2000-2001</p>
<p>Season 2 was the first to include Neal Baer as showrunner, and it began to set up the show&rsquo;s greatest formula. Fin Tutuola joined the squad to replace the outgoing Monique Jeffries, and his immediate rapport with Munch was a huge boost for SVU. The duo act as a secondary team most of the time, which allows them to inject some humorous touches into the show more often than Benson and Stabler. Season 2 gives them some great episodes together, such as &ldquo;Legacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Manhunt,&rdquo; but they also frequently help out in the background.</p>
<p>12  Season 20
2018-2019</p>
<p>Season 20 is characteristically uneven for one of the later seasons of SVU, but the highs are exceptional. &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; is an example of SVU perfectly capturing the zeitgeist of online discourse and new technology, which isn&rsquo;t always easy for a show that tries to keep up with the headlines. The outstanding episode is &ldquo;Alta Kockers,&rdquo; however, which features Judd Hirsch and Wallace Shawn on top form as a pair of reclusive brothers who become the center of a murder investigation. It&rsquo;s a great showcase for some fine acting, with the brothers each hiding decades-old secrets from one another.</p>
<p>11  Season 15
2013-2014</p>
<p>Season 15 changes the familiar formula of SVU, focusing primarily on a single case throughout the entire season. There are only a few episodes which don&rsquo;t feature William Lewis, the man who abducts and tortures Olivia Benson. Naturally, Benson becomes a key focus, but Rollins also has a lot of great moments as her gambling addiction forces her into a corner. Even with these story lines simmering in the background, season 15 still has plenty of intriguing cases to keep things fresh on a weekly basis. Season 15 also marks Cragen and Munch&rsquo;s farewell.</p>
<p>Every Law &amp; Order: SVU Episode Directed By Mariska Hargitay
Mariska Hargitay, known for her role as Olivia Benson, also directed several times for Law &amp; Order: SVU. Here is a complete list of those episodes.</p>
<p>10  Season 13
2011-2012</p>
<p>When Christopher Meloni left SVU, the show suffered its biggest loss since it began in 1999. Somehow, season 13 managed to produce plenty of great episodes without Stabler. His absence is felt by the entire squad, but Benson struggles in particular, since the two had formed a tight bond over the years. Her character is still compelling without Stabler, and episodes like &ldquo;Justice Denied&rdquo; delve into her interesting past. Rollins and Amaro make great additions to the team, helping to soften the blow from Stabler&rsquo;s departure. Season 13 has a different feel to its predecessors, with plenty of new writers.</p>
<p>9  Season 12
2010-2011</p>
<p>Season 12 was the end of an era for SVU, with Christopher Meloni and showrunner Neal Baer leaving before season 13. Crucial characters George Huang and Melinda Warner also made their final appearances in season 12, so the squad&rsquo;s technical help would never be the same. Before these key players departed, they contributed to plenty of classic episodes, like &ldquo;Behave,&rdquo; in which a serial rapist and stalker is found to have assaulted women all over the country. The season finale features the squad room shooting, one of the show&rsquo;s most shocking moments of all.</p>
<p>Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime Hints A Benson &amp; Stabler Romance Won&rsquo;t Happen Anytime Soon
The Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime crossover with SVU continues to tease a Benson and Stabler relationship, but it still won&rsquo;t happen soon.</p>
<p>8  Season 5
2003-2004</p>
<p>Alex Cabot received one of the most memorable send-offs of any main character in SVU in season 5, as she receives death threats for prosecuting members of a Colombian drug cartel. She is replaced by ADA Casey Novak, who is even more tenacious in her pursuit of convictions. Most seasons of SVU feature cases based on real life, and season 5 is no exception. One of the most disturbing episodes is &ldquo;Sick,&rdquo; which takes inspiration from the allegations against Michael Jackson, with an acute focus on the culpability of the parents of the victims.</p>
<p>7  Season 10
2008-2009</p>
<p>SVU produces some of its best episodes when the personal lives of the detectives get tangled up with their work, and this is the case when Stabler finds that images of his daughter are being circulated on a website for sexual predators. Season 10 saves the best for last, however, with the season finale &ldquo;Zebras&rdquo; also blurring the lines between personal and professional, when CSU Dale Stuckey murders a string of people connected to a specific case to cover up his own error. The surprising reveal shows that nobody can be trusted, even within the SVU.</p>
<p>6  Season 17
2015-2016</p>
<p>More so than any season which came before it, season 17 of SVU digs into the dark secrets hiding in the NYPD. &ldquo;Manhattan Transfer&rdquo; focuses on two cops involved in an underage prostitution ring with ties to the city&rsquo;s political elite, and &ldquo;Collateral Damage&rdquo; reveals a deputy police commissioner&rsquo;s hidden business distributing child pornography. The final two episodes follow the case of Gary Munson, a corrections officer accused of sexually assaulting inmates. The crime is disturbing enough, but the way the perpetrator is sheltered by the system is even more upsetting.</p>
<p>5  Season 11
2009-2010</p>
<p>Season 11 of SVU is remarkably consistent, with very few episodes which could be labeled as disappointments. Each episode presents a twisty case that ultimately speaks to some of the most pressing issues facing criminal justice in America. For example, &ldquo;Solitary&rdquo; questions the use of solitary confinement in prisons, and whether it should be considered &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishment&rdquo; in violation of the 8th Amendment. Ethical dilemmas like this one are used in some of the most fascinating episodes of SVU, asking the viewer to reflect on their own views.</p>
