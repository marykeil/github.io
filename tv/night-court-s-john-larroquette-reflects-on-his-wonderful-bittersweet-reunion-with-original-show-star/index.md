## Literature Review
Star John Larroquette shares his thoughts on his recent Night Court reunion with Marsha Warfield, who starred with him in the original show.




Night Court star John Larroquette reflects on his recent on-set reunion with original show star Marsha Warfield. Airing for 9 seasons on NBC from 1984 to 1992, the popular sitcom returned in 2023 for a revival, with Larroquette reprising his role as public defender Dan Fielding. Night Court is set to return for season 2 this week, with the premiere featuring the return of Warfield as Roz, a role she occupied during seasons 4 to 9 of the original show.




Now, ahead of the Night Court season 2 premiere, Larroquette shares his thoughts on his reunion with Warfield during a recent interview with TVLine. According to the star, the reunion was a somewhat bittersweet affair. Check out Larroquette&#39;s full comment below:


“It was just like the old bicycle thing. It was immediate and intimate and hilarious to be with her again. When we looked at each other, we realized we were the only two [main actors] left from the original… The last time I saw her was at [co-star] Markie Post’s memorial. So it was happy to see her in circumstances where we got to work together again, instead of just being in a place where we had to be, because of our love of the people who had passed.”



 How Is The Night Court Revival Faring Without Original Stars? 
          

The original Night Court cast is a big reason why the first iteration of the show was able to run for so many seasons. Actors like Harry Anderson, Richard Moll, Charles Robinson, and Markie Post, among others, gave life to an array of unique and hilarious supporting characters, all of which were crucial to the show&#39;s success. All of these main actors have now passed away, however, and the revival has instead been built around an entirely new cast of characters, save for Dan.




The Night Court revival&#39;s cast sees Melissa Rauch starring as Judge Abby Stone, Harry&#39;s Stone&#39;s daughter, with other newcomers including India de Beaufort as Olivia Moore, Lacretta as Donna &#34;Gurgs&#34; Gurganous, and Kapil Talwalker as Neil Valluri (though Talwalker is confirmed to not return for season 2 due to creative differences). So far, the new cast and storylines seem to be proving popular with audiences, with the revival&#39;s reviews skewing positive.

In fact, the Night Court revival currently holds a higher Rotten Tomatoes score than the original, with the reboot&#39;s 74% beating the original&#39;s 62%. The audience score for the revival, however, is only 45%, which certainly leaves room for improvement. No audience score is available for the original Night Court, though the fact that it remained popular enough to run to season 9 suggests it may still have a leg up on the revival.



After a standalone Christmas special, Night Court season 2 is set to premiere on NBC on January 2 at 8/7c, with an episode titled &#34;The Roz Affair&#34;.
