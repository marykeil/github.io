# 9 DCEU Movies That Divided Critics &amp; Audiences The Most


## SUMMARY 


 The DCEU was a franchise of uneven quality, but audiences generally enjoyed the movies more than critics. 
 White critics often marked movies down for justified technical or storytelling reasons, audiences may be more forgiving on that front. 
 Divisiveness is nothing new for the DCEU, and the movies with the widest gulf in reception span the entire decade-long run.

## Literature Review

Differences in opinion between critics and audiences are common in the superhero genre, but some DCEU movies have created a particularly large gulf.




The divide in opinion between critics and audiences is particularly prevalent in DCEU movies, but some caused more of a split than others. The DCEU made its ill-fated debut with Man of Steel six years after the MCU began, only to draw to a close ten years later with the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. It was a decade replete with highs and lows for the DCEU, though exactly where those landed is where audiences and critics evidently disagree.
Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes has documented the opinions of critics and general audiences on the DCEU throughout its time. One interesting feature of the DCEU movies is that in every critic and audience divide on this list, the audience has always scored more. This is not the case for many MCU movies, for instance, where some of the biggest gulfs see critics scoring the movie much higher than the audience. The reasons for this are myriad, but a look at the reviews for these divisive DCEU movies gives a pretty good indication of where the two groups differ.
            
 
 How To Watch DCEU Movies In Order (By Release Date &amp; Chronologically) 
The DCEU&#39;s timeline may be about to be rebooted in the DC Universe, but here&#39;s how to watch the DCEU in release order or chronological order.












 








 9  Man Of Steel Was Seen As Boring But Original 
Critics Score 56% Vs Audience Score 75%


 







Man of Steel flew onto the superhero scene six years after Iron Man kicked off the MCU and more than a decade safter X-Men and Spider-Man were released. This made it hard not to measure up Man of Steel to the many superhero movies that preceded it (especially 2006&#39;s Superman Returns), and because of that, the movie seemed to suffer. Instead of praising a new spin on the character, critics were bored by the slug-fest, criticizing its staleness while lamenting its lack of substance and the &#34;fun&#34; moments that typified Superman&#39;s previous cinematic outings.
Interestingly, the audience wasn&#39;t always so full of praise as the darker tones also split opinions among them. Several years after its release, however, the movie seems to have aged like a fine wine. Audience praise for Henry Cavill, the darker tone, and, of course, Superman&#39;s suit have helped to build a gulf of 19 points between the audience and critics&#39; scores.





 8  The Flash Was Too CGI-Heavy But Raucously Entertaining 
Critics Score 63% Vs Audience Score 83%


 







As one of just two movies included in this list that broke the 60% mark with critics, The Flash was far from universally panned. In fact, the Critics Consensus dubs it &#34;one of the best DC movies in recent years.&#34; Given that DCEU movies are generally less well-received by critics than their MCU counterparts, this is relatively tall praise, with other positives noting the fun and frivolous way in which it deals with a mind-bending facet of DC lore. On that subject, naysayers berate the movie for being too messy to be enjoyable.
It is the cavalcade of cameos that seems to have struck a chord with fans of The Flash, as was no doubt the intention. Michael Keaton&#39;s latest turn behind the cowl is a highlight, while the healthy dose of laughs and emotional beats hit the mark. Another trend among DCEU movie critiques concerns the heavy-handed use of CGI, of which The Flash also fell foul across the board. While this did not condemn the movie critically, the box office result was underwhelming nonetheless.





 7  Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League Was Exactly What Fans Asked For 
Critics Score 72% Vs Audience Score 93%


 







Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League is one of the highest-rated DCEU movies in general for critics, stopping just short of the &#34;Certified Fresh&#34; accolade as the consensus reads, &#34;Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League lives up to its title with a sprawling cut that expands to fit the director&#39;s vision -- and should satisfy the fans who willed it into existence.&#34; Needless to say, this is the Justice League movie as it was initially envisaged and avoided the tonal shifts for which the first Justice League release was heavily criticized.
Unsurprisingly, as this movie was called for by prescient fans certain that it would live up to expectations, the 21-point gulf between scores speaks volumes. Audience reviewers pinpointed a more fleshed-out Cyborg as one of its greatest strengths, while the arrival of Darkseid helped to engender the most commonly-used descriptor for the movie: &#34;masterpiece.&#34; Detractors, meanwhile, pointed out the sheer length of the movie (owing to it not being a theatrical release) as a weakness. Needless to say, the length was not reason enough for those baying for its release to levy criticism against the fruits of their persistence.





 6  Justice League Failed To Live Up To The Hype 
Critics Score 39% Vs Audience Score 67%
        

Considering Justice League prompted a mass push for a second go-around, it&#39;s safe to say it wasn&#39;t as groundbreaking as intended. An unavoidable switch-up of creative visions is what gave way to criticisms of tonal inconsistency - on which critics and audiences agreed. Where they differed to a degree of 28 points, however, was on the novelty of having these iconic heroes band together for the first time in live action, something that DC fans readily wield as a shield against the movie&#39;s more apparent flaws, claiming that, as a popcorn movie for entertainment&#39;s sake, it fits the bill.





 5  An Otherwise Messy Suicide Squad Was Helped By Its Stars 
Critics Score 26% Vs Audience Score 58%


 







Despite there being otherwise no DCEU movie that the audience rated below 60%, Suicide Squad is where the franchise stumbled. The first cinematic outing of Waller&#39;s Task Force X is the worst-rated DCEU movie across the board, which is where the critics and fans find common ground. Yet, in a running theme for DCEU movies, fans were willing to give the movie a greater benefit of the doubt in favor of the novelty and sheer entertainment factor offered by Suicide Squad, creating a gulf of 32% between audience and critics&#39; scores.
Critics pinpoint multiple cardinal sins of filmmaking for their low score of just 26%, including a messy plot and insubstantial characters. Where audiences level praise by comparison is for the movie&#39;s admittedly stellar soundtrack and the performances of Margot Robbie (who went on to star in the solo movie Birds of Prey on this merit) and Will Smith. Jared Leto&#39;s unique portrayal of the Joker, meanwhile, split audiences, with many showing appreciation for an underutilized asset.





 4  Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice Improved After The Theatrical Release 
Critics Score 29% Vs Audience Score 63%


 







While Suicide Squad is the most criticized DCEU movie on Rotten Tomatoes, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is the second-worst. While the star power of these two DC powerhouses was enough for audiences to afford the movie a rating that broke 60%, critics saw fit to only rate it 3% higher than Suicide Squad, zoning in on wasted potential and a shoehorning of both Batman and future plots into a movie that was &#34;frustratingly disappointing.&#34; The 34% difference in scores is in part due to the audience&#39;s appreciation for the spectacle of the movie&#39;s climax (and Wonder Woman&#39;s debut).
Additionally, audiences level praise for the post-theatrical &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; of the movie, which would not factor into most of the critics&#39; scores on Rotten Tomatoes. With that in mind, it seems that Batman v Superman has experienced a similar fate to Justice League, with the longer, more fleshed-out second version of the movie winning over erstwhile naysayers. Very little could distract from the infamous &#34;Martha&#34; MacGuffin, however.





 3  Shazam! Fury Of The Gods Was A Family-Friendly Romp 
Critics Score 49% Vs Audience Score 86%


 







Shazam! is one of the DCEU&#39;s highest-rated movies, but its sequel failed to wow critics a second time. The same cannot be said for the audience, who saw the sequel to be of greater quality altogether, leading to a 37-point gulf between critics and audiences. Fittingly, the critics generally lament what was lost from the original, though they largely see the movie as harmless fun on its own merit. The more generous audience response leans into this positive more heavily while also noting that it does not measure up to the original, despite the higher overall rating.





 2  Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom Did Well With Audiences 
Critics Score 35% Vs Audience Score 81%
        

Commercially, things could have been much worse for the DCEU&#39;s swansong. As the only DCEU movie to break $1 billion, Aquaman was always destined for a sequel, though it wasn&#39;t pictured as the cinematic franchise&#39;s last at the time. In the end, critics believed Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom to measure up poorly to its predecessor, while audiences lavished it with greater praise, leading to a vast 46% difference in opinion.
The fact that the movie ended up grossing nearly $380 million worldwide, despite a disappointing opening weekend, indicates how differently audiences felt towards the movie that critics decried for not being creative enough and too CGI-heavy. Yet it was for the sheer entertainment factor - a trait that even detractors conceded - that audiences saw fit to prop up this final DCEU entry. Common ground, meanwhile, was found in Jason Momoa&#39;s magnetism, which is a good sign for his rumored DCU recasting as Lobo.





 1  Black Adam 
Critics Score 38% Vs Audience Score 88%


 







While both audience and critics lavish praise on Dwayne Johnson&#39;s impassioned embodiment of the role, his enthusiasm alone was not enough to save the movie from the critics&#39; familiar denigration of CGI and muddled plot. It was precisely because of the spectacle and entertainment factor that the audience tended to disagree, however, while mentioning the originality of the DCEU antihero lead. A host of previously unseen heroes and the promise of a &#34;new direction&#34; were also high points for Black Adam, which is why it&#39;s no wonder that hype is at a fever pitch for the upcoming DCU reboot.
