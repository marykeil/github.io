## Literature Review

The popular Disney Channel original series Wizards of Waverly Place is returning in a sequel that will feature several of the original cast members.  




The popular Disney Channel show Wizards of Waverly Place is returning in a highly-anticipated sequel series that will feature several of the original characters. Debuting in 2007, Wizards of Waverly Place follows the Russo family as they try to balance their lives as run-of-the-mill sandwich shop owners who also happen to be powerful wizards. The bulk of the series hinged on the internal conflict within the Russo siblings, as they each trained to one day compete to be the sole recipient of their family&#39;s magical abilities. 




When the series went off the air in 2012, the story had been neatly wrapped up with each of the family members being served a happy ending. While still beloved to this day, Wizards of Waverly Place is perhaps best known for being the launching point for the career of Selena Gomez, and she is one of many former Disney stars to go on to have a much larger career. Even though the show ended on a positive note, fans have still clung to hope that the Russo family would return, and now it seems that their wish is finally being granted.

Despite very little build-up, the Wizards of Waverly Place sequel series was announced in January 2024 to the shock and surprise of many. According to the reveal, Disney has ordered a pilot that will continue the story of the Russo family and even feature several of the stars from the original series. Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Selena Gomez is slated to reprise her role as Alex Russo, and is even serving as one of the executive producers on the series.

The announcement mentioned that Disney has ordered a pilot only at this juncture, meaning the fate of the series will hinge on how the test episode is received. However, with such big names involved, it&#39;s likely Disney will not hesitate to give the series a full order. Though the pilot has been ordered, it has not been revealed when and if fans will be able to watch the new series.

The announcement that Disney had ordered a pilot episode also included some welcome news about the cast of the new Wizards of Waverly Place series. First, Selena Gomez will return as Alex Russo, though it is unclear how big of a role the A-lister will play in the series as a whole. On the other hand, David Henrie is returning as Justin Russo, and he will be the clear focal point of the series as he takes a young struggling wizard under his wing.




Jake T. Austin played Max in the original series, but the third Russo sibling has not been announced for the sequel series yet. On the other hand, several new names have been added to the cast list of the Wizards of Waverly Place sequel, though their roles aren&#39;t known at this time. Newcomers Janice LeAnn Brown, Alkaio Thiele, and Mimi Gianopulos will all appear in the pilot.
