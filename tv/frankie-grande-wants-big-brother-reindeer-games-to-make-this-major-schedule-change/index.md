## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games star Frankie Grande has been watching the spin-off alongside viewers, but he believes there should be a scheduling change.




Big Brother Reindeer Games has been an exciting event for Big Brother fans and legends alike, but contestant Frankie Grande is advocating for a major scheduling change on the final episodes. While the initial expectation for Big Brother Reindeer Games was low after a grueling 100-day season on Big Brother 25, the series has been a surprisingly entertaining time for Big Brother fans. With a cast of Big Brother legends competing for a $100,000 grand prize, the series has been a fun holiday spin-off of the original that focuses more on competitions than social elements. While the season has been successful so far, the show has some issues to address.




For the first stretch of Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1, the episodes were 90 minutes long and gave genuine insight into the cast members&#39; rationale surrounding their decisions and strategy. With longer episodes, there was more room to feature interview segments and in-depth looks at the competitions. The second stretch of episodes was just an hour long, and many have been critical of the change, including Frankie who tweeted, “Ugh you miss so much strategizing on the shorter episodes! Bring back the 90 minutes! 😫#BBReindeerGames.” With shorter episodes, many feel that the level of strategizing seen is far lower.


 How Has Frankie Grande Been Doing On Big Brother Reindeer Games? 
          

Frankie has been doing well on Big Brother Reindeer Games, despite being someone that fans love to hate. After taking a leave of absence from the Big Brother community since his appearance on BB 16, Frankie has been back to his old tricks and better than ever during his time on Big Brother Reindeer Games. Competing with the same level of physicality that he did during his season, Frankie has been a beast throughout his time on the show and has won multiple competitions. He’s also been great socially, making relationships with many cast members who have kept him safe in the game.





 

While Frankie’s criticism of the series has some validity, it’s also something that may not have been possible for CBS to achieve in their current schedule. The episodes, which were initially meant to only be an hour long and were stretched to 90 minutes when the series began editing, have been somewhat easier to digest at 60 minutes, though there is a lot of the game&#39;s strategy lost to the cutting room floor. Big Brother Reindeer Games has been successful enough to sustain 90-minute episodes, but the longer episodes do take some of the steam out of the story, so many feel the 60-minute format is better for the show.

With Big Brother Reindeer Games being a runaway success for the Big Brother franchise, many are hopeful that another season of the series will come next year. Though it will be a long wait for Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2, it’s possible that the holiday-themed event will take some advice from the first season and make their episodes longer, more in-depth, and overly strategic. While the game can be understood without the high-level strategy, Big Brother Reindeer Games is more enjoyable with a grasp on the strategic side of the game.
