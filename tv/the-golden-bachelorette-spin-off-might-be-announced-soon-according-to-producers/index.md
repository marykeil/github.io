## Literature Review
Following the success of The Golden Bachelor, the announcement of The Golden Bachelorette spin-off has been much-anticipated. It might happen soon.




The Golden Bachelor was a big hit for ABC, leading to much speculation and anticipation about a possible spin-off for The Golden Bachelorette, and it seems that the announcement about the show might be happening soon. The Golden Bachelor starred 72-year-old Gerry Turner, who lost his wife, Toni, six years ago after being together for 43 years. Gerry had the opportunity to find a second chance at love with 22 women aged 60 and older. In the end, he got engaged to 70-year-old Theresa Nist. They&#39;ll be married in a televised wedding airing January 4, 2024. Many of the other women from Gerry&#39;s season have been considered perfect candidates to be the first-ever Golden Bachelorette.




According to AARP, at a panel held on Monday, December 11 at the Times Center in New York City, The Golden Bachelor producers hinted that The Golden Bachelorette will be happening soon. The panel featured Gerry, Theresa, and showrunners Bennett Graebner, Claire Freeland and Jason Ehrlich. In regard to The Golden Bachelorette, Jason said, &#34;Nothing would make us happier,&#34; and told fans to &#34;stay tuned.&#34; He also suggested that the first-ever Golden Bachelorette would come from Gerry&#39;s season. He explained, &#34;There are so many incredible women from this season that it would be hard not to pick one of them.&#34; Deadline reported that the spin-off &#34;is expected sooner rather than later.&#34;

Deadline also reported that ABC and Warner Horizon are looking into ways that the Bachelor franchise can expand in order to include contestants of all ages, rather than favoring people in their 20&#39;s and early 30&#39;s. At 39 years old, Clare Crawley was the oldest woman ever to star as The Bachelorette. However, most of the Bachelorettes were in their mid-to-late 20&#39;s.


 

The Golden Bachelorette would be a fantastic addition to the Bachelor franchise. There are so many wonderful women from Gerry&#39;s season who&#39;d be perfect for the role. Runner-up Leslie Fhima, Faith Martin, Ellen Goltzer, Susan Noles, Joan Vassos, and Sandra Mason are just a few of the fan-favorites who&#39;d make an ideal lead for the spin-off. These women are not only beautiful inside and out, but they&#39;ve led interesting lives and are open to a second chance at finding love.




It would be refreshing if the Bachelor franchise included more people in their 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s, and even 50&#39;s in their new programming. Casting younger people in their 20&#39;s could be part of the reason that so many of the relationships fail post-show. Especially on Bachelor in Paradise, many of the contestants seem to be there only for fun, which is fine. However, the pressure of getting engaged is always looming in the background. It would be intriguing to have older contestants on a different type of show. As The Golden Bachelor producers figure out what&#39;s next, hopefully The Golden Bachelorette is their first priority.
