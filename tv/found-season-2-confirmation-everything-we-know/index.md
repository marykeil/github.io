## Literature Review

NBC&#39;s Found offered a pleasant change of pace from the typical procedural format, and now the series has been renewed for a second season. 




Warning! This Post Contains Spoilers For Found Season 1Debuting on NBC in late 2023, Found managed to breathe new life into the tired procedural genre, and it has already been renewed for a second season. The series follows recovery specialist Gabi Mosely who, along with her team, helps to track down missing and exploited people and rescue them from their captors. However, Found takes things a step further by incorporating Gabi&#39;s dark secret-- she keeps her former kidnapper locked away in her basement. Along with the usual case-of-the-week format, Found also weaves a compelling narrative from episode to episode. 




Debuting in October 2023, Found had very little competition since most returning fall series were delayed due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes which brought the industry to a halt for the better part of the year. Critical responses were largely positive, and the series garnered a respectable score on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite being a fledgling series airing during unprecedented times in the industry, NBC saw the potential in the premise and green-lit a second season before the first had even finished airing.

 Found Season 2 Is Confirmed 
          

Just a few short weeks after the show debuted, NBC renewed Found for a second season in a prompt endorsement of the young show. Found was renewed at the same time as NBC&#39;s other freshman program, The Irrational, which also scored high marks in the strike-dampened fall season. It is unclear what the future holds for both shows beyond season 2, but NBC has high hopes that they can represent the next generation of long-running programming after the Law &amp; Order and One Chicago franchises run their course. 






 Found Season 2 Cast 
          

Though the ending of Found season 1 was shocking, there&#39;s no reason to think that the entire main cast won&#39;t return to reprise their roles in season 2. As with the first, fans can expect to see Shanola Hampton return as recovery specialist Gabi Mosely, and they can also expect the return of her long-time adversary Hugh &#34;Sir&#34; Evans, played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar. Though new characters are expected to join the cast as the overarching story gets bigger and more fleshed out, it is the main team that will likely take the starring roles once again. 

Other expected returns include: 

 Actor  Found Role   Kelli Williams  Margaret Reed   Brett Dalton  Mark Trent   Gabrielle Walsh  Lacey Quinn   Arlen Escarpeta  Zeke Wallace   Karan Oberoi  Dhan Rana   








 Found Season 2 Story 
          

Unlike most procedurals which return to the starting position each season to maintain the status quo, Found season 1 took big risks with its finale that will change the series going forward. In episode 13&#39;s shocking twist, Sir escaped from captivity and the dangerous criminal was once again on the loose with nothing but revenge on his mind. As the first season went off the air, Sir made it clear he was going to kill Lacey to stick it to Mosely. 

Besides setting up the obvious conflict for season 2, the twist ending also introduced interpersonal struggles within the team as Mosely was forced to come clean to her entire crew to enlist their help. The full fallout of her actions hasn&#39;t been felt yet, and there may be trouble within the group because of Mosely&#39;s controversial past. Besides all that, Found season 2 will also likely contain a case-of-the-week format where Mosely and the team rescue other kidnapped individuals.
