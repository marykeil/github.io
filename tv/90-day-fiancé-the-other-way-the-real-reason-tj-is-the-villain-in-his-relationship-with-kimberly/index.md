# 90 Day Fiancé The Other Way The Real Reason TJ Is The Villain In His Relationship With Kimberly


## SUMMARY 



  TJ is selfish and only cares about himself, expecting Kimberly to fulfill traditional wife duties without discussing it beforehand.

## Literature Review
Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami is failing to be a good husband to his American wife, Kimberly Rochelle, who’s depressed. He just wants her to return to the U.S.




Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 has proved he’s a terrible partner to his wife, Kimberly Rochelle. The Indian man seemed like a decent match for the Alabama woman when he debuted on the spin-off. However, it didn’t take many episodes for the viewers to learn that the two cast members were awful for each other. Kimberly was a bit too Western to adopt Indian culture and the duties of a traditional wife. Meanwhile, TJ was under his family’s control and didn’t have the backbone to be an understanding partner.




As TJ and Kimberly’s relationship unfolds, they become increasingly bitter towards each other. TJ grew more irritated with Kimberly due to constant complaints and family drama. Simultaneously, Kimberly started second-guessing marrying TJ because the future looked bleak. The two cast members had numerous fights before their wedding day but somehow made it to the holy pavilion. Kimberly soiled her pants on the special day, but that didn’t stop her from marrying TJ. Little did she know, it was probably a bad omen because she got depressed in the next few months. She complained about it to TJ, but he told her to return to the U.S.

 TJ Seems Too Selfish &amp; Only Cares About Himself 
          




Kimberly acted unhinged on numerous occasions during the season. Despite that, it’s hard to say she is the only villain in her relationship. TJ has done nothing of value in his relationship and has proven himself to be a lousy partner from the start. Selfishness is one of TJ’s worst personality traits. The 90 Day Fiancé franchise star remained quiet about all the Indian duties Kimberly was supposed to do. As expected, he changed his behavior right after marriage, asking his American wife to act like a traditional wife and a “caretaker.”



 TJ Comes Across As Uncaring With Regard To Kimberly’s Feelings 
          

TJ has been very unsupportive of Kimberly from the start. He didn’t care about resolving her arguments with his brother, didn’t bother emotionally consoling her, and never tried to understand her side. The only thing TJ did for Kimberly was build a separate home, but he didn’t even ask for her views first. In the later episodes, when Kimberly complained about being depressed, TJ showed no remorse and told her to scram to Alabama. He didn’t even care to hug her to make her feel slightly better, even when she told him to do so.






 TJ’s Emotionally Immature 
          

Like Kimberly, TJ isn’t mature despite being in his early 30s. Moreover, he’s slightly worse at picking fights with co-stars like Sumit Singh and Jenny Slatten and acting superior on social media. TJ isn’t just a bad partner to Kimberly but also not husband material to any Indian woman. He has a lot of growing up to do before he can even think of being a man of the house. TJ is also a bit hypocritical for wanting Kimberly to be the ideal woman when he has zero traits of being a decent patriarch. The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star is still emotionally weak and can’t handle stressful situations.

90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
