## SUMMARY 



  Stranger Things season 5 set photos reveal Eddie Munson&#39;s vandalized gravesite.   Eddie Munson&#39;s association with the Hellfire Club, D&amp;D, and Chrissy Cunningham&#39;s death may explain why his grave was vandalized.   Dustin&#39;s visit to Eddie&#39;s gravesite and his Hellfire Club T-shirt suggest he is honoring his friend and seeking justice for him.

Stranger Things season 5 set photos reveal Eddie Munson&#39;s vandalized gravesite. Following a significant delay due to the dual SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, the highly-anticipated fifth and final season of Netflix&#39;s hit sci-fi series has finally started filming, as recently announced by a behind-the-scenes photo of the Stranger Things cast. Soon after, co-creator and co-showrunner Ross Duffer shared more BTS photos teasing character reunions, new locations, and a potential time jump.




Now, more Stranger Things season 5 set photos have surfaced online (via @kelseyjbarnes and Netflix Geeked on X/Twitter) with some of them showing Eddie Munson&#39;s vandalized gravesite. Check out the photos below:

 Why Is Eddie Munson&#39;s Grave Vandalized In Stranger Things Season 5? 
          

Played by Joseph Quinn, Eddie Munson was introduced in Stranger Things season 4 as the lovable leader of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons group called the Hellfire Club, which includes Dustin and several of his friends. For all his idiosyncrasies, Eddie quickly became a fan-favorite character. His status was only cemented after shredding Metallica&#39;s &#34;Master of Puppets&#34; in The Upside Down and heroically sacrificing himself to save Hawkins during the season 4 finale.

However, early on in Stranger Things season 4, Eddie witnesses Chrissy Cunningham being killed by Vecna and is wrongfully accused of her murder. In the days after Eddie Munson&#39;s death, he continues to be misrepresented as a murderer and cult leader because of his association with the Hellfire Club and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. During the 1980s, the tabletop RPG was associated with Satanism, so it makes sense that someone in Hawkins might vandalize Eddie&#39;s gravestone with &#34;BURN,&#34; presumably in hell.




Dustin was one of Eddie&#39;s closest friends who was also present for his final moments, so it makes sense he would visit his gravesite. Dustin is also honoring his friend by wearing his Hellfire Club T-shirt, and in the set photo, he appears to be wearing Eddie&#39;s rings as well. As more is revealed about Stranger Things season 5, the context of this scene should become clearer.



Stranger Things season 5 is expected to premiere on Netflix in 2025.
