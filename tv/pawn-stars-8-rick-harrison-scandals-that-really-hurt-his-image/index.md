The American businessman is the owner of the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop which his father, Richard Benjamin Harrison, opened in 1989.

 2  Rick Harrison &amp; Castmates Have Been Accused Of Fakery 
Is Pawn Stars Really A Scripted Show?


Pawn Stars is one of the History Channel’s most beloved shows and remains a force to be reckoned with after all these years. Even though Pawn Stars deals with historical artifacts, it has been accused of not being the most realistic show on TV thanks to the strict rules that the cast is supposed to follow. While Rick, the proprietor of the shop, was a celebrity who allegedly spent his time in the store every single day as he met clients and brokered deals, ShowbizCheatsheet reported that Rick spent close to half a year completely off the grid, allowing his employees to run the show.
Like Rick, Corey and Chumlee were also primarily in the shop for filming purposes, while on the rest of the days, they kept to themselves and let their “close to seven hundred” employees operate the shop. “The stars tend to work off of scripts” as per the report, with writers being well-versed with each cast member’s individual personalities to tailor a script for the stars. The sellers are also supposed to be “vet out” ahead of time and are supposed to go through a pre-negotiation process.
