  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The biggest scandals surrounding reality TV star Rick Harrison after his debut on the History Channel&rsquo;s Pawn Stars about his Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop.</p>
<p>Rick Harrison from Pawn Stars is a world-renowned reality TV icon, but popularity has come to him at a price. Also known as “The Spotter” Rick is an expert when it comes to spotting anything fake or stolen. The American businessman is the owner of the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop which his father, Richard Benjamin Harrison, opened in 1989. The 24-hour family store became a part of the series which debuted on July 19, 2009, on the History Channel and took viewers inside the colorful world of the pawn business.
Three generations of the Harrison family, including Rick’s son, Corey &ldquo;Big Hoss&rdquo; Harrison, and Corey&rsquo;s childhood friend Austin &ldquo;Chumlee&rdquo; Russell, became the superstars of Pawn Stars as they used their sharp-eyed skills to assess what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s fake. Besides, the show had its dash of interpersonal conflicts among the cast, offering drama, emotions and anger, which made it all the more entertaining. However, the stars of Pawn Stars also brought some of the drama off camera. Rick has had plenty of scandals surrounding him in the past few years.

<p>8  Pawn Stars&rsquo; Rick Had A Legal Battle With His Own Mom
Joanne Harrison Also Filed For Restraining Order Against Rick</p>
<p>Rick was sued by his 81-year-old mother in March 2022. Joanne Harrison claimed she was cut out of companies, trusts and a safe full of cash and silver. As per Fox59, a lawsuit filed in Nevada’s Clark County District Court, Joanne mentioned how she helped her husband Richard lay the groundwork for the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in 1981. She said she was entitled to ownership in the family businesses and holdings, including the Pawn Shop (47.5%), G&amp;S Pawn Shop (50%), Harrison Properties (35%), and JoRich (100%). However, she alleged that Rick took control of many aspects of the business that belonged to her when her husband died.
Joanne was recovering from a coma in a hospital around 2000-2001. She claimed her son visited her there and convinced her to sign over her 51% shares to him, and she agreed since she didn’t understand the situation. Rick allegedly sent Joanne payments of $25,000 every month from 2018 to the beginning of 2020. However, he apparently reduced her payments to $20,000 in the early months of 2020, which were stopped completely in March 2020. Rick, meanwhile, maintained that his mother was being manipulated by others for their personal gain.</p>
<p>7  Pawn Stars&rsquo; Rick Harrison&rsquo;s Been Accused Of Transphobia
Rick&rsquo;s Anti-LGBT Political Views Exposed</p>
<p>In November 2015, Outfrontmagazine reported that Rick lost product endorsements after he publicly announced his support for Marco Rubio. In addition to supporting the Republican presidential candidate, he also cited transgender bathroom accommodations that worried him. “You have some cities that are saying that if you have a man who feels like he’s a woman, he can use the women’s restroom. I guarantee you that will be taken advantage of by some very bad men who want to go into a bathroom where there’s young ladies,” Rick told CNN in an interview.</p>
<p>6  Rick Harrison &amp; Castmates Were Shamed For Alleged &ldquo;Wage Theft&rdquo;
Wages Of Pawn Stars Employees Questioned</p>
<p>As per Nicki Swift, a report by The New York Daily News said production companies within the entertainment genre were accused of committing &ldquo;wage theft&rdquo; — and the people behind Pawn Stars were named as culprits. A survey was conducted by The Writers Guild of America East in 2013 which determined scriptwriters and producers &ldquo;lose $30,000 a year in unpaid wages by working without breaks and overtime pay.&rdquo; According to the WGAE, Pawn Stars writers and producers &ldquo;earn a minimum of just $2,136 a week.&rdquo; The same positions on scripted shows &ldquo;pull down $6,712” revealing the discrepancies in the wages earned by them and the disgruntled employees of Pawn Stars.</p>
<p>5  A Vietnam Veteran Sued Rick Harrison &amp; His Relatives
Daniel Callahan Claimed Accused The Harrisons Of Alleged Abuse</p>
<p>In May 2012, a disabled Vietnam vet sued the father and son duo of Pawn Stars and claimed that they had physically assaulted him in their Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in October 2011. The 62-year-old man named Daniel Callahan who walks with a cane, filed a civil suit in Clark County District Court saying that he got into a dispute with Rick and Richard, who allegedly placed him “in a chokehold” and dragged him through the store before throwing him onto the sidewalk. Mr Callahan claimed he had brought a model 96B rifle with him to have appraised, and it was also thrown along with him.
Mr Callahan was asking for $20,000 in total damages. Along with that, he also wanted the Pawn Stars celebs to shell out payment of his medical expenses related to the alleged incident and payment of his legal fees, as per NYPost. The attorney representing the Harrisons did not share any comment. It is speculated that they settled out of court.</p>
<p>4  Did Rick Harrison &amp; His Castmates Melt Down A Stolen Antique Coin Collection?
It Was David Walters’ $50,000 Coin Collection</p>
<p>According to a report by DailyMail in 2014, a criminal complaint was filed by the State of Nevada when a woman named Jennifer Beckman allegedly stole her uncle David Walters’ $50,000 coin collection from his home. Jennifer allegedly took the collection, which included a rare 1903 St. Gaudens $20 gold piece and silver Morgan coins from the 1880s to the Pawn Stars Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop. Jennifer reportedly received $12,375 over three visits and by the time Mr Walters noticed that his coins were gone, he contacted Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop to be told they were “already gone.” The coins were melted down before police could recover them.
The spokesperson mentioned that coins are usually kept in plastic cases with a value assigned to them by an expert. If the expert is not someone they trust, the cases are cracked open, and the coins are sent out to be melted down. The spokesperson believed that’s what happened in this case, and the “majority” of the coins were melted down. She claimed that “they weren’t worth” what Mr. Walters thought they were worth.</p>
<p>3  Pawn Stars&rsquo; Rick Harrison&rsquo;s Been Divorced Three Times
Rick Divorced Deanna Burditt Quietly In 2020</p>
<p>Rick has a spotty track record when it comes to marriage, as he has been married multiple times throughout his life. Rick got divorced for a third time in 2020 as per legal documents obtained by TMZ. Rick filed for divorce in Clark County, Nevada, in July 2020, and the cause of the divorce was cited as “irreconcilable differences.” Rick got married to his third wife, Deanna Burditt, in 2013, after having met her in 2011. It was the same year that Rick divorced his second wife, Tracy Harrison. Their marriage had lasted longer, for over 20 years, prior to which Rick was with his wife, Kim Harrison, for just three years.</p>
<p>2  Rick Harrison &amp; Castmates Have Been Accused Of Fakery
Is Pawn Stars Really A Scripted Show?</p>
<p>Pawn Stars is one of the History Channel’s most beloved shows and remains a force to be reckoned with after all these years. Even though Pawn Stars deals with historical artifacts, it has been accused of not being the most realistic show on TV thanks to the strict rules that the cast is supposed to follow. While Rick, the proprietor of the shop, was a celebrity who allegedly spent his time in the store every single day as he met clients and brokered deals, ShowbizCheatsheet reported that Rick spent close to half a year completely off the grid, allowing his employees to run the show.
Like Rick, Corey and Chumlee were also primarily in the shop for filming purposes, while on the rest of the days, they kept to themselves and let their “close to seven hundred” employees operate the shop. “The stars tend to work off of scripts” as per the report, with writers being well-versed with each cast member’s individual personalities to tailor a script for the stars. The sellers are also supposed to be “vet out” ahead of time and are supposed to go through a pre-negotiation process.</p>
<p>1  Richard &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; Harrison Cut His Son Chris Harrison Out Of His Will
Richard Put Rick In Charge Of The Estate</p>
<p>Richard died June 25 at age 77 after a battle with Parkinson’s disease. Richard had earned the nickname “Old Man” when he was barely in his late 30s because of his appearance and personality. Although Richard may have loved all his sons equally, he managed to cut one of them out of his will and put his celebrity son in charge of the estate. In July 2018, The Blast reported that Richard named his wife Joanne and his three children, Rick, Christopher, and Joseph, as beneficiaries. However, in 2017, he had it amended to exclude Christopher from his will.
The updated document read, “I would like to express my love and affection for Christopher Keith Harrison,” before adding that he had “intentionally and with full knowledge” cut him out of the will. The reason why Richard had first named Christopher and then removed him from the will was unclear. Christopher is the youngest of the three sons. Rick was put in charge of the estate as an administrator. The filing did not reveal how much Pawn Stars celeb Richard’s estate was worth.
