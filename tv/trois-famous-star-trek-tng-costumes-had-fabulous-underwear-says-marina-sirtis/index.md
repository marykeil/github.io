# Trois Famous Star Trek TNG Costumes Had “Fabulous” Underwear, Says Marina Sirtis


## SUMMARY 



  Deanna Troi&#39;s outfits on Star Trek: The Next Generation were often not Starfleet uniforms, reflecting her role as ship&#39;s counselor and allowing her to be viewed as a counselor rather than a senior officer.   Marina Sirtis, the actress who portrayed Deanna Troi, preferred wearing civilian clothes and looked better in them according to producers, which influenced her character&#39;s wardrobe choices.   In season 6, episode 10 of TNG, Troi finally gets to wear a Starfleet uniform when Captain Edward Jellico is in command, and she continues to wear it more often throughout the series, taking a more active interest in advancing in the ranks.

## Literature Review
Marina Sirtis had mixed feelings about some of Counselor Deanna Troi&#39;s outfits on Star Trek: The Next Generation, but they had positives, too.




Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) wore many different outfits throughout Star Trek: The Next Generation, but one required a particularly &#34;fabulous&#34; undergarment. Throughout TNG&#39;s seven seasons, Deanna Troi offered counseling to the crew of the USS Enterprise-D, and used her Betazoid senses to aid Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Because Deanna was half Betazoid, she could sense the emotions of those around her, which proved useful when dealing with previously unknown aliens. Despite being a member of the Enterprise-D senior staff, Troi typically wore unitards and dresses rather than a traditional Starfleet uniform.




Although Counselor Troi did not always get the best storylines on TNG, she was an invaluable member of the USS Enterprise-D crew. In many ways, Troi was the heart of TNG, and her relationship with Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) remains one of Star Trek&#39;s best romances. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Marina Sirtis discusses her TNG wardrobe, including the particular undergarments certain outfits required. Read her quote below:


I lost weight over the years, and in the second season they made me the maroon outfit. How much cleavage I showed depended on which one I wore, since they were all cut differently and some were lower than others. And then we got that green dress, the one you wanted to straighten out the neckline on all the time. I wasn’t crazy about the dress, because you had to take the whole thing off to go to the bathroom. But the underwear was fabulous. I had to wear a corset like a merry widow, and then we had what I like to call the industrial-strength, Starfleet-regulation brassiere. This became the standard uniform for every woman on Star Trek, and that’s because the women saw me as me and then they saw me as Troi, and they went, “I want a bra like that,” because it adds inches where there really are none. It is kind of depressing at the end of the day when you take it off.





                  Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast &amp; Character Guide   Star Trek: The Next Generation has one of the most beloved cast of characters in all of science fiction. Here are the major characters of the classic.    


 Deanna Troi Didn&#39;t Get To Wear A Starfleet Uniform Until TNG Season 6 
Captain Jellico made Troi wear a standard Starfleet uniform.
         

Although Deanna Troi had attended Starfleet Academy just like the rest of the crew members, Troi typically didn&#39;t wear a Starfleet uniform. She briefly appeared in a short dress-like uniform (known as a skant) in the premiere of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but never wore that particular outfit again. For the rest of TNG seasons 1 through 5, Troi cycled through several different unitards and dresses. While the official reason for this was never given, Troi&#39;s role as ship&#39;s counselor could provide an explanation. Wearing civilian clothes likely put Troi&#39;s patients more at ease, allowing them to view her as a counselor rather than their senior officer.




The real-world explanation for Troi&#39;s wardrobe is simply that producers and others behind the scenes thought Marina Sirtis looked better in civilian clothes. Despite this, Troi finally donned a Starfleet uniform in Star Trek: The Next Generation season 6, episode 10, &#34;Chain of Command,&#34; when the visiting Captain Edward Jellico (Ronny Cox) is in command of the Enterprise-D. From that point on, Troi would wear the Starfleet uniform more often, and she would eventually take a more active interest in advancing in the ranks. Deanna Troi wore many great outfits throughout Star Trek: The Next Generation, but it was nice to see her finally get to wear the same Starfleet uniform as everyone else.



Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
