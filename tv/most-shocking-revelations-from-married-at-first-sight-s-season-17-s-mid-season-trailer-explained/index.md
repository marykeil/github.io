## Literature Review
The Married at First Sight season 17 trailer dropped at the end of the latest episode and revealed some shocking developments for the couples. 




The Married at First Sight season 17 mid-season trailer dished out a lot of drama for fans to expect. This season was meant to have five couples walk down the aisle and marry a stranger. However, the experiment is down to three couples, and they all have glaring issues. Michael was left at the altar by his runaway bride, and Orion asked for a divorce from Lauren upon returning from the honeymoon before they even moved in together. With the season already down to couples, the mid-season trailer proved to reinvigorate storylines and give hope to a dwindling season.




Becca and Austin had instant chemistry, but they are failing to talk about the hard stuff that could drive them apart. Also, Becca wants intimacy yesterday, and Austin wants to move at a slower pace. Clare is not giving Cameron the space for the affection he needs, and it&#39;s causing their relationship to become unhealthy. Cameron also does not want to raise children with religion, and Clare does, and both see it as non-negotiable. Upon returning from the honeymoon, Brennan announced that he was not attracted to Emily but has not given details on why. Each of the couples has significant issues to address.

While Becca and Austin may seem like they are in tune with each other, it is proving to be a mask on deeper issues. In the Married at First Sight season 17 trailer, Austin expressed how much he loved seeing Becca be good around kids, and Becca revealed that Austin &#34;accidentally&#34; said he loved her. However, Austin was shown confronting Becca about being controlling over his emotions. &#34;After what you said, it kinda makes me feel like you want me to just not think for myself all the time,&#34; Brennan remarked.

On Becca&#39;s side, she will say, &#34;I&#39;m starting to doubt whether Austin is on the same train as me,&#34; as Austin is shown moving to a separate place to sleep. Another scene showed Becca telling Pastor Cal she was facing &#34;days and nights of rejection,&#34; while Austin was heard saying, &#34;I can&#39;t do it.&#34; It looks like Becca and Austin&#39;s strong beginning will be met with some harsh realities that will put their compatibility and desire to be in the relationship to the test.






 Lauren And Orion Will Get Back Together 
         

In a wild turn of events, Orion was filmed on a couch with Lauren saying to her, &#34;I would really like to build a bridge back to you because I am missing our connection.&#34; In another scene, Lauren was shown commenting, &#34;My emotions towards you are open to being open&#34; to Orion. Orion and Lauren had many ugly fights and miscommunications that led Orion to give up on the marriage. Both of their willingness to reset and pick things up again is a major plot twist that may or may not end in disaster.



 Michael Gets Offered Another Married At First Sight Shot 
          

Michael was devastated when his future bride rejected him at that altar. Viewers saw him be resilient and wise in the wake of the unfortunate circumstances, however. That&#39;s why, when Dr. Pepper asks Michael, &#34;Are you willing to get married at first sight again?&#34; in the Married at First Sight season 17 mid-season trailer, Michael&#39;s answer will mean a lot to viewers and Michael&#39;s own life trajectory. Michael&#39;s friend will step in and remind him that he called the dashed experience the &#34;biggest failure&#34; of his personal life. If Michael agrees to give it another shot, the season could get more interesting.






 Emily And Brennan Will Have New And Old Issues 
         

Emily and Brennan have been on a rocky path since returning from the honeymoon, and it looks like it&#39;s only going to get more complicated. In one scene, Brennan was filmed walking off as Emily was left with her friend and said, &#34;I&#39;m getting just very frustrated,&#34; while her friend said, &#34;He&#39;s giving you nothing.&#34; Brennan has been unable to vocalize why he isn&#39;t attracted to Emily, so it looks like it is going to be more of the same from unexpressive Brennan.

Another part showed Brennan telling Emily that one of his deal breakers was needing a super positive person, insinuating that she was not living up to that. Emily responded, &#34;I&#39;m the most positive f***ing person there is.&#34; Brennan&#39;s critical comment won&#39;t land well and could spell new trouble for the pair on top of their already mounting connection issues. The final Emily and Brennan clip showed Emily in a quad bike accident with Brennan by her side during the incident, which could mean they are brought closer together by the situation.






 Clare And Cameron Will Arrive At An Impasse 
         

Clare and Cameron will both arrive at their individual and mutual impasses this season, as the trailers depicts. When sitting down with Orion, Cameron will confide, &#34;This continual toying with my feelings and emotions, frankly, is unsustainable.&#34; A later shot of Clare shows her reflecting, &#34;I can&#39;t meet him where he&#39;s at.&#34; Cameron and Clare have been discovering that while they do really like each other as people, the spark is not there between them. They don&#39;t agree on fundamental things, and Clare does not seem open to exploring any intimacy with Cameron.

The future considerations that will arise between Clare and Cameron are not surprising, but they do indicate that the pair will spell out their differences even more than they already have. Cameron was shown arriving at the Decision Day location, which means he and Clare will at least stick it out until the finale. There was a lot of potential for the pair in the beginning, but the experts seemed to have missed the mark on the fundamentals that are driving them apart.




Based on the Married at First Sight season 17 mid-season trailer, it looks like the dynamics of the couples will be shaken up and will be anything but boring. New and continued storylines will give viewers a lot to consider when making judgments about the couples and their likelihood of succeeding. The trailer has given new life to the season after two pairs fell off the journey.



Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST.
