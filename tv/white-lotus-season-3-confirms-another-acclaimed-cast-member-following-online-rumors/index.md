## Literature Review
The White Lotus season 3, which will be set in Thailand, officially confirms a rumored star will be joining the anthology show&#39;s ensemble cast.




The White Lotus has officially added a rumored cast member to season 3. The HBO anthology show, which was created by Mike White, follows a new mystery each season at a different location of the titular fictional luxury resort chain. Although Jennifer Coolidge reprised her season 1 role as Tanya in season 2, and her season 1 co-star Natasha Rothwell will be returning as Belinda in season 3 (which will be set in Thailand), generally the main cast of each season is entirely new.




After a spate of rumors concerning her casting, TVLine confirms that Carrie Coon will be joining the ensemble in The White Lotus season 3. At the time of writing, no details about her character have been revealed. She joins a cast that also includes Leslie Bibb, Jason Isaacs, Michelle Monaghan, Parker Posey, Dom Hetrakul, and Tayme Thapthimthong.


 Everywhere You&#39;ve Seen Carrie Coon 
          

Carrie Coon joining the White Lotus season 3 cast makes perfect sense, considering the wide variety of television performances she has delivered throughout her career. This includes roles on previous HBO shows, such as playing the widowed Nora Durst in the supernatural drama The Leftovers and the New York City high society newcomer Bertha Russell on The Gilded Age. She has also appeared in What If...?, The Sinner, and Fargo.






Coon was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for Fargo season 3.




In addition to her television roles, Coon has appeared in quite a few prominent movies. This includes playing Ben Affleck&#39;s character&#39;s twin sister Margo Dunne in 2014&#39;s Gone Girl, Thanos acolyte Proxima Midnight in Avengers: Infinity War, and real-life writer Meg Greenfield in The Post. She also played the daughter of Harold Ramis&#39; Egon Spengler in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, a role she will be reprising in the upcoming Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.

Coon has also augmented her career with work on the stage, including a Tony-nominated performance in a revival of Who&#39;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. With so much experience under her belt, Coon has proven herself more than up to the task of approaching the unique tone of the Mike White show. After the explosive The White Lotus season 2 ending, season 3 will have a lot to live up to, but with Coon and her co-stars leading the charge, it could very well fulfill that promise.
