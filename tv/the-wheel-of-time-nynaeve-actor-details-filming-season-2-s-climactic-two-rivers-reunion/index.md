## Literature Review
Nynaeve actor Zoë Robins discusses her experience filming the Two Rivers gang&#39;s climactic reunion scene in Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time season 2.




Star Zoë Robins recounts filming The Wheel of Time season 2&#39;s big reunion for its core ensemble. Based on Robert Jordan&#39;s fantasy series, the second season of the Prime Video epic adapted the second and third novels in the saga, The Great Hunt and The Dragon Reborn, though the show changed several aspects of the books in order to bring a new narrative to life. The Wheel of Time season 2 ended in October 2023, bringing Nynaeve (Robins), Rand (Josha Stradowski), Mat (Barney Harris), Perrin (Marcus Rutherford), and Egwene (Madeleine Madden) back together in a climactic finale moment after the group had been separated for several episodes.




During a recent conversation with Collider, Robins describes the experience of filming the emotional reunion scene. While the actor touches on the characters&#39; reactions to learning Rand was not dead and seeing him accept his place as the Dragon Reborn, she also states that the scene was enjoyable to film from the actors&#39; point of view, saying the cast &#34;are like a family&#34; and &#34;are very excited and very silly&#34; when they are able to film together. See what Robins says about the scene below:


Yeah, it was so exciting, and you&#39;re right, it was the first time, certainly, that the Two Rivers gang had all been reunited. For a few of them — I guess not Mat, but the rest believed that Rand was dead. So it was a very overwhelming moment for a lot of the characters to see Rand alive and then to be declared as the Dragon Reborn. There&#39;s so much happening at once at the end of the season. But for us actors as well, it was just so fun to be with one another. We are like a family, so it&#39;s always wonderful to have your family on set with you. We don&#39;t often get those moments, and when we do, we are very excited and very silly, and it&#39;s fun.






 What To Expect From Nynaeve In The Wheel Of Time Season 3 
          

After a triumphant performance from Robins in The Wheel of Time season 1, who earned praise for her work as Nynaeve, the actor delivered once again in season 2. Nynaeve faced several obstacles, both in terms of being unable to help her friends due to the channeling block precluding her from using the One Power and through her journey of trying to become an Aes Sedai. The character&#39;s separation from Egwene saw her form a new partnership with Elayne (Ceara Coveney), a relationship which will likely continue to develop in The Wheel of Time season 3.



The Wheel of Time season 3 is set to adapt the fourth Robert Jordan book, The Shadow Rising.







Season 3 may also see Nynaeve embracing more of her power after the frustrations she experienced being blocked in season 2. In particular, there will be a significant storyline for Nynaeve in season 2, which has already been teased by Robins and occurs in Jordan&#39;s fourth book. With Elayne set to continue sharing the screen with Nynaeve in The Wheel of Time season 3, that partnership will evolve as the contrasting pair continue to butt heads and learn to work together.

                  A Major Wheel Of Time Change Sets Up A Book-Accurate Season 3 Story For Elayne &amp; Nynaeve   A key change to the source material in Wheel of Time season 2 will allow the series to tell a book-accurate story for Elayne and Nynaeve in season 3.    

While season 3 was announced in July 2022, there is currently no official release date. Season 2 left several questions unanswered and even introduced a mysterious new character, setting a compelling foundation for the upcoming episodes. Luckily for fans of Robins&#39; character, she and the rest of the Two Rivers gang will return in The Wheel of Time season 3.
