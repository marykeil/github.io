 What To Expect From American Idol Season 22 
          

The American Idol season 22 promo includes the judges and Ryan looking at signs for the hometowns of Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Iam Tongi, and Adam Lambert, indicating that the show will once again pay tribute to its rich history. Through the &#34;Idol Across America&#34; virtual auditions, which kicked off on August 2, 2023, contestants could try out for the show from anywhere in the country. For the first time ever, singers were allowed to audition within a specific genre category, rather than by city. Contestants eventually were able to audition in front of the American Idol judges, Lionel, Katy, and Luke, in order to earn their golden tickets to Hollywood.

The American Idol judges--Katy, Lionel, and Luke--along with Ryan, have developed a wonderful rapport with each other. As they enter their seventh season together, it&#39;s clear that they once again intend not only to serve as judges, but also to entertain the audience with their fun personalities. This Wizard of Oz promo is reminiscent of their annual Disney Nights, during which Katy dresses up in elaborate costumes of favorite Disney characters. Here she is the perfect Dorothy with her light blue and white dress and sparkling ruby slippers. In addition, Luke, Ryan, and Lionel are dressed in clothing reminiscent of the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, respectively.




The new American Idol season 22 promo is very exciting, especially because of its whimsical Wizard of Oz theme. It&#39;s thrilling when Katy clicks the heels of her ruby slippers, and says, &#34;There&#39;s no place like American Idol.&#34; After 21 seasons, the show really does feel like home. There&#39;s a special feeling of hopefulness when American Idol seasons begin because they prove that anyone from anywhere could possibly become the next music superstar. It&#39;s very inspiring to watch and is the reason that American Idol is still the best reality singing competition on television. There&#39;s truly nothing else like it.

American Idol season 22 premieres February 18, 2024 on ABC.
