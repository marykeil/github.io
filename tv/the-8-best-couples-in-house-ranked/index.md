## Literature Review
There were quite a few couples over the course of eight seasons of House, M.D., but some surely worked better together than others by a long shot.




House, M.D. may be a medical drama, but it had its fair share of romance on the hospital grounds over the years. This show was full of dysfunctional characters who got together to form even more dysfunctional couples. Despite this, even the most bizarre relationships had their good days. From Chase and Cameron&#39;s all-too-realistic love story to every concerning affair that House had, House, M.D. offered a fascinating look into workplace relationships that more often than not ended catastrophically for all the parties involved, serving as a cautionary tale for outside viewers.
The star diagnostician and the head of the hospital&#39;s flirting was entertaining to watch all throughout the series, but they were never going to last. There was never any chance that House and Cuddy would end up together in House, M.D., and yet their relationship was what made the later seasons of the show truly stand out. The rest of House&#39;s diagnostics team weren&#39;t any better in the affairs of the heart, but they too had a few touching romantic moments in the series. House, M.D.&#39;s relationships weren&#39;t perfect fairytales, but some of them were easier to resonate with than others.
            
 
 10 Times Gregory House Was A Complete Jerk 
Gregory House&#39;s shtick was that he was a medical genius who was also a lovable misanthrope, but there were quite a few times when he was just a jerk.













 








 8  Chase &amp; Cameron 
Seasons 2–6


 







Dr. Robert Chase and Dr. Allison Cameron&#39;s relationship was one of the longest-lasting ones in House, M.D., which didn&#39;t mean that it was either the best or the strongest. They got off on the wrong foot — Chase was a lot more interested in Cameron than she was in him, and she was still stuck on House. The two had a few heartwarming moments on the show, and the chemistry between Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer was electric, but the characters were rather toxic to each other for the most part. It was no surprise that Chase and Cameron got divorced in House, M.D.





 7  Foreman &amp; Thirteen 
Seasons 5–6
        

Dr. Eric Foreman and Dr. Remy &#34;Thirteen&#34; Hadley made for an unlikely couple, and yet they clicked both on a professional and personal level. Although this relationship had a lot of potential, Foreman and Thirteen ended up being too different to last long-term. Over the course of House, M.D., Foreman got more and more power-hungry, selfish, and stubborn, and that didn&#39;t sit well with Thirteen, who ended their relationship after Foreman fired her. Still, the two were sweet at the beginning, especially during the Huntington&#39;s trial storyline when Foreman was willing to risk everything to help Thirteen.





 6  House &amp; Dominika 
Seasons 7–8
        

Dr. Gregory House frequently made strange decisions when it came to his love life, but nothing was stranger than his decision to aid Dominika Petrova with getting a Green Card by marrying her in House, M.D. season 7. Despite the fact that House and Dominika&#39;s relationship wasn&#39;t real at first, the two grew to care for each other later on. They had matching personalities that allowed them to get along rather well, which was a true feat for House as it was, but the genius doctor messed everything up when he decided not to tell Dominika that her citizenship had gotten approved.





 5  House &amp; Stacy 
Before season 1
        

House and Stacy Warner were involved before the start of House, M.D., and they clearly loved each other. House&#39;s pain issues were the focus of several episodes, and season 1, episode 21, &#34;Three Stories&#34; told the story of how House injured his leg in the first place and what Stacy had to do with it. If it hadn&#39;t been for House&#39;s bitterness about Stacy&#39;s decision to remove the dead tissue in his leg, they would likely have continued to be happy together. Stacy knew how to handle House&#39;s insufferable personality, no matter how difficult that task was. It is a shame that things didn&#39;t turn out differently for House and Stacy.





 4  Chase &amp; Moira 
Season 8
        

Moira Parker was a patient of Chase&#39;s in House, M.D. season 8. Although she didn&#39;t stay for long on the show or in Chase&#39;s life, she made quite an impact. After the disastrous marriage to Cameron, Chase deserved to be loved, and Moira could have been a new beginning for him. Their relationship was wrong on so many levels since Chase was Moira&#39;s doctor, but they had an undeniable spark that was impossible to ignore. Unfortunately, they weren&#39;t meant to be endgame because Moira chose to return to her monastic life once she recovered from her illness.





 3  House &amp; Cuddy 
Seasons 5–7


 







Dr. Lisa Cuddy was an essential part of the show, and her will-they-won&#39;t-they relationship with House was one of its highlights. Much like Stacy, Cuddy knew how to make House play relatively nice, and that was part of why House was attracted to her from the beginning. Hugh Laurie and Lisa Edelstein had amazing chemistry, which contributed to the popularity of House and Cuddy as a couple. In the end, House was too much to handle even for Cuddy, and he crossed the line when he drove his car into her living room in the season 7 finale &#34;Moving On,&#34; prompting Cuddy to quit her job and Edelstein to leave House, M.D. for good.





 2  Wilson &amp; Amber 
Season 4
        

Dr. James Wilson was a deeply flawed human being with more failed marriages than it was possible to count, and yet he was so charismatic and lovable that it was difficult not to root for him. Dr. Amber Volakis took both House, M.D. and Wilson&#39;s heart by storm. Wilson and Amber fit like two peas in a pod, and it finally seemed like Wilson&#39;s love journey would have a happy ending. Instead, Amber was badly injured in a bus crash and died in Wilson&#39;s arms in the season 4 finale &#34;Wilson&#39;s Heart.&#34; Her death was truly heartbreaking and went on to haunt both House and Wilson.





 1  House &amp; Wilson 
Seasons 1–8
        

House and Wilson were never romantically involved, and yet they were more of a couple than anyone else in House, M.D. They were both walking disasters when it came to actual relationships with women, but they were there for each other when it mattered. House and Wilson went through thick and thin together, and they constantly bickered like an old married couple. In the season 8 finale, &#34;Everybody Dies,&#34; House even faked his own death to go off the radar and be with Wilson in his final months. That might not have been intended as a romantic gesture, but it was the sweetest thing anyone ever did in House, M.D.
