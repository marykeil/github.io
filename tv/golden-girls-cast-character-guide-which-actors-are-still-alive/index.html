  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The beloved sitcom The Golden Girls broke new ground over its time on the air, and the cast had prolific careers before and after the show debuted.</p>
<p>The classic sitcom featured an all-star line-up, and some of the Golden Girls cast had major careers before and after the show was on the air. Debuting in the fall of 1985, the series follows a group of older women who live in Miami and bond over their shared life experiences and complicated love lives. Over its seven-season run on the air, The Golden Girls not only boosted its roster of established stars like Betty White and Bea Arthur, but it also went on to be one of the most progressive TV shows of its time.</p>
<p>The Golden Girls broke new ground because of its portrayal of independent mature women, and the series was frequently a platform for other issues including race, class, and sexual identity. The series was a critical success, earned 68 Emmy nominations, and it found new life on streaming. The Golden Girls&rsquo; short-lived sequel, The Golden Palace, kicked off a number of spinoffs, but none were able to capture the magic of the original. While cast members like Betty White were already famous from their years in TV, The Golden Girls turned its big four into bona fide household names.</p>

Arthur Passed Away In 2009 At The Age Of 2006</p>
<p>Played by Bea Arthur in the cast of The Golden Girls, Dorothy Zbornak is a no-nonsense gal whose quick temper is offset by her acerbic and biting wit. Already a decades-long veteran of the small screen by the mid-1980s, Arthur had made a big splash as the title character in the All in the Family spinoff Maude. Around the same time, she graced the big screen as Vera Charles in the Hollywood adaptation of the musical Mame and memorably appeared in the notorious Star Wars Holiday Special. Arthur passed away in 2009 at the age of 86.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most well-remembered of Betty White&rsquo;s TV and movie roles, the comedic legend plays Rose Nylund, the ditzy and lovable retiree who often regales her pals with strange stories from her life on the farm in Minnesota. White rose to fame in her long-running stint as Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. After her time in the cast of The Golden Girls, White also played several notable movie characters, including Bitey White in Toy Story 4 and Grandma Annie in The Proposal. The celebrated actor died in December 2021, just weeks before her 100th birthday.</p>
<p>Rue McClanahan As Blanche Devereaux
McClanahan Passed Away In 2010 At The Age Of 76</p>
<p>As part of the main cast of The Golden Girls, Rue McClanahan plays the Southern belle Blanche Devereaux, who though recently widowed is often on the lookout for a man and is usually picked on by her friends for her playful promiscuity. Outside of her roles in Hollywood movies like Starship Troopers where she played a biology teacher, McClanahan&rsquo;s claim to fame came on TV with roles like Fran in the cast of Mama&rsquo;s Family, and she had previously worked with co-star Bea Arthur when she played Vivian on Maude. McClanahan died in 2010 at the age of 76.</p>

Getty starred as Tutti alongside Sylvester Stallone in the buddy cop movie Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot, and she played department store owner Claire Timkin in Mannequin.

The accomplished supporting actor was already a veteran of the big screen by the time he arrived on the sitcom, and he is best known for the role of Murray in The Odd Couple. Edelman also played Harry Pepper in the film adaptation of Barefoot in the Park, and Bill in the classic drama The Way We Were. In 1996, Herb Edelman died at the age of 62.</p>
