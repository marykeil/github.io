## Literature Review
Exclusive: Original star Keith David offers an optimistic response to the chances of his returning for Disney&#39;s live-action Gargoyles reboot show.




With Disney finally moving forward with a new iteration of the property, Keith David addresses the chances of returning for the live-action Gargoyles reboot. The &#39;90s animated show revolved around the titular group of supernatural warriors who awaken after 1,000 years in Manhattan and attempt to adjust to the modern world while working with a police officer to bring peace to the city. Various efforts have been made to reboot Gargoyles, including multiple movies from G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&#39;s David Elliot &amp; Paul Lovett and Jordan Peele, only for Disney to order a live-action show produced by James Wan and The Conjuring Universe vet Gary Dauberman set as showrunner.




During his interview with Screen Rant for Prime Video&#39;s Hazbin Hotel, David opened up about the live-action Gargoyles reboot. When asked whether he had been contacted by Disney to be a part of the project, the original show star confirmed that he has yet to hear from the studio about returning for the reboot. He did, however, assure that he &#34;would do it in a New York heartbeat.&#34;


 How David Could Return For The Gargoyles Live-Action Reboot 
         

Starring as the leader of the titular group, Goliath, David&#39;s role in Gargoyles served as one of his big breakthroughs in the world of voice acting, having already made a name for himself in live-action with multiple John Carpenter collaborations, including The Thing and They Live, as well as Platoon. The three-time Emmy winner has since become one of the most renowned actors in the field, starring in everything from HBO&#39;s Spawn animated show to the English dub of the Studio Ghibli classic Princess Mononoke, Disney&#39;s The Princess and the Frog and playing the US President in Rick and Morty.




With David&#39;s passionate fanbase largely lining up with that of Gargoyles&#39;, it would be somewhat of a missed opportunity if Wan and Dauberman didn&#39;t reach out to him to try and line up some kind of appearance for the live-action reboot. Given details remain unknown for how the eponymous creatures will be brought to life, the creative team could take a CGI approach akin to that of the Michael Bay-produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies, thus leaving the door open for David to reprise his role as the voice of Goliath. A fellow Disney project, the upcoming X-Men &#39;97, a revival of the classic animated show, is seeing much of its original cast reprising their roles, thus giving some precedence for this to happen.

Even if he doesn&#39;t play Goliath, there are a variety of other options for David to appear in the live-action Gargoyles reboot. With him now being older, the star could take on the role of the Gargoyle Elder Hudson and serve as a mentor figure to a new actor taking on his original character, or could even find himself on the other side of the battle in playing one of the show&#39;s key antagonists, David Xanatos. Whatever path Wan and Dauberman decide, David&#39;s enthusiasm for for being part of the reboot should inspire them to get in touch with him for a part.






All three seasons of the original Gargoyles are available to stream on Disney&#43;!
