## Literature Review
Ahsoka is the story that should have been told with the Star Wars sequels, a perfect balance of honoring the past while still offering something new.




Ahsoka is the story the Star Wars sequels should have told. Currently streaming on Disney&#43;, Ahsoka takes place during the early years of the New Republic, set in the same period as The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. While it&#39;s been revealed that these New Republic-set shows are all building toward a bigger theatrical crossover, it&#39;s easy to see the narrative in Ahsoka as one that should have taken the place of the sequels.




It&#39;s no secret that Disney and Lucasfilm&#39;s sequel trilogy of Star Wars films stands as some of their most controversial collection of projects set in the galaxy far, far away. In contrast, Ahsoka has become one of its most well-received, having skyrocketed in popularity and celebrated for its overall plot. As such, there are a few key reasons why the narrative being told in Ahsoka (and likely beyond) is the better sequel trilogy story.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    


 Ahsoka Is Exploring The Legacy Of Anakin Skywalker 
Ahsoka Represents All The Good Anakin Left Behind
         

Ahsoka shines brightest with Anakin Skywalker&#39;s legacy. Having given his life to save his son Luke in Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader was redeemed as the Jedi Knight he once was before his corruption to the dark side. To that end, Ahsoka takes great care when exploring all aspects of Anakin&#39;s legacy through the eyes of his former apprentice during the Clone Wars, the titular Ahsoka Tano herself. Having left the Jedi Order before the events of Order 66, Ahsoka survived during the Dark Times, having seen what her master became which resulted in deep levels of regret that she wasn&#39;t there to help him.




As seen in Ahsoka during Tano&#39;s quest to prevent the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn, Anakin&#39;s spirit appears before Ahsoka in the Force nexus known as the World Between Worlds. The reunion between master and apprentice also provides a key opportunity for Ahsoka to face both her past and future as Anakin confirms Ahsoka is still an extension of his legacy and that of the Jedi, embodying everything he was and all that he wasn&#39;t on her own personal Jedi path, one she recommits herself to in the new Star Wars series thanks to her master&#39;s guidance.

Seeing how Anakin&#39;s Force ghost was featured watching over Ahsoka and her own apprentice Sabine Wren, the hope is that Anakin Skywalker&#39;s legacy will continue to be explored in future seasons of Ahsoka. After all, Anakin&#39;s role was far greater in this single show when compared to the entire sequel trilogy, only getting a single line of dialogue in The Rise of Skywalker.



 Ahsoka Has Added New Depth To The Skywalker Saga 
Elevating The Legacy Of The Prequel and Original Trilogies
          




One of the biggest criticisms of the sequel trilogy is how much the movies and its characters develop and progress at the expense of the movies and characters that came before. Luke Skywalker is certainly the biggest and most controversial example, having removed himself from the entire galaxy after becoming disillusioned with the ideals of the Jedi following his personal failure to help his nephew&#39;s temptation to the dark side.

Subverting all expectations and hopes that Luke would have continued to be a shining beacon of hope who could have guided Rey, Luke was a cynical hermit for the vast majority of The Last Jedi right up until his demise, offering Rey very little in the way of actual Jedi training. In comparison, Ahsoka is largely considered to be so good as it instead found ways to elevate the Skywalker saga and its connected projects such as The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. For Anakin Skywalker in particular, the nexus protagonist of the entire saga is given his own progression right alongside Ahsoka herself.




Ahsoka proves that Anakin Skywalker became a true agent of balance by fulfilling the Chosen One prophecy, a role that clearly continued following his death as evidenced by his desire to finally complete Ahsoka&#39;s training during their World Between Worlds reunion. Likewise, Ahsoka&#39;s &#34;graduation&#34; and understanding of Anakin&#39;s teaching is effectively the moment she becomes a Jedi Knight. In turn, this finally gave Anakin the posthumous rank of Jedi master as a result. In short, a newer character&#39;s journey helped elevate a preexisting character as seen in Ahsoka, rather than developing at their expense as was seen in the sequels.



 Ahsoka Tells A Different Kind Of Star Wars Story 
New Spaces Are Still Being Explored
          



Ahsoka introduces fresher concepts such as new galaxies, as well as characters who hadn&#39;t been seen before in live-action like Grand Admiral Thrawn who is fully a military threat, rather than having Force abilities.







For all Ahsoka did to honor the legacy of the Star Wars movies and shows that came before, it also struck a strong balance with new material. Ahsoka introduces fresher concepts such as new galaxies, as well as characters who hadn&#39;t been seen before in live-action like Grand Admiral Thrawn who is fully a military threat, rather than having Force abilities. While the Force is still present thanks to its Jedi heroes such as Ahsoka, Ezra, and Sabine, darker Force-wielding antagonists have emerged such as the Nightsisters and their magicks, not to mention brand-new characters such as the Dark Jedi Baylan Skoll and his apprentice Shin Hati.

While familiar in its connections to the past and holding similar thematic beats, Ahsoka is undeniably a different kind of Star Wars story that promises to continue exploring new spaces with a potential Ahsoka season 2 or in other connected shows. In comparison, the sequels were a bit oxymoronic in that they simultaneously compromised prior arcs while still trying to bank on pure nostalgia with its mirrored narrative construction, particularly where the original trilogy was concerned.

A Truly Entertaining Balance
          



Ahsoka and its future connected stories could be the surrogate sequel trilogy that should have been told by Lucasfilm from the very beginning.




As the Star Wars franchise heads toward this Mandalorian-era crossover movie directed by Dave Filoni, Ahsoka should definitely be seen as the gold standard that is looked to by both Lucasfilm and Disney. Seeing how Filoni served as the creator of Ahsoka, it should be quite easy to do just that. All things considered, it certainly looks as though this new era of the Star Wars timeline is in good hands with the ability to succeed where Star Wars&#39; sequel trilogy unfortunately missed the mark. Ahsoka and its future connected stories could be the surrogate sequel trilogy that should have been told by Lucasfilm from the very beginning.
