## Literature Review

A Big Brother legend reveals that her mother sent in an application for The Bachelor for her because she didn&#39;t like her boyfriend at the time.




Big Brother legend and Big Brother Reindeer Games alum Britney Haynes revealed that she was almost cast on The Bachelor because her mother sent in an application after she didn&#39;t like her boyfriend at the time. Britney has since gotten married to Nathan Godwin on March 18, 2012. Together, they have three daughters: Tilly, Minnie, and Rhue.




In an interview with Dan Gheesling on The Dan Gheesling Podcast (shared by Dan via Instagram), Britney told Dan that she was dating the guy she was in a &#34;committed relationship&#34; with when she was on Big Brother 12, but her mother &#34;hated&#34; him, so she sent in the Bachelor application behind Britney&#39;s back.


 

Britney said that her phone rang, and she thought it was Big Brother confirming that sheâ€™d made it onto the show. However, instead it was the people from The Bachelor leaving her a voicemail. Britney added that she never returned the call, but she called her mom, saying, &#34;Mom, I have a boyfriend!&#34; Her mom responded, &#34;Not for long. You should go on The Bachelor.&#34;

 Britney Haynes&#39; Big Brother Journey Explained 
          

In 2010, Britney did end up getting cast on Big Brother 12, during which she became a fan-favorite because of her competitive spirit and hilariously sarcastic Diary Room commentary. She placed fourth that season, after winning one Head of Household and three Power of Veto competitions. Britney was also voted America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest. In 2012, during Big Brother 14, Britney came back as a coach and later joined the game. She placed eighth that season. Britney returned again in 2023 to play Big Brother Reindeer Games, during which she placed fifth.

On Big Brother Reindeer Games, Britney proved that she still had the drive to win, sometimes surprising even herself with her successes. When she faced the challenge of retrieving a Christmas ornament from a hamster wheel maze, she felt defeated because she didn&#39;t think she&#39;d be able to do it in the time allotted. However, she wanted to prove to her daughters that anything was possible. Despite the odds against her, Britney completed the challenge. It was one of the most inspiring moments of the season and proved why Britney is considered one of the best competitors to ever play Big Brother.




Although it&#39;s hard to imagine Big Brother without the iconic Britney, she also would&#39;ve made a fantastic Bachelor contestant. Not only is she beautiful, but she has a wonderful personality. If her Big Brother Diary Room sessions are any indication, her Bachelor confessional commentary would&#39;ve been epic. However, Britney thought that she was more suited for Big Brother, and the rest is history. She shines so brightly that she lights up every show she appears on. Hopefully, Britney will turn up on television screens again in the near future.
