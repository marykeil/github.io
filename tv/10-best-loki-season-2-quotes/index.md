## Literature Review
Loki season 2 has delivered some fantastic lines of dialogue, not just from the Trickster God himself, but from the entire cast as well.




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Loki Season 2.
Season 2 of Loki has managed to be perhaps the best MCU offering of 2023, thanks in no small part to some seriously quotable dialogue. As far as Marvel characters go, Loki has always been particularly quotable, the God of Mischief&#39;s dry sense of humor combined with Tom Hiddleston&#39;s impeccable timing never failing to leave an impression. But Loki&#39;s eponymous spin-off series, particularly the recent second season, developed his character even further through thoughtful dialogue while also expanding on the minds of characters exclusive to the show.
The tone of Loki is a master of many worlds, able to seamlessly incorporate irreverent humor and tense, tear-jerking drama in equal measure. Season 2&#39;s best lines of dialogue show off this range, with Mobius, Sylvie, O.B., and of course, Loki himself espousing some clever lines that only get better the more they&#39;re thought about. Context can also make all the difference as well, with seemingly simple lines of dialogue becoming incredibly poignant when the wider scope of the narrative they take place in is examined.









 








 10  &#34;Do you think this is a higher priority than preventing a temporal meltdown?” 
Season 2, Episode 2 &#34;Breaking Brad&#34;
        

Season 2 of Loki has helped continue the renaissance of Ke Huy Quan&#39;s return to acting, featuring him as the wholesome and helpful O.B. The tech genius behind the T.V.A.&#39;s science fiction devices, the beginning of season 2 sees O.B. struggling to maintain the Temporal Loom, barely staving off the collapse of the timeline, when Loki and Mobius ask to tear him away from his work for help on a lesser matter. With a genuine, yet sarcastic-sounding response every tech support worker can relate to, O.B. bluntly asks the two to reassess the urgency of the matter, knowing that his efforts would be better spent maintaining the Loom.





 9  “Everything you’ve been doing is wrong, and all your gods are dead.” 
Season 2, Episode 1 &#34;Ouroboros&#34;


 







The end of season 1 unveiled the shocking revelation that every employee of the Time Variance Authority has been kidnapped from pruned timelines. Not only that, but the supposed gods that were said to be at the head of the T.V.A. were revealed to be nothing more than a cover for He Who Remains, maintaining a reasonable cover to secure the zealous loyalty of his workers. Dryly lamenting this fact, Mobius resorts to some gallows humor to help his fellow victims to make sense of the matter.





 8  “The outcome to this equation remains the same…you lose.” 
Season 2, Episode 6 &#34;Glorious Purpose&#34;


 







The season 2 finale of Loki is endlessly quotable, with so many climactic storylines coming to a head and being tied off in a shockingly satisfying manner. But before any of this payoff can begin, Loki visits He Who Remains, seeking an answer to the unstable timeline that doesn&#39;t involve the killing of him or Sylvie. Aiming to instill a sense of hopelessness into the hapless god to make him realize the futility of his actions, He Who Remains coldly lets him down with this line, ironically, only making Loki&#39;s desire to find a way to &#34;change the equation&#34; all the stronger.





 7  “Not squirrel, not possum, not rats. Something that’s already dead, and nothing with a face…Please.&#34; 
Season 2, Episode 1 &#34;Ouroboros&#34;
        

After the tumultuous finale of Loki&#39;s first season, the Loki variant Sylvie found herself in Broxton, Oklohoma in the year 1982, contained within a branched timeline. Stepping foot inside the first sign of civilization, a McDonald&#39;s, she&#39;s asked what she wants to eat by a chipper fast food employee. Her gruesome response evokes some pretty brutal imagery that alludes to what Sylvie likely had to do to survive on the run from the TVA, both before and during the events of the series. After what she&#39;d been through, a Big Mac would probably seem like a welcome change of pace.





 6  “Wow! That makes perfect sense! There’s no flaw in that logic!” 
Season 2, Episode 1 &#34;Ouroboros&#34;
        

It&#39;s no surprise that as a series that relies on time travel, Loki can get pretty confusing. Between the technical jargon, branching timelines, and multiple iterations of the same character, it&#39;s a wonder that casual audiences are able to keep up. In a somewhat fourth-wall-breaking moment, O.B. essentially directly calls out the show itself for this, blurting out this line with a tone so earnest that it sounds sarcastic. It&#39;s a cheeky suggestion to the audience from the writer&#39;s room to not try too hard to break the tenuous logic of the timeline-hopping adventure.





 5  “All my life, I’ve always handed down the same verdict: Guilty. And the time keepers deemed it so” 
Season 2, Episode 1 &#34;Ouroboros&#34;
        

A big theme of season 2 of Loki is the questioning of authority. With the T.V.A.&#39;s grip on the sacred timeline rapidly deteriorating, the entire organization has precious little time to come to grips with the fact that they&#39;d been gaslit for untold decades, their worldview being shattered with the revelation of the sacred timeline&#39;s true purpose and the origin of each T.V.A. employee as variants. Judge Gamble takes things particularly hard, ruminating on her past efforts and naïveté with this thoughtful piece of dialogue.





 4  “Yeah, but I’ll know!” 
Season 2, Episode 6 “Science Fiction”
        

While this short line doesn&#39;t seem like much on paper, context makes all the difference for it leaving a big impact. When Mobius is reset back into his old life as Don, with no memories of his time at the T.V.A., we get a glimpse as to just how dedicated of a father he was. As Loki asks him for his help, promising him that he&#39;ll be able to leave and come back without his kids even knowing, Don refuses to budge, clarifying that he&#39;d still know that he was spending time away from his children, despite how nebulous time has become in the series.





 3  &#34;I know what kind of god I need to be.&#34; 
Season 2, Episode 6 &#34;Glorious Purpose&#34;
        

The incredible season finale of Loki&#39;s second season was a triumphant finale for the character&#39;s arc within the context of the greater MCU. Rather than continuing to live selfishly as he had, Loki sacrifices everything to become the God of Stories, a living temporal loom that personally oversees the flow of time. Before ascending to take his place, the reformed trickster villain utters these words, ominously accepting the immense gravity of his new fate in the multiverse.





 2  &#34;We die with the dying, we&#39;re born with the dead.&#34; 
Season 2, Episode 6 &#34;Glorious Purpose&#34;
        

When Loki confronts He Who Remains&#39; &#34;reincarnation&#34;, the Kang variant reveals that it was always his intention to allow Sylvie to kill him, knowing Loki would have to come back in time to stop it. Faced with the impossible choice to make the ultimate sacrifice, Loki muses on his situation, quoting a T.S. Elliot poem, &#34;Little Gidding&#34;. The poem is very appropriate, reflecting on never-ending cycle of birth and death, past and future, and redemption, all themes the Loki series is drowning in.





 1  &#34;For you. For all of us.&#34; 
Season 2, Episode 6 &#34;Glorious Purpose&#34;


 







At first, Loki&#39;s final words to his friends in the series before taking his place as the God of Stories is simply a bittersweet evocation of his love for his friends, put further analysis reveals the line is so much more than that. In a brilliant callback, Loki mirrors his last words in Thor, bringing his journey of character growth full circle all the way back to his first appearance in the MCU. Allegdly, this line was actually suggested by Tom Hiddleston himself, proving that no one else could&#39;ve brought the role of Loki to life quite like him.
