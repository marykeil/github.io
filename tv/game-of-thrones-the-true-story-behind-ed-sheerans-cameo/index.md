## Literature Review

Ed Sheeran had an unforgettable cameo in Game of Thrones, but his role didn&#39;t have the best reception. Here&#39;s why he appeared in the first place.




There were many controversial moments in the final seasons of the HBO series, but the Ed Sheeran Game of Thrones cameo was a surprise that didn&#39;t sit well with viewers. Sheeran is an award-winning and hugely popular singer/songwriter who appeared in season 7&#39;s &#34;Dragonstone&#34; of the HBO fantasy series based on the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R. R. Martin. As unexpected as the moment was, the story behind the Ed Sheeran Game of Thrones cameo helps to explain the random appearance, even if it doesn&#39;t quite help with how the moment was received.




Aside from veteran actors like Sean Bean and Charles Dance, the Game of Thrones cast was mostly made up of lesser-known actors who shot to fame thanks to the popularity of the series. This fresh-faced ensemble worked well, but it was all the more noticeable on the rare occasions when a more familiar face would pop up on the show. This was certainly the case with the Ed Sheeran Game of Thrones cameo which was met with a rather negative response and a lot of questions about why the famous singer was brought onto the show in the first place.

The singer&#39;s immense popularity at the time was a major factor in Ed Sheeran&#39;s Game of Thrones cameo, but it was also done as a treat for a cast member. During a South by Southwest panel from 2017 (via Vanity Fair), Game of Thrones creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff confirmed Sheeran&#39;s cameo came to be as a surprise for Maisie Williams, who played Arya. Since she was a major fan of the singer, Weiss and Benioff attempted to score the cameo for years, and it finally came to fruition for season 7.

Rather than a blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it appearance, Sheeran was given a speaking part, including an opportunity to sing a song. Of course, Williams had to be involved in the sequence to carry out the cameo considering she was the driving force behind the casting.

Despite only appearing in one episode of Game of Thrones, the fate of Sheeran&#39;s character was revealed in Game of Thrones season 8. Eddie and fellow members of the Lannister army were present for the Battle of Goldroad, in which Daenerys found victory with the help of Drogon. According to prostitutes hired by Bronn, Eddie survived but suffered serious burns, including the loss of his eyelids. It&#39;s unclear if the legacy surrounding Sheeran&#39;s role led to Eddie&#39;s fate as the buzz-worthy Game of Thrones cameo didn&#39;t go well.

With House of the Dragon&#39;s season 2 on the horizon, the creators may be eager to add new celebrity cameos into the mix. Weiss and Benioff made a smart decision by keeping their celebrity appearances brief and primarily musicians, rather than big-name celebrities. That being said, the Game of Thrones spinoff series&#39; creators might be wary of another Sheeran-esque disaster. Game of Thrones at least added an interesting layer to the special appearance by explaining Eddie&#39;s dire fate.






 Other Musicians Appeared On GoT 
Several Cast Members Were Lesser Know Musicians
         

Though Ed Sheeran&#39;s Game of Thrones cameo was certainly the highest profile of the series, the show has featured a lot of appearances from musicians. In fact, there are several cast members on the show whose musical careers are as prolific as their acting careers. Kristian Nairn, who plays Hodor, is a long-time guitar player and DJ. Alfie Allen, who portrays Theon Greyjoy, is the brother of popular British pop singer Lily Allen.

In addition, the Hold Steady version of the Westerosi song &#34;The Bear and the Maiden Fair&#34; appears in Game of Thrones season 3, episode 3, &#34;The Walk of Punishment.&#34; Either way, Ed Sheeran isn&#39;t the only musician to make an appearance in the popular medieval fantasy series.

In various episodes throughout seasons 4 and 5, Joel Fry of the alt-pop band Animal Circus appeared as the recurring character Hizdahr zo Loraq. The character was previously a slaveholder in Meereen, and was briefly betrothed to Daenerys Targaryen. Coldplay drummer Will Champion also appeared in the infamous episode &#34;Rains of Castamere where he helped play the Westerosi song &#34;The Rains of Castamere&#34; just before Robb Stark and others were killed at the Red Wedding.




Dr. Feelgood&#39;s Wilko Johnson is in various episodes of seasons 1 and 2 as the man who executed Ned Stark, Ser Ilyn Payne. Michiel Huisman of the Dutch band Fontane also shows up in several episodes, but this time during seasons 4-6 as sellsword Daario Naharis. The entire band Mastodon appears in season 5&#39;s &#34;Hardhome&#34; as wildlings. These Game of Thrones cameos are only a drop in the bucket, as members of bands like Of Monsters and Men, Raleigh Ritchie, Sigur RÃ³s, and Snow Patrol also appear, among many others.



 Why Ed Sheeran&#39;s Game Of Thrones Cameo Wasn&#39;t Liked 
Game Of Thrones Is Not A Show That Can Maintain Its Reality With Celebrity Appearances
          

While it was nothing compared to the backlash of Game of Thrones season 8, Ed Sheeran&#39;s Game of Thrones cameo was not warmly received by fans when it aired. Despite the sweet reasoning behind the appearance, many fans heavily criticized the moment for being distracting. While it is unfair to put the blame on Sheeran himself or to vilify the showrunners who wanted to include him in a small role, it is easy to see where some of the backlash came from.




There are faults in the series to be sure, but one thing Game of Thrones did so well from beginning to end was to immerse the audience in this new world. Using George R.R. Martin&#39;s rich source material, the show excelled at world-building while still being accessible to the viewers. As it turns out, the reality of Westeros they built was delicate and Sheeran&#39;s cameo momentarily shattered it. While the show managed to include recognizable actors like Ian McShane or Max von Sydow, Sheeran is a figure fans know exclusively in a modern setting.

The image of seeing one of the biggest pop stars on the planet appearing on Game of Thrones dressed as a Lannister soldier broke the illusion of the show. It did not help that Sheeran sang a song during his Game of Thrones cameo, further reminding fans who he was and that he didn&#39;t belong in this world. However, well-intentioned the appearance might have been, it seems it was a misguided cameo that was not well-suited for Game of Thrones.
