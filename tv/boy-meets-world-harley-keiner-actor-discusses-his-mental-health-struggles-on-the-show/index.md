It was very, very difficult. I pulled up to the table read, I hopped out of my Cadillac convertible, and had adopted a dog, and brought the dog on set. I was at the table read, and I thought everything would be fine. I just felt this meltdown at the table, and I remember Blake helped me. I dropped the script on the floor, and he was so nice he picked it up for me. He’s like ‘Give him a minute. Just give him a minute.’ I remember just winding down. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t talk.
