  The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale reveals that Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur, and his chosen fiancé Theresa, a 70-year-old security professional, will be getting married live on television.   Though they have only been engaged for a few months, Gerry and Theresa are rushing into marriage because they both feel like they have found the right person and want to seize the opportunity.   Both Gerry and Theresa have experienced long and successful marriages in the past, and they are excited to begin their new life together in Charleston, South Carolina.  







The Golden Bachelor lead Gerry Turner and his new fiancé revealed why they’re rushing into marriage despite getting engaged just a few months ago. Gerry is a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana. He is a father, grandfather, and a widower who lost his wife Toni in 2017. Gerry became the first senior-aged man to lead the Bachelor franchise when he chose to find someone who matched his personality and was willing to play sports with him. The leading man had 22 women on The Golden Bachelor vying for his attention, but only Theresa Nist and Leslie Fhima made it to the finale.

Gerry ended up choosing Theresa, a 70-year-old security professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, in the finale and, according to their interview with People, the newly engaged duo has already decided on a wedding date. Gerry and Theresa will be getting married live in a televised ceremony. They have less than a month to plan their big day as The Golden Wedding will air on Thursday, January 4, 2024. Gerry is in no mood to wait, as he said, “​​When you&#39;re in your 20&#39;s and you put something off for a year, it&#39;s a very small percentage of your life,” during his interview. Gerry spoke about his clock ticking faster as he’s in his 70&#39;s.





 Theresa Nist Reveals If She&#39;s Fine With Getting Married So Fast 
          

Gerry is also 100% sure he found the right woman for him. “So it&#39;s like, why not?” he remarked. Theresa, too, is on the same page as her fiancé. “I met the man of my dreams,” she gushed. It wasn’t in their original timeline to marry so quickly. “But to be presented with the wedding of our dreams? Spectacular, incredible, wow!” Theresa said about the golden opportunity. She was in her first year of college when her high school sweetheart, William “Bill” Nist, went to Berlin when he was drafted during the Vietnam War. Theresa’s late husband kept telling her, “I want to marry you, let&#39;s get married.”


 




When he returned to attend his brother’s wedding in June 1972, she only had three days to plan her first wedding. Gerry wanted Theresa to “savor all of the anticipation and the joy and the planning and everything” because of how rushed her first time had been. He asked her if she was fine with the timeline. “Do you feel like you get cheated a little bit in it?” he asked his wife-to-be. Theresa didn’t feel like she was cheated at all. She is now looking forward to the wedding, which she knows is “going to be incredible.”

Theresa was married for 42 years to Bill, while Gerry was married to his high school sweetheart Toni for more than 40 years until her death in 2017. Gerry and Theresa had a very similar love story. He described Theresa as “a woman who knew how to maintain a relationship” because she had a successful marriage with Bill. The Golden Bachelor couple was surprised with a trip to Italy, which they will now use as a honeymoon. It’s been years since ABC dedicated an entire special to the wedding of a Bachelor Nation couple. Gerry and Theresa will start their new life together in Charleston, South Carolina.
