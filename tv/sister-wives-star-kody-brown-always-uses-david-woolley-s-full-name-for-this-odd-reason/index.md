## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Kody Brown has tried to be accepting of Christine Brown&#39;s new husband David Woolley, but his insecurity has taken over.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown may claim he’s okay with his ex-wife Christine Brown’s new relationship with David Woolley, but one strange habit he’s picked up has confused fans. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Kody’s relationship with Christine continued to have a major impact on his life, as he was working through the pain and betrayal he felt from her decision to leave. While Kody’s relationships with Meri Brown and Janelle Brown were impacted tremendously by his reactions to the split with Christine, his marriage to Robyn Brown was able to stay intact through his difficult emotions. Christine, alternately, was able to move on to a new relationship successfully.




Sister Wives fans have noticed that Kody has been using David’s full name when speaking about Christine’s new husband, and many find it odd. Reddit user Significant_City302 questioned the habit, asking, “Why does Kody keep saying David’s full name? Like why does he have to go &#39;David. David Wooley&#39; every single time?...Is this a tactic to put him down in some way? It&#39;s just weird.” While some came to Kody’s defense, others like DoomPile5 agreed it was odd, sharing, “He probably read somewhere that addressing someone by their full name would make him seem more authoritative and intimidating.” Others noted that he might be differentiating between Christine&#39;s David and Robyn&#39;s ex, also named David.

 What Does Kody Brown Think Of David Woolley? 
          

While David and Kody have met before, it’s clear that the men aren’t exactly fans of one another. Another Reddit user, Few_Percentage4960 explained, “He uses David’s last name over &amp; over because he is a manipulator. We all know what David he is referring to &amp; using his last name is his narcissistic, manipulative behavior coming out!” Kody, who has been called a classic manipulator, has shown time and time again that his relationships with others are often positioned for him to gain the upper hand. While David said that he’ll be respectful of Kody as Christine’s ex-husband and the father of their children, Kody isn’t interested in the same courtesy.


 




During Sister Wives: One On One, David joined Christine in her interview with host Sukanya Krishnan to speak out about their relationship’s quick turn from strangers to soulmates. Throughout the conversation, David was polite to Kody, though he was critical of his behavior when it came to his relationships with his kids. In contrast, Kody shared that while he was hoping to respect David and Christine’s decisions, his relationship with Christine had colored his experiences with David. Though it’s not necessarily true that Kody only uses David’s full name as an intimidation tactic, it appears that there’s a level of insecurity in his behavior, as it makes Kody feel superior.

With Sister Wives season 18 over and Sister Wives season 19 on the horizon, the relationship between Christine, Kody, and David will continue to be revealed to the audience and become even more complicated. With Christine and David’s two-part wedding special currently airing, Kody’s resistance to David isn’t going to help make their relationship a constructive one. Though their time together on Sister Wives will likely be limited, their relationship will be something everyone can get invested in.




Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
