## Literature Review
A 90 Day Fiancé fan finds evidence that Kimberly Rochelle, one of the stars of The Other Way season 5, is threatening a critic with witchcraft.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Kimberly Rochelle threatened her critics with witchcraft as she continues to dig her own grave. Kimberly is a 30-year-old from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, who claims she is clairvoyant, claircognizant, and clairaudient. Kimberly said it was her spirit guides that led her to Tejaswi Goswami (aka TJ) by giving her a glimpse of him in her dream. She saw her and her future partner in a desert, riding dune buggies, and she could just tell how happy she was. What Kim did not tell the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 cameras was that she was a failed actor as well.




Meanwhile, Kimberly appears to be taking her mystical powers seriously as she was seen threatening someone on her YouTube page by Reddit user 666to666.


 

The fan shared a screenshot where a comment on 90 Day Fiancé cast member Kim&#39;s profile read, &#34;I pray for this man mental health having to deal with your crazy karen self lord tell that man to runnnn for his life.&#34; Kim used her Positively Kimberly LLC profile to ask them, &#34;Do you really think the best decision to do is cyber bully someone who you think is crazy and is into witchcraft.&#34; Kimberly warned her critic that she is someone who can &#34;distribute karma&#34; without lifting a finger.

Kimberly said she was &#34;legitimately curious&#34; about why the critic mocked someone as powerful as her without thinking twice. User lavenderpenguin asked why Kimberly thinks she can “distribute karma without lifting a finger” but couldn&#39;t even get TJ to be honest with her about household expectations before marriage. Meanwhile, ill_ethereal, seemingly a fan from India, wondered if Kimberly is even familiar with the concept of karma because it is not something that can be distributed but is a result of an individual&#39;s own actions from a previous life. A viewer named zombiecattle commented that they were shaking in their boots because of Kimberly&#39;s witchcraft warnings.

Kimberly being clairvoyant has been occasionally questioned since she couldn&#39;t foresee that her relationship was going to go south once she moved to India. If Kimberly can supposedly punish her enemies with her magic, she could have easily taught TJ&#39;s family, especially his brother Yash Goswami, a lesson for the way they supposedly behaved towards her in India. Kimberly&#39;s biggest enemy right now might be Jenny Slatten, who called her out for disrespecting India and Indian culture during the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell-All. However, Jenny&#39;s social media posts suggest she&#39;s living her best life in India with Sumit.




Kimberly, meanwhile, is in America and has been there since September 2023. She claims her screaming scene in the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way finale was filmed over a year ago. However, it doesn&#39;t mean that she has changed. TJ and Kimberly are apparently still together, but she is making it look like she has no plans to go on. Kimberly has become one of the most loathed cast members since her debut in The Other Way season 5, and it&#39;s starting to look like there&#39;s no going back for Kimberly now that she&#39;s turned further into the dark side.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
