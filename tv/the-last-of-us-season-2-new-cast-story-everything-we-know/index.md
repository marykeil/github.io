## Literature Review
Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey will return for a second season of HBO&#39;s The Last of Us, which adapts the successful video game franchise.




The Last of Us season 2 is on its way after the action-packed first chapter of HBO&#39;s video game adaptation. Season 1 of HBO&#39;s The Last of Us proved to be a hit with Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey providing mesmerizing performances as Joel and Ellie â€” and there was very little doubt The Last of Us season 2 would be confirmed. The chemistry between the two is unique and believable, progressing with each episode as the main characters form a powerful bond in a post-apocalyptic world. Unlike many zombie shows and video-game adaptations alike, The Last of Us invests a lot of time in the drama of its characters, offering compelling character studies that lead up to a memorable (and quite shocking) finale.




The season 1 finale sets up The Last of Us season 2 in many ways, starting with Joel&#39;s shocking dilemma where he chose to prioritize Ellie&#39;s life over humanity after he discovers the Fireflies plan to kill her in order to create a cure. While Joel kills many people trying to stop him in the hospital, it seems that his actions will have consequences as one Firefly did manage to escape his wrath. Given that the Last of Us II takes place five years in the future, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how the writers and showrunners will adapt the source material again for The Last of Us season 2 (especially since the sequel game has more stories to tell).
