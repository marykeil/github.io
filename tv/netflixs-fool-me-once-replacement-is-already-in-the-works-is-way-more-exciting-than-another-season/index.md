## SUMMARY 



  Fool Me Once, based on the novel by Harlan Coben, is unlikely to have a second season due to its miniseries format and singular source material.   However, Netflix is developing a new show based on Harlan Coben&#39;s Myron Bolitar series, which promises thrilling moments and potential for multiple seasons.   The Myron Bolitar series, with its 11 books, offers ample material for Netflix to explore and break the trend of single-season adaptations of Coben&#39;s works.

The show is chilling and gripping, leading to viewer anticipation for a second season.

Unfortunately, though, it does not seem likely that another season will be coming to Netflix.

Though some may be disappointed that a second season of Fool Me Once isn&#39;t likely to be on the way, there is another exciting project that is in production and could serve as the show&#39;s perfect replacement. It has been confirmed by Deadline that a show based on the Myron Bolitar series is in the works at Netflix. Like Fool Me Once, the Myron Bolitar series is packed with thrilling moments that allow viewers to remain in anticipation.




The exciting series follows a character named Myron Bolitar, who is a former NBA basketball star and sports agent.

The Myron Bolitar series could be the first series based on Coben&#39;s novels to break this trend. Given that there are eleven books in the series, there is so much for Netflix to explore across multiple seasons, which was not the case for Fool Me Once.




Coben has also shared with Deadline that the goal for this new series is for it to not be limited like the previous ones. He explained that with this series, there are so many books and stories and the character was meant to be an ongoing one. This has translated into the goal being for the series to be an ongoing one as well.
