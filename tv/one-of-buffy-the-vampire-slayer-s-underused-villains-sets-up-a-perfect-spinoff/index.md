## Literature Review
Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#39;s reboot could benefit from focusing not on the show&#39;s existing heroes, but on one of its most underrated villains instead.




While a Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoff could bring back Sarah Michelle Gellar’s eponymous heroine, a new series could also be an opportunity to explore one of the most underrated villains in the original show. Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a lot of great villains. However, many of them never lived up to their potential. As a monster-of-the-week series, the show often introduced antagonists who were interesting and scary but dropped them after only one appearance. For example, the infamous voice-stealing Gentlemen from season 4, episode 10, “Hush,” would have been creepy enough to sustain an entire season of most other supernatural TV shows, yet they only made one appearance.




As such, it would make sense for Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s reboot to explore these monsters in more depth. After all, the show’s inventive villains were one of the main selling points of the series, and even the antagonists that had entire season-long arcs dedicated to them were often left under-explained. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was busy illustrating the complex relationships between Buffy, Spike, Willow, Xander, and the rest of the Scooby gang. As such, some great villains slipped through the cracks, and the show’s follow-up could now center on these figures, especially since the original cast members may not return for the revival.

                  Why Buffy The Vampire Slayer&#39;s Faith Spinoff Never Happened (&amp; What It Could Have Covered)   The universe of Buffy the Vampire Slayer could have expanded even more with a spinoff focused on Faith, but sadly, it never happened.    


 A Buffy The Vampire Slayer Spinoff Could Answer Many Questions About The First Evil 
The First Evil’s original series appearance didn’t explain much of its backstory
          




Introduced back in season 3, The First Evil was one of the most powerful Buffy the Vampire Slayer villains ever. The shape-shifting entity was a non-corporeal being that could take on the appearance of anyone, living or dead, and the monster used this ability to manipulate the show’s heroes. Interestingly, The First Evil couldn’t do any real damage on its own, since it was only capable of assuming the appearance of other beings and not inhabiting their bodies. This intriguing limitation made the villain sneakier than many of Buffy’s foes and allowed The First Evil to become a truly threatening presence in the show&#39;s final outing, season 7.

The First Evil was the main villain of season 7, with the monster embodying everyone from Spike to Drusilla. However, viewers didn’t learn much about The First Evil itself during this outing, beyond the fact that its existence predates humanity, demons, and the universe itself. As an embodiment of all evil, The First Evil lived up to its name and had been around since time immemorial. However, as a result of this, viewers never received specific information on its backstory. The monster’s modus operandi was similar to Stephen King’s Pennywise as the ageless evil inhabited different forms depending on its target, although The First Evil couldn’t inflict physical harm.






 A First Evil Spinoff Could Take Place At Many Points Of Buffy&#39;s Timeline 
This Buffy the Vampire Slayer villain has a lengthy history to explore
          

Since it is one of the only eternal villains in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe, a spinoff could pick up at any point in time and the powerful First Evil would be around. It is tough to work out whether this potential spinoff would focus on the perspective of the villain itself or its victims, as both approaches have their merits. If the spinoff was told from The First Evil’s perspective, it could be an anthology-style series where a different being from a different time period was confronted by The First Evil in every episode and had to defeat the villain or fall for its charms.

Alternatively, the spinoff could instead focus on the Slayers trying to hunt down The First Evil throughout human history. Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s star-studded cast offered guest stars a lot of meaty bit parts, and a spinoff that focused on The First Evil could do the same by casting new stars as Buffy’s predecessors. Viewers might not know a lot about The First Evil’s backstory, but fans do know that the Slayers of the show’s universe have been keeping demons and vampires in check for centuries. As such, a spinoff that focused on The First Evil could go back to the first Slayers.






 Why This Villain Sets Up The Perfect Buffy The Vampire Slayer Spinoff Story 
Buffy’s reboot wouldn’t necessarily need to worry about returning stars
         

A spinoff centered around The First Evil would be promising because this could expand the lore and dig into a new part of the timeline. However, there is another selling point to this premise. Going back to the past wouldn&#39;t necessitate bringing the original cast back, something that could be an obstacle for many other spinoffs. Most ideas for a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot would require the return of Sarah Michelle Gellar, if not the entire original cast, and this might not be feasible. As a result, a spinoff that focuses on a major villain would feel like part of the show’s universe without necessitating comebacks from cast members.

Some viewers might prefer to see the Buffy the Vampire Slayer cast reunited, but it is worth remembering that the original series didn’t rely on nostalgia for its premise to succeed. Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s innovation was a lot of its charm, and there are few ideas more innovative than a spinoff that focuses on one of the show’s villains instead of its heroes. This conceit could make for a compelling Buffy the Vampire Slayer follow-up that offers more than mere fan service to the show’s sizable following.
