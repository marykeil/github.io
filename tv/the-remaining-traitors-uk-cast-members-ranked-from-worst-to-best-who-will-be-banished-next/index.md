## Literature Review

The Traitors UK is past the halfway point, and some players have better strategies than others. Here&#39;s the remaining cast ranked from worst to best.




WARNING!
SPOILERS FOR THE TRAITORS UK SEASON 2, EPISODE 8 AHEAD!
The Traitors UK has passed the halfway point, and it&#39;s time to rank the remaining players in gameplay. The Faithful have become increasingly shrewd when it comes to catching Traitors, but only because of Traitors turning on each other. Some weaker players have been weeded out, and any mistake garners suspicion from the rest of the cast. While The Traitors may have poisoned Diane, she didn&#39;t die in vain. Her son, Ross, is unfortunately not adequately filling her shoes.
As one of the best reality TV shows, it&#39;s no surprise The Traitors UK season 2 has garnered much interest and investment. While The Traitors US season 2 has also premiered, The Traitors UK is ultimately better, casting regular civilians rather than seasoned celebrities. Claudia Winklander is a venerable host and even pokes at the Faithfuls when they&#39;re far off with their suspicions. Episode 8 was the most shocking episode of The Traitors UK yet, upping the ante for future banishments and murders. Although some cast members remain because of their intelligent gameplay, the days of others are numbered. Who are currently the best and worst players on The Traitors UK?









 








 16  Ross 
The Worst Player On The Traitors UK Season 2

Without a doubt, Ross may be the most useless player The Traitors has ever seen. Not only is he consistently incorrect, but he&#39;s loud and confident about it. While his mom, Diane, was way too vocal to win the game, she at least brought some intelligent arguments to the round table. Ross is such a bad Faithful he&#39;s working for the Traitors. Luckily, the Traitors don&#39;t have to take him out-- he&#39;ll get himself banished soon enough if he keeps making such off-base accusations. It&#39;s embarrassing to watch him play.





 14  Evie 
Second Worst Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  






 13   
Unlike Ross, Evie isn&#39;t a particularly vocal player. However, that&#39;s part of the reason she&#39;s useless. She tends to go along with the crowd and offers little to no insight of her own. Evie is so obviously Faithful that when she and Miles offer Diane drinks, no one even seriously considers Evie a Traitor. The Traitors would be unwise to waste their vote on Evie. Letting her stay around and do nothing for a couple more episodes is better.





 12  Mollie 
Third Worst Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  






 11   
Similarly to Evie, Mollie is a relatively useless Faithful. Her insistence on needing a shield was perplexing, given she was not on anyone&#39;s radar as a threat. While she&#39;s made it this far on being a quiet, unsuspecting Faithful, that gameplay can&#39;t last a whole game. Mollie may have made it to the top 10, but unless she becomes more of a threat or starts playing the game, she doesn&#39;t deserve to make it to the finals.





 10  Zack 
Fourth Worst Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  






 9   
Zack, like Diane, is just too loud, making him an easy target for the Traitors. While he&#39;s suited a purpose for this long, his bold accusations are bound to get him murdered sooner rather than later. He&#39;s too obvious for the Faithful to consider him a Traitor, but they will kill him if he starts accusing Andrew and Harry of being Traitors. He might be gone at the beginning of the next episode. The outburst at Charlotte may have been his comeuppance.





 8  Jasmine 
Fifth Worst Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  






 7   
Jasmine is an ok player on The Traitors. She&#39;s not the best at finding Traitors, but she genuinely tries to voice her opinion and gather facts for the team. Jasmine both listens and puts theories of her own out there. It&#39;s better than sitting back and forcing others to make decisions, like Evie and Mollie. Jasmine must prove herself in the coming episodes to stick around. She would be wise to team up with Jaz.





 6  Charlie 
Average Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  

Alongside Jasmine, Charlie is an average player on The Traitors. She&#39;s not in too much danger of getting banished or murdered at the moment, but the heat will turn up as the episodes go on. Charlie is one of the more obvious Faithfuls, with most seeming to think she&#39;s genuine. She could become a secret weapon for the Faithfuls or be easily swayed by poor sleuths Ross and Zack.





 5  Harry 
Fourth Best Player In The Traitors UK Season 2


 












 4   
Even before Paul was banished, Harry was the strongest Traitor, but he might have gotten too big for his britches. He&#39;s taken on Paul&#39;s cocky attitude, and while he&#39;s flown under the radar the entire game, he shared a little bit too much information in his takedown of Paul. Shrewd players would be wise to read between the lines and realize he did to Paul precisely what Paul did to Miles in the previous episode. Harry must shed his pride, wipe the crocodile tears from Jonny&#39;s banishment, and go back to listening and offering less information. He currently looks quite suspicious after Paul&#39;s banishment.





 3  Andrew 
Third Best Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  

Andrew struggles to be a Traitor, which makes him a great player. He feels conflicted with his new status and isn&#39;t reveling in murder like Harry and Paul did. Andrew is appropriately suspicious of Harry&#39;s motives and is ready for anything. While he will likely grow into his newfound Traitor role in the coming episodes, his cautious attitude might be the best thing for him and even allow him to take Harry down if he gets too suspicious and cocky.





 2  Charlotte 
Second Best Player In The Traitors UK Season 2
       The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast  

Charlotte gave one of the most convincing arguments of any Faithful at the round table, proving she&#39;s a more venerable competitor than her fellow players may have thought. She was able to take the heat off of her intelligently and reasonably explained why Zack targeted her and why she got upset. Charlotte could look past her friendship with Paul and accuse him of being a Traitor, thus being one of the first to take him down once and for all. As long as she avoids murder, she has proven to be an intelligent player.





 1  Jaz 
Best Player In The Traitors UK Season 2


 







Jaz might be on the chopping block, but he&#39;s the best player in The Traitors. From the start, he was right about Paul and saved himself for a while because he would be a suspicious murder after Paul&#39;s banishment. Hopefully, he sees Ross as just a bad player and not a Traitor recruit, and he&#39;s the most likely Faithful to deduce Harry&#39;s immaculate takedown of Paul as evidence of him being a Traitor. If he can get rid of Harry, he might win the game. Otherwise, Jaz is in danger. His bravery is part of what makes him the best player on The Traitors UK.
The Traitors UK airs on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays at 9 p.m. GMT on BBC.
