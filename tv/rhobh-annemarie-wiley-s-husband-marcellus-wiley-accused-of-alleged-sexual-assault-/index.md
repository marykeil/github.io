## Literature Review
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills newbie Annemarie Wiley&#39;s husband, Marcellus Wiley, has been accused of sexual assault after a 1994 incident.




New The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member Annemarie Wiley is under fire after her husband, Marcellus Wiley, was accused of sexual assault while in college many years ago. While viewers have yet to meet Annemarie officially, she was confirmed as a cast member for RHOBH season 13 a few months back. She is slated to appear in next Wednesday&#39;s brand-new episode, as she was featured in the preview for the upcoming episode. However, it seems some news surrounding her husband is taking the spotlight.




In a lawsuit shared by Us Weekly, Annemarie&#39;s husband, Marcellus, was accused of sexual assault and rape by an unidentified former female student while attending Colombia in the 1990s. The lawsuit was filed on November 21, stating that the events happened to the accuser during the fall of 1994 while attending the same college together. The unidentified woman shared that Marcellus has raped her &#34;multiple times in her dorm room.&#34; She also revealed that she was a virgin before her encounter with Marcellus.

 Marcellus Has Denied The Assault Allegations 

 




Shortly after the allegations were made public, Marcellus appeared on an episode of his Brinx TV show, Never Shut Up, to deny the accusations made against him. Early today, for Thanksgiving, Annemarie shared a photo on Instagram with Marcellus and their three children, seemingly standing by her man. She wrote in the caption, &#34;My incredible family. An amazing husband. Thriving children...I take none of this lightly or for granted. Blessed beyond belief, and Thankful for it all. Happy Thanksgiving.&#34;

Despite Marcellus denying these allegations, the lawsuit goes into further detail about the alleged assault. The woman claims that she and Marcellus were friendly before the attack happened when she was a freshman, and he was a sophomore in college. She also went into detail about the assault, claiming he said to her, &#34;Ain’t nobody tryina have sex with no virgin!&#34; before arriving at her dorm.

She reported that he &#34;lifted [her], forced her face-down down onto the mattress, and climbed on top of her” before pinning her “face-down on the bed” by her “forearm on the back of her neck.” The accuser said she &#34;feared for her life&#34; and even tried to escape him before he physically pulled her back. She allegedly reported the assault to the school, but the residential dean at the time said that since she “was not from America,&#34; she &#34;misinterpreted [Marcellus&#39;] conduct.&#34;




Since The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 13 was filmed months prior, they likely will not discuss Annemarie&#39;s husband&#39;s assault allegations. It seems both Annemarie and Marcellus are denying the allegations and sticking by each other during this time. Maybe Andy Cohen will have something to say when they film the reunion.



The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
