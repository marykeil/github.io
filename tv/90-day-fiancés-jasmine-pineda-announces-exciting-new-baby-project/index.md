## Literature Review
After moving to the United States, 90 Day Fiancé’s Jasmine Pineda works on her passion project, which involves assisting new immigrants.




Jasmine Pineda from 90 Day Fiancé has started new volunteering work since moving to the United States. The mom of two is best known for her dramatic personality. Most recently, she exploded on Gino Palazzolo after suffering an allergic reaction. During a recent episode of 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Jasmine got skin rashes that she felt were due to her beau’s dirty house. However, Gino didn’t admit to it and told Jasmine that her apartment in Panama was far more filthy. The two cast members butted heads instead of finding a solution.




Jasmine’s relationship with Gino clearly has its issues. However, her new volunteering work seems to be going well. In a recent Instagram story, the 90 Day Fiancé star told her fans that she has decided to use her platform to “advocate for good causes.” She wrote, “my new baby project is helping immigrants who are not fluent in English to acquire language skills.” Jasmine shared she hopes to help people communicate. She added, “you can always make a difference,” stating that she’s doing good deeds because it eventually pays off in “major proportions.”

 Jasmine Pineda’s 90 Day Fiancé Journey Explained 
          




​​​​​It has been a long time since Jasmine began dating Gino. The couple met months before they appeared on the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off in 2021. At the time, they got engaged but soon split up and reconciled in the following season. Jasmine’s notorious actions made her a villain in many viewers’ eyes. However, she later redeemed herself by proposing to Gino and begging him to take her back. Now, the pair are working through their relationship issues in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. However, they have too many differences to overcome before tying the knot within 90 days.

It’s great that Jasmine has decided to use her social media reach to help people. She is an ideal candidate for her baby project, as she has personally faced the same challenges she aims to help people with. Jasmine has been in an international relationship with Gino for years. She knows how tough it can be for a foreigner to settle in the United States and be functional. Previously, Jasmine&#39;s job was teaching English Literature as well. She has the right experience with communication, which will allow her to help others.




Despite the positives of Jasmine’s baby project, it’s oddly convenient that she began volunteering just when her social media image dwindled. Over the months, many viewers have started despising her for her actions and loud personality. She has been accused of being controversial and a terrible partner to Gino. Jasmine may have devised the volunteering plan to remedy the damage her on-screen actions have caused on social media. She may be trying to improve her odds and stay in the limelight by pulling the right strings to get 90 Day Fiancé fans emotional.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
