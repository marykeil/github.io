## Literature Review
Kalani Faagata is more serious with Dallas than many 90 Day Fiancé fans may have imagined. She has now shared a surprising photo of him on Instagram.




Kalani Faagata from 90 Day Fiancé took her relationship with Dallas Nuez to another level. The 35-year-old mom of two last appeared in 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 to fix her marriage with Asuelu Pulaa. While she did try her best, she was unable to overcome her husband’s past infidelity and decided to dump him in the finale. After the spin-off concluded, Kalani embraced her relationship with the man she hooked up with when Asuleu gave her a hall pass. The 90 Day Fiancé alum became Instagram official with Dallas in late October 2023.




Recently, Kalani reached another new milestone with her boyfriend. She posted a photo of Dallas with her sons, Oliver and Kennedy. The reality star wrote, “You’ll get a full pic someday, not today,” telling fans that she will soon stop hiding her beau’s face with emojis in the photos.

          

Dallas’ photo with Oliver and Kennedy shows that Kalani has finally introduced him to her sons and become more serious about the relationship. The picture proves that the Orange County native is confident about building a future with Dallas.

 90 Day Fiancé Star Kalani &amp; Dallas&#39; Relationship Explained 
          

Kalani and Dallas’ relationship began when Asuelu cheated on his wife and gave her a hall pass to kiss another man. He presumed that his American wife wouldn’t cross the line, but she went above and beyond to hurt him back. Kalani found Dallas on social media and started talking to him. She then met and hooked up with him. During the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, Kalani revealed that her intention was simply to kiss Dallas, but the whole thing just escalated into them being intimate with each other. Kalani confidently owned up to her infidelity on the show and even spent a night with Dallas behind Asuelu’s back.


 




It’s great that Kalani is happy with her current relationship with Dallas. Over the years, she wasn&#39;t happy with Asuelu and wasn’t able to do anything about it. Previously, Kalani alleged that she was held down to have a second baby with her Samoan ex when she didn’t want to do it. She claimed that she fell out of love with Asuelu because of how many times he cheated on her since their marriage. Kalani did appear on 90 Day: The Last Resort to fix her marriage, but she likely knew it was too late for her and Asuelu.

While Dallas seems like a nice match for Kalani, she probably shouldn&#39;t get too comfortable with him yet. She needs to test her new boyfriend before getting more serious with him. Dallas met Kalani on social media and hooked up, knowing she was a married woman. He didn’t wait for Kalani to get a divorce or permanently end things with Asuelu. If Dallas can do what he did with Kalani, he can do the same with another married woman. Dallas could be just as bad as Asuelu, if not worse.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
