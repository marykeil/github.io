## Literature Review
The Masked Singer&#39;s John Schneider is overshadowing winner Ne-Yo after posting a controversial message that is currently under investigation.




The Masked Singer just crowned a new winner, but it&#39;s runner-up John Schneider who&#39;s getting most of the attention right now for all the wrong reasons. During The Masked Singer season 10 finale, Cow, Gazelle, Sea Queen and Donut delivered their final performances. After the first round, Cow and Donut advanced to the Final 2. Sea Queen was unmasked as singer Macy Gray, while Gazelle turned out to be Pretty Little Liars star Janel Parrish. Then the Final 2 went head-to-head, and Cow came out on top. When his mask was removed, he was none other than singer Ne-Yo. Runner-up Donut ended up being John, star of The Dukes of Hazzard.




John&#39;s ability to celebrate his second-place finish on The Masked Singer season 10 has been cut short after FOX canceled whatever remaining media appearances he had scheduled, according to THR. This abrupt move comes amid John&#39;s controversial post on Twitter just after the finale in which he said, &#34;Mr. President, I believe you are guilty of treason and should be public hung [sic].&#34; While the post was eventually deleted, screenshots have been making the rounds on social media. The Secret Service is now investigating the matter, with a source telling Deadline, &#34;This falls under the definition of a threat.&#34;


 John Schneider Denies Threatening President Biden 
          

John adamantly denied that he threatened President Joe Biden, telling Deadline, &#34;I absolutely did not call for an act of violence or threaten a U.S. president as many other celebrities have done in the past.&#34; He wants critics to &#34;re-read&#34; what his social media post said and &#34;pay attention to the words before believing this nonsense.&#34; It&#39;s easy for social media comments to get misinterpreted. However, the words in his original comment were extremely clear. According to Deadline, if the Secret Service finds that he made a credible threat and he is found guilty, he could land in jail for as long as five years and have to pay a fine of $250,000.





 

John made it all the way to The Masked Singer season 10 finale, even though he&#39;s more well known for his acting roles on such shows as The Dukes of Hazzard and The Haves and the Have Nots. Even though he&#39;s best known as an actor, he&#39;s recorded multiple albums over the years and has seen success in the music industry. The Masked Singer is not his first reality show, as he landed in eighth place with pro dancer Emma Slater during Dancing With The Stars season 27.

The Masked Singer panelists were moved by John&#39;s story. He was very open with his emotions while talking about his late wife and really connected to the lyrics while performing, which probably had a big impact on his ability to keep advancing in the competition and making it all the way to the Final 2. Once the finale is over, it should be a time of celebration, not just for the winner but also for everyone involved. Regardless of what happens with the Secret Service investigation, it&#39;s really unfortunate that John&#39;s dangerous social media post has overshadowed Ne-Yo&#39;s well-deserved win. Hopefully, The Masked Singer season 11 is able to shy away from any controversy.
