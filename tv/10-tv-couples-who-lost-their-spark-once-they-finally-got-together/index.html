  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>When a television couple finally gets together, it can either be the best part of the series or ruin it if the relationship becomes uninteresting.
After a couple gets together, there are plenty of interesting parts of their committed relationship that can be explored for drama and keep the audience engaged.
However, for the audience to continue rooting for the couple, there needs to be a reason to stay invested in their relationship and their individual growth.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>A good deal of the interest around a TV couple is if they&rsquo;re ever going to get together, but sometimes that&rsquo;s when their chemistry falls apart.</p>
<p>When a television couple finally admits their feelings for each other, it can be the best part of the series, but if the show doesn&rsquo;t have plans to keep their relationship interesting, it can ruin the series. Once the drama of miscommunications and hidden emotions is finally resolved, there is little else to do except to have the couple live happily ever after or come up with convoluted ways to get them apart again. A romantic pair might have excellent tension and intrigue in the will-they-won&rsquo;t-they stage of the relationship, but their chemistry disappears when it&rsquo;s time to make a bigger commitment.
There are plenty of interesting parts of a committed relationship that can be mined for drama and keep a couple engaging for the audience. After a couple&rsquo;s story arc is wrapped up, it can also be a great opportunity for a series to explore secondary relationships and other parts of the story that are just as compelling as a romantic angle. However, for any of this to work, there has to be some reason to keep rooting for the couple.</p>
<p>10 Worst TV Couples That Should Never Have Happened
These TV couples range from having no chemistry or being outright toxic. Whatever the reason, these characters should not have been together.</p>
<p>10  Booth &amp; Brennan - Bones (2005 - 2017)
Get together season 6</p>
<p>Bones</p>
<p>Release Date   September 13, 2005    Cast   Emily Deschanel , T.J. Thyne , Michaela Conlin , John Francis Daley , David Boreanaz , Tamara Taylor    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   12    Story By   Hart Hanson    Writers   Hart Hanson    Network   FOX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney+    Directors   David Boreanaz    Showrunner   Hart Hanson</p>
<p>In season 1, though their chemistry is amazing, Agent Booth (David Boreanaz) and Dr. Brennan (Emily Deschanel) have nothing in common and find it difficult to agree on anything. Their constant combativeness and refusal to compromise on their values are what makes them so fun to watch, and creates a relationship dynamic based on friction. As the seasons progress, they start to acknowledge this chemistry and the feelings that develop.
However, they also begin to mellow in the parts of their personalities that kept them at odds. Once they&rsquo;re together, they frequently make compromises and concessions towards the other&rsquo;s point of view. While this makes for a successful relationship, it doesn&rsquo;t make for good TV. The individuals that the show started with are gone, and Booth and Brennan end up blending into practically one person.</p>
<p>9  Oliver &amp; Felicity - Arrow (2012 - 2020)
Get together season 3</p>
<p>Arrow</p>
<p>Release Date   January 10, 2013    Cast   colin donnell , Paul Blackthorne , Willa Holland , Susanna Thompson , Katie Cassidy , David Ramsey , Stephen Amell    Genres   Superhero , Drama , Action , Mystery , Crime    Seasons   8    Story By   Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg    Writers   Greg Berlanti , Marc Guggenheim , Andrew Kreisberg    Network   The CW    Franchise(s)   Arrowverse    Directors   Andrew Kreisberg , Greg Berlanti    Showrunner   Andrew Kreisberg</p>
<p>In many ways, Oliver&rsquo;s dedication to being a vigilante is the real love of his life, not Felicity.</p>
<p>Oliver (Stephen Amell) tells Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) he loves her at the end of season 2, and the couple starts dating in season 3. While Felicity was a great character and brought out the best in Oliver, the little chemistry they had started to die as soon as they made things official. Though the show had good reasons for Oliver ending up with Felicity instead of Laurel in Arrow, the way their story was drawn out and full of forced complications made it difficult to keep rooting for them. In many ways, Oliver&rsquo;s dedication to being a vigilante is the real love of his life, not Felicity.</p>
<p>8  House &amp; Cuddy - House (2004 - 2012)
Get together season 6</p>
<p>House is too selfish to truly commit to someone, and Cuddy is too enabling to his toxic behavior.</p>
<p>Few would argue that the relationship between House (Hugh Laurie) and Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) was a good idea. Despite their significant tension, the pair were never meant to be together, as House is too selfish to truly commit to someone, and Cuddy is too enabling to his toxic behavior. When the show started to hint at a potential romance between the pair, it strayed away from the initial premise and message of the show, and the hospital became a backdrop for the characters as they played their emotional chess match. Once they did get together, the professional intrigue they had disappeared, and all that was left was pain.</p>
<p>7  Jess &amp; Nick - New Girl (2011 - 2018)
Get together season 2</p>
<p>New Girl</p>
<p>Release Date   September 20, 2011    Cast   Zooey Deschanel , Max Greenfield , Hannah Simone , Damon Wayans Jr. , Lamorne Morris , Jake Johnson    Genres   Comedy    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   7    Distributor   20th Television    Writers   Elizabeth Meriwether    Network   FOX    Showrunner   Elizabeth Meriwether</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the amazing potential that Nick (Jake Johnson) and Jess (Zooey Deschanel) had as a couple was squandered by getting them together too early. The first kiss that they share is an iconic moment for the show, but if the show had waited just a little longer, it could have had a better payoff. Season 3 is dedicated to their lives as a couple, but none of the stakes are as good or compelling once they&rsquo;re together. Having nowhere else to go, the show breaks them up, even though it&rsquo;s obvious they&rsquo;ll just get back together eventually.</p>
<p>New Girl: Why Nick &amp; Jess Getting Together Was A Mistake
The relationship between Nick and Jess became the center of New Girl, but pairing them up was a mistake, for both the characters and the show.</p>
<p>6  Lorelai &amp; Christopher - Gilmore Girls (2000 - 2007)
Get together season 7</p>
<p>Gilmore Girls</p>
<p>Release Date   October 5, 2000    Cast   Lauren Graham , Scott Patterson , Sean Gunn , Keiko Agena , Matt Czuchry , Alexis Bledel , Yanic Truesdale , Kelly Bishop , Melissa McCarthy , Edward Herrmann , Liza Weil , Jared Padalecki , Milo Ventimiglia    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   7    Story By   amy sherman-palladino    Writers   Amy Sherman-Palladino    Network   The WB    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix</p>
<p>Though it was Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Luke (Scott Patterson) who were the central couple to root for, Lorelai and Christopher (David Sutcliffe) did have their moments. There were several times when it looked like Rory&rsquo;s (Alexis Bledel) parents were going to finally make it work, as the couple seemed irrevocably drawn to each other, and their physical chemistry was off the charts. Unfortunately, in season 7, when they spontaneously get married, it&rsquo;s the nail in the coffin for any hope that they were meant to be together. Lorelai simply does not love Christopher as much as she should, and they&rsquo;ve outgrown the childish fun they once had together.</p>
<p>5  Joey &amp; Dawson - Dawson’s Creek (1998 - 2003)
Get together season 2</p>
<p>Dawson&rsquo;s Creek</p>
<p>Release Date   1998-00-00    Cast   james van der beek , Katie Holmes , Michelle Williams , Joshua Jackson , Mary-Margaret Humes , John Wesley Shipp , Mary Beth Peil , Kerr Smith , Busy Philipps    Genres   Drama    Seasons   6    Story By   greg berlanti    Writers   Kevin Williamson , Greg Berlanti , tom kapinos    Network   The WB    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , HBO Max , Prime Video , Apple TV+    Directors   Greg Berlanti</p>
<p>The relationship quickly fizzles out as Joey realizes the idea of Dawson is much better than the reality of him.</p>
<p>Best friends since childhood, Joey (Katie Holmes) and Dawson (James Van Der Beek) owe it to themselves to give their relationship a shot and see if they can be more than friends. As sweet as these intentions are, once they&rsquo;re together, they&rsquo;re hardly the most compelling couple on the show. The relationship quickly fizzles out as Joey realizes the idea of Dawson is much better than the reality of him. Although they circle each other in the years after this, the best relationship in the show is between Joey and Pacey (Joshua Jackson).</p>
<p>4  Jane &amp; Rafael - Jane The Virgin (2014 - 2019)
Get together season 5</p>
<p>Jane the Virgin</p>
<p>Release Date   October 13, 2014    Cast   Gina Rodriguez , Andrea Navedo , Justin Baldoni , Ivonne Coll , Brett Dier , Jaime Camil    Genres   Comedy , Satire    Seasons   5    Story By   Jennie Snyder Urman    Writers   Jennie Snyder Urman    Network   The CW    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , Apple TV+    Directors   Melanie Mayron    Showrunner   Jennie Snyder Urman</p>
<p>In Jane the Virgin, it took Michael (Brett Dier) dying to get Jane (Gina Rodriguez) and Rafael (Justin Baldoni) together, and even then their love story didn&rsquo;t feel like the happy ending that Jane deserved. It&rsquo;s true that they had a son together, and had tried to make it work in the past, but Jane initially chose Michael. It was for a good reason, as she and Rafael worked much better as co-parents than as a couple.
They had extremely different outlooks on life and values, which caused frequent friction in the decisions about how to raise their son. If the decision to kill Michael off hadn&rsquo;t been made, even though he came back later, it&rsquo;s unlikely that Jane and Rafael would&rsquo;ve tried to make it work. When they get together and decide to get married in the final season, it feels like the decision was made just so that Jane would end the show as a married woman.</p>
<p>3  Ross &amp; Rachel - Friends (1994 - 2004)
Get together season 2</p>
<p>Friends</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 1994    Cast   Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Sitcom    Seasons   10    Story By   Marta Kauffman    Writers   David Crane , Marta Kauffman    Network   NBC    Directors   David Crane , Marta Kauffman    Showrunner   Marta Kauffman    Where To Watch   Max</p>
<p>Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) are a classic will-they-won&rsquo;t-they couple in the sitcom universe, and seeing them get together was initially a gratifying moment. However, as soon as they start dating, Ross&rsquo; incessant jealousy and insecurities make it impossible for the relationship to blossom and lead to the ultimate downfall of the couple. Though not the fault of their chemistry, the show kept throwing obstacles in their way to keep them apart and keep the tension alive until the last second of the series. This made the question of whether they&rsquo;ll end up together more annoying than intriguing.</p>
<p>2  Clark &amp; Lana - Smallville (2001 - 2011)
Get together season 7</p>
<p>Smallville</p>
<p>Release Date   October 16, 2001    Cast   Sam Jones III , Annette O&rsquo;Toole , Jensen Ackles , Eric Johnson , Erica Durance , Cassidy Freeman , Michael Rosenbaum , Laura Vandervoort , John Schneider , Kristin Kreuk , Sam Witwer , Aaron Ashmore , Allison Mack , John Glover , Justin Hartley , Tom Welling , Callum Blue    Genres   Romance , Adventure , Drama    Rating   TV-PG    Seasons   10    Distributor   Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution</p>
<p>Clark&rsquo;s (Tom Welling) secret identity is a frequent roadblock to happiness for him and Lana (Kristin Kreuk), but once they do get together, it isn&rsquo;t what was expected. After so many years of dancing around the possibility that their friendship could be more, when they have the chance to explore their relationship, they&rsquo;re too different from the young people that once fell in love. Additionally, Lex Luther&rsquo;s (Michael Rosenbaum) frequent meddling and sabotage of both their lives makes it difficult and dangerous to build something that lasts.</p>
<p>1  Sookie &amp; Eric - True Blood (2008 - 2014)
Get together season 4</p>
<p>true blood</p>
<p>Release Date   September 7, 2008    Cast   Ryan Kwanten , Kristin Bauer van Straten , Sam Trammell , Alexander Skarsgard , Stephen Moyer , Rutina Wesley , Anna Paquin , Chris Bauer    Genres   Drama , Supernatural , Horror , Romance , Thriller , Fantasy    Seasons   7    Story By   Raelle tucker    Writers   Raelle Tucker , charlaine harris , Brian Buckner , Alan Ball , Alexander Woo    Network   HBO Max    Streaming Service(s)   HBO Max , Hulu , Prime Video    Directors   Daniel Minahan    Showrunner   Alan Ball</p>
<p>Sookie (Anna Paquin) and Eric (Alexander Skarsgård) have a fraught but electric relationship in the first few seasons of True Blood, but this doesn&rsquo;t hold out into the later seasons. They share their first kiss in season 3, but it&rsquo;s not until season 4 that they truly act on their feelings, and admit them. However, Sookie continues to be skeptical of Eric and the vampire world at large, making their relationship slow-going. Even though Eric proves himself and his love for her, part of his intrigue is that he is the bad boy, and once he changes himself for Sookie, their chemistry diminishes.</p>
