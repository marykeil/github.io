Summary

  Fantasy High Junior Year returns with the Bad Kids in the midst of a thrilling battle with the Night Yorb, surprising fans.   The new season allows the characters to evolve and explore new aspects of themselves, especially as they navigate high school and their future.   Viewers can expect to see more of Aguefort Adventuring Academy and the challenges of finding a work-life balance while on epic quests.  





Dimension 20 once again returns to Spyre to continue the adventures of the Bad Kids as they try to navigate being teenage heroes. Fantasy High was the season that kicked off the Dimension 20 series, and now they are finally returning to show what happened after the massive cliffhanger set up at the end of Sophomore Year. Fantasy High balances the classic fantasy adventures that Dungeons &amp; Drgaons is famous for with the drama and comedy of high school.




Fantasy High Junior Year features the main cast of Dimension 20, known as the Intrepid Heroes: Ally Beardsley, Brian &#34;Murph&#34; Murphy, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Siobhan Thompson, and Zac Oyama, reprising their roles as Kristen Applebees, Riz Gukgak, Fig Faeth, Fabian Seacaster, Adaine Abernant, and Gorgug Thistlespring, with Brennan Lee Mulligan as the Dungeon Master. Fantasy High has been built out as the most extensive corner of Dimension 20 now, with three seasons, more than any other arc, and two spin-offs. The new season opened in the midst of the Bad Kids&#39; final battle with the Night Yorb, shocking fans, many of whom expected the season to follow the Night Yorb quest.

Screen Rant interviewed Siobhan Thompson about the new season of Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year. She explained that the surprise beginning had been planned for a long time and how it allowed them to approach their characters in an exciting new way. Thompson also teased how this season will explore Aguefort Adventuring Academy more than ever before, Adaine&#39;s relationship with her sister Aelwyn, and the struggles Adaine will face this season.





 Siobhan Thompson Talks Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year 
         

Screen Rant: We are back in Spyre, but not where I expected to pick up at all. We&#39;re in the final stretch of the Night Yorb Quest. Did you guys expect that to happen, or was that a surprise to you going in that the majority of that quest happened between seasons?


Siobhan Thompson: No, that was something that we had discussed. That was the first thing that we had discussed immediately after Sophomore Year. That was always the idea. The problem that took us a while was, &#34;Okay, but what happens after that? What do we do next?&#34; And that&#39;s part of why it took so long.
And Brennan&#39;s been wanting to start a season in medias res for a while, which we kind of did with Starstruck a little bit, but that was such a little goober moment, but this one really, we wanted to go full out and have full characters that we&#39;d never met that we brought along on this quest and really play it as if there was a hidden missing six-episode arc that you never got to see that maybe will be released as a short story. It never will. Somebody will write it in archive of our own and it&#39;ll be beautiful.





You&#39;re like, &#34;Let me clarify really quick.&#34;


Siobhan Thompson: Yes. To be clear, we&#39;re not doing that. That seems like really hard work, but I&#39;m sure some fan will make an absolutely stunningly beautiful version of it that will make everybody cry.


Well, I hope so. Can you talk to me a little bit about how you guys figured out what your characters have been through on this arc because they all feel very different from when we saw them at the end of Sophomore Year?


Siobhan Thompson: Yeah, I think that part of the nice thing about having that skip quest is that we could move our characters along a little bit further outside of the public eye. And that, for us then, as actors and improvisers, meant that we could go into it with, &#34;Well, these are the old characters, but also there&#39;s something a little bit new to work with here. We don&#39;t have to see all of the legwork of that.&#34; And I don&#39;t know, I think that we&#39;re all very anxious to always be doing something new, whether that&#39;s characters that we&#39;ve explored before or doing a completely new season.
And the novelty of it, I think, is what makes it so fun at the table. And I think that also at this age, they&#39;re 16-year-old kids. You do change so much every six months, and you can change so much every six months. And you can have that like, &#34;Oh, you thought I was prep. I&#39;m an emo now and it&#39;s completely a different thing and you don&#39;t understand me and you didn&#39;t understand me before and you don&#39;t understand me now. And it&#39;s all very serious and very real.&#34; And then in six months, you&#39;re doing something completely different and you&#39;re doing a play and suddenly, you&#39;re only wearing black.
It&#39;s the time in your life where I feel you&#39;re experimenting the most and changing yourself the most and trying on so many different hats because you&#39;re like, &#34;Adulthood is coming, and I have to decide which one of these I want to be as quickly as possible.&#34; Does that answer your question?





Yes.


Siobhan Thompson: Does that rambling stuff answer what you were asking?


Yes, for sure. And then I have to ask what inspired the new animals like Moggy the Doggy.


Siobhan Thompson: Mostly it was the spell. I leveled up and I got that spell and I was like, &#34;I can have a dog? I want a dog. I want a round dog that fits in with my round animal aesthetic that I seem to be building.&#34; I feel I should, every time I pick spells, pick the ones that are going to be the most useful and I end up just going with the ones that are most fun. I&#39;ve gotten better at it. There are definitely spells that I have this season that are rad as hell, but Moggy the Doggy, and it&#39;s a really good spell, by the way. It&#39;s really good, but was mostly because wouldn&#39;t it be fun to have a little dog? Let me make Rick Perry make me a tiny dog Mini, I want to see it.


I love that when you immediately introduce them as Moggy the Doggy, I&#39;m like, &#34;That was the right choice. No matter what, that was the right choice.&#34; And then can you talk to me a little bit about what you&#39;re excited to explore with Adaine this season that you maybe haven&#39;t in the previous two seasons?





Siobhan Thompson: Yeah. Adaine&#39;s had so many big life things. This is the first time that Adaine actually gets to go to school and actually take it seriously and explore who she is outside of her anxiety, outside of her stuff with her parents. It&#39;s her first taste of stability. And I think for people who come from very unstable childhoods, finding their first stability can be the most destabilizing thing because they&#39;re so used to the chaos that the monotony of everyday life can be very confusing. That aspect of what do you do when you solved all your problems, but you still have to continue on with your life was my sort of entry point to Adaine this season.


I&#39;m very excited to see that play out. Will we see her relationship with her sister evolve a little bit this season?


Siobhan Thompson: Yeah, there&#39;s definitely some stuff with Aelwyn who is going through her own similar, &#34;Well, I guess I&#39;m not a villain anymore. I guess I got to get a job. It&#39;s a bit boring though, isn&#39;t it?&#34; And those sisters coming together and trying to figure that out together without these parents who were just giving them the worst model of how to be a human or an elf, a person, possible. So yeah, there&#39;s definitely some sweet Aelwyn-Adaine moments this season.





          

I&#39;m very excited about that. And then, obviously, you can&#39;t say too much. Can you tease a little bit of maybe the quest we&#39;re going to see after the Night Yorb because it sounds like we&#39;re going to be in Aguefort a little more this season than we were in Sophomore Year?


Siobhan Thompson: Yes. We&#39;re definitely going to be in Aguefort a lot more. We&#39;re going to see inside the classrooms for the first time. We&#39;re going to go to class with people and see what&#39;s happening there. It&#39;s The
bad Kids starting to suddenly have to take their future a little bit more seriously. They&#39;re in that stage of school where they&#39;re like, &#34;Do I go to college? Do I get a job? What am I going to do after this? What&#39;s my path? We kind of coasted the last two years because it was pretty easy, but now suddenly school is really hard and the world is still not fixed, and we&#39;ve still got these quests to do.&#34;
So it&#39;s a lot about finding work-life balance in this, which I think is very apropos of this stage in life of, again, you&#39;re trying on all of these hats. Sometimes you realize all of a sudden, &#34;Oh, I don&#39;t have time. I&#39;m so tired. I&#39;m so burned out. And I want to do the play and do sport at the same time, but this is killing me. I&#39;m going to die.&#34; And then you&#39;re inevitably going to disappoint people. So it feels more intimate, I think, it feels smaller, but at the same time, more relatable.
And we&#39;re still going on big quests to save various exciting things that I don&#39;t want to tell you anything about. But The Bad Kids are still gonna Bad Kid. We&#39;re still going to be running around doing adventures when we really should be doing our homework. But yeah, it&#39;s much more school-focused than it has been in the past.





I&#39;m very excited to play that out, but I have to circle back to something you said in that answer. You just described fighting a dragon and the Nightmare King as coasting.


Siobhan Thompson: Well, yeah, sure. But we had the time to fight a dragon and destroy the Nightmare King because we were doing well in school anyway, so it was fine. So you have the time to do these extracurriculars of taking down two semi-immortal beings, but when suddenly college recruiters are coming around and you&#39;re starting to think about, &#34;Oh, how do I get a scholarship? I&#39;ve been really getting those Bs because that&#39;s pretty easy. What do I have to do to pay my way through this next few years of schooling and start to actually think about what things cost?&#34; And those things are boring, but very real. And they&#39;re right at that age when you start to suddenly figure that out of like, &#34;Oh, life is expensive, I guess.&#34;


Oh yeah, I remember that.


Siobhan Thompson: Yeah.





That was not fun.


Siobhan Thompson: It&#39;s not fun. It continues to not be fun.


We live in LA. It&#39;s never going to be fun.


Siobhan Thompson: Oh, my God, it&#39;s so expensive here. It&#39;s so wild. It&#39;s so wild how expensive LA is. And look, I don&#39;t want to live like a tiny little monk in a tiny little cave. I did that in my 20s and it&#39;s sad, but you got to pay for that. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s expensive.


I&#39;m going to shift away from our existential dread for a second.


Siobhan Thompson: Please do.


So, how do you think you&#39;ve evolved from the first season, both as a player and an improv actor to now playing Adaine? And how does that change your approach to the character?


Siobhan Thompson: Definitely, we&#39;ve all gotten better at the game. Most of us had played very little 5e and Ally had never played D&amp;D before. So just in terms of that stuff, we&#39;re just all much better at it. I don&#39;t have to read every spell card for the first time when I&#39;m sitting at the table. I read them before because I picked them, but it feels like you&#39;re reading it for the first time because you&#39;re like, &#34;Well, three weeks ago, I picked those spells. What did I do? Mage hand, what does this do?&#34; And I know what advantage and disadvantage is now.





Helpful.


Siobhan Thompson: Helpful. Very helpful. And then in terms of the sort of improv side of it, I don&#39;t know, I think the biggest part of it is that we all know each other so well now that we&#39;re able to shorthand a lot of stuff. And I think the fun at the table has become, &#34;How do I surprise these six people that I know so well, that they know me so well?&#34; And then by proxy, the audience, who I feel know us maybe better than we know ourselves. Because if we can keep on surprising ourselves, that&#39;s how we keep it fun, and that&#39;s how we keep it fresh. So I think that was, improv-wise, a big aim of mine this season and all of us of, &#34;How can I make these idiots laugh?&#34;


I love it. Especially because everyone had a very satisfying resolution at the end of Sophomore Year. So that we pick up and have to not only bring a new arc to it but also explain why it&#39;s important. I think it&#39;s an impressive feat you guys are going to be doing with 20 episodes.





Siobhan Thompson: Yeah, the nice thing is I feel so confident and I trust the cast. I feel so confident in our cast and I trust everybody so much that I feel we could go in with absolutely no idea and it would still be good, which we did not with this season. There&#39;s big ideas and there&#39;s incredible sets. The sets this season are so gorgeous and so fun. But the nice thing is, I don&#39;t know, I just feel very lucky to play with these people because I know that they have my back and I have theirs and there&#39;s no duds, unless I&#39;m the dud. Oh my God, am I?


          

You&#39;re not. And then, very quickly, before we wrap up, is there a character&#39;s arc other than your own that stands out to you this season without spoiling anything?


Siobhan Thompson: It&#39;s Kristen&#39;s arc. It&#39;s Kristen&#39;s arc this season for me.





Awesome.


Siobhan Thompson: We do some really dumb stuff this season. It&#39;s really fun. It was really fun to do. Some really silly things happen.


That&#39;s why I love Fantasy High. I don&#39;t go to Fantasy High to see the characters make the best decisions.


Siobhan Thompson: They&#39;re idiot children who make big, bold, bad decisions very confidently.


Which is what we want from The Bad Kids.


Siobhan Thompson: Yes, that&#39;s what 15-year-olds do and that&#39;s what they should do and that&#39;s what they will continue to do. And anybody who is ever shocked that this new generation of teenagers is acting recklessly either was really boring as a teenager or doesn&#39;t remember what they were like or maybe both because teenagers are idiots. And that&#39;s what I love about them. It&#39;s delightful.


I can&#39;t wait for the rest of the season. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me today, Siobhan.


Siobhan Thompson: Thank you. It&#39;s always fun.





I love talking to you guys. I knew this season was going to be great, and it is immediately out the bat.


Siobhan Thompson: Hell, yeah. It&#39;s good to hear because I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t seen it. I just was there. I don&#39;t remember.


That&#39;s fair. You guys filmed these a long time ago.


Siobhan Thompson: We do. And then it just happens and then you&#39;re just in your adrenaline rush and then you step away and go, &#34;What did I just say? I have no idea. Was it good? What did you talk about yesterday? I have no idea. Let me look at my notes. Oh, I didn&#39;t take any-&#34;
