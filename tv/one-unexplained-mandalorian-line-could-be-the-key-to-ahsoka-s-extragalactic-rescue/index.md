## Literature Review
One small detail from The Mandalorian season 2 could the be thing needed to rescue Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren from Peridea in Ahsoka season 2.




Ahsoka saw the return of Jedi Ezra Bridger from a different galaxy, but Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren were left stranded on Peridea - and one line from The Mandalorian may be the way to rescue the pair. Ahsoka season 1 followed Ahsoka Tano&#39;s pursuit of Lady Morgan Elsbeth, along with Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati, to a different galaxy, where they hoped to find the exiled Grand Admiral Thrawn. Morgan, Baylan, Shin, and Sabine were able to travel to Peridea and this other galaxy via the Eye of Sion, a massive hyperspace ring. However, Ahsoka and the droid Huyang travel to the other galaxy via Star Wars’ hyperspace whales, also called purrgil.




Sabine Wren is able to quickly find Ezra Bridger while on Peridea and while their reunion is short-lived, Ezra is able to secretly board Grand Admiral Thrawn’s star destroyer, the Chimaera, and get back to the main Star Wars galaxy. It’s currently unknown what direction Ahsoka season 2, which still awaits confirmation, will take, and whether Ahsoka and Sabine will try to make it home or if the season will be focusing on characters like Hera Syndulla and Ezra Bridger trying to find a way to bring the pair home. However, a small detail from The Mandalorian season 2 may be cluing audiences into how Ezra and his allies can relocate Peridea.

 Bo-Katan Kryze Keeps Tabs On Ahsoka Tano 
         




Bo-Katan Kryze worked closely with Ahsoka Tano at the tail end of the Clone Wars, when Ahsoka aided the Mandalorians in retaking their homeworld from Darth Maul in the Siege of Mandalore. The two haven’t been seen onscreen together since Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 7, but it seems the two either catch up regularly, or that Bo-Katan keeps tabs on her friend. In The Mandalorian season 2, episode 3, Bo-Katan reveals to Din Djarin where Ahsoka Tano can be found, eventually leading to Din Djarin and Grogu meeting Ahsoka in The Mandalorian season 2, episode 5.

While Bo-Katan instructs Din Djarin to tell Ahsoka that she sent them, it’s unclear how long Ahsoka had been on the planet of Corvus, and how or when she told Bo-Katan she would be there. It’s possible that Ahsoka keeps in touch with Mandalorians like Bo-Katan, especially following the destruction of Mandalore in the Night of a Thousand Tears that killed the family of her former Padawan Sabine Wren. Ahsoka may have even been a vital ally to Bo-Katan and her allies in her hunt for Moff Gideon and the Darksaber.






Ahsoka Tano stopped training Sabine Wren after the Night of a Thousand Tears because she feared Sabine was training for the wrong reasons. The pair would reunite and resume Sabine&#39;s training in Ahsoka.






 Bo-Katan Could Have A Signal On Ahsoka &amp; Peridea 
          

It’s also possible that Bo-Katan didn’t keep in touch with Ahsoka, but rather was able to tell Din Djarin where she was because she had a signal of some kind on Ahsoka and her ship. It could be a tracker or some kind of channel the two old friends keep open to let the other know of their location. Either way, it’s very possible that someone like Bo-Katan who had many resources while ruling Mandalore would be able to establish a signal to let her know where her Jedi friend was.

This also may be the reason why Ahsoka did not know about Din Djarin&#39;s and Grogu’s arrival on Corvus. Bo-Katan may not have been able to communicate to Ahsoka that they were coming, which is why she had instructed Din Djarin to tell Ahsoka that she had sent them. It was revealed in Ahsoka that Ahsoka and Sabine Wren weren’t present when Mandalore was destroyed, and it’s unclear if Bo-Katan feels the two Jedi could’ve helped her people. Sabine did feel they could have saved some people, but it’s not known if Bo-Katan feels the same and therefore resents Ahsoka, and only keeps her signal for emergencies.






 Ezra &amp; The Mandalorians May Work Together To Rescue Ahsoka 
          

Ezra Bridger has worked with Bo-Katan Kryze before, most notably in Star Wars Rebels season 4, where he helped the Mandalorians fight Imperials. Sabine Wren also gave Bo-Katan the Darksaber, and she might be willing to help Ezra go on a mission to rescue their mutual friends. If Bo-Katan has a signal to Ahsoka, then Ezra and his allies can try to go back to Peridea to find Sabine and Ahsoka and hopefully bring them home. It’s possible they could craft a ship capable of intergalactic travel with the aid of the New Republic, perhaps even with a mechanic as handy as Tatooine&#39;s Peli Motto. Hopefully, something like this comes to fruition in Ahsoka season 2, or in the future of Star Wars.
