## Literature Review
Chantel Everett is back for 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life season 4. The newly divorced star has much to offer and might be the star this season.




90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life season 4 is here with old faces and new cast members, but Chantel Everett&#39;s the breakout star this season. Chantel&#39;s one of the celebs who&#39;s been gracing screens since her 90 Day Fiancé season 4 introduction with her then-partner, Pedro Jimeno. The two became one of the most dramatic couples on the show until their divorce over a year ago. Now that Chantel isn&#39;t married, she&#39;s returned to the dating scene. Once again, she&#39;s looking for love internationally.
When Chantel and Pedro first came on the show, the couple had a serious language barrier and cultural differences. They had so many problems that Chantel&#39;s mom was convinced Pedro was out to scam her daughter. Nonetheless, their love for one another grew, which led to their spin-off series, The Family Chantel, which documented the couple&#39;s long, tumultuous marriage and some aspects of their breakup. Chantel isn&#39;t letting her recent split stop her from finding her soulmate, making her the one to watch on 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life season 4.

 8  Chantel Is Single And Ready To Mingle 
Chantel Kissed A Guy On Vacation


Since announcing her breakup with Pedro, Chantel has had some famous people in her DMs, trying to get her attention. After rumors surfaced online that Canadian rapper Drake DMed Chantel, the Southern beauty quickly claimed that she was not emotionally available enough to be receptive to anyone. Now, Chantel seems to be ready to see what the world has to offer. She&#39;s branching out in the new season, and the audience is ready to see if she will make a better choice when she picks another partner.
However, based on what has aired, Chantel seems to be going a little overboard with how she&#39;s approaching dating life. In the trailer, Chantel stated that her life was shattered, and she did not want to make the same mistakes again. After arriving in Greece (a trip her friends coined a &#34;divorce support party&#34;), she made out with a guy on a motorbike. This showed how far she was willing to go in her search for the right guy.





 7  Chantel&#39;s Family Brings The Drama 
Chantel&#39;s Mom Karen Is Overdramatic


 







There is no better family to watch on TV than Chantel&#39;s family. Each The Family Chantel cast member brings out their authentic self, and no one has a filter. Chantel&#39;s mom, Karen Everett, is perhaps one of the most dramatic moms on TV. She has always been bossy and irritating but still fun to watch. During Chantel&#39;s marriage to Pedro, she ensured Pedro signed a prenup before their wedding. At one point, Karen even hired a private investigator to see what Pedro was up to, and accused Pedro&#39;s family of using &#34;voodoo&#34; on her family.
Karen isn&#39;t the only person who makes this family entertaining. The rest of Chantel&#39;s family members, including her brother, River Everett, are also captivating cast members. He has always taken his sister&#39;s side, something that pushed The Family Chantel fans to dislike River. Chantel&#39;s family feuded with their former in-laws throughout the seven years Pedro was married to her, and it was evident that the two families didn&#39;t like each other. It will be interesting to see how Chantel&#39;s family members will treat their next in-laws.

 6  Chantel Wants A Better Man Than Pedro Ever Was 
Chantel Wants Someone Who&#39;s Committed To Her


 







The truth is that Chantel still isn&#39;t over Pedro, which is evident in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. She touched on the fact that she messed up in her previous choice of a partner. She was determined to find a partner who wanted more than a Green Card. She thinks Pedro&#39;s a user. Chantel said she was interested in connecting with a man who &#34;always builds me up and makes me feel cherished.&#34; She also added that she was looking for someone who was committed, compassionate, prosperous, and generous. She doesn&#39;t think Pedro had any of those positive qualities. Chantel said he belittled her.





 5  Chantel&#39;s New Guy Seems Like Pedro 2.0 
Chantel Needs A Real Man


 







Chantel&#39;s new love interest in Greece indulges in risky behavior, just like Pedro used to. That&#39;s why Chantel was overwhelmed by emotions after kissing her new man. The date reminded her of her initial meet-up with Pedro. Chantel may not be choosing wisely this time, since she acted the same way with her new flame that she did when she met Pedro. The fact that she ended up in tears after her first encounter with a potential partner indicated that Chantel&#39;s Greek man has similar traits to Pedro.





 4  Chantel Hasn&#39;t Fully Healed From Her Breakup With Pedro 
Chantel Doesn&#39;t Want Another Pedro
        

Chantel hasn&#39;t fully recovered from the demise of her marriage to Pedro. After a crazy night out with friends in Greece, she admitted that she found herself picking men with the same traits. Chantel found some love interests that night, meeting up with a few potential mates, including a 20-year-old man she kissed after riding on his bike. She said, &#34;This is happening to me again. That&#39;s what Pedro did for me.&#34;





 3  Chantel Is Searching For A Romance Novel-Type Of Love In Europe 
Chantel Needs To Be Realistic
        

Chantel said she wanted a Greek God and has been going to extremes, including kissing different men, to find him. However, she struggled to find a match even after her friends told her to get at least five new numbers. Chantel was so broken from her last relationship that the vision she had in her mind now seemed too idealistic and unrealistic. The reality TV star stated that she fantasized about the &#34;beaches&#34; and the &#34;mountains&#34; in the pictures. That might have led to dreaming about the perfect man, whom she would hopefully connect with during her vacation.

Chantel Got Famous On Reality TV
       The Family Chantel Star Chantel Everett  

Although Chantel&#39;s brought a lot of drama to every show she&#39;s been on, she&#39;s an exciting person to watch on TV. Having appeared on different 90 Day Fiancé shows, including the spin-off The Family Chantel, the Atlanta native&#39;s known for her impressive dancing and singing skills. She has beauty and brains and has advocated for body positivity in an inspiring way. Chantel&#39;s fully embraced her diverse heritage. She&#39;s proud of her Dominican roots, so she&#39;s the one to watch on 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life season 4.





 1  Pedro&#39;s Family Hasn&#39;t Given Chantel A Break 
Pedro&#39;s Family Is Mean To Chantel


Pedro and his family members didn&#39;t give Chantel a break. They went to extremes to humiliate and attack her. Recently, Pedro mocked entitled women and called them &#34;Karens&#34; in a social media post, indicating that the video made his day. Pedro&#39;s former mother-in-law&#39;s name is Karen, and that post made it look like he was hitting back at Chantel&#39;s mom. Pedro&#39;s sister and mother constantly attacked Chantel and her family, and they will surely do it again now that she is on 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life season 4.
90 Day: The Single Life airs on Monday at 8 p.m. EST on TLC
