# 6 Actors Who Played Different Characters In Young Sheldon &amp; The Big Bang Theory


## SUMMARY 


 Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory feature multiple actors playing different characters, creating plot holes and inconsistencies in the shared universe. 

 Lance Barber, who plays Sheldon&#39;s dad in Young Sheldon, previously appeared in The Big Bang Theory as Leonard&#39;s high school bully, creating an odd connection between the two characters. 

 There are casting choices in both shows that result in actors playing different characters in the same universe, such as Michael Trucco and Teller, adding to the plot and narrative issues.

## Literature Review
CBS&#39; Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory supposedly exist in the same reality, but several actors play different roles in the hit sitcoms.



There are several actors who appeared in both Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory that played different characters. CBS continues to maintain that the comedies exist in the same universe despite the countless plot holes between them. At this point, there is no way that Young Sheldon can resolve all the inconsistencies that it has created over its time on the air. While some of them are inconsequential, which means that the spin-off is better off not addressing them, others are significant to the established canon of the TV franchise.
Young Sheldon&#39;s story is primarily to blame for the majority of the plot holes that it created. However, it&#39;s difficult to blame all of it on the prequel, especially since The Big Bang Theory had several storylines that make it difficult for its spin-off to follow. Simply put, the prequel cannot cater to every single revelation that Sheldon had about his childhood because many of them are either too ridiculous or detrimental to its own story. Aside from narrative issues, several plot issues between Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory stem from casting choices, resulting in some actors playing different characters in the same universe.



 6  Lance Barber - Jimmy and George Cooper 
        

Arguably the best example of Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory featuring one actor to play two different characters is Lance Barber. Playing George Cooper Sr. in Young Sheldon, Sheldon&#39;s dad is the only member of his immediate family who didn&#39;t appear in the nerd-centric sitcom because he was already gone when the events of the show started.
As if Sheldon and Mary&#39;s contradicting stories about George aren&#39;t enough narrative issues, there is also inconsistency with regard to his casting. Long before he played Sheldon&#39;s dad in Young Sheldon, Barber was actually in The Big Bang Theory, appearing in season 5 as Leonard&#39;s bully in high school, Jimmy Speckerman. Considering the fact that Sheldon has an eidetic memory, it&#39;s odd that he has never brought up the fact that his father looks very similar to his best friend&#39;s worst high school enemy.

 5  Michael Trucco - Dusty and David 
        

In Young Sheldon season 6, episode 3, &#34;Passion&#39;s Harvest and a Sheldocracy,&#34; Mary got engrossed in erotic romance novels as she distanced herself from her church. This resulted in the Cooper matriarch having naughty dreams with her made-up boyfriend, Dusty, played by Michael Trucco. Aside from the implications of this in Young Sheldon&#39;s storytelling, it also has big ramifications in terms of the overall franchise.
Viewers of The Big Bang Theory may find Mary&#39;s fictional lover familiar because he previously appeared in the nerd-centric sitcom, but he played a different character. Trucoo previously existed in the universe as Dr. David Underhill in The Big Bang Theory season 2, episode 11, &#34;The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis.&#34; He was a MacArthur Genius Grant recipient, who was dating Penny. They eventually broke up, however, after it was revealed that he was married.




 4  Teller - Pus and Larry Fowler 
        

Young Sheldon season 5 ends with a special episode that focuses on Sheldon&#39;s unexpected fear of what comes ahead in his life. Motivated by the problems caused by Georgie and Mandy&#39;s surprising pregnancy, the boy genius started having visions about it when he realized that he was entering adolescence thanks to his very first pimple. CBS takes a creative route in its storytelling by bringing the zit to life with special guests, Penn bringing Acne to life and Teller playing the voice of Pus. Fans of The Big Bang Theory would be familiar with Teller, however, since he previously played Amy&#39;s father, Larry Fowler.
Unlike most actors in this list, however, Teller&#39;s two roles in the universe cannot be considered a plot hole. In The Big Bang Theory, he actually played a proper character. However, in Young Sheldon, he was merely a figment of Sheldon&#39;s imagination. That being said, it&#39;s still curious why the socially inept genius never noticed that his father-in-law looked very familiar, considering his eidetic memory.

 3  Kaley Cuoco - Pool Water and Penny 
        

Young Sheldon has brought a few The Big Bang Theory as voice cameos, with both Howard and Amy joining adult Sheldon in its narration. That being said, Kaley Cuoco&#39;s involvement in the prequel is unique. For 12 seasons, the actor brilliantly played Penny in The Big Bang Theory, which made it easier to spot her voice. So while CBS didn&#39;t credit her voice cameo in Young Sheldon season 3, episode 10 &#34;Teenager Soup and a Little Ball of Fib.&#34;, it was easy to recognize it. She was uncredited for the role of the talking pool water in Sheldon&#39;s dreams.
As interesting as this is, Young Sheldon still needs to bring in Cuoco as Penny and Johnny Galecki as Leonard before it possibly ends in season 7. Sheldon&#39;s closest friends have been largely ignored by the prequel, which is a disservice to their relationship in The Big Bang Theory. The only way to fix that is to bring the Hofstadters to the prequel.




 2  Melissa Tang - Ms. Fenley and Mandy Chow 
        

In The Big Bang Theory, Melissa Tang played Mandy Chow. While she didn&#39;t have that big a role in the nerd-centric sitcom, her existence, and history with Sheldon&#39;s best friend almost sabotaged Leonard and Penny&#39;s marriage. Shortly after tying the knot, Leonard came clean about making out with Mandy during a drunken night. While it was already in the past, this understandably didn&#39;t sit well with his new wife, causing the newlyweds to have an intense argument in their first few days as a married couple.
Melissa Tang was brought back in Young Sheldon playing an entirely different character in Ms. Fenley, the music teacher at Medford High School. Ms. Fenley was initially intrinsic to Sheldon&#39;s high school experience. Over time, however, The Big Bang Theory prequel gradually phased out the character as Sheldon expanded his horizon.




 1  Vernee Watson - Nurse Robinson and Nurse Althea 
        

One of the oldest supporting characters in The Big Bang Theory is Vernee Watson, who played the attendant at the sperm bank in the pilot. Interestingly, she made several more appearances in the nerd-centric sitcom, and although her name was never mentioned on screen, she was credited as Nurse Althea. She then returned in Young Sheldon where she played Nurse Althea for just two episodes. Like Ms. Fenley, Watson&#39;s role in the prequel wasn&#39;t fully fleshed out. It wasn&#39;t that big of a role anyway, so it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that she just faded into obscurity.
