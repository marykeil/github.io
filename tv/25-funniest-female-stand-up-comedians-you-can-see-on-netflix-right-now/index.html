Some of the best female stand-up comedians on Netflix got their start performing in tiny coffee houses, others were hilarious actors and writers before their stand-up went big. Netflix continues to bring fresh stand-up specials to audiences with each passing year. New faces have been added to its catalog, like Nicole Byer, Ms. Pat, and London Hughes. Some of the funniest new stand-up comes from these up-and-coming performers, as well as the latest material from Netflix veterans like Ali Wong.Regardless of how they may have got their start, these hilarious female stand-up comedians have specials that comedy fans need to check out on Netflix right now.

<p>10 Netflix Comedy Specials That Will Make You Laugh Out Loud
Netflix offers a big variety of comedy specials. From Chapelle to Trevor Noah, here are the best and most hilarious stand-ups to get you laughing!</p>
<p>1  Tig Notaro
Happy To Be Here</p>
<p>Tig Notaro was a big name before Netflix signed her for a comedy special. Her album Live picked up a Best Comedy Album nomination at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards and her HBO special Tig Notero: Boyish Girl Interrupted picked up a nomination for Variety Special at the 68th Annual Emmy Awards. Notaro specialized in dark comedy for years before she ended up with a breast cancer diagnosis in 2012. Notaro said she moved on to more observational comedy after that (via Larry King Now). When it comes to Netflix, fans can catch her 2018 special Tig Notaro: Happy to Be Here, which sees her looking back at her life in a more reflective manner.</p>
<p>2  Iliza Shlesinger
Freezing Hot, Confirmed Kills, Unveiled, Elder Millennial, &amp; Hot Forever</p>
<p>Irreverent and hilarious, one of the best female stand-up comedians on Netflix is Iliza Shlesinger. Shlesinger grew up in Dallas, TX, and was the winner of NBC&rsquo;s Last Comic Standing in 2008. Since then, she has released six Netflix comedy specials, five of which are available for streaming right now. They include Freezing Hot, Confirmed Kills, Unveiled, Elder Millennial, and Hot Forever. Also available for streaming is The Iliza Schlesinger Sketch Show, a hilarious take on pop culture and social commentary through wacky characters and crazy skits.

<p>3  Katherine Ryan
In Trouble &amp; The Glitter Room</p>
<p>Katherine Ryan is a Canadian comedian living in the U.K. with her daughter and brings them into her shows on Netflix. Ryan&rsquo;s roots and her family are a frequent part of her stand-up. She makes jokes about her hometown of Sarnia, Ontario, and the fact that her daughter&rsquo;s British accent makes her sound like a &ldquo;tiny inefficient butler.&rdquo; Ryan has blown up on Netflix over the past couple of years with her stand-up specials In Trouble and The Glitter Room. She also stars in the Netflix original series The Duchess, and hosts All That Glitters.</p>
<p>4  Nicole Byer
Nicole Byer: BBW</p>
<p>Audiences might recognize Nicole Byer from her role as host of Netflix&rsquo;s Nailed It. However, comedy fans know Byer better from her appearances in the world of comedy. The comedian is a fan favorite as a guest on podcasts like Comedy Bang! Bang! and Doughboys when she isn&rsquo;t hosting her own show Why Won&rsquo;t You Date Me? Her stand-up special Nicole Byer: BBW (Big Beautiful Weirdo) came to viewers in 2021. It showcases original comedy from the entertainer, covering a breadth of subjects from her personal life to the idiosyncrasies of early lockdown of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>5  Ali Wong
Hard Knock Wife, Baby Cobra, &amp; Don Wong</p>
<p>Ali Wong&rsquo;s stand-up Netflix specials Hard Knock Wife and Baby Cobra have received critical acclaim, and she&rsquo;s easily one of the best female stand-up comedians on Netflix. Wong has become a huge name in comedy for her stand-up, acting, and writing. She has served as a writer on Fresh Off The Boat and is a main cast member of American Housewives. Wong also starred in the miniseries Beef and has voice acted in Tuca and Bertie and Big Mouth, all of which are available on Netflix.

Ms. Pat: Y&rsquo;all Wanna Hear Something Crazy?</p>

In it, Ms. Pat relays her fascinating life stories with hilarious detail and memorable bits.

<p>7  Jenny Slate
Stage Fright</p>
<p>Jenny Slate has had roles in comedy series such as Parks and Recreation and House of Lies. She has voice-acted in Zootopia and The Secret Life Of Pets and even taken on a more serious role in the movie Gifted. She has also proven to be funny with her Netflix special, Stage Fright. Slate&rsquo;s comedy special takes a unique approach that is equal parts biography and stand-up. Cutting in and out of her live performance is video footage of conversations with her family and home videos from her childhood. The editing makes this special unique and personal.</p>
<p>8  Leslie Jones
Time Machine</p>
<p>Many viewers know the comedy of Leslie Jones from her appearances on Saturday Night Live and her numerous roles in comedy movies. The comedian was on SNL for several years in the mid-2010s. Furthermore, she has appeared in comedy series like Workaholics and blockbusters like Ghostbusters and Sing. Leslie Jones now has her very own stand-up special on Netflix. Released in early 2020, Time Machine puts Jones in the spotlight as she speaks on the hilarity that comes with age and retrospection.</p>
<p>Saturday Night Live: 15 Best Female Cast Members, Ranked
Saturday Night Live has seen a number of amazingly talented female cast members that have left their mark over the years. Here are some of the best.</p>
<p>9  Tiffany Haddish
She Ready &amp; Black Mitzvah</p>
<p>Tiffany Haddish has been in the comedy game for quite some time, and she has more than one comedy special on Netflix. In her early days, she made appearances in shows such as That&rsquo;s So Raven, New Girl, and It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Haddish was the first Black female stand-up comedian to host an episode of Saturday Night Live and her book, The Last Black Unicorn, made The New York Times bestseller list. Haddish has two comedy specials, She Ready and Black Mitzvah, on Netflix. She also has a series called They Ready, where she handpicks comedians to show off their comedy chops.</p>
<p>10  London Hughes
London Hughes: To Catch A D*ck</p>
<p>London Hughes is a British comedian and devotees perhaps know her from her work on BBC&rsquo;s Laughter Shock, which came to audiences in the early 2010s. She has appeared in other British comedy shows like Newsjack, as well as hit series like Fleabag. Since late 2020, the award-winning comedian can be seen in her own special on Netflix. London Hughes: To Catch A D*ck puts the entertainer on center stage as she unpacks the ups and downs of dating, sex, and relationships. The award-winning performer puts on a memorable show.</p>
<p>11  Wanda Sykes
Not Normal And I&rsquo;m An Entertainer</p>
<p>Wanda Sykes got her first recognition in comedy as a writer on The Chris Rock Show. She has acted in roles as recently as on ABC&rsquo;s Black-ish and has appeared on the big screen, as well as proven herself a talented voice actress. Sykes was even named one of the 25 funniest people in America by Entertainment Weekly. Despite this, Sykes&rsquo;s stand-up specials, Not Normal and I&rsquo;m an Entertainer, are a bit of a hidden gem on Netflix. She tackles topics such as older age, politics, and relationships. She also performs a set on Stand Out: An LGBTQ+ Celebration.</p>
<p>12  Sarah Silverman
A Speck Of Dust</p>
<p>Sarah Silverman has become known for addressing controversial topics such as racism, sexism, and politics in her comedy and inducing shock and awe from her jokes. Her Netflix special A Speck of Dust is no exception, proving she&rsquo;s one of the best female stand-up comedians on Netflix. However, it has a bit more of a relaxed feel than the great special, Sarah Silverman&rsquo;s Jesus is Magic. It&rsquo;s a new side of Silverman that perhaps has come from maturity as a comic in the industry for quite a long time, while still holding true to her unique style.</p>
<p>13  Fortune Feimster
Sweet &amp; Salty &amp; Good Fortune</p>
<p>The North Carolina-born comic Fortune Feimster saw her television debut NBC&rsquo;s Last Comic Standing in 2010, and now with two Netflix specials under her belt, she has proven her talent on Netflix. Feimster has an impressive list of projects attached to her name, such as Chelsea Lately, The Mindy Project, and Soul. However, her two Netflix stand-up specials, Sweet &amp; Salty and Good Fortune, are her real claim to fame. Her standup usually consists of good-natured jokes about growing up in the South, her experiences in showbiz, and just general life stories about everything from coming out to getting engaged.</p>
<p>14  Leanne Morgan
I&rsquo;m Every Woman</p>
<p>Leanne Morgan recently got her own Netflix special in I&rsquo;m Every Woman. The Tennessee-born mother of three got her first stand-up special at 57 years old and is now seeing her career flourish. She had a unique start in the business, selling jewelry door to door only for her clients to begin booking her for her jokes instead. After years on the stage, her first special on YouTube drew in millions of views. Morgan&rsquo;s stand-up is highly relatable. With her iconic Tennessee drawl and harrowing tales of motherhood, Morgan will have audiences rolling on the floor.</p>
<p>15  Taylor Tomlinson
Quarter Life Crisis &amp; Look At You</p>
<p>Witty and irreverent, Taylor Tomlinson discusses all the choices she&rsquo;s made in her young adult life and her mental health journey in her two Netflix specials, Quarter Life Crisis and Look at You.

<p>20  Melissa Villaseñor

Before joining SNL, Villaseñor was a semifinalist on America&rsquo;s Got Talent and has lent her voice to shows like Family Guy, Adventure Time, and TripTank. She brings her same awkward humor to her stand-up, riffing on things like affirmations and conversations with her mother.
