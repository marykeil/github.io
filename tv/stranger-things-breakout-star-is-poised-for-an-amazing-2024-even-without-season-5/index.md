## Literature Review

Joseph Quinn was the breakout star of Stranger Things season 4, and he is poised for an amazing year in 2024 even without season 5 coming out.




Joseph Quinn was the breakout star of Stranger Things season 4, and he&#39;s poised to have an amazing year in 2024 even without the final season releasing. The actor found his breakout role in 2022 by playing Eddie Munson in Stranger Things season 4. The leader of the Hellfire Club became an integral member of the show, as Joseph Quinn&#39;s performance helped Eddie become a fan-favorite character. That made Eddie&#39;s death in Stranger Things season 4 all the more heartbreaking, especially as it left audiences with uncertainty about where and when they would see the actor again.




The overall attention that Joseph Quinn received for his Stranger Things performance brought one somewhat unsurprising result. The familiarity that audiences now had with him meant he suddenly became an actor that many other projects wanted to cast. This includes increased demand for an Eddie Munson cameo in Stranger Things season 5. While Joseph Quinn had one movie role in 2023, the fruits of his breakout role in 2022 will finally be seen this year. There is little doubt that he does not have an incredible 2024 thanks to some upcoming movies and expected announcements.


 Joseph Quinn Has Major Roles In Two Huge 2024 Movies, Gladiator 2 &amp; A Quiet Place: Day One 
         

Audiences will see much more of Joseph Quinn in 2024 thanks to his confirmed movie roles in a few major projects. He is slated to appear in Gladiator 2&#39;s cast as Emperor Caracalla and in A Quiet Place: Day One. Character details for his roles in each movie are not widely known, but the mystery does not take away from the general excitement for both projects. There are plenty of reasons to believe that Ridley Scott&#39;s Gladiator sequel and the first A Quiet Place prequel will be very successful.




While Joseph Quinn might not be the lead of either movie, his involvement in both is likely to give him two significant hits that further boost his notoriety. The first Gladiator was a Best Picture Oscar winner and made over $500 million worldwide, so expectations are understandably high for Gladiator 2. Meanwhile, the two A Quiet Place movies have made over $600 million combined. If Joseph Quinn manages to deliver scene-stealing performances akin to Stranger Things in Gladiator 2 or A Quiet Place: Day One, he will continue to rise through Hollywood.



 Joseph Quinn&#39;s Fantastic Four Casting Rumor Should Be Confirmed In 2024 
          

A huge piece of why 2024 should be great for Joseph Quinn is the expected confirmation of his Fantastic Four casting. He has consistently been the rumored frontrunner to play Johnny Storm, a.k.a. Human Torch, in Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming reboot of the Fantastic Four. There has been no confirmation of Joseph Quinn&#39;s Fantastic Four casting to this point, with only Pedro Pascal reportedly signed on. The reason why Joseph Quinn&#39;s Johnny Storm casting should be confirmed in 2024 is due to the production schedule for Fantastic Four.






The rumored Fantastic Four cast is Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm.




Filming is expected to begin this year ahead of the movie&#39;s planned 2025 release date. Marvel will have to confirm who is playing who before filming begins. An official announcement could even come at San Diego Comic-Con 2024 or D23 2024. In either case, there is no chance that all Fantastic Four characters are not officially cast in 2024. Unless something changes with his interest or availability, though, all signs point to Joseph Quinn being the choice to play the young hotshot in Marvel&#39;s First Family. Adding a major superhero role to his docket will be huge for his career.



 2024 Will Make Joseph Quinn&#39;s Possible Stranger Things Season 5 Return Even Bigger 
          




If 2024 goes as anticipated for Joseph Quinn, that will be great news for Stranger Things season 5 and his potential return. Starring in Gladiator 2 and A Quiet Place: Day One and Marvel casting Quinn in Fantastic Four will signal how bright his star will shine moving forward. Each new role will only serve as a reminder of how great he was as Eddie Munson on Stranger Things too. That will likely make audiences only more excited to potentially see him play Eddie Munson again and increase the hope that he will appear again in season 5 somehow.

Since Stranger Things season 5 is not expected to come until 2025, there is a good chance that Joseph Quinn will be a much bigger star by the time any potential return happens. There is already plenty of love for Eddie Munson, but Quinn was hardly a known name when he played him previously. The likelihood of Joseph Quinn&#39;s 2024 movies making him a bigger name will inherently make the prospect of him returning in Stranger Things season 5 even more exciting.
