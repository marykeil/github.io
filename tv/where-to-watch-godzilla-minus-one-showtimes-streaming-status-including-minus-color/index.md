## Literature Review

Godzilla Minus One is the latest movie from Toho, and there are different options to watch the movie in theaters or at home on streaming.




Godzilla Minus One is the latest Toho monster movie, and there are different options for where audiences can watch the film. Godzilla&#39;s presence on the big screen has been dominated by the Monsterverse since the franchise&#39;s creation in 2014, but Toho&#39;s legacy and the cultural significance the creature has to Japan has remained. Godzilla Minus One puts the King of the Monsters back at the forefront as an antagonistic presence terrorizing Japan after World War II. It is written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, the widely successful Japanese director and visual effects artist, making him a perfect fit for the new version of Godzilla.




The release of Godzilla Minus One breaks a seven-year gap between Toho&#39;s individual efforts to bring its monsters to the big screen, although only two years have passed since Godzilla was triumphant in Godzilla vs. Kong. While the giant kaiju has since been seen on the small screen, the new horror Godzilla movie holds no connections to the rest of the Monsterverse, making it more accessible for audiences and Godzilla fans around the world. Given the movie&#39;s very positive response, excitement has only grown to see what Godzilla Minus One delivers, leaving viewers eagerly waiting to watch it.

 When Will Godzilla Minus One Release On Streaming? 
          




Toho has yet to announce when or where Godzilla Minus One will release on streaming. The studio does not have any existing deals in place to cover the new Godzilla movie, which could mean a bidding war will happen for its streaming rights. Max could be a natural destination for Godzilla Minus One given Toho&#39;s existing relationship with Legendary and Warner Bros., but the studio has also worked with Netflix and Apple on original Monsterverse content. While this film is not connected to that franchise, history could still be a factor in determining a streaming home. Godzilla Minus One&#39;s streaming release date is dependent on it landing a deal.



 When Will Godzilla Minus One Release On Digital? 
          

For those who want to watch Godzilla Minus One at home, the film&#39;s digital release could be the best option. No release date has been announced yet, but the movie is expected to be available to buy or rent on most PVOD services eventually. It was only meant to have a limited theatrical release, but Godzilla Minus One&#39;s box office has extended its stay and delayed any digital release. In that case, a digital release will give people around the world a new and easier path to seeing Godzilla Minus One.
