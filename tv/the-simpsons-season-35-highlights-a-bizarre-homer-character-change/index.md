Summary

  Homer&#39;s characterization has changed throughout the 35 seasons of The Simpsons, going from irascible to incompetent but good-natured.   The show introduced &#34;Jerkass Homer,&#34; a self-centered version of the character that was widely disliked online.   In seasons 34 and 35, Homer is lazy and buffoonish but willing to put his family first, showing a shift towards a more moral and caring character.  







While The Simpsons has never been entirely consistent in the characterization of its hero, one major Homer change proves that the sitcom has thoroughly rewritten its main character. Homer Simpson is one of the most popular TV characters ever, but he has changed a lot throughout the 35 seasons of The Simpsons. In the early seasons of the series, Homer was less incompetent and more irascible, with the character having a shorter fuse and a more intense temper. During the show’s so-called Golden Age from seasons 3 to 9, Homer became more incompetent but also more good-natured. While he remained arrogant and self-serving, he was mostly a heroic figure.

This characterization changed again as later seasons of The Simpsons introduced &#34;Jerkass Homer.&#34; This version of the series&#39; lead was widely reviled online for his self-centered, callous attitude. While The Simpsons season 36 might bring back Jerkass Homer, season 34 mostly fixed this divisive version of the character. In seasons 34 and 35, Homer remains lazy, easily corruptible, and buffoonish, but he is willing to put his family before everything else — and he has some morals when push comes to shove. This was proven in season 35, episode 10, “Do The Wrong Thing,” which changed an early-season character trait for good reason.






The Simpsons season 35 is currently streaming on Hulu, while the other 34 seasons are available on Disney&#43;.





 Homer Isn’t Good At Fishing in The Simpsons Season 35 
          

In “Do the Wrong Thing,” Homer proved that he&#39;s a hopeless fisherman when he attempted to follow Abe’s impressive streak as a champion angler. However, in season 2, episode 20, “The War of the Simpsons,” fishing was Homer’s favorite hobby. In The Simpsons Movie, he even tried to share this passion with Bart. Season 35’s weaker Simpsons episodes have betrayed Homer and the rest of the family’s earlier characterizations, but the change featured in “Do the Wrong Thing” was a surprisingly inspired choice. By making Homer a bad fisherman, The Simpsons episode also made him a better father and husband.




Bart added weights to Homer’s fish to ensure he won, and Homer was so impressed by his son’s cheating that the pair started conning countless obscure sporting events in the weeks that followed. However, when Homer learned that all his cheating had inspired Marge to falsify Lisa’s application for a prestigious summer camp, he realized the error of his ways and denounced cheating altogether. If The Simpsons had prioritized keeping Homer’s fishing prowess consistent, the show would have missed out on exploring his willingness to give up a lucrative grift for the sake of not corrupting Marge and Lisa’s shared moral purity.



 Homer’s Bad Fishing Illustrates A Bigger Character Shift 
          

Even in the darkest episodes of The Simpsons, Homer has become less self-centered and more harmlessly incompetent as the show has progressed. In “The War of the Simpsons,” he is willing to blow off a marriage counseling retreat to go fishing. By contrast, in season 35, he quits his hobby of successfully cheating at sports so that he can be a good influence on Lisa and prove to Marge that cheaters don’t always prosper. This shift proves that Homer’s character inconsistency isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since The Simpsons season 35 can center sweeter stories rather than more cynical depictions of Homer.
