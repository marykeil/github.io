## Literature Review

The One Piece franchise has cemented its spot at the top in 2023 with a year full of achievements, and 2024 promises to be even better.




As much as the anime industry has seen great success recently, 2023 was definitely the year of One Piece. 2023 was an incredible year for anime and manga in general, and the medium has never received more attention. However, One Piece managed to stand out thanks to the first successful live-action adaptation of a manga, produced by Netflix, the anime reaching incredible new heights, and the manga story kicking into high gear for its final saga. 




The franchise had multiple projects, received a lot of new interest from non-anime viewers, and was the most financially successful franchise of 2023. According to the statistics produced by Oricon, One Piece was the best-selling media franchise in Japan in 2023.

          

However, 2024 has the potential to push One Piece to heights never seen before and become the best year for Eiichiro Oda&#39;s creation in the two-and-a-half decades that it has been running.

                  10 Best-Selling Manga of All Time   The manga industry just keeps getting bigger as time goes by, but these series currently stand at the top in terms of sales.   


 The One Piece Live Action Was The First Of Its Kind 
Produced by Tomorrow Studios &amp; Netflix

 




Anime live-action adaptations have never done well, and have a history of receiving terrible reviews from fans of the original work, as the experience of Cowboy Bebop proved. Whether it be deviations from the source material or bad casting, these adaptations failed to be successful until the One Piece live-action series proved otherwise. This Netflix-exclusive series was the first and best example of what live-action anime have the potential to be. Under the strict supervision of Eiichiro Oda, this series embodied everything the manga stood for, while brilliantly adding original elements that elevated the experience.

The main reason this series did incredibly well was the cast, who were not only talented, but also a great match for the characters they played. Their uncanny similarity with who they played and how they replicated their personalities was a shining example of how to do an anime adaptation right. The streaming giant also threw unlimited resources to make this series successful, with each episode&#39;s budget floating around $18 million. The marketing behind the release was also a major reason as to why the series became popular, showing how much Netflix was willing to invest in it.




With all the ingredients to become a hit, One Piece&#39;s live-action adaptation broke records by becoming the most-watched series in 84 countries for 3 weeks in a row, with approximately 50 million viewers at that time. This prompted the approval of a second season, and although its release date is unknown, there is enough reason for fans to celebrate. The first season covered the East Blue Saga, and the next one might focus on the fan-favorite Alabasta arc, significantly expanding on the world of One Piece.

The anime has been in the Wano arc for four and a half years, and every second of it was enjoyable. Set in a feudal Japanese-themed country, the arc featured exciting new characters, heartbreaking moments, and hyped fights. The exponential increase in the quality of animation was also part of why the Wano arc is one of the best arcs in One Piece. The storyline came to an end in 2023, and the war on Onigashima was an incredible way to end it.




With many moments that broke the internet and crashed Crunchyroll servers, the appearance of Luffy&#39;s Gear 5 was the most memorable moment of the year. Manga readers and anime-only alike were very excited for Luffy&#39;s peak form to appear, and it delivered on the extremely high expectations set for it. The absurdity of his new powers was clearly demonstrated by the over-the-top and exaggerated animation. The Wano arc was yet another excellent saga in the series, but the next installment has the potential to surpass it.

          

Set on a futuristic island where science and technology are very advanced, the Egghead arc is another wild adventure for the Straw Hats that will take them closer to the One Piece. Oda has said that this is where the story truly begins, and that fans can skip to this point, although it&#39;s not recommended.

 Netflix Announces A Complete Remake Of The Anime 
Produced by WIT Studio

 

After getting a taste of how profitable the franchise was, Netflix went all in on the series and greenlit a remake of the anime, called The One Piece, that will be handled by Studio WIT, well-known for their work on Spy X Family, Vinland Saga season 1, and Attack On Titan seasons 1-3. This internet-breaking announcement was made during 2024&#39;s Jump Festa event. There is not a lot known about this project, but it has the potential to rid the existing One Piece anime of its problems, and tell a new, exciting version of this story.

The biggest advantage that the new anime has over the original is time. There will be 20 years worth of content to adapt, and they do not have to rush or try to make sure not to keep up with the manga, as is the case for Toei Animation&#39;s anime. Whether it&#39;s a seasonal anime or otherwise, WIT can amend the pacing of the original adaptation. Additionally, the less-than-stellar animation from those initial arcs will also be improved upon, as WIT is one of the best anime studios when it comes to high production quality and animation. With the backing of the largest streaming service, One Piece could become the biggest anime ever as it prepares to dominate the global market.




                  One Piece Fans Have One Major Concern About Netflix&#39;s Anime Remake   The studio behind Netflix&#39;s new The One Piece anime has previously used AI, and some fans are worried the controversial tool will be used again.   



 The Manga Is Still Going Strong After Two Decades

The One Piece manga is nearing the conclusion of the Egghead arc, and it is safe to say that the sheer magnitude of its epic fights won&#39;t be matched by the series again for quite some time. Whether it was Luffy taking on Admiral Kizaru, Zoro battling Lucci, Garp fighting the Blackbeard Pirates on his own, Shanks humiliating Kid, or Law being destroyed by Blackbeard, the first part of the final saga was one to remember. The heartbreaking backstory of Kuma was also revealed in this arc, cementing him as one of the best father figures in anime and manga.




Oda revealed that the next arc will feature even more fights, and the biggest one will end in a massive upset. He also teased that the next adventure for the Straw Hats would take them to the island of giants known as Elbaf. The final story gets even more dramatic as the crew prepares to meet a violent and powerful race of individuals in the series, while mysterious and evil figures found within the World Government plot their next move
