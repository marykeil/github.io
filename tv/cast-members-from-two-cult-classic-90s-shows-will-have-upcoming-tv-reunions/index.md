## Literature Review
Several actors from two of the biggest shows of the 1990s will reunite very soon, celebrating a massive anniversary that’s just around the corner.




Two of the biggest shows of the 1990s, Martin and Ally McBeal, are reuniting for the Emmy Awards. Lawrence and Calista Flockhart, as the neurotic defense attorney Ally McBeal, were two of TV&#39;s biggest names in a competitive decade for American television. They&#39;ll both be spotlighted during the ceremony, which will celebrate several classics for its diamond anniversary.




According to Variety, the upcoming 75th Primetime Emmy Awards will feature reunions for the casts of Martin and Ally McBeal. Martin Lawrence, Tisha Campbell, Carl Anthony Payne II, and Tichina Arnold will be in attendance. Lawrence portrayed the titular character. Campbell played Gina, while Payne and Arnold portrayed Cole and Pam, respectively. As for Ally, Flockhart will be on stage with Greg Germann, Peter MacNicol, and Gil Bellows. Germann played Richard, while MacNicol played John. Bellows played Ally&#39;s main love interest, Billy. The ceremony will air on Monday, January 15 at 8 PM ET, live on Fox and streaming on Hulu the next day.


 Are Ally McBeal &amp; Martin Getting Rebooted? 
          

It was announced in August 2022 that Ally McBeal was getting rebooted by ABC. The project, described at the time as being in early development, would be written and executive produced by Karin Gist. The story follows a young Black woman who joins the law firm from the original series fresh out of law school. The character would be the daughter of Renée Raddick (Lisa Nicole Carson), Ally&#39;s best friend and roommate.




Flockhart was approached to reprise her role in some capacity, alongside being involved as an executive producer. Original series creator David E. Kelley, who in recent years created shows such as Big Little Lies and The Lincoln Lawyer, would not be directly involved in the new show, but it was noted that he learned of the pitch and gave it his blessing. Since the initial reports, there have been no new developments on the progress of the Ally McBeal reboot, but the cast reunion could spark a clarifying update about its status.

                  Goin&#39; for Mine: Martin&#39;s Cancelled Spinoff About Pam Explained   Martin focused primarily on the adventures of title character Martin Payne, but Tichina Arnold&#39;s Pam almost got her own spinoff called Goin&#39; for Mine.    

After reuniting for a television special and musing about where their characters would be after the Martin finale, Lawrence downplayed the possibility of a revival and said he wouldn&#39;t want to try and capture the magic of it again. Still, for viewers of the sitcom and the influential legal dramedy Ally McBeal, this year&#39;s Emmys will be one to watch.
