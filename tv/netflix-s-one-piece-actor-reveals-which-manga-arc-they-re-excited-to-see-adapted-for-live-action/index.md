## Literature Review
Netflix&#39;s One Piece star actor Emily Rudd reveals which manga arc she is most excited to see eventually adapted into the live-action show.




Emily Rudd has high hopes for how much Netflix&#39;s One Piece can adapt. A live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda&#39;s renowned ongoing manga, the Netflix version stars Rudd, Iñaki Godoy, Morgan Davies, Mackenyu, among numerous others. It is not the first on-screen depiction of Luffy&#39;s story, as it comes after the anime, which has over 1,000 episodes and still has more to adapt.




The long wait for the live-action One Piece season 2 has already begun, and the actors are as excited about continuing the show as the audience. In an Instagram Q&amp;A, Emily Rudd explained what she is most excited about in the show&#39;s future.


 

While committing to playing Nami as long as Netflix wants her to, Rudd explained that she is interested in adapting the Enies Lobby arc, which takes place during the Water 7 Saga. It is likely a plot that will need to be held off until season 4, given that it is the fourth saga in the manga&#39;s long run.


 What Is The Enies Lobby Arc? 
          




Taking place relatively early in the series for the manga and late for the Netflix show, the Enies Lobby arc is one that fundamentally changes the Straw Hat Crew. After losing a member of their crew, the yet-to-be-introduced Nico Robin, the Straw Hats launch an attack that threatens the World Government. It strengthens their connection, but it proves to every pirate crew and to the government itself that the Straw Hats are not just a simple crew of misfits.



Outside of the live-action show, Netflix is also developing a new One Piece anime adaptation, The One Piece.




The Enies Lobby arc puts the Straw Hats in direct conflict with the World Government permanently. After allying with numerous bands of pirates, Luffy leads an invasion of Judicial Island. It is a moment of growth for the entire crew, as they realize that they truly are capable of defeating anyone who crosses them. It is also a turning point that sees them leave behind the past, including their beloved ship, which finally loses its seaworthiness.




                  10 Live-Action One Piece Spinoffs That Could Actually Work   Successful shows usually lead to spinoffs, and there are surprisingly many live-action One Piece spinoff ideas that could work – especially prequels.    

Besides the tragedy of losing the Going Merry, Enies Lobby sees the Straw Hats becoming more powerful. Most of them gain new abilities, which forces the World Government to lay new and higher bounties on their heads. The vast number of changes completely redirects the future of the series. The crew has more enemies, more threats, and more power at their fingertips. It&#39;s no wonder that Rudd wants to see One Piece reach the Enies Lobby arc.
