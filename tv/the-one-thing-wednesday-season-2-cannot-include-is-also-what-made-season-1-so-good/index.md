# The One Thing Wednesday Season 2 Cannot Include Is Also What Made Season 1 So Good


## SUMMARY 



  Wednesday season 2 will focus less on romance and more on horror elements, promising a new and unique storyline for the popular Netflix series.   The show should move away from the murder mystery plot that worked so well in season 1, instead exploring the extensive Addams Family lore and universe.   While mysteries will still be core to the show, the approach to the plot elements should be new, allowing Wednesday to thrive in a different way.

## Literature Review
Netflix&#39;s Wednesday season 1 was very successful for many reasons, but season 2 needs to make a core change to its plot in order to work.




Though the plot of Wednesday season 2 is still unconfirmed, the next outing should avoid copying one element that made season 1 so successful. The Netflix series is a spinoff from the famous Addams Family franchise, following Wednesday Addams as she starts attending Gomez and Morticia&#39;s old school, Nevermore Academy. Starring Jenna Ortega as the titular character, season 1 of the supernatural drama followed Wednesday investigating a murder spree. The spinoff quickly became one of Netflix&#39;s most popular shows, breaking many records and leading to Netflix rushing to renew Wednesday for season 2.




Wednesday season 1 leaned into many different teen drama and mystery tropes, including dilemmas like love triangles. However, season 2 is about to make some much-needed changes. Ortega, who will have an executive producer role in season 2, promised there will be less romance for Wednesday in the upcoming installment, and teased that there will be more horror elements. On top of getting a new location with the Addams family&#39;s mansion, there are many ways Wednesday season 2 can develop new, unique storylines instead of relying on what made season 1 work so well.

 Wednesday Season 2 Should Not Be Just Another Murder Mystery 
There are more ways to use the famous character
         




Wednesday season 1 worked great as a murder mystery case, but season 2 shouldn&#39;t dwell on that. Wednesday is a famous character of the creepy family, and the original media about the Addams Family didn&#39;t include murder mysteries, instead focusing on the characters&#39; macabre fish-out-of-water narratives. However, while season 1 spent less time on other members of the Addams family tree, it&#39;s been teased that Wednesday season 2 will return to the Addams mansion. In past adaptations, the events in the Addams Family world have usually happened at their home, which is why Wednesday proved to be such a welcome change in pace. However, having season 2 set at the beloved mansion wouldn&#39;t work with a murder mystery.

Besides, the murder mystery case was solved by Wednesday&#39;s season 1 ending, and there is no reason for season 2 to be set in this genre, too. Though a mysterious &#34;stalker&#34; did set up a new virtual trail for her to follow in season 2, Wednesday was already sent home after Nevermore closed for the semester. With Wednesday switching filming locations from Romania to Ireland, a change of story would make sense, too. The Addams Family lore is extensive, and the showrunners could start exploring it further. Additionally, Tim Burton&#39;s passion for outcasts and gothic horror expertise mean season 2 could explore the universe&#39;s mythological side without making Wednesday an amateur homicide detective again.






 Why The Murder Mystery Plot Worked So Well For Wednesday Season 1 
          

As seen with other recent hit shows like Poker Face, A Murder at the End of the World, Only Murders in the Building, and True Detective, the genre is ripe for great television. Riverdale season 1, a teen drama show that Wednesday was often compared to at its onset, similarly excelled in the murder mystery genre, though lost steam with divisive departures in subsequent outings. Wednesday season 1 found a way to successfully incorporate murder mystery tropes with the lore, tone, and macabre familiarity of The Addams Family, introducing a compelling new formula to the franchise with sharp writing, clever twists, and Tim Burton&#39;s distinct style.

Although Wednesday moved away from the setting and premise that made The Addams Family popular and was criticized for it, Wednesday season 2 could benefit from focusing more on the supernatural and coming up with a new plot. However, this doesn&#39;t mean Wednesday season 2 has to step away from mysteries themselves, but rather being centered on a murder investigation. Mysteries have always been core to The Addams Family, such as Uncle Fester&#39;s disappearance and fate in the 1991 movie, but Wednesday season 2 could thrive on an entirely new approach to this plot element.
