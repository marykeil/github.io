## Literature Review
The Family Chantel’s Karen Everett is a protective mother, but she disrespects her kids’ boundaries and enjoys meddling in their love lives.




Karen Everett from The Family Chantel has become increasingly overbearing since she appeared on the series. She made her TV debut in 2016 and was one of the supporting cast members in 90 Day Fiancé season 4. She became known for being a great mother to Chantel Everett. At the time, Karen was well-known for her unique sense of fashion and bold personality. She assisted her daughter in settling with Pedro Jimeno but also played the role of a guardian to her kids. She hired a private investigator to ensure her son-in-law was a good person and not using her daughter.




Karen built a great relationship with Pedro over the years. She cared for him like a mother and supported him after he came to the U.S. The only thing Karen couldn’t do was build a meaningful friendship with his family. She failed to impress Pedro’s mother, Lidia Morel. She didn’t have the same views about life as her son-in-law’s family, which stopped her from getting to know them. She became a part of numerous on-screen fights and arguments over the last five seasons of The Family Chantel. Karen changed a lot as a person and has slowly transformed into a villain as well.

 Karen Everett’s Trying To Get Pedro Jimeno Deported 
Karen Thinks Pedro Is A Scammer
         




Karen has always had her suspicions about Pedro and his family. However, she truly lost it when he left her daughter and broke her heart. In The Family Chantel season 5, Karen is on a quest to get Pedro deported and isn’t looking at things objectively. She has let her emotions turn her into a completely different person, fueled by anger, contempt, and hatred. During one of the episodes, Pedro revealed how Karen is “trying to get him deported” and added that she and Chantel had already “opened a case to immigration.”

Pedro claims he has begun getting “letters from the government” already. He believes Karen and Chantel talked to immigration officials and are trying to make it seem like his seven-year “marriage was a scam.” It’s understandable that Karen is hurt about her daughter’s divorce and hates that Pedro hasn’t shown emotion. However, Karen&#39;s thirst for revenge and wanting Pedro deported shows a monstrous side to her that wasn’t there a few seasons ago. The Everett family matriarch is quickly becoming an unlikeable character, and season 5 may ruin her image.






 Karen Everett’s Always Interfering In Her Kids’ Lives 
Karen Takes Intertest In Her Kids’ Love Lives

 

Chantel isn’t the only child Karen has tried to manipulate. She also interfered a lot in her younger daughter’s and son’s lives. Previously, Winter Everett was dating Jah, who was much older than her, and even converted to his Nazarene faith. However, Karen was unhappy and tried to meddle in her daughter’s life. She was angry that Winter never told her about her engagement. Similarly, Karen wasn’t too happy when her son, River Everett, dated a young single mother, Megan. Karen could’ve applauded her kid for wanting to be a stepdad and father figure, but she didn’t.

Karen’s bitter attitude became more evident in the first few episodes of The Family Chantel’s final chapter. While her frustration at her daughter’s failed marriage is on point, her immature response is quite a bummer. Karen is rightfully angry at Pedro but has created unnecessary problems in Chantel’s divorce by meddling in her personal life. She has pushed her daughter and made her feel like they needed to take revenge. If it weren’t for Karen, Chantel could’ve had a seamless and less dramatic split from Pedro.




                  The Family Chantel Season 5 Won’t Be The Final Season (Why There Might Be Another Season?)   Season 5 seems to be the final edition of The Family Chantel. However, there are still some unresolved conflicts between the cast members.    



 Karen Everett’s Selling Off Pedro’s Belongings

Karen instigated issues between Pedro and Chantel in several ways. However, selling Pedro’s belongings was the most childish thing she had done. In The Family Chantel season 5, the mother of three stepped in and got rid of everything Pedro left behind in his house with Chantel. She claimed that selling Pedro’s belongings for a cheap price gave her “great satisfaction” and made her feel better. Karen threw everything out of the house without even informing Pedro.

Even though Pedro broke Chantel’s heart, Karen could’ve acted maturely during their divorce settlement. During a confessional, she seemed too proud to sell her son-in-law’s most loved and valuable belonging, his gaming chair. Karen got rid of Pedro’s treasured item, claiming it was a “stupid gaming chair.” Chantel’s mom appeared unnecessarily evil when she sold the chair for only $1.






 Karen Everett Accused Pedro Jimeno Of “Trying to Harvest The American Dollar” 
Karen Never Gave Pedro The Benefit Of The Doubt
         

Karen has proved that she never cared for Pedro like a real mother-in-law would. She had turned against him, just like he turned against Chantel. However, Karen’s behavior and lack of trust in Pedro go way back in The Family Chantel’s history. A few years later, she accused Pedro of trying to harvest “the American dollar.” Regardless of how things turned out, maybe Pedro would’ve stayed if Karen truly accepted him in his family. It’s hard to blame Pedro for wanting to leave the Everett family because most of them didn’t care about him.

Chantel’s mother also took a shot at Pedro in 2022. Karen posted a photo of what appeared to be the couple signing divorce papers and wrote, “dont ever allow anyone to mistreat or run rough shot over your children.” Karen could’ve proved to be a sensible woman like other supporting cast members. Unfortunately, she did the opposite by letting her emotions drive her actions. From hiring investigators to insulting him in TV confessionals, she pushed Pedro to feel unwelcome in the Everett family.








The Family Chantel airs on TLC on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.
