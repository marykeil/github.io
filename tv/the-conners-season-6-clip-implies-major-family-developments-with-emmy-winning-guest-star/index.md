## Literature Review

A new clip from The Conners season 6 hints at major family developments and potential trouble when a major guest star makes their debut appearance.




A new clip from The Conners season 6 hints at major family developments with a big guest star. Throughout its run, the Roseanne spinoff has been no special to special appearances from familiar faces. The popular ABC sitcom has featured a varied list of guests from Ferris Bueller star Matthew Broderick and SNL legend Jane Curtin to rocker Ozzy Osbourne and NFL player Aaron Rodgers.




The tradition will continue with The Conners season 6, with Emmy winner Nick Offerman guesting as a mysterious character that makes the titular family very uneasy.


 

In the clip above, (via ABC), not much is offered about Offerman&#39;s character. But the actor, who recently won an Emmy for his role in HBO&#39;s The Last of Us, in addition to being known for playing Ron Swanson on Parks and Recreation, seems to make The Conner clan very tense.



The Conners season 6 premieres Wednesday, February 7 at 8 PM ET on ABC.





 What&#39;s Going On In The New Conners Season 6 Clip? 
          




The signs of trouble begin right away. Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) looks genuinely shocked. Darlene (Sara Gilbert) says she&#39;s scared, and although that may be a bit of sarcasm, Becky (Lecy Goranson) appears sincerely nervous because of whatever is happening with Offerman&#39;s character. The strangest moment, however, occurs when the new guest questions Dan (John Goodman).

“Are you family?”, the new character asks, referring to The Conners, Dan suddenly speaks with an accent and claims not to know the people around him. Louise (Katey Sagal), his wife, watches skeptically. The episode synopsis offers more insight. Titled &#34;The Publisher Cops Show Pilot&#34;, it&#39;s teased that Jackie faces trouble at the Lunch Box and gets advice from an unexpected guest.

Returning for 13 episodes, season 6 will also see Dan and Darlene take a surprise trip to Chicago. Sean Astin will also be back in his role as Becky&#39;s love interest, Tyler. Meanwhile, in a cast change for The Conners, Jayden Rey will not return in a series regular capacity as Mary. She has been with the overall Roseanne shows since the 2018 revival, playing DJ&#39;s daughter Mary.
