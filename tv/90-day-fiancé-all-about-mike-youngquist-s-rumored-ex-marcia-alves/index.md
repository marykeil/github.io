## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Mike Youngquist allegedly dated  Marcia Alves after Natalie Mordovtseva. Were they ever together?




90 Day Fiancé star Mike Youngquist was rumored to be dating Marcia “Brazil” Alves after breaking up with Natalie Mordovtseva. Former actress Natalie left Mike a mere six months after marrying him, and she&#39;s been living in Florida since filming 90 Day: The Single Life. While Natalie has been dating other men, she doesn’t want to get divorced from Mike, who recently dropped a new bombshell. He revealed that he never filed the requisite papers for Natalie’s Green Card. It was a power move by Mike, who might not be as lonely as he claims without Natalie.




During the 90 Day: The Single Life Tell-All, Mike revealed that he&#39;d moved to Seattle, while Natalie had always wanted to get out of Sequim, aka “the wood.” When asked if he was dating anyone, Mike’s reply was that he was trying to concentrate on, “other things” in life, such as work. Natalie claimed that she found out about Mike dating through, “someone.” Meanwhile, Debbie Johnson and Tania Maduro said that there were pictures on the Internet of Mike and his possible new girlfriend. In any case, Mike said that she was just a friend that he, “hung out&#34; with, &#34;and stuff,” because he’s not, “ready to date.” Meanwhile, Big Ed Brown joked that Mike is so “low key” that he is very hard to read.

Some photos of Mike that Marcia had posted on her Instagram have since been made private. Natalie’s estranged husband first sparked rumors of a romance with Marcia when she shared a selfie of them together at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas Resort &amp; Spa. Marcia wrote in the caption, “Shenanigans in Vegas [hands up emoji],” and included the September 2021 post with hashtags, “#SweetHeart” and “#AmazingDude.” In the comments, fans seemed excited about this reality TV crossover between 90 Day Fiancé and Rock of Love with Bret Michaels. Marcia is best remembered for her appearance in the 2009 show, where she threw up and then kissed Bret, only for him to say, “It’s the best Dorito I’ve ever tasted.”

Soon enough, Marcia posted more photos with Mike. This time, they were posing in a pool, and the post also featured Marcia’s son. “Sunday funday with my favorite people,” Marcia wrote in her caption, and again complimented Mike by saying, “#SweetestGuy #BigHeart #GreatTimes” via her hashtags. In turn, Natalie wasn’t taking too well to Mike having pool time fun with Marcia. She took to Instagram stories to ask her followers, “who else is having the worst day of the year?” When a person told Natalie to “call Mike,” she replied: “He is on vacation with his new catch.” Natalie also claimed that she was, “free now to listen to any compliments.” In a different story, though, she added, “I don’t give a flying bird now!”






 Natalie&#39;s Reactions Seemed Bitter 
          

When Marcia got wind of Natalie’s bitter Instagram updates, she threw shade at the Kyiv native. “Give the person you love honesty, respect trust &amp; passion or be prepared to watch from the sidelines as someone else does it,&#34; was Marcia’s shady caption for a selfie she’d taken with a skeleton prop. The VH1 star seems to let the hashtags do the talking, as Marcia made sure she posted, “#rumors, #youknowwhoyouare #90dayfiancé.”

At one point, Marcia made her profile private. However, Marcia and Mike have broken up. In fact, Marcia alleged that she and Mike were never really in a relationship at all. Since the supposed romance between Mike and Marcia, Mike posted photos of a new mystery woman on Instagram throughout 2023. While her identity is unknown, its certain Mike is no longer with Marcia after all the 90 Day Fiancé drama with Natalie.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
