## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&#39;s Kirsten Schoemaker slams Tim Malcolm for the way he behaved with her after Julio Moya accused her of cheating.




Kirsten Schoemaker called out Tim Malcolm for his hypocrisy during the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell-All Part 2. Kirsten&#39;s boyfriend, Julio Moya, had conveniently avoided telling his family about his plans to move to the Netherlands with her. Julio broke up with Kirsten on FaceTime by telling her he wouldn&#39;t be able to come because of family commitments. During the Tell-All, Julio claimed he split with Kirsten because she was cheating on him. Julio said Kirsten addressing her male friend as &#34;Papi&#34; on their texts was a clue she had been unfaithful.




Tim, who was watching the Tell-All from the sidelines with other seasoned cast members, joined him in calling Kirsten a liar even though he was later exposed by Armando Rubio for calling Kenneth “Kenny” Niedermeier his &#34;daddy.&#34;

          

When a fan asked Kirsten if Tim apologized to her for being a hypocrite during the reunion, she replied, &#34;No he didn&#39;t.&#34; Kirsten proceeded to share a screenshot of Redditor Arayofwhat&#39;s opinion on her Instagram Story where the 90 Day Fiancé viewer explained why what Tim did was wrong. &#34;When Kirsten was being grilled about why she calls her friend &#39;Papi,&#39; Tim said that&#39;s a term of endearment (he didn&#39;t believe she used it for just a friend),&#34; the fan wrote.

&#34;But later in the show, it comes out that he calls Kenny &#39;Daddy.&#39; So Tim, what&#39;s the deal?&#34; they added. The confused fan had demanded an answer from Tim, and their thoughts resonated with Kirsten. Tim had basically done the same thing with Kenny that Kirsten had done with her friend. Like Tim, most of Kirsten&#39;s co-stars on set refused to believe her side of the story when she said she wasn&#39;t the one who&#39;d cheated in the relationship. However, Kirsten mentioned the name of the one person who won her respect.


 




Kirsten said Wayne was her &#34;favorite person on the reunion,&#34; and explained why. She said that, according to her, Wayne is one of the most &#34;normal&#34; 90 Day Fiancé cast members and is &#34;so down to earth!&#34; Kirsten believes that Wayne didn&#39;t come to the Tell-All for the unnecessary drama. She appreciated how Wayne stood up for her and was calling Julio out. Kirsten revealed that Wayne also checked on her after the Tell-All. She said that part wasn&#39;t aired in the episode. &#34;Btw I also love his country, South Africa,&#34; added Kirsten, who wants to visit South Africa and Australia before she turns 30.

Kirsten thinks Julio recording his conversion with her secretly is an invasion of privacy. She suspects he was saving the clip for when he wanted to conveniently break up with her in the future. As per Kirsten, Julio was the one who developed feelings for another woman while he was dating Kirsten. The woman is now Julio&#39;s girlfriend. Julio tried every trick possible in his book to prove that Kirsten was the one to blame for their split on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. However, once Julio admitted that he was dating the mystery woman, it was easy to see that he was falsely accusing Kirsten of being unfaithful.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
