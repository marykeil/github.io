## Literature Review
Hawkeye&#39;s MCU spinoff, Echo, relased as part of Phase 5, seeing the return of Maya Lopez as well as several new Marvel Studios characters.




Marvel Studios&#39; Echo sees several new characters introduced to the MCU in Phase 5. The Hawkeye spinoff was reported to be in development in March 2021, and officially confirmed by Marvel Studios during Disney&#43; Day in November of that year, with Better Call Saul writer Marion Dayre attached as Echo&#39;s head writer. Echo continues the story of Maya Lopez, a deaf athlete and martial artist with Choctaw heritage who debuted in Hawkeye as a minor adversary for Clint Barton and Kate Bishop.




Echo explores the titular character&#39;s roots in more detail than her previous appearance in Hawkeye. This means that, while a few previous MCU actors reprise their roles for the series, the majority of the Echo cast is composed of MCU newcomers, introducing new faces to the franchise. The series also showcases a culture that hasn&#39;t yet been seen in the live-action MCU timeline, with the show taking care to provide authentic indigenous representation when it comes to its cast.

                  Daredevil Born Again: Release Info, Cast &amp; Everything We Know So Far   After being teased in MCU films and television shows, Matt Murdock is returning to the screen for a series in the Disney&#43; Daredevil: Born Again.     


 Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez, A.K.A. Echo 
         

Alaqua Cox landed her breakout role in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye, never having acted before but bringing the character of Maya Lopez to life perfectly opposite Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld. As a deaf actor, Cox&#39;s casting in Hawkeye was met with huge praise, continuing her engaging performance in her own solo series, Echo. The show sees Lopez return to her hometown in Oklahoma and reconnect with her indigenous roots, learning the value of family and community, as well as addressing Echo&#39;s own origin story. This follows the events of Hawkeye, which saw her leading the Tracksuit Mafia in the wake of her father&#39;s death, and her attack on her surrogate uncle, Kingpin.






 Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock, A.K.A. Daredevil 
          

Charlie Cox debuted as Matt Murdock on Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil, released on Netflix in 2015. Daredevil ran for three seasons before being canceled, at which point the character was integrated into the MCU, starting with a cameo in Spider-Man: No Way Home and a hilarious interaction with Jennifer Walters in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law. Echo marks Cox&#39;s return as Daredevil ahead of his own 18-episode Disney&#43; series, Daredevil: Born Again, and establishes a bond between Daredevil and Echo, who share a romantic connection in Marvel Comics.



 Vincent D&#39;Onofrio as Wilson Fisk, A.K.A. Kingpin 
          




Much like Charlie Cox, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio made the move from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil to the MCU following the cancelation of the Marvel Television shows. D&#39;Onofrio reprised the role of Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. Kingpin, in Hawkeye, introduced as the surrogate uncle to Maya Lopez and the cause of her father&#39;s death. Fisk was wounded in the final moments of Hawkeye, and Echo covers both his recovery and his backstory with Maya herself.



 Zahn McClarnon as William Lopez 
          

The confirmation that Zahn McClarnon would be reprising his role from Hawkeye for Echo revealed that some of the series would be set in the past before the show even aired, as McClarnon portrays Echo&#39;s deceased father, William Lopez. Flashbacks in Hawkeye introduced Lopez as the former leader of the Tracksuit Mafia and an associate of Wilson Fisk, who became an important figure in their family but also caused Lopez&#39; death at the hands of Ronin, Clint Barton&#39;s Blip persona.






 Devery Jacobs as Bonnie 
          

In April 2022, Deadline reported that Devery Jacobs, star of Reservation Dogs and American Gods, would be assuming a lead role in Echo, taking on the role of a character known as Bonnie. Bonnie is revealed to be Maya Lopez&#39; cousin, with the pair having an almost sister-like bond in their youth. Maya leaving with her father for New York meant the two grew up very differently - especially with Echo becoming an agent of Kingpin - meaning that their reunion in Echo sees their dynamic be drastically changed from its childhood form.

Jacobs will previously be best known to the MCU audiences as the voice of Kahhori in What If...? season 2, but also notably stars as Elora Danan Postoak in Reservation Dogs, a series following four Indigenous teenagers who commit and fight crime daily, created by Sterlin Harjo and MCU veteran Taika Waititi, director of Thor: Ragnarok and Thor: Love &amp; Thunder.






 Echo Supporting Cast &amp; Characters 
          

 Actor Name  Role In Echo   Tantoo Cardinal  Chula   Katarina Ziervogel  Taloa   Cody Lightning  Biscuits   Chaske Spencer  Henry   Graham Greene  Skully   Andrew Howard  Zane   Morningstar Angeline  Lowak   Dannie McCallum  Tuklo   



Tantoo Cardinal as Chula - With previous roles in Dances With Wolves, Wind River, and Stumptown, Tantoo Cardinal is a fantastic addition to Marvel Studios&#39; Echo, having been cast in May 2022. A Canadian actor of Cree and MÃ©tis heritage, Cardinal plays the role of Chula, Maya Lopez&#39; grandmother.




Katarina Ziervogel as Taloa - Katarina Ziervogel may be best known outside of her MCU appearance for writing the 2023 post-apocalypse sci-fi movie Finality Of Dusk. In the MCU, Katarina Ziervogel plays the role of Maya&#39;s mother, who dies when Maya is still a child.

Cody Lightning as Biscuits - Also of Cree heritage, Cody Lightning was cast in Echo in May 2022, with the show revealing him to be playing Biscuits, another of Maya&#39;s cousins. Lightning is best known for his roles in 1998&#39;s Smoke Signals and 2007&#39;s Four Sheets to the Wind, both of which earned him acting award nominations. Cousin Biscuits serves as some comedy relief in the MCU&#39;s first R-rated show, balancing out the action-packed and oftentimes bleak events of the series with some well-intentioned levity.

Chaske Spencer as Henry - Best known for his roles in the Twilight film series and the BBC and Amazon Prime&#39;s The English series, Chaske Spencer was cast in Echo in May 2022. Spencer&#39;s personal heritage in the indigenous cultures of Oklahoma make him the perfect fit for the Oklahoma-set Echo, where he plays the role of Maya&#39;s uncle. Notably, Spencer previously portrayed the minor role of Jace Montero in Netflix&#39;s Jessica Jones, so Echo isn&#39;t his first foray into the world of Marvel.




Graham Greene as Skully - Indigenous Canadian actor Graham Greene&#39;s casting in Echo was reported in March 2022 and later confirmed by Marvel Studios in May 2022. The Academy Award-nominated actor has had major roles in dozens of projects, including Dances With Wolves, Die Hard with a Vengeance, The Green Mile, Casino Jack, and Wind River, so he is a stellar addition to the cast of Echo. Skully is a long-time friend of the Lopez family and owner of a local shop in Echo, proving a valuable ally for Maya in the show&#39;s story.

Andrew Howard As Zane - Longtime MCU viewers may recognize Andrew Howard from Agents of SHIELD, wherein he played the role of Luther Banks. Instead, Echo sees Howard become one of Kingpin&#39;s henchmen, helping him control his criminal empire in the Marvel franchise. Helpfully, Andrew Howard has plenty of action experience for this role, including appearances in Taken 3, Limitless, and Tenet.

Morningstar Angeline as Lowak - Prior to the MCU, the Navajo, Chippewa, Blackfeet, Shoshone, and Latinx actor Morningstar Angeline played roles in a wide selection of projects, including Outer Range, Westworld, Army Of The Dead, and Seeds. Within the MCU, they play the role of Lowak, who is one of Maya&#39;s Choctaw ancestors and plays an important role within the plot of Echo.




Dannie McCallum as Tuklo - Dannie McCallum has appeared in Day 5, As Far As The Eye Can See, and Texas Cotton, as well as appearing as an extra in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2. McCallum appears as another ancestor of Maya Lopez known as Tuklo, who is similarly important to the overall plot of Echo.
