# A Great &amp; Worst Star Trek TNG s Episode Happened Because Of 1988 Writer s Strike


## SUMMARY 



  The Writer&#39;s Strike of 1988 affected Star Trek: The Next Generation, resulting in a shortened season 2 with only 22 episodes instead of 26, and a poorly received clip show as the finale.   Despite the challenges caused by the strike, it also led to the creation of one of TNG&#39;s best episodes, &#34;The Measure of a Man,&#34; written by Melinda M. Snodgrass, who joined the staff as a writer and script editor.   &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; tackles ethical issues and introduces important characters like Dr. Bruce Maddox, remaining relevant even today. It is a standout episode that explores complex themes beyond Data&#39;s storyline.

## Literature Review
The Writers Guild of America Strike of 1988 led to one great Star Trek: The Next Generation episode and one infamously bad one.




The WGA Strike of 1988 led to one great episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, as well as one of the show&#39;s worst episodes. Following the adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the USS Enterprise-D, TNG got off to a rocky start with its inconsistent first season. Writers came and went with surprising regularity throughout TNG&#39;s first two seasons, and these issues were further confounded by a writer&#39;s strike that began in March of 1988. TNG had begun to find its footing by the end of the first season, but the strike meant season 2 got off to a rough start.




Although Star Trek: The Next Generation didn&#39;t truly hit its stride until season 3, there were hints of greatness throughout the show&#39;s first two seasons. One of TNG&#39;s best episodes comes in season 2, and it might not have ever been made if not for the 1988 Writer&#39;s Strike. But the strike caused its fair share of problems as well. Because of the strike, the episode count for TNG season 2 was shortened from 26 to 22 episodes. Despite having fewer episodes to film, the producers of TNG ran out of money before the last episode, resulting in an infamously bad clip show.



The Writers Guild of America Strike of 1988 lasted 153 days, making it the longest-lasting WGA strike to date. The recent 2023 Writer&#39;s Strike lasted 148 days.





 The Writer&#39;s Strike Led To TNG&#39;s &#34;The Measure Of A Man&#34; 
Data&#39;s very existence is put on trial.
         




Star Trek: The Next Generation season 2, episode 9, &#34;The Measure of Man,&#34; focuses on Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), as his rights as a sentient being are called into question. Often considered to be one of TNG&#39;s best episodes, &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; was written by a writer who had never produced a television script. Due to the Writer&#39;s Strike and other behind-the-scenes problems, the producers of TNG put out a call for spec scripts from writers who weren&#39;t currently involved in the show. Science fiction writer and former attorney Melinda M. Snodgrass submitted her script for &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; and it was accepted and produced.



Snodgrass&#39;s script so impressed the TNG producers that she was asked to join the staff as a writer and script editor. She went on to write four more episodes before leaving at the end of the show&#39;s third season.




&#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; is a near-perfect episode of Star Trek, as it tackles complicated ethical issues that remain relevant even today. The plot may revolve around Data, but &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; is an important episode for Captain Picard and Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), as well. The episode also introduces Dr. Bruce Maddox (Brian Brophy) as a cyberneticist who wants to dismantle Data to learn more about the technology used to create him. Maddox will be referenced in later TNG episodes before returning in Star Trek: Picard (portrayed by John Ales).






 TNG&#39;s Season 2 Clip Show Was Also A Result Of The Writer&#39;s Strike 
A comatose Riker relives some old memories.
          

On the other end of the spectrum in terms of quality, Star Trek: The Next Generation season 2, episode 22, &#34;Shades of Gray,&#34; has little to recommend it. When Commander Riker becomes infected with a deadly virus, Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) puts him into a machine that forces him to relive past memories. This leads to a series of clips from previous TNG episodes, as Pulaski works to determine which kinds of memories will best fight off the virus. With a paper-thin plot, &#34;Shades of Gray&#34; includes 21 different clips from past episodes, and features only regular and recurring characters.

The team behind TNG had spent too much of their budget on earlier season 2 episodes, such as the period-piece &#34;Elementary, Dear Data,&#34; and the CGI-heavy &#34;Q Who.&#34; Because of this, they had little money left for the series finale, and head writer Maurice Hurley had the idea for a clip show. Facing pressure from Paramount to complete the episode quickly, &#34;Shades of Gray&#34; was filmed in only 3 days, with most of that time spent on the sickbay set. &#34;Shades of Gray&#34; ended Star Trek: The Next Generation season 2 on a sour note, and the clip show couldn&#39;t be more different from the excellent &#34;The Measure of a Man.&#34;






Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
