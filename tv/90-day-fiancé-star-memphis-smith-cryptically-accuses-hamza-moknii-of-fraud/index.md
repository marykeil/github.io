## Literature Review
A year after splitting from Hamza Moknii, 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days’ Memphis Smith raises awareness about immigration marriage fraud.




Memphis Smith from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days claimed Hamza Moknii committed immigration fraud. The Michigan resident debuted on the spin-off in 2021. She joined the show with her then-partner, Hamza, and traveled to Tunisia to marry him. Memphis and Hamza faced numerous cultural and language barriers during 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. At one point, the American woman even discovered that her partner had lied about his age. But she stayed with him and tied the knot. The couple got pregnant, moved to the United States, and attended the Tell-All as a happy couple. However, the two soon separated but didn’t reveal why.




Recently, Memphis shared more about her problematic relationship with Hamza. She took to her Instagram and implied that Hamza committed immigration marriage fraud with her. The mom of three claimed she wanted to spread awareness regarding the issue because it happens to many victims.


 

She claimed she wanted to start talking about this fraud problem because “there isn’t enough awareness and support” for people who go through this. Memphis stated she won’t talk about her “actual lived experience” with Hamza yet. She shared that those details are preserved for the “right people,” presumably lawyers and judges.

 Memphis &amp; Hamza&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          




Hamza arrived in the United States after marrying Memphis in Tunisia. The couple even welcomed a daughter together and seemed to be on the same page. However, something changed in early 2022 when Memphis and Hamza removed each other’s photos from social media. They were then rumored to be involved in a court case and custody battle for their child. Hamza was posting about how Memphis wasn’t letting him meet his daughter while Memphis was acting shady. She even filed for bankruptcy after finalizing her divorce in October 2022. Neither of the former cast members has truly shared what happened.

Memphis and Hamza had a strange relationship that never made sense. Memphis handpicked Hamza and almost forced him to marry her. She seemed desperate to tie the knot and even gave him an ultimatum. If Hamza had committed immigration marriage fraud, he would’ve been the one to be desperate about the wedding. However, he was mostly reluctant to marry her in a rush like any normal guy. Former cast member Mohamed Abdelhamed pushed Yve Arellano to file the paperwork for him during 90 Day Fiancé season 9. If Hamza were a fraud, he would’ve shown the same attitude.




Still, there may be more to Memphis and Hamza’s story than meets the eye. Since reality TV shows are often just a minor part of a cast member’s life, it’s hard to say who’s right. Memphis has taken the initiative to bring awareness about fraud, which suggests that she has been through a lot in recent months. She may have experienced some things with Hamza that were never evident from watching the show. Similarly, Hamza may have faced challenges he could never discuss due to his language limitations and contractual obligations. Hopefully, the coming few months will bring more answers to one of the wildest 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days breakups.
