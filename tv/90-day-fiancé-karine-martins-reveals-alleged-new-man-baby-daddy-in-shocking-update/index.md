## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Karine Martins allegedly reveals the name of the new man in her life before claiming that she&#39;s also pregnant with his baby.




90 Day Fiancé star Karine Martins is posting about her alleged new “fiancé” with whom she will have a baby. Karine is a 27-year-old from Brazil and last starred in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 5 with Paul Staehle, 40. Paul and Karine had met online and debuted in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1 in 2017. They were not the right match for each other due to trust and communication issues, but they welcomed two sons while their marriage was on the brink of breaking down. A video showing Karine allegedly assaulting Paul surfaced in December 2022 leading to their split.




Karine was linked to Bachelorette alum Josh Seiter in November 2022 but has been seemingly single since then, as Karine never spoke about any new relationship on social media. However, on January 13, 2023, (as shared by Reddit user u/Accurate_Stomach568) Karine shared a cryptic story about her new man.


 

“This is my real fiancé and yes I am pregnant with his baby,” the caption read. “Go f*** yourself Paul. This is a real man and he will kill you if you f*** with me anymore!!!!” the message. Karine had added a screenshot of the Facebook profile of a man named “Michael Rome Scoccola.”

 Is Paul Posting From Karine&#39;s Instagram Page? 
          

90 Day Fiancé fans saw Karine deleting the post and quickly making another one to say it wasn’t she who posted it. Karine’s new story read, “I didn’t post that, I’m not with anyone, everyone knows who posted that.” It was easy for fans to deduce that it was Paul who had posted the story about Karine getting engaged and being pregnant on her IG page. “This wasn’t her! Pole uses her socials and posts this shit to make her look insane. This wasn’t her post,” wrote MatchaTiger in the comments. Some fans wondered why Karine hadn’t changed her passwords yet, considering Paul was controlling her social media.

“Maybe the original email used to set up her socials could be associated with Paul,” wondered Nearby-Buy-9588. Karine ended up posting a different story where she said “sorry” to her fans for the “drama.” She continued, “I want you guys to know I am not pregnant and I am single.” Karine mentioned that the man was only a “good friend” and not someone who would “hurt” anyone. “You guys know who has always made the drama in my life. Please don’t send him messages,” the text read. “This is definitely Pole posting as her,” wrote Waste_Variation_6754. Reddit user oooheycait1223 thought “The wording of this seems very ‘Americanized.’”




Earlier this month, 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Paul himself had posted a similar Instagram story where he congratulated a man named Jonathan M Rueff and Karine on their wedding. Paul and Karine were reportedly spotted together at Disneyland in October 2023. Still, back then, Paul had claimed that he and Karine were not together, and he was dating an indigenous woman from the Amazon. Paul and Karine have been fighting for the custody of their sons after losing them to Child Protective Services following their fight. Meanwhile, Paul had made headlines recently by going “missing” in Brazil.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
