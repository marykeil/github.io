## Literature Review
Sister Wives stars Christine Brown and Kody Brown share six children, and their thoughts on plural marriage range in severity, but are still shocking.




Sister Wives has shown the Brown family as Kody Brown&#39;s 18 children have all grown up, but in witnessing Christine Brown&#39;s wedding to David Woolley, some of the Brown children are sharing their newfound opinions on polygamy as a practice. Kody and Christine&#39;s split during Sister Wives season 17 took the family by surprise, but the separation had been a long time coming for Kody&#39;s third wife. After joining the family in 1994, Christine&#39;s relationships with Meri Brown and Janelle Brown had been fully formed, but the family&#39;s relationship with Robyn Brown changed their lives entirely. Christine and Kody&#39;s split was difficult, but ultimately for the best for both.




In a preview from the recent Sister Wives (via Access Hollywood) wedding special, Christine&#39;s daughters share their thoughts on plural marriage. Though it&#39;s the lifestyle they grew up in, none of them would want to raise their kids in polygamy. &#34;I just don’t think polygamy’s good for everyone – it wasn’t good for my mom, in the end. It was good for her for a while, and then she needed something different,&#34; Aspyn Thompson, who&#39;s been married to her husband since 2018.


 

Kody and Christine&#39;s daughter Ysabel Brown explained that she &#34;would never want to live polygamy,&#34; though she&#39;s, &#34;really thankful&#34; for the siblings polygamy gave her. &#34;It’s amazing, and so many moms. It’s really fun, but I don’t think I’d want that for my kids,&#34; Ysabel shared.

 Mykelti Admits Kody &amp; Christine’s Marriage Had Issues From The Beginning 
          

While Ysabel and Aspyn both shared that they don&#39;t want to practice polygamy in their own lives, Mykelti Padron discussed her feelings surrounding the practice, sharing when her perspective changed from positive to negative. &#34;“Honestly, in Las Vegas is when my opinion about polygamy started to really shift,&#34; Mykelti shared, citing the family&#39;s move from Utah to Nevada as the beginning of her issue with plural marriage &#34;[My mom’s] last year with David has really been incredible, it’s been everything that my mom deserves, everything that she’s ever wanted – so it’s more of an obvious tell that something was wrong from the beginning if it’s so perfect now.”





 

Christine&#39;s children have seen firsthand the toll that living in an unhappy marriage has taken on their mother, even without the factor of polygamy coming into play. Christine and Kody’s relationship was difficult despite the added element of polygamy, which pushed Kody to stay separate from their family unit often. Though Kody’s issues with Christine are his alone, their marriage has deeply impacted the way their kids look at love and familial relationships. In seeing how happy Christine is with David, all of the Brown children have been able to realize that something wasn’t right in their parent&#39;s marriage all along and understand that moving forward is always an option.

Knowing that Christine is happy with David and moving into a new phase of her life with him gives the Brown children, especially Kody and Christine&#39;s kids, a new perspective on what a healthy relationship can look like. With polygamy not seeming to be something that any of Christine or Janelle&#39;s children are interested in, it&#39;ll be interesting to see in the future if Robyn and Kody&#39;s kids will find themselves committing to it. Regardless, knowing that the Brown children are living happy lives outside of their family of origin will be great for Sister Wives viewers to see in the future.
