## Literature Review
Ink Master doesn&#39;t always choose the best winner. Here are five winners who deserved it, and five who didn&#39;t.




Paramount Network’s Ink Master is a gripping show, but some winners deserved the coveted spot more than others. Whether tuning in solely for the artistry of the tattoos themselves (or to mock the more questionable ones), the increasingly odd flash challenges, the dramatic rivalries between contestants, or some combination of these things, it’s a heck of a ride. Some things about Ink Master are fake, but who wins is real.




There are fan-favorite artists and those who don&#39;t garner love heading into the finale. Over its run, Ink Master has both satisfied viewers and left them cold, with (as is the case with reality shows everywhere) deserved winners taking the title in some seasons and more controversial choices winning out in others. This phenomenon led to a straightforward ranking of the best Ink Master seasons. Let’s look at some of the worthiest winners and those who maybe shouldn’t have won.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Cleen Rock One - Deserved to Win 
Ink Master Season 11
         

Season 11, as with most seasons of the show, presented a unique spin on the concept. Ink Master: Grudge Match - Cleen vs. Christian placed two of the most talented, versatile, and volatile competitors, Cleen Rock One and Christian Buckingham, at the heads of their teams of hand-picked artists.




While the two coaches weren’t competing for the title of Ink Master, they had a finale in which their ultimate goal was to defeat the other and claim their own $100,000 prize. While Buckingham prohibited Cleen from tattooing in his signature new school style, he still pulled off a huge, bold, and beautiful piece, which was a worthy winner over Buckingham’s effort.



 Anthony Michaels - Deserved to Win 
Ink Master Season 7
          

Long-time Ink Master viewers and tattoo artists will know just how necessary experience is in the industry. However talented an artist might be, technically, artistically. In every other respect, certain things can only be achieved after spending many years putting ink on the skin.

Everyone underestimated Arizona’s Anthony Michaels, who had been tattooing for just five years when he competed in season 7. Only fellow competitor Ashley Velasquez had such little time in the business under her belt. Nonetheless, Michaels shined throughout the competition, proving his wide-ranging ability. At the finale, his ambitious dragon chest tattoo won the day.






 Joey Hamilton - Deserved to Win 
Ink Master Season 3
          

Joey Hamilton is the co-owner of Revolt Tattoos in Las Vegas, Nevada. Alongside him is Sausage, making this shop a force to be reckoned with. Unlike Sausage, though, Hamilton didn’t fall short when he competed in season 3. He may have only won Tattoo of the Day twice, but he defined himself very early as a competitor to watch. With solid performances in every tattoo style he was tasked with, Hamilton’s impressive mermaid and underwater scene deservedly won the day at the finale.



 Josh Payne - Deserved to Win 
Ink Master Season 3
          

Josh Payne sometimes irritated his opponents and team members with his aggressive ways, but unlike some contestants, he always backed this talk up with his art. He was given some of the most troublesome canvasses and outlandish ideas, but he always did them justice and won Tattoo of the Day four times.






 Ryan Ashley - Deserved to Win 
Ink Master Season 8
         

Season 8 brought about the first female winner of Ink Master. Fortunately, this was guaranteed in 2016, as the Peck vs Nuñez contest ended with two women standing: Kelly Doty and Ryan Ashley. These artists famously allied during the season, which worked. It wasn’t just about politics in the loft; between them, these talented women won almost every Tattoo of the Day. Ashley took four of them, a brilliant and well-rounded artist who deserved the prize.



 Scott Marshall - Didn&#39;t Deserve to Win 
Ink Master Season 4
          

Scott Marshall, who tragically passed away in 2015 at the age of just 41, was a fantastic tattoo artist and an asset to the industry. However, he was outshone by a fellow season 4 competitor, who made it to the finale stage with Marshall but walked away with the runner-up spot.




Fan-favorite Walter “Sausage” Frank won Tattoo of the Day four times throughout the season, the most of any contestant. Along the way, he endeared himself to viewers with his cheery personality and beautiful, delicate, powerful tattoos, allowing his work to do the talking rather than engaging in the squabbles, drama, and pettiness that often define life in the loft.



 Jason Clay Dunn - Didn&#39;t Deserve to Win 
Ink Master Season 5
          

 In contrast to Anthony Michaels, Jason Clay Dunn had the most experience of all of season 5’s contestants besides Mark Longenecker, who also took part in this season and came fourth. Both men had been tattooing for two decades when they appeared on the show.

Ultimately, season 5 proved to be a genuinely mixed bag. While it’s always nice to see an underdog defeat the odds against them and prevail, Dunn battled it out in the finale with Eric Siuda and the incomparable Cleen Rock One, artists who had perhaps proven to be more well-rounded throughout the competition. Dunn’s highs and lows were a thrill to watch throughout, but he didn&#39;t deserve to win.






 DJ Tambe &amp; Bubba Irwin, Old Town Ink - Didn&#39;t Deserve to Win 
Ink Master Season 9
         

Ink Master season 9 was divisive. Shop Wars saw pairs of artists representing their studios for the joint titles of Ink Master and Master Shop. This season, the classic Ink Master returning veterans were out in full force, which changed the course of the competition.

Bubba Irwin was the first of the veterans to return, representing Old Town Ink alongside DJ Tambe. As strong a team as the duo proved, many other contestants raised concerns that DJ was ‘carrying’ Bubba. DJ went on to become an Ink Master legend (coaching his team in season 10’s Return of the Masters and defeating Steve Tefft and Anthony Michaels’ teams to win twice back-to-back), leaving some to question whether Bubba’s return unjustly derailed the chances of many of the new teams who were more solid as a unit.






 Dave Kruseman - Didn&#39;t Deserve to Win 
Ink Master Season 6
          

Season 6 presented another twist on the Ink Master format in the shape of Master vs Apprentice. As both apprentices and mentors started to fall away, the cream of the competition began to rise to the top. Second-place artist Chris Blinston was the show&#39;s star throughout, while third-place Matt O’Baugh was robbed of the opportunity even to show off his master canvas. As a result, this finale proved highly controversial all around.



 Tony Mendellin - Didn&#39;t Deserve to Win 
Ink Master Season 11
          

 Ink Master always emphasizes the idea that the winner should be the best overall artist who doesn’t balk at any challenge. That’s what it means to be an Ink Master. That’s the theory, but it doesn’t always work out that way. Like other artists such as Sausage, Joey Hamilton, and Ryan, Tiffer Wright put in a fantastic performance in Season 11, winning Tattoo of the Day a stunning five times (giving his team a tremendous advantage in the process). Many tipped him to win the title, but he came third in the finale. Fantastic as winner Tony Mendellin’s Odin tattoo was, stunning as TJ Poole’s black and white piece was, third place was a massive injustice for Tiffer.
