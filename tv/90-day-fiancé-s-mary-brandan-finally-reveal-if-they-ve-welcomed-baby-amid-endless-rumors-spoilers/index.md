## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Mary Demasu-ay finally puts an end to speculation over whether she and Brandan DeNuccio are parents yet.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay are sharing an exciting baby update with curious fans amid rumors of their split. Brandan and Mary, both 23, met on a dating app two years ago. They started an online relationship and stayed connected via a video call 24/7. Their relationship was deemed toxic because Mary and Brandan had trust issues they couldn&#39;t overcome. Brandan moved to the Philippines in 2022, and the couple became pregnant within three months. A wedding was planned while Mary was unsure about spending the rest of her life with Brandan.




Mary and Brandan&#39;s disastrous wedding was recently featured in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, after which 90 Day Fiancé confirmed that they welcomed a baby girl.


 

The show&#39;s Instagram handle posted a photo of Mary and Brandan&#39;s daughter and a statement about her birth. &#34;Our daughter, Midnight, is worth everything and I’ve never been this happy in my whole life,&#34; the statement said while revealing that they named their daughter Midnight. Meanwhile, ET revealed that Mary gave birth to Midnight on August 15, 2023, via C-section.


 Mary &amp; Brandan&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Split Rumors Explained 
          




&#34;When I heard our baby crying for the first time during my C-section, I got teary-eyed,&#34; Mary told ET. She said she was very happy to have welcomed a baby into the world. It appears both statements were shared by Mary and not by both of them. There have been rumors about a split between Mary and Brandan since October 2023 when she did an Instagram Live in the middle of a fight with her husband. Mary cried on camera as she asked him to buy her a phone so she could create content and earn money for the family. Brandan, however, had already spent the money on a video game.

Brandan and Mary have argued about his video game obsession even on 90 Day Fiancé. Mary realized Brandan was neglecting her to focus on his games after she told him she was pregnant. His obsession did not stop as Mary became the sole earner in the relationship and opened a store outside their home. She also began reselling cell phones locally to earn extra cash. Despite her efforts, Brandan blamed her for not keeping track of their finances. His mother advised him to stay away from video games now that he was going to become a husband and a father.




However, nothing has changed since then, as Brandan continues to play games and ignore Mary&#39;s problems. Mary recently posted an Instagram Story where she wished that both of them could find someone better as they didn&#39;t deserve each other. She has been regretful about leaving college, which she did because Brandan was jealous of her hanging out with male friends in her dance group. Mary lost her dance scholarship and dropped out of college. She also quit modeling because Brandan didn&#39;t approve. While their current relationship status remains a mystery, perhaps the upcoming 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell-All will have all the answers.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
