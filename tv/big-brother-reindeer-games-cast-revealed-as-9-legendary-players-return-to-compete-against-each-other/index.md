## Literature Review
Nine Big Brother legends are returning to compete against each other on Big Brother Reindeer Games, a new holiday-themed competition show.




The much-anticipated cast of Big Brother Reindeer Games has been announced, as nine Big Brother legends compete in this fun and festive holiday-themed show. During the Big Brother 25 finale, host Julie Chen Moonves announced that Big Brother Reindeer Games will premiere on December 11. Nine icons of the game will compete, including one Big Brother 25 houseguest.




The Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 cast has been announced by CBS. Danielle Reyes (seasons 3 and 7), Britney Haynes (seasons 12 and 14), and Frankie Grande (season 16) will compete. They kicked off Big Brother 25 by accidentally unleashing the multiverses via the Time Laser and returned during the season finale to announce Big Brother Reindeer Games. In addition, winners Nicole Franzel (season 18, also seasons 16 and 22), Josh Martinez (season 19), Cody Calafiore (season 22, also season 16), Xavier Prather (season 23), and Taylor Hale (season 24) will return to defend their crowns. From Big Brother 25, America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest winner Cameron Hardin will compete.


 What To Expect From Big Brother Reindeer Games 
          

Big Brother Reindeer Games will have six episodes. Unlike a regular Big Brother season, there will be no live feeds because the contestants won&#39;t be living in the house. Instead, the show will have pre-taped competitions, rather than a social game. Julie won&#39;t be the host, but Big Brother icons Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will serve as &#34;Santa&#39;s Elves,&#34; guiding the players through each show. In each episode, the contestants will play in three competitions that will culminate in &#34;Santa&#39;s Showdown,&#34; which determines the players who will be eliminated. Four players will compete in the December 21 finale, with the winner taking home the $100,000 prize.





 

Big Brother promised that legends would appear on Big Brother Reindeer Games, and they certainly delivered. These nine contestants are some of the best to ever play the game, but they all had very different styles of gameplay. While some people such as Frankie and Cameron relied on their competition skills, others like Britney and Taylor were more social gamers. It seems that Big Brother Reindeer Games will be more about competition wins, so it&#39;ll be fun to watch the players adjust their strategies in order to win. Some of these players have competed in multiple seasons, so they&#39;ve already experienced that.

It&#39;s also exciting to see so many recent Big Brother winners return to the game. It&#39;ll be thrilling to see them compete against each other, especially since many of them have never played together before. The true competition beasts will rise to the top as these legends compete on Big Brother Reindeer Games.

Big Brother Reindeer Games premieres Monday, December 11 at 9 p.m. EST on CBS.
