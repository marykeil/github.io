Summary

  The For All Mankind season 4 finale&#39;s time jump sets up a future where the heist succeeds, according to creator Ben Nedivi, leading to investments in Mars and the asteroid.   The show&#39;s creators are excited about the potential to explore a larger colony on Mars and even travel beyond Mars.   Positive signs suggest that a fifth season of For All Mankind is likely, with conversations already happening about ideas for it.  







For All Mankind co-creator Ben Nedivi addresses the sci-fi drama&#39;s latest time jump and teases what comes next for one of the most popular Apple TV&#43; shows. Already no stranger to grand finales, For All Mankind season 4 took things to a new level with a thrilling space heist, a brush with death that brought the community together, and a leap forward into 2012. The finale arrived recently on Apple TV&#43; and teed up a dramatic season 5.

In an interview with TVLine, Nedivi broke down the finale and gave an update on how the stories play into a potential For All Mankind season 5. In the quote below, Nedivi answers a question about the time jump and the hopes of going further in terms of what the show can accomplish with its space travel focus:


For us, that image at the end says two things: One, that this insane heist actually worked. It paid off. They are investing in Mars and investing in the asteroid, which, if that’s the case, you have to imagine that the impact of that on Mars would be huge, as well. So for us, what’s always exciting in pushing forward with the show is imagining where we can go. So that means not only with the asteroid and the impact that has on Mars, and possibly going to a colony now that is much bigger than the one you see in Season 4, but even the potential now of going further than Mars. That’s always been in the back of our minds, that roadmap of the show, and the further we can go with it, the further we can take space travel, as well.






 Will For All Mankind Season 5 Happen? 
          

Apple TV&#43; has yet to confirm For All Mankind season 5, but there are positive signs that it is likely. The streaming service recently shared its top originals. The list included Slow Horses, The Morning Show, and Silo. All three have been renewed for new seasons. For All Mankind is very much included among Apple&#39;s popular originals, and it&#39;s even mentioned that the Emmy-winning space drama beat its previous season numbers with its most recent viewership figures.

Although specific numbers aren&#39;t mentioned, it tends to be a good sign whenever a streaming service singles out a show to highlight. Ronald Moore, who created the show with Matt Wolpert and Nedivi, recently spoke about the show&#39;s future encouragingly and mentioned that there have been conversations about For All Mankind season 5. He had said:






There&#39;s definitely been more conversation about it, yeah. You can sense things are starting to pick up, and just industry-wide everyone&#39;s starting to gear up towards, “Okay, we know it&#39;s about to all happen again, so let&#39;s start talking in earnest about how we prepare the way for it.”




With a time jump that allows for a shift in the cast and plenty of questions that For All Mankind season 5 can pick up, it&#39;s unlikely that the alternate history show will see an abrupt end. Although plans could change, it&#39;s a somewhat safe bet that audiences will get to see what the series has planned for its version of 2012. Based on Nedivi&#39;s comments, the series may even go well beyond that.





All episodes of For All Mankind are streaming now on Apple TV&#43;.
