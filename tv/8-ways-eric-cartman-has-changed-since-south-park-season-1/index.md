## Literature Review
While Eric Cartman has always been the loudest, most self-centered resident of South Park, that&#39;s not to say he has not changed at all since Season 1.




The character of Eric Cartman from South Park was always an offensive and self-serving elementary school boy, but that is not to say that he has not changed significantly since Season 1 first aired more than 25 years ago. Cartman, like much of the rest of the residents of South Park, has undergone major character changes and developed a much greater level of depth throughout the show’s run. While Cartman was always a loudmouthed, narcissistic, and mischievous character, there are plenty of other characteristics of his that have been subject to great changes.
The different ways that Eric Cartman has changed came down to several factors including changes in the way that the South Park was produced as Cartman’s voice actor and South Park creator Trey Parker has altered the way he portrays the character. Another factor that has played into Cartman’s character changes was the way that South Park itself has changed over the years. What started as an animated piece of toilet humor soon grew into one of the most effective social commentaries on TV. These types of changes and more have all influenced significant changes for Eric Cartman since Season 1.




 8  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into A More Socially Aware Person

South Park creator Trey Parker hated the first three seasons, and it made sense why he felt this way as it had not yet developed into the socially conscious satire it is today. This was true for the character of Eric Cartman as well, as in Season 1 he was nowhere near as socially conscious and up-to-date on current trends as he later became. Newer seasons of South Park saw Cartman manipulating progressive concepts to achieve his aims, and recent season episodes saw Cartman taking stabs at everything from Black Panther (Season 22, Episode 1 &#34;Dead Kids&#34;) to fake news (Season 21, Episode 4, &#34;Franchise Prequel&#34;.)





 7  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into Someone Who Can Appreciate The Value Of Friendship 
Cartman demonstrates more of an appreiciation for friendship in later seasons




One of Eric Cartman’s most consistent character traits throughout South Park was that he would not do anything unless it benefited him directly. However, that might just change with the release of the special episode “South Park (Not Suitable for Children)” which in its final moments showcased a big character change for Eric Cartman. After having berated his fellow students for not drinking the popular sports drink Cred, in the last scene of the special, he demonstrated the value of friendship by giving Clyde his own bottle of the drink and acting like it was always his. This level of empathy was nowhere to be seen in Season 1.





 6  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into A Child With Less Harsh Voice

One of the ways South Park has changed since Season 1 was that the harshness of Eric Cartman’s voice has softened significantly. The way that South Park creator and Cartman voice actor Trey Parker voiced the character in the first season leaned much heavier into the more grating and annoying aspects of Cartman’s voice. As the years went on, Cartman’s voice became more iconic than in its debut inflection, and while it still maintained its unique and recognizable nature, it was far less harsh than in the first season.





 5  Eric Cartman Has Changing Into Much More Of A Villain 
Cartman has positioned himself as capable of great evil in later seasons



In the first season of South Park, Eric Cartman was the most obnoxious friend in the core group, but had not transcended to his later role as a full-blown villain of the series. During the first five seasons of South Park, Cartman steadily outgrew his role as a controversial anti-hero and Matt Stone and Trey Parker began to embrace the most sinister aspects of his character. A pivotal example of Cartman’s development into a villain is “Scott Tenorman Must Die” (Season 5, Episode 4) where Cartman tricked a boy into eating his parents who he had chopped into chili. There was no going back from that level of depravity.





 4  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into A Three-Dimensional Character

Initially, Eric Cartman was a loud-mouthed, mischievous schoolboy somewhat based on the All in the Family sitcom father Archie Bunker. However, as South Park continued throughout the decades, Cartman exhibited signs of being a much more well-rounded and three-dimensional character. While there were hints of hidden depth to Cartman during Season 1, such as the episode where he seeks answers about his father’s identity, later seasons add many more facets to his character. For example, Cartman felt real guilt and remorse in “Awesom-O” (Season 8, Episode 5) where he genuinely struggled with the way he manipulated Butter’s friendship by pretending to be a robot.





 3  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into A Master Manipulator 
Cartman has manipulated those around him to great effect in later seasons
        

While Eric Cartman in Season 1 of South Park was an arrogant and narcissistic character, he was not yet anywhere close to being the master manipulator he would later become. One prime example of this was in &#34;Cartman&#39;s Silly Hate Crime 2000&#34; (Season 4, Episode 2) Cartman manipulates the other prisoners after was sent to juvenile hall for a hate crime against Token, or by his correct name Tolkien Black. Through gift-giving, fake tears, as well as lies and deceit, Cartman was able to convince his fellow inmates to help him escape in just one of the many moments where Cartman showcased his skills as a master manipulator.





 2  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into A Character Willing To Go To Extreme Lengths To Achieve His Goals 
Cartman has hatched excessive plans and gone to great lengths to achieve his aims in later seasons




Season 1 Eric Cartman was willing to push the boundaries to achieve his goals, but this was nothing in comparison to the extreme lengths he went to get what he wanted later. In “Ginger Kids” (Season 9, Episode 11), Cartman was at first prejudiced against those with red hair, that was until the rest of the boys made him appear ginger while he was sleeping. From this point, Cartman, determined to change the reputation of gingers established the “Ginger Separatist Movement”, and argued for placement as a “great race.” Cartman almost encouraged the death of all non-gingers before he realized he was not permanently ginger himself.





 1  Eric Cartman Has Changed Into Someone Who No Longer Relies On Catchphrases 
Cartman has appeared to discontinue his old catchphrases in later seasons South Park was always known for its many memorable catchphrases, however, in later seasons they were less reliant on them and in the most recent releases the old catchphrases are nowhere to be seen. One of Eric Cartman’s most memorable catchphrases “screw you guys, I’m going home” was first uttered in the debut episode “Cartman Gets an Anal Probe” but has all but disappeared from the latest seasons. Other Cartman phrases such as “respect my authoritah” have also fallen out of favor in the newer episodes of South Park.
