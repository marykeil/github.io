## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor isn&#39;t on tonight (November 23). Find out why and when it will return for its season finale when Gerry will make his choice.




The Golden Bachelor is a fan-favorite reality dating series for seniors, and, although it&#39;s not on tonight (November 23), it will return soon for its season finale. The Golden Bachelor stars 72-year-old Gerry Turner, a retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana. Gerry lost his beloved wife, Toni, after 43 years together. They were married in 1974, and had two daughters, Angie and Jenny, and then two granddaughters, Charlee and Payton. Tragically, Toni became ill with a bacterial infection in 2017 and passed away.




Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Gerry has been on a journey to find the next great love of his life. At the start, he had 22 women aged 60 and older vying for his heart. Now Gerry has narrowed down that group to two women: Leslie Fhima and Theresa Nist. As fans eagerly anticipate his decision, they&#39;ll have to wait a bit longer because The Golden Bachelor isn&#39;t airing tonight.
