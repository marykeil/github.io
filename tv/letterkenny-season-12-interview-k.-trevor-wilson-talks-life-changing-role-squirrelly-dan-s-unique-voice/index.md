 K. Trevor Wilson Talks Letterkenny Season 12 
          

Screen Rant: I&#39;m excited to see you again, excited to talk more Letterkenny, although also saddened that it&#39;s the end. What is it like for you, after almost a decade, looking back on this and knowing that it&#39;s coming to a close for the meantime?


K. Trevor Wilson: We shot the last season last September, so we were sitting on the secret for over a year, that the show was ending. I got the call last summer from Keeso that he thought it was time to close the book on this one for the time being. I wasn&#39;t ready to say goodbye, the decision was made for me, not by me, as I&#39;ve said before, and I think we had a few more stories left. I had at least two years left on my option, so I thought we were gonna go to work for a little bit longer.
I was definitely sad to see it go. It&#39;s been a strange year, it was the first year in eight years we didn&#39;t go to summer camp. I hung out with a bunch of the guys a few weeks ago at the Leafs game, and we hadn&#39;t seen each other in over a year. That&#39;s the longest we&#39;d gone without seeing each other since COVID. It&#39;s strange, learning what life is like without Letterkenny, because it&#39;s been a big part of my life for almost 10 years.
I met my wife during the run of this show, I bought my dogs during the run of this show, I lost my dad during the run of this show. A lot happened. When I auditioned for Letterkenny, I didn&#39;t have a bedroom, I slept on a couch in an apartment I shared with three other dudes, and now, I&#39;m sitting in the basement of the house I own, so my life has changed for the better, in a lot of ways. Sometimes, it&#39;s just change, but it&#39;s been a journey, and it&#39;s definitely strange, not putting on those overalls anymore.





Well, what a phenomenal journey it&#39;s been. Since you mentioned more stories, I love that, everybody kind of goes through this evolution of figuring out their futures, but I love Dan&#39;s in particular, because we&#39;ve known he&#39;s been with Lovina for quite a while now, but we&#39;ve also seen him with a few other people here and there. What was it like for you when you saw what Jared and Jacob had planned for this season, and for Dan in particular?


K. Trevor Wilson: Honestly, I wanted to do a bit more. [Laughs] I hope I&#39;m not stepping on any toes by saying that, but Dan just sort of popped in with a new article of clothing every now and again. You really actually didn&#39;t see Dan on the farm. I guess it might have been scheduling or whatnot, but personally, I&#39;d love to have brought Noah and Anita back and seeing Dan working with the Dycks, because working with Sarah and Jonathan was always just a riot, two great actors, two great performers.
We always had a ton of fun shooting the Mennonite stuff with them, so I would actually like to have seen some of that. But other than that, it was a nice little sidebar for Dan, and I got to experiment wearing normal pants for at least one scene. It was good fun, but I kind of wanted to do a bit more.





I hear you, they are always hilarious when they are on screen with y&#39;all, so I think with Jared having a new deal at Hulu and possibly more spinoffs, hopefully you can get more time with them in the future!


K. Trevor Wilson: You never know. You never know.


          

One thing I always love to ask whenever a show is coming to an end, especially with a show like this, where there are so many catchphrases from every different character. What is one character catchphrase or trait that you are going to miss from Dan being in your work lexicon as you move on?


K. Trevor Wilson: I don&#39;t think I can say &#34;allegedly&#34; or &#34;appreciates&#34; for the rest of my life without people perking up and getting excited and adding an s to it. The &#34;to be fair&#34; will haunt me for the rest of my life, also. It&#39;s strange to not have to talk like that anymore, it got to the point that I&#39;d have to, while getting ready for a show, watch the old seasons to be like, &#34;Okay, there&#39;s Dan&#39;s voice.&#34; And then it always took me a couple of weeks afterwards to stop.
Every once in a while, I&#39;ll say something and my wife will say, &#34;Oh, there&#39;s Dan again. Oh, hello Squirrelly Dan. We&#39;ve missed you.&#34; [Laughs] So, anytime an s slips in where it isn&#39;t supposed to be, it&#39;ll make me think of Letterkenny. For the rest of my life, I&#39;m probably going to be doing cameos where people asked me to tell them what I appreciates about them, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever fully go away.







 About Letterkenny Season 12 
         

The residents of Letterkenny belong to one of three groups: the Hicks, the Skids, and the Hockey Players, who are constantly feuding over seemingly trivial matters that often end with someone getting their ass kicked. In Season 12, the small town contends with a comedy night at Modean&#39;s, a country music hit, the Degens&#39; bad influence, a new nightclub, and an encore at the Ag Hall. And thatâ€™s just for starters.
