## Literature Review

Romantic sitcom pairings can be the biggest takeaway from the show&#39;s story, but some fictional relationships don&#39;t always hit the mark.




Sitcoms couples are a huge part of the genre, but some romantic pairings just don&#39;t work that well. However, it&#39;s not always an unintentional move. While there are plenty of occasions where the relationship is supposed to be conceived as authentic, some sitcom couples are forced together by the writers for comedic or dramatic purposes. While the majority of poorly-matched romances don&#39;t tend to last long within their respective shows, there are some that endure. For all the sitcom couples who were actually happy together, there are just as many TV show relationships that are just plain weird.
A couple in a sitcom can feel unusual for various reasons. Sometimes, they just don&#39;t have any chemistry, and other instances make it seem like they might just work better as friends. For others, it can be uncomfortable to watch them interact, whether this is intentional or otherwise. However, even a bad sitcom pairing can lead to some interesting storylines, so they can often be worth exploring.
            
 
 10 TV Romances That Got Worse Over Time 
There are a number of notable TV romances that, as they went on, slowly got worse and worse. 












 








 10  Troy Barnes And Britta Perry In Community 
Troy and Britta&#39;s romance feels forced
        

  Community  
Comedy



  Release Date    September 17, 2009     Cast    Ken Jeong , Chevy Chase , Joel McHale , Jim Rash , Gillian Jacobs , Alison Brie , Yvette Nicole Brown , Donald Glover , Danny Pudi     Seasons    6    


Troy and Britta are great characters, but their relationship comes out of nowhere and never feels genuine. While their opposite natures imply they may attract one another, as per the old adage, their time together is one of the most unusual parts of Community. A good sitcom pairing comes to mind without much thinking, and the duo that sticks out in Community is Troy and Abed - a thoroughly Platonic affair. However, Troy and Britta&#39;s high-concept breakup in season 4, episode 11, &#34;Basic Human Anatomy,&#34; is one of the best Community episodes of all time, so their weird relationship pays off.





 9  Tom Haverford And Ann Perkins In Parks And Recreation 
Ann always feels like she&#39;s tolerating Tom
        

  Parks and Recreation  
Sitcom
Comedy
Mockumentary



  Release Date    April 9, 2009     Cast    Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , â€‹Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&#39;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe     Seasons    7    


Tom&#39;s spell with Ann involves both parties being unapologetically themselves, which is how a relationship should be. The issue is that who they both are as people isn&#39;t conducive to a romantic dynamic. Instead of their interactions being playful or affectionate, it&#39;d be more accurate to say that Ann is always on the verge of losing her patience with Tom, if she hasn&#39;t lost it already. Tom seems much more into the relationship than Ann, who gives the impression that she&#39;d rather be in a terrible couple than stay single.





 8  Mark Corrigan And Saz In Peep Show 
Mark&#39;s temporary roommate was taking advantage of her landlord
        

Some sitcom relationships are never romantic, no matter how much one of the people want them to be. Mark&#39;s love life in Peep Show is nothing short of tragic, as he sabotages even his most promising chances of happiness. His poor judgment is on full display in Peep Show season 5, episode 3, &#34;Jeremy&#39;s Broke,&#34; when Mark suggests to the opportunistic Saz that she should become his girlfriend. Saz sees the chance for a rent-free life and hastily accepts. The shell of a relationship understandably crashes and burns by the end of the episode, which is no surprise at all.

Not many TV couples can say they lasted the whole show, but some romantic pairings stayed together from the beginning and made it to the finale.








 7  JD And Danni Sullivan In Scrubs 
Danni Was Hiding Her True Self The First Time Around
        

  Scrubs  
Comedy
Drama



  Release Date    October 1, 2001     Cast    John C. McGinley , Robert Maschio , Donald Faison , Christa Miller , Neil Flynn , Judy Reyes , Aloma Wright , Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Sam Lloyd , Ken Jenkins     Seasons    9    


JD dates Danni twice in Scrubs. When they meet, Danni comes across as a female DJ, and the pair seem perfectly matched. Their breakup is ultimately due to JD&#39;s lingering feelings for Elliot. However, when JD reinitiates the relationship, it&#39;s done to get Elliot&#39;s attention. Not only is this an unhealthy move, but it also reveals that Danni isn&#39;t so similar to JD after all. During their first stint together, Danni was hiding her true self, so she is actually much more abrasive than JD knew. It becomes obvious very soon after their reunion that they should have stayed apart.





 6  Nathan Shelley And Jade In Ted Lasso 
Nate&#39;s dynamic with Jade felt more like friendship


 







  Ted Lasso  
Comedy
Drama
sport



  Release Date    August 14, 2020     Cast    Jeremy Swift , Phil Dunster , Hannah Waddingham , Nick Mohammed , Brendan Hunt , Jason Sudeikis , Brett Goldstein , Juno Temple , Toheeb Jimoh , James Lance     Seasons    3    


While the story of Nate working up the courage to ask Jade on a date is undeniably sweet, the eventual relationship that follows feels inauthentic at best. Jade isn&#39;t an especially expressive character, which may play some part in how their time together is portrayed. However, Nate and Jade are one of the few happy endings in Ted Lasso, but the love between them feels more like the affection one might have for a friend. Whether it was a casting or writing issue is unclear, but it&#39;s difficult to ever see Nate and Jade as a genuine romantic couple.





 5  Charles Boyle And Eleanor Horstweil In Brooklyn Nine-Nine 
This Brooklyn Nine-Nine pairing pre-dates the first episode


 







  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  
Comedy
Crime



  Release Date    September 17, 2013     Cast    Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio     Seasons    8    


The case of Boyle and Eleanor is an interesting one, as they&#39;re never actually together during the run of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Instead, Boyle mentions his ex-wife on several occasions before her debut in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 3, episode 11, &#34;Hostage Situation.&#34; Boyle is one of the sweetest characters on the show, and Eleanor is shown to be his absolute antithesis. It immediately becomes clear why their marriage ended when Eleanor is shown on screen. Her evil, abusive nature is completely at odds with Boyle&#39;s selflessness and kind heart. While their former relationship makes for good entertainment, it&#39;s objectively unhealthy.
Boyle unconsciously refers to Eleanor as &#34;Mommy,&#34; on a few separate occasions.







 4  Will McKenzie And Charlotte Hinchcliffe In The Inbetweeners 
Will remains unsure if their brief dalliance was a bet
        

The Inbetweeners follows a group of high-school boys on the fringes of their social group, so it comes as a surprise to them all when one of the popular girls shows interest in one of them. Will and Charlotte&#39;s relationship is never really labeled, and it&#39;s also never clear whether it was a relationship at all. Although they have an incredibly awkward sexual encounter, Will is still left confused as to where he stands. Charlotte also doesn&#39;t make it clear of her feelings either. Overall, the pairing doesn&#39;t work well, but it&#39;s clear this is a ploy by the writers.





 3  Leonard Hofstadter And Penny Hofstadter In The Big Bang Theory 
The most famous pair in The Big Bang Theory got married despite all their differences


 







  The Big Bang Theory  
Romance
Comedy



  Release Date    September 24, 2007     Cast    Kaley Cuoco , Johnny Galecki , Jim Parsons , Melissa Rauch , Mayim Bialik , Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg     Seasons    12    


Leonard and Penny&#39;s relationship timeline is one of the biggest parts of The Big Bang Theory. The differences between Leonard and Penny drive them apart more often than their limited similarities draw them together, leading to long spells where they date other people. While they do have moments where it seems they&#39;re well-suited, they more often just seem pushed together out of convenience. The fact that they get married before the show ends communicates the fact that the writers felt the two characters belong together, when the reality of the situation is that their relationship just isn&#39;t all that believable.
Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco, who played Leonard and Penny, dated for a while in real life.







 2  Rainer Shine And Haley Dunphy In Modern Family 
Rainer and Haley&#39;s age gap made the relationship untenable
        

  Modern Family  
Comedy
Mockumentary



  Release Date    September 23, 2009     Cast    Ed O&#39;Neill , Sofia Vergara , Julie Bowen , Ty Burrell , Jesse Tyler Ferguson , Eric Stonestreet , Sarah Hyland , Ariel Winter , Nolan Gould , Rico Rodriguez     Seasons    11    


Rainer Shine is introduced to Modern Family as not just a weatherman, but also Phil&#39;s hero - although this is at least in part due to his brilliant name. Phil inadvertently encourages Rainer to date Haley, which irritates Phil, making Nathan Fillion&#39;s character unusually difficult to root for. During their relationship, Haley is in the midst of trying to figure out her life, while Rainer is looking for something much more. Their divergent interests come to a head during Rainer&#39;s proposal attempt, which Haley initially accepts and then rejects just as quickly.





 1  Joey Tribianni And Rachel Green In Friends 
This Friends pairing felt wrong from the start
        

  Friends  
Comedy
Drama
Sitcom



  Release Date    September 22, 1994     Cast    Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer     Seasons    10    


When a sitcom runs for a long time, it can be interesting to make the characters interact in new ways. Although the arc starts in season 8, Joey and Rachel start dating in Friends season 10. The relationship that sticks out across all 10 seaons of Friends is Ross and Rachel, and it&#39;s still something that&#39;s expected to happen near the end of the show. The fact that Joey is the one who starts dating Rachel so late in the story is nothing short of unusual, especially when it&#39;s considered that she&#39;s carrying Ross&#39; child at the time.
            
 
 10 Sitcom Relationships From The 90s That Would Never Fly Today 
While TV sitcoms from the 90s had some loveable couples, there are a few relationships that just wouldn&#39;t fly today, for various reasons. Take a look.



Everything about the attempt at romance between Joey and Rachel feels off. Luckily, even the characters themselves pick up on their romantic dissonance, ending the brief relationship soon after it starts. Instead of being a genuine attempt by the writers to throw a spanner in the works, Joey&#39;s feelings for Rachel feel more like setting the stage for Ross and Rachel to finally end up together.
