## Literature Review
Janelle Brown, one of the stars of Sister Wives, reveals what could have made her 30-year marriage with Kody Brown much more fruitful and healthy.




Sister Wives star Janelle Brown opened up about the one thing that could’ve strengthened her relationship with Kody Brown. The 54-year-old reality star was the second matriarch of the Brown Family. She married Kody in 1993 and gave polygamy a fair chance for nearly 30 years. Unfortunately, her sacrifices never really paid off in the long run. Kody still preferred his youngest wife, Robyn Brown, over Janelle, Christine, and Meri, which led to inter-family chaos. As of 2023, Kody’s first three wives have separated from him, forcing him to embrace monogamy.




Recently, Janelle and her former sister wife Christine discussed their feelings in an interview with E! News. At one point, the Salt Lake City native shared the one change that could’ve improved her marriage with Kody. She said, “I would probably have more assets in my name,” adding that it’s the one thing that she’d change about her past relationship with Kody. Christine also doubled down on this and added that a husband will treat his wife right if something big is at stake. She said, “You give this woman claim and, oh, he’s going to treat her good.”


 Janelle &amp; Kody Brown&#39;s Sister Wives Relationship Explained 
          

Janelle and Kody had six kids over the last three decades, proving they once had a stable relationship. However, things changed when Robyn came into the Brown family and became the center of Kody’s attention. In 2020, Kody’s behavior changed as he made some new COVID-19 rules for his family. He started spending most of his time with Robyn, leaving Janelle, Christine, and Meri without a husband. As expected, the three ladies didn’t sit idly by and quickly moved on. Janelle became the second wife to leae Kody after filming Sister Wives season 18.





 

Janelle is right about the assets situation. If Kody had equally divided his properties among his four families, he would’ve been more respectful and mindful toward all his wives. However, since nothing important was ever at stake, it allowed him to do as he pleased, regardless of how Meri, Janelle, and Christine felt. Polygamous marriages aren’t legal, which directly impacts various aspects of a relationship, including finances. However, if a person is legally forced to share his assets with his partners, it may one day make polygamy somewhat feasible.

The story of the Brown family isn’t just a reality TV show but also a documented study of plural marriages. Kody’s relationship journey and struggles with Meri, Robyn, Christine, and Janelle show there&#39;s a lot of fascination surrounding plural marriages. Kody is happily married to Robyn and claims he only ever loved her. If that’s the case, it shows that he has been romantically monogamous for over a decade. As for Janelle, she likely also never loved Kody if she was comfortable enough to share him. Maybe one day, the Sister Wives star will find her true soulmate like Christine did in 2023.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
