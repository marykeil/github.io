## Literature Review
Even though Georgie did all he could to impress Mandy, Young Sheldon season 6 secretly gave away why the pair broke up before The Big Bang Theory.




Young Sheldon’s Georgie and Mandy broke up before the events of The Big Bang Theory, but does Georgie marry Mandy sometime before the sequel series begins? Throughout season 6, Young Sheldon offers nods to events that won’t occur until The Big Bang Theory. One episode explains why Young Sheldon’s Meemaw changes before The Big Bang Theory begins, while another offers a sad hint at George Sr’s upcoming death. Several moments question what happens to Missy between Young Sheldon and Big Bang Theory




However, it is Young Sheldon season 6, episode 7, ”A Tougher Nut and a Note on File,” that suggests one of the most unexpected bits of previously unexplored The Big Bang Theory lore. While Georgie and the mother of his first child, Mandy, are no longer together in the show, it is never explained what happens between them, even though Mandy majorly impacts The Big Bang Theory. In the opening scenes of the episode, they unintentionally mirror Mandy’s parents when awkwardly encountering each other at a restaurant. But does Georgie marry Mandy?

                  Young Sheldon Confirms What Happened To Missy After Big Bang Theory   Young Sheldon inadvertently revealed what happened to Missy after she last appeared in The Big Bang Theory for Sheldon&#39;s wedding in season 11.    


 How Georgie &amp; Mandy’s Father Resemble Each Other 
          




 When Georgie and Mandy run into Mandy’s distant parents at a restaurant, it becomes clear that Georgie is too much like Mandy’s father. Mandy is afraid of becoming a carbon copy of her mother as a result. Since Georgie later compares Mandy’s disposition to her mother’s attitude, it is not an unfounded fear. While George Jr.’s attempt to impress Mandy was doomed, he did make a good impression on Mandy’s father, only for Mandy and her mother to simultaneously scold their two love interests for having a conversation.

The two conciliatory men try to shake hands while the hard-headed Mandy and her equally obstinate mother discourage this peace offering. Mandy has reason to worry about her and George recreating the loveless dynamic her parents had since Georgie essentially mirrors her father in both interactions. This still makes fans wonder - does Georgie marry Mandy?



 Why Mandy Didn’t Want To End Up Like Her Parents 
          




Mandy doesn&#39;t want to end up like her parents because her father undermined her mother, and her mother doesn&#39;t trust her father’s judgment. The two were at odds rather than working together as a team. This is something that became obvious when Mandy’s father went behind her mother’s back to offer her money (via the Coopers). Mandy spent season 6 befriending Young Sheldon&#39;s Missy and even tolerating Sheldon.

However, Mandy can&#39;t stand the thought of becoming like her mother, since her parents had a dysfunctional, unhappy marriage. This makes her and Georgie’s eventual breakup before The Big Bang Theory inevitable, despite the Young Sheldon couple seeming stable. The only question now is how Georgie and Mandy end up together, and what leads to their breakup.



 Where Do Georgie &amp; Mandy Stand After Young Sheldon Season 6? 
         




It is almost assured that Georgie and Mandy will get married thanks to Big Bang Theory showing that Georgie and two of his ex-wives send him congratulatory text messages. Thanks to what happened in Young Sheldon season 6, it is almost certain they did get married, even if they ended up divorced. One of the biggest running storylines in season 6 sees Mandy (29) pregnant with Georgie&#39;s (17) baby. The two break up, but Meemaw is always there to help Mandy and does everything she can to make sure that the pregnancy goes safely, and that Mandy is in a good place.

However, as the season wears on, Georgie and Mandy end up growing closer together. In &#34;A Launch Party and a Whole Human Being,&#34; Mandy has their baby, Constance, and the two of them take the baby home. It looks like Georgie is going to get a happy ending, as this occurs in the season 6 double-finale, where Georgie asks Mandy to marry him in &#34;A Romantic Getaway and a Germanic Meat-Based Diet,&#34; and she finally says yes.




However, as Big Bang Theory reveals, this is where things get tough for Georgie because the family spends so much on getting Sheldon and Mary to Germany, that he has to build his tire business from scratch. This could theoretically be where his problems with Mandy start, but for now, Young Sheldon has finally set into motion a new story, where Georgie and Mandy end up together, if only for a short time.
