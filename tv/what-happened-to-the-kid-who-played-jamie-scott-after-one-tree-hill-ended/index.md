## Literature Review
Eleven years have passed since One Tree Hill&#39;s last season, so fans may wonder what Jamie Scott&#39;s actor has been up to and what other roles he&#39;s done.




Joining the One Tree Hill cast in season 5, actor Jackson Brundage portrayed the role of Jamie Scott, but what happened after the show&#39;s end in 2012? Jamie Scott was the first child of Haley James Scott (Bethany Joy Lenz) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty), whom the couple had in their senior year of high school. Jamie&#39;s first appearance was at the end of season 4, with Brundage taking on the role in season 5 in 2008 after a four-year time jump on the show.




Over the course of the show, Jamie was quite close with his parents&#39; friends and his family, such as Brooke (Sophia Bush) and his uncle Lucas (Chad Michael Murray), his godparents. Jamie followed in his dad&#39;s footsteps and ended the series playing basketball and even beating Nathan&#39;s scoring record. As an adorable and intelligent young kid, Jamie was also often a shoulder to lean on for many of the adults in his life, like Dan, his grandfather, who confided in him. As a core part of the second half of the series, it&#39;s curious to know what Jamie&#39;s actor has been up to since the show wrapped.

Although One Tree Hill wasn&#39;t Brundage&#39;s first role, it was certainly his breakout role as he became a regular from season 5 until the show ended, totaling his appearances at 99 episodes. Before and during his time as Jamie Scott, Brundage played Charlie in the film Lime Salted Love, guest starred as Little Danny in the TV series Las Vegas and Tommy Smith on NCIS, and he voiced Pablo in Einstein Pals.

After One Tree Hill, Brundage had a few TV roles. He starred as a series regular in the comedy See Dad Run alongside Scott Baio (Happy Days). Additionally, he had a guest appearance on the comedy series Friends with Better Lives, which starred James Van Der Beek (Dawson&#39;s Creek). He was also the first to voice Foo on the animated Nickelodeon series Harvey Beaks before the role was taken over by Tom Robinson. Check out an overview of his roles following One Tree Hill below:

Brundage&#39;s decision to leave acting wasn&#39;t directly addressed at the time, but he revealed some insight a few years prior. In an interview with myFanbase in 2010, Brundage was asked if he wanted to continue acting when he&#39;s older and where he saw himself in 10 years. Brundage&#39;s answer revealed a desire to explore what else he was interested in, as well as to go to college. See his full answer below:


I might want to do something else, but if I [were] able to film in the future, I would really want to work with Jackie Chan because he is my all-time favorite actor. [...] I want to get through school, and I want to go to college, doing what college people do.





Brundage has had periods of activity on social media, such as his TikTok account where he interacts with fans of OTH. Brundage&#39;s Instagram also hints at his lifestyle with shots of him and friends playing football, him attending events with his fellow One Tree Hill alums, and him exploring various cities around the world. Interestingly, Murray shared in an interview that he still catches up with his One Tree Hill co-stars in a text group chat (via E!News). While this doesn&#39;t confirm Brundage is connected, it is promising that Jamie Scott could be his acting return should a One Tree Hill revival happen.
