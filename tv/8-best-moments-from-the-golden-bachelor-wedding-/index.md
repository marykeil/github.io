The Golden Bachelor wedding aired last night, and there were several memorable moments throughout the evening that will go down in Bachelor Nation history. After meeting and getting engaged on The Golden Bachelor season 1, Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist finally tied the knot after several months together. During their time on The Bachelor spin-off, Gerry and Theresa had an immediate connection. While Gerry did fall for other contestants, such as Leslie Fhima and Faith Martin, he ultimately knew his heart belonged to Theresa and proposed to her during the final rose ceremony.
During the After The Final Rose special, host Jesse Palmer revealed that Gerry and Theresa would be getting married live on ABC on January 4. The couple were ecstatic about the news and were excited about starting married life together. Both Gerry and Theresa lost their spouses in the last 10 years and were missing married life. While they still love their late spouses, it was time for them to move on and get their second chance at love and find someone to spend the rest of their lives with. Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding went off without a hitch, along with some incredible moments that Bachelor Nation fans will remember forever.

For their wedding, Gerry and Theresa exchanged moving vows. There wasn&#39;t a dry eye in the house after the couple expressed their love for one another. Theresa was the first to go, starting her vows by recounting her journey on the show, including the infamous flash mod from their first date. &#34;Right at that moment, I started believing that there could be something between us,&#34; Theresa began her speech, adding, &#34;I witnessed you being the most wonderful, kind, sensitive human being [...] I do Gerry, I do love you.&#34;
Theresa went on to talk about what they have to look forward to together and even ended her vows with some dark humor. &#34;Most of all, to have fun for the rest of the days that we have left on this earth, which could be another hour, &#34; she added. Gerry was tearing up the whole time, and clearly couldn&#39;t wait to say his vows. He began, &#34;I learned that you are the woman I can&#39;t live without.&#34; Gerry added that he believes he found a &#34;full partner&#34; in Theresa and is ready for whatever life adventures will be thrown at them next.

Leslie even gave a heart-wrenching speech that will go down as one of the most emotional post-breakup speeches in Bachelor history. However, during Leslie&#39;s arrival on the Gold Carpet, she admitted there are no hard feelings there anymore. &#34;At our age, we have to celebrate love,&#34; she said, adding that she was &#34;very good friends with Theresa&#34; and how they &#34;support[ed] each other throughout the whole time in the house and all the way through this journey.&#34;
