## Literature Review
The Traitors UK host Claudia Winkleman shared some of her concerns about the upcoming season, as well as the reason she wanted the show canceled.




The Traitors UK season 2 is one of the most highly anticipated premieres of 2024 after the first season had unprecedented success, which has left host Claudia Winkleman with some reservations. As the host of the murderous series, Claudia leads the group of players who have been divided in secret, with the majority of the players operating as the faithful and a handful of competitors designated traitors. The Traitors UK players complete missions to earn money for the prize pot, but as the traitors murder one of their own each night, the faithful work to identify who the traitors are in daily round table meetings with a player banished after each one.




In an interview with The Independent, Claudia shared that the unprecedented success of the series made her question if The Traitors UK season 2 should even exist. “The success of the first series literally winded us,” Claudia explained. “I said to lovely Studio Lambert and the BBC, ‘Let’s just leave it. This thing happened, this magical thing happened. Enough!’ The head of the BBC said she wanted to take my temperature. So we went again but I’m nervous and weird about it.” Claudia, who was likely joking about canceling the series, is happy to be returning to The Traitors UK.

While Claudia is excited for viewers to see the next iteration of The Traitors UK, she’s fearful that the series can’t possibly live up to the expectations viewers have for it. “What happened never happens. It was overwhelming for all of us,” Claudia explained, continuing, “I was amazed with the whole experience…It felt like some sort of magical dust and I just don’t want people’s expectations to be so high.” She explained that the first season was such a wonderful experience that coming back to The Traitors UK made her nervous, though she’s happy to have done so and is excited for viewers to see the outcome.


 

While Claudia has been joking about the idea of canceling the series because it was so good to begin with, it’s clear that she’s proud of what she and the cast and crew have accomplished. Claudia, who’s also a presenter for Strictly Come Dancing in the UK and won a BAFTA for her hosting skills on the series, has been massively successful for BBC. After rolling out with The Traitors US season 1, The Traitors UK became one of the three most popular new reality TV series of 2023. With viewers anticipating The Traitors UK season 2, many are hopeful it’ll be an even better showing than the first.




With The Traitors UK season 2 already making waves, host Claudia’s concerns should be melting away after the first episode of the season proved it would be a successful outing. Though Claudia plays a small role in the game, her facilitation is unmatched and she’s an incredibly necessary part of the game as it plays out in real-time. For the traitors and the faithful, The Traitors UK wouldn’t be the same without Claudia in the host position.
