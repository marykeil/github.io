## Literature Review
Doctor Jordan Wagner analyzes Homer’s doctor visit in The Simpsons, revealing that the animated sitcom gets one thing right about modern medicine.




According to emergency room doctor Jordan Wagner, The Simpsons&#39; depiction of one aspect of modern medicine is fairly accurate. First airing in 1989, The Simpsons currently stands as the longest-running animated sitcom of all time. The show follows the members of the titular family as they go about their daily lives in the fictional town of Springfield, with patriarch Homer, in one episode, taking a visit to Dr. Hibbert to treat his back pain.




Now, as The Simpsons season 35 continues to air, Dr. Wager shares another video to his Doctor ER YouTube channel, analyzing Homer&#39;s doctor&#39;s office scene from an earlier season.


 

After an x-ray of Homer&#39;s back reveals a severe case of scoliosis and gaps between the vertebrae, Dr. Hibbert claims that treating back issues is one area where modern medicine falls short. Dr. Wagner reveals that he mostly agrees with this assessment, voicing his support for a multifaceted approach to treatment, which can include chiropractors and acupuncture. Check out Dr. Wagner&#39;s comment about the scene below:


“That is true. I will say that we do our best trying to fix pain that people get in their back, but it is really difficult. You have a lot of nerves.





  


 Why The Simpsons Still Resonates Today 
          

As the longest-running animated show of all time, the series is clearly doing something right. With The Simpsons season 36 confirmed to be on the way, it seems like time still hasn&#39;t dulled the show&#39;s appeal. A big reason for the show&#39;s enduring popularity remains just how relatable it is. This goes far beyond Homer&#39;s visit to the doctor, however, with relatability baked into the show&#39;s premise.

The Simpsons takes place in Springfield, which is instantly recognizable as a fairly average American town. The titular family, as well, lives a familiar middle-class, suburban lifestyle. The show deals with familiar family, school, and workplace dynamics, and this all combines to make a show that has remained popular for over 30 years.




Of course, The Simpsons&#39; voice cast and writing are also crucial ingredients, with the voice performances for the show&#39;s main characters now recognizable even without the accompanying animation. The clever jokes and storylines, too, keep the show feeling as fresh as ever, with the series now renowned for its future predictions when it comes to everything from presidential campaigns, Super Bowl winners, and major controversies. The fact that a throwaway joke in The Simpsons about back pain is actually fairly spot on only further speaks to the show&#39;s quality.



The Simpsons season 35 is currently in the midst of a break, with episode 11 not scheduled to air until February 18, 2024
