## Literature Review
Newest 90 Day Fiancé couple Kalani Faagata and Dallas Nuez are getting serious about each other as they celebrate a new relationship milestone.




Kalani Faagata&#39;s boyfriend, Dallas Nuez, has yet to make his franchise debut, but the 90 Day: The Last Resort star has already crossed a major relationship milestone with him. Kalani is a 35-year-old woman from California who was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé season 6. She married Asuelu Pulaa, 28, while she was pregnant with their second child. She recently revealed that not only was Asuelu irresponsible, but he was also cheating on her throughout their marriage. Asuelu had given Kalani a &#34;hall pass,&#34; which was a chance to make things even. She met Dallas on social media and began a relationship with him.




Asuelu didn&#39;t know that Kalani was dating Dallas behind his back, but the couple recently revealed they&#39;ve been together for a year.

          

Kalani and Asuelu joined 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 to find a solution to their marriage issues, and Kalani decided it was best for them to get divorced. Now that Kalani is no longer with Asuelu, she has been openly showing off Dallas on Instagram. She posted a Polaroid-style selfie with Dallas captioned, &#34;You are the exception,&#34; with a big red heart on her Instagram Stories. Dallas reposted the photo by writing, &#34;You’re my everything. I appreciate everything you do for me and I love you with all of my fatu.”

With &#34;I love you&#34; being said, Dallas and Kalani&#39;s relationship seems to have gotten serious since she announced her divorce from Asuelu. There were rumors that Kalani has already met Dallas&#39; family and that they planned on moving in together. Kalani has been regularly sharing photos of herself and her sons Oliver and Kennedy with Dallas on her social media pages. However, she makes sure that the photos don&#39;t clearly show Dallas&#39; face. Kalani and Dallas met after Asuelu asked her to go and kiss someone else. Asuelu had cheated on Kalani yet again and contracted a yeast infection on his tongue. He didn&#39;t expect Kalani to really go and meet another man, but she surprised him.


 

Kalani was willing to leave Dallas for the sake of Asuelu and their kids. She even blocked his number when she was at the Florida resort to give Asuelu one more chance. Asuelu, however, kept betraying Kalani&#39;s trust. She caught him deleting some messages on his phone. Kalani unblocked Dallas and he flew to the resort. She spent the night with him without telling Asuelu. It helped her make up her mind and decide that being with Dallas was the best thing that would ever happen to her because of how well he treated her in their relationship.




However, Kalani could be headed for heartbreak because Dallas is her rebound and, generally, rebound relationships rarely work. Kalani is still being careful about not revealing too many details of her relationship with Dallas on social media. He has claimed he has no interest in joining the franchise, but Kalani is a major reality TV star and 90 Day: The Last Resort surely wasn&#39;t her last stint. Kalani and Dallas could star in a new spin-off soon to make their relationship sound more convincing to the naysayers.
