## Literature Review
OFMD&#39;s cancellation means that storylines including Stede and Ed&#39;s romance, Buttons&#39; transformation, and Frenchie&#39;s captaincy will never be finished.




The historically-inspired pirate comedy Our Flag Means Death was recently cancelled by HBO after two seasons. Following the adventures of the &#34;Gentleman Pirate&#34; Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) and his romance with Edward &#34;Ed&#34; Teach (Taika Waititi), a.k.a. Blackbeard, Our Flag Means Death&#39;s first two seasons were critically acclaimed and popular among audiences. Showrunner David Jenkins thanked fans for their support when he announced the show&#39;s cancellation via Instagram.
A representative from Max also thanked the Our Flag Means Death cast, crew, and fans in a statement (via Deadline). The reasons for Our Flag Means Death being cancelled are unconfirmed, but production challenges during season 2 may have contributed. While Our Flag Means Death season 2&#39;s ending brought some plot threads to an acceptable conclusion, fans will still be disappointed that certain storylines will not continue into a third season.
The first two seasons of Our Flag Means Death will reportedly remain available to stream on Max. 



 7  Mary Bonnet 
It is not clear if Stede ever meant to see his ex-wife or children again.
        

The initial premise of Our Flag Means Death is that aristocrat Stede Bonnet leaves his wife and children for a life of piracy. Stede&#39;s wife Mary (Claudia O&#39;Doherty) builds an enjoyable life for herself in his absence – delving into painting and falling in love with her instructor Doug (Tim Heidecker) – and is actually mad at Stede when he abruptly returns near the end of season 1. However, she and Stede amicably resolve things and are both happy that the other has found someone they truly love. Mary and Doug help Stede fake his death, so he may return to the Revenge and Ed.
Mary is an independent and headstrong woman, and it would have been interesting to see her appear again. Stede occasionally refers to Mary as his ex-wife in season 2, although he does not mention whether he thinks he will ever see her and the children again. Stede and Mary have a heartwarming relationship because they can support each other&#39;s happiness. A storyline about them remaining friends and him occasionally visiting could have been a good addition to the show.





 6  Zheng &amp; Oluwande 
Oluwande is just beginning a relationship with Zheng at the end of season 2.




Season 2 introduces historical Pirate Queen Zheng Yi Sao (Ruibo Qian), who shows interest in original Revenge crew member Oluwande (Samson Kayo). After being separated early in season 2, Zheng and Oluwande meet again in the Republic of Pirates and decide to begin a relationship. Oluwande even plans to join Zheng’s crew until her fleet is destroyed, and she joins the crew of the Revenge. Yet Zheng and Oluwande’s romance is just one that will not be further explored because of the show’s cancellation.
In season 2, Jim (Vico Ortiz) and Archie (Madeleine Sami) kiss a couple of times, but their relationship has not been given much focus. Lucius (Nathan Foad) and Black Pete (Matthew Maher) get married but remain aboard the Revenge after their wedding. Spanish Jackie (Leslie Jones) and the Swede (Nat Faxon) also get married and join the crew of the Revenge when everyone is forced to flee the Republic of Pirates. All in all, there are too many unresolved romantic subplots from Our Flag Means Death.

 5  Our Flag Means Death&#39;s Use Of History 
Fans wondered how history would play into Our Flag Means Death season 3.
        

Several historical pirates appear in Our Flag Means Death, and the show is known for cleverly incorporating history into the plot. Therefore, fans expected history to play a role in Our Flag Means Death season 3, even if certain events were never hinted at in the first two seasons. The real Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard were eventually killed for their crimes of piracy, and the show might have alluded to their fates. Additionally, real pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read appear in season 2, respectively played by Minnie Driver and Rachel House. Bonny and Read returning could have been another way to weave history into season 3.





 4  Frenchie Being Captain 
Frenchie becomes captain of the Revenge at the end of season 2.



Frenchie (Joel Fry) is seen giving orders to the crew in the season 2 finale; Jenkins confirmed (via tvinsider.com) that Frenchie is now captain, since Stede and Ed stayed on land to become innkeepers. Frenchie’s trials as the new captain would have been a great storyline for season 3. It also might have led to a complicated power dynamic aboard the Revenge.
If Stede and Ed had been forced to return to sea, would Stede have wanted command again (Ed appears to no longer be captain in season 2, deferring to Stede)? Zheng and Jackie are also aboard and are accustomed to giving orders as well. One too many captains could have been an amusing yet interesting conundrum.




 3  Getting Revenge On Ricky Banes 
The main characters intended to avenge Izzy&#39;s death.
        

Ed’s former first mate Izzy Hands (Con O&#39;Neill) is shot and killed by Ricky Banes (Erroll Shand) while the main cast flees British soldiers in the season 2 finale. Izzy reaches the Revenge with the rest of the crew before dying in Ed’s arms. After his funeral, Zheng proposes that they pursue Banes, avenging her own crew and Izzy. Fans will never see how the Revenge’s conflict with Banes will play out. Izzy himself may have even played a role in avenging his own death as a ghost, since Jenkins teased Izzy’s return (via X).

 15 Best Quotes From Our Flag Means Death Season 2 
HBO&#39;s Our Flag Means Death season 2 brings back the show&#39;s characteristic humor and sincerity, giving fans a new mix of funny and heartfelt quotes. 



 2  The Mystery Of Buttons&#39; &#34;Transformation&#34; 
Buttons transforms into a seagull but never transforms back.
        

Crew member Buttons (Ewen Bremner) allegedly turns into a seagull in season 2 and may have been seen resting on the marker of Izzy’s grave. Season 3 might have included Buttons suddenly (and hysterically) returning to aid the crew in their quest for Revenge. Given everyone&#39;s skepticism about his transformation, their reaction to his reappearance would only have been hilarious. Buttons was one of the funniest pirates of the Revenge, and fans would have doubtlessly enjoyed him returning for more entertaining interactions with the rest of the cast.





 1  Stede &amp; Ed Stede and Ed&#39;s story was not yet finished.


Stede and Ed’s story is not completely resolved at the end of season 2, despite them apparently retiring from piracy to become innkeepers. Jenkins suggested that the main couple&#39;s relationship would continue to evolve in season 3: “You say, ‘Well, are we going to do it better than the bad versions we’ve seen? Are we going to be able to be the best versions of ourselves for each other?’ And then there’s the amount of work you have to put in to make it work.”
Rhys Darby also argued (via Screen Rant) that Stede and Ed would have to return to piracy in season 3: &#34;I think, in the back of their minds, the characters must be thinking, &#39;This is not going to last,&#39; because the reality within their story is that they&#39;re pirates, they’re wanted men, and they&#39;re going to be hunted by the British.&#34; Yet this and many other Our Flag Means Death storylines will unfortunately never be seen by fans.
