## Literature Review
House has worked through a few teams during his tenure at Plainsboro, with several members making quite the match for the genius doctor.




House would struggle to engage its audience without the wider team that serves as a way for viewers to relate to the series, with every team member bringing something different to the table. The brilliant medical drama starring Hugh Laurie as Doctor Gregory House provides an insight into the brilliant mind of the doctor, but the team of doctors that work alongside him add depth to the show. House ran for eight seasons between 2004 and 2012, and in that time, the diagnostics team working under House changed several times.
When House initially alienates and pushes away his original team, he hosts a competitive series of challenges to find his next hires. This introduced many great characters who worked with House briefly, but very few were officially brought in to work on his team. One such character who was significant but never officially a part of House&#39;s team was Amber Volakis, who was the last person to be dropped from House&#39;s competition. While she went on to have a relationship with Wilson, she never worked as an official part of the team.









 








 9  Jessica Adams 
Played By Odette Annable
        

Jessica Adams was introduced in the final season of House, when House was in prison. She comes from a wealthy family, and spends her time working in medical roles that are below her abilities. She begins consulting with House at the prison until their cooperation leads to her getting fired. Thanks to her wealth, she begins working with House and his team unofficially and unpaid, until she is eventually hired. Adams was a highly effective doctor, and although she had disagreements with colleagues like Chi Park, she put patient needs and comfort first. If she had more time on the show, its likely she would appear higher on this ranking.





 8  Eric Foreman 
Played By Omar Epps


 







Eric Foreman is a part of House&#39;s team from the first episode, and by the end of the series, he has taken over the position of Dean of Medicine from Lisa Cuddy. Foreman is potentially the most like House with his stubborn nature, disregard for the opinions of others and his medical prowess. However, it is precisely because he has so much in common with House that makes him unlikable and unfeeling. And the arc he experiences in becoming Dean is self-serving rather than changing his character from worse to better.

House is one of the most brilliant shows on TV, but just like any other, it experienced highs and lows with some seasons better than others.









 7  Chris Taub 
Played By Peter Jacobson
        

Taub was recruited during House&#39;s competition in season 4. Having already led a successful career for years as a plastic surgeon, he is the oldest member to join House&#39;s team, but also one of the most knowledgable. While he initially joins the team simply to cover his expensive lifestyle, and continue hiding his multiple affairs from his wife. By the end of the series, Taub is a much better man who admits his flaws, forms a loving connection with his daughters and appears unburdened by the things that frustrated him when he first began working with House. He is level-headed, reasonable and a great doctor.





 6  Chi Park 
Played By Charlyne Yi
        

Chi Park also joined House&#39;s team during the last season of the show, having been transferred from the neurology department after an altercation with her boss. Park is exceptional, but what makes her truly stand out is her ability to avoid being manipulated by House. While House drives many of his team members to act in predictable ways due to their suppressing of their aggression and a hope to advance, Park is unpredictable. She also clearly knows her worth and value to House, so he struggles to threaten and belittle her. She has her flaws, but overall, she is a formidable character and a great contrast to House.





 5  Robert Chase 
Played By Jesse Spencer
        

Robert Chase was another member of House&#39;s original team with a gift for diagnosis, but early in the series, he appears to do all he can just to please House. As the series progressed, Chase developed a stronger personality to stand up to House and, as a result, he was fired. However, he continued to work for different departments at Plainsboro before finally returning to lead the diagnostic team after House fakes his own death. Chase arguably has the strongest arc of any member of House&#39;s team and grows from a pretty boy, yes man, to a strong, confident doctor capable of leading the team he was once fired from.





 4  Remy &#34;Thirteen&#34; Hadley 
Played By Olivia Wilde


 







Remy Hadley (Olivia Wilde) was more commonly referred to by the number she was assigned as an applicant for House&#39;s season 4 competition, &#34;Thirteen.&#34; Thirteen was incredibly private, as evidenced by her unwillingness to share her name for some time or any details about her own life outside the hospital. As a result of her diagnosis and family history of Huntington&#39;s disease, Thirteen is often reckless about her own safety, although she has an abundance of compassion and patience for patients. Thirteen grows throughout the series and overcomes fears and doubts in order to pursue doing what makes her happy in whatever time she has left.
            
 
 8 House M.D. Characters Who Could Have Carried Their Own Spinoffs 
House, M.D. ended in 2012 after eight successful seasons on Fox, and the cast bid farewell to their characters (but a handful shouldnâ€™t have).









 3  Martha M. Masters 
Played By Amber Tamblyn
        

Martha M. Masters may have had only a brief stint working in House&#39;s team to fill the absence of Thirteen during season 7, but she left a considerable impression. In several ways, Masters was the anti-House, favoring honesty above anything else. House tries desperately to persuade her to be dishonest and see the value in lying, but time and again, she proves that she can push forward and succeed by being honest instead. She is highly gifted and the only team member to be hired while still a student, but ultimately, due to the intense pressures and House&#39;s questionable methods, she decides to quit.





 2  Allison Cameron 
Played By Jennifer Morrison
        

Allison Cameron was one of the original diagnostic team members, and she was largely optimistic, kind, compassionate and genuine. When House tried to change and shape Cameron into a more cynical, and thus, by his estimation, more effective doctor, she resisted. She already had some hangups around drug addicts and others who she deemed untrustworthy, but for the most part, Cameron was a ray of hope among her darker companions. Cameron was also one of the few doctors who would fully commit to being vulnerable in love, and she married Chase as a result, although that ended in divorce when Chase began acting more like House.





 1  Lawrence Kutner 
Played By Kal Penn


 







Lawrence Kutner was another shining ray in a team of cynical and dishonest people. He was incredibly intelligent, quickly proving how invaluable his insights were in House season 4 and earning a place on the team. He was witty and got along well with others in the hospital, which is why his suicide during season 5 came as a total shock. His death impacted the whole team, especially House, who struggled to understand the motivations. Kutner proved his abilities, often beating the team to a diagnosis, and his character possessed the most potential. Even in death, Kutner was the catalyst for a major change in House.
