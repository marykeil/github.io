# Below Deck Meds Kyle Viljoen Accused Of Faking Migraine During Difficult Charter


## SUMMARY 



  Fans speculate that Kyle may have faked his medical emergency to avoid work and escape responsibilities on Below Deck Mediterranean.   Some viewers believe Kyle has a history of playing sick when he knows he won&#39;t be fired, pointing to a previous season where he exaggerated his injury.   Kyle&#39;s behavior, including not sharing tip money and causing tension among the crew, has caused fans and co-stars to lose trust in him.

## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean viewers are certain that Second Stew Kyle Viljoen did not have a &#34;bulging&#34; head on episode 13 and that he was faking it.




Kyle Viljoen&#39;s medical emergency on Below Deck Mediterranean could be something he concocted to escape his responsibilities on season 8, according to the reality TV show&#39;s fans. South African man Kyle has been making waves for his back-to-back controversies in the Bravo show. Kyle, who debuted in season 7 twisted his ankle badly during episode 17 by falling down the stairs. Kyle was seen sleeping in his cabin while the other swamped crew members worked without breaks. A similar situation took place during episode 13 of season 8 where Kyle complained of a migraine. Tumi Mhlongo called Kyle going down as her &#34;worst nightmare.&#34;




Kyle not being in action was &#34;difficult,&#34; as Captain Sandy Yawn pointed out because he actually knew the guests who had previously been featured in the Below Deck franchise. However, some fans such as X (Formerly Twitter) user @realityTVbliss wrote, &#34;Kyle waits for the opportunity to play sick. He did it last season. The moment he knows he won’t be fired he plays sick.&#34; Meanwhile, @here_for_bravo added, &#34;I just can’t help but be skeptical that Kyle has a migraine because he remembers how annoying the guests are. Like he had a hurt ankle last season.&#34; Kyle was similarly slammed last season for being dramatic about his injury.

 Kyle Viljoen’s Below Deck Med Drama Explained 
          

Crew members such as Natalya Scudder had been working continuously for 20 years, while Kyle did not even agree to fold the laundry but happily accepted the tip money. Fans expected Kyle to have shared the tip money between Natasha Webb and Natalya, which he didn&#39;t. This time around, viewers like @LainieLaHaye were certain that Kyle was &#34;99.9999999% faking that migraine which is just a headache&#34; to get out of work and make things difficult for Tumi. The guests were looking forward to meeting Kyle and even exclaimed, &#34;Oh no&#34; when informed he was feeling ill at the moment.





 

When Captain Sandy gave the Second Stew a visit to ask if he was, &#34;sick, sick,&#34; he replied, &#34;It&#39;s just my head that&#39;s bulging.&#34; Sandy asked Kyle to go see a doctor because what he was going through wasn&#39;t &#34;normal.&#34; She spoke to Nurse Terry about getting Kyle to a doctor using lead deckhand Lara Du Preez&#39;s help. Kyle insisted what he had wasn&#39;t a &#34;hangover&#34; as he headed to the hospital. Tumi admitted they were &#34;pretty much scr**ed*&#34; without Kyle there to add to the guest experience. Kyle returned to the charter the next day. He said the tests conducted on him confirmed that he had a migraine and was dealing with &#34;exhaustion, dehydration,&#34;

Kyle has undoubtedly been the biggest drama queen of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, with him pitting Tumi and his former bestie Natalya against each other, pushing Natalya to quit the charter season. Kyle came close to being fired himself. Captain Sandy gave him an ultimatum instead. Kyle&#39;s notorious personality is what had fans questioning if he really suffered the migraine or was simply exaggerating things. Kyle has crossed the line and angered his co-stars and viewers alike in season 8, making them lose their trust in the Springs native.






Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
