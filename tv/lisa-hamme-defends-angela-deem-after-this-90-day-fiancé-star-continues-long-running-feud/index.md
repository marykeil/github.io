## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Lisa Hamme surfaces to support her best friend Angela Deem as the two of them engage in an online fight with a co-star.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Lisa &#34;Babygirl&#34; Hamme is supporting Angela Deem amid the latter&#39;s ongoing feud with a cast member from the franchise. Angela was on shows such as Maury and Trisha before making her reality TV debut on 90 Day Fiancé with Michael Ilesanmi. Angela&#39;s loud and obnoxious personality made her famous instantly, even though it also earned her a lot of criticism. Angela was brutal towards her husband Michael. She treated him badly while also getting into verbal fights with 90 Day Fiancé co-stars on social media and during the reunions. However, Angela has also surprisingly made some friends, one of whom is Lisa.




Lisa shared a video defending her bestie Angela in her Instagram Stories.

          

Both of them threw shade at Lisa&#39;s ex-husband Usman Umar, aka Sojaboy. The video showed Angela using Usman&#39;s photo as a backdrop while she lip-synced to the song &#34;Crazy&#34; by Gnarls Barkley. Angela sang the lyrics, &#34;Who do you think you are? Ha ha ha, bless your soul. You really think you&#39;re in control.&#34; Lisa added her own text over Angela&#39;s clip and wrote, &#34;I see my X is trying to provoke the Queen.&#34; Lisa wrote that Usman could never be half the man Angela&#39;s husband is. &#34;You can take that to the bank,&#34; she declared.

 Usman Umar Warns Angela Deem: &#34;Don&#39;t Try Me&#34; 
          

Usman had a tale of his own to tell his followers. He shared an Instagram Story that read, &#34;You ain&#39;t s*** Angee.&#34; He wrote that no matter how broke he is, he will still be wealthier than Angela&#39;s &#34;generation&#34; before saying, &#34;Lol,&#34; and tagging Angela&#39;s Instagram account. &#34;Don&#39;t try ME Bcus [I] am bitter,&#34; Usman wrote. He told Angela that he was not Michael, that he was Usman. &#34;There is different [sic] between Hausa man and Yoruba man,&#34; Usman explained. It appears Angela and Usman are feuding again for some unknown reason, and it&#39;s not the first time that this has happened.


 




90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Angela and Usman first got into a fight during an episode of 90 Day: Bares All in 2021. Usman had said, &#34;I&#39;ve been doing well. My life is good right now,&#34; to host Shaun Robinson, and Angela, who was also a guest on the show, claimed that it had always been Usman&#39;s plan to make himself &#34;well.&#34; Angela accused him of being a scammer who gave Nigerians a bad name. Usman asked her to prove he was a scammer. Angela claimed it was because of people like Usman that Michael&#39;s U.S. visa was getting delayed. &#34;You sound like s*** when you sing. You&#39;re out of tune,&#34; she added.

The two started fighting again when Michael made an Instagram account against Angela&#39;s wishes and posed for a photo with Usman. Back then, it was Usman who accused Angela of scamming Michael. He said Angela used Michael&#39;s money to build herself a new house. The pair had a showdown during the 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7 Tell All. Angela came to the set and noticed Usman on the screen. She called him a &#34;stupid b****,&#34; while he called her a &#34;pig&#34; before she stormed off. It&#39;ll be a miracle if the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days stars ever manage to make amends.
