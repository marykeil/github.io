Undead Unluck episode #13 received a surprise early release, and it ended up being one of the saddest episodes of the series to date, so fans are wondering how episode #14 will pick up the pieces and move forward the anime’s latest arc.

 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode #13? 
          

As the title would imply, Undead Unluck episode #13, “Tatiana”, was focused on exploring Tatiana’s character. As Tatiana fought the Negator Hunters Creed and Feng, the show flashbacked to before the Spoil arc when Tatiana challenged Andy to a fight to avenge Gina. Tatiana nearly lost control of her armor, thus threatening to destroy Undead Unluck&#39;s entire Union with her Negator ability, but Fuuko calmed Tatiana down by both taking responsibility for Gina’s death and saying that she wanted to be friends with Tatiana, and remembering their friendship motivated Tatiana to shed her armor and begin to activate her Negator ability.

The second half of the episode detailed Tatiana’s past, starting with how she accidentally killed her parents with her Negator ability and was kidnapped by the mafia to be sold at auction. Billy rescued her and assured her that she would one day want to use her power to protect someone, and in the present, Tatiana decided to use it to protect Fuuko. As such, Tatiana finally activated the full force of her Negator ability, Untouchable, and not only repelled Creed and Feng, but allowed Andy, Fuuko, and Chikara to find Rip and Latla by destroying the boat and sending all of them into the air.






 Undead Unluck Brings Its Latest Story Into Its Final Act 
          

While Undead Unluck episode #14 was focused largely on fleshing out Tatiana’s character, it still managed to progress the current arc into a clear climax. With the fight against Rip and Latla about to restart and Fuuko only having minutes to spare before she dies, the next episode is likely going to close out their fight and the arc, as a whole, and if previous episodes are anything to go on, then it’s sure to be conveyed in as bombastic a fashion as possible. There’s plenty of setup for a great conclusion to this arc, and with any luck, Undead Unluck episode #14 will deliver on all of that.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode #14 when it releases on January 12.
