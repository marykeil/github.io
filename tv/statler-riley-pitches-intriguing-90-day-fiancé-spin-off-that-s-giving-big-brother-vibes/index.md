# Statler Riley Pitches Intriguing 90 Day Fiancé Spin-Off That s Giving Big Brother Vibes


## SUMMARY 



  Statler Riley proposes a new 90 Day Fiancé spin-off idea where former cast members live in a house and one person is voted off every week.   Fans have mixed reactions to the idea, with some liking the concept of more drama and viewer control, while others believe the franchise should focus on real couples and genuine relationships.   While Statler&#39;s idea may be creative and dramatic, it lacks originality and doesn&#39;t align with the core identity of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s appeal lies in watching couples overcome obstacles and find happiness.

## Literature Review

Statler Riley has come up with an interesting 90 Day Fiancé spin-off idea. While her concept is creative, Redditors think her suggestion is terrible.




Statler Riley shared a creative 90 Day Fiancé spin-off idea, but fans are very wary of her suggestion. The 33-year-old Texas native debuted on the TLC series in 2023. She joined 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 6 and pursued her British partner, Dempsey Wilkinson. Initially, Statler received criticism for her shady sexual history and was compared to former 90 Day Fiancé star Steven Johnston. However, she eventually became a fan-favorite by showing real concern for Dempsey’s emotions and respecting her goals. The two ladies stayed in a relationship as the season ended. Statler and Dempsey are still together and seem stronger than ever.




Statler has been very active on social media in recent months. She likes to post fresh content for fans and keep them entertained. Recently, the American woman posted a few Instagram Stories sharing a cool idea for a 90 Day Fiancé spin-off.


 

She took to her Instagram and wrote (as shared by Happylife97 on Reddit), “Idea- a show where 90 Day alum live in a house for a summer w/ one being voted off every week &amp; replaced by somebody new.” Statler added that her spin-off idea would be full of drinks and drama. She shared that viewers would get complete control over the show’s outcome and get a chance to vote.

 Fans Don&#39;t Want A Big Brother Version Of 90 Day Fiancé 
          

Some fans liked Statler’s idea and asked her how to make it a reality. She told them to talk about it on the official “90 Day account pages,” as they listen to the viewers. Still, most fans in the Reddit thread despised the approach and felt a 90 Day Fiancé spin-off wouldn’t be the same if it were like another show. They shared that Statler’s idea was simply terrible. A Redditor wrote, “This is the opposite way the show needs to go,” adding that the franchise needs real couples, not even more drama. Another Redditor commented, &#34;Um- not an original idea. It’s called Big Brother.&#34; Someone even joked about Statler’s financial condition and wrote, “So, she needs a place to stay for the summer?”




It’s great that Statler is trying to engage with her followers. Most reality TV stars struggle to communicate with their fans or build meaningful relationships with them. However, the 90 Day Fiancé alum has maintained a decent connection with the people who care for opinions. Statler’s spin-off idea for the 90 Day Fiancé franchise is pretty creative. It ensures maximum drama and focuses on the most notorious cast members like Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo. If TLC wants to cash in on this idea, it certainly can.

Statler’s idea is good from the drama perspective. However, it lacks originality and seems like a rehash of the reality TV series that faded into obscurity years ago. Statler’s idea is drama-centric and doesn’t even respect the franchise’s identity. It sounds like a cheap knock-off more suitable for being a YouTube miniseries than a full-fledged show that airs on TLC. 90 Day Fiancé is all about couples and their marriages. The show is dramatic and fun to watch because it’s grounded in reality. People like to watch the 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs because they like seeing people overcome the odds and have a happily ever after.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
