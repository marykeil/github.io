<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Traitors UK season 2 left off on a major cliffhanger, leaving many to wonder who&rsquo;s the most likely player to get banished from the series.</p>
<p>The Traitors UK season 2 has started its season strong, leaving many wondering, after just three episodes, who is most likely to stay and who is most likely to get banished. While The Traitors UK season 2 has only aired its first three episodes, the series is already pulling in viewers who can’t stay away from the addictive nature of the game. Fueled by deception, The Traitors UK pushes its cast to work together while being tremendously suspicious of one another as the Faithful contestants work to figure out who among them is a Traitor. With the Traitor team larger than before and the stakes high, the game has been intense.
Though the game is only getting started, many of the Faithful contestants already have some steadfast guesses on who the Traitors are and what they’re doing. The Faithful, who have already lost three players to murder and banishment, have been working as hard as possible to find out who in The Traitors UK season 2 cast are Traitors. With so little information to go off of in the first days of the competition, things haven’t been easy. After a massive cliffhanger leaving off the most recent episode, who does it appear will survive on The Traitors UK?</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>19  Harry Clark
Traitor</p>
<p>As a Traitor, Harry Clark has been playing the game in the most interesting way possible. Harry may be deceptively working against the Faithful, but he’s doing an incredible job of blending in as one of the masses. Harry’s currently the least likely option to get banished at the round table because rather than being on anyone’s radar, he’s helping to form the opinions of others in the game and keeping himself out of the chatter. Though he’s only 22 years old, the British Army Engineer has been able to deceive a majority of the cast in just a few days.</p>
<p>18  Evie Morrison
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>29-year-old Veterinary Nurse Evie hasn’t been on much of anyone’s radar yet in the game, which so early on is a great thing. While she’s operating as a Faithful, she’s put in the work to ensure that she appears to be a team player. Evie may not be as physically adept as some of the other Faithful, but she’s using her skills to the best of her abilities, and, from what The Traitors UK season 2 episodes have shown, she doesn’t appear to be ringing alarm bells for anyone in the game.</p>
<p>17  Charlie Bees
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Although she hasn’t been featured heavily on The Traitors UK season 2, Charlie Bees has been working to play her role as Faithful to the best of her ability. Charlie’s time on The Traitors has mostly been about completing the missions and building her relationships, but viewers haven’t gotten too much of a look at the Faithful in action. It’s unlikely that after such a minor edit, she would be banished from the game any time soon.</p>
<p>16  Miles Asteri
Traitor</p>
<p>Although Miles Asteri wasn’t keen on being a Traitor during his The Traitors UK season 2 pre-interviews, he’s taken to the role quite well in the first several episodes of the series. While Miles may have felt he’d be a better faithful, his time as a traitor has been an interesting look at switching up a game plan in real time. For Miles, the threat level surrounding him has been low since the beginning, meaning it’s highly unlikely that he’d be facing banishment at the Round Table any time soon. Overall, Miles may be playing one of the best strategic games in the series.</p>
<p>Every Change To The Traitors UK Season 2 Format, Explained
The Traitors UK season 2 premiere left viewers noticing some large changes to the format of the game, which created even more interesting dynamics.</p>
<p>15  Tracey Griffin
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Tracey Griffin’s time on The Traitors UK season 2 has been marked by difficulty, as the people she chose to align with early in the game have been either murdered or banished in the first few episodes. Tracey shared during the initial episodes of the season that she’s Clairvoyant, meaning she has an intense connection with the spirit world. While it doesn’t appear that the spirits have pushed Tracey in the wrong direction yet, it’s possible, in the coming episodes, viewers could see her make some missteps after being guided by her clairvoyance. At this point, Tracey has done very little to make herself appear threatening in the game.</p>
<p>14  Zack Davies
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Although Zack Davies made a few comments that rubbed people the wrong way on The Traitors UK season 2, it’s unlikely he’d be banished from the game for them. While Zack was one of the first people to pick up on the potential of Diane Carson being someone’s mother on the series, he’s also made comments that have pushed Charlotte Chilton to be suspicious of his actions overall. Zack, who appears to be one of the most intelligent cast members in the series, has been playing the game strategically and needs to ensure he can regroup to move forward without a target on his back.</p>
<p>13  Paul Gorton
Traitor</p>
<p>Paul Gorton, who came onto The Traitors UK season 2 hopeful that he’d be playing as a Traitor in the game, got his wish and has been playing an incredible Traitor game throughout the first several episodes. While Paul shared that he’s perfectly fine lying to his fellow The Traitors UK season 2 cast members and manipulating them when he needs to, he’s been working hard to make sure his true nature stays under wraps. While Paul did get a vote at the round table discussion, the majority of the cast will likely continue to believe he’s Faithful if he continues to play the game like one.</p>
<p>12  Charlotte Chilton
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>As a faithful, Charlotte hasn’t been featured on The Traitors UK season 2 heavily just yet. She shared in her pre-interviews for the series that she felt she would be better suited as a Faithful, and so far, she’s done well making relationships and working to figure out who the Traitors are. As one of the only people who seemed suspicious of Zack, Charlotte may be on the wrong trail for the moment, but she’s working to help the group, which won’t go unnoticed and will likely keep her safe from banishment.</p>
<p>Where Is The Traitors UK Filmed &amp; What Is The Castle Called?
The beautiful filming location of The Traitors UK contributed to the show’s success, and the castle has been retained for the second season.</p>
<p>11  Andrew Jenkins
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Andrew Jenkins was one of the choices the Traitors team was considering for their final recruit, but ultimately, they chose to leave Andrew as a Faithful who could potentially look suspicious for them later in the game. Andrew, who felt he would be a great traitor during his pre-interviews, isn’t a likely candidate for banishment any time soon with the way he’s been playing the game. In working hard for the team, Andrew has made himself look as faithful as possible while putting the heat on other players.</p>
<p>10  Jonny Holloway
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Although Jonny Holloway hasn’t been featured much in The Traitors UK season 2, he’s been playing the game as faithfully as possible. Jonny has helped the rest of the Faithful in their missions thus far, making himself an asset while ensuring he doesn’t appear to be one of the Traitors. Jonny isn’t a likely candidate for banishment, but he needs to continue to work on his relationships in order to ensure he doesn’t find a target on his back for keeping quiet and to himself.</p>
<p>9  Jaz Singh
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>While Jaz Singh has had a few moments that have developed a bit of mistrust in the game, his time on The Traitors UK season 2 has been fairly milquetoast thus far. He doesn’t appear to be someone who would be up for banishment, though there are a few Faithful contestants who have suspected he could be a Traitor among them. Jaz, who shared he’d be happy with either role in his pre-interview, has been doing his best to prove that he’s faithful without casting too much doubt on anyone in the game.</p>
<p>8  Mollie Pearce
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Mollie Pearce pictured herself as Faithful during her pre-interviews for the season, and she’s been working hard to ensure that she’s showing she’s faithful throughout her time in the game. While Mollie hasn’t been particularly outspoken, she’s done well in the missions and worked hard to build relationships that will keep her safe in the game. Mollie doesn’t seem like a Faithful who will be up for banishment, but even if she did get a vote, it probably wouldn’t result in a domino effect.</p>
<p>The Traitors US Is Better Than The Traitors UK (The American Version&rsquo;s More Exciting)
The Traitors US &amp; The Traitors UK run simultaneously throughout their seasons, but the shows are somewhat different and one is better than the other.</p>
<p>7  Jasmine Boatswain
Faithful</p>
<p>As one of the Faithful, Jasmine Boatswain has been quiet and observant throughout her time on The Traitors UK season 2 thus far. While for some, that may be cause for concern, Jasmine seems to have a handle on the rest of the cast in a way that’s kept her off the radar for banishment. Working quickly to build her relationships and figure out who she believes the Traitors are, Jasmine has made herself one of the more obvious Faithful, which could put her in danger later in the game.</p>
<p>6  Meg Corrick
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Although Meg Corrick has been thrown around as someone who could be banished soon, she’s likely safe from banishment for the foreseeable future. Meg, a 22-year-old Illustrator, may have a deceptive front that has confused some of her fellow The Traitors UK season 2 cast members, but she’s doing her best to demonstrate that she’s Faithful. Working hard in missions and keeping close ties in the game, Meg seems like she will be safe for the upcoming banishment.</p>
<p>5  Ross Carson
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Ross Carson came into The Traitors UK season 2 with a massive secret as his mother, Diane Carson, was playing the game with him in secret. While Ross and Diane’s secret hasn’t come out yet, the suspicion of Diane has bled over to Ross in some ways. As someone who’s carrying a secret and has had a few accusations thrown at him throughout the game, Ross shouldn’t be entirely worried about banishment but should work hard to try and push through the noise to make himself appear more like the Faithful he is.</p>
<p>4  Anthony Mathurin
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>As one of the most suspicious people in The Traitors UK season 2 cast, Anthony Mathurin was hoping he would become a Traitor in the first moments of the series. Though he’s been playing the game as Faithful, Anthony’s behavior has some of his fellow faithful suspicious of his motives in the game, and he hasn’t been doing much to break the buzz surrounding him. While Anthony may not be banished immediately, he’s definitely someone who needs to stay vigilant for upcoming banishments.</p>
<p>3  Diane Carson
Faithful</p>
<p>After several episodes of Diane’s name being thrown around by both the Traitors as a potential recruit or victim as well as the Faithful as a potential traitor, Diane’s game on The Traitors UK season 2 is in trouble. Though she’s working as diligently as possible to be a helpful Faithful, some of Diane’s reactions have rubbed the rest of the cast the wrong way, and her targeting of Anthony has made her look somewhat suspicious. It’s possible Diane could be the one banished in the upcoming episode of The Traitors UK season 2, and if she isn’t, she has a ton of work to do to rehabilitate her image.</p>
<p>2  Brian Davidson
Faithful
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Although Brian Davidson is Faithful, he had a difficult time in the most recent round table that could lead to his banishment from the game. After having a public moment of panic in front of the cast during the round table, Brian was more suspicious of the Faithful than ever. While it was clear to the audience that Brian was simply feeling some extreme emotions in a tense moment, the Faithful took his panic as a sign that he was one of the Traitors who was about to be caught in a lie. Brian is on thin ice, and if he isn’t banished, he’ll need to regroup quickly.</p>
<p>1  Ash Bibi
Traitor
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Though it’s early in the game, Ash Bibi may be the first Traitor to be banished from the game. While Ash still has a chance to escape banishment, the fact that she has several votes against her and could wind up in a chance decision against Brian doesn’t bode well for her. Despite trying to be deceptive, Ash has given more evidence to the idea that she’s a Traitor than the idea that she’s Faithful, which has made it difficult for anyone to try to defend her. Ash may wind up being the first The Traitors UK season 2 Traitor to be uncovered.</p>
<p>The Traitors (UK)
Based on the Dutch television series De Verraders, The Traitors is a reality competition series that features contestants competing for a prize set against the backdrop of a mystery. To win, participants must take on challenges while trying to uncover who among them are in a separate group of &ldquo;Traitors&rdquo; trying to sabotage their efforts. </p>
