## Literature Review
Former 90 Day Fiancé cast member Jesse Meester is shocking viewers by announcing that he is having a baby boy with his mystery new girlfriend.




Former 90 Day: The Single Life star Jesse Meester is shocking fans by revealing that he&#39;s having a baby with his new girlfriend, who&#39;s not Jeniffer Tarazona. Jesse is a 30-year-old from Amsterdam who was dating Darcey Silva in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1. Darcey was a mom of two who left her life in America behind to go meet her young boyfriend Jesse in person. Darcey longed for affection, but Jesse was controlling, had anger issues, and belittled her. After their breakup, Jesse revealed that he was dating Jeniffer Tarazona with whom he featured in the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off.




90 Day Fiancé couple Jeniffer and Jesse split in September 2022, however, fans seem to have believed that they were still together, as revealed in the comments section of a @90daythemelanatedway post.


 

It could have been because Jesse didn’t officially announce he was dating someone new, and is now having a baby with his new partner. The Instagram page mentioned, “CONGRATULATIONS to Papa Jesse &amp; Mama Marian who celebrated birthdays, the holidays and are expecting a baby boy in 2024!!!!” in the caption. Shocked fans commented things such as, “WAAAAAAAAAIT WTF what happened to Jennifer???” and &#34;I don’t recall you posting that he had a new gf?&#34;

 Jesse Meester&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Journey Explained 
          

90 Day Fiancé fans admitted that they had “missed a few chapters” and still thought that Jesse was with Tim Malcolm’s ex-girlfriend. Some fans were not aware that Jesse even had a new girlfriend. Jesse did not even tag his new girlfriend in his post, so he may have wished to keep her identity hidden. However, it appears her name is Marian Quesada and she works at Jesse’s company called Meester Real Estate as a luxury real estate agent and is the founder and CEO of DaleSpain, which serves the luxury real estate market in Marbella, Spain.

Jesse seemed to have wanted to keep his new relationship away from reality TV but decided against it when he found out he was going to become a father. It is Jeniffer who had fueled rumors of her romance with Jesse when she started posting about him on her Instagram in June 2021. The couple soon appeared in 90 Day: The Single Life and revealed they had connected via IG DMs. Jeniffer had messaged Jesse first, and he had seen her message after a year for the first time. Meanwhile, Tim was seen betting that Jesse and Jeniffer’s romance wasn’t meant to be long-term.




Tim was right since even though the couple was talking about having a baby together, Jesse sparked split rumors with Jeniffer in September 2022 by posting an emotional TikTok. A week later, a rep for Jeniffer confirmed the couple were separated and had to distance themselves temporarily to focus on their projects and work. Jesse and Jeniffer had used their joint Instagram account to share a heartwarming tribute to their relationship soon enough. It is not known whether Jesse will document his new relationship on 90 Day: The Single Life or another spin-off. However, fans are wishing Jesse a fantastic new life together with Marian.
