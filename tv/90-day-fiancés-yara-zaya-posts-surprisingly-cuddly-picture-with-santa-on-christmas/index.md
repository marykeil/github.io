## Literature Review
Yara Zaya from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise has again become the talk of the town due to her cozy photo with Santa in her latest Instagram post.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Yara Zaya baffled her followers by sharing a Christmas-special photo on Instagram. The 28-year-old Ukrainian woman is one of the most popular stars in the reality TV franchise. She’s known for her relationship with Jovi Dufren and their recent journey on 90 Day: The Last Resort. Yara and Jovi appeared on the spin-off as a relatively healthy pair. However, their relationship worsened when Yara revealed she took birth control pills without telling Jovi. As expected, Jovi wasn’t too happy about it and sought comfort in alcohol and strippers. He almost wrecked his marriage, but Yara saved it by forgiving him.




Recently, Yara posted a cute photo album on Instagram, showing how she celebrated Christmas. She wore a red designer dress, highlighting her curves and makeup. One of the pictures showed Yara sitting on Santa’s lap like a baby. She embraced the old man and didn’t mind getting cozy with him for the photo.


 

Yara wrote, “Merry Christmas,” wishing 90 Day Fiancé fans the best. As expected, people returned her wish with sweet comments, telling her she gave Santa the best Christmas gift of the year. Someone even wrote, “Santa getting a little handsy,” highlighting how Santa grabbed Yara in the picture.

Yara also baffled her followers with her makeup in the picture. She looked remarkable but very different from her usual self, making some social media users wonder if she had undergone makeover surgery. An Instagram user asked, “why did you get so much work done on your face,” adding that a gorgeous woman like Yara shouldn’t do it. Another user commented, “omg Yara are you becoming another Darcey and Stacey?” Yara didn’t let unaware people spread rumors. She responded to the concerns and revealed it was only cosmetics and nothing else. She said, “I hade noting done, omg people,” adding that she knew how to do makeup.

While people shouldn’t be telling Yara not to have cosmetic procedures, it’s understandable why they do so. Fans have watched the Ukrainian reality star over the last few years and relate to her struggles. They know she has felt insecure due to Jovi’s additions to strippers. However, fans also know Yara is among the most beautiful women ever appearing in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. They don’t want her to change her face because she’s perfect the way she is. Yara’s loyal fans simply want the best for her and don’t want her to lose her natural beauty because of her insecurities.




Fortunately, Yara’s response and swift reaction to rumors show she’s not as insecure as people think. The mom of one is more confident in her appearance than ever, and it shows from her countless bikini pictures and modeling photoshoots. She also openly discusses her weight gain and inspires people with her fitness routine. Yara knows her style and has a modern sense of fashion. She likes experimenting with outfits, colors, and makeup to pull off new looks in every other post. Clearly, the 90 Day Fiancé alum has overcome her insecurities and embraced body positivity.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
