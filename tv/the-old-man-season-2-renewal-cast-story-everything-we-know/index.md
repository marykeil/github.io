# The Old Man Season 2 Renewal, Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know


## SUMMARY 



  The Old Man Season 2 was delayed due to the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike.   The first season of The Old Man was highly acclaimed and received multiple award nominations.   The second season is expected to continue exploring the main characters&#39; storylines and raise the stakes.

## Literature Review
Jeff Bridges (and his Rottweilers) are not done yet, as the successful FX series returns for a second season. But what new will The Old Man offer?




Jeff Bridges reminded viewers why he&#39;s a renowned and distinguished talent in FX&#39;s thriller series The Old Man, a role that the Academy Award winner will reprise when the show returns for The Old Man season 2. Also starring John Lithgow, The Old Man centers around Bridges&#39;s ex-CIA operative, Dan Chase, who is forced out of retirement when an old foe returns. The cat-and-mouse game draws in several other characters, such as Lithgow&#39;s FBI Assistant Director Harold Harper, who was also once Dan&#39;s military colleague during the Soviet-Afghanistan War.




While its debut season played around with familiar CIA-centric thriller tropes, Bridges and Lithgow&#39;s performances as the main characters of The Old Man, along with Jonathan E Steinberg and Robert Levine&#39;s gripping writing ensured that the show became one of FX&#39;s most-watched original series. The show even managed to bag some major awards recognition with Bridges and Lithgow earning nominations for Best Actor in a Drama and Best Supporting Actor, respectively, at the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, and SAG Awards â€” so it&#39;s little surprise that The Old Man season 2 is inbound.

 The Old Man Season 2: Latest News 
          

The latest The Old Man season 2 news is disappointing but expected. As the Writers Guild of America strike affected countless movies and shows, The Old Man season 2 was also shut down, and filming was delayed (via Deadline). Production for The Old Man season 2 began as there had already been five scripts completed before the strike forced a stop to the writing. Even though the Hollywood strikes have since been resolved, there have been no further updates regarding the production of The Old Man season 2. 






The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.






 The Old Man Season 2 Confirmed 
          

The Old Man premiered its first two episodes on June 16, 2022. Right after the third episode, on June 27, FX announced the show&#39;s renewal for a second season. This seems obvious given the burning questions that The Old Man fans had after the season 1 finale. It is also an understandable commercial choice given how The Old Man was the most-watched primetime scripted series to premiere on television since 2020. 



 The Old Man Season 2 Cast 
          




While no major additions to the cast have been announced, most of the first season&#39;s stars will be returning for The Old Man season 2. Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow will obviously be back given the ending shot in the season finale that finds the former partners reuniting in a car. With The Old Man making for one of Alia Shawkat&#39;s best roles, the actress isn&#39;t done with her character, Angela Adams, as viewers will now be briefed on the aftermath of her kidnapping. 

Other expected returns include: 

 Actor  The Old Man Role   Amy Brenneman  Zoe McDonald   Navid Negahban  Hamzad   Pej Vahdat  Young Hamzad   Bill Heck  Young Dan   Christopher Redman  Young Harold

 The Old Man Season 2 Story Details 
          

With both Dan and Harold back in action, The Old Man season 2 story will definitely raise the stakes. Alia Shawkat&#39;s Angela is still abducted, so rescuing her might be one of the main missions in season 2. Unlike the audience, Angela still doesn&#39;t know that Hamzad is her father, so the big reveal for the character is also pending. 

It is also important to note that The Old Man is based on the 2017 novel by Thomas Perry. While retaining the general premise, The Old Man season 1 took a new narrative route. Perry&#39;s protagonist is being chased by a ruthless warlord and the American government as he steals $20 million from him. But the monetary angle is replaced in the show with a more humanistic element: Hamzad&#39;s wife, who also becomes Dan&#39;s love interest. Similarly, Hamzad&#39;s connection with Angela is absent in the novel, allowing the showrunners to explore new storylines even if they wrap up the novel&#39;s events in The Old Man season 2.
