## Literature Review
Loudermilk is one of the most underrated TV comedies in recent memory. From Ron Livingston to Will Sasso, its cast is full of hilarious actors.




Led by Ron Livingston and Will Sasso, the cast of the hugely underrated sitcom Loudermilk is full of hilarious actors. Loudermilk revolves around Sam Loudermilk, a former music critic and a recovering alcoholic, who reluctantly takes in fellow addicts and runs a Sober Friends group at the local church. The show ran for an initial two seasons on the Audience Network before airing its third and final season on Prime Video. The series was created by Peter Farrelly, the co-director of Dumb and Dumber and There’s Something About Mary, in collaboration with Bobby Mort.




The recurring appearances of Loudermilk’s recovery group allowed Farrelly and Mort to pack the ensemble cast with world-class comedy talents. The group includes both acclaimed character actors and renowned standup comedians, each with their own quirky characters to play. From Brian Regan to Laura Mennell, the Loudermilk cast has plenty of great actors.
