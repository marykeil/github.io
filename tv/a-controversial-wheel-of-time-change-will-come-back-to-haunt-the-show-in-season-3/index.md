## Literature Review

The Wheel of Time season 1 introduced a character change that left fans unhappy, and now, that same controversy will have to return in season 3.




Back in The Wheel of Time season 1, fans were left stunned after the show portrayed the character Abell Cauthon as a villain, and now that the series will be returning to Two Rivers in The Wheel of Time season 3, the show will have to own up to this major character change. The Wheel of Time is a high fantasy television series based on books of the same name by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. Although there are 14 books in the series, there are only two seasons of the show, both of which are streaming on Prime Video.




The Wheel of Time was confirmed for a third season, and notably, it was announced that season 3 would follow the plot of the fourth The Wheel of Time book, &#34;The Shadow Rising.&#34; This means that there are certain events that are sure to pass during The Wheel of Time season 3. One of those events involves Perrin returning to Two Rivers for the first time since he, Rand, Mat, and Egwene left in season 1. Along with that, Perrin will inevitably have to run into Abell Cauthon, who was so wrongly characterized in The Wheel of Time season 1.

                  12 Biggest Characters Still Missing From The Wheel Of Time After Season 2   The Wheel of Time has introduced a plethora of characters from Robert Jordan&#39;s book series, but 12 major characters are still missing after season 2.   


 Wheel Of Time&#39;s Massive Abell Cauthon Change Explained 
          




Although Abell Cauthon has only appeared in one episode of The Wheel of Time, the changes to his character from the books to the TV show have been vast. According to The Wheel of Time television series, Cauthon is a vile and traitorous person. Though he is married to Natti and has three children with her, he continues to cheat and openly flirt with other women in front of her. In the very first episode of the series, Cauthon&#39;s bad behavior is established, and as a result, shows that Mat, Cauthon&#39;s son, has to take serious responsibility for his family.

It is safe to say that Abell Cauthon does not appear this way in The Wheel of Time books. In fact, he is quite the opposite. In the novels, Abell is just an average farmer and trader. He is known for getting good deals when trading horses, and furthermore, he serves on the Village Council of Emond&#39;s Field. All of this is established early on in the book series, yet is changed. So, why did The Wheel of Time ruin his character so thoroughly? The answer has yet to be clear, but will definitely need to appear in season 3.






Abell Cauthon is played by Christopher Sciueref in The Wheel of Time season 1.






 Wheel Of Time&#39;s Season 3 Setup Makes Abell Cauthon&#39;s Return Inevitable 
         

In The Wheel of Time season 3, Perrin will likely return to Two Rivers as he did in &#34;The Shadow Rising&#34;, and because of the the book&#39;s plot, and also the strong choices the series made against Abell Cauthon, it is inevitable that he will come back into play. According to the fourth The Wheel of Time book, Perrin returns to Two Rivers, and upon his homecoming, discovers a tragedy and a group of monsters intent on destroying his hometown. Therefore, Perrin becomes a leader, enlisting the help of Abell Cauthon, among others, to encourage the townsfolk to fight back.




Now, this plot does not really align with the Abell Cauthon that The Wheel of Time introduced early in season 1. There is no reason why a philanderer like Cauthon would join any cause, much less a dangerous and selfless one. In this way, there are many questions as to how The Wheel of Time is going to maintain the plot of the original book, while also sticking with what they depicted in earlier seasons. Although Cauthon is supposed to play a role in &#34;The Shadow Rising,&#34; his television character seems too villainous to embark on such a brave path.



 What Abell Cauthon&#39;s Wheel Of Time Season 3 Story Could Be 
          

The best route The Wheel of Time season 3 can take is giving Abell Cauthon a redemption arc. It does not have to be a quick turnaround by any means, but the series should definitely show hints of Cauthon feeling remorse for his past actions and trying to make an effort to be better. If the show does not do this, then it seems likely that Cauthon simply will not play the role that was set out for him the books. But even then, a redemption arc could still be in Cauthon&#39;s future, and this would be a good thing.
