# Star Trek Prodigy Shows An Enterprise-D Feature 30 Years After TNG Never Did


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 reveals a close-up of Counselor Troi&#39;s USS Enterprise-D console, a first-time sight for Star Trek.   Prodigy aired &#34;Kobayashi&#34; in January 2022, bringing back the Enterprise-D before Star Trek: Picard season 3.   The animated recreation of the iconic Enterprise bridge in Prodigy was beautifully detailed and awe-inspiring.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 resurrected the bridge of the USS Enterprise-D in &#34;Kobayashi&#34; and showed something TNG never did in 178 episodes.




Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 showed a feature and perspective of the USS Enterprise-D&#39;s bridge that Star Trek: The Next Generation never did after 178 episodes. When Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray) takes the Kobayashi Maru test in Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, episode 6, &#34;Kobayashi,&#34; he uses the USS Protostar&#39;s holodeck to recreate the iconic bridge of the USS Enterprise-D. The command center of the D is, indeed, a sight for sore eyes, and for sharp-eyed TNG aficionados, Star Trek: Prodigy showed something only Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) usually got to see close-up.




Star Trek: Picard season 3 researcher JÃ¶rg Hillebrand (@gaghyogi49) shared on Twitter/X that Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s &#34;Kobayashi&#34; showed a close-up of Counselor Troi&#39;s USS Enterprise-D bridge console, something that was only seen in wide shots on Star Trek: The Next Generation. Check out Hillebrand&#39;s post below:


 

Although Counselor Troi wasn&#39;t in Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s &#34;Kobayashi&#34;, and it was Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) who sat in Deanna&#39;s seat as one of the holographic Star Trek legacy characters crewing the Enterprise-D with Dal R&#39;El, Troi&#39;s bridge console was a first-time sight for Star Trek.

 Star Trek: Prodigy Brought Back USS Enterprise-D Before Picard Season 3 
Including the carpet.
         

The USS Enterprise-D was a sight for weepy eyes when it returned in its live-action glory in Star Trek: Picard season 3. However, Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 actually brought back the Enterprise-D first. &#34;Kobayashi&#34; aired in January 2022, over a year before Star Trek: Picard season 3, episode 9, &#34;Vox,&#34; unveiled the Enterprise-D. Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s 3D animated recreation of Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s iconic Enterprise bridge was no less lovely detailed, awe-inspiring, or surprising when it initially happened, however.

For Star Trek: Picard season 3, production designers Dave Blass and Liz Kloczkowski cut zero corners when they rebuilt the bridge of the USS Enterprise-D&#39;s bridge to be virtually indistinguishable from how it appeared in Star Trek: The Next Generation. The D&#39;s bright lights and homey tones beautifully contrasted with the colder and darker environs of the USS Titan-A and the Shrike. In Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, the USS Protostar is a sleek and gleaming, state-of-the-art Starfleet vessel, and the USS Enterprise-D was a nostalgic contrast with its more spacious Galaxy Class bridge.






Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 is available to stream on Netflix. Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
