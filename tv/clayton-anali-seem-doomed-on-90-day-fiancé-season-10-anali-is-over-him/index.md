## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomers Clayton Clark and Anali Vallejos have caught the attention of viewers, but it seems likely that they will split.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 couple Clayton Clark and Anali Vallejos have already earned a lot of attention on the hit reality TV show, but their dynamic onscreen is hinting at a major break-up. Clayton and Anali met for the first time during 90 Day Fiancé season 10 and are currently on different pages when it comes to important relationship issues. This leaves many questions about Clayton and Anali&#39;s relationship status after filming, as they are proving they are not a compatible pair.




Like many couples in the extended franchise, 90 Day Fiancé season 10 pair Clayton and Anali are a little mismatched. Clayton comes across as far more into Anali than she is into him, as he excitedly hoped to be intimate with his Peruvian partner on her first night in the United States. However, Anali denied Clayton&#39;s advances. Furthermore, she refused to sleep with him in a hotel when he booked them a room close to his mother. While there are rumors that Anali is using Clayton, it&#39;s more likely that she just isn&#39;t interested in him anymore.


 Anali Doesn’t Want To Be Intimate With Clayton 

 

Clayton and Anali may be under contract, but that hasn’t stopped him from sharing happy photos with Anali on social media. Clayton shared a cozy image with Anali in his native Kentucky recently. However, this is a far contrast to what 90 Day Fiancé season 10 viewers see onscreen. Anali made it clear that she didn&#39;t want to be intimate with Clayton, as she refused his advances on numerous occasions. Anali seems to be seriously reconsidering why she moved to the U.S. in the first place.






 Clayton Is Not Providing A Welcoming Life For Anali 
          

In the most recent episode of 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Anali made it crystal clear that the only reason she is in the United States is for her 90 Day Fiancé season 10 partner, Clayton. However, he isn&#39;t doing much to welcome her. He lives in a crowded apartment with four animals and houses his mother in the closet. Anali was obviously overwhelmed by Clayton&#39;s living conditions, especially when he made her clean the animal cages. It&#39;s clear that this isn&#39;t the life Anali was expecting with Clayton.

While numerous foreign 90 Day Fiancé cast members have been accused of being gold diggers and green card chasers, Anali struggles to part with her old life. She expressed a deep desire to be with her sick mother in Peru. Meanwhile, Clayton&#39;s sister has been very unwelcoming, and his life is unappealing. Anali is clearly dissatisfied with her living situation in 90 Day Fiancé season 10, and there&#39;s a strong chance that her feelings for Clayton have diminished due to such circumstances.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
