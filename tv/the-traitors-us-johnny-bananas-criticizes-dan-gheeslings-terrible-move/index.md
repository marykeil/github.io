## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 contestant and Challenge legend Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio thinks Dan Gheesling made a big mistake with his strategy.




The Traitors US season 2 contestant Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio was the first to leave the show when the first two traitors--Dan Gheesling and Phaedra Parks--&#34;murdered&#34; him, and he now criticizes Dan and calls his elimination a &#34;terrible move.&#34; A Challenge legend, Johnny holds the record for the most wins at seven. He entered the game with two other icons from The Challenge--Chris &#34;CT&#34; Tamburello and Trishelle Canatella. Dan is one of the best to ever play Big Brother, winning season 10 and coming in second in season 14.




In an interview with EW, Johnny said, &#34;Dan just saw me as not even necessarily a threat to his game, I just think he saw me as a threat in general.&#34; Johnny added that if Dan was trying to &#34;work in the shadows and not say a whole lot,&#34; then he should have kept him. He reasoned, &#34;Listen, don&#39;t you want a big, loud, shiny object around to divert attention from you?&#34; Johnny also pointed out that he and CT could&#39;ve helped everyone add money to the prize pot. Johnny concluded with, &#34;From every angle, strategically, it was a terrible move, which is why I think the reason he made it had nothing to do with strategy.&#34;

Johnny also shared that he and CT had spoken about how The Traitors US might&#39;ve been the first time that they could actually work together on a show and not have to eliminate each other, especially if they ended up being on the same side as either faithfuls or traitors. He said, &#34;It was nice in that regard, where we almost had to align with each other because we knew that, based on the fact that we have history, and we come from the same show, we&#39;re probably going to be targeted, and all we really had was each other.&#34; Johnny added, &#34;And we&#39;re there representing our franchise, so we were almost playing for something bigger than ourselves, the legacy that we all represent.&#34;


 

Johnny made some great points about why Dan&#39;s decision to murder him wasn&#39;t the best one. However, Johnny can be a loose cannon, so it&#39;s possible that Dan just wanted to get rid of him as quickly as possible. Dan and Phaedra knew that murdering Johnny first would send a message to the faithfuls that the traitors weren&#39;t afraid to eliminate the strongest players. However, it would&#39;ve been interesting to see Johnny and Dan work together, since their styles are so different, even though they&#39;re both fierce competitors. Johnny is usually one of the loudest voices in the room, while Dan is much more introverted.




Johnny&#39;s murder was shocking, especially since he&#39;s always been such a big presence on every show he&#39;s on. In the past few months, he&#39;s placed second on House of Villains and third on The Challenge: USA season 2. Johnny was expected to dominate The Traitors US season 2, but his early elimination was a huge surprise. It would&#39;ve been fun to see him, CT, and Trishelle team up together. It&#39;s disappointing that Johnny won&#39;t have the opportunity to play The Traitors US, but perhaps he can return to the show in a future season. It would be thrilling to see Johnny have all the power as a traitor the next time around.

The Traitors US season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
