## Literature Review
Omni-Man appeared to be a reformed character after his return in Invincible season 2, but there are subtle clues that could mean it&#39;s all an act.





Summary

  Omni-Man&#39;s repentant return may be hiding an ulterior motive, raising questions about his sincerity and true intentions.   Omni-Man&#39;s guilt led him to leave Earth and defy his people, but his words must be treated with caution as he may be trying to manipulate the situation.   The presence of Omni-Man&#39;s new infant son, Oliver, suggests a plan to build an army and overthrow the Viltrumite Empire, with other hybrid children potentially involved.  







Omni-Man&#39;s repentant return in Invincible season 2 may not be all that it appears, as his good Samaritan act could be hiding an ulterior motive. The return of J.K. Simmons&#39; character meant the unveiling of Oliver, Mark Grayson&#39;s brother. Although Omni-Man&#39;s new family life made it seem as though he is trying to move on from his villainous ways, his change of heart after disappearing at the end of Invincible season 1 was unusually sudden. Omni-Man&#39;s sincerity regarding his new, more wholesome, view of the universe must, therefore, be questioned.

Omni-Man was absent during the early installments of the show&#39;s sophomore run, but reappeared near the end of Invincible season 2, part 1. This version of Nolan Grayson was far removed from the violent antagonist he was portrayed as in season 1. Not only had a placid demeanor taken hold, but his attitude towards being a husband and father also seemed to have been transformed. Nolan has fathered a child with his new insectoid wife, Andressa, and their relationship seems to be built on genuine love. However, Omni-Man has used this ploy before with Mark&#39;s mother, and his apparent attempt at reform could be little more than the first step in a new evil scheme.




                  Invincible Cast &amp; Character Guide: What The Voice Actors Look Like   Amazon Prime Video&#39;s animated Invincible TV show is now out. Here&#39;s every cast member who appears and which comic characters they play.    


 Omni-Man Left Earth Out Of Guilt, But Couldn&#39;t Return To Viltrum 
Nolan Grayson was left with nowhere to go
         

Invincible season 1 revealed that Omni-Man&#39;s superhero career was nothing but an act. His true goal was to prepare Earth for occupation by his own people, the Viltrumites. Mark discovering his father&#39;s evil scheme led to a destructive skirmish as Invincible fought to defend his home planet. While Mark may have succeeded in his task, it was not a decisive victory. Omni-Man stopped attacking his son just short of killing him, fleeing Earth when he realized what he had done to his own flesh and blood.

Omni-Man&#39;s guilt getting the better of him meant that he abandoned his post on Earth, defying direct orders given by the Viltrumites. As a result, Omni-Man could not return home due to his undeniable failure, and would have anticipated his fellow tyrants hunting him down sooner or later. Omni-Man claims to have aimlessly wandered the stars, searching for purpose, and Invincible season 2 also showed Omni-Man on the brink of taking his own life. This could have been out of fear of what the Viltrumites would do to him as punishment for failing the mission on Earth.




So soon after betraying his wife, son, and the people of Earth, every word from Omni-Man&#39;s mouth needs to be treated with caution. Even if what he tells Mark in Invincible&#39;s mid-season finale, &#34;It&#39;s Been a While,&#34; has an element of truth to it, those words may have been twisted to act in Omni-Man&#39;s favor. Omni-Man knows that his failure on Earth will invoke the wrath of his people, and he cannot hide from them forever. This realization will also come with the understanding that he needs to find a way to defend himself.

Omni-Man&#39;s new infant son, Oliver Grayson, could be the start of a sinister plan to build an army. This would also explain his desire to reconnect with Mark. Mark was not originally born to fight alongside his father in a battle against the Viltrumite home world, but the context of Oliver entering the fray lends credence to the theory that Omni-Man feels the need to build his own team capable of overthrowing Viltrum. Oliver was potentially born for that very purpose, and Omni-Man added a second member to his army by summoning Mark from Earth.






 Mark Is Almost As Strong As Omni-Man, So Other Hybrids Could Be Too 
Even half-Viltrumites are formidable
          

Viltrumite DNA is very powerful and unusually dominant. Therefore, even though Mark is a human/Viltrumite hybrid, his power is almost equal to that of a pure Viltrumite. This was shown in the Invincible season 1 finale during Mark&#39;s battle with Omni-Man. Although Mark lost, he survived the horrific beating he received from his father. The show of strength and durability evidenced by Mark means that other half-Viltrumites are likely to share the same level of power, especially those conceived with a compatible race like Earth&#39;s humans.

                  What The World Thinks Happened To Omni-Man In Invincible Season 2   Invincible season 2 sees the world&#39;s recovery after Invincible and Omni-Man&#39;s battle and reveals what the population believes of Omni-Man&#39;s fate.    




Oliver&#39;s mother, Andressa, is a member of an insectoid species. Andressa&#39;s race, the Thraxans, have an accelerated life cycle, so mature and die much faster than both Viltrumites and humans. Oliver&#39;s half-Thraxan DNA not only increases his life expectancy, but his Viltrumite heritage also means he will likely possess powers approaching the level of his father and half-brother. In Invincible season 2, Omni-Man claimed the Viltrumites would view Oliver as &#34;inferior&#34; because the super-race is not permitted to breed with Thraxans. This does not necessarily mean Oliver won&#39;t still grow into a capable fighter.



 Omni-Man May Already Have Other Hybrid Children Ready To Fight The Viltrumites 
Mark Grayson may discover he has other interplanetary relatives
          

As an advanced and near-immortal race, Omni-Man&#39;s people have strong knowledge of the various planets harboring sentient life throughout the universe. This expertise may have led Omni-Man to Thraxa, knowing that their rapid gestation cycle would be the quickest way to produce a new soldier in his war against Viltrum. Raising Oliver within a loving relationship may simply have been a ruse to get Mark onside upon his arrival. This may not have been the only contingency plan Omni-Man had in place, however, posing an intriguing question Invincible season 2, part 2 could answer.




If Mark&#39;s father knew about Thraxa, it&#39;s also possible that he knew about other worlds where he could add to his legion in a relatively short space of time. Additionally, Omni-Man&#39;s visits to those worlds may not have been as friendly as his stay on Thraxa. Only the return of Invincible season 2 will reveal all, but with Oliver and Mark already in-play, Omni-Man&#39;s plan to build a personal army capable of taking down the Viltrumite Empire could just be getting started.



All episodes of Invincible are on Amazon Prime Video. All of season 1 is on the platform, along with the first four episodes of Invincible season 2. The second season is set to resume in 2024.
