Summary

  Riverdale&#39;s early seasons focused on Archie, Betty, and Veronica&#39;s love triangle, reminiscent of the iconic pairing in the Archie comics.   Veronica and Archie go through ups and downs in their relationship, including several dramatic breakups, but find their way back to each other time and again.   Season 7 introduces a new dynamic, with Archie, Veronica, Betty, and Jughead forming a quad relationship, adding a fresh twist to the series.  







The CW&#39;s adaptation of the Archie Comics&#39; flagship series boasts tons of epic highs and lows, but Archie and Veronica&#39;s relationship timeline weathers most of Riverdale&#39;s storms. The Archie characters first appeared in a 1941 issue of Pep Comics and proved to be a huge hit for the publisher. Soon enough, the Riverdale cast of characters became the company&#39;s crown jewels, with teen-centered stories eclipsing their superhero fare. Part of the fun of the Archie comics is the series&#39; continual reinvention; like other enduring comic-book series, each Archie run incorporates new ideas, characters, art styles, and tones. That said, The CW&#39;s Riverdale isn&#39;t really a huge leap.

The first season of Riverdale plays out like a small-town murder mystery: all-American teen Archie Andrews (KJ Apa), girl-next-door Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart), new-to-town Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes), and loner Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse) unearth the evil lurking behind Riverdale&#39;s glossy facade. Much like the Archie comics, which see the titular character torn between his love for Veronica and Betty, Riverdale&#39;s early seasons lean into the franchise&#39;s love triangle. Across Riverdale&#39;s seven seasons, legions of viewers shipped Archie and Veronica (a.k.a. Varchie) — one of the show&#39;s most iconic pairings. 





 Season 1, Episode 1 - Archie Andrews &amp; Veronica Lodge Lock Eyes At Pop&#39;s 
Veronica Interrupts Archie &amp; Betty&#39;s Pseudo-Date
          

In the pilot episode of Riverdale, the main players are all introduced one-by-one. Betty is Archie&#39;s shy, long-time pal with a budding crush, while Veronica is the new girl in town. Having moved with her mother, Hermione Lodge (Marisol Nichols), from New York City to escape the awful press surrounding the family&#39;s criminal patriarch, Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos). Both Hermione and Hiram have history in Riverdale, but, after locking eyes with Archie in Pop&#39;s diner (and interrupting Betty&#39;s sort-of date with the red-head), it seems Veronica has a future in the titular &#34;Town with Pep.&#34;



 Archie Goes To The Semi-Formal With Veronica (&amp; Betty) 
Riverdale Takes Cues From The Archie Comics&#39; Love Triangle
          




Taking cues from its source material, Riverdale sees Archie pulled between Betty and Veronica. At first, it doesn&#39;t really start out as a heated competition. In fact, Betty&#39;s crush on Archie is a bit one-sided. Hoping to make a new friend, Veronica insists Archie take both her and Betty to the semi-formal dance. Despite Ronnie&#39;s kind intentions, however, she&#39;s clearly starting to fall for the newest addition to Riverdale High&#39;s football team.



 Archie &amp; Veronica Kiss 
Cheryl Blossom&#39;s Party Features A Dramatic &#34;7 Minutes In Heaven&#34; Game
          

At Cheryl Blossom&#39;s (Madelaine Petsch) post-dance party, things get more than a little heated. As fate would have it, Veronica and Archie are paired up for a dramatic game of &#34;7 minutes in heaven,&#34; which unnerves Betty, though she&#39;s buoyed by the fact that Veronica seems to be her friend. While Veronica insists she won&#39;t betray Betty, the time Ronnie and Archie spend in the ever-romantic closet of the Blossom mansion is too much to handle. The two share a kiss, though Veronica is adamant about regretting it.




                  All 7 Seasons Of Riverdale, Ranked Worst To Best   While Riverdale&#39;s seven seasons saw the show rise and fall dramatically in terms of quality, the teen drama/murder mystery was at least never boring.    



 Archie &amp; Veronica Grow  r Ahead Of The Talent Show 
Nothing Brings People Together Like Being On Betty&#39;s Bad Side
          

In the lead-up to Riverdale High&#39;s talent show, budding musician Archie grows closer to Veronica, who spends some time with Josie&#39;s Pussycats. Both Archie and Veronica are on Betty&#39;s bad side; Betty is understandably upset that her long-time crush doesn&#39;t feel the same way about her, though she&#39;s even more disappointed in Veronica&#39;s seven-minutes-in-heaven betrayal. At first, Archie flubs his talent show audition, but Ronnie assures him that he can just focus on her when he sings. The connection is pretty magical, especially from Archie&#39;s perspective.






 


 Season 1, Episode 11 - Veronica Tries To Deny Her Feelings For Archie 
Archie &amp; Veronica Sing &#34;Kids in America&#34; &amp; Solve Murders
          

Even after another stolen kiss (and many stolen glances), Veronica tries to deny her feelings for Archie. While she wants to be friends with Archie, winning back Betty&#39;s trust is also a priority (even though, by this point, Betty is happily dating Jughead). Even with the mystery of Jason Blossom&#39;s murder coming into clearer focus, it becomes harder for Veronica to push her feelings for Archie away. At the homecoming dance, the pair duet &#34;Kids in America,&#34; putting their chemistry on full display for the rest of Riverdale High.



 Varchie Becomes Official In The Riverdale Season 1 Finale 
The Couple Hookup For The First Time
          




In the Riverdale season 1 finale, &#34;Chapter Thirteen: The Sweet Hereafter,&#34; it&#39;s revealed that Clifford Blossom orchestrated his own son&#39;s death in order to protect his drug dealings. After Archie and his friends save a distraught Cheryl from joining her late brother, life in Riverdale slows down. Veronica and Archie hook up for the first time and cement their status as an official couple, ending the season-long drama on a high note.

                  Riverdale Made The Right Choice Dropping Its Original Ending Plan   Riverdale&#39;s season 7 finale was controversial, but the original plan for the long-running teen show&#39;s ending would have been significantly worse.    



 Season 2, Episode 1 - Veronica Consoles Archie 
Season 1&#39;s Cliffhanger Ending Sees Fred Andrews Get Shot In Pop&#39;s
          

Although all seems well in the Riverdale season 1 finale, the episode ends with a cliffhanger: a gunman barges into Pop&#39;s diner while Archie and his dad, Fred (Luke Perry), are eating and proceeds to shoot Fred. The mystery of who shot Fred Andrews permeates the first half of Riverdale season 2. Veronica stands by her boyfriend, offering him comfort (and to pay for Fred&#39;s hospital bills) as the atmosphere in the small town grows increasingly dark.






 Archie Meets Hiram Lodge (&amp; Veronica&#39;s Ex) 
Archie&#39;s Becomes Riverdale&#39;s Vigilante
          

Early on in season 2, Hiram Lodge finally comes to Riverdale. One of the series&#39; overarching antagonists, Hiram is always out for himself — and never up to any good. Not too impressed by Archie, or his blue-collar upbringing, Hiram is an obstacle for Varchie to overcome. To make matters worse, Veronica&#39;s petulant ex, Nick St. Claire, comes to town, vying for Ronnie&#39;s love with memories of who she used to be in New York. Meanwhile, Archie takes Riverdale&#39;s Black Hood problem into his own hands by becoming a vigilante — much to Ronnie&#39;s dismay.



 Archie Says &#34;I Love You&#34; To Veronica 
Ronnie Does Not Reciprocate Archie&#39;s Words
          




After weathering an awkward family dinner with the Lodges and growing increasingly distressed about his loved ones&#39; safety, Archie hooks up with Veronica on the living room floor of the Pembroke and says the &#34;L&#34; word for the first time. Unfortunately, Veronica doesn&#39;t say &#34;I love you&#34; back, which makes things incredibly tense between the couple. Clearly, Veronica&#39;s past has come to haunt her present, thus clouding her feelings for Archie.

                  Riverdale Series Finale Ending Explained: What Happened To Archie &amp; His Friends   In the Riverdale series finale, an 86-year-old Betty relives her last day of high school and says a final goodbye to Archie, Veronica, and Jughead.    



 Veronica Breaks Up With Archie 
It&#39;s A &#34;Mad World&#34; In Riverdale
          

At a Southside Serpent retirement party for long-time leader FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich), a.k.a. Jughead&#39;s somewhat-estranged dad, Archie and Veronica take the Whyte Wyrm&#39;s stage to sing a song. While performing the &#34;Mad World&#34; duet, an upset Veronica abruptly walks off-stage, prompting Archie to chase after her. This incident culminates in Veronica breaking up with Archie — a sad moment for all Varchie fans.






 Veronica &amp; Archie Get Back Together On Christmas 
Veronica Finally Says &#34;I Love You&#34; Back
          

While the pair are broken up, Archie kisses Betty, reigniting Riverdale&#39;s love triangle — sort of. Shortly after the Barchie kiss, Veronica shows up on Archie&#39;s doorstep on Christmas with some mistletoe. After Veronica tells Archie that she does love him, the couple get back together. Ever-honest (and threatened by Cheryl&#39;s blackmail scheme), Archie admits to kissing Betty, but promises it didn&#39;t mean anything. In a welcome twist, Veronica believes (and trusts) her boyfriend. Varchie go on to weather Riverdale&#39;s tense mayoral election and even Veronica&#39;s fraught confirmation party.



 Season 3, Episode 1 - Archie Is Arrested 
Archie &amp; Veronica Spend One Last Day Together
          




Unfortunately, the couple&#39;s bliss is short-lived when Hiram frames Archie for murder. (Surely, there must be easier ways to encourage a breakup, but Hiram has a real flair for the dramatic — and a real hatred of Archie Andrews.) At his season 3 murder trial, Archie takes a deal instead of fighting for his innocence, as it seems the deck is stacked in Hiram&#39;s favor. Before being shipped off to Shankshaw, a prison that Hiram owns, Archie and Veronica spend one last day together.



 Veronica Breaks Archie Out Of Hiram&#39;s Prison 
Archie Dumps Veronica &amp; Flees Riverdale
          

Using a blonde wig and her sharp business acumen, Veronica not only visits her beau in prison, but finds a way to break Archie out of Hiram&#39;s slammer. After Ronnie proves Archie&#39;s innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt, she throws him a celebratory party. Sadly, Archiekins doesn&#39;t show up. Instead, Archie breaks up with Veronica — over the phone — because of the threat Hiram poses to him, his family, and their relationship. Archie then leaves Riverdale behind, knowing Hiram will stop at nothing to hunt him down.




                  5 Reasons Betty &amp; Veronica Would Be Riverdale’s Only Satisfying Endgame Couple   In the comics, Archie wavers between his love for Betty or Veronica. Riverdale could subvert the trope by having Betty and Veronica choose each other.    



 Veronica Dates Reggie In Archie&#39;s Absence 
Veronica Struggles To Trust Archie When He Returns To Riverdale
         

While Archie is off in the Canadian wilderness fighting bears, Veronica tries to move on with her life in Riverdale. She strikes up a relationship with her friend and co-worker, Reggie Mantle (Charles Melton), who was crucial to breaking Archie out of prison. When Archie returns, he assumes that Ronnie will be thrilled to see him. Instead, things are awkward; Reggie admits that he and Veronica got together. Veronica apologizes and Archie forgives her, saying it was okay to move on. Yet again, the couple&#39;s reunion is short-lived: after Hiram is shot, Veronica suspects Archie. With their trust broken, Varchie splits.






 Veronica Manages Archie&#39;s Boxing Career 
Varchie Goes To Prom &#34;As Friends&#34; (&amp; Reunite In The Finale)
         

Despite their breakup, Archie and Veronica remain friends. Given that Veronica is always on the lookout for her next big venture, she decides to be Archie&#39;s manager and help revamp the boxing gym. Apparently, after paying off her father — who tried to take over every business in Riverdale, including V&#39;s own La Bonne Nuit and Pop’s — she&#39;s still rolling in cash. In addition to exploring Archie&#39;s post-high school boxing ambitions, the tail-end of season 3 sees the Riverdale gang attend their junior prom. Although Varchie go to the prom as &#34;just friends,&#34; they end up professing their love in the season 3 finale.



 Archie &amp; Veronica Go Steady 
Veronica Comforts Archie After Fred&#39;s Passing, But Fears A Graduation Split
          




While Riverdale season 4 opens with Fred&#39;s tragic death — a memorial to Perry&#39;s real-life passing — it also digs into a cliffhanger set up in the season 3 finale: who is going to kill Jughead? For the most part, Archie and Veronica go steady, though the show isn&#39;t subtle about teasing Archie&#39;s emotional, long-standing connection with Betty, who&#39;s on the rocks with Jughead. Mystery plotline and web of lies aside, the biggest looming threat to Varchie&#39;s future is graduation. While Veronica toys with the idea of taking a gap year, Archie can&#39;t imagine holding her back from college.



 Veronica Breaks Up With Archie At Prom (But They Keep It A Secret) 
Archie Wrote A Song For Betty — Not Veronica
          

When Archie writes a song about Betty and Veronica mistakes it for a tune about her, things take a real turn for Varchie. Archie has some unexplored feelings for Betty that he can&#39;t deny any longer. Although Veronica and Archie attend their senior prom together, Veronica suggests they break up — with one caveat: she wants to keep their split a secret until after graduation, so that they and their friends can make some happy memories together before going their separate ways. In season 5, episode 3, the Riverdale gang graduates and buries a time capsule.




                  Riverdale’s Stunning Season 6 Twist Ending Explained (In Detail)   Season 6 of Riverdale may have been the most chaotic so far, but its finale&#39;s ending twist is one that will make sure the show is always remembered.    



 Season 5 - Veronica &amp; Archie Try To Make Things Work 7 Years Later 
Veronica Leaves Her Husband But Archie Won&#39;t Leave Riverdale
          

After spending seven years away from Riverdale, Archie returns to the &#34;town with Pep.&#34; Now an Army vet — and also an adult — Archie is shocked to discover Riverdale&#39;s state of disrepair. (Hiram, of course, is behind the decline.) In order to revive his beloved town, Archie reaches out to some old friends. Veronica, now the ultra-successful &#34;she-wolf of Wall Street,&#34; is unhappily married. Archie and Veronica team up to drive Hiram out of Riverdale and, after Veronica decides to get a divorce, they try to rekindle their romance. Unfortunately, they can&#39;t reconcile their very different life paths.






 Season 6 - Rivervale&#39;s Ending Wipes Everyone&#39;s Memories 
Veronica Is The New Girl In Town Again
          

An explosion in Riverdale brings the gang to the parallel universe of Rivervale, infusing the show&#39;s plotline with even more elements of magic, fantasy, and, of course, a Chilling Adventures of Sabrina crossover. In this alternate reality, Veronica and Reggie are the town&#39;s hottest power couple. Riverdale season 6 attempts to wrap up the adult gang&#39;s lingering stories, all while setting up an epic battle between good and evil. For the most part, Archie and Veronica are friends and allies in the fight. When a meteor threatens to destroy Riverdale, however, the gang reawakens in yet another new timeline: 1950s Riverdale. 



 Season 7 - Archie Dates Veronica, Betty &amp; Jughead 
Riverdale Season 7&#39;s Quad Ends The Love Triangle On A Fun Note
         




It&#39;s revealed in the Riverdale series finale that ending up in the alternate version of Riverdale saved everyone from Rivervale&#39;s meteor. That said, Riverdale season 7 sees the teenage gang dealing with all sorts of very high school problems — a kind of reset for the series and a fun homage to the Archie Comics. While Archie and Veronica go on a few dates, Riverdale&#39;s key love triangle isn&#39;t really the focus of season 7, which is refreshing. Ultimately, Varchie isn&#39;t endgame — not exactly. Instead, Archie, Veronica, Betty, and Jughead become Riverdale&#39;s hottest quad relationship for their senior year.
