## Literature Review
New details on Sylvie Brett&#39;s exit have been revealed, which includes her reuniting with Jesse Spencer&#39;s Matt Casey in Chicago Fire season 12. 




Co-executive producer Andrea Newman teases Sylvie Brett&#39;s exit in Chicago Fire season 12, which involves the return of Jesse Spencer&#39;s Matt Casey. The much-delayed One Chicago season is coming back in less than a week and, while specific plot details are being kept under wraps, confirmed character exits offer an idea of what is in store for Chief Boden&#39;s squad, especially in light of the events of the Chicago Fire season 11 finale. That includes how Kara Killmer&#39;s departure from the series will play out.




Speaking with Variety, Newman teases how Brett will leave Firehouse 51 in Chicago Fire season 12. As it turns out, the character will appear in several more episodes, going through a final personal arc before she officially bids the team goodbye. Meanwhile, Spencer will return as Casey, who will play a role in her departure. Read her full quote below:


Jesse Spencer will be back — our beloved Matt Casey. We can’t live without him. He’s truly the best.
I’ll say that we have a shortened season and she’s in a chunk of this season. She’s got a journey of her own to take before we let her go.




Chicago Fire and the rest of One Chicago returns on January 17 on NBC.





 Will Casey and Brett Get Married in Chicago Fire Season 12? 
          




While the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere will pick up after a significant time has passed since the season 11 finale, it will still address all the cliffhangers that the One Chicago show left last year. That includes the revelation of Brett&#39;s answer to Casey&#39;s surprise proposal. Promotional images show her seemingly wearing a ring, heavily hinting that she will say yes to her past boyfriend and now potential fiancé. Their engagement can also explain why Spencer will be back on the show.

Given that Casey and Brett&#39;s engagement is now more likely, the bigger question is whether they&#39;ll get married in Chicago. It would give Firehouse 51 a big reason to celebrate, especially after a harrowing year of marital issues with Kelly Severide and Stella Kidd, not to mention Violet Mikami&#39;s tragic loss of Evan Hawkins. It would also be the perfect way to send off Casey and Brett. After everything they have been through, their love deserves to be celebrated.

                  5 One Chicago Characters Who Likely Won&#39;t Return (&amp; 2 Who Might Come Back)   NBC&#39;s One Chicago may look very different when it finally returns with brand new episodes thanks to several character departures and returns.     




Even if the pair decides to delay getting married, Chief Boden and Firehouse 51 won&#39;t let them go without giving them a small party — both to celebrate their love and to wish them well in their future life together. Molly&#39;s would be the perfect venue for this, and it&#39;s safe to say that both Mouch and Hermann won&#39;t be opposed to opening their bar for their beloved friends. Perhaps, the event may even go down in the Chicago Fire season 12 finale.
