## Literature Review
Some great TV shows unfortunately ended in 2023, but audiences will still love them for years to come. They won’t lose their appeal for a long time.




2023 saw plenty of great TV shows coming to an end, but the best ones will remain popular for years to come. Just because a show has ended doesn&#39;t mean that it will be forgotten about, and some show&#39;s can even become more successful years later thanks to streaming platforms. Other shows have such brilliant rewatch potential that their audiences won&#39;t tire of them for a long time, even though there are no new episodes being produced.
After a show airs its finale, it can be appraised in its entirety. A finale is a key part of any show, and if a long story manages to stick the landing, it can grow in popularity. If a show produces a memorable ending, it can be enjoyable to go back and watch the show from its beginning to see the whole story unfolding, knowing what is ultimately going to happen to the characters. These great shows may have ended in 2023, but their appeal will ensure that they stay just as popular for many years.









 








 12  Archer 
14 seasons


 







After 14 seasons of genre-spoofing spy shenanigans, Archer finally ended in 2023. The show grew from its roots as a mid-century style James Bond parody, filled with ridiculous gadgets and nefarious villains, into a story about running a business in the 21st Century. In the middle of Archer’s run, the main character spent three seasons in a coma, allowing for hilarious takes on film noir, sci-fi thrillers, and pulp fiction adventures. This means that Archer’s best episodes vary in setting and genre, but the show’s fast-talking sense of humor remains a constant.





 11  Riverdale 
7 seasons
        

Riverdale is a darker take on the popular Archie comics, to the point that there’s very little tying them together beyond the names of the characters and their small town. Archie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica and the other characters were all created in the 1940s, so Riverdale updates them for a new generation. The teen drama starts out as a murder mystery, but escalating stakes and supernatural elements creep in before too long, transforming the show into a perilous time-traveling adventure, which revels in the absurdity of its plotlines.





 10  Star Trek: Picard 
3 seasons
        

Star Trek: Picard sees Patrick Stewart reprise his most famous role as Jean-Luc Picard, and he is joined by a few other iconic Star Trek characters, including Worf and Seven of Nine. The show mixes in some younger talent to assist Picard on his galactic missions, so Star Trek: Picard is able to balance its duty to fan service with fresh and exciting new adventures. A potential spinoff, Star Trek: Legacy, is yet to be confirmed.





 9  Disenchantment 
5 seasons


 







Although it didn’t achieve the lasting success of The Simpsons or Futurama, Matt Groening’s Disenchantment brings his winning formula to a medieval land teeming with mythological beasts and dark magic. Disenchantment was always going to have a tough challenge being compared to two of the greatest animated shows of all time, but it managed to distinguish itself with its serialized story and some compelling mysteries. Disenchantment may even grow in popularity after its end, now that fans can appreciate it on its own terms.





 8  Barry 
4 seasons
        

It was common knowledge that Bill Hader was a hilarious actor well before Barry, but the show allowed him to showcase his talents as an innovative director too. Barry follows a melancholic hitman who catches the acting bug when he’s hired for a job in Los Angeles. Hader is supported by a superb cast, particularly Henry Winkler and Anthony Carrigan. It’s rare for a show to have both uproarious comedy and propulsive action sequences, as one usually takes precedence over the other. It’s an industry satire where the mob and Hollywood studios have a lot in common, and Barry’s outstanding final season is well worth a rewatch.





 7  Ted Lasso 
3 seasons


 







Jason Sudeikis stars as a Kansas football coach who gets a job coaching soccer in England’s Premier League, the most prestigious club competition in the world. His earnest southern charm helps him muddle through, and this reflects the way Ted Lasso was able to win over many fans who have no interest in soccer. The show has a positive outlook on life, and it makes great comfort viewing. Ted Lasso’s ensemble cast is packed with comedy talent, but the standout performer is Hannah Waddingham, who plays Ted’s boss, Rebecca.





 6  The Flash 
9 seasons
        

From the beginning, The Flash seemed like a throwback to a more light-hearted era of superhero media. The show has a campy tone and a breezy sense of humor which matches up with the original comics, and it isn’t afraid to draw from some of the weirder storylines in DC history. In an era of comic book movies that constantly seem concerned with the fate of the universe and the moral core of humanity, The Flash will be fondly remembered for having fun with its melodramatic plots.





 5  The Crown 
6 seasons
        

The Crown charts the reign of Queen Elizabeth II from her coronation in the 1950s all the way through to the 21st Century. It’s a tumultuous period in the history of the British monarchy, as increased media scrutiny highlighted some uncomfortable truths. The Crown’s three portrayals of Elizabeth stay focused on the perils of an image-obsessed family, as scandals rise and fall over the years. In a moment of serendipity, The Crown ended in the same year that Elizabeth’s son Charles was coronated as her successor.





 4  The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel 
5 seasons
        

Amazon Prime Video’s superb period comedy draws excellent performances from its entire cast. Rachel Brosnahan and Alex Borstein’s dynamic as Midge and her manager Susie is the heart of the show, but the dysfunctional Maisel family is also a comedic delight. Even characters who aren’t in every episode slot in seamlessly and provide big laughs, particularly Luke Kirby’s Lenny Bruce, who is played as a wise and mysterious drifter. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is worth watching for the jokes and the taut storytelling, but the costumes and set design are also worthy of attention.





 3  Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan 
4 seasons
        

In 2018, John Krasinski became the latest actor to take on the role of Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst who finds himself thrust into a dangerous international conspiracy. Jack Ryan first appeared in Tom Clancy’s popular novels, and he has since been portrayed by Chris Pine, Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck. This could be an intimidating crop of talent to measure up against, but Krasinski excels as the star of the show. Jack Ryan delivers lofty political intrigue coupled with genuinely treacherous action.





 2  Sex Education 
4 seasons
        

Sex Education’s diverse cast and inclusive messages are more than just for show. For four seasons, Sex Education used levity and wit to dig deep into teen issues regarding sex, identity, and belonging. The sex-positive storylines act as miniature lessons, as the title of the show suggests. It’s a teen comedy with far more on its mind than just crude humor. Moordale Secondary is a strange mixture of British and American schools, but with its colorful, 1980s-inspired aesthetic, Sex Education rewrites the John Hughes playbook.
            
 
 10 TV Shows To Watch Next Now That Sex Education Is Over 
Now that Sex Education is over, demand may be high for more sex-forward, coming-of-age TV shows, and luckily, there are plenty to choose from. 









 1  Succession 
4 seasons


 







Before it had even ended, Succession was already being bandied about in conversations about the greatest TV shows of all time, and the fourth and final season cemented its legacy. The ending of Succession brought the saga of the Roy family to a close in spectacular fashion, wrapping up four seasons of family in-fighting and media satire. Succession can swing between laugh-out-loud comedy and tense political drama without missing a step. Its short run means that the story never gets tired, and the show maintains a razor-sharp focus.
