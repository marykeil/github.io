# Star Trek Lower Decks Captain Is “If James T. Kirk &amp; Avery Brooks Had A Child”, Says Dawnn Lewis


## SUMMARY 



  Dawnn Lewis conceived her character in Star Trek: Lower Decks as a combination of Captain Kirk and Captain Sisko.   Lewis auditioned for the role without knowing it was for Star Trek, and her fandom helped shape her character.   Captain Carol Freeman is the first modern Black female Captain who didn&#39;t start as a Commander first, and she is proving herself as a capable leader on the USS Cerritos.

## Literature Review

Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; star Dawnn Lewis pulled from a unique combo of Star Trek Captains when she auditioned for the role of Captain Carol Freeman.




Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; Dawnn Lewis hilariously describes how she conceived her character, Captain Carol Freeman, as the &#34;love child&#34; of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) from Star Trek: The Original Series and Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Freeman is the Captain of the USS Cerritos, the California Class starship that specializes in Second Contact missions for Starfleet. Lewis&#39; initial vision of the Captain of Star Trek: Lower Decks is on point because Carol Freeman does fuse the bravado of Kirk with the gravitas of Sisko.




TrekTalks 3 assembled Dawnn Lewis, Michelle Hurd of Star Trek: Picard, Marian Smothers, and Adele Simmons for a Tomorrow&#39;s Yesterdays panel hosted by the Syfy Sistas, which helped raise over $109,000 to benefit the Hollywood Food Coalition. Lewis, who was hailed for being &#34;fully-pipped&#34; because Carol Freeman was introduced in Star Trek: Lower Decks as already a starship Captain, told the story of her audition process for the animated comedy. After signing an NDA and not knowing her audition as &#34;Captain McDuck&#34; was for Star Trek, Lewis pulled from her own fandom to create the character that won her the role. Check out Lewis&#39; quote and the TrekTalks 3 video at the 1:57:01 time stamp below:


I auditioned for it, and I did my best impression of if James T. Kirk and Avery Brooks had a child. I was the love child of the surrogate parents if they were lovers and said, ‘We need to have a baby. We’ll have some woman carry it for us’... And that was what I did in my audition… Next thing I know, I get the call: ‘You booked the gig’... We get to the table read, and I’m sitting there with Tawny [Newsome], with Jack Quaid, with Noel [Wells]... And we turn over our scripts, and it says Star Trek: Lower Decks… And it was everything I could do to maintain my cool… Up until that point, we had no idea what we had been gifted with. And I was the Captain. I was not Captain McDuck, I was Captain Carol Freeman, and it was everything I could do to contain myself and not fan myself out of the gig.

 What Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; Captain Freeman Being &#34;Fully-Pipped&#34; Means 
Captain Freeman did something that evaded Benjamin Sisko and Michael Burnham
         

Captain Carol Freeman holds the distinction of being &#34;fully-pipped&#34; upon her debut in Star Trek: Lower Decks. Although Freeman isn&#39;t the first Black Captain in a Star Trek series, a honor that goes to Avery Brooks&#39; Captain Benjamin Sisko on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Carol is the first modern Black female Captain who did not start as a Commander first. Both Ben Sisko and Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) began their shows as Commanders and were promoted in season 3 of each of their series. In fact, Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; summer 2020 debut predates Michael Burnham&#39;s promotion to Captain at the end of Star Trek: Discovery season 3, which aired in January 2021.




Carol Freeman is the first Black female Star Trek Captain who arrived &#34;fully-pipped&#34; in Star Trek on Paramount&#43;&#39;s series, but there is a legacy character who predates her. In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Madge Sinclair played the first Black female Captain ever in Star Trek. Sinclair returned in Star Trek: The Next Generation to play Captain Silva La Forge, the mother of Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton). Meanwhile, Carol Freeman is proving herself to be a capable Captain and the USS Cerritos has become legendary as the &#34;Enterprise&#34; of the California Class support fleet. Given Carol&#39;s daughter, Lt. Beckett Mariner (Tawny Newsome) has an aversion to command, and her husband Alonzo Freeman (Phil LaMarr) is an Admiral, Carol Freeman may remain the lone Captain in her family on Star Trek: Lower Decks.



Star Trek: Lower Decks is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
