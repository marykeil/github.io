## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Ethan has been struggling with the rift between Moriah and Olivia, but he may have discovered Moriah&#39;s been lying all along.




Welcome To Plathville’s Ethan Plath has been struggling throughout the season after Moriah Plath accused Olivia Plath of some nasty behavior, but it may come to pass that Moriah’s been lying about the music controversy all along. Welcome To Plathville season 5 has revolved around the issues in Ethan and Olivia’s difficult marriage, but has been pushed along by the problems Ethan’s family, including Moriah, have with his wife. Moriah, who was once close to Olivia, has been against her sister-in-law since the pair worked together and it ended badly. After cutting off contact with the couple, Moriah has been slowly trying to extend an olive branch to her brother.




In a preview from Welcome To Plathville, Moriah and Ethan sat down to talk about what had happened between them after Olivia and Moriah’s disagreement over her music. Moriah, who seems to be saying she may have overreacted in the clip, explained, “I didn’t know what happened, I didn’t know if she had stolen it from me.” 


 

Ethan pushed back, asking why she and Olivia had spent the night before their trip “changing the password so you could have access to your music while we were gone.” While Moriah fought back, Ethan remained firm that he’d witnessed it himself.


 Welcome To Plathville Fans Side With Ethan Over Moriah 
          




Despite the fact that Moriah has been vocal about the argument against Olivia, Welcome To Plathville season 5 fans are siding with Ethan over Moriah. Within the clip, Moriah explained in an interview segment that she feels she’s right about Olivia, but her tone is off. “do not remember anything like that of Olivia giving me passwords to my account or anything. I remember the night before they left, I do not remember anything like that,” Moriah shared. “If Olivia had given me the password, I would have it somewhere. I can pretty much promise you that never happened.” Despite her clear argument, fans feel they can’t trust Moriah’s memory.


 

While Moriah may remember things differently than Ethan, it feels accurate that Olivia wouldn’t have withheld Moriah’s music deliberately. With Ethan so certain that his wife had given his sister the password to her account, many believe that Moriah has been making a mountain out of a molehill for months on Welcome To Plathville. While she may believe her own lies, it looks like Moriah is becoming more like her over-dramatic mother, Kim Plath, with each passing day. Moriah’s explanation about not having the music sounded odd, and left many fans feeling she couldn’t be telling the truth with such a confused, overwhelmed tone to her voice.




While Moriah and Ethan may not see eye to eye on the issues between them, their problems with Olivia have caused much larger issues in the family. Though in the preview clip, Ethan is seen defending Olivia, the pair have since split up and are going through a messy divorce. Still, the fact that Moriah may have lied about an incident that impacted their marriage heavily throughout its last year is something to be noted. The Welcome To Plathville star may have cost her brother much more than a difficult, uncomfortable conversation.
