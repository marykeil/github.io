## Literature Review
Dionysus actor Jason Mantzoukas provides a candid update on Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2, revealing an interesting cast challenge.




Percy Jackson and the Olympians star Jason Mantzoukas comments on the show&#39;s season 2 chances and addresses one issue the season will face. Based on the bestselling books by author Rick Riordan, the new Disney Plus series chronicles the adventures of the titular demigod and his friends in a world of Greek mythological figures. While the Percy Jackson and the Olympians reviews have been glowing, the show has not yet been renewed for season 2.




Now, as new episodes continue to air, Dionysus actor Mantzoukas addresses whether Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2 will happen during a recent interview on The Watch podcast. 


 

While the actor is optimistic that the series will continue, he also outlines one challenge the show will face in season 2 and beyond involving the young cast. Check out Mantzoukas&#39; full comment below:


“It was not [greenlit for more than one season]. It was not, and I wonder if that’s just because it’s an expensive show. So, I don’t know, but it’s doing well. I’m assuming there will be a season 2 and it’s meant to follow the books. Similar to the Harry Potters… each season the next book and so on. I’m curious. 
“We’re in that situation like a lot of things like this that, these kids are at that age where, not just years, but months they look different. Seeing them the last day I shot to seeing them at the premiere on the red carpet. I mean, night and day. They are different looking kids, they are taller. It’s interesting. So that will be an interesting thing to play up because it’s a lot of story to come, and can we compact?”







In his own recent update on season 2, Rick Riordan expressed optimism that the show will continue, encouraging viewers to get their friends to watch as well.




  


 Will Percy Jackson&#39;s Aging Cast Repeat A Movie Adaptation Issue? 
          

Before getting the Disney Plus treatment, two Percy Jackson and the Olympians movies were released in 2010 and 2013. Neither film was particularly well received, and Riordan himself, who has made clear that his creative input was not taken into consideration, has outlined that one of his key criticisms of the adaptations was the aging up of Percy from 13 to 17. This aging up also meant changes to the book&#39;s tone, including more adult humor.




While Riordan was able to ensure that the Percy Jackson and the Olympians cast were the proper ages for the show, Mantzoukas raises an interesting point. In the books, Percy is 13 in the first three installments, 14 in the fourth, and 15 in the fifth and final entry. Scobell is now already 15 years old and season 2 hasn&#39;t even gotten the green light. If the show proves popular enough to get all five of its planned seasons, Scobell may well be in his early 20s by the time the story concludes.



New episodes of Pery Jackson and the Olympians release on Tuesdays on Disney Plus, with the finale scheduled to drop on January 30.




The Harry Potter franchise faced a similar issue, with star Daniel Radcliffe being 20 while filming the final movie in which his character is supposed to be 17. Being 20 and playing 17, however, is very different from being 20 and playing 15. Although maintaining the characters&#39; ages has clearly been important to Riordan, practical considerations may once again require an aging up of characters like Percy, Annabeth, and Grover. Thankfully, however, Riordan&#39;s involvement means Percy Jackson and the Olympians likely won&#39;t undergo a drastic tonal change as a result.
