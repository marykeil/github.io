## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Stepanka AKA Stephanie Matto has released a book that she claims is about to get her in a lot of trouble.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Stephanie Matto has released a new “Tell All” book and here’s what’s to expect from the infamous fart jar girl’s memoir. Stephanie is a 32-year-old from Derby, Connecticut who first starred in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4. Stephanie was introduced as a YouTuber who had fallen for Australian photographer Erika Owens after meeting her online. Stephanie and Erika were the first same-sex couple in the franchise. Stephanie was exploring her sexuality when she flew to Australia to meet Erika. The trip came with a big risk attached since Stephanie was living with a condition known as aplastic anemia.




Stephanie’s relationship wasn’t successful, and she came back home at the end of her storyline. Since then, Stephanie has found ways to keep herself in the news by doing the most shocking things online. She said she had worked as a stripper in the past. In August 2020, Stephanie claimed she made $34K in 14 days on the adult platform. She soon launched her own adult subscription site called Unfiltrd using which she allegedly earned around $200,000 by selling her bottled farts to her fans. Stephanie claimed she stopped selling the farts after excessive wind-breaking took a toll on her body and she was hospitalized.

 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Stephanie Is Revealing Her &#39;Biggest Fraud&#34; Yet 

 




In December 2023, Stephanie announced that she was going to release a Tell All book. She posted a video on Instagram where she teased she was releasing something “MASSIVE” on January 1, 2024, which was “bigger than farts in jars.” It appears users tried to guess what Stephanie was releasing and suggested that she could be selling her “blood” or her “used period pads or tampons” or a “fart sauna.” Stephanie mocked these fans who seemed to think they knew what it was going to be. She laughed about the fans having “no idea” about her secret.

Stephanie then showed them the physical copy in the video as she danced around in the house holding it. She mentioned that she would finally reveal the “biggest fraud” that she&#39;d done. Still, fans didn’t seem to react to the news with the same enthusiasm that Stephanie wanted them to. One fan accused Stephanie of using a ghostwriter. She told them, “haha i mean its my 2nd book and pretty sure its nowhere near good enough to be from a ghost writer.” Stephanie had written a book titled Mean Boys &amp; Memories: A Compilation of My Most Outrageous, Hideous and Embarrassing Stories back in 2015.
