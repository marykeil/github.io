It always seemed like major issues were going on behind closed doors regarding the dissolution of Amy and Matt&#39;s marriage. In her memoir, A Little Me, Amy alleged that Matt was involved with his girlfriend, Caryn Chandler, while they were still married. Caryn was a long-time employee who worked as the manager of the pumpkin patch. Amy&#39;s book solidified her gut feeling that Matt has cheated. Amy wrote, &#34;I saw messages, pictures, and other things that should not have been shared between people who just worked together and were still married to other people.&#34;

Matt has always denied the fact that he had an affair with Caryn, stating that the two began a relationship after the divorce. Amy has been more open regarding the multiple scandals within their relationship. After Matt and Amy&#39;s divorce was finalized, she often took to Facebook Live to share her insights about their issues, noting that she knew they had problems.

It was evident that the couple was unhappy for a while, as Matt would often leave during family vacations because he became annoyed with his wife. The patriarch would even try to shut down Amy&#39;s Roloff Farms ideas. One example was when Matt mocked Amy&#39;s pumpkin salsa idea but then tried to take credit for it when it became a bestseller.

Since Matt and Amy&#39;s divorce in 2016, the two Little People Big World stars have tried their best to remain amicable for their children&#39;s sake. Amy sold half the farm back to Matt and married Chris Marek. Matt and Caryn got engaged and now spend their winters together in Arizona. The series may show Matt and Amy in a good place, but they took years to get there.
