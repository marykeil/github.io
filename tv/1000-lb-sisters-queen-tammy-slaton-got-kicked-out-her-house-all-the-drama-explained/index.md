## Literature Review
1000-Lb Sisters is back on the air, and protagonist Tammy Slaton has more drama than ever. Find out more about where she&#39;s living now.




1000-Lb Sisters is back, and Tammy Slaton has caused a stir with her housing situation. As of December 2023, 1000-Lb Sisters season 5 has returned amid a challenging year for Tammy and her sister, Amy Slaton. Amy and her former husband, Michael Halterman, split up for good. Caleb Willingham passed away unexpectedly, and Tammy returned home to Kentucky. Unfortunately, things weren&#39;t smooth sailing amidst her grief. Tammy was arrested for drug possession just five days after Caleb&#39;s funeral.




With so much going on in Tammy and Amy&#39;s personal lives, there was ample anticipation for 1000-Lb Sisters season 5. The previous season saw Tammy losing over 300 pounds and marrying Caleb. Meanwhile, Amy dealt with life as a woman with two children and a marriage on the edge. Between seasons, the two women&#39;s lives fell apart. Unfortunately, Tammy hit another bump in the road with her housing situation.


 Amanda Halterman Forced Tammy Slaton Out 
          

According to the US Sun, Amanda Halterman, another of Tammy&#39;s sisters, owned the rental property where Tammy was staying and kicked her out. The pair had found intensely throughout the past few months, including at Caleb&#39;s funeral. One of Tammy&#39;s friends quoted the article as saying, &#34;She was renting it from her sister, Amanda... and they just do not get along at all. They fight worse than cats and dogs.&#34; While it&#39;s unknown exactly what the fight was about, the pair have had intense arguments, both on and offscreen, over the years.






 Tammy Slaton Moved In With Brother Chris Combs 
          

After getting kicked out by her sister, Tammy moved in with her brother, Chris Combs. The 1000-Lb Sisters star lives approximately 38 miles from Tammy&#39;s previous home in Sturgis, Kentucky. The house is equally modest, and Tammy allegedly moved in with Chris around November 2023. Chris and his wife, Brittany, welcomed a baby in August 2023, so adding Tammy to the household has likely been chaotic. Chris is often seen as a fan-favorite and has undergone a weight loss transformation.

Amy and Tammy have had chaotic lives since filming for 1000-Lb Sisters part 1 wrapped. While the second half has been highly anticipated, there&#39;s much to address onscreen. Apart from the death of Tammy&#39;s husband, Amy&#39;s separation, and Tammy&#39;s drug possession, Tammy is in a different home due to yet another fight with Amanda. Regardless of how much is seen onscreen, the 1000-Lb Sisters gave producers enough material to work with.
