## Literature Review
Captain Lee Rosbach doesn’t want a break after appearing on Below Deck for 10 years. He is ready to solve mysteries on another reality TV show.




Captain Lee Rosbach is joining a new TV show after exiting the Below Deck franchise in 2023. The 74-year-old reality star became popular when he partnered with Bravo and starred in the yachting-based reality TV series beginning in 2013. He was in his early 60&#39;s and seemed like just the right man to lead such a series. Unfortunately, things changed significantly as Captain Lee grew older and became less active. He faced major health issues during the filming of Below Deck season 10, which caused him to miss most charters. Thankfully, Captain Sandy Yawn helped him out by managing his crew members in the meantime.




When Captain Lee exited after Below Deck season 10, it almost seemed like viewers had seen the last of him. However, the famous sailor surprised everyone by recently securing a new TV gig. The former Below Deck captain will next appear on Deadly Waters, a show about murder mysteries in open waters. According to Deadline, the upcoming series is currently in the production phase. Deadly Waters is an Oxygen series, a network known for hosting true-crime shows such as Snapped, Killer Couples, and Three Days to Live. Production company Critical Content is working on the show. They are known for their work on Netflix’s Sly and much more.

 What Has Captain Lee Done Since Leaving Below Deck? 
          




Captain Kerry Titheradge, 48, is replacing Captain Lee in Below Deck season 11. The new season premieres on Bravo in February 2024. However, the major shakeup doesn&#39;t mean Captain Lee hasn’t done much since his exit. Besides the new show Deadly Waters, Captain Lee has been very active on social media. He previously joined former Below Deck chief stewardess Kate Chastain in her Couch Talk series. He also launched a podcast, Salty with Captain Lee, and released the first episode in September 2023. Captain Lee’s audio show has a staggering 4.8 stars on Apple Podcasts.


 

It’s good to see Captain Lee moving on and finding new gigs. The former Below Deck star is 74 and an inspiration to everyone around him. He has proved that age is just a number by becoming famous in his 60&#39;s and maintaining that popularity for the last 10 years. Bravo retired Captain Lee after he got sick in Below Deck season 10. He didn’t see the change coming but didn’t let it stop him from growing in the reality TV industry. Captain Lee is happier than ever and proved he no longer needs Bravo to stay connected with his loyal fans.




Unlike many Below Deck cast members who appear on other Bravo shows, Captain Lee is featured on something wholly different. He has earned himself a mystery-solving gig on a network that specializes in airing such content. While fans haven’t seen a preview of the new series, the premise already looks quite interesting. Captain Lee has decades of maritime experience. He has been a captain for a long time and will be able to showcase his skills by solving mysteries now. It will be interesting to see the former Below Deck star on Deadly Waters and what he does with the series.



Below Deck season 11 premieres February 5, 2024, at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
