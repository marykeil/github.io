Summary

  Dragon Ball fans can participate in the &#34;Secret Battle Hour&#34; tournament and vote for their favorite characters.   The tournament only includes characters from Dragon Ball Super, but fans can select two more characters from a poll.   The tournament will occur online, with matches starting on January 22 and the finals on January 28. Fans&#39; votes will determine the winner.  





Fans of the beloved Dragon Ball Super series will soon be able to partake in the &#34;Secret Battle Hour&#34; tournament. In it, audiences will cast their votes online for various franchise characters that will be facing off in tournament brackets. Secret Battle Hour starts ahead of the Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour, a major fan event occurring in Los Angeles on January 28 and 29.




Previous Secret Battle Hour events paired random characters for the tournament. However, to celebrate the release of chapter #100 of Dragon Ball Super, 2024&#39;s tournament will only use contestants from that series. Fans, however, will have a chance to select two more Dragon Ball characters from a poll.

          

The tournament will begin later on January 22 and will last until January 28, with the results announced during the Battle Hour event in Los Angeles. This year&#39;s lineup includes new powerhouses of the franchise, such as Cell Max, the Gamma Androids, and Orange Piccolo, but also the most powerful warriors introduced previously in Super, including Fusion Zamasu, Granolah, and Jiren.

According to the official Dragon Ball website, fans will get to vote from a pool of 20 characters, from Son Goku to Cell Max. While 18 of the positions have already been filled by Super characters, a poll running until January 12 will allow people to choose two more characters from a group of eight to join the tournament. Afterward, likes or reposts on the official Japanese and English Dragon Ball X accounts will determine the winner of each bracket. Matches begin on January 22 and will run until the Finals, which begins on January 28. It will be interesting to see who fans think is the strongest, considering the lineup includes Frieza, who recently annihilated both Goku and Vegeta in their strongest forms.

This online tournament prefaces the Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour, a physical event that focuses on the franchises&#39; video games, including Dragon Ball FighterZ, Dragon Ball Super Card Game (and the upcoming Fusion World, set to release in February), Dragon Ball Legends, and Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle. Other Dragon Ball-related panels will also occur, including one where Executive Producer Akio Iyoku will speak about the upcoming Dragon Ball Daima. January 27 will also feature a movie night where the recent Sand Land, based on Akira Toriyama&#39;s short manga series, will be played.




          

The selection of characters has a wide variety of favorites found in Super, so there is no telling who fans will back to be the ultimate winner of 2024&#39;s Secret Battle Hour. The previous edition of the tournament saw Gohan triumph, and while pure power and statistics might be valid reasons, the existence of Krillin in the poll means there could be a dark horse victory when the Finals end on January 29. If fans are interested in making their voices heard regarding who they think is Dragon Ball&#39;s strongest – or most popular – character, they won&#39;t have long to wait before they cast their votes later this month.
