## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games may have lost Josh Martinez in the show&#39;s most recent elimination, but BB viewers are ready to see him compete again soon.




Big Brother Reindeer Games brought Big Brother 19 winner Josh Martinez back into the spotlight after a long absence from the series, and many are surprised at how much they’ve enjoyed watching him. Josh was originally part of the Big Brother 19 cast, a season that was dominated by a large alliance started by runner-up Paul Abrahamian, who was returning for another shot at the game after taking the runner-up spot on Big Brother 18. Josh was a controversial winner but ended up getting five jury votes and winning his season before moving on to try his hand at The Challenge over the course of several different seasons and iterations.
After years away, Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 was a great opportunity for a houseguest like Josh to return to a condensed version of the game. Big Brother 25 may have been the longest season of the series to date, but its holiday-themed spin-off was filmed over the course of the week and will be a total of six episodes in the season. The series is a spin-off of Big Brother that focuses on competitions, utilizing social strategy and physicality to put the players to the test. At the end of the competition, only will win the $100,000 prize.









 








 3  Josh Martinez Was Polarizing On Big Brother 19 
        

While Josh was the winner of Big Brother 19, he wasn’t the most likeable player of the season. Known for his loud, brash personality along with the penchant for banging pots and pans together during arguments and moments of heightened emotion, Josh was unabashedly himself during BB 19. Many believe Josh was an immature player, and at only 23 when he entered the BB house, he definitely still had a lot of growing up to do. With his loyalty geared toward Paul and Christmas Abbott throughout the game, most feel Josh won against Paul due to a bitter jury who was angry about Paul’s many, many alliances coming to light.





 2  After Big Brother, Josh Took On The Challenge Franchise 


After his time on Big Brother, Josh took some time away and decided to return to reality TV on a different franchise entirely. He first participated on The Challenge season 33, which was called The Challenge: War of the Worlds. The season united veteran Challenge players along with other reality TV franchises like Big Brother and The Bachelor. Josh has participated in several seasons of The Challenge and competed on The Challenge: USA season 2. Though he has yet to win a season, he’s honed his reality TV skills and grown up throughout his time on the series.





 1  Josh Has Been Well Received On Big Brother Reindeer Games 
        

While he took a long time away from the franchise, Josh was meant to return to Big Brother for the second iteration of All-Stars, Big Brother 22. Unfortunately, Josh tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the houseguests entrance into the game so he wasn’t able to participate. After a long wait, Josh returned for Big Brother Reindeer Games and viewers noticed the shift in his personality. While Josh was still loud, he seemed happier, more mature, and more interested in the competition as a whole. With Josh’s most recent appearance on Big Brother Reindeer Games leaving viewers excited to see him compete and commentate, his elimination was a sad one.
