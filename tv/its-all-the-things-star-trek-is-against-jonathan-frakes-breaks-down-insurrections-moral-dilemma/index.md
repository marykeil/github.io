## Literature Review
Star Trek: Insurrection explored complex moral questions, inspiring interesting discussions for both the characters and the folks working on the film.




Star Trek: Insurrection feels like an extended episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and director Jonathan Frakes, who plays Commander Will Riker, has spoken about the classic Star Trek moral dilemma at the center of the film. Following the action spectacle of Star Trek: First Contact, Insurrection tells a quieter story about the small Ba&#39;ku village and the Starfleet officers who attempt to forcibly remove its people. Insurrection shows Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) standing up for what&#39;s right, but also allows the Enterprise captain and his crew to take a break from saving the galaxy and relax a little. 




Because of metaphasic particles in the nearby area of space known as the Briar Patch, the Ba&#39;ku people are effectively immortal. Starfleet Admiral Matthew Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) allies with the Ba&#39;ku&#39;s enemies, the Son&#39;a, to take control of the planet and collect the healing particles. Captain Picard objects to Dougherty&#39;s plan, disobeying direct orders from a superior officer to aid the Ba&#39;ku. Insurrection may not be as action-packed as the film that came before it, but it grapples with interesting moral and ethical questions. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Jonathan Frakes reflects on the moral quandary at the heart of Star Trek: Insurrection. Read his full quote below:


That element sparked a lot of discussion behind the camera. People saying &#39;What would you do?&#39; It became a very interesting, philosophical debate. Anthony Zerbe’s character of Admiral Dougherty came down on the side of &#39;F*** ’em, kill six hundred people. It’s for the best.&#39; And Patrick came down on the side of the Federation. It was quite interesting to hear the dialogue in front of the camera and behind it. It’s Bosnia or Zimbabwe. It’s where they sacrifice the few for the sake of the many, because the many happen to have bigger guns or more money or whatever the hell they have. It’s unethical, it’s immoral, it’s racist, and it’s all the things that we in Star Trek are against.

 Star Trek Is At Its Best When It Tackles Complex Moral Dilemmas 
Star Trek: TNG movies amped up the action.
   Close     

Star Trek: Insurrection may not have been the greatest Trek film, but it tells a classic Star Trek story that could have made a great episode of TNG. Since Star Trek: The Original Series began in 1966, the franchise has tackled ethical questions relating to race, gender, sexuality, prejudice, and everything in between. While some Star Trek episodes can be too heavy-handed in their message delivery, many of Star Trek&#39;s most celebrated episodes wrestle with complicated and relevant social issues. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Captain Jean-Luc Picard are heroes because they fight for what&#39;s right, even when faced with a court-martial or overwhelming odds against them.




Star Trek: Deep Space Nine goes even further, telling stories of darker ethical conundrums that have no good solution. When the Federation gets involved in an all-out war with the Dominion, Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) has to decide when and how he&#39;s willing to compromise his morals for the greater good. Modern Star Trek shows like Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds continue the trend of raising philosophical questions, as well. While this trend began long before Star Trek: Insurrection, the third TNG film serves as a solid example of the kind of moral discussions Star Trek loves to engage in.
