# 8 Great TV Show Couples That Were Not Initially Planned


## SUMMARY 


 Unexpected TV couples can become endgame if there is great chemistry between the actors and the romance fits the main plot. 
 Stiles and Lydia in Teen Wolf and Oliver and Felicity in Arrow were initially not meant to be couples, but audience reaction led to their eventual pairing. 
 Shows like How I Met Your Mother and Buffy the Vampire Slayer surprised viewers with well-suited couples that overshadowed the main relationships.

## Literature Review

Some of the most iconic TV couples, like Barney and Robin, weren&#39;t in the showrunners&#39; original plan, but destiny and chemistry brought them together.




A TV couple doesn&#39;t have to be the focus of the show from episode 1 to be entertaining and work well together. In fact, certain characters may need to grow and evolve to be worthy of each other, not to mention to be able to wholeheartedly commit to another person. That is the case with Barney and Robin&#39;s relationship in How I Met Your Mother — they weren&#39;t meant to get together, but they did, and it turned out to be the best decision the showrunners made until they went and ruined it in How I Met Your Mother&#39;s problematic finale.
In other cases, unexpected TV couples are so well-received by audiences that the creators make them endgame. It doesn&#39;t matter how a relationship starts, as long as the writing is amazing, there is great chemistry between the actors, and the romance itself makes sense in regard to the main plot.Friends&#39; Monica and Chandler had a messy beginning, but that didn&#39;t stop them from overshadowing even the series&#39; so-called main couple, Ross and Rachel, to some extent. Apart from Mondler, there are plenty of well-suited TV couples that weren&#39;t part of the original plan, but shined brightly in their shows.
            
 
 8 Beloved TV Couples That Are Likely No Longer Together 
Not every TV endgame couple would be able to stay together — Leonard and Penny from The Big Bang Theory are probably divorced by now.












 








 8  Stiles &amp; Lydia 
Teen Wolf


 







  Teen Wolf  


  Cast    Holland Roden , Tyler Posey , Dylan Sprayberry , Melissa Ponzio , Tyler Hoechlin , Arden Cho , Crystal Reed , jr bourne , Shelley Hennig , Colton Haynes , Dylan O&#39;Brien , Linden Ashby     Seasons    6    


Teen Wolf&#39;s Stiles and Lydia were one of the most popular ships from season 1, but it took six seasons for them to become official. The showrunners never envisioned these two as a couple, which was evidenced by their move to pair Stiles up with Malia. However, the audience&#39;s reaction to the magic that Holland Roden and Dylan O&#39;Brien created together on-screen was the deciding factor. Stiles and Lydia fit like two peas in the pod, and their friends-first dynamic proved it, so it is a shame that by the time of Teen Wolf: The Movie, Stiles and Lydia broke up.





 7  Oliver &amp; Felicity 
Arrow
        

  Arrow  


  Cast    colin donnell , Paul Blackthorne , Willa Holland , Susanna Thompson , Katie Cassidy , David Ramsey , Stephen Amell     Seasons    8    


Arrow&#39;s Felicity was supposed to be a minor character, but throughout eight seasons, she grew to be so much more. Even though the DC comic canon suggested that Oliver and Laurel should be the endgame couple, the show went in another direction on purpose. The reason for the change, of course, lied in the fact that Stephen Amell and Emily Bett Rickards had electric chemistry, and it would&#39;ve been a crime not to utilize it. All in all, everything worked out for the better, and Arrow&#39;s Oliver ended up with Felicity, who was the absolute fan favorite from the beginning.





 6  Andy &amp; Erin 
The Office
        

  The Office  


  Cast    Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski     Seasons    9    


Once Jim and Pam found their domestic bliss, The Office writers had to create a new plot-driving couple, and they came up with several. Andy and Erin were both latecomers to the show, destined to become the new Jim and Pam. Unfortunately, the later seasons of the series were too convoluted, and some of the characters&#39; development didn&#39;t make sense. While Andy and Erin were cute together at the flirting stage and during their first attempt at a relationship, it was completely understandable when Erin broke up with Andy in The Office season 9, given how awful Andy had become.





 5  Sheldon &amp; Amy 
The Big Bang Theory
        

  The Big Bang Theory  


  Cast    Kaley Cuoco , Johnny Galecki , Jim Parsons , Melissa Rauch , Mayim Bialik , Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg     Seasons    12    


Amy was supposed to be a one-off character in The Big Bang Theory season 3 finale, but the creators and the cast loved Mayim Bialik so much that they fought for her to be brought back. The actress had strong chemistry with Jim Parsons, so the series decided to explore Amy and Sheldon romantically — and it was the best thing that could&#39;ve happened. Sheldon finally found his intellectual match, who worshiped him, and it was impossible for him not to fall for Amy eventually. Not only did Sheldon and Amy get married, but they also transformed into an academic power duo.





 4  Barney &amp; Robin 
How I Met Your Mother


 







  How I Met Your Mother  


  Cast    Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget     Seasons    9    


Barney and Robin getting married wasn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s cards — Barney was a womanizer who didn&#39;t want to settle down, and Robin was the woman who always put her career first and was opposed to marriage as a concept. Yet, the writers tried out setting these two up and were surprised by Cobie Smulders and Neil Patrick Harris&#39; chemistry, as well as the viewers&#39; overwhelming response to the possibility of Barney and Robin as a couple. Somehow, these two made such perfect sense together that no other option, including Ted and Robin being the endgame relationship, could ever be good enough.





 3  Spike &amp; Buffy 
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
        

  Buffy The Vampire Slayer  


  Cast    Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters     Seasons    7    


After Angel and Buffy parted their ways, Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#39;s creators didn&#39;t plan to develop another vampire and slayer romance. Spike was only meant to be Drusilla&#39;s recurring sidekick who would be killed off in a few episodes, but things worked out for the better. James Marsters opened up the dimensions in his character that allowed him to have feelings, unlike other soulless vampires, and the actor&#39;s chemistry with the show&#39;s lead, Sarah Michelle Gellar, sealed the deal. Spike and Buffy had their problematic moments, but it can&#39;t be denied that their pairing was immensely popular with audiences.





 2  Chandler &amp; Monica 
Friends
        

  Friends  


  Cast    Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer     Seasons    10    


Ross and Rachel were the main couple of Friends until the season 4 finale, when Chandler and Monica took center stage. It is almost inconceivable that Monica and Chandler&#39;s hookup at Ross&#39; wedding was supposed to be a one-time thing that would never lead anywhere. Thankfully, the creators saw a great opportunity for what it was and changed their plans to incorporate Chandler and Monica&#39;s long-term romance. While Ross and Rachel were still solving their issues and denying their feelings for each other, the most unlikely couple on the show slowly went steady, tied the knot, and started a family.





 1  J.D. &amp; Elliot 
Scrubs
        

  Scrubs  


  Cast    John C. McGinley , Robert Maschio , Donald Faison , Christa Miller , Neil Flynn , Judy Reyes , Aloma Wright , Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Sam Lloyd , Ken Jenkins     Seasons    9    


Scrubs&#39; J.D. and Elliot had a lengthy road to their happily-ever-after, and, despite being an iconic TV couple now, weren&#39;t meant to be endgame at first. The creators wanted medicine and life lessons to be the focus of the series, but due to the pressure from the network&#39;s executives, they were forced to give in and add a bit of will-they-won&#39;t-they romance to Scrubs. J.D. and Elliot weren&#39;t always good for each other, and they had a lot of growing up to do before they could be truly together, but in the end, their love story was incredibly touching.
