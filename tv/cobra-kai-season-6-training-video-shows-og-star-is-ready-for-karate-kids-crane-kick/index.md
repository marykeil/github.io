Cobra Kai co-creator Jon Hurwitz shares a behind-the-scenes video as the final season of the popular dojo drama looms. Continuing the original Karate Kid movies, and complicating the characters of Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), the spinoff show introduced a host of new faces and brought back several franchise veterans. It was announced in January 2023 that Cobra Kai season 6 would be the show&#39;s last, but production on the final episodes was delayed by the Hollywood strikes, which led to a work stoppage for several months.




Hurwitz, who created the show with Josh Heald and Hayden Schlossberg, retweeted a video of Zabka training for Cobra Kai season 6. The actor looks ready if anyone tries to pull off another Crane kick against him.


 

In the initial caption of the tweet, Hurwitz wrote in part: “It’s all happening! Filming starts for Cobra Kai S6 this week!” However, the filming information has since been edited out.



Cobra Kai season 6 currently has no premiere date, but Schlossberg noted that it could arrive in 2024.





 What To Know About Cobra Kai Season 6 
          




It&#39;s known that the Cobra Kai season 6 cast will include a notable new member, as Dexter alum C.S. Lee will join the final season of the Netflix show. He&#39;ll play a familiar role that springs from the original Karate Kid movies, with Lee portraying Master Kim Sun-Young. As the character has been presumed dead, he had previously appeared only via flashbacks, first played by Jun Chong in The Karate Kid and then by Don Lee in Cobra Kai.



Master Kim is also the grandfather of Kim Da-Eun (Alicia Hannah-Kim), who was introduced in Cobra Kai season 5.




In their discussions of the Cobra Kai finale, the show&#39;s creators have promised that it will be surprising and exciting. But there have been hints, from both cast and crew, in addition to executives at production company Sony Pictures Television, that the world of Cobra Kai will carry on through potential spinoffs. But exact details on that front have not yet been unveiled.




                  Every Crane Kick In The Karate Kid &amp; Cobra Kai (It Only Missed Once)   The Crane Kick is the most famous move in The Karate Kid franchise. Not only has the Crane been repeated many times, it almost always works.    

Cobra Kai season 5 ended with Kreese (Martin Kove) breaking out of prison. He&#39;s likely seeking to get revenge after getting betrayed by his supposed friend Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith). But the way the scene plays out, with Kreese&#39;s angry look of determination, there&#39;s no telling what he might do on the warpath. With filming finally set to begin, that cliffhanger will be resolved.
