  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Big Brother Reindeer Games is a new competition show. Here are the nine Big Brother legends who&rsquo;ll be playing in this fun and festive game.</p>
<p>Big Brother Reindeer Games features nine Big Brother legends competing in fun and festive holiday-themed games. Unlike a regular Big Brother season, the contestants won&rsquo;t be living in the house, and there will be no live feeds. Instead, it will be a show with pre-taped competitions, rather than a social game. Julie Chen Moonves won&rsquo;t be hosting either, but Big Brother icons Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will serve as &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Elves,&rdquo; guiding the players through each episode.</p>
<p>Big Brother Reindeer Games will consist of six episodes. In each episode, the contestants will play in three competitions that will culminate in &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Showdown,&rdquo; which determines which player will be eliminated. Four players will compete in the December 21 finale. The winner will take home the $100,000 prize. Here are the nine Big Brother legends who will compete on Big Brother Reindeer Games, according to CBS.</p>
<p>: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now</p>
<p>Cody Calafiore
Big Brother 16, Big Brother 22 Winner</p>
<p>Cody Calafiore is a 32-year-old software sales rep from Howell, New Jersey. He got his start on Big Brother 16 when he was part of one of the most legendary Final 2 alliances in the history of the show - The Hitmen with Derrick Levasseur. With three Head of Household (HOH) and three Power of Veto wins, Cody was a frontrunner to win the whole competition. However, when he won the final HOH competition, he remained loyal to Derrick instead of taking Victoria Rafaeli to the final two chairs. He ended up placing second.</p>
<p>When Cody returned for Big Brother 22, the second all-stars season, he was determined not to repeat his past mistakes. He won the first HOH competition, and continued to dominate the game from there. He won four HOH and four Power of Veto competitions. He was the first player to ever win the Final HOH competition twice. Cody was crowned the winner of Big Brother 22 by a unanimous vote, only the second in Big Brother history after Dan Gheesling. Cody has since gone on to compete in The Traitors season 1.</p>
<p>Nicole Franzel
Big Brother 16, Big Brother 18 Winner, Big Brother 22</p>
<p>Nicole Franzel is a 31-year-old boutique owner from Ubly, Michigan. She&rsquo;s a three-time Big Brother player who got her start on season 16. Nicole went on to win Big Brother 18, and placed third on Big Brother 22. During Big Brother 16, she placed 7th, winning three HOH competitions. During Big Brother 18, she won two HOH and two Power of Veto competitions. She was only nominated for eviction at the very end of the game. In Big Brother 22, Nicole won one HOH and one Power of Veto competition. Nicole is now married to her fellow Big Brother 18 houseguest, Victor Arroyo, with whom she began a relationship after their season ended.</p>
<p>Frankie Grande
Big Brother 16</p>
<p>Frankie Grande is a 40-year-old actor from Los Angeles, California. He placed 5th on Big Brother 16, dominating the competition with an incredible amount of wins. He won five HOH and three Power of Veto competitions. If one includes his one Battle of the Block win, Frankie was tied with Janelle Pierzina and Michael Bruner for the most single-season wins with nine, a record that wasn&rsquo;t broken until Jag Bains won ten competitions during Big Brother 25.</p>
<p>Frankie went down in Big Brother history when he single-handedly and triumphantly won the Battle of the Block competition that his partner, Caleb Reynolds, tried to throw in order to evict Frankie. Frankie worked alone to emerge victorious against his fellow competitors, Donny Thompson and Zach Rance. In addition, for weeks on Big Brother 16, Frankie hid his true identity as singer and actress Ariana Grande&rsquo;s brother. However, he eventually revealed his secret to his fellow houseguests in an attempt to mend his relationships with them. Frankie was also a houseguest on Celebrity Big Brother 18 (UK).</p>
<pre><code>              8 Big Brother 25 Houseguests Who’d Be Perfect For Reindeer Games   Big Brother Reindeer Games will include one Big Brother 25 houseguest. Here's a list of eight contestants who'd be perfect for the competition series.    
</code></pre>
<p>Taylor Hale
Big Brother 24 - Winner, America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest</p>
<p>Taylor Hale is a 28-year-old motivational speaker from Detriot, Michigan. She made history twice on Big Brother 24 by being the first-ever Black female winner and the first houseguest to win the whole game and take home the America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest prize in the same season. Taylor had the ultimate underdog story because she began the game being bullied by her fellow houseguests. She was nominated for eviction six times, including three times in the first four weeks of the game.</p>
<p>Taylor won two HOH competitions while she was in the Big Brother house. However, it was her impeccable social game, including her iconic finale night speech, that earned her the win. Taylor overcame the extraordinary odds stacked against her in the game in order to become one of the most legendary winners in Big Brother history.</p>
<p>Cameron Hardin
Big Brother 25 - America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest</p>
<p>Cameron Hardin is a 34-year-old stay-at-home dad from Eastman, Georgia who was voted America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest on Big Brother 25. Cameron dominated the first half of the game, alternating between winning competitions and being nominated for eviction because he was seen as such a threat. Cameron won three HOH competitions, including the grueling Pressure Cooker endurance HOH competition, with an astonishing time of 13 hours and 49 minutes, just five minutes short of breaking the record set by Jennifer Vasquez in Big Brother 6.</p>
<p>Cameron also won two Power of Veto competitions. After being unanimously evicted from Big Brother 25, he fought his way back into the game by winning both the Resurrection Rumble and Do or Die competition. He placed 9th, after being nominated five times for eviction. Because of his extraordinary gameplay, Cameron was voted America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest.</p>

<p>Britney Haynes
Big Brother 12 - America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest, Big Brother 14</p>
<p>Britney Haynes is a 36-year-old real estate agent from Tulsa, Oklahoma. She&rsquo;s always been known for her quick wit and hilarious commentary. Britney is considered one of the best social gamers in Big Brother history. She placed 4th on Big Brother 12, winning one HOH and three Power of Veto competitions. During Big Brother 14, she returned as a coach, and then entered the game as part of a twist. She didn&rsquo;t win any competitions, and placed 8th on that season.</p>
<p>Josh Martinez
Big Brother 19 Winner</p>
<p>Josh Martinez is a 29-year-old content creator from Miami, Florida. He was one of the most surprising winners in the history of the show because he began the game by using annoying antics to rattle his fellow competitors. This included banging pots and pans while singing the circus song and dancing, and calling them &ldquo;meatballs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Josh eventually took the game more seriously and won three HOH competitions and one Power of Veto competition. In a shocker, Josh won the game over frontrunner Paul Abrahamian. Josh has since gone on to compete in five seasons of The Challenge, as well as The Challenge: USA season 2, so he has a lot of experience with reality competition shows.</p>
<p>Xavier Prather
Big Brother 23 Winner</p>
<p>Xavier Prather is a 29-year-old attorney from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During season 23, he made history as the first Black Big Brother winner. His six-person all-Black alliance, The Cookout, became iconic with their winning strategy, and they managed to make it to the Final 6. Xavier&rsquo;s quote, &ldquo;Welcome to The Cookout,&rdquo; is one of the most powerful and emotional statements ever to be made on Big Brother. During his time on the show, Xavier was known for his impeccable social game. He also won three HOH and three Power of Veto competitions. Xavier also competed on The Challenge: USA season 1.</p>
<p>Danielle Reyes
Big Brother 3, Big Brother 7</p>
<p>Danielle Reyes is a 51-year-old real estate manager from San Francisco, California. During Big Brother 3, she won one HOH and one Power of Veto competition. Because of her thoughtful strategies, she&rsquo;s considered one of the greatest houseguests to ever play the game. It&rsquo;s often said that Danielle came in second to Lisa Donahue because the jury wasn&rsquo;t sequestered, and its members were bitter about Danielle&rsquo;s Diary Room sessions. Danielle returned in Big Brother 7, the first all-stars season. She again won one HOH and one Power of Veto competition. She placed 6th. Danielle is regarded by many as the &ldquo;Greatest Player to Never Win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Brother Reindeer Games is a fun treat. Having these Big Brother competition beasts return to compete against each other is thrilling. Big Brother Reindeer Games will showcase even more of the competition skills of these Big Brother legends.</p>
<p>Big Brother Reindeer Games premieres Monday, December 11 at 9 p.m. on CBS.</p>
