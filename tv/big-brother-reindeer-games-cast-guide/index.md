## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games is a new competition show. Here are the nine Big Brother legends who&#39;ll be playing in this fun and festive game.




Big Brother Reindeer Games features nine Big Brother legends competing in fun and festive holiday-themed games. Unlike a regular Big Brother season, the contestants won&#39;t be living in the house, and there will be no live feeds. Instead, it will be a show with pre-taped competitions, rather than a social game. Julie Chen Moonves won&#39;t be hosting either, but Big Brother icons Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will serve as &#34;Santa&#39;s Elves,&#34; guiding the players through each episode.




Big Brother Reindeer Games will consist of six episodes. In each episode, the contestants will play in three competitions that will culminate in &#34;Santa&#39;s Showdown,&#34; which determines which player will be eliminated. Four players will compete in the December 21 finale. The winner will take home the $100,000 prize. Here are the nine Big Brother legends who will compete on Big Brother Reindeer Games, according to CBS.

 Cody Calafiore 
Big Brother 16, Big Brother 22 Winner
          

Cody Calafiore is a 32-year-old software sales rep from Howell, New Jersey. He got his start on Big Brother 16 when he was part of one of the most legendary Final 2 alliances in the history of the show - The Hitmen with Derrick Levasseur. With three Head of Household (HOH) and three Power of Veto wins, Cody was a frontrunner to win the whole competition. However, when he won the final HOH competition, he remained loyal to Derrick instead of taking Victoria Rafaeli to the final two chairs. He ended up placing second.




When Cody returned for Big Brother 22, the second all-stars season, he was determined not to repeat his past mistakes. He won the first HOH competition, and continued to dominate the game from there. He won four HOH and four Power of Veto competitions. He was the first player to ever win the Final HOH competition twice. Cody was crowned the winner of Big Brother 22 by a unanimous vote, only the second in Big Brother history after Dan Gheesling. Cody has since gone on to compete in The Traitors season 1.



 Nicole Franzel 
Big Brother 16, Big Brother 18 Winner, Big Brother 22
          

Nicole Franzel is a 31-year-old boutique owner from Ubly, Michigan. She&#39;s a three-time Big Brother player who got her start on season 16. Nicole went on to win Big Brother 18, and placed third on Big Brother 22. During Big Brother 16, she placed 7th, winning three HOH competitions.

 Frankie Grande 
Big Brother 16
          

Frankie Grande is a 40-year-old actor from Los Angeles, California. He placed 5th on Big Brother 16, dominating the competition with an incredible amount of wins. He won five HOH and three Power of Veto competitions. If one includes his one Battle of the Block win, Frankie was tied with Janelle Pierzina and Michael Bruner for the most single-season wins with nine, a record that wasn&#39;t broken until Jag Bains won ten competitions during Big Brother 25.

Frankie went down in Big Brother history when he single-handedly and triumphantly won the Battle of the Block competition that his partner, Caleb Reynolds, tried to throw in order to evict Frankie. Frankie worked alone to emerge victorious against his fellow competitors, Donny Thompson and Zach Rance. In addition, for weeks on Big Brother 16, Frankie hid his true identity as singer and actress Ariana Grande&#39;s brother. However, he eventually revealed his secret to his fellow houseguests in an attempt to mend his relationships with them. Frankie was also a houseguest on Celebrity Big Brother 18 (UK).

She made history twice on Big Brother 24 by being the first-ever Black female winner and the first houseguest to win the whole game and take home the America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest prize in the same season. Taylor had the ultimate underdog story because she began the game being bullied by her fellow houseguests. She was nominated for eviction six times, including three times in the first four weeks of the game.

Taylor won two HOH competitions while she was in the Big Brother house. However, it was her impeccable social game, including her iconic finale night speech, that earned her the win. Taylor overcame the extraordinary odds stacked against her in the game in order to become one of the most legendary winners in Big Brother history.

Cameron Hardin is a 34-year-old stay-at-home dad from Eastman, Georgia who was voted America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest on Big Brother 25. Cameron dominated the first half of the game, alternating between winning competitions and being nominated for eviction because he was seen as such a threat.

Cameron also won two Power of Veto competitions. After being unanimously evicted from Big Brother 25, he fought his way back into the game by winning both the Resurrection Rumble and Do or Die competition.

 Josh Martinez 
Big Brother 19 Winner
          




Josh Martinez is a 29-year-old content creator from Miami, Florida.

This included banging pots and pans while singing the circus song and dancing, and calling them &#34;meatballs.&#34;

However, Josh eventually took the game more seriously and won three HOH competitions and one Power of Veto competition. In a shocker, Josh won the game over frontrunner Paul Abrahamian. Josh has since gone on to compete in five seasons of The Challenge, as well as The Challenge: USA season 2, so he has a lot of experience with reality competition shows.

His six-person all-Black alliance, The Cookout, became iconic with their winning strategy, and they managed to make it to the Final 6.

During his time on the show, Xavier was known for his impeccable social game. He also won three HOH and three Power of Veto competitions. Xavier also competed on The Challenge: USA season 1.






 Danielle Reyes 
Big Brother 3, Big Brother 7
          

Danielle Reyes is a 51-year-old real estate manager from San Francisco, California. During Big Brother 3, she won one HOH and one Power of Veto competition. Because of her thoughtful strategies, she&#39;s considered one of the greatest houseguests to ever play the game. It&#39;s often said that Danielle came in second to Lisa Donahue because the jury wasn&#39;t sequestered, and its members were bitter about Danielle&#39;s Diary Room sessions. Danielle returned in Big Brother 7, the first all-stars season. She again won one HOH and one Power of Veto competition. She placed 6th. Danielle is regarded by many as the &#34;Greatest Player to Never Win.&#34;
