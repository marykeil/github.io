 What Happened In Undead Unluck Episode 15? 
An explosive start to the series&#39; second cour
          

In Undead Unluck episode 15, &#34;Under&#34;, it&#39;s revealed that Rip showed up to give Fuuko an Artifact which, upon Fuuko touching it, triggered a vision of God destroying the world. Rip claims that the vision is proof that there&#39;s no point in fighting God, so they should forget about it and make the world an ideal place for Negators. Rip then leaves while telling Fuuko and Andy that they should join Under, the true name of the Negator Hunters, but Andy refuses â€“ remaining adamant that so long as God was a living being, they could kill it.




Following Rip&#39;s departure, Fuuko and Andy met with Chikara to see if he had made a decision. Chikara told them about how, when Unmove first manifested, he had accidentally killed his parents with the ability, and after spending years looking for a way to make amends, he felt that Fuuko and Andy had both shown him how to do just that. As a result, he decides to join the Union. The Union then erases Chikara from the memory of every person in the world, and the episode ends with everyone preparing to take on the next set of quests from Apocalypse.

 Undead Unluck Episode 16 Will Reveal a Traitor To The Union 
The anime isn&#39;t slowing down as it rapidly approaches season 1&#39;s climax
          




Not much is known about Undead Unluck episode 16&#39;s story, but based on the preview, someone in the Union is going to be revealed as a traitor. One of the final shots in the preview shows someone in a Union uniform facing off against everyone with the UMA Burn, and with the episode title being &#34;Revolution&#34;, it&#39;s likely that someone is going to be revealed to have been working with Under. That would be a major twist to throw in this late into the season, and it will be interesting to see what Undead Unluck episode 16 does with the reveal.

Be sure to watch Undead Unluck episode 16 when it releases on January 26.
