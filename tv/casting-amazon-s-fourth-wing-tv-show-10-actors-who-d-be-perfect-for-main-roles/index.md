## Literature Review

Amazon is adapting Rebecca Yarros&#39; Fourth Wing books into a TV series, and the show must get the casting for the major characters right.




A TV adaptation of the fantasy book Fourth Wing is currently in progress, raising questions about who will be cast to star as the book&#39;s many fascinating characters. Author Rebecca Yarros has announced the Empyrean series will span five books, with two currently available. In collaboration with Michael B. Jordan&#39;s Outlier Society, Amazon MGM Studios has secured the rights to adapt Fourth Wing and its sequel, Iron Flame, into a TV series. However, the crucial casting decisions remain unannounced, a key aspect in successfully adapting any book.
Fourth Wing quickly became a hit on TikTok&#39;s BookTok community and reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list within 13 weeks. It is also one of the highest-rated books on Goodreads. The plot centers around Violet Sorrengail, a 20-year-old thrust into the Riders Quadrant at Basgiath War College by her mother to train as a dragon rider. With such a large fan base, it&#39;s crucial to cast Amazon&#39;s Fourth Wing TV show carefully so as to meet readers&#39; expectations and avoid disappointment.









 








 10  Madelaine Petsch as Andarna (Voice) 
Petsch starred as Cheryl Blossom in Riverdale.
        

Madeline Petsch is best known for her role as Cheryl Blossom, the chaotic, &#39;kill-them-with-kindness&#39; mean girl from Riverdale. Petsch&#39;s excellent portrayal of feigning innocence in the show is played up by her ability to pretend to be sweet. Although this was used for manipulation purposes in Riverdale, Petsch&#39;s sweet and high-pitched voice would be perfect for Andarna in Fourth Wing. Petsch&#39;s voice, coupled with her proven talent for portraying compelling characters, makes her an excellent choice for bringing the charming gold dragon to life.





 9  Idris Elba as Tairn (Voice) 
Elba starred as DCI John Luther in the BBC series Luther.


 







Arguably one of the most distinctive voices on screen today, Idris Elba is the perfect choice to play Tairn, the ancient, battle-hardened dragon from Fourth Wing. Idris Elba&#39;s movies and TV shows have consistently showcased his deep and captivating voice. It perfectly aligns with Tairn&#39;s century of wisdom and battlefield experience, giving an authoritative and commanding tone that embodies the dragon&#39;s no-nonsense attitude. Elba&#39;s voice, with its rich timbre and British accent, adds an extra layer of sophistication that would make Tairn a true character.





 8  Ella Balinska as Rhiannon 
Balinska starred as Jane Kano in Charlie&#39;s Angels.


 







Ella Balinska has demonstrated that she knows exactly how to handle an action role. Starring as one of the three formidable angels in Charlie&#39;s Angels (2019) and in Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of Resident Evil, it&#39;s fair to say she knows a thing or two about action sequences. This makes her perfect for the role of Rhiannon, as the cadets of Basgiath War College evade death every single day. A lot of the training scenes in Fourth Wing focus on hand-to-hand combat. An experienced action star, Balinska would be able to handle the scenes without any issues.





 7  KJ Apa as Dain 
Apa starred as Archie Andrews in Riverdale.
        

Best known for his role as Archie Andrews in CW&#39;s Riverdale, KJ Apa is an ideal pick to play Dain. In Fourth Wing, Dain&#39;s alliances are unclear, which could set him up as a potential villain in the later books. Throughout Riverdale, Apa adapts to the evolving nature of Archie&#39;s character. He navigates the transition from a more innocent, dreamy teenager to a more complex, sometimes brooding individual facing serious challenges. This showcases Apa&#39;s range as an actor and his ability to portray nuanced characters, which Dain could prove to be.





 6  Alexander Ludwig as Jack 
Ludwig starred as Cato in The Hunger Games.
        

It&#39;s hard to think of a better choice for a character that&#39;s all about hunting down and killing the protagonist than Alexander Ludwig, and that&#39;s all thanks to his frightening portrayal of Cato, the arrogant and lethal leader of the career tributes in The Hunger Games. Ludwig is excellent at embodying a menacing appearance on screen. As well as Ludwig&#39;s intimidating portrayal of Cato, he also starred as Bjorn in the hit series Vikings. Anyone terrifying enough to convincingly play a Viking is more than capable of capturing Jack&#39;s viciousness.





 5  Evangeline Lilly as General Sorrengail 
Lilly stars as Hope van Dyne in the MCU.


 







Evangeline Lilly is well known to audiences thanks to her work in the MCU. First appearing in Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly stars as Hope van Dyne, the tough, smart, and fearsome scientist who&#39;s well-trained in martial arts. Her time playing the hard-as-nails, resilient character means she is a great pick for the role of General Lilith Sorrengail. In Fourth Wing, General Sorrengail is the leader of the Navarre army who is able to wield the power of storms, making her a formidable force. With her experience portraying strong characters, Lily is more than capable of taking on the role of General Sorrengail.





 4  Adelaide Kane as Mira 
Kane starred as Mary, Queen of Scots in Reign.
        

Adelaide Kane&#39;s portrayal of Mary, Queen of Scots, in the TV series Reign, demonstrates her talent for playing cunning and commanding characters. Mary&#39;s character displays a mix of arrogance, conviction, and strategic cunning, which aligns well with Mira&#39;s character, described in the books as being arrogant, hard-headed, and fiercely loyal to her loved ones. Kane&#39;s roles often exhibit a strong on-screen presence, which is the perfect trait for playing Mira, who constantly commands respect and attention, particularly in her interactions with her mother.





 3  Zane Phillips as Liam 
Phillips starred as Dex in Fire Island.
        

Zane Phillips, with his impressive range and engaging screen presence, is perfectly suited to play the role of Liam in Fourth Wing. Liam&#39;s character, known for his loyalty, charm, and good humor, aligns well with Phillips&#39; demonstrated strengths in his acting roles. In Fire Island, Phillips plays Dex, a character who, despite his complexities, has a certain charisma and likability. Throughout Zane Phillips&#39; movie and TV roles, he has consistently demonstrated an innate ability to bring warmth to his characters, making him an ideal actor to capture Liam&#39;s lovable personality.





 2  Evan Evagora as Xaden 
Evagora starred as Romulan Elnor on the series Star Trek: Picard. 
        

Evan Evagora may not be as well known as other actors on this list, but he&#39;s definitely a star in the making. Best known for his role as the Romulan Elnor on the television series Star Trek: Picard, Evagora started acting only a few years ago after being found by a modeling agency. He is still new to acting, but his skills are clear from his roles as Elnor and Nick Taylor in the movie Fantasy Island. Evagora, an Australian actor, is of Cook Islands Māori and Cypriot descent.
This is important, as author Rebecca Yarros confirmed on her TikTok Account that Xaden is a person of color (POC). Yarros commented: &#34;Oh he definitely is [dark-skinned]. Every time I see him whitewashed in fancasting I always hear that Schmidt scene, ‘a white man? No!’ play in my head.&#34; Evan Evagora would be the perfect casting.





 1  Danielle Rose Russell as Violet 
Russell starred as Hope Mikaelson in Legacies.
        

Russell&#39;s experience starring as the lead in a supernatural series naturally means she&#39;s a great choice to play Violet in the upcoming Fourth Wing series. Having played the role of Hope Mikaelson in Legacies, she already has a lot of experience acting in magical and fantasy roles. As Hope, Russell has proven that she is adept at blending vulnerability with strength. This balance is crucial to Violet&#39;s character, as author Rebecca Yarros has confirmed that Violet has a chronic health condition. Russell is more than capable of taking on the challenge.
