# Why Sweet Home Season 2 Was So Different From Season 1


## SUMMARY 



  Sweet Home season 2 introduced new characters and expanded the world, deviating from the original premise.   The destruction of the Green Home building meant a second season would have to be a lot different.   Sweet Home season 3 will also be different from the first season, as the show continues to evolve and explore new storylines.

## Literature Review
Sweet Home season 2 was very different from season 1, including new characters, new locations, and storylines that are not from the webtoon.




Sweet Home season 2 was very different from season 1, from the characters it featured to the ones on the show. The first season of Sweet Home quickly put the series among Netflix’s best Korean shows, delivering a fun twist on the zombie and post-apocalyptic genres. Although the renewal of Sweet Home for seasons 2 and 3 was exciting, whether the show would be able to maintain its quality after a relatively self-contained ending remained to be seen.




Sweet Home season 2’s cast of new characters is only one example of how much the show changed. Hyun-su took a back seat during the new season, which focused on the military and the search for a vaccine. This abrupt shift in tone has led to some criticism of Sweet Home season 2, especially because of how long audiences waited to revisit their favorite characters.

                  Sweet Home Season 2’s Ending Explained: How Is THAT Character Back?   Sweet Home season 2’s finale sees surprising returns and tragic encounters, and it sets up the next chapter of Hyun-su’s story ahead of season 3.    


 Sweet Home Season 2 Was Mainly An Original Story 
Sweet Home season 1 covered most of the webtoon
         

Sweet Home is based on a webtoon of the same name, and while a lot of changes were made to the source material in the first season, it still followed the original story somewhat closely. The problem, however, is that Sweet Home season 1 covered the webtoon in its entirety. Sweet Home season 1, episode 10 partially matches how the Sweet Home webtoon ended, with the Green Home being destroyed and Hyun-su emerging from the wreckage. In other words, Sweet Home did not necessarily ask for a continuation, and any sort of sequel would have to be an original story.





 

The destruction of the Green Home building and the death of key characters could have made for a great series finale. However, by including cliffhangers like the mysterious return of Sang-won and leaving a lot of questions unanswered, Sweet Home made it so that a second season would be inevitable. With the success of Sweet Home season 1, the show was renewed for two new seasons right away. Although there were still a couple of storylines and characters from the webtoon that didn’t make it to the live-action adaptation, it was clear that Sweet Home season 2 would have to create its own story.



 Sweet Home Season 2 Introduced A Lot Of New Characters 
The show expanded its world beyond the Green Home residents
          




A couple of important characters died in Sweet Home season 1, but there were still a lot of fan-favorite names left for the second season to tackle. Even still, Sweet Home season 2 introduced many new characters, from heroes to villains, many of whom had originally nothing to do with the Green Home residents. The biggest difference between Sweet Home’s first and second seasons is the setting – whereas season 1 took place almost entirely inside the Green Home building, season 2 happened across many different locations. The new season expanded the world of the show with new, more convoluted storylines.

Considering that the Green Home was destroyed at the end of season 1, season 2 couldn&#39;t recreate the same character dynamics from the show’s debut. Additionally, even if there was another “Green Home” for the characters to live in, recycling the premise of season 1 could have come out as lazy and uninteresting. That said, Sweet Home season 2 did try to recapture some of the magic of the first season through “The Stadium,” where most of the protagonists were now living following the time skip. Even still, Sweet Home didn’t limit itself to the stadium and told a countrywide story.






 Don’t Expect Sweet Home Season 3 To Be Similar To Season 1 
The show is now way too different from its original premise
          

Sweet Home season 3 premiers in 2024, and even if there was time for the show to answer some of the criticisms the second season has received, it would still be impossible to recreate season 1&#39;s tone. The premise of Sweet Home’s first season can only work as the first chapter of a story because, from the moment the Green Home is destroyed, everything changes. The fact that Song Kang’s Hyun-su was barely in Sweet Home season 2 did not help, but hopefully, there will be more of the show’s main character in season 3. Considering how season 2 ended, Sweet Home will only become more different going forward.


 




From Yi-kyung’s daughter to the reveal of Ui-myeong’s identity, Sweet Home has grown way too convoluted for the show to ever recapture what season 1 did – which is not a bad thing. Even if Sweet Home’s first season remains the show’s best, the series should not try to recycle story beats just because they were successful. Many of Sweet Home’s new protagonists were quite interesting, not to mention how some concepts of the webtoon that hadn’t been addressed in season 1 have finally been acknowledged. In which direction Sweet Home season 3 will go remains to be seen, but it is shaping up to be even bigger and bolder than season 2.



Sweet Home is streaming on Netflix.
