## Literature Review

A Suits spinoff is in the works, and information about one new character in the show demonstrates how it can be better than the original series.




A Suits spinoff (or a continuation of any kind) was inevitable following the series&#39; resurgence on Netflix in 2023, and details about a character set to make their debut in the upcoming project prove that it is already learning from the original show&#39;s mistakes. The USA Network legal drama television series, created by Aaron Korsh, ran for nine seasons (and 134 episodes) before it ended in September 2019. However, only a few years later, the show was added to Netflix&#39;s streaming library and was introduced to a new and large number of viewers, leading to a resurrection of sorts.




Months following Suits&#39; impressive increase in relativity due to Netflix, Universal Television and NBCUniversal announced they were developing a spinoff. The upcoming show&#39;s working title is Suits: Los Angeles and is reported to be constructed in the same vein as how CSI: Miami and CSI: NY were offshoots of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (aka, the same premise but in a new location with new characters). Not much is known about the spinoff, other than that Korsh will serve as the showrunner, the setting will be at an entertainment firm in Los Angeles, and the description of the main character.


 Suits Is Finally Replacing Meghan Markle&#39;s Rachel In The New Spinoff 
          

Hollywood journalist Matthew Belloni obtained insider information about what the casting team of Suits: Los Angeles is looking for in the main character, Erica, and he revealed these specific details in his Puck newsletter. The description of Erica reads, &#34;30s, Black, SoCal native, and Harvard law alum. She&#39;s jockeying to be made Head of Entertainment. She&#39;s great at closing clients but struggles elsewhere. Smarter than everyone.&#34; Based on this knowledge, it appears as if the spinoff of the popular USA Network series is crafting a character similar to Meghan Markle&#39;s Rachel Zane.




As fans recall, Markle left Suits following the season 7 finale to focus on her royal duties and marriage to Prince Harry. Following her departure, the show never found a replacement for Rachel, and it ended only two seasons after she and Mike Ross married and moved to Seattle to work at a new law firm. However, the team behind Suits: Los Angeles is seemingly pulling inspiration from Markle&#39;s character to create their lead and looking for a replacement for Rachel years after her exit from the original series.

 Suits&#39; New Character Being Similar To Rachel Makes It More Exciting 
          

The idea of a Suits spinoff is intriguing in and of itself, given its resurgence on Netflix and the overwhelming demand for more stories set in its universe. However, Aaron Korsh is seemingly taking extra precautions to ensure that many will be enticed to watch the upcoming show (especially because it sounds like it won&#39;t feature returning characters) by constructing its lead character as a parallel to Rachel. The upcoming Suits spinoff should pay homage to the original and capitalize off its success, and it&#39;s already accomplishing that with its main character.






Suits is available to stream on Netflix and Peacock.
