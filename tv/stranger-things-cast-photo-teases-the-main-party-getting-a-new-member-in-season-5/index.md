## Literature Review
Season 5 of Stranger Things is finally in production, and one new cast photo suggests one character will have a bigger role in the final episodes.




After a series of delays, the final season of Stranger Things started filming in January 2024, and a new picture of the cast suggests that one actress introduced in season 4 may be promoted to a series regular for the last episodes. Season 4 dropped in May and July 2022, meaning that fans have been waiting almost two years to learn what happens next in the cursed town of Hawkins, Indiana. The previous finale ended on a cliffhanger, with Vecna seemingly completing his mission of merging the Upside Down with Hawkins as the characters look at their burning home. As a result, season 5 will likely feature a multitude of changes.




The cast of Stranger Things has continued to expand from season to season, whether viewers like it or not. So, the upcoming story will undoubtedly follow suit and feature more people joining the fight against Vecna/Henry Creel/One. The season will introduce new characters, season 4 newcomers may get more significant roles, and perhaps some familiar faces will return for the Netflix science fiction drama television show&#39;s final episodes. However, thanks to a released photo of the season 5 cast, one actress&#39;s promotion from recurring player to series regular is a significant possibility and all but confirmed.


 Stranger Things Season 5 Photo Hints Vickie Will Join The Main Group 
          

Netflix&#39;s X account posted a photo of the Stranger Things season 5 cast and crew, including Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Brett Gelman, Priah Ferguson, Jamie Campbell Bower, Cara Buono, Amybeth McNulty, Linda Hamilton, and the Duffer Brothers. All these actors were expected to return or were previously announced as new cast members (e.g., Linda Hamilton), but one face stands out amongst the rest — Amybeth McNulty, who plays Vickie in the series.





 

As a recurring cast member, McNulty&#39;s character was introduced as Robin&#39;s crush during the Stranger Things season 4 premiere. Vickie played the clarinet in the marching band at Hawkins High School alongside Robin. But Robin was too afraid to tell Vickie about her true feelings because she wasn&#39;t sure about Vickie&#39;s sexuality, so she kept her crush a secret (except from Steve, of course). Things in Hawkins soon started to spiral out of control as Vecna terrorized the characters, pushing Robin&#39;s dilemma to the side.

Toward the season&#39;s end, though, Robin learned that Vickie had a boyfriend named Dan, which crushed her. Dan later broke up with Vickie, and she approached Robin at the volunteer drive at the high school. The two teenagers made sandwiches for the homeless together, and it was evident that a spark existed between Robin and Vickie. Now, it appears as if Vickie will play a bigger role in Stranger Things season 5.






 Why Vickie Getting A Bigger Role Is Good For Stranger Things Season 5 
          

The best part of McNulty&#39;s presence in the Stranger Things season 5 photo is that Vickie&#39;s relationship with Robin will likely bloom in the upcoming episodes. After all that Robin has been through since she was introduced in season 3, she deserves a little bit of requited love in her life, and based on the season 4 finale, Vickie might reciprocate Robin&#39;s feelings. The picture indicates that McNulty could be promoted to series regular for the final episodes of the science fiction horror television show, which is a good sign for the development of Robin and Vickie&#39;s romantic relationship.

                  Stranger Things Season 5 Must Avoid 2 Huge Mistakes With Its Mystery Character   There’s been a lot of speculation about Stranger Things season 5’s mystery character, but the show must avoid two major mistakes with whomever it is.    






 Does Stranger Things Need New Party Additions In Season 5? 
         

One of the major criticisms of Stranger Things over the years has been that the cast has gotten too big, meaning that each character is now given limited time to grow in the episodes. The amount of screen time that original characters like Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Nancy, and so on has significantly diminished since season 1 as the writers continuously add new characters to the story (who are typically killed off by the end of each season). However, the final episodes should focus more on those who have been there since the start.

While McNulty&#39;s appearance in the season 5 cast photo is exciting because of the implication of the direction of Robin and Vickie&#39;s story, it&#39;s also a bit disheartening because the final season should mostly pay homage to the show&#39;s original characters. Only time will tell the magnitude of Vickie&#39;s role in Stranger Things season 5. But, hopefully, it won&#39;t impact other characters&#39; stories as the fans prepare to say goodbye.






Stranger Things season 5 will likely premiere in 2025, but Netflix hasn&#39;t announced a release date yet.
