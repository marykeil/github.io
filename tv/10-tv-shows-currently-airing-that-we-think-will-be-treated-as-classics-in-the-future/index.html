  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Shows with great writing, a strong premise, and complex performances have the potential to become timeless classics.
Popularity and quality alone are not enough for a show to become a classic; it also needs a dedicated following and innovative creative choices.
The White Lotus stands out as an examination of class inequality and has the potential for longevity due to its balance of dark themes and humor.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Creating a classic TV show is hard work, but with so many amazing shows on the air right now, there are plenty that are proving their quality.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know if a television show will stand the test of time and join the ranks of classic TV, but some shows exhibit such high quality from the start that there&rsquo;s no doubt they&rsquo;ll be remembered forever. With so many new shows premiering all the time, it can be difficult to search through the deluge of options to discover the true gems that will be watched for generations to come. However, when a show has great writing, a strong premise, and complex performances, there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s hit upon something special.
It&rsquo;s hard to define what makes a TV series a classic. Popularity and quality on their own are not enough. If a show is popular, that isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that the content will remain relevant in the coming years. However, a show written well with high production value might not be popular when it airs, which means even a fantastic show could fade into obscurity, or be canceled too soon. There must be enough of a following for the show to have the traction to produce several seasons matched with innovative creative choices that will hold up in the future.</p>
<p>10 Modern Classic TV Shows Everyone Should Watch
There are a fair amount of television shows that broke the mold, but a few series stand out from the pack, technically making them modern classics.</p>
<p>10  The Bear (2022 - )
Created by Christopher Storer</p>
<p>The Bear<br>
Comedy
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    June 23, 2022     Cast    Jeremy Allen White , Ebon Moss-Bachrach , Ayo Edebiri , Lionel Boyce , Liza Colón-Zayas , Abby Elliott , Oliver Platt     Seasons    2     Story By    Christopher Storer     Writers    Christopher Storer     Network    FX     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , Disney+     Directors    Christopher Storer</p>
<p>The Bear has been sweeping the awards season for work behind the scenes and the performances. Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri lead the dramedy that&rsquo;s been highlighted for its lightning-fast pace and anxiety-inducing scenes. Following the ins and outs of a restaurant kitchen in Chicago, The Bear came at the perfect time to fill a newly formed niche on television. Interest in food and food culture has never been higher due to the interest in celebrity chefs like the late Anthony Bourdain, and combining that with the familial tensions of a traditional drama makes the series easy to rewatch.</p>
<p>9  Fargo (2014 - )
Created by Noah Hawley</p>
<p>Fargo<br>
TV-MA
Anthology
Crime
Drama
Comedy
Thriller</p>
<p>Release Date    April 15, 2014     Cast    Billy Bob Thornton , Allison Tolman , Martin Freeman , Kirsten Dunst , Patrick Wilson , Jesse Plemons , Ewan McGregor , Carrie Coon , Chris Rock , Jessie Buckley , Jason Schwartzman , Juno Temple , Jon Hamm     Seasons    5     Story By    Joel and Ethan Coen     Writers    Noah Hawley     Network    FX     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu     Franchise(s)    Fargo</p>
<p>The anthology series based on the Coen Brothers&rsquo; 1996 film of the same name has distinguished itself as unique among the other offerings in the crime genre. Every season, a new mystery unfolds in the seemingly idyllic and polite society of the upper Midwest, traditional Minnesota. Though Fargo has to start fresh with every season, the show uses this challenge as an opportunity to constantly reinvent itself and introduce a stunning new cast of characters. So far, there&rsquo;s been no shortage of crimes for the series to mine its stories from, and no shortage of interest in the beloved show.</p>
<p>8  True Detective (2014 - )
Created by Nic Pizzolatto</p>
<p>True Detective<br>
Anthology
Mystery</p>
<p>Release Date    January 12, 2014     Cast    Matthew McConaughey , Woody Harrelson , Colin Farrell , Rachel McAdams , Taylor Kitsch , Mahershala Ali , Carmen Ejogo , Michelle Monaghan , Michael Potts , Ray Fisher , Jodie Foster     Seasons    3     Story By    NIC PIZZOLATTO     Writers    Nic Pizzolatto     Network    HBO Max     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , HBO Max     Directors    Cary Fukunaga</p>
<p>Season 1 of True Detective has been the most popular up to this point, kicking things off with an intriguing mystery and the fantastic duo of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. Not every season is as good, but the show is coming back with a vengeance, and asserting itself as a series that won&rsquo;t easily be forgotten. Crime dramas are exceedingly popular, but True Detective has always stood alone in being unafraid to dig into the darkest parts of humanity. Often coming across as an extended movie, the show lives up to HBO&rsquo;s reputation of producing top-tier TV.</p>
<p>7  The Last Of Us (2023 - )
Created by Craig Mazin</p>
<p>The Last Of Us<br>
Drama
Horror
Adventure</p>
<p>Release Date    January 15, 2023     Seasons    1     Story By    Neil Druckmann, Bruce Straley     Writers    Neil Druckmann , Craig Mazin     Network    HBO Max     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max     Franchise(s)    The Last of Us     Directors    Craig Mazin</p>
<p>With only one season under its belt, The Last of Us is redefining what video game adaptation can be, showing that both mediums can be an art. Starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey as Joel and Ellie, two people fighting to survive in the wake of the apocalypse, the show took creative liberties with the source material, which paid off enormously. Specifically, episode 3, &ldquo;Long, Long, Time&rdquo;, has received high praise from critics and viewers alike for its inclusion of a simple human love story among the ruins of society.
Looking ahead to season 2, the show only has one more game, The Last Of Us Part II, to develop into the remaining episodes, but with fans so invested in the work, and the world, it begs the question of whether the show will continue beyond the game. It would be a difficult task as the story the game provides has clear beats and definitive endings, but the series has proven it&rsquo;s capable of thinking outside the box. Either way, how long the show lasts will not matter nearly as much as the glowing reception and love from the viewers.</p>
<p>Last Of Us Season 2 Potentially Deviating From The Game Addressed By Pedro Pascal
The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal addresses the potential for season 2 to deviate from the game, indicating the likelihood of major differences.</p>
<p>6  Abbott Elementary (2021 - )
Created by Quinta Brunson</p>
<p>Abbott Elementary<br>
Comedy
Mockumentary</p>
<p>Release Date    December 7, 2021     Cast    Quinta Brunson , Tyler James Williams , Janelle James , Lisa Ann Walter , Chris Perfetti , Sheryl Lee Ralph , William Stanford Davis     Seasons    2     Story By    Quinta Brunson     Writers    Quinta Brunson     Network    HBO Max     Directors    Quinta Brunson     Showrunner    Quinta Brunson</p>
<p>Network television has had trouble competing with streaming TV in recent years, but Abbott Elementary is an example of a network sitcom that&rsquo;s doing everything right. The show follows the teachers of the Philadelphia public school, Abbott Elementary, specifically Janine Teagues, played by Quinta Brunson, who is also a writer, creator, and executive producer on the show. The writing is one of the strongest elements of the show, as are the performances that carefully balance hilarity with genuine empathy for the profession of teaching. Abbott Elementary will be remembered as a significant step in the evolution of sitcoms.</p>
<p>5  Shrinking (2023 - )
Created by Bill Lawrence, Jason Segel, &amp; Brett Goldstein</p>
<p>Shrinking<br>
Comedy
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    January 27, 2023     Cast    Jason Segel , Harrison Ford , Jessica Williams , Christa Miller , Michael Urie     Seasons    1     Story By    bret goldstein     Writers    Brett Goldstein , Bill Lawrence , Jason Segel     Streaming Service(s)    Apple TV+     Directors    Bill Lawrence     Showrunner    Bill Lawrence</p>
<p>Getting Harrison Ford to sign on for a TV series isn&rsquo;t easy, but it makes sense why the seasoned actor returned to the small screen for Shrinking. The series is bitingly witty and provides a much-needed insight into the growing industry of therapy and psychoanalysis. For a long time, these subjects were considered taboo, but with more people exploring and taking care of their mental health, Shrinking arrived just in time. Examining grief, honesty, and what people owe to each other, Shrinking is funny, smart, and has plenty of themes to explore in the coming seasons.</p>
<p>4  Poker Face (2023 - )
Created by Rian Johnson</p>
<p>Poker Face<br>
Comedy
Drama
Mystery</p>
<p>Release Date    January 26, 2023     Cast    Natasha Lyonne , Adrien Brody , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Stephanie Hsu , David Castaneda , Benjamin Bratt     Seasons    1     Story By    Lilla Zuckerman     Writers    Rian Johnson , Lilla Zuckerman     Streaming Service(s)    Peacock     Directors    Lilla Zuckerman     Showrunner    Lilla Zuckerman</p>
<p>Poker Face has been confirmed for season 2 thanks to the powerful actor-director combination of Natasha Lyonne and Rian Johnson. Best known for his mystery films, Knives Out and Glass Onion, Johnson has been lauded as a master of his craft and decided to put his skills to the test by reinventing the crime procedural. Lyonne&rsquo;s Charlie attracts trouble without trying, but her charm and willingness to help others make her a compelling and likable protagonist. The mystery genre is rife with possibilities, and Poke Face is ushering in a new era of comedy and crime.</p>
<p>3  The Righteous Gemstones (2019 -)
Created by Danny McBride</p>
<p>The Righteous Gemstones<br>
Comedy</p>
<p>Release Date    August 18, 2019     Cast    John Goodman , Danny McBride , Edi Patterson , Adam Devine     Seasons    2     Story By    Danny McBride     Writers    Danny McBride     Network    HBO Max     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max     Directors    Danny McBride     Showrunner    Danny McBride</p>
<p>Danny McBride stars in, writes, and produces The Righteous Gemstones, the latest on his list of satirical television about the worst people imaginable. The show follows the story of a family of greedy and ruthless televangelists with no faith in anything except the money they&rsquo;re making. Already three seasons deep and renewed for a fourth, the show has maintained its popularity despite the unlikeable characters. However, disliking the characters and watching them face the consequences of their actions, in the funniest ways imaginable, makes timely comedy a hallmark of modern television.</p>
<p>2  The White Lotus (2021 - )
Created by Mike White</p>
<p>The White Lotus<br>
Comedy
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    July 11, 2021     Cast    Alexandra Daddario , Fred Hechinger , Connie Britton , Murray Bartlett , Sydney Sweeney , Brittany O&rsquo;Grady , Natasha Rothwell , Jake Lacy , Jennifer Coolidge , Molly Shannon , Steve Zahn , Aubrey Plaza , Theo James , Haley Lu Richardson , Michael Imperioli , F. Murray Abraham , Tom Hollander , Meghann Fahy , Adam DiMarco , Will Sharpe , Leslie Bibb , Dom Hetrakul , Jason Isaacs , Michelle Monaghan , Parker Posey , Tayme Thapthimthong     Seasons    2     Story By    Mike White     Writers    Mike White     Network    HBO Max     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , HBO Max     Directors    Mike White     Showrunner    Mike White</p>
<p>A loose anthology with some recurring characters, and many recurring themes, The White Lotus is one of the better examinations of class inequality on TV. Featuring a revolving cast of fantastic actors, the series explores the contrast between the guests and the staff at luxury resorts around the world. The twist is that a person&rsquo;s death takes place at the start of each season, and the show goes back in time to slowly reveal the victim, the cause of death, and the events that led to that inevitable conclusion.
The White Lotus is more effective than other class satires because it shows that though the rich have more luxuries at their disposal, they&rsquo;re often just as unsatisfied with their lives. No one staying or working at these hotels is who they seem, and the secrets they&rsquo;re hiding are, more often than not, quite dark. The show has the capability for longevity because it balances the dark parts of these characters with plenty of jokes at their expense.</p>
<p>The White Lotus Season 3 Cast &amp; Character Guide
The White Lotus season 3 is poised to be the acclaimed HBO series&rsquo; biggest season yet, with several big-name actors added to its ensemble cast.</p>
<p>1  Severance (2022 - )
Created by Dan Erickson</p>
<p>Severance<br>
TV-MA
Drama
Mystery
Sci-Fi</p>
<p>Release Date    February 18, 2022     Cast    Christopher Walken , Tramell Tillman , Michael Chernus , Adam Scott , Britt Lower , Patricia Arquette , Jen Tullock , John Turturro , Dichen Lachman , Zach Cherry     Seasons    1     Story By    dan erickson     Writers    Dan Erickson     Streaming Service(s)    Apple TV+     Directors    Ben Stiller     Showrunner    Dan Erickson , Mark Friedman</p>
<p>With elements of sci-fi, comedy, horror, and grief, Severance delivers this to the audience in a package that keeps them guessing until the end. Adam Scott stars as Mark, a man who undergoes a procedure to separate his work life from his home life. He, and the other members of his office, don&rsquo;t remember they&rsquo;re outside life when they&rsquo;re at work and vice versa. This premise is rife with intrigue and allows the actors to showcase their abilities. It&rsquo;s clear that Severance effectively comments on the terror of a life devoted to work and the hardest parts of human existence.</p>
