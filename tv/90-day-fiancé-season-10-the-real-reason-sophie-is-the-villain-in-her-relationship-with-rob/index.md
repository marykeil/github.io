## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Sophie Sierra is creating unnecessary problems in her relationship with Rob Warne. Has she been the bad guy all along?




90 Day Fiancé star Sophie Sierra is intentionally trying to make things difficult for Rob Warne in their relationship. Rob, a 32-year-old model, and actor, and his 23-year-old fiancé Sophie star in season 10 of the reality TV show. They met on Instagram after Sophie discovered Rob’s profile on a page about mixed-race men. Their relationship blossomed into something stronger as they started chatting online. Sophie stayed with Rob in Mexico and then at his Los Angeles house for some time before they parted ways during the pandemic. This was a rough phase for the couple, who came close to splitting.




Rob had responded to an Instagram account by exchanging naughty videos. Sophie was contacted by the account holder, who exposed Rob&#39;s activities. Sophie didn’t break up with Rob but did hold a grudge against him. When Sophie suggested they get engaged and apply for a K-1 visa, Rob agreed, and she moved to the U.S. from London. In America, Sophie has complained about Rob’s neighborhood, his house, and the lack of a bathroom. She was not able to trust Rob fully and went through his phone to discover he was getting inappropriate messages again. Sophie moved out of Rob’s house immediately, but he was able to win her over.

 Sophie Knew Rob Had Never Cheated On Her 
          

Sophie was talking to her mom in episode 8 when she told her, “I know he wasn’t really cheating.” Sophie revealed that she tracked Rob’s phone without his knowledge and saw that he was always just in his house. Sophie had felt unsafe while she was in a taxi three years ago, and she and Rob had shared locations to make sure she was safe. “And then he stupidly never turned his off.” Sophie never told him about it and could track his phone the entire time. “He still doesn’t know I have his location,” Sophie told her producers. Sophie then admitted, “That’s how I know he’s never cheated in real life.”






 Sophie Threw Rob Under The Bus For Her Personal Agenda 
          

Sophie and Rob went on a bowling date where they met up with their friends Tor’i and Ty. Tor’i had caught Sophie using a dating app when she came to America for the first time. Sophie insisted she was using the “friend” side of Bumble. However, Tor’i was always suspicious of Sophie’s intentions. Tor’i confronted Sophie at the bowling alley by asking her, “Hey, Sophie, What&#39;s all this going through phone stuff?” He asked her why she was going through his friend’s phone. Sophie asked Tor’i “Because, did he not tell you what he did?” Sophie told Tor’i that Rob was using Snapchat to get nudes and videos from girls, and he was sexting them back.

Tor’i turned to Rob to say, “Bro, you ain’t telling us all that you was asking for the *** and *******?” Rob, in his defense, asked if he should have been diving into every detail of what had happened. Tor’i slammed Rob for giving him only half the story. He admitted he had formed a negative opinion of Sophie based on what Rob had told him. Rob, in turn, claimed he’d told Tor’I that he was in the wrong and Tor’i shouldn’t have formed an opinion. Sophie said what she did was wrong, but she wanted to make sure she had no reason to resent Rob.






 Sophie Was Hiding Her Sexuality From Rob 

 

Rob felt like everything that he had done to fix the situation had now gone in vain. What Rob didn’t know was that Sophie was hiding a secret that could potentially end their 90 Day Fiancé relationship. She told Rob she is bisexual (as shared by AcessHollywood) during the episode while assuring him that he didn’t ever have to worry about her cheating on him with another woman. He asked what Sophie being bisexual would mean for their relationship. In the past, Sophie had suggested that she would be open to experimenting with women if Rob didn’t object to it. It appears Sophie wants Rob to be the bad guy in the relationship.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
