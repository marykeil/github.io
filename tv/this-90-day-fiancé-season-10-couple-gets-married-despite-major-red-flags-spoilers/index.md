## Literature Review
It&#39;s being reported that a shocking 90 Day Fiancé season 10 couple is now married, but viewers are disappointed after hearing their news.




90 Day Fiancé fans will be surprised to know that the couple they least expected to stay together is now married. 90 Day Fiance season 10 introduced six new couples, along with returning couple Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda. Gino and Jasmine from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days are one of the most toxic couples in the franchise at the moment, given how many times they&#39;ve split after scary arguments, only to get back together. Gino and Jasmine shockingly got married, according to recent reports, and another pair from the season also made it down the aisle.




90 Day Fiancé couple Seungdo Ham aka Nick and Devin Hoofman have tied the knot.


 

The Korean man and Searcy, Arkansas, resident said, &#34;I do,&#34; on April Fools&#39; Day in 2023. Their wedding ceremony was attended by 100 guests on April 1. &#34;We are most excited about our partnership in building a life together,” Devin told People. She said that she and Nick aren&#39;t sure &#34;right now&#34; about what their future looks like, but they are &#34;excited to see what happens and what we build.” Devin likes that being married “means no more distance and separation.&#34;


 90 Day Fiancé Fans Shocked By Devin &amp; Nick&#39;s Wedding 
          




Nick, who&#39;s originally from South Korea, was working in Australia when he met Devin on a dating app. They were together for two years before a homesick Devin flew back home. They decided not to let the distance hamper their relationship; they filed for a K-1 visa so Nick could move to the U.S. Nick and Devin had to seek the blessings of his parents before their wedding. Once Nick&#39;s parents approved of Devin, he came to America, only to realize he didn&#39;t fit in. Devin&#39;s parents tried their best to make Nick a part of their family. However, Nick insulted Americans by saying they were &#34;fat&#34; and ate &#34;greasy food&#34; and called Devin &#34;piggy&#34; by touching her belly.

Nick didn&#39;t show any regret when Devin&#39;s father pointed out that it was the wrong thing to do. He believed Devin liked being called &#34;piggy,&#34; so he used it as a term of endearment because she was a &#34;little chubby,&#34; according to him. &#34;I couldn’t imagine marrying someone that called me a pig and actually meant it,&#34; an annoyed fan wrote on Instagram. &#34;I’d never marry a guy who called me piggy and squeezed my belly​​​​​​,&#34; wrote someone else. Fans are finding it hard to understand why Devin would want to spend the rest of her life with a man who constantly body-shames her.




Devin was more worried about having ordered the wrong colored hanbok as her wedding dress instead of worrying about her fiancé&#39;s problematic views. Still, Devin is now Mrs. Ham and it&#39;s too late for her to go back. Devin has also lost over 25 pounds since she filmed 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Nick&#39;s body-shaming comments likely affected her, causing Devin to lose weight rapidly so she could lose her &#34;piggy&#34; nickname.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
