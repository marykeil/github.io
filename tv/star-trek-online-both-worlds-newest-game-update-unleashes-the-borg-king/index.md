## Literature Review
Star Trek Online: Both Worlds introduces the Borg King in an epic new multiverse storyline continuing the incredibly successful MMORPG.




Star Trek Online: Both Worlds unleashes the Borg King! Gearbox Publishing and Cryptic Studios announced today that Star Trek Online: Both Worlds, the 31st season of their long-running free-to-play Star Trek MMORPG, will launch on January 23 for PC and will arrive on PlayStation and Xbox consoles on March 12. Star Trek Online: Both Worlds continues last seasonâ€™s multiverse story as they must face the Borg King, the architect behind the threat facing the multiverse.




Following Star Trek Online&#39;s prior season&#39;s misunderstanding with the Tholians and the tearing of the Reality Vortex, the Borg from the Mirror Universe threaten the multiverse. In Star Trek Online&#39;s new update, players must infiltrate the Mirror Borg Unicomplex, a technological labyrinth guarded by relentless Borg, to sever the vortex and save the multiverse. At the heart of this nightmare awaits the Borg King, the architect of this multiversal threat. In addition, players will encounter Star Trek franchise characters like Captain Ezri Dax (voiced by Nicole de Boer from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Captain Harry Kim (voiced by Garret Wang from Star Trek: Voyager), and Admiral Kuumaarke (voiced by Kipleigh Brown from Star Trek: Enterprise).

Star Trek Online celebrates its 14th anniversary in January 2024. To thank players for their continued support over the last 14 years, this milestone will be commemorated with the return of the beloved Anniversary Event. More details of the Anniversary Event will be revealed in the coming weeks via a developer blog.




                  Star Trek Online &amp; Resurgence Video Game Creators On Crossover Appeal   Screen Rant interviews Star Trek Online&#39;s Al Rivera &amp; Thomas Marrone &amp; Star Trek: Resurgence&#39;s Dan Martin &amp; JD Straw about their games crossing over.    


 Star Trek: Picard Made Star Trek Online&#39;s USS Enterprise-F Canon 
The Odyssey Class Enterprise-F appeared in Picard season 3.
         

Star Trek Online is not just popular with fans but also with the creative teams behind Star Trek on Paramount&#43;&#39;s TV series. Star Trek: Picard season 3 honored Star Trek Online by making the USS Enterprise-F canon. The Odyssey Class starship appeared in Picard season 3, episode 9, &#34;Vox&#34;, as the soon-to-be-decommissioned flagship of the United Federation of Planets commanded by Admiral Elizabeth Shelby (Elizabeth Dennehy). Tragically, the Enterprise-F and the rest of Starfleet assembled on Frontier Day were assimilated by the Borg and nearly destroyed Earth until the Borg were stopped by Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the USS Enterprise-D.




The USS Enterprise-F was a design from Star Trek Online that is now enshrined in official Star Trek movies and TV canon. In addition, Star Trek Online recently crossed over with another hit video game, Star Trek: Resurgence. The Centaur Class USS Resolute, Star Trek: Resurgence&#39;s hero ship, is now a playable skin on Star Trek Online. With Star Trek Online: Both Worlds, however, the long-running Star Trek MMORPG is poised for a multiverse-shattering adventure that will deliver a gaming experience that Star Trek&#39;s movies and TV series can&#39;t match.



Star Trek Online: Both Worlds is available to play on PC on January 23 and on PlayStation and Xbox consoles on March 12.
