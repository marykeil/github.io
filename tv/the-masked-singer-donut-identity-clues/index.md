&#34;Hooked On A Feeling&#34; By Blue Swede

When he first came out on stage, Nicole commented that he was tall, while Robin said that he was a big guy. Jenny agreed that he was &#34;huge.&#34; Donut sang and danced joyously, captivating the audience.

Donut&#39;s clue package began with him in a Western scene. He said, &#34;I&#39;ve been really lucky in my career. I was part of a mega-hit that catapulted me to number one. But it also put me in a box, and people only associated me with this one rough and tough flavor.&#34; A badge was then shown. Donut continued, &#34;But I&#39;m actually a well-rounded donut, and it was my more refined side that helped this country boy get out of Dodge.&#34; An orange flag with &#34;LA&#34; printed on it was seen blowing in the wind. As Donut walked down the street, he stood in front of a building with a sign that said, &#34;Wild West.&#34;

Donut then appeared on a city street saying, &#34;Yes, since I was young, I&#39;ve been a connoisseur of the theaters from Chicago to 42nd Street.&#34; A lit-up sign on one of the buildings said, &#34;Open&#34; and &#34;Today&#39;s Music Bar,&#34; and was decorated with a blue neon sign of cowboy boots. Donut went on to say, &#34;I&#39;ve been known to pour my heart into a song or two.&#34; A food truck with an umbrella that said, &#34;Mr. Grill,&#34; was then shown.




Donut continued, &#34;After the toughest year of my life, getting back to my roots is exactly what I need right now.&#34; A lit-up advertisement for The Masked Singer that said, &#34;Who is under the mask?&#34; then appeared on the screen. Donut then said, &#34;There is nothing more healing than a stage and a song.&#34; A neon sign of a bow and arrow was then shown with the full moon in the background. Donut then spun around in the city street, looking at all of the signs on the buildings. He concluded with, &#34;And, tonight, I am feeling so grateful to get to share my whole heart with you all. It&#39;s gonna be sweet.&#34;

After Donut&#39;s performance, another clue was given. The Masked Singer One Hit Wonders karaoke machine played the classic song, &#34;How Bizarre,&#34; by OMC. Donut explained, &#34;You know what&#39;s bizarre? Me being on One Hit Wonder Night. Because, just like Rocky, I&#39;ve got hit after hit after hit.&#34;

And, boy, was I right. I&#39;ve been really fortunate in my life. I&#39;ve gotten to live out a billion dreams. From movies to music to marrying my soulmate, life has been pretty sweet.&#34; As Donut walked through the diner, he passed by a film slate that said, &#34;#1.&#34;

Donut continued, &#34;For decades, I&#39;ve been entertaining you. But, recently, I&#39;ve been keeping more to myself because the love of my life is no longer here, and it has left a huge hole in my heart.&#34; Two photographs of Donut and his donut wife were shown together. In one picture, there was an orange Dodge Charger with arms with fists. He explained, &#34;We did everything together. We had the same dream of owning a studio, and we actually did.&#34; Donut cried as he said, &#34;I still can&#39;t believe she&#39;s gone. And most days I just feel ... lost.&#34; As he said this, he sat down to eat a giant bowl of peaches.




Donut added, &#34;But I try to honor her memory every day by doing something brave.&#34; At that point, he held a limited edition comic book titled, &#34;Donut Adventures.&#34; He explained, &#34;It&#39;s the whole reason I&#39;m here. And it makes me smile knowing just how much she would love it.

Donut added, &#34;When I was a young man, I actually had the opportunity to sing this song as a duet with Ray on a television special.&#34; An old television set with a clip from the Ray Charles duet was shown, with Donut in place of the other artist&#39;s actual identity.

Now, remember, he was not a big guy, but, when he opened his mouth to sing, he could knock you over with his power.&#34; A red toy dragon on a film canister was then shown.

Donut went on to say, &#34;And watching videos of our performance now, I realize I was way out of my league.&#34; He chuckled. Donut concluded with, &#34;So tonight, I&#39;m hoping to make Ray proud.

 Donut&#39;s The Masked Singer Season 10 Finale Performances &amp; Clues 
&#34;You Are So Beautiful&#34; By Joe Cocker, &#34;Drift Away&#34; By Dobie Gray

 

The Masked Singer season 10 finale kicked off with a performance from the four finalists--Donut, Cow, Gazelle, and Sea Queen. They took the stage together for the first time, singing an exciting rendition of &#34;What I Like About You&#34; by The Romantics. Donut later sang a heart-wrenching version of &#34;You Are So Beautiful&#34; by Joe Cocker that brought the panelists to tears.




In his Masked Singer season 10 finale night package, Donut said, &#34;I came into this competition at the lowest point in my life. But I tell ya, as soon as I saw that Donut mask, his smile made me happy in a way I had not felt in a long time. And I knew, right then and there, becoming the Donut was what I needed to heal from my wife&#39;s passing.&#34;

Donut shared, &#34;I know that she&#39;s getting a big kick out of me in this Donut costume because, every Saturday morning, I would make the coffee, and my wife would go out and get donuts. And an apple fritter, especially for me. In fact, her nickname for me was, &#39;Fritter.&#39; I still miss her more than I can possibly say, but putting on this costume every night has helped me remember all the beautiful memories we had together.&#34; Donut concluded by saying, &#34;And tonight, under this mask, I&#39;m finally smiling again, just like she always was.&#34;

After Sea Queen and Gazelle were unmasked and revealed to be Macy Gray and Janel Parrish, respectively, Donut and Cow competed against each other for the Golden Mask Trophy. Donut&#39;s second finale night package again looked back at his journey on the show, and how it helped him honor the love of his life. Donut said, &#34;This has been a really great experience being here because most people don&#39;t know that I love to sing. My wife would say, &#39;I don&#39;t understand why you have done 18, 19 albums, have five number one songs, ten or 15 Top 10 songs. There was a lot of stuff, and nobody knows that you sing.&#39;&#34;




Donut continued, &#34;So a couple of years ago, she said, &#39;Hey, Baby, one of these days we&#39;re gonna get you on The Masked Singer, so people can finally see what you can do. So, um, this is really a dream-come-true for me because I can honor her through doing it.&#34;

Donut added, &#34;Every performance has been a love letter to her, and I know she&#39;s been with me on that stage every step of the way. I know if she could see me now--and I believe she can see me now--my wife would say, &#39;You&#39;ve gotta go out here and you&#39;ve gotta win this.&#39; And I&#39;m gonna try. I&#39;m gonna try, and it&#39;ll be for her. It&#39;ll be for My Smile.&#34;

For Donut&#39;s final performance, he sang a rousing rendition of &#34;Drift Away&#34; by Dobie Gray. He danced with the panelists, and enthralled the audience. After Donut&#39;s performance, when Nick asked him what winning The Masked Singer would mean to him, he replied, &#34;Oh my goodness. God knows that I could really, really use a little joy in my life right now. And winning would give me great, great, great joy.&#34;

 After Donut&#39;s One Hit Wonders Night performance, the Masked Singer panelists made some guesses about his identity. Nicole wondered if he could be Sylvester Stallone. Ken agreed with Nicole, saying that Donut might be an actor who could sing, and he guessed Jeff Bridges. Jenny was leaning more toward &#34;amazing vocal artist legends,&#34; and thought that Donut might be Tom Jones. Robin agreed with Jenny and was confident that her guess was correct because of Donut&#39;s vibrato.

The Masked Singer panelists&#39; guesses on Trolls Night were a bit different after they learned that Donut had lost his wife. Ken guessed Stanley Tucci, while Robin thought that he might be Liam Neeson. However, Robin then said that he still thought that Donut was Tom Jones because of his vocal and vibrato. Nicole theorized that Donut might be her good friend, Engelbert Humperdinck.




On the Soundtrack to My Life Night, the panelists had more guesses for Donut. Robin stuck with his original guess of Tom Jones, while Nicole continued to think that he was Engelbert Humperdinck. However, Jenny had a new guess, which Ken liked - John Schneider.

During the Masked Singer season 10 finale, the panelists gave their final guesses for Donut&#39;s identity before he was unmasked. They included Tom Jones (Robin and Ken), Engelbert Humperdinck (Nicole), and John Schneider (Jenny). Jenny was the only panelist who guessed Donut correctly.

The role that he played with a badge referred to John&#39;s role as Beauregard &#34;Bo&#34; Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard from 1979-1985. The bow represented his character&#39;s name. When Donut said, &#34;get out of Dodge,&#34; he was referring to the orange 1969 Dodge Charger driven by the characters on the show. It was also shown in one of Donut&#39;s photographs, with its &#34;dukes&#34; up. The peaches were a reference to the fact that The Dukes of Hazzard took place in Georgia.




The theater clues referred to John&#39;s performances in the Broadway revival of Chicago and the Pittsburgh CLO revival of 42nd Street. He also played Jonathan Kent on Smallville, which explained the comic book clue.

The Egyptian sarcophagus clue referred to John&#39;s voice work as Rick O&#39;Connell in the animated series, The Mummy. The dragon clue referenced his role as The Colonel in the film, The Dragon Unleashed.

When John talked about the &#34;toughest year&#34; of his life, he was referring to the death of his wife, Alicia Allain, on February 21, 2023. She passed away at age 53 due to breast cancer. John&#39;s nickname for his wife was &#34;My Smile.&#34; In addition, John owned a studio called John Schneider Studios.

As Donut, John was an incredible performer who brightened the Masked Singer stage. He was so vulnerable as he shared his love for his late wife, and he made such an important impact on everyone. John sweetened the competition with his performances as Donut. His unmasked performance of &#34;Hooked On a Feeling&#34; was triumphant. John was one of the most authentic and best performers ever to grace The Masked Singer stage.
