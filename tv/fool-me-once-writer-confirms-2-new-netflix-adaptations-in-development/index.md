## Literature Review
Fool Me Once author Harlan Coben confirms that more of his bestselling novels are getting Netflix adaptation following the show&#39;s massive success.




Fool Me Once writer Harlan Coben confirms that further adaptations are in the works at Netflix. Based on the bestselling novel of the same name, the Netflix series is about a widowed mother named Maya whose world is shared when she sees an image of her dead husband on her toddler’s nanny camera. Created by Daniel Brocklehurst, Fool Me Once features the leading cast of Michelle Keegan, Adeel Akhtar, Richard Armitage, and Emmett J. Scanlan.




Now, Coben confirms to RadioTimes.com that two new adaptations are in development at Netflix. He mentioned they “still have a few” books left to cover. The author stated that a project based on his book Just One Look is being developed in Poland. He also mentioned another project in South America but didn&#39;t specify the details. Check out the full quote from Coben below:


We still have a few [books] left! We’re doing one right now in Poland based off my book Just One Look, we’re filming and Netflix Poland is working on. Also working on one in South America, believe it or not.
There’s no doubt that if Netflix wants us back, which hopefully everyone watching will make this happen, I’ll be working with Nicola [Shindler], Richard [Fee] and Danny [Brocklehurst] on at least another one or two. We want to keep this going, we love this kind of yearly thing if we can.



 This News Could Mean A Harlan Coben Adaptation Renaissance 
         




Fool Me Once was released on the first day of 2024 on Netflix. Since then, the mystery thriller became instantly popular, topping the Netflix Global Top 10 chart for television in its first week on the platform. The success stems from the interesting characters and plot twists, causing an online discourse that further cemented the show’s popularity.

While Fool Me Once is likely the most popular TV show for a Coben adaptation, the author has a history with his work being adapted. Last year, Prime Video released Harlan Coben&#39;s Shelter, another mystery series based on the novel of the same name. After the novel’s release in 2011, Shelter received a follow-up novel, Seconds Away, leaving room for the Prime Video TV series to explore more of its plot. Despite receiving decent reviews, Shelter season 2 did not transpire as it was canceled after a single season.

                  Fool Me Once Ending Explained: What Happened To Joe &amp; Claire   Netflix&#39;s Fool Me Once weaves together a mystery story with an ending that answers questions like, &#34;What happened to Joe and Claire?&#34;    




Between Fool Me Once and the other adaptations in the works, it seems that 2024 could be a comeback year for Coben. The author is already a bestselling author, but with multiple shows in the works, he might become a growing TV sensation as well. As his project with Netflix Poland continues development, Coben can now bask in the glory of the ongoing success of Fool Me Once.
