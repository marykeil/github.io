## Literature Review
Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy&#39;s creator, also voices many of the show&#39;s characters. Some of his performances require more skill than others.




The world of Family Guy is filled with a rich variety of characters, and Seth MacFarlane lends his voice to more than his fair share of them. Although he&#39;s famous for portraying key members of the Griffin family, that&#39;s not where his role ends. A talented and flexible voice actor, MacFarlane is capable of completely transforming how he sounds, and he uses this ability to its fullest extent within his work. His ability to hit all emotional levels also adds an extra layer to the feel of the show. For instance, some of the worst things Stewie Griffin has ever done are also some of the funniest scenes because of MacFarlane&#39;s acting.
Starting its run in 1999, Family Guy was canceled after season 3. However, it was brought back and is still in production today. What makes MacFarlane&#39;s role in the show so impressive is that he doesn&#39;t just undertake speaking roles. Family Guy is no stranger to musical sequences, and MacFarlane is a trained singer. Therefore, some of the best Family Guy episodes are when he makes full use of his skill set and also sings in character. While some of MacFarlane&#39;s voices sound as if they&#39;re coming from a different person entirely, other characters of his aren&#39;t so far removed from how he sounds in the real world.
            
 
 10 Best Seth MacFarlane Cameos, Ranked 
Seth MacFarlane is one of the most successful voice actors of all time, and he isn&#39;t afraid to step outside his own shows for some memorable cameos.













 








 10  Brian Griffin 
The Griffins&#39; dog sounds just like Seth MacFarlane
        

When Brian speaks, it&#39;s essentially MacFarlane&#39;s everyday voice leaving his mouth. Although the two voices aren&#39;t exactly the same, they&#39;re close enough to be indisputably the same person. Brian&#39;s voice is slightly deeper than Seth MacFarlane&#39;s and this facet becomes more notable whenever Brian starts to sing. MacFarlane still plays the part of Brian very well, but the relative normality of Brian&#39;s timbre can be distracting for those familiar with how the voice actor sounds in real life. Having said that, Brian is often the voice of reason in the Griffin household, so giving him a more grounded voice contributes to his levelheaded aura - whenever he&#39;s not chasing his tail.





 9  Dr. Elmer Hartman 
The gruff doctor is hilariously clueless
        


MacFarlane adopts a gritty, authoritative tone for his role as Dr. Hartman, which is actually at odds with the character&#39;s lack of professionalism. Dr. Hartman often asks his patients questions that he should really know the answer to, but he does so with an unnerving amount of confidence. The conviction in MacFarlane&#39;s voice as the character bumbles through medical examinations is a huge factor in what makes Hartman&#39;s scene so funny.





 8  God 
MacFarlane&#39;s take on the Christian deity is an unconventional one


 







The version of God in Family Guy is unusually jovial and uncharacteristically inappropriate at times. Seth MacFarlane&#39;s naturally deep voice lends itself well to voicing a character like God, but he injects his own twisted sense of humor into the show&#39;s iteration of the bearded entity. While Family Guy&#39;s God looks every inch the traditional representation, he&#39;s been portrayed as many things that don&#39;t align with how he&#39;s described in the Bible. God often interacts with other Seth MacFarlane characters, having regular disagreements with Peter Griffin and his friends.
Seth MacFarlane also used to voice Jesus on Family Guy but has since been replaced in that role. 






 7  Tom Tucker 
Tom&#39;s newsreader voice is all he knows
        

Seth MacFarlane&#39;s news anchor cadence is very accurate, if not parodying the profession a little. Tom Tucker has been shown outside the newsroom on numerous occasions, and he&#39;s often more comfortable conversing with others as if he&#39;s still in front of the camera. MacFarlane keeps Tom Tucker&#39;s speech patterns very similar for comedic effect - as if the character&#39;s media training has taken him over completely. MacFarlane has made effective use of Tom Tucker&#39;s consistent communication style in various scenarios, including acting in Halloween movies and even in more intimate moments.





 6  Seamus Levine 
This is one of MacFarlane&#39;s more obvious tributes to The Simpsons
        

There is a counterpart in Family Guy for a great many characters from The Simpsons. The Sea Captain from The Simpsons and Seamus Levine from Family Guy have a great deal in common, including their voices. Both characters speak with the seasoned growl of a sailor, but Seamus&#39; all-wooden limbs set the two men apart. MacFarlane likely based his performance as Seamus on Hank Azaria&#39;s Sea Captain, but the imitation is sufficiently different to make the two figures independent of one another.
            
 
 Family Guy: Every Time Brian &amp; Stewie Time Traveled 
Family Guy often sends Brian and Stewie on time travel adventures together and they&#39;re usually when the show is at its best.









 5  Carter Pewterschmidt 
Peter Griffin&#39;s father-in-law doesn&#39;t enjoy much
        

In an arguably uncomfortable casting move, Seth MacFarlane plays Lois Griffin&#39;s father as well as her husband. However, the two characters couldn&#39;t be more different if they tried. Where Peter finds joy in almost everything he does, Carter revels in misery and seemingly likes very little. The character of Carter Pewterschmidt gives Seth MacFarlane the chance to play a deeply pessimistic character, which isn&#39;t a common occurrence for the actor. Luckily, the negativity of Carter works well when played against other Family Guy characters.
Carter&#39;s voice sounds very similar to Dr. Hartman&#39;s, a fact that&#39;s noticed and outwardly referenced when the pair meet in Family Guy season 6, episode 3, &#34;Believe It or Not, Joe&#39;s Walking on Air.&#34; 






 4  Jasper 
Brian&#39;s cousin sounds nothing like him
        

Brian isn&#39;t the only talking dog in Family Guy, as his cousin Jasper is often forgotten. Although used sparingly, Jasper has appeared several times throughout the show. Despite being a relation of Brian, Seth MacFarlane does an admirable job of making the two characters sound nothing alike. Their overall demeanor and mannerisms couldn&#39;t be more disparate, but they still interact well whenever they share a scene.





 3  Peter Griffin 
Peter&#39;s voice is one of the most recognizable in Family Guy


 







MacFarlane perfectly encapsulates Peter&#39;s background by supplying the character with an overwhelmingly strong Bostonian accent. However, it&#39;s not just Peter&#39;s dialogue that makes Seth MacFarlane&#39;s performance as Peter Griffin so impressive. As well as performing many musical numbers as Peter, MacFarlane has also developed an iconic laugh for his main character.
Despite being set in the fictional New England town of Quahog, Peter is the only main Family Guy character with an accent that reflects his roots, but that only helps him stand out more. Peter also has a tendency to go from child-like wonder to existential misery at the drop of a hat, and it&#39;s Seth MacFarlane&#39;s acting range that allows him to do it all believably. In addition, some of Peter Griffin&#39;s best quotes in Family Guyare only so highly revered because of MacFarlane&#39;s acting.
Seth MacFarlane developed Peter&#39;s voice for a 1995 animated film he directed called The Life of Larry and Steve. Both title characters are voiced by MacFarlane, with Larry acting as an early version of Peter on a visual and auditory level. Steve is also very similar to Brian Griffin. 






 2  Glenn Quagmire 
Quagmire&#39;s rapid speech takes a lot of skill
        

Quagmire probably speaks the fastest out of all of Family Guy&#39;s characters, let alone the group given life by MacFarlane. Glenn Quagmire wears many hats throughout the show, including that of an airline pilot, Peter&#39;s drinking buddy, and a ladies&#39; man. As such, he adopts a different persona depending on his current setting. Seth MacFarlane is a master of consistent performances when it comes to voice acting, but Quagmire is one of his ultimate triumphs when it comes to flexibility. The character also has a relatively short fuse, and his raging outbursts are some of the best sequences because of MacFarlane&#39;s delivery.





 1  Stewie Griffin 
The Griffin&#39;s youngest child is inexplicably British


 







Stewie&#39;s voice is one of the cornerstones of Family Guy itself. In addition, the character&#39;s development from a severely evil genius into a sarcastic mess is one of the best in animated television. It became clear early on in the show&#39;s run that Stewie&#39;s plans for world domination could only go so far while remaining funny, so MacFarlane and company tweaked the character to give him more depth. While Stewie&#39;s intelligence has remained startlingly high, his loner attitude has fallen by the wayside. As such, he&#39;s developed entertaining partnerships with various Family Guy cast members, none of which are more notable than his friendship with Brian.

Brian and Stewie are arguably the best duo on Family Guy, but what are their best episodes throughout the entire series?




Similar to his role as Peter Griffin, MacFarlane has to cover a wide range of emotions as Stewie. While some scenes may be in line with Family Guy&#39;s famous irreverence, other sequences call for a much more emotional approach. Without Stewie, the show would lose a huge number of its comical moments and its heart. As such, Seth MacFarlane&#39;s role as Stewie Griffin is his most valuable acting performance in Family Guy.
Family Guy is available to stream on Hulu.
