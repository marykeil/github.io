## Literature Review
HIDIVE has a variety of interesting anime premiering in January 2024, from unique action shows to twists on the popular Magical Girl genre.




A new year means that a variety of new anime are now or soon to be streaming on HIDIVE. This includes both subbed episodes of new shows simulcast with the Japanese airings and long-awaited English dubs of older shows. While HIDIVE may not be as well known as other streaming sites like Crunchyroll, its January 2024 lineup shows that it still has plenty to offer anime fans in the coming season.




HIDIVE’s lineup also includes a variety of shows continuing from 2023 like the surprisingly cute romance The Dangers in My Heart, the remake of the classic sci-fi anime Urusei Yatsura, and the edgy fantasy series Ragna Crimson. These shows, along with shows that have recently ended like the hilarious isekai The Eminence in Shadow provide a great back catalog for fans who want to binge completed series as well. Diving deeper into this back catalog can reveal other hidden gems to watch such as the disturbing but great fantasy series Made in Abyss.

          

Ultimately though, the most exciting series in HIDIVE’s winter lineup are the hype new shows that the streaming service is featuring.


 HIDIVE Offers Shows in Various Classic Anime Genres

The three new shows that HIDIVE is simulcasting in January 2024 are Gushing Over Magical Girls, Chained Soldier, and My Instant Death Ability is Overpowered. The first is a Magical Girl anime that features a main character who loves Magical Girls and then becomes an antagonist to them. The second is a unique action series written by the same author as the iconic Akame ga Kill!. Lastly, the third is an isekai that features one of the strongest protagonists in the genre, which is saying something given how overpowered Isekai Anime protagonists can be. These shows provide a good variety for fans to watch.




Winter 2024 will also see the premiere of the dub for the Fantasy series The Demon Sword of Excalibur Academy. This joins a large number of continuing dubs featured on HIDIVE’s streaming platform, from raunchy romantic comedies like Love Flops to supernatural horror shows like Dark Gathering. The site is also releasing the dub of the gritty and fantastical samurai series Blade of the Immortal, which was originally released from 2019 to 2020. This variety means that enjoyers of both subbed and dubbed anime will have something to look forward to this season on HIDIVE.
