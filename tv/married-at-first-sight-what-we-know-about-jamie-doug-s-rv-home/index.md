## Literature Review
Married at First Sight alums Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner lived in an RV for around a year before settling down in a permanent home. 





When Jamie and Doug met during MAFS season 1 back in 2014, viewers could tell that they were smitten from the start. Although Jamie showed some doubts at first—particularly regarding her attraction to Doug—the couple enjoyed a smooth transition period, and stayed married after Decision Day. Eight years later, Jamie and Doug are still happily married. They have two children: Henley, 4, and Hendrix, who turns two on May 13. Although they&#39;ve had some rough patches in their marriage, like any other couple, Jamie and Doug revealed last January that they would be selling their home, and transitioning to life in an RV.

 Jamie &amp; Doug Hehner&#39;s Van Life 

 

After seeking the expertise of RV Family Renovators, to design their sized-down home, Jamie and Doug have shown off their motorized home for their Instagram followers and MAFS fans. Lip-syncing to a voice asking, &#34;Would you look at that?&#34; in the abridged tour, Doug hilariously shows off living room area, sleeping quarters, and kitchen. Proudly revealing that their master bedroom has the washer and dryer placed inside it, the Hehner&#39;s RV also comes equipped with a full-sized fridge, and an oven with three burners. Despite the reduced size of their home, the Hehner&#39;s space looks big, comfortable, and inviting.

More photos shared by In Touch Weekly show off the Hehner&#39;s new modern abode, after they gave fans another tour on their YouTube channel, Hanging With The Hehners. While the kitchen is complete with blue cabinets and stainless steel appliances, Henley and Hendrix&#39;s room features a toddler-sized bed and a crib, with a half-bath tucked in. On May 1, Doug further revealed that the family had been officially living in their RV for a month, and had already traveled to several places, including Tennessee, Virginia, Washington D.C., Arkansas, and Texas. Their journeys are just getting started, as Doug shared that their RV will start making its way towards the West Coast.




Jamie and Doug have come a long way since meeting on MAFS season 1, and fans are happy to see that one of the show&#39;s first marriages is still going strong. With the couple and their children enjoying life on the road as they travel across the United States, there will surely be more news and updates to come. In the meantime, in light of how big the Lifetime show has gotten, there&#39;s always a new update ready to be shared.
