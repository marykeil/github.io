Giancarlo Esposito takes on a new crime environment in the trailer for Parish. Esposito is best known for his role on Breaking Bad, in which he played crime lord Gus Fring. Esposito reprised his role as Gus for a number of episodes in the equally acclaimed show, Better Call Saul. Outside of the AMC franchise, the star is also well-known for his villainous turns in Prime Video&#39;s The Boys and Disney&#43;&#39;s The Mandalorian.




With nearly two years gone since his last collaboration with the network, AMC&#43; has released a new trailer for Parish, showing off Esposito&#39;s new sho. Check out the trailer below:


 

The short teaser trailer begins in a church in a brief moment of serenity. The scene then descends into chaos, as Esposito’s character is involved in a car chase and other moments of high drama.


 What To Expect From Parish 
          

According to the synopsis of Parish, the series will follow the life of an aging taxi driver, Gracián &#34;Gray&#34; Parish, played by Esposito, who agrees to pick up a Zimbabwean gangster who is infamous for exploiting undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Southern ports. Upon doing so, Parish’s life is turned upside down as his serene existence is suddenly transformed into a life of criminal mayhem. Parish is currently slated to have a six-episode season.






Parish does not yet have a release date.




Parish is created by Sunu Gonera (13 Reasons Why, Little America) and Daniel Brocklehurst (The Stranger). In addition to Esposito, the series features a supporting cast of Zackary Momoh, Arica Himmel, Ivan Mbakop, and Patrick Robinson. Writers for the show include Gonera and Brocklehurst, the latter of whom is fresh off the success of Netflix&#39;s adaptation of Harlan Coben&#39;s Fool Me Once, alongside Amadou Diallo and Jim Poyser.

                  10 Best TV Shows Like Fool Me Once   Though Fool Me Once won&#39;t get a second season on Netflix, multiple other dramas and thrillers exist that offer a similar storyline and themes.    

Though the Parish trailer offers only a brief glimpse at the action, the series so far looks to be a promising entry. Esposito was a consistent scene-stealer in both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, so seeing him take the lead in a crime show will be a refreshing turn. The trailer implies a double entendre in the title — referring to both the lead’s surname and a church parish — which could lead to interesting religious themes amidst the drama. Parish does not yet have an exact release date, but is on tap for a Spring 2024 premiere.
