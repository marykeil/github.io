Summary

  Marsha Warfield is interested in a potential Night Court spinoff focused on her character, Roz.   However, a spinoff would require more than just Warfield&#39;s interest, including a network or streaming platform pursuing it.   Night Court&#39;s ratings decline in season 1 means a spinoff is unlikely, but Warfield is open to returning to the revival series in the future.  







Roz actor Marsha Warfield shares her thoughts on a potential Night Court spinoff after returning to the revival series. Warfield starred as Roz, a bailiff, in seasons 4-9 of the original show. She first reprised her role for the new Night Court&#39;s season 1 finale in May 2023. She then returned for the season 2 premiere, which introduced audiences to her fiancée, Loretta.

In honor of her character&#39;s return in Night Court season 2, Warfield spoke with JoBlo Celebrity Interviews about her experience on the show. Check out the video below:


 

When asked what she would need to sign on for a Roz-focused spinoff, Warfield gave an enthusiastic response signifying her interest:


What do you mean, what would it take? How much do I have to pay? Who do I have to sleep with? Where do I sign up?






 Could a Roz Night Court Spinoff Actually Happen? 
          

Warfield&#39;s interest is an important factor in a potential Night Court spinoff focused on her character, and those who enjoyed Roz&#39;s return will be happy to hear her response. However, a show needs more than that to get off the ground—most importantly, a network or streaming pursuing it, likely NBC or Peacock in the case of a Night Court spinoff. While Roz&#39;s return has generated a lot of buzz, especially with fans of the original series, it likely won&#39;t be enough to prompt a spinoff focused on the character.

Night Court&#39;s ratings aren&#39;t on the side of a potential new show, with the series&#39; viewership numbers declining throughout season 1. While they could pick back up as Night Court season 2 continues, that seems unlikely based on the show&#39;s past performance. The ratings would have to be much more impressive than they currently are for NBC or Peacock to consider a Night Court offshoot.




That doesn&#39;t mean viewers won&#39;t see Roz again, though. Warfield has made it clear she&#39;s willing to come back to the revival series in the future, and it seems likely the show&#39;s writers will take her up on it, as long as it works with the story and Warfield&#39;s schedule. Roz provides the new Night Court with a much-needed connection to the original show thanks to her relationship with Dan (John Larroquette), and it&#39;s only logical to take advantage of that.



Night Court airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC and streams the next day on Peacock.
