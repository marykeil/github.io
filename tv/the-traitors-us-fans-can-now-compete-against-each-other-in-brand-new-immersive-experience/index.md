## Literature Review
The Traitors season 2 premieres soon, but fans can now take part in their own version of the game via a new immersive experience in Los Angeles.




Reality TV stars aren&#39;t the only people who can take part in The Traitors competition now that a brand-new immersive experience has been announced. The Traitors took the reality TV world by storm when the U.S. version debuted in January 2023. This Peacock series sees its contestants entering a game of intrigue, mystery and &#34;murder.&#34; At the start of the season, a few players are selected to be traitors, whose goal is to take out their competitors and not get caught. The Traitors season 1 ended with Survivor legend Cirie Fields winning the grand prize.




To coincide with the January 12 premiere of The Traitors season 2, Peacock is setting up an immersive experience in which fans of the reality show can learn what it&#39;s like to play the game, according to Parade. Taking place at an estate in Los Angeles, fans will compete against each other in various puzzles and other games, all while trying to figure out the identity of the traitor. The event is not free, though; it costs $25 per person. The Traitors Experience is open to the public on January 13 and 14 from 12-9pm, January 19 from 5-9pm, and January 20 and 21 from 12-9pm. It&#39;s unclear if any prizes will be handed out to the winner(s).


 What To Expect From The Traitors Season 2 
          

The Traitors Experience opens just one day after The Traitors season 2 premieres on Peacock. This time around, every single contestant is a reality TV star; during its inaugural season, half of the cast were reality stars and half were non-celebrities. The 21 players for The Traitors season 2 include The Challenge&#39;s CT Tamburello; Big Brother&#39;s Dan Gheesling, Janelle Pierzina and Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio; Love Island USA&#39;s Bergie Bergersen; Real Housewives&#39; ShereÃ© Whitfield and Tamra Judge; Survivor&#39;s Parvati Shallow and Sandra Diaz-Twine; and The Bachelor&#39;s Peter Weber.





 

Former Speaker of the UK House of Commons John Bercow is also competing, which is an interesting choice since he&#39;s unknown to American audiences; it&#39;s possible that a celebrity dropped out at the last minute, forcing production to find someone local in the UK to replace them. Outside of him, all the other contestants are familiar public figures in the United States. Some of them are very adept at strategy because of the shows they&#39;ve competed on, like Survivor and Big Brother.

Whatever their comfort level with backstabbing, strategizing and building alliances is, all 21 players will be forced to step up to the plate and prove themselves. Once they get to the end of the competition, if there&#39;s still at least one traitor left in the game, that person wins the grand prize, which is why it&#39;s extremely important to take the traitors out as soon as they can. There&#39;s no way the faithful will want a repeat of what happened during The Traitors season 1 when Cirie managed to brilliantly convince the other remaining players that she was a faithful, which led her to walk away with the money.
