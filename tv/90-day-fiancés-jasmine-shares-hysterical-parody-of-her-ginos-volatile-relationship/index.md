## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is impressing fans with her &#34;queen&#34; behavior on social media after she shared a parody video of a season 10 scene.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda is in splits after watching a hilarious parody of her and Gino Palazzolo created by the reality TV show&#39;s viewers. Jasmine and Gino were first seen in Before the 90 Days season 5. They had met online and Gino flew to Panama to meet her in person. Gino betrayed Jasmine by sharing her nude photos with an ex-girlfriend. Jasmine&#39;s suspicions about Gino turned out to be right. Jasmine could never get herself to trust Gino again, even though she came to America on a K-1 visa to marry Gino. Within days of her arriving in Michigan, Jasmine found evidence of Gino cheating on her.




Jasmine threw a fit when she found a tube of lip gloss lying under her seat in Gino&#39;s car, and now Jasmine is looking back at the scene in a different light after it was parodied by YouTubers Michael &amp; Anthony.


 

Jasmine reposted a video created by the YouTubers titled, &#34;90 Day Fiancé PARODY: Jasmine EXPLODES After Finding Lip Gloss in Gino&#39;s Car.&#34; Jasmine captioned her post, &#34;Please go to @michaelpavano YouTube channel and watch the full video and get a good laugh.&#34; She continued, &#34;Omg! Why am I like this?&#34; because the clip showed Michael as Jasmine wailing and screaming because Gino refused to tell her who the lip gloss belonged to.

 90 Day Fiancé Fans Love That Jasmine Has A Sense Of Humor 
          




What made the video even funnier was Jasmine stopping mid-wailing to look at the lip gloss and realize that it was her own makeup. &#34;Wait a minute, this is mine,&#34; Jasmine says to herself in the clip, before Gino tells her, &#34;We got into that fight for nothing&#34; and they head to get some ice cream. Meanwhile, Jasmine also added the hashtags, &#34;#parody #90dayfiance #psycholatina #youtookhertolegoland&#34; to poke fun at herself. &#34;This is so funny and good on you for being able to laugh at yourself!&#34; a fan told Jasmine in the comments. Someone pointed out that they did think the lip gloss belonged to Jasmine after the scene was telecast.

&#34;Oh my god!!! lol the fact that you get in on the jokes shows you have a good sense of humour&#34; wrote another of Jasmine&#39;s followers. One fan said that Jasmine and Gino were their favorite couple on 90 Day Fiancé. Fans let Jasmine know that her ability to appreciate parodies like this one is the reason why they love her. They said Jasmine was an &#34;absolute queen&#34; who was able to laugh at herself and appreciate a good, well-meaning joke. Interestingly, Jasmine had previously told fans that the lip gloss did not belong to her. She said she had evidence and reports to prove it wasn&#39;t hers.




One of the biggest clues was that it was not vegan and cruelty-free like the other brands that she prefers. It was also a color that she did not like wearing and was supposedly a fresh product. Jasmine did not mention the lip gloss on 90 Day Fiancé after that day, which means she could be saving her proof for the Tell All. Jasmine is not someone who would let Gino walk away scot-free and not expose him for lying in front of an audience. Jasmine forgave Gino after the scene when he apologized, but the video she shared proves that the lip gloss is not something that Jasmine will forget for a long time.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
