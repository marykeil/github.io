# 22 Times Doctor Who Proved The Doctor Does Use Guns


## SUMMARY 


Doctor Who
 has often contradicted its titular character&#39;s disdain for guns, as the Doctor has used various firearms throughout the show&#39;s history.

## Literature Review
Throughout Doctor Who&#39;s 60-year run, the Time Lord has been insistent on being a pacifist and anti-weapon, but some moments prove otherwise.




Since the beginning of Doctor Who, the titular Time Lord has made it clear that they disagree with the use of guns, but on many occasions, the show has contradicted this belief. Even the TARDIS lacks weapons, as the Doctor tends to use more creative measures to thwart his enemies&#39; plans. However, while the Doctor has always generally been a pacifist, sometimes there is no other choice when it comes to the threats of time and space than to pick up a gun.
While the Doctor is generally anti-weapon, there are plenty of other Doctor Who characters who don&#39;t share the sentiment. Companions and villains alike have taken up arms over the years to either protect or harm the Doctor. Even though the Doctor is famously against firearms,there are times when using a gun is simply necessary as the last resort.

Doctor Who&#39;s lead character is often painted as an alien saint; the pinnacle of virtue. On many occasions, however, the Doctor has been anything but.













 








 22  The First Doctor In &#34;The Gunfighters&#34; 
Weapon: Revolver
        

The First Doctor (William Hartnell) story &#34;The Gunfighters&#34; sees the Doctor visit the Wild West town of Tombstone in 1881 in search of a dentist. What starts as a funny premise ends up with the Time Lord being thrown into chaos and becoming involved with a group of gunmen hunting down Doc Holliday (Anthony Jacobs). Despite his protests, the Doctor is repeatedly armed with a gun throughout the adventure, and even when trying to dispose of it, the revolver still manages to make its way back into his hand.





 21  The Second Doctor In &#34;The Seeds Of Death&#34; 
Weapon: Solar-Powered Firearm
        

&#34;The Seeds of Death&#34; sees the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) cross paths with the Ice Warriors for the second time. Throughout the story, a solar energy storeroom is a recurring setting, and the building of a solar-powered firearm is presented at multiple points. While the original doesn&#39;t work, the Doctor manages to replicate his own version of the device and use it against an Ice Warrior to kill it before using cabling to extend its radius and killing several more.





 20  The Third Doctor In &#34;Day Of The Daleks&#34; 
Weapon: Ultrasonic Disintegrator
        

In &#34;Day of the Daleks,&#34; the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) uses an unusual weapon called an ultrasonic disintegrator. To defend himself against the Ogrons, a race of creatures used by the Daleks as guards, the Doctor uses the disintegrator against one of them. While this only happens once in the original TV episodes, the Special Edition DVD features an additional scene where the Doctor kills a second Ogron with the weapon.





 19  The Fourth Doctor In &#34;The Seeds Of Doom&#34; 
Weapon: Handgun
        

&#34;The Seeds of Doom&#34; sees the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) working closely with UNIT once again. In an attempt to retreat from the madness caused by the Krynoid, the Doctor takes the gun of Scorby (John Challis), a mercenary who had held the Time Lord and his companion hostage. Although the Doctor never uses the weapon, he is clever in his decision to arm himself, as the trigger-happy Scorby isn&#39;t aware of the Time Lord&#39;s pacifism.





 18  The Fourth Doctor In &#34;The Deadly Assassin&#34; 
Weapon: Rifle
        

While the Fourth Doctor is set up in &#34;The Deadly Assassin,&#34; he is, rather unfortunately, holding a gun at the moment that the Lord President of Gallifrey (Llewellyn Rees) is killed. Despite having a premonition that he is the one to pull the trigger and attempting to warn them by leaving a note, the Doctor attempts to grab a hanging rifle to ensure the assassination doesn&#39;t happen. When the President is then killed, it appears that the Doctor shot him, but this isn&#39;t the case. Eventually, it&#39;s revealed that the premonition was placed inside his mind by the Master (Peter Pratt), who is also the true assassin.







 17  The Fourth Doctor In &#34;The Talons Of Weng-Chiang&#34; 
Weapon: Fowling Shotgun
        

The Fourth Doctor finds himself with a weapon once again in &#34;The Talons of Weng-Chiang.&#34; Rather than a traditional gun, this time, the Doctor is armed with an old fowling shotgun that, despite having not been fired in 50 years, he manages to use with no repercussions. This instance sees a rather sweet moment between the Doctor and Leela (Louise Jameson), as he uses the weapon to protect her against a giant rat in the sewers.





 16  The Fourth Doctor In &#34;Image Of The Fendahl&#34; 
Weapon: Shotgun
        

In &#34;Image of the Fendahl,&#34; the Fourth Doctor appears armed with a shotgun. Although it would seem that he is ready to use gunpowder or bullets, the weapon is used rather imaginatively. The Doctor loads the shotgun with rock salt to use against the Fendahleen — organismic creatures from the Fendhal core — after he discovers &#34;sodium chloride affects [its] conductivity.&#34;





 15  The Fourth Doctor In &#34;The Invasion Of Time&#34; 
Weapon: De-Mat Gun
        

When the Fourth Doctor crosses paths with the Sontarans in &#34;The Invasion of Time,&#34; it results in him using a special, forbidden Time Lord weapon. The De-mat gun, which is used to erase beings from time itself, is a dangerous device made with iridium alloy. While the Doctor doesn&#39;t use the gun to remove the Sontarans from time, he does use it to counter their attack that would have destroyed not only the Time Lords but their own species, too.





 14  The Fifth Doctor In &#34;Earthshock&#34; 
Weapon: Cyber-Gun
        

The Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) adventure &#34;Earthshock&#34; is best remembered for the death of Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), but as he is heading toward his demise, the Doctor has to arm himself. After the Cyber-Leader shoots the TARDIS console, damaging the ship and delaying their escape, the Time Lord snatches its gun from it. In a split-second decision, the Doctor fires several rounds straight into the Cyber-Leader&#39;s chest, brutally killing it. 





 13  The Fifth Doctor In &#34;Arc Of Infinity&#34; 
Weapon: Matter Converter
        

&#34;Arc of Infinity&#34; sees the Fifth Doctor with a gun once again. Armed with a matter converter, a weapon of Omega&#39;s mutant agent, the Ergon, the Doctor decides to use it against the anti-matter threat. With a single shot, Omega is expelled back into his own universe of anti-matter, making Gallifrey safe from one of the founders of the Time Lord society.





 12  The Fifth Doctor In &#34;Ressurection Of The Daleks&#34; 
Weapon: Pistol
        

In &#34;Resurrection of the Daleks,&#34; the Fifth Doctor encounters the Daleks once again. In one scene, the Doctor finds a Dalek mutant trying to escape its damaged casing and uses a pistol that had been given to him for protection against it. This was the moment the Doctor concludes that he needs to kill Davros, and although later on does hold the villain at gunpoint, he ultimately cannot follow through with the act.

 11  The Sixth Doctor In &#34;Attack Of The Cybermen&#34; 
Weapon: Cyber-Gun
        

&#34;Attack of the Cybermen&#34; sees the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) in one of his most violent moments. Crossing paths with the Cybermen once again, this story also sees the return of Lytton from &#34;Resurrection of the Daleks.&#34; In the adventure&#39;s final moments, Lytton assists the Doctor by stabbing the Cyber-Controller in the arm with a scalpel, which creates a much-needed distraction. In one fluid motion, the Doctor snatches the Controller&#39;s weapon and opens fire, a flurry of bullets and flashes, killing it cold.







 10  The Sixth Doctor In &#34;Timelash&#34; 
Weapon: Kontron Crystal
        

In &#34;Timelash,&#34; the Sixth Doctor arms himself with a Kontron crystal. Despite it not being a gun, the Doctor uses this gem very much like a firearm. In an attempt to avoid the attacks of his old antagonist, the Borad, the Doctor uses the crystal to deflect a time acceleration beam, which then hits the crazed scientist and kills him where he sits.





 9  The Sixth Doctor In &#34;Revelation Of The Daleks&#34; 
Weapon: Revolver
        

The Sixth Doctor uses a weapon for the last time in the adventure &#34;Revelation of the Daleks,&#34; using it straight at the Daleks&#39; weak spot. As Davros is escorted into a room by his creations, they are surprised to find the Time Lord, who suddenly turns and blasts one of the Daleks in the eye stalk. Peri (Nicola Bryant), then attaches a small bomb to its casing as it panics, and the two get cover, watching as its casing explodes. Considering this is the only story in which the Doctor crosses paths with the Daleks in this incarnation, it&#39;s a relatively exciting approach to his greatest enemies.







 8  The Seventh Doctor In &#34;Ghost Light&#34; 
Weapon: Handgun
        

After taking Ace (Sophie Alred) back to her past in &#34;Ghost Light,&#34; she and the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) find themselves up against Josiah Samuel Smith (Ian Hogg), an ancient being who is part of the Light&#39;s survey of Earth. This story sees a surprising moment for the Doctor, who, while being held at gunpoint by a group of maids, uses a blaring alarm to snatch one for himself and steer Josiah away. While the Time Lord has used a weapon when needed before, this instance, which sees him taking someone hostage, is particularly shocking. 





 7  The Ninth Doctor In &#34;Dalek&#34; 
Weapon: Makeshift Blaster
        

Still tender from the haunted memories of the Time War, the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) is quick to hold up the last remaining Dalek in the universe, or so he believes it to be, with a makeshift blaster. However, he is unable to go through with killing it, mainly thanks to Rose (Billie Piper). Despite this, it&#39;s clear how angry and pained the Time Lord is in &#34;Dalek&#34; at facing the very creature that destroyed his people and planet once again.
            
 
 Doctor Who: 10 Quotes That Sum Up The Ninth Doctor As A Character 
Despite the Ninth Doctor&#39;s brief tenure, the character has a number of memorable quotes. Here are the ones with best sum up the character.









 6  The Ninth Doctor In &#34;Bad Wolf&#34; 
Weapon: Large Blaster Gun
        

For the sake of Rose&#39;s protection once again, the Ninth Doctor also takes a large gun and aims it at the Controller (Martha Cope) of Satellite 5, in the season 1 episode &#34;Bad Wolf.&#34; Like in &#34;Dalek,&#34; the Doctor chooses not to act violently in the end, despite his panic and anger over believing Rose has died within the games. Luckily, the Doctor has no real plans for using the weapon and makes sure to let the human programmers nearby know this, casually throwing the heavy gun toward them.





 5  The Tenth Doctor In &#34;The Doctor&#39;s Daughter&#34; 
Weapon: Handgun
        

Some of the last moments of the episode &#34;The Doctor&#39;s Daughter&#34; see a beautiful new start for the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his new daughter Jenny (Georgia Tennant), but it is sadly cut short. In an attempt to kill the Time Lord, General Cobb (Nigel Terry) fires a fatal shot, which Jenny steps in front of. After a delicate and emotional moment as Jenny breathes her last, the Doctor quickly shifts, snatching Cobb&#39;s gun and pressing it into his forehead. As pacifistic as ever, through shaking and gritted teeth, the Doctor lowers the weapon and tells the man, &#34;I never would.&#34;





 4  The Tenth Doctor In &#34;The End Of Time Part 2&#34; 
Weapon: Revolver


 







After trying to avoid it, the Tenth Doctor finally reaches the end of his lifespan in that body, faced with the return of not only the Saxon Master (John Simm) but also the Time Lords and Rassilon (Timothy Dalton). After falling through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, armed with an old war revolver courtesy of Wilf (Bernard Cribbins), the Doctor struggles to choose who is the true enemy. Eventually, he instead settled on firing his shot at the White-Point Star, sending the Master and the Time Lords &#34;back to Hell,&#34; into the final days of the Time War.





 3  The Eleventh Doctor In &#34;The Time Of Angels&#34; 
Weapon: Handgun


 







The Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) briefly brandishes a handgun in the episode &#34;The Time of Angels.&#34; As part of a rather clever plan to escape the horde of Weeping Angels closing in on them, he shoots the gravity globe above them, illuminating the cave they&#39;re in. Doing so, alongside an order to the group to jump, creates an updraft that allows them to escape the inverted gravity field of the Byzantium, to become upside down on the ship&#39;s hull.
