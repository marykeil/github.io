## Literature Review
Kyle Viljoen might have just proved that the shocking Below Deck Mediterranean rumors about him were untrue by sharing a statement on Instagram.




Kyle Viljoen from Below Deck Mediterranean has returned to Instagram after fueling rumors he was being fired from the reality TV show. Kyle was introduced in Below Deck Med season 7 as a Second Stew. Kyle left a bad impression because he was seen as lazy and avoided doing his job. Kyle fell down the stairs and hurt his ankle in episode 17. While he left the show, Captain Sandy Yawn said Kyle wasn&#39;t fired. She received flack over reinviting the second steward for Below Deck Med season 8. As expected, Kyle was up to no good upon his return as he stirred the pot between Tumi Mhlongo and Natalya Scudder.




It led to suspicions that Kyle was about to be fired. Kyle deactivated his Instagram to further fuel the rumors but has now returned and is suggesting it had nothing to do with Below Deck Med.

          

Kyle posted an Instagram Story that said, &#34;I needed a social break.&#34; He continued, &#34;Even if it was a 48hr turnaround.&#34; Kyle added, &#34;Being &#39;main character energy&#39; is exhausting.&#34; He also included a side note to his statement. He gave a shoutout to his &#34;lovers&#34; and to those sharing their &#34;stories.&#34;

 Kyle Viljoen&#39;s Below Deck Med Rumors Explained 
          

Kyle promised his followers that a &#34;video reel&#34; will be dropping soon, in which he&#39;ll share &#34;more about it all.&#34; When Kyle deactivated his profile, it was taken as a sign that he wanted to avoid negative comments online. Reddit user Throwaway54438392 noticed that Kyle&#39;s Instagram was empty. Fans received a “Sorry, this page isn’t available” message when they visited his profile. The common consensus was that Kyle deleted his Instagram because he was going to get sacked in an upcoming episode of Below Deck Med.


 




Kyle and Tumi missed their first Below Deck charter because of visa issues. When they finally assembled on board in Italy, tensions between the interior team started to rise. Tumi immediately showed an attitude towards Natalya, while Natalya started talking back to Tumi and complained about her to the other cast members. Kyle was at the root of the issue because he had warned Tumi about Natalya before stepping on board. Tumi and Natalya continued to bicker as Kyle had an explosive fight with fan-favorite Jessika Asai. Kyle didn&#39;t like the fact that Jess had gone to tell Tumi about a comment he made about her.

As soon as Tumi told him about Jess, he stormed off to see Jess and started screaming in her face. Kyle&#39;s shouting caused a lot of unease and created sympathy for Jess. Kyle&#39;s nasty behavior in Below Deck Med season 8 cemented the belief that Kyle was going to get fired for certain. For now, it doesn&#39;t look like Kyle is going anywhere. He&#39;s very much active on Instagram and sharing several DMs from fans who strangely support him after everything that has happened.






Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
