## Literature Review

Sister Wives star Meri Brown has been dating someone new since October 2023. She&#39;s finally revealing her new boyfriend Amos on her birthday.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown revealed her new boyfriend on Instagram after months of keeping him a secret. Meri, 52, and Kody, 52, legally married in April 1990, when Meri was 19 and Kody was 21 years old. Meri came from a polygamist family herself, and Kody spiritually married Janelle Brown next and made Christine Brown his third wife. Kody had to divorce Meri in September 2014 when he wanted to legally marry his fourth wife, Robyn Brown. Meri still stayed with Kody, and they were together for 32 years, during which Meri also had an emotional affair with a person who was catfishing her in 2015.




Meri shared a shocking Instagram post on Tuesday, January 16, 2024, captioned, “Birthday #53 is looking a bit different for me this year, and might I say, I like how it looks!”


 

Meri happily posed for several photos with the new man in her life which she added to the post. “Meet Amos,” she wrote, calling him the good-looking guy she had been dating since October. Meri wrote that Amos is not six feet, six inches tall and is not a pilot, but he “loves Christmas” as much as she does and they “laugh a lot together.” Meri said these were two important elements of a successful relationship.

 Meri Brown Ended Plural Marriage With Kody In 2023 
          

“Also, Zona absolutely loves him,” wrote Meri, while asking fans to swipe through the pictures to see her and her boyfriend Amos spending time with her puppy. Meri said that she was keeping the news of her new relationship “kind of close” to herself as she had been dating Amos and enjoying the last few months getting to know each other. “I&#39;ve considered when and how I wanted to share this fun news and share him with the world,” Meri continued, before adding, “jk, not really sharing, I&#39;m keeping him to myself,” with a wink. Meri said she knew she wanted to celebrate her birthday in a special way.

Meri wanted to let her fans celebrate the special day with her. She’s now looking forward to what the rest of the year brings for her, considering how she’s already had a great start. Meri ended her marriage with Kody in January 2023, exactly a year ago. The end of their relationship was filmed for Sister Wives season 18. Kody had told Meri that romance was never going to be in the picture for them again. Kody, however, may have expected Meri to come back to him as he vowed to always have a relationship with her in the future. He wished for Meri to call him if she needed anything.




Meri admitted she had wasted her time being stuck in a loveless marriage with Kody. He wished to become friends with Meri and wondered if she would come and spend time with Robyn. Meri, too, had clung on to the hope of possibly reconciling with Kody for the longest time. She waited for Kody to patch things up, while he felt duty-bound to stay married to his first wife. Meri has yet to reveal how she met Amos and to share more details about who her new boyfriend is and what he does. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if Sister Wives season 19 follows Kody’s ex on her new journey with Amos.
