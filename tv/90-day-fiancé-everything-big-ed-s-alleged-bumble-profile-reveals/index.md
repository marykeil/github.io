 Big Ed Claims His Height Is 5&#39;11&#39;&#39; 

 

Twitter user @shabooty shared several screenshots of Big Ed’s alleged profile on Bumble. They tweeted the photos with the caption, “TEA TIME: what happens if ya put your Bumble dating app on travel mode and travel to Arkansas… THIS.” Since the dating app requires the user to mention their height in the description, it reveals how tall Big Ed is. The profile says Big Ed’s height is five feet eleven inches. However, Big Ed had told Rose on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days that he was 5’2” when they were dating. He then told the cameras that he had lied and is 4’11”.

The 90 Day Fiancé fan showed that the screenshots were from November 7, 2023, which means they are recent. Ed’s location on the app mentions “Centerton”, which is a city in Benton County, Arkansas. Someone in the fan’s comments said it could be a catfish account. However, they replied, “It’s not a catfish — you don’t think I don’t check my sources?” Another person asked the Twitter user if they had matched with Big Ed. “Not me but my source,” was their reply.

Liz believed that Big Ed’s family was supportive and helped strengthen their relationship. The pair were even spotted at a bar in Bentonville in early 2023. They were then seen at the DMV in Arkansas in April 2023, further fueling rumors of their move. Big Ed started working as a realtor in Northwest Arkansas in July 2023, and he also hosted a party for friends and family in their new, shared home in the same month.
