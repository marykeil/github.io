# The 2024 Emmys Prove The Last Of Us Season 2 Needs To Repeat Season 1 s Best Stories


## SUMMARY 



  The Last of Us season 2 should replicate its success with character-driven episodes like &#34;Long, Long Time&#34; and &#34;Left Behind.&#34;   The show&#39;s 7 guest acting nominations (and 2 wins) at the Emmys highlight the strength of its characters and performances.   Replicating the success of self-contained episodes is crucial for season 2, especially as it adapts the divisive second game in the series.

## Literature Review
Early wins for HBO&#39;s video game adaptation at the 2024 Emmys prove that The Last of Us season 2 needs to repeat season 1&#39;s best episodes to succeed.




What The Last of Us season 2 needs to replicate from its first outing has been made abundantly clear by the HBO show&#39;s 2024 Emmy Awards wins. In fact, the series&#39; showing at the Creative Arts Emmys on January 6–7, 2024 proves exactly which season-one episodes should be used as a blueprint. The Primetime Emmy Awards, which are airing on January 15 in the wake of the Hollywood strikes, will see The Last of Us competing against the likes of Succession, Better Call Saul, and Andor for Best Drama Series. Meanwhile, leads Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel, and Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie, will vie for acting accolades.




While the Emmys big-name (a.k.a. easily televisible) trophies are still up in the air, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences has already handed out many awards. HBO&#39;s The Last of Us was the big winner at the Creative Arts Emmys, earning an impressive eight awards. Although some of the accolades were for more behind-the-scenes endeavors, The Last of Us boasted four of the six nominees in the Outstanding Guest Actor In A Drama Series category, and three of the six nominees in the Outstanding Guest Actress In A Drama Series category. Undoubtedly, this lesson is crucial for The Last of Us season 2.

                  The Last Of Us Season 2 Can Overcome Its Biggest Challenge With Non-Linear Storytelling   The Last of Us season 2 will include a controversial moment, creating a major challenge. But non-linear storytelling might be able to help with this.    


 The Last Of Us Emmy Wins Prove Character-Driven Episodes Are Its Strength 
          




The Last of Us&#39; sheer number of Emmys guest acting nominations says a lot on its own, but the fact that actors from the HBO series won both guest acting categories is the cherry on top. While Keivonn Montreal Woodard and Lamar Johnson were nominated for playing brothers Sam and Henry in two episodes of the hit show, Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett were nominated for their performances as Bill and Frank — lovers who weathered the apocalypse&#39;s first decades together. In the other category, Melanie Lynskey&#39;s villainous Kathleen and Anna Torv&#39;s hardened survivor Tess, and Storm Reid&#39;s memorable Riley, Ellie&#39;s ill-fated first crush, made a lasting impact.

                  Every Confirmed Game Character In HBO&#39;s The Last Of Us   HBO&#39;s The Last of Us brings many game characters to live-action. Here&#39;s every Last of Us game character to expect when it premieres on 01/15/23.    

The Emmys went to Offerman and Reid, which says even more about the show&#39;s highlights. While characters like Kathleen, Sam, Henry, and Tess all had brief appearances, cropping up in just two episodes, Bill and Riley existed in relatively standalone, one-off installments. For example, &#34;Long, Long Time,&#34; centered on Bill and Frank&#39;s remarkable-yet-haunting love story. Although they meet Joel and Tess, the couple is the focus. Similarly, &#34;Left Behind&#34; takes a break from the show&#39;s central narrative and flashes back to a self-contained story about Ellie&#39;s friend-turned-crush Riley, who tragically dies after the pair try to have one night of wild, youthful adventure.






 The Last Of Us Season 2 Must Find Ways To Repeat This Success 
          

The Last of Us season 1&#39;s success with guest stars proves why season 2 needs to incorporate its own hyper-focused, character-driven episodes. While &#34;Left Behind&#34; faithfully adapts the first game&#39;s beloved downloadable expansion, &#34;Long, Long Time&#34; takes two pretty unremarkable side characters and fashions a beautiful story for them. Moreover, both episodes deepen the show&#39;s world-building and themes, making them feel like essential chapters in the story, even if they aren&#39;t literally propelling Joel and Ellie&#39;s journey forward. With The Last of Us season 2 adapting the divisive second game in the series, replicating the show&#39;s success with self-contained, character-driven episodes is a must.
