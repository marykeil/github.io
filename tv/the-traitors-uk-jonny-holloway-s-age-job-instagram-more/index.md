## Literature Review
Jonny Holloway became the latest contestant to leave The Traitors UK season 2 after he was banished. However, here are some details about him.




Jonny Holloway made his reality TV debut as one of The Traitors UK season 2 contestants. The show&#39;s second season, which premiered on Wednesday, January 3, has already generated a lot of hype on social media after the unexpected twists and turns the show had provided in just its second week of airing. Although The Traitors UK season 2 started with 22 contestants vying for the ultimate prize, seven have already been evicted, with 15 contestants remaining.




Like most of the cast, Jonny hoped to win The Traitors UK season 2 and played an almost perfect game for the first four episodes. However, his hopes of winning the show were cut short after co-star Ross raised suspicion about Jonny&#39;s attitude during the roundtables. Despite no other solid evidence, Ross was able to influence the other contestants, who all voted for Jonny. Eventually, after his banishment, they found out he had been a faithful all along.

 Jonny Holloway&#39;s Job 
         

Jonny was still a teenager when he decided to pursue a life in the military. He first joined the Army Cadets at 12 and was just 17 when he joined the Royal Lancers in the Royal Armoured Corps. Jonny worked on vehicles before he joined the infantry fighting on the frontlines. In 2013, Jonny had his first tour of Afghanistan, but tragedy struck just a year later. On March 5, 2014, a 21-year-old Jonny, while driving a Warthog near Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province, hit a 180 lb improvised explosive device (IED).

The force of the explosion ripped through and shattered Jonny&#39;s left leg. He also suffered a brain injury that affected his short-term memory and concentration. The effect of the blast also damaged his right eye. The incident effectively ended Jonny&#39;s army career. After some personal struggles, Jonny made his TV debut, appearing in the BBC Two series The Secret Helpers, where ordinary people facing difficulties are advised through a secret ear device by &#34;worldly-wise people&#34; (via IMDB).
