# Rick &amp; Morty Season 7s Funniest Episode Revived A Forgotten Trope That Made Season 1 Great


## SUMMARY

The episode &#34;Rickfending Your Mort&#34; in season 7 brought back horror movie parodies, referencing Pet Sematary, Maximum Overdrive, and Blade.   With the tonal shift after Rick Prime&#39;s death, Rick and Morty can incorporate horror elements and continue to parody the genre in season 8.

## Literature Review

Rick and Morty season 7, episode 6 brought back a classic staple that has been missing for years, resulting in the season&#39;s most purely fun outing.




While Rick and Morty has always featured parodies, season 7’s funniest episode saw the show bring back a more specific staple from earlier outings. Rick and Morty constantly spoofs pop culture. The Adult Swim hit began life as a less family-friendly parody of Back to the Future, its second episode then blended Nightmare On Elm Street with Inception, and hardly a single outing has gone by without one of the heroes name-dropping a famous TV show or movie. Despite this, Rick &amp; Morty has gradually leaned away from one regular fixture seen in earlier seasons.




Out of all Rick and Morty season 7’s movie parodies, the show only referenced a small handful of horror movies. There were countless nods to sci-fi, but far fewer to the horror genre. Most of the horror-centric gags in season 7 were limited to one episode that included numerous spoofs of famous horror movies bunched together, whereas earlier seasons would feature full episodes devoted to riffing on genre classics. Season 7, episode 6, &#34;Rickfending Your Mort,&#34; managed to bring back this trope, and proved Rick and Morty season 8 needs more horror spoofs going forward.

                  Rick &amp; Morty Season 7 Ending Explained   Rick and Morty&#39;s season 7 finale featured a wild twist ending that redefined the dynamic between Rick and Morty heading into season 8 of the series.   


 Rick &amp; Morty Season 7, Episode 6 Spoofed Numerous Horror Movies 
&#34;Rickfending Your Mort&#34; parodied Stephen King, Blade, and more
         




&#34;Rickfending Your Mort&#34; saw Rick and Morty looking back on numerous adventures viewers had never seen before, which gave the show a perfect chance to spoof a string of famous scary movies. The episode crammed parodies of Pet Sematary, Maximum Overdrive, and Blade into its many brief vignettes. In Rick and Morty&#39;s parody of Pet Sematary, the two title characters attempted to work out how Stephen King’s titular location functioned by wantonly experimenting on its reviving abilities.

In the show’s Maximum Overdrive spoof, Rick and Morty questioned whether being attacked by sentient clothes was scarier than facing down killer cars. They got their answer when a blouse tore off a woman’s face and wore it, prompting the show to jump ahead. In another skit, Rick and Morty season 7 skewered Marvel&#39;s iconic Blade as the two eponymous antiheroes tried their hand at vampire slaying, only to give up when they became bored. These spoofs all made light of scary media - something Rick and Morty once focused on more heavily.






 Rick &amp; Morty&#39;s Earlier Seasons Featured Far More Horror Parodies 
Seasons 1-4&#39;s tone allowed for more gory stories
          

Rick and Morty used to spend much more time parodying horror movies, but the show moved away from that trope as the years passed. In season 1 alone, Rick and Morty spoofed Nightmare On Elm Street, Jurassic Park, Needful Things, David Cronenberg movies, and M Night Shyamalan&#39;s oeuvre, while season 2 parodied The Langoliers, Aliens, The Purge, and vampire movies. However, season 5&#39;s finale and season 6&#39;s premiere set Evil Morty and Rick Prime up as serious villains, increasing the stakes of Rick and Morty&#39;s story. This darker tone meant that there was less room for gory spoofs of grim movies.

Rick Prime&#39;s death meant Rick and Morty season 7&#39;s story could go in any number of directions. As the first episode after Rick killed Rick Prime, the fact that &#34;Rickfending Your Mort&#34; featured so many of the show’s old horror parodies felt like a conscious return to lighter, sillier genre storytelling. These skits were gory, but didn&#39;t have much in the way of emotional stakes, much like the horror parodies of earlier seasons. This could prove promising as Rick and Morty moves into season 8.






 Rick &amp; Morty Season 8 Should Continue Spoofing Horror Movies 
Season 8&#39;s tonal shift means Rick and Morty can parody horror again
          

As evidenced by the season 7 finale, which borrowed its premise from Joe Dante&#39;s underrated 2009 chiller The Hole, Rick and Morty can still focus on its character development while incorporating horror elements. Now that Rick Prime is gone, Rick and Morty can bring back darker, grosser genre stories without worrying about how these will impact the overarching storyline. Rick and Morty season 8 promises Morty more screen time, judging by the finale&#39;s twist ending, so the show could stage as many horror parodies that star its dimwitted antihero as it did in earlier seasons.

Rick and Morty&#39;s parodies of The Purge and Prometheus were both set up by Morty, who wanted to take on those risky adventures despite Rick warning that they would end badly. Rick&#39;s awareness of horror tropes pairs well with Morty&#39;s well-meaning obliviousness, allowing Rick and Morty to spoof the genre without episodes becoming too gruesome or bleak. As such, season 8 is now primed to bring back this early-season staple. Without a serious villain to worry about, Rick and Morty&#39;s heroes can return to taking down the horror genre’s most famous movies.
