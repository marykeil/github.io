## Literature Review
Southern Hospitality season 2 was recently confirmed at BravoCon 2023 along with a release date and trailer. So far, the season is looking good. 




Southern Hospitality season 2 is coming to Bravo at the end of the year, and fans cannot wait for another season with the employees of Republic. The first season of the reality series aired a year ago to rave reviews. The show is a spin-off of Southern Charm and revolves around Leva Bonaparte&#39;s club, Republic, and its employees. Several interesting and entertaining characters work for Leva, and the drama that ensued last season was enough for Bravo to want to bring it back for another wild season.




Last season of Southern Hospitality was full of captivating drama despite the cast being new to the reality TV world. There were relationship ups and downs between Maddi Reese and her boyfriend, Trevor Stokes, after he cheated on her, Joe Bradley&#39;s crush on Madi, Joe and Mia Alario&#39;s makeout session, Grace Lily simply being herself, and so much more. While season 1 was a great start to the series, it looks like Southern Hospitality season 2 will top last season.
