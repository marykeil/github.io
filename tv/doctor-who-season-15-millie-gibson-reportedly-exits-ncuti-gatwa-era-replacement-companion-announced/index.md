## Literature Review

Millie Gibson reportedly exits Doctor Who as the new companion Ruby Sunday after just one season, with her replacement already set for season 15.




The Doctor Who cast is undergoing a major shakeup. The show, which was revived in 2005 after running for 26 seasons between 1963 and 1989, follows the adventures of the titular Time Lord, a being with the ability to regenerate form and travel through time and space, along with a rotating roster of companions. The 2023 Christmas special introduced the new Doctor, played by Ncuti Gatwa, as well as his new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), though rumors have been swirling around Gibson&#39;s impending exit from the show.




Variety reports that the show will indeed be losing Millie Gibson, saying that she will exit the cast after Doctor Who season 14, which premieres this May. She will reportedly be replaced in season 15 by Varada Sethu as a new companion opposite Gatwa. Further details about her character are not yet known.


 Where You Know Varada Sethu 
          

Presuming these reports are accurate, Varada Sethu has a wide variety of experience that will help her succeed as a new addition to the Doctor Who cast. Her career began with a variety of small roles in major projects across both television and movies. Those early titles include 2016&#39;s Now You See Me 2 and 2019&#39;s Hanna, before she took on the role of LCpl. Manisha Chetri in Strike Back, which she played for a total of 17 episodes.



Strike Back was a Sky One and Cinemax spy drama that lasted for eight seasons between 2010 and 2020.







Since then, her most well-known projects have proved her ability to thrive in the science fiction genre as well as excel at stepping into a pre-established franchise. First, she played Department of Fish and Wildlife worker Shira opposite Laura Dern and Sam Neill in 2022&#39;s Jurassic World Dominion. She followed that by joining the Andor cast, starring in eight episodes of the Star Wars spinoff as the rebel Cinta Kaz.

With all of this experience under her belt, the transition between companions on Doctor Who should be relatively seamless. Despite Gibson&#39;s abrupt departure, the show is set up to handle the swapping out of companions, something that has happened dozens of times throughout its history. It seems likely that more details about the casting change and how it may play out onscreen will be revealed as the season 14 premiere date approaches.
