## Literature Review
Danny Wattley&#39;s Cutter was one of the most promising characters in the comedy-drama Loudermilk, so why did he vanish after season 1&#39;s ending?




The dramedy Loudermilk appeared to drop Danny Wattler’s character Cutter after season 1, but there was a behind-the-scenes reason for the show&#39;s choice. Loudermilk is a comedy-drama that focuses on the taciturn music critic Sam Loudermilk, a recovering alcoholic who can’t stop insulting everyone he meets. Although Loudermilk’s personal life is something of a mess, the show’s antihero does his best to act as a counselor for an addiction support group. Loudermilk’s mean streak is tempered by how much he cares about his group’s regulars, even if he is scarcely more prepared to help them than he is to help himself.




While Loudermilk’s cast of characters is full of recognizable faces, some of the show’s stars are less well-known. Ron Livingston of Band of Brothers fame plays the titular Loudermilk, while his sponsor, Ben Burns, is played by MadTV veteran Will Sasso. However, the various members of Loudermilk’s support group also get a chance to shine throughout the show’s three seasons, which aired from 2017 to 2020. Among these characters, Brendan McNamara’s Tom and Danny Wattley’s Cutter made for an engaging pairing in one season 1 subplot that ended abruptly. Cutter tried to help Tom with his recovery but was never seen after season 1.


 Cutter Didn&#39;t Return In Loudermilk Season 2 
          

Although his absence isn’t explained, Cutter doesn’t show up in Loudermilk season 2. The unfortunate reason was that the character of Cutter didn’t appear because Wattley was struggling with substance abuse issues, as revealed by the show’s executive producer Peter Farrelly in a 2020 interview with Deadline. Speaking about the show’s cult success, Farrelly said that “He fell off the wagon in real life,” thus justifying the series not asking Wattley to reprise his role in seasons 2 and 3. Farrelly then reassured readers that Wattley has since been through rehab and is now sober, meaning a prospective Loudermilk season 4 would feature his triumphant return. This could be particularly moving given Wattley’s real-life challenges.




While hit shows like The Bear and Mike Flanagan’s The Haunting of Hill House utilized groups like Alcoholics Anonymous in some subplots, it is rare for a show to mainly focus on the work of recovery. The sitcom Mom also managed to make recouping from substance abuse as funny as it was poignant, and Loudermilk could benefit from a similar approach in a potential season 4. The real-life resonance of Wattley’s own experiences could make his role as Cutter all the more moving, while Farrelly’s plans for Loudermilk to get his “mojo” back in season 4 sound like a fun, uplifting change of pace for the show.



 Why Danny Wattley Left Loudermilk 
          

Danny Wattley left Loudermilk to focus on his recovery, with Farrelly promising that a fourth season of the series would bring back his fan-favorite character. While the first three seasons of Loudermilk are now available to stream on Netflix, the show’s creators are still looking for a network to produce the fourth season. Farrelly says that he has numerous seasons planned beyond season 4, promising that Cutter&#39;s lingering plot line would be resolved. However, unless Loudermilk season 4 finds a financier, the show’s unfinished Cutter subplot might remain a mystery due to its sudden, unexplained ending.




  Loudermilk   Release Date   October 17, 2017    Cast   Ron Livingston , Will Sasso , Anja Savcic , Laura Mennell , Brian Regan , Ricky Blitt , Timothy Webber    Seasons   3
