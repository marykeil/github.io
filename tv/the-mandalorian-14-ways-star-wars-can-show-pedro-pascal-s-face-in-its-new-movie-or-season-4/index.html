  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Pedro Pascal&rsquo;s Din Djarin has only shown his face three times in The Mandalorian thus far - and either The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie or a potential season 4 could reveal his face again.
There are 14 potential ways Pascal&rsquo;s face as Din Djarin can be seen again, whether it be in a private moment to himself or in a dangerous situation with his future enemies.
The Armorer&rsquo;s changed views about Mandalorians who don&rsquo;t follow the Way could lead to a shift in the helmet rule and allow Din to show his face.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie will likely show Pedro Pascal&rsquo;s face more, and there are 14 different ways that Din Djarin could remove his helmet.</p>
<p>Pedro Pascal will continue to play Din Djarin, who never removes his helmet, in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, though there are 14 ways Star Wars could show the bounty hunter’s face. The upcoming movie The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be a continuation of The Mandalorian TV show. As a member of the religious group the Children of the Watch, Din&rsquo;s Creed, also called the Way of the Mandalore, prevents him from removing his helmet. Din has removed his helmet in the past, but the dire consequences it had for his belief system means that doing so again would be difficult.
Din removed his helmet and broke his Creed for Grogu twice in The Mandalorian season 2. He then started season 3 rejoining the Way by bathing in the Living Waters of Mandalore. Things have changed by the time of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, though, as Din adopted Grogu as his son in the ending of The Mandalorian season 3, and the Armorer reevaluated her views about other Mandalorians after meeting Bo-Katan Kryze. These changes could allow Din to show his face, either in the movie or a potential The Mandalorian season 4, and there are 14 explanations they could use.</p>
<p>How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.</p>
<p>14  The Mandalorians Could Have A &ldquo;Family Rule&rdquo;
Family Members May Be Able To See Each Other&rsquo;s Faces</p>
<p>The Way has been a mysterious religion through much of The Mandalorian, and many of the details of how the Creed works and is put into practice remain unknown to viewers. The logistics of always keeping a helmet on are tricky, and there could be exceptions to the rule for family members. Din had no immediate family prior to The Mandalorian season 3 finale, so he never had a family member to take his helmet off in front of. However, Din is Grogu&rsquo;s adoptive father now, and there could be an exception for members of an immediate family to see each other&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>13  Din Djarin Can Have A Private Moment
Din Can Remove His Helmet When He&rsquo;s By Himself</p>
<p>After helping Greef Karga retake Nevarro from marauding pirates, the Children of the Watch were given land on the planet to call home. Prior to that, Din had little private time to himself, as he always had to care for and watch Grogu. Now that he has a home, he could have more time by himself in which to remove his helmet, as Grogu is more independent and safe in their home. &ldquo;Chapter 4: Sanctuary&rdquo; featured one of Din&rsquo;s rare private moments, and he had no objection to removing his helmet then, though the camera didn&rsquo;t show it.</p>
<p>12  The Armorer Can Get Rid Of The Helmet Rule Once And For All
The Armorer Previously Allowed Bo-Katan Kryze To Remove Her Helmet</p>
<p>At the end of season 3, Bo-Katan took the rest of the Mandalorians back to their home planet, reclaiming it after Mandalore&rsquo;s destruction during the Great Purge. The Armorer endorsed Bo-Katan with the title of Mand&rsquo;alor because Bo-Katan was respected by all factions of Mandalorians and thus &ldquo;walked both worlds.&rdquo; This was a huge change in the Armorer&rsquo;s views about other Mandalorians who didn&rsquo;t follow the Way, and could be the first sign towards a larger shift in the religion. If she continues reevaluating the Children of the Watch&rsquo;s traditions, she might allow the followers to remove their helmets.</p>
<p>The Mandalorian: Din Djarin&rsquo;s Full Timeline, Backstory, &amp; Star Wars Future Explained
The Mandalorian&rsquo;s Din Djarin has quickly become one of Star Wars&rsquo; most iconic characters. Here&rsquo;s his full timeline, backstory, and future explained.</p>
<p>11  The Imperial Remnants Can Obtain Din Djarin&rsquo;s Morak Face Scan
Din Djarin&rsquo;s Face Was Scanned In The Mandalorain Season 2</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Chapter 15: The Believer,&rdquo; Din and Migs Mayfeld infiltrated an Imperial remnant base on Morak in an effort to find and rescue Grogu from Moff Gideon. They disguised themselves as stormtroopers, but Din eventually took his helmet off to submit to a facial scan to avoid being caught. The Imperial remnants will likely be featured as main antagonists again in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, and if they find the record of Din&rsquo;s scan, they could show Din&rsquo;s face in holograms.</p>
<p>10  Din Djarin Could Be Formally Initiated Into The New Republic
Din Djarin May Need Another Face Scan To Formally Join The New Republic</p>
<p>At the end of season 3, Din reached an unofficial agreement with Carson Teva, a pilot and officer for the New Republic in the Outer Rim, to do bounty hunting work for the galactic government. While their agreement is currently under-the-table, Din is an excellent bounty hunter, and word of his work for the New Republic could spread quickly. If the government hears about it, they could try to force Din to become an official employee of the government and require him to submit to a facial scan for their extensive records.</p>
<p>9  Din Djarin&rsquo;s Face Can Be Seen In A Potential Flashback
New Flashbacks Can Depict An Older Din Djarin</p>
<p>Din&rsquo;s backstory has never been fully explored. Aside from flashbacks to the attack on his homeworld of Aq Vetina that led to his introduction to the Children of the Watch, his past remains a mystery before he met Grogu. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu could explore more of his earlier days as a bounty hunter in the form of flashbacks. Since he will be training Grogu as a Mandalorian apprentice, earlier challenges he faced alone could be important to the way he approaches teaching and could influence the first lessons he gives to Grogu.
All 3 seasons of The Mandalorian are available for streaming on Disney+.</p>
<p>8  Din Djarin Could Get A New Paint Job
Din Has Yet To Update His Silver Beskar Armor</p>
<p>Din&rsquo;s armor has changed drastically since his debut, but his helmet has remained untouched. He is still the only Mandalorian in the covert with a shiny metallic set of brand-new armor, which sets him apart from other members. While his armor is iconic, it could be time for him to customize it more with a paint job.
Armor painting could be a significant moment for the Children of the Watch, and Din might have grown enough to earn the honor by taking Grogu as his apprentice. This would also be a chance to explore the Way further and explain what the other Mandalorians&rsquo; markings and colors mean. If he does have his armor painted, he might have to remove his helmet for the process.</p>
<p>7  Din Djarin&rsquo;s Helmet Could Be Damaged
The Enemies Din Will Face May Be Strong Enough To Break His Helmet</p>
<p>The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will likely raise the stakes for Din and Grogu. The main antagonist could be a big enough threat to do serious harm to Din, and could even damage or destroy his helmet in a fight. It would be an effective way to show the challenge the pair would be up against, and repairing or replacing the helmet would provide an opportunity to show Din&rsquo;s face. A new helmet would also illustrate that he is not the same man he was at the beginning of the show, and that he can rise to the occasion in the movie.</p>
<p>6  Din Djarin Could Be Injured Again
The Mandalorian Debuted Din&rsquo;s Face Due To His Injuries</p>
<p>The first time Din removed his helmet was due to his injuries in his first fight against Moff Gideon in season 1. IG-11 was able to remove the helmet in order to treat Din&rsquo;s wounds, as the Way of the Mandalore only specifies that Mandalorians can&rsquo;t let other living beings see their face, but it doesn&rsquo;t mention droids. This interesting loophole in the rule could be exploited again in the movie if he is seriously injured. Letting a droid tend to his injuries would allow Din&rsquo;s face some screen time.</p>
<p>5  Someone Could Surprise Din Djarin
Mandalorians Likely Remove Their Helmets While They Sleep</p>
<p>Mandalorians are allowed to remove their helmets in private, and they likely don&rsquo;t sleep with them on. If that is the case, a surprise attack at night might not leave Din enough time to put his helmet back on, and could lead to him fighting with a bare face. Since the Children of the Watch have an established home on Nevarro after season 3, their location is no longer a well-kept secret. This means that one of Din&rsquo;s enemies could find him, and if they are skilled enough, they could launch a surprise attack while he sleeps.</p>
<p>4  An Enemy Could Remove Din Djarin&rsquo;s Helmet
They May Remove His Helmet For Interrogation Or Intimidation</p>
<p>While the main antagonist of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has not yet been revealed, they would have to be extremely capable in order to pose a threat to one of the galaxy&rsquo;s greatest warriors. If they were able to capture or incapacitate Din long enough, they might have a chance to remove his helmet. This could either be done to interrogate Din, or by someone with much darker intentions. If his enemy was knowledgeable enough about the Way of the Mandalore, they could remove Din&rsquo;s helmet as a sign of disrespect and cruelty, knowing what implications that would have for his religion.</p>
<p>All 20 Times Din Djarin&rsquo;s Name Is Spoken In The Mandalorian (&amp; Everyone Who Knows It)
Even as one of Star Wars&rsquo; most popular characters, Din Djarin&rsquo;s name isn&rsquo;t used much in The Mandalorian. Here are all 20 times it&rsquo;s been said so far.</p>
<p>3  Din Djarin Breaks His Creed Again
Din May Be Willing To Break His Creed Again For His Loved Ones</p>
<p>Din could also remove his helmet voluntarily again, as he did in The Mandalorian season 2. Breaking his Creed a second time would have serious consequences, though, so it would have to be for a good reason. He could break it to rescue Grogu again, or there could be another obstacle he has to face without his helmet, such as the facial scan in season 2. Din has also made a long list of new and beloved friends and allies, so he could break his Creed for any one of them.</p>
<p>2  Din Djarin Could Bathe In The Living Waters Again
Another Drowning Disaster Could Force Din To Remove His Helmet</p>
<p>If Din did break his Creed for some reason, he would likely want to return to the Way of the Mandalore. To do this, he would have to return to the Living Waters on Mandalore. Din has almost drowned twice in The Mandalorian, and thus bathing in the Living Waters again could lead to his third near-death experience in water, and might require him to take off his helmet, either to be resuscitated or to use a rebreather. It could also be another chance for him to encounter the Mythosaur, which he missed during his last trip to the waters.</p>
<p>1  Din Djarin Could Leave The Children Of The Watch
Something May Cause Din To Abandon His Religion</p>
<p>Prior to The Mandalorian, Din had a very insular life with the Children of the Watch. He believed that all Mandalorians followed the Way of the Mandalore, and was surprised and offended when Bo-Katan and the Nite Owls removed their helmets in front of him in &ldquo;Chapter 11: The Heiress.&rdquo; Since then, he has seen that there is another way to live as a Mandalorian, that he has options outside the Children of the Watch. Din has also shown that he grew to love Grogu more than the Way by removing his helmet to bid him farewell.
If something drove a wedge between them, and Din was forced to choose between his religion and his son, he might leave the Children of the Watch entirely. The Mandalorian may have already laid the groundwork for that rift to form, though, as it is possible that Death Watch, the precursor to the Children of the Watch, staged the attack on Din&rsquo;s childhood homeworld of Aq Vetina. That would have devastating consequences if proven true, and it could be enough to drive Din out of his religion and remove the need to keep his helmet on at all times.
The next installment in Din Djarin&rsquo;s story, whether it be The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu or The Mandalorian season 4, is likely going to show Pedro Pascal&rsquo;s face more. Removing his helmet has proven devastating in the past, though, and he would only do it again for a very good reason. Luckily, these 14 potential explanations for Din&rsquo;s next face reveal are just a few of the many possible future scenarios. While it is unclear why exactly Din will remove his helmet next, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will certainly raise the stakes high enough to justify it.</p>
