## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s winner shared a shocking behind-the-scenes moment about the finale that viewers would never get to know about otherwise.




Squid Game: The Challenge finally crowned its winner in the finale episode, and the player who took home the largest prize in Netflix reality TV history is sharing some behind-the-scenes information about filming the finale. After competing against 455 other players, the winner of Squid Game: The Challenge came down to 3 players at the beginning of the finale episode. With the competition coming between player 287, Mai Whelan, player 016, Sam Lantz, and player 451, Phil Cain. After Phil was eliminated in the beginning of the episode during a game of chance, Mai and Sam were left to compete in the final game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.




In an interview with EW, the winner of Squid Game: The Challenge opened up about the final moments of the series. Mai, who won the final game over Sam, shared that “when I picked the key, I think I maybe didn&#39;t turn it hard enough. I was like, ‘Oh, it turned, but the safe door didn&#39;t open. Huh, maybe I didn&#39;t win.’” Mai shared that while she felt the key turn, adjudicators had to come in to check the safe. “We had to reshoot that scene…so I picked up that same key, come up to the safe, and open it.”

While Mai’s win had to be shot twice, there were other moments in the game that have stirred up both fans and players from Squid Game: The Challenge season 1. After her confrontation with Ashley Tolbert, player 278, during Glass Bridge, Mai faced criticism from other players in the game. “Everybody&#39;s entitled to their opinion. I just stick to my guns, and I want to make sure that it&#39;s played fairly and not just be a martyr,” Mai explained when asked about other players holding a grudge against her for targeting Ashley. “I worked too hard to eliminate myself…That&#39;s not a challenge that I signed up for.”


 

Squid Game: The Challenge, based off the South Korean drama Squid Game, takes the most compelling elements of the TV series and puts them into practice on the reality TV show. Removing the pieces of Squid Game that would be impossible to incorporate, like killing each player who’s eliminated from the game, Squid Game: The Challenge was a fascinating look at the will that each player in the game had to play entirely for themselves. Mai, who tried to help others when possible but ultimately kept her own game at the forefront, showed an interesting mix of emotions throughout her time on the series.




With Mai’s historic win in the books, Squid Game: The Challenge is looking ahead and moving toward its next installment. Though Mai may have been polarizing to some viewers, her win is a huge step forward for Netflix and the series as a whole, especially moving into Squid Game: The Challenge season 2. With cast members speaking up about their experiences on the series, Squid Game: The Challenge, there’s still more information from the show that will likely come up moving forward.
