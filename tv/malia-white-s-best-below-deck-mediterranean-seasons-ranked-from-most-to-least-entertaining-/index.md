## Literature Review
Malia White is one of the most well-known cast members from Below Deck Mediterranean. While she&#39;s only been on three seasons, they were memorable. 




Malia White is a well-known Below Deck Mediterranean alum, and she&#39;s had a few memorable seasons that were entertaining. Malia joined the series in 2017 during Below Deck Med season 2. At the time, Malia was a deckhand and later moved up in the ranks to lead deckhand. She then returned to seasons 5 and 6 as a bosun but hasn&#39;t returned to the show since. Despite not making a comeback to Below Deck Med in two seasons, almost every season Malia has appeared in was entertaining. Even though Malia seems pretty low-drama, she&#39;s been at the center of it in a majority of her seasons.




Whether she&#39;s involved in a love triangle or not getting along with crew members, Malia always found herself in the middle of petty drama on board. Judging from her seasons, Malia seems like the type of person who wants to focus on her job and work on moving up in her career. She doesn&#39;t have time to get involved in drama; however, it does seem to follow her every season. Even in Winter House season 3, which Malia currently stars in, Malia has found herself in a weird love triangle with Kory Keefer and his girlfriend, Sam Hefer. Despite wanting to stay out of the drama, it always finds her.

 Below Deck Med Season 5 (Most Entertaining) 
         

Below Deck Med season 5 was definitely Malia&#39;s most entertaining season. The reason why is her issues with Chief Stew Hannah Ferrier. The two began the season on somewhat good terms, as the pair were never friends but were never enemies. They decided to share a cabin together to develop a closer relationship, seeing as they were both heads of their departments. Everything seemed to be going well between them until Chef Hindrigo &#34;Kiko&#34; Lorran was fired. Since they were down a chef, Malia suggested her boyfriend at the time, Tom Checkett, join the team. Captain Sandy Yawn agreed and hired him for the rest of the season.




However, Tom joining the season created a rift between Malia and Hannah. Since her boyfriend was now onboard, she wanted to share a room with him and hoped Hannah would move cabins. She refused, which upset Malia. What happened next is the reason Below Deck Med season 5 was Malia&#39;s most entertaining. Malia ended up finding Valium and a vape pen in her and Hannah&#39;s cabin and reported it to Captain Sandy, leading Hannah to get fired. Malia became the most hated Below Deck cast member for a long time, but at least she made the season entertaining. It was all Bravo fans could talk about.



 Below Deck Med Season 2 
          

Below Deck Med season 2 was Malia&#39;s introduction to the Below Deck franchise and reality TV. The reason her first season made it to the second spot is her love triangle with Chef Adam Glick and Bosun Wes Walton. Before Malia had joined the boat, she met Adam while the two were in Florida. The pair hit it off and dated for a bit prior to joining Below Deck Med season 2. However, before entering the yacht, Malia and Adam decided to keep their relationship a secret from the rest of the crew.




Even though they both wanted to keep their relationship on the down low, Adam spilled the beans after Malia took more of an interest in Wes. Malia was obviously furious and decided to end whatever she and Adam had and focus on Wes. Her decision upset Adam, and he went on a bit of a downward spiral after Malia confirmed they would never be anything more than friends.

After seeing the way Adam acted after she ended their relationship, she realized she dodged a bullet with him. The love triangle was the most interesting part of Below Deck Med season 2, and Malia was at the center of it. This season is what made Malia such a captivating Below Deck cast member. She is at the center of the drama but still tries to stay far away from it. Malia is one of the reasons why this season was so entertaining to watch.



 Below Deck Med Season 6 (Least Entertaining) 
          




Below Deck Med season 6 was not only Malia&#39;s least entertaining season but one of the most boring in the series. It was the first Below Deck Med season without Chief Stew Hannah as the lead of the interior, with Katie Flood replacing her. Viewers were clearly not ready for a new chief stew, especially since Hannah was fired for reasons many still do not understand to this day. Since Malia was part of her firing, viewers were not ready to see Malia back on their screens. However, Below Deck Med season 6 became Malia&#39;s redemption season.

Fans enjoyed watching Malia bond with her deckhands and her blossoming friendship with Katie. The two are even starring in Winter House season 3 together now. Viewers quickly forgot about the drama she caused the season before and how she got a beloved cast member fired. Despite season 6 being her redemption season, it was Malia&#39;s least entertaining. In her seasons prior, Malia was always at the center of the drama, but during this season, she stayed far away from it. Even when Stew Lexi Wilson was causing drama in the interior team, Malia didn&#39;t want to mess up her drama-less season by getting involved.




Overall, Below Deck Med season 6, Malia&#39;s final season was her least entertaining because she didn&#39;t partake in any drama. She focused on developing good relationships with her team, which worked out for her. Since season 6 was her final season, Malia ended her time on the show on a good note, even if it was her least entertaining season.
