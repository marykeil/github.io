## Literature Review
Laguna Beach icon Stephen Colletti was dating Alex Weaver, and they have a major relationship update. What&#39;s going on between the two?




Laguna Beach alum Stephen Colletti started dating in 2022, and here&#39;s everything viewers need to know about her. Stephen has been linked with plenty of women, but Alex is the lucky one who stole his heart. Since making their Instagram debut, everyone seems to support the relationship. While Stephen turned down a role in Laguna Beach: New Beginnings, he&#39;s still in the spotlight due to his relationship with Alex.




In August 2022, 37-year-old Stephen confirmed his relationship with Alex, and the two have remained very public ever since. Stephen has been connected to many women over the years, and while his star has dimmed since leaving the public eye of Laguna Beach, his dating life remains present in the media. Over the years, he dated co-stars Kristin Cavallari and Lauren Conrad and even embarked on a year-long relationship with Hayden Panettiere. Who is Stephen&#39;s newest flame?

Based on information Alex shared in a Reddit AMA (via u/al_weave), she was born and raised there. According to the Reddit thread, she was &#34;Born and raised here in the Charlotte area, so I grew up around NASCAR. My grandfather was a HUGE fan and never missed a race on Sundays.&#34; As for where she went to university, Alex graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Communication and Media Studies. She loves volunteering for the Special Olympics and the Ronald McDonald House Charities Of Charlotte.

Happily, Alex and Stephen shared via Instagram in November 2023 that they got engaged. The picture was captioned, &#34;Yes! Forever.&#34; Alex and Stephen are pictured kissing on a wall in Italy with the city of Rome in the background. Commenters were thrilled for the couple, saying, &#34;Yeeeehaw!!! He needed a NASCAR girlie!!&#34; and &#34;You done outkicked your coverage. Congrats!&#34; Everyone appears excited for the couple.

There isn&#39;t much known about her relationships before she started dating Stephen. However, some fans were shocked when the Laguna Beach star began a relationship with Alex rather than his former costar, Kristin. Stephen is almost a decade older than Alex, and it seems like he&#39;s been involved in more relationships than she has. The ten years made no difference to Stephen, who proposed to Alex in November 2023. Hopefully, the couple will have many happy years to come.
