## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé fans were certain that Sheila Mangubat was pregnant after seeing her recent birthday videos. She is finally addressing the baby rumors.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Sheila Mangubat revealed if she&#39;s pregnant with partner David Dangerfield&#39;s baby. Sheila is a resident of Cebu who met Omaha man David in a Facebook group for deaf singles. David, 42, was a lonely man who had been cheated on by his ex-girlfriend. He longed for a wife and was impressed with Sheila as they soon entered a long-distance relationship for two years. David met Sheila in person during Before the 90 Days season 6 and was moved by the heartbreaking situation she was living in. David proposed to Sheila as he helped her build a better house in the Philippines. David and Sheila are currently waiting for her K-1 visa to arrive.




Sheila recently turned 33 years old, and while David is not with her in person, he&#39;s been sharing videos of Sheila&#39;s birthday celebrations on Instagram.


 

The video showed Sheila wearing a flowy purple top with black shorts and her hair tied in a high ponytail. She looked happy as she received several gifts from her friends and family, such as greeting cards, balloons, and flowers. David wrote, &#34;Was her birthday party yesterday,&#34; in his caption, but most of his comments were from fans asking, &#34;Is she pregnant?&#34; and &#34;I’ve been wondering if she is pregnant.&#34; Sheila replied to one of them saying, &#34;I am not really...preggy.&#34;

Sheila continued, &#34;I&#39;m just gaining weight.&#34; Sheila explained that she was gaining weight because she wasn&#39;t under stress anymore. &#34;No more stress,&#34; she added. Sheila and David&#39;s first in-person meeting was tragic, to say the least. While the couple was happy to see each other and didn&#39;t face any relationship issues, Sheila faced a personal loss during David&#39;s Philippines visit. He went to see her parents at her home and was shocked when he saw she was living in poverty. Sheila didn&#39;t have a proper roof over her head. While he stayed in the house for a night, they woke up the next morning to find that her mother, Ma Remedios, had died.

David didn&#39;t have enough money for Sheila to fix her house, but he did whatever he could to help her. Sheila, who had lost her job during the COVID-19 pandemic, opened her own sari-sari store. She started making her own money and is living a happy life. However, Sheila and David are still in a long-distance relationship because of their visa woes. Sheila wanted to marry David in the Philippines as she wanted her family to attend the ceremony. A spousal visa would have taken Sheila three to four years to come to America. The wait for a fiancé visa is much shorter, so David started the K-1 visa process.




The couple has yet to reunite as Sheila&#39;s video confirms she&#39;s still not in America. They were one of the most popular and drama-free couples on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. Hopefully, David and Sheila&#39;s wholesome storyline returns to TLC soon. The network will likely cast the two of them for another spin-off, considering there&#39;s still a lot of interest in their relationship.
