## Literature Review
A new teaser image for Ahsoka season 2 has just dropped, and it sets up both Baylan Skoll&#39;s return &amp; the reveal of ancient secrets of the Force.




A teaser image for Ahsoka season 2 just dropped, and it sets up Baylan Skoll&#39;s return and the reveal of ancient Force secrets. Ahsoka season 1 left audiences with a lot of questions. However, one thing the finale made clear is that Peridea is deeply connected to the Force, and Baylan Skoll appeared to be aware of that before he left a galaxy far, far away. This brought up a lot of questions. The latest Ahsoka teaser image implies that these questions will play a big role in season 2.




                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    

Star Wars&#39; official Twitter account just posted a sketch of Ahsoka and Sabine standing on the arm of the same statue of the Father - one of the enigmatic Force gods of Mortis - that was previously seen in Ahsoka&#39;s ending. The pencil sketch depicts Ahsoka and Sabine standing on the outstretched finger of the statue, staring in the direction it is pointing. This suggests that the statue may be pointing to some important artifact or secret. The fact that the ancient Mortis gods are manifestations of the Force itself and Baylan is interested in them also implies that important Force secrets will be revealed.


 





 The Mortis Gods Are Clearly A Major Part Of Ahsoka Season 2 
          

Given that Ahsoka and Sabine are standing on the hand of the Father, it is obvious that the Mortis gods will play a big role in Ahsoka season 2. Another indication of this is that, since Ahsoka was brought back to life by the Daughter in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, she is connected to the Mortis gods. At the end of Ahsoka season 1, Ahsoka told Sabine that she had a feeling that they were exactly where they needed to be. Given Ahsoka&#39;s deep connection to the Mortis gods and their presence on Peridea, it seems inevitable that their paths will align with Baylan Skoll&#39;s.

Tragically, Baylan Skoll actor Ray Stevenson passed away on May 21, 2023. As such, unless Star Wars chooses to recast him, Baylan&#39;s story will remain unfinished. However, he could still cross paths with Ahsoka and Sabine. There are a couple of ways this could happen: they could meet off-screen or Ahsoka and Sabine could find evidence that Baylan died in pursuit of his mission. Either way would work, as the teaser image proves that Ahsoka and Sabine will be following the same path as Baylan.




It is also possible that Shin Hati will carry on Baylan&#39;s legacy in Ahsoka season 2. After all, she was his apprentice. If he is killed off-screen in an attempt to discover whatever secrets of the Force he is looking for, Shin could find out and choose to fulfill her former Master&#39;s mission. Alternatively, since Ahsoka offered Shin help before and Ahsoka and Sabine will be searching for the Mortis gods themselves in season 2, Shin could team up with them.
