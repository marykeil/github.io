## Literature Review
Welcome to Plathville&#39;s Kim Plath made headlines with her DUI arrest. However, the Meggs family also has its fair share of legal problems. 




Welcome to Plathville&#39;s Kim Plath dominated headlines when news surfaced that she was arrested and facing DUI charges, but the Meggs family also has legal issues. The Plaths aren&#39;t the only ones dealing with the aftermath of running into trouble with the law. In fact, Olivia Plath&#39;s relatives are faced with severe legal problems.




In the wake of Olivia and Ethan Plath&#39;s divorce, there&#39;s renewed interest in the Meggs family. Olivia is the oldest of nine siblings: Micah, Elijah, Joshua, Elise, Lydia, Sophia, Nathan, Carris, and Kristen. Her brother Micah tragically passed away in 2023 after a bike accident. However, there is more controversy and tragedy with the Meggs family beyond Olivia&#39;s divorce and her brother&#39;s fatal accident.


 Lydia Revealed Micah&#39;s Legal Issues 


 

 

In an interview with realiteasquad at YouTube, Lydia was asked if she was open to discussing the legal issues the Plath family is dealing with. She didn&#39;t shy away from the topic, and described it as a nightmare that her little sisters should never have had to endure. Lydia summed up the situation by saying, â€œMy brother Micah ended up stabbing my younger sister just because he was upset.&#34; She explained that her brother, Micah, had psychological issues, but her parents blamed his cerebral palsy for his unexpected behavior. However, Lydia said that it didn&#39;t justify his actions. He was attending therapy before his death.






 The Meggs Family Was Divided On Micah&#39;s Issues 
          

Lydia explained how the shocking incident turned their family upside down. She said that her brother-in-law was a cop, and when he saw her younger sister&#39;s stab wound, he told her parents that they needed to get Micah help from mental healthcare professionals. They claimed they would, but never did, and that is when her brother-in-law decided to file a report. Social services then removed Lydia&#39;s little sisters from the home. The court trial took place in April 2022, but the charges were dropped, as social services removed the children from the home before an investigation took place. In addition to Micah&#39;s struggle before his death, Nathan, another sibling, also got a DUI.

Lydia was frustrated by the outcome and blamed her in-laws for their lack of understanding and awareness. She said, &#34;Anyone who grew up in this culture will know what I am talking about. Parents tend to be manipulative, mentally abusive, sometimes physically abusive, and emotionally abusive.&#34; 




Lydia explained that her parents, Don and Karen Meggs, didn&#39;t have any plans to get Micah the help that he so desperately needed because they believed that Micah had demons that they could pray away. She further stated that in their culture, they don&#39;t understand what psychological issues mean and relate everything back to the Bible. Lydia claimed that her parents also have &#34;so many&#34; psychological issues, but because they don&#39;t believe in mental health care, they are never going to get help.

Lydia revealed no one was talking to each other amid the legal issues, though Micah&#39;s death certainly changed things. The Meggs sister leaned on Olivia for support during this difficult time. She said that the two never got along in the past, but together, their family brought them together. After tragedy and legal issues, the Meggs family must pick up the pieces of their familial life on and offscreen in Welcome to Plathville.
