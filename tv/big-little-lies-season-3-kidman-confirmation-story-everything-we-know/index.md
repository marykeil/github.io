  Nicole Kidman confirms the return of Big Little Lies for season 3 in a Q&amp;A, but there is no official confirmation from HBO.   The main challenge for season 3 will be getting all the star-studded cast members to return.

## Literature Review
Nicole Kidman seemingly confirmed that Big Little Lies season 3 was officially on the way, but will the popular crime drama actually come back? 




The hit crime drama Big Little Lies is reportedly returning for a third season, and there are already exciting updates about the previously canceled show. Debuting in 2017 and based on the eponymous novel by Liane Moriarty, Big Little Lies follows five women in the ritzy community of Monterey, California as they find themselves the principal suspects in a murder investigation. With its brilliant characters and gripping twists, the first season had viewers on HBO enthralled, and it even snagged an impressive 16 Emmy nominations.




One of the things that made Big Little Lies so successful was its star-studded cast, and the likes of Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Zoë Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern all returned for the second season. What was originally intended to be a miniseries blossomed into an ongoing show, and the overwhelming popularity of Big Little Lies was the prime motivator for the second season. Though there were things about Big Little Lies season 2 that didn&#39;t work, it was still popular enough to draw in a big audience. Its rather abrupt ending has had fans clamoring for season 3 ever since, and there are finally positive updates.

 Big Little Lies Season 3 Latest News 
Reese Witherspoon Confirms She&#39;s Working On Big Little Lies Season 3
         

Though information has been scant, the latest news finds Reese Witherspoon confirm her involvement in Big Little Lies season 3. Just a few short months after Nicole Kidman subtly announced that a third season was in the works, her co-star Reese Witherspoon has come forward to mention that she is working alongside Kidman on the new season. In a somewhat coy statement, Witherspoon said &#34;We are working on it. Nic [Kidman] and I are working on it.&#34; Despite Kidman and Witherspoon&#39;s statements, HBO still has not officially announced the project. 






 Big Little Lies Season 3 Is Confirmed By Nicole Kidman (But Not HBO) 
Nicole Kidman Announces A New Season
          

Nicole Kidman has confirmed Big Little Lies season 3, and it comes as quite a shock considering the heap of news to the contrary that has surfaced since its 2019 season 2 finale. The Hollywood legend spoke rather candidly in a Q&amp;A, and nonchalantly revealed a new season. She said, &#34;I loved Big Little Lies...We will be bringing you a third one, just FYI&#34;. This is an exciting development, though it is important to point out that nobody at HBO has backed up her claim, and Big Little Lies season 3 isn&#39;t on any official HBO slate.



 Which Big Little Lies Cast Members Will Return For Season 3? 
Will The Main Cast Return?
          




For Big Little Lies season 3 to work, the Monterey Five will have to come back en masse, but that is no easy feat considering they are some of the most in-demand women in Hollywood. Zoë Kravitz has expressed doubt about the show&#39;s return, citing the untimely death of director Jean-Marc Valée. Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon&#39;s involvement in the third season seems to suggest they&#39;ll return as Celeste Wright and Madeline Mackenzie, respectively, though that has not been confirmed.

Either way, if the show was to come back, all the big names should be expected, including:

 Actor  Big Little Lies Role   Shailene Woodley  Jane Chapman   Zoë Kravitz  Bonnie Carlson   Laura Dern  Renata Klein   Alexander Skarsgård  Perry Wright   Adam Scott  Ed Mackenzie   Meryl Streep  Mary Louise Wright   








 Big Little Lies Season 3 Story 
What Could Happen In Season 3?
          

It is important to note that Big Little Lies season 1 completed Liane Moriarty&#39;s original story, and season 2 was an entirely new narrative based on the characters and situations from the book. Therefore, season 3 would be similar, which makes the narrative possibilities endless following the ending of Big Little Lies season 2. With the Monterey Five turning themselves in to the police in the final episode, season 3 could address what happened to the women after they came clean.

The series has always been about guilt juxtaposed with the wild privilege of its setting, and season 3 could put more focus on Zoë Kravitz&#39;s Bonnie, as she is essentially the impetus for the entire plot. The new season could follow up right where season 2 left off, or it could acknowledge the years that have passed, and see how the intervening time affected the central players in the story. Regardless. Big Little Lies season 3 is certainly narratively possible.
