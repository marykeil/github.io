## Literature Review
Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Sutton Stracke was married to ex-husband Christian Stracke for over a decade before their divorce. 




Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Sutton Stracke is excited about her new man, Santos, but she was once married to her ex-husband, Christian Stracke. One cast member who has been stirring the pot so far in RHOBH season 13 is Sutton. Besides getting into an explosive dinner fight with RHOBH season 13 cast member Kyle Richards, Sutton hasn&#39;t kept quiet about her new man pet horse, Santos, a Friesian Warmblood Crossbreed, which she bought for $47,000.




However, Sutton can afford to spend such an amount after her divorce from her ex-husband Christian, which lasted for almost two decades, left her surprisingly richer. Sutton reportedly received over $2 million in cash, homes, cars, artwork, and investment properties. The RHOBH star also receives $300,000 a month in spousal support. Although Sutton was blindsided by Christian&#39;s decision to end their marriage, she is doing just fine with the wealth she received from the divorce proceedings.
