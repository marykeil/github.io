## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Season 5 is coming to a close, and many cast members are being recognized for their outrageously bad behavior onscreen.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 appeared just after season 4, and it was filled with even more drama and a whole host of new villains. The popular 90 Day Fiancé franchise spin-off show featured eight couples, with only Yohan Geronimo and Daniele Gates returning for their drama. This led to the introduction of a number of brand news 90 Day Fiancé franchise villains over the season, which stretched for nearly two-dozen episodes.
Out of the eight couples featured during The Other Way season 5, only Armando Rubio and Kenny Niedermeier avoided becoming villains. Neither of the men saw their reputations plummeting in the franchise as they dealt with drama over their possible surrogacy and where to live in Mexico. However, the other seven couples had at least one half of the pairs acting badly. Such behavior contributed to 90 Day Fiancé:The Other Way season 5 being full of drama, as well as major fights, and break-ups. However, some cast members certainly acted out more than others during the popular reality TV show. 









 








 7  Holly Weeks Was Dramatic 


 







Holly Weeks appeared on The Other Way season 5 with Wayne Cornish, a South African man whom the American married. Wayne was not perfect, as he lied to Holly about his financial situation and concealed things from her. However, this didn&#39;t justify the way Holly treated him. Holly was prone to throwing tantrums and acting out when she didn&#39;t get her way, such as on her wedding day. Holly eventually felt as though she couldn&#39;t cope in South Africa and ambushed Wayne with complaints as he returned home from work one day. This led to her leaving Wayne to return to the US, which made him feel abandoned in their marriage.





 6  Tejaswi Goswami &amp; His Family Drama 
        

Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami married American Kim during The Other Way season 5, though both TJ and his family made the process very difficult for the American woman. TJ came across as sweet and accommodating on the surface. However, he misled Kim about what her life would really be like in India. It was unfair of him to give her false expectations, especially when it came to her role in his family. TJ and his family expected Kim, an American, to become a traditional Indian wife. This difference in desires led to a major clash between Kim and her in-laws. She also had multiple verbal spars with her brother-in-law.





 5  Kimberly Rochelle Was A Nightmare 
        

Meanwhile, Kim was a nightmare in her own right during 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5. The American woman, who claims to be a clairvoyant, did not adjust well to life in India. Kim was prone to tantrums and freaking out, including a now-infamous scream in the season finale as she openly wailed. Kim was often hot and cold with her feelings and preferred to freak out and throw tantrums rather than talk things through. She also resorted to name-calling, including at the season 5 Tell All. The American lashed out at fellow American 90 Day Fiancé franchise cast member Jenny Slatten and called her the c-word in fury.





 4  Julio Moya Is Dragged By Viewers 
        

Kirsten Schoemaker and Julio Moya split during season 5, which led to a very messy Tell All confrontation. Kirsten is firmly backed by 90 Day Fiancé franchise fans, while Julio has a negative reputation. The American man was cold when he split with the Netherlands beauty over video call and laughed while she cried. Julio came to the reunion trying to turn viewers against his ex instead, as he revealed he secretly recorded Kirsten and thought she cheated on him. Kirsten denied the allegations and accused Julio of cheating. Overall, Julio came across as shady and vindictive. He also hid his relationship with Kirsten from his family for a year.





 3  Sarper Güven Focused On Machismo 
        

90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 newcomers Sarper Güven and Shekinah Garner had a colorful plot line full of memorable lines that often painted Sarper in a very bad light. Sarper struggled with English but still selected obviously rude words when talking to Shekinah and her sister. He made it clear that he wanted to control Shekinah, including her weight and appearance, while he bragged many times about sleeping with 2,500 women. He also was reluctant to make his relationship public. While Shekinah assures 90 Day Fiancé franchise fans that she wants to be controlled, their relationship still comes across as worrisome to many of their fellow cast members.





 2  Mary Demasu-ay Behaved Horribly 


 







Mary Demasu-ay led the first half of the season as an almost comical-level villain to Brandan DeNuccio. Mary was insanely controlling, including having a meltdown and almost dumping Brandan when he was seated next to a woman on his flight to The Philippines. Mary demanded that she FaceTime Brandan every minute of the day but lied to him about her social life. However, she cooled off a bit when she found out she was pregnant. Surprisingly, Mary and Brandan are still together and are parents now. Though Mary was more of a villain in the first half of The Other Way season 5, she certainly made a terrible impression on viewers.





 1  Yohan Geronimo Turned Out To Be A Scammer 


Yohan and Daniele are now three seasons deep with 90 Day Fiancé franchise content, and their time on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 was their demise. 90 Day Fiancé franchise personality Yohan was exposed at the Tell All by his soon-to-be ex-wife. It turned out that the Dominican man was messaging and sleeping with many women throughout his relationship with Daniele, as his goal was money. He was exposed for asking numerous women around the world for money. Meanwhile, he made it clear that he married Daniele, an American, for money and to have his life financed.
Overall, the season was full of villains, with hardly a hero to be found. Only cast members such as Kirsten and fan-favorites Armando Rubio and Kenny Niedermeier really came across as favorable. 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 might be in the bag, but fans can soon catch more drama during 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 when it airs on January 1.
