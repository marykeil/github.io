 Andrew Herr &amp; Tyler Johnston Discuss Letterkenny Season 12 
          

Screen Rant: Good to see you both again and to talk about Letterkenny, sadly though, for the final time. I&#39;d like to hear from both of you, maybe Andrew then Tyler, how it feels bringing this iconic show to an end?


Andrew Herr: It&#39;s tough to articulate, I think, right now. But I do find myself just looking back on [things and] obviously very appreciative of the fans supporting your show, but selfishly — maybe selfish isn&#39;t the right word — just looking back at all the great times we had together as a cast, and just feeling very grateful that I met some of my best friends, Tyler being one of them. Sorry, the other Tyler, not Tyler Tyler. [Chuckles] But yeah, I just feel very grateful, and it kind of makes you feel emotional inside about all the good times we had together, and I think this season ended with a bang.






Tyler Johnston: Absolutely, I&#39;m the same way. I&#39;m extremely proud of this show we put out into the world. We worked hard, we had a lot of fun, I think we managed to have a lot of fun during the making of it. I don&#39;t think we took it for granted, and it&#39;s going to be an adjustment period for sure, moving forward. This has been a big part of our lives, nine years, and I know we&#39;re only a few days past our final release here, so we&#39;re still doing some processing. Like Andrew said, we all got emotions that we&#39;re kind of working through, and probably will continue to do so for a while, but the amazing feedback from the fans over the last couple of days has certainly felt phenomenal.


Well, it&#39;s well deserved, because you guys have stayed consistently great throughout the 12 seasons. One thing I love to hear from people when a show is coming to an end, especially with a show like Letterkenny, you have so many iconic catchphrases from both of your characters throughout the show. Which one are you going to miss getting to be a part of your work lexicons as you move forward?





Tyler Johnston: I didn&#39;t have too many, I didn&#39;t get to have too many disses, I was usually the one getting dissed. But for me, the one I really liked was &#34;shirt tucker,&#34; because it almost felt like motherf---er. So it was like I could lean into shir tucker a little bit, and it was the one that I felt like I had some power over. &#34;You have your life together so much that you&#39;re tucking in your shirt, you loser.&#34; [Laughs] So that always felt like an interesting insult that I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll call anyone in my life a shirt tucker, but it felt good at the time.



Andrew Herr: That&#39;s a tough question. I don&#39;t know why, I always loved when there would be a girl walking by, and I would always be like &#34;snipe!&#34;. I don&#39;t know why, maybe it&#39;s the tone of it, but I just loved saying that. I think I&#39;ll miss saying that, because I definitely don&#39;t say that.



Tyler Johnston: Something we can&#39;t do in real life.






Andrew Herr: Like walk around Toronto, going, &#34;Snipe, snipe, snipe&#34; [Laughs] —



Tyler Johnston: &#34;Sniper, sniper, sniper&#34;. [Laughs]



Andrew Herr: I also have a fiancée, so I&#39;m gonna keep the horse blinders on. Yeah, I mean, all of it, Dylan and I had so many just ridiculous things to say. Specifically, I think it&#39;s like season 2 or season 2, we&#39;re talking about getting our space dink sucked in outer space and sucking on Martian t----es. It&#39;s like, &#34;What are we even saying? Like, what are we actually f---ng saying?&#34; [Laughs] But it was hilarious.


          

Some of the writing has just been wild throughout these 12 seasons, and I&#39;ve loved it from start to finish. Before I let you both go, one thing I love is that Jared did just sign this big deal with Hulu for potential future spinoffs. Do you guys have hopes to either appear in those or even be the center of those if the opportunity were to present itself?





Tyler Johnston: Absolutely. I know as much as you know, Grant. But I know Jared is a creative dude, and if he taps me on the shoulder, I&#39;ll hop on the ice and bury Geno&#39;s, buddy. But I&#39;m very excited for him to get an opportunity. How often do you see people, creators, get the confidence of networks like, &#34;Hey, you want this many episodes? Get after it, have some fun.&#34; Whether or not I&#39;m involved in any more of the projects, I&#39;m extremely proud of him and the product we put out there, and the future will be what it is, we&#39;ll see.



Andrew Herr: And it&#39;s great for Canada. We don&#39;t have a history of doing deals like that, I think it&#39;s pretty groundbreaking, and I think he&#39;s paving the way for other Canadian creatives to give them an extra bit of motivation that, &#34;Hey, anything you can do, it is possible to be done.&#34; So, I think, us aside, or me aside, it&#39;s really great for the Canadian film industry



Tyler Johnston: We&#39;re curious, too, to see what happens. Us removed from the situation, it&#39;s like we&#39;ve talked about it privately, &#34;Which characters do you think would be the ones that would get the spinoff?&#34; for a while. So, we&#39;re you&#39;re curious to see, as well. We had a heck of a run, we had 82 episodes you know, so if the particulars pass to somebody else, we&#39;re excited to see where it goes.







 About Letterkenny Season 12 
         

The residents of Letterkenny belong to one of three groups: the Hicks, the Skids, and the Hockey Players, who are constantly feuding over seemingly trivial matters that often end with someone getting their ass kicked. In Season 12, the small town contends with a comedy night at Modean&#39;s, a country music hit, the Degens&#39; bad influence, a new nightclub, and an encore at the Ag Hall. And that’s just for starters.

Check out our other interview with Michelle Mylett and Dylan Playfair.



All seasons of Letterkenny are now available to stream on Hulu.
