## Literature Review
An update surrounding the upcoming Superman &amp; Lois season 4 includes a neat DC Comics Easter egg hinting at Doomsdayâ€™s future in the show.




Superman &amp; Lois season 4&#39;s most recent update includes a neat Easter egg to Doomsday from DC Comics. As the final remaining Arrowverse TV show in production, Superman &amp; Lois&#39; popularity cannot be understated. This popularity has led to much disappointment that Superman &amp; Lois is ending with season 4, though the show almost being canceled after season 3 would have caused much more controversy. Nevertheless, despite the CW almost not picking up the show for a final season, Superman &amp; Lois season 4&#39;s story will give the beloved CW entry the send-off it deserves.




                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.    

With the production of Superman &amp; Lois season 4 now underway, updates about the show&#39;s final season will likely come thick and fast throughout 2024. These updates will be highly anticipated by those familiar with the show after Superman &amp; Lois season 3&#39;s ending featured a massive cliffhanger. Superman &amp; Lois season 3 saw Lex Luthor enact his master plan to destroy Superman by unleashing Doomsday, the iconic villain of the Man of Steel from DC Comics. Therefore, the first update from Superman &amp; Lois season 4 contains a neat Easter egg to the character from DC Comics and further teases the continuation of season 3&#39;s major cliffhanger.


 Superman &amp; Lois Season 4 Premiere Title References Doomsday&#39;s First Comics Appearance 
          




The update on Superman &amp; Lois&#39; season 4 production start came from Lois Lane actress Elizabeth Tulloch who posted the script for the show&#39;s next episode. As per the update, the title of Superman &amp; Lois season 4, episode 1 was revealed as &#34;The End &amp; The Beginning.&#34; Without any context, this title still makes logical sense given that Superman &amp; Lois season 4 will conclude the show, with the title aptly teasing its culmination.

However, the title also marks a subtle connection to DC Comics, specifically the character of Doomsday who will undoubtedly play a major role in Superman &amp; Lois season 4 after season 3&#39;s cliffhanger. In DC Comics, the character of Doomsday first appeared in &#34;Superman: The Man of Steel #18&#34; in 1992. On the cover of this issue, the words &#34;The beginning of the end! Doomsday!&#34; can be spotted in the lower-right corner. Herein lies the connection between Doomsday&#39;s first issue and Superman &amp; Lois season 4 with the title of episode 1 of the latter echoing the former.






 The Superman &amp; Lois Season 4 Premiere Needs To Resolve Season 3&#39;s Doomsday Cliffhanger 
          

This Doomsday reference found in Superman &amp; Lois season 4 only increases the need for the premiere of the show to resolve season 3&#39;s cliffhanger. Interestingly, it was unclear for a while that Superman &amp; Lois would continue after season 3 which left the cliffhanger battle with Doomsday in complete limbo. Even if Superman &amp; Lois season 4 had been confirmed before season 3&#39;s finale, the Doomsday cliffhanger would have been incredibly tantalizing regarding anticipation for a continuation.

This meant that the unclear status of Superman &amp; Lois season 4 made the wait for a resolution to the Doomsday cliffhanger even worse. Now that Superman &amp; Lois season 4 is thankfully confirmed, the premiere has to resolve what happens between Clark and Doomsday. With that in mind, it seems as though audiences of Superman &amp; Lois will get their wish if the Doomsday reference in episode 1&#39;s title is anything to go by.
