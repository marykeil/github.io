## Literature Review
Sister Wives star and Kody and Christine&#39;s daughter Mykelti is facing heavy criticism online. Thankfully, she has Janelle to defend her on Instagram.




Sister Wives star Janelle Brown is calling out the reality TV show viewers who bully Christine Brown&#39;s daughter Mykelti Ann Brown. Janelle and Kody met in the fall of 1989, shortly before he met and married his first wife, Meri Brown. Kody&#39;s dad, William Winn Brown, and Janelle’s mom, Sheryl Brown, were married and thus made Kody and Janelle stepsiblings. Janelle and Kody had six children together, while Kody also had six children with his third wife, Christine. Although Mykelti is one of Christine’s kids, Janelle has a soft spot for her.




Janelle is fiercely protective of Mykelti and proved what lengths she can go to make sure Christine’s daughter is safe (as shared by Monsters&amp;Critics.)

          

It all started with Mykelti Brown’s husband, Tony Padron, posting a video of him and Mykelti from their “little weekend wedding escapade” recorded using a 360-degree spinning camera. Mykelti and Tony have both lost weight and were praised by their followers for their dramatic transformation. However, one Instagram user named @toniann6268 posted a menacing comment that caught Janelle’s eye before it was deleted. “Oh no no no! Don’t you dare come on social media and bash one of my kids this way,” Janelle wrote in her reply.

 Mykelti’s Sister Wives Journey Explained 
          

Janelle said she was “sick” of seeing people like the original commentator going out of their way to bully Mykelti. “Go ahead and sit back down,” Janelle warned the person. Janelle is best friends with Christine, who considers her to be her sister-wife for life. They consider each other’s kids their own. Janelle even went to visit her grandchildren, Archer and Ace Padron, when Mykelti welcomed her twin sons, Archer Banks Padron and Ace McCord Padron, in November 2022.


 

Mykelti was just 14 years old when she began her Sister Wives journey in 2009. She is Kody’s fifth-oldest child. Kody’s behavior towards Mykelti has been cold since she announced she was marrying Tony. She chose not to embark on a polygamous journey like her parents. There was friction between Kody and Tony when they interacted. Mykelti was just 20 years old when she got married to Tony. It made Kody feel that Tony was immature, and the young couple weren’t ready to face the real world yet. Mykelti and Tony tied the knot in 2016 and have been supporting characters on Sister Wives ever since.




Mykelti and Tony made headlines for their dramatic weight-loss transformations in 2023. Tony lost about 100 pounds in 10 months. Despite their success as a couple, Mykelti has been receiving negative comments from Sister Wives fans since she decided Meri was never going to be a part of her and her family’s lives. Mykelti has also received flak for being close to Kody’s fourth and only remaining wife, Robyn Brown. However, Christine and Janelle continue to support Mykelti and, as demonstrated by Janelle, can also fight trolls to protect their daughter.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC
