As the anticipation for the Eragon TV series ramps up, it&#39;s easy to remember the important moments from the books that the series shouldn&#39;t skip. 




This list contains spoilers for all of Christopher Paolini&#39;s Inheritance Cycle books.Now that Disney&#43; is adapting the best-selling Eragon series by Christopher Paolini, it has some big shoes to fill in capturing the epic moments from the series, and not making the same mistakes that the film iteration did. The series is highly anticipated, and faces similar challenges to the recent Disney&#43; adaptation of Percy Jackson.

As he grows and comes to accept his destiny, the responsibility that Eragon takes on is great, and he goes through many trials to become ready for the great battle at the close of the series.

 10 Biggest Challenges Disney&#39;s Eragon Show Faces Bringing The Inheritance Cycle To Life 
Disney&#39;s new Eragon TV show faces challenges in adapting complex characters, relationships, and world-building from The Inheritance Cycle novels.













 








 10  The Forging Of Brisingr 
Book 3: Brisingr


 







In the third book of The Inheritance Cycle the title, Brisingr, comes from the name of Eragon&#39;s sword. Though Brisingr is known to be a magical word of power in the series, it is also the name that Eragon gives to his sword. When he journeys to find Rhunön, the elven blacksmith, she takes control of Eragon and forges the legendary sword by using his body. It&#39;s a magical and sacred moment in the books, and one that changes the trajectory of Eragon&#39;s path, as well as increases his power. Though no easy task, it&#39;s well worth it because of the epic nature of the weapon.





 9  Eragon Training With Oromis 
Book 2: Eldest
        

Though Eragon learns a good deal about dragon riding and combat from Brom in the first book, he still has a lot to learn. The elf, Oromis, was Brom&#39;s teacher as well, and takes Eragon on as a student when he travels to Du Weldenvarden. It&#39;s here that much is learned about the history of dragons, riders, and the elves. Additionally, throughout his training, Eragon realizes his feelings for Arya, even though they are not returned.
Overall, Oromis teaches Eragon a lot about how to grow his strength to defeat Gabaltorix, and Eragon leaves the elves having gained some of their characteristics and resilience. Any good hero&#39;s journey needs a teacher and time dedicated to the improvements the hero makes to themselves after learning they&#39;re the chosen one. The series must show how much Eragon grows, and how he is a different person going into the final two books after this training. 





 8  The Burning Plains 
Book 2: Eldest
        

The fight between Murtagh and Eragon had been brewing since the beginning of Eldest, when Murtagh was captured and brought under Galbatorix&#39;s control. He and his dragon, Thorn, engage Eragon, Saphira, and the Varden on the Burning Plains. This is truly a battle of air between Saphira and Thorn, which makes the visual opportunities for the sequence all the more exciting.
It&#39;s the first time that Murtagh has appeared since being lost, and the emotional weight of the fight weighs heavily, as Murtagh also reveals that he and Eragon are brothers, and tells him that his father is Morzan, an enemy of the Varden. Though this proves not to be true, the thought of it plagues Eragon for a long time. In the end, Eragon and the dwarves win the day, but Murtagh emerges as a powerful enemy, and takes Eragon&#39;s sword, Zar&#39;roc. 





 7  Murtagh And Eragon Defeating Galbatorix 
Book 4: Inheritance
        

As the main antagonist of the series, Galbatorix&#39;s existence hangs over the entirety of Eragon&#39;s life before they finally meet in their decisive battle. It&#39;s a difficult journey for Eragon to gain the power he needs to face Galbatorix in combat but, in the end, he needs Murtagh&#39;s help to do it. After Eragon wounds Murtagh during the fight, Galbatorix&#39;s control over him is broken, and he is able to aid Eragon as he kills Galbatorix. Though the reconciliation that occurs between the brothers after this is touching, it&#39;s the physicality of the fight that will be the most interesting to see played out onscreen.





 6  Saphira Hatching 
Book 1: Eragon


 







There would be no Eragon the rider without his dragon Saphira, though he has no idea what&#39;s in store when the &#34;rock&#34; he finds turns out to be a dragon egg. When he takes home Saphira&#39;s egg unknowingly, he first tries to trade it for food. Luckily, no merchant accepts it, and the egg soon hatches, revealing the dragon inside. This is a great opportunity for the series to fix the mistakes of the movie, as Saphira&#39;s hatching, development, and the special effects used to create her all came under heavy fire after the film&#39;s release. If the show can nail her introduction, it&#39;s certain it will be a success.

 5  Eragon Getting His Fortune Told By Angela 
Book 1: Eragon
        

Angela and her werecat, Solembum, become important players in the Eragon universe, and have a much bigger impact on Eragon&#39;s fate than their first meeting reveals. However, when Eragon stumbles into Angela&#39;s shop, it&#39;s long before he knows who he truly is, and her prediction of his future foreshadows much of what&#39;s to come in the books. The moment they share is one of mysticism and magic, and is a vital moment in the atmospheric world building of the series. Additionally, it portents much of Eragon&#39;s fate early in the narrative.





 4  Eragon Riding Saphira For The First Time 
Book 1: Eragon
        

The bond between a dragon and its rider is the most important bond in the Eragon universe, and the first ride is a rite of passage in and of itself. It takes a long time for Eragon and Saphira to fully trust each other and foster their closeness, and Eragon&#39;s initial experience riding her is not easy. He injures himself on her rough scales, and the flight is in a panic, to escape danger. Despite all this, it&#39;s an exhilarating feeling to imagine how Eragon feels being in the air, and it sets the tone for all other flights and aerial action in the series.





 3  Finding The Eggs And Eldunarí On Vroengard 
Book 4: Inheritance
        

While searching for a means to defeat Galbatorix through the book of souls, Eragon and Saphira discover a hidden cache of unhatched dragon eggs and Eldunarí, the consciousness of dragons who have passed on. Within the vault on the island of Vroengard, Eragon and Saphira are able to bring some of the Elduanrí with them to turn the tide of the war. By channeling the power of these dead dragons, Eragon has enough power to compete with Galbatorix. When reading the books, it&#39;s easy to imagine how beautiful and well-preserved the vault is, and seeing that brought to life would capture the importance of the moment.





 2  Finding Out Brom Is Eragon’s Father 
Book 3: Brisingr


 







Although Brom tragically dies in book 1 of The Inheritance Cycle, it&#39;s not until book 3 that Eragon discovers that he is his father. Brom is one of the characters Disney&#39;s Eragon series can&#39;t afford to fail because of the importance of his relationship with Eragon, and the fact that their bond was not fully fleshed out in the 2006 film. It turns out the Brom had implanted memories inside Saphira for Eragon to find when he was ready for the truth.
Discovering that his first mentor, and the rider who introduced him to the world of dragons, is his father, and not Morzan like he feared, was a great relief to Eragon. It&#39;s sad that Brom and Eragon didn&#39;t spend time together and father and son while he was alive, but Brom explains that it was in Eragon&#39;s best interest as he wanted to keep him safe above all. Seeing this touching scene play out is a moment of much-needed happiness for Eragon.





 1  Arya And Eragon Saying Goodbye 
Book 4: Inheritance
        

Despite the slow-burn relationship in the Eragon series that Eragon and Arya develop, it&#39;s important that the series maintains their parting at the end of the fourth book. Though it took a long time for Arya to discover, and then admit, sharing Eragon&#39;s romantic feelings, it would be a disservice for her to go with Eragon. He has a lot more work to do, creating the next generation of riders and keeping the unhatched dragons safe. Likewise, Arya is the new queen of the elves and has a duty to her people. They wouldn&#39;t be the same heroes if they chose each other instead of their duties.
