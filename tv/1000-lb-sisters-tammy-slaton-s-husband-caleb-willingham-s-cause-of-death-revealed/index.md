## Literature Review
Shocking details have been revealed about the unexpected death of 1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton&#39;s husband of five months, Caleb Willingham.




1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton was still a newlywed when she had to deal with the unexpected death of her husband, Caleb Willingham. Tammy and Caleb first met while at the Windsor Lane Rehabilitation Center in Gibsonburg, Ohio, in 2022. The couple got engaged in October that year and got married in November at the center itself in a small ceremony. The wedding was officiated by a nurse and close friend called Billy. Tammy described her wedding ceremony as magical. However, Tammy allegedly separated from Caleb five months later. They allegedly had a big fight over Caleb’s weight gain.




Tammy and Caleb split up because Caleb wasn’t following his diet in rehab. Caleb had gained 30 pounds. It was Caleb who supposedly wanted a divorce but tried to backtrack later. However, Tammy was in no mood to reconcile and decided to file for divorce. The distance between them because Caleb was still in rehab and Tammy was back home in Kentucky had added to their issues. After all, Tammy and Caleb had only known each other for a few weeks before they married. It was said that Tammy wasn’t interested in a long-distance relationship and didn’t want to care for someone else when she was recovering.
