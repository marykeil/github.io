## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda recalls losing her job because of Gino Palazzolo&#39;s ex while menacingly holding a knife during an argument with him.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda looks scary while brandishing a knife during a fight with Gino Palazzolo about his sugar baby ex. Jasmine, 36, a divorced mother of two, began dating Gino, 53, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gino and Jasmine’s relationship has been toxic. Jasmine didn’t like Gino looking at other women and talking to them while she was happy maintaining a friendship with her ex-boyfriend, Dane, and even taking money from him for her surgery. Jasmine found out Gino was in contact with a former sugar baby during Before the 90 Days season 5. The woman DM&#39;d Jasmine to tell her that Gino had sent her Jasmine’s private pictures.




Jasmine is still arguing with Gino about the woman identified as Linzee Ryder during 90 Day Fiancé season 10 as revealed in a preview clip from ET.


 

Jasmine says that the woman sent the topless photos to the school where Jasmine worked as a teacher, which led to Jasmine getting tired. Jasmine said her career was ruined because of the woman and “Gino’s stupid mistake.” Gino asks Jasmine if she did anything to provoke the woman while Jasmine is cutting vegetables in the kitchen. “What did you say?” she asks him and turns the blade of the knife towards the Michigan man threateningly.

 Gino&#39;s Attempt To Calm Jasmine Down Fails 
          

&#34;Did you say anything to provoke the fight, or was she just attacking you out of the blue?&#34; Gino asks Jasmine again. A visibly upset Jasmine tells Gino that Linzee was making fun of her and insulting her “physical appearance.” Jasmine claims that she was making “ugly comments” about her breasts after looking at the photos that Gino had forwarded. Jasmine screams, “And you are really asking me if I provoke her.” As Gino asks her to calm down, she yells, “What the f*** is wrong with you?” Jasmine reminds Gino of all the trauma that she went through when she found out what Gino had done.

Gino says that Jasmine is “way out of control” as she calls him “f***ing stupid.” She yells that she went through “emotional humiliation” when the world came to know what Gino had done. Jasmine says that Linzee had sent her private pictures to every blogger she knew. “And all these f***ing people were looking at myself naked and you’re asking if I provoke her,” adds Jasmine through angry tears running down her face. Gino looks on miserably at Jasmine as the clip ends.




Gino asked for forgiveness from Jasmine after the matter was brought to light on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. While Jasmine agreed to move on, she could never really forgive him because she said she lost her job and identity when the photos reached her place of employment. The woman kept insisting that she never got Jasmine fired. Jasmine didn’t have a job and relied on Gino for money. It appears Gino’s sugar baby has reentered their 90 Day Fiancé season 10 storyline and will make matters worse for the couple as they race to their wedding day.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
