Summary

  Playing as a faithful in The Traitors US is harder than expected according to Big Brother alum Janelle Pierzina, as you become an easy target for the traitors.   Janelle initially wanted to play as a traitor but had to switch her strategy when she wasn&#39;t named a traitor by the host.   Despite being a target, Janelle&#39;s status as a Big Brother legend has allowed her to navigate the game strategically and stay alive.  







The Traitors US season 2&#39;s cast has been open about whether they wanted to go into the game as traitors or as faithful, but one player shared that their experience as faithful was harder than they anticipated. With The Traitors US season 2 releasing its first three episodes, viewers have been able to discover the identities of the traitors and the faithful along with who the first cast members eliminated from the game were. After finding out that Big Brother&#39;s Dan Gheesling and Married To Medicine&#39;s Phaedra Parks were the initial traitors, the duo were able to recruit Survivor legend Parvati Shallow to play along with them against the faithful.

During an interview with Screen Rant, Big Brother&#39;s Janelle Pierzina shared that her role as a faithful was incredibly difficult, especially after wanting to come into the game as a traitor. &#34;It’s hard to play a faithful game, I think, because it’s just like you’re lined up and they can just take shots,&#34; Janelle explained. &#34;It’s, like, really stressful...I wish I could have played a traitor game.&#34; Janelle&#39;s experience in strategy games would lend well toward being a traitor, as she&#39;s been able to manipulate her way through the game of Big Brother more than once, though she hasn&#39;t won.

 Janelle’s Traitors US Gameplay Strategy Explained 
While Janelle may have hoped to be a traitor, she still had a strategy for playing The Traitors US faithfully before walking into the Scottish castle. &#34;My strategy was to identify a traitor and work with a traitor,&#34; Janelle explained, &#34;but also have a nice alliance of faithfuls to protect me, too.&#34; Janelle shared that her strategy was going perfectly to plan when she saw Dan in the game, though she didn&#39;t know quite how perfectly with his identity as a traitor hidden from the rest of the cast. &#34;When I saw [Dan], I was like, it would be the perfect scenario,&#34; the Big Brother alum shared.


 




Though Janelle was looking to play the game from a different angle, she was able to pivot when The Traitors US host Alan Cumming didn&#39;t name her a traitor. Playing the game as faithful, ultimately, may have been more difficult for Janelle in the long run. Though she was able to keep herself safe with her competitive status, going for shields whenever possible to keep herself safe from the traitors&#39; wrath, the fact that she was playing the game for herself made people question her motives. Thankfully, being a little suspicious is a benefit when it comes to staying alive on The Traitors US.

While Janelle may not have been happy with her role initially, the faithful game she&#39;s been able to play in the first episodes of The Traitors US season 2 has been an exciting one. Janelle&#39;s status as a Big Brother legend made her an immediate target in the game, but having a target on your back isn&#39;t always a bad thing on The Traitors, as keeping players in the game who could be threatening to other faithful is a tactic for the traitors to squeak by unscathed. With Janelle getting the opportunity to play The Traitors US in a new and exciting way, testing her abilities in a brand-new environment.
