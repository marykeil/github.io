## Literature Review
After unveiling the 22 contestants of The Traitors UK season 2, it&#39;s been revealed that some cast members might not be as new to TV as they seem.




While most of The Traitors UK season 2 contestants are newbies on TV, some appear to have had prior experience of being on a game show. Once the show premiered, fans quickly got hooked on watching as the contestants tried to identify who was a faithful or a traitor among them. The Traitors UK season 1 was watched over 34 million times on BBC iPlayer. As expected on the back of the first season&#39;s achievements, The Traitors UK season 2 returned on January 3.




For the new season, producers signed up 22 fresh contestants for The Traitors UK season 2. But while most of The Traitors UK season 2 cast are new to the screens, some contestants have prior experience of what it takes to be on a game show. Meanwhile, there are some contestants whose relationship with famous TV figures might have given them insight into what might be required to win.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Paul Gorton 
(Contestant on Deal Or No Deal)
         

Before joining the cast of The Traitors UK season 2 to compete for the £120,000 grand prize, 36-year-old Paul Gorton had once contested in a similar game show more than a decade ago. In 2010, Paul, 22 years old, appeared on Noel Edmonds&#39; Deal Or No Deal, competing to win a potential cash prize of £250,000. At the time, Paul was unemployed and was living at his mother&#39;s Warrington house with his girlfriend. Paul wanted to change his life by winning the show and hoped it would help him launch a modeling career.




Sadly, Paul did not win Deal Or No Deal, leaving the show with a tiny fraction of the grand prize. Nonetheless, Paul looks back fondly on his time on the game show and how the show&#39;s iconic host, Noel, impressed him. Still, Paul, who shares a one-year-old son, Charlie, with model girlfriend Kate Waldron, will hope to use his previous experience to land the ultimate prize this time.



 Kyra Johnson 
(Contestant on Deal Or No Deal)
        The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast   

Kyra Johnson, a 21-year-old Apprentice Economist, is one of the 22 new contestants of The Traitors UK season 2. Still, just weeks before making her The Traitors UK debut, Kyra was a contestant on the game show Deal Or No Deal, competing to win the grand prize of £100,000. Kyra would eventually exit the show with just £1,700 after she accepted the banker&#39;s offer. Nonetheless, Kyra, who has been playing a risky game on The Traitors UK, has quickly become one of the early notable contestants in season 2, and she will be hoping to finish the show stronger than her Deal Or No Deal stint.






 Diane Carson 
(Mother of Game of Thrones Actor)
        The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast   

Retired teacher Diane Carson made an instant impact during The Traitors UK season 2 premiere episode when she used her detective skills to try and root out traitors as soon as the show started. Diane had noticed as host Claudia gently patted the fellow content Harry on the back, arousing her suspicion of his role. Diane&#39;s close observation of Harry throughout the episode made her an instant fan-favorite and led to many social media posts by fans. The trending posts about Diane soon caught the attention of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; star Kerr Logan, who shocked fans by revealing Diane is his mother.

Kerr, who played Mathos Seaworth in &#34;Game of Thrones,&#34; took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to post &#34;My mother is on The Traitors. My mother is on The Traitors. My mother is on The Traitors. She&#39;s bonkers. I&#39;m scared.&#34; Kerr only got to know his mother was appearing in The Traitors UK season 2 when the cast lineup was revealed (via Standard). Meanwhile, Diane, who joined the show to prove her children wrong after they claimed she couldn&#39;t do a show like The Traitors UK, will hope her detective skills and sense of humor take her to the finale.






 Harry Clarke 
(Girlfriend is Anna Maynard)

 

Harry Clarke made his reality TV debut as one of the youngest contestants on The Traitors UK season 2. However, off the show, the British Army Engineer is dating Anna Maynard, the famous host of the CBBC series Got What It Takes. Henry and Anna started their relationship in 2023, and the couple often share cozy pictures of themselves on social media. Speaking about his decision to sign up for the show, Henry noted, &#34;I just thought it was a great opportunity. It&#39;s a life-changing experience, and not many people get to say that they&#39;ve been on TV!&#34; (via Mirror).

While Henry might be new to being on TV, he&#39;s dating a girl from a family of seasoned celebrity stars. Ana is the sister of pop star Conor Maynard and former I&#39;m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Here! star and YouTuber Jack Maynard. While Henry hopes his adaptability and willingness to learn will aid him in his quest to win The Traitors UK season 2, hopefully, he also picked the brains of Ana and her brothers on what it takes to be on TV.
