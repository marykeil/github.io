## Literature Review
One surprising Star Wars adaptation has finally settled a four-year-long The Mandalorian rivalry, and it did so in both a beautiful and humorous way.




Star Wars has finally settled one The Mandalorian rivalry that&#39;s been 4 years in the making. At the heart of The Mandalorian, along with his beloved adopted son and Mandalorian apprentice Grogu, is the battle-hardened Mandalorian Din Djarin - though he has continuously proven his true heart over the course of the Star Wars TV show. Despite his strength and his haunted past, Din uses his skill for what he knows is right, and that has caused him to earn many allies. He has, however, also earned himself plenty of rivals.




This is particularly true of Din in The Mandalorian season 1, before he has much of a chance to develop alongside his little green companion. One of his most famous rivalries is with droids, as Separatist battle droids were responsible for destroying his homeworld of Aq Vetina before the Mandalorians took him in. Still, he does come to trust certain droids throughout The Mandalorian - and as it turns out, droids aren&#39;t the only rival Din has since made amends with.

                  The Mandalorian Season 4 Updates: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know   After The Mandalorian season 3’s conclusion in 2023, the story of The Mandalorian season 4 is shaping up to be one of the show’s biggest yet.    


 Din Djarin Didn&#39;t Get Along With Jawas 
          

It&#39;s no secret that Din Djarin didn&#39;t like Jawas in The Mandalorian season 1. This is demonstrated on Arvala-7 when Din and Kuiil go out to meet the Jawas to retrieve the parts of Din&#39;s ship, the Razor Crest, that the Jawas stole. Given that Din attacked and killed some of the Jawas who were pulling apart his ship earlier, the Jawas begin speaking angrily the moment they catch sight of them. Din only worsens the blow when he tries to incinerate them with his flamethrower for making fun of his Jawaese. Considering the Jawas also nearly got Din killed by the mudhorn, Din&#39;s distaste for Jawas only grew more from that moment on.






 Din Djarin Now Respects The Jawas 
          

In The Book of Boba Fett Junior Novel, Joe Schreiber writes this:


Mando regarded the Jawas with newfound respect. “Gutsy little fellas.” [...] “Well, thanks,” Mando said, tossing a sack of credits to the Jawas.


This is a marked change from his previous attitude. While he clearly isn&#39;t friends with the Jawas by any means, the fact he respects them shows character growth. At the beginning of The Mandalorian, Din Djarin was a loner. Outside of meeting with his covert on occasion, he didn&#39;t seem to have any real friends, as he tended to be very closed off. However, this passage shows him beginning to open up, as he&#39;s starting to find more respect for other people. This is a step toward building stronger connections - a step that his relationship with Grogu made possible.




This is also significant because it shows the Jawas being treated like people. In other Star Wars media, Jawas have been portrayed as little more than pests. They are not seen as having a complex society, and they certainly aren&#39;t seen as individuals. The fact that a Star Wars main character actually states that he respects them is a step toward acknowledging they are people. Perhaps this will lead to the Jawas playing a bigger role in other Star Wars movies and TV shows beyond just being thieves or comic relief.

                  All 24 Episodes Of The Mandalorian, Ranked From Worst To Best   As Star Wars&#39; first live-action TV show, The Mandalorian is both historic and beloved. Here are all 24 of its episodes, ranked from worst to best.    



 The Mandalorian Season 3 Proves This 
         




The Mandalorian season 3 continues with this theme. In season 3, Din actually starts going to the Jawas for things. For example, he gets the Mandalorian glass artifact from them, and he trusts them to find the part to fix IG-11. They may still not exactly like each other, but there&#39;s enough respect to do business. Before, the relationship was so bad that the idea of him going to the Jawas for anything would&#39;ve been unthinkable.



Mando regarded the Jawas with newfound respect. “Gutsy little fellas.”




This development is a nice little carryover from The Book of Boba Fett Junior Novel. It&#39;s small details like this that keep continuity and make different Star Wars movies, TV shows, books, comics, and even video games feel like parts of a bigger whole. It keeps the story consistent, which is very important in a franchise with a meta-narrative. Hopefully, The Mandalorian will continue to take other installments of the Star Wars franchise into account as it moves forward.






The Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney&#43;.




             The Mandalorian The Mandalorian is set after the Empire&#39;s fall and before the First Order&#39;s emergence in the ever-growing Star Wars universe. The series follows the travails of a lone gunfighter named Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic.
