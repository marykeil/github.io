  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Even with the plethora of anime studios around, there are some studios that stand out as the best around.
Some anime studios are great for the large quantity of anime they&rsquo;ve produced and the consistent quality maintained throughout.
Other anime studios are great because of the incredible work they put into their adaptations and original works.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>With the rising popularity of anime, more fans have been looking into the studios behind their favorite shows, wondering which ones are the best.</p>
<p>With the rising popularity of anime in recent years, the question of what animation studios are the best has loomed large in some fans&rsquo; minds. It has been common for fans to decide what to watch each new season by following certain studios whose works they have enjoyed previously. While this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a surefire indicator of quality, as oftentimes different teams of animators and directors work in the same company, certain studios have shown themselves to be a cut above the rest in terms of the anime they produce.
If someone were to truly evaluate the overall quality of an anime studio, then there are a lot of different factors to consider. The frequency at which a studio releases new anime is one important factor, but when it truly comes down to it, the quality of the anime, both in terms of story and visuals, is what truly makes for a good anime studio.</p>
<p>Any anime studio that can keep to that idea is worth praising, or at least the people who work there are, and there are some studios that embody this far more than others.</p>
<p>10 A-1 Pictures Proves That You Can Have Quantity &amp; Quality
Notable works include Fairy Tail, Sword Art Online, &amp; Solo Leveling</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no understatement to say that A-1 Pictures is one of the most recognizable studios in anime history. A-1 Pictures was established in 2005 by Aniplex and former Studio Sunrise producer Mikihiro Iwata. Their first official series was the children&rsquo;s anime Zenmai Zamurai in 2006, and they have been incredibly prolific ever since, with at least one anime produced by them or their subsidiaries every year.
While &ldquo;quality over quantity&rdquo; is a very common expression, that rarely seems to apply to A-1 Pictures. Between hit shows like Fairy Tail, Kaguya-sama: Love is War, and the recent Solo Leveling, A-1 Pictures is great at producing works with incredible stories and even better direction to match. That being said, they have also produced a fair share of content that has been met with infamously negative reception, and while their good work outweighs their bad, it&rsquo;s enough to prevent them from ranking higher among their competitors.</p>
<p>9 Production I.G Hasn&rsquo;t Lost Their Touch After Almost 40 Years
Notable works include Haikyu!!, Ghost in the Shell, &amp; Psycho-Pass</p>
<p>Production I.G is is one of the older anime studios around, with the studio having been around since 1987. The studio started off as a branch of the legendary anime studio Tatsunoko Production, and up until 1994 and the release of Combustible Campus Guardress, they produced all of their anime under the name &ldquo;I.G Tatsunoko&rdquo;.
Despite their notable age, Production I.G hasn&rsquo;t lost a step in the slightest. Older works like Ghost in the Shell and Cromartie High School hold up plenty well after so many years, and as newer shows like Haikyu!! and the upcoming Kaiju No. 8 and Kinnikuman show, Production I.G is still one of the best studios in terms of visuals and overall direction. Granted, Production I.G has had their fair share of flops like Fena: Pirate Princess and Noblesse, but more often than not, they can be counted to deliver on all fronts.</p>
<p>8 David Production Excels At Stylish Action
Notable works include JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure, Fire Force, &amp; Undead Unluck</p>
<p>For anyone looking for a studio with stylish action, one of the best around is undoubtedly David Production. David Production was founded in 2007 by former Gonzo producers Kōji Kajita and Taito Okiura and worked as a subcontractor before their first solo production in 2009, Ristorante Paradiso. The studio would languish in relative obscurity until 2012 when they adapted the hit manga series JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure, and the success of the series helped make David Production one of the biggest names in anime of the past decade.
David Production might not have a lot of work under their belt, but they&rsquo;re still one of the best anime studios around. JoJo&rsquo;s Bizarre Adventure is one thing, but the stylish action of anime like Fire Force, Urusei Yatsura, and the recent Undead Unluck adaptation all show that David Production has some of the best animation and overall direction of any anime studio around. They&rsquo;re hardly the most prolific of studios, but David Production has made a name for themselves, nonetheless, and that&rsquo;s bound to stay true for years to come.</p>
<p>7 Wit Studio Started On As Great A Foot As Possible
Notable works include Attack on Titan, The Ancient Magus&rsquo; Bride, &amp; Spy x Family</p>
<p>Regarding relatively newer anime studios, one of the best ones around is, without a doubt, Wit Studio. Wit Studio was founded in 2012 as a subsidiary of IG Port, the parent company of acclaimed anime studio Production I.G. Their first major production was Attack on Titan, and as most people will attest to, the incredible direction and animation of the anime made Attack on Titan and Wit Studio one of the biggest names in anime for the past 10 years.
Wit Studio has a reputation for being one of the best anime studios around, and that reputation is more than deserved. The immense quality of their work on Attack on Titan is one thing, but with shows like Vinland Saga, Ranking of Kings, and Spy x Family, Wit Studio has continually proven themselves to be masters at employing gorgeous animation and overall stylish direction in every anime they produce. There are very few anime studios to have made a name for themselves at quickly and efficiently as Wit Studio, and there&rsquo;s no sign of that being dampened anytime soon.</p>
<p>6 Studio MAPPA Is Home To Some Of Anime&rsquo;s Biggest Talent
Notable works include Jujutsu Kaisen, Chainsaw Man, &amp; Zombie Land Saga</p>
<p>Another relatively newer anime studio that&rsquo;s plenty deserving of praise is Studio MAPPA. Studio MAPPA was founded in 2011 by Masao Maruyama, one of the co-founders of the anime studio Madhouse. MAPPA made its debut in 2012 with Kids on the Slope from acclaimed director Shinichiro Watanabe, and since then, nearly every anime they have produced has been a major hit in one way or another.
MAPPA is also famous for taking on the later seasons of such anime hits as Attack on Titan and Vinland Saga.</p>
<p>Studio MAPPA is easily one of the biggest anime studios of the past decade, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why. Whether it&rsquo;s original anime like Zombie Land Saga or Yuri!! on Ice or adaptations like Jujutsu Kaisen and Chainsaw Man, every Studio MAPPA anime features incredibly stylish animation and impeccable direction from start to finish, and each show is often among the best anime of its year. Animators like Sunghoo Park, Shōta Goshozono, and Yuichiro Hayashi are among the best talents in anime, and it&rsquo;s thanks to them and others that Studio MAPPA has become as good as it is.</p>
<p>5 Madhouse Is Still A Powerhouse After More Than Half a Century
Notable works include Hunter x Hunter, Beyblade, &amp; Perfect Blue</p>
<p>With Studio MAPPA having been founded by the co-founder of Madhouse, it stands to reason that Madhouse is a great anime studio, as well. Madhouse was founded in 1972 by Masao Maruyama, Osamu Dezaki, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri and made their debut with their adaptation of the manga Aim for the Ace! in 1973. With Madhouse approaching its 52nd anniversary, they rank as one of the oldest anime studios to still be actively producing anime, and they&rsquo;ve managed to consistently put something out almost every year.
Madhouse, owing to its age, has an incredibly large assortment of anime under their banner, and the vast majority of their works deserve plenty of praise. Older works like Perfect Blue and Cardcaptor Sakura have withstood the test of time with their stellar writing and direction, and newer works like Hunter x Hunter and Frieren: Beyond Journey&rsquo;s End have revolutionized the medium with their incredible stories and visual spectacle. Nearly every Madhouse anime has done a great job of showing just how far anime can go as a medium, and even after over 50 years, that&rsquo;s not stopping, anytime soon.</p>
<p>4 Kyoto Animation Never Fails To Make A Gorgeous Product
Notable works include The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, K-On!, and Violet Evergarden</p>
<p>For an anime studio that&rsquo;s famous for anime that doesn&rsquo;t revolve around action, one of the best to discuss is Kyoto Animation. Kyoto Animation was founded in 1985 by the husband and wife team of Hideaki and Yoko Hatta, and they still serve as president and vice-president almost 40 years later. While initially only doing contract work and co-productions, Kyoto Animation finally released their first full series in 2003: Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, a spinoff of Full Metal Panic!, originally produced by Studio Gonzo the year before.
Kyoto Animation has made a name for itself with anime that prioritize character work over action, and that&rsquo;s worked wonder for them. Anime like K-On!, Nichijou, and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya have all excelled at comedy and stellar character writing, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, shows like Kanon, Clannad, and Violet Evergarden have been beautifully heartwrenching dramas that always balance heart with tragedy. Add in how nearly every project of theirs has consistently gorgeous art, animation, and even with their inconsistent output, Kyoto Animation is easily one of the best anime studios around.</p>
<p>3 Studio Bones Still Excels At Action 25 Years Later
Notable works include Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Soul Eater, &amp; My Hero Academia</p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum from Kyoto Animation, an anime studio famous for its use of action is Studio Bones. Studio Bones was founded in 1998 by former Sunrise employees Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Ōsaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto, and coincidentally, one of their first projects was collaborating with Sunrise on the Cowboy Bebop film, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin&rsquo; on Heaven&rsquo;s Door. They would produce their first solo work, Hiwou War Chronicles, in 2000, and they&rsquo;ve been a consistent presence in anime in all the decades that have passed since then.
25 years since their founding, Studio Bones has more than proven itself to be one of the most versatile anime studios around. Between older hits like Wolf&rsquo;s Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and newer works like My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100, Studio Bones has consistently delivered anime with a balance of incredible action and standout writing, and their works always have an undeniable level of charm to them. There are few anime studios that have left as big a mark as Studio Bones, and even after 25 years, that&rsquo;s unlikely to change.</p>
<p>2 Ufotable Is The Undisputed King Of Visual Spectacle
Notable works include Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, &amp; The Garden of Sinners</p>
<p>When it comes to notable anime studios of the past several years, few studios come to mind as easily as Ufotable. Ufotable was founded in 2000 by former Telecom Animation Film producer Hikaru Kondo, who still serves as president over 20 years later. Their first production was 2002&rsquo;s Weiß Kreuz Glühen, the third installment in the Weiß Kreuz franchise and has notably better animation than its predecessors.
Anime is a medium that thrives on its visual aesthetic, and very few anime studios show that off as well as Ufotable. Whether it&rsquo;s movies like The Garden of Sinners or shows like Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works and Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Ufotable productions always have some of the greatest visuals and animation of any anime, and the often stellar music and direction accompanying them enhances that even further. In terms of pure visuals, Ufotable is possibly the best anime studio around, and that idea only becomes stronger with every new work they release.</p>
<p>1 Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s Incredible Legacy As A Studio Can&rsquo;t Be Denied
Notable works include Spirited Away, When Marnie Was There, &amp; The Boy and the Heron</p>
<p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by the now-acclaimed team of Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki, and, of course, legendary director Hayao Miyazaki. Unlike other anime studios, Studio Ghibli primarily focuses on feature films instead of TV shows, and the first film officially produced under their label was 1986&rsquo;s Castle in the Sky, the film loosely inspired by a chapter from Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels.</p>
<p>Every Hayao Miyazaki Movie Ranked, Including The Boy And The Heron<br>
Hayao Miyazaki is one of the biggest names in animation, and here&rsquo;s how all of his movies, including The Boy and the Heron, compare to each other.</p>
<p>Studio Ghibli films are often regarded as some of the best films in not just anime, but animation, in general, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why that is. For almost 40 years, Studio Ghibli films have featured some of the most detailed and fluid art and animation of any animated film, and whether it&rsquo;s a whimsical fantasy story or something more down-to-earth, their films are always visual spectacles with touching and engaging stories to accompany them. Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s impact on animation is impossible to deny, and it&rsquo;s why they easily stand out as one of the best anime studios.</p>
