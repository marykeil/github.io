  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Following its two-episode premiere on Hulu, Death and Other Details episode 3 ramped things up with more reveals and a cliffhanger ending.</p>
<p>Summary
Agent Hilde Eriksen takes over the murder case, causing tension with Rufus.
The show focuses on the complex relationships among the characters, adding to the mystery.
Important clues are uncovered, including a missing journal and suspicious behavior from various characters.</p>
<p>Death and Other Details episode 3 introduced Agent Hilde Erikse, who made some headway in the murder case, while Rufus and Imogene worked on their own investigation behind her back. Death and Other Details episodes 1 and 2 provided enough exposition to familiarize viewers with the characters, the murder of Keith/Danny, and the show’s format. This setup allowed Death and Other Details episode 3 to advance the plot through further reveals that will hopefully bring Rufus and Imogene another step closer to discovering the murderer.
Multiple members of the Death and Other Details cast were featured in episode 3, with the screentime shared among the talented ensemble to highlight the fact that everyone is a suspect. Even though important discoveries were made, they only made certain people seem more suspicious rather than eliminating potential perpetrators. The Knives Out-esque show is just as focused on the interpersonal relationships between everyone on the cruise as it is on solving the murder, making for an interesting web of connections that are just waiting to be unraveled.</p>
<p>11  Rufus Is Just Consulting On The Case
Hilde is in charge now</p>
<p>With accredited Interpol agent Hilde Eriksen boarding the ship at the end of Death and Other Details episode 2, the murder case has a new lead investigator. Fortunately, Rufus was kept on to assist Hilde rather than being removed entirely. Unfortunately, Hilde and Rufus have very different investigative styles and butt heads often in Death and Other Details episode 3.
This also meant that Imogene’s involvement in the case had to be carefully hidden. Rufus may always work with an assistant, but now that he is an assistant, he shouldn’t have nor need one. Additionally, while Hilde was brought on to solve the case of the murder of Keith/Danny, Imogene and Rufus have a larger agenda with the Colliers to try and finally discover the truth behind her mother’s death.</p>

<p>10  Anna Is Struggling To Keep The Deal Alive</p>
<p>While Hilde, Rufus, and Imogene were focused on their murder investigation, Anna spent Death and Other Details struggling to keep the deal between her family and the Chuns alive. It was revealed that Anna was the one who initiated the deal, with her romantic history with Eleanor having played a part in it. However, the Chuns haven’t been the easiest people to deal with, and it’s up to Anna as future CEO to save the company from bankruptcy.
Anna’s family is of little to no help to her, which causes her a great deal of stress. After failing to publicly name her as his successor during dinner in Death and Other Details episode 1, Lawrence suddenly left her with all the pressure and responsibility of making the deal with the Chuns happen. Eleanor and Anna are set to discuss the deal alone, which could spell trouble for her marriage with Leila given their past.</p>
<p>9  Teddy Is Willing To Lie For Her Crew
She views them as family</p>
<p>After investigating the passengers in the first two episodes of Death and Other Details, Hilde turned things around to look into the crew. The staff is managed by Teddy, who literally runs a tight ship and isn’t willing to accept anything but perfection. Though she may seem tough on the surface, Teddy claims that her employees are like family to her, to the point where she is willing to lie to protect them. However, her only real family member on the ship, Winnie, calls Teddy out for pretending to truly care about them.</p>
<p>8  Danny’s Journal Is Missing</p>
<p>When Hilde and Rufus visit the crime scene, Rufus notes that his friend’s journal is missing. Danny had carried the notebook with him everywhere, taking notes on what he’d observed about those around him. People often underestimated him, which he used to his advantage, and whoever may have found and stolen his notebook might also be the person who murdered him. The notebook would have revealed that Danny wasn’t actually Keith, as well as his true motivation for being on the cruise.</p>
<p>7  Hilde Is Focused On The Watch &amp; Footage
Imogene &amp; Rufus have to catch the killer first</p>
<p>Rufus and Imogene have a vested interest in finding out the truth about the Collier family’s many secrets, but Hilde views the murder investigation as straightforward. When she discovered Danny’s broken watch in his hotel room, she assumed that whoever broke it must also be the murderer. Combined with the fact that the security footage during that time was erased, she also assumed that the killer erased it.
Of course, viewers know the true story behind the watch and the security footage and how suspicious it would make Imogene and Rufus appear. Neither Rufus nor Imogene is guilty of murdering Danny, but that doesn’t mean that they haven’t committed other crimes, with Imogene having stolen from him and Rufus having erased the security footage. If Hilde finds out what they did, she could easily pin his murder on them, so they have to catch the real killer before she figures out the truth.</p>
<p>6  Alexandra Was Told To Send The Bar Cart To Keith’s Room
The request was made by an anonymous donor</p>
<p>One of the biggest reveals in Death and Other Details episode 2 was that Alexandra was the one who sent the bar cart to Keith’s room. It had been discovered that his killer had hidden in the bar cart to get in and out of the room undetected, immediately connecting her to the murder. This reveal went hand in hand with the discovery that Alexandra and Tripp had been having an affair, though she promptly ended it in fear that they’d be found out.
In Death and Other Details episode 3, Alexandra confided in Father Toby that it had been her that sent the bar cart. However, she believes she’s being set up as she was told to make the call by a donor in her super PAC. Because the request was anonymous, she doesn’t know who made it, but Father Toby, who organized the super PAC, may know who did. Whoever asked Alexandra to send the bar cart to Danny’s room either killed him or orchestrated his murder.</p>
<p>5  Llewellyn Is Missing
Anna spent the episode trying to get ahold of the lawyer</p>
<p>While Anna was trying to prepare for a meeting with the Chuns, she had a difficult time getting ahold of her family. She eventually found her parents and brother, but she never found the family lawyer, Llewellyn. Despite calling him multiple times throughout Death and Other Details episode 3, he never answered, nor did he make an appearance by the end of the episode. The matter of where Llewellyn is or where he was will hopefully be addressed in Death and Other Details episode 4.</p>
<p>4  Imogene &amp; Rufus Looked Through The Colliers’ Books
They still can’t prove anything</p>
<p>Imogene and Rufus had believed that the Colliers’ books would be the key to solving not just Danny’s murder, but the death of Imogene’s mother as well. Unfortunately, if they had been hiding any dark secrets, they weren’t able to uncover them through the books. They confirmed that the Colliers were on the brink of bankruptcy, but that was nothing new to them.
The only potential clue they found was a receipt for a material found in clothing that was banned in the late 1980s. The date wasn’t legible on the old document, so they can’t even prove if their business practices were illegal. Rufus reminded Imogene of the dangers of having an agenda when it comes to solving a case. She wants to find evidence of blackmail with the Colliers, and it’s causing her to miss other important signs around her.

Screen Rant interviews Violett Beane and Lauren Patten about what drew them to Death and Other Details and deciphering the show&rsquo;s murder mystery.</p>
<p>3  Leila Stole A Knife From The Hotel
Imogene followed her</p>
<p>Imogene took Rufus’s advice to heart and almost immediately was able to pick up on suspicious activity from Leila. Anna’s wife said she was going to the pool at the beginning of Death and Other Details episode 3, but no one ever saw her there. Towards the end of the episode, Imogene saw Leila slyly take a knife from an ice bucket in the hotel lobby.
The episode then flashed back to a few months before when Anna confessed that Leila had been sleeping with a knife under her pillow, likely due to the paranoia caused by her “accident.” Imogene followed Leila, but she wasn’t able to get very far. Leila could have taken the knife as a measure of protection, but the weapon combined with her lie in Death and Other Details episode 3 suggests she’s up to no good.</p>
<p>2  Katherine Is Having An Affair With Father Toby</p>
<p>When Anna finally found her mother in Death and Other Details episode 3, she wasn&rsquo;t alone. She walked in on Katherine with Father Toby, uncovering an affair that had presumably been going on for quite some time. Katherine assured her lover that her daughter wouldn’t tell anyone, saying that she knew how to keep a secret.
It’s unlikely that Lawrence knows about his wife’s infidelity, but it wouldn’t be surprising if he was unfaithful as well. Katherine’s affair further complicates the relationships in Death and Other Details as it reveals Father Toby as far more than a family friend. Anna may not tell anyone about her mother’s affair, but she could potentially use the knowledge as leverage against her.</p>
<p>1  Jules Was An Alias
He has a criminal background</p>
<p>The biggest reveal in Death and Other Details episode 3 was also a cliffhanger. Earlier in the episode, Hilde turned her attention to Jules, the ship’s head of security, as he hadn&rsquo;t clocked in for his shift when the murder and erasing of the security footage occurred. When questioned, he claimed he wasn’t feeling well, rather than telling the truth about spending the night with Imogene. Jules only became more suspicious when he disappeared later in the episode.
After searching his room, Hilde and Rufus find out that Jules isn’t his real name at all. In fact, he has a long criminal background. Who Jules is wasn’t revealed because Death and Other Details episode 3 abruptly ended with him finding and grabbing Imogene, potentially putting her in danger.
