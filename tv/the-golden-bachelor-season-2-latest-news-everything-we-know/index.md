## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor season 1 was a huge success, so it&#39;s likely that ABC will bring the show back for another season. Here&#39;s what we know so far.




There&#39;s been a lot of buzz about The Golden Bachelor season 2 after season 1 ended with the engagement of leading man, Gerry Turner, and his final choice, Theresa Nist. The Golden Bachelor season 1 starred Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, looking for the second great love of his life. His wife, Toni, passed away suddenly from a bacterial infection six years ago, after 43 wonderful years together. Gerry had 22 women over the age of 60 from whom to choose, and he picked Theresa, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey.




A recurring theme of The Golden Bachelor was hope. It was very inspiring to see older people, some of whom had suffered through enormous heartache and tragedy in their lives, receiving another chance at love. It was delightful to see the women open their hearts to Gerry, and also form strong friendships with each other. It was also fantastic to watch Gerry&#39;s romance with Theresa unfold, and lead to an engagement. They&#39;ll be married in a live, televised wedding on January, 4, 2024. The Golden Bachelor season 1 was a huge success, but will there be a season 2?

 Is The Golden Bachelor Season 2 Confirmed? 

 

The Golden Bachelor season 2 hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet. In fact, there&#39;s been speculation that there will be the first-ever season of The Golden Bachelorette before The Golden Bachelor season 2 is announced. However, there is evidence that The Golden Bachelor season 2 will happen. During the final two episodes of the show, host Jesse Palmer encouraged viewers to go online and apply to be on the next season of The Golden Bachelor. Bachelor Nation, the official website from the producers of the Bachelor franchise, has applications for people who want to apply or nominate someone else to be on The Golden Bachelor. 






 The Golden Bachelor Season 2&#39;s Potential Release Window 
          

Since The Golden Bachelor is a new show, there&#39;s no set pattern for when it could air. In recent years, The Bachelor has aired in January, followed by The Bachelorette in the spring and summer. The Golden Bachelor season 1 aired alongside Bachelor in Paradise season 9 in the fall, so it&#39;s possible that, if there&#39;s a Golden Bachelorette, that show will come first, maybe in between The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. Perhaps The Golden Bachelor will air again next fall.



 The Golden Bachelor Season 2&#39;s Potential Cast 
          

The Golden Bachelor is currently looking for applicants to be its contestants. However, if it follows the patterns of the other Bachelor franchise shows, its leading man will most likely come from The Golden Bachelorette, if that show airs. The Golden Bachelorette leading lady will most likely be one of the many fantastic women from The Golden Bachelor season 1. It&#39;ll also be interesting and fun to meet the new seniors who&#39;ll compete in these shows.




The Golden Bachelor season 2 hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet, but it seems inevitable since the first season was such a hit. The people had relatable stories that came from their many years of experience. The show had romance, charm, and humor, and was full of inspiration, hope, and love. The Golden Bachelor season 2 should definitely happen sooner than later.
