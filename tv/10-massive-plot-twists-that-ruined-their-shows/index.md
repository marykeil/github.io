## Literature Review
TV show plot twists should impress and shock. However, there are times when unexpected twists can harm the show, ruining seasons of investment.





A well-executed TV show plot twist should shock and impress, highlighting ingenuity and talent to enhance the viewing experience. Unfortunately, there are instances where an excessively large and unexpected plot twist can detrimentally impact a show, nullifying seasons of investment and rendering it no longer worth watching. When done right, twists like The Red Wedding episode in Game of Thrones electrify, driving intrigue and acclaim. However, poor narrative turns can also retroactively damage goodwill, especially if they seem to betray core characters or dynamics. Dedicating years to a show, reckless plot detours can sabotage the emotional journey.
While there are many TV shows with great plot twists, certain shifts come across as cheap provocations that discard internal logic. The line separating jaw-dropping thrill from eye-rolling dismay can be razor thin. Viewers are willing to suspend disbelief given engrossing worlds and characters that add to the story, but massive show-altering twists that violate those principles with drastically unjustified deviations typically inspire backlash. There is an unspoken pact of purpose between storyteller and consumer. When twists trash years of investment without satisfactory explanation just to superficially create buzz, that trust frays for good reason.









 








 10  Michael’s Return From The Dead 
Jane The Virgin
        

 Jane the Virgin 

 Release Date   October 13, 2014    Cast   Gina Rodriguez , Andrea Navedo , Justin Baldoni , Ivonne Coll , Brett Dier , Jaime Camil    Genres   Comedy , Satire    Seasons   5    




The soap-like series Jane the Virgin introduced a major plot twist by shockingly reviving a main character long after his apparent death. While such surprises generate buzz, this far-fetched reversal had a negative impact on the show. Bringing Michael back to life undid the meaningful growth experienced by other characters following his loss. This interference with their evolution disrupted the show&#39;s narrative flow and ran the risk of frustrating invested fans. Additionally, resetting a key character&#39;s personality for the sake of drama seemed desperate, disregarding the established understanding viewers had of the character. While plot twists have their place, betraying characters through unrealistic resurrections sacrifices substance for mere shock value.





 9  Poussey’s Death 
Orange Is The New Black
        

 orange is the new black 

 Release Date   July 11, 2013    Cast   Taylor Schilling , Dascha Polanco , Natasha Lyonne , Samira Wiley , Kate Mulgrew , Danielle Brooks , Michael Harney , Uzo Aduba , Jason Biggs , Laura Prepon    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   7    




The tragic demise of beloved character Poussey Washington in Orange is the New Black was a deeply polarizing twist. While relevant highlighting systemic injustice, graphically killing a fan-favorite suddenly crossed a dramatic line given the show’s tone. Without underlying arcs justifying such brutality, this gut-punch seemed mainly for provocative shock value at loyal audiences’ expense. Poussey’s savage loss violated that trust for many, and unfortunately, the show never recovered from her character’s death. Creatively impactful deaths require earned narrative purpose beyond senseless tragedy. When violently rupturing earlier implicit agreements surrounding character treatment just to stimulate buzz, questions of exploitative betrayal unavoidably followed.





 8  Luke Having A Secret Daughter 
Gilmore Girls
        

 Gilmore Girls 

 Release Date   October 5, 2000    Cast   Lauren Graham , Scott Patterson , Sean Gunn , Keiko Agena , Matt Czuchry , Alexis Bledel , Yanic Truesdale , Kelly Bishop , Melissa McCarthy , Edward Herrmann , Liza Weil , Jared Padalecki , Milo Ventimiglia    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   7    




Gilmore Girls faced backlash when it introduced Luke&#39;s previously undisclosed teenage daughter, prompting fans to question the narrative integrity. This contrived familial revelation strained already delicate connections to the original show&#39;s essence. Given the established image of Luke as a caring paternal figure for years, concealing such an intimate history appeared entirely implausible and betrayed a fundamental understanding of his character. The introduction of this child for the sake of forced drama seemed like a weak attempt at shallow surprises, lacking meaningful ties to the narrative. Instead of deepening engagement, these lazy attempts to reshape dynamics ultimately compromised the show&#39;s integrity.





 7  Deb Falling In Love With Dexter 
Dexter


 







 Dexter 

 Release Date   October 31, 2010    Cast   David Zayas , Michael C. Hall , Lauren Velez , C. S. Lee , James Remar , Jennifer Carpenter , Desmond Harrington , Julie Benz    Genres   Crime , Mystery , Drama    Seasons   8    




When Dexter&#39;s adopted sister, Debra, confessed romantic love for him in Dexter season 7, it elicited a strong cringe. While it plausibly portrayed her psychological unraveling, the inclusion of a quasi-incestuous desire proved unsettling for many. Throughout the show&#39;s run, there was never a hint of such taboo tension, and its sudden introduction felt like a cheap shock tactic without narrative purpose. Given the already strained bonds in the series, this unnecessary plot twist added no insightful commentary or progression, only intensifying viewer discomfort. Provocative detours can be impactful when they convincingly transform characters, but imposing arbitrary trauma between familial personas without reasonable intent shattered trust and tolerance.





 6  Clarke Killing Bellamy 
The 100
        

 The 100 

 Release Date   March 19, 2014    Cast   Devon Bostick , Christopher Larkin , Marie Avgeropoulos , Sachin Sahel , Richard Harmon , Chelsey Reist , Henry Ian Cusick , Bob Morley , Jarod Joseph , Paige Turco , Adina Porter , Ricky Whittle , Eliza Taylor , Isaiah Washington , Lindsey Morgan , Tasya Teles    Genres    Sci-Fi , Mystery , Drama    Seasons   7    




Clarke callously murdering the long-standing moral compass, Bellamy, late into The 100&#39;s final season, sparked outrage over her out-of-character cruelty. Bellamy, symbolizing redemption and virtue, faced a point-blank execution from an unrecognizably cold Clarke, instantly unraveling years of thoughtful character-building. Instead of elevating the stakes, the arbitrary dismantling of this beloved bond, solidified by earned consistency, appeared as a tone-deaf move. Without credible motivation, such a severe violation of implicit pacts of consistency ultimately severed connections crucial for ambitiously resonating fiction. Some character deaths constructively advance themes, while others seem to excuse showrunners taking resonance for granted.

 5  The Plane Crash 
Grey’s Anatomy


 







 Grey&#39;s Anatomy 

 Release Date   March 27, 2005    Cast   Kelly McCreary , Patrick Dempsey , Kevin McKidd , Chandra Wilson , Jesse Williams , Jake Borelli , camilla luddington , Ellen Pompeo , Chyler Leigh , Eric Dane , Caterina Scorsone , Giacomo Gianniotti , Anthony Hill , Kate Walsh , Justin Chambers , Sarah Drew , Greg Germann , Martin Henderson , Katherine Heigl , T.R. Knight , Sara Ramirez , Jerrika Hinton , Richard Flood , Sandra Oh , Kim Raver , Jason George , Tessa Ferrer , Isaiah Washington , James Pickens Jr. , Gaius Charles , Chris Carmack , Brooke Smith , Jessica Capshaw    Genres   Romance , Drama    Seasons   19    




Even though this Grey&#39;s Anatomy moment made fans cry, it also sparked controversy by abruptly introducing a plane crash storyline, resulting in the death of the beloved character Lexie Grey and endangering others. While aiming to shake up dynamics, the show&#39;s attempt to violently manufacture mortal peril through an improbable catastrophe tonally betrayed its grounded hospital setting and the ensemble bonds nurtured over the years. The resulting death and damage felt like cheap trauma, lacking emotional legitimacy that usually anchors successful shocking narrative deviations. Convincingly earning dramatic upheaval requires organic catalysts grounded in continuity; otherwise, intense moments like this one play are more superficially exploitative than inspired.





 4  Mr. Big’s Death 
And Just Like That…


 







 And Just Like That... 

 Release Date   December 9, 2021    Cast   Sarah Jessica Parker , Cynthia Nixon , Kristin Davis , Mario Cantone , David Eigenberg , Willie Garson , Evan Handler , Sara Ramirez , Chris Noth , Sarita Choudhury    Genres   Drama    Seasons   2    




When the Sex and the City follow-up series And Just Like That... abruptly killed off the polarizing yet central character Mr. Big in its premiere, frustration ensued over sidelining an essential ingredient of the show&#39;s emotional core without narrative purpose. Despite Carrie and Big&#39;s relationship timeline being full of drama, their turbulent marriage represented a cornerstone. Blind-siding audiences by severing that strained bond without constructing a resonant aftermath or thoughtfully mining long-term implications wasted a tension fundamental to the show&#39;s DNA. Severely discarding pivotal history and complexity risks rupturing investment and continuity vital to serialized storytelling.





 3  Season 9 Was A Dream 
Dallas
        

 Dallas (1978) 

 Release Date   April 2, 1978    Cast   Larry Hagman , Patrick Duffy    Genres   Drama    Seasons   14    




Mockery plagued the show Dallas after a full dream sequence negated lead Bobby Ewing’s tear-jerking death by revealing him to be alive. This preposterous plot twist strained the suspense of disbelief in its play because of gasps lacking a credible narrative purpose. Without earning such an unbelievable twist, the choice came from prioritizing artificial surprise over resonant storytelling. Twists can captivate via insight, reversing seasons of high-stakes events on a whim signals writers taking audience investment for granted. These large shocks that are absent of authentic character and thematic groundwork ultimately alienate more than intrigue.





 2  Ted Ending Up With Robin 
How I Met Your Mother
        

 How I Met Your Mother 

 Release Date   September 19, 2005    Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   9    




The How I Met Your Mother finale, controversial for having Ted end up with Robin after the mother&#39;s death, elicited frustration due to the perceived waste of time invested in the central premise of meeting the mother. While artistic surprises have their place, this reversal undid years of character development and viewer investment in the promised mother reveal. The sitcom&#39;s departure from its central focus for a last-minute twist betrayed its spirit and dismissed seasons of earned growth. The lack of a sound rationale for disrupting continuity reflected a callous misalignment between creators and audience expectations. Ambition in storytelling is commendable, but brazenly resetting benchmarks for shock value rarely satisfies.





 1  Daenerys Turning Into A &#34;Mad Queen” 
Game of Thrones
        

 Game Of Thrones 

 Release Date   April 11, 2011    Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Genres   Drama , Action , Adventure    Seasons   8    




Game of Thrones sparked confusion by suddenly portraying principled protagonist Daenerys torching civilians en masse, raising questions about the show sacrificing years of careful character development for the sake of shock. Despite engaging in morally gray actions, Daenerys consistently exhibited compassion and restraint, making her sudden pivot narratively unjustified and lacking credibility. Even though challenging expectations has its merits, dismantling earned character dynamics without credible roots appears exploitative. It’s clear the aim was to have short-term dramatic effectiveness, severing organic bonds between text and audience results in lasting damage.
