# What Happened When Ares &amp; Grover Last Met Before Percy Jackson Episode 5


## SUMMARY 



  Grover and Ares met at the last winter solstice, a significant event for the Greek gods.   Ares forgot about their previous meeting, likely due to the chaos that occurred during that winter solstice when the Master Bolt was stolen from Zeus.   The Percy Jackson books didn&#39;t mention satyr protests during that winter solstice, but given the events of that night, it makes sense that Ares would forget the details.

## Literature Review
The last time that Grover and Ares met before Percy Jackson episode 5 was the event that truly kickstarted the need for Percy&#39;s season 1 quest.





Summary

  Grover and Ares met at the last winter solstice, a significant event for the Greek gods.   Ares forgot about their previous meeting, likely due to the chaos that occurred during that winter solstice when the Master Bolt was stolen from Zeus.   The Percy Jackson books didn&#39;t mention satyr protests during that winter solstice, but given the events of that night, it makes sense that Ares would forget the details.  







Grover refers to the last time that he and Ares met before Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5, which appears to have been a crucial day for the show’s central mystery. After the trio battled Echidna and the Chimera in episode 4, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are introduced to the god of war in Percy Jackson season 1, episode 5. Needing to retrieve his shield from a waterpark ride created by the Greek god Hephaestus (Timothy Omundson), Ares (Adam Copeland) tasks the demigods and satyr with the job while promising that he’ll provide them with transportation for their quest. However, to ensure Annabeth and Percy complete the task, Ares forces Grover to stay with him at the diner.

During their discussions about being a Twitter troll, Ares hating his children, and Grover being a fan of the Lobster War, the satyr reveals to the Greek god that the two had met before. While Grover indicates that they met at a solstice, he leaves out many of the details regarding when exactly this meeting occurs, with Ares even forgetting their prior introduction. Though Grover bringing up this meeting marks a change from Percy Jackson’s book, Riordan’s novel series and previous episodes from the Disney&#43; show hint at when the two last met, as well as the dark occurrence that made it so memorable.





 Grover &amp; Ares Seemingly Met At The Last Winter Solstice 
          

By bringing up “the solstice,” it seems Grover is implying at he met Ares at the most recent winter solstice. The book revealed that Luke and some other campers went on a field trip to Olympus for the winter solstice, indicating Grover was one of the figures who tagged along. The winter solstice is one of the biggest meeting between the Greek gods throughout the year and occurs on either December 21 or 22, so approximately six months before Percy Jackson’s quest.

When Grover reveals that he was at the solstice, Percy Jackson’s Greek god of war suggests that the satyr was there protesting. Oddly, the Percy Jackson books didn’t mention protests from satyrs happening at the winter solstice or another event around that time. Given what actually happened on the night of that winter solstice, however, it makes sense that Ares would forget meeting the young satyr and the other details of that event.






 The Winter Solstice Was When The Master Bolt Was Stolen From Zeus 
          

The winter solstice in which Ares and Grover supposedly first met was the same occasion on which the Master Bolt was stolen from Zeus. The Percy Jackson books indicate that after an argument with Poseidon during the last winter solstice, Zeus realized his bolt went missing and quickly blamed the sea god. However, there were plenty of other suspects there that night, such as the demigods on the field trip, other gods like Ares himself, and even Hades, with the winter solstice being the only time the latter is allowed to visit Olympus. With dark magic also having stronger power during the winter solstice, this event incited significant chaos for Percy Jackson and the Olympians’ story.
