## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 9 star Miona Bell is finally addressing her and Jibri Bell&#39;s divorce rumors. The Serbian businesswoman is lashing out at haters.




90 Day Fiancé star Miona Bell is responding to rumors of her divorce from Jibri Bell. Miona, a 25-year-old Serbian native, found fame on 90 Day Fiancé season 9. Miona moved to South Dakota to get married to Jibri, a musician from Los Angeles, who was living with his parents. Despite the backlash from Jibri’s mom and his band, The Black Serbs, Jibri and Miona didn’t give up on their relationship. They left Jibri’s house and began a new life in Palm Springs, California.




Miona and Jibri have celebrated many milestones since they got married in November 2021. They bought luxury cars and took vacations to exotic locations together. However, by the time their second wedding anniversary arrived, Miona and Jibri sparked split rumors. Miona removed all of their photos and videos together. Jibri further fueled speculations by flying to Southeast Asia and shaving his hair in Thailand. While Jibri keeps telling fans that he and Miona are still together, Miona has been posting cryptic videos with a mystery man.

 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Miona &#34;Unbothered&#34; By Split Rumors 
          




Recently, Miona shared an Instagram post that seemingly hinted at her relationship status with Jibri amid split rumors. Miona has only been using Instagram to promote her hair extensions company but used one of the posts to share a caption that may have been a dig at what people were saying about her and Jibri. Miona wrote in her cryptic caption, “Unbothered to say the least.” She used a palm tree emoji to suggest she was enjoying her life in Palm Springs. Miona looked happy in her bikini photo, justifying her caption. A few fans in her comments cheered Miona on for dropping “deadweight” Jibri.

However, Miona’s swimsuit photos are bothering her fans. Most of Miona’s pictures show her wearing two-piece outfits along with her various wigs and hairpieces available on her online store. Miona shared a similar one where she was photographed sitting by a pool with a book in her hand. One of her followers asked Miona, “Where is her husband??? She is always 1/2 naked!!! Why.” Miona usually doesn’t respond to questions about Jibri in her comments. This time around, Miona decided to give the fan a fitting reply. “Because I can and want. No husband or man will tell me what to do with my body EVER,” Miona replied.






 Miona Is Building Her Million-Dollar Business 

 

In July 2022, Miona announced that she was launching her beauty line, which offers her signature ponytails, as seen on 90 Day Fiancé. Miona knew how to capitalize on her fame well and did it by starting her online business with Jibri’s help. Miona’s hair on the show created quite a buzz. Fans took an interest in not only her hair but also her makeup and fashion. By August 2022, Miona claimed she made $20,000 in a week and about $87,000 with Miona Beauty.

Less than a year later, in April 2023, Jibri said Miona was a millionaire. Miona has continued to grow her business. Even without Jibri by her side, Miona has been “doing business meetings” all week long. While Jibri wants to let go of worldly pleasures, Miona is still flaunting her Dior and Balenciaga handbags. 






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
