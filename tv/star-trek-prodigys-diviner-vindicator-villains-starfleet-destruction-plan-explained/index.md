## Literature Review
The Diviner and the Vindicator are the villains of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, but who are the Vau N&#39;Akat, and how will they destroy Starfleet?




In Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, the Diviner (John Noble) and the Vindicator (Jameela Jamil) are villains with complex plans to destroy Starfleet. The Vindicator and the Diviner are Vau N&#39;Akat, a new alien species introduced in Star Trek: Prodigy, and both are also members of The Order, a military organization of the Vau N&#39;Akat homeworld Solum, in the Delta Quadrant. The Order&#39;s sole mission after the Vau N&#39;Akat civil war has been vengeance against the Federation, which it aims to carry out through the actions of its single-minded operatives, said to be the last of their kind.




The Vau N&#39;Akat plan to destroy Starfleet involves time travel to both the past and the future, as well as a fair bit of deception, so it&#39;s not as straightforward as you&#39;d expect, especially for a show aimed at younger viewers. The Diviner&#39;s past takes place in the future, relative to Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s present day of 2384, and the timeline of the USS Protostar&#39;s journey prior to Prodigy&#39;s main events swings between past, present, and future. The Diviner lies by omission frequently, and the Vindicator is hiding behind a secret identity that isn&#39;t revealed until later on in Star Trek: Prodigy season 1.

                  Everything We Know About Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2   Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will stream on Netflix after the animated series was canceled by Paramount&#43;, with 20 brand new episodes coming in 2024.    


 What Happened When Starfleet Made First Contact With Diviner &amp; Vau N’Akat? 
The Vau N&#39;Akat blamed Starfleet for their civil war.
         




Starfleet&#39;s First Contact with the Vau N&#39;Akat sparked a civil war on Solum that decimated the planet. At some point between 2384 and the future that the Diviner came from, a Prometheus-class starship arrived on Solum to make First Contact with the Vau N&#39;Akat. The existence of other sentient species in the galaxy shook the foundation of Vau N&#39;Akat society, dividing the Vau N&#39;Akat into those who welcomed Starfleet&#39;s arrival and those who would denounce Federation ideals, believing Solum owed its prosperity to its traditional values. The Vau N&#39;Akat blamed Starfleet for their decimation.

Fifty years after the Vau N&#39;Akat civil war, Captain Chakotay&#39;s (Robert Beltran) USS Protostar emerged from a temporal anomaly above Solum, and landed there, finding the planet already devastated by war. Chakotay&#39;s mission back to the Delta Quadrant had originated sometime between 2379, when the USS Voyager returned home, and 2383, when Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 took place, so Chakotay was unaware of the Federation&#39;s role in igniting Solum&#39;s war. The Order saw their opportunity to take revenge on Starfleet by using the Protostar, and they took it.






 The Diviner &amp; Vau N&#39;Akat Starfleet Revenge Plan Explained 
The Vau N&#39;Akat insidiously planned for Starfleet to destroy itself.
         

The Vau N&#39;Akat and the Diviner captured the USS Protostar and installed the Living Construct, a weapon designed to hijack Starfleet computer systems and spread a virus throughout Federation starships when they came in contact with each other. The Vau N&#39;Akat erased the Protostar&#39;s logs to conceal their tampering, also erasing information about the Protostar&#39;s initial mission in the process. To protect Starfleet in his own time, Chakotay remotely sent the crewless Protostar back through the anomaly before the Vau N&#39;Akat mission could be completed, stranding himself in the future.



Back in the late 24th century, Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) launched her own mission on the USS Dauntless to find Chakotay and the USS Protostar in the Delta Quadrant.







To locate the missing USS Protostar, the Vau N&#39;Akat founded The Order, which sent 100 operatives, including the Diviner, back through time, each accompanied by a Drednok: shape-shifting artificial lifeforms equipped with versatile weaponry, designed to protect and serve The Order. The Diviner arrived in the past around 2363, and he discovered the Protostar had been concealed for decades within the Tars Lamora planetoid, so the Diviner created the Tars Lamora prison colony in order to excavate the Protostar. Fearing he wouldn&#39;t live to see the Protostar found, the Diviner went against Drednok&#39;s advice and created his progeny, Gwyndala (Ella Purnell), who could complete his mission after his death.



 Asencia AKA The Vindicator Was Star Trek: Prodigy’s Real Villain 
Asencia posed as a Starfleet Ensign aboard the USS Dauntless.
         

The real villain of Star Trek: Prodigy, the Vindicator, also worked for The Order, but emerged from the temporal anomaly much closer to Prodigy&#39;s present than the Diviner, arriving in the Alpha Quadrant in 2381. While the Diviner bided his time chipping away at Tars Lamora to excavate the Protostar, the Vindicator infiltrated Starfleet posing as Asencia, a Trill ensign serving on the USS Dauntless under Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew). There, Asencia used Janeway&#39;s determination to locate the Protostar by manipulating Janeway with seemingly reasonable suggestions in the Vindicator&#39;s favor.




When the Dauntless found the Diviner, who lost his memory in an encounter with Zero (Angus Imrie), Asencia revealed herself as the Vindicator, and tricked the Diviner into helping her take over the Protostar. The Diviner&#39;s affection for Gwyn prompted a fierce battle between Gwyn and Asencia that ended in the Diviner&#39;s death. After activating the living construct, the Vindicator escaped with Drednok to whereabouts unknown.



 How Protostar’s Young Crew Beat The Vau N’Akat’s Starfleet Destroying Weapon 
Hologram Janeway sacrificed herself to save Starfleet.
         

The Protostar&#39;s young crew beat the Vau N&#39;Akat and saved Starfleet from certain doom by sacrificing the USS Protostar. The activated Living Construct was intertwined with the Protostar&#39;s systems, and already infected Starfleet ships once they contacted each other for help. Gwyn&#39;s bid to non-Federation allies for additional aid wasn&#39;t enough to stop the spread of the construct&#39;s virus; the only way to end the Vau N&#39;Akat&#39;s revenge plan was to cut it off at the source. Gwyn and her friends escaped with their lives, thanks to Hologram Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) volunteering to activate the Protostar&#39;s self-destruct sequence.




The Protostar&#39;s destruction created a wormhole similar to the temporal anomaly that stranded Chakotay in the future, prompting Admiral Janeway to devise a rescue mission that included most of the Protostar&#39;s young crew. Instead of joining the mission, Gwyn decided to complete the Diviner&#39;s mission of saving the Vau N&#39;Akat in her own way, with a plan to travel to Solum and prepare the Vau N&#39;Akat for First Contact, in hopes of avoiding Solum&#39;s devastating civil war. Hopefully, Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will see Gwyn reunite with Admiral Janeway to defeat the Vindicator and save the Vau N&#39;Akat once and for all.
