  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Former 90 Day Fiancé cast member Nicole Nafziger is revealing how much her life has changed since she announced her split from Azan Tefou in 2021.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Nicole Nafziger is leaving no stone unturned to prove that she’s much better off without Azan Tefou in her life. Nicole is a 29-year-old single mom from Florida who fell in love with Azan, also known as Hasan M&rsquo;Rouni, a personal trainer from Morocco, after meeting him on a dating app. Nicole was just 21 when she took a leap of faith and went to see Azan in person on 90 Day Fiancé season 4. Nicole and Azan struggled to find a way to be together because of their delayed wedding.</p>
<p>Azan wasn&rsquo;t attracted to Nicole in the first place. He shut down her attempts at PDA, and there were even rumors Azan was already married. Nicole also didn’t have enough money to bring Azan to the U.S., and he wanted to use the money she was trying to save for their wedding to open a beauty shop in Morocco. It seemed Azan wasn’t with Nicole for the right reasons, so the news of Nicole and Azan’s split was a relief. Nicole claimed she and Azan were on good terms when they ended their relationship. However, it doesn’t look like that is the case anymore.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Nicole Has Resumed Her Exciting Job In The U.S.</p>
<p>Nicole enjoyed working at Starbucks and claimed it was an incredible experience. Working at Starbucks was more than just a job, as she loved her job and the people she worked with. Nicole liked it when fans recognized her and thanked Starbucks for bringing her out of her shell. She said it “molded parts of me that I wouldn’t be without this experience.” Nicole had been trying to get her life back on track by securing a job and getting her own apartment. Nicole had even enrolled her daughter in kindergarten.</p>
<p>Nicole returned to America in August 2020 and announced her split from Azan a year later. A 90 Day Fiancé viewer saw Nicole working at Starbucks again in June 2022, where she was spotted at an outlet in Bradenton. Nicole looked excited about donning the Starbucks barista apron again in a photo she shared on Instagram. Fans loved that Nicole was hustling and taking control of her life after her split.</p>
<p>Does Nicole Think She&rsquo;s &ldquo;Too Cute&rdquo; For Azan?</p>
<p>Nicole endured criticism from Azan throughout their relationship because of her weight. Azan claimed he was catfished by Nicole because she looked “bigger” in real life than she did in her pictures. She went through years of verbal abuse by Azan; he even took Nicole to a local gym in his country to force her to work out. “Whenever I talk to Nicole about being healthy she doesn&rsquo;t like this,&quot; he complained. Azan called Nicole lazy. He claimed he was only “55 percent” in love with Nicole. Azan kept pushing Nicole to work out to the point where she broke down in tears.</p>
<p>Azan shamed Nicole by telling her he wanted a happy and “healthy” family in the future. There were things about Nicole that he wanted to “change.” Azan warned Nicole that if it didn’t happen, he wasn&rsquo;t sure about moving to the U.S. Azan’s words hurt Nicole so much that she started to work out and diet aggressively after returning home. She bought a treadmill and started eating small portions of food, against her will. However, now that she doesn’t have Azan&rsquo;s toxic behavior in her life, Nicole is happy with the way she looks. She doesn’t obsess about her weight on social media anymore.</p>
<pre><code>              90 Day Fiancé- What Happened To Nicole Nafziger After Azan Tefou Split   90 Day Fiancé couple Nicole Nafizger and Azan Tefou aren't together. Nicole announced their split in July 2021. Here's what she's doing in 2023.    
</code></pre>
<p>Nicole Is Being A Good Mom To Daughter May</p>
<p>Nicole’s daughter, May, was just 20 months old when Nicole met Azan online. Nicole went on a five-week trip to Morocco to see Azan in person, while May was left back home. Nicole said she would be judged by people if she took her little girl to meet an unknown man for the first time. Nicole believed fans got the wrong impression of her relationship because she was choosing not to share her whole life online. At the time, fans wanted Nicole to find someone in the U.S. so she could take care of her daughter and herself. They shamed her for making May refer to Azan as her dad.</p>
<p>They hoped she would become more confident and careful instead of getting scammed by someone she met online. Nicole had aggressively defended her decision to leave May behind. She said May wasn’t left alone but was looked after by Nicole’s mom. Now that Nicole is single and is in the U.S., she can give her undivided attention to May. Nicole uses Instagram to share sweet selfies of her and May with her followers. Nicole was with her daughter when May left for her first day at school, as revealed via a post from August 2023.</p>
<p>Nicole Is Flaunting Her Summer Look In Pool Pics</p>
<p>Gone are the days when Nicole was thinking about losing weight every minute. Nicole has stopped sharing photos that show how she looked before and after her weight-loss progress. She even stopped promoting shady weight-loss products and clickbait articles on her Instagram. Instead, Nicole’s Instagram has taken a positive turn. She’s not obsessing about the way she looks and just being the best version of herself. Nicole looks the happiest when she’s in the pool with May, showing off her summer look.</p>
<p>Although Nicole doesn’t look much different than before in her newer photos, she appears confident and bold as she smiles for the camera. Nicole&rsquo;s unbothered by the hate on social media even though it’s been years since she was last seen in a 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Meanwhile, Azan avoids posting on Instagram, perhaps out of fear of being attacked by viewers for treating Nicole so poorly. Azan might not be a forgettable name in the franchise, but he wants to be off the radar, unlike Nicole. It doesn’t stop Nicole from attempting to show Azan how happy she is with him out of her life.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
