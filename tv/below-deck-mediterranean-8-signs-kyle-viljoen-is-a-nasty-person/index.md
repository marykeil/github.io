## Literature Review
Kyle Viljoen is a bad friend and has many repulsive personality traits, which makes him one of the most toxic Below Deck Mediterranean cast members.




Kyle Viljoen from Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 isn’t the nicest person, and his actions prove that. The 31-year-old South African stew is most popular for his back-to-back appearances on the Bravo show. Kyle first appeared during the summer of 2022 in season 7. He joined Captain Sandy Yawn’s crew as the Second Stew and proved himself to be one of the most notorious workers on the boat. He got himself in trouble and even got injured, which led the captain to relieve him of his duties.
Kyle’s drama-centered run in season 7 left a bittersweet taste in many viewers’ mouths. Therefore, the reality star was expected to stay away from the small screen and focus on his other careers, such as being a social media influencer. However, Kyle surprised everyone when he returned to Below Deck Mediterranean in season 8. His controversial nature made many fans question the network’s decision to bring him back. There was some suggestion that Captain Sandy lowered her standards by letting Kyle rejoin her crew.

 8  Kyle Talks Behind His Friends&#39; Backs 
Kyle Craves Drama


 







At some points, Kyle seemed like a nice guy during season 7, as he had a positive aura despite his somewhat questionable personality. However, things drastically changed after he appeared in season 8 and created unnecessary drama between his co-stars. One of Kyle’s worst habits became evident when he returned to the show and started creating issues between Tumi Mhlongo and Natalya Scudder. Kyle began to leak his private conversations. He didn’t pick a side and pretended to be the good guy.
            
 
 Should Natalya Scudder Switch To Below Deck Down Under? (Is She Over Below Deck Med?) 
Natalya Scudder from Below Deck Mediterranean might be done with the series. However, maybe she would be a better fit on Below Deck Down Under.









 7  Kyle Caused The Tumi &amp; Natalya Feud 
Kyle Isn’t A True Friend


 







Kyle was the prime reason for Tumi and Natalya&#39;s feud. Tumi trusted Kyle because he was a fellow South African and felt he wouldn’t mess around. Similarly, Natalya felt that Kyle would be a great buddy to her, as they have a long history and maintained a decent friendship in season 7. Unfortunately, Kyle betrayed them both. Recently, Natalya shared that she would not want to work with Kyle again, stating he is a “horrible human being.” Tumi shared something similar and alleged Kyle was after her Chief Stew job.





 6  Kyle Presumably Left Frank For His Now Fiancé 
During Below Deck Mediterranean Season 7


Most people know relationships are easy to start but hard to maintain. However, Kyle’s connection with Frank Fay during Below Deck Mediterranean season 7 suggests that sometimes relationships are strictly just a platform to stand out on a reality TV show. The second stew and charter guest, Frank, met in episode 8 and connected immediately. They became the center attraction of the show and utilized their romance to stand out. However, things changed post-filming as expected. Kyle found another man named Zachary Riley and made him his fiancé. It is possible that Kyle sparked a romance with Frank for TV clout.





 5  He Lied To Natalya About Tumi Wanting To Fire Her 
Kyle Is Never Honest


 







Kyle created drama between Natalya and Tumi with his actions. However, the worst thing he did was make his friend fear for her job when there was no reason for it. Kyle chatted to Tumi about how Natalya was troublesome. Similarly, he told Natalya that Tumi intended to fire her, which worsened her feelings toward the new Chief Stew. It would have been easy to forgive Kyle if he simply shared facts. However, the notorious cast member purposely lied about things and changed the details to spark more drama.





 4  Kyle Acts Like He’s Better Than Everyone 
Kyle Isn’t The Best Second Stew


The way Kyle carries himself makes it hard to like him as a person. It&#39;s clear he feels superior to his co-stars and acts like a big shot. However, he’s a mediocre addition to Captain Sandy’s crew and doesn’t come close to some of the best second stews in Below Deck history. In season 7, viewers spotted one of Kyle’s amateur mistakes that may lead him to have trouble in the future. A Reddit user HiFromNora posted a screenshot of Kyle wiping his sweaty face off while carrying drinks for the guests.





 3  He Seemingly Has No Loyalty 
Kyle Can’t Be Trusted
        

Loyalty is very important in the yachting business. From the trust between workers and their captains to the faith between team members, honesty is essential when sailing hundreds of miles across the ocean. Over the years, crew members like Kate Chastain, Eddie Lucas, Malia White, Hanna Ferrier, Aesha Scott, and many others have proved their allegiances to their crew and leaders. Unfortunately, Kyle has done the opposite. He betrayed Tumi and made her feel he was after her job. He used Natalya despite their history, showing that he only cared about himself. If things ever got worse, Kyle probably wouldn’t think twice before betraying Captain Sandy.





 2  He’s Playing Tumi &amp; Natalya Against Each Other 
Kyle Started Tumi &amp; Natalya’s Rivalry
        

It would have been fine if Kyle had pitted Tumi and Natalya against each other due to their actions. It would still be easy to understand if they had done something wrong to him, pushing him to seek revenge through underhanded tactics. However, neither Tumi nor Natalya has ever done anything to harm Kyle or cause him issues. Instead, they accepted him as a friend and trusted him as a confidant. Unfortunately, Kyle betrayed them both by being the “drama queen” he is. The second steward had no business instigating their rivalry even before they met in person.





 1  Kyle Likely Played Natalya Against Natasha Webb As Well 
Kyle Doesn’t Like Natalya Very Much
        

Kyle has shared some reasons why he didn’t care much about Natalya’s friendship. Previously, he discussed how Natalya never showed interest in his life despite him spending time listening to hers. He said (via CheatSheet), “I feel like I was open with her from the get go. She never once asked me about my life.” It’s possible that Kyle simply disliked how self-centered Natalya was from day 1. He may have also perpetrated the issues between Natalya and Natasha in season 7, somehow behind the scenes. After all, the Below Deck Mediterranean star did take note of the tension between former Chief Stew and his on-again-off-again friend.
Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EDT on Bravo.
