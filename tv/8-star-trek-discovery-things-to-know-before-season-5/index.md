## Literature Review
Star Trek: Discovery returns for season 5 in 2024 after a 2-year hiatus, and here&#39;s what you need to know about Captain Burnham&#39;s final adventures.




Star Trek: Discovery returns for season 5 in 2024, and here are 8 things to know about the final voyages of Captain Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) and the USS Discovery. When Discovery returns in April 2024 on Paramount&#43;, it will be 25 months since Star Trek: Discovery season 4&#39;s finale premiered in March 2022. Throughout its five-season run, Star Trek: Discovery has been the flagship Star Trek on Paramount&#43; series that spawned the successful spinoff, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, and built the foundation for the Star Trek franchise&#39;s current rejuvenation.
Star Trek: Discovery season 5 will pick up after the events of Discovery season 4, which ended with Captain Burnham leading the USS Discovery across the Galactic Barrier into another galaxy. Burnham and a continent of United Federation of Planets representatives made a successful First Contact with the thoroughly alien Species 10-C, the creators of the Dark Matter Anomaly that threatened the Federation. Discovery breaking new ground with Species 10-C boosted the resurgent Federation, which continues to recover from a century of isolation thanks to The Burn, which Burnham and her starship also solved. By the end of Star Trek: Discovery season 4, United Earth&#39;s President (Stacey Abrams) committed to rejoining the Federation, and the promise of a new tomorrow bolstered the Alpha Quadrant.
            

 Star Trek: Discovery Season 4 Ending Explained (In Detail) 
Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s season 4 finale saw Captain Burnham face Species 10-C and save the galaxy, setting up a brighter season 5 of exploration.





 8  Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 Is The Show&#39;s Final Season 
Only 10 more Discovery episodes remain.
        

Paramount&#43; unexpectedly canceled Star Trek: Discovery in March 2023, which turned Discovery season 5 into the show&#39;s final season. The announcement caught the cast led by Sonequa Martin-Green and the creative team led by showrunner Michelle Paradise by surprise, as Discovery&#39;s people &#34;had no idea&#34; their show was going to end. The changing state of the streaming business is the likely factor in the increasingly expensive Star Trek: Discovery wrapping up. Still, Discovery is the first Star Trek series to reach 5 seasons since Star Trek: Voyager did it in the late 1990s, and 5 seasons is considered a big success in the streaming era.
Paramount&#43;&#39;s original plan to stage multiple media events to hype up Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s final season throughout 2023 was unfortunately photon torpedoed by the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. 






 7  Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 Is An Intergalactic Treasure Hunt 
&#34;The greatest treasure in the known galaxy.&#34;



Star Trek: Discovery released season 5&#39;s first (and thus far, only) teaser trailer at New York Comic Con in October 2022. Discovery season 5&#39;s teaser revealed the premise of the final season as a hunt for &#34;the greatest treasure in the known galaxy&#34;, which is an unknown ancient power that has been dormant for centuries. This marks a change in tone for Star Trek: Discovery away from dire, galaxy-threatening crises to more adventure and exploration, which had been notably missing from the high-stakes, serialized saga. However, Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s trademark thrill ride action will be intact in season 5, and Captain Burnham even rides a starship at warp from the outside.





 6  3 New Characters Join Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 
Meet L&#39;ak, Moll, and Captain Rayner.



A trio of new characters from the 32nd century join Star Trek: Discovery in season 5. Captain Rayner (Callum Keith Rennie) is a pointy-eared Starfleet Captain who hails from Ni&#39;Var and is apparently not a fan of Captain Burnham. Meanwhile, also hunting for the intergalactic treasure are the team of L&#39;ak (Elias Toufexis) and Moll (Eve Harlow), two ex-couriers who have a past with Cleveland Booker (David Ajala). Other supporting characters like Federation President Laira Rillak (Chelah Horsdal), Admiral Charles Vance (Oded Fehr), and Dr. Kovich (David Cronenberg) will also return in Star Trek: Discovery season 5.





 5  Discovery Season 5 Could Set Up Star Trek: Starfleet Academy 
Starfleet Academy could happen after Discovery ends
        

Currently in pre-production is Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, a new series announced by Paramount&#43; in April 2023. Although details are vague about Starfleet Academy, its promotional materials hint that the series is set in the 32nd century, likely after the events of Star Trek: Discovery season 5. Lt. Sylvia Tilly (Mary Wiseman) left the USS Discovery in season 4 to become an instructor in the newly-reopened Starfleet Academy, and Tilly and other Discovery characters could guest star in the new series when it premieres in 2025.
Star Trek: Starfleet Academy&#39;s co-showrunners are executive producer Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau (Nancy Drew), while Star Trek: Lower Decks&#39; Tawny Newsome joined the Starfleet Academy writers room. 






 4  Captain Burnham &amp; Book Are Back Together 
Discovery&#39;s top love story continues.





Cleveland Booker and Captain Michael Burnham have been in love since they literally ran into each other in Star Trek: Discovery season 3&#39;s premiere. Burnham and her Kwejian ex-courier love interest became Discovery&#39;s central romance, but a rift came between them when Book sought revenge for the Dark Matter Anomaly destroying his homeworld in Star Trek: Discovery season 4. Burnham and Book ended Discovery season 4 apart, but all seems forgiven in Discovery season 5 as a clip released during CCXP shows Michael and Booker working together on the hunt for the greatest treasure in the known galaxy.





 3  Saru &amp; Vulcan President T&#39;Rina Are Still A Couple 
Discovery&#39;s unexpected but sweet romance.
        

Captain Saru (Doug Jones) and President T&#39;Rina (Tara Rosling), the Vulcan chief executive of the planet Ni&#39;Var, should still be going strong in Star Trek: Discovery season 5. The Kelpien Saru and the Vulcan President sparked a surprising attraction in Star Trek: Discovery season 3, and their flirtation has resulted in strong romantic feelings. Both noble exemplars of their people, Saru and T&#39;Rina share wisdom, patience, and a deep respect and capacity for understanding other cultures. Perhaps Star Trek: Discovery season 5 will culminate in a remarkable interspecies wedding between Saru and T&#39;Rina?





 2  Jonathan Frakes Is Directing Star Trek: Discovery Series Finale&#39;s First Half 
Frakes says goodbye to his &#34;home&#34; Star Trek series
        

The details of Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s two-part series finale are under wraps, but Jonathan Frakes is confirmed to direct the first half of Discovery&#39;s ending. Frakes is the most successful Star Trek actor-turned-director who helmed numerous TV episodes, as well as the feature films Star Trek: First Contact and Star Trek: Insurrection. After forging a successful TV directing career, Frakes returned to his signature franchise as a director in Star Trek: Discovery season 2. Beloved by every Star Trek cast, Frakes went on to direct episodes of Star Trek: Picard and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, but he has a powerful loyalty to Star Trek: Discovery, which Jonathan considers his &#34;home&#34; Star Trek series. It&#39;s fitting, then, that Frakes gets to help send off Star Trek: Discovery with an &#34;Indiana Jones&#34;-style adventure.





 1  Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s Finale Underwent Reshoots To End The Series 
Discovery&#39;s reshoots make the final episode a proper series finale.
        

After Paramount&#43; announced Star Trek: Discovery season 5 was the show&#39;s final season, reshoots were held in Toronto in the spring of 2023 to turn Discovery&#39;s season 5 finale into an ending for the entire series. Overseen by the finale&#39;s director, Olatunde Osunsanmi, Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s finale reshoots were completed before the Writer&#39;s Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA went on strike. What the reshoots entail isn&#39;t clear, but it&#39;s possibly new scenes meant to wrap up the entire series and the arcs of Captain Burnham and the show&#39;s main characters. Given the emotionally resonant and incredibly popular ending of Star Trek: Picard season 3, Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s series finale has a high bar to reach but never count out Captain Michael Burnham and the USS Discovery&#39;s ability to tug at the heartstrings while saving the galaxy.
Star Trek: Discovery season 5 premieres April 2024 on Paramount&#43;.
