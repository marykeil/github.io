## Literature Review
Screen Rant presents a tense and exciting clip from Reacher season 2 episode 7 in which Jack Reacher confronts Drew Marsh in the lieutenant’s office.




Reacher season 2 nears the end of its run, with the seventh of its eight episodes hitting Prime Video on Friday, January 12th. The show was created by Nick Santora (Scorpion, Prison Break) and based on the hit Jack Reacher book series written by Lee Child. It’s not the first adaptation of Child’s stories, however; the 2012 film Jack Reacher saw Tom Cruise taking on the role of its titular character and saw Cruise pairing with future Mission: Impossible director Christopher McQuarrie for the first time. Still, Santora’s take on the book series has been lauded as an even more detailed and accurate adaptation of Child’s work.




Screen Rant is excited to present a clip from Reacher season 2 episode 7 which shows a tense confrontation between Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson) and Drew Marsh (Al Sapienza). The clip demonstrates how Alan Richtson nails Jack Reacher’s book traits in his portrayal of the character and sets up exciting moments to come in the rest of the episode. Take a look at the clip below:


 


 What’s Next For Reacher 
         

As seen in the clip above, Reacher season 2 episode 7 will follow up on one of the major plotlines explored in the show’s sixth episode. Russo’s death is essentially on Marsh’s hands, and Reacher’s drive to bring Langston to justice will clearly see him stop at nothing to achieve his goal. With a sad Reacher finale setup in episode 6, the remainder of Reacher season 2 is likely to explore the depth of Reacher’s commitment and force him to make some of his hardest decisions yet.




Luckily for viewers, the Reacher season 2 finale won’t be the end of the road for the character. Reacher season 3 is currently in production, as seen in a set video shared by Alan Ritchson in December of 2023. A release date is yet to be announced, but expectations are that the show will premiere in late 2024 or early 2025. For now, tune in to catch Reacher season 2 episode 7 on January 12th, and return for the season 2 finale on January 19th.



Reacher season 2 episode 7 will be released on Amazon Prime Video on January 12th.




             Reacher Produced by Amazon Prime Video, Reacher adapts Lee Child&#39;s Jack Reacher book series to live-action. The series follows veteran Military Police Officer Jack Reacher as he unravels a dangerous conspiracy in the fictional town of Margrave, Georgia. Played by the towering Alan Ritchson, the titular hero collaborates with officer Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) and Chief Detective Oscar Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin) to clean his name and save Margrave from crime and corruption.
