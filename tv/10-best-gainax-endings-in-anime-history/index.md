# 10 Best Gainax Endings in Anime History


## SUMMARY

 Sometimes, the purpose of a Gainax ending is to capture the unique and strange nature of the story being told. 
 Many anime with Gainax endings require viewers to read the manga or watch the series multiple times, such as classics like 
Clannad
, to fully understand the conclusion.

## Literature Review
A &#34;Gainax ending&#34; refers to any ending that&#39;s just completely random and out of left field, and here are the 10 anime with the best endings like that.




Studio Gainax is an anime studio with an incredibly distinctive style, and a key part of that stems from how their anime often end. Befitting the bizarre nature of their anime, many Gainax series have endings that make little to no sense with how the story was going, and any anime that does the same, regardless of the studio, is referred to as having a &#34;Gainax ending&#34;.
Gainax endings have become a major trademark of anime, whether it&#39;s a Studio Gainax anime or one produced by another studio, and some stand out far more than others. More often than not, an anime will have a Gainax ending because the studio needs to find a way to end the show, no matter how weird it might be, and other times, it will be done on purpose to lean into the bizarre nature of its story.
        

Whatever the case, there are plenty of anime with endings that perfectly capture the bizarre nature of Studio Gainax.









 








 10  Berserk&#39;s Changes Made Its Ending Even Worse 
Berserk (1997)
        

The first noteworthy &#34;Gainax ending&#34; is from OLM, Inc.&#39;s Berserk anime. The original Berserk anime only made it to the Eclipse, specifically, Griffith assaulting Casca in front of Guts, but unlike in the manga, the original Berserk anime cut away from the Eclipse without showing how Guts survived or what happened to everyone, and because the Skull Knight was cut, there&#39;s no way to understand what happened. It&#39;s a classic case of an anime not having time to adapt everything and forcing people to read the manga, and it&#39;s lived on in infamy for over 20 years.





 9  Medaka Box Made Reading The Manga A Requirement 
Medaka Box (2012)


 







Another Gainax ending that stems from changes to the original manga is Studio Gainax&#39;s Medaka Box. Medaka Box progressed through its adaptation in a fairly normal way through most of its run, but not only did the penultimate episode of Medaka Box end on a cliffhanger with Kumagawa making his debut by mutilating Medaka&#39;s allies, but the series finale, rather than follow up on that, was a completely unrelated story that was a sequel to a side story from the manga. Nothing that happens at the end of Medaka Box makes sense without reading or having read the manga, and that&#39;s perfectly fitting for a Gainax anime.

 8  Zombie Land Saga Ended With A Bizarre Tease For Its Next Arc 
Zombie Land Saga (2018)
        

For a more recent anime with a Gainax ending, a great example is Studio MAPPA&#39;s Zombie Land Saga. Zombie Land Saga was always a bizarre series thanks to its absurdist nature and how many elements of its worldbuilding received little to no explanation for them, but the Zombie Land Saga season 2 finale took its absurdity to another level when the happy ending of Franchouchou putting Saga on the path to recovery is upended by a UFO appearing and blowing everything up. The upcoming Zombie Land Saga is sure to explain what happened, but regardless, it’s an absurd note to end on, even for a show like Zombie Land Saga.

 7  Devilman Crybaby&#39;s Ending Perfectly Modernizes The Original Series 
Devilman Crybaby (2018)


 







Another relatively recent anime with a Gainax ending is Science Saru&#39;s Devilman Crybaby. Everything in Devilman Crybaby got increasingly dark as Akira&#39;s loved ones died one by one, demons took over the world, and Ryo, Akira&#39;s best friend, revealed himself to be Satan. The Devilman Crybaby finale took that even further when, after Akira died and Ryo mourned for him, God suddenly appeared out of nowhere to destroy and reset the world. The ending is essentially a modern take on how the original Devilman manga ended, albeit with certain details left out, but that doesn’&#39; make it any less bizarre and out of left field.

 6  Clannad&#39;s Ending Only Makes Sense After Watching It More Than Once 
Clannad (2007)
        

Many stories only start to make sense with repeated viewings, and an anime that perfectly exemplifies that with its ending is Kyoto Animation&#39;s Clannad. The last few episodes of Clannad took a dark turn with the deaths of Tomoya, Nagisa, and Ushio, but out of nowhere, the garbage doll and girl in the illusionary world are revealed to be reincarnations of Tomoya and Ushio, and they use the light orbs that have appeared across Clannad to reverse time and stop Nagisa from dying. The only setup for the ending came from seemingly meaningless dialogue, so more often than not, Clannad&#39;s ending would make zero sense to someone without repeated viewings.

 5  Space Dandy&#39;s Ending Made Its Story Even Weirder 
Space Dandy (2014)
        

Sometimes, an anime will have a Gainax ending on purpose to go along with a bizarre story, and a perfect example of that is Studio Bones&#39; Space Dandy. Space Dandy established itself as an absurdist series from the very start, but the Space Dandy series finale took things even further by having the entire universe be destroyed, the narrator was revealed to be God, and Dandy forcing the entire universe to reset back to the series premiere with him now having a thing for legs. Even by Space Dandy&#39;s standards, the ending felt over-the-top, and there would have been no better way for the series to end.

 4  Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo Used Its Cancelation To Its Advantage 
Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo (2003)
        

Another anime with a Gainax ending that was perfectly in line with its absurdist nature is Toei Animation&#39;s Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo is famous for its bizarre writing and penchant for fourth wall humor, and the Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo series finale leaned into its absurdist nature by setting up a big conflict between the heroes and the villains, only for the heroes to suddenly stop what they&#39;re doing as they realize that it&#39;s the last episode. It was very clearly another example of an anime ending before it could finish adapting the manga, and Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo making a joke out of it is the exact kind of ridiculousness it thrives on.





 3  Paranoia Agent’s Ending Perfectly Highlighted Satoshi Kon&#39;s Style 
Paranoia Agent (2004)
        

Satoshi Kon was famous for the surreal nature of his projects, and an anime that leaned into that with its Gainax ending was Madhouse&#39;s Paranoia Agent. As surreal as Paranoia Agent could get, it reached its peak in the finale when Tsukiko, after confronting her past, causes all traces of Maromi and Lil&#39; Slugger to vanish from the world, while Maniwa is driven insane as he solves a complex equation with an answer that’s never revealed before the credits roll. It would have been weirder if Paranoia Agent didn&#39;t have such a bizarre ending, and it all serves as a perfect encapsulation of what made Satoshi Kon so great.

 2  Panty &amp; Stocking With Garterbelt&#39;s Ending Is Bizarre To The Point Of Parody 
Panty &amp; Stocking With Garterbelt (2010)
        

Of all the Gainax endings for anime specifically made by Studio Gainax, few are more famous than the ending to Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt. After the heroes end up in a seemingly hopeless situation, a pair of photorealistic legs defeat Corset before immediately leaving, and then Stocking suddenly reveals herself to be a demon before cutting Panty up into 666 pieces and forces the rest of the cast to travel the world to gather them up. Considering the absurd nature of the show, it almost feels like a parody of Gainax endings, and with any luck, New Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt will try and make some sense of it.

 1  Neon Genesis Evangelion Has Two Wild Endings 
Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995)


 







The final noteworthy Gainax ending to discuss is for the anime that arguably popularized the term: Studio Gainax&#39;s Neon Genesis Evangelion. Despite having a wide assortment of plot points to resolve, Neon Genesis Evangelion&#39;s final episodes were focused solely on exposition and developing Shinji&#39;s character through largely still frames and recycled animation, and when The End of Evangelion tried to conclude the series, it did so by having everyone die, with Shinji strangling Asuka on a beach. Evangelion&#39;s bizarre ending has been one of the biggest talking points in anime for decades, and it&#39;s easy to see why it’s one of the best Gainax endings in anime history.
