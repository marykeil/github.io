# Sister Wives Janelle Attempts To Erase Complicated Family History With Meri But Fans Know The Truth


## SUMMARY 



  Many Sister Wives fans are upset with Janelle for not revealing her previous marriage to Meri&#39;s late brother, accusing her of rewriting history.   Redditors believe that Janelle&#39;s omission of her past relationship with Meri&#39;s family is the reason for Meri&#39;s dislike towards her.   Janelle&#39;s decision to not mention her previous marriage could be seen as deliberate or simply a result of her focusing on her initial meeting with Kody.

## Literature Review
Viewers don’t appreciate Janelle Brown dismissing her real connection with Meri Brown and her family in the latest episode of Sister Wives.




Many Sister Wives viewers aren’t happy with Janelle Brown hiding her real past and connection to Meri Brown. Janelle has been the MVP of season 18. She’s documenting her split from Kody Brown and finally rediscovering her worth. Recently, Janelle talked to the cameras and shared how she felt when seeing Kody for the first time. Janelle said she was friends with Meri’s family before she even met Kody. The mom of six revealed that she got a positive feeling upon meeting the Brown family patriarch.




As shown in a Reddit thread by AnotherHopeless, many Sister Wives fans think Janelle was wrong to omit the part that she was previously married to Meri’s late brother. They accused her of rewriting history and wrote, “are they trying to erase the idea she was married to her brother first?”


 

Many Redditors felt offended that Janelle tried to make it seem like she was only a family friend instead of Meri’s former sister-in-law. A Reddit user commented, “that is the real reason why Meri does not like her.” Another commented, “she knows how awful it looks that she fell for a married man while she was married.”

 Where Do Janelle &amp; Meri Currently Stand With Kody Brown? 
          

Meri and Janelle’s relationship with Kody drastically changed over the years. In Janelle’s case, she became more aware of Kody’s bad attitude and started reevaluating her marriage. Former sister-wife Christine Brown also encouraged Janelle to leave her husband, as there was nothing redeemable between them. In comparison, Meri entered a state of complete denial. She overlooked the red flags and Kody’s lack of desire to fix the relationship just to continue the marriage. As for Kody, he’s seemingly done with both of his wives and appears open to living a monogamous life with Robyn Brown.

Fans are certainly right to question Janelle’s intentions. Over the years, they’ve seen the Utah native expand her family with Kody and reveal her many secrets. She had previously talked about being married to Meri’s brother, so it makes no sense for her to avoid the truth in the confessional. Many viewers know the truth about the Brown family and Kody’s marriages. They knew Janelle had a husband before, just like Robyn had been married. There’s absolutely no point in Janelle hiding something well-known and very prevalent.




Still, Janelle is a smart and nice woman. She was either deliberately changing the past or simply stating the facts in a general tone. Janelle did not tell the cameras that she was married to Meri’s brother because that wasn’t her goal. She was discussing her first meeting with Kody and only focused on that. Her words could mean she was simply letting fans know she knew Meri’s family before Meri knew Kody. The Sister Wives star may have left out mentioning her previous marriage because the nature of the interview didn&#39;t require her to explain that.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
