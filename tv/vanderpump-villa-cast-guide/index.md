                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Marciano Brunette, Lead Server 

 




Lisa’s new show, Vanderpump Villa, has a vibrant cast list of skillful staff members. One such name is Marciano Brunette, who’s the lead server. The Las Vegas man is energetic and passionate. Marciano’s Instagram suggests he’s into fitness and partying, and even knows some famous people, such as bodybuilder Jay Cutler’s wife, Angie Feliciano, Dan Bilzerian, Mike Tyson, and more. However, he’s relatively unknown and only has 2,500 followers on Instagram.



 Andre Mitchell, Mixologist 

 

Vanderpump Villa’s cocktail responsibilities will go to Andre Mitchell. The Dallas-based Mixologist will showcase his skills to the world when the show debuts on Hulu. For now, his Instagram reveals that he’s a fun-loving model. Andre seems like a prideful individual who believes in himself and his individuality. He&#39;s religious and talks about his love for God on social media. In October 2023, Andre shared a post about getting baptized again and posted a video of the religious ceremony, writing, “I was going to church like a normal Sunday had no plans on getting baptized again.”






 Eric Funderwhite, Chateau Manager 

 

Eric Funderwhite is the manager of the chateau. The Los Angeles native will handle most activities around the French villa and hopefully maintain decorum. However, Eric’s Instagram shows he’s an entrepreneur who likes working out and posting his fitness photos. In December 2023, Eric shared a video of himself deadlifting nearly 490 pounds. Many of his 1900 followers supported him and shared kind comments. It’ll be interesting to see if Eric can carry the weight of Vanderpump Villa’s demands like he lifts his dumbbells.



 Emily Kovacs, Housekeeper 

 




Emily Kovacs will handle the housekeeping around the Vanderpump Villa. The New York-based Housekeeper looks pretty confident in her official photos. It’ll be interesting to see if she can please Lisa with her work. While the 25-year-old doesn’t have too many posts on her page, the content she has on her profile shows that she enjoys being around her family and friends. Emily also enjoys sporting beachwear and partying under the sun. She has shared quite a few pictures of herself modeling in bikinis.

                  Why Vanderpump Rules Star Tom Schwartz Is Just As Shady As Tom Sandoval (Will The 2 Toms Be On Vanderpump Villa?)   Tom Sandoval seems to be the shadiest Vanderpump Rules guy, but Tom Schwartz may deserve the title. He&#39;s more low-key, but he&#39;s still sketchy.     



 Stephen Alsvig, Events Coordinator 
         

Stephen Alsvig is the Events Coordinator at Lisa’s French Villa. She already has a fairly successful social media page with nearly 5000 followers. He loves talking about occasional outings and posting photos with his friends. Stephen claims he’s a “Disney Daddy,” which is clear from his social media photos. He loves to sport Disney merchandise and talk about it on his Instagram. According to Stephen’s bio, he’s all about courage and kindness; he is clearly the perfect guy for handling an events coordinator job.






 Anthony Bar, Executive Chef 

 

Every villa needs a good chef. Therefore, Lisa has picked a culinary veteran, Anthony Bar, to be the executive chef for Vanderpump Villa. The Los Angeles native has French roots, which makes him ideal for working at the French country houses. He also has over two decades of experience, which will come in handy while dealing with tough challenges on the show. Anthony posted a throwback video of himself in January 2023, where he talked a bit about his past as a Chef. He captioned it, “14 years old to 37 Don’t rush the process, good things take time.”



 Priscila Ferrari, Server 
         




Priscila Ferrari will be one of the servers at Vanderpump Villa. She has an active social media page with nearly 5K followers. Her Instagram reveals that she’s originally from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, but currently resides in the United States. Priscilla seems like a great and friendly co-worker, having posted photos and videos with her co-stars over the months. In December 2023, she shared an Instagram reel from her visit to Disneyland. She was there with many of her Vanderpump Villa crew members, including Disney lover Stephen.



 Telly Hall, Mixologist 
          

A large house like Vanderpump Villa will have guests demanding the finest cocktails, so Lisa hired Telly Hall as another Mixologist. Telly, from Atlanta, seems to have the right energy and a bright smile needed for the job. Some of Telly’s social media posts show that she loves wearing exotic outfits, travels, and enjoys every moment of her life. Telly is active on Instagram and has a vibrant personality, just as colorful as her drinks. She dressed as Catwoman during Halloween 2023, showing off her jaw-dropping costume.

 Grace Cottrell, Housekeeper 
         

Grace Cottrell is the Housekeeper at Vanderpump Villa. The Saint Augustine resident was in a few scenes in the trailer, making the bed and carefully doing her job. Grace seems to be a friendly and caring person who loves her family. In December 2022, the Vanderpump Villa housekeeper shared a picture of her nephew, Reed. She captioned it, “thank you God for this life.”



 Hannah Fouch, Server 

 




Hannah Fouch is another server at Vanderpump Villa. The Las Vegas native has the looks and personality for the job, which may be why Lisa handpicked her for such a crucial role. Hannah doesn’t have a straightforward bio on her Instagram. Rather, she has shown herself and her personality through her photos and videos. Some of Hannah’s posts show she loves holidays and her dog. The Vanderpump Villa star has also shared many pictures with her friends, including one that shows her at a Taylor Swift concert.



 Caroline Byl, Sous Chef 

 

Caroline Byl is the sous chef at Vanderpump Villa. The Miami native will be second in command of the kitchen and will work with head chef Anthony to ensure guests enjoy the tastiest meals. Caroline claims to be a culinary artist on Instagram. Her bio states that she blends “culinary, fashion &amp; design” at her job. Caroline is an entrepreneur with her beauty, cosmetic, and personal care brand, Bayler Paris. She often promotes it on her social media, where she also shares modeling photos, fitness videos, and more. Caroline claims she was “born with high heels.”






 Gabriella Sanon, Event Coordinator 

 

Gabriella Sanon is the event coordinator at Vanderpump Villa. The Miami native calls herself a “food consultant” on her Instagram. She likes to post photos of delicious-looking exotic meals and content with her friends. Gabriella isn’t very active on social media, which explains why she only has 500 followers. She is also the only cast member who doesn’t mention her affiliation with Vanderpump Villa on her Instagram. Gabriella’s silence on social media hints she’ll be part of some drama on the show. Vanderpump Villa viewers must wait until spring 2024 to find the answers.



Vanderpump Villa will premiere on Hulu in spring 2024.
