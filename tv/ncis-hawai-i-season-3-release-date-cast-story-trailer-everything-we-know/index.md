## Literature Review

NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 is renewed, but NCIS fans will likely have to wait until 2024 to see new episodes with Jane Tennant&#39;s team.




NCIS: Hawai’i is the third successful spin-off of the NCIS series from CBS, which debuted in 2003 as a spin-off of the military legal drama JAG. While JAG placed much of its drama in a courtroom, NCIS focuses on the investigation instead. Though NCIS takes place in Washington, DC, each of the spin-offs has taken place in a different location. NCIS: Hawai’i marks the first one outside the contiguous United States.




NCIS: Hawai’i centers on Vanessa Lachey as Jane Tennant, the first female Supervisory Special Agent in NCIS history to take over the Pearl Harbor area. It also marks the first time the NCIS franchise has made a woman the permanent team leader. With a diverse cast and a very different setting from its predecessors, NCIS: Hawai’i has developed a loyal following since its 2021 TV debut.

 Latest NCIS: Hawai&#39;i Season 3 News 
          

As the show&#39;s return date looms, the latest news finds a trailer for NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 which teases the newest season. Besides the usual explosive action and procedural drama that fans have come to expect from the spinoff, the new trailer also gives viewers their first glimpse of LL Cool J&#39;s Sam Hanna as he makes the jump from NCIS: Los Angeles to the Hawai&#39;i-based spinoff. 






 NCIS: Hawai&#39;i Season 3 Release Date 
          

NCIS Hawai&#39;i will return to a Monday night timeslot on CBS, starting on Feb 12th, 2024 at 10 pm. This is directly after NCIS Season 21 airs at 9 pm, creating an NCIS double-bill for fans.



 NCIS: Hawai&#39;i Season 3 Cast 
          

There have been no announcements about major cast changes to the series, so the NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 cast should be led by Vanessa Lachey as Jane Tennant. However, the announcement was also made at the end of the second season that NCIS: Los Angeles cast member LL Cool J would recur in NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 as Sam Hanna. 




While not formally announced, it’s possible that Julie White and Henry Ian Cusick could return in a recurring capacity for the NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 cast. They both appeared in season 2 in important roles. While White played a former mentor of Jane Tennant who is now a fugitive, Cusick played an internal affairs agent making calls for the team. It seems unlikely that NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 wouldn’t revisit both of their characters.

Also expected to appear in the NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 cast are:

 Actor  NCIS: Hawai&#39;i Role   Alex Tarrant  Kai Holman   Noah Mills  Jesse Boon   Yasmine Al-Bustami  Lucy Tara   Tori Anderson  Katherine Marie &#34;Kate&#34; Whistler   Jason Antoon  Ernie Malik   Kian Talan  Alex Tennant   Mahina Napoleon  Julie Tennant   Anthony Ruivivar  Daniel Tennant   Enver Gjokaj  Captain Joe Milius   Sharif Atkins  Captain Norman &#34;Boom Boom&#34; Gates   Seana Kofoed  Commander Carla Chase   








 NCIS: Hawai&#39;i Season 3 Story 
          

NCIS: Hawai&#39;i season 3 might see Jane wanting to track down her former mentor since the latter is now a fugitive after escaping custody after helping on a case. It’s also not clear how NCIS: Los Angeles character Sam Hanna will be brought into the series, but helping to track down a fugitive could be a way to keep him recurring without having the character physically in every episode. Otherwise, the new season will also likely feature the usual case-of-the-week structure of most procedurals.

Though an overarching story isn&#39;t hinted at in the trailer, it&#39;s clear that season 3 will be the biggest yet.
