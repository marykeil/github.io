Usman exhibits sociopathic traits, such as glib charm and dishonesty. He never really seems to love anyone.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé star Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar is definitely the ultimate franchise heartbreaker. Will Kim Menzies ever recover from his endless mind games?</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Kim Menzies fell hopelessly in love with slick charmer Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar, and she may never date another man who makes her feel the same way. Although she could try to date, Sojaboy brought something unique to the table which she may not be able to find anywhere else. Kim has a lot to offer. She&rsquo;s kind and tried to do what Usman wanted. Also, she&rsquo;s intelligent, although she has blind spots. Kim started out as seasoned player Usman&rsquo;s superfan. She liked his music and wanted to get to know him. Right from the start, there was a bit of a rock star/groupie dynamic, which didn&rsquo;t exactly scream, &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Usman has an MO with women. Every one of them gets the same treatment. He learns about them and then tells them everything they want to hear. He mirrors them to give them an ultra-romantic experience. However, what he doesn&rsquo;t do is show them who he really is. Basically, they&rsquo;re getting a performance from a very adept actor. They believe all of it. Even though he&rsquo;s used and discarded countless women, the next in line still falls for the lies and loves all the sweet talk. Each one adores Usman and suffers when he finally unmasks. Since 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Usman was never on the level, what Kim fell in love with didn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>

<p>Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar Preys On Women
Does Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar Have A Conscience?</p>
<p>Kim should have known better but Usman&rsquo;s the predatory one. He has a pattern of choosing vulnerable women. They&rsquo;re getting on in years and longing for romance. He&rsquo;s there to deliver, but his love isn&rsquo;t real and there are so many strings attached. Usman comes off as charming and fun, with a bit of artistic ability that&rsquo;s like the cherry on top. However, his charm&rsquo;s dialed up a little too high. Usman&rsquo;s there to make woman swoon. When he does, he can control them.</p>
<p>If someone&rsquo;s charm&rsquo;s at an unnaturally high level, this is a major red flag.</p>
<p>Few people are so charming without really working at it. Usman&rsquo;s perfected his smooth facade, but why? To get what he wants. That&rsquo;s only wrong when he uses other people. Sadly, he does this a lot. Outside his love life, Usman may not be a con artist. However, within the parameters of his relationships, Usman is a scammer. He pretends. The problem is that he pretends so well.</p>
<p>A master of deception, &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; makes it feel so real. The emotions he evokes are authentic. So, although Kim was being conned, all the love she felt was genuine. As she makes peace with how things are now, she&rsquo;ll sometimes look back, remembering feelings of love as dialed-up as Usman&rsquo;s charm. Looking back may hurt her.</p>
<p>Kim was nice about their breakup and willing to stay friends. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that she wasn&rsquo;t harmed by the experience.</p>
<p>Usman does exhibit sociopathic traits, although only a psychiatrist is qualified to diagnose another person. Glib, with superficial charm and a penchant for deceit, Usman has many of the character traits of someone with antisocial personality disorder. Sociopaths have that disorder.</p>
<p>A person might look at the extroverted and jolly Usman and say, how could he be antisocial? That&rsquo;s a good question - the answer is that the antisocial conduct is covert. While the person may seem helpful and kind on the surface, behind the scenes, they are working against their friends, colleagues and romantic partners. That covert hostility is a hallmark of sociopathy. Also, sociopaths are quite vindictive, usually, out of all proportion to a perceived offense. That&rsquo;s another red flag. Here are some key features of sociopathy (antisocial personality disorder):</p>
<p>conning for fun and profit (duper&rsquo;s delight)  glib and superficial charm  incapacity for love  sex appeal  vindictiveness  trouble making long-term plans (psychopaths plan, sociopaths are more impulsive and aggressive)  criminal offenses (these people don&rsquo;t get &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; even after punishment)  considering life a &ldquo;game&rdquo; perhaps due to muted emotions, except anger  shallow romantic relationships, including marriages  willingness to con even the closest connections, such as spouses and relatives  infidelity/serial cheating  aliases</p>
<p>While Usman didn&rsquo;t go after Kim following the breakup, he found covert ways to rub his post-split happiness in her face. On social media, he acted like he didn&rsquo;t have a care in the world. He cozied up to other women. He did the same thing after his memorable romance with Lisa &lsquo;Babygirl&rsquo; Hamme imploded. Usman acts carefree because he is - a person with sociopathic traits may get angry, but their other emotions are typically muted. So, they aren&rsquo;t sitting around crying.</p>
<p>Did Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar Ever Care About Kim Menzies?</p>
<p>Although Usman poses as deep and emotional on Instagram, as seen in the post above, he probably never cared about Kim. If he does have sociopathic traits, he may have viewed her as a means to an end. The truly sociopathic see people as objects. In other words, they&rsquo;d consider a person about as valuable as a material possession, such as a computer or television. This scary coldness can be very jarring, but sociopaths learn early in life to conceal what they are.</p>
<p>A sociopath mimics the emotions that they can&rsquo;t feel, including joy. That&rsquo;s sad in a way, as no one should have to cloak their personality. But the reality of what a sociopath is can be so difficult for people with consciences to accept. So, the games go on. With that in mind, expect more meaningless romances between Usman and his &ldquo;marks&rdquo; in the future. That is the one thing that everyone can count on.</p>
<p>Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar Kept Kim Menzies Off Balance
Kim Menzies Could Never Have Peace</p>
<p>Even if Kim and Usman stayed together, she never would have had any peace. Now, she seems much happier. In the past, she had to deal with so many tough emotions, including confusion, anger and jealousy. Usman is such a player, it&rsquo;s almost comical. He&rsquo;s like a caricature of a charismatic man who uses all of his skills to fool women. This &ldquo;magic man&rdquo; keeps every single woman off balance. This guy could probably run a successful cult because he just puts them under his spell.</p>
<p>Women can&rsquo;t resist Usman. They know what he&rsquo;s all about, and it doesn&rsquo;t even seem to matter. They sign up for more of what he doles out. Of course, they see the red flags. Usman&rsquo;s relationship with Lisa was out there for the whole world to see. All of his conning ways weren&rsquo;t exactly a secret. So, why did Kim, a woman of a certain age, get involved with this kind of smooth operator? Obviously, he gave her the kind of romance that she was looking for. Perhaps Usman really brings the passion behind closed doors! However, sometimes, it seemed like intimacy with Kim wasn&rsquo;t exactly his top priority.</p>
<p>Sometimes, guys like this like to give women what they want and then take it away. They may taunt them by flaunting their connections with other females or suddenly reject them. Again, it&rsquo;s the sense of &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about creating a little mayhem and throwing the partner off balance. At one point, Kim was pushing for intimacy with Usman, and he just didn&rsquo;t want to, or was trying to exert power over her by withholding his affections. That&rsquo;s no way to treat a woman.</p>
<p>The best thing she could do is get away from him, even if a breakup&rsquo;s Usman&rsquo;s choice. However, accepting the fact that this type of unusual relationship&rsquo;s over can be very difficult. It takes a particular type of man to put one over on a woman, faking his way through everything. A lot of people don&rsquo;t have the stomach for that.</p>
<p>Usman&rsquo;s player ways may have scarred Kim for life.</p>
<p>Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Marks&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t Get Out Unscathed
Is Kim Menzies Okay Now?</p>
<p>When this sort of romance ends, a woman can be left wondering what was real. Was anything real? Any good memories that remain may be corrupted by these questions. Often, it&rsquo;s easier to just not think about it all. However, when it&rsquo;s time to move on, the past can be an issue. Nothing feels quite as &ldquo;right&rdquo; as it did with the scammer. It just doesn&rsquo;t feel the same. In the clip above, as per 90 Day Fiancé at YouTube, Kim was dealing with the green-eyed monster while Usman was filming a music video with young and attractive females. If they hadn&rsquo;t split up, there would be more of that type of pain in her future.</p>
<p>Why did the two split up? What was the official reason? They didn&rsquo;t go into a ton of detail about the breakup, citing personal reasons and leaving it at that. However, when it came to life goals, they had some problems getting on the same page. Usman said that he wanted children, which meant that he&rsquo;d need to take more than one wife. So, Kim, an American woman who wasn&rsquo;t raised with polygamous values, would have to dig deep to accept that arrangement.</p>
<p>Then, there was another problem, which was Usman&rsquo;s seeming fixation on his ex, whom he wrote a song about. Her name was Zara. It&rsquo;s not exactly a good sign when a man&rsquo;s looking back so often and thinking about another woman. Kim really had her work cut out for her here, and she was basically in a no-win situation. All she can do is cut her losses. She&rsquo;s trying to, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that she isn&rsquo;t heartbroken.</p>
<p>Moving on may be tough for Kim because Usman messed with her head. He made it seem like she meant a lot to him, but possibly she didn&rsquo;t. Also, he wouldn&rsquo;t meet her needs, such as her desire for intimacy. In a relationship, these things are just basics. Usman&rsquo;s career means that he&rsquo;ll always have fans, some of whom will be much younger than Kim is. The burden of dealing with his interactions with other females and the emotional turmoil that they cause doesn&rsquo;t seem worth it anyway. If he was on the level, maybe they could navigate that. However, Usman&rsquo;s never been on the level with anyone. He probably never will be.</p>
<p>Being A 90 Day Fiance Heel Has Helped Usman To Stay Famous
Usman &ldquo;Sojaboy&rdquo; Umar Is A Clout Chaser</p>
<p>Usman&rsquo;s playing the fame game. Older women help him to win the game. Sure, he&rsquo;s often perceived as a villain, but being a 90 Day Fiancé &ldquo;heel&rdquo; has its benefits. Usman&rsquo;s waylaid his ability to dupe women into a veritable cottage industry. He leverages his looks and charm to get rewards. For example, he&rsquo;s a bona fide reality star now, who makes appearances on television and streaming platforms.</p>
<p>The fame he&rsquo;s gained by taking advantage of women has led to more success online. Since Usman&rsquo;s promoting music, the clout he&rsquo;s chased and gained has really helped him. Without reality fame, carving out an identity in the very competitive music industry might be an uphill battle.</p>
<p>Right now, Usman has 305K Instagram followers. While he&rsquo;s not really in the big leagues at Instagram, he has quite an impressive following. He uses his platform to advertise his music videos and let fans know what he&rsquo;s up to. He&rsquo;s quite slick in terms of knowing how to promote himself. This slick quality got him where he is. For him, what&rsquo;s missing is integrity. Yes, he&rsquo;s got a commercial look that sells and he appears to have a genuine passion for music. However, he&rsquo;s not really perceived as a good guy.</p>
<p>Maybe being a good guy isn&rsquo;t really a goal. Kim and Babygirl Lisa found out the hard way that trying to make things work with the Nigerian man was futile. That&rsquo;s because those relationships were never intended to last. Now, Kim has to try again. Her son Jamal Menzies has tried to help by giving her advice. He wants her to avoid the player type - can she do it? She may find it easier not to try. There&rsquo;s more to life than romance and 90 Day Fiancé star Kim may not want to get burned again.</p>
