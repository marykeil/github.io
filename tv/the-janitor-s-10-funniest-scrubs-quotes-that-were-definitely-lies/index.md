## Literature Review
It can be difficult to tell when Neil Flynn&#39;s Scrubs character is bending the truth, but some of the Janitor&#39;s claims are obviously lies.




The Janitor in Scrubs made some outlandish claims over his eight seasons, but some were easily identified as outright lies. Sacred Heart&#39;s custodian loved misleading the other members of the Scrubs cast, and he did so in almost every episode. Although he was clearly an unusual man, the Janitor wasn&#39;t quite as irregular as he wanted people to think. For all of his bizarre moments on the show, Neil Flynn&#39;s Scrubs character had no shortage of scenes where he wore his on his sleeve. For all the show&#39;s emotional hallmarks, the Janitor&#39;s obvious untruths stick in the mind most prominently.Neil Flynn isn&#39;t in all 9 seasons of Scrubs, but starred as the Janitor from 2001 to 2009, departing the show after Scrubs season 8. The Janitor was originally supposed to be imaginary in Scrubs season 1, only visible to Zach Braff&#39;s JD. However, the character was such a shit that Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence made it so the Janitor became real from Scrubs season 2 onward. The Janitor is mostly remembered for his eight-year feud with JD, endlessly torturing Braff&#39;s character as he progressed through his career as a doctor at Sacred Heart Hospital. Much of this dynamic involved sharing an endless supply of highly suspect statements and anecdotes.
            
 
 Scrubs: The Janitor&#39;s Real Name Explained 
The Janitor&#39;s real name has been the source of much debate in the years since Scrubs first aired, but what is Neil Flynn&#39;s character actually called?













 








 10  That He Still Worked At Sacred Heart 
The Janitor shocked Ted with his lying prowess
        

The Janitor&#39;s talent for dishonesty was vital in reclaiming his job at Sacred Heart. In Scrubs season 8, episode 4, &#34;My Happy Place,&#34; the Janitor simply starts working at the hospital again despite his dismissal by the new chief of medicine earlier in the season. His claims that everything will work out for him are put to the test when paychecks start being dispensed and his is missing.After a brief spell of spinning a yarn about his recent absence, the lady in charge of payroll acquiesces and leaves to get his paycheck. The scene shows how easily the Janitor slips into the world of fiction, and Ted is blown away by the efficacy of the Janitor&#39;s lies. This is, however, one of the Janitor&#39;s more grounded deceptions, as anything too far-fetched would likely have blown his cover.





 9  Neil Flynn&#39;s Character Had A Twin Brother Called Roscoe 
Turk and JD didn&#39;t believe him for a second


 







The Janitor&#39;s commitment to misleading people has to be respected. Throughout the events of Scrubs season 3, episode 17, &#34;My Moment of Un-Truth,&#34; the Janitor spends his time at work switching personas between himself and his fictional twin brother, Roscoe. Turk and JD never even entertain the idea, knowing full well that the Janitor is pulling one of his signature pranks. The act even involves interacting with Turk and JD as himself, then changing into his Roscoe disguise and leaping from the hospital window to beat them downstairs.Not one to be defeated, the Janitor then makes a thoroughly unconvincing video of him &#34;shaking hands&#34; with his &#34;twin.&#34; It may have taken almost three full seasons of Scrubs, but the episode marks one of the first times that JD is sure the Janitor is lying. Part of the failure of the Jantitor&#39;s ruse comes from him trying to supply evidence, whereas most of his deceptions come from baseless claims that can&#39;t really be disproved. If he&#39;d just dropped into conversation one day that he had a twin brother called Roscoe, JD probably would&#39;ve believed him.





 8  He Has Broken The Sound Barrier 
This lie came buried in a frenzied rant
        

In Scrubs season 7, episode 6, Carla encourages the Janitor to drop his facade and show his girlfriend, Lady, the real him. What follows is a slew of claims in Lady&#39;s direction, most of which are still probably false. The main takeaway from his ramblings is the statement, &#34;I have broken the sound barrier, but you must never ask me how.&#34; Seeing that the only way a human can exceed the speed of sound is in an advanced aircraft, it seems unlikely that the Janitor would ever find himself in such a situation.
            
 
 This Underrated Actor Had a 17-Year Run On TV Across 2 Different Shows 
Some actors may only enjoy a long run in a single TV series, but this actor managed to do it twice in a row, and both shows were a success.




 His demands not to be questioned on the matter imply he found another way to do so, but more plausibly, that he doesn&#39;t want his story to unravel. The Janitor has proven to be a creative man, developing devices such as the &#34;Knife-Wrench&#34; and &#34;Drill-Fork,&#34; but none of his inventions come anywhere close to the level of ingenuity required to allow him to break the sound barrier on his own.
The same rant had the Janitor claiming to be &#34;working on&#34; developing superpowers, and that he believes the moon is just the back of the sun. 






 7  He Performs Stand-Up Comedy Every Monday Morning 
&#34;I&#39;m at the Giggle Pit. Every Monday at sun-up.&#34;
        

Among his many supposed accomplishments, the Janitor claims in Scrubs season 5, episode 23, &#34;My Urologist,&#34; that he has a standing slot at a comedy club very first thing on a Monday morning. After breaking JD&#39;s pencil and claiming it to be a part of his stand-up routine, he delivers the information to Braff&#39;s character with his signature conviction. It seems highly unlikely that anyone would be willing to watch a live comedy routine at sunrise, but JD is briefly sucked in and suggests he may drop by to watch.The fact that JD is duped, even momentarily, shows how skilled the Janitor is at getting people to go along with his act - even those who are aware of his tricks. Had JD actually gone down the Giggle Pit at sun-up, should such a place even exist, he&#39;d likely have found it closed with nobody there. At this point in the show, all the main Scrubs characters have had dubious exchanges with the Janitor, and they&#39;re often still on the brink of being deceived each time.





 6  He Was In The &#34;Janitor Branch&#34; Of The Military 
JD let his new coat do the talking
        

Scrubs season 2, episode 5, &#34;My New Coat&#34; shows one of the first times JD refutes the Janitor&#39;s claims. After telling JD he served in the military, the Janitor comes under fire from the second-year Doctor. JD, fueled by the confidence imparted to him by his new white coat, pushes his adversary for details about his supposed service. Caught off-guard, the Janitor tries to improvise and says he was a member of the fictional &#34;Janitor Branch.&#34; The exchange suggests that the Janitor only scripts a certain amount of his lies, and can struggle to think on the fly.





 5  His Father Used A Nightstick To Train Cats 
The Janitor made this claim during a brief career change


 







Not all the Janitor&#39;s lies are about himself. Neil Flynn&#39;s character also mentions family members and the information is always inconsistent. The Janitor enjoys a spell as Sacred Heart&#39;s security guard in Scrubs season 3, episode 9, &#34;My Choosiest Choice of All,&#34; and his weapon of choice was apparently once owned and used by the Janitor&#39;s father. When Turk asks the understandable question of, &#34;Was he a cop?&#34;, the Janitor states that he was not. Instead, the Janitor claims his father used the nightstick to train cats. The tool seems far too brutal to be used to train cats in an official capacity - if such a job even exists.





 4  The Only Channels His TV Receives 
The package is far too specific to be true
        

It can be tricky to tell whether a lie from the Janitor is pre-planned or part of a reflexive instinct. This scene falls into the latter category, as he attempts to defend himself for being behind on current affairs. When JD berates the Janitor for his latent discovery of the identity of Deep Throat in Scrubs season 5, episode 4, &#34;My Jiggly Ball,&#34; the Janitor retorts by claiming his TV only gets, &#34;The Bible Channel, and some kinda Chinese Boxing.&#34; The bizarre lie is clearly an attempt to catch JD off-guard and end the line of questioning. Regardless, the Janitor&#39;s on-the-spot thinking leads to one of his most hilarious lies.





 3  He Has A Wife (With &#34;Pointer &amp; Thumb-Pinky&#34;) 
        

In Scrubs season 2, episode 21, &#34;My Drama Queen,&#34; the Janitor develops a strange obsession with making JD wear a custom pair of shorts apparently made by his wife. Donning his own pair, the Janitor is obviously the tailor in question. The Janitor&#39;s unusual ploy starts to fall apart when JD disposes of the shorts, only for them to be discovered by the Janitor. The real hilarity begins when the Janitor confronts JD. The Janitor not only sticks to his story regarding the shorts&#39; origin, but guilts JD into submission by adding to the tale and saying his &#34;wife&#34; lacks many fingers on each hand.





 2  That He Is In A Band Called Hibbleton 
It was a lie at the time that eventually came true


 







The Janitor can often lie without consequences, but there are scenarios where he has to deal with the fallout of not telling the truth. A shining example of this takes place during the events of Scrubs season 4, episode 13, &#34;My Ocardial Infarction.&#34; In one of his more earnest moments, the Janitor mistakes a coffee with Elliot for a date and arrives in a suit. Embarrassed, he later spins a yarn about having been dressed for rehearsal with his a cappella group, &#34;Hibbleton.&#34; After making claims of Hibbleton being the &#34;best hospital employee band in town,&#34; Ted&#39;s band overhears and challenges him for the title.
            
 
 Scrubs: 5 Times We Felt Bad For The Janitor (&amp; 5 Times We Hated Him) 
There is no doubt that Scrubs would not be such an incredible show without its characters. The Janitor is one character that draws a strong response.




 Although the existence of Hibbleton as a band was a fabrication at first, the Janitor was forced to bring his illusion to life to save face with Elliot. In true Janitor fashion, he fails upwards and stumbles into an impressive three-part harmony during the contest. Singing The Beach Boys&#39; &#34;Barabra Ann,&#34; the Janitor&#39;s new group wins the contest against Ted&#39;s band, showing that even the Janitor&#39;s riskiest lies tend to go his way in the end.





 1  The Janitor&#39;s Parents Adopted A 46-Year-Old Man 
Clete sounded like he would have been as unusual as his step-brother
        

The Janitor rarely adds such a detailed backstory to go along with one of his lies. In Scrubs season 5, episode 18, &#34;My New Suit,&#34; the Janitor runs interference for JD&#39;s brother, rattling off a very Janitor-esque story about growing up with a step-brother who was much older than he was at the time. The Janitor&#39;s fake sibling, Clete, was apparently even older than his parents, coming in at 46 years old. Clete is also said to have had physical altercations with the Janitor&#39;s father as a result of sleeping with his mother.The Janitor also has an impression of Clete armed and ready to add to the illusion. The overall anecdote is screamingly fictional but equally amusing. Neil Flynn is a talented improvisational actor, with Zach Braff claiming on his Fake Doctors, Real Friends podcast that Scrubs scripts would often just leave room for Flynn to ad-lib on the spot. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if this scene was a result of one of those instances. Either way, the fake story about Clete is the funniest of the Janitor&#39;s lies in Scrubs.
All nine seasons of Scrubs are available to stream on Hulu.
