## Literature Review
An update for Slow Horses season 5 confirms two surviving characters following the surprising death that was teased in the season 4 trailer.




An update for Slow Horses season 5 confirms two characters will survive following a season 4 tease. Based on the Slough House novels by Mick Herron, the spy thriller reveals what administrative purgatory is like for those who&#39;ve been rejected or downgraded from MI5. In the Slow Horses season 4 teaser following the season 3 finale, Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) casually reveals that one of his team members has died.




Along with a history-making Slow Horses season 5 renewal, the logline confirms that Lamb will return for that installment. But perhaps more surprisingly, via Variety, Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) is coming back as well. In addition, it&#39;s noted that Kristin Scott Thomas and Jack Lowden will be back in their respective roles as Diana Taverner and River Cartwright. Read the full logline below: 



“Everyone is suspicious when resident tech nerd Roddy Ho has a glamorous new girlfriend, but when a series of increasingly bizarre events occur across the city, it falls to the Slow Horses to work out how everything is connected. After all, Jackson Lamb knows that in the world of espionage, ‘London Rules’ should always apply.”




 What To Expect From Slow Horses Season 5 (&amp; Who Is At Risk?) 
          




Slow Horses season 5 will be based on the Mick Herron book London Rules. The logline reveals that Roddy will have a new glamorous girlfriend, which raises everyone&#39;s suspicions. Strange things also start to happen across the city, and it&#39;s up to the Slough Team to figure things out. The synopsis for the book offers additional context, mentioning a string of seemingly random terrorist attacks and the fact that everyone is trying to kill Ho.

It&#39;s unknown which team member dies in Slow Horses season 4, but it could be someone who&#39;s not directly connected to the Slough House set. Lamb doesn&#39;t seem especially upset by the death, mentioning it as more of a dry comment. But in any case, a lot could happen in the next two seasons. It&#39;s worth noting that Louisa (Rosalind Eleazar), Marcus (Kardiff Kirwan), and Shirley (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) are not mentioned in the cast list, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they will be killed off.

In general, however, Slow Horses hasn&#39;t been shy about saying goodbye to characters. House of the Dragon&#39;s Olivia Cooke was set up as an important character in the spy drama&#39;s debut year but was surprisingly set aside before season 1 even concluded. It seems that, other than Jackson Lamb himself, anyone is fair game.
