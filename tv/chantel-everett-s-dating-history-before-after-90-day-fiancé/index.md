## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé icon Chantel Everett is trying to find love again on 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. A look at her dating timeline on and off camera.




Chantel Everett has had an interesting dating life before her 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 debut as a newly divorced woman. Chantel is a 32-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia who has been a part of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise for several years since her debut in season 4 with Pedro Jimeno. They met through a mutual friend while Chantel wanted to learn Spanish and Pedro was a language tutor. Chantel continued meeting Pedro in the Dominican Republic before he came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa and got married within a few weeks in 2016.




Chantel and Pedro’s families were meddlesome and kept stirring up trouble in their relationship throughout their 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? and The Family Chantel appearances. Moreover, Chantel and Pedro also fought constantly over finances and had communication issues. Chantel’s family believed Pedro had married Chantel for a green card. Pedro and Chantel’s marriage eventually buckled under the pressure and Pedro filed for divorce in May 2022. Pedro accused Chantel of taking more than $200,000 from their joint bank account, while she accused Pedro of cheating and domestic violence. Chantel knew her future wasn’t going to be with Pedro. She’s now looking for a new companion.

 Chantel Took Pedro&#39;s Virginity At 23 
          




Chantel revealed a shocking secret about her relationship with Pedro on 90 Day Bares All in September 2021. Chantel didn’t realize that audiences didn’t know that Pedro was a virgin before meeting her. Shaun Robinson asked Chantel and Pedro, “How old was Pedro when he lost his virginity?” Chantel said 25, and Pedro replied 23. “Wait a second,” Chantel replied with confusion on her face. She soon realized her mistake when she added, “You know what is the reason that I said that is I think we got married at 25. It should have been 23. I know he was a virgin when I met him.”

“That never was revealed,” Pedro chimed in, which surprised Chantel. She eventually responded, “I thought everybody knew. Whoops!”



 Drake Showed Interest In Dating Chantel In 2022 
          




In August 2022, a source told Media Take Out that music artist Drake had reportedly been DMing the reality TV celebrity. Drake was supposedly pursuing Chantel since the news of her split with Pedro was revealed. As per the insider, Drake had “reached out” to Chantel to see how she was doing and where “her head was at.” Chantel had even responded to him. The insider also claimed that Drake and Chantel were DMing each other back and forth and were planning to meet up soon. In The Family Chantel season 5, Chantel confirmed a “famous Canadian rapper” showed interest in her.

Chantel revealed that there were some great guys including actors, football players, and basketball players, apart from the Canadian rapper who wanted to be in a relationship with her. However, Chantel had just come out of a full-fledged marriage of seven years and wasn’t emotionally available to jump into another relationship. In 90 Day: The Single Life, however, she is heading to Greece with her friends, six months after the divorce (via ET.) Chantel has been shown making out with a man in the trailer, but, she also freaks out when she realized he reminds her of Pedro. Pedro had also taken her on a bike ride on the island when they were dating.




Chantel’s social media at the moment doesn’t confirm if she is dating someone new. Chantel found herself stepping out of her comfort zone during the trip. She didn’t want to date anyone who would belittle her like Pedro and make her feel cherished. Chantel was looking for a successful man who would be generous and value commitment. 90 Day: The Single Life season 5 is just getting started and eventually, fans will find out if Chantel is in a relationship.
