  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The success of
Sons of Anarchy
was due in part to the iconic motorcycles ridden by SAMCRO members, which took center stage on the show.
The technical advisor, David Labrava, who served as a member of a real-life motorcycle club, helped make the
Sons of Anarchy
bikes more authentic and memorable.
Each character&rsquo;s bike had unique features and customization, reflecting their personality and storyline on the show.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The SAMCRO members in Sons of Anarchy own some seriously cool bikes, but none more so than these awesome ones!</p>
<p>The Sons Of Anarchy bikes ridden by members of SAMCRO were as much of a reason for the show&rsquo;s success as the action-packed story, and the best SOA motorcycles are some of the most iconic engines on two wheels to grace the small screen. The characters weren&rsquo;t the only stars of Sons of Anarchy, as it was impossible to ignore the SOA motorcycles since SAMCRO was a gang doubling as a motorcycle club. From 2008 to 2014, Sons of Anarchy followed SAMCRO, a motorcycle club bonded together by an oath, and through it all their unique — and often heavily customized — motorcycles took center stage on the show.
The reason the Sons of Anarchy bikes were so memorable, rather than just being generic vehicles, is that David Labrava — a real-life ex-motorcycle club member — served as a technical advisor on the show (via The Blast). He also starred as SAMCRO&rsquo;s Sergeant-at-Arms Happy Lowman. It also helped that many of the show&rsquo;s stars rode motorcycles long before appearing on the show, and their love for bikes shined through the series. SOA was, of course, popular thanks to its incredible cast and gripping drama, but the Sons of Anarchy motorcycles were the crowning glory of the show&rsquo;s aesthetic and authenticity.

<p>10  Harley-Davidson Electra Tri-Glide
Piermont &lsquo;Piney&rsquo; Winston</p>
<p>As one of SAMCRO&rsquo;s founding members, the First 9, age was catching up with Piney. His health was failing him, and he no longer had the strength to ride a two-wheel bike as well as he did during his younger years. Determined to still hit the highways, his Sons of Anarchy bike was impossible to miss. A notably unique feature of Piney&rsquo;s Harley-Davidson Electra Tri-Glidekept was that it had three wheels. It also had a special holster at the back that held a canister full of oxygen that he needed to keep himself healthy — the mandatory Grim Reaper image on the gas tank, of course.
Harley-Davidson began producing the Tri-Glode all the way back in 1932, while the Electra-Glide went into production in 1965. The Electra Tri-Glide went into production in 2008. Even with the three wheels, this was still a fast SOA bike, with a top speed of around 100 mph. It also isn&rsquo;t cheap, with J.D. Powerlisting the bike at $36,949.</p>
<p>9  2008 Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide
Clarence &lsquo;Clay&rsquo; Morrow</p>
<p>As the first SAMCRO president on the show, Clay had the club&rsquo;s Reaper logo displayed on his bike in a larger size than the rest of the members. The bike was similar to a couple of others on the show, but its glossy black polish and roaring sound made it hard to ignore. Interestingly, actor Ron Perlman, who portrayed Clay, doesn&rsquo;t actually like bikes. He once shared a photo of himself with his fellow cast members on top of bikes and captioned it: &ldquo;I have to admit, I look pretty bad a** on a bike. Pretty sexy. Pretty gangsta. I also gotta admit, bikes don’t like me. And it’s mutual.&rdquo;
This is just one of many of these Sons of Anarchy bikes, but Clay upgraded his with a new chassis and six-speed transmission, and this version paid tribute to the 1971 Super Glide motorcycle. It has a top speed of 105.63 mph and is only worth about $13,650 according to J.D. Power.</p>
<p>20 Biker Movies To Watch If You Like Sons Of Anarchy
From classics like Easy Rider to modern greats like The Motorcycle Diaries, here are 15 essential biker movies for Sons of Anarchy fans.</p>
<p>8  2006 Harley-Davidson Dyna Street Bob
Alexander &ldquo;Tig&rdquo; Trager</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a miracle that Tig survived until the end of Sons of Anarchy, given that he was such a violent daredevil. But in general, he was a funny character who preferred moving around in a 2006 Harley-Davidson Dyna Street Bob. He had a memorable scene on the bike when he dragged the police through Charming to distract them so that other SAMCRO members could board a plane to Belfast. Tig&rsquo;s Sons of Anarchy motorcyle was different in that it had a couple of spikes and skulls scattered around it. It was also pretty fast as during every chase scene involving the whole crew, it was close to the front line.
Tig&rsquo;s Dyna was one of the fastest of the Sons of Anarchy bikes, hitting a top speed of 115 mph with a quarter-mile acceleration of 13.5 seconds. This 2006 motorcycle now sells for around $13,480 (via J.D. Power).</p>
<p>7  Panhead
Harry &lsquo;Opie&rsquo; Winston</p>
<p>Another classic bike on Sons of Anarchy was the Panhead, which Opie spent much time in the garage trying to restore. Even though he had a Harley, his desire was to get the Panhead up and going just so he could ride around Charming like it was the &rsquo;60s. Like JT&rsquo;s bike, the Panhead was also blue. Given that Opie&rsquo;s father Piney was one of the First 9, the bike must have belonged to him. As a kid, Opie must have fallen in love with the bike as he watched his dad ride around in it. Sadly, Opie was killed by Pope&rsquo;s goons in prison before he could ever enjoy the Panhead.
The Panhead itself went into production during the economic boom after World War II. It has a two-cylinder, four-valve push-rod V-twin engine, and if Opie had finished the restoration, it could have reached a top speed of 100 mph with a horsepower range between 50 and 55. The bikes were produced between 1948 and 1965 and their current worth is as high as $52,250 (via HotCars).</p>
<p>6  FXDB Street Bob
Happy Lowman</p>
<p>Happy spoke less than 10 times in the entirety of Sons of Anarchy. He preferred doing to talking and even managed to establish himself as one of the SACMRO members with the highest kill counts. He also rode the same bike from the first to the final season, which was the 2011 FXDB Street Bob. The bike was a single-seater, meaning Happy couldn&rsquo;t carry anyone around the way Jax liked doing. Happy&rsquo;s FXD was sold at an auction in 2012, with the proceeds going to a charity home. The top speed on these Sons of Anarchy bikes is about 115 mph and the cost is around $13,574 (via J.D. Power).</p>
<p>5  Harley-Davidson Screamin&rsquo; Eagle Road Glide
T.O. Cross</p>
<p>T.O. made history as the first African American person to be patched into SAMCRO after Jax abolished the &ldquo;Whites Only&rdquo; rule. The former president of the Grim Bastards had one of the coolest bikes on the show. T.O.&rsquo;s Sons of Anarchy bike was orange and black, which made it look fashionable rather than gang-related. The orange was a nod to the official colors of the Grim Bastards. The Screamin&rsquo; Eagle also had twin headlights as opposed to the single headlights seen on the rest of the bikes. This is one of the most expensive Sons of Anarchy bikes, at around $27,995, and hits a top speed of an incredible 180 mph (via Motorcyclist Online).</p>
<p>All 7 Sons Of Anarchy Seasons, Ranked Worst To Best
Sons of Anarchy is one of television&rsquo;s most successful shows, having lasted for many years, yet some seasons of the show were better than others.</p>
<p>4  Custom Harley-Davidson Dyna Street Bob
Filip &lsquo;Chibs&rsquo; Telford</p>
<p>A few SAMCRO members had the Harley-Davidson Dyna Street Bob, but the one Chibs rode stood out because there was no front fairing on it. It also had matte black Z-bars coupled with risers. A Saint Andrew&rsquo;s cross could also be seen on the saddle, in memory of his ties to the IRA. Chibs was one of the most likable characters on the show and, after suffering too much at the hands of Irish gangster Jimmy O, it was great to see him become SAMCRO president by the time the Sons of Anarchy finale arrived. Chib&rsquo;s Harley-Davidson Dyna Street Bob had a top speed of about 107.5 mph. First manufactured in 1991, J.D. Power lists it for around $15.549.</p>
<p>3  1946 Harley-Davidson Knucklehead
John Teller</p>
<p>Jax&rsquo;s father and SAMCRO founder John Teller, aka JT, had already died by the time the series started, but his bike was a big part of the show&rsquo;s storyline. Teller&rsquo;s bike, which was preserved at the Clubhouse, is said to have been the one he was riding when he was involved in the accident that killed him. After the accident, the bike was repaired and preserved. Sadly, it was destroyed again when the Clubhouse was bombed. JT&rsquo;s bike was cool because it was one of two bikes that were classics in the series. It reminded viewers of the post-World War II era.
This Sons of Anarchy bike was a 1946 Harley-Davidson Knucklehead that the show had to rent to use, such is its rarity. This Knucklehead was a street bike, and there were only 3,986 Knucklehead models produced by Harley that year (via Classic Driver). Despite its age, this was a fast bike, with a top speed close to 100mph thanks to its engine, which was 40bhp in high-compression &lsquo;EL&rsquo; form. According to JD Power, the bike is now worth $60,475, in excellent condition.</p>
<p>2  2003 Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide Sport
Jax Teller</p>
<p>Jax&rsquo;s bike was so attractive that a stranger decided to take a picture next to it with his girlfriend. Sadly, he hadn&rsquo;t asked for permission at first, so Jax responded aggressively by assaulting the man and riding away with his girlfriend. The 2003 Harley-Davidson Dyna Super Glide Sport was different from the other bikes in that it had custom T-bars for better handling. Interestingly, actor Charlie Hunnam loves bikes in real life too, and he owns the same type of bike he rode for the seven seasons of the show.
Jax&rsquo;s Super Glide Sport is tricked out, with a V-Twin with a displacement of 1499cc. This allowed him to ride fast and keep control, while he also tricked it out visually with the updated handlebars and better suspension and disc brakes. He also went out like his dad, driving his Sons of Anarchy bike into an oncoming truck. The top speed on Jax&rsquo;s bike is 105.63 mph and its current worth is between $14,000 and $17,000 (via J.D. Power).</p>
<p>8 Ways Charlie Hunnam&rsquo;s Jax Can Return In Sons Of Anarchy&rsquo;s New Project
Charlie Hunnam&rsquo;s character Jax Teller could return for a new Sons of Anarchy project despite his character&rsquo;s definite ending in the original series.</p>
<p>1  Custom Chopper
Robert &lsquo;Bobby Elvis&rsquo; Munson</p>
<p>Apart from the time he slept with Otto&rsquo;s wife, Bobby generally didn&rsquo;t do much to get on the wrong side of viewers. During the show&rsquo;s run, he owned three different bikes, but the first one was his best. During his Elvis days, he rode around in a custom chopper that he had built from scratch. The bike which was constructed on a hard-tail frame had mini ape hangers as well a springer seat. The front springer forks on the bike had been raked to give the perfect chopper appearance. Like Chib&rsquo;s Harley, Bobby&rsquo;s bike also didn&rsquo;t have front fairings. Unlike other Sons of Anarchy bikes, this was custom-made and can&rsquo;t be purchased from a dealer.</p>
<p>Sons of Anarchy
Sons of Anarchy, created by Kurt Sutter, follows a notorious outlaw motorcycle club, the Sons of Anarchy, as they confront drug dealers, corporate developers, and law enforcement to protect their livelihoods and their hometown of Charming, CA. Loosely based on William Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; Sons of Anarchy explores what happens when the seduction of money and power comes between family. The show follows the Teller and Morrow family legacies, with Jackson &lsquo;Jax&rsquo; Teller handling his duties as the V.P. of the club while dealing with the new president - his stepfather - Clay Morrow.
