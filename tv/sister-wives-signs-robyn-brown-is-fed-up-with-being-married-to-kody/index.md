## Literature Review
Robyn Brown doesn’t appear to enjoy her new monogamous marriage with Kody Brown. The Sister Wives cast member seems repulsed by her husband.




Robyn Brown from Sister Wives may be tired of her new monogamous marriage with Kody Brown already. The 45-year-old Arizona resident was once extremely hopeful for her life with the polygamous man. She had been in an unsuccessful monogamous relationship before and wanted to try out plural marriage. Robyn joined the Brown family in 2010 when she spiritually married Kody. She felt right at home with her other Sister Wives, Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown, who welcomed her into their household with open hearts. Unfortunately, things didn’t remain as warm and harmonious for long.




In 2014, Kody legally divorced his first wife, Meri, to make Robyn his legal life. He did it to adopt Robyn’s three kids from her previous marriage and because he didn’t care for Meri anymore. In the following years, Kody grew more distant from his other wives and chose to spend most of his time with Robyn. At the same time, Robyn felt more awkward about the circumstances as she could see her polygamous paradise break apart. Between 2021 and 2023, Christine, Janelle, and Meri finally quit the plural marriage, forcing Robyn to handle Kody alone. The expected change shook up the Brown family to its core.

 Robyn Seems Emotionally Drained Due To Kody’s Tantrums 
         




Robyn always wanted polygamy and felt “very angry and very depressed” after the other Sister Wives left her. She’s now in a monogamous relationship with Kody and getting fed up with her new reality. One sign that proves Robyn isn’t too happy with monogamy is how emotionally drained she has become over the last few months. Viewers may know that Kody loves to throw a fit. Previously, he had four wives to deal with his over-the-top behavior, and they could barely even manage him. Now, there’s only Robyn, and she’s already miserable due to Kody’s tantrums.

 Robyn Has To Keep Kody’s Temper In Check 
         




Kody’s bloated temper has also been getting on Robyn’s nerves lately. When the mom of five married the polygamous man, she fell in love with his personality. Kody’s enthusiasm for growing his family, patriarchal energy, and assertive nature resonated with Robyn’s passive and subservient lifestyle. Unfortunately, things changed when Christine left Kody in 2021, leaving him disgruntled with his situation and salivating with the thirst for revenge.



Janelle and Meri’s exit in 2023 worsened Kody’s mental state. He became a shell of the man he once was and extremely bitter about everything.




Over the years, Robyn has been the only person keeping Kody’s temper in check. She has put a lot of effort into ensuring that her husband didn’t say or do something that would cost him. However, she’s tired of this new controlling role and trying to stabilize everything. In the couple’s recent appearance on Sister Wives Talk Back, Robyn had to physically shut Kody’s mouth with her hands when he almost blew up on a fan congratulating him on his new monogamous relationship. Robyn was visibly upset at Kody for not thinking twice before spreading negativity into a situation that was already very sad.

 Robyn Calls Herself Kody’s Whipping Boy 
         

Robyn has cried a lot since Meri, Janelle, and Christine left the family. The emotional woman has felt trapped in a world war, where the Sister Wives have used her as a “scapegoat” for Kody’s actions. When Robyn came into the family, she adored “the culture” of polygamy and was happy to put her all into making things work. While she wasn’t the most perfect polygamist, she did her best to appease everyone and be friends with her Sister Wives. However, the feelings were never mutual. Meri, Janelle, and Christine became jealous of Robyn due to Kody’s favoritism towards her.




When Christine left Kody, she indirectly blamed Robyn by calling her Kody’s soulmate. Janelle and Meri also followed suit, using Robyn’s strong bond with Kody as the ultimate cause of their divorces. Recently, Robyn filmed Sister Wives One on One, where she talked about feeling like “Kody’s whipping boy.” She admitted that she wasn’t too happy about taking the blame for how her husband’s other relationships ended. She said, “maybe I’m an easy target because I have a tendency to just take it and not get jerky about it.”



 Robyn Doesn’t Feel Superior Anymore 
          

Robyn probably feels unhappy with Kody because she’s no longer in a position of power. She was her husband’s favorite wife for over ten years. She felt like the queen matriarch of the family and superior to everyone else. However, Meri, Christine, and Janelle’s exit has left Robyn feeling like a regular wife. She can no longer look down on anyone because there’s no one left. Robyn’s relentless demand for polygamy suggests that she wants another woman in the family, so she can dominate her by keeping Kody wrapped around her fingers.






 Robyn Looks Miserable When Kody Vents About Meri, Janelle, &amp; Christine 
          

Robyn is just tired of the whole three-year-long family breakup. Usually, people who divorce invest a few months of their time and get it over with. They want to move on to bigger and better things. However, Robyn has been stuck with Kody and his three divorces for far too long. She has had to talk a lot about the demise of her plural marriage being part of such a popular reality TV show. She is exhausted from crying, thinking, and answering questions, not being able to bandage her wounds.

Robyn needs time and peace to heal from the harsh reality. However, Kody’s behavior and Sister Wives’ comments aren’t letting her rest. She is tired of listening to Kody vent about his ex-wives. She’s heartbroken to see the women she considered her sisters accuse and blame her on TV. Robyn is on the verge of an emotional breakdown and holding back. Kody will have to step away from the limelight if he wants to save his last remaining marriage. The Sister Wives cast member has to stop discussing his breakups and focus on his future.
