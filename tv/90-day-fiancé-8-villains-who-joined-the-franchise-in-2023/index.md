## Literature Review
The 90 Day Fiancé franchise was bursting with content in 2023, but among the new couples were a number of outrageous new franchise villains. 




The past year has delivered an explosion of 90 Day Fiancé franchise content, which has introduced several shocking and shameless new villains to the popular reality TV show franchise. While long-standing franchise villains, including Big Ed Brown and Angela Deem, somehow still received another reality TV show to act out on, many new couples were also introduced to viewers. This led to the introduction of numerous new 90 Day Fiancé franchise villains for 2023.
The extended 90 Day Fiancé franchise featured returning cast members and many new faces over the past season. 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way seasons 4 and 5 aired back-to-back with many international romances that saw Americans traveling across the globe for love. Meanwhile, 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 recently concluded, while 90 Day Fiancé season 10 is currently airing. These four franchise seasons, in particular, introduced a host of new villains to viewers. Both women and men earned the title of 2023 franchise newcomer villains, while more American cast members acted out as opposed to the foreign cast members.









 








 8  Kris Foster Was A Liar 
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Season 4


 







Kris Foster and Jeymi Noguera appeared on The Other Way season 4 when eccentric Kris came to Colombia to marry Jeymi. At first, the women depicted what promised to be a loving same-sex romance, as they both realized they were attracted to women and wanted to be together. However, the messy relationship unraveled after marriage. Kris returned to the U.S. and left a tearful Jeymi behind while she fed her wife many lies. She also revealed serious concealed ailments, including a neck injury. Kris went so far as to shove Jeymi in a heated fight before dismissing her at the explosive Tell All.





 7  Mahmoud El Sherbiny Was Controlling 
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Season 4
        

Mahmoud El Sherbiny and Nicole Sherbiny also appeared on The Other Way season 4 in a very dramatic plot line in Egypt. Nicole, who&#39;s from the U.S., was beyond miserable in Egypt, as Mahmoud expected her to live a conservative lifestyle that isolated her from any friends or freedom. It was then revealed he was still chatting with other women despite how much he tried to control Nicole. Mahmoud made Nicole&#39;s life in Egypt a nightmare, though she also chose to return to their broken marriage, knowing what she was getting herself into. Mahmoud projected his insecurities onto Nicole, while the two were simply too different to get along.





 6  Amanda Wilhelm Acted Out 
90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Season 6
        

Amanda Wilhelm and Razvan Ciocoi took viewers to Romania during 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Amanda was a more straightforward franchise villain, as she was simply cruel and earned the title of one of the biggest villains from the season. The recent widow was accused of talking to Razvan while her husband was dying of cancer; Amanda&#39;s violent past was also uncovered. She was consistently mean to Razvan and even made him cry on multiple occasions. Overall, Amanda came across as immature and unpleasant to watch.





 5  Christian Allgood Was Pure Cringe 
90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Season 6


 







Christian Allgood and Cleo Corraine are another couple from Before the 90 Days season 6. Unlike Amanda, Christian did not come across as mean. However, he was accused by many viewers of being cringe-worthy and creepy. Christian would come on to women, though he insisted he was just being friendly. This behavior made Cleo, who becomes overstimulated easily, feel overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Christian repeatedly denied that he was creepy and instead considered himself to be a &#34;ladies&#39; man.&#34; It&#39;s currently unclear if Cleo took Christian back after their recent split.





 4  Mary Demasu-ay Was A Nightmare 
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Season 5
        

Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay depicted a headache of a relationship during The Other Way season 5. Mary was by far the biggest villain of the first half of the season, as she demanded Brandan FaceTime her 24/7. Mary has serious attachment, security, and jealousy issues that manifested into controlling behavior. While Brandan was also needy, controlling, and lazy, Mary took things to a shocking extreme. Surprisingly, the couple did tie the knot, and now Brandan and Mary are parents to their daughter, Midnight.





 3  Sarper Güven Is Demanding 
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Season 5


Sarper Güven and Shekinah Garner, another The Other Way season 5 pair, arrived late to the season but nonetheless made a splash onscreen. Sarper clearly was still learning English, though he managed to be consistently sexist and offensive. He controls all aspects of Shekinah&#39;s life, including what she eats and how much she weighs. The franchise newcomer effectively isolated Shekinah from her family. Though Shekinah insists she wants to be controlled, Sarper even slapped her lollipop out of her hand in one confrontation. And, of course, he consistently boasts about sleeping with over 2,500 women.





 2  Clayton Clark Is Demanding 
90 Day Fiancé Season 10
        

Clayton Clark and Anali Vallejos are cast members on 90 Day Fiancé season 10. While Clayton, an American citizen, did learn Spanish for Anali, he refuses to respect his partner&#39;s boundaries. It&#39;s clear that Anali is homesick for Peru and overwhelmed by Clayton&#39;s cramped and filthy home. Clayton keeps pressuring Anali into having sex and becomes frustrated when she refuses. He even brought this up in public to his friend and their waitress in a scene that humiliated Anali. Clayton needs to clean up his apartment and learn to respect boundaries, or he could lose Anali.





 1  Rob Warne Is A Cheater 
90 Day Fiancé Season 10
        

Rob Warne, who&#39;s in a relationship with Sophie Sierra, is currently the biggest villain of 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Rob will likely be remembered as an 90 Day Fiancé franchise villain for the way he behaves. Rob berated and demeaned Sophie for wanting a normal living situation, such as a bathroom inside an apartment. He reacted oddly to Sophie saying she was bisexual and tried to use it as an excuse to sleep around. Meanwhile, Rob cheated on Sophie multiple times by receiving naked photos despite knowing how much it hurt her. It&#39;s clear 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Rob has no respect for Sophie and a serious attitude problem.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
