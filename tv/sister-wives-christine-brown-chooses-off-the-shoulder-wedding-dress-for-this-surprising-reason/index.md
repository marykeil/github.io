## Literature Review
Sister Wives Christine Brown shared her wedding dress in a preview of her two-part special, revealing the sweet reason she wanted her shoulders out.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown revealed her sweet reasons for wanting an off-the-shoulder dress during her wedding to David Woolley, which was documented for a two-part special premiering soon. Christine and David&#39;s October 2023 wedding was a personal affair, which left many believing they wouldn&#39;t choose to share the event with the rest of the world. Fortunately for Sister Wives season 18 fans, Christine and David&#39;s wedding will be shown in a two-part special that documents the most incredible day of their lives. The special will invite those who have been on Christine&#39;s journey with her throughout Sister Wives to see her marry the love of her life.




In an exclusive with In Touch Weekly, Christine shared that she chose an off-the-shoulder wedding gown for a very sweet, special reason. &#34;There was four or five different dresses that I really liked, different parts of it. I wanted the deep plunge. I wanted off the shoulder a bit to show my tattoo a little bit,&#34; the bride explained. &#34;That was a big deal.&#34; Christine, who was married to Kody Brown for nearly 30 years, shared that she wanted to show off the matching tattoo she has with David in her dress, ensuring her friends and family could see it.

 What To Expect From Christine &amp; Davidâ€™s Sister Wives Wedding 
          




According to Christine&#39;s interview, she&#39;s thrilled for fans to see her finally finding her place in the upcoming Sister Wives wedding special. &#34;I remember looking over at David and then instantly I just calmed right down and everything became really, really, really peaceful,&#34; Christine explained. &#34;And as soon as I turned the corner and there it was like, this is where I belong. This is it. This is where I fit.&#34; Christine and David&#39;s family surrounded them with love on their wedding day, ensuring it was as beautiful and peaceful as possible. Christine and Kody never had a true wedding ceremony, so ensuring it was special was a top priority.


 

Christine and David have shared their love story on Sister Wives: One On One, but those who watch Sister Wives season 18 still have yet to see Christine meet her new husband on the series, so the two-part wedding special may need to do some legwork to get the backstory on their relationship. While Christine was still uncertain about dating during the Sister Wives season 18 season finale, she came around quickly when she met David through a matchmaker she&#39;d hired. Christine and David&#39;s relationship moved quickly, but both seemed to know that they were it for each other and decided not to waste any time.




While Christine and David&#39;s wedding special may be the last fans see of the Brown family until Sister Wives season 19, the two-part episode will be nothing short of emotional. Christine, who stood up for herself and chose to leave Kody in one of the most difficult moments of her life, has been praised by fans for her courage and honesty. Seeing her finally able to marry someone who seems to be supportive, sweet, and head over heels in love with her will be an exciting event for Sister Wives fans.
