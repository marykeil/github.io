 10  Rebecca &amp; Jack Lose The Baby 
Season 1, Episode 1 - &#34;Pilot&#34;
        

This Is Us digs into the grief of losing someone long before Jack or Rebecca die. In fact, This Is Us&#39; pilot sees the couple losing one of their triplets during childbirth, the very event that prompts them to adopt Randall. But even having three newborns to care for doesn&#39;t ease the pain of Rebecca and Jack&#39;s loss, which is palpable during the first installment. After all the anxiety surrounding Rebecca&#39;s high-risk birth, Jack&#39;s insistence that everything will work out gets turned on its head. Milo Ventimiglia&#39;s performance as Jack learns of the third baby&#39;s fate is heartbreaking, and it&#39;s enough to bring on the waterworks every time.





 9  William Dying Of Cancer 
Season 1, Episode 16 - &#34;Memphis&#34;
        

This Is Us season 1 sees Randall tracking down his biological father and getting to know him. Unfortunately, their relationship is short-lived, as William dies of cancer not long after. This is heartbreaking, especially knowing that Randall will lose his adopted father at some point in the show. And William&#39;s admission that he&#39;s afraid to die makes this moment hit even harder, evoking sympathy for him and his son. Randall and William&#39;s final moment together is easily one of This Is Us&#39; saddest moments — and one of the most likely to make viewers cry.





 8  Kevin Comforting Randall During His Breakdown 
Season 1, Episode 15 - &#34;Jack Pearson&#39;s Son&#34;
        

Many of This Is Us&#39; most heartbreaking moments revolve around a character&#39;s death, but the season 1 scene that sees the weight of Randall&#39;s problems hitting him all at once is a tearjerker for different reasons. While William&#39;s terminal illness contributes to this breakdown, Randall also faces an overwhelming amount of anxiety surrounding his marriage and career. Most viewers have been there in some capacity, so seeing Randall cry it all out is both cathartic and emotional. Kevin running to his brother&#39;s side is the cherry on top of the cake, and it&#39;s so heartwarming that viewers might cry happy tears, too.

Season 1, Episode 5 - &#34;The Game Plan&#34;

The scene runs parallel to a past storyline of Rebecca and Jack deciding to have kids. And that makes it even more tragic when Kate pulls out Jack&#39;s urn, which she typically watches the game with.

Deja&#39;s departure, during which she says farewell to the family she&#39;s come to love, is hard to watch. While it&#39;s a positive moment for her character, it&#39;s also a heartbreaking one for the other characters. Sterling K.
