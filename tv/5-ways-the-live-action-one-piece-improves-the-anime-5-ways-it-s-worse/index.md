# 5 Ways The Live-Action One Piece Improves The Anime (&amp; 5 Ways It s Worse)


## SUMMARY 


 One Piece season 1 is perhaps the most successful live-action anime adaptation ever created, improving on previous Netflix attempts. 
 The live-action show condenses the slow pacing of the anime, making it more accessible to new audiences. It also improves some other aspects, such as how the live-action version of Sanji tones down his gimmick, creating a better and more balanced character. 
 Other aspects, such as the fight scenes, are much better in the anime.

## Literature Review
While One Piece season 1 gets a lot of things right about the anime, some aspects of Netflix’s live-action adaptation could have been better.




Netflix’s One Piece season 1 is arguably the most successful live-action anime adaptation ever made, and while there are multiple ways in which the source material is better, there are also ways in which the remake improves the original show. After a negative string of Netflix live-action anime movies and shows, including but not limited to Death Note and Cowboy Bebop, it seemed unlikely that One Piece was going to be the property to break the “adaptation curse.” Surprisingly, not only was One Piece better than Netflix’s previous attempts at live-action anime, but it was also a great show on its own that did Eiichiro Oda’s story justice.
One Piece season 2 is happening, and some of the most iconic moments in the anime series are yet to come. Fortunately, the quality of season 1 suggests that the Arabasta saga will make for a fantastic second season. One Piece season 1’s finale saw the Straw Hat pirates heading into the Grand Line and concluded Netflix’s version of the East Blue saga after some highs and lows.



 10  The Pacing Of One Piece’s East Blue Saga 
The Live-Action Does It Better


One Piece’s earlier episodes have very slow pacing that can make it difficult for new audiences to get into the show. From filler segments added in the middle of important episodes to flashbacks and dialogues that take way too long, watching long-form anime from the late 1990s/early 2000s can be very frustrating. One Piece itself acknowledged that when it released the Episode of East Blue movie, which condensed the East Blue saga into a 2-hour film. The live-action One Piece show achieved something similar, covering the entirety of East Blue in eight hour-long episodes that summarize most of the important events.





 9  Garp’s Role In The Story 
The anime does it better
        

From a storytelling standpoint, it makes sense to have Garp as the overall antagonist for One Piece season 1. In the source material, each of the East Blue arcs stands on its own, whereas in the live-action, everything needed to feel part of a bigger story. Without a proper big bad who could serve as the villain throughout all eight episodes, Netflix’s One Piece decided to bring Garp much earlier compared to the anime and make him the biggest threat to Luffy and the Straw Hat pirates. Still, considering that the Garp reveal only happens after Enies Lobby in the manga, revealing Luffy’s family during East Blue makes it less impactful.




 8  One Piece’s Accessibility To Non-Anime Fans

One Piece is rarely mentioned in lists of “first anime for non-anime fans,” as it features a very fantastical universe whose world-building and power levels can be difficult to keep track of. For someone who is not familiar with shonen tropes or anime in general, getting into One Piece can be difficult. The live-action One Piece solves that problem by combining the incredible world created by Eiichiro Oda with more traditional storytelling for the American TV format, offering something that is both a great anime adaptation and an entertaining show at the same time. Netflix’s One Piece makes the story more digestible without losing what makes it so special.



 7  One Piece’s Fight Scenes 
The Anime Does It Better
        

Nailing the fight scenes is one of the most important aspects of any anime adaptation, especially when it comes to stories like Dragon Ball Z or One Piece. While the live-action One Piece series delivers good fights that do the source material justice and feel like part of that world, they are not as good as the ones in the anime. Comparing two different mediums is tricky, but overall, none of the live-action One Piece fights could match the energy of the anime. Everything feels slower and more choreographed on the Netflix show, even when compared to other live-action adaptations like Yu Yu Hakusho.

 6  Sanji’s Gimmick

Although Sanji’s gimmick is nothing new in the world of anime, it gets boring and repetitive pretty quickly in the source material. Over a thousand chapters and episodes later, it is clear that Sanji would have been a much better character if his “nose bleeding” gimmick had been toned down at some point. Fortunately, Netflix’s One Piece incorporated that criticism and delivered an arguably perfect version of what Sanji should be. The character’s essence was still there – he was flirting with Nami and Nojiko all the time – yet it is never too exaggerated. One Piece season 1 seems to have found the correct balance for Sanji the anime never did.


 5  Shanks Sacrificing His Arm To Save Luffy 
The Anime Does It Better
        

The relationship between Luffy and Sanji is one of the pillars of One Piece’s story, and it all traces back to when the Red-Haired pirate lost his arm while saving Luffy from a sea king creature. Although the scene plays out quite similarly in the live-action compared to the source material, some small details make the anime version much better. For example, in the Netflix series, Shanks shows up on a boat, which removes a little from the heroism of the character swimming to save Luffy and even creates the false impression he is a devil fruit eater who cannot swim.





 4  The Introduction Of Major Plays Like Buggy &amp; Mihawk

The East Blue saga introduces quite a few characters that, despite not seeming that important at first, play major roles in other portions of the story. For example, Buggy is initially depicted as a “one-arc villain,” but he remains a key part of the One Piece universe to this day. Bringing iconic characters like Mihawk and Buggy the Clown to live-action is not easy, but the live-action series nailed both of them. They never feel bigger than what they should be at this point, yet they make strong first impressions that make audiences want more. Hopefully, other characters who have yet to debut will get a similar treatment.



 3  Luffy’s Characterization 
The Anime Does It Better


Iñaki Godoy is an incredible Luffy, and it is now impossible to imagine any other actor in the role. That said, Luffy is one of the most iconic characters of all time, and the live-action version of the pirate in a straw hat does not quite match how he is portrayed in the source material. Luffy is a cartoonish character by default, which means he is a larger-than-life protagonist whose personality and manners are almost impossible to translate to other media. Live-action Luffy feels smarter and more mature than anime Luffy, which makes sense given the different formats, but it is a significant difference regardless.

 2  Koby And Helmeppo’s Adventures 
The Live-Action Does It Better
        

Koby and Helmeppo’s adventures got their own miniseries in the manga in the form of cover-page stories, most of which were only covered much later in the anime. Interestingly, by showing the beginning of Koby and Helmeppo’s career at the Marine and their relationship with Garp right away, One Piece season 1 did a more accurate adaptation of Diary of Koby-Meppo in terms of timeline than the anime did. The live-action series begins to follow Koby and Helmeppo’s first few days as Marines as soon as Garp meets them in Orange Town. As a result, two small characters who only return much later in the anime became more interesting.



 1  Nami’s Backstory &amp; Her Relationship With The Village 
The Anime Does It Better
        

Nami’s backstory is an essential part of the character, and it is impossible to discuss the East Blue version of Nami without thinking of her past. Although much of the Arlong Park scenes matched the source material, some significant changes were made to the story. This includes how, in the live-action One Piece show, neither Nojiko nor Genzo knew why Nami was working for Arlong. It is unclear why such an important detail was changed, especially because it completely changes the relationship between Nami and the family she had left. The live-action also does not spend a lot of time with Nojko and Genzo, making the Arlong Park segment less impactful.
