## Literature Review
The Bachelor season 28 women prove that they have what it takes to win Joey Graziadei&#39;s heart by sharing the most romantic thing they&#39;ve ever done.




The Bachelor season 28 women will have a lot of competition, as there are 32 women competing for Joey Graziadei&#39;s heart, but a few of them proved that they have what it takes by sharing the most romantic thing they&#39;ve ever done. Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro, got his start as the runner-up on Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season. Although he left with a broken heart when she chose Dotun Olubeko over him and got engaged, Joey was happy to accept the role of the Bachelor.




In hand-written notes submitted to Bachelor Nation, six of Joey&#39;s Bachelor season 28 women revealed the most romantic thing they&#39;ve ever done. Starr Sklyer, 25, wrote that she hand-drew all of her and her boyfriend&#39;s memories on a giant card. Sam Washington, 25, said that, for most summers of her childhood, she lived in Puerto Rico. She took her boyfriend at the time to visit the places she loved as a child. They went for hikes, had sunset beach dates, and enjoyed the best parts of &#34;my favorite island.&#34; Marlena Haddad, 26, shared that she had her and boyfriend&#39;s names engraved on the exact bottle of wine that they had on their first date.

Natalie Crepeau, 25, revealed that she once made an Easter egg hunt for her boyfriend, with &#34;cute little clues.&#34; She made him hop around like a bunny while participating in it. Rachel Nance, 26, wrote that she planned a get-away weekend and cooked a homemade meal for her boyfriend. The meal was his mom&#39;s recipe, and she taught Rachel how to make it. Rachel&#39;s boyfriend was very surprised. Erika Cardenas, 25, once made a scrapbook for her boyfriend, with all of their pictures together and &#34;all the little trinkets we collected,&#34; such as movie tickets and museum pamphlets. She wrote, &#34;It was a time capsule of our relationship!&#34;


 

The Bachelor season 28 women seem to be very romantic, which is perfect, because Joey is also the same way. He proved during Charity&#39;s season that he was sensitive and thoughtful, always putting Charity first in every situation and opening up to her. One of Joey&#39;s sweetest moments was when he shared the letters that his grandfather wrote to him before he passed away. He would certainly appreciate any of the gestures made by his new set of women if they were to do something like that for him.




The Bachelor season 28 will be a beautiful journey, as Joey is ready to find his wife. With romantic women such as Starr, Sam, Marlena, Natalie, Rachel, and Erika competing for his heart, he&#39;s sure to find what he&#39;s looking for. Joey&#39;s following in the footsteps of Zach Shallcross, who got engaged to Kaity Biggar during The Bachelor season 27. A year later, the couple is still going strong. Hopefully, Joey&#39;s Bachelor season will also end with an engagement.

The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
