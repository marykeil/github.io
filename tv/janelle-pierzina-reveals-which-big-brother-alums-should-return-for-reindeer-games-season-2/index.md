## Literature Review
Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina shares who she thinks should return to the house to compete in Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2.




Big Brother Reindeer Games has been a pleasant surprise for fans, including Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina who revealed the player she&#39;d like to see in another season of the holiday-themed competition spin-off. Janelle originally appeared on Big Brother 6, making waves with her no-nonsense attitude and strategic gameplay. She returned during Big Brother 7, the first All-Stars season, where she made it to the final three for a second time. After a hiatus from the competition, Janelle returned as a coach during Big Brother 14 alongside Dan Gheesling, Britney Haynes, and Mike &#34;Boogie&#34; Malin, and then came back again for Big Brother 22, the second All-Stars.




As a Big Brother viewer, Janelle has been open about her opinions on the spin-off series and shared who she feels should join Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2 next year. On Twitter, Janelle posed an unrelated question and alum Donny Thompson, who was voted America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest during Big Brother 16, responded to her.


 

&#34;You...and Zach need to come back for Reindeer games! Love ya Donny,&#34; Janelle shared. Outside of her pick of Donny, Janelle also shared that she thinks Zach Rance, another Big Brother 16 alum, would be a great fit for the series.


 What Has Happened On Big Brother Reindeer Games So Far? 
          




Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 has been a fascinating look at the game in a completely different format, incorporating interesting competitions and new powers for a holiday-themed competition. With nine Big Brother legends returning to compete for the $100,000 grand prize, the first eliminations of the game have been shocking. With legends like Britney Haynes, Taylor Hale, Josh Martinez, Cody Calafiore, and Frankie Grande joining the series, the competition is strong and will continue to get more difficult. After the shocking elimination of Big Brother 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin during the first episode, it was clear that Reindeer Games could be anyone&#39;s to win.

Big Brother Reindeer Games takes the traditional Big Brother format and removes some of the major social elements. The series was filmed over a week, using the Big Brother house as a set for competitions and strategies but limiting the amount of time the players spend strategizing about the game. While there are still social pieces to the game, like alliances and social decisions that need to be made due to powers and competitions with social elements, Big Brother Reindeer Games episodes focus more on the competitions that houseguests compete in throughout the game. Each episode sees one competitor eliminated, and after losing both Cameron and Cody, it&#39;s clear that competition isn&#39;t everything.




As the first iteration of Big Brother Reindeer Games continues, the series has been refreshing to see after a long season of Big Brother 25. While the inequitable competitions throughout Big Brother 25 received backlash, seeing Big Brother Reindeer Games hosting competitions that are intriguing and complex is a welcome change for viewers. Though it&#39;s not clear if there will be another season of Big Brother Reindeer Games, legends like Janelle are ready with a list of houseguests they&#39;d love to see compete if given the chance.

Big Brother Reindeer Games airs Monday and Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
