## Literature Review
The upcoming winter-themed Big Brother spin-off, Big Brother Reindeer Games, will only air six episodes, much shorter than fans are used to.




The schedule for the upcoming Big Brother spin-off, Big Brother Reindeer Games, has been revealed. Julie Chen Moonves made the announcement about this brand-new series at the Big Brother 25 finale. There were multiple twists throughout the milestone Big Brother season, including casting Survivor legend Cirie Fields to compete alongside her son, Jared Fields. Cirie ended up being evicted in fifth place after being in the house for 93 days. At the Big Brother 25 finale, Bowie Jane became the final member of the jury, which chose Jag Bains over Matt Klotz to win the $750,000 prize.




On the heels of CBS announcing the brand-new Big Brother series, the schedule for Big Brother Reindeer Games is now online. According to The Futon Critic, the six-episode spin-off show will take place across just two weeks in December. It&#39;ll air on a Monday, Tuesday and Thursday schedule. During the premiere week, the first three episodes of Reindeer Games will air on December 11 at 8 p.m. EST, December 12 at 9 p.m. EST and December 14 at 8 p.m. EST. Then over the final week of the season, Reindeer Games is set to air December 18 at 9 p.m. EST, December 19 at 9 p.m. EST and December 21 at 8 p.m. EST. The season ends four days before Christmas.


 What To Expect From Big Brother Reindeer Games 
          

Julie teased fans that a special announcement would be taking place during the Big Brother 25 finale, which sent rumors flying all over the Internet. The most notable one was that a Legends edition of Big Brother would air in the winter to help CBS fill some gaps in the schedule caused by the recently-ended WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. However, that didn&#39;t come to pass, as the news ended up being a short winter-themed spin-off called Big Brother Reindeer Games, set to air in December.





 

Unlike the regular version of Big Brother, Reindeer Games will not have any live feeds. It appears that the spin-off will be filmed entirely ahead of time, meaning no live episodes either. Nine Big Brother alums are expected to compete against each other in various challenges. An element called Santa&#39;s Showdown will determine who&#39;s eliminated in each episode, which means the competitors are not voting to evict each other. At the end of the season, the winner will walk away with $100,000.

The Big Brother Reindeer Games cast has not been determined just yet. However, it has been revealed that one of the contestants will be someone who just competed on Big Brother 25. The lineup will likely be a mix of fan-favorites and villains so viewers have people to root for and against; plus, any villains that are cast will surely cause some drama. Big Brother alums Jordan Lloyd, Tiffany Mitchell and Derek Xiao will participate as &#34;Elves.&#34; It sounds like they might be advising the players during the games. No matter who joins the show, Reindeer Games will be an exciting competition to tide fans over until Big Brother 26.
