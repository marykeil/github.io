A bunch of the men had added &ldquo;FP&rdquo; to their profiles during a cast Zoom meeting. The initials stood for &ldquo;F*** Peter.&rdquo; Peter felt that the cyberbullying was uncalled for. However, the other men seemed to think it was justified because of his alleged rude night one behavior toward them, and his desire to capitalize on his Bachelorette experience, which Peter denied. Only his fellow Bachelorette contestant Xavier Bonner apologized to him.</p>
<p>Rachel Recchia</p>
<p>The former Bachelorette joining Bachelor in Paradise season 9 is Rachel. She&rsquo;s a 27-year-old pilot from Clermont, Florida, who got her start on Clayton&rsquo;s season of The Bachelor.

Rachel and Gabby later made a special appearance on Bachelor in Paradise season 8, to fill their friends in about the men from their season, which hadn&rsquo;t yet aired at the time the latter show was filmed.</p>

</code></pre>

</code></pre>
<p>Taylor Pegg</p>
<p>Taylor Pegg is a 32-year-old loan officer from Springboro, Ohio. He got his reality dating series start on Charity&rsquo;s Bachelorette season. On premiere night, Taylor made a strong first impression when he exited the limousine to meet Charity with a GoPro camera. He filmed the moment, saying, &ldquo;All right, kids, I&rsquo;m meeting your mom for the first time.&rdquo; It was a sweet How I Met Your Mother reference. However, Bachelor Nation barely got a chance to know Taylor because he was eliminated later that night. Hopefully, he&rsquo;ll have better luck on the beaches of Mexico on Bachelor in Paradise season 9.</p>
<p>Tyler Norris</p>
<p>Tyler Norris is a 26-year-old small business owner from Wildwood, New Jersey. He got his Bachelor Nation start on Rachel and Gabby Windey&rsquo;s season.

<p>Will Urena</p>
<p>Will Urena, a 31-year-old academic interventionist from Grand Rapids, Michigan got his Bachelor Nation start on Michelle Young&rsquo;s Bachelorette season. Throughout the season, Will clashed with Peter Izzo. During a spelling challenge on a group date, he wrote Peter&rsquo;s name as a joke when the men were asked to spell the word narcissist. Will was very upset when Peter threw a jacket Will won on a date with Michelle into a swimming pool. The jacket was from a Top Gun movie-themed date. Will didn&rsquo;t think that Peter was on the show for the right reasons.</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise season 9 has an interesting mix of contestants. Hopefully, some of them will find the love they&rsquo;ve been searching for on the beaches of Mexico. Past seasons of the show have been very successful, with many relationships leading to marriages and children. The show&rsquo;s more relaxed atmosphere makes it easier for people to form meaningful connections. Bachelor in Paradise season 9 seems like it will be filled with excitement, romance, and love.</p>
<p>Bachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.</p>
