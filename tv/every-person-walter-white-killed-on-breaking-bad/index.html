  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Walter White&rsquo;s descent into villainy on Breaking Bad is highlighted by his high body count, with almost 300 people killed directly or indirectly.   Despite not necessarily being a psychotic murderer, Walt&rsquo;s indifference towards the deaths he caused, and his eventual ruthlessness, are chilling.   The number of people Walt kills rises significantly at key points throughout the series, showcasing his transformation into a true villain.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Through five seasons of Breaking Bad, Walter White was responsible for the deaths of hundreds, and that&rsquo;s not even counting anyone killed by his meth.</p>
<p>Looking at how many people Walter White killed on Breaking Bad highlights just how deep his descent into villainy, as the mild-mannered chemistry teacher racked up an impressive number of kills on his journey to becoming Heisenberg. Throughout the five seasons of Breaking Bad, Walt caused the death of almost 300 people, directly or indirectly. Since Walt didn&rsquo;t necessarily seem to fall under the label of a psychotic murderer and wasn&rsquo;t especially violent even when he first turned to crime, the number of deaths he&rsquo;s responsible for is nothing short of shocking — and shows how ruthless he truly is, even if he isn&rsquo;t physically intimidating as far as fictional crime lords go.</p>
<p>Walter White killed many people for self-defense reasons in Breaking Bad, and despite his high body count, he&rsquo;s never gone out of his way to be a killer. However, he also played a key role in a chain of events that caused a plane crash. Walt also killed many characters in cold blood by the end of the show, and while he never relished the carnage, his eventual indifference towards it is just as chilling. Plotting the deaths he caused season-by-season charts how evil he became in Breaking Bad, although the number of people Walt kills rises significantly at a few key points long before the finale in season 5.</p>
<p>Breaking Bad is available to stream on Netflix.</p>
<pre><code>              Breaking Bad: Everything Walt Copied From His Victims   Walter White had a habit of picking up traits from victims throughout Breaking Bad. Here's who he copied and why it may have been done subconsciously.    
</code></pre>
<p>Walt Causes 2 Deaths In Breaking Bad Season 1
Emilio Koyama</p>
<p>Walter White didn&rsquo;t kill many people in season 1 of Breaking Bad, but his first murders came before it concluded, starting with with Emilio. When Walt and Jesse come face to face with Krazy-8, a local drug distributor impressed by Walt&rsquo;s quality meth, and Emilio, Jesse&rsquo;s partner, the situation quickly gets out of control as Emilio recognizes Walt from the day he got arrested. Walt has no option but to reveal to Krazy-8 and Emilio his meth formula in exchange for his life. However, Walt shows his best chemistry teacher skills by tricking the duo into a deadly vapor that knocks Krazy-8 out and kills Emilio.</p>
<p>Krazy-8</p>
<p>Krazy-8 becomes the center of one of Breaking Bad season 1&rsquo;s most harrowing dilemmas, as Walt must decide whether he should spare the man&rsquo;s life or not. After recklessly disposing of Emilio&rsquo;s body, Walt and Jesse still need to decide what to do with Krazy-8, who was just a minor character in the show but ended up later having a relevant storyline in Better Call Saul. Walt is ready to let the man go but realizes Krazy-8 got ahold of a glass shard and intends to ambush him. This causes Walt to kill Krazy-8 in self-defense, choking the man to death.</p>
<p>Walter White Causes 168 Deaths In Breaking Bad Season 2
Jane Margolis</p>
<p>Even with how many people Walter White killed on Breaking Bad, the murder of Jane remains one of the most shocking. Jane Margolis remains a key supporting character in the series even after her early death, which occurs in the same season in which she&rsquo;s introduced. With their relationship being Jesse&rsquo;s most impactful throughout the show, Jane&rsquo;s death on Breaking Bad signals the first hint at Walt&rsquo;s shattering psyche.</p>
<p>Although Walt doesn&rsquo;t kill Jane with his own hands, he watches her collapse on a heroin overdose, refusing to aid her despite having all the resources and knowledge to do so. Walt believed Jane posed a serious threat to his business with Jesse and was certainly relieved to hear his passiveness had ended up causing her death.</p>
<pre><code>              How Breaking Bad Heavily Foreshadowed Jane's Death   The death of Krysten Ritter's Jane Margolis is one of Breaking Bad's most shocking moments. But the clues were all right there in front of us.    
</code></pre>
<p>167 Wayfarer 515 Passengers</p>
<p>The number of people Walter White killed in Breaking Bad rises dramatically during season 2, episode 13, &ldquo;ABQ&rdquo;. Few viewers could&rsquo;ve guessed that the mysterious pink teddy bear in Breaking Bad was foreshadowing not only Jane&rsquo;s death but also a disaster of massive proportions, indirectly caused by Walt&rsquo;s decision not to intervene in her overdose.</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s death caused her father, an air traffic controller, to break down at work and make a deadly error, causing a tragic plane collision that resulted in 167 deaths. The symbolic teddy bear falls from the debris straight to Walt&rsquo;s yard, almost as a souvenir brought from destiny itself. The Breaking Bad airplane crash is shocking not only because it adds over 150 deaths to Walter White&rsquo;s kill count, but also because it&rsquo;s partially inspired by a real tragedy.</p>
<p>Walt Kills 3 People In Breaking Bad Season 3
Gus Fring&rsquo;s Dealer Duo</p>
<p>One of Walter White&rsquo;s most criminal moments in Breaking Bad also represents a turning point on his journey to becoming a villain. Aiming at saving Jesse from an unfortunate fate, Walt tracks his partner as he prepares to kill the two drug dealers who caused the death of Jesse&rsquo;s best friend, Combo. In an anxiety-inducing sequence, Walt comes seemingly out of nowhere and runs over the two criminals. The scene ends with one of Walt&rsquo;s best one-liners in Breaking Bad, as he solemnly orders Jesse, &ldquo;Run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gale Boetticher</p>
<p>Gale Boetticher was a man marked for death ever since he became as good as &ldquo;Heisenberg&rdquo; at cooking meth. Gale&rsquo;s death felt like a certainty in Breaking Bad — the mystery wasn&rsquo;t if Gale would die, but who would kill him and when. As Walt and Gus&rsquo;s relationship comes close to a boiling point, Walt and Jesse are quick to realize the only way to prevent Gus from killing the two of them is to get rid of Gale, their potential meth-cooking substitute. Walt manipulates Jesse to execute the order, and although he&rsquo;s not the one who pulls the trigger, he&rsquo;s the biggest culprit in the murder.</p>
<pre><code>              Breaking Bad: Why Walt Didn’t Let Gale Take The Fall As Heisenberg   Season 3 of Breaking Bad featured a brief partnership between Walt &amp;amp; Gale. Here's why Walt didn't let his ex-assistant take the fall as Heisenberg.    
</code></pre>
<p>In Breaking Bad Season 4 Heisenberg Is Responsible For 5 Deaths
Hector, Tyrus, &amp; Gus Fring</p>
<p>Walter White pulls off his master plan to deal with Gus Fring by manipulating Hector Salamanca to finally get his desired revenge. With Hector paralyzed and only able to communicate through a ringing bell, no one could&rsquo;ve suspected him. This makes the old man the perfect tool for Walt, who attaches a pipe bomb to Hector&rsquo;s wheelchair. In an anxiety-inducing scene, the explosive device blows up inside Hector&rsquo;s nursing home room, killing him, Gus Fring, and Gus&rsquo;s associate Tyrus, perfectly accomplishing Walt&rsquo;s iconic plan. There are questions of how realistic Fring&rsquo;s Breaking Bad death is, but it was certainly memorable.</p>
<p>Gus&rsquo; Henchmen</p>
<p>Walter White is embracing his dangerous nature by Breaking Bad season 4, so while it would have been shocking in season 1, Heisenberg killing Gus Fring&rsquo;s henchmen to save Jesse didn&rsquo;t raise an eyebrow this far into his journey. After indirectly causing Gus Fring&rsquo;s memorable death, Walt still needs to deal with the two henchmen keeping Jesse captive at the superlab, and he does not hesitate to pull the trigger at them. Walt rescues Jesse, and the two bid farewell to Gus&rsquo;s lab with a final clean-up and a legendary exit as the place burns to the ground behind them.</p>
<p>Walt Kills 22 People In The Final Season Of Breaking Bad
Mike Ehrmantraut</p>
<p>Of all the Walter White kills in Breaking Bad, Mike Ehrmantraut was one of the most difficult for many viewers to stomach. Mike Ehrmantraut was an easy fan favorite; although he was far from being a good man, he was one of the few criminals in the show with some sense of morality.</p>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s honor led to his Breaking Bad death, as he refused to disclose Gus&rsquo;s imprisoned men&rsquo;s names and consequently got shot by Walt. As he leaves Mike to die, Walt bids farewell to the last bit of humanity and remorse he still has left in him, getting much closer to his Heisenberg persona than he&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s Imprisoned Men</p>
<p>After getting rid of Mike, Walter White&rsquo;s main objective was to eliminate anyone who could possibly identify him or Jesse to the police. This would ensure his business and identity remained safe, even if it meant ordering the murder of 10 people who may or may not be involved. Walt contacts Jack Welker, Breaking Bad season 5&rsquo;s main antagonist, who guarantees his infiltrated men will take care of Mike&rsquo;s imprisoned accomplices, killing them one by one in a series of ghastly acts of violence inside the prison.</p>
<p>Hank Schrader &amp; Steven Gomez</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird to think Hank Schrader was almost killed off in season 1 of Breaking Bad, because his murder at the hands of Jack Welker represents the vital moment when Walt finally realizes the horror he&rsquo;s brought with his drug empire. Walt has to come to terms with the fact that Hank&rsquo;s blood is on his hands since he&rsquo;s the one who brought him into that mess.</p>
<p>Hank&rsquo;s death changes everything; it finally breaks Walt&rsquo;s fantasy about a prominent future, and it breaks his family apart once and for all. To make it even worse, another innocent life was taken alongside Hank: Steven Gomez, a competent agent dead in service.</p>
<p>Jack Welker &amp; His Gang</p>
<p>Even with how many people Walter White killed in Breaking Bad, most of the audience cheered for him throughout the show, and wanted to see him succeed (even if his success was at being a crime lord). Walt&rsquo;s remote machine gun takes down all the major antagonists of Breaking Bad season 5 at once, terminating Jack Welker&rsquo;s Nazi gang, avenging Hank&rsquo;s death, and rescuing Jesse from captivity. Walter knew that of the lives he destroyed, Jesse was hit the hardest. Walt owed his partner a chance of redemption, prompting him to go all in as an army of one. Jack dies solemnly as he smokes a cigarette, representing the futility of revenge, a topic that ruled the final season.</p>
<p>Lydia Rodarte-Quayle</p>
<p>Lydia was easily one of the most detestable characters in Breaking Bad, and many viewers were happy to see her slowly succumb to a horrible death. Walter White made sure to kill her as treacherously as she turned against him, poisoning her with ricin and leaving her with no choice but to gradually watch her own body malfunction.</p>
<p>Walter White</p>
<p>The final life Walter White took on Breaking Bad was his own, with no better method than dying due to injuries inflicted by his own device. His demise isn&rsquo;t actually shown, but the spinoff movie El Camino confirms Walt&rsquo;s death through a news report. Walt knew the only way to protect his loved ones was to finally give in, and the Breaking Bad finale, &ldquo;Felina,&rdquo; finally showed him admitting his own mistakes and his selfishness. In the end, he didn&rsquo;t succumb to cancer and got rid of the ordinary life that scared him so much, but he died knowing there was nothing good about what he had done.</p>
