## Literature Review
The Good Place season 1’s finale twist is one of the most iconic of all time, and one BTS detail makes this moment even better in hindsight.




The Good Place season 1&#39;s Bad Place reveal is among the biggest sitcom plot twists to grace the screen, and one detail makes it even better in hindsight. After an entire outing of Eleanor attempting to hide the fact that she doesn&#39;t belong in the titular version of heaven, The Good Place season 1 finale reveals that the characters are actually in the Bad Place. This revelation answers many questions raised in the early episodes, and it helps the NBC series move beyond its initial premise and onto something with greater stakes.




Season 1&#39;s ending is iconic for its shock value, but the way it unfolds further elevates the twist. Watching as everything clicks into place for Eleanor is hilarious, as are her friends&#39; reactions to her realization. Michael&#39;s cruel laughter rounds the whole scene out perfectly, and there&#39;s a reason it all works so well — one that makes the finale even easier to appreciate upon a rewatch.



All four seasons of The Good Place are currently streaming on Netflix.



Kristen Bell &amp; Ted Danson Were The Only Actors Who Knew About The Bad Place Twist 
          

The Good Place season 1&#39;s big twist is already iconic, but it&#39;s made even funnier by the fact that Kristen Bell and Ted Danson were the only cast members who knew about it. Series creator Mike Schur admitted as much in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, during which he discussed how hard it was to keep actors, directors, and executives in the dark while planning to shift the show&#39;s direction. Schur felt that Bell and Danson should know, as their characters were heavily involved in the reveal. Eleanor is the one who realizes the group is actually in the Bad Place, while Michael is orchestrating everything.

Schur felt the other actors would have more believable responses if they didn&#39;t know their characters were in the Bad Place. Judging by the looks on their faces as the scene unfolded, he was correct. The creator told EW that he&#39;d want to be surprised if the roles were reversed, stating, &#34;They gave the most honest and real performance they could give, simply because they didn&#39;t know.&#34;


The Good Place Season 1’s Twist Will Forever Be Among TV’s Most Iconic 
          

Schur&#39;s approach to The Good Place worked out in the show&#39;s favor, as Eleanor&#39;s season 1 revelation will forever be one of TV&#39;s most iconic plot twists. Eleanor&#39;s &#34;This is the Bad Place!&#34; line is endlessly quotable, and the energy of the scene would be impossible to recapture. It&#39;s likely keeping the cast in the dark about the Bad Place reveal contributed to the moment&#39;s success — and given that it continued for another three seasons, it&#39;s safe to say Schur&#39;s secrecy paid off. For viewers rewatching The Good Place, the reality of what happened behind the scenes makes the finale even better, eliciting more laughter from the characters&#39; expressions.
