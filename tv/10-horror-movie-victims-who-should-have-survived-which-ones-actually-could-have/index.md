## Literature Review

There are many horror movie victims that everyone hoped would survive, but there are also some fan-favorites who easily could have made it out alive.




While there are plenty of horror movie victims who deserved to live, there are also some who could have survived if their circumstances were just a tiny bit different. It is tricky for horror movies to get viewers invested in their characters. After all, horrors usually kill off most of their cast, or at least put them through hell. As such, it can be tough to convince viewers that watching perfectly likable people struggle against unstoppable monsters before dying brutally will be a fun time at the movies. To this end, many horror movies intentionally make their characters unlikable.
This can take things too far in the opposite direction, creating horror victims who are worse than the villains. However, the alternative is that even a well-regarded horror movie may leave viewers fuming when their favorite character shuffles off their mortal coil. Well-loved cult classics like Scream, Cabin in the Woods, and Fear Street: 1994 have handed out death scenes that felt profoundly unearned to characters who should have survived their stories. Some of these characters were deeply likable people up against impossible odds, while others were painfully close to making it out of their ordeal alive.









 








 10  Kate, Fear Street: 1994 
Fear Street’s tough, resourceful heroine was seconds from survival


 







  Fear Street: Part One - 1994  
Horror
Mystery



  Release Date    July 2, 2021     Director    Leigh Janiak     Cast    Darrell Britt-Gibson , Benjamin Flores Jr. , Maya Hawke , Jordana Spiro , Fred Hechinger , Olivia Scott Welch , Ashley Zukerman , Kiana Madeira , Jeremy Ford , Julia Rehwald , Jordyn DiNatale    


Fear Street: 1994 was the first in a trilogy of slasher movies adapted from RL Stine’s novels of the same name. While the Fear Street’s trilogy upcoming sequel will focus on new characters, the original movies followed a group of teens from the small town of Shadyside. Kate was the group’s most unpredictable member, a promising student and cheerleader who secretly sold drugs to help her save up and leave Shadyside. She ended up gruesomely dismembered by a bread slicer, but Kate&#39;s fate occurred only seconds before her friends broke the curse that powered the killer pursuing Kate.





 9  Jenna, Friday the 13th (2009) 
Friday the 13th’s final girl could have gotten out of Jason’s lair
        

  Friday the 13th (2009)  
Horror
Thriller



  Release Date    February 13, 2009     Director    Marcus Nispel     Cast    Jared Padalecki , Danielle Panabaker , Aaron Yoo , Amanda Righetti , Travis Van Winkle , Derek Mears    


Friday the 13th’s 2009 remake pulled out all the stops to subvert the audience’s expectations, but the reboot took this approach too far in its finale. Danielle Panabaker’s sweet, resourceful, and smart heroine did everything she could to escape Jason Voorhees and help Jared Padalecki’s Clay find his missing sister, eventually even breaking into Jason’s lair and freeing her. As such, the moment when Jenna was impaled by Jason while climbing to freedom felt cheap and unnecessary, especially since Clay could have let her leave the tunnel first.





 8  Eddie, It: Chapter 2 
Pennywise’s final victim attacked him just a few minutes too soon
        

  It Chapter Two  
Horror
Thriller



  Release Date    September 6, 2019     Director    Andres Muschietti     Cast    Bill Hader , Isaiah Mustafa , James Ransone , Jay Ryan , Jessica Chastain , Andy Bean , James McAvoy , Bill Skarsgard    


James Ransome’s Eddie was one of the members of the Losers Club who defeated Stephen King’s iconic villain Pennywise, but IT: Chapter 2 proved that this traumatic event cast a long shadow over his adult life. A perpetually anxious, neurotic figure, Eddie struggled to get over his fears of Pennywise’s return in the intervening years. This made it all the more devastating when 2019’s sequel saw Pennywise kill him seconds after Eddie stood up to him, only for the rest of the Losers Club to beat the monster minutes later by doing the same thing.





 7  Ishmael, Halloween (2007) 
Danny Trejos’s tragic Halloween hero truly had no chance
        

  Rob Zombie&#39;s Halloween  
Horror
Thriller



  Release Date    August 31, 2007     Director    Rob Zombie     Cast    Malcolm McDowell , Sheri Moon Zombie , Tyler Mane , Scout Taylor-Compton , Brad Dourif , Danielle Harris , William Forsythe    


Danny Trejo played a saintly orderly named Ishmael in Rob Zombie’s divisive 2007 re-imagining of Halloween. While the rest of the staff in Haddonfield’s psychiatric hospital were horrifically cruel to Michael Myers, Ishmael showed him kindness throughout his decades trapped in the institution. Michael repaid him with a drawn-out, brutal death scene that Ishmael could never have escaped since the moment is designed to remind viewers that the franchise’s villain is an unambiguously evil figure to his core.





 6  Miss Collins, Carrie 
Carrie’s kindest character had no hope of surviving
        

Unusually, most of the victims in Carrie were less likable than their killer. Piper Laurie played Carrie’s mother as a monstrous zealot, while most of her classmates were uncaring bullies who actively took part in her public humiliation. As such, it was tough to care when her psychic powers caused their fiery deaths. However, Miss Collins was unerringly kind to the troubled teen, confronting her bullies for her and comforting her repeatedly. That said, Carrie’s inability to control her powers meant Collins was always guaranteed a bloody, tragic end.





 5  Reese, Green Room 
This tense siege horror’s hero should have made it a little further
        

  Green Room  
Thriller
Crime
Drama
Horror



  Release Date    April 15, 2016     Director    Jeremy Saulnier     Cast    Anton Yelchin , Imogen Poots , Patrick Stewart , Alia Shawkat , Callum Turner , Joe Cole    


2015’s gruesome psychological thriller Green Room saw a punk band trapped in the eponymous room by a group of neo-Nazis after they accidentally witnessed a murder. Joe Cole’s Reese was among the most resourceful and canny of the group, tackling and disarming a far larger bouncer thanks to his martial arts prowess. As such, it was heartbreaking if admittedly believable when he escaped through a window only to be stabbed to death by thugs waiting on the other side.





 4  Elizabeth Shaw, Alien Covenant 
It is impossible to tell if Prometheus’s heroine could have survived
        

 alien covenant 
Thriller
Adventure
 Sci-Fi



  Release Date    May 19, 2017     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Amy Seimetz , Noomi Rapace , Danny McBride , Katherine Waterston , Demián Bichir , James Franco , Guy Pearce , Carmen Ejogo , Billy Crudup , Michael Fassbender    


While Ridley Scott’s Alien prequels aren’t perfect, one of their best new franchise additions was Noomi Rapace’s Elizabeth Shaw. Like Alien’s heroine Ripley, this protagonist was clever, strong, and quick-thinking. Unlike Ripley, she was killed offscreen between movies, and she didn’t even die at the claws of a lethal Xenomorph. It is hard to know whether Shaw should have survived since viewers never saw her interactions with Michael Fassbender’s emotionless android David so there is no knowing whether she could have defeated him.





 3  Holden, Cabin in the Woods 
This likable love interest was never going to make it out alive
        

  The Cabin in the Woods  
Horror
Comedy



  Release Date    April 13, 2012     Director    Drew Goddard     Cast    Richard Jenkins , Fran Kranz , Chris Hemsworth , Bradley Whitford , Kristen Connolly    


Cabin in the Woods introduced a charismatic, kind-hearted love interest for its heroine in Jesse Williams’ med student Holden. Unlike earlier victims in the movie, Holden wasn’t misled by the hormones that the lab pumped into the titular location, allowing him to keep a clear head while trying to escape the monstrous Bruckner family. However, none of this would have mattered in the long run as the movie’s ending killed off everyone on Earth, meaning Holden was always guaranteed to die that night one way or another.





 2  Tatum, Scream 
Sidney’s best friend was blatantly able to escape her killer


 







  Scream  
Horror
Mystery



  Release Date    December 20, 1996     Director    Wes Craven     Cast    Jamie Kennedy , Skeet Ulrich , Drew Barrymore , Rose McGowan , Neve Campbell , David Arquette , Roger Jackson , Courteney Cox , matthew lillard    


Rose McGowan’s Scream heroine Tatum was as resilient, pop-culture literate, and sharp as the rest of the franchise’s heroines. However, unlike them, she didn’t survive her Ghostface encounter despite successfully flooring the killer twice. Tatum’s attempt to climb to freedom through a doggy door might have seemed foolish, but the movie’s creators actually needed to nail McGowan’s clothes to the door to ensure she didn’t fall free. Thus, there is real-life evidence that Tatum should have escaped her fate.





 1  Helen, I Know What You Did Last Summer 
Sarah Michelle Gellar’s heroine could have given this classic slasher&#39;s villain the slip


 







  I Know What You Did Last Summer  
Horror
Mystery



  Release Date    October 17, 1997     Director    Jim Gillespie     Cast    Ryan Phillippe , Freddie Prinze Jr. , Muse Watson , Sarah Michelle Gellar , Jennifer Love Hewitt    


Although Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s upcoming reboot might provide Sarah Michelle Gellar with another chance to reinvent the Final Girl archetype, 1997’s I Know What You Did Last Summer already deprived the star of a potentially great, subversive genre role. Gellar’s Helen Shivers was smarter, funnier, and more resourceful than the movie’s actual heroine, escaping the killer numerous times throughout a punishing chase sequence. If it weren’t for a ludicrously poorly timed marching band, this horror heroine would have been the star of this movie’s story.
