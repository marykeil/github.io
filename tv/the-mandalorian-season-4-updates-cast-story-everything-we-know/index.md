# The Mandalorian Season 4 Updates Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know


## SUMMARY 



  The Mandalorian season 4 is highly anticipated but not officially confirmed yet. Its status is unclear given recent movie announcements.   Based on the ending of season 3, the core cast of The Mandalorian including Pedro Pascal, Taika Waititi, Katee Sackhoff, Carl Weathers, and Emily Swallow are likely to return for season 4.   Season 3&#39;s ending sets up a major New Republic story for season 4, with Din Djarin hunting down members of the Imperial Shadow Council, potentially tying in with the upcoming New Republic feature film through Grand Admiral Thrawn&#39;s resurgence.

## Literature Review
After The Mandalorian season 3’s conclusion in 2023, the story of  The Mandalorian season 4 is shaping up to be one of the show’s biggest yet.




The Mandalorian season 4&#39;s future is unclear, after the announcement of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu; should it happen, it will continue the story of Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin and his adopted son Din Grogu, as they chart a new path in the New Republic era. There was a sense in which The Mandalorian season 3 served as somewhat of a pivot for the hit Disney&#43; TV show, broadening its focus away from Din Djarin himself to the wider story of the planet of Mandalore and its former inhabitants. That song has now been sung, with the Mandalorians successfully retaking their home planet as of The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s climactic ending.




As such, the ending of Din Djarin&#39;s latest adventure has naturally led to intense speculation surrounding the future of the series. Lucasfilm has already confirmed a Star Wars movie to culminate The Mandalorian&#39;s story, which means Din Djarin and Din Grogu will return on the big screen in the future. Before this cinematic event, though, there will be at least one more season of The Mandalorian as Lucasfilm continues its success on the small screen with a host of upcoming Star Wars TV shows.


 The Mandalorian Season 4&#39;s Future Is Uncertain After Recent Movie Announcements 
It&#39;s unclear whether The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has replaced the TV show.
          

Speaking to BFMTV INSIDE back in February 2023, writer Jon Favreau confirmed the scripts for The Mandalorian season 4 had been completed before season 3 even finished airing:


&#34;Season 4? Yeah, I’ve written it already. We have to know where we are going to tell a fully formed story. So, we had mapped it out, Dave [Filoni] and I. And then slowly you just write each episode.&#34;





Plans have undoubtedly changed, however, with recent announcements that Favreau is now working on The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu - the first Star Wars movie to release at theaters since 2019&#39;s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. It&#39;s currently unclear whether The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu replaces season 4, whether it is supplemental to it, or whether Lucasfilm is pursuing some kind of hybrid approach. Latest rumors claim The Mandalorian season 4 will be six episodes in length, culminating in the movie.

 The Mandalorian Season 4&#39;s Confirmed Cast 
The Mandalorian&#39;s regular players will surely return for season 4&#39;s story.
         

 While there has yet to be any confirmed cast for The Mandalorian season 4, there are a few essential characters who are necessary for the show to continue. Pedro Pascal would be sure to return as the star, with the focus remaining on his relationship with Grogu. He&#39;s now living on Nevarro, meaning Carl Weathers&#39; Greef Karga has a logical role; IG-11 has become Nevarro&#39;s marshal, which likewise indicates Taika Waititi should be back. Meanwhile, a change in Din Djarin&#39;s status quo - he&#39;s started working for the New Republic - surely means Paul Sun-Hyung Lee&#39;s Carson Teva will be back.




This new role means the Coruscant subplot introduced in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 3 is likely to be important to The Mandalorian era going forward. If that is the case, Katy O&#39;Brian&#39;s Imperial spy Elia Kane will surely be a returning antagonist, whether in the movie or the TV show. Other members of The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s cast will probably play supporting roles as well, including Katee Sackhoff&#39;s Bo-Katan Kryze and Emily Swallow&#39;s Armorer.



 The Mandalorian Season 4 Story: What Season 3&#39;s Ending Sets Up 
The Mandalorian season 3 ends with a tantalizing set-up for a major New Republic story in season 4.
          

The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s finale established a new status quo for Din Djarin. A bounty hunter by trade, Din approached Carson Teva and proposed working for the New Republic off the books. This role means he will be hunting down other members of the Imperial Shadow Council, unaware the various warlords are secretly working together. This will likely tie Din Djarin and Grogu to Grand Admiral Thrawn, the resurgent heir to the Empire after Ahsoka season 1. Assuming the latest rumors are true, it&#39;s possible The Mandalorian season 4 will see Din Djarin discover Thrawn&#39;s existence - setting up a showdown for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.
