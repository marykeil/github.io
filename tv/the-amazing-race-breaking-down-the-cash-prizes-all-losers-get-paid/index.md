## Literature Review
The Amazing Race teams receive cash prizes, even if they finish in last place. However, there are questions about how much the cast members earn.





Following eight elimination rounds, the final three The Amazing Race pairs go head-to-head in the finale as they attempt to win the grand prize. Each of the ten losing teams also receives a cash prize, but the amount they get varies based on certain factors. The Amazing Race requires a unique combination of brains and brawn, plus an impeccable sense of teamwork. After lots of traveling (while completing challenges along the way), the winning team receives a $1 million prize. Smaller prizes are available en route, which are awarded to whichever team wins a particular leg of the race.

 How Much Do The Amazing Race Losers Earn? 
          

The amount of cash given to non-winning teams has not been confirmed by CBS, but according to Men&#39;s Health, every team does get some form of payout. Aside from the $1 million earned by the team in first place, the publication revealed that the runners-up get $25,000 between them. The team in third earns $10,000. The lowest cash prize, awarded to the team in eleventh place, is reportedly $1,500, with the team placing tenth receiving $2,500. From there, the winnings increase incrementally by $500 through fourth place.



 Taxes Impact How Much The Amazing Race Contestants Earn 
          




Given how much money is taken out in taxes, plus the income lost by contestants during filming, it doesn&#39;t turn out to be so much for most. According to season 21 competitor Mark &#34;Abba&#34; Abbattista, who spoke with The A.V. Club, he lost money. He also mentioned that the &#34;paid&#34; vacations that The Amazing Race teams win throughout the race are not covered by the TV show.

Though airfare and accommodation are covered, food is not, meaning that a show alum may spend a lot while on a holiday at a destination they didn&#39;t even choose. Abba also said that trips and other non-monetary prizes are heavily taxed, just like cash. For this reason, many contestants decide to sell their prizes or give them away as gifts to avoid hefty tax bills down the line.

There&#39;s no doubt that the grand prize makes a significant difference in the lives of The Amazing Race winners, even after taxes on those prizes are paid. This is also likely the case for the teams that place second and third. For the rest of the teams, the adventure of the race and the possibility of a little extra take-home pay are enough to make the whole experience well worth it.
