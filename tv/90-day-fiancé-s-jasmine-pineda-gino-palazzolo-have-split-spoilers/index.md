## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé season 10&#39;s most entertaining couple Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo are seemingly no longer together after filming season 10.




90 Day Fiancé couple Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo are seemingly no longer together after filming season 10. Jasmine, 36, and Gino, 52 were introduced in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Their contrasting personalities made Jasmine and Gino an entertaining franchise couple and their popularity has just kept on increasing in the past few years. Whenever it looked like Jasmine and Gino were done for good after a massive fight, they’d get back together to the shock of fans. Jasmine’s behavior made her look like a gold digger wanting fame and control, while Gino was extremely easy to manipulate.




Jasmine humiliated Gino by constantly comparing him to her ex-boyfriend Dane and even lied to him about a sex tape just to rile him up. Jasmine wasn’t a fan of Gino’s family, since they suspected she was using Gino for a Green Card. Jasmine let Gino know that she wasn’t interested in inviting them to their wedding. However, Jasmine turned over a new leaf in episode 13 when she told Gino she was trying to become a better person. Jasmine and Gino’s relationship seemed to have gotten better after their recent Miami trip in season 10, but that doesn’t mean they got a happily ever after in the end.

 Jasmine &amp; Gino&#39;s Relationship Problems Explained 
Jasmine &amp; Gino&#39;s Relationship Is Full Of Red Flags
         




Jasmine and Gino’s relationship problems began even before they met in person. Jasmine used to ask for “evidence and reports” of Gino’s whereabouts while they were dating long distance. Gino had been secretly in contact with his ex who was receiving nude photos of Jasmine. Jasmine discovering this led to their first split. Many other breakups followed for Jasmine. They almost broke up when Gino asked Jasmine to sign a prenup or when he refused to pay the rent for her expensive apartment in Panama. Jasmine’s close relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Dane, was also an issue for Gino. The couple fought over finances and Gino choosing his family over Jasmine.

Jasmine didn’t like Gino leaving his job without telling her about it. Gino had also been to a strip club behind her back. Jasmine found lipstick lying in Gino’s car during this eventful season 10. She threw her ring and cried about wanting to go back to Panama. Things improved between Jasmine and Gino when he flew her off to Miami before their wedding. However, Jasmine told Gino about how she’d spent all of her wedding dress allowance on getting new bum implants while also borrowing $2000 from her ex-boyfriend Dane. Gino was left feeling heartbroken by the “new Jasmine.”






 Jasmine &amp; Gino Got Married In June 2023 
Is Jasmine &amp; Gino&#39;s Marriage Over?
          

Jasmine was first spotted in America in June 2023. A Reddit user had posted Jasmine and Gino’s photo taken from a distance to confirm the gossip. The fan mentioned Gino and Jasmine were walking together in Plymouth, Michigan. Jasmine wore a hat just like Gino in the pic. Jasmine was still in Panama in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. The reveal had come as a major spoiler for those who were watching Jasmine and Gino fight on screen about her ex-boyfriend Dane’s involvement in her life. The promos for B90 season 6 had teased a major argument between the couple to suggest that they’d split.

Interestingly, June 2023 is when Jasmine and Gino also got married. It is unclear when Jasmine moved to the U.S. and began filming 90 Day Fiancé season 10. It may have been around April since she had to marry Gino within 30 days. Regardless, InTouch confirmed the news of Jasmine and Gino’s wedding in a November 2023 report. It mentioned that Jasmine and Gino tied the knot during a wedding ceremony in June 2023 according to a Wayne County, Michigan clerk. Sadly, no photos of Jasmine’s wedding day have been revealed yet.






 Jasmine Is Not Wearing Her Ring Anymore 
Gino Bought Jasmine A Diamond Ring In Season 10

 

Fans will have to wait until the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 finale to find out what the most awaited wedding day of the show looked like. However, seven months later, Jasmine is showing no signs of being in a happy marriage with Gino. The Michigan man wanted to get engaged to Jasmine the first time he met her in person. He was shown going to a jewelry shop to buy Jasmine a $270 ring from a local shop. Gino had his reasons for buying a cheap ring. He wanted to propose to Jasmine and had no time to waste before she could change her mind. Jasmine was moved by Gino’s romantic gesture.

The price tag didn’t bother Jasmine. She declared that “no diamond” could equal Gino’s love for her. However, Jasmine wanted a different ring in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Jasmine insisted he gets her a new ring while they were at a jewelry shop to buy a gift for Jasmine’s younger sister, Liz. Gino had walked out of the store feeling angry at Jasmine. He claimed she had misplaced her ring because she’d stopped wearing it. “It was not a ring I would ever buy from me or for any other person,” Jasmine had said. She’d started using the wedding ring she’d received from her ex-husband.




Gino’s ego may have been left damaged by what Jasmine said because he did give her a new ring. Gino presented Jasmine with a massive rock in episode 13 as they were celebrating the end of their Miami trip. “Would you marry me?” he asked her in Spanish, as Jasmine said, “Yes” to Gino. He said the ring he bought for her in Panama was not the most expensive ring so he wanted to propose to her with an upgraded ring. “I love it,” Jasmine cried and told the cameras that she “always wanted a different engagement ring.”

Jasmine said that as much as she liked the first ring, it was “cheap as f***.” Meanwhile, Gino assured her, “It’s a real diamond.” Jasmine had burst into tears when Gino proposed to her again, but for now, Jasmine may have lost interest in this new ring as well. Jasmine’s latest Instagram posts show that she doesn’t wear a ring. Jasmine’s ring is missing from her left hand.

Jasmine’s recent photos show that she’s been spending a lot of time in New York. Jasmine recently flew to NYC on a business trip. Jasmine wrote that “good things are on the making” and used the hashtags “#veganprotein” and “#jazzyprotein.” Jasmine seems to be building her brand now that she has possibly secured a work permit after her wedding. Jasmine posted a video story to tell her fans that she had a photo shoot lined up for “something” she was working on. Jasmine, however, chose not to say anything “until I have everything ready.”

Jasmine later shared a BTS from her photo shoot where Jasmine posed with her photographer and makeup artist. Jasmine again used the hashtag “#veganprotein.” Jasmine is passionate about fitness and veganism, but Gino not being by her side as she achieves her dreams is concerning. Jasmine seems to be traveling alone for her work trips as she readies herself to launch her dream project. While she does it, Gino, who should have been supporting his wife, is not cheering for Jasmine.






 Gino Is Nowhere To Be Seen On Jasmine&#39;s Instagram 
         

Gino also doesn’t feature in any of Jasmine’s recent Instagram updates. One glance at the Latina’s IG page and one might think it belongs to a single woman. Jasmine is also making it look like she’s moved to New York for good, which means Gino could still be in Michigan. Jasmine is known to be good at keeping secrets. After all, she was successfully able to hide her current location for several months while she was in the U.S. Jasmine might want to keep her current relationship status a secret until 90 Day Fiancé season 10 reveals she and Gino are married. However, her not posting about Gino at all is strange.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
