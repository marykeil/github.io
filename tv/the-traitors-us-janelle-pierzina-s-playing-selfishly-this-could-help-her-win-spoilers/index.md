## Literature Review
The Traitors US season 2&#39;s Janelle Pierzina is playing the game selfishly, which could help her take the win in the end. Could it hurt her game?




The Traitors US season 2 has welcomed Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina back to reality TV, and her selfish strategy is the perfect tactic to help her potentially win the game. Initially known for her appearances on Big Brother, Janelle has become a reality TV legend throughout the years. First appearing on BB 6 and BB 7 in quick succession, Janelle proved herself a consummate player, making it to the final three for both seasons. She took some time away from reality TV and returned to Big Brother 14 as a coach, entering the game in the first few weeks. Her most recent appearance was on Big Brother 22.




While Janelle has competed most commonly on Big Brother, she’s also tried her hand at other reality TV competition series in the years since she was first introduced to the reality TV scene. After appearing with The Traitors US season 1 winner Cirie Fields on Snake In The Grass, the two became friendly, which helped Janelle in her decision to try the game out for herself. While Janelle is a competitive threat in the series, her competitive abilities may be able to help her in the long run of the game, especially if she continues to play aggressively.

 Janelle Went For The First Shield As Soon As Possible 
          




The first group mission on The Traitors US season 2 saw the cast working together to make their way through a series of tasks to put together a large puzzle made of floating pieces in a lake. Starting with their hands bound, the players had to get themselves untied before moving through various tasks, which they could choose to put off finding shields that would protect them from being murdered by the Traitors later that night. While Janelle proved herself to be an asset to the team overall, once she had her hands untied she decided to go for a shield before working to help her fellow castmates get free.



 Janelle Squashed Her Beef With Dan To Preserve Her Game 
          

In her earliest moments on The Traitors US season 2, Janelle pulled her former Big Brother 14 castmate Dan Gheesling to the side to talk about the state of their relationship. While Janelle and Dan haven’t interacted much since their time on Big Brother, he had a hand in orchestrating her eviction, which she has never publicly forgiven him for. Instead of letting things fester with Dan, Janelle was proactive and chose to pull him aside and reassure him she has his back throughout the game. While she’s not aware of just how safe this will likely keep her, it was still a great strategic move.






 Janelle&#39;s Competition Prowess Could Keep Her Safe In A Game Like The Traitors 

 

Although competitions aren’t everything on The Traitors US, the fact that Janelle is physically capable will be a major asset to her as she moves through the game. Though she can’t always win safety, there’s always the possibility she’ll win a shield that could keep her safe in the game. That mixed with the fact that being good at competitions ultimately makes money for the prize pot that the traitors hope to win means Janelle could be a long-term asset on The Traitors US.
