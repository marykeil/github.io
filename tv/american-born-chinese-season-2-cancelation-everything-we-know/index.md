## Literature Review
Despite a promising start, the action-packed Disney&#43; original series American Born Chinese has been canceled after only one season. 




The Disney Plus original series American Born Chinese presented an action-comedy experience unlike anything else on the streaming service, but season 2 isn&#39;t happening. Based on the graphic novel of the same name by Gene Luen Yang, American Born Chinese follows high school student Ben Wang who finds himself thrust into the middle of an epic battle between mythical Chinese gods. Touching on themes like identity, bullying, and a host of other coming-of-age topics, American Born Chinese season 1 stood out because of its stellar cast and unique approach to storytelling




Reflecting author Yang&#39;s own quest for identity as a Chinese American, the series deftly blended its coming-of-age elements with its action comedy and was one of the most uniquely diverse shows on Disney Plus. Oscar winners Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan headed up the season 1 cast, but the show exceled far beyond the star power of its more experienced ensemble. American Born Chinese delivered on its promises as one of the most anticipated new shows of 2023 and was given a warm reception by critics (via Rotten Tomatoes). Despite that, Disney&#43; has pulled the plug on season 2.

 American Born Chinese Season 2 Is Canceled 
          

Despite the fact that the show earned a heap of praise from critics, American Born Chinese has been canceled after one season by Disney&#43;. Though the streamer hasn&#39;t provided an explanation for the decision, it likely came down to viewership numbers since critical reception only goes so far. The show&#39;s massive scale probably translated to a large budget, and Disney might not have found it wise to continue the show if audiences weren&#39;t watching. 




In another blow to fans of the show, American Born Chinese isn&#39;t likely to be picked up by another streamer since Disney doesn&#39;t typically share its original programming. Even as streamers like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have given canceled streaming shows a second chance, the huge scale and licensing issues involved with a show like American Born Chinese make renewal a near impossibility. 



 American Born Chinese Season 2 Cast 
          

The casting of American Born Chinese was one of the most pivotal aspects of season 1, and there is no reason to believe that season 2 would have been any different. American Born Chinese season 2 would likely have seen the return of many of the first season&#39;s cast, and it could&#39;ve even been supplemented by more stars if the series caught on. Series lead Ben Wang might have reprised his role as Jin Wang as well as his co-star Jimmy Liu as Wei-Chen. Additionally, big-name stars like Michelle Yeoh could have returned as Guanyin along with Ke Huy Quan as Freddy.






 American Born Chinese Season 2 Story Details 
          

Though American Born Chinese season 1 reached the boundaries of the graphic novel, the mythological origins of the story opened the door for a wealth of other possibilities. Besides continuing to explore Jin&#39;s process of growing up as an Asian American, the series could have introduced other mythological Chinese figures and sent the youthful hero on another quest across realms. Regardless of what could have happened in the second season, American Born Chinese had all the makings of a TV hit, but it just didn&#39;t work out.
