Big Brother Reindeer Games has brought back some of the most interesting players to compete for their $100,000 grand prize, including this BB legend.




Big Brother Reindeer Games brought back nine BB legends to compete in the holiday-themed competition, and fans are thrilled that one of their favorite Big Brother personalities has returned to reclaim her spot as the best BB houseguest of all time. With a group of Big Brother houseguests returning for the series, the alumni involved in Big Brother Reindeer Games were hotly debated online prior to the cast announcement for the series. While some fans were interested in seeing competitive threats in the game, others were hoping to see their favorite personalities return to the series for another shot with a whole new game to play.




Fans of Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 are thrilled to have BB legend Britney Haynes, who originally competed in Big Brother 12 and returned as a coach in Big Brother 14, back on their screens. “She hasnt changed one bit and is just as funny and entertaining as she was in those seasons. I truly believe she is the main part that&#39;s making this show as good as it is so far,” Reddit user u/InfinityQuartz shared. “I wish she had her own show or a podcast or YouTube channel. I would 1000% watch that,” u/cox_the_fox shared, after agreeing.

 Britney Haynes’ Big Brother Gameplay Explained 
          




Britney has been one of the most beloved Big Brother houseguests since her first time on the series during BB 12. Providing some of the funniest moments of the season, Britney was known for her diary room sessions where she would provide hilarious commentary about what was happening in the house and share her hilarious, sharp takes about the game. In contention with Big Brother 13 winner Rachel Reilly, who also competed on BB 12, Britney had some of the funniest moments of the season as she played the game as socially as possible, providing insight and commentary for her fellow houseguests, as well.


 

While Britney was known for her hilarious commentary and extreme facial expressions, she’s never been known for her competition wins. After taking fifth place on Big Brother 12 and eighth place on Big Brother 14, Britney returned to Big Brother Reindeer Games hoping to play a different style of competition. While she may not be the best physical competitor, Britney has proven herself as a threat in the game after winning the very first Naughty and Nice power, and helping her team to victory in the second Jingle Bell Brawl of the season. Her personality and social strategy have been helping her through BB Reindeer Games so far.




With Britney being one of the most beloved houseguests in Big Brother history, it’s no surprise that she’s come back for BB Reindeer Games and shown off why she’s so highly praised. From offering hilarious commentary in the diary room to sharing her social strategy with fellow BB legend Danielle Reyes, Britney has proven that she has what it takes to be an incredible reality TV personality regardless of the circumstances. While it may not be something she’s interested in pursuing constantly, Britney’s appearance on Big Brother Reindeer Games makes it clear she could be back on reality TV any time.
