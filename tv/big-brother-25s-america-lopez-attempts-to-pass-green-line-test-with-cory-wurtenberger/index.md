## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s showmance of the season, America Lopez &amp; Cory Wurtenberger, have finally left the BB house and are posting about their time outside.




Big Brother 25 came to an end with America Lopez and Cory Wurtenberger serving on the jury of 7 who voted to crown Jag Bains the winner of the season, and now they&#39;re sharing more about the lives outside the house. During the grueling 100-day season, Cory and America found themselves drawn to each other during the game of strategy and deceit. Forming a final 2 alliance early on, the pair grew closer as the weeks dragged on. During one of the longest seasons of Big Brother ever, the couple were able to bond before Cory&#39;s week 11 eviction, and spent weeks in jury after America&#39;s eviction the following week.




In an Instagram post, America shared that she and Cory were having a great time together post Big Brother 25. &#34;Making sure we pass the green line test after ppl roasted us for that mall pic,&#34; America shared, joking about a post Cory made on his own Instagram days prior. In the comments of Cory&#39;s photo, fans roasted the couple for not passing the &#34;green line&#34; test, as Cory was leaning in toward America in order to get into the frame.


 

According to Parade, the green line test &#34;states that a man who leans into and towards a woman in a photo feels insecure and &#34;lower value&#34; around her, indicating that a relationship is either doomed or unhappy.&#34; America used her own post to prove the inverse, as &#34;if a woman leans in, it can be a positive sign, and if both partners lean away from each other, that&#39;s also a positive sign for a relationship. Men have to stand up straight.&#34; While the green line test doesn&#39;t have much merit, the joke landed for fans of the couple.





 America &amp; Coryâ€™s Big Brother 25 Showmance Explained 
          

Throughout their time on Big Brother 25, America and Cory&#39;s relationship went from a game-based alliance to a flirtation to a full-blown relationship. The pair began the season as allies who seemed to have a bit of a crush on one another, but things changed rapidly as they got to know each other better. Forming a legitimate connection that had BB fans flocking to the live feeds to watch their relationship develop, Cory and America fell in love during their time in the house. They connected on a personal level that was fascinating to watch, as both are Big Brother superfans who were excited to sharing their game experiences.


 




While they bonded on a game-level, the pair also personally connected, sharing interests and a sense of humor while they spent hours talking in the BB backyard. Though there were moments of strain in the relationship as they figured out how to navigate real feelings in a game of deceit, their relationship was solid. Defining their relationship just a week before they were double blindsided and Cory was backdoored by his one-time ally, Jag, the sweet showmance was ultimately separated, but not before exchanging &#34;I love you&#34;&#39;s in the house. America unfortunately fell victim to the next double eviction, finding herself in the jury just a week after Cory.

With Cory and America finally coming out of their jury sequester for the BB 25 finale, they&#39;re now able to start their relationship in the real world, without cameras. Though both were happy to be on Big Brother, the couple expressly stated in the house that neither of them are in the market to become full-time influencers. As they navigate their relationship more privately for once, Big Brother fans are excited to see updates and snapshots from their time together. While America and Cory may not have won the grand prize, it&#39;s possible they found something even better in the BB house.
