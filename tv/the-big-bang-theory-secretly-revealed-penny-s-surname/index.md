## Literature Review
The Big Bang Theory ended without confirming Penny&#39;s last name, but as it turns out, the sitcom already secretly revealed it back in season 2!




The mystery of what Penny&#39;s last name is on The Big Bang Theory remained even when the show ended. However, as it turns out, the show had already secretly revealed it very early on. As the only female character from the original sitcom, Kaley Cuoco&#39;s character Penny appeared in all twelve seasons of the CBS popular show. Although she seemed to stand out from her nerdy group of friends, she went through tremendous personal growth throughout those years becoming one of the most popular characters in the series.




After moving to California as an aspiring actress, Penny experienced years of failed auditions and disappointing acting roles, eventually prompting her to give up on her Hollywood dreams. When season 8 started, she became a pharmaceutical sales representative working with Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Despite her initial hesitation, she gradually rose through the ranks and appears to be perfectly content by the end of The Big Bang Theory. After all, both her personal and professional lives turned out great. While the show gave her a mostly satisfying ending with the revelation that she was expecting with Leonard, there is one mystery that the sitcom never outwardly resolved: the question of her last name.

Penny&#39;s last name has been a pressing The Big Bang Theory query for years, and many expected that the finale would finally answer it. Unfortunately, despite the clamor for the detail, the showrunners decided to keep it a secret and maintain public curiosity even after the sitcom bowed out. Aside from this, they may have also come up with the decision because they have already revealed the information during the very early years of the show.

As spotted by u/Quell_Alma on Reddit, in The Big Bang Theory season 2, episode 18, &#34;The Work Song Nanocluster,&#34; Penny&#39;s last name was Teller before she became a Hofstadter. In the episode, Penny Teller started a new business making flower barrettes and called it &#34;Penny Blossoms.&#34; At one point in the Big Bang Theory episode, Sheldon delivered a package of her materials, and in an easy-to-miss moment, her full name was shown printed on the box.

The significance behind her last name remained uncertain, but Penny Teller&#39;s first name was decided even before the pilot for The Big Bang Theory was retooled to add Howard and Raj, with the show&#39;s planned title being Lenny, Penny, and Kenny. The producers, however, decided to change &#34;Kenny&#34; to &#34;Sheldon&#34; to pay homage to one of the most prolific TV producers — the late Sheldon Leonard who was behind a string of hit series, most notably The Dick Van Dyke Show.

Considering how Penny Teller sounds, it may have been a reference to American magicians Penn &amp; Teller. Interestingly, Teller appeared in The Big Bang Theory playing Amy&#39;s father in the final season of the show, and Penny pointed out how the Fowlers&#39; dynamic was similar to her and Leonard&#39;s.

Did The Showrunners Intend For The Name To Be Such A Mystery?
          

While Penny Hofstadter was revealed to be Penny Teller in The Big Bang Theory Season 2, fans wondered if this was intentional. Such a huge TBBT mystery was created surrounding Penny&#39;s surname that it&#39;s surprising producers would let that Season 2 reveal go unchecked. Regardless, Penny&#39;s last name changed from &#34;Teller&#34; to &#34;Hofstadter&#34; towards the end of the series when she and Leonard got married.

What&#39;s curious with this incredible spot is whether The Big Bang Theory producers even remember including this detail back in season 2 (and forgetting the name would be on-brand given that Penny seemed to forget her own dad&#39;s name in TBBT&#39;s early seasons). At that point, though, the show was still starting to find its groove and build its fan base. When asked repeatedly, people involved in the show either claimed that Penny&#39;s last name was a secret or that they didn&#39;t have anything set in stone.

The Show&#39;s Propmaster Was Responsible For The False Reveal
          

Thanks to the publishing of The Big Bang Theory: The Definitive, Inside Story of the Epic Hit Series by Jessica Radloff, fans now know that Penny’s last name is not Teller, despite the shot of the package in the show. The book combines interviews with the cast and crew with stories from the set to give fans more information than they may have had about the show in the past. Some of that information directly addresses Penny’s last name on The Big Bang Theory.

According to executive producer Steve Molaro, the props team simply needed to put a name on the package in order for the label to look like a standard shipping label. It couldn’t be left with just Penny’s first name, or it wouldn’t appear like a real label. Molaro went on to explain, “We didn’t sanction it, we didn’t write it, and we didn’t intentionally put it in there.” He stressed that the name wasn’t canon and that the team behind the show had decided to never reveal her surname. In fact, they didn’t even have a last name in mind for Penny.




Propmaster Scott London revealed in the book that Bill Prady, co-creator of the series, offered up the name Teller for the label, but that it didn’t have a specific meaning for the show, and in fact, they never thought fans would be able to see the words on the label on camera. London had even previously used his own last name as a placeholder in early designs for props.

According to series star Jim Parsons, Penny’s last name was London in early scenes that included her mail. Parsons said, “We all found it amusing in a charming way that the propmaster had given her his last name.” Fans who truly want to know Penny’s last name in The Big Bang Theory might be disappointed that there isn’t one in canon.
