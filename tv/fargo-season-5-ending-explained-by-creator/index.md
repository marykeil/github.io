Summary

  The Fargo season 5 finale explores the theme of forgiveness in a world marred by polarization and mutual injury.   Dot emphasizes that taking risks is part of life and that forgiveness is necessary to move past the feeling of sin and guilt.   The tense conversation between Ole and Dot ultimately ends surprisingly.  







Series creator and showrunner Noah Hawley explains the Fargo season 5 finale ending with Ole Munch and Dot. After surviving a harrowing ordeal at the hands of her former husband Roy (Jon Hamm), Juno Temple’s Dot got the happy ending audiences were hoping for in season 5’s last episode “Bisquik,” as she watched her one-time abuser go to prison while she herself got to return to her family. But Fargo seemed ready to pull a tragic twist when, a year after the events at Roy’s ranch, Sam Spruell’s terrifying Ole Munch showed up at Dot’s door looking for revenge.

Fargo season 5 had one last surprise in store, however, as rather than resort to violence, Ole and Dot talked it out - with a little help from Bisquick - and came to an understanding that allowed both of them to move beyond their differences. Showrunner Hawley has now spoken out to explain the reason he elected to go with forgiveness instead of bloodshed at season’s end. Check out what he had to say below (via Variety):





Where it ended up for me was struggling with this question that a lot of us are struggling with, which is how are we going to get past this polarization and this sense of mutual injury? I landed on the idea of forgiveness, which Dot is saying to Munch, “Look, you took a job, and the job had risk and you can’t be mad at the risk. I was just trying to save my life so I could be a mother to my children.” They reach this place, and it’s a very tense back and forth over many minutes as to whether he’s going to harm this family or she’s going to win out. And in the end, she wins out, because she tells him that there’s forgiveness there for him and that he feels dirty because all he’s been doing is sinning for a long time, and now all he feels is the sin. She says, “Well, yes, we can be made to feel that way. But the only way to move past this is you gotta forgive yourself and be forgiving.”



 Fargo Season 5’s Ole Munch Twist Was The Show’s Biggest Surprise 
          




Fargo season 5 delighted in subverting expectations from the very beginning. It started with the surprise of Temple’s seemingly mousy Dot turning out to be a hardcore survivalist. More character twists came later, as in the case of Jennifer Jason Leigh’s Lorraine, a seemingly cold-blooded business person who became an unlikely ally to Dot. Even Dave Foley’s apparently slimy lawyer, Danish Graves, turned out to be a good guy in the end.

But no Fargo season 5 character proved a bigger surprise than Spruell’s Ole Munch. A menacing and seemingly heartless killer with a bizarre backstory, Munch repeatedly demonstrated the philosophical depths lurking beneath his terrifying exterior. It was therefore a perfect moment when the season’s two most complex characters, Munch and Dot, were the ones who proved capable of digging deep within themselves to find forgiveness, and end the show’s season-long cycle of violence.



Fargo season 5&#39;s finale seemingly confirmed Munch&#39;s immortal nature.







Munch indeed went against his own code, a code built upon the concept of debt, when he chose forgiveness in the end. For Hawley, this act plays into Fargo season 5’s themes about the current polarized state of the world, and the apparent hopelessness of finding common ground. Whether the ending really landed thematically can be debated, but Ole and Dot’s final scene proved effective from a narrative point-of-view, giving a roller coaster season one last surprising, and weirdly heartwarming, twist.
