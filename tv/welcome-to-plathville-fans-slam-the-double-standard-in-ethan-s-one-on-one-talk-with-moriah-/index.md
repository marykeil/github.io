# Welcome To Plathville Fans Slam The Double Standard In Ethan s One-On-One Talk With Moriah  


## SUMMARY 



  Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Ethan is facing backlash for preaching a double standard in a conversation with Moriah.   Fans notice the show&#39;s double standard in how Ethan&#39;s request for a one-on-one talk is accepted, while Olivia&#39;s similar request with Micah is criticized.   Olivia&#39;s experience with Ethan&#39;s family shows a pattern of them ganging up on people, and her attempts at closure or confrontation are seen as pushy.

## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville fans are over the way Ethan Plath speaks about women, especially when it comes to the hypocritical stance he takes about Moriah.




Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Ethan Plath is getting slammed by fans after a one-on-one talk with Moriah Plath where he preached a double standard that not even his biggest supporters could ignore. Ethan, who&#39;s in the midst of a difficult divorce with Olivia Plath, has had a rough road in getting back onto speaking terms with his siblings after they publicly disowned his wife. Ethan&#39;s brother, Micah Plath, spoke out about the idea of clearing the air with Olivia in an episode of Welcome To Plathville season 5, sharing he wasn&#39;t interested in talking to his sister-in-law. While Micah&#39;s disinterest was valid, fans have noticed a double standard on the show.




In a Reddit post by user u/MrsMelodyPond, the author discussed the double standard surrounding Micah&#39;s wishes versus Moriah&#39;s when Ethan demanded they have a conversation to clear the air. &#34;Why didn’t this sub give Ethan the same hard time for wanting a 1-on-1 convo with Moriah they did for Olivia wanting the same with Micah,&#34; the user asked, explaining that Ethan &#34;didn’t really ask permission but told her they needed to go talk alone. So they did.&#34; Rather than criticizing Ethan for asking the same way Olivia did with Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Micah, Moriah was expected to conform.


 Olivia And Micah&#39;s Relationship Breakdown Explained 
          

While Olivia and Ethan have split, many factors led to their decision to divorce including the way Ethan&#39;s family treated Olivia throughout their marriage. According to Reddit user u/Chickachickawhaaaat, Olivia has spoken out about the way the Plath family tries to ensure they&#39;re never alone in a conversation. &#34;Everything Olivia says about how the Plaths like to &#34;gang up&#34; on people seems true,&#34; u/Chickachickawhaaaat said. &#34;Even Moriah acted like she was scared of Ethan and tried to bring their dad.&#34; When Olivia tried to meet with Micah, the only other person available was Ethan, and he explained that he&#39;d rather &#34;chill&#34; than try to repair his relationship with his sister-in-law.





 

While Ethan and Olivia&#39;s marriage may be over, the way the Plath family tries to handle confrontation hasn&#39;t changed in the wake of their divorce. In seeing that Olivia approached Micah in the same way that Ethan approached Moriah, it&#39;s clear that the tactic works for the Plath family when executed by a man. When a woman tries to reach out for closure or confrontation, however, they&#39;re looked at as being pushy or unreasonable. The Welcome To Plathville stars have all been complicit in treating Olivia as though she&#39;s lesser than for years, and the direct proof of her interactions with Micah shows that it&#39;s been incredibly tough for her.

Although Welcome To Plathville season 5 has ended, the cast has already spoken up about their work on Welcome To Plathville season 6. As Olivia and Ethan&#39;s lives change, the couple has chosen to continue working on the series despite their marriage being over entirely. Olivia, who hasn&#39;t shared much about her involvement in the upcoming season of Welcome To Plathville, may not be able to sort through all the complicated emotions she has surrounding the Plath family, but it appears she&#39;ll at least be able to have some public closure with the family.
