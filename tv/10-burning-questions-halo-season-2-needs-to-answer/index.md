## Literature Review
Halo season 1 left a lot of questions unanswered, but hopefully, season 2 will unravel the show’s biggest mysteries and fix some problems.




Halo season 1 left a lot of questions unanswered, but hopefully, season 2 will take the time to address them. While the video games take place when humanity’s conflict with the Covenant is already an ever-present struggle, the TV adaptation is set before the conflict has even begun. As a result, most of the show’s story arcs and characters have been slow to gain adequate traction.
Even if its first season is off to a slow start, one of the adaptation’s saving graces is that its characters have potential. With Halo season 2 on the way, showrunners have renewed agency to further develop them and continue the franchise’s origin story. If season 2 manages to fill in the blanks left by Halo season 1&#39;s ending, the show can massively improve upon its divisive debut.











 








 10  Will Halo Season 2 Cover Reach&#39;s Destruction? 
Reach Has Already Fallen To The Covenant In The Halo Video Games
        

Considering all that happened in Halo season 1 and the trailer for its second season, the series is poised to cover the most pivotal event in Halo’s timeline: the fall of Reach. The planet’s demise deals a crippling blow to the UNSC, decimating the majority of its Spartan forces, and catalyzing the franchise’s central conflict between humans and the Covenant. In the games, the Covenant left Reach unscathed only because its location was unknown, but with Makee working for the enemy, the Covenant should have all it needed to invade. Reach’s destruction is mandatory if showrunners intend source fidelity, but whether it will happen in season remains to be seen.





 9  Will Season 2 Feature The Halo Array? 
The Halo Games Center Around A Conflict Over The Halo Array
        

Halo’s characters have yet to encounter the Halo Array, but the show has all it needs to finally get them there. Season 1 teased its characters making it after Makee obtained a star map, but when she and Master Chief both sustained lethal injuries, their chances of reaching the Array plummeted. Accessing the Halo Array would reveal critical information for the UNSC, including the history of the Forerunners and the existence of the Flood. If they can extract the necessary information from the Cortona-controlled Master Chief or figure out how to leverage their keystones to obtain the coordinates, season 2 may center on the eponymous rings.





 8  Will Soren And Kwan Ha See Each Other In Season 2? 
Kwan Ha Is An Original Character In Halo’s TV Adaptation
        

When Kwan Ha and Soren part ways toward the end of Halo season 1, Kwan Ha suspects she’ll see Soren again, but the question remains whether or not that’ll happen for them in season 2. While Soren returns to lead the asteroid colony of Rubble, his future relationship with the UNSC might change now that Dr. Halsey has been outed for her inhuman practices. Meanwhile, Kwan Ha chose to remain on Madrigal and continue her role as her people’s protector. Season 1 laid the foundation for a dynamic friendship between the two characters, but season 2 may struggle to reunite them while they develop individually.





 7  Where Does Madrigal&#39;s Portal Lead? 
In The Halo Games, Portals Lead To Forerunner Installations
        

One massive question mark from Halo’s first season centered on Madrigal’s portal and where it leads. Based on the video games, it’s likely the portal links to Halo rings or Forerunner Shield Worlds. The games dive deep into the lore of the ancient alien race of the Forerunners. At this point in Halo’s timeline, however, the Forerunners are far less known. The planet of Madrigal consists of more than one mystery, but their connection to the Forerunners may well be their best-kept secret. Considering the importance of the alien race to Halo’s lore, it would not be surprising if Madrigal played a major role in the show moving forward.





 6  Did Kwan Ha Encounter Real Magic On Madrigal? 
Madrigal Could Be The First Account Of Magic In Halo
        

When Kwan Ha returns to Madrigal to rekindle her father&#39;s rebellion, she encounters a settlement of mystics and experiences visions thanks to an unknown concoction. The technologies in the Halo video games have always pushed the boundaries of believability, but they have also been firmly planted in scientific advancement, space exploration, and intergalactic conflict. If these mystics indicate that magic exists in Halo’s universe, subsequent seasons need to address how it’ll work in the franchise. More to point, they need to explain why its obvious advantages are not explored and utilized in the video games since they take place much later in the timeline.





 5  What is Dr. Halsey Planning? 
Catherine Halsey Is Miranda Reyes’ Mother


 







When Dr. Catherine Halsey uses a clone to sidestep her execution, the UNSC is left questioning the real Dr. Halsey’s whereabouts. Justly tried and sentenced at the end of Halo’s first season for a host of reprehensible activities, it wasn’t much of a surprise the real Halsey managed to escape. However, the season also alluded to that she may have allies from within the UNSC or even with another faction entirely. While Dr. Halsey was already a significant threat on her own, the possibility that she isn’t working alone means that the series’ protagonists will have their work cut out for them in season 2.





 4  Will The Spartans Rebel Against The UNSC? 
Spartans Are Classically Stoic Thanks To Their Emotion Inhibitors
        

The UNSC is noticeably darker in Halo&#39;s TV adaptation, and when they unearthed several of Dr. Halsey’s reprehensible projects–including the emotion inhibitors implanted in UNSC’s Spartans, several members expressed understandable outrage at their mistreatment. Although the Silver Team’s Riz and Vannak remain shackled to their inhibitors, Dr. Halsey&#39;s betrayal forces them to question their jobs and loyalty. They even begin considering having the inhibitors removed after reflecting on their interactions with Master Chief and Kai. While Master Chief is consistently portrayed as an all-business sort of character in the video games, it wouldn’t be surprising for the UNSC to experience some fallout with the Spartans moving into Halo&#39;s next season.





 3  Was Makee Really Killed? 
Makee Falls In Love With Master Chief


 







Makee’s death at the end of Halo season 1 was more than a little anticlimactic, and considering the build-up for her character, it wouldn’t be surprising if she turned up in season 2. As a series original, Makee shoulders a remarkably complex background. Despite her hatred for humanity and allegiance to the Covenant, however, her connection to Master Chief has plenty of momentum to help develop her character even further. Moreover, her connection to the welfare of the planet of Reach, her involvement with the conflict between the Covenant and humanity, and her ability to communicate with Forerunner technology are all mysteries that still need to be solved.





 2  What Will Happen To Master Chief Now That He&#39;s Controlled By Cortana? 
Cortana Is UNSC Artificial Intelligence Created By Catherine Halsey


 







At the tail end of Halo’s first season, Master Chief sacrifices himself to protect the Silver Team and orders Cortana to assume control of his body, with consequences season 2 needs to explore. Since Master Chief acquired knowledge that could lead the UNSC to finally reach the Halo Array, it stands to reason they will do what they can to ensure he retains some of his faculties. On the other hand, the Master Chief from season 1 may be forever lost. As sad as that possibility is, it could explain why his personality is so different in the show when compared to how stoic he is in the games.





 1  Is There A Reason Cortana Didn’t Kill The Prophets? 
The Prophets Wield Absolute Power Over The Covenant
        

Cortanas’s battle prowess defies expectations, so when she takes control of Master Chief’s body to decimate Covenant soldiers, secure the Forerunner keystones, and effortlessly rescue the Silver Team, her decision to leave the Prophets unscathed is something of a headscratcher. In the video games, Covenant Prophets lead the high council of Covenant forces, with some games specifically focusing on finding and killing them. Taking even one of them out would be a huge victory for the UNSC. Because of this, Halo season 2 will need to explain why Cortana chose not to engage them, and should also explore the consequences of the Prophets remaining alive.
