## Literature Review

Married At First Sight season 9 star Beth Bice accused her estranged husband Jamie Thompson of stealing one major item from her in recent posts.




Married At First Sight season 9 star Beth Bice may have felt hopeful about her marriage to Jamie Thompson originally, but after recent events she’s happier than ever that they’re splitting up. Fans may remember Beth and Jamie from Married At First Sight season 9, where they were matched up by the experts and chose to get married sight unseen. The couple were a strange match from the beginning of their time on the series, but they did their best to make their marriage work despite some difficult circumstances. While both Beth and Jamie were hoping that their relationship would continue to grow after MAFS season 9, things weren’t easy.




In a story from Beth’s Instagram (via Monsters &amp; Critics), she opened up about her impending divorce more than she has in the past. While Jamie has been the one keeping fans up to date on what’s happening between himself and Beth, she’s been a bit quieter, choosing to keep things private until after the legal proceedings are finished. On her story, Beth answered someone asking if she regretted doing MAFS, “There are no mistakes, only [discoveries]. I discovered I should have ran when 3 ex[es] reached out and told me to run. Maybe I would still have my car.”


 Beth Bice Can’t Go Into Details Until Divorce Is Finalized 
          

In another story from Beth’s Instagram, she explained that she can’t go into details about her divorce until after everything is finalized, just in case her ex tries to take any sort of legal action against her. “Are you comfortable sharing what happened between you and Jamie?” Beth was asked, and she responded with a calm, “No, not until all legalities are handled. But it’s super messed up.” Beth’s response clarifies that she’s taking the mature route by ensuring the legal side of things is handled before she opens up about a trying time in her life. Though MAFS fans are looking for answers, Beth’s explained they’ll have to wait.





 

Beth and Jamie’s relationship may have had a difficult ending, but it’s been an odd match from the very beginning for the couple. Their time on the series was full of dramatic highs and difficult lows, leaving fans shocked when they decided they wanted to stay together after Married At First Sight season 9 to continue working on their relationship. The pair had some sweet moments with Jamie even re-proposing to his wife long after they’d already been married, but after four years together they decided it would be best for them to separate. While the details behind their split aren’t known, it appears to have been dramatic.

The success rate for Married At First Sight is notoriously low, and with Jamie and Beth’s relationship ending, their statistic is another loss for the series. While the experts do their best to make fulfilling connections for their participants, it’s not always possible to create successful matches in the time allotted or with the information given. For Jamie and Beth, things clearly were difficult both during and after Married At First Sight, but the couple worked hard to see their relationship through regardless of the outcome.
