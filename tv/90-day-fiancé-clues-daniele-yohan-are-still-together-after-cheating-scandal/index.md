## Literature Review
Yohan Geronimo cheated on Daniele Gates with at least six different women during their marriage. Did the 90 Day Fiancé star stay married to him




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Daniele Gates and Yohan Geronimo could still be together after his shocking cheating scandal has been revealed. Daniele is a 43-year-old New Yorker who met Yohan, 33, while she was with her family on a vacation in the Dominican Republic. Daniele bumped into Yohan at the hotel where she was staying since he worked as a dance instructor and gym trainer there. Daniele couldn’t resist the tall and handsome Yohan, so they got married within five months. Yohan wished to move to the U.S. on a spousal visa, but Daniele relocated to the Dominican Republic.




Daniele suspected Yohan would probably dump her after getting a green card. She started seeing many red flags after they started living together. While Daniele expected Yohan to provide for their household, he wanted Daniele to pay for everything. Yohan openly stole money using Daniele’s ATM card and felt it was his right to do that. In a recent episode, Yohan decided he couldn’t stay with Daniele anymore after she asked him to pay 75,000 pesos towards their expenses. He kept saying he had nothing, but Daniele soon found out a shocking secret about Yohan.

 Yohan Cheated On Daniele With Multiple Women 

 

Daniele made a shocking revelation during 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, episode 21 (via Entertainment Tonight). It had been a month since Yohan officially moved out, and it was her last day in the apartment. Daniele was going to be hosting a retreat there, so she had to figure out where she wanted to live. “I don’t want anything to do with Yohan,” Daniele exclaimed before telling the cameras about how a woman who had been in a relationship with Yohan for two years wrote to her on social media. The woman had been talking to Yohan a month before Daniele married him. 




She wanted to know if Daniele and Yohan were getting divorced and informed Daniele that she had met Yohan’s father and nephew and even gave them money. “She had sex with him for all these years,” Daniele revealed. Daniele mocked the woman for deciding to contact her as if she were doing Daniele a favor. The mistress also gave Daniele a “play-by-play” of their relationship and described everything in detail. She met Yohan on Christmas Eve while Daniele was giving gifts to his family. Daniele never thought Yohan was capable of something like this.

It dawned on Daniele that she didn’t know who Yohan really was. He left his computer in the apartment before he left, so Daniele started digging to retrieve more information on his affairs. She found “evidence” of other women that he’d been in relationships with and was intimate with. She said there were at least six different women that she knew had an inappropriate relationship with Yohan. These were women he had either reached out to and asked for money or had video conversations with. He had made plans to meet them while telling Daniele he was broke.






 Daniele &amp; Yohan Have Split Before To Get Back Together 
         

Daniele said she tried calling Yohan multiple times after the fight to have a conversation with him, but he refused to talk to her. She even sent him a naughty picture he had sent to one of the women on Christmas Eve. He told her, “Oh, like I did, I don’t remember.” Daniele said she wanted nothing to do with Yohan anymore and felt foolish because she should have seen his true colors from the start. Daniele and Yohan had a public split while filming the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4 Tell-All. Daniele claimed they were only “technically” married when asked about the status of their relationship.

She said they were struggling because Daniele met her ex-boyfriend Taylen Alexander, against Yohan’s wishes, when Taylen came to the Dominican Republic. Even though Daniele swore there were no romantic feelings involved, Yohan was frustrated with Daniele and Taylen’s friendship. Daniele was also slammed during the Tell-All for bossing Yohan around. She explained that if Yohan wanted to be the man of the house, he had to pay the bills, and she’d have no problem with taking up the housewife role. Yohan and Daniele’s arguments escalated as he threatened to end the marriage with Daniele over trust issues.




Yohan was bothered by Taylen’s presence, so he told Daniele, “When the lease is up, she goes her way and I go mine,” insisting their relationship was over. “I don’t want to be with Daniele anymore,” said Yohan before adding he didn’t care about her anymore. While fellow cast members thought Yohan was kidding and not really breaking up with Daniele during the reunion, he was serious. However, Yohan and Daniele returned for the next season as if nothing had happened. Daniele revealed they’d gone through couples therapy to try and fix the issues between them.



 Yohan Was Seen On Daniele&#39;s Instagram In July 2023 
          

Daniele and Yohan were together, at least on camera, when 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way premiered in July 2023. However, their social media pages hinted at a split. Daniele had removed all of Yohan’s photos from her Instagram page, and Yohan did the same. Considering Yohan moved out of Daniele’s apartment in December 2022, it made sense for them to have been living separately half a year later since the show is not in real-time.




Interestingly, Daniele accidentally revealed her current relationship status on Instagram. Yohan appeared in the background of a video she posted on Instagram in July 2023. Daniele captioned it, “I love my M.I.L. (mother-in-law).” The video showed Yohan eating something in front of her. “They made me repost it without sound,” Daniele added in the caption of her now-deleted clip.



 Daniele Is Refusing To Remove Yohan&#39;s Name Tattoo 
          

Daniele has a lot of beautiful tattoos on her body, but one of them is also a constant reminder of Yohan. Daniele was sporting a tattoo in her 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way scenes, which she could have gotten after getting married to the personal trainer. Daniele did not have it while she starred in 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise. The tattoo is massive and extends from her inner left arm to her wrist. It reads Yohan’s first name in cursive font. Fans agreed it was a bad idea when she didn’t have faith in their relationship to begin with.




They expected Daniele to regret getting the tattoo when she found out about the multiple women Yohan cheated with. Some fans wondered why Daniele didn&#39;t get the tattoo removed a full year after Daniele kicked Yohan out of their apartment. Daniele posted a photo of her arm to show the tattoo on her Instagram Stories. She wrote, “Sorry, guys – I actually think this is one of my prettier tattoos” and declared that the tattoo was not going anywhere, which may confirm Daniele decided to give Yohan another chance.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
