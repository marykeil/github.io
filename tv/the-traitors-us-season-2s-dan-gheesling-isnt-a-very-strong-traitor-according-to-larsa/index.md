## Literature Review

On The Traitors US season 2, Larsa Pippen correctly called out Dan Gheesling for being a Traitor. Now she criticizes his style of gameplay.




The Traitors US season 2 Faithful Larsa Pippen correctly suspected that Dan Gheesling was a Traitor, and she now implies that she doesn&#39;t think he was the best choice for the role. At the second round table discussion, the Faithfuls banded together against Maksim Chmerkovskiy for what they thought was his shady behavior. However, Larsa thought that they were on the wrong track. She, along with MJ Javid, voted for Dan to be banished because they thought that his quiet demeanor was very suspicious. Larsa was especially determined to banish a Traitor because her boyfriend Marcus Jordan had just been murdered by them.




In an X Post, The Traitors US season 2 star Larsa responded to X user @cslaw08, who called her &#34;one of the best strategic players&#34; for figuring out that Dan was a Traitor. Larsa wrote, &#34;Ya he was too relaxed,&#34; referring to Dan&#39;s laidback personality.


 

In a separate X post, Larsa replied to @keshi926, who shared a screenshot of Dan looking shocked with the caption, &#34;When Larsa Pippen &amp; MJ clock you as a Traitor in the first 3 episodes.&#34; She wrote, &#34;Yep I knew it,&#34; with a weary face emoji.

 Larsa Pippen Voted To Banish Dan Gheesling 
          

Larsa suspected that Dan might be a Traitor, and she spoke up about it at the second banishment. She said that even though she loved Dan and thought he was amazing, something about his energy and calmness made her uneasy. She admitted that he had a demeanor about him that scared her. Larsa stated that she knew that Dan was a great gamer. She thought that he could be &#34;a killer.&#34; Dan replied by saying, &#34;I can do a better job of talking to you, but that&#39;s my personality. Like I&#39;m just generally more quiet. Like there&#39;s not a ton I can do about that, but I can do a better job of, you know, talking to you.&#34; 

Larsa was correct about Dan being a Traitor, but she was unable to convince the majority of her fellow Faithfuls to spare Maks and go after Dan instead. Larsa was also correct that Dan was too relaxed in his role as a Traitor. This was especially true when he left the murder in plain sight up to Parvati. He could&#39;ve used the opportunity to try to murder Larsa or MJ himself. In fact, Larsa&#39;s name wasn&#39;t even mentioned as a potential murder victim by Dan. By letting her live to see another day, he allowed her to possibly continue to plant seeds of doubt about him in the other players&#39; heads.




It&#39;ll be interesting to see if Larsa is able to eventually convince her fellow Faithfuls that Dan is a Traitor. She&#39;s one of the few who&#39;s been brave enough to forge her own path so far on the show, not voting with the majority at the second banishment. Fueled by her desire for revenge after her boyfriend Marcus&#39; murder, Larsa could be the reason that Dan&#39;s identity as a Traitor is uncovered. He&#39;ll have to murder her before he banishes him. The Traitors US season 2 is really starting to heat up.

The Traitors US season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
