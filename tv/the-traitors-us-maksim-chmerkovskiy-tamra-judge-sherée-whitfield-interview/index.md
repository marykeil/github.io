## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2&#39;s Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Tamra Judge, &amp; Sherée Whitfield shared all about their experiences on the devious reality TV series.




The Traitors US season 2 brought together a group of Bravo’s finest, including The Real Housewives of Orange County&#39;s Tamra Judge and The Real Housewives of Atlanta&#39;s Sherée Whitfield, along with other reality TV personalities like Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who chatted with Screen Rant about their participation in the series. Despite dealing with drama on their own shows, Maks, Tamra, and Sherée’s time on The Traitors US season 2 was nothing like they experienced in the past. Though The Real Housewives franchise is likely the most dramatic on reality TV, there doesn’t seem to be anything that can truly prepare even the most seasoned reality star for The Traitors US.




Tamra comes from RHOC, one of the earliest iterations of The Real Housewives franchise, and has worked hard in her time as a reality TV veteran to find her authentic self throughout the drama. Sherée, who’s been a part of RHOA on and off since its debut in 2008, has dealt with her fair share of drama throughout her time on the series. Even Maks, who has been a professional ballroom dancer since childhood and has fulfilled the role of professional teacher on Dancing With The Stars throughout its 20-year run.

While they all discussed the issues they experienced in the game differently, each of The Traitors US season 2 cast members shared they were happy with the experience they had on the show. Even with its difficulties, The Traitors US seems to have bonded its cast members in a way that transcends the genre of reality TV they’re on, having built lasting relationships.




Screen Rant: Just to get started – if you could come back into the game fresh, would you want to be a Traitor or a Faithful? 


Tamra Judge: A traitor, for sure.
Sheree Whitfield: I’d definitely want to be a traitor, going back in.
Maksim Chmerkovsiky: Yeah, I’d be a traitor. I think if you’re not a traitor, it’s like, how long will you last before they kill you, and that’s it.
Sherée Whitfield: The traitors have such an advantage, period.


Screen Rant: I’ve gotten a mixed bag of answers today on that, who’d want to come back as a Traitor, and who’d want to come back as a Faithful.


Sherée Whitfield: Oh, really? 
Maksim Chmerkovsiky: [laughs] Now wait a minute, spill some tea for us, what’d you get?


Screen Rant: I’ve been sworn to secrecy there, so I’ve got to keep quiet! But going into the show itself – Sherée and Tamra, you come from a high-drama franchise, with your backgrounds, did you feel prepared coming into this game where it was going to be tremendously dramatic all the time?





Tamra Judge: I thought that I did! Andy Cohen had told me, ‘Tamra, you’re going to be great! You’ve trained for this your whole career,’ and I thought, okay, great…but there’s no preparation you can do to get you ready for this show. It is a mind f-, for sure.
Sherée Whitfield: Yeah, for sure – I thought I did some research and just coming from Real Housewives and dealing with the cattiness, the shadiness, when you come from that you’re thinking this is kind of [going to be easy]. It’s a show of deception, we should be ready.
Tamra Judge: Housewives is a different type of deception! Like you show your cards and you say what you feel – in this, you have to think, you have to watch, you have to make calculated decisions that aren’t always right…it’s a different game.


Screen Rant: The strategy of it is so different.





Tamra Judge: Exactly.


Screen Rant: Now Maks, you’re coming from a very different competitive background. Did you feel like your time in the ballroom circuit or on Dancing With The Stars gave you any advantages or disadvantages in the game?


Maksim Chmerkovsiky: Well, first of all I’m a little offended that you said they’re high drama – what is Dancing With The Stars if not high drama?


Screen Rant: You know, the ballroom is a dramatic place.


Maksim Chmerkovsiky: After 32 seasons on the air, we’ve definitely had some drama. But like I said before, I’m a dramatic person on Dancing With The Stars, I was also cast by someone who’s really good at their job to be a piece of the puzzle of the 21 of us who fit very well together. [The Traitors US season 2 cast] can be dramatic together, and also personality-driven in a lot of ways. In general, I really enjoyed the format of the show. Whoever [came up with] this product was brilliant, it’s a brilliant show that’s very interesting. I would recommend it to anybody – any kind of celebrity or not, I would say to go and do this. It’s different, it’s a lot of fun. I had a great time.
Tamra Judge: For sure.





Screen Rant: I would imagine it really tested your patience.


Maksim Chmerkovsiky: But it also throws other things in place, you need to let go of certain things that you’re comfortable with and take on some other things that you’ve never [dealt with] in your life. I found myself at my age, with [my family and responsibilities], my professional life, in a summer camp for three and a half weeks in a group of people that I never would’ve been in the same room with. We were all in one castle and for twelve hours a day, we just spent time together – it’s brilliant. And the game that comes out of it? You go into this situation thinking you’re going to drink and have fun, and they sit you down and say, let’s play a game of mafia. You’re like, what? And then you leave the house and you’re like, this is the most fun I’ve had in a long time.
Tamra Judge: [laughs] Right? Exactly. It was like childbirth.





Screen Rant: A rave review! Last question for you all, if you could pick someone from your franchise to be on a future season of The Traitors US, who would you want to see as part of the game?


Tamra Judge: I think that I would pick Emily [Simpson of The Real Housewives Of Orange County]. I think she’s smart, she’s an attorney, she knows how to be calculated and I think she would do a great job.
Sherée Whitfield: Similarly, I would say Kenya [Moore of The Real Housewives Of Atlanta]. 
Maksim Chmerkovsiky: Bruno [Tonioli, longtime judge of Dancing With The Stars], I would say Bruno. If you ask me any question from my franchise, I give Bruno as an answer to everything. Because that room needs to experience Bruno at some point, so I’ll throw him in there. He’d definitely enjoy himself.
