## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville season 5 has shown Kim Plath falling for Ken Palmer, but many are questioning the timeline of her allegedly new relationship.




Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Kim Plath may be in a new relationship after divorcing her husband Barry Plath, but many are concerned about the timeline of her relationship with Ken Palmer not adding up. Throughout Welcome To Plathville season 5, Kim has been getting used to her life outside of her marriage to Barry. Kim has been working hard to ensure she&#39;s moving on from her marriage quickly, and has even introduced her new boyfriend Ken to Welcome To Plathville despite their short relationship. While some have wondered why Kim is so comfortable with someone she recently started dating, others are curious if the relationship is as new as she claims.




Reddit user u/Afraid-Carry4093 posted a poll for Welcome To Plathville fans to weigh in, asking, &#34;do you think Kim started the affair with Ken before the separation from Barry?&#34; The poll&#39;s margin between the different responses is jarring. Roughly 85% of the votes cast state that viewers do think Kim began an affair with Ken before her separation from Barry, with some voters taking their reasoning into the comments. u/One-Revolution-9670 explained Kim may have felt like she needed a backup plan, sharing, &#34;she’s very insecure at her core. I don’t think she would jump without another branch within reach.&#34;


 Kim Plath &amp; Ken Palmer’s Relationship Explained 
          

Although Kim and Ken&#39;s connection reportedly began on Welcome To Plathville, many have questioned the beginnings of their relationship on the series, hoping to gain an understanding of how the couple actually met and got together. There was a scene on Welcome To Plathville of Kim and Ken meeting, but many feel it was fabricated considering Isaac Plath was taking flying lessons from Ken at the time. Reddit user u/Dasherjb007 explained it makes sense to, &#34;check the timeline to see when Isaac began taking his flying lessons with Ken. Kim may gotten involved when they decided to buy the plane.&#34; 





 

Kim and Ken may have gotten together outside the scope of Welcome To Plathville, but the couple&#39;s journey has still been featured heavily on the series. While Kim came from her marriage to Barry and into her relationship with Ken, he hasn&#39;t been single for much longer than she has. Ken came out of a serious relationship in 2021, parting ways after just a year of marriage with his ex-wife. For Kim and Ken, their past relationships have been a source of pain. Regardless of how genuine their connection is, it appears that they&#39;re helping each other get over the past and move into the future.

It&#39;s possible Kim began her relationship with Ken while she was still married, but without confirmation on Welcome To Plathville season 5, it may be impossible to truly know. Kim, who seemed to be happy to move on from Barry and start a life with someone new, may have been looking for someone that felt like a safe place to land after leaving a decades-long relationship. While it wouldn&#39;t be the first time someone had another relationship lined up so they felt prepared to exit their initial one, it would be surprising to see someone who claims to be as picture-perfect as Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Kim make such a decision.
