## Literature Review
A scorned Below Deck Sailing Yacht cast member seemingly disses Jean-Luc Cerza-Lanaux on Instagram for a terrible mistake that he committed. 




Jean-Luc Cerza-Lanaux from Below Deck Sailing Yacht is getting shamed on social media by a cast member with whom he has a long-running feud. Jean-Luc, also known as JL to Below Deck season 2 fans, is a deckhand who worked alongside Gary King and Sydney Zaruba. Jean-Luc was the youngest crew member during Sailing Yacht season 2, which premiered in March 2021. The crew was surprised by how tall Jean-Luc was. He was reported to be around 6’9”. However, Jean-Luc’s height is not what he is best remembered for. He had a relationship with second stew Dani Soares, and the relationship turned sour after the 33-year-old Dani announced she was pregnant.




Jean-Luc, who was just 24 years old at the time, denied he was the father back then but later confirmed that Lilly Rose was his daughter and agreed to co-parent her with Dani. Interestingly, Dani is now seemingly dissing Jean-Luc on Instagram.

          

She shared cute pictures of her daughter on her Instagram Stories while the caption subtly took aim at Jean-Luc. “All we need for Christmas and always is us my girl cause that’s all we have anyways,” Dani wrote. “Can’t even imagine not even wishing you a Merry Christmas. You’ll be more than fine tho cause I’ll always be here to give you and be everything you need,” she added.

 Dani Soares &amp; Jean-Luc Cerza-Lanaux Drama Explained 
          

Dani continued, “I love you more than you’ll ever understand.” The second photo showed little Lilly opening her gifts. Dani exclaimed that Lilly loved opening the presents more than she enjoyed the presents themselves. Dani didn’t explicitly mention Jean-Luc in her Instagram Story, but her message was easy to understand for those aware of the drama between her and Jean-Luc. The man has been busy sharing photos of himself with his girlfriend Jen P. He reposted a photo that his girlfriend @Jenniferisintown posted of them together where she called him her “best gift.” Jean-Luc and Jennifer have dated for over a year. Dani had announced she was expecting her first child in April 2021.


 




Dani had alluded to Jean-Luc being the father during Sailing Yacht&#39;s reunion episode. The baby was apparently conceived during the season while they had cameras 24/7 on them. Dani said she had only slept with “one guy.” According to Dani, she had received a message from Jean-Luc saying, “Don’t go around telling people I’m the dad of this child,” when she was four months pregnant. Meanwhile, Jean-Luc had accused Dani of being hungry for her 15 minutes of fame until he confirmed that he is the father of his former co-star’s baby in January 2022.

Back then, Jean-Luc wanted his daughter to have both her parents in her life. He claimed that he and Dani were working and communicating together to the best of their ability, given Dani was a full-time mother and worker, and he was gone for extended periods of time, not knowing when he would step back on land. However, Dani’s Instagram update confirms that Below Deck Sailing Yacht&#39;s Jean-Luc has remained absent from his daughter’s life and may have been looking for his own 15 minutes of fame when he admitted that Lilly was his child.
