## Literature Review
1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton is growing tired of the negativity her social media posts attract, and she&#39;s done keeping quiet about it.




In an emotional TikTok video, Tammy Slaton, star of 1000-Lb Sisters, opened up about hurtful social media comments and their lasting impact on her self-confidence. Already having lost over 350 pounds, Tammy&#39;s weight loss journey is still something she&#39;s actively navigating. Critics are quicker to point out Tammy&#39;s perceived weaknesses than celebrate her success. However, the reality TV-turned-social media star has a breaking point despite trying to stay positive.




A nasty comment on a recent video the 1000-Lb Sisters season 5 star shared on TikTok inspired a vulnerable video response from Tammy herself. In it, she embodied two sides of a coin, one in which her feelings have been hurt and the other in which she found strength despite the unkindness of others.


 

When asked about the extra skin on her neck and a recent change in her voice, Tammy was open as she explained, &#34;My &#39;gobbler&#39; will get removed when my doctors say I&#39;m ready to. I haven&#39;t started plateauing yet. You people make me feel so insecure sometimes about it.&#34; Tammy followed up by saying she&#39;s &#34;worked so hard&#34; and is &#34;proud of herself&#34; but ultimately still feels &#34;ugly.&#34; Tammy noted that she&#39;s starting to feel prettier even with extra skin from her significant weight loss, but it does not happen overnight.





 Tammy Slaton Explains Why She Sounded Out Of Breath Recently 
          

Addressing being &#34;out of breath&#34; in a recent video, Tammy shared that she wasn&#39;t trying to &#34;belt out&#34; a song due to having company at her house and not wanting to disturb them. As the comment mentioned, she sounded like something was &#34;stuck in her throat.&#34; Tammy explained that she was trying to respect her family, who was sleeping. Tammy often films videos of herself on social media, doing everything from answering questions and singing some of her favorite songs to setting up &#34;duets&#34; with followers. On any given day, her comments section can hold messages of positivity and pride to notes of frustration and mean-spirited remarks.

Tammy has always been more vocal when responding to commentary she receives from 1000-Lb Sisters, but it seems to be unrelenting and crude more often than not. Despite spending much of the TikTok video in tears, when Tammy spoke of the pride she feels in herself, some of that fire inside of her was noticeable again, proving that she might get knocked down, but she&#39;s certainly not going to stay there. She addressed the rude comment on her TikTok further and found herself able to do so quite powerfully, ending the video on a positive note.

Tammy hasn&#39;t just faced struggles with those who watch 1000-Lb Sisters and follow her on social media; she&#39;s also been learning to navigate ever-changing bonds within her circle of family and friends, which has proven to be challenging more often than not. Despite dealing with love and criticism from everyone in her life, Tammy finds ways to keep her head above water in tough seasons and looks for the silver lining as often as possible. Tammy&#39;s journey alongside her sister Amy Slaton on 1000-Lb Sisters will see more ups and downs in their story, but Tammy is healthier now than she has been in years, which she should feel very proud of.




1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
