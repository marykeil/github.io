## Literature Review
The Good Doctor season 7 will be the end of the popular ABC medical drama starring Freddie Highmore as the savant surgeon Shaun Murphy.




The Good Doctor season 7 will mark the end of the medical drama. Originally premiering in 2017, the popular ABC series follows Freddie Highmore as Shaun Murphy, a young autistic surgeon with savant skills who works at the prestigious St. Bonaventure Hospital in San Jose. The Good Doctor cast also includes Richard Schiff, Christina Chang, Will Yun Lee, Fiona Gubelmann, Paige Spara, Noah Galvin, and Bria Samoné Henderson. Since its premiere, the medical drama has been one of the network&#39;s longest-running and most-watched shows.




Now, as announced by a new ABC promo, The Good Doctor season 7 will mark the end of the medical drama. Watch the promo below:


 

The promo confirms that &#34;after six incredible seasons,&#34; The Good Doctor will &#34;say goodbye&#34; with its upcoming season 7, &#34;the farewell season.&#34; Highmore, ABC executive Craig Erwich, and the show&#39;s executive producers David Shore, Liz Freidman, and Erin Gunn shared the following statements on the show ending with season 7:


Highmore: Playing Dr. Shaun Murphy has been an immense privilege and one of the most remarkable and rewarding experiences of my life. I will always be grateful to David, Liz, and Erin as well as the hugely talented – and lovely – cast, writers, and crew who made this show possible. Caring deeply is what got us here. Thank you to Sony and ABC, and to everyone who has watched along at home. With love from Vancouver… tequila, stat!
Erwich: Thanks to David Shore and Liz Friedman’s creative direction and anchored by Freddie Highmore’s performance, The Good Doctor has captivated audiences, who have deeply connected with Dr. Shaun Murphy and the staff at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. As we prepare to finish this beloved story, words cannot express our gratitude for the incredible cast, crew and our partners at Sony and ABC Signature for the lasting impact they’ve made.
Shore, Friedman, and Gunn: The Good Doctor has been a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it’s time to say goodbye. We are incredibly proud of the work we’ve done and the message we’ve been privileged to be a part of. We look forward to giving our fantastic fans, the truly extraordinary Freddie Highmore, the rest of our talented actors (and friends), and the best crew in the business the series ending that you all deserve. Thank you, Sony; thank you, ABC; thank you all.





                  The Good Lawyer: If It&#39;s Still Happening, When It Could Relase &amp; Everything We Know   The Good Doctor spinoff show The Good Lawyer has been in development for a while. Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s known about the show and if it&#39;s happening.    


 What To Expect From The Good Doctor Season 7 
          

For six seasons, The Good Doctor has chronicled the complex life of Highmore&#39;s Dr. Shaun Murphy and the many challenges, successes, and milestones for the character, and his colleagues, in the fast-paced world of medicine. However, the supporting cast has seen a lot of turnover over the years. Schiff, who plays Shaun&#39;s mentor Dr. Aaron Glassman, is the only other series regular who has remained on the show since season 1.

Other than Highmore and Schiff, The Good Doctor season 7 cast also includes Gubelmann as Dr. Morgan Reznick, Lee as Dr. Alex Park, Chang as Dr. Audrey Lim, Spara as Lea Dilallo, Henderson as Dr. Jordan Allen, and Galvin as Dr. Asher Wolke. In addition, original cast member Chuku Modu, who returned midway through season 6 to reprise his role as Dr. Jared Kalu, has once again been promoted to series regular for the final season. Audiences should also probably expect more surprise appearances from fan-favorite characters.




In terms of season 7&#39;s story, the last season ended on several significant cliffhangers, which should be addressed early on. Shaun and Lea will bring their newborn baby home and adjust to parenthood. Meanwhile, St. Bonaventure will have to deal with two major departures – Dr. Andrews resigned from his position as hospital president and Dr. Perez left to seek support for recovery from opioid addiction. As is generally the case with final seasons, The Good Doctor season 7 should be the most dramatic yet.



The Good Doctor season 7 premieres February 20 on ABC.
