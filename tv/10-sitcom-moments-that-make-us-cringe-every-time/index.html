  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>&ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Tots&rdquo; episode of The Office is one of the most cringeworthy sitcom moments, as Michael embarrassingly breaks a promise to pay for students&rsquo; college tuition.
Ross trying to kiss his cousin Cassie in Friends is uncomfortable and creepy, regardless of their biological relationship.
Liz mistaking Stewart for a child in 30 Rock is cringeworthy, especially when she lies about ruffling his hair to get his attention.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There are countless cringeworthy moments in the best sitcoms of all time, but some scenes stand out as being almost impossible to watch.</p>
<p>There are countless cringeworthy moments in sitcoms, but some stand out more than others, for better or worse. Situational comedies allow for all manner of potential instances to happen, and while they are very funny, there are times when the humor is lost, and the scene is just plain uncomfortable. While these cringeworthy moments are often memorable for years to come and can be found in some of the best TV shows of all time, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they&rsquo;re difficult to watch.
Of course, some of these moments are cringeworthy on purpose. Cringe comedy has become such a popular genre in recent years, with the likes of comedians such as Nathan Fielder seeing huge success with cringe-humor-focused shows, like Nathan For You and The Curse. Over the years, there have been many notable moments in sitcoms, but some are forever memorable just because of how difficult it is to watch them, from The Office&rsquo;s funniest episodes to forgotten Friends scenes.</p>
<p>10  Scott&rsquo;s Tots
The Office</p>
<p>The Office</p>
<p>Release Date    March 24, 2005     Cast    Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski     Seasons    9</p>
<p>While there were plenty of cringeworthy moments in The Office&rsquo;s 9-season run, the season 6 episode &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Tots&rdquo; easily ranks as number one. Although Michael&rsquo;s (Steve Carell) intentions did come from a good place, watching him embarrassingly push through the performance of the group of high schoolers he promised to pay college tuition for was just painful. On top of Michael&rsquo;s stretched-out downfall, the kids&rsquo; rap makes the entire scene even more cringeworthy, and his reactions to them telling him that they were going to &ldquo;make their dreams come true&rdquo; cause the level of uncomfortableness to skyrocket.</p>
<p>9  Ross Tries To Make A Move On His Cousin
Friends</p>
<p>Friends</p>
<p>Release Date    September 22, 1994     Cast    Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer     Seasons    10</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons why the Friends season 7 episode &ldquo;The One with Ross and Monica&rsquo;s Cousin&rdquo; is cringeworthy, but it is specifically Ross&rsquo; (David Schwimmer) interactions with his cousin Cassie (Denise Richards) that make it so bad. Her appearance comes in the follow-up to the wedding of Monica and Chandler (Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry), and after Ross points out how much Cassie has grown since they were children, he becomes attracted to her and eventually tries to kiss her while they watch a movie.
It&rsquo;s just plain weird that Ross would try and make a move on a member of his family.</p>
<p>Although Cassie was clearly stereotypically attractive, it&rsquo;s just plain weird that Ross would try and make a move on a member of his family. Regardless of whether Cassie was a biological relation of his or not, Ross&rsquo; attempts to be intimate with her are just plain creepy and make him look desperate. At this point in the timeline, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) had just fallen pregnant with Emma, and although Ross wasn&rsquo;t aware of this, it still shows how unusual his actions were.</p>
<p>8  Liz Thinking Stewart Was A Child
30 Rock</p>
<p>30 Rock</p>
<p>Release Date    October 11, 2006     Cast    Tina Fey , Alec Baldwin , Tracy Morgan , Jane Krakowski , Jack McBrayer , Scott Adsit , Judah Friedlander , Katrina Bowden , Keith Powell , Lonny Ross     Seasons    7</p>
<p>For the majority of 30 Rock, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) often had trouble finding and keeping a solid relationship. Motivated by the idea of becoming a mother, Liz started obsessively interacting with kids in public, so it&rsquo;s just cringe when she spots Stewart (Peter Dinklage) in the street and thinks he&rsquo;s a child. To make matters worse, when she realizes he is, in fact, an adult man, Liz creates an uncomfortable lie that she only ruffled his hair to get his attention. While Liz Lemon&rsquo;s interactions with her love interests were generally quite awkward, this moment simply cannot be excused.</p>
<p>7  Amy&rsquo;s Heated Reaction To Zack
The Big Bang Theory</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory</p>
<p>Release Date    September 24, 2007     Cast    Kaley Cuoco , Johnny Galecki , Jim Parsons , Melissa Rauch , Mayim Bialik , Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg     Seasons    12</p>
<p>When Amy Farrah Fowler (Mayim Balik) was first introduced in The Big Bang Theory, she was essentially supposed to be a female version of Sheldon (Jim Parsons). However, this changes as her character develops, and although still similar, one big difference between the two is that Amy is sexually motivated. Although this did allow for some of Amy Farrah Fowler&rsquo;s funniest moments, her first meeting with Penny&rsquo;s (Kaley Cuoco) ex-boyfriend Zack (Brian Thomas Smith) saw some of her oddest behavior in the show&rsquo;s 12-season run.
While Amy&rsquo;s entire conversation with Zack is uncomfortable, her owl noises are what makes this moment so cringeworthy altogether.</p>
<p>Of course, it was great to see the woman expressing her needs without feeling embarrassed, but she unfortunately takes it too far by voicing her attraction by hooting like an owl. Although Amy lacked the social knowledge she needed for this kind of interaction, she wasn&rsquo;t completely isolated from other people, so she should know better. While Amy&rsquo;s entire conversation with Zack is uncomfortable, her owl noises are what makes this moment so cringeworthy altogether.</p>
<p>10 Best Big Bang Theory Episodes, Ranked
The Big Bang Theory has 12 seasons’ worth of great episodes, but the best ones feature hilarious jokes and emotional moments that leave a mark.</p>
<p>6  Mac&rsquo;s Exercise Bike
It&rsquo;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</p>
<p>Release Date    August 4, 2005     Cast    Charlie Day , Rob McElhenney , Kaitlin Olson , Glenn Howerton , Danny DeVito     Seasons    16</p>
<p>Although the series generally uses cringe humor purposefully, one of the most cringeworthy moments in It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia comes from the season 12 episode &ldquo;Hero or Hate Crime?&rdquo; The episode covers the topic of the contexts of using hate speech but also saw the moment that Mac (Rob McElhenney) came out as gay. This time, Mac decided to stay out, having previously gone back and forth on this detail of his life multiple times throughout the show.
Although it was, ultimately, a wholesome moment for the character, it only happened because of the reveal of Mac&rsquo;s exercise bike. The bike, which came with a sex toy seat attachment, then became an integral part of the gang&rsquo;s argument with the arbitrator they&rsquo;d hired. While none of the gang believed his reasoning that it was simply for exercise and nothing else, Mac&rsquo;s insistence on explaining himself, and then a demonstration of how he used the bike, made the scene painful to watch and tarnished what should have been a big moment in Mac&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>5  Leslie&rsquo;s Night Of Bowling
Parks And Recreation</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation</p>
<p>Release Date    April 9, 2009     Cast    Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&rsquo;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe     Seasons    7</p>
<p>Leslie (Amy Poehler) was always stubborn, but she managed to push boundaries farther than ever in the season 4 episode &ldquo;Bowling for Votes.&rdquo; In the depths of her campaign for City Council, she quickly becomes obsessed with one man from a focus group, Derek (Kevin Dorff). Leslie&rsquo;s cringe behavior begins with a passing comment Derek makes, which results in her organizing a bowling night, wanting to seem approachable and relatable to voters.
This episode sees Leslie constantly attempting to try and win the man over, with little luck. One of the harsh realities about Leslie Knope is her determination, which serves as both an advantage and hindrance to her, but her need to try and get Derek to like her is just awkward. Leslie&rsquo;s inability to accept that not everyone will like her never seems to end, and is simply uncomfortable, even when Ben (Adam Scott) tells her this repeatedly.</p>
<p>4  J.D And Carla&rsquo;s Kiss
Scrubs</p>
<p>Scrubs</p>
<p>Release Date    October 1, 2001     Cast    John C. McGinley , Robert Maschio , Donald Faison , Christa Miller , Neil Flynn , Judy Reyes , Aloma Wright , Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Sam Lloyd , Ken Jenkins     Seasons    9</p>
<p>Scrubs&rsquo; most cringeworthy moment is such because of how out of character both J.D (Zach Braff) and Carla (Judy Reyes) are. The two completely platonic friends end up sharing a kiss after J.D. comforts Carla because of the issues she&rsquo;s facing in her marriage with his best friend, Turk (Donald Faison). While they both downplay the kiss, immediately knowing it didn&rsquo;t mean anything to either of them, it still feels weird that it happened.
J.D. would have never done anything to hurt Turk; it&rsquo;s a cringeworthy scene and Scrubs would have been better without it.</p>
<p>Even though they were drunk, there&rsquo;d never been any attraction between the two of them. Carla would have never cheated, especially given that her issues with Turk sprouted from him lying to an ex about being married, and J.D. would have never done anything to hurt Turk, even though his old friend once slept with his college girlfriend. Although it was a brief story that didn&rsquo;t cause any significant impact in the end, it&rsquo;s still a cringeworthy scene and Scrubs would have been better without it altogether.</p>
<p>3  Afternoon Delight
Arrested Development</p>
<p>Arrested Development</p>
<p>Release Date    March 15, 2019     Cast    Jeffrey Tambor , Ron Howard , Michael Cera , Alia Shawkat , David Cross , Jason Bateman , Portia de Rossi , Tony Hale , Will Arnett , Jessica Walter     Seasons    5</p>
<p>Arrested Development saw its most cringeworthy moment happen twice in the same episode. While the Bluth Company celebrates Christmas with an office party, Michael (Jason Bateman) believes that his bond with his son, George Michael (Michael Cera), is suffering. This leads him to sing karaoke with Maeby (Alia Shawkat), who is also moping over Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) abandoning her for the afternoon, and the two sing &ldquo;Afternoon Delight&rdquo; by Starland Vocal Band. What starts as a sweet moment between an uncle and niece quickly grows painful to watch, as with each lyric, Michael realizes just how inappropriate it is.
What makes this instance even more uncomfortable is Lindsay and George Michael&rsquo;s reaction. The two become so focused on Michael and Maeby spending time together that Lindsay decides to try and make them jealous, and they leave the party before they can see everything unfold. Later in the episode, while attending yet another Bluth Christmas party by the banana stand, Lindsay and George Michael decide to perform the same karaoke song, going through the same awkward realization Michael had, and doing so in front of the same group of people who&rsquo;d seen it happen earlier that day.</p>
<p>2  Jess Finds Out Robby Is Her Cousin
New Girl</p>
<p>New Girl</p>
<p>Release Date    September 20, 2011     Cast    Zooey Deschanel , Max Greenfield , Hannah Simone , Damon Wayans Jr. , Lamorne Morris , Jake Johnson     Seasons    7</p>
<p>New Girl&rsquo;s Robby (Robert McFerrin) was a recurring character from season 2, so his relationship storyline with Jess (Zoey Deschanel) in season 7 made the moment the two find out that they&rsquo;re related even more uncomfortable. Not only is it weird enough that Robby also dated Cece (Hannah Simone), but initially, Jess also doesn&rsquo;t feel anything for him. However, in the episode &ldquo;The Hike,&rdquo; the two realize that their similarities in both preferences and personalities are because they are third cousins, and they awkwardly split up.
It seemed like an odd choice for writers to include this, especially as Robby had already been a part of the show for a while and his relationship with Jess spanned multiple episodes. Jess was also seen being close with her parents at several points, so the fact she didn&rsquo;t know Robby was a member of her family doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. Although their split resulted in the eventual reunification of Jess and Nick (Jake Johnson), this cringeworthy moment means that Jess will always be remembered as someone who dated their cousin.</p>
<p>1  Jake&rsquo;s Roleplay With The Medical Examiner
Brooklyn Nine-Nine</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</p>
<p>Release Date    September 17, 2013     Cast    Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio     Seasons    8</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that throughout Brooklyn Nine-Nine Jake (Andy Samberg) made some unusual decisions, but his relationship with medical examiner Dr. Rossi (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) stands out as one of his worst. Before Jake got together with Amy (Melissa Fumero), his attempts to woo women were odd, but his roleplay with the doctor responsible for criminal autopsies saw her career weed its way into their intimacy. Jake pretending to be a dead body was just plain creepy, and even though nobody was hurt in the process, nor any actual corpses being used, the entire premise was just cringeworthy.</p>
