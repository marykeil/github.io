 8  Holly &amp; Wayne Have Been Staying Separately For Four Months 


 







Holly wished to “trauma bond” with her fellow cast members in the green room before filming. Then, at the start of the Tell All, host Shaun Robinson turned to Holly to ask her how long she has been living in America. Holly tells her it has been four months. Wayne tells Shaun that it hasn’t been fun for him living alone without Holly in South Africa. He also revealed that they’ve lost a lot of contact. Wayne called the situation a bit strange. In the Part 2 preview, Shaun asks Wayne if Holly has abandoned their marriage. Wayne takes a long pause and reveals that she has.





 7  Kimberly Called Jenny A &#34;C***&#34; 


Meanwhile, Kimberly brought all her bad vibes to the set and 90 Day Fiancé cast members witnessed her nasty personality in person. Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh were invited as guests during Kimberly and TJ’s segment, and Jenny called out her fellow American for saying, “I hate India.” Jenny spoke about Kimberly, not appreciating how amazing TJ’s family was to her. Kimberly told Jenny that her opinion didn’t matter to her. Jenny told Kimberly, “Respect India or don’t be here.” Kimberly replied, “I don’t want to” and kept giggling. When Jenny called her an entitled spoiled brat, Kimberly told Jenny she was a “c**t.”





 6  90 Day Fiancé Stars Kalani, Tim, Andre, And Tania Joined The Tell All 


 







While the previous Tell All had a live audience, this time, the Tell All has invited older cast members on set, and the group includes Kalani Faagata, Tania Maduro, Tim Malcolm, and Andre Castravet. Shaun says that these seasoned 90-dayers have gone through their own 90 Day Fiancé journeys where they have dealt with heartbreaking infidelity, overbearing family members, traveling to other countries, etc. Shaun mentions that Tim, Kalani, Andre, and Tanya all have “some connection” to the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couples.





 5  Kimberly &amp; TJ Are Still Together 
        

Kimberly and TJ reached a breaking point in the finale where she begged him to understand her as she went through depression. “You are depressed of your own reason, not because of me,” TJ had told Kimberly before their argument turned into a screaming match. Kimberly let out a blood-curdling scream 90 Day Fiancé fans won’t forget for a long time. However, when Shaun turned to the couple for a relationship update and asked Kimberly if she was still staying in the apartment above TJ’s family home, she said, “Yes, I&#39;m still living in the apartment.” However, Kim’s recent Instagram updates reveal she’s been in the U.S. since September 2023.





 4  90 Day Fiancé Cast Slammed &#34;Control Freak&#34; Sarper 


Shekinah and Sarper were called out for their moments on the show that rubbed 90 Day Fiancé viewers the wrong way. A scene showing Sarper weighing Shekinah played for the cast to see. They also saw Sarper calling Shekinah a “s**t” and a “b***” in front of her sister. In one scene, Sarper takes a lollipop from Shekinah’s mouth and throws it on the floor. Kalani says that Sarper talking to Shekinah like that is “disrespectful” and that doing it in front of her sister is “also super disrespectful.” Daniele commented that the lollipop would have been “up his a**” if she were to be in Shekinah’s shoes.
Meanwhile, Sarper said that he’s not weighing Shekinah anymore because she’s in good form. He said he is a “control freak” who wants her to eat what he wants. Shekinah admitted that if she doesn’t have some sort of control over her, she feels like the person doesn’t care about her.





 3  90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Shekinah Has Cut Ties With Family 
        

The producers reached out to Shekinah’s sister, Shariyah, to join the Tell All, but she revealed she’d had a falling out with Shekinah. She instead sent a video message where she said that Sarper is not a good partner for her sister because he is not honest and doesn’t respect women. Shekinah calls her family negative and unsupportive. She reveals she’s not been talking to anyone from her family since the show. Shekinah has cut contact with six of her sisters and even her mom, and it’s all because of her relationship with Sarper.





 2  Julio Claims Kirsten Cheated On Him 
        

The biggest shocker from the Tell All was Julio and Kirsten’s interaction. While Julio and Kirsten split when he asked her to wait because he had family matters to heed to, during the reunion, he revealed that he did it because Kirsten was cheating on him with a friend. Julio claimed Kirsten deleted the conversation between her and her friend which he happened to “record.” Kirsten claimed she didn’t do anything with her friend when Tim suggested she could have mentally cheated on Julio. Julio now has a recording of him questioning her about her relationship with the unknown person to play for the audience.





 1  Daniele Reveals She&#39;s Still Separated From Yohan 


 







Daniele was previewed revealing more details about Yohan’s girlfriend. Daniele says the first time Yohan had sex with the woman was a month before he married Daniele. The woman sent Daniele a four-page email two weeks before she filmed the Tell All. The email detailed their relationship. Yohan, in turn, called Daniele a manipulator. He told her to “go to hell.” Daniele burst into tears and said, “What a ******* psycho.” As Daniele stepped onto the Tell All set, she admitted that her life has been a complete roller coaster ever since Yohan announced he wanted a divorce.
Daniele said she expected the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All to be a moment of vindication for her. She said she’d been the villain and Yohan had been a “piece of s***,&#34; so she wanted everyone to find out who Yohan really was. Daniele told Shaun that she is still separated from Yohan. In the preview for next week, Daniele revealed she walked into a very “unfortunate situation” when she came into her apartment after her trip to New York. She will be exposing Yohan for bringing women into the apartment the “whole time” and calling it his “wh*** hotel.”
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
