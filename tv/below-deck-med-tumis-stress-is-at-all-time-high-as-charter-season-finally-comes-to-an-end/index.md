## Literature Review

The preview of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 shows Tumi Mhlongo looking stressed as she prepares for three demands from “very difficult guests.”




Tumi Mhlongo looks tense in the Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 finale preview. The Below Deck spin-off has always had surprising moments. However, season 8 surpassed the older ones by featuring some of the most dramatic twists and turns in the franchise’s history. Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 started with a bang when Tumi arrived at the yacht and assumed her role as the chief stew. She had a major argument with fellow stew, Natalya Scudder, which turned into a full-blown rivalry. Drama queen Kyle Viljoen also caused many rifts between his crew, pushing Natalya to quit the show before her tenure was over.




Recently, Bravo posted the latest preview for the Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 finale. The sneak peek showed Tumi stressing out due to the pressure of the final charter. The clip starts with the popular Below Deck captain, Sandy Yawn, acknowledging why her chief stew is under immense pressure.


 

She says, “because we’re stuck at a dock, Tumi has the most pressure.” The captain reveals that Tumi had to organize a trip, create a foam party, and execute a “red carpet” theme dinner. The scene then cuts to Tumi, who states the whole thing is a test. She says, “these are very difficult guests and a difficult situation, and I’m responsible for all the activities.”

 Tumi Never Wants To Get Married After Witnessing Awkward Moment 
          

The preview clip also shows some awkward moments. The worst happens in the clip’s latter half when Tumi shares a cab with the guest couple. The scene shows the pair arguing due to trust issues as the popular Below Deck chief stew awkwardly listens to it all. In the next scene, she tells the cameras that the couple arguing in the van makes her “really want to never get married.” The following scene shows the couple disputing even more and debating returning to the United States. The camera cuts to Tumi, and she jokingly labels the guest pair as “a marriage contraceptive pill.”

Tumi has been part of some of the most dramatic moments on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8. When the South African stew joined captain Sandy’s yacht, she shared a big, explosive discussion with Natalya. The two ladies argued about the arrangement of dishes, which eventually became a heated argument. Tumi then gossiped with Kyle, who further caused problems between her and Natalya. In a later episode, Tumi and Natalya argued even more, which led captain Sandy to step in. She wanted the stews to act more maturely. Thankfully, Tumi never got fired for her unprofessionalism in some of the older episodes.




Tumi’s careless and unprofessional actions in Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 have made her controversial. Many people think she didn’t deserve the promotion captain Sandy gave her. Instead, they feel she was better suited for a standard worker role and not ready to be a manager like a chief stew. However, it’s still not too late. Tumi still has the time to redeem herself with the viewers. The chief stew needs to be bolder and show she can handle the stress. She needs to execute the final charter perfectly and fulfill all three of the main demands from Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 guests.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
