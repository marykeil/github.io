# Frasier Season 2 Story Tease From Kelsey Grammer Raises Question Of Major Show Change


## SUMMARY 



  Frasier season 2 may bring big changes for the character, potentially including a move out of Boston or a shift in his story arc.   Frasier&#39;s relationship with his grown-up son was a central focus in season 1, and their storyline has been resolved, allowing Frasier the freedom to leave Boston.

## Literature Review
Despite the Frasier reboot season 2 not being officially renewed yet, Kelsey Grammer seems to tease some big changes ahead for the psychiatrist.




Kelsey Grammer teases big changes for his character in the Frasier reboot season 2. The Frasier reboot season 1 finale properly wraps up Frasier Crane&#39;s first year back in Boston with an emotional Christmas-themed episode. Despite his increased wealth and history with the city, settling back on the East Coast wasn&#39;t easy for the beloved psychiatrist. That being said, it seems like there will be big changes heading Frasier&#39;s way in season 2.




Speaking with Fox, Grammer offers an update on what to expect from the Frasier reboot season 2. It&#39;s worth noting that Paramount&#43; has yet to officially renew the series, but despite that, it sounds like Grammer and his team are planning for a different direction for the character â€” whether that means him moving out of Boston or just a change in his story arc. Read his full quote below:


We&#39;ve got a bunch of really good ideas for it. It&#39;s nice to kind of be thinking about where he&#39;s going next.



 Why Frasier Needs Some Big Changes In Season 2 
          

Frasier&#39;s return to Boston was motivated by wanting to reconnect with his grown-up son, Freddy. What was supposed to just be a short visit turned out to be a permanent move after realizing the status of their relationship. Frasier and Freddy&#39;s relationship is the most important storyline in the Frasier reboot, culminating in the season 1 finale, which effectively resolved the show&#39;s main storyline. This gives Frasier the liberty to leave Boston knowing that he has patched things up with the younger Crane.




A relocation also resolves two other major issues, including his Harvard storyline. Despite being very rich, Frasier opted to take a guest lecturer job at his alma mater, which means that it becomes the secondary backdrop to most of the revival&#39;s episodes. Alan Cornwall&#39;s Nicholas Lyndhurst is great in the Frasier reboot, but other than him, it was one of the weaker parts of the season, potentially prompting some changes in the future. Finally, leaving Boston will also address the problem of Frasier not returning to Cheers.

Regardless of the specifics, it&#39;s clear that the Frasier reboot needs to make some changes to sustain a future. While the original show aired on a traditional network, streamers are quicker to pull the plug from shows that they don&#39;t think are worth the time and money. That is the worst thing that could happen to the revival, especially considering how great the original ending was.
