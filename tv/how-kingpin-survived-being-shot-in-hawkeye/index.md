# How Kingpin Survived Being Shot In Hawkeye


## SUMMARY 



  Kingpin&#39;s survival in Hawkeye suggests that he is physically stronger in the MCU than in Daredevil, leading to questions about his increased strength and how it contributed to his survival.   The fact that Kingpin appears to be physically stronger sets up the need for explanations in upcoming series like Echo and Daredevil: Born Again regarding how he managed to escape death and become more durable.   Kingpin potentially wearing bulletproof body armor in Hawkeye could be the key to explaining his survival, but it doesn&#39;t address his increased strength, which may be explored in Echo or Daredevil: Born Again. There is a need for more in-depth storylines in these projects to explain his physical power.

## Literature Review
Kingpin surviving being shot in Hawkeye is pretty confusing, as the street-level villain appears stronger than ever since he was seen in Daredevil.




Kingpin&#39;s return to the MCU in Hawkeye was entertaining to see, but it&#39;s fair to ask how he survived being shot by Maya Lopez in the finale. After finding out Kingpin was the perpetrator behind her father&#39;s death, Maya confronted the Marvel villain and appeared to shoot him directly in the face, as Lopez&#39;s weapon was heard firing off-screen after she pointed it at him. The upcoming Echo series confirms the return of Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Wilson Fisk, and set photos appear to show the street-level villain alive and well. With the shooting happening off-screen, it&#39;s clear that he would return unscathed at some point in the MCU timeline, but it&#39;s currently unknown what his exact fate in the show will be.




Audiences not being shown Kingpin&#39;s death was essentially a confirmation that Fisk would survive - and his confirmed appearances in future MCU projects only further solidified this. This makes the fact that Kingpin appears to be physically stronger in the MCU than when he appeared on Daredevil all the more interesting, as it suggests Fisk&#39;s increased strength and constitution could play a role in his survival, which sets up many questions that need to be answered in upcoming series like Echo and Daredevil: Born Again. Not only do viewers need to find out how Fisk managed to escape death in Hawkeye, but also how he&#39;s suddenly more durable than ever.

                  Wait, How Is Kingpin Alive In Marvel&#39;s Echo Show?   After Hawkeye, where he&#39;s shot at point-blank range, Kingpin was assumed dead, so how can he come back for the upcoming Disney&#43; Marvel show Echo?    


 How Echo Addresses Kingpin&#39;s Hawkeye Fate 
          




The answer to how Kingpin survived being shot isn&#39;t as convoluted as it may seem. The MCU has a tendency to revive dead characters or make it appear as if they have died, so it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that Wilson Fisk falls into those categories. In Marvel comics, a particular storyline shows Echo shooting Kingpin in the face, blinding him. Kingpin&#39;s MCU fate in Echo is a change from the comics because Echo footage that was shown at D23 Expo 2022 confirms the character will be wearing an eye patch instead of being made completely blind. This indicates that he&#39;ll have at least partial vision, and set photos from the series show him wearing a comic-accurate outfit without an eye patch. While flashbacks are likely to be shown, it&#39;s almost certain that Fisk will eventually heal from the shooting in Hawkeye.



 Is Kingpin Invincible In The MCU? 
          




 With Kingpin seemingly more powerful in the MCU than he was in Daredevil, it begs whether he&#39;s invincible. While fighting Kate Bishop in the Hawkeye finale, he ripped a car door off with his bare hands, survived being hit by a car, exploding arrows, and was finally knocked unconscious after hitting his head against a pillar. An average human being wouldn&#39;t be able to survive many of these injuries, but Fisk has always been portrayed in the comics and other media as overbearingly strong. Should this be incorporated into the MCU, it could tie more into Daredevil when Kingpin wore bulletproof body armor under his clothes. This could be the key to subtly explaining how Fisk is still alive.

Kingpin wearing body armor in Hawkeye would explain his survival, but it doesn&#39;t explain how it would make him stronger. Explaining this in Echo or Daredevil: Born Again could give a reasonable explanation as to how he became so physically powerful. Realistically, Wilson Fisk needs to have storylines in these upcoming projects that better explain his strength to make up for his shortchanged appearance in Hawkeye.
