## Literature Review

The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 has already been highly anticipated, and it managed to get even more exciting thanks to this character&#39;s return.




Season 3 of The Lincoln Lawyer has already generated a lot of anticipation, and it managed to get even more exciting thanks to the unexpected return of a key character. The Netflix series is loosely based on a set of novels by Michael Connelly and tells the story of recovering addict and criminal defense attorney, Mickey Haller. In order to get his life back on track, Mickey begins running his law practice out of the back of his Lincoln Town Car and takes on cases to help the people of Los Angeles.




The first two seasons were captivating, leading viewers to feel a void while waiting for season 3 of The Lincoln Lawyer to finally be released. Though a third season of The Lincoln Lawyer has been confirmed, there has not been an official release date provided to audiences. This has only contributed to the excitement surrounding the release, as anticipation continues to build surrounding it. And, following the release of the news that one very important character will be returning for season 3, it&#39;s unlikely that this buzz will die down anytime soon.

                  8 Burning Questions The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 Needs To Answer   The second season of Netflix&#39;s legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer left multiple burning questions open-ended, meaning that season 3 must answer them.   


 Neve Campbell&#39;s Return As Maggie Makes The Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 More Exciting 
          




Neve Campbell, who plays Maggie McPherson, was originally reported to have had scheduling issues that would prevent her from being a major character in season 3 of The Lincoln Lawyer. This was disappointing due to how prominent of a character Maggie had been in previous seasons and what her absence suggested about the future of her and Mickey&#39;s relationship. Luckily, though, it has now been revealed that Maggie McPherson will have a larger role in season 3 of The Lincoln Lawyer.

Season 3 images show Mickey and Maggie sitting on the couch together, drinking glasses of wine. These images are from flashback scenes that are present in season 3 of The Lincoln Lawyer. The reason for the flashbacks is that season 3 is based on the fifth book in Connellyâ€™s series, The Gods of Guilt. This book doesn&#39;t feature Maggie, which means that she most likely won&#39;t be able to appear in the present-day timeline. Incorporating her in flashbacks, however, allows her to continue to be a part of the show and proves her continued place in Mickey&#39;s life.

The revealed images for season 3 prove that the two had a loving relationship and the fact that Maggie is still a part of Mickey&#39;s life means that there&#39;s still hope for their relationship.
