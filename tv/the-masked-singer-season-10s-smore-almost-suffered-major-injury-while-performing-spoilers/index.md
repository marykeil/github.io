Summary

  S&#39;More, revealed to be Ashley Parker Angel, narrowly avoided a major injury while performing on The Masked Singer.   Ashley admitted that performing in the costume was sometimes terrifying, as he couldn&#39;t see well, and didn&#39;t know if he could get himself back up if he fell down.   Ashley had plans to perform a Green Day song if he made it to the finale, and hopes to come back for an encore performance.  







The Masked Singer season 10 Group A finalist, S&#39;More, was eliminated from the competition on Disco Night, and revealed to be singer, actor, and former O-Town member, Ashley Parker Angel, and he now reveals the mishap that almost resulted in a major injury while he was performing. As S&#39;More, Ashley competed against Gazelle and Cow in the Group A finals. However, he was the first of them to be unmasked. After the Battle Royale, Cow sailed through to the season finale, but panelist Ken Jeong decided to save Gazelle with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell, so she&#39;ll be joining him there.

In an interview with Deadline, Ashley revealed that, in his very first performance, when he sang, &#34;Slow Hands&#34; by Niall Horan, he nearly suffered a major injury. Ashley explained, &#34;I go up the stairs, and I tripped. I caught myself, but it really could have gone the wrong way, because I could have tripped off the staircase. There’s moments where you’re really close to the edge of the stage.&#34; Ashley admitted that there were times when he couldn&#39;t see out of his mask very well, &#34;so it’s a little terrifying.&#34; He confessed that he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d have been able to get himself back up because of the big costume.

In an interview with EW, Ashley shared that if he had made it through to the finale as S&#39;More, he &#34;really wanted to do some alternative rock, and we had talked about doing Green Day next, and I was going to either do &#39;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&#39; or &#39;When September Ends.&#39;&#34; Ashley explained that when he went solo after O-Town, he did an album that was &#34;very kind of alternative pop-rock … kind of naturally what I listen to a lot is pop-rock and alternative-rock.&#34; Ashley thinks it would be &#34;so fun&#34; for The Masked Singer to bring S&#39;More back for an encore so that he can perform a Green Day song.


 




Ashley&#39;s not the only Masked Singer contestant who had a mishap during a performance. Season 7 had several issues, including Duff Goldman accidentally knocking his McTerrier mask off of his head while trying to regain his balance when he almost fell off of the stage. As Firefly, Teyana Taylor appeared to be choking inside of her costume. She later revealed that the mask made it hard for her to breathe, and she had a panic attack. Also, Duane Lee Chapman (AKA Dog the Bounty Hunter) fell on stage when he attempted to do a high kick. Many other celebrities have spoken about how difficult performing in the costumes can be.

As S&#39;More, Ashley brought his incredible vocals and charismatic stage presence to The Masked Singer. It would&#39;ve been exciting to see him perform in the season finale, especially if he was going to sing something different such as a Green Day song. With his boy band, solo performer, and Broadway experience, Ashley really knows how to connect with the audience and give an amazing performance. It would be wonderful if the show went along with his idea to have him come back for an encore performance. Ashley both sweetened and heated up the Masked Singer stage as S&#39;More.




The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
