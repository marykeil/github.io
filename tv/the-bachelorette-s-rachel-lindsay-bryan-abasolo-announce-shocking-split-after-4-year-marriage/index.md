## Literature Review
The Bachelorette season 13&#39;s Rachel Lindsay and Bryan Abasolo announce that their relationship is over after being married for four years.




The Bachelorette season 13 couple Rachel Lindsay and Bryan Abasolo have announced the shocking news that they&#39;re getting divorced after more than four years of marriage. Rachel, a now-37-year-old attorney, television host, and sports team owner, first appeared in Nick Viall&#39;s Bachelor season in 2017. She broke ground as the first Black Bachelorette later that year when she starred in The Bachelorette season 13. Rachel and Bryan, a now-43-year-old chiropractor, had an immediate connection. She even gave him her first impression rose on premiere night. At the end of the season, Bryan proposed, and Rachel happily accepted. They got married in Mexico on August 24, 2019.




According to E! News, court documents show that Bryan filed for divorce from Rachel on January 2, 2024, citing irreconcilable differences. He listed New Year&#39;s Eve as the date of their separation. He also asked to be awarded spousal support. E! News also revealed that just two months ago, Rachel spoke to the outlet about her and Bryan&#39;s plans to expand their family. She said at the time that it was something they wanted, but &#34;it&#39;s been harder than I thought it would be. We&#39;re trying.&#34; Rachel also spoke about how whenever there was a rumor about a Bachelor Nation couple getting divorced, it would usually be about her and Bryan because they aren&#39;t public about their relationship.

In an Instagram post, Bryan addressed his split from Rachel, stating, &#34;If you&#39;ve been following me for a while, you know I don&#39;t like to put my personal affairs on social media and like to keep a safe space for our family. Many of you know me as a chiropractor, and also as a husband, my proudest role so far.&#34; He went on to acknowledge that their divorce was a &#34;difficult decision&#34; and they&#39;re ready to &#34;start anew.&#34; Bryan added, &#34;My parents have been married forever and I&#39;m a family man, but sometimes loving yourself and your partner means you must let go.&#34;


 

Bryan concluded his post by stating that he wanted people to hear about his and Rachel&#39;s divorce from him first &#34;before the blogs start making up their own reality.&#34; He also asked that people &#34;respect the spaces&#34; of their families and friends as they figure out their next steps. Rachel and Bryan have always been a very private couple, even though their relationship began in such a public way. It was truly a shock to hear that they&#39;d decided to get divorced, especially since they didn&#39;t seem to have any major problems as a couple.




Rachel and Bryan were one of four Bachelorette couples who got married after getting engaged on the show. The Bachelorette season 1&#39;s Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter, season 9&#39;s Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfriend, and season 12&#39;s JoJo Fletcher and Jordan Rodgers are still going strong. However, season 7&#39;s Ashley Hebert and J.P. Rosenbaum were the first couple from The Bachelorette to get divorced. They separated after eight years of marriage. It&#39;s very sad to hear that Rachel and Bryan are getting divorced, but they&#39;re wished all the best as they move on to this new chapter of their lives.
