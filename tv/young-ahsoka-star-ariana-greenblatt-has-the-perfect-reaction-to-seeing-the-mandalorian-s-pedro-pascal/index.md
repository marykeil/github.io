## Literature Review
Star Wars&#39; young Ahsoka Tano actress Ariana Greenblatt reacts to seeing The Mandalorian&#39;s Din Djarin actor Pedro Pascal at the Golden Globes.




Ahsoka&#39;s young Ahsoka Tano actress Ariana Greenblatt spotted a fellow Star Wars star, The Mandalorian&#39;s Pedro Pascal, at the Golden Globes - and she had the perfect reaction. Though no Star Wars projects were in the spotlight at the awards ceremony, quite a few Star Wars stars were present, including Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. Among them were Greenblatt, who attended for her role in Barbie, and Pascal, who was nominated for his role in The Last of Us. While these two actors may both be a part of the Star Wars galaxy, their respective portrayals of Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the Mandalorian Din Djarin haven&#39;t crossed paths, though the actors now have.




                  Upcoming Star Wars Shows: Story, Casts &amp; Everything We Know   Several exciting Star Wars TV shows are set to be released on Disney&#43; in the coming years from the realm of both live-action and animation.    

In a video shared by ireoispunk, Greenblatt is standing on the Golden Globes carpet with a tiny microphone when she spots Pascal walking behind her. She immediately lets out an excited &#34;Oh my God, Pedro Pascal!&#34; before taking another glance and adding, &#34;I love him!&#34; - with emphasis on the &#34;love.&#34; She adds one more disbelieving &#34;Oh my God!&#34; just to truly hammer home how much she adores her fellow Star Wars star.


 

Due to the timeline of Star Wars, it&#39;s unfortunately unlikely that Greenblatt and Pascal will ever cross paths in the Star Wars galaxy. Still, Greenblatt&#39;s own reaction to Pascal proves how much those who contribute to the galaxy far, far away truly do appreciate and admire one another. Greenblatt&#39;s wholesome, and relatable, reaction is nothing short of perfect, and certainly justified for the Mandalorian himself.





 Din Djarin &amp; Ahsoka Tano Will Always Make A Perfect Team 
          

While Greenblatt and Pascal may not be able to share a Star Wars scene together, there&#39;s no doubt that Ahsoka Tano and Din Djarin are one of the galaxy&#39;s best duos. Their team-up in The Mandalorian season 2 against Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth is nothing short of powerful, with Din&#39;s iconic line, &#34;A Mandalorian and a Jedi? They&#39;ll never see it coming&#34;, truly summarizing how effective this pair is. Though their next meeting is for the purpose of discouraging Din from reuniting with Grogu in the most heartbreaking way, there&#39;s no doubt Din&#39;s and Ahsoka&#39;s next team-up will be just as epic as the first one.

It&#39;s very likely the future of Star Wars will see plenty of interactions between Ahsoka and Din, especially with the upcoming The Mandalorian culmination movie event led by Dave Filoni. Ahsoka has just seen the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn to the Star Wars galaxy, and given that the end The Mandalorian season 3 has seen Din getting more involved in helping the New Republic&#39;s fight against Imperial remnants, there&#39;s no doubt the pair will work together at some point to eliminate Thrawn&#39;s threat. Until then, this wholesome moment between Greenblatt and Pascal can aid Star Wars viewers who are aching for more exciting, character-crossing stories in the coming months and years.
