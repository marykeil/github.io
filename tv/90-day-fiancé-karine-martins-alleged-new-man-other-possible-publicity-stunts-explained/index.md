## Literature Review

Former 90 Day Fiancé cast member Karine Martins is desperate for attention just like her estranged husband Paul Staehle who went &#34;missing&#34; in 2023.




90 Day Fiancé star Karine Martins has been away from the franchise for a while, but her publicity stunts with estranged husband Paul Staehle help her keep making headlines. Karine was around 20 years old when she started dating Paul, who was then aged 34. They were introduced in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1. Paul, who had gone to Brazil to meet Karine for the first time, had hidden his criminal record from her. They had a language barrier and Paul struggled to trust Karine. Karine had to take an STD test and a pregnancy test before they got intimate with each other.




Despite their troubling relationship dynamic, Paul and Karine got married and welcomed two sons Pierre and Ethan. They were deemed unfit parents after a video of Karine allegedly assaulting Paul was leaked online. Paul and Karine officially split and lost custody of their sons. Paul had allegedly kidnapped his son during their ongoing custody battle while he claimed he and Karine were back together, so they could get their children back. Paul was presumed missing and probably dead in September 2023 and later seen with Karine at Disneyland in October 2023. In January 2024, Karine announced she was engaged to her new baby daddy.

90 Day Fiancé fans watched Karine threatening to harm Paul in a violent Instagram update on January 13, 2024. Paul kickstarted the new year by wishing his wife congratulations on getting engaged to someone named Jonathan M Rueff. Meanwhile, Karine posted a screenshot of a recent permanent custody order about her and Paul’s son, Pierre, which showed Paul’s relative, Lindsay Tanner, being awarded custody of the child. Karine posted the results of a lab test for an STD panel in a different story. The report indicated that Karine had “tested positive for either one or both strains of the herpes virus.”

However, a few days later, Karine posted a screenshot of a Facebook profile of a man named Michael Rome Scoccola from Louisville, Kentucky. Karine added a message for Paul where she wrote, “This is my real fiancé and yes I am pregnant with his baby.” Karine asked Paul to “go f*** youself.” She wrote that the man in the photo was a “real man” who would “kill you if you f*** with me anymore!!!!” Fans who were not asking Karine to delete the update as it could affect the custody battle, someone wondered if Karine had been hacked.




It was Paul’s turn to post a story where he alleged the man called Mr. Scoccola was a mental health professional who was looking over Pierre and Ethan’s mental health in Jefferson County, Kentucky. Paul accused the man of providing Karine with “confidential information” about their children. Paul was “disgusted” that the man was 47 years old. He accused Karine of going to “any lengths and any means necessary to get information” on their children.



 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Karine Martins Asked Fans If She Should Have Sex With Paul Onscreen 
Karine Was Heavily Pregnant
          

Paul and Karine launched an OnlyFans account in January 2021 and promoted it with a controversial campaign. Karine was heavily pregnant back then with her second baby and was due to give birth in February 2021. Paul and Karine planned on making X-rated content for the platform and revealed that they were going to film themselves making love. At the same time, Karine also launched her solo OF page where her content could be accessed for free. Karine decided to ask her subscribers if they wanted to watch her having sex with Paul on OnlyFans. Karine created a poll where she asked her fans to vote if they were interested.




More than 800 people had voted yes in the poll, revealing the kind of demand her naughty content had among her fans. Several 90 Day Fiancé cast members reacted to Karine’s obnoxious request. While fans commented, “Hell to the no!!,&#34; and &#34;Wtf whyyyyyyyyyyy,&#34; David Toborowsky wrote, “Paul would lol” with several laughing emojis on a now-deleted post by @tote_the_memes.



 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Karine Martins Called Out Fans For Sending &#34;Hate Mail&#34; 
Karine Was The One Who Started Paul&#39;s Disappearance Rumors
         

On August 31, 2023, Karine shocked fans by posting a series of Instagram stories about her former husband Paul. Karine wrote, “Paul went missing last night in Brazil. Prayers he is found safe.” While Karine’s message created shockwaves among fans, her next few stories made it look like Karine was playing a dirty joke on the show’s viewers. Karine shared pictures of the breakfast sushi she ate and posted a photo of a wooden block with “live laugh love” written on it. Karine then updated fans that she had no idea about where Paul was and whether he was safe or not.




Karine explained that Paul’s Brazilian friend Izabele Medeiros was leading the search efforts to locate the 90 Day Fiancé star. Paul had been romantically linked to the 18-year-old woman after his split with Karine. However, Karine’s IG updates now got even more bizarre when she posted an emotional reel of photos showing Paul and their two kids captioned, “Not all of our memories were bad. Our children loved you very much. We will never forget you or the good memories we all shared.” Since it was written in the past tense and looked like a tribute video, fans assumed that Paul had died.

Moreover, Karine had also posted videos showing her cradling a baby bump, making viewers question whether she was pregnant with her third child. Meanwhile, Paul was reported to be alive and well after he reached out to a blogger to confirm the same. He sent the blogger a voice message saying his signal was bad, and he was in a small indigenous community. Karine posted a new IG story saying, &#34;Just want to let y&#39;all know that Paul showed up,&#34; before adding, &#34;I have nothing to do with this so don&#39;t send me hate mail.&#34; 90 Day Fiancé star Karine continued, &#34;I take no responsibility for this.&#34;






 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Karine Martins May Have Cooked Up &#34;Missing&#34; Scandal With Ex Paul Staehle 
Did Paul Really Go Missing &amp; Was Karine Helping Him?

 

Meanwhile, on September 3, 2023, Paul’s mother Mary also confirmed that Paul was okay and alive but not back out of the woods yet. She claimed her son had been in danger because he went to the wrong place at nighttime. Mary said the place was dangerous and 90 Day Fiancé star Paul freaked out when he found out about it. Paul had found a way to get back to a village and, while the villagers were treating him well, he was being eaten by bugs. At the same time, Paul was able to use the internet despite being stranded in a remote location.

Paul had deleted all his Instagram posts except two and reposted a video from January 2022 featuring his kids. Paul’s history of erratic Instagram updates made it easier for fans to believe that he may have faked his disappearance. Paul had been accused of being a clout chaser before. He was someone who sought attention for personal gains and exaggerated claims. Paul had contacted his mom in the U.S. when he was lost in Brazil, instead of contacting the authorities while he still had some battery left on his phone.




Then there were Karine’s cryptic posts which were the source of rumors about Paul being lost or dead. 90 Day Fiancé fans have often suspected that Paul has the login credentials to Karine’s social media, and he is the one who posts these absurd updates from her account. Paul himself could have shared the tribute post from Karine’s account along with the pregnancy videos, and even the insurance post while Karine was in cahoots with him for her share of attention. 90 Day Fiancé star Karine could have put her foot down and changed her password if she wanted to stop Paul from using her in his elaborate hoax.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
