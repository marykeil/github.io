# Every Bachelor In Paradise Season 9 Couple Broke Up Making It The Worst Season Ever


## SUMMARY 



  All three couples from Bachelor In Paradise season 9 have broken up within days of each other.   Kylee and Aven broke up because he wasn&#39;t ready to propose, John Henry and Kat broke up after getting engaged, and Aaron and Eliza also split.   The breakups were announced on Instagram, with each couple expressing mutual respect and gratitude for their time together.   Producer interference and a shorter filming timeline likely caused Bachelor In Paradise season 9 to be such a failure.

## Literature Review
Bachelor In Paradise season 9 ended with three couples leaving the beach together. After the finale, all couples broke up within days of each other.




Bachelor In Paradise season 9 ended with three couples walking off the beach hand in hand; however, since then, all three BIP couples have broken up. Within a week of the season finale airing on ABC, the final three couples ended their relationships. What&#39;s more, the breakups happened within days of each other.




Kylee Russell and Aven Jones didn&#39;t get engaged at the end of the season, but they left paradise together as boyfriend and girlfriend. Two couples left the beach engaged, including John Henry Spurlock and Kat Izzo, who didn&#39;t find each other until later in the season. Aaron Bryant proposed to Eliza Isichei after a tumultuous start to their relationship.

 Kylee And Aven Broke Up On Saturday 
          

Kylee came to BIP hoping to meet Aven, who had liked some of her Instagram photos. Since Aven wasn&#39;t on the beach, Kylee paired off with Will Urena. When Aven arrived a few days later, Kylee broke Will&#39;s heart and left him for Aven. The couple spent the rest of the season together. They never seemed to have any issues until the end. Kylee wanted to get engaged, but Aven wasn&#39;t ready to propose.




Despite this difference, they left BIP season 9 in a committed relationship. However, on December 9, 2023, Kylee revealed she and Aven broke up due to an alleged infidelity on his part. She wrote in her Instagram Stories, &#34;Following our relationship announcement yesterday [...] In the last 24 hours I have been grasping with the fact that one of the most important relationships in my life has dissolved due to multiple infidelities.&#34; Aven confirmed this on his social media as well.



 John Henry And Kat Announced Their Split On Instagram On Monday 

 

John Henry ended things with Olivia Lewis to pursue Kat, who had dated both Brayden Bowers and Tanner Courtad. John Henry and Kat were the season&#39;s most unexpected couple because they seemed to have little in common. However, they were surprised to find that they had undeniable chemistry.




During the season finale, John Henry got down on one knee after revealing that he was following his heart and ignoring his gut. Perhaps he should have listened to his gut because, on Monday, John Henry and Kat announced their breakup on Instagram. He wrote, &#34;With mutual love and respect, Kat and I have recently decided to part ways. Our relationship has been filled with wonderful memories and growth, something we looked forward to sharing with you.&#34;



 Aaron Announced His Split From Eliza Just A Few Hours Later 
          

Aaron kicked off Bachelor In Paradise season 9 by sharing a kiss with Mercedes Northup. The next day, Aaron realized that he really liked Eliza but didn&#39;t tell her about the kiss. When she found out, she was worried she&#39;d find herself in another love triangle like she did in Bachelor In Paradise season 8. However, they were able to get past the issue.




Aaron proposed during the finale, and Eliza accepted. Then, on Monday, just a few short hours after Kat and John Henry&#39;s announcement, Aaron posted about his split from Eliza on Instagram stories. &#34;I want to thank our family, friends, and Bachelor Nation for all their support not just through the Paradise journey but after as well. Tricky emotions watching it all unfold but unfortunately me &amp; @elizisichei&#39;s love story has come to an end,&#34; Aaron wrote.



 Why Bachelor In Paradise Season 9 Was The Biggest Fail 
         

The main reason why Bachelor In Paradise season 9 was such a failure is the lack of real connections. Since every couple that left together broke up in a matter of days, this can only mean that the contestants casted either weren&#39;t ready for relationships or simply didn&#39;t find someone they truly liked. It seems the show itself set the contestants up for failure from the start. 




Not only did they cast poorly, but there was a lot of producer interference throughout BIP season 9, such as having former lead Hannah Brown hold a bonfire where contestants were forced to answer questions. All this did was start drama, fights, and mess with relationships. Also, the shorter filming schedule likely played into the lack of real connections. People need time to get to know each other, and a two-week filming period just isn&#39;t enough. 

Overall, it seemed like the finale three couples were destined to fail. With the producer&#39;s interference and a shorter filming timeline, it&#39;s not shocking that the final three couples didn&#39;t last. Maybe producers will do better once it&#39;s time to start casting for Bachelor In Paradise season 10. 



Bachelor In Paradise season 9 finale aired on December 7.
