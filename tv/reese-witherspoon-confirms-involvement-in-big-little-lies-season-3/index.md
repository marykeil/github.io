## Literature Review
Reese Witherspoon confirms that she is working with fellow actor and producer Nicole Kidman on season 3 of the popular HBO series Big Little Lies. 




Reese Witherspoon confirms that she is working on Big Little Lies season 3. Season 1 of the hit HBO series was adapted from the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty, while season 2 extended the story beyond the source material. With season 2 ending in 2019 and no updates provided for several years, the series seemed to have concluded, until series star and executive producer Nicole Kidman recently confirmed that a Big Little Lies season 3 is in the works.




While on the red carpet for the 81st Golden Globe Awards, Witherspoon shared with Variety that &#34;We are working on it. Nic and I are working on it.&#34; Alongside Kidman, Witherspoon was one of the executive producers during seasons 1 and 2. She also played one of the leading roles in the series, Madeline Mackenzie, while Kidman played the role of Celeste Wright. Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and ZoÃ« Kravitz play the other characters who make up the Monterey Five.


 What Will Big Little Lies Season 3 Be About? 
          

Having already gone beyond the source material, and given the way Big Little Lies season 2 ended, the plot of season 3 is currently unknown. Season 2 concluded with the Monterey Five entering the police station, presumably to confess to pushing and thereby killing Celeste&#39;s abusive husband Perry Wright in season 1. Season 3 could explore the fallout of the group&#39;s confession, including their time in prison, which will be a far cry from the privileged lives that most of them have known.




Woodley shared a potential Big Little Lies season 3 story idea as well, suggesting that the new season could focus more on the younger characters from the original series. The delay between seasons 2 and 3 could actually benefit this idea as those actors, including Iain Armitage and Kathryn Newton, are now teenagers or in their twenties. Their Big Little Lies characters can navigate the difficulties of adolescence while dealing with the consequences of their parents&#39; confessions.



Iain Armitage is best known for playing Sheldon Cooper in Young Sheldon. Kathryn Newton is best known for playing Allie Pressman in Netflix&#39;s The Society and Cassie Lang in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.




Focusing more on the younger characters may be the most viable path forward as it will allow Big Little Lies season 3 to have a new perspective while still being firmly tied to the previous seasons. Witherspoon, Kidman, Dern, Woodley, and Kravitz can still reprise their roles, but don&#39;t have to continue being the main characters. Between the long wait for season 3, and a more divisive response to season 2 as opposed to the universal acclaim for season 1, there are already significant expectations for Big Little Lies season 3.
