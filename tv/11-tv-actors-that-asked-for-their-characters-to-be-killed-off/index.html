  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Actors sometimes request their TV characters to be killed off for various reasons, including discomfort with their character&rsquo;s story or a desire to pursue other projects.
Some TV characters were killed off due to the actors&rsquo; requests, such as Abby Morgan in Dawson&rsquo;s Creek and Anya in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
Other TV characters, like Mitchell in Being Human and Dale in The Walking Dead, experienced heartbreaking deaths due to the actors&rsquo; decisions and desire for their characters&rsquo; stories to end tragically.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>No matter how popular a TV character might be, sometimes the actors ask for them to be killed off, but not all of them get what they ask for.</p>
<p>Many TV characters have gotten shocking and/or heartbreaking deaths, and there have been many cases where the actors themselves asked for their characters to be killed off. The likability and popularity of a TV character depend on different factors: from the actor’s performance to the character’s storyline and their dynamics with the rest of the show’s characters. Some characters got well-deserved deaths after everything they did and caused in their TV shows, while others were truly unexpected and left both the actors and the audience in shock.
There are other cases where a character’s death was requested by the actor playing them, and the reasons for that vary. Some actors weren’t comfortable anymore with their character’s story or with the on-set environment, others wanted to explore other projects, and others felt that their character’s story would have benefited from dying. Many of these actors succeeded and their characters were killed off, while others stayed in their TV shows for longer and some even made it to the series’ finale, and their characters never died.</p>
<p>10 TV Characters Who Got The Ending They Deserved
While many TV characters got unfair or undeserving endings, there are many others who got exactly what they deserved, either good or bad.</p>
<p>11  Monica Keena - Dawson’s Creek
Abby wasn’t the most likable character.</p>
<p>Abby Morgan (Monica Keena) made her Dawson’s Creek debut in season 1, and she was quickly established as a problematic, rebellious girl. Abby befriended Jen (Michelle Williams), and while their friendship wasn’t healthy, they kept each other company as they both felt very lonely. Abby’s time in Dawson’s Creek came to an end in season 2, when, while out in town drunk with Jen, she slipped, hit her head, then fell into the ocean, and drowned. Dawson’s Creek creator Kevin Williamson told Variety in 2023 that Keena didn’t want to be in Wilmington, N.C, where the series was being filmed and was “begging to be killed off”, so Abby met her fate in season 2.
Abby Morgan was the first death in Dawson’s Creek.</p>
<p>10  Emma Caulfield - Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Emma Caulfield knew there wasn’t going to be a future for Anya.</p>
<p>Anya (Emma Caulfield) made her first appearance in Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s third season, and she was a former vengeance demon getting used to being a human again. Anya became part of the Scooby gang and was in a serious relationship with Xander, but when the future of Buffy the Vampire Slayer wasn’t looking bright anymore, Caulfield asked for her character to meet her end. According to TellTaleTV, Caulfield asked series creator Joss Whedon to kill Anya when it became evident the series was going to end with season 7, and she thought that it would be “a poetic way” to have Anya sacrifice herself “for people she could never understand”, and she died during the Battle at the Hellmouth.</p>
<p>9  Kal Penn - House
Kal Penn left the show to take a big opportunity in politics.</p>
<p>Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) first appeared in House in season 4, and he became part of House’s new diagnostic team. Kutner’s death was a big shock to the audience as he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, a decision that was criticized by some viewers and critics and praised by others due to its realism. The reason behind Kutner’s death was that Kal Penn got an offer to work at the White House during Obama’s administration, and as this new position wouldn’t have let him continue working in House despite loving being part of the cast, Penn asked to be let go (via EW).</p>
<p>8  Aidan Turner - Being Human
Aidan Turner changed vampires &amp; werewolves for dwarves &amp; hobbits.</p>
<p>John Mitchell (Aidan Turner), a vampire, was one of the main characters of the British TV series Being Human, along with Annie Sawyer (a ghost, played by Lenora Crichlow) and George Sands (a werewolf, played by Russell Tovey). In Being Human season 2, Mitchell went on a dark path following a betrayal, and along with another vampire named Daisy, they killed 20 people on a train. In season 3, no longer being able to deal with the guilt and knowing that a prophecy said he would be killed by a werewolf, Mitchell asked George to kill him out of mercy and to prevent him from killing more people.
Mitchell’s heartbreaking death was pushed by Aidan Turner as he had been cast as Kíli in The Hobbit, as confirmed by Being Human creator Toby Whithouse (via EW), who shared that Turner thought the appropriate ending for Mitchell would be death.</p>
<p>7  Jeffrey DeMunn - The Walking Dead
Jeffrey DeMunn decided to follow his friend Frank Darabont.</p>
<p>Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) was introduced in The Walking Dead season 1 and often served as the voice of reason within the group of survivors, but everything took a turn when showrunner Frank Darabont left the show during season 2. DeMunn had previously worked with Darabont in The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Majestic, and The Mist, and so he decided to leave the show and asked for Dale to be killed.
Speaking to Cleveland, DeMunn said Dale’s death was his decision as he “was furious about how Frank (Darabont) was pushed out of the show”, so he called the producers and told them to kill him – and so Dale died at the end of The Walking Dead season 2.</p>
<p>6  Dean Norris - Breaking Bad
Hank didn’t die when Dean Norris asked for it.</p>
<p>Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) made his Breaking Bad debut in season 1, and he was Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) brother-in-law and a DEA agent. Speaking to CBS This Morning in 2013 (via HuffPost), Norris revealed that he tried to get Hank killed in the first half of Breaking Bad’s final season, but the producers turned his idea down, explaining that they needed him for the final episodes as they had built that up for years.
The reason behind Norris’ suggestion to kill Hank was that he was cast in Under the Dome, but in the end, Hank didn’t die until the third to last episode of Breaking Bad, and as season 5 was split into two parts, Norris didn’t face scheduling conflicts between Breaking Bad and Under the Dome.</p>
<p>5  Jessalyn Gilsig - Vikings
Siggy’s death was one of the most tragic ones in Vikings.</p>
<p>Siggy (Jessalyn Gilsig) was introduced in Vikings season 1, and she was the wife of Earl Haraldson, but after her husband’s death, Siggy became Rollo’s lover and an ally to Ragnar’s family. Siggy cared so much for Ragnar’s children that she died saving them, as Ubbe and Hvitserk fell into a frozen pond. Siggy dived in and rescued them, but after seeing a vision of her deceased daughter, Thyri, she let go and drowned in the cold water.
Speaking to EW, Gilsig revealed she asked series creator Michael Hirst to let her go as she had family issues and living overseas was making it more complicated. Together, Gilsig and Hirst came up with the best way to bring Siggy’s story to an end, and she was given a heroic death.</p>
<p>4  Paul Wesley &amp; Ian Somerhalder - The Vampire Diaries
In the end, only one got their wish.</p>
<p>The Vampire Diaries follows teenager Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) who falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), but it gets more complicated when his brother, Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder), arrives to bring back their past love, who happens to be Elena’s doppelgänger. Despite being the leads of the series, Wesley and Somerhalder wanted their characters to die (via Access Hollywood) as they “wanted the brothers to go out with a bang together”, but in the end, only Wesley got his wish and Damon sacrificed himself so Damon could get the cure and live a human life with Elena.</p>
<p>3  Milo Ventimiglia - Gilmore Girls
Milo Ventimiglia asked for Jess to have a violent end.</p>
<p>One of Rory’s love interests in Gilmore Girls was Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia). Despite being a favorite among Gilmore Girls fans, when Ventimiglia was leaving the show, he asked for Jess to have a shocking and bloody death. Ventimiglia told E! that he tried to get Jess killed and suggested having him be hit by a bus or have “a knife in the side of the neck”, adding that he thought it would have been “kind of cool”. The writers of Gilmore Girls didn’t take any of Ventimiglia’s ideas, and instead, Jess moved to Philadelphia, joined a small publishing house, and wrote a novel.</p>
<p>2  T.R. Knight - Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy
George O’Malley’s death is unforgettable.</p>
<p>George O’Malley (T.R. Knight) made his Grey’s Anatomy debut in season 1 as he was one of the interns who started working at Seattle Grace Hospital alongside Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). George struggled in both his professional and personal life, and just when he seemed to have found his path after joining the U.S. Army, he saved a woman from being hit by a bus but was gravely injured, and ultimately passed away. George’s tragic death was the result of what Knight called “a gradual breakdown of communication” (via EW) and asked series creator Shonda Rhimes to be let go.</p>
<p>1  Sophie Turner - Game of Thrones
Sansa Stark made it to the end of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Sophie Turrner played Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones from the beginning of the series up until the final episode, but Turner didn’t want Sansa to survive. Speaking to The Wall Street Journal in 2016, Turner shared that she didn’t want Sansa to survive, adding that “if you’re on Game of Thrones and you don’t have a cool death scene, then what’s the point?”. The team behind Game of Thrones had much bigger plans for Sansa Stark than killing her at some point, and at the end of Game of Thrones, Sansa returned to Winterfell and was crowned Queen in the North.</p>
