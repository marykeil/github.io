# Tom Ellis Is Right About A Lucifer Revival - Why It Shouldn t Happen


## SUMMARY 



  Tom Ellis emphasized the importance of having a solid reason for a Lucifer revival, as the show has already tackled everything it needs to.   Reviving Lucifer could risk ruining its definitive ending and the emotional weight of Lucifer&#39;s fate, which was a fitting end for his character.   To have a successful revival, a new Lucifer story should focus on a character separate from the main duo of Lucifer and Chloe.

## Literature Review
Tom Ellis addressed the possibility of a Lucifer revival, and his comments pinpoint the precise reason the show shouldn’t return in its original form.




Lucifer came to an end with season 6, but lead actor Tom Ellis recently addressed the possibility of a revival — and his perspective shows precisely why one shouldn&#39;t happen. The show followed the adventures of Ellis&#39; titular devil and Detective Chloe Decker during its earlier outings, but it eventually evolved from a supernatural crime drama to something with much greater stakes. By the time Lucifer season 6 ended, the series had seen its main duo saving the world and grappling with a time-traveling daughter. The latter led to a tearjerker ending that saw Lucifer and Chloe Decker separated, at least until the latter died.




Although Lucifer got a proper ending after being canceled and brought back twice, many viewers wanted more from the series even after its finale dropped on Netflix. That&#39;s resulted in speculation about how Lucifer could return in spinoffs and new seasons, though nothing&#39;s come to fruition. And Ellis himself responded to calls for a revival, revealing his conditions for reprising the role. Sadly, his comments pinpoint why Lucifer probably shouldn&#39;t make a comeback.



All six seasons of Lucifer are currently streaming on Netflix.





 Tom Ellis Is Right That Lucifer Would Need A Good Reason For A Revival 
Without A Reason, Bringing Back Lucifer &amp; Chloe Won&#39;t Make Sense
          

On the subject of a Lucifer revival, Ellis told the Inside of You with Michael Rosenbaum podcast that he would need a solid reason to return to the series, as the show already &#34;covered all bases.&#34; While he seemed open to the idea of doing a feature film — with the caveat that &#34;it would have to be good&#34; — Ellis didn&#39;t seem interested in a full-on return to the series. He noted that a revival would need good intentions, explaining that he wouldn&#39;t do it &#34;for the sake of doing it.&#34; He discussed the tendency for Hollywood and audiences to want &#34;more and more,&#34; which isn&#39;t always to a project&#39;s benefit.




The actor makes a good point about shows running beyond their due dates, something far too many TV series do to their detriment. Lucifer was lucky to get six seasons and a proper ending, and reviving it to appease viewers might not be in the story&#39;s best interests. The show&#39;s conclusion also poses challenges for any return, TV or movie, as it could potentially undo the emotional weight of Lucifer&#39;s fate.


 



 Lucifer&#39;s Ending Was Definitive (&amp; Returning To The Show Would Risk Ruining It) 
Lucifer Seeing Chloe Again Takes Away From The Show&#39;s Emotional Finale
         

Bringing Lucifer back after its ending wouldn&#39;t just risk the show getting stale; it would also mess with the series&#39; very definitive conclusion. Lucifer season 6&#39;s finale sees Rory realizing why her father abandoned her: because he&#39;s meant to return to Hell and help the people there move beyond their Hell loops. After going to therapy for the entire series, Lucifer&#39;s fate makes total sense. It feels like a fitting end for the character, even if he&#39;s forced to bid farewell to Chloe and their daughter, missing out on their mortal lives. Chloe and Lucifer see each other again after she dies, with her becoming his partner in Hell.




Unless a Lucifer revival picks up in the middle of the series, it would need to bring Lucifer and Chloe back together — and that would cause the series&#39; ending to lose all meaning. Lucifer giving up his ties to the human world is an essential part of realizing his destiny, and his final scene with Chloe packs a punch because the characters stick to their promise to Rory. If Chloe and Lucifer secretly meet to solve mysteries, their reunion in Hell isn&#39;t as touching. Lucifer&#39;s sacrifice also holds less weight, even if he&#39;s foregoing a relationship with his daughter. Additionally, breaking his promise paints him in a negative light.



 The Only Way A Lucifer Revival Could Succeed Is By Not Focusing On The Devil 
Amenadiel Or Rory Would Be Safer Options
          

Given Lucifer and Chloe&#39;s definitive endings, the only way a Lucifer TV revival could work is by not focusing on Ellis&#39; devil. While a show set in Hell could be fascinating, any story focused on Lucifer would face demands to bring Chloe back into the fold. That means Lucifer&#39;s future doesn&#39;t lie with Chloe, either. It would need to follow a character slightly removed from the original show&#39;s main duo, even if they&#39;re close enough to warrant cameos. Amenadiel is a strong contender, as Lucifer&#39;s brother becomes God at the end of the series. That job comes with enough drama to warrant a spinoff, and it could feature the devil.




Maze and Eve are more popular choices, though it&#39;s hard to say what the couple could be up to on the heels of their wedding and happy ending. Rory&#39;s an option as well, as a revival could follow Lucifer and Chloe&#39;s daughter after the end of the original series. Given her powers — and who her parents are — Rory likely has an eventful life ahead of her. This could be covered in a Lucifer spinoff or sequel, and such an approach wouldn&#39;t pose a threat to the show&#39;s bittersweet finale.
