# The Last Of Us Season 2 Can Overcome Its Biggest Challenge With Non-Linear Storytelling


## SUMMARY 



  The Last of Us season 2 faces the challenge of adapting a dual-perspective story.   Joel&#39;s early death is a challenge because it was unexpected and would limit the amount of screen time for Pedro Pascal in the series.   A non-linear narrative could work for The Last of Us season 2 by strategically using Joel flashbacks or dual timelines and cross-cutting between Abby and Ellie&#39;s stories in a logical and balanced way.

## Literature Review
The Last of Us season 2 will include a controversial moment, creating a major challenge. But non-linear storytelling might be able to help with this.




HBO&#39;s The Last of Us will tackle the storytelling of Naughty Dog&#39;s second game in the franchise, and its biggest challenge in doing so can be overcome with a non-linear approach. Following the success of The Last of Us season 1, there are high hopes for season 2, especially since it will involve the controversial Last of Us character, Abby. Limited The Last of Us season 2 cast updates means it&#39;s unknown which actor will take on the role, despite Abby already being cast.




Aside from casting, The Last of Us season 2 faces the monumental challenge of adapting a dual-perspective story, which involves a lot of repetition that works in a video-game format but will need rejigging for TV. Interestingly, this allows more room for compelling storytelling. For example, expanding on storylines or showing past narrative arcs. To ensure the biggest and most divisive moments from the game are told in a fair and adequate way, non-linear storytelling can help balance expectations and effective adaptation.


 Joel&#39;s Early Death Is The Last Of Us Season 2&#39;s Biggest Challenge 
          

It&#39;s no secret that Pedro Pascal&#39;s Joel Miller achieved much praise for his performance in The Last of Us season 1. However, Joel&#39;s big moment expected for season 2 involves him dying brutally at the hands of Abby. In The Last of Us Part II, this happens very early on in the game, meaning Joel is not present for the majority of the story, save from a few flashbacks.




Joel&#39;s early death is also a challenge because it&#39;s unexpected, given that he is the playable character in the first game. But even more, Abby&#39;s connection to the surgeon Joel kills at the end of the first game (and in the finale of The Last of Us&#39; TV adaptation) was only established in the second game as a justification to kill him off. Because Joel and Pascal are so beloved in the franchise, sticking to this element of The Last of Us Part II&#39;s timeline could be a problem as it could limit his presence in the series.

                  Why The Last Of Us Season 2 Will Be So Divisive (You&#39;re Not Ready For It)   Considering what happens in the second video game, The Last of Us season 2 is setting up to be extremely divisive, but will it hurt the HBO series?    



 Non-Linear Storytelling Can Keep Joel Around After His Death 
         




The Last of Us Part II isn&#39;t entirely linear, since it progresses with Ellie up to a certain point then backtracks in time to catch Abby&#39;s arc up to that same point. However, to avoid too many disjointed plot points and redundancy, the TV adaptation would likely not stick to this. Additionally, Joel&#39;s presence is predominantly through flashbacks from the five years between the end of the first and second game. Because of the density of the second game, show co-creator Craig Mazin confirmed the game&#39;s story will be adapted over multiple seasons.

Even so, including the Joel flashbacks linearly would likely confine them all in the first couple of episodes of season 2, raising the question of when Joel&#39;s death could occur. The show can include scenes from before Joel&#39;s death throughout the season&#39;s main story about Abby and Ellie&#39;s revenge missions as a way to keep both Pascal and his dynamic with Bella Ramsey present. While this mirrors the game&#39;s structure, which was criticized because of pacing issues, it would allow for Joel to be present for longer. With the TV format, tweaking the timeline and plot points would suggest the game&#39;s pacing concerns could be resolved.




                  One The Last Of Us Episode Proves The Show Can Survive Part II’s Biggest Joel Twist   The Last of Us Part II&#39;s Joel twist is the most controversial moment of the entire franchise, but one episode has already shown HBO can survive this.    



 Would A Non-Linear Narrative Work For The Last Of Us Season 2? 
          

While a flashback-heavy approach can be a disorientating viewing experience for some, the non-linear elements of The Last of Us Part II have the potential to be effective in the TV series format. However, in order for this to work, The Last of Us will need to scrap the game&#39;s method of handling dual perspectives. This will help avoid losing momentum in the narrative since it wouldn&#39;t keep Abby and Ellie&#39;s stories too separate. Instead, cross-cutting between Abby and Ellie&#39;s stories - while linear - would help save the pacing of the season.




                  8 Ways The Last Of Us Season 2 Will Improve Upon The Game   From Abby’s divisive character to the pacing of the story, here’s how HBO’s The Last of Us season 2 can improve on the controversial TLOU Part II.    

Strategically used flashbacks, or even a dual timeline approach, won&#39;t be as jarring if balanced between a cross-cut timeline that follows Abby and Ellie&#39;s similar arcs. Alternatively, Joel&#39;s death could be prolonged by dividing time between the moments before his death and less developed untold stories, which Mazin has teased. Therefore, with strategic non-linear moments in The Last of Us season 2, Pascal&#39;s Joel can be included or explored more, making the challenge of his eventual death have less of a blow.



The Last of Us season 2 is scheduled to start filming on February 12, 2024.
