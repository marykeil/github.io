  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Screen Rant interviews Ren Watabe, who plays Kentaro, about the Randa family and the twists and turns of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9.</p>
<p>Warning: SPOILERS for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters fills in story gaps and introduces compelling new characters to the MonsterVerse.   The first episode reveals that the supposedly dead father of the Randa family, Hiroshi, is alive and abandoned his families to save the world.   In episode 9, Hiroshi and his son Kentaro are reunited in an emotional moment, while believing that another family member, Cate, has died.</p>
<p>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters enriches the world of the MonsterVerse by filling in story gaps between the blockbuster films and adding a range of compelling new characters. The 10-episode series details the origins of the Monarch organization through the story of the Randa family, with three generations represented in the series. In the first episode, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters explores the cost of that family’s secrets, with Cate Randa discovering she has a secret half-brother in Kentaro Randa after believing their father Hiroshi is dead.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ultimately revealed that Hiroshi is alive and well and abandoned both his families in an attempt to save the world. However noble his intentions, he is not granted a pass when, after nearly the whole season, he and Kentaro find themselves reunited in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9. It’s an emotional moment for both characters, as they both believe that another member of the Randa family tree, Cate, has just died. Viewers, however, know she has survived in what is one of the season’s biggest reveals.</p>
<pre><code>              Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Season 2 - Will It Happen? Everything We Know   Apple TV+'s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is a generation-spanning exploration of the MonsterVerse, but will there be a season 2?     
</code></pre>
<p>Screen Rant interviewed Kentaro Randa actor Ren Watabe about his character’s reunion with Hiroshi and his future after episode 9.</p>
<p>Ren Watabe Talks Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Episode 9</p>
<p>Screen Rant: In episode 9, there&rsquo;s a lot of focus on the other timeline; the 1950s timeline. For you as an actor, how much do you keep track of all of that, and how much does that inform your performance with all the episodes, not just with [this] one?</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: The show obviously spans the two timelines; we&rsquo;re in the modern time and we&rsquo;re not aware of what they&rsquo;re doing. Watching the show for the first time is when we get to see what they&rsquo;re actually doing, so whilst in the process of doing the show, we&rsquo;re not aware of what they&rsquo;re really doing. But we know their story. We know that Keiko is an anchor to the whole story, and she&rsquo;s such a prominent figure in the whole mix of things. I personally love the 1950s group. They’re dealing with so much and there are a lot of undertones that you can feel.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t feel like you had to read the whole script and keep all of that in mind. You could just focus on your own stuff and stay kind of present.</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: I think so, because there isn&rsquo;t really an interaction between my character and anyone from the ‘50s. Reading the script does inform you about the whole tone of the episode, and definitely in an episode nine, it&rsquo;s built up and it&rsquo;s reaching this reveal of what everyone&rsquo;s gone through.</p>
<p>There’s this scene where Kentaro is in the hospital, he thinks Cate is dead, and he’s talking about how to go on. Looking back at the season, was there a moment where you think she became someone that really felt like family to him? Because it wasn&rsquo;t like that when they met.</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: No, it definitely didn&rsquo;t start out like that. I think that just shows the development of Kentaro. That’s what family is, I think; at the end of the day, you just care about them. No matter what complex situation it is, I think you end up having this care for them. I don&rsquo;t know if it was an exact moment [in] which he felt that, but I think it was a gradual realization [for] him, realizing that she&rsquo;s gone through a lot. She&rsquo;s gone through this whole experience through not just their present journey, but also from G-Day. So, I think it was this increasing, gradual care for her that just came up.</p>
<p>I want to talk about the confrontation with Kentaro and his father, but for you as an actor, do you do anything to get into character? And is it harder for dramatic scenes like that or for scenes where you have to pretend there&rsquo;s a big Titan in front of you? I feel like both would be hard in their own way.</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: They are hard in their own way. I have trouble with dealing with the unrealistic things in the nature of the MonsterVerse. Acting like there&rsquo;s Godzilla right in front of you or an ice Titan chasing you and you have to react in a certain way… that stuff was difficult. I had trouble with that, but luckily I had great scene partners. I just had to react along with them, which helped me a lot.
With emotional scenes, that is easier for me, especially when I&rsquo;m feeling a sense of grief. I tend to do that quite naturally. I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I’m understanding and relating to the script, especially in the confrontation with my father. That scene, that could totally happen to me in my own life. I&rsquo;ve had a similar situation with my family, so those scenes, to me, [are] pretty close to reality. So, [there’s] not a lot of preparing, actually. I just read the scenes the night before and go with it the next day.</p>
<p>With that scene in particular, were there other versions of that, that you filmed? In watching it, they&rsquo;re both very standoffish right off the bat. There are no hugs. Kentaro has been looking for his father, and then when he sees him, he&rsquo;s not really happy to see him. Was there a version where they were happier to see each other?</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: No, we didn&rsquo;t play it out like that. At least [in] the beginning of the scene, we definitely went with that idea that I have a resentment towards him, and that I don&rsquo;t want to be associated with him right now. I think it would have been weird to walk into that room and I&rsquo;m happy to see him, with everything that I&rsquo;ve been through [and] with losing touch with Cate and May. There&rsquo;s so much that I think Kentaro was going through.</p>
<p>How was it working with Takehiro Hira on that? Did you have a rapport with him already through the season? I know there was a scene in the art gallery, but I don&rsquo;t know if you knew each other well at that point.</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: I didn&rsquo;t know him prior to this, and we&rsquo;d shot a couple of scenes before that confrontation scene—like you said, in the art gallery. Being Japanese actors, there&rsquo;s a certain level of connection, I think. I was lucky because I was able to genuinely talk to Tak.
I remember, I asked him, “Do you think this line sounds weird?” Because we’re talking in Japanese there’s only us [who] know what&rsquo;s really going on on set. So, I asked, “Do you think this line sounds weird?” and he would suggest, like, “Oh, maybe try saying this.” But at the same time, he gave me a lot of freedom and space. Although I&rsquo;m very new to this job and it was my first time on set, he gave me this space to just do whatever I wanted to. He was like, “You do what feels right.” I also want to add that I think he&rsquo;s a great actor. Although he&rsquo;s not a reoccurring character like that, when he&rsquo;s on screen, it feels very soulful.</p>
<p>There is this moment in that conversation where Kentaro has the files and he&rsquo;s saying that he is looking for answers. It seems like, at that point in the season, he&rsquo;s learned so much already, and he&rsquo;s kind of accomplished the goal of finding his father. What do you feel like is left for him in that moment? Is there something else that he is hoping for?</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: At that point, he&rsquo;s dealing with a mixture of things. I don&rsquo;t really know what it is, certainly, that he wants to do at that point. I think the loss of Cate took a big toll on him, and he&rsquo;s kind of asked to forget everything and just go on with his normal life that he had prior to being on this journey. That doesn&rsquo;t sit well with him. He has trouble dealing with that; he still wants to help. He still wants to be a part of Monarch, so I think there&rsquo;s still a level of motivation and curiosity in him.</p>
<p>Is there a scene from this whole season, maybe that was the hardest for you to feel like you had a handle on or [to] get through?</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: I do remember doing a scene [where I] really felt like I just couldn&rsquo;t do it. I couldn&rsquo;t perform it on the level that I wanted to. And it&rsquo;s not the emotional scenes. It’s not the big emotion scenes, or a big reaction to a monster. It&rsquo;s those little scenes. I can&rsquo;t say exactly what scene it is; it&rsquo;s not as significant of a scene, but I just had trouble delivering. It’s those little things that really mess with my subconscious. It’s the weird little scenes for me.</p>
<p>I know we don&rsquo;t know anything about season 2, but are there parts of Kentaro or his growth as a character that you would be interested in exploring in a future season?</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: I feel like it really can go in any direction. In the beginning of this show, he&rsquo;s yet to find his own path. His main motive was to find his father, and now that he has, and now that he&rsquo;s learned a little bit about his identity and the truth behind him, I&rsquo;m also curious to know what his next motive is. What does he want to do? I want to know.</p>
<p>This is your first big thing. Looking to the future, do you have another kind of project that you would be really excited to do as an actor?</p>
<p>Ren Watabe: I don&rsquo;t have a specific project. I don&rsquo;t really look at the projects. What can be achieved through my expression is what attracts me. I’ve just been inspired by these actors who were truly authentic and [are] able to evoke a sort of emotion that you normally don&rsquo;t get in real life. You get these moments in these films that really move you, and it changes your perspective on life. I&rsquo;m going off in a tangent, but I&rsquo;m just talking about what inspires me.
