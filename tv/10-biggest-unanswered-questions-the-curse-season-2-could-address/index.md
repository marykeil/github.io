## Literature Review

Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie&#39;s series The Curse ended on a bizarre note and left a lot of unanswered questions for a potential second season.




The season finale of the satirical comedy series The Curse on Showtime left several big questions unanswered that should be addressed in a potential second season. While Season 2 of The Curse, which was co-created by Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie, has not yet been announced, there are plenty of storylines and character arcs that could be explored further in subsequent episodes of the idiosyncratic and surreal series. Starring Nathan Fielder and Emma Stone, The Curse was one of the most unique series on television, and its signature brand of uncomfortable humor was like nothing else ever seen on the small screen.
The Curse followed the philanthropic newlyweds Asher and Whitney as they star in their own problematic reality show called Fliplanthropy. The Curse was full of hilarious moments that left viewers squirming due to their cringe-inducing nature but was also full of many moments of pure humanity and featured some of the best writing on television. While the 10-episode first season of The Curse could be enjoyed as a stand-alone series, there still are lots of unanswered questions in the end that could be addressed in Season 2.









 








 10  Did Asher And Whitney Repair Their Marriage? 
The Curse Season 2 could address the couple’s marriage issues
        

The season finale of The Curse featured a short time skip that revealed Asher and Whitney to be in a much more stable situation than previously seen and a baby on the way. After Asher groveled for forgiveness following Whitney’s confessional video about the state of their relationship in “Young Hearts” it appeared as if Whitney found a way to remain somewhat happy in their marriage that was on the brink of collapse. The second season of The Curse could drive deeper into the circumstances of their marriage and if they have truly found some stability.





 9  Will Dougie’s Drunk Driving Catch Up With Him? 
The Curse Season 2 could address Dougie’s recklessness


 







Dougie Schecter, the troubled HGTV producer played by Benny Safdie, had a wife who died in a car crash because of his drunk driving. Despite this, throughout The Curse Dougie was repeatedly seen driving under the influence and putting other people’s lives in danger. Dougie kept a breathalyzer in his car and would attempt to put his passengers at ease by blowing into it and revealing he was still good to drive. This always felt like a disaster waiting to happen and, in Season 2 of The Curse, the consequences of Dougie&#39;s reckless actions could be addressed.





 8  Did The Green Queen Succeed? 
The Curse Season 2 could address the Green Queen’s reception
        

The HGTV show originally called Fliplanthropy went through major changes throughout The Curse and was eventually renamed Green Queen. While the show was featured on Rachael Ray and had been renewed for a second season, the finale of The Curse did not give any detailed insight into how the show was received and if it achieved its goal of bettering the community of Española. Green Queen was full of problematic content and, depending on how it was presented, it could have been a total failure with audiences, Season 2 of The Curse could give more insight into how it was received.





 7  Are Passive Homes Unfeasible? 
The Curse Season 2 could address the issues with Whitney’s passive homes
        

While the passive homes lauded by Whitney and Asher bring up complex issues of gentrification for the residents of Española they have also been hinted as being not fit for purpose when it comes to temperature regulation, practicality, and overall safety. If The Curse were to continue for a second season, the feasibility of Whitney’s homes should be addressed and the faux altruism they represent could be brought to the forefront. An issue relating to animal welfare could also be addressed, as the mirrored exteriors of the homes have been known to lead to the accidental death of many birds.





 6  Was Nala’s Curse Real? 
The Curse Season 2 could address the validity of Nala’s curse
        

The action that gave The Curse its name was the curse that the young girl Nala put on Asher after he took back the $100 bill he gave to her to look good on camera. Ever since this action, Asher has found himself in increasingly difficult circumstances which he felt were caused by this unfortunate curse. The Curse never explicitly addressed whether Nala possessed magical powers, but the eerie sense of foreboding throughout the show, as well as its supernatural finale, meant that the validity of her powers could be a plot point for a second season of the show.





 5  Is Asher The Father of Whitney’s Child? 
The Curse Season 2 could address whether Whitney had Asher’s child
        

In the season finale of The Curse Whitney was shown to be pregnant, and the presumption was that Asher was the baby’s father. However, due to the couple’s rocky marriage history, as well as Asher’s enjoyment of other men wanting to sleep with his wife, it is not out of the realm of possibility that Asher was not the father and she became pregnant by someone else during the short time skip between “Young Hearts” and “Green Queen.” Season 2 of The Curse could give audiences more insight into the circumstances surrounding Whitney’s pregnancy.





 4  How Will Whitney Pay Back Her Loans? 
The Curse Season 2 could address Whitney’s desire to pay back her “loans”
        

Throughout The Curse, Whitney was seen funding her philanthropic lifestyle through loans she received from her hyper-rich morally questionable landlord parents. Whitney’s father laughed at her insistence that she would pay them back and due to the rate at which she spent the money, through paying for thieves who steal from the jeans store or by letting residents live in her unoccupied property rent-free, meant she continued to fall further into debt with her parents. Season 2 of The Curse could show Whitney’s struggle to pay back these debts and how this affects her relationship with her parents.





 3  Will Abshir, Nala and Hani Get To Keep Their House? 
The Curse Season 2 could address if Whitney and Asher carried out their good deed
        

In the season finale of The Curse, Asher and Whitney, in a self-serving bid to make themselves feel good, gift disadvantaged father Abshir and his two children Nala and Hani the Española property they had let them stay in. However, Abshir did not have the over-the-top gratitude that they had been hoping for and in the end, their act of seemingly selfless kindness looked to be a disappointment. A second season of The Curse could reveal if Asher and Whitney truly carried out this good deed, or if they revoked their kindness when it did not have the desired effect.





 2  What Caused Gravity To Reverse on Asher? 
The Curse Season 2 could address the supernatural gravitational pull Asher found himself in


 







In a truly bizarre turn of events, Asher found himself stuck to the ceiling of his home in the season finale of The Curse. At first, it seemed like this was caused by strange conditions of the passive home, but before long it became apparent that gravity had reversed on Asher and even when he managed to get outside the house, he was forced to cling to a nearby tree. The reason behind this strange development was never explained and whether this was related to Nala’s curse, a reincarnation, or something entirely different should be addressed in Season 2.





 1  Did Asher Die? 
The Curse Season 2 could address Asher’s fate and if there was any way he could return


 







After the fire department cut the branch Asher was holding on to off, he was flung into the stratosphere and catapulted toward space. During the final moments of The Curse, Asher was floating above the Earth and appeared lifeless and possibly dead. Asher’s fate should be the first question that a potential season 2 of The Curse answers. While all logic pointed to Asher being dead, The Curse has proved itself a unique and unpredictable show, and the show’s creators, Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie, decided to continue this story they have a lot of explaining to do.
