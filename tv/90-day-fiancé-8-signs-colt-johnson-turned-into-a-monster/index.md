# 90 Day Fiancé 8 Signs Colt Johnson Turned Into A Monster


## SUMMARY 


 Colt Johnson&#39;s behavior has become increasingly shady. He may be unraveling, possibly mimicking recluse Howard Hughes. 
 Colt&#39;s twisted relationship with his mother Debbie, and many questionable actions, have made him as monstrous as some of the women in his life. 
 Colt&#39;s cheapness (and sketchy behavior in romantic relationships) have made him a villain. Also, his serious accident has changed him.

## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Colt Johnson rocked the franchise. His mommy issues are way out of control, and he&#39;s also known for his dastardly deeds.   




90 Day Fiancé star Colt Johnson&#39;s ducking the spotlight after some shockingly evil misdeeds. He&#39;s increasingly paranoid following years of criticism, and Colt may be mimicking the eccentric recluse Howard Hughes, whom Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed in the Martin Scorsese film, The Aviator. Colt was once an attention-seeker, just like Big Ed Brown. Now, Colt&#39;s shunning reality TV show fame. While Colt isn&#39;t growing mile-long fingernails in seclusion, as Howard did, the 90DF franchise &#34;monster&#34; may be unraveling. Some people might call that karma.
Colt rose to fame while appearing in 90 Day Fiancé season 6. His turbulent relationship with fiery Brazilian gold digger Larissa Lima made him a franchise legend. Colt&#39;s twisted dynamic with his mommy Debbie Johnson (was he channeling Norman Bates in the Alfred Hitchcock horror film, Psycho?) also made for some cringe scenes. While the women in Colt&#39;s life were definitely trouble, so was he. Over time, his behavior became even shadier than theirs. At first, it was easy to feel sorry for him - however, he began turning into a monster. More often than not, Colt&#39;s moral compass malfunctioned, leading him astray.
            
 
 Colt Johnson&#39;s Image Transformations Before &amp; After His Accident 
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Colt Johnson&#39;s life has changed drastically since he survived a terrifying accident in 2022, which left him wheelchair-bound.













 








 8  Colt Johnson Said He Doesn&#39;t &#34;Feel Like I Have A Mother&#34; 
Colt Harshly Dissed HIs Mother Debbie Johnson


In the shocking clip shown above, from kiblz at YouTube, Colt, who&#39;s clearly been storing up rage and sadness for years, finally unloaded. His words were so damning. Colt said he doesn&#39;t call Debbie his mom, and hasn&#39;t called her that for a long time. He also said that he feels like he &#34;doesn&#39;t have a mother.&#34;
Sure, Debbie&#39;s a nightmare parent in many ways. She hovered over Colt, seemingly obsessed with him. The ultimate helicopter parent, Debbie never knew how to step back and let her child live. He&#39;s a grown man! Nonetheless, saying that he feels motherless was an extremely low blow. By going so far below the belt, he became worse than his stubborn, interfering, and annoying mom. Actually, what he did was show just how alike he and Debbie are. That&#39;s probably the last thing he wanted.
Colt deserves sympathy because Debbie&#39;s frequently insufferable. However, reality TV show star Debbie may have turned her precious &#34;Coltee&#34; into a monster. Her unique brand of &#34;smother love&#34; is more than enough to leave an adult child with serious issues. Being Debbie&#39;s &#34;golden child&#34; is a curse. It&#39;s a terrible burden. Now, the two are estranged. While Colt can&#39;t be faulted for needing some space, he can&#39;t blame everything on mom. He&#39;s also been cruel.
Colt kicked his mom out of the home they shared even though she didn&#39;t seem to have a lot of money or options. That was a chilling move since she&#39;d spent years making his meals and catering to him. She probably cut his food up before serving it to him! Now, she&#39;s essentially ignored by the child she bore. She spawned the monster that 90 Day Fiancé viewers know so well today. She&#39;s more than a little monstrous herself, and may have passed down her penchant for conscienceless behavior.
When Debbie interfered in Colt&#39;s relationships, it was downright sociopathic. She knew exactly what she was doing. Colt was caught in the middle, but had flaws of his own. Did Debbie teach him to treat people badly? Was her sketchy parenting style the catalyst for his cheating, lying, and deflecting? Probably.





 7  Colt Johnson Was Cheap... So Cheap!!!!! 
Is Colt Johnson Really A Miser?


 







Way back when, Larissa tried to use Colt for cash, but she never managed to get enough money from him. This fueled some of her worst outbursts. While she was frighteningly coldblooded when it came to pushing him to buy her things, from beauty treatments to dresses and beyond, she sometimes had valid gripes. For example, he was too cheap to fix the air conditioner in his car. They lived in Las Vegas, and it gets pretty hot in Sin City.
At that time, Colt had a decent job as a software development engineer at DigiPen. However, he couldn&#39;t provide the sort of &#34;Hollywood A-List&#34; lifestyle that Larissa was expecting. Sometimes, 90DF gold diggers seem like they&#39;ve been brainwashed by films and TV shows. They appear to think that everyone in America&#39;s living like royalty or movie stars. Colt had a mother to support, and his &#34;bridezilla&#34; just poured on more financial pressure. His income couldn&#39;t cover all of it.
However, he could have been conning Larissa. There was chatter that Colt had a lot more money than he said he did. If so, denying Larissa the ritzy lifestyle he promised her was a villain move. He built castles in the sky so she&#39;d move to America with him, and then those castles just evaporated. Did he think she was in love with him because of his looks and personality or what? Was he really naive enough to believe she loved him for himself? If so, that&#39;s sad, but honestly, Colt doesn&#39;t seem that dumb.
So, Colt ultimately disappointed Larissa. Unfortunately, he picked the wrong person to mess with. Larissa has an explosive temper - she will go bersek when she&#39;s crossed. In one truly unforgettable moment, she stood on a staircase and let the world know exactly how she feels about life:
&#34;Whoever is against the queen will die.&#34; 

She really put those words into action. Her bark wasn&#39;t worse than her bite! Since she was living her credo to the max, she ended up getting arrested after heated domestic disputes. During those fights, she seemed to be the aggressor. The cops came more than once, and things got extremely messy.
She&#39;s a villain too, but Colt was passive-aggressive in that relationship. He provoked her sometimes, although there&#39;s no excuse for violence. He would promise her the moon and stars and then renege. He would let his mother torture her. He was sketchy when it came to other women. Colt dished it out but couldn&#39;t really take it. He was a monster because of his wimpiness. He would never take accountability. Colt put it all on an already unhinged Larissa.





 6  Colt Johnson Emotionally Abused Jess Caroline 
Colt Johnson Lied And Cheated


Jess Caroline Hanvey has moved on, as seen above. She&#39;s married to someone else, but &#34;monster&#34; Colt really put her through the wringer. In this relationship, he chose another Brazilian woman, but she wasn&#39;t really his type. He seems to love brunettes and Jess is a redhead. For whatever reason, he made the decision to treat her horribly. The gaslighting was out of control. It was almost like he was trying to drive Jess over the edge. The thing is, she&#39;s very strong. Instead of being destroyed mentally, she would express herself. She&#39;d call him out when he acted up.
Eventually, when the truth about his cheating surfaced, she threw one of her high-heeled shoes at him. After this fit of rage, she tapped out emotionally. The couple was doomed, and it was all Colt&#39;s fault. While Jess might have been using him for a Green Card and money, just like Larissa was, she&#39;d treated him well. She was holding up her end of the sketchy bargain. However, the cheating was more than she could take. Later, Jess summed it all up when she said:
&#34;Colt is a trash man&#34; 

While he was dating Jess, he was way too close to his &#34;friend&#34; Vanessa Guerra. She&#39;s now his wife. Colt owned up to it all during the 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 5 Tell-All. Colt treats women badly, but things seem to be different with Vanessa... for now.





 5  Colt Johnson Slept With A Woman Only To Make Vanessa Jealous 
Could Colt Johnson Sink Any Lower?
        

Colt has issues that run very deep. It&#39;s really wrong to sleep with someone just to inflame an ex. Unfortunately, that&#39;s just what Colt did, and he even admitted it. With Colt, it&#39;s all about Vanessa. It&#39;s good that he married her because his feelings for her are different. His love&#39;s on another plateau. While his feelings seem sincere, he shouldn&#39;t have emotionally abused another woman just to get a rise out of her.
People should sleep with other people because they feel lust or love. Both is good, but not always possible. In Colt&#39;s case, he got creepy by sleeping with someone just to make his ex jealous. That&#39;s such a violation. The fact that he&#39;d own up this is disturbing. It shows just how far gone he is. Does he think this is okay? It seems like it. Even though he sort of apologized for his tacky behavior, it also seemed like bragging. It was just so lame.
Jess Caroline was the unlucky victim in this sick plot. It must have felt great when she found out that Colt only bedded her to make Vanessa mad. To add insult to injury, Vanessa rubbed that in her face during an interview. It seems like Colt and Vanessa deserve each other. Both have acted very scummy at times. However, Colt was the one who actually slept with Vanessa, so he&#39;s really the monster here.





 4  Did Colt Johnson&#39;s Serious Accident Change Him For The Worse? 
Vanessa Nursed Colt Back To Health
        

Colt might have matured after a terrible and tragic accident, but this crisis could also have changed him for the worse. How people react to the most stressful things that happen to them can be very defining. Following the accident, Colt went through so much. This wasn&#39;t a time when anybody could call him a monster. He was severely injured and needed to learn how to walk again. Vanessa posted about the accident on Instagram, as seen above. She posted (in part):
On December 2nd, Colt suffered an accident which caused a dislocated and broken leg. Tibia/fibula along with torn meniscus. He was hospitalized for 2 weeks. In those 2 weeks he had 2 surgeries. With all the pain meds/anesthesia he received, his bladder stopped working and has been on a catheter since. He is unable to put any weight on the leg, can&#39;t bend it and is wheelchair bound. His 3rd surgery was a couple of days ago to remove the hardware he had to keep his leg straight. It&#39;s been a rough journey&#34; 

She shared more information, including the fact that they had to move to a different apartment because Colt couldn&#39;t navigate the stairs. Recovery was slated to take half a year. Her message showed that she was there for him. Vanessa gets a lot of shade, but in this instance, she deserves respect. She took care of him.
However, after the accident, Colt seemed to dramatically change his lifestyle. He basically shut down online, as though posting at Instagram just didn&#39;t feel right anymore. It&#39;s possible that he rethought his life because of his brush with death. Colt survived, but he was severely injured, and that kind of trauma&#39;s going to change a person.
Now, he&#39;s Colt 2.0. He&#39;s recovered but he&#39;s not the same. He wants privacy even though so many people are curious about him. While the decision to go quiet online may be smart, he&#39;s lost something. Colt&#39;s stopped joking around, and he&#39;s not such a fixture in the franchise. He may regroup, but the notorious villain could continue to live a reclusive lifestyle. Since he&#39;s seen as a bad guy by so many people, it&#39;s possible that the shade from his &#34;monster&#34; actions, combined with the stress of the accident, have altered his mindset forever.





 3  Colt Johnson&#39;s A Two-Faced Gemini 
Colt&#39;s Sun Sign Is Symbolized By &#34;The Twins&#34;
        

&#34;Coltee&#34; is a Gemini, and they are known for their two-faced behavior. So many times, the monstrous Colt has flamboyantly shown off all the pitfalls of his Sun Sign. He&#39;s said one thing and done another. He&#39;s lied to people and tricked them. He&#39;s wreaked havoc by not knowing his own mind.
The problem with Geminis is that their psyches are always adapting. They are strongly impacted by the stimuli that&#39;s all around them. A conversation, a book, a film or a song might have enough power to change their thinking. At the time, they&#39;re who they are, but there&#39;s no steadiness. The mind of a Gemini is like a desert where the sands are always shifting. Sometimes, they really don&#39;t know who they are.
So, Colt may not feel like the most dishonest man alive. He&#39;s clearly intelligent, and Gemini&#39;s are often very quick-witted. However, they sometimes fake emotions rather than feeling them. He&#39;s done this so many times. With Vanessa, the feelings are real. With her, he&#39;s made progress, becoming a better man. However, in the past, his feelings for her led to disaster. He threw other people under the bus for her sake.
Gemini&#39;s symbolized by The Twins. There are two sides to every Gemini&#39;s personality. They often get dragged for being terrible gossips who are too superficial. They&#39;re cagey about their own lives because they know that people talk. They&#39;ll try to hide things because they don&#39;t want their secrets out there where people can dissect them. He&#39;s hidden a lot, and sometimes, he seems like a horrible human being.





 2  Colt Can&#39;t Seem To Make Peace With Debbie Johnson 
Will Colt Ever Make Up With Debbie Johnson?
        

Colt needs to make up with his mom. Sure, ups and downs are normal, but icing Debbie out over the long term isn&#39;t going to get him anywhere. Despite what he says, she&#39;ll always be his mother. Debbie&#39;s had troubles of her own. She lost her husband (Colt&#39;s father), and had to go it alone for so many years. While her parenting is sketchy at best sometimes, it&#39;s possible that she really loves Colt, no matter how much they fight. She seems to care about him so much that she doesn&#39;t want to lose him.
Her desire to keep her adult son close may have driven a lot of her admittedly awful actions. Perhaps she deserves some grace because Colt was basically all she had. She did look after him. Debbie also caused so much trouble. Like Colt, she has her sunlight and shadow. They are both very flawed. While Colt needs to make sure that Debbie doesn&#39;t destroy his marriage, cutting her out completely may not be the answer. That&#39;s just going to eat away at him and hurt her. So, he should try to build a bridge. He only has one mom, and no one&#39;s a perfect parent.





 1  Colt Never Really Makes Amends 
Colt&#39;s Apologies Seem Contrived


 







Colt has apologized, but he&#39;s burned bridges too, and not just with Debbie. He and Larissa aren&#39;t exactly buddy-buddy after a relationship that left them both emotionally wounded. The 90 Day Fiancé star Colt&#39;s all about evolving, and whoever gets left by the wayside will usually remain there permanently.
Sure, people who&#39;ve been burned by Colt can rebuild. He&#39;s not so powerful that they can&#39;t survive what he does. That doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;ll forget. 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Colt Johnson is a true villain. He may have changed for the better, but the past is still there, casting its shadow. Since he&#39;s lying low, it&#39;s hard to know how Colt&#39;s feeling right now. Hopefully, he&#39;ll emerge from the darkness to let the show&#39;s fans know what&#39;s up with him lately.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
