  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Big Brother Reindeer Games has surpassed expectations and viewers are eager to see which Big Brother legends will be on season 2.
The spin-off series focuses more on competitions and shorter time frames, making it different from the standard Big Brother seasons.
Viewers attribute the success of BB Reindeer Games to the dynamic and interesting cast and are already speculating about potential cast members for season 2.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Big Brother Reindeer Games has been a surprising success, leaving many to wonder who would be featured on the cast if there&rsquo;s another season coming.</p>
<p>Big Brother Reindeer Games has been a surprising hit for viewers who were expecting the series to be underwhelming, leaving many wondering which Big Brother legends will be in a potential season 2. BB Reindeer Games is a spin-off of the original series, which has been airing yearly since 2000. The series takes place over a much smaller timeframe and is based more on competitions than long-term social strategy, making it tremendously different from a standard season of Big Brother. While Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 has been a hit with viewers, those who watch Big Brother are floored by how good the concept of the series is.
While many are excited about the concept of the series and the way it incorporates social elements into the competition, which Big Brother 25 severely lacked, others are certain that the reason BB Reindeer Games is so great has to do with the cast. Much like a season of Big Brother: All-Stars, Big Brother Reindeer Games has a dynamic cast that makes the series much more interesting to watch play out through the episodes. With such a great group for season 1, many are already wondering who will be a part of Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>10  Donny Thompson
Big Brother 16&rsquo;s Winner Of America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest</p>
<p>Donny Thompson has only been on one season of Big Brother, but his time on the series is some of the most memorable for many viewers. A favorite on Big Brother 16, Donny was kind and genuine, not to mention a massive fan of the game. While he wasn’t necessarily a competitive threat, Donny was social and able to play the game well, earning him the title of America’s Favorite Houseguest for the season. With the Janelle Pierzina stamp of approval, Donny could be one of the most exciting cast members of Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2, bringing back a social player who’s beloved by viewers.</p>
<p>9  Ragan Fox
Big Brother 12 Houseguest</p>
<p>Big Brother 12’s Ragan Fox came into the house, hiding that he was a professor of communications, hoping to use his skills of speech and persuasion to the end of the line. While Ragan was an excellent Big Brother houseguest, he ultimately didn’t make it to the end of the game during BB 12. Even so, he’s one of the most dynamic players viewers have ever had the privilege of watching. Between his fights with eventual BB winner Rachel Reilly and his strategic gameplay behind the scenes as the season’s second Saboteur, Ragan was one of the most interesting social gameplayers featured in the series and would be the perfect fit for Reindeer Games.</p>
<p>8  Rachel Reilly
Big Brother 12 Houseguest &amp; Big Brother 13 Winner</p>
<p>After competing on Big Brother 12 and meeting the love of her life, Brendon Villegas, Rachel returned to the series for another shot at the prize during Big Brother 13. Fighting her way to the end, Rachel took the top spot and became the first player to return to the game and win outside of an All-Stars season. Rachel was a competitive threat who always pulled out a win when she needed to. While Rachel has always been vocal about returning to Big Brother, the timing has never worked. BB legend Rachel would be great to see competing on Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2.</p>
<p>7  Michael Bruner
Big Brother 24 Houseguest</p>
<p>One of the most recent competitive threats to come out of a Big Brother season, Michael Bruner, was the biggest comp beast on Big Brother 24. After being the first person to break Janelle’s record of veto wins, Michael made Big Brother history before his surprise elimination during a double eviction. Michael, who also played a fun social game throughout his season, would be an interesting addition to the Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2 cast. While he would be competitively threatening, it’s possible he could stick around in the game depending on who he aligns with and what kind of competition there are in the game.</p>
<p>6  Da&rsquo;Vonne Rogers
Big Brother 17, 18, &amp; 22 Houseguest</p>
<p>With three separate appearances on Big Brother over the years, Da’Vonne Rogers is the most dynamic houseguest to ever walk through the doors of the BB house. Da’Vonne, known for her acting skills that turned into manipulation tactics in the game, has been a viewer favorite for years. Though she may not have been the most competitively successful player, she could hold her own in competitions and her social gameplay was truly unmatched in each of her seasons. Despite never taking home the win, Da’Vonne could be incredible on Big Brother Reindeer Games.</p>
<p>5  Kaysar Rhida
Big Brother 6, 7, &amp; 22 Houseguest</p>
<p>The original winner of the classic Big Brother pressure cooker competition, Kaysar Rhida is one of the most calculated houseguests in BB history. While his time on the series has been marked by hurtful evictions, Kaysar has always been one of the strongest players to ever cross the threshold of the BB house. Appearing on both editions of Big Brother: All-Stars, Kaysar has earned his place in BB history. While it’s possible Kaysar wouldn’t be open to returning to the game, the chance to win an iteration of BB could bring him back for Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2.</p>
<p>4  Tyler Crispen
Big Brother 20 Runner-Up &amp; Big Brother 22 Houseguest</p>
<p>The runner-up of Big Brother 20, Tyler Crispen is one of the players in BB history who viewers feel deserved more than the winner of his season. A major competitive threat and clean social gameplayer, Tyler was willing to be cut-throat when he had to and found himself on both BB 20 and Big Brother: All-Stars second edition, where he took sixth place. While Tyler may be more of a competitive threat, he’d be perfect for a series like Big Brother Reindeer Games, where social gameplay comes in clutch, surrounding who will be going into competitions and when.</p>
<p>3  Keesha Smith
Big Brother 10 &amp; 22 Houseguest</p>
<p>Keesha Smith was one of the major players on Big Brother 10, with a memorable high-pitched voice and an interesting strategy. While she was able to compete physically, the majority of Keesha’s gameplay was in her alliances and social strategy. When Keesha returned to compete on Big Brother 22, she was one of the All-Stars that viewers were excited to see the most. Keesha and Memphis Garret, who were both aligned with BB 10 winner Dan Gheesling, returned for BB 22, where he blindsided her and orchestrated her eviction. Keesha would be great to see playing some iteration of the game again on Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2.</p>
<p>2  Vanessa Rousso
Big Brother 17 Houseguest</p>
<p>​​​​​​​Vanessa Rousso, who’s a professional poker player by trade, was one of the greatest Big Brother players to never win the game. With a cut-throat strategy and a perfect poker face, Vanessa did an incredible job during her time on BB 17, coming short of the win when she was eliminated during the final three by BB 17 winner Steve Moses. While Vanessa’s time on Big Brother was difficult to move past, she would be a fascinating personality for Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2. With her mastery of social strategy and physical threat level, Vanessa could be incredible in the strategic competition series.</p>
<p>1  Felicia Cannon
Big Brother 25 Houseguest</p>
<p>While Felicia Cannon may not be the best competitor, she would make an incredible host for Big Brother Reindeer Games. Felicia, who was one of the most dynamic houseguests on Big Brother 25, has an incredible personality and spirit, which would make her a great fit to host competitions on the series. Much like the elves of Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1, Jordan Lloyd, Tiffany Mitchell, and Derek Xiao, Felicia’s personality would be an asset to the series.
Big Brother Reindeer Games   Release Date:   2023-12-11    Cast:   Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, Tiffany Mitchell    Genres:   Competition, Holiday, Reality    Rating:   Not Yet Rated    Seasons:   1    Network:   CBS    Franchise(s):   Big Brother    Showrunner:   Allison Grodner, Rich Meehan</p>
