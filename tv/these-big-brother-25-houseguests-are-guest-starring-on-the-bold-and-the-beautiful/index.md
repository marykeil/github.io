Fan-favorite Big Brother season 25 houseguests Matt Klotz and Cirie Fields will be guest starring on The Bold and the Beautiful, carrying on the tradition of contestants from the iconic reality competition show appearing on the beloved soap opera. Matt made history on Big Brother 25 as the first Deaf person ever to play the game. He was the runner-up to winner Jag Bains. Survivor legend and The Traitors season 1 winner Cirie placed fifth on Big Brother 25.




Now they&#39;ll both make their soap opera debuts on The Bold and the Beautiful. EW reported that Cirie and Matt filmed their Bold and the Beautiful scenes on November 13, which will air on Wednesday, December 20.


 

Cirie, who works as a surgical director in real life, took on the role of Dr. Martin, a physician who consults with her colleagues, Dr. John &#34;Finn&#34; Finnegan (Tanner Novlan) and Dr. Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones), about a patient. Matt, who&#39;s a Deaflympics gold medalist in real life, played James, an employee of the Forrester Creations fashion house who works with RJ (Joshua Hoffman), Luna (Lisa Yamada), and Zende (Delon de Metz).

In an Instagram post, The Bold and the Beautiful shared two photographs of Matt and Cirie on the set. The second photograph revealed that their fellow houseguests Reilly Smedley and Jared Fields visited them while they were filming. Matt and Reilly formed a strong connection before her week 2 eviction. When Matt became Head of Household (HOH) during week 13, he received a picture of Reilly posing with his mom as well as a letter. He told his fellow houseguests that he guessed he had a girlfriend now. Matt and Reilly reunited at the finale. Jared is Cirie&#39;s son, and they secretly played the game together.

There&#39;s a nearly 20-year tradition of Big Brother houseguests appearing on The Bold and the Beautiful. Big Brother 5 winner Drew Daniel was the first contestant to guest star on the soap opera in 2004. Since then, over 30 Big Brother houseguests have appeared on the show, including Jordan Lloyd, Jeff Schroeder, Da&#39;Vonne Rogers, Nicole Franzel, Cody Nickson, Jessica Graf, Xavier Prather, and Taylor Hale, among others. Big Brother 13 winner Rachel Reilly has appeared on The Bold and the Beautiful a whopping 29 times.




It&#39;s always exciting to see Big Brother houseguests in a different light. Watching them make their acting debuts on The Bold and the Beautiful is very entertaining. Matt and Cirie are two of the most-loved Big Brother 25 contestants and were the two highest vote-getters behind winner Cameron Hardin for America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest. Matt and Cirie were charismatic and fun to watch on Big Brother, and their guest starring roles on The Bold and the Beautiful are certain to be delightful.
