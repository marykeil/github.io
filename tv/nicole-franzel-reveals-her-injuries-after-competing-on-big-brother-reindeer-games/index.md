## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games contestant Nicole Franzel has returned home after the filming of the series and shared she brought some souvenirs with her.




Big Brother Reindeer Games star Nicole Franzel may already be home from filming the festive reality TV competition series, but she&#39;s arrived a bit worse for wear with injuries she sustained during the new spin-off. As one of the players on BB Reindeer Games, Nicole is joined by several other Big Brother legends who are competing for the $100,000 grand prize waiting at the end of the series. In the six-episode miniseries, nine Big Brother legends have returned to the BB house, which has been converted into Santa&#39;s lodge. Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 will eliminate one player in each episode until the finalists remain to face off.




While legend Nicole has won Big Brother in the past, after Big Brother Reindeer Games she brought home an entirely different kind of prize. On Instagram, Nicole shared a photo of the bruising she&#39;s suffered from competing on the physically demanding series. &#34;Working at the North Pole was NO FREAKINâ€™ JOKE!!!!!&#34; Nicole captioned the photo of her legs, which are covered in bruises, before promoting the new CBS series.


 

The comments on Nicole&#39;s post are hilariously on-brand for the rest of the Big Brother Reindeer Games cast, who all chimed in to discuss the state of Nicole&#39;s legs as well as her photo, which included her feet. &#34;Babe you missed the memo - feet are sold separately,&#34; BB alum Britney Haynes commented. &#34;Nothing jolly about it ðŸ¤•ðŸ¤£,&#34; Big Brother 19 winner Josh Martinez shared.

 How Is Nicole Franzel Doing On Big Brother Reindeer Games? 
          

While it&#39;s still quite early in the series, Nicole is already making her mark on Big Brother Reindeer Games. The Big Brother 18 winner returned to the house for the first time since her appearance on Big Brother 22, where she was met with her BB 16 castmates Cody Calafiore and Frankie Grande. Nicole and Cody&#39;s relationship has been virtually non-existent since he evicted her during the final three of BB 22 and ultimately took the win over Enzo Palumbo. While Nicole was nervous to see Cody in the house, she was even more timid around Britney, who she&#39;s had personal issues with outside the BB house.





 

Despite her social connections being somewhat shaky, Nicole was able to bridge the gaps in her relationships to stay afloat in the game. The Big Brother 18 winner didn&#39;t win the first competition of the series, but she was able to keep herself from getting a disadvantage in the second competition and stayed safe from Santa&#39;s Showdown. While she seems to be all-in on the girls&#39; alliance with Britney, Danielle Reyes, and Taylor Hale, Nicole has also said she&#39;d work with Frankie and Cody. Despite sharing in the diary room that she&#39;d be open to backstabbing Frankie and Cody when possible, she seems to be in a great spot socially.

While Nicole may not be the most beloved player in the Big Brother community, she&#39;s earned her spot as a BB legend. Competing in three separate seasons and now Big Brother Reindeer Games, Nicole&#39;s spent the most time in the BB house out of any other houseguest and has learned the best way to play the game for herself. The competitions on the holiday spin-off may be difficult, but it seems likely that Nicole will work her way as close to the end as she can, potentially even taking the win of the holiday series.
