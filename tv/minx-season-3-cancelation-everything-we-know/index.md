# Minx Season 3 Cancelation &amp; Everything We Know


## SUMMARY 



  Minx has officially been canceled by Starz, effectively ending the show forever.   The season 2 finale left plenty of plot threads for Minx season 3 to explore, including the aftermath of Joyce&#39;s rebellious act.   The core cast, including Ophelia Lovibond and Jake Johnson, were expected to return for season 3 if it was renewed, along with other characters like Bambi and Constance.

## Literature Review
After surviving cancelation on HBO after season 1, the raunchy comedy Minx has once again been canceled by its new home, Starz, after season 2. 




Minx season 3 was more than teased by the cliffhanger-heavy season 2 finale, but the period comedy has once again been canceled. The raunchy comedy Minx received praise for its quirky characters and colorful 1970&#39;s world of adult magazine publishing, detailing the story of the first erotic magazine aimed at the female market. Minx debuted on HBO Max in 2022 before moving over to Starz for 2023&#39;s season 2.




  

 HBO&#39;s decision to cancel Minx was again called into question when reviews for Minx season 2 rolled in, with many commenting that it proved Starz made the right call by saving the show. The second season allowed the character to blossom even more, and it somehow improved upon its stellar first outing. However, even as plans were being put in place to continue the story for a third season, Starz pulled the plug on Minx only one season after picking the show up after it was dumped by HBO.

 Minx Season 3 Is Canceled 
          

In a shocking move, Starz has officially canceled Minx only one season after it picked the show up from HBO after the premium cable network pulled the plug. Though no official reason has been given for the decision, the most likely culprit is viewership numbers. Starz also recently canceled the comedy series Shining Vale, and the network has generally been displeased with the performance of their comedies. It&#39;s highly unlikely that Minx will get a third chance to succeed, and the project is most likely effectively dead at this point.






 Minx Season 3 Cast 
          

The core cast of the show would all likely have returned for Minx season 3. Minx was led by Ophelia Lovibond as Joyce Prigger, a feminist magazine editor whose female erotic magazine takes the world by storm. Her unlikely business partner, Doug Renetti, was played by Jake Johnson.

Though it seems highly unlikely now, the cast of Minx season 3 would have included:

 Actor  Minx Role   Jessica Lowe  Bambi   Oscar Montoya  Richie   Lennon Parham  Shelly   Idara Victor  Tina   Elizabeth Perkins  Constance   Rich Sommer  Lenny   Sofia Gonzalez  Rita   








 Minx Season 3 Story 
          

The finale of the second season left plenty of plot threads for Minx season 3 to work through. Joyce&#39;s decision to print Shelly&#39;s story about her lesbian experiences (written as Bella LaRoux) could have been a career-ending move, not just for Joyce but for Richie, Tina, Shelly, Lenny, and Bambi too. Each of the characters has places they could go if their ties with Minx magazine were severed for good â€” for example, Oscar Montoya&#39;s Richie has been offered a job directing commercials, and Bambi will be busy taking care of Lenny and Shelly&#39;s child.

Joyce, however, will be left somewhat in limbo if her bridges with Minx are forever burned, which creates an infinite number of story possibilities for Ophelia Lovigood&#39;s character. Joyce wasn&#39;t the only one with an eventful season 2 ending though. Doug is now president of Minx Enterprises, a position that was both intended for Joyce and Tina. What&#39;s more, Doug is also in a physical relationship with Constance. All those threads made season 3 of Minx a fascinating prospect, but it isn&#39;t going to happen.
