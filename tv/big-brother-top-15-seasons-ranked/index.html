  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Big Brother Season 9 has been reevaluated and is more enjoyable than fans remember, despite some terrible personalities.
Big Brother Season 13&rsquo;s dynamic duo twist and the return of fan-favorite Rachel Reilly make it a favorite among fans.
Big Brother Season 20 stands out for Tyler Crispen&rsquo;s strong gameplay and the entertaining underdog alliance FOUTTE.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Big Brother is a reality show where players compete to win money, living in a house with strangers under 24/7 supervision. Here are the best seasons.</p>
<p>Big Brother is one of the best reality TV shows, but some seasons are better than others. With the slogan &ldquo;Expect the unexpected,&rdquo; the show provides new twists each season to keep the game exciting and entertaining for houseguests and fans alike. CBS&rsquo;s hit reality series remains popular, airing Big Brother season 26 in December 2023 as a holiday special.

There are many factors to consider when comparing the quality of each must-watch Big Brother season. The twists, the houseguests, and the season&rsquo;s winner impact how each fan looks back on their overall enjoyment. While there are differing opinions, here are undoubtedly some of the best seasons of Big Brother.</p>
<p>15  Big Brother Season 9</p>
<p>Big Brother</p>
<p>Release Date   July 5, 2000    Cast   Julie Chen Moonves    Genres   Reality , Competition    Seasons   25    Network   CBS</p>
<p>For a long time, Big Brother 9 was considered the worst season of Big Brother. But in recent years, there have been several other seasons that have been considerably worse. Upon reexamining BB9, many fans will find it’s much better than they remember. Though several of the houseguests had terrible personalities, they were entertaining. From insane medical emergencies to crazy fights, this season was trashier than most but, ultimately, more enjoyable than one wants to admit.</p>
<p>14  Big Brother Season 13</p>
<p>Big Brother 13 featured the dynamic duo&rsquo;s twist, in which six previous houseguests entered the game to play against eight newbies. This instantly excited fans as they saw some of their favorites return to the game. The season was filled with drama, blindsides, and famous twists like Pandora’s Box. Watching fan-favorite and iconic BB player Rachel Reilly win the game cemented this season as a favorite.</p>
<p>13  Big Brother Season 20</p>
<p>Big Brother 20 is one of the best seasons in recent years, mainly due to Tyler Crispen’s gameplay. Tyler built a robust and dominant alliance called Level 6. Under his leadership, the coalition successfully played a hand in every eviction throughout the summer. Even when the alliance wasn&rsquo;t in power, they found a way to confuse and manipulate the other side of the house. Additionally, the underdog alliance FOUTTE was filled with quirky and entertaining personalities.</p>
<p>12  Big Brother Season 5</p>
<p>Big Brother season 5 is primarily remembered for Project DNA. This twist had two parts to it. Firstly, two identical twins switched in and out of the house every few days, playing as one person. After completing week 5, these two could enter the house as individual players. The second part of the twist allowed two half-siblings to play the game together, unbeknownst to them.
This season also was the first season in which six houseguests played for the veto, allowing the creation of the backdoor, initially called the six-finger plan. Additionally, this season introduced the first “fast forward week,” which has evolved into a double eviction. With so many essential staples of Big Brother developing during this season, it&rsquo;s no wonder this season is one of the best.</p>
<p>11  Big Brother Season 4</p>
<p>Big Brother season featured a twist called The X Factor. As a result, eight new houseguests entered the game, only to be joined by five exes. This led to some insane drama between houseguests, including the expulsion of one. As this was an early season, it also impacted how the game moved forward with the Golden Power of Veto, which was introduced to allow contestants to take themselves off the block. This was the first season featuring a seven-person sequestered jury, forcing the houseguests to remain cut off from the world even after their eviction. One of the reasons this season is so memorable is because the final two were both women.</p>
<p>10  Big Brother Season 8</p>
<p>This season contained the rival&rsquo;s twist. Eleven houseguests entered the house, not knowing three players were already inside. These three players had tense connections with three of the other houseguests, most notably Danielle and her estranged father, Dick. Their reconnection was a highlight of Big Brother season 8. They went from not speaking to working as allies and sitting in the final two chairs together despite being frequently targeted by the house. Watching Eric as America&rsquo;s player and laughing at Jen for her selfish behavior was also enjoyable.</p>
<p>9  Big Brother Season 18</p>
<p>Big Brother season 18 deserves more credit than it gets. It was exciting to see some beloved veterans returning to the game: Da&rsquo;Vonne, Nicole, Frank, and James. The cast also contained two siblings of former houseguests, Tiffany and Paulie. While it would&rsquo;ve been great to see Da&rsquo;Vonne last longer, the hilarious moments and diary room sessions from her time in the house can&rsquo;t be forgotten.
Although James didn&rsquo;t make as many moves as he did in season 17, watching his relationship with fellow houseguest Natalie Bloom was still enjoyable, even if it didn&rsquo;t work out. Paul secured his title as one of the best Big Brother players in recent seasons. The final vote pitted Paul, a deserving newbie, against Nicole, the only vet to win the game.</p>
<p>8  Big Brother Season 6</p>
<p>This season contained one of the best twists ever. In this individual game, each houseguest secretly entered as a pair. Each houseguest believed that they were the only secret pair in the game. This led to the first house divide of the show, with two strong alliances going after each other. With the power shifting back and forth, fans were constantly engaged and shocked by what came next. Big Brother season 6 also introduced Janelle, one of the best competitors of all time, who shattered many Big Brother competition records. This season holds the record for the longest competition, with the game &ldquo;pressure cooker&rdquo; lasting 14 hours.</p>
<p>7  Big Brother Season 12</p>
<p>This season of Big Brother introduced the Saboteur, who is placed in the house to cause chaos and drama. While the original Saboteur was evicted first, Ragan was given the chance to take up this role after Pandora&rsquo;s Box was opened, and this season introduced three of the most well-known players - Brendon, Rachel, and Britney. While Rachel and Brendon got on the nerves of many, everyone had to respect their gameplay as they consistently won competitions and got themselves out of difficult situations. The real treat of this season was Britney, who provided hilarious diary room sessions and went on to win America&rsquo;s Favorite.</p>
<p>6  Big Brother Season 3</p>
<p>This season cannot be ignored as it impacted how Big Brother is played, changing the game for the better. This season contained one of the most likable casts - but maybe too likable. The players were so kind and respectful to each other that there was hardly any drama. This led to one of the worst plays in Big Brother history.
When Marcellas won the Power of Veto, he chose not to use it on himself, which resulted in his eviction. The real gem of this season is the underappreciated Big Brother alum Danielle Reyes. Danielle managed to keep her alliance with Jason secret the entire game and masterfully manipulated others while maintaining her sweet reputation. She was robbed of a win when houseguests went home and saw her savage diary room sessions, which caused them to vote against her in the finale bitterly. This led to the formation of the jury house, which is still used today.</p>
<p>5  Big Brother Season 2</p>
<p>This is the season that brought Big Brother its success. Significant changes were made from seasons 1 to 2, and this season features the primary format used to this day. This is also the first appearance of Big Brother greats Will and Boogie and their alliance, &ldquo;Chilltown.&rdquo; While there was some bad behavior this season, including an incident that led to the expulsion of a houseguest, the entertainment in season 2 can&rsquo;t be overlooked. This season brought the strategy to the forefront of the Big Brother game.</p>
<p>4  Big Brother Season 7</p>
<p>Big Brother All-Stars was the first time houseguests returned to play the game for a second time. Several players, including Boogie, Janelle, Will, and Danielle, are still considered some of the best houseguests ever. This season was the first to introduce randomized Power of Veto players and a Double Eviction, both of which are now featured in each season of Big Brother. It was great to experience the return of &ldquo;Chilltown,&rdquo; and Boogie and Will&rsquo;s diary room sessions were highly entertaining, as was their strategic gameplay. Janelle continued to dominate competitions, earning her title as a competition beast. Powerful showmances ruled the game as well.</p>
<p>3  Big Brother Season 10</p>
<p>This season features a highly memorable cast, both good and bad. The quirky Renny, the explosive Keesha, the self-obsessed Jessie, the oldest contestant, Jerry, and the cunning and manipulative Dan Gheesling. This cast did not get along, leading to the formation and destruction of multiple alliances. It also led to many amusing fights, which resulted in hilarious scenes, such as the most uncomfortable birthday celebration of all time on Keesha&rsquo;s birthday. It also allowed hilarious edits, such as screaming matches with shots of Dan nonchalantly reading the bible and smiling to himself. Dan began solidifying himself as significant in this season, carefully manipulating others and winning.</p>
<p>2  Big Brother Season 17</p>
<p>Big Brother season 17 is by far the best in recent years. While many of the beloved players of this season were eliminated early, season 17 featured some of the most exciting and entertaining twists. The twin twist was brought back, and the twins were unsuccessful in keeping it a secret. However, in a shocking twist, the twins navigated this situation and secured an alliance that protected them and kept them in the game instead of eliminating them early.
Da&rsquo;Vonne, Jason, Jackie, and James were underdogs that were easy to root for. Audrey made history with her wild antics and could have been a Big Brother mastermind if only she&rsquo;d slowed down. Vanessa manipulated the entire house, running the game. This season also featured two of the biggest blindsides of all time: Steve evicting Vanessa, and Vanessa evicting Austin, who was so confident he was staying he walked out of the house empty-handed and barefoot.</p>
<p>1  Big Brother Season 14</p>
<p>Arguably the best season of Big Brother, this installment features some of the most well-known plays ever. Four highly respected veterans, Dan, Britney, Boogie, and Janelle, entered the game as coaches, only to become competitors a few weeks in. While it was great to see favorites returning, several newbies stood out and left their mark in a season that could have easily seen them overlooked.
Frank remained a regular target of the house and managed to make deals and win competitions, evading eviction week after week. Underestimated, Ian pulled off one of the biggest blindsides in Big Brother history, sending his former coach and ally, Boogie, out the door. Dan&rsquo;s funeral was also unforgettable. This move is still considered one of the best plays ever, and is why Big Brotherseason 14 takes the crown.
Big Brother seasons are available for streaming on Paramount+.</p>
