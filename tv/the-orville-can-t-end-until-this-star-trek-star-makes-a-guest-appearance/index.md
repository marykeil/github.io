# The Orville Can t End Until This Star Trek Star Makes A Guest Appearance


## SUMMARY 



  The Orville has featured many Star Trek actors in guest roles, but one big name is still missing: Patrick Stewart, who played Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation.   The Orville pays homage to Star Trek with its sci-fi references and 90s-era feel, and having Patrick Stewart make a cameo would be a fitting nod.   While The Orville&#39;s future is uncertain, Patrick Stewart should join the cast if the show is renewed for a fourth season. Seth MacFarlane, the show&#39;s creator, has a strong working relationship with Stewart.

## Literature Review

Many Star Trek actors have had cameo appearances on The Orville, but there&#39;s still one who needs to appear before Seth MacFarlane&#39;s sci-fi show ends.




The Orville has had many cameos from Star Trek actors over its three seasons, but there&#39;s still a big name missing from its list of guest stars. The actors crossing over from Star Trek to The Orville are not limited to bit parts and one-off characters. Main cast members such as Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s Marina Sirtis have appeared in the Seth MacFarlane show. Other examples include Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Robert Picardo, and Star Trek: Enterprise&#39;s John Billingsley.




Beginning in late 2017, MacFarlane&#39;s show immediately showed many similarities to Star Trek. The Orville makes many sci-fi references throughout its run, but it&#39;s impossible to ignore the parallels between The Orville and Star Trek, especially specific properties such as The Next Generation. The familiar setting is acknowledged with a revolving door of former Star Trek actors, compounding the feel of 90s-era episodes aboard the USS Enterprise. However, there&#39;s an actor who still very much needs to make his debut on The Orville before the show reaches its end.

                  The Orville&#39;s 3 Different Timelines Explained   Seth MacFarlane&#39;s The Orville has explored many classic sci-fi tropes over the past three seasons, and alternate timelines are no exception.    


 The Orville Needs A Cameo From Star Trek&#39;s Patrick Stewart 
He would be the biggest Star Trek actor to join the cast of The Orville
         




Patrick Stewart played the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in all seven seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation, a role he reprised for four movies and the sequel series, Star Trek: Picard. Stewart has become synonymous with the storied science-fiction franchise throughout his career. However, he is surprisingly still yet to join his Star Trek alumni on The Orville. Stewart&#39;s authoritative aura and distinctive voice would be a great fit for the Seth MacFarlane show, as well as being a huge nod to the production&#39;s origins.

The absence of the Star Trek megastar is even more surprising when it&#39;s considered that he has a strong working relationship with Seth MacFarlane that far precedes The Orville. Stewart has voiced many side characters on Family Guy, as well as appearing as himself on the same show. In addition, American Dad!&#39;s Avery Bullock uses Stewart&#39;s likeness, as well as being voiced by the actor as part of the show&#39;s main cast. Both of these animated properties were created by, and star, Seth MacFarlane.






The entire cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation appear as themselves in Family Guy season 7, episode 11, &#34;Not All Dogs Go to Heaven.&#34;






 How An Appearance From Patrick Stewart In The Orville Is Still Possible

Although The Orville season 3 ending may have marked the show&#39;s final outing, it hasn&#39;t yet been officially canceled. This means that the chance remains alive for Stewart to make an appearance on the show as a guest star. In fact, the show&#39;s creator and star, Seth MacFarlane, recently teased in an interview with IGN that The Orville season 4 could very well be a possibility.

                  Every Star Trek Actor Who Has Appeared On The Orville   Seth MacFarlane&#39;s The Orville is a loving parody of the Star Trek franchise, but the comedy borrows more than just tropes and uniforms from Starfleet.   




Speaking about the fate of his creation, MacFarlane said, &#34;There is no death certificate for The Orville.&#34; The show has been on rocky ground several times, so the chances for a Patrick Stewart cameo would seem to be running out. If The Orville returns for season 4, MacFarlane and company need to bring Stewart into the fold and make the show&#39;s biggest Star Trek cameo yet a reality.



The Orville seasons 1-3 are available to stream on Disney&#43;.
