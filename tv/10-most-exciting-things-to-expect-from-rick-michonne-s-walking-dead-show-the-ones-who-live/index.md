## Literature Review
With The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live releasing in February 2024, there are exciting expectations audiences have of the Rick and Michonne spinoff.




Fans eagerly await The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live&#39;s premiere, and there are a number of exciting things to expect. The six-episode series starts airing on February 25, 2024, and brings back the two fan-favorites, Rick Grimes played by Andrew Lincoln and Michonne played by Danai Gurira. Additionally, Walking Dead veteran producer Scott M. Gimple and leading star Gurira co-created the show, suggesting a carefully crafted continuation of Rick and Michonne&#39;s story.
Audiences last saw Rick and Michonne in the main show when their spinoff was teased in The Walking Dead series finale. This raised excitement about seeing the iconic duo again. Without direct storylines or all character appearances confirmed, there&#39;s speculation. However, based on the limited updates about the much-anticipated spinoff, some franchise questions will likely be answered. This ranges from Rick&#39;s whereabouts since his exit in season 9 of the main show to learning more about the CRM. Some of the most exciting moments to expect stemmed from The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live trailer and cast comments.









 








 10  Rick &amp; Michonne’s Walking Dead Reunion 
Rick and Michonne are two of the biggest characters in the franchise


 







Rick and Michonne are undoubtedly one of the fans&#39; most beloved franchise couples. Rick spearheaded the main show from the pilot, and Michonne joined near the end of season 2, with Gurira taking on the role from season 3. Gurira shares in a sneak peek preview of The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live that &#34;These two [Rick &amp; Michonne] are so powerful, and together it&#39;s insane. This is some crazy love.&#34; This confirms the premise will include these two characters&#39; reunion, and is further established by AMC describing it as an &#34;epic love story.&#34;
Because Rick left in season 9 in a CRM helicopter, and Michonne set off to find Rick after discovering he&#39;s alive in her final episode, their reunion is needed to help conclude these storylines. Additionally, in order to expand on these two connected characters, a reunion is even more exciting. While there&#39;s no confirmation as to when it will happen, it&#39;s likely they will meet fairly early in the show to combat the CRM together but have the arcs when they&#39;re trying to find each other be interspersed as a separate timeline.





 9  Potential Walking Dead Crossovers &amp; Cameos 
Some Walking Dead spinoffs have teased characters that could crossover
        

With The Walking Dead&#39;s wide net of spinoffs and some main characters having already crossed over into some of these, the same could occur for The Ones Who Live, especially since Rick and Michonne are connected to many original characters from these spinoffs, like Morgan and Daryl. But what&#39;s more are the hints already present in spinoffs. For instance, Morgan&#39;s exit from Fear The Walking Dead included him proclaiming to look for Rick and return to Alexandria. Additionally, Rick&#39;s connection to the CRM and his spinoff focusing so heavily on them could help facilitate a crossover with The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon&#39;s villain because of the walker experiments similarity.

The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live revealed a cut detail that supports the theory that the CRM and Daryl Dixon&#39;s French villains are linked.




The science connection also opens space for cameos from CRM-affiliated characters audiences haven&#39;t seen in a while, such as Heath from the main show, and Silas, from The Walking Dead: World Beyond. Moreover, expected cameos naturally include Judith and RJ, since Rick hasn&#39;t met his son yet and hasn&#39;t seen his daughter since she was a toddler. Plus, if Morgan makes an appearance and goes to Alexandria, other members of Rick&#39;s group could make cameos, such as Gabriel, who also has a link to Jadis since they were romantically involved and she currently claims his last name.





 8  A New Setting &amp; Scenario For Rick Grimes 
There are teasers about the setting and scenarios being entirely new to The Walking Dead
        

Jadis&#39; actress Pollyanna McIntosh confirmed that the essence of The Walking Dead is still present in the Rick and Michonne spinoff. However, the scenarios Rick finds himself in are new to the character and for audiences. Promising more action and love, the show offers situations to see Rick and Michonne as a duo taking on the monumental antagonist group, which is the CRM. This differs from their history of fortifying smaller communities and facing smaller-scale enemies to protect those.
Additionally, the taste of the rigidity that comes with being within the CRM suggests Rick will have less freedom of movement and new obstacles to face. His letter writing in teasers and pursuit of his family is a nod to his familial search in the main show, now explored in an untapped scenario. This can help rejuvenate the franchise without branding the show as something too vastly different since it includes familiar characters and organizations.

Despite scarce updates, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has revealed a new detail that proves it can achieve what the Dead City spinoff couldn&#39;t.









 7  Learning More About The Walking Dead’s CRM 
The CRM has been featured in numerous Walking Dead shows


 







With the new setting and main focus on the CRM, it&#39;s expected the elusiveness of the organization will finally be explored in further detail. While The Walking Dead: World Beyond was able to give fans the most insight into the group, there&#39;s still major unanswered questions about them. For instance, why they have such an interest in Rick specifically, whether Isabelle and Althea from Fear The Walking Dead were captured and brought back to them, the extent of General Major Beale&#39;s leadership, if Silas&#39; goal of overthrowing the CRM by exposing them from the inside will work, to name a few.
Aside from these, the CRM&#39;s scientific influence and global reach is a major area of fascination. The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live can explore this by confirming the CRM&#39;s Project V purpose - chemical weapon or attempted cure - and whether the CRM has connections in other regions, such as with Genet and her scientific experiments on walkers in France. This would not only explain more of the CRM&#39;s goals but also connect the larger Walking Dead universe to them more deeply and expand on the virus&#39; origins.
            
 
 7 Reasons The CRM Is The Walking Dead&#39;s Most Powerful Survivor Group Yet 
The Walking Dead&#39;s surviving groups often tend to fall, like the Saviors or Hilltop. But the CRM is the most powerful yet - and has yet to truly fail.









 6  Andrew Lincoln Reprising His Iconic Role As Rick Grimes 
Rick&#39;s last episode was in The Walking Dead season 9 episode 5
        

After Rick&#39;s memorable final episode, fans were left with nothing more about the character. There&#39;s a major time jump after his exit, meaning focus shifted away from him fairly quickly, despite his story seeming incomplete. Following Andrew Lincoln&#39;s exit from The Walking Dead, Rick Grimes movies were in development, but ultimately fell through. The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live will be his return (aside from the teaser at the end of the main series) as Officer Friendly since his departure, providing space to explore his journey over the years between his main show exit and the present.
As such a core character of the franchise - one who arguably is often the face of the main show - it&#39;s definitely intriguing to have more of his story finally being told. His failed escape attempt already shown in the teaser at the end of the main show highlights that more about his importance to the CRM will be explored. Additionally, being isolated from his family and everything he cares about insinuates an interesting story about personal growth as he&#39;ll likely go through emotional turbulence, which could even bring up past grief, like Carl&#39;s death, and make a potential Grimes family reunion all the more emotional.

 5  Michonne’s Journey With The Large Group Since Her Walking Dead Exit 
Michonne was shown embarking with a large group in The Walking Dead season 10 episode 13
        

In Michonne&#39;s final episode, she meets up with a large group of survivors. Although her discoveries were leading her toward New Jersey, she agreed to help a pair rejoin this group. It&#39;s expected that either the whole group or just the pair will be explored since the pair - Bailey (Andrew Bachelor) and Aiden (Breeda Wool) - are in the teaser trailer.
The pair haven&#39;t been included in the short list of confirmed cast members, so their small trailer cameo suggests the group is not a huge part of the series. Even if Michonne is alone for most of her journey to find Rick, The Ones Who Live exploring her journey with the large group and how she left them to continue her search for Rick will still be fascinating. Much of the promotional material so far shows Michonne on her own, so it&#39;s expected that her journey will be solitary, at least for some of it.





 4  Rick’s Role In The CRM Since The Walking Dead Season 9 
The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live teasers show Rick as a CRM operative
        

From the existing promotional material, Rick became a CRM operative, most likely working at a culling facility. He&#39;s seen wearing a jacket branded with the three-ringed logo and clearing walkers using the same type of CRM weapons used in World Beyond. However, roles in the CRM are not fixed. While Rick was an &#34;A,&#34; Jadis lied and said he was a &#34;B,&#34; it&#39;s possible - because of their interest in him - that he didn&#39;t start out as a culling facility worker. Given Rick&#39;s clear defiance towards the organization, the culling role may have been a demotion to keep him in line.





 3  Meeting New Walking Dead Characters 
A few new characters have been confirmed for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live


 







The spinoff has already confirmed a few new characters. Pearl Thorne (Lesley-Ann Brandt), a CRM operative, and Nat (Matt Jeffries). Another major character confirmation is Major General Beale, played by Terry O&#39;Quinn. The Ones Who Live will undoubtedly explore the scope of his control in the CRM. Pearl being confirmed as South African also adds to the questions around the CRM&#39;s global reach. Other unconfirmed characters have been shown in the promotional material, further supporting that the show will be very different for Rick and Michonne since they will encounter people they haven&#39;t met before.

 2  More About Jadis’ Role In The CRM 
Jadis plays a crucial role in the CRM since The Walking Dead: World Beyond season 2
        

Since Jadis has been teased in promotional material and interviews, as well as her direct link to Rick&#39;s story via the CRM, it&#39;s exciting to see how her character grows. McIntosh has spoken about acting across from Lincoln again, suggesting there will be multiple interactions between their characters. It will be intriguing to see how her character changed between getting on that helicopter to the loyal CRM officer seen in World Beyond. Additionally, her claiming Gabriel&#39;s last name suggests she still thinks about her life in Alexandria, at the very least, which could mean her character&#39;s complexities could extend beyond merely an antagonistic force towards Rick and Michonne.





 1  A New Major Walking Dead Villain 
Major General Beale could be one of the biggest Walking Dead villains
        

Although The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live will be Major General Beale&#39;s first appearance, his presence was established in World Beyond. His harsh approach to keeping the CRM&#39;s operations on track set him up to be a major formidable force for Rick to overcome. In a teaser, a CRM operative tells Rick after they find him, &#34;It&#39;s like he told you - there&#39;s no escape for the living.&#34; The &#34;he&#34; here could be Beale, further depicting him as ruthless. Overall, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has the opportunity to provide long-awaited answers about the Walking Dead universe and bring back two of its most beloved characters.
The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live premieres on February 25, 2024, on AMC and AMC&#43;.
