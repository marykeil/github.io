## Literature Review
To celebrate the anniversary of &#34;Marge vs. The Monorail&#34;, former The Simpsons showrunner Josh Weinstein has shared a cut moment from the script.




Former The Simpsons showrunner Josh Weinstein celebrates the 30th anniversary of season 4&#39;s &#34;Marge vs. The Monorail&#34; by revealing a long-lost moment cut from the final episode. In the 1993 installment, Springfield gladly gives a large donation to a shady businessman to build the city an impressive monorail network, but Marge soon uncovers a scam that could destroy the town. Since it first aired, the Conan O&#39;Brien-penned episode has become one of the series&#39; most celebrated episodes.




With January 14 marking 31 years since the celebrated Simpsons season 4 episode aired, Weinstein shared a cut moment from the installment on Twitter via a photo of its script.


 

In the scene, Lisa reads to Maggie from a monorail-themed Thomas the Tank Engine parody book that tells the story of a lonely monorail fitting in among the engines. While Marge disapproves of Lisa getting swept up in the town&#39;s excitement, Maggie also catches &#34;monorail fever&#34; and refuses to put the book down.


 The Lasting Legacy Of The Simpsons&#39; &#34;Marge Vs. The Monorail&#34; 
          

The Simpsons&#39; &#34;Marge vs. The Monorail&#34; stands as a beloved episode to this day. It featured memorable guest appearances from regular guest star Phil Hartman and Star Trek&#39;s Leonard Nimoy, who played himself as a guest for the monorail&#39;s opening ceremony. As voiced by Hartman, shady salesman Lyle Lanley also steals the show with &#34;The Monorail Song,&#34; a catchy number he uses to convince the people of Springfield to support his idea for the titular mode of transport.




In addition to spawning popular memes online, &#34;Marge vs. The Monorail&#34; has also been acknowledged in official Simpsons media. What remains of the monorail is accessible in the fondly remembered 2003 video game The Simpsons: Hit and Run, and can be used as a vehicle in its hub worlds. &#34;Marge vs. The Monorail&#34; was also acknowledged in 2022&#39;s &#34;Treehouse of Horror XXXIII,&#34; with one segment opening with a faithful recreation of one of the episode&#39;s gags.

Between catchy songs, fun jokes, and memorable guest appearances, &#34;Marge vs. The Monorail&#34; is a key episode of The Simpsons&#39; earliest years. As such, Weinstein&#39;s shared script moment is a perfect way to celebrate the episode, sharing a moment that audiences never got to see. It speaks to how enduring the episode is that some still want to honor its anniversary decades later.



The Simpsons seasons 1-34 are currently available to stream on Disney&#43;.
