## Literature Review
Dubai Bling celebrity Mona Kattan&#39;s a beauty industry mogul with a very glamorous life. Learn more about the charming reality star now. 




Dubai Bling season 2 celebrity Mona Kattan&#39;s a new cast member with a fascinating origin story, and it&#39;s time to share facts about her age, career and social media presence. On the show, she&#39;s solidifying her status as a blue-chip beauty mogul. Like the Kardashian sisters, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, Mona&#39;s made a fortune hawking makeup. However, there&#39;s more to Mona than cosmetics and serums. This well-rounded celebrity has a great relationship with her husband Hassan Elamin, and a social life as active as her career allows for. The star is adding sparkle to the cast, while also showing off her #girlboss chops onscreen. She&#39;s the type of reality show star who&#39;s a bona fide role model.




Dubai Bling season 2 features glamorous people who have fun together. However, now and then, they&#39;re at each other&#39;s throats. Zeina Khoury&#39;s had it with the sometimes childish Ebraheem Al Samadi, whose antics have stirred up so much trouble. He invaded her office in an iconic season 1 moment that led to a high-drama altercation - coffee was thrown. While he tried to make peace in the newest season, he just made the feud worse. In fact, Zeina was trying to physically avoid him after his tone-deaf apology. Meanwhile, Mona&#39;s making the scene in &#34;playground for the rich&#34; Dubai, and her scenes on the show really stand out. She&#39;s a down-to-earth person who wasn&#39;t born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

 Dubai Bling&#39;s Mona Kattan&#39;s Age 
Mona Kattan Is 38 Years Old

 




Mona was born on May 8, and she&#39;s currently 38 years old. Mona&#39;s a Taurus, so it&#39;s no surprise that she&#39;s involved with the beauty industry. Taurus&#39; ruling planet is Venus, and Venus is all about allure. A Taurus lives a tactile and sensual life - Taureans want stuff that smells good and feels good. Therefore, it&#39;s so fitting that Mona&#39;s selling perfume, lotions and more via Huda Beauty and the offshoot fragrance company, Kayali. Most people born under the Sun sign Taurus have very good taste, and clearly, the products that Huda Beauty produces hit the target with consumers, as the company currently has over 54.1 million Instagram followers.

Mona Kattan Runs Huda Beauty With Her Sister Huda Kattan

 

Mona, whose promoting Kayali perfumes on YouTube, as seen above, co-founded Huda Beauty with her sister Huda Kattan, who used to be a makeup artist to the stars. Huda waylaid her talent into a successful blogging career. She shared information about makeup online at her blog, and that led to the creation of Huda Beauty. Now, it&#39;s successful beyond the sisters&#39; wildest dreams. Their father helped them to get the company off the ground. He was willing to mortgage his home in order to give them the cash flow they needed. It&#39;s a safe bet that they&#39;ve paid him back with interest.




Mona&#39;s married and her husband Hassan Elamin&#39;s no gold digger. He&#39;s not involved with the beauty niche either. He&#39;s a Leo man who works at Aon Reinsurance Solutions. While Taurus and Leo aren&#39;t the most compatible zodiac signs, these two appear to be very much in love. Both signs enjoy the good life, and since the duo has cash galore, they can live it up together.

In a romance, a Leo will generally be the more high-maintenance &#34;half.&#34; Leos need so much attention from their partners. If they don&#39;t get it, they may stray. Leos are naturally loyal, but they die inside when they aren&#39;t being treated like royalty. Meanwhile, Taurus women can be extremely jealous. Hopefully, the green-eyed monster won&#39;t rear its ugly head in this marriage. If that does happen, there could be major fireworks.



 Dubai Bling&#39;s Mona Kattan&#39;s Instagram 
Mona Kattan Has 3.1 Million Instagram Followers

 




Mona has millions of Instagram followers, although her sister Huda has more. Huda currently has 3.9 million followers. Even though Mona has fewer fans, she&#39;s still incredibly popular. On her official Instagram, she posts about beauty. In the clip above, she shared a special Dubai Bling season 2 moments. In that post, she was shown enjoying some downtime in her &#34;perfume room.&#34; That&#39;s where she goes to escape and unwind. It&#39;s that Taurus thing again. Nothing&#39;s going to cheer her up like smelling a beautiful scent that reminds her of something else that Taurus loves - nature.

Mona&#39;s built a staggeringly successful beauty empire with the help of her sister and father. Now, she&#39;s a Netflix reality sensation, and she&#39;s bringing her husband Hassan along for the ride. Hopefully, Mona will continue on the show in future seasons. Right now, a new installment hasn&#39;t been confirmed, but the show has a lot of fans, and it&#39;s quite likely that season 3&#39;s on the horizon.




Sometimes, Dubai Bling cast members seem a little superficial. They can appear shallow as they argue in over-the-top outfits. By bringing this ultra-rich but grounded beauty icon into the mix, the show&#39;s producers have introduced a true &#34;worker bee&#34; who really gets things done. Sometimes, she&#39;s actually shown relaxing in casual clothes, athough they&#39;re admittedly upscale. By getting real, Mona impresses.

Dubai Bling season 2 isn&#39;t just about feuds. It&#39;s also about strong women who know how to build the lives they want. Mona&#39;s had to work hard for what she has, and she and Huda are very impressive females. They don&#39;t rely on men to make ends meet. By doing it themselves, with a little help from Dad, they&#39;ve accomplished something amazing. While some Dubai Bling cast members, including Lujain Adada, are considered gold diggers, Mona is her own person. She made her money the hard way, but clearly enjoyed doing what it took to rise to the top of the beauty industry. This niche is very competitive, but there&#39;s more than enough room for Huda Beauty.






Dubai Bling season 2 is currently streaming on Neflix.
