## Literature Review
Sister Wives&#39; Janelle Brown has lost weight since leaving Kody Brown and has revealed results on Instagram. See her progress.





Janelle married Kody in 1993, and the two share six children together. They have four sons, Logan, Hunter, Gabe, and Garrison Brown, and two daughters, Madison Brush and Savanah Brown. Janelle not only has to stay healthy for her children, but her grandchildren as well, who she visits often. Janelle&#39;s daughter Maddie and her husband Caleb Brush have three kids, Axel, Evie, and their newest addition Josephine, who was born in February. Since Janelle and Kody separated in 2022, she has been focusing on getting in shape and living her best life.





 Janelle Brown Praises Plexus Weight Loss Drink 

 

In July 2022, Janelle shared a side-by-side photo reflecting on her weight loss progress. The left half was from a year prior, with Janelle looking significantly heavier at an outdoor event. Janelle held a Plexus weight loss drink in her hand, wearing a patriotic outfit. In the right half of the photo, she proudly stood in a black-and-white polka dot dress, seeming happier and more fit than the year before. &#34;Everyone&#39;s weight loss journey looks different. I&#39;ve said before I am always hesitant to share publically any progress I make because, lets be real, there are always nay sayers in the crowd,&#34; Janelle wrote in the lengthy caption, explaining how Plexus was life-changing.

Over the video, there were words that said, &#34;I workout - not only to improve my health and change my body BUT For the EMPOWERMENT it brings.&#34; The Sister Wives star then wrote, &#34;When you are strong you can be strong.&#34; The song playing over the video was &#34;Get It Girl&#34; by Saweetie. This video likely refers to Janelle&#39;s difficult time during her marriage to Kody, and sends a message of empowerment to women who may be in similar situations. Janelle sharing her workout shows her strength and determination to reach her goal.
