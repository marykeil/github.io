  The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner reveals that he told Theresa Nist he loved her in the Fantasy Suite and planned to propose.   Gerry&#39;s confidence in his decision to propose to Theresa caused him to break things off with runner-up Leslie.   Gerry and Theresa will get married in a live television event on January 4, 2024.  







During the The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale, leading man Gerry Turner proposed to Theresa Nist, and he&#39;s now revealing a behind-the-scenes secret about their engagement. Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, and Theresa, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, had an instant connection when they met on premiere night. From their first magical one-on-one date and meeting each other&#39;s wonderful families to their romantic Fantasy Suite overnight date, they built their relationship based on the hope that they could find a second true love in their lives after the losses of their spouses. They now plan to get married in a live television event on January 4, 2024.

In an interview with People, Gerry revealed he&#39;d already told Theresa in the Fantasy Suite that he was going to propose. That&#39;s where he told her he loved her for the first time. He said, &#34;It was almost an announcement of excitement. I said it three times in a row, &#39;Theresa, I love you. I love you, I love you.&#39;&#34; Gerry also told Theresa that he was going to ask her to marry him, but he didn’t know if she’d say yes. He added, &#34;So for me, when I got to the final episode and the engagement was about to happen, I was very confident that she was my person, 100 percent confident.&#34;





 Gerry &amp; Theresa&#39;s Golden Bachelor Relationship Explained 
          

Throughout The Golden Bachelor season 1, the theme of Gerry and Theresa&#39;s relationship was hope. When he gave her the first one-on-one date of the season, they bonded about the losses of their spouses, Toni and Billy. However, they also spoke about how they had hope that they&#39;d find love again in their lifetimes. They even joyously danced with a flash mob to Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believing&#34; during the date. They had a successful hometown date with Theresa&#39;s family and a beautiful night in the Fantasy Suite together, during which Gerry told her he loved her for the first time.


 




It&#39;s interesting to hear that Gerry was certain he was going to propose to Theresa in the Fantasy Suite. This was probably why his behavior toward runner-up Leslie Fhima changed. Leslie could sense that something was off. Gerry did the right thing by letting Leslie go before she got dressed up to meet him for what she thought might be a proposal. Although The Golden Bachelor at times made it seem as though Gerry was unsure of his decision, his anguish actually came from the fact that he knew he was breaking Leslie&#39;s heart. Gerry was sure about Theresa after their Fantasy Suite date.
