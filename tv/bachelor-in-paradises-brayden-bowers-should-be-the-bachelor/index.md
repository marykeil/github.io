## Literature Review
Brayden Bowers, the cute and quirky Bachelor Nation contestant who stole hearts on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, should be the Bachelor.




Brayden Bowers was a breath of fresh air on Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season and Bachelor in Paradise season 9 with his unique sense of style (including those hanging earrings) and quirky and romantic personality, and he should be the next leading man of The Bachelor. Brayden was off to a fantastic start on Charity&#39;s season when she gave him her first impression rose. They had a great time on their one-on-one date as well. However, things began to take a turn for the worse when Brayden started to doubt if he&#39;d be ready to get engaged to Charity after only knowing her for a short time. They eventually decided to go their separate ways.




After The Bachelorette, Brayden joined the cast of Bachelor in Paradise season 9. He immediately hit it off with Kat Izzo, but she eventually left him for Tanner Courtad. After that, Brayden went on a date with Rachel Recchia, but then he felt a stronger connection with Becca Serrano. When Becca suddenly self-eliminated from the show, Brayden decided to give his rose to Olivia Lewis, who&#39;d just been dumped by John Henry for Kat. In the end, Brayden was eliminated at next rose ceremony. Now Brayden deserves another chance at love with his own season of The Bachelor.

 Who Is Brayden Bowers? 
Brayden Appeared On The Bachelorette Season 20 &amp; Bachelor In Paradise Season 9
         

Brayden is a 25-year-old travel nurse from San Diego, California. He&#39;s worked in both psych and hospice care. He has a pet dog named River. Brayden has a unique sense of style, including wearing dangling earrings. He&#39;s said in the past that his love for wearing jewelry came from the fact that he wasn&#39;t able to do it when he served in the Army. Brayden has lived a life of service, which has been very interesting. He would make a wonderful Bachelor because he&#39;s not sheltered, and he has experienced many things and interacted with so many people. Because of his job as a nurse, Brayden has so much compassion.






 Brayden Bowers Is So Much Fun 
Brayden Brings Humor To The Bachelor Franchise

 

Brayden was one of the most fun Bachelor Nation contestants ever. He brought some spice and humor to The Bachelorette, and the show became boring after he left. On Bachelor in Paradise, Brayden and Rachel were a delight when they had a blast on their one-on-one date, turning each other into human piÃ±atas. They painted each other&#39;s bodies, and covered each other in paper. Brayden brought out a side of Rachel that hadn&#39;t been seen before. It was a sweet moment of levity in what can sometimes be a serious show.

On The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, Brayden enjoyed having a good time. His rapping on Bachelor in Paradise was hilarious and made everyone laugh. He was so charismatic that he even won over some of his fellow contestants who didn&#39;t like him on Charity&#39;s season, including Aaron Bryant and his now close friend, Aaron Schwartman.




Brayden is very different from the last few Bachelors--Matt James, Clayton Echard, Zach Shallcross, and Joey Graziadei--who tended to be more on the shy side and didn&#39;t show much personality. Brayden has a knack for making people feel comfortable, which is a quality that the Bachelor leading man should have. When dealing with over 30 different personalities, the Bachelor has to be able to mesh with many different types of people.

 Brayden Bowers Is Open To Falling In Love 
Brayden Wears His Heart On His Sleeve

 

Although he was worried about getting engaged so soon on The Bachelorette, Brayden is open to falling in love. One of the most successful Bachelor couples, Matt and Rachael Kirckconnell, left the show together in 2021, and they still aren&#39;t engaged. Brayden could break new ground by being the first Bachelor who openly declares that he&#39;s not seeking an engagement from the beginning, but rather a serious relationship from the show.




Brayden has a lot of love to give and is very lovable. He wears his heart on his sleeve and is really romantic. Brayden&#39;s a good friend and a considerate partner. It would be wonderful to see him fall in love in an environment in which he doesn&#39;t have to compete with other men for his true love&#39;s affection. Brayden deserves that chance.



 Brayden Bowers Is A Realist 
Brayden Revealed The Flaws In The Bachelorette Process
          

Brayden&#39;s concerns about the Bachelorette timeline were actually legitimate. Charity&#39;s season filmed from March 20 to April 30, 2023, which is about six weeks. Brayden admitted to the other men that it was hard for him to imagine getting engaged to Charity, especially after she just dated 20 of his friends. However, he could definitely see himself dating her after the season ended. Although Aaron B. thought that Brayden wasn&#39;t taking the process seriously, Brayden argued that it was just the opposite.




Brayden felt that the men who were ready to jump into a proposal didn&#39;t truly understand the gravity of an engagement. He explained to Charity that they hadn&#39;t even met each other&#39;s families yet. He was worried about the process, and the track record of The Bachelorette proved him right. The past several Bachelorettes, including Becca Kufrin, Hannah Brown, Clare Crawley, Tayshia Adams, Katie Thurston, Michelle Young, Gabby Windey, and Rachel Recchia, have all ended their engagements after their finales. Brayden was right to question the process, but as the Bachelor, he could work to change it.

 Brayden Bowers Wants To Learn From His Mistakes 
Brayden Takes Full Responsibility For His Actions
          

Brayden is very self-aware, and he seeks to understand himself. He made it very clear to Charity that part of the reason that he was worried about jumping into a relationship with her so quickly stemmed from his past relationship trauma. He was only in love once, and the relationship ended horribly because he said that his girlfriend cheated on him. The thought of Charity dating so many other men reminded him of that betrayal.




Brayden&#39;s reactions to things, including packing his bags to go home after Charity broke a Bachelor Nation kissing record with Joey, came from a place of experience rather than jealousy. He was always truthful with her, and told her how he felt. When Brayden arrived in Bachelor in Paradise, he continued his pattern of honesty with Kat. However, after he left Rachel, things went downhill for him.

When Rachel self-eliminated from Bachelor in Paradise season 9 without handing out her rose, Brayden was one of the men who was sent home. She could&#39;ve given out her rose before she left, but she forfeited it instead. However, rather than blame her for his elimination, Brayden took full responsibility. In his exit interview in the limousine, he admitted that maybe he shouldn&#39;t have gone on the date with Becca. Brayden also acknowledged that he had to be better in the future.

Brayden should have the chance to prove himself one more time as The Bachelor. He&#39;s self-aware enough to take everything that he&#39;s learned from his previous experiences, and apply them to his new role on the show. He&#39;s sweet, kind, unique, and romantic. Brayden would make a fantastic Bachelor leading man.




The Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale airs Thursday, December 7 at 8 p.m. ET.
