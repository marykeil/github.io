## Literature Review

Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will premiere on Netflix in 2024, but when and how will the episodes drop? Prodigy&#39;s showrunners can only guess.




Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will premiere on Netflix in 2024, but when and how the episodes will be released by the streaming service is a mystery to co-showrunners Kevin and Dan Hageman and Aaron J. Waltke. Netflix premiered all 20 episodes of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 on Christmas Day, 2023, and the beloved CGI all-ages animated series quickly charted on Netflix&#39;s Kids&#39; Top 10 shows. This bodes well for Star Trek: Prodigy season 2, and its Netflix release is something audiences (and the creators) are eagerly anticipating.




TrekTalks 3 assembled a Producing Star Trek panel, which helped raise over $109,000 for the Hollywood Food Coalition. Moderated by TrekMovie.com&#39;s Anthony Pascale, TrekTalks 3&#39;s Producing Star Trek panel gathered Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s Kevin and Dan Hageman and Aaron J. Waltke with legendary writer-producer Brannon Braga, who worked on multiple Rick Berman-era Star Trek series and movies, including co-creating Star Trek: Enterprise. Braga is a fan of Star Trek: Prodigy and prompted a discussion about when and how season 2 comes out. Read their quotes and watch TrekTalks 3&#39;s Producing Star Trek panel at the 3:44:44 time stamp below:


Brannon Braga: When does season 2 drop?



Dan Hageman: We don’t know. Sometime. They just re-dropped season 1 on Netflix over Christmas, so, I can’t guess.



Aaron Waltke: Season 2 is coming out later this year. That’s all we know.


Anthony Pascale prompted Dan Hageman to make a guess.


Dan Hageman: What’s a guess, though?






Aaron Waltke: I don’t think Netflix would like it if we put out guesses.


Anthony Pascale then asked how the Hagemans and Aaron Waltke think Star Trek: Prodigy season 2&#39;s episodes will be released by Netflix, whether all 20 episodes could drop at once or if the season will be split up.


Aaron Waltke: Whatever it is, it’ll be the exact way it was always meant to be released.



Kevin Hageman: Because their strategies are always changing. They used to drop things a certain way, and now they’re experimenting with different ways to drop shows, so I really don’t know.



 

                  Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 Ending Has “Great Promise” For Season 3, Says Creators   Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 debuts on Netflix in 2024 and creators Kevin and Dan Hageman reflect on the end of season 2 opening the door for season 3.   





 Star Trek: Prodigy Has Something In Common With Rick Berman Era Star Trek 
Prodigy has an epic episode count.
         

Brannon Braga was certainly impressed by what he saw of Star Trek: Prodigy, which has one thing in common with Rick Berman-era Star Trek shows that the roster of Star Trek on Paramount&#43; series do not: Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s seasons consist of 20 episodes. Granted, they are half-hour episodes, but the sheer amount of work in writing, directing, voicing, and animating Star Trek: Prodigy is staggering. Braga recognized the kinship Star Trek: Prodigy shares with the series that Brannon worked on, including Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager, and Star Trek: Enterprise, which produced 22 to 26 episodes per season.

Modern Star Trek shows follow the streaming model, releasing 10 episodes per season on Paramount&#43;, which contain feature film-quality productions and visual effects. Indeed, the shows Brannon Braga produces today, including The Orville, also follow the streaming model. Like many producers who have worked in both eras of television, Braga often can&#39;t believe they used to crank out 26 episodes of Star Trek per year. However Netflix does release Star Trek: Prodigy season 2, its next 20 episodes dropping will be one of the biggest Star Trek events of 2024.






Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 is streaming on Netflix. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix in 2024.
