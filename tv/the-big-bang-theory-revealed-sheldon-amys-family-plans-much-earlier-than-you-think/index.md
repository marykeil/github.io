## SUMMARY 



  Young Sheldon reveals that Sheldon and Amy from The Big Bang Theory had children, but confirming Sheldon&#39;s desire to have kids was established in season 10.   The Big Bang Theory episode &#34;The Brain Bowl Incubation&#34; hinted at Sheldon&#39;s intent to have children with Amy, showing his obsession with creating an intelligent child.

## Literature Review
While Young Sheldon did confirm that Sheldon and Amy had children, The Big Bang Theory had already secretly hinted at their future plans far earlier.




While it took Young Sheldon a few seasons to confirm that Sheldon and Amy had numerous children, The Big Bang Theory secretly told viewers this back in season 10. Although Young Sheldon is a spinoff that looks back on Sheldon Cooper&#39;s adolescence, the series has still been able to reveal a little about the character’s future. Since Sheldon&#39;s adult self, voiced by original star Jim Parsons, narrates Young Sheldon, he can occasionally slip in choice details about his life with Amy after The Big Bang Theory&#39;s ending. As the original show&#39;s characters were still relatively young when the sitcom concluded, this is valuable information for anyone hoping to get a clearer idea of the Pasadena gang&#39;s futures.




By the time The Big Bang Theory ended after season 12, Howard and Bernadette already had two children, while Leonard and Penny were shocked to discover Penny was pregnant, but there was seemingly no way of knowing whether Sheldon and Amy Farrah Fowler went on to have children. That was until Young Sheldon&#39;s narration confirmed as much in season 4, when adult Sheldon revealed his first child with Amy was named after Leonard. This was not, however, the first insight into Sheldon and Amy&#39;s future family, as proven by one episode of The Big Bang Theory season 10.

                  The Big Bang Theory TV Spinoff: Confirmation, Chuck Lorre Involvement &amp; Everything We Know   The Big Bang Theory has recently announced a new spin-off for the show - here&#39;s what we know about the upcoming project&#39;s story, cast, and release.    


 The Big Bang Theory Season 10 Proved Sheldon Wanted Kids 
          




In The Big Bang Theory season 10, episode 8, &#34;The Brain Bowl Incubation,&#34; Sheldon made it abundantly clear that he intended to have children with Amy. When he and Amy blended their DNA as part of an experiment she was doing, Sheldon became obsessed with the idea of creating a super-intelligent child together. While Sheldon struggled with George&#39;s legacy throughout The Big Bang Theory, he showed no reticence around the idea of raising children of his own. Notably, by the end of the episode, he hadn’t been discouraged from this plan, and Amy found herself fastidiously avoiding his attempts to seduce her with rose petals and flamenco dancing.



The Big Bang Theory is available to stream on Max.




Although &#34;The Brain Bowl Incubation&#34; played Sheldon&#39;s absurd mating rituals for laughs, the series never attempted to hide or deny his desire to have children. Although Amy didn&#39;t appreciate Sheldon viewing her as a human incubator, she also appeared open to the concept of one day starting a family. When Young Sheldon later surprised viewers by confirming Sheldon and Amy having children as franchise canon, therefore, the spinoff was only confirming that their established plan from The Big Bang Theory succeeded.

While &#34;The Brain Bowl Incubation&#34; did suggest Amy and Sheldon wanted children, this was only canonically confirmed in the spinoff. As such, even though The Big Bang Theory&#39;s premise changed as the show began to focus more on Amy and Sheldon, the pair were still the only couple who ended the series without a confirmed pregnancy. As if to make up for this, Young Sheldon season 6 later confirmed that the duo had multiple children, fulfilling Sheldon’s promises from The Big Bang Theory season 10. Young Sheldon’s revelation was less about dropping shocking new information, and more about confirming what The Big Bang Theory had already laid the groundwork for.
