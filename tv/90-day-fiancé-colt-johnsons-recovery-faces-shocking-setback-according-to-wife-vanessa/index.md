## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Colt Johnson had an accident in December 2022 while filming The Last Resort. Vanessa Guerra is revealing he still hasn&#39;t recovered.




90 Day: The Single Life star Colt Johnson&#39;s recovery has suffered a massive setback a year after the reality TV star got into a shocking accident. Colt is a 38-year-old from Las Vegas who was working as a software development engineer when he debuted in 90DF season 6. Colt was introduced along with his then-wife Larissa Lima Dos Santos. After his divorce, Colt briefly dated another Brazilian woman, Jess Caroline. Colt cheated on Jess with his best friend Vanessa Guerra, who he later eloped with in 90 Day: The Single Life season 2. Colt and Vanessa were filming 90 Day: The Last Resort when he met with an accident.




It was Vanessa who told 90 Day Fiancé fans about Colt&#39;s accident in January 2023, and a year later, Vanessa is revealing that Colt still hasn&#39;t recovered from what happened.

          

Vanessa shared a photo of a dishevelled-looking Colt sitting awkwardly on his hospital bed with a pained expression on his face. Vanessa wrote that Colt underwent his fourth surgery a couple of weeks ago, but had a &#34;complication&#34; with it. Vanessa added that Colt was now required to undergo a fifth operation. Vanessa added two crying emojis to convey her feelings. In October 2023, Vanessa had told her followers that she hoped the surgery scheduled for December was going to be Colt&#39;s last.

 How Did 90 Day Fiancé’s Colt Johnson Get Injured? 
          




Vanessa was the one who reported about Colt being involved in an accident via a post in January 2023. Vanessa wrote a long caption saying Colt had the accident in December 2023. He had already had three surgeries to fix his broken leg and a torn meniscus. Vanessa did not reveal what exactly caused Colt to break his leg in such a bad way. Vanessa said that Colt’s bladder stopped working because of the pain medication and anesthesia he had received. Colt was on a catheter. He was unable to put any weight on his leg. Vanessa and Colt had just moved into a second-story apartment.


 

Colt was unable to go upstairs because he had to use a wheelchair. At the time, Vanessa believed Colt would recover in six to eight months. He would have been able to walk again in a month or two with physical therapy. Vanessa finally told fans the cause of Colt’s accident in February 2023. She revealed they had been filming 90 Day: The Last Resort in Reno and Colt was jumping on a trampoline while filming a scene. As per Vanessa, Molly Hopkins and Kelly Brown were their replacements.




Meanwhile, Vanessa and Colt may have also decided they will never be a part of 90 Day Fiancé again. In that case, 90 Day: The Single Life could be the last franchise show they starred in. Colt’s relationship with his mother, Debbie Johnson, was also affected when she decided to date Canadian boyfriend Tony Starcevich. Colt and Vanessa could have been growing through some severe relationship issues if they were approached to star in the couples&#39; therapy show. Colt and Vanessa, however, may have come closer after his accident, which ultimately may have been the silver lining in their strained relationship.
