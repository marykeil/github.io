# Percy Jacksons Lotus Casino Book Change Erases 1 Crucial Failure In The Trios Quest


## SUMMARY 



  Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are forcibly trapped in the Lotus Casino in the TV show, whereas in the book it was their own error in judgment.   The change in the TV show removes an important reminder that the trio are just kids and prone to making mistakes.   The show needed to demonstrate that the 12-year-old heroes can make similar mistakes as other tweens to maintain their relatability.

## Literature Review

A few major changes from the book are made in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6, including one that undoes an important plot point.





Summary

  Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are forcibly trapped in the Lotus Casino in the TV show, whereas in the book it was their own error in judgment.   The change in the TV show removes an important reminder that the trio are just kids and prone to making mistakes.   The show needed to demonstrate that the 12-year-old heroes can make similar mistakes as other tweens to maintain their relatability.  







Disney&#43;’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 6 makes some big changes from the book’s Lotus Casino sequence, including the erasure of an important failure by the main trio. One of the most anticipated installments of the Disney&#43; adaptation, Percy Jackson episode 6 brings Percy, Annabeth, and Grover to the Lotus Casino in Las Vegas, which traps its victims – potentially for decades – with the narcotic effects of the lotus flower. The show accurately depicts the trio accidentally getting stuck there for five days, but the reason for their prolonged stay is changed from Percy Jackson’s book.

After Percy Jackson episode 5&#39;s events, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover travel to the Lotus Casino to find Hermes, who is supposed to help transport them to the Underworld. Grover explains the dangers of the lotus flowers causing people to forget who they are, why they’re there, and what’s important, so the trio avoids consuming any. However, Grover still becomes sucked into the games because the flower is released through the air, with Percy and Annabeth similarly beginning to forget their mission despite resisting the games’ temptations. Though the trio still becomes trapped, the direct cause is different in the book.





 Percy, Grover &amp; Annabeth Willingly Play The Games At The Lotus Casino In The Book 
          

The series’ decision to make Percy, Grover, and Annabeth succumb to the casino’s powers despite their resistance undermines their important failure in the book. In The Lightning Thief novel, the 12-year-olds decide to stop at the Lotus Casino when looking for somewhere to briefly rest on their journey. Having already battled several monsters and still having a week before reaching the summer solstice deadline, the trio decides to indulge in playing a few games. Though Percy Jackson’s titular character sensed something was wrong, he went against his better judgment, cut himself some slack, and played games.

It wasn’t until Percy noticed kids from the 1970s trapped in the casino that he snapped out of the trance, soon realizing five days had passed. This failure in the book was directly caused by Percy, Annabeth, and Grover making an error in judgment and falling victim to the casino’s powers. However, the Percy Jackson TV show changes these events so that the trio successfully avoids any personal temptation, instead being forcibly trapped by the casino filtering the flower into the air. In the book, the trio’s entrapment is partially their own fault, which isn’t the case in the show.






 Percy Jackson&#39;s Lotus Casino Book Failure Was A Clear Reminder That The Trio Are Just Kids 
          

In rewriting this failure from the trio, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 also erases an important reminder that Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are just kids. The characters are already risking their lives, battling Percy Jackson’s various gods and mythological creatures, and tasked with saving the world – the series needs more plot-based reminders that they’re still just tweens. While the Disney&#43;-streaming show frequently mentions their young ages, this was a significant way to follow the rule of “showing, not telling” that they’re still 12-year-olds who make mistakes and become tempted like other non-demigod 12-year-olds.



New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians are released Tuesdays at 9 pm ET on Disney&#43;.







Like typical kids their age, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover made an error in judgment that cost them dearly in a more important task. However, without making that personal error of playing the games, a necessary flaw in the trio being the ones chosen for the world-saving quest is undermined. Percy Jackson and the Olympians gives its heroes other flaws, but the show needed a greater demonstration of the 12-year-olds making somewhat relatable mistakes to other tweens.
