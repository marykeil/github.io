## Literature Review
Captain Sandy Yawn explains why she is ready to give one of the most notorious cast members of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 another chance.




Captain Sandra “Sandy” Yawn from Below Deck Mediterranean defended Kyle Viljoen after his terrible behavior on the yacht. Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 is wild, featuring many dramatic scenes and arguments. In episode 2, Tumi Mhlongo boards the ship and verbally fights with Natalya Scudder. Since both the ladies trusted Kyle, they used him as their confidant. However, Kyle broke their trust by instigating their problems through gossip and lies. Kyle’s terrible behavior eventually led Natalya to quit the show mid-season, which angered everyone. Captain Sandy even gave him a formal warning.




Captain Sandy was initially against Kyle, but she recently came to his aid in an interview. While talking to US Weekly, the Below Deck Mediterranean star shared her feelings about her second steward and his bad behavior. She said, “Kyle is a great human being just like Tumi and Natalya and Max.” She added that Kyle regrets his mistakes and understands the consequences. Unfortunately, Kyle has no control because he has no filter. Captain Sandy claimed, “I’m sure Kyle regrets a lot and I think he’s actually admitted it on social media.”

 Will Captain Sandy Yawn Ever Work With Kyle Viljoen Again? 
          

Captain Sandy then shared how she feels about her future with Kyle. She revealed she’d like to work with him again on Below Deck and added that it is about “giving people opportunities to change.” The kindhearted Captain claimed that the only way to know if someone has changed is to give them a chance to show that. She feels Kyle has indeed corrected his toxic behavior and would be a great asset to her team in a future season. The Below Deck franchise Captain claimed she’d give Kyle the opportunity.




Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like viewers would share the same sentiments as Captain Sandy. Over the weeks, Kyle has been called out for his vile behavior towards Tumi and Natalya. What Kyle did on the show suggests he can never be a great friend, team player, or a good human being. After seeing Kyle’s unfiltered version on Below Deck Mediterranean, it’s highly unlikely viewers would want to watch him again. Anyone would be a much better second stew to Captain Sandy than the South African man.

Kyle is popular for being the drama queen of Below Deck. Therefore, it’s a big risk for Captain Sandy to work with him again. In season 8, Kyle crossed the line when he psychologically abused Natalya and forced her to quit the show. He’s unstable, wild, and simply unprofessional. The best thing would have been for Captain Sandy to fire Kyle and teach him a lesson. However, she didn’t do it out of her motherly nature, forgiveness, and kindness. Hopefully, Captain Sandy will open her eyes and see Kyle for what he is before he messes up her record on Below Deck Mediterranean.






Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 pm EST on Bravo.
