<p>Summary</p>
<p>La Brea&rsquo;s upcoming third season will be its last, premiering on NBC on January 9. The series follows the Harris family as they navigate a mysterious primeval land after being transported through a sinkhole in Los Angeles.   Creator David Appelbaum promises an emotionally cathartic ending for the beloved characters, with epic visuals, surprises, and a gripping story that will leave fans satisfied.   The show&rsquo;s final season was planned from the beginning, allowing the writers to craft a satisfying conclusion. Appelbaum believes that the series finale is the best episode they&rsquo;ve ever done, combining action, emotion, and a long-awaited reunion for the Harris family.</p>
<p>NBC&rsquo;s La Brea is set to end after its upcoming third season, which will premiere on the network on Tuesday, January 9. Consisting of six episodes, the series picks up after Eve is sucked into a sinkhole and transported to a mysterious time. It&rsquo;s up to Gavin, Izzy, and Josh to find a way to bring her back to 10,000 B.C., so the Harris family can reunite once and for all.</p>
<p>David Appelbaum serves as the creator, showrunner, and executive producer of La Brea. Appelbaum is most well-known for his work on NCIS: New Orleans, The Mentalist, and The Enemy Within. Eoin Macken, Zyra Gorecki, Chiké Okonkwo, Rohan Mirchandaney, Lily Santiago, Josh Mckenzie, Jon Seda, Nicholas Gonzalez, Jack Martin, Veronica St. Clair, Tonantzin Carmelo, and Natalie Zea make up the main cast.</p>

<p>Screen Rant interviewed David Appelbaum about condensing La Brea&rsquo;s final seasons into six episodes and whether fans will receive a sense of closure in the series finale.</p>
<p>David Appelbaum Talks La Brea Season 3</p>
<p>Screen Rant: How does it feel to be coming to the end of La Brea and bringing all these characters&rsquo; journeys to completion?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: It&rsquo;s definitely bittersweet. It&rsquo;s been such an amazing journey. I&rsquo;ve been working on this for four and a half years and there were so many challenges and so much time and effort put into it. There&rsquo;s something sad about seeing something that you love so much ending, but at the same time, I feel really proud of how we&rsquo;re able to wrap things up and really give the audience an emotionally cathartic ending for these characters that they care about.
We&rsquo;re able to create a really exciting and gigantic season. I think it&rsquo;s our most epic season in terms of visual effects, in terms of production, and in terms of surprises. I think all of it makes for a season that really is going to grip the audience and people who care about the show are really going to be into it. There are a lot of emotions, but it&rsquo;s mixed, for sure.</p>
<p>Things were obviously up in the air with the strikes, so how early on when you were writing season 3 did you know this would be the last one?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: We knew from the beginning of writing. That&rsquo;s what we were told before we started the season. While it&rsquo;s certainly disappointing to know that it&rsquo;s ending, it&rsquo;s also useful in terms of how you craft stories, because you can really write to the ending. The first thing that we figured out as a writing group was, &ldquo;Where do we want to bring all the characters?&rdquo; And then once we have those ideas, we could really craft all the stories around that. A lot of shows don&rsquo;t get that luxury. A lot of shows just end, and they weren&rsquo;t able to write to good endings, and then the audience is frustrated.
I hope no one in the audience will feel frustrated by this ending. I think the series finale is our best episode we&rsquo;ve ever done. It&rsquo;s the biggest episode, and it&rsquo;s also the most emotional episode, and everything is building towards that. It&rsquo;s really one long emotional and action adventure story that we&rsquo;re telling in the season. It&rsquo;s really exciting that we got to do it this way and that people are soon going to get to experience it for themselves.</p>
<p>Were you able to stick to the original ending that you had planned, or did you have to deviate given the six episodes you had to close out the story?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: There were certain landmarks and things that I knew I wanted to happen from the very beginning from when I conceived the show—the core things. There were a lot of stories and journeys that changed and shifted along the way based on feedback we would get from other producers or executives, or just different ideas that would come in from other writers or the cast themselves. It&rsquo;s really about being open to what the best idea is a lot of times, but other times, you want to stay true to what you know the show is. It&rsquo;s really a balancing act that I&rsquo;ve had to do along the way.</p>
<p>So much happened in the season 2 finale, but why did you decide it would be the best creative decision to have Eve be the one who is sucked into the portal and separated from her family?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: From the beginning of the show, the heart of it has been about a divided family that&rsquo;s trying to get back to each other. In the opening of the pilot, Eve and Josh are separated from Gavin and Izzy, but then we&rsquo;ve had different iterations of the family being separated along the way, whether physically or emotionally. Even when they did get back together in season 2, the family was divided over James, Gavin&rsquo;s father, so this is just another version of that same story, but in a different way.
Now it&rsquo;s Eve who&rsquo;s taken away from the family, and how do they get back to her? That&rsquo;s the core emotional story of the show that I&rsquo;ve always wanted to stick to and finding different iterations of it, and now whether we can get her back where she is, and can the family be reunited? Those are some of the big questions of the season.</p>
<p>There’s also the revelation that Gavin has a sister who may be a bit of an antagonist. We’re not really sure yet. Was it always the plan for him to have a sibling or is this something that developed as you were writing season 2?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: I always knew he would have a sibling. When and where we would encounter that person, and who they are, specifically, are things that we&rsquo;ve adjusted over time. He has a complicated and interesting familial history with 10,000 B.C. and with the creation of time travel that I knew I wanted to extend beyond just his father or his mother. There are other strands. That&rsquo;s a story that we continue to tell in season 3—who Gavin is and what his backstory is. There are going to be a lot of surprising elements, not just about the sister, but of his backstory that inform all the things that we&rsquo;ve learned before and also might be the key to how they ultimately get home.</p>
<p>One of the things I love about TV is how it can surprise even the people who are creating it. With that being said, was there a character or relationship that caught you off guard and caused you to deviate from your original plan?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: I think one of the relationships that I didn&rsquo;t conceive of originally was Lucas and Veronica&rsquo;s relationship. I knew I wanted to bring in Lucas visa vie his relationship with Marybeth, his mother who passed away. Veronica had a much different story in the beginning where she was, essentially, a captor of a kidnapped girl. Those two characters have grown and changed in ways that I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected.
Now they&rsquo;re together and about to have a kid. The two biggest outcasts are now having the most human and relatable story of anyone, really. That is something that I didn&rsquo;t necessarily see coming—characters who might be antagonists have come into their own and have undergone such huge journeys for themselves. Now they&rsquo;re going to bring a new baby into the world. It&rsquo;s an exciting one.</p>
<p>If you had additional time, was there a plot line in particular that you wish you could’ve had the chance to explore or expand on?</p>
<p>David Appelbaum: There are a lot of stories. We have so many series regulars, and the ability of time travel can go to so many different places. There were definitely a lot of different stories that I had in my head that I wanted to tell, but knowing what the constraints of this season were, we just focused on what the stories were that would bring it to the most satisfying and emotional and exciting conclusion and based it around that.
The show had the ability to go in lots of different directions. There were a lot of different strands and discursive places we could have gone, but I think this season is the best season. We basically looked at everything that we could have done and chosen the best versions of them. I think it&rsquo;s really going to be an impactful third season.</p>
