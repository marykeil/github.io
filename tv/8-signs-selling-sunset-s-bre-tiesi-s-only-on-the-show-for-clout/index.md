## Literature Review
Selling Sunset left Bre Tiesi&#39;s journey on an unfinished note at the end of the recent season, but it seems like she&#39;s only using the show for clout.




Selling Sunset season 7 showed off the Oppenheim Group’s agents, including Bre Tiesi who only seems to be part of the show for clout. Though Bre has only been part of Selling Sunset for the last 2 seasons, she’s ratcheted up the drama during her time on the series. While Bre claims she wants to stay to drama-free, she’s been involved in a huge feud on Selling Sunset in the last few years. On top of that, has been bringing her drama with Nick Cannon, who she shares a son with, to the show. Bre remains tight-lipped on her relationship but allows it to be dragged on the series.
While Bre has been open about the fact that she and Nick don’t have a defined relationship, she’s been adamant that others aren’t allowed to comment on her relationship status. For Bre, the attitude she brings to Selling Sunset gives off an aloofness that allows her to seem like she doesn’t care what’s happening. It seems like Bre cares about the perception she has from the series, as her persona seems to be all about chasing clout. Bre may not care to be a part of the show beyond Selling Sunset season 7, but she enjoys the following it brings.









 








 8  Bre Doesn&#39;t Seem To Know Much About Real Estate 
Bre Is Licensed, But Doesn&#39;t Show It Off
        

Although Bre claims to be an expert at selling luxury real estate, she often seems out of place and confused when she heads into a listing. Walking clients through potential homes, Bre sometimes mixes up the details of the spaces she’s showing. Though her real estate prowess must have been good enough to convince Jason Oppenheim and Brett Oppenheim to hire her at the Oppenheim Group offices, it’s possible that she simply has higher level connections and less real estate knowledge than she let on. Bre’s clientele are full of high-end, moneyed celebrities, but the truth behind her experience has yet to be proven.





 7  Bre&#39;s Scenes On Selling Sunset Are Overdramatic 
Bre Focuses On The Drama
        

While Bre always brings it in her time on Selling Sunset, her scenes were the most overdramatic of the season. Bre’s feud with Chelsea Lazkani has been difficult to watch, especially with Bre getting the majority of the office on her side. Bre’s claimed there don’t need to be sides to the argument but has also made it clear she wants support from her colleagues. In her time on Selling Sunset season 7, Bre was overdramatic and overreacting about every little problem, making it clear she’s simply trying to catch views.





 6  Bre&#39;s Flashy Wardrobe Is Meant To Be Memorable 
Bre&#39;s Style Is Eye-Catching


Bre’s wardrobe isn’t specific to her time on Selling Sunset, but the overly flashy outfits she wears are always meant to be eye-catching. The trendy wardrobe Bre brings to the series doesn’t exactly stand out against the rest of the clothes that the Selling Sunset season 7 cast wears, but they do make it clear she’s come to the series to show-off. Bre’s always trying to look her best, but sometimes her outfits can be too much, making her look overdressed or materialistic instead of professional. Rather than bringing the level of glamour she’s hoping for, Bre finds herself looking overly flashy and out of place.





 5  Bre Is Always The Center Of The Drama 
Bre Needs To Be The Focal Point
        

Though Bre swears she doesn’t get dramatic with others, she’s been the center of the drama on Selling Sunset season 6 and 7. From her feud with Chelsea to her indecisive end to the season, Bre has been one of the most dramatic figures on the series to date. Bringing her own personal drama into the show, Bre has made it difficult for there to be a problem without her name on it. Though Chrishell Stause and Nicole Young also have their own drama throughout the season, the problems surrounding Bre have been far more prevalent.





 4  Bre&#39;s Relationships On Selling Sunset Aren&#39;t Genuine 
Bre&#39;s Connections Are Disingenuous
        

Although Bre has advocated for the friendships she’s tried to make on Selling Sunset, nearly all the relationships she’s made during her time on the series seem disingenuous. From her friendships with Chrishell, Emma Hernan, and Amanza Smith, Bre’s relationships seem like surface-level, sometimes overly professional relationships rather than the friendships she likes to tout them as. Bre has used the friendships she’s created on Selling Sunset to find clout online, tagging her colleagues in posts and sharing things on her Instagram stories that will bring her closer to the center of attention. Bre’s chosen to pursue popularity by using her castmates instead of looking for genuine friendship.





 3  Bre Has  d Herself Off From Personal Selling Sunset Storylines 
Bre Doesn&#39;t Open Up About Her Personal Life
        

Although Bre speaks out about her personal life and her relationship with Nick, she also closes Selling Sunset off from filming her personal life. Though she shares things about her personal life online, giving her followers a taste of what it’s like to live like Bre, she leaves Selling Sunset viewers in the dark about the way she lives her life. It’s interesting to see what Bre seems to feel comfortable sharing, especially considering her personal life is a huge plot point for Selling Sunset season 7. Rather than taking control of the narrative on a show that respects her, Bre allows viewers to make their own judgment calls.





 2  Bre Picks &amp; Chooses What To Share About Her Famous Co-Parent 
Bre Stays Quiet About Her Relationship With Nick


 







While Bre has continued to be vocal about her relationship with Nick and the two co-parenting their son, Legendary, she has also made the choice to pick and choose what she shares on Selling Sunset. This is Bre’s right, but the fact that she allows Nick and their son to be discussed on the show in the first place is confusing. Considering she recoils any time someone brings up her relationship status with Nick or the arrangement they have for their son, Bre’s choice to talk about him at all is strange. The fact that she appears open about Nick makes it clear she’s using his name for fame.





 1  Bre&#39;s Social Media Presence Is Also Clout-Chasing 
Bre&#39;s Social Media Is Like Her Selling Sunset Persona


Bre has been a presence on social media long before her time on Selling Sunset, but the fact that she already had a following just proves she’s been chasing fame for a long time. Posing in the same style of wardrobe she wears on Selling Sunset season 7 and bringing Nick in for photos often, Bre’s social media presence is nearly as clout chasing as her persona on the Netflix series. Though Bre may not return for Selling Sunset’s next installment, she’s been building a fan base that will likely follow her to her next project.
