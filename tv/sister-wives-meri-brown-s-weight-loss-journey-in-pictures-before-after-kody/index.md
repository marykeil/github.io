## Literature Review
Sister Wives’ Meri Brown has achieved an impressive fitness transformation after splitting from Kody Brown. She looks fantastic in her new photos.




Meri Brown from Sister Wives has transformed into a new woman since her split from Kody Brown. The former family matriarch was the first woman Kody courted. She was an ideal match for his polygamous lifestyle and believed in having sister wives. In the early 90s, Meri allowed Kody to bring more wives into their family and turn their monogamous relationship into a plural marriage. She was happy to expand her family with the man and accepted Janelle Brown and Christine Brown as her sister wives. Little did she know that her approval would forever change her life and future with Kody.




In 2010, Sister Wives premiered and showed Meri, Kody, Christine, and Janelle welcoming Robyn Bronw into their family. After Robyn joined the family, the Brown family patriarch melted the ring Meri gave him. He got a new symbol of love that depicted his ongoing relationship with his four wives. Kody didn’t show his first wife the affection she deserved, which led Meri to fall for a catfish in 2015. The infidelity made Kody despise her even more, leading to their breakup in Sister Wives season 18.

 Meri Brown Looked Very Thin This Thanksgiving 

 

Meri suffered physically, emotionally, and mentally during her marriage with Kody, so her fans were delighted to see her newer social media posts in 2023, which revealed that she had significantly improved her health. Meri recently shared a photo on Thanksgiving. She was smiling and wore a cherry blossom-colored top, looking like a million bucks. Meri had a whole new positive attitude around her, making her look nearly a decade younger.




Meri used her Thanksgiving post to highlight that she’s the happiest she’s been in years. Apart from her lean appearance, she had a glow about her that was exhibited through her physically and her new style. Meri embraced a much more stylish side-part hairstyle that made her face appear long and chiseled. She wore a gold necklace and light makeup that complimented her natural beauty. Meri hasn’t revealed how much weight she lost, but she looked like a new person in her photo from Lake Michigan. She also seemed cheerful, proven by her lovely caption.

Most Sister Wives fans were surprised and overjoyed to witness Meri’s weight-loss transformation. Social media users were supportive and praised Meri with kind words. An Instagram user mentioned how Meri looked incredible and added, “it’s almost like your reversing time.” Another user shared something similar and wrote, “anyone else noticed that divorce in Kody gets you like 25 years off your age.” While many asked Meri for her secret, she hasn’t replied. However, her split from Kody is likely one of the biggest reasons she&#39;s been able to improve herself. 






 Meri Looks Different After Leaving Kody 
         

Meri’s revenge body seems to be a result of her moving away from Kody and the Brown family drama. She has been traveling a lot since her divorce, which probably helped Meri in her weight loss journey. Meri has been to Disneyland numerous times in the last 12 months, attended Gwendlyn Brown’s wedding, visited New York City, and much more. She has also let go of her old sedentary lifestyle and has become more active, such as hanging out with friends on Friday nights and simply living her best life.

Meri’s posts reveal that she prefers making moments and building new memories nowadays. She’s probably trying to overcome her past by creating a fun present, positively impacting her life. The Sister Wives star celebrated all the holidays in 2023, sporting new outfits and showing off her fit new physique. In October, Meri wore a black nun outfit and went to a live event to celebrate Halloween. Later that month, she traveled to a pumpkin patch and posted a picture from the farm, showing her toned legs in slim-fit jeans.






 Meri Regains Confidence &amp; Charm After Saying No To Kody’s &#34;Barndominium&#34; 
         

If Meri was still stuck with Kody, she wouldn’t be able to do what she’s doing now. Kody hoped to keep her trapped like an animal in his so-called “barndominium.” Thankfully, Meri didn’t listen to him and moved on to live her new life on her terms. Striking weight loss transformation and glow can only be reached when a person is happy from the inside and outside. Meri is glowing like a firefly because Kody is no longer around to trap her in his jar of negativity.



 Why Meri Brown Gained Weight? (And How She May Have Lost It) 
         

Meri looked healthy and fit when Sister Wives premiered in 2010. However, her life turned upside down in the next few years, which led her to put on some weight. From the catfish scandal to the stress of everyday life, Meri wasn&#39;t in a happy place for years after that. In Sister Wives season 18, Meri was able to lose weight, but she still looked sad and depressed. It was clear Meri lost her glow but had achieved it since moving away from Kody and Robyn.




Meri isn’t the only Sister Wives cast member who has been on a weight-loss journey since 2022. Kody’s other two former wives, Christine and Janelle, have done the same and posted about it on Instagram. The two ladies have credited their weight loss to a dietary supplement they often promote on social media. In comparison, Meri hasn’t been very open about her fitness journey or shared how she has been able to turn her life around. For now, it’s easy to assume that the Sister Wives star’s new single life has helped her become her true self.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.
