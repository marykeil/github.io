## Literature Review
Big Brother fans have been loving Big Brother Reindeer Games, but there&#39;s one competitor who they don&#39;t want to see take the prize on the spin-off.




Big Brother Reindeer Games is full of past Big Brother personalities who fans are loving on the series, with the exception of one competitor they don’t want to see win the $100,000 prize. With just two episodes of BB Reindeer Games left, the stakes are high as the final six competitors head into the final Santa’s Showdown to see who will make the final four. Frankie Grande, Nicole Franzel, Xavier Prather, Britney Haynes, and Taylor Hale are all vying for their spot in the Reindeer Games finale, hoping to compete for the cash prize and win the game. For the Big Brother legends in the cast, winning would make history.




Some fans will be happy with any of the Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 competitors winning the game, but others are hoping to see anyone but BB 16 competitor Frankie Grande take the title. According to Reddit users including u/wintersnowrainbows, “Anyone but Frankie” should win Big Brother Reindeer Games. Much like his initial Big Brother appearance, viewers find Frankie irritating. Reddit user u/tonybeatle shared, “Anyone but Frankie…I bet the editors hate him because he’s always talking. He has to make everything about him.” While Frankie has changed since his first BB appearance, fans still struggle with his personality.


 How Is Frankie Grande Doing On Big Brother Reindeer Games? 
          

Frankie’s appearance on Big Brother Reindeer Games may not be something fans are happy with, but he’s been doing an incredible job competitively on the series. During the first episodes, Frankie went into Santa’s Showdown twice, managing to escape elimination in the second and third episodes of BB Reindeer Games before winning the Naughty Or Nice power during the most recent episode of the spin-off series. Frankie’s appearance has solidified his status as a competitive beast, making it clear he should be respected by the Big Brother community for his competition prowess. While Frankie hasn’t competed since BB 16, he’s been active about Big Brother on social media for years.





 

On top of his status as a competition beast, Frankie has done well socially during Big Brother Reindeer Games. While he’s definitely one of the biggest threats in the game, it’s clear he’s made connections in the game that he’s been able to leverage in order to maintain his safety. Though he’s faced Santa’s Showdown twice, Frankie has been able to keep himself safe through his alliance with Nicole and Britney, who are both working with him and Taylor separately. Frankie’s also been aligned with Xavier during the game, making him nearly untouchable on Big Brother Reindeer Games. While viewers find him grating, he’s an asset to the cast.

With Big Brother Reindeer Games a massive success for viewers who came into watching the series with incredibly low expectations, it’s possible that the ending could be a disappointment if Frankie finishes with the win. Though many have been displeased watching Frankie, it seems to be more of a personal issue with his persona than an issue with him as a player. Though he’s competitively threatening and socially adept, Frankie’s presence on Big Brother Reindeer Games has been met with criticism.
