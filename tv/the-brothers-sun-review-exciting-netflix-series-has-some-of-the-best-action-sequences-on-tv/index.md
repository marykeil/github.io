# The Brothers Sun Review Exciting Netflix Series Has Some Of The Best Action Sequences On TV


## SUMMARY 



  The Brothers Sun on Netflix features amazing fight scenes and a likable cast, but the story and dialogue can be weak at times.   Justin Chien delivers an impressive performance as an action star, while the rest of the cast has highs and lows in delivering their lines and matching the tone of the show.

## Literature Review
The Brothers Sun has some of the best hand-to-hand combat you will see on TV. Paired with a great cast &amp; a fun story, the series is one to watch.




Netflix&#39;s TV shows vary more than any other streaming service — the distance between Mindhunter and 70 percent of their TV catalog is vast. But somewhere near such highbrow series are the most universal Netflix has to offer, and The Brothers Sun fits that bill. Creators Byron Wu and Brad Falchuck really nailed the family action comedy. The show is accessible to everyone, and it has some of the most amazing fight scenes you will see all year, as well as an extraordinarily likable cast, including Michelle Yeoh. The Brothers Sun might not hit the mark at every turn, but when it does, the series is a knockout.





 

When unforeseen circumstances leave his dad and Triad boss Big Sun in a coma, Charles (Justin Chien), a Taipei gangster, must return to Los Angeles where his mother and brother live in hiding. The consequences of the family business rear their ugly head, but Charles&#39;s brother Bruce (Sam Song Li) is totally in the dark about it. Mama Sun (Yeoh), however, is not surprised by the turn of events and tries to balance the safety of Bruce with the guilt of leaving Charles behind. As the family grows closer, a conspiracy comes to light, and they must solve the mystery surrounding the targeting of Triad bosses.



The standard script is elevated by charisma and fierce action set pieces, but it&#39;s also hampered by weak story and dialogue.








 The Brothers Sun Has Amazing Action, But The Performances &amp; Story Underwhelm 
         

The fight scenes throughout The Brothers Sun are simply amazing. Chien is a revelation as an action star and brings a magnetism to every set piece. The scene featuring a drone following his onslaught against two dozen goons is perfection. As the show progresses, contributions from Jon Xue Zhang, who was the stunt double for Ma Dong-Seok in Eternals, prove pivotal to making the action sequences a must-watch. Though The Brothers Sun also has a slew of explosions and gun play, they never reach the heights of its hand-to-hand combat. HBO’s Warrior might be the only recent show with better fight choreography.

In terms of performances, The Brothers Sun has its highs and lows. The entire cast is charming, but the series&#39; tone frequently clashes with their line delivery. Li is, at times, hilarious and, at others, completely outmatched in dramatic scenes. Yeoh has one of the highest approval ratings in Hollywood right now and playing a Taiwanese mob boss sounds like a match made in heaven. But the version of The Brothers Sun that&#39;s a bright and crowd-pleasing binge forces exposition and clichéd dialogue on her that dims her talent.

Chien is the standout of the series, to be sure, but he sometimes looks longingly into the distance for no reason. It can be distracting. Whether it&#39;s a failure of performance or direction is irrelevant because its inclusion serves as a reminder of the show&#39;s limitations. I couldn&#39;t help but think while watching that the FX version of The Brothers Sun would allow for comedy, great acting, and the same high level of action without the extra baggage of corny dialogue and overused tropes.




  9:09                       The Brothers Sun Interview: Justin Chien On Sibling Bonding &amp; Martial Arts Mastery   The Brothers Sun star Justin Chien discusses his excitement at working with Michelle Yeoh, building a family bond onscreen, and filming fight scenes.    

The standard script is elevated by the cast&#39;s charisma and fierce action, but it&#39;s also hampered by a weak story and dialogue. That dichotomy is what also makes it the perfect Netflix show. It isn&#39;t bogged down by CGI, it&#39;s an old-school martial arts movie for film nerds, and a fun watch for casual viewers. Li&#39;s character has, at best, a wonky moral compass and, while The Brothers Sun doesn’t offer much in the way of a nuanced narrative, it has some of the best hand-to-hand combat you will see on television this year, and that&#39;s more than enough to recommend it.



The Brothers Sun is now streaming on Netflix. The show consists of eight episodes and is rated TV-MA.
