<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There are some plot twists that were so unexpected and out of left-field that it left viewers asking if the writers had even planned them.</p>
<p>Some TV plot twists went so far out of left field it appeared as if the creators just made them up on the spot, but they were planned out and aired as intended. Unexpected plot twists can be an exciting and engaging part of the television viewing experience, but when they don’t feel like they align with previously established events, they can leave audiences scratching their heads and wondering if they were even planned that way at all. While some of these twists ended up working out for the better, they still came across as oddly chaotic and disorderly.
Long-running series often must come up with new twists to keep audiences engaged but end up going against the character’s natural motivations or traits. Shocking romances, strange decisions, and the character&rsquo;s mental struggles have resulted in unforeseen twists that madeviewers question how far in advance the writers decided to go this way. There are some plot twists, such as in the dream reveal in Dallas, that, although planned before the end of the season, still felt like the show was retconning, while others, like Joey and Rachel’s romance on Friends, just looked like they were running out of ideas.</p>
<p>8  Debra Morgan’s Fate
Dexter (2006 – 2013)</p>
<p>Dexter<br>
Crime
Mystery
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    October 31, 2010     Cast    David Zayas , Michael C. Hall , Lauren Velez , C. S. Lee , James Remar , Jennifer Carpenter , Desmond Harrington , Julie Benz     Seasons    8</p>
<p>The Showtime series Dexter had its fair share of controversial plot twists. However, there was one that stood out as very disorderly, and that was the fate of Dexter’s sister Debra Morgan. After being shot and becoming brain-dead, Dexter mercifully pulled the plug and dropped her body in the sea in the Dexter finale. This was a poignant and tragic moment as planned by the writers, however, something about it felt off, and that a character as strong and determined as Debra should die at the hands of a mercy killing was not in line with her narrative arc.</p>
<p>7  It Was All A Dream
Dallas (1978 – 1991)</p>
<p>Dallas (1978)<br>
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    April 2, 1978     Cast    Larry Hagman , Patrick Duffy     Seasons    14</p>
<p>The soap opera Dallas was known for its viewer-grabbing cliffhangers and outrageous illogical plot points; however, nothing can stop its ninth “dream season.” This was an entire season that was revealed to be a dream experienced by Pam and nothing that had occurred was considered canon. This twist reveal allowed the deceased character of Bobby Ewing to return, and Dallas was able to undo major plot points. While it was uncertain exactly at what point the creators decided to bring back Bobby, it felt like it cheapened the realism of Dallas and nothing after it felt as high stakes.</p>
<p>6  Glenn Rhee Dumpster Scene
The Walking Dead (2010 – 2022)</p>
<p>The Walking Dead<br>
Horror
Thriller
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    October 31, 2010     Cast    Steven Yeun , Andrew Lincoln , Chandler Riggs , Laurie Holden , Jeffrey DeMunn , Sarah Wayne Callies , Melissa McBride , Norman Reedus , Jon Bernthal , Iron E. Singleton     Seasons    11</p>
<p>The Walking Dead was never afraid to shock audiences with the death of beloved characters and Glenn’s seeming demise at the hands of a pack of brain-thirsty walkers in season six felt like it was going to be one of the series most tragic. The Glenn dumpster scene appeared as if his guts had been ripped apart by the undead, however, it was later revealed he survived, and these were another body&rsquo;s intensities. While this twist was planned, the graphic depiction of Glenn’s non-death made it feel unplanned and like The Walking Dead was stretching itself past the limits of believability.</p>
<p>5  Dennis Reynolds Leaving For North Dakota
It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005 – Present)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia<br>
Comedy</p>
<p>Release Date    August 4, 2005     Cast    Charlie Day , Rob McElhenney , Kaitlin Olson , Glenn Howerton , Danny DeVito     Seasons    16</p>
<p>After 12 seasons It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia looked like it was about to undergo a major change with the possibility that Dennis Reynolds, played by Glenn Howerton, was going to exit the series. The finale ended on a cliffhanger where Dennis decided he was moving to North Dakota. This cliffhanger was a result of Howerton landing the lead role on A.P. Bio, and a perception that he could not appear in both series. However, when season 13 premiered Dennis quickly returned, and it turned out the Always Sunny cast was just playing into the mystery, and he never left.</p>
<p>4  Joey Tribbiani and Rachel Green’s Romance
Friends (1994 – 2004)</p>
<p>Friends<br>
Comedy
Drama
Sitcom</p>
<p>Release Date    September 22, 1994     Cast    Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer     Seasons    10</p>
<p>The addition of a new romance between the cast of Friends in season 8 felt like absolute blasphemy, especially as it concerned Rachel Green, whose on-again-off-again relationship with Ross Geller viewers had been rooting for since season one. That was why the plot twist of Rachel and Joey Tribbiani getting together felt like it came completely out of left field to the point that even the cast was not happy with it. While this plot twist may have been planned, it was the strongest indication that the writers did not know what to do next and the series was running its course.
&ldquo;[Matt] LeBlanc said it felt incestuous (especially uncomfortable after so many years of cultivating a brotherly bond with the female characters).&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Kelsey Miller’s book I’ll Be There For You: The One About Friends, the cast was uncomfortable with the Joey and Rachel storyline. “[Matt] LeBlanc said it felt incestuous (especially uncomfortable after so many years of cultivating a brotherly bond with the female characters),” she said. “Everyone knows that Ross and Rachel are supposed to be together, and we’ve spent 10 years keeping them apart,” LaBlanc said. (via People.)</p>
<p>3  Mitch Kessler Dies In A Car Crash
The Morning Show (2019 – Present)</p>
<p>The Morning Show<br>
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    November 1, 2019     Cast    Marcia Gay Harden , Holland Taylor , Bel Powley , Tom Irwin , Reese Witherspoon , Jack Davenport , Ruairi O&rsquo;Connor , Greta Lee , Gugu Mbatha-Raw , Hasan Minhaj , Desean Terry , Jennifer Aniston , Nestor Carbonell , Julianna Margulies , Valeria Golino , Mark Duplass , Janina Gavankar , Karen Pittman , Steve Carell , Billy Crudup , Tara Karsian     Streaming Service(s)    Apple TV+</p>
<p>When the first season of The Morning Show first aired in 2019, it felt like a relevant examination of contemporary issues. The theme of sexual misconduct was primarily explored through the character of Mitch Kessler, played by Steve Carell, who in an unexpected twist was killed off in a car crash during the second season. While this felt abrupt from a narrative viewpoint, it was planned by the showrunner Kerry Ehrin who felt the character had effectively run its course (via Variety.) Originally she planned for Mitch’s exit to be more ambiguous, but Carell requested a more active departure.</p>
<p>2  Daenerys Targaryan Becoming The Mad Queen
Game of Thrones (2011 – 2019)</p>
<p>Game Of Thrones<br>
Drama
Action
Adventure</p>
<p>Release Date    April 11, 2011     Cast    Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage     Seasons    8</p>
<p>In Game of Thrones season 8, Daenerys Targaryen officially turned into the Mad Queen in a move that felt oddly unplanned and against the established narrative arc of her character. For the previous seven seasons, Game of Thrones had carefully built up Daenerys as a savior for the oppressed and a potential candidate to come out on top and lead the Seven Kingdoms. While Game of Thrones may have always planned for Daenerys to lose her mind and turn into a villain, it was a dissatisfying conclusion to her story and felt chaotic and unplanned.</p>
<p>1  Tracy McConnell’s Death and Ted Mosby Ending Up With Robin Scherbatsky
How I Met Your Mother (2005 – 2014)</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother<br>
Comedy
Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    September 19, 2005     Cast    Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget     Seasons    9</p>
<p>The controversial ending of How I Met Your Mother was a disappointment to many viewers as there was a perception it undid many of the previously established character arcs. The reveal that the mother of Ted Mosby’s children was Tracy McConnell, only to have her character quickly die and Ted quickly reunite with his long-time love interest Robin Scherbatsky felt like an unearned and haphazard conclusion to the series. Nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother building up to Tracy’s reveal, only to end with a conclusion viewers could have guessed from the pilot felt like a cop out.
