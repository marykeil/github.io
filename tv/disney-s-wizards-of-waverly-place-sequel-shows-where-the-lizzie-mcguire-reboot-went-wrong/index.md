## Literature Review

The plans for the Wizards of Waverly Place revival are showing what the Lizzie McGuire reboot did wrong, ultimately leading to its cancelation.




Disney’s latest sequel announcement is a continuation of the TV series Wizards of Waverly Place, which further shows where the canceled Lizzie McGuire reboot went wrong. Disney Channel is home to some of the most popular and successful teen TV shows of the 2000s, of which many were the big boost in the careers of some famous former Disney stars. Among them is Wizards of Waverly Place, created by Todd J. Greenwald. Wizards of Waverly Place premiered in 2007 and ran for a total of four seasons, coming to an end in 2012.




Wizards of Waverly Place follows siblings Alex (Selena Gomez), Justin (David Henrie), and Max Russo (Jake T. Austin), who are trained by their father, Jerry (David DeLuise), a former wizard who gave up his powers to marry his wife, Theresa (Maria Canals Barrera), a mortal. The siblings must train as one day one of them will retain their powers permanently while the rest will lose them. Now, over a decade after the series finale, a Wizards of Waverly Place reboot is in development, and its plans are highlighting what went wrong with the failed Lizzie McGuire reboot.

                  8 Harsh Realities Of Rewatching Lizzie McGuire, 19 Years After It Ended   Lizzie McGuire remains a fan-favorite Disney Channel show decades after it first aired, but rewatching it today comes with harsh revelations.   


 Disney&#39;s Wizards Of Waverly Place Sequel Will Balance Its Former Cast &amp; A New Generation 
          




A Wizards Of Waverly Place reunion series had been talked about since 2017, though according to Henrie in 2020, no formal discussions took place with Disney (via E! News). After rumors and speculation about a Wizards Of Waverly Place revival, the project was finally confirmed and formally announced in 2024. The details known so far are that Disney has ordered a pilot for the show, which will be executive-produced by Gomez and Henrie, who will also star in, at least, this first episode of the revival series.

The Wizards Of Waverly Place revival will also introduce a new generation of characters, played by Janice LeAnn Brown, Alkaio Thiele, and Mimi Gianopulos. The series will kick off after a mysterious incident at WizTech that led Justin to give up his powers, after which he opts to live a normal life with his wife and kids. However, when a young wizard arrives at his doorstep in need of training, Justin will now take the role of mentor to ensure the future of the Wizard World. 

The Wizards Of Waverly Place sequel series, then, is bringing together the older version of the original characters who will now mentor a young wizard, making it accessible to both fans of the original series and a new generation of viewers.






 Wizards Of Waverly Place Is Showing Where The Lizzie McGuire Reboot Went Wrong 
          

Before the revival of Wizards Of Waverly Place, another beloved Disney Channel teen comedy TV series was in the process of getting a reboot: Lizzie McGuire. The Lizzie McGuire reboot was announced in 2019, and it would have followed a now 30-year-old Lizzie (Hilary Duff) navigating life working as an apprentice to an interior decorator, living in Brooklyn, and being engaged to a man who owned a restaurant in Manhattan – but when she found out he was cheating on her, she would have returned home to Los Angeles. Details about the Lizzie McGuire reboot were revealed after its cancelation, and the first episodes would have addressed topics like cheating and sex.

The Lizzie McGuire reboot was canceled after being deemed not family-friendly enough by Disney&#43; executives, but the details of the Wizards Of Waverly Place sequel series highlight another big problem with Lizzie’s return: it focused on being an adult sequel, while Wizards Of Waverly Place is aiming to be a series for kids and about kids, while also appealing to older viewers with the presence of two of the original cast members. It’s to be seen if the Wizards Of Waverly Place revival will succeed, and if it could push Disney to reconsider the Lizzie McGuire reboot.
