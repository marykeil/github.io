<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Some TV shows are best known for one specific quote that became so famous that even those who never watched the show use it in different situations.</p>
<p>TV shows from all genres have left a mark on pop culture thanks to many elements, including some memorable quotes, and some became so famous that even people who have never watched the show use them. Many TV shows are instantly recognizable thanks to their characters, who were so likable, relatable, funny, or interesting that they became the image of the show, while others became widely known for one specific scene that went viral either for its emotional charge, funny elements, or for some mistake caught by the audience.
Many TV shows have become part of TV history thanks to one quote that had a great impact on the audience. Some TV shows were defined by one specific quote that became so popular that even those who haven’t watched the show know exactly where it came from and who said it, and even use it in their daily lives. In some cases, that one quote became part of pop culture, so much so that it ended up defining an entire franchise and has been referenced and even parodied in other TV shows and movies due to its legacy.</p>
<p>10  The Mandalorian - “This is the way”
Said by Din Djarin</p>
<p>The Mandalorian left Star Wars fans with not just one of the best TV shows from this universe and the greatness of Grogu, but also with a quote that many now use in different contexts, regardless of knowing its full origin or not. The line that became Din Djarin’s (Pedro Pascal) catchphrase in The Mandalorian is “this is the way”, even though it was first spoken by the Armorer (Emily Swallow). The line is about what it means to be a Mandalorian and the code of traditions and ideals that come with being one, though not all Mandalorians follow this nor do they follow “the way” as Din and other Mandalorians do.</p>
<p>9  How I Met Your Mother - “It’s gonna be legen – wait for it, and I hope you’re not lactose intolerant ‘cause the second half of that word is – dary!”
Said by Barney Stinson</p>
<p>Throughout nine seasons, Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris) made sure to leave fans of How I Met Your Mother with a long list of memorable quotes. The most memorable ones are those that include his now famous “wait for it” dramatic pause, but the one that’s known and quoted by fans and those who have never watched an episode of How I Met Your Mother is the one where he combined “legendary” with “wait for it”. The result is a quote that is as funny as it is usable, and even though it has evolved to the point where it’s simply said “it’s gonna be legen – wait for it… – dary”, it’s still How I Met Your Mother’s most famous quote.</p>
<p>8  South Park - “Oh my God, they killed Kenny!”
(Mostly) said by Stan</p>
<p>South Park is packed with running gags that fit with the show’s unique and dark sense of humor. Among them is Kenny being killed in some absurd way at some point in every episode, leading one or more of his friends to exclaim “oh my God, they killed Kenny”. However, after many deaths, Kenny was semi-permanently killed in the episode “Kenny Dies”, though he later returned but now in a less recurrent role. South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker said they grew tired of finding ways to kill Kenny in almost every episode, and that Kenny was too much of a “prop” and was “not even a character” (via ESPN), but viewers still loved him.</p>
<p>7  The X-Files - “The truth is out there”
Said by Dana Scully</p>
<p>“The truth is out there” became The X-Files’ tagline and can be seen in the opening credits, right before the name of the show’s creator (Chris Carter) appears and the show begins. The line is fitting with the show’s themes of aliens and other supernatural entities being completely real, but Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson) gives it another, more personal meaning when she tells Agent Mulder (David Duchovny) that “the truth is out there, but so are lies”. This X-Files quote is so usable that it can fit in a variety of contexts, though everyone knows its origins are linked to one of the biggest sci-fi TV shows in TV history.</p>
<p>6  The Office - “That’s what she said!”
(Mostly) said by Michael Scott</p>
<p>The Office is one of the most quotable sitcoms in TV history, but one line/joke that is known by everyone, even those who have never watched the show is “that’s what she said”. The way to use this phrase is pretty simple: whenever someone says something that can be interpreted in a sexual way, another person says “that’s what she said”. Of course, this joke got Michael Scott (Steve Carell) into trouble many times as the joke is targeted at women, which led to reports about sexual harassment and more. Due to how easily it can be used in a conversation, “that’s what she said” is one of The Office’s biggest legacies, but it must be used responsibly.</p>
<p>5  Avatar: The Last Airbender - “All changed when the Fire Nation attacked”
Said by Katara</p>
<p>Not all TV quotes have a funny origin, and “all changed when the Fire Nation attacked” is one with a tragic backstory. The opening title sequence of the animated TV series Avatar: The Last Airbender has a voiceover narration by the character Katara, explaining the war between the Nations and how the Avatar, master of the four elements, will be the one to stop the Firebenders. Katara’s speech includes the phrase “all changed when the Fire Nation attacked”, which has now become a meme. What started as a tragic part of the history of the universe of Avatar: The Last Airbender has now become a joke among fans and those who have never watched the show, but that has also added to the show’s legacy.</p>
<p>4  Game of Thrones - “Winter is coming”
Said by Ned Stark</p>
<p>Game of Thrones is known for its action scenes, tragic and shocking moments, and its characters, but also for the quote/tagline “winter is coming”. The line was first spoken in the pilot episode and it was Ned Stark (Sean Bean) who said it, as a way to warn and remind his family that challenging times were fast approaching. Ned was right, and the Starks faced several obstacles and challenges for years, with “winter is coming” also becoming a warning for viewers about more drama and action coming in every season of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>3  Friends - “We were on a break!”
Said by Ross</p>
<p>Friends has a special place in TV history and became part of pop culture thanks to its characters, their most memorable moments (both funny and sad), and their catchphrases. Many Friends quotes are often used by fans, casual viewers, and those who have never watched the show, but perhaps the most famous (or infamous) one is Ross’ (David Schwimmer) “we were on a break!”. When Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) grew tired of Ross’ jealousy, she said they should take a break, and that same night, Ross slept with someone else, but went back with Rachel the following morning without telling her what happened. Rachel eventually learned about his one-night stand and what followed was Ross justifying his actions with “we were on a break” for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>Friends&rsquo; Infamous Break Wasn&rsquo;t Supposed To Happen (But It&rsquo;s Good It Did)
One of Friends&rsquo; most memorable moments was Ross and Rachel&rsquo;s &ldquo;break&rdquo;, which funny enough, wasn&rsquo;t planned, but it was necessary that it happened.</p>
<p>2  Doctor Who - “It’s bigger on the inside”
Said by various characters</p>
<p>Doctor Who might be confusing to those who have never watched it, but everyone knows exactly what “it’s bigger on the inside” means. The Doctor’s time machine/spacecraft, the TARDIS, looks like a police box on the outside, but inside, it’s much, much bigger than that. Every companion and person who enters the TARDIS for the first time is shocked at how it can be so big on the inside, with many of them saying the now iconic phrase “it’s bigger on the inside” or some variation of it. The first time this line was said in Doctor Who was in &ldquo;The Three Doctors&rdquo;, where the Doctor himself told Sargeant Benton “aren&rsquo;t you going to say it that it&rsquo;s bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Everybody else does”.</p>
<p>1  Star Trek - “Live long and prosper”
Said by Spock</p>
<p>Star Trek gave the sci-fi genre some of its most famous characters, ships, and stories, along with a phrase that went beyond the worlds of sci-fi and fantasy: “live long and prosper”. The quote comes from the legendary human-Vulcan Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and it’s often accompanied by the also iconic Vulcan salute. “Live long and prosper” is now part of pop culture, so much so that it has its own emoji, and though it’s an important part of Vulcan culture and the mythology of Star Trek, it has also become a respectful way of saying goodbye outside the world of Star Trek and among people who aren’t familiar with the legendary TV show (and the franchise).</p>
