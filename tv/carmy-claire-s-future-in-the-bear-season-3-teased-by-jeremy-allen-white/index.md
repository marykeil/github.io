## Literature Review
Following their devastating finale breakup, Carmy’s future with Claire in The Bear season 3 is addressed by lead actor Jeremy Allen White.




Carm and Claire&#39;s future in The Bear&#39;s season 3 is teased by Jeremy Allen White. Joining the cast of The Bear season 2 in a major recurring role, Molly Gordon played Claire, a close friend of White&#39;s Carmen &#34;Carmy&#34; Berzatto. The two rekindle their old spark in the second installment&#39;s early episodes. Although it appears to be going well, at least at first, their romance takes a harsh turn in the finale. Claire decides to end things with Carm after heartbreakingly overhearing about how much Carmy thinks their relationship is a distraction from his job as a chef.




Following his win at the 2024 Golden Globes, for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Series, White spoke of the relationship between Carmy and Claire in The Bear season 3. Per TVLine, he noted that Claire deserves an apology and hoped that some version of that would be included once he read the scripts.


I think Claire is so lovely and kind to Carmy. I think she deserves an apology, at the very least. So I hope there’s some version of that when I read the scripts.



 Could Healthy Relationships Work For The Bear Season 3? 
          

As brutal as the breakup between Claire and Carm is, with Claire realizing that she&#39;s more invested in the relationship than he&#39;ll ever be, it&#39;s arguably necessary for the sake of the show&#39;s success. The show thrives on the chaos and unhappiness that the characters feel. This is evidenced in the uncomfortably raw episode &#34;Fishes.&#34; Even if the FX/Hulu hit were to go in a more positive direction, as it has shown that it can do with the Richie-focused installment &#34;Forks&#34;, Carmy isn&#39;t at a point where he can function in a stable relationship.




                  A Small Change To The Bear Season 2&#39;s Ending Made Carmy &amp; Claire&#39;s Split So Much Worse   The Bear season 2 ended tragically, as Carmy loses the restaurant’s opening night and his relationship, but this ending was almost very different.    

That much is evident in the blowup that Carmy experiences in The Bear season 2 finale, which is what leads to Claire&#39;s breakup in the first place. Carm lashes out against Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and behaves in a self-sabotaging way. Whether it&#39;s Claire or a romantic relationship between Ayo Edebiri&#39;s Syd and Carmy, White&#39;s character has to deal with his own issues first.

Not much is known about The Bear season 3, though White has indicated that the award-winning dramedy will be back in the kitchen more often. Series creator Christopher Storer, executive producer Joanna Calo, and the rest of the show&#39;s team are sure to pick up on the fallout from an outstanding second outing. That may include bringing back Gordon for another guest run.






All episodes of The Bear are available on Hulu.
