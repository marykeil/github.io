  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Jamie and Claire’s relationship timeline on Outlander shows that the couple can withstand any obstacle, even being born in different centuries.</p>
<p>This article contains mentions of sexual assault, violence, and a miscarriage.</p>
<p>With so much time travel on Outlander, the relationship timeline between main characters Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) on the popular Starz series can be confusing to follow. In Outlander season 1, Claire finds herself transported from 1945 to the year 1743. She meets and falls in love with Jamie, but her husband Frank (Tobias Menzies) remains in the 1940s. Throughout their time together, Jamie and Claire reside in Scotland, France, Jamaica, and finally the American colonies. Even though Jamie and Claire are not from the same timeline, Claire realizes that what she shares with Jamie is stronger than her love for Frank.</p>
<p>Watch on Netflix</p>
<p>What makes the relationship so compelling is the idea that the two met by accident but are the loves of each other&rsquo;s lives. Jamie and Claire prove to be soulmates throughout Outlander by doing whatever it takes to keep the other person alive. Their story is one of survival and dedication as they consistently choose each other. Even though their commitment to one another is unquestionable in the later seasons of Outlander, Jamie and Claire continue to face trauma and obstacles throughout their journey to build and protect their own family unit across the show&rsquo;s timeline.</p>
<pre><code>              Outlander Timeline Explained   Here is a complete breakdown of the Outlander timeline and its rules about time travel, including everything from seasons 1 through 6.

When she touches one of the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, Claire wakes up in a new time period where she meets Jamie, a Scottish Highlander. Jamie and Claire&rsquo;s relationship timeline begins with her healing his injuries. This sets off the theme of their romance of always coming to one another&rsquo;s aid.

<p>Until this point in their relationship timeline, Claire was actively torn between her growing feelings for Jamie and her past love for Frank.

When Jamie is bitten by a venomous snake, it becomes a family effort to keep him alive, and Brianna is the one who comes up with a solution. In the season 5 finale, &ldquo;Never My Love,&rdquo; Jamie, Fergus, Roger, and Ian (John Bell) all come to the rescue of Claire after she is kidnapped.</p>

Jamie &amp; Claire Prepare For The American Revolution As Tensions Rise In The Colonies</p>
<p>Because Claire, Brianna, and Roger are all from the future, the three know the Revolutionary War is inevitable. As tensions rise in the backdrop of the show, the sixth season brings revelations to light and reminisces over everything that has happened throughout Jamie and Claire&rsquo;s relationship. In the Outlander season 6 finale, &ldquo;I Am Not Alone,&rdquo; Claire is charged with a murder she did not commit. Jamie reassures her that after everything they have been through they will survive.

<p>Season 7, Episode 1 - Episode 8
Jamie &amp; Claire Are Stuck In The Middle Of War</p>
<p>Though Jamie and Claire are united in their love for one another and their family in season 7, their family is pulled apart. Someone else&rsquo;s confession means that Claire isn&rsquo;t put to death for the murder she didn&rsquo;t commit at the end of the sixth season, but Jaime is nearly immediately conscripted into the army after. Instead of fleeing, Claire and the family decide to help fight. Of course, the family is missing Roger and Brianna because the duo have had to time travel to the future (but far into the future) to save the life of their new daughter.</p>
<p>The separation weighs on the family, but even after Jamie suggests Claire go to the future with them, she remains in the past with him, showing that she is done using time travel to escape danger for herself if she can&rsquo;t be with the love of her life. The rest of Outlander season 7 will have to bring much of the family back together.</p>
