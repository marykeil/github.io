This article contains mentions of sexual assault, violence, and a miscarriage.







With so much time travel on Outlander, the relationship timeline between main characters Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) on the popular Starz series can be confusing to follow. In Outlander season 1, Claire finds herself transported from 1945 to the year 1743. She meets and falls in love with Jamie, but her husband Frank (Tobias Menzies) remains in the 1940s. Throughout their time together, Jamie and Claire reside in Scotland, France, Jamaica, and finally the American colonies. Even though Jamie and Claire are not from the same timeline, Claire realizes that what she shares with Jamie is stronger than her love for Frank.

Even though their commitment to one another is unquestionable in the later seasons of Outlander, Jamie and Claire continue to face trauma and obstacles throughout their journey to build and protect their own family unit across the show&#39;s timeline.

Jamie &amp; Claire Are Stuck In The Middle Of War

Instead of fleeing, Claire and the family decide to help fight. Of course, the family is missing Roger and Brianna because the duo have had to time travel to the future (but far into the future) to save the life of their new daughter.




The separation weighs on the family, but even after Jamie suggests Claire go to the future with them, she remains in the past with him, showing that she is done using time travel to escape danger for herself if she can&#39;t be with the love of her life. The rest of Outlander season 7 will have to bring much of the family back together.
