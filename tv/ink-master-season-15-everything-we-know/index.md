Since its premiere in 2013, Ink Master has become a household series due to its unique premise of having tattoo artists compete in various tattooing and artistic challenges with a grand prize of $250,000. After the Ink Master season 14 finale aired in November 2022, the show returned to air almost a year later, on November 1, 2023, albeit with minor changes.




Joel Madden from Good Charlotte returns as hosts, while Nikko Hurtado and Ink Master season 8 winner Ryan Ashley return as judges. Three-time Ink Master champion DJ Tambe also joined the season&#39;s judging panel, replacing Ami James. However, Dave Navarro, featured in all previous seasons, does not reprise his role as &#34;Master of Chaos.&#34; Unlike the two previous seasons, Ink Master season 15 did not feature any returning contestants.
