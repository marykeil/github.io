# MCU Fan Pitches The Perfect Return For Phase 4 s Most Underrated Villain


## SUMMARY 



  An MCU fan suggests that Gorr the God Butcher should return in What If...? season 3 to go after Moon Knight and Khonshu, which would allow Gorr to finally kill gods onscreen.   This scenario is a great fit for What If...? because it offers an alternate storyline and addresses previous MCU criticisms.   Gorr&#39;s potential appearances in What If...? season 3 could include battles with characters like Hela, Loki, Dormammu, and Ego, offering a range of exciting possibilities.

## Literature Review
Christian Bale&#39;s Gorr the God Butcher was the most underrated villain from the MCU&#39;s Phase 4, and his perfect return has been pitched by a Marvel fan.




Gorr the God Butcher has his perfect return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in What If...? pitched by a fan. Christian Bale&#39;s performance as Gorr the God Butcher was easily the best part of the tonal nightmare that was Thor: Love and Thunder, which was a major disappointment after the previous Thor film was easily one of the MCU&#39;s best movies. Gorr died in the latest Thor movie after most of his &#34;God Butchering&#34; had been done off-screen, which wasted a lot of the villain&#39;s potential.




On Twitter, an MCU fan has the perfect answer to how Marvel Studios could bring back Gorr the God Butcher.


 

@captaincupkicks proposes that the animated What If...? season 3 should bring back Gorr for an exciting scenario: the villain tries to kill Moon Knight and the god Khonshu. The idea would be perfect, as it would allow Gorr to finally kill gods onscreen, also building off of the success of Disney&#43;&#39;s Moon Knight.

                  Every What If Season 2 Episode Ranked Worst To Best   All 9 episodes of the second season of What If…? are available to stream, so it’s time to rank just how well it tackles each multiversal scenario.    


 Why Gorr&#39;s MCU Return Is So Perfect For What If...? 
          




Gorr coming back in What If...? season 3 to go after Moon Knight and Khonshu is a great story for the series because it is an actual alternate scenario. The animated series got a lot of flack during season 2 due to some of its stories feeling lackluster. Gorr returning to fight a god that he never went after in Thor: Love and Thunder is a plausible and exciting scenario for What If...?

That possible story would tackle both What If...?&#39;s biggest criticism and what the MCU did wrong with Bale&#39;s Gorr in the latest Thor movie. Not only would Gorr trying to kill Moon Knight and Khonshu fit the alternate scenarios of the animated series, but it would also allow the MCU to finally show Gorr going after gods. While Bale&#39;s performance as Gorr was perfect, Thor: Love and Thunder never showing Gorr killing gods after the character&#39;s first kill was a bad choice.

While Gorr crossing over into the world of Moon Knight would be exciting, Bale&#39;s MCU villain could have many other possible appearances in What If...? season 3. Cate Blanchett&#39;s Hela had quite a few appearances in What If...? season 2, and Gorr taking on the character could lead to an epic animated battle. Bale&#39;s villain could also trade blows with a Loki variant, Dormammu, Ego, and more powerful beings, making for a plethora of exciting possibilities for Gorr the God Butcher to appear in What If...? season 3.






All episodes of Marvel&#39;s What If...? season 2 are now available on Disney&#43;, and a What If...? season 3 teaser has been released.
