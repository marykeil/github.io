## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Kelly Brown is living his best life as a single man since his shocking split from Molly Hopkins on 90 Day: The Last Resort.




Kelly Brown from 90 Day: The Last Resort looks happier than ever since his split from Molly Hopkins and is back to enjoying his single life. Kelly is a former New York police officer who fans know from 90 Day: The Single Life season 1. Kelly and Molly began talking to each other on DMs, and they soon made plans for a future together in the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Molly was married to Luis Mendez from the Dominican Republic in 90DF season 5. The marriage was short-lived as Molly realized Luis was only after a Green Card and never respected her or her daughters.




Kelly, on the other hand, saw himself fitting right in Molly’s little world. He moved to Georgia after his retirement to spend more time with Molly, but that’s where the troubles began. Molly and Kelly split around Thanksgiving 2022. They were no longer together when they arrived at the Florida Keys resort to seek couple’s therapy. Molly realized she didn’t have any love left for Kelly. Because of this, they made no progress and fought a lot at the resort. Molly and Kelly left the show early. There are rumors of Molly dating a new man while Kelly is living his best life, as per his Instagram.
