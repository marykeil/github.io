  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Black Sails offered insight into the lives of many pirates in history. One pirate often referenced across the show was Captain Henry Avery.</p>
<p>Since it debuted on Starz in 2014, the pirate adventure series Black Sails has received high praise for its portrayal of the Golden Age of Piracy. Set in the 18th century, Black Sails serves as a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s popular novel Treasure Island and follows a young Captain Flint (Toby Stephens) and his crew members, as they fight for the survival of New Providence Island. The series later focused on the war for control over the New Providence between the pirates and the British Embassy.
Throughout Black Sails, the adventures of many different real pirates, such as Jack Rackham, Anne Bonny, and Long John Silver were examined, and the show offered insight into the brutalities of the life of a pirate. One famous pirate who was often referenced throughout the show was Captain Henry Avery; his adventures and successes as a pirate served as assistance for the characters in Black Sails and offered inspiration for their expeditions.

<p>Black Sails: How Each Character Is Supposed To Look
Some of the characters featured on Black Sails may be based on historical figures, but exactly how historically accurate are these portrayals?</p>
<p>Captain Henry Avery&rsquo;s Role In Black Sails Explained</p>
<p>Despite never physically appearing in Black Sails, Captain Henry Avery was referenced several times throughout the show. Some characters, such as Jack Rackham, spoke about Avery with admiration, admitting that he would love to be admired and respected on the same level as Captain Henry Avery. Others, such as Thomas Hamilton, spoke of Avery angrily, blaming him for causing trouble in the relationships between pirates and governments. In season 2, episode 9, Avery was blamed for the destruction of Nassau by Hamilton; he claimed that in the late 1690s, when he and his crew arrived at the island, Avery bribed Nassau Governor, Nicholas Trott, to ignore any wrongdoing before setting up camp on the beach, causing havoc, and beginning the pirate presence on the island. Eventually, Richard Guthrie arrived on the island, and he began fencing the stolen cargo of the pirates.
Captain Avery&rsquo;s expeditions were referenced the most strongly in season 4. In Black Sails, Captain Avery was also said to be the first Englishman to find Skeleton Island, a place strongly referenced in Stevenson&rsquo;s Treasure Island; in season 4, episode 8, Flint recalls the tale of how Skeleton Island was allegedly used by the Spanish for illegal transactions; while on the island, Captain Avery&rsquo;s crew found a Spanish ship with all 31 crew members slaughtered. As Skeleton Island was not featured on any recorded charts or maps, Avery recorded how to travel to the island in his journal. In season 4, episode 8, it was revealed that Flint gave Captain Avery&rsquo;s journal to Quartermaster Hal Gates; Woodes Rogers eventually recovered the journal, and he used it to travel with the crew to Skeleton Island. Throughout season 4, episode 8, it is hinted that the expedition to Skeleton Island will change the crew, similarly to how it changed Captain Avery.</p>
<p>Captain Avery&rsquo;s Aliases &amp; Other Names (Including Henry Every)</p>
<p>Like many pirates who were involved in the Golden Age of Piracy, there are very few accurate details about the early years of Captain Henry Avery. It is known that Captain Avery lived under various names and aliases. Still, historians have accepted that the captain&rsquo;s real birth name was Henry Every, as he used this name when he was registered in the Royal Navy during the 1690s. He sometimes spelled his name as Henry Avery; there was initial belief that he used the alias John Avery, but this has been disputed. As the captain of the Fancy, his crew gave him the nickname Long Ben due to his rank and large size, and after his successful raid on Ganij-i-Sawai, he was nicknamed &lsquo;The Arch Pirate&rsquo; (via World History).
Captain Avery used different aliases to avoid being caught because of his growing reputation as a wanted man. One alias that he is known to have used was Benjamin Bridgeman. During his life, however, Avery&rsquo;s most notable name given to him was the King of the Pirates, thanks to his controversial and successful raids and being one of only a few pirates that escaped capture and death.</p>
<p>Where Black Sails Is Filmed: All Locations Made To Look Like The Caribbean
Black Sails is a pirate series that ran for four seasons and here are the locations where it was shot, which were made to look like the Caribbean.</p>
<p>How Captain Avery Became One Of The Most Successful Pirates In History</p>
<p>Captain Avery&rsquo;s immense success as a pirate may have inspired the likes of Blackbeard and Long John Silver to take up the profession. He was a pirate for only two years, but in that short time, he was able to claim more treasure than the likes of Anne Bonny, Blackbeard, and Jack Rackham combined (via ThoughtCo). After serving in the Royal Navy, Avery served as the first mate aboard the Charles II, but the crew failed to receive their wages and eventually mutinied; Avery was elected as the new captain of the ship, which he renamed Fancy, and he and his crew plundered five ships off the West African Coast while sailing into the Indian Ocean.
On September 6, 1695, Avery committed his most infamous raid in history, when he and his crew ambushed a 25-ship Grand Mughal convoy. Captain Avery teamed up with several other pirate ships to commit the raid, and they were able to invade an escort vessel named the Fath Mahmamadi; the following day, the crew captured the Ganj-i-Sawai after an intense standoff (via History). The crew was able to claim up to £600,000 worth of valuables, which was worth millions of dollars in today&rsquo;s money; this raid established Avery as the richest pirate in the world, but, his successful raid also made him a wanted man as it essentially destroyed the peaceful relations between the British Privy Council and the East India Company.</p>
<p>What Happened To Captain Henry Avery After His Pirate Career</p>
<p>Many theories have risen as to what happened to Captain Henry Avery after his career as a pirate ended. 24 members of his crew were eventually captured and 6 were arrested and hanged for their crimes. However, Captain Avery himself, evaded capture and disappeared from the public records after 1696.
It&rsquo;s unclear what happened to Captain Henry Avery after 1696, as no trace of him, or his treasures, was ever found. Historians have shared their theories as to what Avery&rsquo;s fate could have been, ranging from that he was cheated or squandered his riches and died in poverty, to that he changed his name again and lived out the rest of his life in obscurity and peace in Britain or a secluded island (via All That&rsquo;s Interesting). Captain Henry Avery is the only pirate ever to evade capture in history successfully. His true fate may never be known, but his life and legacy were well respected and admired throughout Black Sails.
