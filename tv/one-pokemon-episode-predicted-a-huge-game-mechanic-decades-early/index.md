# One Pokemon Episode Predicted a Huge Game Mechanic Decades Early


## SUMMARY 



  The first season of the Pokémon anime introduced giant Pokémon, setting a precedent for the Gigantamax mechanic.   Pokémon: Sword and Pokémon: Shield introduced the Gigantamax mechanic in 2019, but giant Pokémon existed in the franchise before that.   Team Rocket&#39;s short-lived theme park featuring giant Pokémon could have been a successful business venture if the animatronics weren&#39;t easily destroyed.

## Literature Review
An episode from Pokemon: Indigo League, the very first season, set a precedent for one major game mechanic long before it was developed in-game.




The first season of the hit Pokémon anime provided the first glimpse of a mechanic that would be introduced over twenty years later in the game. Gigantamax may be a more recent addition, but giant Pokémon were already present early in Pokémon: Indigo League.




Pokémon season 1 episode #17 is titled &#34;Island of the Giant Pokémon.&#34; It concludes the story beginning in episode #15, &#34;Battle Aboard the St. Anne&#34; that continued in &#34;Pokémon Shipwreck.&#34; After the St. Anne is sunk with Ash and his friends aboard, they are left adrift with Team Rocket. Then, a Dragon Rage attack from a group of Gyarados separates the trainers from their Pokémon, leaving them stranded on a mysterious island.

          

This island would turn out to have giant inhabitants, as the episode&#39;s title suggests. While these turned out to be fake Pokémon, their size was impressive and set a very early precedent for the Gigantamax phenomenon.

                  How   Pokémon&#39;s Ash Actually Got To Catching Them All   With Ash&#39;s era of the Pokémon anime over and done, just how many Pokémon did Ash have by the end, and was it even remotely close to catching them all?    





 Giant Pokémon Were Teased In The Anime Long Before Their In-Game Debut 
Pokémon: Season 1 Episode #17 &#34;Island of the Giant Pokémon&#34; - produced by OLM studio.
          

Pokémon: Sword and Pokémon: Shield introduced the Gigantamax mechanic to fans in 2019. At present, there are a limited number of species capable of achieving a Gigantamax form. These Pokémon increase greatly in size and gain power-ups when activated. It is a higher form of Dynamax. The size of these enlarged species is incredible, as are the attack bonuses granted to them. However, Gigantamax forms weren&#39;t the first form of giant Pokémon in the franchise. That honor goes first to Dragonite in the season 1 episode &#34;Mystery at the Lighthouse,&#34; but was explored further in &#34;Island of the Giant Pokémon.&#34;

Ash&#39;s Pikachu, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and Charmander are stranded on the island with Team Rocket&#39;s Meowth. As both parties try to locate their friends, they find themselves chased by very large Pokémon, which turn out to be robots. These massive animatronics are actually part of a theme park owned by Giovanni, the leader of Team Rocket. This money-grabbing ploy wasn&#39;t actually a bad idea, even if it was short-lived where the anime is concerned. Gigantamax as an official mechanic was introduced in the anime in Pokémon Journeys: The Series episode #5, &#34;Mind-Boggling Dynamax!&#34; which was released in Japan in 2019 and in the U.S. in 2020. It&#39;s frequently said that the world of Pokémon is ever-evolving, so it makes sense that people in the Kanto region wouldn&#39;t be aware of Gigantamax first-hand.






 Team Rocket Finally Had a Great Idea That Was Never Fully Realized 
          

Giovanni&#39;s seemingly short-lived theme park could have been one of his best entrepreneurial efforts when looked back on. Providing giant Pokémon for public viewing not only shows large marvels while highlighting an impressive occurrence from another region. Bringing Gigantamax to Kanto - even in a touristic manner - could&#39;ve provided the criminal organization&#39;s leader with financial success had the animatronics not been destroyed so easily. Nonetheless, these giant Pokémon debuted decades ahead of the official introduction of Gigantamax and revealed the potential the phenomenon could have in the Kanto region. 

Pokémon Episode 17 &#34;Island of the Giant Pokémon&#34; is available on Netflix.
