## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean&#39;s Kyle Viljoen &amp; Natalya Scudder may have clashed during their time on the Mustique, but things seem to be better than ever.




Below Deck Mediterranean may not be the most dramatic series in the Below Deck franchise, but the feud between Natalya Scudder and Kyle Viljoen has been a sticking point, which is why many are shocked to know that it seems the pair have managed to make up. Known for feuds between crew mates, Below Deck Mediterranean was the original spin-off of Bravo&#39;s popular Below Deck. Inviting audiences into the lives of a crew chartering a yacht through the Mediterranean, the series has introduced the franchise to unforgettable crew members, including Kyle and Natalya. Though the pair have spent Below Deck Med season 8 fighting, things may have finally been resolved.




In a recent post from Kyle&#39;s Instagram, he confirmed that &#34;time heals most wounds&#34; but he and Natalya are &#34;just glad to being back as friends again.&#34; The Below Deck Med season 8 stas shared a series of photos featuring the two of them together, explaining that while things have been difficult between himself and Natalya, their friendship has been repaired after the drama.


 

In the long caption, Kyle shared what brought him and Natalya back together, explaining, &#34;We both realized we were going through the thick of it at the time the season started a year ago, especially within our personal lives but were so glad that we have each other to rely on, now more than ever. We’re happy to be back together and hopeful that the positive, crazy and outrageously great times are ahead.&#34; 





 Kyle Viljoen &amp; Natalya Scudder’s Friendship Explained 
          

While Kyle and Natalya&#39;s friendship may be better than ever, things were rocky for quite some time after Below Deck Mediterranean season 8. Before the season, Natalya and Kyle were excited about joining another season of Below Deck Med together. The pair had been friends for years and enjoyed working together, even if their friendship had already been full of ups and downs. Early in the season on Below Deck Med, Natalya was even pushing to share a bunk with Kyle so they&#39;d be able to have a familiar face throughout their time on the Mustique. Natalya implied that she was hoping to lean on Kyle during the charter season.


 




Unfortunately, Natalya was disappointed in how Kyle acted towards her, joking about her personal life in a way she didn&#39;t appreciate. She quickly felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to depend on Kyle as a support on the charter, and noticed he was siding with other crew members over her on issues she assumed they&#39;d agree on. After Below Deck Med season 8 finished filming, the pair stopped following each other on social media and even got in a spat during a BravoCon panel in front of an audience. Their fight has run its course, though Kyle and Natalya haven&#39;t shared details about their reunion.

With Kyle and Natalya back in each other&#39;s good graces, the duo may be a given for another season of Below Deck Mediterranean. Though they had trouble when they were working together, having worked through their differences and seemingly come to an impasse, they may be better suited to communicate through their issues now. While Kyle and Natalya have chosen not to talk publicly about their reconciliation yet, it&#39;s possible the Below Deck Mediterranean stars could do so in the future, shedding more light into what helped mend their friendship.
