<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>After an intense and eventful season 2 finale, the possibilities for what could (and should) happen in The Bear&rsquo;s upcoming season 3 are endless.</p>
<p>This article contains mention of suicide.</p>
<p>The Bear season 3 is in the works, and after a stressful whirlwind of a season 2 finale, there are a ton of things that need to happen in this upcoming season. The Bear season 2 shifts gears a bit from season 1, with Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) taking over his late brother&rsquo;s sandwich shop, The Original Beef of Chicagoland. He also tried to make improvements to the kitchen and establishment as a whole.
The Bear season 2 focuses on Carmy and co.&rsquo;s preparations to reopen The Beef as a fine-dining restaurant called The Bear, with whole episodes dedicated to individual characters honing their skills ahead of the grand opening. The Bear has been renewed for season 3, which is slated for release sometime in 2024. The Bear season 2 finale was rather eventful and left plenty to be explored in season 3. Hopefully, new and returning guest stars, flashbacks to specific events, and answers to lingering mysteries will all be featured in The Bear season 3.</p>
<p>10 Burning Questions The Bear Season 3 Needs To Answer
The Bear season 3 will hopefully provide answers to season 2&rsquo;s lingering questions, while keeping audiences engaged in its captivating world.</p>
<p>10  Carmy Apologizing To Claire
The couple did not leave season 2 on good terms</p>
<p>In The Bear season 2, Carmy starts dating Claire, an old friend from childhood who showed up again out of the blue. Though he likes Claire, Carmy has a hard time accepting that someone could feel that way about him because he doesn&rsquo;t seem to think he deserves happiness. Carmy and Claire start spending more and more time together throughout The Bear season 2, causing him to neglect his restaurant duties.
At the end of The Bear season 2, Carmy accidentally locks himself in the walk-in freezer onthe opening night of The Bear. When Tina asks if he&rsquo;s okay, Carmy starts unloading about how he can&rsquo;t be in a relationship because he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;psycho,&rdquo; which is why he is so good at being a chef. He continues venting about how love and relationships are just a waste of time, not realizing that Claire has been listening. While Carmy and Claire&rsquo;s relationship doesn&rsquo;t need to continue, Carmy at least owes Claire an apology for what he said, even though he didn&rsquo;t mean for her to hear it.</p>
<p>9  Natalie Having Her Baby
Natalie was still pregnant by the end of season 2</p>
<p>In The Bear season 2, Natalie reveals that she&rsquo;s pregnant with her first child with her husband, Pete. By the end of the season, Natalie is still pregnant and, barring any complications, will be giving birth in the coming months. Depending on whether the new season opens with a time jump, Natalie may or may not have had her baby yet by the time The Bear season 3 begins. Hopefully, the rest of Natalie&rsquo;s pregnancy journey and the birth of her child won&rsquo;t be skipped over in season 3.</p>
<p>8  Donna Dining At The Bear
Donna never made it inside the restaurant</p>
<p>Viewers finally got to meet the Berzatto matriarch, Donna, in The Bear season 2, and she sure did make an impression. Donna makes her first appearance in season 2, episode 6, &ldquo;Fishes,&rdquo; which chronicles the events of a Christmas dinner years earlier when Mikey was still alive. As Donna cooks Christmas dinner for everybody, she is visibly overwhelmed by the task and feels underappreciated for all her hard work. Donna eventually snaps at the dinner table, screaming at everybody before storming off in a heated rage. Not long after, she crashes her car through the living room wall.
Donna makes another appearance in the present day when she shows up at The Bear&rsquo;s opening night. Pete spots her outside and invites her in, but Donna refuses to enter the restaurant. She tells Pete that she doesn&rsquo;t know how to apologize to nor express her love for her children and insists that she doesn&rsquo;t deserve to witness their shared success. After a devastating exchange with Pete, Donna leaves without going inside, and Pete never mentions it to Natalie. Hopefully, in The Bear season 3, Donna will work up the nerve to finally visit The Bear and bask in Carmy and Natalie&rsquo;s success, and the Berzatto family can make amends.</p>
<p>7  Richie &amp; Eva Attending The Taylor Swift Concert
Richie still got tickets for his daughter in season 2</p>
<p>In The Bear season 2, Richie manages to secure tickets to a Taylor Swift concert for his superfan daughter, Eva. He invites Eva&rsquo;s mom and his ex-wife, Tiffany, to come along with them since he got three tickets. Tiffany deflects the offer by telling him she&rsquo;s engaged to her boyfriend, Frank, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that she&rsquo;ll be joining them at the concert.
The Bear wouldn&rsquo;t be able to show Richie and Eva attending an actual Taylor Swift concert, but the events leading up to the night could still be depicted in season 3. Circling back to Richie&rsquo;s Taylor Swift motif in The Bearseason 3 would be a great callback and an opportunity to show Richie bonding more with Eva. Plus, if Tiffany doesn&rsquo;t go, he still has an extra ticket, and maybe he&rsquo;ll bring Carmy for a much-needed night out. Carmy doesn&rsquo;t seem like the type to enjoy a Taylor Swift concert (or anything fun, really), which would make the whole thing that much more hysterical.</p>
<p>6  The Events Leading Up To &amp; Surrounding Mikey&rsquo;s Death
Season 3 could include a flashback to Mikey&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s revealed in the pilot episode of The Bear that Carmy&rsquo;s older brother, Mikey, took his own life several months earlier. Despite never wanting Carmy to work at The Beef with him, Mikey left the restaurant to his little brother, setting off the events of the whole series. Mikey appears in flashbacks in both seasons of The Bear, where he is shown to be charismatic and outgoing while also fighting demons inside.
According to the rough timeline of The Bear, Mikey died around February 2022. Prior to this death, Mikey struggled with addiction, and his suicide indicates he was suffering from depression and possibly other mental health issues like his mother. It is known that Carmy didn&rsquo;t return to Chicago for any kind of funeral service in the wake of Mikey&rsquo;s death. However, the actual events leading up to and surrounding Mikey&rsquo;s death in The Bear have not been depicted onscreen. The Bear season 3 could be an opportunity to show some of the build-up to and direct aftermath of Mikey&rsquo;s death and the funeral itself in more flashback sequences.</p>
<p>5  Carmy&rsquo;s Dad Making An Appearance
The Berzatto patriarch&rsquo;s whereabouts are unknown</p>
<p>Ever since his absence in the infamous Christmas flashback episode in season 2, Carmy&rsquo;s dad remains the biggest mystery in The Bear. It&rsquo;s unclear what happened to the Berzatto patriarch in The Bear, as no direct explanation has been given regarding his whereabouts. In season 1, Uncle Jimmy tells Carmy that he hasn&rsquo;t spoken to their dad in two decades, suggesting that he&rsquo;s still alive as far as they know and remains on bad terms with his family and old friends.
It&rsquo;s also revealed that he and Donna opened a restaurant together in the past, which ended up failing. As the baby of the family, Carmy doesn&rsquo;t seem to remember his father at all, implying that he left when Carmy was very young. Whether he finally pays his estranged family a visit in the present or appears in a flashback from before his departure, Carmy&rsquo;s dad making some sort of appearance in The Bear season 3 would answer a lot of lingering questions about the Berzatto family.</p>
<p>4  Flashbacks To Sydney&rsquo;s Past
Season 3 could show Sydney&rsquo;s life before The Bear</p>
<p>The Bear has incorporated many flashback sequences, but they mostly center around Carmy and the Berzatto family. Season 3 should include some flashbacks to Sydney&rsquo;s life before The Bear, like her studies at the Culinary Institute of America. She has already shared some details about her past, such as her mother&rsquo;s death and her failed catering business, but it would be great to see these events and periods of her life depicted onscreen. Flashbacks to her past would also allow The Bear to show Sydney properly interacting with people outside the restaurant staff besides her dad (although he should still appear in her flashbacks and season 3 in general).
Sydney also tells Carmy early on that she used to go to The Beef every Sunday with her dad when she was a kid. A flashback to the two of them eating there while Mikey was still alive is long overdue. It would also be a fun callback if viewers got a glimpse of Sydney&rsquo;s time working at UPS, which was listed as a former job on her resume that Carmy reads aloud in the pilot episode of The Bear.</p>
<p>3  Marcus Adjusting After His Mom&rsquo;s Medical Emergency
Marcus&rsquo; terminally ill mother may have died in the season 2 finale</p>
<p>The opening scene of The Bear season 2 shows that Marcus&rsquo; mom is sick with an unknown terminal illness. He later reveals that she was only given a few years to live and has already survived longer than expected. Marcus never identifies her condition, but she remains in a comatose state in end-of-life care.
In the season 2 finale, Marcus drops his phone on the floor in the commotion of opening night and misses a bunch of calls and texts from his mom&rsquo;s nurse. The fate of Marcus&rsquo; mother is left as a cliffhanger, though it&rsquo;s likely that she succumbed to her illness and passed away. If that is the case, Marcus&rsquo; storyline in The Bear season 3 can focus on him grieving the loss of his mother and bonding with Sydney over their shared experience while still meeting the demands of his stressful job at The Bear.</p>
<p>2  Business Booming At The Bear Restaurant
The revamped restaurant is officially open for business</p>
<p>After months of renovating the space and planning for its revival, the opening night of The Bear finally arrives in the season 2 finale with a friends and family event. While there are a few setbacks, like Carmy locking himself in the freezer, for instance, everything goes pretty smoothly. Hopefully, the success of opening night is a sign that the business will be thriving in The Bear season 3. However, as discussed in season 2, it&rsquo;s rare for a new restaurant to succeed in the long run, even if it&rsquo;s popular and well-liked. The restaurant&rsquo;s future is unpredictable, but as long as they stay in business, The Bear shall live on.</p>
<p>1  More Exciting Guest Stars &amp; Past Guest Stars Returning
A ton of famous actors made surprise cameos in season 2</p>
<p>The Bear season 2 features a ton of great actors making unexpected appearances. Jon Bernthal returns as the deceased Mikey Berzatto in flashback sequences, and Joel McHale appears in Carmy&rsquo;s memories again as his cruel former boss. In episode 4, &ldquo;Honeydew,&rdquo; Will Poulter stars as Luca, a pastry chef and Carmy&rsquo;s former co-worker who mentors Marcus during his culinary studies in Copenhagen. Olivia Colman also makes a brief appearance in episode 7, &ldquo;Forks,&rdquo; as a chef at the fancy dining establishment where Richie is apprenticing to prepare for the opening of The Bear.
The Bear season 2&rsquo;s Christmas episode, &ldquo;Fishes,&rdquo; features an ensemble of famous actors in surprise guest roles. These include Jamie Lee Curtis as Donna Berzatto, Bob Odenkirk as Uncle Lee, Sarah Paulson as Cousin Michelle, Gillian Jacobs as Richie&rsquo;s then-wife Tiffany, and John Mulaney as Michelle&rsquo;s partner Steven. Here&rsquo;s hoping these actors will reprise their roles and that even more exciting guest stars will appear in The Bearseason 3.
