## Literature Review
Golden Bachelor&#39;s Faith Martin is one of the women who will likely be considered as The Golden Bachelorette. Now she opens up about the opportunity.




The Golden Bachelor contestant and fan-favorite Faith Martin is a frontrunner to be the first-ever star of The Golden Bachelorette, but does she want to take on the lead role? Faith, a 61-year-old local radio host and high school teacher from Benton City, Washington, captivated The Golden Bachelor season 1 lead Gerry Turner, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, on night one. Gerry gave her his first impression rose, and their relationship grew until their beautiful hometown date. However, Gerry eliminated Faith at the next rose ceremony, choosing Theresa Nist and Leslie Fhima as his final two women.




In an interview with NonStop Local, Faith revealed she&#39;d be open to being the leading lady of The Golden Bachelorette if ABC decides to go ahead with the spin-off. She smiled as she said, &#34;One never knows, but, of course, I would say yes because who wouldn&#39;t? I mean, come on.&#34; Faith would certainly create a lot of excitement within Bachelor Nation if she accepted the role. She stole everyone&#39;s heart from night one when she arrived at the Bachelor mansion on a motorcycle and later sang to Gerry while playing the guitar.

 Faith Martin Was &#34;Shocked&#34; By Her Golden Bachelor Elimination 
          

Faith tearfully admitted that she felt validated when her fans told her that they were just as &#34;shocked&#34; as her when Gerry eliminated her from The Golden Bachelor. She confessed that she was &#34;so hurt&#34; because he seemed like a &#34;stranger&#34; when he walked her out. She felt a &#34;complete disconnect&#34; that was &#34;really painful&#34; for her. However, Faith reunited with Gerry at the &#34;Women Tell All&#34; special. She explained that she didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d feel, but &#34;instantly, when I saw him...all I wanted to do was wrap myself up in him and just love him anyway.&#34; Faith said that she understands and respects that Gerry had to &#34;make the best choice for him.&#34;





 

Faith and Gerry had a very strong connection. It was truly shocking when he didn&#39;t choose her after her hometown date. They exchanged &#34;I love you&#39;s&#34; in front of her family, and things seemed to be headed in the right direction for them. Their only obstacle was that Faith admitted she&#39;d be unwilling to move away from her hometown because she wanted to be close to her children. Faith really seemed like the frontrunner when the hometown dates were over.

Faith is such a genuine and interesting woman. She has many talents and would be very entertaining to watch. She stayed away from drama and instead focused all of her attention on her relationship with Gerry. Faith was very open to finding new love on The Golden Bachelor, and she deserves another chance to find happiness. It&#39;s wonderful to hear that she&#39;d be open to taking on a lead role if ABC greenlights the spin-off. Faith is very special, and she would be perfect for The Golden Bachelorette.




The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale airs Thursday, November 30 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
