Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Olivia Plath isn&#39;t staying quiet regarding the details of her tough marriage to Ethan Plath, along with their messy divorce.




Welcome To Plathville’s Olivia Plath may be moving on after her messy marriage to Ethan Plath, but she’s still sending shady messages on social media about their relationship and impending divorce. Ethan and Olivia’s marriage has been a point of issue on Welcome To Plathville season 5, as the couple’s been having difficulty connecting throughout the season. With Ethan’s family cutting off all communication with Olivia and only speaking to Ethan sparsely, things have been difficult for the eldest Plath son to handle as his marriage has deteriorated. After announcing their split in October 2023, Ethan and Olivia have been quiet on social media, though Olivia’s shared some shady posts.




In a recent Instagram story, Olivia shared what many believe to be shade against Ethan. While it’s unclear if Olivia wrote the post or simply shared it, the text reads, “I think one of the most profound forms of love is ‘I’ll try that, for you. I may not like it, but I’ll try it.’”

          

Olivia’s post outlined some of the ways this can look, then finished with a sweet summary. “It’s being willing to spend some of your time trying something new because it makes someone you love happy,” the text read. Olivia may have just been sharing a sweet sentiment, but the shade wasn’t lost on Welcome To Plathville fans, who knew Ethan’s lack of effort was a huge issue for Olivia.

 Olivia &amp; Ethan Plath’s Welcome To Plathville Relationship Explained 
          

Olivia and Ethan’s relationship was difficult. One of the major things that wedged between them once his family’s support was gone was the fact that Ethan was set in his ways. Rather than trying things with Olivia, he chose to continue down the same path of fixing classic cars and continuing to do what he’d always done. Rather than putting in the effort to grow and change with his wife, the way Olivia’s post shared, Ethan put in the time to maintain his hobbies and interests, instead. While Olivia isn’t entirely blameless in the couples’ demise, it’s clear that she was looking for effort that Ethan wasn’t willing to give.


 




After getting married early in 2018, Ethan and Olivia believed they were ready to take on a serious relationship. Both being raised in fundamentalist families, the pair were hoping to continue to share values as they grew older and built a family together. While Olivia changed and grew from who she was at just 20 years old in the ensuing years, it appears that Ethan hasn’t had much growth outside of who he was when he married Olivia. The couple has been dealing with navigating their incredibly different views, and ultimately chose to separate rather than try to reconcile their beliefs.

With Ethan and Olivia’s relationship over, it’s clear that both are moving on in their own ways. While Ethan has been relatively quiet on social media outside of a post announcing his split from Olivia, his soon-to-be ex-wife has been sharing her life a bit more than before. Olivia’s cryptic posts, whether they be shade or simply what she’s looking for in her next romantic relationship, are interesting to fans. Welcome To Plathville viewers are looking for any hint that Olivia may be moving forward from a tough time.
