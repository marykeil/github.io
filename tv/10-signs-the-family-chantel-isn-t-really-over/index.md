## Literature Review
The Family Chantel seems to have reached its conclusion with Pedro and Chantel&#39;s divorce. However, there are signs the series isn&#39;t necessarily over. 




Although The Family Chantel seems to have reached its climax with Pedro Jimeno and Chantel Everett&#39;s divorce, that might not be true. After their appearance on 90 Day Fiancé, Chantel and Pedro became the first couple to earn a spin-off that focused on the progress of their love story. Since The Family Chantel premiered in 2019, fans have watched the dramatic turn of Pedro and Chantel&#39;s romance, with regular input from their families.
The relationship dynamics and countless heated moments between the cast members made The Family Chantel famous within the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. However, after four seasons of watching Chantel and Pedro go from being lovebirds to embittered couples, The Family Chantel season 5, which premiered on November 6, 2023, delved into Chantel and Pedro&#39;s divorce. Although The Family Chantel has been one of the most-watched TLC reality series, season 5 may be the last due to Chantel and Pedro&#39;s divorce. Still, there are several reasons and storylines the show could still explore that might get the show renewed.

 10  The Family Chantel&#39;s Pedro&#39;s New Life Might Interest Viewers 
Pedro&#39;s new romance and job might become a primary storyline
        

Since the divorce, Pedro has surprisingly opted to date his ex-wife lookalike Shelly. Pedro&#39;s decision to date Shelley has raised a couple of eyebrows, and fans might be interested in what the future holds for the pair. Meanwhile, Pedro&#39;s contentious relationship with Scott Wern, who surprisingly opted to start dating his mom, Lidia, again, was one of the highlights of The Family Chantel season 5. Pedro and his sister Nicole are not big fans of Scott, and the future of their relationship will also make for a great storyline.





 9  Chantel Everett&#39;s Dating Life After Divorce Could Also Be Showcased 
Chantel&#39;s romantic life will always interest fans


 







Chantel&#39;s search for love and dedication towards her marriage has made The Family Chantel one of the most popular reality TV series over the years. Although her marriage to Pedro ultimately crashed, Chantel is still very well-loved by The Family Chantel fans. Chantel&#39;s life off the show is also closely followed by fans, and she was often in the news when new seasons of The Family Chantel weren&#39;t even airing. Chantel&#39;s popularity shows that fans will be interested in any story involving her, and any series focused on Chantel&#39;s quest for love will surely gain traction again.





 8  Nicole Jimeno&#39;s Journey Is Also Interesting 
Nicole&#39;s controversial personality might make for a good storyline
        

Since her debut on The Family Chantel, Nicole Jimeno has become arguably the least-liked cast member on the show. Pedro&#39;s controversial younger sister has been involved in some of the pivotal moments in The Family Chantel&#39;s history, and Nicole&#39;s feud with Chantel has lasted for the entirety of the show. Still, controversy also makes for good TV, and Nicole has provided several dramatic moments on The Family Chantel. However, due to being a supporting cast member, only a few stories have been exhaustively told about Nicole. Nonetheless, that could change if The Family Chantel returns, where Nicole, who also has a big following, could play a more significant role.





 7  Winter Everett&#39;s Fitness Journey Could Be A Central Plotline 
Winter&#39;s inspiring weight loss journey might take precedence
        

Winter Everett made her The Family Chantel debut as Chantel&#39;s little sister; however, her toxic long-term relationship with a man named Jah made fans take note of her on the show. Winter&#39;s inspirational, honest, and open personality quickly made her a fan favorite on the show. Since her relationship with Jah ended, Winter has embraced her weight-loss quest, having struggled with her body image for a long time. After undergoing weight-loss surgery and dropping from size 24 to size 14, Winter has become even more confident and outgoing, and the desire to tell her story might inspire another season of The Family Chantel.





 6  Viewers Might Miss Lidia Morel Playing The Villain 
Lidia’s entertaining villain arc might get her the central character role


Lidia is the unchallenged villain and the least-liked cast member in The Family Chantel. After her debut on the show, Lidia was the most vocal opponent of her son Pedro&#39;s marriage to Chantel. While Lidia&#39;s several fights with Chantel and harsh rebukes and comments often left a bad taste in fans&#39; mouths, her scenes were still unmissable. Like all villains, Lidia&#39;s role has been pivotal to the success of The Family Chantel. Despite not being the most-liked, fans still fondly remember some of her toxic antics. The Family Chantel fans love to hate Lidia, and the quest to see her grace the screens again might spur another season.





 5  Pedro &amp; Chantel Everett Could Reconcile 
Pedro and Chantel&#39;s love story might not be over


 







Pedro and Chantel&#39;s eventual divorce in 2022 ended their tumultuous marriage. Although the pair were happy at the beginning of their relationship, most of their time together was full of arguments, family disagreements, and cheating allegations. The aftermath of their divorce also featured countless accusations and resentments, which made their divorce settlement even more difficult. While the two got what they wanted with the divorce, a reconciliation might still be on the cards. Chantel isn&#39;t dating anyone yet, and Pedro&#39;s decision to date his ex-wife&#39;s lookalike shows he might not be genuinely over Chantel. Although any chance of reconciliation looks impossible, there might still be a slight chance for Chantel and Pedro to be together again, making way for another season of The Family Chantel.





 4  Riverknight Everett Could Grab More Screen Time 
RiverKnight&#39;s music career and personal life might get more focus


Riverknight Everett debuted as Chantel&#39;s youngest brother in The Family Chantel. Initially skeptical about Pedro&#39;s intentions, River would later become Pedro&#39;s friend on the show. Despite his limited appearance on the show, River&#39;s storyline revolved around more than just his impact and input on Chantel and Pedro&#39;s relationship. The show also touched on River&#39;s music career, romantic relationships, and his relationship with his parents. Nonetheless, a deeper dive into River&#39;s storylines would fit perfectly into a revamped The Family Chantel series.





 3  Karen &amp; Thomas Everett Are Popular 
Chantel&#39;s Parents might become central characters
        

Chantel&#39;s parents, Karen and Thomas Everett became popular on the show when they sat down and grilled Pedro about his intentions towards their daughter. Despite their reservations, Karen and Thomas supported their daughter. The duo is also trendy within The Family Chantel fan base and has earned enormous praise for how they raised Chantel and her siblings, who are all fan favorites. A storyline solely focused on Karen and Thomas and their kids would fit perfectly into any potential future seasons of The Family Chantel.





 2  Viewers Might Want To Hear More About Pedro 
Fans will love to see more of Pedro 
        

Despite Chantel&#39;s best efforts to save their marriage, it was evident Pedro wanted out of the union. His intentions had been questioned even before the pair married, and Pedro did nothing to dispel those beliefs throughout their marriage. Still, Pedro&#39;s antics brought entertainment to the show, and despite Chantel and Karen&#39;s attempts to get him deported, Pedro looks settled in the US with his job and a new girlfriend. Although he is not a popular figure within the fanbase, The Family Chantel fans might still want to keep tabs on his new life.





 1  The Family Chantel Is A Cash Cow (The Cast May Want More Income) 
The Cast won&#39;t say no to additional income
        

Even though most of The Family Chantel cast members have other careers besides being reality TV stars, the show provides a guaranteed additional source of income for most. According to InTouch, The Family Chantel cast members get paid more than $1000 per episode, and the prospect of this stream of income stopping might spur the cast to commit to another season. Although there have been five seasons of The Family Chantel, there are still many more stories to tell, and hopefully, the show will return for another season.
