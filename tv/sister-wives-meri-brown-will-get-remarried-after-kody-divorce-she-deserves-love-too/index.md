## Literature Review
Although she is still working to separate herself from Kody Brown, Sister Wives&#39; Meri Brown will likely remarry after her divorce. Here&#39;s why.




Sister Wives&#39; Meri Brown is likely to remarry after she finally separates herself from patriarch Kody Brown, and here&#39;s why. Meri was notably the first of the Brown sister wives to marry Kody, though she legally divorced Kody for him to marry Robyn years later. While Christine Brown has been the most vocal against her ex-husband, Kody&#39;s mistreatment of Meri caused her to leave her husband of 30 years in 2022. Arguably, Kody and Meri&#39;s relationship was never made to last, with both parties asserting they had been more like friends than partners for years.




Meri seems poised to be the next ex-wife to find someone new, as she showed up at Sister Wives: One-On-One looking fabulous. She has a new hairstyle and has lost weight. However, these reasons alone don&#39;t indicate a new relationship on the horizon; simply a newfound love for herself after leaving the controlling and disrespectful patriarch. Is it possible a romance may be in the cards for the scorned former sister wife?


 Christine Brown Paved The Way For Janelle And Meri 
          

Christine overcame the trauma from her marriage with Kody and found love with David Woolley. The pair wed earlier in 2023 and have been happy ever since. She was brave to exit her polygamous relationship with Kody and enter into a monogamous marriage with David, and she showed her former sister wives that happiness outside polygamy and the unit they created with Kody is possible. Though Meri previously fell for a catfish online, she doesn&#39;t seem to have dated since leaving Kody. However, she wants this to change.






 Meri Brown Wants To Find A New Husband 
          

According to comments made in the Sister Wives: One-On-One, Meri is eager to find a new man to share her life with. When asked during the episode if she wanted to get remarried, Meri responded, &#34;Yeah, I do! I hope to.&#34; According to People, Meri continued, &#34;I hope to find somebody who loves and accepts the person that I am, and cherishes me and knows my heart and likes it.&#34; She later noted she&#39;d like to find someone tall, giving Matthew McConaughey as her celebrity crush as an example.

While she&#39;s not currently seeing anyone, Meri deserves and wants to find love again after leaving Kody. Hopefully, she has learned from what she didn&#39;t like about her former husband and can find someone who loves and understands her for who she is. Kody treated Meri disrespectfully and without love, with the pair admitting they had a loveless marriage. Hopefully, the Sister Wives star can find her soulmate in another man.
