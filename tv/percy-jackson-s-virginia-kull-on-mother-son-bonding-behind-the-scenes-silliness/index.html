  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Virgina Kull, who plays Percy&rsquo;s mother Sally in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, discusses her time on the show, Walter Scobell, and Big Little Lies.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson and the Olympians wrapped up its first season this week, setting up a Kronos-centric storyline to be continued in future episodes should it be renewed. Since its release in late 2023, the series has received praise from critics and fans alike for its faithful portrayal of the Rick Riordan books and stellar performances. The show stars Walter Scobell as the titular hero and Leah Jeffries and Aryan Simhadri as his companions Annabeth and Grover alongside actors like Will and Grace&rsquo;s Megan Mullally, NOS4A2&rsquo;s Virgina Kull, and Lost in Space&rsquo;s Toby Stephens.</p>
<p>The first season of the show followed Percy and his friends on a quest to prove his innocence after he&rsquo;s blamed for the theft of Zeus&rsquo; master bolt, while also interspersing more backstory about the narrative&rsquo;s main characters through flashbacks. Though largely a faithful adaptation, there have still been many changes between the Percy Jackson show and the books, including giving more insight into Percy&rsquo;s mother, Sally (Kull). The series has further delved into the depths of the pair&rsquo;s relationship, how she prepared him for his life as a demigod, and her past with Poseidon (Stephens).</p>
<pre><code>              Who Really Stole Zeus’ Master Bolt In Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Season 1 &amp; The Lightning Thief Book   The trio's quest involves discovering who stole Zeus' master bolt, with Percy Jackson and the Olympians' book and season 1 finale giving the answers.

<p>Screen Rant recently interviewed Virginia Kull to discuss forming a mother-son bond onscreen, the most challenging parts of filming Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians, and her time with Big Little Lies.</p>
<p>Virginia Kull Talks Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians</p>
<p>Screen Rant: Your onscreen relationship with Percy is so special, and I&rsquo;d love to hear just a little bit about what it&rsquo;s been like working with Walker and building that onscreen mother-and-son bond with him.</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: It&rsquo;s been great fun. Walker has boundless energy. And he&rsquo;s my favorite kid. He&rsquo;s the kid that has the twinkle in his eye, where it looks like he&rsquo;s up to something. There&rsquo;s some mischief there. And you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Uh-oh.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s so fun. And it&rsquo;s kept me on my toes.
There&rsquo;s lots of silliness on set, particularly between him and Aryan. The scene, the car crash scene was I think over a week on a gimbal, which is some hydraulic lift. And in the Camaro, we&rsquo;re 15 feet in the air, I&rsquo;m popping Dramamine like they&rsquo;re Tic Tacs, and he and Aryan are just screaming like they&rsquo;re on the best roller coaster at Disneyland. And they&rsquo;re just silly, and fun, and creative. And he&rsquo;s got a crazy steel trap of a memory. He memorizes whole scenes from movies, and will just quote them in between takes.
We had a ball. His family was there for a lot of the time, and I adored getting to know them. In addition to being great fun, and silly, and playful, and fantastic, sharp sense of humor, he&rsquo;s also really malleable, and open to direction. He wants to learn, he wants to get better. And it&rsquo;s so exciting as an adult working with a child to say, &ldquo;Oh wow. Look at this young professional.&rdquo; He was total pro. It was really impressive.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome. And I feel like in the latest episode, the flashback scene that we had with Sally and Poseidon really helped give a little bit more insight into their relationship, as well as Sally&rsquo;s overall dedication to Percy. What was it like working with Toby Stephens on that?</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: I loved it. I&rsquo;d been a big fan of his for years. Because come on - he&rsquo;s Rochester from Jane Eyre. Anyone of my era has seen him in that, and he&rsquo;s extraordinary. So I was very excited to meet him. Also, he came highly recommended by Dan Shotz and Jon Steinberg, who assured me that I would delight in his company and partnership. And he did not disappoint; he was lovely.
Anders Angstrom, our director of that episode, was so creative. I don&rsquo;t know if the viewer can tell from the final edit of that scene, but the entire scene, we did not look at each other. I did not look at him once, which made - I remember my heart just pounding in my chest. I so badly wanted to turn to him, but I didn&rsquo;t.
And Anders said, &ldquo;What would it be if you never looked at one another?&rdquo; And I felt like my body was radiating with energy, because of the yearning to connect, the yearning to see, the yearning to look at his eyes. And I couldn&rsquo;t. And it just infused it with - it was really exciting, the energy, and the uncertainty of where we were going next, and how is he responding to what I&rsquo;m saying, and how is what I&rsquo;m saying making him feel? It was really fun to play.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what some of the most challenging scenes have been to film, either stunt-wise or emotionally speaking.</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: It&rsquo;s a hard question to answer. Because challenging scenes sometimes I feel like will make you think, &ldquo;Oh, she didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.&rdquo; But actors love the challenging scene; those are our favorite ones to do. The ones that ask a lot of you emotionally, or ask a lot of you from a power point of view, those are the thrilling ones, the ones when we get the next script, and see we&rsquo;ve got a doozy of a scene, we&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
The car wreck was challenging simply because I get very motion sick very quickly. And just logistically by the numbers, it was physically quite taxing, and quite uncomfortable. But the crew took great care of me. Aryan and Walker kept me laughing. And we made our way through. And I felt like a badass on the other side of it.
Also, looking back, I don&rsquo;t know if I would&rsquo;ve chosen the outfit for the pilot to be jeans. I was wearing jeans. And I thought, &ldquo;These are great. I feel great in them. They look great. I buy that she&rsquo;d wear these.&rdquo; And then I realized about five minutes into shooting the fire escape scene, communing with Poseidon in the rain, &ldquo;Oh no. I&rsquo;m going to be in wet jeans for the next three weeks.&rdquo; And I was. So it was dumb little innocuous things that were actually the most challenging, things like, &ldquo;Oh. I should have chosen a nice slack or trouser that dries a little faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny. I was. Actually, I was talking to Dior [Goodjohn] yesterday, and we were talking about -</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful in this?</p>
<p>She was amazing. And she was talking about how for the bathroom scene, she was wearing jeans as well, and then she was like, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m walking around in wet jeans all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: All day long, just bathroom breaks - think about it. Taking them off, putting them back on, getting your mic pack readjusted, it&rsquo;s just real uncomfortable.</p>
<p>And with only one episode left in this season, looking back, what have been your favorite moments so far in the show?</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: I do not like watching things that I&rsquo;m in. It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to do. The great thing about being a viewer of this show is that I&rsquo;m now a fan of the books, having come to them later in life. But I&rsquo;m a fan of the book, so I&rsquo;m invested in the story. And there&rsquo;s so much of this that Sally is not in, that I can fully release, and enjoy knowing, &ldquo;Oh no. I don&rsquo;t have to look at my face for the next 45 minutes.&rdquo; And I have loved it.
I just thought Jessica&rsquo;s work as Medusa was just so exciting, and surprising. And Aryan&rsquo;s work when he finds his uncle, I literally said as I was watching it in my living room, I said, &ldquo;Good for you bud. Good for you.&rdquo; I just was so proud of him. And I knew he could do it. And he did it tenfold. And I was so proud of him.
The scene where Walker prays to me, a mere mortal, in the pilot, and all of this stuff - I didn&rsquo;t get to see it, Deven. I wasn&rsquo;t a part of those scenes. So we were in the big theater at the Met for the premiere, and it was the first time I was seeing it. And I was watching Walker do that scene and just my heart swelled with love for Percy, with love for Walker, with pride for what I get to be a part of doing.
I&rsquo;m so excited for the Ares fight. I&rsquo;m so excited. I haven&rsquo;t seen the final episode. But I saw some behind the scenes of the stunt work making it happen. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be really, really amazing. I&rsquo;ve loved it all.
And we shot so much of this on the Volume stage, so when I was there on the day, I didn&rsquo;t know what anything was going to look like. So even watching episode seven and seeing the Underworld, and Hades&rsquo; palace, it&rsquo;s been such fun. It&rsquo;s like Christmas morning - you&rsquo;ve been looking forward to, &ldquo;What is it going to be? What&rsquo;s it going to be?&rdquo; And here it finally is, and I just think it looks great.</p>
<p>And you talked a little bit about getting into the books later in life, and becoming a fan of them. I&rsquo;m curious if there are any plot points from future books that you&rsquo;d be especially excited to get to in terms of the series to catch up with the books?</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: I&rsquo;m really excited about the Hades kiddos. Nico di Angelo, I&rsquo;m very excited about that storyline. I&rsquo;m excited to meet Thalia, I&rsquo;m really excited to meet her. And I&rsquo;m so pumped to see - Luke is our Severus Snape, our villain who becomes the hero, like the Darth Vader. I&rsquo;m so excited for the journey that the character and our actor is going to get to go on.
And just when I think about how I&rsquo;ve changed over the past 10 years, and thinking how this cast is going to grow up and become adults while doing this, and how it will impact their acting, and how it will impact their lives. And to get to see him in his final showdown, and the sacrifice that he eventually heroically makes, I think it&rsquo;s going to be really, really special, and really exciting.</p>
<p>And going back a few years, I also loved your performance on Big Little Lies. I&rsquo;m curious if you could talk a little bit about what your experience was like on that series. And also, it was just announced that there would be a season three, do you think there&rsquo;s any way that Emily could return in any capacity?</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: Jean-Marc Vallée was a genius. And I&rsquo;m very, very grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him, be directed by him, to speak David E. Kelley&rsquo;s words. I just finished a miniseries for Apple that David is writing, that will be coming out soon. And this was my third David Kelley project. And I just love working for him. Jean-Marc was dream. To get to be dressed as Audrey Hepburn next to all of those fabulous ladies was so exciting
.
The entire supporting cast, all of the fellow school parents, we&rsquo;ve all remained incredibly close. We have a text thread that someone responds to on the daily. In fact, there were 47 missed texts yesterday about the season three, and joking, and sharing old photos from our set. It was a long process. It was hard; it was fun; it was really special.
Will Emily be in season 3? I doubt it. I was what, the first or second grade teacher? And I guess maybe she could be teaching older kids at this point. But also, sweet Emily, I don&rsquo;t think she was great at her job, or handling conflict in a reasonable manner. So could also see a world where Reese&rsquo;s character just said, &ldquo;We need to get this teacher out of here.&rdquo; [Laughs] But regardless, I will definitely be watching 100%.</p>
<p>And you mentioned also an Apple TV show coming up. Could you talk a little bit more about that project? I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>Virginia Kull: Yeah. It&rsquo;s a miniseries that David E. Kelley wrote based on the novel Presumed Innocent, and there was also a film that Harrison Ford did back in the nineties with it. And it&rsquo;s got a tremendous cast: Ruth Negga, Jake Gyllenhaal, Bill Camp, Peter Sarsgaard, Renate Reinsve. It&rsquo;s just a tremendous cast. And we shot that right before the strike, so the timing worked out quite well.</p>
