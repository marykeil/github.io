## Literature Review
Cameron Hardin was the first player eliminated from Big Brother Reindeer Games, surprising some after BB 25. Here&#39;s why he was the best boot choice.




Big Brother Reindeer Games first elimination saw Big Brother 25&#39;s most polarizing houseguest, Cameron Hardin, fail to complete the challenge in Santa&#39;s Showdown, sending him packing just a day into the competition. While some were excited to see the Big Brother 25 houseguest redeem himself on the new series, others hoped to see Cameron be the first to go. The competition, a spin-off of Big Brother that focuses more on the game&#39;s competitive aspect and removes many of the social elements, consists of a group of BB legends. Cameron and some of the other newer players in the Big Brother Reindeer Games cast don&#39;t quite fit the bill.
Big Brother Reindeer Games is an isolated series, incorporating some of the most interesting elements of Big Brother without the need for 24-hour live feeds. A holiday-themed six-episode event, BB Redineer Games brings some of the most legendary players of all time back to the house to compete in challenges for a $100,000 grand prize. With players like BB 22&#39;s Cody Calafiore and BB 3 &amp; 7&#39;s Danielle Reyes competing, it&#39;s anyone&#39;s game.Cameron&#39;s time on Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 was short but proved why he was the perfect person to be the first boot of the series.

 8  Cameron Was A Competitive Threat 
He Won Nearly Every Competition He Was In On BB25
        

Cameron was a competitive threat during his time on Big Brother 25, which was a disadvantage for him coming into Big Brother Reindeer Games. While not all BB alumni continue to keep up with the series, the majority of the players in the game were aware of who Cameron was and what his reputation in the BB house was. As a competitor, Cameron won nearly every competition he was in during his run on Big Brother. He was always able to compete when his back was against the wall, and coming into a house of legends with such a recently developed reputation, he was seen as a major threat.





 7  Cameron Was The Rookie In The Game 
He Was On The Most Recent BB Season


 







While there are other recent BB players on Big Brother Reindeer Games, like BB 23&#39;s Xavier Prather and BB 24&#39;s Taylor Hale, Cameron was the only player from the most recent BB season. As a houseguest from the most recent season, not only was he an easy target, but he was one of the few people without pre-existing relationships. While there may be many people who have played Big Brother in the past, the pool of houseguests from past seasons who interact with the series regularly is quite small, and they typically know each other decently well. Having yet to meet anyone outside the game, Cameron had no connections.





 6  Cameron&#39;s Social Game Was Lacking On BB Reindeer Games 
He Couldn&#39;t Make Connections
        

Though unsurprising to those who watched him on Big Brother 25, Cameron&#39;s social game was lacking when it came to his short time on Big Brother Reindeer Games. Known as one of the most puzzling players to enter the BB 25 house, Cameron often spoke in riddles to the other houseguests during his time in the game and frequently found himself without much information to give him leverage. Cameron was always outside the power structure in the game, and tended to make himself a target by assuming otherwise and speaking down to other houseguests. Unsurprisingly, his lack of social skills continued on BB Reindeer Games, making him an easy target.





 5  Cameron&#39;s Competitive Abilities Failed Him 
He Wasn&#39;t Able To Pull Out A Win


Although Cameron was a competition threat during his time on Big Brother, his strategy coming into the Big Brother Reindeer Games house appeared to be making himself look less threatening. He explained in a diary room interview that he wasn&#39;t looking to win the first competition, which would give its winner the power to give one player a disadvantage during the next challenge. While it wasn&#39;t clear if he threw the first competition, he lost to Big Brother 12 and 14 houseguest Britney Haynes and wound up going into the second competition without an advantage or disadvantage. Cameron ultimately lost both the second competition and his Santa Showdown to Xavier.





 4  Cameron&#39;s Time In The BB House Was Too Recent 
He Still Wasn&#39;t Over The BB25 Game
        

During his time on Big Brother Reindeer Games, it was clear that Cameron was one of the most recent houseguests in the mix, as he was still reeling from his experiences on Big Brother 25. Announcing it was like he&#39;d never left upon entering the house, Cameron may have been joking around, but he was still unpacking having lived in the BB house for an extended 100 days. Other Big Brother Reindeer Games competitors even shared that Cameron seemed like he wasn&#39;t past some of the mental exhaustion that houseguests feel emerging from the game, which made it tougher for him to excel on BB Reindeer Games.





 3  Cameron Has Been Polarizing To Big Brother Viewers 
He&#39;s Either Loved Or Hated Among Fans


 







Cameron was a great first boot from Big Brother Reindeer Games because many of the BB 25 viewers weren&#39;t happy to see him returning to another BB series, especially so quickly. While Cameron was praised by some Big Brother 25 viewers, many didn&#39;t enjoy his antics or behavior throughout his time in the game. From speaking down to other houseguests to making unwanted advances at women in the house and denying things he said and did, Cameron was an overwhelming houseguest to watch navigate the game. His polarizing presence wasn&#39;t something needed for the Big Brother Reindeer Games audience, who is looking for more light-hearted content on the series.





 2  Cameron Didn&#39;t Mesh Well With The Cast 
He Was Starstruck Meeting Other BB Alumni


 







Although Cameron has spent the last month outside the BB house getting acclimated to life as a former Big Brother houseguest, his time on the newest series showed he was still starstruck meeting alumni. With Big Brother Reindeer Games being lauded as a group of legendary players coming together for an intense competition, seeing Cameron starstruck by meeting players he&#39;s been a fan of for years made it clear he wasn&#39;t ready to be in the mix with them yet. While Cameron may have been able to compete on Big Brother 25, working with people who have been around BB for years was still too much for him to handle.





 1  Cameron Didn&#39;t Have Any Twist Benefits 
He Was Helped Along By Twists On BB25
        

Although Big Brother Reindeer Games was kind enough to bring Cameron back after a tough time on BB 25, he didn&#39;t receive the same level of help from production that he had during his initial run on the series. Cameron&#39;s game was pushed along by twists from the production team throughout Big Brother 25, and it has been posited that he was made aware of BB Reindeer Games ahead of time, before his second unanimous eviction from the show. While Cameron may have been helped by production during BB 25, Big Brother Reindeer Games didn&#39;t offer him any twists to keep him around, leading to his swift elimination.
