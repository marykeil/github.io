# 10 TV Shows Based On Movies That Couldnt Live Up To The Original Film


## SUMMARY 


 TV adaptations of successful films often struggle to match the quality of the source material due to recasting and the need to reinvent the premise. 
 Successful TV adaptations need to explore new themes, expand the narrative universe, and introduce new conflicts to avoid rehashing already explored concepts. 
 Shows based on films can fall into the pitfall of adopting an episodic format, which limits the depth and complexity that a film can offer.

## Literature Review
Basing a TV series off a movie is always a gamble and these shows didn&#39;t have what it takes to compete with the iconic stories of the original films. 




Adapting a television series from a successful film isn&#39;t an easy task, and if the film was a hit, that often means the show would never be as good as the source material. Recasting the roles for television can be confusing for the viewer, or a let-down if the actors aren&#39;t as good as the performers in the film. Additionally, a film should tell a full story that&#39;s complete by the end, so a show has to reinvent the premise or tell a new story that takes place in the world of the film. 
For a TV show based on a film to be successful, it needs to explore original themes or expand the universe of the narrative compellingly, and introduce new conflicts. Creating a carbon copy of the film will only rehash concepts that have already been fully explored and this becomes boring quickly. A common pitfall of the series adaptations is pivoting to trope-y, procedural plotting that leans toward an episodic format instead of serialized. While there&#39;s nothing wrong with the episodic approach, it can rarely capture the depth and thematic complexities of a film.
            
 
 10 Best TV Shows Based On Movies, Ranked 
Surprisingly, some of the best TV shows, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, aren&#39;t exactly originals, as they are based on movies.













 








 10  True Lies (2023 - ) 
Based on True Lies (1994)


 







True Lies expands upon the 1994 film by having a woman, Helen, find out her husband is a secret agent and then join him on his missions because of her linguistic skills. The series attempts to modernize the film&#39;s premise, which has the wife as a side character in need of rescue. Though the show Helen (Ginger Gonzaga) is a stronger and more developed character than Helen (Jaime Lee Curtis) in the movie, the series lacks the action and stakes of the film. Additionally, the leads don&#39;t have the chemistry and star power that the film stars did, which isn&#39;t helped by the forced sitcom format that the show takes.





 9  Clueless (1996 - 1999) 
Based on Clueless (1995)
        

Clueless (1995) is considered a classic &#39;90s teen romantic comedy and remains a popular part of the cultural zeitgeist to the day. Where the show fails the most is the re-cast of the main character, Cher. In the show, she&#39;s played by Rachel Blanchard, who tries her best but doesn&#39;t match the charisma and comedic timing of Alicia Silverstone. Though some of the original actors do make up the series&#39; cast, the sub-par writing doesn&#39;t reach the heights of the film. 
Part of the draw of the film is that though the teenage characters think they act like adults and have plenty of money and connections, they still have the same emotional problems as everyone else. The show reduces these conflicts to the episodic format of a sitcom, which betrays the character development of the film. Additionally, Cher&#39;s love interest, Josh, is virtually non-existent in the show and was written out in the later seasons.





 8  Limitless (2015 - 2016) 
Based on Limitless (2011)
        

Limitless, the movie, has a fun premise. A pill gives Eddie (Bradley Cooper) the ability to use 100% of his brain, and he uses this ability for financial gain and dubious activities. Brian (Jake McDorman) also gets his hands on the pill in the show but uses it for predictable and formulaic ends. He joins the FBI to help them solve cases and the inventive concept of the film is reduced to a crime procedural. Even with the twist of the wonder drug, and the secrets that Brian is keeping, the show fails to distinguish itself from any of the other crime dramas of its time.





 7  Minority Report (2015) 
Based on Minority Report (2002)
        

The Minority Report series was reviewed to be wholly unnecessary and the motivation to make it at all was unclear. It&#39;s hard to imagine that any actor could live up to the draw and performance of Tom Cruise, and as hard as the show tries, the leads have terrible chemistry. The romantic tension the series tries to push between Lara (Meagan Vega) and Dash (Stark Sands) is worse than forced and completely disregards the point of the movie.
In the film, the efficacy of &#34;precogs&#34; is called into question and the way crimes are solved is a point of contention. Though the series posits that the &#34;precog&#34; program has been disbanded, Dash&#39;s gifts are still treated as something special and beneficial for the police force. Ignoring the moral questions of the film, the series follows Lara and Dash as they solve crimes together, which is only made slightly interesting by Dash&#39;s psychic abilities.





 6  Rush Hour (2016) 
Based on Rush Hour (1998)
        

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are what make the Rush Hour movies work. The premise is outlandish, and the plots aren&#39;t particularly compelling, but the duo are hilarious and skilled performers who work off each other with ease. This dynamic is hard to find, and could not be recaptured by Justin Hires and Jon Foo, the series&#39; leads. Instead of fun conspiracies and dangerous enemies, the show follows the murder-of-the-week format, making the show more predictable than the movies. It could have been saved if the cast had been more compatible and had better material to work with.





 5  10 Things I Hate About You (2009 - 2010) 
Based on 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)


 







Made ten years after the film&#39;s premiere, the 10 Things I Hate About You show was predicated on audiences falling out of touch with the movie and forgetting the premise. This was not the case as the film has remained a well-known classic, and the actors who made their name in the movie went on to become huge stars. The characters are the same, but in name only, as the way they&#39;re written isn&#39;t close to the quippy and mature way the film&#39;s cast delivers the dialogue. By forgoing the somewhat problematic bet plotline, the series lacks significant conflict and joins the ranks of forgettable teen dramas of the 2000s.





 4  Damien (2016) 
Based on The Omen (1976)
        

Bradley James, who&#39;s best known for his role as King Arthur in the BBC series Merlin, plays the adult version of Damien, the child from the 1976 film The Omen. In Damien, he is unaware that he is the Antichrist, and the events of the series are kicked off by his realization. It&#39;s an interesting twist and a look into how the lives of children in horror movies might unfold. Unfortunately, the show doesn&#39;t effectively emulate the horror of the film, which is one of its biggest draws. Additionally, the characters are one-dimensional, and despite the shocking revelation that he is the Antichrist, Damien simply takes it in his stride.





 3  Ferris Bueller (1990 - 1991) 
Based on Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off (1986)
        

John Huges was one of the biggest film directors in the coming-of-age niche during the 1980s. His film, Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off, features the character Ferris (Matthew Broderick), whom teens have been emulating since the movie premiered. The series, Ferris Bueller, is about the &#34;real&#34; Ferris who hates the film that&#39;s based on him and wants to tell his true story. This meta-textual reference is as deep as the series gets, and it quickly devolves into the everyday antics of high schoolers. It&#39;s not worth watching, except for the appearance of a young Jennifer Aniston as Ferris&#39; sister.

Writer and director John Hughes gave the 1980s some truly memorable and entertaining movies. Here&#39;s how they all stack up against each other. 









 2  RoboCop: The Series (1994) 
Based on RoboCop (1987)
        

The RoboCop films are already campy and not to be taken seriously, but RoboCop: The Series takes this to another level. It didn&#39;t have the budget of the films, so the effects were not as good, and it had the restrictions of network television, which meant the action sequences weren&#39;t as interesting. All the crimes and murders that RoboCop (Richard Eden) sets out to solve are predictable, not exploring the opportunities that having a police officer with incredible powers presents. Being so short-lived, the series is a footnote in the larger universe of the franchise.





 1  Dirty Dancing (1988 - 1989) 
Based on Dirty Dancing (1987)


 







Starring Melora Hardin, best known for her role as Jan in The Office, the Dirty Dancing TV series doesn&#39;t have the character or the choreography to compete with the film. The romantic premise of the film remains intact, but the power dynamic is slightly shifted as Baby is positioned as Johnny&#39;s (Patrick Cassidy) boss instead of a guest at the resort. Largely forgotten and overshadowed by the original film, it&#39;s for good reason. Baby and Johnny don&#39;t seem to like each other at all in the series, which makes it difficult to root for the central couple.
