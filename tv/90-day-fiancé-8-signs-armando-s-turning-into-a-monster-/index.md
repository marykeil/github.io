## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Armando Rubio is turning into a monster, but it may be because his husband, Kenny Niedermeier, is changing him.




90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Armando Rubio is turning into a monster, but it may be because of his husband Kenny Niedermeier&#39;s influence. Viewers were first introduced to Kenny, 61, and Armando, 34, on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 2, where Kenny&#39;s initial move to Armando&#39;s native Mexico was highlighted. Once in Mexico, Kenny met Armando&#39;s family while they struggled to accept Armando as a gay man. Armando has a daughter, Hannah, from his previous marriage. His wife passed away in a car accident, and he and Kenny met in an online support group for gay fathers.
Kenny and Armando got married on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 3 in a lavish Mexican wedding where it became clear the pair were accepted for who they were within Armando&#39;s family. Fans have been watching Kenny and Armando on 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way season 5 after they skipped having a storyline on season 4. This season, Kenny and Armando have decided to follow through with having a child together after going back and forth on the idea for a long time. They&#39;ve been exploring surrogacy while the topic of Kenny nearly being a senior has been at the forefront of their moral dilemma.









 








 8  Armando Won&#39;t Move To The U.S. For Kenny 


 







Kenny has four children and several grandchildren in the U.S., whom he is really close to. While Kenny visits them in Florida occasionally, and they support their dad&#39;s relationship with Armando, Kenny has not been physically around when they&#39;ve needed him. Armando could be to blame for this. Armando has selfishly decided that Kenny needs to be in Mexico because his family is there, especially for Hannah, after losing her mom. While it&#39;s true that Hannah needs her relatives, Armando is not letting Hannah get to know Kenny&#39;s side of the family the way she could.
Kenny and Armando have lived in Mexico for four years, but Kenny never seems to bring up the idea of trying out living in the U.S., maybe because he knows Armando would not be on board. Kenny uprooted his whole life to be with Armando in Mexico, and it doesn&#39;t always seem like Armando fully appreciates that. However, Kenny does play a big part in this because he is trying to appease Armando by not making a big deal out of attempting to move to the U.S.





 7  Armando Is Pushing Almost Senior Kenny To Have A Baby 


 







Armando is fervent about having a baby with Kenny despite Kenny being in his sixties. Armando not only wants Hannah to have a sibling but also wants to have a baby for himself and one that is biologically Kenny&#39;s in order to blend their families. Kenny has continuously brought up his age as a major moral factor in the option not to move forward with having a child. Kenny knows he will be in his eighties when his child is a teenager and in their twenties. Armando seems to disregard that important and valid notion and wants to push on for his own sake.
While it makes sense for Armando to have a biological piece of Kenny for when he&#39;s gone, it seems irresponsible to have a child, given their circumstances with Kenny&#39;s age. Armando pushed Kenny hard to say yes to following through with surrogacy with the notion that having a baby with Kenny was his ultimate dream, and Kenny did not want to crush Armando&#39;s dream. Kenny let himself be coerced by Armando into having a baby, but Armando may not have ever pressed the idea in the first place if Kenny shut it down early.





 6  Armando Was Bridezilla 
Armando showed his true diva colors during his and Kenny&#39;s wedding planning and execution. Kenny let Armando take the reins and plan an extravagant Mexican wedding and even allowed his sunset ceremony dream to be put to the side. Kenny underscored that Armando was being a bridezilla, which gave way to Armando&#39;s continued behavior. If Kenny wasn&#39;t so flippant about Armando&#39;s attitude, it&#39;s possible Armando would have behaved better.





 5  Armando Was Resistant To Moving To Mexico City 


 







On 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, Kenny convinced Armando to spend six weeks living in Mexico City, with the potential idea of moving there. They had been living in the quiet and private seaside community of La Misión, Mexico, which is a days-long drive from Mexico City. Kenny wanted to move to the big city for a change of pace and for Hannah to experience different schools and a different way of living. Armando was very resistant to the idea because he was afraid and liked the familiarity of their lives in La Misión.
Ultimately, Kenny convinced Armando to agree to the move after using Hannah&#39;s compliance with the idea as ammunition. Armando was initially adamantly unwilling to concede to change, but Kenny was able to press him into the move. While Armando is not great with change, Kenny is attempting to broaden Armando&#39;s horizons for the better, but it&#39;s proven not to be easy because it took a lot of convincing.





 4  Armando Is Delusional About The Future 
        

Armando firmly believes that having a baby with Kenny will bring them closer together as a couple, and he hasn&#39;t paused to think of the potential consequences. Armando is clinging to the idea that raising a child will solidify their bond and family unit, but he has not thought about everything it takes to take care of a baby. Armando has been delusional about thinking the experience will be easy for them, especially given Kenny&#39;s age. Having a baby will mean less time for them as a couple, and he won&#39;t have as much attention on his daughter Hannah.





 3  Armando Does Not Visit Kenny&#39;s Family 


Armando has shown that he is supportive towards Kenny when he misses his family, but he does not encourage Kenny to visit his family in America more often. Moreover, Armando never goes with Kenny to visit his family in Florida, signaling that he is not keen on making an effort. Since they&#39;ve been together so long, Armando has had a lot of time to get a visa to visit if he wants to. Kenny is often pictured at family functions solo, which is a red flag about how much Armando cares about Kenny&#39;s family.





 2  Armando Is Selfish 
        

It appears as though Armando is the one running the show in his marriage to Kenny. The setting and trajectory of their lives seem to be centered around what is best for Armando, which is selfish. He did concede to moving to Mexico City, but his back was against the wall after Kenny got Hannah on his side. Armando wants his and Kenny&#39;s life to be the way he wants it, and that means letting Kenny do most of the compromising.





 1  Armando Made His Mom Cry 
        

Armando has a strained relationship with his family over the way they handled him coming out. Armando explained that Mexican culture does not have a lot of tolerance or acceptance of gay people, and his parents were in that category initially. However, after meeting Kenny and making an effort to understand Armando more, Armando&#39;s parents came around to acceptance and into a supportive role. Without Kenny in his life, Armando may not have had the chance to persevere with his parents. But Armando&#39;s also proven that he is now willing to make his parents feel bad.
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 viewers watched Armando lay into his mom, Virginia, when she visited him, Kenny, and Hannah in Mexico City. Armando sensed his mom&#39;s resistance to the Mexico City move and guilted her into getting on board with it while reminding her how she was not there for him when he came out. He recalled contemplating ending his life because of how alone he felt, and the conversation brought his mother to tears. Virginia apologized for her past wavering and said she supported him in whatever he wanted to do.
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
