## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Shekinah Garner reveals why she thinks Andrei Castravet is toxic after the Tell-All teases a shocking showdown.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Shekinah Garner claims that Andrei Castravet is not &#34;intelligent enough&#34; after her shocking Tell-All argument with the Moldovan man. Shekinah stars in The Other Way season 5 with Sarper Güven. Shekinah is a Los Angeles-based aesthetician and makeup artist who moved to Istanbul to be with Sarper after five months of dating. Shekinah noticed several red flags in Sarper, such as his past involving 2,500 women and refusing to post about her on Instagram. Shekinah was also being controlled by Sarper, who dictated how much she should weigh and what she should eat.




Shekinah didn&#39;t find anything wrong in Sarper&#39;s behavior, but Shekinah is calling out another 90 Day Fiancé cast member for being toxic.

          

One of Shekinah&#39;s Instagram followers asked her, &#34;Wtf is Andries [sic] problem? He is controlling to his wife lol! And aggressive in doing so!&#34; during her Instagram Q&amp;A session. Shekinah replied, &#34;He&#39;s full of toxic ego driven energy.&#34; Shekinah called Sarper &#34;painfully aggressive.&#34; She said that Andrei is unfortunately not &#34;intelligent enough&#34; for her to have a fair argument with him. Shekinah asked her followers to wait until they can see the whole scene of her argument with Andrei, which has been teased in a preview of The Other Way season 5 Tell-All Part 3.





 What Happened Between Shekinah &amp; Andre At The Other Way Tell-All? 
          

90 Day Fiancé shared the clip on Instagram, revealing a showdown between Shekinah and Andrei, who seemingly don&#39;t seem to have any connection at all with each other. Moreover, Andrei has never been on any The Other Way season. However, he was one of the seasoned cast members invited to the Tell-All to share their opinions on the current couples. Andrei joined Tim Malcom, Kalani Faagata, and Tania Maduro on set but didn&#39;t make any controversial statements so far during Part 1. Still, the video shows Andrei walking up to Shekinah during a break, and she asks him if he&#39;s seriously coming up to her and confronting her.


 




Andrei arrogantly replies, &#34;Yes&#34; and adds, &#34;You&#39;re saying that I&#39;m the most toxic person here.&#34; Shekinah, who&#39;s tried to remain calm throughout the conversation and is sitting down, asks Andrei to go and take his seat. She says she doesn&#39;t know what Andrei is talking about. Andrei gets furious that Shekinah has asked him to sit down. &#34;You&#39;re not gonna tell me to sit down,&#34; he yells as Shekinah asks him to &#34;get out&#34; of her face. Shekinah is upset. She tells him, &#34;Goodbye.&#34; However, Andrei tells Shekinah to &#34;f*** off,&#34; and Shekinah replies, &#34;He&#39;s a d***.&#34;

The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way previews don&#39;t quite reveal what happened between the two cast members for them to act this way. Even Sarper, who is watching their conversation through his screen, chooses to remain quiet. Other stars such as Kenneth “Kenny” Niedermeier and Julio Moya look on with shocked expressions. It seems Kimberly Rochelle and Jenny Slatten weren&#39;t the only unexpected cast members feuding this season in the reunion episodes.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
