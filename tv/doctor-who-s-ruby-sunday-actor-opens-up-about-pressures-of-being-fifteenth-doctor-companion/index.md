## Literature Review
Doctor Who&#39;s Ruby Sunday actor Millie Gibson opens up about the pressures and preparation she took to portray the TARDIS&#39; newest passenger.




Doctor Who star Millie Gibson opens up about the preparations to play the latest companion, Ruby Sunday, and the pressures of joining the long-running sci-fi series. The actor made her debut in 2023&#39;s seasonal special, &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; in which the young foundling, in search of her parents, finds herself swept into the path of Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor when facing down goblins. Gibson will rejoin Gatwa for season 14 and is currently filming season 15, which is expected to air in 2025.




As Gibson is set to take flight with Gatwa in Doctor Who season 14, the star opened up to Doctor Who: Unleashed about becoming the Doctor&#39;s latest companion, revealing how she prepared herself for the role. Having grown up watching the show and knowing the role the companion plays in the series, the actor knew that she would have to craft her unique character to leave an impression on viewers. Check out Gibson&#39;s full explanation below:


I have watched it. I was really familiar with the show, but I think with the companion, it’s different to the Doctor, ‘cause obviously you’re playing the same person, but it’s just regenerated. And I don’t know, with the companion I was like “I’m just going to make them fall in love with the new companion of this era.”



 How Ruby Sunday Shares A Bond With The Fifteenth Doctor 
          




While Gibson hopes Ruby will leave a positive impression on Doctor Who viewers, the companion has already won the Doctor&#39;s attention. Intrigued by the apparent terrible luck of the foundling, the Fifteenth Doctor spends the opening act of &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; watching the young companion as she goes about her life, only intervening when necessary. As soon as the Goblins make themselves known and attempt to abduct Ruby&#39;s new foster sister, Lulubelle, the Doctor springs into action and joins forces with Ruby, becoming an effective team at outsmarting goblins. However, the Doctor and Ruby have more in common than the Time Lord initially assumed.

Learning of Ruby&#39;s far-reaching foster family and the circumstances behind her adoption, the Doctor realizes that another person may understand the situation he has found himself in due to Doctor Who season 12&#39;s &#34;Timeless Child&#34; revelations. Opening up about what he had been bottling up throughout the latter half of his thirteenth regeneration and into his fourteenth, the Doctor reveals his origin to Ruby and adoptive mother Carla (Michelle Greenidge) in a rare moment of peace before the goblins return. An encounter with Ruby reminded the Doctor that he didn&#39;t have to be alone. The Time Lord could open up to others and find beings across the cosmos who knew what he had been through, leading to him and Ruby forming a bond from how their lives had shaped them.




                  Gatwa&#39;s Doctor Who Finally Acknowledges 1 Glaring Timeless Child Plot Hole   Doctor Who&#39;s Timeless Child ripped numerous plot holes into the show&#39;s continuity, and Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor has now acknowledged a big one.    

&#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; was a perfect introduction to Gibson&#39;s new Doctor Who companion. It not only introduced the mystery of Ruby&#39;s origin and created an emotional bond between her and the Doctor but showcased her caring, headfirst, and fiery character through her family and encounters with aliens. As such, there is a good glimpse into how Ruby may act in season 14. Furthermore, with Gibson currently filming season 15, Ruby will clearly be a mainstay companion for many years.



Doctor Who: The Church on Ruby Road is available on Disney&#43; for international audiences and on BBC iPlayer for UK viewers. Doctor Who season 14 is set to air in May 2024.
