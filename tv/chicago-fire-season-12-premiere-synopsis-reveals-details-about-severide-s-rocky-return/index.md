# Chicago Fire Season 12 Premiere Synopsis Reveals Details About Severide s Rocky Return


## SUMMARY 



  The Chicago Fire season 12 premiere will see Kidd and Severide back together, but their relationship will be tested by an arson case.   Severide&#39;s erratic behavior and detours without consulting Kidd may be connected to a gestating issue, potentially leading to problems in their marriage.   Unless there are big reasons for departure, it&#39;s unlikely that Kidd and Severide will be split up, considering all the failed romances in the show.

## Literature Review
Taylor Kinney is confirmed to finally return as Kelly Severide, but the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere details reveal more issues coming his way. 




The Chicago Fire season 12 premiere teases more issues for Kelly Severide and Stella Kidd. On the heels of the Chicago Fire season 11 finale, the One Chicago pioneering series has its work cut out for it, juggling multiple storylines in its return. Amid a string of cliffhangers, one of the most anticipated moments of Chicago Fire season 12 is the reunion of Kidd and Severide on screen, which is confirmed after Taylor Kinney&#39;s unexpected and extended leave of absence in the middle of season 11.




Per TV Line, the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere will see the newlyweds back on shift together. Sadly, instead of a smooth sailing time at work, Kidd and Severide will find themselves arguing over an arson case. Read the full synopsis below:


“Barley Gone” — Firehouse 51 is forced to share its space with Firehouse 17. Kidd and Herrmann fight over Ritter. An arson case tests Kidd and Severide’s relationship. Firehouse 51 says goodbye to one of its own.



 Will Severide and Kidd’s Marriage Survive In Chicago Fire Season 12? 
          

Kinney&#39;s last-minute request to go on leave left the Wolf Entertainment writers scrambling to find a way to explain his absence. In the end, they decided on Severide being sent to an OFI training camp at the last minute, which he gladly attended. His departure was supposed to be temporary, but concerns about whether Kinney would return started to appear. Even with his homecoming, however, Severide is haunted by problems, which could result in his marriage crumbling.




                  Chicago Fire Season 12 Must Fix Its Big Severide Problem   NBC&#39;s One Chicago ruins Taylor Kinney&#39;s Kelly Severide and Chicago Fire season 12 needs to fix him. Luckily, there&#39;s an easy way to make up for it.    

This is a much more organic way of moving Severide and Kidd&#39;s story forward. It&#39;s worth noting that Kidd was supportive of her husband&#39;s decision to take a step back from Firehouse 51 and pursue his OFI endeavor. However, instead of being considerate of his wife, Severide decided to take detours during his out-of-town trip without consulting Kidd. The reason for his erratic behavior remains unclear, but it&#39;s safe to say that the arson issue that they are facing in the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere is somehow connected to their gestating problems.

Unless there&#39;s a bigger reason, like Kinney or Miranda Mae Mayo deciding to exit Chicago Fire, it&#39;s safe to say that Kidd and Severide will continue to be together. Considering all the failed romances in the show, there&#39;s no reason for Wolf Entertainment and NBC to break them up. However, if either of them decides to end their stint on the procedural, there may be no other way to handle it than splitting them up.
