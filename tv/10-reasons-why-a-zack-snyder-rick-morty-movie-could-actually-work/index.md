News about a Zack Snyder Rick and Morty movie has been making the rounds, and here&#39;s why a movie helmed by the legendary director could actually work. Rick and Morty is one of the most iconic adult animated shows of the modern era, with its high-concept sci-fi and wacky animation style causing it to stand out from the crowd. However, these aspects that make the series great also make it incredibly hard to adapt into a live-action film.

 10  Zack Snyder Is A Rick &amp; Morty Fan 
        

One of the biggest reasons that a Rick and Morty movie directed by Zack Snyder could work is that Snyder is an actual Rick and Morty fan. When discussing the meeting, Dan Harmon described Snyder as a Rick and Morty &#34;super fan,&#34; proving that he has one of the elements that is essential to making a good Rick and Morty movie. Due to how popular the franchise is, the Rick and Morty movie will have to get a lot of stuff right, and having a fan like Zack Snyder in the director&#39;s chair will help ensure that the franchise is in safe hands.





 9  Zack Snyder Is Known For Dealing With Larger Than Life Characters 
        

Rick is undeniably a larger-than-life character, with it undoubtedly being incredibly difficult to adapt the smartest man in the universe. Luckily, Zack Snyder has been directing films starring larger-than-life characters for years, with many of Snyder&#39;s characters seeming like mythological characters. Snyder has directed movies starring Superman, Batman, Leonidas, and Dr. Manhattan, meaning that he shouldn&#39;t have trouble handling a character as powerful as Rick Sanchez. If anyone can tackle a character as legendary and as overpowered as Rick, its Zack Snyder.





 8  Rick &amp; Morty’s Multiversal Adventures Can Be Handled By Zack Snyder 


 







The multiverse is an incredibly hard-to-handle concept, but it is key to getting a Rick and Morty story right. Luckily, Zack Snyder has dealt in stories with all kinds of timeline weirdness, meaning that the multiverse is only a minor step up from Snyder&#39;s previous works. Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League features the Flash&#39;s timeline shenanigans, and Snyder even had a hand in The Flash, a multiversal film. Army of the Dead also implied that it had some odd time loops going on, proving Zack Snyder is perfect fine toying around with the fabric of reality.





 7  Zack Snyder Has Worked In Live-Action &amp; In Animation 
        

It is unknown if the Rick and Morty movie will be animated like the TV show original or if it will be a live-action adaptation. Luckily, Zack Snyder has a history with both mediums, meaning that he could make either version of the Rick and Morty movie work. Snyder is undoubtedly more familiar with live-action, as many of the director&#39;s most popular works have been made in the medium. However, Snyder is also familiar with animation, as he directed the 2010 film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga&#39;Hoole.





 6  Zack Snyder Is Familiar With Massive Franchises 
        

Rick and Morty is one of the biggest ongoing franchises today, but that should be no problem for Zack Snyder. After all, Zack Snyder spearheaded the DCEU, with this franchise featuring some of the most recognizable characters of all time. After dealing with Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, Snyder could seemingly tackle anything. While Rick and Morty is immensely popular, it is far less so than the iconic characters of DC Comics.





 5  Rick &amp; Morty’s Aliens Can Be Perfectly Adapted By Zack Snyder 
        

One of the most well-known things about Rick and Morty is its aliens, with nearly every episode featuring a wacky new design that is shown throughout the story. Many of Rick and Morty&#39;s most popular characters would be hard to translate into live-action, but if anyone can do it, it&#39;s Zack Snyder. Zack Snyder has adapted all sorts of illustrated aliens into live-action, including characters like Darkseid and Steppenwolf. While Rick and Morty&#39;s aliens are more comedic, Snyder could successfully employ the same strategies he did with the DCEU.





 4  Zack Snyder Has Adapted Franchises With Immensley Passionate Fanbases Before 
        

Rick and Morty famously has one of the most passionate fanbases ever, with the real-world influence that the series has had being unmatched by most other TV shows. Luckily, Zack Snyder is familiar with creating work for passionate fanbases, even ones that are incredibly divisive. Snyder&#39;s time as the main director of the DCEU was plagued with criticism and praise from the DC fanbase, and a Rick and Morty movie would probably be faced with the same fate.





 3  Rick Is An Unlikable Protagonist, Making Him Perfect For A Snyder Movie 
        

Zack Snyder&#39;s films often feature problematic and unlikable protagonists, which is why he would be perfect to direct a Rick and Morty movie. Rick Sanchez is famously an unlikable protagonist, with the character having very few redeeming qualities and often making the wrong choices. Snyder directed Watchmen, which stars a comparably egotistical Rorschach, meaning that he could definitely handle Rick.

 2  Snyder Is Self-Aware Enough To Make Fun Of Himself In Rick &amp; Morty 


 







One of the keys to Rick and Morty&#39;s humor is how self-aware the show is, with most of the episodes featuring meta humor that makes fun of Rick and Morty, Adult Swim, and broader pop culture. If a figure as big as Zack Snyder is going to direct the Rick and Morty movie, the film would undoubtedly have to make fun of him. Luckily, Zack Snyder is perfectly fine with jokes about himself, with Snyder finding Barbie&#39;s joke about the Snyder Cut funny and appearing in a cameo role in Teen Titans Go!.





 1  The Rick &amp; Morty Movie Would Allow Snyder To Make A “Straight Comedy” 
        

One of the most exciting things that a director can do is try something new, and that&#39;s what Zack Snyder will get to do if he makes a Rick and Morty movie. When speaking about making a Rick and Morty movie, Zack Snyder has said that the potential film would be the closest he&#39;s ever gotten to making a &#34;straight comedy.&#34; All of Snyder&#39;s movies have humorous beats, but none of them have been comedies outright, something that he would get to attempt in the Rick and Morty movie.
