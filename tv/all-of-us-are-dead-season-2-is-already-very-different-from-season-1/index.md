# All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Is Already Very Different From Season 1


## SUMMARY 



  All of Us Are Dead season 2 will not be set in a school due to the destruction of Hyosan High, which was a central location in season 1.   The story of season 2 cannot replicate what season 1 did, as the characters are now in a different situation and most of the webtoon material has already been covered.   The success of All of Us Are Dead season 1 naturally led to the show&#39;s renewal for a second season, despite the potential for the story to have ended with the first season&#39;s finale.

## Literature Review
All of Us Are Dead season 2’s release date remains to be announced, but the hit zombie K-drama is already set to be very different from season 1.




All of Us Are Dead is returning, and while not much has been revealed about season 2, it is already very different from season 1. Netflix renewed All of Us Are Dead for a second season a couple of months after the show premiered, thus confirming the cliffhangers from the finale would not be left unsolved. Having one of Netflix’s best Korean shows return for another season is great news, but matching the quality of All of Us Are Dead season 1 will not be easy.




Although a lot of All of Us Are Dead characters have died, there are still quite a few fan-favorite names left for the show to follow. What All of Us Are Dead season 2’s story will be about remains to be seen, but it is safe to say Nam-ra’s return and what really happened to Cheong-say will be major plot points. It is also easy to predict that the second season will be nothing like the first one.


 All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Won’t Be Set In A School 
         

Hyosan High, the school where most of All of Us Are Dead took place, was destroyed at the end of season 1. The school, along with a significant portion of the city, was bombarded by the military in hopes of limiting the zombie outbreak to just one region. The sequence in which Hyosan High was destroyed was one of the most emotional moments in All of Us Are Dead, as viewers had spent more than 10 episodes following their favorite characters trying to survive inside that building. Each signature All of Us Are Dead location, from the classrooms to the hallways, is now gone.





 

All of Us Are Dead season 1&#39;s ending saw the remaining survivors entering a quarantine zone controlled by the military. While they briefly escaped the quarantine zone to look for Nam-ra and Cheong-san, the latter of which may be alive, the main All of Us Are Dead characters are currently in safety. It is difficult to predict what season 2 will be about, but the idea of a group of students trying to survive the zombie apocalypse in the limited space of a school with no help from the “outside world” cannot be used again. All of Us Are Dead season 2 will have to change.



 All Of Us Are Dead Season 2’s Story Cannot Replicate What Season 1 Did 
          




The most interesting aspect of All of Us Are Dead season 1 was following the same group of characters for more than 10 hours as they tried to leave the school amidst the zombie apocalypse. Although there were a couple of small time skips, season 1 felt almost as if the show was happening in real-time. Every poster and promotional material for All of Us Are Dead included the school, meaning Hyosan High became part of the show’s identity. Moving away from that will be difficult, especially because most of the webtoon All of Us Are Dead is based on has already been covered.

                  9 All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Characters We’re Worried Might Die In Season 2   From minor characters to fan-favorite names, no one is safe in the upcoming All of Us Are Dead season 2 after the first season lived up to its title.    

It can be argued that All of Us Are Dead did not need a second season. Apart from a couple of cliffhangers at the very end, namely Nam-ra joining the halfbies and the possibility of Cheong-san being alive, season 2’s finale could have very well been the end of the show. Most of the main characters made it out of the school alive, the outbreak was partially controlled, and Cheong-san sacrificed himself to save his friends. Still, given how successful All of Us Are Dead season 1 was, it is only natural that the show is returning for a second season.






 Netflix’s Other K-Drama Hit Proved How Different All Of Us Are Dead Will Be 
          

Netflix’s Sweet Home, whose first season was also about young characters trying to survive a mysterious monster outbreak inside a confined space, is the perfect example of how tricky it is to continue All of Us Are Dead. Sweet Home’s equivalent to the school from All of Us Are Dead was the Green Home building, where most of season 1 took place. However, just like what happened to Hyosan High, the Green Home was destroyed at the end of Sweet Home season 1. With most of the webtoon already covered and without its main location, Sweet Home had to reinvent itself ahead of season 2.

The very fact Sweet Home would return for a second season was divisive, as it would have to be an original story expanding beyond the source material. Sweet Home season 2 was very different from the first season, including but not limited to the introduction of new characters and storylines. While Sweet Home continued to be an entertaining, action-packed show, it did not recapture the magic of the first season, a problem All of Us Are Dead season 2 might deal with. Focusing on the halfbies or the military can make for interesting stories, but they will be a lot different from season 1.
