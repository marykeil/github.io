## Literature Review
In the upcoming episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, Daniele Gates reveals that Yohan Geronimo cheated on her during their entire marriage.




Daniele Gates 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way revealed everything about Yohan Geronimo’s 2-year-long cheating scandal to the cameras. The drama between the American woman and her Dominican husband hasn’t stopped over the last few months. However, their latest fight seemed the most crucial yet and solidified that they weren’t compatible. Yohan stole money from Daniele’s account, and she called him out. One incident led to another, and the two decided to break up instead of resolving their issues. Yohan even took their dog away with him, making his heartbroken wife cry again.




In the preview of the latest episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, Daniele opens up about Yohan and what he has done. She talked to the cameras and says (via ET), “I’ve learned some things over the course of last week that made me not care to fight for this marriage any longer.” The New York woman shares that Yohan had been in a relationship with another woman for over two years. She adds that the affair had been going on since the months before they got married on 90 Day Fiancé: Love in Paradise. She cryingly states, “I think that the Yohan that I was seeing and was believing was there was never actually in front of me.”

 The Woman Reached Out To Daniele On Social Media 

Daniele also reveals how she got to know about the whole scandal from the woman Yohan had cheated on her with. She says, “she had sex with him for all these years and she knew he was married.” The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star also discloses that Yohan’s other woman gave her a play-by-play of the 2-year-long relationship. Daniele claims the lady described “every single detail,” from every meet-up to the intimate photos Yohan had sent her. The 44-year-old woman exclaims, “one of them was a picture of his d*** on Christmas eve, while I was handing out gifts to his family.”




It’s shocking how Daniele’s relationship with Yohan played out in the end. Initially, Daniele was considered the main culprit in her marriage for not taking her husband to the United States. However, the latest events prove that it was Yohan who had crossed the line in the relationship by hooking up with another woman. Yohan not only cheated on Daniele, but he had a full-fledged two-year relationship with someone else while he was married. He certainly deserves punishment for it. Unfortunately, he’d probably get away as adultery is decriminalized in the Dominican Republic.

Even though Daniele wasn’t a sweet wife to Yohan, she still didn’t deserve to be backstabbed by him in this way. For months, she invested much in her marriage with Yohan and became part of his family. She financially contributed to the relationship and even paid for the apartment. Daniele earned for both herself and Yohan. She even agreed to have a baby with him and almost considered the egg donor procedure to make it happen. Thankfully, the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cast member didn’t reach any other major milestone with Yohan, or else the split would have been even more painful for her.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
