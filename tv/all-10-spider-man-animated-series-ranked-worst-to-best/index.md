# All 10 Spider-Man Animated Series Ranked Worst To Best


## SUMMARY 


 Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994) is fondly remembered and considered an instant defining rendition of the character, getting so much right without unnecessary changes. 
 The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008) stands out with its striking art style, engaging high-school drama, lively villains, and the most relatable Peter Parker in animation. 
 Spidey and His Amazing Friends (2021) is a cheery adventure, but the copycat format, colorful assets, and bobble-headed art style make it the weakest Spider-Man cartoon.

## Literature Review
Spider-Man has had many different animated series. While each are good in their own right, some stand head and shoulder above the rest.




As a character, Spider-Man is uniquely well-situated for being the star of an animated series, and distinguishing the quality of his many cartoon appearances can be a tricky task. With ten unique series under his belt since 1967, some of Spider-Man&#39;s best serializations has been through the medium of animation. Though Peter Parker&#39;s live-action iterations may get most of the spotlight, it&#39;s undeniable that cartoons have been doing the heavy lifting for Spider-Man for decades.
A versatile character, Spider-Man&#39;s many shows have a lot to set themselves apart from one another. The friendly-neighborhood hero works in many different contexts, from kid-friendly heroic adventures to gritty coming-of-age stories, and there is a different animated series that exists for every possible tone of story Spider-Man could find himself in. While each show has its value, some have contributed far more to the cultural domination of Spider-Man as Marvel&#39;s flagship character far more than others.









 








 10  Spidey and His Amazing Friends (2021) 
3 seasons (Ongoing)


 







Spidey and His Amazing Friends is by far the most kid-friendly version of Spider-Man around. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with adapting Spider-Man for young children, and the show does a fine job teaching valuable lessons to kids while providing enough of a look into the wider Marvel universe to retain the interest of captive parent audiences. That being said, the show&#39;s format, featuring Peter, Gwen and Miles as a heroic trio facing off against the same villains, is a blatant copy of similar animated series, PJ Masks. Combine that with some painfully colorful assets and an ungainly bobble-headed art style, and Spidey and His Amazing Friends is the weakest Spider-Man cartoon.





 9  Ultimate Spider-Man (2012) 
4 seasons
        

After the cancelation of fan-favorite Spectacular Spider-Man, fans had big expectations for the next Spider-Man series to debut in its place. A far more comedic take on Spider-Man, the series&#39; sense of humor was painfully informed by Family Guy&#39;s cutaway gags, with Peter practically turning to the camera to set up a jarring comedy sequence. With an annoying iteration of Peter, unnecessary crossovers, a stunning lack of character development and needless heaps of gadgets and vehicles, Ultimate Spider-Man ultimately doesn&#39;t live up to the lofty standards of its predecessor.





 8  Spider-Man (2017) 
3 seasons
        

Something of a return to form after the failures of Ultimate Spider-Man in the eyes of many fans, 2017&#39;s Spider-Man had a shaky start, but slowly got better over time. The series navigated important struggles to the Spider-Man mythos, like Peter&#39;s financial woes, and captured the character&#39;s scientific leanings with flying colors. Spider-Man also spiced things up with additions like Miles Morales, Ghost Spider, and Ms. Marvel, without having them eclipse Peter as the main character too much. However, the show makes some strange changes to Spider-Man&#39;s rogues gallery that undermines what made those characters work so well in the first place.





 7  Spider-Man (1981) 
1 season
        

Capitalizing off of the renewed interest in Spider-Man following the conclusion of the previous series in the late 70s, 1981&#39;s Spider-Man has a lot to appreciate. A solo series to contrast the same year&#39;s Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, this show had little of its sister series&#39; unabashed feel-good tone. Not afraid to get weird and dark, the 80s solo Spider-Man series is an overlooked and underrated blip in Spider-Man&#39;s animated catalog. But with only 26 short episodes and a somewhat grating Spider-Man performance, it isn&#39;t worth fighting for compared to the best of the hero&#39;s shows.





 6  Spider-Man Unlimited (1999) 
1 season


 







Breaking the mold of the traditional Spider-Man narrative, Spider-Man Unlimited took things in a bold new direction, plunging Peter Parker into the cyberpunk world of Counter-Earth. Clearly Marvel&#39;s answer to Batman Beyond, which came out the same year, Spider-Man Unlimited struggled to get out of its inspiration&#39;s shadow, with even its name sounding like a legally-tenuous synonym. Even though it was a solid Saturday morning cartoon that livened up the traditional Spider-Man formula, the series was simply canceled too soon to build momentum, forever robbing it of the potential it could&#39;ve had.





 5  Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (1981) 
3 seasons
        

A spin-off of the same year&#39;s standalone Spider-Man cartoon, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends saw Spider-Man team up with the X-men alumnus, Iceman, and Firestar, a pyrokinetic heroine who wouldn&#39;t debut in the comics until later. Iceman and Firestar were interesting additions to a Spider-Man serial, even if it was strange for them to all be living at Aunt May&#39;s house, with the characters opening up the possibilities for other fresh Marvel villains to enter Spider-Man&#39;s world. Iterative of DC&#39;s Super Friends, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends was a cheery Spider-Man adventure that wasn&#39;t bad, but was entirely not asked for.





 4  Spider-Man (1967) 
3 seasons
        

The progenitor of all Spider-Man cartoons, Spider-Man owes a lot to the 1967 cartoon, which is largely responsible for thrusting the character into pop-culture notoriety as Marvel&#39;s flagship character. The series is responsible for Spider-Man&#39;s iconic theme song and a handful of iconic Spider-Memes that have steadily supplied the character with a fresh stock of relevance, even years later. When objectively looking at the cartoon as a series, however, it certainly shows its age, with its cheap animation, and campy sensibilities. A venerated classic for a reason, 1967&#39;s Spider-Man still pales in comparison to more modern takes on the character.





 3  Spider-Man: The New Animated Series (2003) 
1 season
        

After the tough act to follow that was the 90s series, Spider-Man: The New Animated Series chose to break the mold in more ways than one, being the first Spider-Man cartoon to use 3-D animation and choosing to focus on Peter&#39;s college days. Featuring the voice talents of Neil Patrick Harris, of all people, as Spider-Man, the MTV series had a refreshingly mature tone that toed the line of being kid-friendly, likely in response to the popularity of Sam Raimi&#39;s first live-action film. If there&#39;s one thing that makes the show tough to watch, it&#39;s the nasty-looking early 3-D animation that time has not been kind to.





 2  Spider-Man: The Animated Series (1994) 
5 seasons


 







Though often overshadowed by the 90s X-Men animated series, Spider-Man: The Animated Series got the public&#39;s attention as an instant defining rendition of the character. The beloved series simply got so much about Spider-Man right without trying to &#34;fix&#34; the winning concept of the character with unnecessary changes. From the high production values to the deep storylines and Christopher Daniel Barnes voice acting performed as if his life was on the line, there&#39;s a reason that the 90s Spider-Man cartoon is so fondly remembered to this day.





 1  The Spectacular Spider-Man (2008) 
2 seasons
        

As good as the 90s cartoon is, the enjoyment of it today still has traces of irony resulting from its age. The Spectacular Spider-Man has no such weaknesses, with a striking art style that balanced Western animation with clear Anime influences, a la Avatar: The Last Airbender. Blending engaging but not soapy high-school drama with tremendous action scenes and some of the most lively versions of Spider-Man&#39;s rogues gallery around, this cartoon also comes with the single most relatable Peter Parker in animation to-date. It&#39;s no wonder that Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse included this version of Spider-Man, clearly recognizing the greatest of his animated shows.
