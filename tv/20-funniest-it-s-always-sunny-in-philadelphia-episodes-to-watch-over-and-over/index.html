<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny has arguably been one of the most hilarious shows on television for 17 years, but which episodes are the funniest?</p>
<p>With 16 seasons and counting, the most re-watchable It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes cement the show&rsquo;s lasting legacy. The Paddy&rsquo;s Pub Gang can always be counted on to get up to some wild mischief and continue to prove they are among the least likable characters on television. The collection of episodes numbers far over 100 at this point, and while there is no sign of slowing down, there are some episodes fans can always return to.</p>
<p>The episodes of It&rsquo;s Always Sunny that never seem to get old offer the big laughs that fans are always looking for from the show. They feature the most clever and exciting storylines from the series and make great use of the unforgettable ensemble It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has created. From the early favorites to the more recent episodes that prove the show still has it, the funniest Always Sunny episodes stand out.</p>
<pre><code>              How Old Is The Gang In It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia?   The main cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia are some of the most iconic sitcom characters of all time, and here's how old each one is.   
</code></pre>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder Gun Express&rdquo;
Season 7, Episode 11</p>
<p>It’s Always Sunny can have a lot of fun with outlandish concepts, but the show can also get big laughs from very relatable scenarios. “Thunder Gun Express” follows the Gang as they attempt to make it to a movie on time only to face one obstacle after another which results in one member of the Gang after another dropping out of their quest.</p>
<p>There is an excitement to the story as it is told in real-time with a ticking clock component. It is also another great example of how these so-called friends don’t care about each other as seen when somebody else gets left behind simply because the others cannot be bothered to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McPoyle vs. Ponderosa: The Trial Of The Century&rdquo;
Season 11, Episode 7</p>
<p>This episode directly ties into the episode “The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre” from season 8. The bloodbath that ensued in that episode led to the Gang taking part in a high-stakes court case. As fans can predict, seeing the Gang in court is a setup for some comedic gold.</p>
<p>The episode is a special one as it sees a lot of the show’s best recurring characters coming together, from the McPoyles to Bill Ponderosa to Uncle Jack. There is even the return of Guillermo del Toro as Pappy McPoyle, one of the most entertaining cameos in the show. But the real highlight that never gets old is seeing Charlie step into his wannabe lawyer role.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Goes To The Water Park&rdquo;
Season 12, Episode 2</p>
<p>It’s Always Sunny’s characters are so wild and entertaining at this point that the show can throw them into any new location and watch them have fun. As the title of this episode suggests, the Gang spends a hot day at the water park with mayhem ensuing. The result is Dennis finding a young protégé, Mac and Dee getting stuck in a water slide and Charlie and Frank using a shocking lie to get to the front of the line quicker. The location provides a fun and energetic tone that makes it a fun episode to get wrapped up in.</p>
<pre><code>              Every Season Of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Ranked   It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia has been remarkably consistent since day one, which makes finding the best season tough.   
</code></pre>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet Dee Has A Heart Attack&rdquo;
Season 4, Episode 10</p>
<p>This episode begins with Dee having a heart attack which doesn’t matter to the rest of the Gang. However, it does give everyone a wake-up call that they need to start looking out for their health. Mac and Charlie take a corporate job to get health care and Dennis and Dee focus on the lifestyle of healthy people rather than being healthy. Even people who don’t watch the show know the popular Pepe Silvia meme. However, fans will know that scene is just one of the highlights of one of the funniest Always Sunny episodes​​​​​​.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Very Sunny Christmas&rdquo;
Season 6, Episode 13</p>
<p>The best Christmas episodes on television are the kind of ones that fans want to revisit every holiday season. It’s Always Sunny’s R-rated Christmas episode manages to maintain the show’s edge while also providing some Yuletide comfort.</p>
<p>The episode finds the Gang getting into the holiday spirit in different ways with Dee and Dennis attempting to teach Frank a Christmas Carol-like lesson while Mac and Charlie are confronted with the dark truths of their childhood Christmases. Even watching this every Christmas, the scenes of Frank hiding in a coach and Charlie confronting a mall Santa never stops being funny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac Finds His Pride&rdquo;
Season 13, Episode 10</p>
<p>Mac&rsquo;s sexuality is a source of comedy in the series, showing the hypocrisy of the character spouting anti-gay rhetoric while hiding his confused sexual feelings. However, when he finally does come out, it allows for It&rsquo;s Always Sunny to do an experimental episode in which it attempts to go for something deeper along with the laughs.</p>
<p>The episode has the Gang pressuring Mac to participate in the Pride Parade while he is struggling with how to come out to his father. This leads up to a final scene unlike anything the show has done before that is engrossing, heartbreaking, and says so much without any dialogue at all. Frank&rsquo;s reaction at the end remains one of the most emotional moments in the series and shows It&rsquo;s Always Sunny had plenty of surprises even after so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Dines Out&rdquo;
Season 8, Episode 9</p>
<p>It is always fun to see how the Gang can turn anything into a hostile and childish battle. Another single-set episode, &ldquo;The Gang Dines Out&rdquo; finds Mac and Dennis going to a restaurant for a special dinner together, only to find Frank and Charlie at the same restaurant as well as Dee, who is trying to hide the fact that she is dining alone.</p>
<p>The episode is a hilarious display of the characters trying to one-up each other, the strange rules and customs they have within their group, and the way they can make everything all about them. The sustained tension of the story increases as the episode continues, which makes it one of the most engrossing of the entire series.</p>
<p>The D.E.N.N.I.S. System
Season 5, Episode 10</p>
<p>All the characters in the series have devolved in hilarious ways over the years, but perhaps the funniest is Dennis going from the confident lady&rsquo;s man of the group to a creepy predator who is far more pathetic than he lets on. The episode that started to explore him as the true villain of the group was &ldquo;The D.E.N.N.I.S. System.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dennis breaks down his horrific and manipulative methods for seducing women. Though such subject matter could be quite off-putting, part of the reason this is one of the funniest Always Sunny episodes is how pathetic it makes Dennis look. The show has never been shy about making these characters out to be terrible people, so long as it is fun to laugh at their miserable nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Solves The Gas Crisis&rdquo;
Season 4, Episode 2</p>
<p>Get-rich-quick schemes are a big part of the Gang&rsquo;s misadventures and &ldquo;The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis&rdquo; is one of their most memorable. Seeing the skyrocketing cost of gas, the Gang decides they are going to find a way to profit from it. Unfortunately, due to their immense ignorance, they don&rsquo;t know how to go about doing that.</p>
<p>It is so much fun watching the Gang bounce from one bad idea to another, from the disastrous attempt to get a loan from the bank to Charlie adopting a rich Texan persona to sell gas door-to-door. But perhaps the highlight of the episode is the Gang trying to figure out the group dynamic, which includes the obvious revelation of Charlie as the so-called &ldquo;wild card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Buys A Boat&rdquo;
Season 6, Episode 3</p>
<p>The Gang is always looking for a good time and buying a boat becomes the latest misguided attempt to force themselves into high society. The episode largely focuses on the Gang hanging out on the dock and preparing the boat for its first voyage with them all having different ideas about how to have fun with the new vessel.</p>
<p>The episode features one of the funniest exchanges in the entire series as Dennis lays out yet another creepy plan to attract women with the boat, and he explains the idea of &ldquo;The Implication,&rdquo; which is even enough to creep Mac out. There is also the hilarious visual of Dee learning some dance moves from an inflatable tube man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang&rsquo;s Still In Ireland&rdquo;
Season 15, Episode 6</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny typically features standalone episodes with only a few two-part stories throughout the series. However, season 15 tried something new with an extended storyline. The second half of the season sees the Gang travel to Ireland in several hilarious episodes. The episode &ldquo;The Gang&rsquo;s Still in Ireland&rdquo; sees each character having a laugh-out-loud moment, including Charlie meeting his father.</p>
<p>However, it is Dennis and Dee&rsquo;s subplot that is the funniest. When Dennis and Dee try to rent a castle, Dennis stifles his cough and Dee relishes his misery, then Dennis converses with the castle and threatens to chop off Dee&rsquo;s head. The episode features every member of the Gang in top form, and none of the main cast misses a beat, despite nearly two decades of playing their characters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Gets New Wheels&rdquo;
Season 13, Episode 5</p>
<p>Dennis &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in season 12 was a shock, but luckily it was short-lived with Glenn Howerton returning the following season, though in a limited capacity, before fully rejoining the show. With Dennis back, there also needed to be the return of his classic Range Rover which the Gang blew up following his departure.</p>
<p>The episode sees Dennis getting a new car, Frank retaking the test for his long-expired driver&rsquo;s license, Dee making new high-society friends, and Mac and Charlie revisiting their childhood by getting new bikes. With hilarious personality changes, potential murder, and an instantly iconic final scene of the Gang in the Range Rover with Rick Astley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up&rdquo; playing in the background, &ldquo;The Gang Gets New Wheels&rdquo; is one of the funniest Always Sunny episodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac &amp; Dennis Move To The Suburbs&rdquo;
Season 11, Episode 5</p>
<p>Season 11&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mac and Dennis Move to the Suburbs&rdquo; is one of the few Always Sunny episodes with one single plot, as the episode focuses on Mac and Dennis&rsquo; deteriorating mental states and relationship as they are enclosed together in a confined space. The two attempt to win a bet against the rest of the Gang that they can survive living in the suburbs, with disastrous results.</p>
<p>One of the most beloved aspects of the series is Dennis&rsquo; untethered rage, portrayed expertly by Glenn Howerton, and this episode features him at his best. From his anger at his nosy neighbor, Wally, to him screaming at Mac about random noises they can hear or his &ldquo;famous mac and cheese,&rdquo; this episode showcases Dennis at his most rage-filled, spawning several memorable memes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CharDee MacDennis: The Game Of Games&rdquo;
Season 7, Episode 7</p>
<p>In &ldquo;CharDee MacDennis: The Game of Games,&rdquo; Mac, Charlie, Dennis, and Dee decide to play a game they created to quash their boredom. Frank acts as the audience surrogate as they explain to him the rules of the highly complicated board game. The game sees the Gang being competitive with one another, as they are split into teams that see the reigning champions, Dennis and Dee, facing off against Mac, Charlie, and Frank. The episode features classic Always Sunny antics and insults, mostly targeted at Dee and Charlie.</p>
<pre><code>              Why Always Sunny's Original Dee Actress Was Replaced After The Pilot   It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is known for its charismatic main cast, but that was almost very different, as the original Dee was replaced.   
</code></pre>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Tries Desperately To Win An Award&rdquo;
Season 9, Episode 3</p>
<p>Always Sunny is no stranger to meta-commentary, and the most apparent example of this is &ldquo;The Gang Tries Desperately To Win An Award.&rdquo; The episode sees the Gang try their best to win the &lsquo;Best Bar Award&rsquo; as they replicate a nearby bar that has bright lights, cues for when to drink, and approachable bartenders.</p>
<p>The plot of the episode is undeniably a reference to the Always Sunny creators&rsquo; lack of Emmy awards, as despite receiving three nominations for Stunt Coordination, it has never been recognized for writing, acting, or direction. Ultimately, the end of the episode reveals the Gang and the creator&rsquo;s contentment with their lack of awards but passionate customers/fanbase. The hilarious meta-references make this one of the funniest Always Sunny episodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie Work&rdquo;
Season 10, Episode 4</p>
<p>As such a long-running series, It&rsquo;s Always Sunny is willing to get ambitious with their episodes. This particular episode shows how effective this willingness to try something new can be. The plot follows Charlie&rsquo;s desperate attempt to deceive the health inspector during her impromptu visit, while the rest of the Gang ensue in their scam, which Charlie also helps with.</p>
<p>The episode is made to look as if it is a one-take, as Charlie traverses different rooms within the bar, telling each member of the Gang exactly what to do to succeed in both of their schemes. The episode is a truly enjoyable watch, with Dennis and Mac&rsquo;s toxic relationship, Dee questioning everything, Frank painting a shirt, and Charlie succeeding in his plan. The imaginative nature of &ldquo;Charlie Work&rdquo; makes it stand out among It&rsquo;s Always Sunny episodes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dennis And Dee Go On Welfare&rdquo;
Season 2, Episode 3</p>
<p>While many argue that the series&rsquo; first season saw the creators working out the trajectory of the show, it is evident early in season 2 that the show became what it remains today. In &ldquo;Dennis and Dee Go On Welfare,&rdquo; Charlie and Mac begin spending all of Frank&rsquo;s money, while Dennis and Dee attempt to pursue their dreams and wind up addicted to drugs.</p>
<p>While the plot of the episode sounds dark, it is one of the funniest Always Sunny episodes. Not only did it spawn iconic moments in Dennis and Dee singing Biz Markie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just a Friend&rdquo; and Mac and Charlie feigning sympathy for their friends&rsquo; addiction, but it is also a perfect example of the show&rsquo;s ability to make dire situations so hilarious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nightman Cometh&rdquo;
Season 4, Episode 13</p>
<p>The season finale of Always Sunny, season 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Nightman Cometh,&rdquo; is perhaps the show&rsquo;s most famous episode. When Charlie decides to write and direct a musical (seemingly for the sake of it), he enlists the help of the Gang to perform in it, leading to disastrous results.</p>
<p>The funniest aspects of the episode come from the Gang&rsquo;s selfishness and decision to go against almost every note that Charlie gives them. From Dee&rsquo;s ridiculous improvised solo song to Frank&rsquo;s inability to pronounce the word &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; the entire cast is on top form. The success of the hilarious episode led to the cast performing a live version of the musical and has led to fans calling for an It&rsquo;s Always Sunny sequel to &ldquo;The Nightman Cometh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Hits The Road&rdquo;
Season 5, Episode 2</p>
<p>A classic, rare Always Sunny episode that features a single plot is &ldquo;The Gang Hits The Road.&rdquo; After Charlie reveals that he has never left Philadelphia, the Gang decides to go on a road trip to the Grand Canyon. They attempt to leave without telling Dee but wind up taking her car after an incident.</p>
<p>The episode is full of funny moments, including Dee drunkenly throwing a jar of urine out the window, which lands on Mac in the back seat, and Charlie eating a pear (in its entirety, including the stem and stickers) for the first time. The biggest laugh of the episode comes from Dennis and Charlie&rsquo;s decision to burn wicker chairs in the trailer to cook hot dogs, leading them to pass out instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gang Gets Analysed&rdquo;
Season 8, Episode 5</p>
<p>Deciding upon the funniest episode of such a long-running sitcom is no easy feat, but &ldquo;The Gang Gets Analysed&rdquo; is a perfect episode in the series. When Dee attends a therapy session, she reveals that the Gang argued at a dinner party about who should do the dishes, and she wants the therapist to decide.</p>
<p>In a series about a group of dysfunctional, selfish, and belligerent people, the plot of this episode is perhaps the best possible showcase of each character&rsquo;s psyche. Whether it be Dennis&rsquo; sociopathic tendencies, Mac&rsquo;s warped view of himself, Frank&rsquo;s arrogance, Charlie&rsquo;s stupidity, or Dee&rsquo;s desperation, this episode is hilarious, and a perfect summation of It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.</p>
