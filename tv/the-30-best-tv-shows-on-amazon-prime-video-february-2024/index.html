  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video is one of the fastest-growing streaming services in the market, offering incredible original shows such as The Boys and Fleabag.</p>
<p>Working out what show to watch on Amazon Prime Video can be a challenge, as Amazon&rsquo;s streaming platform boasts hundreds of great TV series. Whether subscribers are looking for a cerebral comedy like Fleabag or a riveting crime drama like Bosch there&rsquo;s always something cool to watch on Amazon Prime Video. The issue is an abundance of choice rather than a lack of it, which is why we&rsquo;ve put together a curated list of the best 30 Amazon Prime TV shows to watch right now to make an easy selection without sifting through the dozens of available titles.
Amazon Prime Video has carved out a niche both as an original content creator — especially thanks to hit shows like The Boys and Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power — and the host of multiple licensed prime-time and high-end TV shows like American Horror Story and Downton Abbey. However, the content on Amazon Prime Video also changes regularly, with many titles coming to the platform, or leaving it, daily. Fortunately, our list of the best shows to watch on Amazon Prime Video right now is updated regularly, ensuring our curated selection always reflects the currently available content.

<p>Best Comedy TV Shows On Amazon Prime Video
Fleabag (2016-2019)</p>
<p>Fleabag</p>
<p>Release Date    June 21, 2016     Cast    Phoebe Waller-Bridge , Sian Clifford , Andrew Scott , Brett Gelman     Seasons    2     Writers    Phoebe Waller-Bridge</p>
<p>Based on writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s acclaimed one-woman play of the same name, Fleabag became a viral sensation on release — and understandably so. A bitingly satirical comedy that isn&rsquo;t afraid to showcase raw emotion, Fleabag never shies away from tackling complicated, often dark subjects. While the first season deals with the fallout following the main character&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s suicide, the second offers a compelling meditation on religion and family. With its deliberately ambiguous and nuanced symbolism, Fleabag is a joy to decipher and rewards repeat viewing, and there are few better comedies available to watch on Amazon Prime Video right now.

Kevin Can F**k Himself (2021-2022)</p>
<p>Kevin Can F**k Himself</p>
<p>Release Date    June 13, 2021     Cast    Brian Howe , Alex Bonifer , Mary Hollis Inboden , Eric Petersen , Raymond Lee , Annie Murphy     Seasons    2</p>
<p>Following her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt&rsquo;s Creek, Annie Murphy starred in a much darker comedy with Kevin Can F**k Himself. The show delivers a clever satire of the tired housewife role seen in many multi-cam sitcoms, with Murphy playing a subversive version of the character who decides to fight back against her constrained life and her slob husband. Murphy shows a new side of her talents, mixing comedy with authentic intensity in a fascinating genre-bending series that ranks among the best comedy shows available right now on Amazon Prime Video.

<p>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</p>
<p>Release Date    March 17, 2017     Cast    Rachel Brosnahan , Kevin Pollak , Caroline Aaron , Jane Lynch , Marin Hinkle , Michael Zegen , Tony Shalhoub , Alex Borstein     Seasons    5</p>
<p>Loosely inspired by the life of Joan Rivers, Prime Video&rsquo;s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is a pleasant comedy-drama set in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s. Rachel Brosnahan plays the titular Miriam Maisel, a homemaker who discovers a talent for stand-up comedy after her husband unexpectedly leaves her. The show&rsquo;s stand-up scenes are consistently hilarious, yet Miriam&rsquo;s personal struggles give the show a grounded realism that&rsquo;s often incredibly emotional. Inspiring and uplifting, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel has been a roaring success for Amazon Prime Video and ranks as one of the best TV shows on the platform.

<p>Release Date    February 6, 2014     Cast    Jeffrey Tambor , Gaby Hoffmann , Jay Duplass , Amy Landecker , Judith Light , Kathryn Hahn     Seasons    5</p>
<p>Transparent is a funny and relatable portrayal of a dysfunctional family in changing times, as its characters seem to be too absorbed in their own worlds to realize one of them is ready to embrace her true gender identity. One of Amazon Prime Video&rsquo;s early TV show success stories, Transparent discussed important topics in a hilarious tone, realistically portraying what ignorance feels like inside a family home. Acclaimed throughout its run, Transparent still ranks among the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.

<p>The 30 Best Movies On Amazon Prime Right Now (February 2024)
In a vast landscape of streaming, Prime Video may very well have the best selection of movies around, and there are some great movies on the service.</p>
<p>Minx (2022-)</p>
<p>Minx</p>
<p>Release Date    March 17, 2022     Cast    Jake Johnson , Ophelia Lovibond , Michael Angarano , Jessica Lowe , Oscar Montoya , Lennon Parham , Idara Victor     Seasons    2     Writers    Ellen Rapoport</p>
<p>Raucous and hilarious in equal measure, Minx takes a sly look at the little-covered world of 70s erotic publishing. Joyce Prigger (Ophelia Lovibond) is a young feminist in Los Angeles, who teams up with a salacious publisher (Jake Johnson) to pioneer the first erotic magazine for women. Although the central story is certainly unique, Minx&rsquo;s real strength lies in the chemistry between its cast, especially Lovibond and Johnson. It&rsquo;s easily one of the funniest comedy TV shows on Amazon Prime Video right now, and season 2 picked up two Satellite Award nominations in 2023.

<p>Vikings adapts real-life locations and historical events into a brutally dramatic story that spans decades, and if you&rsquo;re looking for a historical drama to watch on Amazon Prime Video, it&rsquo;s the perfect choice for the uninitiated. Vikings starts with focusing on the legendary Ragnar Lothbrok, a ruthless (and real) Viking whose visionary goals push him away from his routine as a farmer to a life of adventure and conquest in a foreign land.

<p>Release Date    June 17, 2022     Cast    Lola Tung , Christopher Briney , Gavin Casalegno , Jackie Chung     Seasons    2</p>
<p>Based on the book trilogy written by celebrated author Jenny Han, the Amazon Prime Video show The Summer I Turned Pretty is a sentimental story about first love and first heartbreak. Just like the title suggests, the show conveys a precious summer feeling as the teenage protagonist, Belly, finds herself in an unusual love triangle with two brothers.
While many of its beats might come across as clichéd, the show&rsquo;s earnest emotion won over fans of the original books, as well as newcomers. The Summer I Turned Pretty is one of the best coming-of-age dramas available on Amazon Prime Video right now, and whether viewers are of a similar age to the intriguing characters or empathizing with them through the lens of nostalgia, it&rsquo;s definitely worth a watch.

<p>Downton Abbey</p>
<p>Release Date    September 13, 2019     Cast    Hugh Bonneville , Elizabeth McGovern , Michelle Dockery , Brendan Coyle     Seasons    6     Creator    Julian Fellowes</p>
<p>While the inner workings of an English estate in the early 1900s might sound like dry material, Downton Abbey managed to turn it into one of the most popular and riveting shows on television. The series follows the lives of a family of British aristocrats and the servants who work for them. The upstairs-downstairs narrative encompasses love, drama, and scandal, all while providing a cutting social commentary.
Downton Abbey boasts an impressive ensemble cast, and its success led to two spinoff movies. Downton Abbey stands out easily as one of the best period dramas available on Amazon Prime Video right now, although the platform boasts plenty of other options in the genre.

<p>Perception is everything in The Affair, a five-season twisty drama that kicks off when author Noah Solloway (Dominic West) and waitress Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson) cheat on their respective spouses, Helen Butler (Maura Tierney) and Cole Lockhart (Joshua Jackson) with each other, and their illicit relationship has a host of tumultuous consequences.
What sets The Affair apart from other infidelity dramas is its dramatic device of showing the same event through two characters&rsquo; perspectives. The show is an intense study of memory&rsquo;s relationship to fact, and it&rsquo;s anchored by the four tour de force performances of the show&rsquo;s leads that elevate it to being one among the most watchable shows on Amazon Prime Video.

<p>A complex parable on vigilantism and the death penalty, The Killing Vote is a critically acclaimed South Korean drama in the same mold as shows like Squid Game. Centering on a mysterious masked individual known only as Gaetal, the show imagines a society in which Gaetal is able to hold public votes on whether criminals should be put to death, murdering them if enough people agree.
The show is a nuanced exploration of what it really means to deliver justice told in such a way that asks genuinely difficult questions of both the characters and the audience. There are many great international shows on Amazon Prime Video, and subscribers looking to dive into the wealth of content available from outside the US can&rsquo;t pick many better starting points than The Killing Vote.

<p>In many ways, Bosch&rsquo;s hard-boiled detective feels like a relic of a bygone TV era, yet the show never fails to make the character less than compelling. Titus Welliver plays Harry Bosch, a Los Angeles police detective who works his cases with total commitment but sometimes plays by his own rules. The premise might sound derivative, but Bosch exhibits a style and storytelling skill that elevates it above lesser examples of the genre.

Tom Hiddleston stars as the titular night manager at a hotel in Cairo who accepts a mission to infiltrate the inner circle of a dangerous arms dealer (Hugh Laurie).

<p>Though Tom Cruise brought Jack Reacher to the big screen, many fans of the books by Lee Child prefer the more book-accurate take on the character in Reacher. Alan Ritchson plays the titular hobo, a former military police officer who gets wrapped up in a conspiracy in a small town.

<p>Across 6 seasons, The Expanse gained both a reputation as one of the best modern sci-fi shows and an intensely loyal following to match. Amazon&rsquo;s decision to cancel The Expanse before season 7 was controversial at the time, though every episode still remains on the platform and can be enjoyed as a complete story. Based on the novels by James S. A. Corey, this sci-fi show on Amazon Prime Video has won multiple awards and focuses on an ensemble range of characters embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens to wipe away the fragile interstellar peace holding humanity together.

<p>An animated superhero series that doesn&rsquo;t pull its punches, Invincible is as gnarly and blood-soaked as any live-action alternative. The story revolves around a young hero who tries to follow in the steps of his father, the world&rsquo;s most powerful superhero, unaware that he&rsquo;s a heartless mass murderer. Despite the changes Invincible season 1 makes from the comics, few stories in the genre tackle the possibility of mass destruction that every superhero brings along with them this well. The result is an exceptional animated Amazon Prime Video show with unforgettable combat scenes that frequently push boundaries of violence and taste.

<p>The first live-action spin-off of The Boys quickly gained a reputation as one of the best shows to watch on the platform in its own right, as 2023&rsquo;s Gen V is just as riveting as its parent show. While it also explores superhero satire, Gen V flips up the formula yet again by focusing on the students of Godolkin University — a loose parody of well-known comic book properties like the X-Men or movies like Sky High.
However, Gen V paints the idea of a school for superheroes as part of a dystopian corporate nightmare. Intrigue and M-Rated violence abound throughout Gen V, just like The Boys, but the spin-off adds in a healthy dash of college drama and comedy that makes it stand out on its own as one of the coolest shows currently available on Amazon Prime Video.

Good Omens (2019-)</p>
<p>Good Omens</p>
<p>Release Date    May 31, 2019     Cast    Frances McDormand , Sam Taylor Buck , Benedict Cumberbatch , Michael Sheen , Ilan Galkoff , David Tennant , Brian Cox , Adria Arjona     Seasons    2     Writers    Neil Gaiman , Terry Pratchett</p>
<p>Perfectly augmented by Michael Sheen and David Tennant&rsquo;s inimitable onscreen chemistry, Good Omens is a hugely successful adaptation of the Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett novel of the same name. Following an angel and a demon as they enjoy a relatively peaceful existence on Earth, the show slyly rewrites biblical history, introducing a rich new mythology to established stories.
The first season sees the pair attempt to thwart the apocalypse in order to preserve their comfortable lives, while season 2 continues the story post-COVID-19 lockdown. Hugely entertaining and extremely watchable, Good Omens is a triumph for Amazon Prime Video&rsquo;s original programming.

The Wheel Of Time (2021-present)</p>
<p>The Wheel of Time</p>
<p>Release Date    November 19, 2021     Cast    Barney Harris , Zoe Robins , Madeleine Madden , Marcus Rutherford , Daniel Henney , Rosamund Pike , Josha Stradowski , Kate Fleetwood , Priyanka Bose , Hammed Animashaun     Seasons    2     Writers    Rafe Judkins , Robert Jordan , Michael Clarkson , Paul Clarkson , Celine Song</p>
<p>An ambitious blend of world-building and spectacle, The Wheel of Time is a largely successful attempt to wrestle with Robert Jordan&rsquo;s sprawling and unwieldy source material. Following the journey of the &ldquo;chosen one,&rdquo; whose power can turn the whole kingdom against him and his friends, Amazon Prime Video&rsquo;s The Wheel of Time explores an inventive magic system and a fantastical setting. Given its intricate plot, the series is remarkably accessible and certainly counts as one of Amazon Prime Video&rsquo;s best fantasy TV shows.

<p>Best Sci-Fi Movies On Prime Video Right Now
Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the 15 best sci-fi movies available for Amazon Prime Video subscribers to stream right now, from classics to hidden cult gems.</p>
<p>The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power (2022-present)</p>
<p>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</p>
<p>Release Date    September 1, 2022     Cast    Morfydd Clark , Ismael Cruz Cordova , Charlie Vickers , Markella Kavenagh , Megan Richards , Sara Zwangobani , Daniel Weyman , Cynthia Addai-Robinson , Lenny Henry , Lloyd Owen , Nazanin Boniadi , Dylan Smith , Alex Tarrant , Tyroe Muhafidin , Robert Aramayo , Geoff Morrell , Thusitha Jayasundera , Maxine Cunliffe     Seasons    1</p>
<p>The success of the Lord of the Rings books and movie trilogy was enough to ensure that The Rings of Power found an audience, but few believed Amazon&rsquo;s billion-dollar production could re-imagine J. R. R. Tolkien&rsquo;s world in such an evocative way. Middle-earth looks visually stunning, and the show takes its time to introduce different cultures, creatures, and, of course, enemies, that put at stake the balance between good and evil. The Rings of Power takes place thousands of years before the events of Lord of the Rings, making it a great precursor to the original films.

American Gods (2017-2021)</p>
<p>American Gods</p>
<p>Release Date    April 30, 2017     Cast    Ricky Whittle , Peter Stormare , Gillian Anderson , Jonathan Tucker , Cloris Leachman , Ian McShane , Bruce Langley , Emily Browning , Yetide Badaki     Seasons    3</p>
<p>Neil Gaiman is behind many excellent fantasy adaptations, including Coraline, Good Omens, The Sandman, and the Starz Original American Gods continues that trend. Starring Ian McShane and Ricky Whittle, American Gods is another ambitious project based on the author&rsquo;s works, creating a mythology of its own by introducing actual gods who must adapt to the modern world through the eyes of Shadow, an ex-convict. A blend of centuries-old legend and modern storytelling, the series is a riveting and inventive drama.

The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon (2023-Present)</p>
<p>The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon</p>
<p>Release Date    October 1, 2023     Cast    Norman Reedus , Clemence Poesy , Adam Nagaitis , Eriq Ebouaney , Anne Charrier     Seasons    1</p>
<p>The Walking Dead franchise isn&rsquo;t going anywhere anytime soon, and with great spinoffs like The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, that&rsquo;s a good thing. The series sees the titular fan-favorite character wash ashore in France without a clue as to how he got there. From there, Daryl tries to make his way back home to America, and his journey is unsurprisingly fraught with danger. While Reedus is as reliably fantastic as ever, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon breathes new life into the franchise by setting it in an entirely new location.

American Horror Story (2011-present)</p>
<p>American Horror Story</p>
<p>Release Date    October 17, 2012     Cast    Denis O&rsquo;Hare , Emma Roberts , Dylan McDermott , Joseph Fiennes , Gabourey Sidibe , Taissa Farmiga , James Cromwell , Angela Bassett , Zachary Quinto , Sarah Paulson , Jamie Brewer , Evan Peters , Lizzie Brochere , Kathy Bates , Jessica Lange , Michael Chiklis , Connie Britton , Lily Rabe , Franches Conroy     Seasons    10</p>
<p>One of the most influential shows of the past 15 years, American Horror Story is a must-watch for every horror fan. The show follows an anthology style, and each season of American Horror Story focuses on a different threat and introduces a new set of characters. New roles are often filled by the same ensemble cast from season to season, exploring a wide range of horror tropes such as haunted houses, aliens, and freak shows. Catapulting stars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters to international fame, the show also established Ryan Murphy as the doyen of pop television.

Interview With The Vampire (2022-present)</p>
<p>Interview With the Vampire</p>
<p>Release Date    October 2, 2022     Cast    Jacob Anderson , Sam Reid , Eric Bogosian , Bailey Bass     Seasons    2</p>
<p>Anne Rice&rsquo;s book Interview with the Vampire has now inspired two great adaptations: the 1994 movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and the subsequent Amazon Prime Video horror TV show. Once again, the gothic horror series follows Louis de Pointe du Lac as he recounts the story of his life as a noble vampire and the burden of immortality. Both adaptations capture the sensual nature of Rice&rsquo;s storytelling, yet the TV show arguably feels less absurd than the original. While there is plenty of betrayal and intrigue in the narrative, what prevails in abundance is desire.

Yellowjackets (2021-Present)</p>
<p>Yellowjackets</p>
<p>Release Date    November 14, 2021     Cast    Juliette Lewis , Sophie Thatcher , Warren Kole , Jasmin Savoy Brown , Tawny Cypress , Steven Krueger , Christina Ricci , Ella Purnell , Sammi Hanratty , Sophie Nélisse , Melanie Lynskey     Seasons    2</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most surprising and exhilarating TV series in recent memory, Yellowjackets blends the tropes of a survival thriller with terrifying fantastical horror. The split narrative follows a high school soccer team across two time periods, one in which their plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and another set years later exploring the trauma of the survivors. The show&rsquo;s blend of horror and psychological drama makes it unique and more than justifies its status as one of the best TV shows on Amazon Prime Video.
