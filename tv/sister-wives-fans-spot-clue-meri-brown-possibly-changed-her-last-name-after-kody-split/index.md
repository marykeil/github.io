## Literature Review
Meri from Sister Wives announced her split with Kody Brown in January 2023. A Christmas ornament she&#39;s now posted seemingly reveals her new identity.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown could be the first ex-wife to drop Kody Brown&#39;s last name from her name, as per some fans who have spotted a major sign. Meri is a 52-year-old woman who had been together with Kody, 54, since 1990 when they first legally married. Kody’s polygamist family started as he had spiritual marriages to Janelle Brown and Christien Brown in 1993 and 1994 respectively. The family stayed together for almost 13 years until Robyn Brown entered the picture and he legally divorced Meri. Meri became entangled in an emotional affair in 2015 even though she was still spiritually married to Kody.




Meri and Kody’s relationship took a nosedive when the affair was exposed by the person who was a catfish and finally fell apart in January 2023, when Meri confirmed it on Instagram.


 

Meanwhile, Meri may have used her Instagram to reveal that she’s finally changed her name by sharing a photo of a Christmas ornament (as shared by Reddit user u/natalathea.) On one side the text on the postcard-like ornament read, “Merry Christmas” with text saying, “Please bring me pink &amp; white sparkly countertops with rounded edges. Oh, and a new BFF.&#34; It was signed It was signed &#34;Meri Caroline Davenport” and addressed to “Santa Clause” at the North Pole.

Another interesting thing about the post was Meri captioning the photo, “Favorite new ornament from my forever BFF! IYKYK” and tagging her friend Jenn Sullivan. Sister Wives fans such as justlurkingihope commented, “Meri Davenport is SUCH a good name!!! ‘Meri Brown’ is plain and meh.” Crazy_Newspaper4583 posted, “I hope Janelle changes her last name as well. There’s power in a name change.” Relevant_Current_870 wondered, “Maybe she got remarried and no one knows about it.” Interestingly, TheSun recently reported Meri’s romance rumors with a new man. Meri went on a festive weekend getaway with family and friends and was joined by a man named Blair Struble.

He is Meri’s friend and personal interior designer, as per the publication, and appeared in a series of selfies with Meri inside a holiday-themed cabin. They also petted some goats after stepping out and Meri explained, “What a fabulous weekend full of joy and magic! @blairmichael12 and his love of all things Christmas just makes the magic explode!” in her caption. The same friend had helped Meri transform her Utah-based bed and breakfast, Lizzie&#39;s Heritage Inn, for Halloween. Blair had helped make Meri’s vision for the Haunted House a reality. She’s shared snaps of her posing with Blair and a life-sized skeleton.




Meri received Kody’s support after the catfishing scandal, but he eventually turned on her. The couple even visited a therapist in Nevada to repair the relationship, but it reached a difficult point when their move from Las Vegas to Flagstaff made the situation worse. Kody did not consider himself married to Meri. Thankfully, Meri is slowly moving on and recovering from the years of damage the relationship did to her. Meri’s making little changes to herself to show she has changed, such as dyeing her hair an auburn color. However, if Meri has really changed her last name, it could be the biggest change the Sister Wives star has done yet.



Sister Wives: Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding airs January 7 and 14 at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
