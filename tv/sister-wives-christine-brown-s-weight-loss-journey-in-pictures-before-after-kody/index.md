## Literature Review
Christine Brown from Sister Wives has transformed her physical health after splitting from Kody Brown. Her old photos show her weight loss journey.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown has entirely transformed her physique since moving on from Kody Brown. The 51-year-old reality star was once very happy in her polygamous household. She loved Kody and enjoyed spending time with his three other wives, Robyn, Meri, and Janelle Brown. Unfortunately, the family dynamic changed when Kody began preferring Robyn Brown to everyone else. He stopped visiting his other wives, which led them to grow distant from him. Christine was Kody’s first wife to realize her self-worth. She discovered she wouldn’t be happy with him and left the marriage.




In 2021, Christine announced that she was divorcing Kody for good. She chose to remain outside the Brown family’s proximity and started her new life in Utah instead. Soon after moving away, Christine began focusing on herself, her kids, her health, and her future. She tried her hand at dating and fell in love with David Woolley, Christine&#39;s now-husband. In 2023, Christine reached various milestones with her new man. She celebrated Valentine’s Day with him, moved into a new home, got engaged, and married him.

 How Christine Brown Looked In 2020 

 




Christine lost herself and her health in her relationship with Kody. While she remained as beautiful as ever, she did gain weight due to the stress of her failing marriage and COVID-19. In June 2020, Christine shared a picture of herself sitting outdoors. She wore a cute yellow top and blue jeans but appeared unhappy. She captioned the post, “good to be alive.”

Christine shared a few other pictures of herself in the following months. She posted one photo in August 2020, wearing an orange jacket. The post showed Christine with a rounder face. She also wore hefty eyeglasses that made her look more mature. The Sister Wives star faced numerous challenges in her relationship with Kody. 2020 was very tough for her, as she had to see her marriage fall apart and make a decision. Therefore, it’s understandable why she gained weight during that time.

Christine has come a long way since parting ways with Kody. Not only has she become healthier and more fit, but she has recaptured her lost youthfulness. Since meeting her new husband, David, Christine has dropped a significant amount of weight. She has become more confident, allowing her to be one of the most inspirational reality TV stars. In November 2023, Christine took to her Instagram, showing off her toned body, and wrote that she has become one of “Variety’s Most Powerful Women on Reality TV.” 

Besides her physique, Christine has also changed her style. She has begun sporting new outfits and ditched her old style completely. Christine now wears colorful dresses, sweaters, and coats alongside a more voluminous wavy hairstyle. She has also been smiling a lot more, something she rarely did when she was with Kody. Christine&#39;s face has also slimmed down and now looks as young as she did over a decade ago. Her followers often compliment her weight-loss transformation and tell her she has aged backward. Christine looks like she’s in her early 40s despite being in her 50s. 




                  Sister Wives Season 19: Latest News, Cast, &amp; Everything We Know   Even though there are no sister wives in the Brown family anymore, reports suggest that the Sister Wives will return with a more dramatic season 19.     



 How Did Christine Lose Weight? 
         

Unlike Meri, who hasn’t talked much about her weight loss, Christine has been open about her weight-loss journey. The mom of six began working on herself in her last few months with Kody. However, it wasn’t until she moved away from him that she started aligning herself with numerous weight-loss brands and publicly advertising health supplements. Christine is known for her allegiance to a pink-colored health drink she holds in many of her pictures. On her weight loss page, she promotes it with her co-star friend, Janelle, The Secret To Selfcare.




Apart from the pink drink, Christine loves to show what else she has been taking to improve her gut health. In December 2023, the former Brown family matriarch posted a reel of herself holding a few new supplements. She implied that they had helped her in her incredible transformation and made her feel “healthy and happy!” Christine wrote, “experience the remarkable benefits and discover how much better you can feel.” While Sister Wives fans shouldn&#39;t blindly listen to any influencer, the health supplements have worked for Christine. She has shown results by visibly changing herself for the better.



 Christine Looks Different After Splitting From Kody 
         

Christine looks drastically different from a few years ago, and the credit for it goes to her new lifestyle. When she was part of the Brown family, she couldn’t grow due to Kody’s negativity. She was in a marriage where she didn’t feel joy or motivation. Fortunately, Christine found David just in time. She realized that monogamy is far more beneficial for her body and mind. Having a soulmate and thinking about building a happier future has helped the Sister Wives cast member be free to do whatever she wants.




Like Christine, Meri, and Janelle have also begun their weight-loss journeys since leaving the Brown family behind. All three ladies look more youthful than ever now that they&#39;ve kicked Kody to the curb. His authority was sucking the life out of them, causing his wives to put their happiness on the back burner. For seasons, viewers must’ve seen the Brown family patriarch doing all he could to ensure his satisfaction above everyone else. He used all four of his wives and still complained. Thankfully, the three Sister Wives realized they needed to focus on themselves and their health.



Sister Wives is now streaming on Discovery&#43;.
