# The Conners Season 6 Loses An Original Cast Member


## SUMMARY 



  The Conners season 6 will see the departure of original cast member Jayden Rey, who portrayed DJ&#39;s daughter Mary.   Rey only appeared in 5 episodes in The Conners season 5, perhaps suggesting her exit won&#39;t be a significant event for the series.   Mary&#39;s exit follows the departure of both her parents, DJ (Michael Fishman) and Geena (Maya Lynne Robinson).

## Literature Review
Ahead of the much-delayed premiere of The Conners season 6, the hit ABC family comedy is confirmed to lose another original cast member.




The Conners season 6 is losing another original cast member ahead of its upcoming premiere. Roseanne and Dan&#39;s extended family has seen its fair share of losses and gains in the last few years. Perhaps most prominently, Michael Fishman departed the series after season 4, even though he had played DJ Conner since the original show, Roseanne. The Conners will be returning for season 6 in February, a delayed start due to the writers and actors strikes of 2023. Now, the titular clan is losing another important member yet again.




Per TVLine, Jayden Rey, who plays DJ’s daughter Mary, will not be returning as a series regular in The Conners season 6. No official explanation has been given for her departure from the Roseanne spin-off. Rey&#39;s exit marks the end of DJ&#39;s family having a presence on the series, as his wife and Mary&#39;s mother, Geena (Maya Lynne Robinson), left the show after season 1.


 How Mary&#39;s Exit Impacts The Conners Season 6 
          

It&#39;s unclear if The Conners season 6 will even devote time to explaining Mary&#39;s absence moving forward, considering how the show handled the departure of Fishman&#39;s DJ. This is especially likely given season 6&#39;s shortened episode count. It&#39;s worth noting that Mary lives with The Conners&#39; titular family half of the time, while she spends her other days with her maternal grandmother. Despite this, she has barely factored into any of the recent storylines. In fact, Rey appeared in just five of The Conners&#39; 22 season 5 episodes.




Because of that, it does not seem as though The Conners will struggle to adjust to her absence. That being said, Mary&#39;s departure further slims the chance of seeing DJ back on The Conners again. Having Mary live with DJ&#39;s father Dan, albeit only part-time, maintains his ties to Lanford. Without that, there&#39;s really no reason for him to move back. He could return when Bev passes away, but his reunion with his family will be clouded by the grief over her demise.

                  The Conners Season 6’s Most Important Plot Proves Why It Needs To End Already   The Conners only has one compelling arc left to tackle in season 6, which is further proof that it&#39;s time that the Roseanne spin-off finally ends.     

Some might say that ABC wasted DJ, Geena, and Mary on The Conners. Rey&#39;s departure, assuming it truly comes with minimal fanfare, indicates that the Roseanne spin-off has no plans to make amends for that. Moreover, it also suggests that Roseanne and Dan&#39;s three kids will never be reunited on screen again, though it&#39;s hard to truly say what the future holds.
