## Literature Review
Real Housewives of Beverly Hills stars Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump had a seemingly unbreakable bond, but they became enemies over the years.




When The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills began its first season in 2010, Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump developed a friendship no one thought would ever crumble, but they began feuding over the years.

However, the bandaid Kyle slapped on the cracks friendship started to fall amid the infamous &#34;Puppygate&#34; storyline during RHOBH season 9. Since then, the two have become real enemies.




Both Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump joined RHOBH for its very first season. They were close friends before appearing on the show, and their friendship became stronger as the series progressed. Kyle always had Lisa&#39;s back, even when she felt that she was wrong, but Lisa never seemingly reciprocated her loyalty back to Kyle. The friendship always seemed one-sided, ultimately becoming the demise of their close bond.


 The RHOBH Season 2 Fight Explained 
          

During the RHOBH season 2 reunion in 2011, Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump&#39;s friendship faced its first major falling out. The mother of four called the restauranteur &#34;calculated&#34; and compared being in a friendship with her to &#34;playing chess with Bobby Fischer.&#34; Lisa was hurt by Kyle&#39;s comparison, leading Lisa to distance herself from Kyle in the following season.






 Kyle And Lisa&#39;s RHOBH Feud Was Reignited 
          

Though Kyle and Lisa tried to reconcile after the Bobby Fischer comparison on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 4, their feud was reignited. Brandi Granville claimed that Lisa planned to bring the tabloid stories containing cheating rumors about Kyle&#39;s husband, Mauricio, on the cast trip to Puerto Rico. Kyle was disappointed that Lisa would engage in conversations about those infidelity rumors on camera, even though Kyle and Mauricio denied them. Lisa also denied that she wanted to bring the tabloids on the trip.



 Drama With Yolanda Hadid Impacted Lisa And Kyle&#39;s Relationship 
Their friendship took another major hit during RHOBH season 6 after Lisa Rinna and Eileen Davidson claimed that Vanderpump had tried to drag Kyle into the Yolanda controversy. Rinna suggested that Yolanda was lying about her Lyme disease diagnosis and implied she suffered from Munchausen syndrome. Even though Kyle had nothing to do with the gossip, Rinna and Eileen revealed that Vanderpump had been trying to drag Kyle into it. Kyle was &#34;annoyed&#34; that she was pulled into the drama, but she managed to get over it fairly quickly.






 Puppygate Ended Lisa And Kyle&#39;s Friendship 
          

The scandal that ended the seemingly unbreakable friendship between Lisa Vanderpump and Kyle Richards is the infamous &#34;Puppygate&#34; storyline. It began when Dorit Kemsley adopted a dog from Lisa&#39;s rescue, Vanderpump Dogs, and rumors emerged that she gave the dog to a kill shelter. Lisa reportedly planned to make Dorit look bad by involving Teddi Mellencamp. Tabloids began covering the situation, with Dorit believing that Lisa leaked information to the press. Kyle then confronted her about it, which led to a huge blowout fight with her husband, Ken, at LVP&#39;s home. He kicked her out of her home, with Lisa never to appear alongside the women again.

Kyle continues to star in current RHOBH season 13, but Lisa left the Bravo series after nine seasons. While her relationship with Kyle wasn&#39;t the only reason, the aftermath of &#34;Puppygate&#34; and other scandals certainly didn&#39;t help. The pair will likely never be friends again, but their drama on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills before Lisa left the show was fascinating to watch.






The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
