Summary

  Marvel Studios considers Netflix&#39;s Daredevil series to be fully part of the MCU&#39;s central timeline, according to executive producer Brad Winderbaum.   Having Daredevil as part of the main continuity benefits the MCU, allowing for pay-offs of powerful stories and honoring other since-finished shows like Agents of SHIELD, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Runaways.   There are rumors that Daredevil&#39;s role in Echo could establish the Marvel-Netflix shows&#39; place in the MCU and potentially set up future storylines involving other Netflix characters.  





As Matt Murdock gets ready to return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a Marvel Studios producer for the Echo TV show addresses how Netflix&#39;s Daredevil series is canon to the franchise. While there will be few Marvel movies in 2024, there will be a lot of MCU shows coming to Disney&#43;. Set to be the first series under the Marvel Spotlight banner, Echo is arriving this month, continuing the story of Maya Lopez after the events of Hawkeye.




Leading up to the launch of the Echo TV show next week, Screen Rant recently interviewed MCU executive producer Brad Winderbaum about the latest Disney&#43; adventure. With Daredevil set to have a role in the series, Winderbaum was asked in regards to how Cox&#39;s Netflix show may or may not factor into Echo when it comes to being canon to the Sacred Timeline. As far as Winderbaum is concerned, he considers Netflix&#39;s Daredevil fully part of the MCU&#39;s central timeline, sharing the following:


Brad Winderbaum: I can say that up until this point, we&#39;ve been a little bit cagey about what&#39;s Sacred Timeline, what&#39;s not Sacred Timeline. That was born of, frankly, a period at the studio where we were like, &#34;We have to stick the landing with the vendors.&#34; It was another part of the company developing the Netflix stuff. We were aware of what they were doing, they were aware of what we were doing, but there was a lot to balance anyway.
But now that some time has passed; now that we see actually how well integrated the stories are, I think that I personally, Brad Winderbaum, would be confident in saying it is part of the Sacred Timeline.





                  Echo: Cast, Story Details, &amp; Everything We Know   Disney Plus has started development on Echo, an MCU spin-off of the Hawkeye series, featuring Native American martial artist Maya Lopez.    


 How Netflix&#39;s Daredevil Show Being MCU Canon Could Affect The Timeline 
         

While it is unclear why Marvel Studios haven&#39;t made a clear statement on Daredevil&#39;s MCU canon status - suggesting there may be unseen factors at play - it currently appears only beneficial for the MCU to have Daredevil as part of its main continuity. The original Marvel Television era - which featured shows on ABC, Netflix, Hulu, and Freeform - was a way to flesh out the MCU without necessarily having to follow every single movie that had released at the time, or was otherwise about to release. With Marvel Studios currently focusing on retooling the way the MCU has recently approached TV shows, following a mixed reception for some Phase 4 projects, linking the franchise closer to the well-received Daredevil can help pave the path forward.




Daredevil being part of the MCU main timeline canon also allows the powerful stories that the writers told over three seasons and on The Defenders to still be paid off. If Daredevil gets that chance, it could also mean that other since-finished shows can be honored in the franchise, whether it be series like Agents of SHIELD, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, or Runaways. This would both tie the different eras of Marvel&#39;s shows together, and provide a way to expand the universe once more without having to expend significant time on exposition, as the backdrop for plenty of figures and stories is already in place with these series.



Cox will be headlining his own MCU TV show again with Daredevil: Born Again, which is currently being re-developed.




Given that there are rumors that Daredevil is looking for an old ally throughout his time on Echo, it wouldn&#39;t be shocking if this becomes another way to establish the Marvel-Netflix shows&#39; actual place in the MCU. That would also be an opportunity to briefly setup what has gone on with other Netflix characters since their series ended. It&#39;s also possible that Daredevil: Born Again will further expand on the canon situation between the Disney&#43; and Netflix shows.




Marvel Studios&#39; Echo will release all five episodes on Tuesday, January 9 on Disney&#43; and Hulu.
