<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives season 18 came to an end with the last installment of Sister Wives: One On One, where Kody &amp; Christine continued to argue about the past.</p>
<p>Sister Wives season 18 episode 18 was the final piece of the Tell-All interviews, and finally gave the Brown family some closure while dropping huge bombshells about the state of the family. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Kody Brown’s relationships with his wives came to a halt after his divorce from Christine Brown changed everything. Kody’s defenses were high when he came back into his relationships with Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, and Robyn Brown. He was constantly angry and easily irritable, something that made it markedly difficult for his wives to connect with him. From this irritability, the issues in Kody’s marriages multiplied and made them impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>After Christine left during Sister Wives season 17, Kody’s other relationships began to suffer. His marriage to Meri, which had lasted over 30 years, had been on the rocks for nearly a decade and she eventually came to realize she was the only one trying to improve it. Janelle and Kody’s long-standing issues went from a slow fizzle to scorched earth after their massive fight on Sister Wives season 18 episode 3, which ultimately ended their relationship. While Kody and Robyn remain together, the final piece of Sister Wives: One On One revealed their relationship could be in trouble, too.</p>

<p>Meri &amp; Janelle Shared They Approve of Christine’s New Love
Both Women Have Met David Woolley</p>
<p>Meri and Janelle shared that they’ve both met David Woolley, the love of Christine’s life, and revealed whether or not they’re approval. While Janelle’s opinion clearly means more to Christine than Meri’s, both women were happy to weigh in on David and share their thoughts. Meri, who met David briefly, shared that she really liked him upon their first interaction, and she believes he and Christine are a great fit. Janelle explained that she believes David’s a great guy, and he fully has her stamp of approval when it comes to marrying her friend and sister wife. Both Janelle and Meri were thrilled for Christine to be happy with David.</p>
<p>Kody Shared He &amp; Robyn Have Also Met David
He Shared Wishes Christine The Best</p>
<p>After Janelle and Meri gave their blessing to Christine to move forward, Kody spoke out about meeting his ex-wife’s new love for the first time. While Kody was trying to be diplomatic in the way he spoke about Christine’s new man, it was clear there was some anger in the way he was feeling about Christine’s new relationship. While Kody was open that he and Robyn both liked David upon meeting for the first time, he was hopeful that Christine was able to let their relationship go for David’s sake. After talking about his feelings on David, Kody wished his ex and her fiancé the best.</p>
<p>Christine Confirmed She’s Letting Herself Be A Villain
She’s Channeling Her Inner Cruella</p>
<p>Christine shared that though she knows some will take it the wrong way, she’s happily in her villain era when it comes to her interactions with Kody. While she isn’t being intentionally cruel to him, she explained that she’s always found characters with villain energy more interesting because they share their inner-most thoughts and conflicts. Christine explained that she’s happily sharing what she thinks and how she feels with Kody despite the fact that he might not like it. In the past, Christine would water down her feelings for Kody to keep him happy, but as his ex-wife, she’s glad she no longer has to filter herself for his benefit.</p>
<p>Kody Blames Himself For Ruining “The Big Picture”
He Says It’s His Fault For Marrying Someone He Never Loved</p>
<p>After being asked if he blamed Christine for ruining “the big picture” of his life, Kody shared that he doesn’t blame his ex-wife, but himself. Though the take seems somewhat evolved coming from Kody, his explanation made it clear he’s still the same old Kody. Sharing that he blames himself, Kody expounded on his thoughts, saying that it’s his own fault for marrying someone he never loved in the first place. Kody feels that by marrying Christine, and likely Meri, he ruined the “big picture” he had planned for his life, because their marriages were always going to net negative without any romantic love.</p>
<p>Christine &amp; Kody Disagree On Robyn’s Thoughts On Plural Marriage
She Thinks Robyn Doesn’t Want It While He Does</p>
<p>When asked about whether or not Robyn would be interested in living in monogamy with Kody, Christine and Kody had very different views on her thoughts surrounding their lifestyle. While Christine felt that Robyn absolutely doesn’t want plural marriage moving forward, Kody is certain that his wife does. Robyn, who’s flipped and flopped about how she feels regarding the practice in recent months, has said in the past that she married into the Brown family for plural marriage. Christine explained that Robyn been living in monogamy for years, while Kody disagreed vehemently, saying that Christine doesn’t know Robyn well enough to make that call.</p>
<p>Robyn Says She Doesn’t Know How Monogamy Works
She Feels Disrespectful Being Happy With Kody Alone</p>
<p>In one of her rare moments on Sister Wives season 18 episode 18, Robyn broke down in tears when discussing the idea of being monogamous with Kody. She explained that she doesn’t know how monogamy works after living in plural marriage with Kody for the last decade, and she definitely isn’t sure on how to approach it. While Robyn was crying, she shared that she feels she needs to be released from the plural marriage she’s been in by each of Kody’s ex-wives, so that they can give her permission to be in a relationship with Kody without them. Robyn feels disrespectful being happy with Kody on her own.</p>
<p>Christine Introduced David To The Sister Wives Audience
They Gushed About Each Other To Host Suki</p>
<p>David made his first appearance on the series during Sister Wives: One On One, sitting down with Christine and Tell-All host Sukanya Krishnan to share how he’s been feeling about joining into the large, estranged Brown family. After sharing just how they met and fell in love, David and Christine began to talk in-depth about their relationship and how it relates to Kody, Robyn, and the rest of the Brown family. Making it clear their love is strong, David and Christine both spoke openly and honestly about how much they care for one another and how supportive they’ve been for one another throughout their relationship.</p>
<p>Kody Felt Christine Was Pitting Their Kids Against Him
He Felt Mykelti Sided With Christine Against Her Will</p>
<p>After watching a clip of Christine sharing that she never wanted to be in a marriage where her kids knew that her husband was unattracted to her, Kody and Christine had very different reactions. While Christine’s instinct was to talk about how David never made her feel unattractive in the way Kody has in the past, her exes thoughts were a bit harsher. Kody shared that what he took from the moment was more about the fact that Christine seemed to be pitting his kids against him by making them feel they had to placate her. It was clear that host Suki didn’t agree with Kody’s take.</p>
<p>Christine Is “Machiavellian” According To Kody
David Doesn’t Agree With Kody’s Criticism</p>
<p>Kody has referred to Christine as “Machiavellian” in the past, but during Sister Wives: One On One he explained that she’s been manipulative and deceitful in ways that he’s never seen before. He shared that he feels Christine is Machiavellian in the way she’s painting Kody publicly and to their children. Kody shared that he feels Christine has to make him look like a bad person in order to make David feel better about their relationship. David, after hearing about Kody’s feelings surrounding his and Christine’s relationships, shared that he didn’t feel Kody’s opinion was warranted.</p>
<p>Janelle Shared She Doesn’t See Herself Reconciling With Kody
She Hopes They Can Be Friends In The Future</p>
<p>During her final moments on Sister Wives season 18, Janelle shared that she doesn’t ever see herself reconciling with Kody in a romantic sense. While Kody and Janelle’s separation has been somewhat blurrier than his other divorces, during Sister Wives: One On One she shared that she’s not interested in getting back together with Kody. She did share that while she’s open to love in the future, she’d love to eventually get to a point where she can be friends with Kody, who she spent many years married to. Janelle was able to separate her romantic relationship with what she hopes for the future.</p>
