# Young Sheldon Season 7 Image Shows First Look At Grown-Up Sheldon


## SUMMARY 



  Young Sheldon season 7 needs to give Sheldon a proper transition from Texas to California, including celebrating his graduation and acknowledging his first mentor, Dr. Sturgis.   The writers must tie up all the remaining loose ends in the storyline to ensure a satisfying conclusion for the Coopers, prioritizing Sheldon&#39;s character development.   It remains to be seen whether the show will focus on preserving The Big Bang Theory canon or the prequel&#39;s own storytelling, which may affect how much time is devoted to Sheldon versus other characters.

## Literature Review
Young Sheldon season 7 set image debuts the first look at Iain Armitage&#39;s significantly grown-up Sheldon for TBBT prequel&#39;s final year. 




The latest Young Sheldon season 7 behind-the-scenes image reveals the first proper look at an older Sheldon. Sheldon and the rest of the Coopers are entering their final year on the small screen, as the boy genius’ time in Medford, Texas is slowly coming to an end. Despite a shortened Young Sheldon season 7, there are still plenty of storylines that need to be wrapped up before The Big Bang Theory prequel ends, but it will be a big year for Sheldon.




In Iain Armitage’s latest social media post, he shows the first proper look at a grown Sheldon in his pajamas during a break from filming. 


 

Work on Young Sheldon season 7 has been quietly progressing for quite a while now. So while CBS has yet to release any official marketing for the show’s upcoming year, content from the set offers a sneak peek at what the year would look like.


 Everything That Needs To Happen To Sheldon In Young Sheldon Season 7 
          

It&#39;s no secret that Young Sheldon has struggled to develop a compelling story for Sheldon for a few seasons now. Instead, the prequel has been more focused on other members of the Cooper family, as they deal with their respective issues. It doesn&#39;t help that Sheldon spends the majority of his time at East Texas Tech, effectively isolating him from the rest of his family.




One of the best ways to resolve his story is to ensure that Sheldon gets a proper transition from his time in the prequel to his new life in Pasadena, California. His graduation at East Texas Tech should be a big cause of celebration, allowing him to properly thank Dr. Sturgis, especially since the eccentric genius was ignored throughout The Big Bang Theory even though he was Sheldon&#39;s first true mentor. Young Sheldon also needs to stick with all the big storylines left that Sheldon revealed to his friends in The Big Bang Theory, including George&#39;s death.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Just Needs This 1 Returning Character To Fix Georgie &amp; Mandy&#39;s Story   Before Georgie and Mandy&#39;s planned wedding, Young Sheldon season 7 needs to bring back one important character from the past to properly wrap it up.     

It&#39;s curious how Young Sheldon will be able to tie all the remaining narrative loose ends to ensure a satisfying send-off to the Coopers. Assuming that the writers are more inclined to preserve The Big Bang Theory canon rather than the prequel&#39;s own storytelling, then Sheldon needs to be their top priority.






Young Sheldon season 7 premieres on February 15.
