Netflix’s Dubai Bling season 2 is out and is just as dramatic as before. The reality TV series first premiered in October 2022 and offered viewers an up-close and personal look at Dubai residents and their extravagant lifestyles. The show’s last season was all about the journeys of nine main cast members, including names like Ebraheem Al Samadi, Safa Siddiqui, Zeina Khoury, and Kris Fade. It showed the cast making millions of dollars worth of deals, navigating personal relationships, and enjoying their wealth. The show earned the label of a Middle Eastern alternative to The Real Housewives.

Dubai Bling season 1 started with real estate expert Zeina Khoury confronting influencer Farhana Bodi. The season also showed Loujain &#34;LJ&#34; Adada going on a blind date and Safa discussing her living situation with her husband. The cast members faced numerous ups and downs throughout the season as it progressed. Fortunately, their journeys eventually end on a decent note. The final episode showed Farhana proving her worth and LJ talking to her mother. It also focused on Kris Fade and Brianna Ramirez’s big day and other announcements. Dubai Bling season 1 got many positive reviews, and it seems season 2 will as well.
