## Literature Review
Steve kept his life with his girlfriend private in Million Dollar Listing New York. Here&#39;s some info about Luiza.




Steve Gold from Million Dollar Listing New York surprised fans when he revealed he has a family off-screen, and here&#39;s information to know about Luiza Gawlowska. Being in a relationship with a high-profile broker on reality television, Steve&#39;s girlfriend, Luiza, has chosen only to make parts of her personal life available to the public. From her family with Steve to her life outside of the MDLNY star, here are some updates on Luisa.




Popular cast member Steve gained notoriety on Million Dollar Listing New York. A successful luxury real estate broker at The Corcoran Group, Steve has earned a reputation for his charming personality, sharp negotiating skills, and ability to close high-end deals. Born and raised in Stamford, Connecticut, Steve initially aspired to work in the finance industry but ultimately found his calling in real estate. However, his girlfriend, Luiza, eschews the spotlight.


 Luiza Gawlowska&#39;s Background Explained 

 

Luiza was born on October 16, 1992, and raised in London, England. At 31 years old, Luiza is eight years younger than her boyfriend Steve, who turned 39 on March 1, 2023. Although Luiza lived in London when she met Steve, the mother is originally from Poland. Luiza lived in London until around 2018 when she first met Steve at a London airport. Although Steve&#39;s work revolves around Manhattan, the real estate agent&#39;s relationship with Luiza began in London. The couple soon embarked on an international love tour, stopping in Ibiza and Monte Carlo. However, since starting her life with the famous real estate broker, Luiza has made New York City her home.






 Luiza And Steve Have A Daughter 

 

Luiza and Steve opted to maintain a low-key public life despite Steve&#39;s career in reality television and luxury real estate. This resulted in fans not knowing about Luiza&#39;s role in Steve&#39;s romantic life until the birth of their baby. Luiza gave birth to her daughter, Rose Gold, on June 6, 2019. Rose is named after Steve&#39;s great-grandmother from Russia, who was also named Rose. Luiza and Steve decided to go public with their relationship because they wanted to share the joy their burgeoning family brought to the young couple. Unfortunately, the transition into the public eye made Luiza vulnerable to criticism for her fast-moving relationship with Steve.



 Luiza Is Active On Instagram 

 




Although trolls have occasionally abused the platform, Luiza actively shares new insight into her life on Instagram. Despite only sharing a few dozen posts, Luiza&#39;s Instagram lets fans in on her interests. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of Luiza&#39;s posts are of her family. From pictures of Rose as a newborn to photos of Luiza and Steve out on date night, Luiza&#39;s Instagram is a sentimental homage to her most significant interest: her family.

Although she embarked on a long-term relationship with a prominent reality star and real estate broker, Luiza is a relatively private person. Despite the hiccup of online trolling, Luiza has effectively adjusted to public life since the birth of her daughter, Rose. Hopefully, fans of Luiza and Steve will earn the opportunity to learn more about the enigmatic young mother on Million Dollar Listing New York.
