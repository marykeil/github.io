## Literature Review
Which pivotal Star Wars characters might be studied in the next season of Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi? Which stories will we see unfold?




Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi is coming back for season 2 – so what can be expected of the next installment? The first season of Tales of the Jedi premiered in October 2022, releasing six new shorts that focused on two familiar Jedi: Ahsoka Tano and Count Dooku. Three episodes explored Ahsoka’s life before she joined the Jedi Order, her training with her Master, Anakin Skywalker, and her life just after the horrific events of Order 66, while the other half of the first season dove into Count Dooku’s life while he was still part of the Jedi Order, including his relationship with Qui-Gon Jinn and his disillusionment with the Jedi’s way of life.




Though the first season was short, it was undeniably impactful – most of these stories hadn’t been explored before, giving audiences better insight into some of Star Wars’ most pivotal characters. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, Tales of the Jedi creator and Lucasfilm’s Chief Creative Officer Dave Filoni revealed that season 2 was in production – but who might the show focus on this time around, and when will it be released?


 Lucasfilm Has Completed Work On Star Wars: Tales Of The Jedi Season 2 
          

Since Lucasfilm revealed its entire 2024 Star Wars slate in December 2023, it’s been speculated that Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi season 2 has completed production. As an animated series, it was one of the few major productions less affected by the Hollywood strikes that took place in the second half of 2023, and as such, Lucasfilm’s animation department could continue to work on the second series without any major delays. Unfortunately, there is no trailer yet.






 Tales Of The Jedi Season 2 Will Likely Follow The Same Anthology Format 
         

Little has been revealed about Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi season 2 other than the fact that it was being produced, as well as its upcoming release window. The series is expected to follow the same anthology format, however, and there is currently no reason to believe that there will be more than six episodes. If that is the case, two Jedi will likely be the focus of the series once again, with three episodes dedicated to each of them. Who those Jedi will be is still unknown.

                  Star Wars: Every Jedi In Tales Of The Jedi (&amp; What Happened To Them), Explained   Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi features many notable Jedi, from Ahsoka Tano to Jocasta Nu. Fans may not know what eventually happens to each one.    

Some names that have been bandied about include Kylo Ren, Barriss Offee, Kanan Jarrus, Syfo Dias, Quinlan Vos, and Pong Krell. Most of these choices would fit with the themes from the first season – Jedi who lost their way, turned to the dark side, or had to become independent after the Empire rose to power. Other Jedi that could potentially be the focus of Tales of the Jedi season 2 include Yoda, Mace Windu, Tera Sinube, or Kit Fisto. Most of these Jedi, apart from Kylo Ren, were active just before or during the Clone Wars, which was the era that the first season of Tales of the Jedi focused on as well.






 Star Wars: Tales Of The Jedi Season 2 Will Release In 2024 
          

Lucasfilm recently confirmed that Tales of the Jedi season 2 is set to release in 2024, though they have yet to reveal an exact premiere date. Three other Star Wars shows are set to be released in 2024 as well, including The Acolyte, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, and season 3 of Star Wars: The Bad Batch. As there’s no indication that any of these stories share an ongoing narrative (though there’s always a chance they might reference other storylines), it’s hard to predict when exactly Tales of the Jedi season 2 might release. Lucasfilm might want to split up its animated offerings, and if it’s true that Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi season 2 has already finished production, audiences could be seeing it sooner rather than later.
