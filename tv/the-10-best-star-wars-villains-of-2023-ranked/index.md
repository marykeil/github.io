 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.







 10  Bichan 
Star Wars: Visions - Season 2, Episode 5 &#34;Journey to the Dark Head&#34;
        

Star Wars: Visions season 2 introduced several new Sith Lords through impressive animation styles, and Bichan was the most memorable. He was a master lightsaber duelist whose hilt had an attached whip, making his weapon twice as deadly as he caught his opponents off guard. Bichan was ruthless, but he also took joy in hurting others, killing eight Jedi masters but sparing Jedi Padawan Toul after seeing his anger. Yun Yong Sik and Daniel Dae Kim elevated the character even more through their exceptional voice acting in the Korean and English dubs, respectively.
Star Wars: Visions is non-canon. 



 9  Shin Hati 
Ahsoka


 







Most of the lightsaber action in Ahsoka focused on Shin Hati, a dark apprentice who immediately made a lasting impression in the show&#39;s first few minutes. Her ferocity in combat made viewers fear for the other characters, but the season gradually revealed more of Shin&#39;s character that differentiated her from her master. Shin was young, reckless, and power-hungry, yet she wasn&#39;t afraid to question her master&#39;s plans or remain skeptical of those they associated with. Ahsoka ends with Shin setting off on her own path, opening more opportunities for the character and hinting at her possible redemption.


 8  Dagan Gera 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor
        

A former Jedi from the High Republic Era, Dagan Gera was sealed in a bacta tank after betraying the Jedi Order, remaining in stasis for hundreds of years. He woke up during the reign of the Empire and learned that the Jedi were gone, using this as an opportunity to build a new army and cleanse that galaxy through fire. Gera&#39;s obsession with the planet Tanalorr drove him to madness and blinded him to reason, making him a dangerous and highly skilled opponent, even with one arm missing.


 7  The Thirteenth Sister 
Star Wars: Inquisitor - Rise of the Red Blade
        

Iskat Akaris, the Thirteenth Sister, received her backstory in 2023, resulting in one of the most gripping Star Wars books in recent years. Her character is highly relatable yet utterly terrifying, transforming from a Jedi Padawan who never felt like she belonged to a willing member of the Inquisitorius who thoroughly enjoyed killing. Despite her cruelty after turning to the dark side, the Thirteenth Sister remains sympathetic, making her ultimate lack of redemption more tragic. She may be an unreliable narrator at times, but the Thirteenth Sister is a compelling protagonist in a story that brilliantly captures her point of view.
Star Wars: Inquisitor - Rise of the Red Blade is among the 100&#43; Star Wars audiobooks available on Spotify Premium. 



 6  Vice Admiral Rampart 
Star Wars: The Bad Batch - Season 2
        

Vice Admiral Rampart may not be as outwardly villainous as Imperials like Tarkin, but he has shown his cruelty throughout Star Wars: The Bad Batch, with season 2 revealing how far he would go to achieve his goals. Rampart gunned down a clone soldier who refused to falsify a report and ordered Crosshair to continue his hunt for Clone Force 99 without the Empire&#39;s knowledge. Whereas season 1 showed what Rampart would do to protect the Empire, season 2 explored what he would do to protect himself and his status. Ironically, Rampart became Palpatine&#39;s scapegoat for Kamino&#39;s destruction, setting up an intriguing arc should he return in season 3.


 5  The Scourge 
Star Wars: Dark Droids
        

The Star Wars: Dark Droids comics introduced one of the franchise&#39;s most unique villains in years through the Scourge. A sentient droid virus that merged with dark-side AI, the Scourge set out to corrupt all droids and absorb them into its hivemind and corrupt organics. He did this by taking control of cyborgs like Lobot and even Darth Vader, which allowed him to use the Force. The Scourge&#39;s abilities made him nearly unstoppable and a chilling threat to the Star Wars universe.


 4  &#34;The Mother&#34; 
Star Wars: The High Republic
        

Star Wars publishing had another engaging antagonist in Elecia Zeveron, more commonly known as &#34;The Mother.&#34; She was the sister of a Jedi candidate passed up for training, causing her to resent the Order and seek revenge. After infiltrating the Path of the Open Hand, she turned the group militant and morphed it into the Path of the  d Fist, declaring war against the Jedi. The conflict led to a showdown on Dalna, with the only survivor founding another group called the Nihil. The Mother was a cunning villain whose actions had lasting repercussions for the Jedi of the High Republic era.


 3  Grand Admiral Thrawn 
Ahsoka


 







Fans had waited years for Grand Admiral Thrawn&#39;s return to Star Wars, and his live-action debut didn&#39;t disappoint in Ahsoka season 1. Lars Mikkelsen slipped right back into the role, perfectly capturing Thrawn&#39;s personality in live-action with the added benefit of keeping his now iconic voice. Thrawn displayed his trademark cunning and strategy in only a few episodes, escaping Peridea to prepare for his attack on the New Republic.


 2  Bode Akuna 
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor


 







As compelling as Dagan Gera was, Bode Akuna is Jedi: Survivor&#39;s standout character. The developers committed to portraying him as Cal Kestis&#39; friend throughout the story, making his betrayal and reveal as a Jedi survivor more shocking. Bode&#39;s friendship with Cal also makes his descent into madness heartbreaking, leaving a lasting impact on the characters.


 1  Baylan Skoll 
Ahsoka


 







Baylan Skoll is arguably the best villain of Disney Star Wars, embodying everything a great antagonist should be. The late Ray Stevenson&#39;s brilliant performance elevates an already exceptionally written character, displaying a stoic charisma contrasted by moments of rage. Baylan breaks the standard Sith/Imperial mold of many Star Wars villains, topped off by compelling motivations and a surprising amount of wisdom to impart to the hero. Baylan Skoll will be remembered as one of the best roles of Stevenson&#39;s career and the best Star Wars villain of 2023.
