# Percy Jackson s Lotus Hotel Scenes Missed Out On The Best Chance To Set Up 2 Huge Demigods


## SUMMARY 



  Percy Jackson episode 6 missed the chance to explore the people trapped in the Lotus Hotel for decades, by removing the character Darrin.   The absence of the Lotus Hotel&#39;s long-term residents means the show missed a good opportunity to tease the future demigods Nico and Bianca di Angelo from the book series.   Instead of setting up Nico and Bianca concretely outside of audio Easter eggs, the episode focused on Luke, May Castellan, and Hermes for future storyline development.

## Literature Review

The Lotus Hotel and Casino in Percy Jackson episode 6 could have been utilized to set up two major demigods, yet missed this opportunity.





Summary

  Percy Jackson episode 6 missed the chance to explore the people trapped in the Lotus Hotel for decades, by removing the character Darrin.   The absence of the Lotus Hotel&#39;s long-term residents means the show missed a good opportunity to tease the future demigods Nico and Bianca di Angelo from the book series.   Instead of setting up Nico and Bianca concretely outside of audio Easter eggs, the episode focused on Luke, May Castellan, and Hermes for future storyline development.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6&#39;s Lotus Hotel and Casino missed the perfect chance to better set up two vital demigods. The story of Percy Jackson episode 6 centered on the trio of Percy, Annabeth, and Grover searching for Hermes in Las Vegas. Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek god of travelers and messengers is supposedly a frequenter of the Lotus Hotel and Casino, a location in which several of the biggest story reveals of Percy Jackson episode 6 were found.

With only two episodes of Percy Jackson season 1 remaining, episode 6 somewhat changes the impact the Lotus Hotel and Casino has on the overall quest for Zeus&#39; master bolt. Rather than spend 20 minutes in the building as Percy thought, the trio actually missed the deadline for the summer solstice as the hotel&#39;s magic kept them on the premises for days on end. However, despite spending days in the Lotus Hotel and Casino, the show missed the chance to set up two of Percy Jackson&#39;s most important demigod characters in a concrete way.

Firstly, it is worth exploring the book differences of the Percy Jackson TV show concerning the Lotus Hotel and Casino. In the book, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are enticed into the hotel and receive a premium suite, endless cash, and all-you-can-eat food and drink. Combined with the magic of the Lotus Eaters, the trio becomes lost in the endless wonders of the hotel before Percy is awakened by a character named Darrin. Darrin strikes Percy as strange given the character&#39;s older clothes and slang, before telling Percy that it is currently 1977.

That said, Darrin is not found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6. By removing Darrin, the TV show misses out on providing a deep exploration of the people who have been trapped in the Lotus Hotel for decades. While it is hinted that Augustus, the Satyr whom Grover befriends in Percy Jackson episode 6, has been trapped in the hotel for a while, the show does not include a more clear, overt exploration of people who have been staying in Las Vegas for tens of years.



 Percy Jackson Episode 6&#39;s Darrin Story Would Have Been A Better Nico &amp; Bianca Tease Than Audio Easter Eggs

The lack of teases concerning people who have been in the Lotus Hotel for decades means Percy Jackson episode 6 missed the best chance to tease two future demigods: Nico and Bianca di Angelo. In the third book of the original series, Percy Jackson and the Titan&#39;s Curse, Nico and Bianca are revealed as two children of Hades whom the god of the Underworld sired shortly before the Big Three pact was enacted in the 1930s. In order to save the children from Zeus&#39; wrath, Hades hid them in the Lotus Hotel and Casino where they stayed for 70 years.




This means that Nico and Bianca will have been in the Lotus Hotel at the same time as Percy, Annabeth, and Grover during the first book. This could have led to the two potentially being spotted in small cameo roles during Percy Jackson episode 6, setting up their future roles in a potential third season and beyond. However, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 neglected this, instead throwing in almost inaudible teases to the characters in the background in favor of setting up Luke’s story with May, his mother, and Hermes.

New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians release every Tuesday on Disney&#43;.
