## Literature Review
The ending of Echo sees Kingping gearing up for taking over the MCU&#39;s New York City as mayor, putting several prominent heroes in the crossfire.




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Echo.
The post-credits tease of the last episode of Marvel&#39;s Echo has left some startling implications for the MCU&#39;s New York City, with several prominent heroes likely to be caught in the crossfire. Featuring as the main antagonist in Echo, Kingpin has now found himself crossing paths with several prominent street-level heroes in the MCU. While opinions have been divided on Echo, the series&#39; implications on the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe are noteworthy for multiple upcoming projects.
The last scene of Echo features Kingping licking his wounds from Oklahoma on his private jet, returning to New York City amidst a mayoral election with no clear front-runner. Always one to take advantage of a power vacuum, this scene sets up Kingpin&#39;s rise to power as mayor in the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again and Spider-Man 4, possibly taking notes from a recent comics run in which Kingpin uses his government status to outlaw superheroes in New York City. Considering his multiple humiliating defeats at the hands of heroes thus far in the MCU, the prospect of Wilson Fisk as mayor has some dire consequences for the city&#39;s most prominent defenders.









 








 8  Hawkeye 
Has quite the history with Kingpin


 







Not appearing as a major villain in an MCU Disney&#43; series for the first time in Echo, Kingpin was revealed to be the big bad behind Eleanor Bishop&#39;s operations in Hawkeye, putting him in the sights of the Avenger. Previously to that, Clint Barton had targeted Kingpin&#39;s organization during his time as the killer vigilante, Ronin, during the blip. While Kingpin managed to make Ronin&#39;s wrath work to his advantage, it&#39;s undeniable that Fisk will have a close eye on Clint Barton during his rise to political power due to his multiple instances of meddling in Kingpin&#39;s criminal activities.





 7  Kate Bishop 
Personally defeated Kingpin to protect her mother
        

When her mother&#39;s corruption was exposed, Kate Bishop had to fight tooth and nail in order to protect her from being tied up as just another one of Wilson Fisk&#39;s loose ends. This included a personal one-on-one duel between the nascent hero and Kingpin himself, with Kate barely managing to come out on top thanks to her trick arrows and an assist from Eleanor. Though Maya may have been the one to ultimately land the finishing blow on Fisk in Hawkeye, it&#39;s unlikely that Kingpin will forget his humiliating defeat at the hands of a mere college student once he&#39;s gained control of New York City.





 6  Daredevil 
Kingpin&#39;s long-standing rival


 







Thanks to the glimpse inside Kingpin&#39;s head Maya was able to provide audiences as Echo, Netflix&#39;s Daredevil being canon in the MCU seems more likely than ever before. If the events of the original series to feature Vincent D&#39;Onofrio as the character are to be believed, Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk already have a lengthy history as archenemies, with Daredevil having put Fisk behind bars once already. Of course, this means that the target on Daredevil&#39;s back is perhaps bigger than any other hero currently active in New York City, meaning The Man Without Fear may not be able to claim such a title any longer once Kingpin is crowned as mayor.





 5  Jessica Jones 
One of New York&#39;s most powerful active heroes
        

If the christening of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil as canon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is to be believed, the franchise could see the return of all the Netflix Defenders in the MCU. As a result, the MCU&#39;s New York City would have plenty of opportunities to include the street-level heroes, with Jessica Jones being one of the most powerful among them. Deciding to remain in New York despite her various traumas brought on by the superhero lifestyle, Jessica Jones&#39; powers and penchant for sticking her nose into deep rabbit holes of corruption as a private investigator makes her a dangerous threat to Kingpin&#39;s hold on the city.





 4  Luke Cage 
A rival crime boss that later turns mayor
        

Another of Netflix&#39;s Defenders, Luke Cage bears some notable similarities to Kingpin that are likely to make him a target. Ending his series as the benevolent crime boss of Harlem, Cage&#39;s criminal control in a prominent area of the city could easily be targeted by a Fisk-led NYPD, seeing him as a threat to Kingpin&#39;s grip on the city. Not only that, but in Marvel Comics, Luke Cage becomes mayor after Wilson Fisk, seeking to undo the damage his mayorality had caused. This storyline could be an easy layup for the MCU to pursue following Kingpin&#39;s rise to power, spelling tumultuous times ahead for Luke Cage.





 3  Iron Fist 
A street-level hero frequenting New York City
        

Though Iron Fist&#39;s travels take him across the globe compared to the relatively local escapades of the other Netflix Defenders, Danny Rand still frequently returns to New York as a hero. The last audiences saw of Iron Fist, he was on a globe-trotting journey to regain his powers and track down Orson Randall, a mysterious black-market merchant with mysterious goals relating to those who bore the Iron Fist&#39;s power. It&#39;s possible that the effects of Kingpin&#39;s power on Rand industries could see Iron Fist returning to New York City, sure to have business with Wilson Fisk.





 2  Punisher 
All the more important in a New York run by corruption


 







The anti-hero willing to go to lengths the other heroes aren&#39;t, Frank Castle is a cold killer who is willing to cross any line to dish out his own perverted brand of justice. After a brief, failed attempt at living a simple, peaceful life, Castle returned to his role as The Punisher seemingly permanently. In Wilson Fisk&#39;s vision of New York City, running rampant with corruption at every corner, The Punisher&#39;s willingness to break moral and legal boundaries on heroism is more relevant than ever. Thus, he may just be the single most dangerous hero for Kingpin to contend with, despite his lack of powers.





 1  Spider-Man 
New York&#39;s most famous superhero
        

Beyond being the most popular Marvel character, Spider-Man is a staple of New York City. Following the ending of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Peter Parker is once again a nobody, street-level hero without access to Tony Stark&#39;s tech or resources, making him a more realistic target for Kingpin to contend with. The end of Echo could set up Kingpin appearing as a major antagonist in Spider-Man 4, finally pitting the webslinger against a villain he&#39;s historically battled with in the comics on the screen for the first time.
