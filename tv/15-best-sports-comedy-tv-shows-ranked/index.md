 15  Arli$$ (1996-2002) 
Seamlessly blending the worlds of professional athletics and satirical humor.
        

Lasting seven seasons, the show utilized real-life sports stories and controversies as fodder for clever comedy and social commentary. From agent mishaps to player scandals, no topic felt off-limits. While mining the ridiculous elements of the sports world, Arli$$ also created an endearing antihero in its title character. Simultaneously crafty and bumbling, Arliss MIchaels was a sports agent whose wheeling and dealing ways allowed the show to explore issues in the industry. With strong writing and acting, Arli$$ struck a balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and impactful storytelling.





 14  Coach (1989-1997) 
A humorous and heartfelt look at the world of college football.
        

Centered around a fictional Minnesota college team, Coach told the story of Hayden Fox, brought to life with humor and passion by Craig T. Nelson. Supported by a memorable ensemble cast, the show struck the perfect balance between laugh-out-loud athletic hijinks and resonant storytelling. From player squabbles to staff disputes, Coach pulled no punches in satirizing the politics of college sports. It also created rich relationships between coach Fox, his daughter, and fellow staff that gave the show warmth. While fully leaning into broad sports comedy, Coach also found room for growth and heartache.





 13  Ballers (2015-2019) 
Insightfully explores the strategy required behind the scenes.


 







 Ballers 

 Release Date   June 21, 2015    Cast   Troy Garity , Donovan W. Carter , Rob Corddry , Jazmyn Simon , Dwayne Johnson    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   5    




Rather than simply relying on the bravado Dwayne Johnson built through wrestling and film, this HBO series grants insight into his sharp mind. Centered on ex-NFL star Spencer Strasmore’s transition into a financial manager shepherding current players, Ballers explores the strategizing required behind the scenes. Though still capitalizing on Johnson’s magnetic charisma, the show smartly frames his intellect as the true driver of success. Although Ballers ended after five seasons, it recognizes the foresight and vision required to guide others’ careers, making this show quite unique. Just as Johnson leverages his star power across WWE, movies and TV, the show examines the business calculations defining such crossover domination.





 12  Brockmire (2017-2020) 
One of the most inventive sports comedies around


 







Beneath the booze-soaked debauchery and profanity lies a surprisingly thoughtful story of redemption. When disgraced broadcaster Jim Brockmire resurfaces years after an infamous on-air meltdown, he reluctantly takes a job calling games for a downtrodden minor league team. What ensues is a funny, yet moving portrait of a flawed man helping others while fighting his inner demons. Brockmire earns its comedy stripes through razor-sharp dialogue and Azaria’s virtuoso performance, swinging from humorous meltdowns to emotional vulnerability. The show’s secret weapon, however, is the heart it displays as Brockmire grudgingly mentors a young associate, while unlikely bonds punctuate the crass laugh lines.





 11  Heels (2021-2023) 
A great show with thoughtful writing and committed performances.
        

 Heels 

 Release Date   August 15, 2021    Cast   Alison Luff , David James Elliott , Alexander Ludwig , Kelli Berglund , Phil Brooks , Allen Maldonado , Melissa LeEllen , Mary McCormack , Stephen Amell , James Harrison    Genres   sport , Drama    Seasons   2    




Heels is a sports comedy that stands tall for pulling back the curtain on independent wrestling to reveal the complex interplay between reality and illusion. As rising heel Jack and restless face Ace navigate keeping their family promotion afloat, Heels examines the grit behind small-scale spots far from the WWE limelight. In the process, it insightfully explores how the Spades’ drive to honor their father conflicts with diverging career goals and responsibility to their own families. While the show nails a wrestling spectacle, its true power lies in substantiating the very human people behind the eccentric sport.
            
 
 Heels Season 3: Cancelation, Renewal Chances &amp; Everything We Know 
Heels season 3 was set up by the shocking second season finale to be one of the most explosive yet in the Starz wrestling drama.









 10  Survivor’s Remorse (2014-2017) 
Tackles weighty topics with humor and heart.
        

Following young basketball star Cam Calloway&#39;s rise from poverty to fame, the show explores issues of race, gender, and loyalty through Cam&#39;s adjustment to wealth, but the show never descends into moralizing or lecturing. Instead, keen satire meshes with Jessie T. Usher&#39;s magnetic lead performance to give Survivor’s Remorse a lively, insightful edge. While creating laughs from fish-out-of-water moments, the show also probes deeper questions about community and privilege. Ultimately, Survivor’s Remorse stands apart for its shrewd social commentary. Nothing feels off limits, from sexual politics to sudden tragedies, the sharp writing and acting attack each topic with humor and nuance.





 9  The League (2009-2015) 
Fun moments with friends who play fantasy football.
        

 the league 

 Release Date   October 29, 2009    Cast   Katie Aselton    Genres   Sitcom    Seasons   7    




The League uses fantasy football to explore the enduring appeal of tight-knit friends who relentlessly tease each other. Though football fandom drives the outward plot, it is the vulgar and warm camaraderie that gives The League its humor. Anchored by an electric ensemble of underrated comics like Paul Scheer and Nick Kroll, the show gives off R-rated improv chemistry from its talented cast. The League excels by channeling the laughter-filled chaos of close friends for whom no remark feels off-side, be it Sunday football or life itself. With The League&#39;s best running gags, it celebrates the precious bonds forged through giving the best of friends a hard time.





 8  Blue Mountain State (2010-2011) 
An unapologetic focus on college football hijinks.
        

The Spike TV sitcom hones in on a hard-partying fictional university and the debauchery surrounding its powerhouse team. By leaning into every possible vice associated with big-time college athletics, the show builds episode after episode around the seemingly bottomless capacity for hedonism in jock culture. What could become gratuitous instead turns into hilarious fun thanks to the show’s commitment to slapstick spectacle. Whether engineering elaborate schemes to meet co-eds or hazing misadventures gone wrong, Blue Mountain State makes no excuses in service of an outrageous joke. That willingness to shock through sheer breadth of anarchic behavior makes the show a cult favorite.





 7  Eastbound &amp; Down (2009-2013) 
An honest and hilarious redemption story.
        

Eastbound &amp; Down is unrivaled for transforming Danny McBride&#39;s Kenny Powers into a magnetic antihero. Originating as a film concept expanded into an HBO series, it finds entertainment in the story of a washed-up ex-MLB pitcher fueled by ego, desperate for renewed relevance. Buoyed by an ability to elicit surprising nuance from arrogant has-beens unable to relinquish their past glory, Eastbound &amp; Down cements McBride&#39;s creative team as esteemed captains in the realm of sports comedy.





 6  Sports Night (1998-2000) 
An Aaron Sorkin masterpiece that was one of a kind.
        

Sports Night exemplified sports comedy brilliance by infusing rapid banter and resonant storytelling into a late night analysis show. Tension smartly stems from the pressure to excel under national scrutiny, letting clever characters who love their jobs shine. Blending film-worthy writing and a splendid cast, the sharply written sitcom was one of a kind. Breaking genre convention, Sports Night balanced complex relationships and broadcast production challenges within its hilarious work dynamics. For innovatively bridging multicam and single-cam approaches, Sports Night cemented its place as a sports comedy pioneer.





 5  A League Of Their Own (2022) 
A great take on the classic film of the same name.
        

 A League Of Their Own 

 Release Date   August 12, 2022    Cast   Gbemisola Ikumel , Roberta Colindrez , Priscilla Delgado , Chanté Adams , Abbi Jacobson , Kelly McCormack , Nick Offerman , D&#39;Arcy Carden    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Sports    Seasons   1    




While the classic film is undeniably charming, the A League of Their Own series stands apart in the sports comedy arena for swinging ambitiously at vital social issues. Though undoubtedly funny and heartfelt, the show also bookmarks America’s past prejudices around race, gender and sexuality. Starring Abbi Jacobson and Chanté Adams, its parallel tales highlight systemic roadblocks both inside and outside the league. Joining entertainment and commentary from women fighting just to play baseball, A League of Their Own wins with resonance and purpose over mere nostalgia. Despite A League of Their Own being canceled, it inspires by spotlighting the courage required for progress.





 4  GLOW (2017-2019) 
A great combination of sport, comedy and femininity.
        

 GLOW 

 Release Date   June 23, 2017    Cast   Alison Brie , Betty Gilpin , Marc Maron    Genres   Drama    Seasons   3    




Among sports comedies, GLOW is one of the best for its joyous celebration of female wrestlers chasing their dreams in this TV show set in the 1980s. Far from just a flashy retrospective, the Netflix series also packs an emotional punch thanks to its complex characters and social commentary. While never shying away from the tough issues of race, gender or the realities of chasing unlikely stardom, the show&#39;s core strength lies in the resonant bonds main character Ruth forms with her fellow wrestlers. Through painful failures and hard-won triumphs, their loyalty and belief in each other gives GLOW its motivational fuel.





 3  Shoresy (2022-Present) 
Stellar insult comedy that gives way to earned communal spirit.
        

 Shoresy 

 Release Date   May 13, 2022    Cast   Tasya Teles , Harlan Blayne Kytwayhat , Jonathan Diaby , Jared Keeso , Keilani Rose , Ryan McDonell , Blair Lamora , Terry Ryan    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Action    Seasons   1    




As a foil turned breakout star for six seasons of Letterkenny, snarky Shoresy elevates his own spinoff into a top spot among sports comedies by deploying vulgarity in service of surprising warmth. Though initially defined only by ruthless insults thrown from the hockey bench, the titular athlete gets human dimension as the coach of a flailing senior team in Sudbury. The show nails its laugh lines through Shoresy’s banter aimed at his squad. Despite the insults, a paternal investment in the lovable team emerges. Beneath each scathing takedown lies an implicit belief that his band of misfits has potential.





 2  Cobra Kai (2018-Present) 
Solidifies itself as an elevated continuation that befits The Karate Kid&#39;s enduring legacy.


 







 Cobra Kai 

 Cast   Tanner Buchanan , Xolo Mariduena , Mary Mouser , Connor Murdock , Ralph Macchio , Nichole Brown , Jacob Bertrand , Griffin Santopietro , William Zabka    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Action    Seasons   5    




Cobra Kai remains the pinnacle among follow-ups to beloved 80s sports movies, particularly for its exploration of the iconic karate rivalry between Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence. This YouTube-turned-Netflix drama excels in revisiting these characters as flawed middle-aged senseis, portrayed by Ralph Macchio and William Zabka, and introduces surprising depth to their personas. Triumphing through moral complexity, Cobra Kai is a spectacular mix of fight choreography, teenage angst, and nostalgia for Mr. Miyagi&#39;s wax-on era. The series goes beyond mere callbacks, delving into the gray areas between traditional heroes and villains, skillfully navigating the complexities of these once-imperfect rivals turned mentors.





 1  Ted Lasso (2020-2023) 
The apex of sports comedies that remains unrivaled.
        

 Ted Lasso 

 Release Date   August 14, 2020    Cast   Jeremy Swift , Phil Dunster , Hannah Waddingham , Nick Mohammed , Brendan Hunt , Jason Sudeikis , Brett Goldstein , Juno Temple , Toheeb Jimoh , James Lance    Genres   Comedy , Drama , sport    Seasons   3    




A series evolved far beyond its viral comedy sketch origins, Ted Lasso emerges as the crowned jewel of sports comedies by marrying optimism with insight into the psychology underlying athletics. While the initial Saturday Night Live idea of an American football coach blithely bungling British soccer seemed thin even before the sport’s U.S. boom, Jason Sudekis makes the title character so profoundly decent that the show strikes a tone both laugh-out-loud funny and moving. With a humanistic perspective on the necessity of hope, Ted Lasso is a comedy with depth that cannot be overlooked. Mixed with all its charm, it serves as an anthem for embodying one’s competitive best.
