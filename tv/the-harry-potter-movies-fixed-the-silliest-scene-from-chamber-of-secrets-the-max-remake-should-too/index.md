# The Harry Potter Movies Fixed The Silliest Scene From Chamber Of Secrets (&amp; The Max Remake Should Too)


## SUMMARY 



  The Harry Potter movies made improvements on certain scenes from the books, such as the moment Dobby the house-elf is freed in Chamber of Secrets.   In the book version, Harry puts the diary inside a sock, depending on Lucius Malfoy throwing it away in disgust to free Dobby.   The movie version, where Harry hands Lucius the diary with the sock hidden inside, makes more sense and adds clever elements to the scene. The remake should follow the movie&#39;s example in this case.

## Literature Review
HBO&#39;s Harry Potter remake will be a book-faithful adaptation, but a ridiculous book scene proves the series must sometimes follow the movies instead.




The primary appeal of the HBO Harry Potter remake is a chance for a book-faithful screen adaptation, but there&#39;s a ridiculous book scene that the movies did far betterâ€”so Max should follow suit. Typically, in an effort to bring the events of a novel to a film, changes are made that are unpopular with fans. This has certainly been true with the Harry Potter movies, where major plot points were often left out only for pointless additions to take their place. Max&#39;s Harry Potter TV remake has a chance to set all of this straight, but there are a few scenes in which the movie actually did better than the book, and this puts the remake in the position of choosing which version of the story to adopt.




An example of a book scene that the Harry Potter movies did better was the moment that Dobby the house-elf was freed in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. At the end of the film, Harry cleverly places his sock in the pages of Tom Riddle&#39;s diary before handing it back to Lucius Malfoy. He knew that Draco&#39;s father would immediately pass the book over to his servant, unknowingly handing over clothing and thus freeing Dobby in the process. The fact that this actually worked (or that it is so easy to free house-elves) is already a bit of a stretch, but this version of events is far better than how things went down in the Chamber of Secrets book.

                  HBO&#39;s Harry Potter Show: Updates &amp; Everything We Know   Harry Potter is being remade as a television show for HBO Max and every detail about the next adaptation featuring the Boy Wizard can be found here.    


 Harry Potter Freed Dobby Differently In The Chamber Of Secrets Book 
          




When looking at how Harry tricked Lucius Malfoy into freeing Dobby in the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets book, there&#39;s no question why the Warner Bros movie saw fit to make changes. In this version, rather than placing the sock within the diary, Harry puts the diary inside the sock. This implies that, in the book, Tom Riddle&#39;s diary was far smaller than it had been in the Chamber of Secrets movie, but Harry&#39;s plot to free Dobby becomes even more unlikely from here. He even seemed to be aware of this since, as he ran down the corridor after Mr. Malfoy, he was &#34;wondering if this plan could possibly work.&#34;



Rather than placing the sock within the diary, Harry puts the diary inside the sock.




When he caught up with Lucius Malfoy, Harry shoved the diary-stuffed sock into his hands. Since Harry had just been running around through the school&#39;s plumbing, the sock was soaked with foul-smelling slime, which seemed to be key to Harry&#39;s plan. Disgusted, Lucius ripped the diary out of the sock and tossed the article of clothing blindly away from him. Miraculously, Dobby just happened to be precisely where the sock ended up. The house-elf caught it and was immediately freed.






 Harry Putting The Diary In The Sock Makes No Sense (&amp; Wouldn&#39;t Work On Screen) 
          

The Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets book&#39;s version of Harry freeing Dobby was pretty difficult to swallow since it left far too much to chance. Even reading the scene, it&#39;s difficult to imagine Lucius reaching into the foul-smelling sock to rip out the diary. Then, the fact that Dobby just happened to be standing exactly where the sock was tossed is hard enough to believe as a chance happening, let alone something that was meant to have been planned by Harry. As ridiculous as this scene was, it would have looked even more outrageous on screen where audiences&#39; imaginations couldn&#39;t put their own spin on things.

Harry&#39;s plan still left a lot to chance in the Harry Potter movie, but it made far more sense for Lucius to hand Dobby the diary. It&#39;s believable that Harry could have predicted that a wizard like Mr. Malfoy would have his servant carry his things. Additionally, Harry used this moment to accuse the man of planting the diary on Ginny Weasley (something he did back in Dumbledore&#39;s office in the book), which was clever since it would have subtly pushed Lucius to distance himself from the object quickly rather than digging around in the pages. It was a simple change on the Chamber of Secrets movie&#39;s part that made for a far better scene, especially on screen.






 HBO&#39;s Harry Potter Remake Should Follow The Movies In This Case 
         

The cuts or changes in the Harry Potter movies are a large part of what makes a Harry Potter remake worth it. HBO has promised a book-faithful adaptation, and given the longer TV format of the remake, the series can include every single delicious moment from Rowling&#39;s novels. This means we can finally see those small, simple Hogwarts moments, such as the Golden Trio&#39;s cozy visits with Hagrid, as well as the more significant plot points, such as the Maruaders&#39; storyline (which was criminally cut from the Harry Potter movies). Still, the Dobby-gets-freed-by-a-sock scene is a case in which the Max remake needs to look to the films.

As many mistakes as the Harry Potter movies made, they are still beloved by a generation of Potterheads, and they, therefore, should stand as a foundation for HBO&#39;s remake. Even book fans are likely to have forgotten that Harry placed the diary within his sock in the book, so the version seen in the Chamber of Secrets film is often regarded as canon. It will be tough for Max to pick through the books and movies and determine where to stay faithful to which source, but in the case of this silly Harry Potter scene, the choice is pretty clear.
