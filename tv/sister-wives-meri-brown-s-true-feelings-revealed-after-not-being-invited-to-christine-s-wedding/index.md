## Literature Review
When Sister Wives star Christine Brown revealed her and David Woolley&#39;s wedding guest list, Meri was shockingly not on it, along with Kody and Robyn.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown’s real reaction to not being on Christine Brown and David Woolley’s wedding guest list has been revealed. Kody Brown married Meri in 1990, and Christine was his third wife after a spiritual marriage in 1994. Kody and his three wives began facing tension in their polygamous marriage during the COVID-19 pandemic when Kody began spending all his time with Robyn Brown. Blending families was getting difficult for her, and Christine left Kody in November 2021. She said she couldn’t be a sister wife to Meri and Janelle Brown. “I can be their friend,” she added. However, Christine did not invite Meri, Kody, and Robyn to her wedding.




A source told the U.S. Sun how Meri felt about being snubbed from Christine and David’s nuptials. The source claimed, “Meri didn’t care about attending,” adding that, according to them, Meri couldn’t care less. “They had a falling out,” the insider said about Meri and Christine. They spoke about Meri and Christine having been distant ever since Christine left the family and moved to Utah. The source said, “They were never close as sister wives or best friends for that matter.” Allegedly, there is no love lost between Christine and Meri.

Meanwhile, the source also seems to know why Meri wasn’t bothered by not receiving the wedding invite. Meri is supposedly “happy” with her life being away from Kody’s ex-wives. “The thing about Meri is she is really happy with her life right now,” the source maintained. Along with Kody not being in her life, which is what primarily makes her happy, she has also “found her peace.” The source believed that Meri was not “lacking anything” in her life at all. “She doesn’t have animosity or anger,” they added.


 

Meri seems to be in a “really good place” at the moment. She has learned not to care so much about the other sister wives at all. She doesn’t need to know what they are up to, especially since Meri is not close to any of the other wives anymore. Meanwhile, Meri was filmed confessing to the cameras that she was “really happy” for Christine. Meri knew that Christine wanted to find some peace after ending things with Kody “for a really long time.” She was glad that Christine was able to find it.




Christine was the first to tell them about leaving Kody, and Meri agreed with what she had to say because that’s what Meri was feeling as well. However, she had felt betrayed by Christine when the latter decided to leave her along with Kody. According to Meri, Christine had always said that the sister wives came before her “man” to her. Meri and Christine had a fun relationship in the past, even though it had not been deep. She missed spending time with Christine. While Meri could be making it look like Christine not inviting her wasn’t a big deal, she could be using her nonchalance to hide her true feelings.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
