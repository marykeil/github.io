## Literature Review
The latest clip from Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 features a reunion between Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson and Kelli Giddish’s Amanda Rollins.




The latest clip from Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 features a reunion between Mariska Hargitay&#39;s Olivia Benson and Kelli Giddish&#39;s Amanda Rollins. The seminal police procedural returns with a new installment consisting of 13 episodes. Giddish, who exited SVU as a main cast member in the previous season, has maintained a presence on the Law &amp; Order franchise as a guest star.




In a new preview of Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 (via @lawandordertv), Giddish is back as Rollins for a special occasion.


 

In the episode, titled &#34;Tunnel Blind&#34;, the team comes together to celebrate the birth of Rollins and Carisi’s (Peter Scanavino) child. But another child goes missing in broad daylight.


 SVU&#39;s Premiere Includes A Sweet Benson &amp; Stabler Hint 
          

The premiere will show the team bonding, away from the pressures of solving a case. Rollins, like Fin (Ice-T) and Carisi, seem fairly at ease, but Benson doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s especially true when Carisi&#39;s cousin inquires whether Benson is single and he gets the message that she isn&#39;t interested in dating. In the SVU season 25 clip, Benson colorfully says that dating would be like tossing your heart into a woodchipper.




Carisi&#39;s cousin later asks about Benson&#39;s compass around her neck, referring to Stabler&#39;s gift from the recent Law &amp; Order three-way crossover. Benson explains the significance of it, and when the cousin asks if the compass has been pointing her in the right direction, Benson looks at the happiness that Rollins and Carisi share. She says, with a sigh and perhaps a bit of longing, that it hasn&#39;t happened yet.

                  Burton Lowe&#39;s Connection To Olivia Benson In Law &amp; Order: SVU Explained   Burton Lowe is a minor character in Law &amp; Order: SVU with a big impact on the series&#39; main character, Olivia Benson. How do the two know each other?    

Benson and Stabler&#39;s supporters know that the pair have been dancing around the possibility of a relationship for years, even more since Stabler reappeared in her life a few years ago. It stands to reason that this season may finally see some movement on the Law &amp; Order: SVU&#39;s top pairing, with the shorter episode count allowing for a greater focus on the core characters.






Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 debuts Thursday, January 18 at 8 PM ET on NBC.
