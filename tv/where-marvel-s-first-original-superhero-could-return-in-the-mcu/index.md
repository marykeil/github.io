# Where Marvel s First Original Superhero Could Return In The MCU


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s first original superhero, Kahhori, could return to the MCU after making her debut in What If...? season 2.   Kahhori&#39;s best opportunity for her live-action return is in Avengers: Secret Wars in 2027, where many Marvel characters from alternate realities are expected to appear.   If Kahhori returns to the live-action MCU, her original voice actor, Devery Jacobs, should reprise the role, as she received praise for her portrayal in What If...? season 2.

## Literature Review
Marvel Studios&#39; What If...? season 2 debuted an original MCU superhero, who could make their next appearance in a live-action MCU adventure.




Marvel Studios&#39; first original superhero could return to the MCU following her powerful debut in Phase 5&#39;s What If...? season 2. What If...? season 2 broke a release trend for Marvel Studios, premiering an episode every day for nine consecutive days over the 2023 Holiday period. However, the series continued season 1&#39;s pattern of exploring alternate realities and variant characters, including Peggy Carter&#39;s super-soldier Captain Carter, a twisted Doctor Strange Supreme, the Avengers team of 1988 and a version of Hela who became a hero after experiencing Ta Lo&#39;s mysticism. What If...? season 2 also debuted the MCU&#39;s first original superhero, who could have a bright future ahead of her.




While most of What If...?&#39;s episodes begin with a single choice changing the storyline of the MCU, What If...? season 2, episode 6, &#34;What If... Kahhori Reshaped the World?,&#34; marked a huge divergence from what viewers know of the franchise. After the Tesseract crash-landed in the Haudensaunee Confederacy of pre-colonial America, a young Mohawk woman is transformed into the MCU&#39;s first original superhero, Kahhori. Imbued with the powers of the Space Stone, Kahhori quickly mastered her new gifts, later using them in What If...? season 2&#39;s finale to help the enhanced Captain Carter in battle against Strange Supreme, and it&#39;s possible she could make the move to the live-action MCU.

                  The MCU&#39;s First Original Superhero Completely Retcons 1 Infinity Stone&#39;s Powers   The MCU has introduced its first completely original superhero in Kahhori in What If...? and retconned an Infinity Stone power in the process.    


 Secret Wars Is Kahhori&#39;s Best MCU Return 
         




While there are several possible avenues for Kahhori&#39;s return to the MCU, the best opportunity for her to spring back into action would be in 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars. Phase 6 and the Multiverse Saga&#39;s final project is expected to be featuring many Marvel characters from a variety of alternate realities, with the likes of 20th Century Fox&#39;s X-Men and Fantastic Four, several Spider-Man-related characters from Sony, and characters introduced in MCU&#39;s animated stories all suspected to be returning. This could create the perfect opportunity for Kahhori to make her live-action debut, just as Hayley Atwell&#39;s Captain Carter did before her in 2022&#39;s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

There are several other places that Kahhori could reappear in the MCU, aside from her likely appearance in Marvel Studios&#39; What If...? season 3. It&#39;s possible that the multiversal adventure of Ryan Reynolds&#39; Deadpool and Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine in 2024&#39;s Deadpool 3 could bring some characters from What If...? into the MCU, including Kahhori. Kahhori&#39;s Native American roots could also connect organically to the upcoming Echo series, though an Infinity Stone-powered superhero might not fit with the grounded nature of Echo. Kahhori hasn&#39;t yet been confirmed to be returning to the MCU, but it would be great to see her use her varied gifts in Marvel Studios&#39; live-action future.






 Marvel Already Knows Who Should Play Kahhori 
          

If Kahhori is brought into the live-action MCU after What If...?, the hero&#39;s original voice actor should be the one to reprise the role. Canadian Mohawk actor Devery Jacobs voiced Kahhori in What If...?, ahead of her upcoming live-action appearance as Bonnie in Echo. The details of Jacobs&#39; role in Echo are unclear, but if this is a smaller role, it&#39;s possible she could return as Kahhori in a future storyline. Jacobs has been celebrated for her portrayal of Kahhori in What If...? season 2, so she would be perfect to portray the character in live-action, though there are any number of incredible Mohawk actors who could assume the role.
