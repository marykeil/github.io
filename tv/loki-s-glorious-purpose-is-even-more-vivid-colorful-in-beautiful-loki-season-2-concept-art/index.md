## Literature Review
Loki season 2 concept art reveals an alternate look for Tom Hiddleston&#39;s new God of the Multiverse in the finale of Loki season 2.




Concept art for Loki season 2&#39;s epic finale reveals an alternate costume for Tom Hiddleston&#39;s powerful MCU hero. Loki season 2 premiered on Disney&#43; in October 2023, bringing Hiddleston back to the MCU as the Asgardian God of Mischief, and also marking the returns of the Time Variance Authority and Loki&#39;s newfound family, including Owen Wilson&#39;s Mobius, Wunmi Mosaku&#39;s Hunter B-15 and Ke Huy Quan&#39;s Ouroboros. After Loki season 1 ended with the destruction of the Sacred Timeline, season 2 took Loki and his friends on a journey across the multiverse, and concluded with Loki receiving a major power upgrade, making him one of the MCU&#39;s most significant new heroes.




Loki season 2&#39;s finale saw Loki destroy the Temporal Loom, gather the branching realities of the multiverse, and resign himself to an eternity of ensuring their protection. As MCU concept artist Karla Ortiz put it, Loki &#34;saves literally all of MCU.&#34; Ortiz noted this while sharing unused concept art from Loki season 2&#39;s finale, which would have seen the multiverse&#39;s timelines have more vivid colors with an organic texture, and would have gifted Loki an alternate costume, inspired by previous MCU suits. Loki becoming a bona fide God in Loki season 2&#39;s finale was a beautiful and cathartic moment, but this concept art would have made it even more powerful.


 


 Will Loki Return To The MCU After Season 2â€™s Epic Finale? 
         




After the conclusion of Loki season 2, there has been no confirmation of Tom Hiddleston returning to the live-action MCU as Loki. Variants of Loki did appear during 2023&#39;s What If...? season 2, but the fate of the MCU&#39;s current iteration is less clear. Loki season 2 saw Loki take his place in the wreckage of He Who Remains&#39; former Citadel at the End of Time, watching over the multiverse, where he will presumably stay for eternity. This means that it&#39;s possible Loki will never be seen in the live-action MCU again, potentially marking the end of Tom Hiddleston&#39;s 12-year-long journey with Marvel Studios.

While it could be the case that Loki won&#39;t return to the live-action MCU, there are clear ways that he could realistically return before the end of the Multiverse Saga. 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars is expected to feature a major multiversal storyline, which could constitute Loki&#39;s involvement, and could see him return to the main MCU timeline if the multiverse is destroyed or saved another way. New live-action variants of Loki could also make their way into the MCU from other realities, allowing Tom Hiddleston to continue his MCU journey. Marvel Studios hasn&#39;t yet confirmed a future for Loki in the MCU, but many want to see him return soon.
