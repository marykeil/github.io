## Literature Review
In the next episode of 1000-Lb Sisters, Tammy Slaton feels unsettled after her husband, Caleb Willingham, lets her down during their dinner date.




1000-Lb Sisters cast member Tammy Slaton disappointingly rejected Caleb Willingham’s latest gesture, which included unhealthy fast food. The Dixon resident has struggled a lot with her health over the last five years. She has been to the lowest of lows and almost lost her life. A few months ago, Tammy made the best life decision when she entered rehab. She improved her lifestyle and dropped a significant amount of weight. Tammy also met Caleb at the rehab and fell in love with him due to their common struggles. She tied the knot with him but had to part ways after completing her rehab.




In 1000-Lb Sisters season 5, Tammy has decided to take control of her life. However, she’s worried that Caleb is stuck in a food addiction spiral and isn’t getting better. The latest sneak peek of 1000-Lb Sisters season 5, reported by E! News, showed Tammy disappointed by Caleb’s gesture.


 

She felt unhappy that he got her numerous fast-food items like mozzarella sticks, wings, and more. She said, “Everything he got was fried, so I am a little perturbed with Caleb.” Tammy explained that she had already talked to her husband about “junk,” and he still got her that. She politely declined his gesture but looked visibly upset at him.

 Caleb Willingham Is Surprised By Tammy&#39;s Reaction 
          

The preview also showed Caleb’s reaction after Tammy said no. He said, “Being not only in this facility but in this small town, you’re stuck with so many options.” The former 1000-Lb Sisters cast member blamed the lack of options for not getting something better for his wife. He added, “When Tammy was here, occasionally she did have fried food or eat out.” Caleb implied he had no idea Tammy would react the way she did because he simply picked what he knew used to be her favorites. The 40-year-old reality star thought Tammy would “still enjoy” the fast food occasionally.

Tammy wasn’t wrong to show her disappointment to her husband. She has worked hard to get where she is and expected Caleb to be more considerate. The popular reality star was on the verge of dying due to her unhealthy eating habits a few months ago. She was addicted to fast food and was struggling psychologically. When Tammy entered the rehab, she put it all on the line. She changed her habit slowly and achieved a praiseworthy transformation after months of discipline. Tammy even talked to Caleb about not having junk. Therefore, it’s understandable why she wasn’t excited to see him bring mozzarella sticks and fried wings.




From Caleb’s perspective, what he did was simply a kind gesture. He wanted to have a sweet time with his wife and bring what he thought she’d love. Caleb and Tammy bonded over their love for food and mutual struggles. They became part of each other’s lives and fell in love because of their shared journeys. Unfortunately, they didn’t progress at the same speed. Tammy moved out of the rehab while Caleb remained stuck. Therefore, he had no idea what to get Tammy and how to keep her happy. The 1000-Lb Sisters cast member did what he thought was right and didn’t have malicious intent.



1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
