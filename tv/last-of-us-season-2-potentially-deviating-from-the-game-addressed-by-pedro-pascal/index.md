The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal has opened up about the possibility of season 2 deviating from the games in some key aspects. The upcoming season of the show will be adapting 2020&#39;s The Last of Us Part II, a sequel set four years after the events of the original. Despite positive critical reception, fans of the franchise were polarized by the game&#39;s story and character writing.

Speaking with Deadline at the Sundance Film Festival, Pascal opened up about the possibility of The Last of Us season 2 deviating from the video game it&#39;s based on.


 

The actor indicated that, while he didn&#39;t have any information, he explained differences between the game and TV show are bound to happen. Check out what Pascal had to say below:


Does it deviate from the game? That&#39;s a good question. I think that they&#39;re always gonna find ways to build on the incredible source material that they have, and surprise us with how they can use that material in a different format like a television show. But I wouldn&#39;t want to spoil it for anybody, and the truth is I don&#39;t actually have all of the information as of yet.






 Will The Last Of Us Season 2 Adapt Everything From The Game? 
          

The Last of Us Part II has many contentious moments, the biggest of which is the introduction of a new character named Abby. The antagonist is first introduced by killing Joel, prompting Ellie to go on a quest for revenge against her group. However, the game also explores the new villain&#39;s perspective, offering sympathy to her side of the story despite dispatching of a beloved character.

Since Kaitlyn Dever was cast as Abby, it appears Joel&#39;s demise is now a strong possibility for season 2. However, given just how much backlash the decision received from fans of the game, it&#39;s possible the TV adaptation will alter this decision. Pascal also has massive star power, being a key draw that the show&#39;s creative team may not want to kill off to maintain the series&#39; critical and commercial success.




                  6 Theories For How The Last Of Us Season 2 Will Deal With Its Big Joel Moment   The Last Of Us Part II opens with a shocking and controversial moment for Joel, raising the question of how The Last Of Us season 2 will deal with it.   

However, there are also fans of The Last of Us who want to see the games adapted properly, despite some elements that have proven contentious. Since Part II is planned to be adapted beyond just season 2, it&#39;s possible a compromise will be made that keeps Joel alive for season 2. However, his ultimate fate in the show won&#39;t be made clear until the series returns to HBO.



The Last of Us season 2 is scheduled to begin production in February 2024, with a 2025 release window confirmed.
