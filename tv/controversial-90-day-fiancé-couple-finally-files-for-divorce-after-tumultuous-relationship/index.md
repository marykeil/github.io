## Literature Review
An infamous 90 Day Fiancé couple has appeared in multiple franchise spin-offs since they separated, but they haven&#39;t gotten divorced until now.




An infamous 90 Day Fiancé couple is finally getting divorced after years of a troubled marriage. Since 90 Day Fiancé debuted back in 2014, the franchise has introduced several long-distance relationships that translate into successful marriages after the international partners move to America on a K-1 visa. At the same time, not all these romances end in a happily ever after, leaving questions over why they were together in the first place. These are the couples that have never been compatible from the start, and the international fiancés have even been accused of scamming their U.S. partner for a Green Card.




One such couple was Mike Youngquist and Natalie Mordovtseva, who tied the knot in April 2020 and split in December 2020. According to Monsters &amp; Critics, Natalie and Mike are divorcing. It&#39;s Mike who officially filed for divorce. He filed for a Dissolution of Marriage with No Children on December 5, 2023, from his Ukrainian wife. The online portal&#39;s court docket for Clallam County, Washington, confirms that Mike filed to dissolve his and Natalie’s marriage after three years ahead of her 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 debut.

 Natalie &amp; Mike&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          




Natalie is a 39-year-old woman from Kyiv, Ukraine, who met Mike, 39, in 2017 via their mutual friends. Both Mike and Natalie were the godparents to Matt and Svetlana&#39;s baby girl. Natalie had been married twice before meeting Mike. She left her first husband when he allegedly went bankrupt. Natalie was in the middle of divorcing her second husband when she started talking to Mike. Mike was also married previously, but his wife left him for another woman. He went to Ukraine to meet Natalie and later took her to Paris, where they got engaged. He was back in Ukraine to film 90 Day Fiancé season 7 when Natalie broke up with him in the finale.


 

Natalie had accused Mike of sleeping with his friend Sara. However, her K-1 visa got approved after the split and she moved to the U.S. in 90 Day Fiancé season 8. Natalie didn&#39;t like living in the woods of Sequim in Mike&#39;s trailer. She also couldn&#39;t get along with Mike&#39;s mother, Trish Youngquist. Mike, meanwhile, refused to return the ring Natalie had flung at him during their 90 Day Fiancé season 7 split. He kept her waiting for their wedding until the day her K-1 visa was about to expire. They got married regardless, but Natalie&#39;s complaints were endless. She accused Mike&#39;s mom of calling her a &#34;hooker&#34; during Thanksgiving and walked out of Mike&#39;s house during Christmas.




Mike and Natalie remained married when she moved to Florida to start her modeling and acting career. She met a man named Josh Weinstein, who was the CEO of a modeling agency, and they started dating. Meanwhile, Mike helped Natalie&#39;s mom while she was stuck in Ukraine during the war. Natalie finally managed to bring her mom to the U.S. and moved to California with her. Natalie&#39;s dream was to become a big actress in Hollywood, and it meant she could be closer to Josh in L.A. Now that she is getting divorced, the coast is clear for Natalie to marry Josh, if he agrees.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
