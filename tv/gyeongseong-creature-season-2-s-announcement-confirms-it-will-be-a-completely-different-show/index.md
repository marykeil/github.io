Netflix has renewed Gyeongseong Creature for season 2, but the show will be very different once it returns following season 1’s post-credits scene. Just four days after the final three episodes of season 1 premiered, the Netflix Korean show has secured a second season. Gyeongseong Creature season 2’s release date has not been announced yet, but both Park Seo-jun are Han So-hee confirmed to return.

Gyeongseong Creature season 1’s ending left a lot of loose endings, all but confirming a season 2 renewal was imminent. Chae-ok’s death and return, Tae-sang potentially being infected, and Lady Maeda surviving the explosion were some of the sequel hooks the finale included. However, none of them were as confusing and shocking as the post-credits scene, which was set in the modern day and featured a “new” character called Ho-jae.


 





 Gyeongseong Creature Will Take Place In 2024 Seoul 
          

As suggested by Gyeongseong Creature season 1’s post-credits scene, the second season will take place in the modern day. Although it was unclear in which year the scene was set, Netflix’s official Gyeongseong Creature 2 announcement confirms the story will now take place in 2024. Whether the show will fill in the gaps between the end of season 1 and the present day remains to be seen, but the press release mentions the show’s “time travel element.”  Therefore, even though Gyeongseong Creature will no longer be a period piece, there may still be scenes set shortly after 1945 to better connect the show’s first and second chapters.

The first Gyeongseong Creature season 2 images reveal Park Seo-jun and Han So-hee reuniting in modern-day Seoul, raising the question of who they are playing and whether they could still be portraying their original characters. Almost 80 years will separate Gyeongseong Creature’s seasons 1 and 2, meaning there has to be an explanation as to why the show’s leads will return. A simple yet uninspired answer is that they both playing descendants or reincarnations of Jang Tae-sang and Yoon Chae-ok. However, a much more interesting outcome is that both Tae-sang and Chae-ok are still alive all those years later due to the mysteries of the Najin.






 How Jang Tae-sang &amp; Yoon Chae-ok Can Return In Gyeongseong Creature Season 2 
          

Having Park Seo-jun and Han So-hee reprise their Gyeongseong Creature characters now in a modern-day setting would be a great way to reinvent the show and do something very different while still keeping the essence of the first season. The love story between Tae-sang and Chae-ok was the driving force of Gyeongseong Creature, yet there is still a lot to be explored about their characters and their relationship. Therefore, having the actors play descendants of Tae-sang and Chae-ok in season 2 would not work, especially because it would mean those two never got together and went on to have separate families.

                  Lady Maeda’s Plan &amp; Fate In Gyeongseong Creature Explained   Gyeongseong Creature’s Lady Maeda, played by Claudia Kim, was revealed to be way more powerful and dangerous than anyone could have imagined.    




The easiest way to bring back Chae-ok and Tae-sang for a story set in 2024 is to establish that those infected with the Najin age much slower than the average human, thus explaining why both of them still look the same. Chae-ok was infected in the final scene of season 1, during which her mother, now a creature, transferred the organism into her daughter to save her life. Whether Tae-sang is infected has yet to be confirmed, but there were plenty of clues during Gyeongseong Creature Part 2 that suggested he was the one who drank the glass of contaminated water.



 Gyeongseong Creature Season 2 Is Basically A New Show (&amp; That’s Great) 
         

Regardless of whether Park Seo-jun and Han So-hee are still playing their season 1 character, Gyeongseong Creature 2 will essentially be a different show. Much of the series’ plot had to do with the historical context of 1945, including but not limited to the final days of Japan&#39;s colonial rule over Korea and the experiments conducted by Unit 731. Even though season 1 features a couple of scenes set in an immediate post-World War II Korea, jumping to 2024 changes everything. Additionally, from a narrative standpoint, those who were interested in Gyeongseong Creature because of the show’s period piece nature may have reservations about an entirely new setting.




That said, taking the show in a whole new direction through such a massive plot twist is an interesting approach that can pay off. Gyeongseong Creature has included fantastical and sci-fi elements from the start, meaning characters not aging for 80 years or even actual time travel would not be too far-fetched for the show. A modern setting also allows the K-drama series to explore the chemistry between its two leads under different circumstances, which will be even better if they are still playing the same characters. Gyeongseong Creature season 2’s timeline raises a lot of questions, but it already sounds promising.
