## Literature Review
Glow Up alum Stacey Dooley&#39;s departure and replacement before season 3 inspired many questions. What happened to the original host?




Glow Up: Britain&#39;s Next Make-Up Star&#39;s original host, Stacey Dooley, left after season 3, and it&#39;s time to talk about why she was replaced. The fifth season finished airing in June 2023, but there&#39;s still questions regarding what happened to the original host. The shocking news broke in October 2020, when Stacey took to social media to say that she would no longer be hosting the popular makeup transformation series. In January 2021, TV personality and model Maya Jama was confirmed to host Glow Up. While Stacey made it seem like she was leaving the show on her own terms, it seems more like she was forced out. Fans believe that she was fired.




Glow Up follows 10 young makeup artists in the UK, who are competing against each other to become the next big makeup star in Britain. They&#39;re trying to win a contract assisting some of the world&#39;s top makeup artists. The show airs on BBC and Netflix. Stacey&#39;s departure was shocking, and led to rumors regarding why she was given the boot.


 Stacey Dooley Was Allegedly Fired From Glow Up 
          

Stacey was fired after appearing in a Clairol campaign in July 2020. The ad aired shortly after Glow Up season 2 concluded, and left her bosses infuriated. Once BBC higher-ups found out that she had broken the broadcaster&#39;s rules by starring in a beauty ad, she was let go. As per The Sun, BBC felt that Stacey&#39;s ad for Clairol mimicked her role as the host of Glow Up. Glow Up season 3 cast members were unaware of the change before filming, and they were shocked when they found out. According to the Daily Mail, the BBC has strict rules about the types of ads that its stars can appear in while under contract by the broadcaster. Stacey has remained quiet about the issue.






 Stacey Returned To BBC After Her Glow Up Firing 
          

Stacey&#39;s firing was a minor setback for the journalist. Her dismissal was a tricky situation for the broadcasters as Stacey is a BBC mainstay. Ultimately, the network gave her a second chance. She is the new host of a BBC cooking show called Hungry For It. The series will search for up-and-coming culinary talent. A source told The Sun, &#34;Stacey&#39;s warmth and support towards the contestants on Glow Up created a feel-good series which producers want to bring to this new show.&#34; 

The former host made it clear that she has no bad blood with anyone, and even congratulated Maya on her new role. Stacey wished Maya luck as the new host, saying, &#34;You&#39;re going to smash it!&#34; Maya responded, &#34;Like she&#39;s been amazing, and she&#39;s doing incredible...so I think it was a nice crossover.&#34; Maya quit the show less than two years later, but the next Glow Up host, Leomie Anderson, was up for the challenge.
