<p>John Billingsley Discusses TrekTalk 3, The Importance Of The Hollywood Food Coalition &amp; Star Trek</p>
<p>Screen Rant: John, we&rsquo;re here to talk about TrekTalks 3. It&rsquo;s the first big Star Trek event of 2024. Coming up this Saturday, January 13, starting at 9:45am Pacific on TrekTalks.net and YouTube. Over 60 Star Trek guests joining panels, and it&rsquo;s hosted by you and Bonnie Gordon of Star Trek: Prodigy. All to benefit the Hollywood Food Coalition.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: My job is done. You have eliminated my purpose in life. Yes, exactly. All of that is correct.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s all the time we have. But seriously, please tell us a little bit about the good and important work of the Hollywood Food Coalition.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Delighted to. Yes, Hollywood Food Coalition has been around for about 37 years. And it started by providing street service to people in need in West Hollywood and Hollywood, and eventually decided to move its services indoors. So we&rsquo;ve been serving a hot, nutritious, multicourse meal every night of the week for 37 years. We haven&rsquo;t missed a night. But one of the things I like to underline and point to is about five or six years ago, we started rescuing and sharing more food with other social service organizations.
We have dramatically expanded that capacity. So we are now rescuing about 3 million pounds of food a year. And we share it on kind of a concierge level basis with about 150 other groups. And what we&rsquo;re really trying to do is make sure that small to medium-sized nonprofits, doing really cool things working with their clients, have the food and the resources they need to make sure that their folks are taken care of. For instance, just to pick something out of a hat, [there&rsquo;s] an organization that works with street kids.
We make sure that they, for the number of kids [being helped], they get adequate food, ample provisions, and we arrange to make sure that it is delivered in a timely fashion. So a lot of what we&rsquo;re trying to do is kind of augment and buttress the programs of other partner organizations to kind of help knit together raveled social services net.</p>
<p>Hollywood Food Coalition is a place people can go to to get meals, but then are there also deliveries?</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Essentially, we have our own kitchen. And people have been coming to us, again, for 37 years now. We feed or take care of anywhere between 250 and 350 people a night. So they have a choice between a carnivore and vegetarian/vegan option. We always believe that people, for instance, who have been living on the streets who may not be accorded much empathy or respect, at least once a day, have the opportunity to come to us and choose what they might like to have for dinner. We always try and make sure we treat our guests with a maximum amount of compassion and dignity. These are folks who may only be getting to have one meal a day.
We try and help as we get to know them. A lot of the idea being that they come to us on a regular and consistent basis [and] that builds a relationship of trust. We can then introduce them to potential housing providers, folks who run drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers. The UCLA Medical Program brings a vision van, a dental van, a medical van to our campus. Always a medical van, the others are based more on availability and need. The exchange program, which is where the food all lands, a 10th of it, in essence, goes to our kitchen, a separate facility. That&rsquo;s where it lives before it can be allocated to other groups. Generally speaking, groups pick it up, [because] we&rsquo;re not really able to have a delivery service. That is certainly something to be sought for. But we do partner with groups that do deliver.
A lot of what we are interested in trying to do is to work with like-minded organizations. The nature of the need requires a lot of collaboration and coalition building, to rescue food, to share it, to refrigerate it, to store it, to transport it, to find it, to find the places it should go. That takes a whole cooperative enterprise of organizations. So that&rsquo;s a lot of what the vision is in the word &lsquo;coalition.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s finding ways to really identify the need and identify ways we can solve it collectively.</p>
<p>And then TrekTalks, of course, is a big help with fundraising. TrekTalks 2 last year raised $107,000.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: We&rsquo;ve made almost $250,000 in the first couple of years. And I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t really put a lot of the credit on Rod Roddenberry and the Roddenberry Foundation. They are a significant portion of our donations, and we owe so much to them for their support.</p>
<p>It must be so gratifying to see so many of the Star Trek community lending their support. In real life, Star Trek really lives up to the virtues it espouses. It&rsquo;s a very unique franchise in that way.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Exactly. And that was the impetus behind it. For me, having been in the franchise for a number of years, so much of what I&rsquo;ve loved is getting to know not just the celebs, but the fans who, as you say, they walk the walk. And the idea of Federation is not far removed from the idea of coalition. It&rsquo;s the same concept. And it&rsquo;s the same ethos and the same set of values undergirding both of those words. So yeah, the idea was, well, let&rsquo;s, let&rsquo;s kind of first see if we can marry these two entities. And it&rsquo;s been wonderful [to see] the response from everybody, and [it&rsquo;s] something that really excites me about continuing, because with time and better acquaintanceship, more and more people begin to know about us.
I also think the concept of &ldquo;Trektivism,&rdquo; which is a word we wanted to coin, and we wanted to share the idea that this organization does wonderful things for its community, and we love people&rsquo;s support. But there are wonderful organizations all over the country that are doing great work to try and respond to what I think in many respects is a crisis of conscience we are having in America, I think it&rsquo;s really important that people recognize that the best way they can respond to what they might consider to be depredations and depravities on a national level is by digging back in where they live to make their own community a better, stronger place.</p>
<p>I do believe, and Star Trek also feels this way, that inherently, most people are good. And most people want to help.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: I totally agree. I mean, I&rsquo;m not as much of an actor as I used to be. But when I do travel, and particularly if I&rsquo;m in places that are, you know&hellip; perhaps I&rsquo;m progressive. If I&rsquo;m having a conversation with somebody who&rsquo;s taking a different political point of view than mine, I sometimes find the best way to pivot is to say, &lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just talk about what you do in the world that is good. That you believe is virtuous, and that helps people in need.&rsquo; Because I&rsquo;ve never found anybody who doesn&rsquo;t think that they are doing something that is particularly worthy.
I try and take it outside of the political arena because there are a lot of people who believe they&rsquo;re doing good in the political arena. I think sometimes it&rsquo;s subject to discussion. But most people are also doing something that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have a political context that is actually making a difference in their community. Sometimes it&rsquo;s teaching a kid to read or picking up trash in the ocean. There&rsquo;s any number of ways folks can get involved and be involved. And I&rsquo;m always delighted to find that, in fact, most people are already doing cool sh*t.</p>
<p>You have a co-host, Bonnie Gordon from Star Trek: Prodigy, this year. She co-hosted you with last year as well. She&rsquo;s terrific. I bet Jerry Lewis wishes he had Bonnie co-hosting way back when.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Oh my gosh, I call it Jerry Lewis only because it&rsquo;s an easy handle for people to identify the idea of telethon. I am in no way of attempting to do what Jerry Lewis did. One, our appearances are kept to a relative minimum, and two, I have not the physical stamina nor the gifts that Mr. Lewis had. Bonnie on the show is an absolute gem, and a marvel, and a multitalented person. She&rsquo;s also going to be singing in one of our interstitial videos. We have a variety of little pre-filmed stories about the Hollywood Food Coalition and a couple of musical acts on tracks that separate the panels in the conversations.</p>
<p>What would you say are the must-see panels at TrekTalks 3?</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Must-see is going to have to be the Picard Season Three retrospective right in the middle of the afternoon, Terry Matalas, Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, Todd Stashwick, Jeri Ryan, Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn. Gates had had to step down because she had a conflict but she&rsquo;s back in again. The conflict resolved itself. So, an amazing panel. Jonathan del Arco moderating. Amy Imhoff is moderating a panel of women in STEM, and she&rsquo;s been able to get us some fabulous female scientists. The Syfy Sistas are moderating a panel that is about the legacy of Nichelle Nichols, Michelle Hurd, and a number of other people who&rsquo;ve played seminal roles in Star Trek history.
We always kind of want to do it around Martin Luther King, Jr.&rsquo;s birthday weekend, because the Syfy Sistas are marvelous partners and have fabulous things they want to bring to the table that are resonant in our culture right now. And that&rsquo;s also social justice, which is, I think, some of what Star Trek is all about. So those three things pop out. But I&rsquo;d also be remiss to not talk about a panel we have in the early part of the day, which is going to be about the famous crossover episode between Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds. Again with Mr. Frakes, Tawny Newsome, and the writers of that episode, Kathryn Lyn and Bill Wolkoff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about that. Now, you saw the crossover. I wanted to get your opinion about that. Because there was a lot of reverence for Enterprise in the crossover.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: I&rsquo;ve been asked this a fair amount, and I&rsquo;m fearful that people are going to think, &ldquo;Shut up trying to get a job, Billingsley!&rdquo; because that certainly isn&rsquo;t my intention. However, it has been noted that Denobulans are very long-lived. So theoretically, I could be floating by on a space frigate and somebody could call me onboard, either in an animated realm or in an actual realm.</p>
<p>I mean, that&rsquo;s literally how Scotty ended up on the Enterprise on TNG like 30 years ago. That&rsquo;s basically what happened. Let me put you on the spot a little bit. Besides Dr. Phlox, who are the best doctors in Star Trek?</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Well, let&rsquo;s see. Of course, you know, I think we can all agree that Bob Picardo is certainly right near the bottom. You didn&rsquo;t see that coming. No, I adore Bobby. He&rsquo;s a dear friend of mine. And he famously sent me an email one day that said, &lsquo;Hey, John, I just saw this poll, I thought you might be interested to know that you were voted the least popular Star Trek doctor.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s like, wait a second. Just because you saw it doesn&rsquo;t mean you need to share it. And it turns out that was a poll conducted just within his family. So I discount that.
You&rsquo;ve got to put, of course, McCoy at the top because he was the groundbreaker. Dr. Crusher, too. I&rsquo;m not as conversant with the entire spectrum of Star Trek, so I&rsquo;m not particularly versed on Deep Space Nine, so I couldn&rsquo;t tell where Dr. Bashir lands. I will say recently, the Denobulans were voted the seventh most popular alien species and I have to take a certain amount of credit for that.</p>
<p>I think you should take 100% of the credit for that. Who are the other famous Denobulans?</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Well, exactly. Feezal, my missus, she was the sexiest Denobulan. I believe me, it was an amazing responsibility to actually have to conjure a species. You know, if you&rsquo;re a cast as a Klingon or a Vulcan or an Andorian, you&rsquo;ve got the parameters already established. Denobulans were like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know! No idea! I&rsquo;ll make it up as I go along and hope the species sticks.&rsquo;
I did pitch to them - I&rsquo;ve mentioned this on several podcasts because it amuses me to no end even though it seems to amuse nobody else - I pitched to them that they should pick up an abandoned spacecraft, and it&rsquo;s full of Denobulans. We&rsquo;re stuck, and they bring us on board. And we&rsquo;re all like Oscar Madison, we leave our dirty underpants lying around. We eat all the food. We&rsquo;re shagging each other in public. It&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Get them off the ship!&rsquo; But they all look like me. This way, I would be guaranteed if they ever wanted to use Denobulans again, it&rsquo;s like, you gotta use me.</p>
<p>Well, that sounds like a Star Trek: Lower Decks plot. That&rsquo;s basically an entire episode laid out.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Yeah, there you go. There you go. Maybe they should hire me as a writer. Because God knows people on Enterprise didn&rsquo;t want my ideas. Picardo used to hide in the flower bushes on Voyager and jump out and assault them with ideas, and they had no choice. They had no choice. &lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll sing opera&rsquo;.&rsquo; All right. I&rsquo;ll have an affair with Jeri Ryan, fine, fine, fine.&rsquo; For me, they cut down all the rose bushes so they wouldn&rsquo;t have that problem again, one. And then two, I was shyer than Bob was. I tried to insert my oar in the water periodically, but they locked the door, is what they did. I would slip my ideas under the door, and they would slide right back out again.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this as the attending physician: Trip Tucker, is he dead or alive?</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Well, he&rsquo;s pretty dead. He&rsquo;s pretty dead. But he was cloned once, you know. I mean, the Doctor always managed to keep some odd thing he pulled out of his ass. It&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been I&rsquo;ve been hoarding this old gasher. We could take this, and we can insert it into his ear, and then he could grow a second head.&rsquo; So never say never. I did feel, as I suspect many fans did, that that was not an adequate send-off for a beloved character. In many ways, Connor [Trinneer] was the heart of that show. And I personally thought, of all the things that were problematic about that final episode, the most problematic was: Don&rsquo;t kill Trip in such a particularly ignoble fashion. It was not a death that was in line witth - it wasn&rsquo;t like he would die to save the galaxy. So yeah, I&rsquo;m sure all the fans think that in their hearts, he&rsquo;s still alive. Certainly.</p>
<p>I think so. I mean, we would love to see him again. That&rsquo;s kind of segues into what I was going to ask you next. It&rsquo;s 2024. It&rsquo;s a brand new year full of possibilities. Now, I know you would be sworn to secrecy if this was the case, but could this be the year we see some sort of Enterprise comeback somehow?</p>
<p>John Billingsley: I doubt very much that Enterprise itself could or would ever come back. I mean, there are just too many issues with it. Scott [Bakula] has moved on. He&rsquo;s always got a jillion projects in the works. Jolene [Blalock] married, had three kids, and has, I think, more or less retired from the business. I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s in touch with her. I suppose you can solve the problem that Trip is dead. Maybe you could just bring me back. And it could just be Old Fat Phlox, which is the show I&rsquo;ve also pitched for many years, where I&rsquo;m just sitting on a rocking chair on the porch going, &lsquo;Back in the day when I was having intergalactic adventures&hellip;&rsquo;
And then, in flashback, you&rsquo;d see all those adventures unwinding and come back to me at the end. Stay tuned for another episode of Old Fat Phlox. I&rsquo;d be number one on the call sheet, I&rsquo;d make a lot of money, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to work that hard. I&rsquo;d sign up for that. This, too, was an idea that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be getting much traction, I&rsquo;m finding, in the Star Trek community, but you know, one can try.</p>
<p>I think they just lack the vision.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: It&rsquo;s the absence of vision. I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. I mean, I&rsquo;m available, put it that way. After I do TrekTalks I do a lot of work with the Hollywood Food Coalition. And so all through the year, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of development activity I&rsquo;m involved in. But generally speaking, my acting career is sort of backburnered. So it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve got some other gig that I&rsquo;d have to figure out how to navigate. But I&rsquo;m so desperate now, John! Oh my God! I&rsquo;m joking! I&rsquo;m very happy! I&rsquo;m very happy.</p>
<p>Well, we have 20 new episodes of Star Trek: Prodigy coming to Netflix. 10 new Lower Decks coming up later this year. I love to see what Dr. Phlox looks like in either animation style.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Well, he&rsquo;s fat. I can tell you that he&rsquo;s definitely fat, and then they&rsquo;re just gonna have to live with that. You know, as I said to my doctor, every one of these pounds was well-earned, and they&rsquo;re very reluctant to be shed. Beyond that, I&rsquo;d like to think his sensibility hasn&rsquo;t changed much. I mean, I think he&rsquo;s probably tickled that he&rsquo;s still hanging on at the age of 243 or whatever the hell he is. People ask me, &lsquo;What do you think Dr. Phlox did in retirement?&rsquo;
I guess there is actually now a version of Dr. Phlox&rsquo;s future already written out, so far be it for me to deny what the writers have come up with, which is infinitely more heroic than anything I would have come up with. In my world , I thought he wrote a few cookbooks, he did a lot of travel, and he knows where all the beach resorts are. He saw the plague every now and again in his spare time, but basically, he&rsquo;s a retiree. Wherever the intergalactic version of Florida is, that&rsquo;s where you can find the guy.</p>
<p>I think Star Trek Picard season 3 established that the intergalactic version of Florida is actually Florida. Because that&rsquo;s where Riker and Troi decided to go on their second honeymoon. Going back to TrekTalks and also on the subject of animation, another cool panel I&rsquo;m looking forward to is the Producing Star Trek panel with Dan and Kevin Hagman, Aaron Waltke, and your old boss, Brannon Braga.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Absolutely. Yeah, we were elated that Brannon was able to do it. To actually make it feasible to do, we needed to kind of pre-tape that one because Brannon&rsquo;s availability was limited. So we have that now in the can. We do that for a few panels. Generally speaking, the event is live and we love the live atmosphere. But there are instances where, if we&rsquo;re gonna be able to get somebody cool, and it&rsquo;s about a pre-tape, we&rsquo;ll do that. And so, I&rsquo;m as eager as you are to listen to that. When I listen to them all, I usually end up having to listen to them after the fact. I&rsquo;ll watch the tape the next day, because during the running of the show, it&rsquo;s about making sure that every fire is getting put out. And so, I don&rsquo;t have the luxury of being able to kind of kick back and watch.</p>
<p>Well, on Saturday, I&rsquo;ll be watching TrekTalks 3 and chipping in a donation. I hope you have a great successful show, and I hope you blow the totals out of the water. And I hope everybody tunes in to watch.</p>
<p>John Billingsley: Bless you. Bless you. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for doing this. Everything we can do to get the word out is a huge difference maker and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for taking the time. Absolutely.</p>
