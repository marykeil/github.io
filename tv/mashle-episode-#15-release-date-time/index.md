 What Happened In Mashle: Magic And Muscles Episode #14? 
          




In Mashle: Magic and Muscles episode #14, “Mash Burnedead and the Home Visit”, Wahlberg and Rayne pleaded for Mash’s execution to be delayed because of his mysterious connection to Innocent Zero and because they believe he has the right to live. While they remained apprehensive, the Divine Visionaries eventually agreed to postpone Mash’s execution under the condition that he succeeds at becoming Easton’s Divine Visionary candidate. Later, to celebrate Mash’s survival, his friends took him out on the town which lead to Mash getting a magic wand so heavy no one had moved it for 1000 years.

Later, Mash took everyone to visit his grandfather who, while confused by everyone’s quirks, was happy that Mash had made some friends. As everyone played at Mash’s house, Orca House prefect Margarette Macaron headed toward Mash’s house to fight him and make him incapable of taking the Divine Visionary exam. Before he could get there, however, Rayne Ames intercepted Margarette, and Mashle: Magic and Muscles episode #14 ended with a fight about to break out between them in order for Rayne to protect Mash.

With the way Mashle: Magic and Muscles episode #14 ended, it’s plain to see that the series is setting up a true fight between high-level magic users. Up until now, Mash has been the only one fighting the stronger level of magic users in the anime, but with Rayne and Margarette about to fight, this will be the first time the anime will show what a battle between two incredibly powerful magic users is like in terms of seriousness and scale. There’s bound to be a lot of spectacle attached to something like that, and it’s bound to make Mashle: Magic and Muscles episode #15 great to watch.
