## Literature Review
A clip for Fire Country season 2 confirms a time jump, revealing how long Max Theriot’s Bode has been behind bars and how he feels about it.




A clip for Fire Country season 2 confirms a time jump. Debuting on CBS in October 2022 with the trio of Max Thieriot, Tony Phelan, and Joan Rater as creators, Fire Country centers on Bode Donovan (Thieriot), a convict with a troubled past. To redeem himself and shorten his prison sentence, he volunteers for Cal Fire. But in the twisty Fire Country season 1 ending, Bode ends up back in prison. Though he&#39;s done nothing wrong, he accepts the blame so that his friend Freddy (W. Tre Davis) can go free.




A new clip for the upcoming season, via CBS, reveals that Bode has been behind bars for six months. Despite the time jump, and the fact that he&#39;s in prison for drugs he didn&#39;t even take, he doesn&#39;t seem in any particular hurry to leave.


 

In a previous Fire Country season 2 clip, Bode is shown getting into fights behind bars, and ominously, he mentions on the phone that he doesn&#39;t have much time. In the new preview, however, the character puts on a brave face and claims that prison is where he belongs.



Fire Country season 2 debuts Friday, February 16 at 9 PM ET on CBS.








 Bode Will Meet New Characters In Fire Country Season 2 
          

Fire Country season 2 will feature several new characters. That includes Empire and Dynasty reboot actor Rafael de la Fuente, who has joined the CBS show for at least three episodes. De la Fuente will play Diego, described as a charming and motivated paramedic and firefighter, in addition to a combat vet who served in Afghanistan. Diego will train Gabriela (Stephanie Arcila) for her paramedic certification. The two will reportedly hit it off, which could make Bode worry, given that the shocking season 1 finale drove a bit of a wedge between him and Gabriela.

Fire Country is also building to a potential spinoff, which would be focused on a sheriff. In the upcoming episodes, a new woman character will be introduced and it could be that she&#39;s the sheriff who&#39;ll lead the spinoff. But plans are flexible, and the new character could ultimately end up remaining with the main series instead. The sheriff will begin as a guest star but could later become a regular, and a decision could also be made to focus on a different character for the spinoff.




                  Fire Country Season 2 Couldn’t Happen Without That Bode Twist   The shocking twist changes things in a fundamental way for Bode, but it also guarantees interesting developments for Fire Country season 2.    

At least the premiere of Fire Country, though, will take time to take care of the fallout from Bode&#39;s decision to protect his friend. Even if the CBS drama eventually does shift its focus, with Bode&#39;s name getting cleared, it&#39;s possible that the ramifications of his well-intentioned lie could linger for the rest of the season.
