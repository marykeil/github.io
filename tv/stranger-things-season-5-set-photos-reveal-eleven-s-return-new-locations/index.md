## Literature Review

New set photos from Stranger Things season 5 have made their way online, showing the first look at Elevenâ€™s return and unveiling new locations.




Stranger Things season 5 set photos have been shared online, unveiling the return of Millie Bobby Brown&#39;s Eleven and providing a first look at some new locations. First hitting Netflix in 2016, the Duffer Brothers&#39; hit fantasy horror series returned for season 4 in 2022, which proved to be the most popular one yet. The Stranger Things season 4 finale ended with a fairly major cliffhanger, and season 5, which is confirmed to be the show&#39;s last, is now in production.




Now, as the wait continues for Stranger Things season 5, new set photos shared by Stranger Things Spoilers on X unveil a touching scene between Eleven and Finn Wolfhard&#39;s Mike. Check out the images below:


 

Co-creator Ross Duffer also shared his own behind-the-scenes look at the new season on Instagram, posting a carousel of images that includes a peek at some new and returning locations, and a different look at Eleven and Mike. View Duffer&#39;s images below:


 

  





 What Do The Stranger Things Season 5 Set Photos Reveal? 
          

While not much can be gleaned from the Eleven and Mike photos, it&#39;s nice to see the duo reunited again after the explosive events of Stranger Things season 4. Their relationship was a central focus in the previous batch of episodes, and the series&#39; final outing seems poised to further explore whether the Mike and Eleven bond can stand the test of time (and a massive incursion from the Upside Down in Hawkins).



It&#39;s been teased previously that Stranger Things season 5 is set to feature a time jump, but the latest images don&#39;t provide any indication of how long this time jump might be.




The images shared by Ross Duffer reveal a bit more, but, out of context, mostly just tease some new locations and callbacks. Notably, the images include a look at what appears to be the Wheeler family home basement, albeit with a bit of a makeover compared to how it looked in season 1. There&#39;s also a staircase in what could be a warehouse or industrial-type of building, though it&#39;s not yet clear what role this building will play in the new season.




In addition to an image of a bicycle on a high school running track and a Halley&#39;s Comet decal, Duffer also shares a look at Brown and Wolfhard walking through a field. The field appears similar to the one featured prominently in season 3 and the end of season 4, though it&#39;s difficult to tell considering the change in seasons. Finally, Duffer&#39;s post reveals that they&#39;ve now completed 10 days of filming. Many questions remain about what is to come for the cast of Stranger Things in season 5, but the new images are sure to only build excitement.



With filming currently underway, Stranger Things season 5 is on track to release at some point during 2025.
