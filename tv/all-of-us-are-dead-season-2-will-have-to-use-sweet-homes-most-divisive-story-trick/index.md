Summary

  All of Us Are Dead season 2 is likely to include a time skip, similar to Sweet Home season 2, to address the aging of the actors and add new elements to the story.   The challenge for All of Us Are Dead season 2 is to continue the story without immediately resolving the cliffhanger from season 1 and slowly revealing new information about the characters.   Learning from the pitfalls of Sweet Home season 2, All of Us Are Dead should provide enough context and development for its existing characters while expanding the show&#39;s original premise with new characters and plotlines.  





All of Us Are Dead season 2 will have to use a divisive narrative trick that brought a lot of criticism for Sweet Home. Two of the best Korean shows on Netflix, Sweet Home and All of Us Are Dead share many similarities. The idea of young characters trying to survive a monster outbreak while confined in their home or school can make for a fun story, and both shows did it extremely well. Just like the first seasons of both series mirrored each other in a lot of ways, All of Us Are Dead’s second season may be similar to Sweet Home’s newest installment in terms of worldbuilding.




Like All of Us Are Dead, Sweet Home’s cast features many important characters, most of which have their own mini story arcs told across the show. Both shows successfully got viewers invested in their characters, which is why taking the series in new directions can be risky. The announcement of a second season of All of Us Are Dead was not surprising, but the show will now have to solve a tricky challenge.

                  10 Biggest All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Theories   From Cheong-san’s return to Nam-ra leading the halfbies, the biggest theories for All of Us Are Dead season 2 try to make sense of season 1’s finale.    

 All of Us Are Dead cast   Actor  Character   Park Ji-hu  Onjo   Yoon Chan-young  Lee Cheong-san   Cho Yi-hyun  Choi Nam-ra   Lomon  Lee Su-hyeok   Yoo In-soo  Yoon Gwi-nam   Lee Yoo-mi  Lee Na-yeon   Kim Byung-chul  Lee Byeong-chan   Lee Kyu-hyung  Song Jae-ik   Jeon Bae-soo  Nam So-ju   







 All Of Us Are Dead Season 2 Will Likely Include A Time Skip (Like Sweet Home Did) 
         

Considering that more than two years will have passed by the time All of Us Are Dead returns, season 2 will likely include a time skip to make up for the actors aging out of their characters. This is exactly the approach taken by Sweet Home season 2, which premiered three years after the first season. It must be noted that All of Us Are Dead season 1’s finale already included a time skip, although not a significant one. The final scenes of episode 12, during which Nam-ra reunited with her friends, took place a couple of months after the city was bombarded.


 




Things were relatively well for the surviving All of Us Are Dead characters at the end of season 1, as they were now living in a quarantine zone and had learned Nam-ra was okay. Therefore, for season 2 to have any sort of conflict right away, it cannot begin exactly where season 1 ended. Additionally, the cliffhanger of Nam-ra revealing she is now living with other halfbies should not be addressed too soon. All of Us Are Dead season 2’s story will probably center on Nam-ra and the halfbies, meaning everything about them should be slowly revealed as the season progresses. But a time jump like Sweet Home’s is risky.



 Why Sweet Home Season 2’s Time Skip Was So Divisive 
          

Sweet Home season 2, episode 4 starts one year after the previous three episodes and the end of season 1. Not only was the time skip shocking, but it was also the symbol of how much the show was about to change. Most of Sweet Home season 2’s new characters, of which there were many, were introduced after the time skip. Suddenly, audiences no longer knew where their favorite characters were, and the show was now trying to make them care about unfamiliar heroes and villains. Most importantly, Song Kang’s Hyun-su, Sweet Home’s main character, was nowhere to be seen after the time jump.




Sweet Home was bound to become a very different series after season 1 considering it had already covered most of the source material. The show needed to reinvent itself and introduce new players that could be important later, not to mention how the younger characters aging three years between seasons needed to be addressed. The reasons why Sweet Home went for a time skip are similar to the challenges All of Us Are Dead is facing, including that the zombie series already adapted most of the webtoon it is based on. Still, as Sweet Home just proved, nailing a time skip is not easy.



Though Hyun-su was absent from most of Sweet Home season 2, he returned in episode 6 where it was revealed that he left to walk his own path after losing a fight against Ui-myeong.






 How All Of Us Are Dead Season 2’s Time Skip Can Work Better Than Sweet Home’s 
          




The biggest problem with Sweet Home season 2 is not necessarily the time skip but what happened after it. Revisiting the show’s main characters in the near future without showing what happened during that year is not a problem by itself, and many stories benefit from similar narrative tricks. However, Sweet Home offered little to no context regarding what happened during that skipped year, leaving viewers to pick up the clues while also introducing new stories. From episode 4 onward, Sweet Home became too convoluted and sidelined some of its most important characters, including Hyun-su. This is a mistake All of Us Are Dead cannot make.

There is a lot All of Us Are Dead’s upcoming season can learn from Sweet Home, as the former will have to find a way to expand the show beyond its original premise just like the latter did. However, what gives All of Us Are Dead the advantage is that season 1 was a relatively self-contained story. It can even be argued that the zombie K-drama series did not need to continue, meaning a time skip would not be getting in the way of important reveals or character development. Sweet Home, on the other hand, had way too many ongoing plotlines before its abrupt change.
