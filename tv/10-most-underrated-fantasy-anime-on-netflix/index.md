## Literature Review
Despite not receiving as much acclaim as some other popular titles, these underrated fantasy anime deserve to be on every fan&#39;s radar as well.




As one of the most popular streaming services worldwide, Netflix has increasingly established itself as a great place to watch anime, not only making various titles available for subscribers, but also actively contributing to the creation of successful, groundbreaking works such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. While its catalog covers all themes and genres, fans who are particularly keen on fantasy may be wondering what the most underrated fantasy anime on Netflix are.
In a medium that lends itself to creative and imaginative settings as much as anime does, there are plenty of options when it comes to worthwhile fantasy titles. However, while every fan is familiar with popular titles such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Sword Art Online, many other entertaining shows never get the chance to be in the spotlight. From historical to futuristic settings, fantasy stories can take place in just about any kind of world, making them appealing to any anime fan, regardless of personal preferences.
As the Netflix catalog varies across different countries, the availability of these titles likewise depends on one&#39;s region and cannot be fully guaranteed. 










 








 10  Magi: Adventure of Sinbad (2016) 
Produced by Lay-duce and Based on the Manga by Shinobu Ootaka &amp; Yoshifumi Ootera
        

In the impoverished Tison Village of the Parthevia Empire, Sinbad&#39;s birth causes a significant fluctuation in the Rukh, prompting others to call him the &#34;Child of Destiny&#34;. When mysterious dungeons begin showing up around the world, he is immediately drawn to these and the supposed powers and treasures promised to those who can conquer them. Embarking on a journey that will eventually lead to him becoming the famous High King of the Seven Seas, Sinbad seeks not only glory and power for himself, but also to assemble reliable, like-minded allies.
Although this title is technically a prequel to the more popular Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, fans may have missed it due to its different focus and subsequent release date. Those who appreciate Sinbad&#39;s character are sure to enjoy Magi: Adventure of Sinbad, but even those who don&#39;t particularly favor him should find his evolution compelling, as his fantastical journey, set in a truly unique world influenced by classic folktales, is full of memorable exploits and intriguing characters, making it one of the best adventure anime.

 9  Edens Zero (2021) 
Produced by J.C.Staff and Based on the Manga by Hiro Mashima


 







At Granbell Kingdom, the eponymous Shiki Granbell lives a simple yet content life, surrounded by machines. Meanwhile, Rebecca Bluegarden is a rather unsuccessful B-Cuber, who spends her time creating various videos for her B-Cube channel alongside Happy, her companion. As Rebecca decides to visit the Granbell Kingdom in search of new content, she soon befriends Shiki, deciding to embark on a grand adventure together, seeking to meet new friends and explore the galaxy, perhaps even to find Mother, the Goddess of the Cosmos.
Regarded by many as a mere copy of the creator&#39;s more popular Fairy Tail, this title is often unfairly overlooked. While certain ideas and characters definitely resemble those of the author&#39;s earlier works, Edens Zero still stands on its own as a delightful story, distinguished through original additions and twists. It may suffer from excessive fan service, but those who don&#39;t mind such scenes are sure to find an interesting fantastical story that is uniquely set against the backdrop of a creative sci-fi world.

 8  Vampire in the Garden (2022) 
Original Series Produced by Wit Studio
        

In a world where the ongoing war between vampires and humans is decidedly dominated by the creatures of the night, the remaining human survivors settle in a small town surrounded by a huge wall of light. Despite being the queen of vampires, Fine&#39;s opinions differ from most, disagreeing with the war. After a fateful encounter with a human teenager who shares her view on the conflict between their races, Momo, the two of them set out to find Paradise, a place where humans and vampires are said to be able to peacefully coexist.
This title primarily suffers from its limited number of episodes, which don&#39;t allow for the expansive worldbuilding that such an intriguing premise deserves. However, those willing to accept that this experience ends sooner than they may like are likely to find that Vampire in the Garden tells a beautiful and deeply emotional story, complete with unpredictable twists, and aided by gorgeous animation.

 7  Heaven Official&#39;s Blessing (2020) 
Produced by Haoliners Animation and Based on the Web Novel by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu


 







Once a powerful, beloved martial god, known as the Crown Prince of the Xian Le kingdom, Xie Lian was unceremoniously demoted due to unfortunate reasons. Despite finally returning to the heavenly realm, he no longer holds the influence he once had, with no followers worshiping him. During one of his missions to sustain his divinity, he finds himself guided by the elusive Hua Cheng, a fearsome Ghost King who eventually becomes his loyal companion.
While many anime fans may have missed it due to it being a donghua that was not nearly as promoted as other similar titles were, Heaven Official&#39;s Blessing stands out thanks to its intricate world, captivating character relationships, and stunning visuals. Given the difference in scope, this adaptation naturally leaves out some details of the original beloved web novel, which may negatively affect the overall pacing, but it remains a one-of-a-kind experience that should particularly appeal to fans of LGBTQ&#43; anime.
The creator of the Heaven Official&#39;s Blessing web novel also authored The Founder of Diabolism, which received a fantastic anime adaptation.

 6  Dorohedoro (2020) 
Produced by MAPPA and Based on the Manga by Q Hayashida
        

The Hole is a dark, grim place, used by Magic Users as some type of anarchic testing ground where anything goes. With no laws or otherwise enforced ethics to bind them, they regularly experiment on defenseless humans, or even murder them, as they see fit. After one of their victims, Kaiman, has his head transformed into a lizard one, he sets out to hunt Magic Users and find the one responsible for his curse, together with Nikaido, his companion, and owner of the Hungry Bug restaurant.
Dorohedoro is a unique title as far as the fantasy genre goes, providing an experience that is as gruesome as it is amusing. It is certainly far from unknown, but it still tends to be underappreciated, with other, more popular works outshining it despite not necessarily being objectively superior in any way. Some viewers may find the CGI animation unappealing, but the title&#39;s exceptional story, characters, and world should more than compensate for the contentious art choice.
The creator of the Dorohedoro manga also authored Dai Dark, which, despite not having received an anime adaptation, is an absolutely fantastic work that likewise blends comedy with horror.

 5  Lost Song (2018) 
Original Series Produced by LIDENFILMS
        

Rin lives a happy, comfortable life in a peaceful, remote village together with her loving family, while Finis lives in solitude in the royal palace. The two girls may seem to have little in common, but they share the unique power of songs, thanks to which they are able to bring about miraculous events, such as healing deep wounds and creating water where there is none. As Rin experiences a tragic development that prompts her to travel to the capital, while Finis struggles to accept her life and feelings of love, their destinies may prove to intersect in more ways than one.
Lost Song is a truly remarkable title that differentiates itself through its unique story and unexpected twists. It may not necessarily be a masterpiece, but fans of the title acknowledge it as one of the more memorable ones out there, even with all of its flaws. The characters are far from revolutionary, but the story, art, and musical performances allow the title to stand out, even in a rather crowded genre.

 4  A Lull in the Sea (2013) 
Original Series Produced by P.A. Works


 







Once, every human lived on the ocean floor. However, as some became curious about life on the surface and abandoned their old lives, they consequently lost the god-given protection that allowed them to breathe underwater, slowly but surely causing a great rift between those who stayed and those who left. It is exactly these differences that a group of middle school students is about to deal with, as they are forced to leave their school and attend one on the surface, struggling with deep-seated discrimination and new emotions along the way.
Despite lacking the exposure it deserves, possibly due to some fans perceiving it as a seemingly generic title, A Lull in the Sea tells a complex, deeply emotional tale, set against the backdrop of an intricate world, defined by unique dynamics and perspectives. Not only is it one of the more remarkable drama/romance titles, but it is also one of the best coming-of-age anime, comparable to more popular works such as Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day.

 3  Children of the Whales (2017) 
Produced by J.C.Staff and Based on the Manga by Abi Umeda
        

In a seemingly endless sea of sand, humans reside on floating islands. One such island is the Mud Whale, most of whose inhabitants are cursed with the ability to use thymia, which, despite allowing them to move objects with their minds, also tends to lead to an untimely death. As the archivist of the Mud Whale, it is up to Chakuro to document new discoveries, but he rarely comes across anything significant - that is, at least, until he meets a mysterious girl, who, unbeknownst to him, is going to challenge everything he knows about the world.
Though it may suffer from slow pacing and a story that ends before fully exploring every question that is raised, Children of the Whales remains a particularly enjoyable title for fans of the fantasy genre, who are sure to be drawn in by its intricate world and factions. As much as it would have benefited from a longer runtime, so as to allow it to develop into the complex and compelling experience that it had the potential to become, its vibrant art style and original story make it noteworthy nonetheless.

 2  My Happy Marriage (2023) 
Produced by Kinema Citrus and Based on the Light Novel by Akumi Agitogi &amp; Tsukiho Tsukioka


 







Miyo Saimori&#39;s life has always been marked by tragedy, as she was born from an arranged marriage only to lose her mother at a young age. Thereafter being treated as nothing but a servant and an intruder to her remarried father&#39;s family, she couldn&#39;t do anything but accept her abusive situation, unable to fight back. When she hears that she is to be married to Kiyoka Kudou, a noble yet supposedly cruel soldier, her life seems to be only getting worse. However, as she gets to know him and the two open up to each other, Miyo&#39;s initial impressions of Kiyoka may prove incorrect.
While its genre is somewhat hidden initially, with the emphasis being placed on the relationship between the leading couple instead, My Happy Marriage slowly introduces fantasy elements to its already compelling story, making it that much more intriguing. From the original historical fantasy setting to the touching elements of human drama, there are plenty of reasons why this title is not one to be overlooked, whether by fans of fantasy or any other genre.

Original Series Produced by Trigger

Prompted by this dream, she enrolls at the Luna Nova Academy, where she soon learns just how much of a disadvantage she is at compared to her peers, due to not coming from a magical family. However, Akko is not the type to get discouraged easily, as she continues to chase her dreams, no matter how challenging her adventures with her friends may be.
While its story may be far from revolutionary, Little Witch Academia is simply the perfect title for fantasy fans, emphasizing the appeal of magic above all. Not only does Akko remind viewers of the childlike sense of wonder befitting of magic, but the other characters are also interesting and surprisingly developed. Featuring a stellar art style on top of everything, this is not only one of the best Studio Trigger anime, but also one of the most underrated fantasy anime out there.
