## Literature Review
Our Flag Means Death season 3 was supposed to end the hilarious pirate story, but now it likely won&#39;t happen due to HBO&#39;s cancelation.




Our Flag Means Death season 3 would have rounded off Stede and Ed&#39;s epic romance, but the future of the show on HBO Max is seemingly over. Our Flag Means Death is a loose retelling of the wild true story of Stede Bonnet, an aristocrat who left his family and life of luxury behind to pursue his dream of becoming the &#34;Gentleman Pirate.&#34; Rhys Darby&#39;s (Flight of the Conchords) Stede and Taika Waititi&#39;s (What We Do in the Shadows) Blackbeard have become one of the most endearing — and quirky — romance stories on TV.




Creator David Jenkins has already teased the significance of Our Flag Means Death season 3 for the show, and it would have been the final chapter in Stede Bonnet and Blackbeard&#39;s story. Though there is still a lot of mystery around what the third installment of the show was supposed to bring, the likelihood of the story continuing is low since HBO Max has pulled the plug on their pirate romance comedy.

 Our Flag Means Dead Season 3 Is Canceled 
          

Despite a heap of positive critical attention and seemingly high viewership, Max has opted to cancel Our Flag Means Death after only two seasons. This is particularly shocking for fans who had become increasingly invested in the show&#39;s romance storyline that had been brewing across its first two installments. With creator David Jenkins talking so candidly about the story&#39;s future, it&#39;s clear that the cancelation was something of a broadside to the entire team. It&#39;s unclear if another streamer can or will pick the canceled series up.






 Our Flag Means Death Season 3 Cast 
          

The Our Flag Means Dead season 3 cast would likely have seen many of the main ensemble returning. Leading the cast was Rhys Darby (Flight of the Conchords) as Stede Bonnet, the kind and optimistic &#34;gentleman pirate&#34; who attempts to inject his bright outlook into the vicious world of pirates. He was joined by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok) as Edward Teach, AKA Blackbeard, the notorious pirate whose sometimes violent and cruel ways are juxtaposed to the fun and self-affirming outlook he takes on once his friendship with Stede begins.

Darby and Waititi may have led the cast of Our Flag Means Death, but they were far from alone, and the pirate comedy had a healthy ensemble, including:

 Actor  Our Flag Means Death Role   Ewen Brenner  Nathaniel Buttons   Joel Fry  Frenchie   Samson Kayo  Oluwande Boodhari   Vico Ortiz  Jim Jimenez   Kristian Nairn  Wee John Feeney   Matthew Maher  Black Pete   Nat Faxon  The Swede   Rory Kinnear  Admiral Chauncey Badminton   Rubio Quian  Zheng Yi Sao   Erroll Shand  Prince Ricky Banes   Leslie Jones  Spanish Jackie   






                  Our Flag Means Death Cast, Character &amp; Cameo Guide   The ensemble of the HBO Max historical comedy Our Flag Means Death contains a number of talented comedic performers who will likely look familiar.    



 Our Flag Means Death Season 3 Story Details 
          

The plot of Our Flag Means Death season 3 was kept under wraps, though David Jenkins revealed he had the story mapped out, and that the third season would have ended Stede and Blackbeard&#39;s tale of romance. The Our Flag Means Death second season finale was explosive, and set out several key points for the season 3 plot. Chiefly, Captain Zheng&#39;s revenge plan against Banes, though Stede and Ed weren&#39;t involved. They opted to settle down and run an inn, though it seemed highly unlikely they&#39;d be left alone by Banes for long.




The season 3 story would likely also have tied into the true story behind Our Flag Means Death. History showed that Blackbeard would die in a battle with military forces in November 1718 while Stede Bonnet was captured and hanged only a couple of weeks later. While Our Flag Means Death played loose with history, it would have been interesting to see if the end matches the real tale.
