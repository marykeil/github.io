## Literature Review
A Ted Lasso star is still willing to return for more of the show several months after the season 3 finale, though they have some reservations.




Ted Lasso star Phil Dunster would still return for more, though he has some reservations. In May 2023, Apple TV&#39;s Emmy Award-winning comedy series came to an apparent end with the Ted Lasso season 3 finale, which provided a happy ending for nearly every major character. However, without any official word from Apple TV&#43;, it remains to be seen if the series is officially over, or if there will be a continuation or spinoffs, with the Ted Lasso cast even fueling speculation at times.




Now, nearly a year since the season 3 finale, Dunster shared his thoughts on a possible Ted Lasso season 4 in an interview with Collider. The actor, who played the talented yet egotistical striker Jamie Tartt, says it is up to the show&#39;s creators – Jason Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt, Joe Kelly, and Bill Lawrence – whether to continue the show. However, Dunster only wants Ted Lasso to continue if it comes from &#34;the heart and soul.&#34; Read his full comments below:


My honest answer to that is really, only if the minds that be – Jason [Sudeikis] and Brendan [Hunt] and Joe Kelly and Bill Lawrence – feel like it would be with integrity. No one would forgive us or them for making something just for the sake of it. There’s enough content. We don’t need any more just for the sake of it. Of course, there are potential things that could happen there. Do I feel closure? Yeah, I kind of do. That doesn’t mean that anything will not happen, at all. That’s just my perception on it because it feels like we culminated that together. Sure, I would love to do more, but again, I would only want them to do it if they felt like it was something that came from the heart and soul. And I think it would. I don’t think that they would do if it wasn’t that, not least because Twitter would lose their collective minds, and then we’d have to live with that and that would probably be a bit of a nightmare.





                  Is Ted Lasso Over For Good? 7 Hints The Show Will Continue   Ted Lasso’s season three finale left viewers with some tears and unanswered questions. Apple TV’s popular comedy series has ended, or has it?    


 How Ted Lasso Could Continue 
          

Though Ted Lasso was developed by Sudeikis and his fellow co-creators with a 3-season plan in mind, Apple TV&#43; has never officially declared the show is over, and the Ted Lasso season 3 ending sets up several spinoff opportunities. After Ted moves back to Kansas to be with his son, Roy Kent replaces him as the head coach of AFC Richmond with Beard and Nate as his assistants. A potential spinoff could continue following the story of AFC Richmond under its new coaching staff and bring back established players like Jamie Tartt, Sam Obisanya, and others.




Another possible spinoff set up by the season 3 ending would focus on a female soccer team. During the season 3 finale, Keeley suggests an AFC Richmond women&#39;s team to Rebecca, with the moment seemingly intended to set up a spinoff. This possible spinoff seems less appealing not because of its subject matter, but because it would be tasked with introducing an entirely new team. The future of Ted Lasso remains uncertain, though it is clear that its fate ultimately lies within the hands of its creators.



Ted Lasso seasons 1-3 are streaming on Apple TV&#43;.
