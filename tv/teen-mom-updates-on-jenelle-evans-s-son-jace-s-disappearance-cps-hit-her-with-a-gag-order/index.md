## Literature Review
Teen Mom star Jenelle Evans served a gag order in Jace&#39;s CPS case after defending his abuser, discrediting his mental health, and causing distress.  




In a significant development in the ongoing Child Protective Services (CPS) investigation involving Teen Mom star Jenelle Evans, a judge approved a gag order in Jace&#39;s case. This decision to silence Jenelle comes in the wake of her social media posts discussing Jace&#39;s mental health and expressing support for her husband, David Eason, who faces child abuse charges. The posts have allegedly exacerbated the emotional distress experienced by the teen. The gag order underscores the sternness of the situation, emphasizing the need for confidentiality as the legal proceedings unfold. This latest move aims to protect the well-being of the involved parties amid the sensitive CPS case.




Jenelle&#39;s latest setback follows Jace&#39;s fourth runaway incident, the most recent from Grandma Barbara Evans&#39; home. Between Jenelle&#39;s legal issues and ongoing CPS scandals, Jace&#39;s siblings, nine-year-old Kaiser, and six-year-old Ensley, reside in Jenelle and David&#39;s household. The ban on discussing Jace raises concerns about the family&#39;s dynamics, especially with previous CPS involvement. It&#39;s unclear what punitive measures the court will take if Jenelle violates the order, but they could range from monetary damages to jail time. The latest incident underscores the challenges Jenelle faces in maintaining stability within her household, shedding light on the complexities of her parenting journey and raising questions about the well-being of Jenelle&#39;s three children.

In response to the recent criminal charges against her husband, David, Jenelle staunchly defended him while attributing the legal issues to Jace&#39;s mental health struggles, according to The Sun. Denying wrongdoing by her husband, she asserted that the authorities focused on the wrong individual and emphasized a lack of balanced reporting regarding the incident. Jenelle refrained from divulging details, citing the sensitivity of her son&#39;s mental health as the core issue. Stressing the need for privacy for her family&#39;s well-being, she (once again) redirected attention to her son&#39;s psychological wellness. Despite the circumstances, Jenelle has maintained unwavering support for David and publicly criticized her mother, Barbara.

Jenelle&#39;s escalating strain in her relationship with Jace stems from her public support of David. Reports from the same The Sun article suggest that her recent social media posts advocating for David have exacerbated the tension. Other sources claim that Jace has been emotionally affected by Jenelle&#39;s commentary on his &#34;mental health&#34; and stance towards David. This restlessness prompted a judge to consider a gag order in Jace&#39;s case, aiming to shield him from further emotional distress caused by public discussions. Jenelle was due to sign the order imminently, emphasizing the potential harm caused to Jace amid the ongoing family conflicts.
