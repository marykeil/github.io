## Literature Review
Visiting a Disney theme park is always magical, but Sister Wives star Janelle Brown was able to experience Disney World in a whole new way.




Sister Wives star Janelle Brown found her recent trip to Walt Disney World to be like visiting a ghost town. Janelle is living her best life since leaving her ex-husband, Kody Brown. The holidays were a busy time for her, where she was surrounded by several family members, including her own kids. Janelle and Kody were spiritually married for almost 30 years but ended up going their separate ways in 2022.




Janelle has been to Disney World before, but her most recent trip there came as quite a shock as she experienced an eerie but still quite exciting situation. Taking to her Instagram Stories to reveal details about her vacation, the Sister Wives season 18 star explained that the rain in Orlando, Florida, combined with the fact that Disney World was hosting a marathon, caused the amusement park to turn into a ghost town.


 

There was hardly anybody in sight as she and her daughter Savanah walked around and rode various rides, including the famous Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which inspired the hugely successful film franchise. &#34;Savanah and I had our own boat at pirates. That has never happened for me ever!&#34; Janelle shockingly exclaimed. The photo she included in her Instagram Story showed her and Savanah completely alone on the Pirates ride.

Janelle also shared a regular post on Instagram about her time at Disney World. &#34;Last year there was a cold snap and we froze. Today it&#39;s POURING rain and we are drenched.&#34; Fortunately, their planning this time around was a lot better and they brought ponchos and umbrellas. Several of her Instagram followers expressed their excitement that she was able to go to Disney World, with some acknowledging how cool it is to experience the theme park when almost nobody&#39;s there. One fan in particular felt it was meant to be, saying, &#34;Rain is just God&#39;s way of clearing the crowds out for ya.&#34;

In the comments section of her Instagram post, which featured her posing in front of Cinderella&#39;s castle while wearing a black poncho and holding an umbrella, one fan asked what she thought of the Guardians of the Galaxy ride. Janelle replied that it was one of her favorite rides. A couple of her social media followers left comments saying they spotted her at Disney World but decided not to disturb her.

The Disney parks are such an exciting experience, no matter if someone has been there many times or is experiencing it for the very first time. It&#39;s a good thing Janelle planned for the rain this time, but she and Savanah seemed quite shocked upon seeing how few people were at Disney World. Rain will definitely scare off a lot of visitors. Then there&#39;s the added element of the annual marathon drawing crowds to that event instead of the rides, which are normally the main attraction.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
