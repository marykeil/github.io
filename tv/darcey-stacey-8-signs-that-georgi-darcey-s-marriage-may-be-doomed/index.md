## Literature Review
Darcey &amp; Stacey couple Darcey Silva and Georgi Rusev recently had a secret wedding, but their past suggests they won&#39;t be married for long.




Darcey &amp; Stacey couple Georgi Rusev and Darcey Silva may have secretly married, but the signs of their doomed relationship are all out in the open. Darcey began her reality TV journey with twin sister Stacey Silva on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1. Darcey used to date Jesse Meester while on the show, but they split in season 2. In season 3, Darcey had a new boyfriend, Tom Brooks, but he broke up with her in season 4. Darcey introduced her new Bulgarian boyfriend, Georgi, in Darcey &amp; Stacey season 1. Georgi used to work as a personal trainer and massage therapist and moved to the U.S. a decade ago.
Darcey and Georgi dated during the COVID-19 pandemic and started living together after a few weeks of dating. Their on-again-off-again relationship continued for three years. Darcey and Georgi got married in a secret ceremony on November 11, 2023. Darcey, 49, and Georgi, 37, announced the news in a post on Instagram by sharing a photo of them holding hands to show off their rings. The wedding was surprising to viewers since Darcey and Georgi had split after season 4. They never confirmed they were back together.

 8  Georgi Rusev Could Be A Gold Digger 
Is Georgi Using Darcey For Money?


 







Darcey herself has suspected that Georgi is with her for her money. Georgi had asked Darcey to give him a gift on her and Stacey’s birthday, making her buy a fancy coat for him. Meanwhile, Darcey had found $1400 in cash that Georgi had hidden in a random sock in his drawer. Darcey had already spent more than $50,000 on Georgi from the start of their relationship. Georgi may have approached her on social media because of her flaunting wealth in her photos and videos. After all, Georgi supposedly used to browse sugar mama websites to find his targets.





 7  Darcey Silva&#39;s Relationships Always Fail 
She Can&#39;t Maintain Long-Term Relationships


 







Darcey has come across as needy and insecure and hasn’t been able to maintain any long-term relationships. She even broke up with Georgi multiple times and ended their engagement twice. The problem lies in Darcey, who has toxic expectations of the men she dates. Once Darcey senses that there’s not enough drama in her life, she creates it herself and drives her partner away. Darcey says she “just wants to be loved” but doesn’t make it look like she loves the man she’s with. She thrives off being a victim and projects her insecurities onto her partner. Darcey should&#39;ve focused on herself before getting married.





 6  Georgi Rusev &amp; Darcey Silva Broke Up Before 
Georgi And Darcey Are Too On And Off


Darcey and Georgi broke up twice during their relationship with Darcey &amp; Stacey. Georgi and Darcey had a big blowout in season 2 after she met up with Georgi&#39;s ex-wife, Octavia Bellinger. As the season ended, so did their relationship. “I’m a strong woman,” Darcey had told Georgi during a phone call when she decided to end things with Georgi. He, too, admitted he wasn’t treating Darcey right. Georgi had contacted Darcey’s ex, Jesse, and had not been transparent about his marriage to Octavia. However, Darcey and Georgi couldn’t stay out of each other’s lives for long.
Georgi popped the question to Darcey for the second time in the season 3 finale in front of her daughters in Miami. Darcey had said yes to him; however, Darcey revealed she parted ways with Georgi after the second proposal in February 2023 because she thought the relationship was not going anywhere. They had communication issues, and Darcey felt like she needed to walk away. She wanted to keep her heart open for the “right person,” according to an interview she did with Entertainment Tonight.





 5  Georgi Rusev &amp; Darcey Silva&#39;s Age Gap Could Be A Problem 
Darcey Is 12 years Older Than Georgi
        

Funny enough, Darcey went right back to the wrong person, Georgi. It’s not just their communication issues that make Georgi the wrong person for her. Darcey and Georgi also have a large age difference, which makes the relationship challenging. Darcey is 12 years older than Georgi. Darcey’s past relationships on 90 Day Fiancé had also been with younger men, and none of them went well. The main reason could be the uncomfortable power dynamics in the relationship where Darcey began assuming more authority over finances or other day-to-day decisions. They could also face a roadblock when it comes to having a baby in the future.





 4  Georgi Rusev &amp; Darcey Silva Aren&#39;t Equally Famous 
Darcey Is More Famous


Darcey is one of the most successful cast members from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. She has more than a million followers on Instagram alone, has a successful fashion and lifestyle brand, and comes from a wealthy background. Georgi, meanwhile, who used to be a model and actor in the past, doesn’t seem to be doing any work in those areas now. Georgi did not gain as much fame as Darcey since his debut. He could get insecure about his wife being more famous than him, thus creating a power imbalance between the couple, especially if Darcey isn’t able to push him into the career of his choice.





 3  Georgi &amp; Darcey Are Both Superficial 
They Both Like Cosmetic Procedures
        

Darcey is known for her cosmetic procedures, which have earned her a lot of criticism. Darcey’s before and after photos are often compared on the internet, where one can see how much Darcey has changed since 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1. Like Darcey, Georgi has also undergone cosmetic procedures to change the way he looks. It shows that Darcey and Georgi are both superficial and only care about their appearance, social status, and possessions. They might easily discard each other if their partner doesn’t fit into their aesthetic.





 2  Georgi &amp; Darcey Were Engaged For 3 Years 
They&#39;ve Been Engaged Before
        

Georgi and Darcey first got engaged in June 2020 but announced it to the world in October 2020. They began documenting their journey on Darcey &amp; Stacey season 1 and had moved in together during the pandemic. The couple had two breakups since then. Georgi and Darcey getting married in November 2023 confirms how unsure they were about each other and possibly still are about their marriage. Darcey even dated other men when she was single in season 4. It may have been something she did to make Georgi jealous, but it also means she could have married someone else if she saw them as a better fit.





 1  Georgi Rusev May Be A Cheater 
There Were Rumors Georgi Cheated Recently
        

Aaron Carter died in November 2022, but before his death, he made shocking claims about Georgi and his ex-fiance. Heavy reported the news about Aaron, claiming he broke up with his ex-Melanie Martin because she was talking to a man from 90 Day Fiancé. Georgi could have been seeing other women behind Darcey’s back, even though Aaron’s claims were not proven. Neither Georgi nor Darcey from Darcey &amp; Stacey responded to claims of him acting inappropriately. However, Darcey does need to be careful in the future since Georgi is not someone to be trusted, given his past.
