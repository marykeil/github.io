## Literature Review
Austin Butler takes center stage in a new Masters of the Air clip, showing the actorâ€™s character landing a bomber during dangerous conditions.




Masters of the Air has debuted a new clip showing the flying skills of Austin Butler&#39;s World War 2 pilot. After finding success with Band of Brothers and The Pacific, executive producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are set to explore an entirely new aspect of the war with their upcoming series for Apple TV Plus. Butler leads the Masters of the Air cast as Maj. Gale &#34;Buck&#34; Cleven, with the show following Buck and other pilots of the 100th Bomb Group in the fight against Nazi Germany, as documented in the book of the same name by Donald L. Miller.




Now, as the Masters of the Air release date approaches, IMDb releases a new clip from the show, teasing the aerial action to come. Check out the new clip below:


 

The clip features Buck piloting a B-17 bomber and attempting to land on a remote runway as the plane is buffeted by high winds, with the scene providing the best look yet at what to expect from Butler&#39;s performance.


 What To Expect From Masters Of The Air 
          

Band of Brothers and The Pacific provide a strong indication of what&#39;s come from the new series, with both of those shows featuring an unflinching portrayal of the war and the people who fought in it. Both of these series explored the immense human cost of World War 2 in the European and Pacific theaters, with Masters of Air set to take a similar approach but with aerial warfare. 




Like Band of Brothers and The Pacific, Masters of the Air is based on real people and events. In addition to Butler, the series stars Barry Keoghan as Lt. Curtis Biddick, Callum Turner as Maj. John &#39;&#34;Bucky&#34; Eagan, Anthony Boyle as Lt. Harry Crosby, Rafferty Law as Sgt. Ken Lemmons, Elliot Warren as Lt. James Douglas, David Shields as Maj. Everett Blakely, Matt Gavan as Capt. Charles Cruikshank, and Ben Radcliffe as Capt. John D. Brady, among others.



Band of Brothers and The Pacific are both currently available to stream on Max and Netflix.




Masters of the Air will run for nine episodes, with the first two set to release on Apple TV Plus on Friday, January 26. A new episode will release every Friday until the show&#39;s finale on March 15. As with Band of Brothers and The Pacific, Masters of the Air will be a limited series, with no season 2 currently planned.
