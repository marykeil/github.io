## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner is torn between his final two women, Leslie Fhima and Theresa Nist. Here&#39;s why Leslie is his perfect match.




The Golden Bachelor star, Gerry Turner, has a difficult decision to make between his final two women, Leslie Fhima and Theresa Nist, and, while both women are wonderful, Leslie would be a better match for Gerry. Leslie is a 64-year-old fitness instructor from Minneapolis, Minnesota. She caught Gerry&#39;s attention on premiere night with her limousine entrance, when she wore a costume of an old woman with a gray wig, housedress, and a walker. When she tossed both her costume and prop aside and revealed her dress, Gerry was captivated.




Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Leslie has continued to win Gerry&#39;s heart with her sexy and sweet personality, from a sensual dance routine in the talent show to sharing that she wears hearing aids like Gerry. Since then, Gerry and Leslie&#39;s connection has only grown stronger. He met her family during their wonderful hometown date, and they shared a beautiful night together in the Fantasy Suite. Gerry and Leslie have exchanged &#34;I love yous,&#34; and he even told her that he thought she was &#34;the one.&#34; Here&#39;s why Leslie is Gerry&#39;s perfect match.

 Leslie Is Kind &amp; Loving 

 

Although all of the Golden Bachelor women are genuine, Leslie is a true gem. She&#39;s very kind and loving, especially towards Gerry. Her special relationship with her family members shows how much she&#39;s loved by others as well. Leslie is the mother of three children and the grandmother of three grandchildren. She&#39;s funny and exciting, but also has a soft side. Leslie was never involved in any drama with any of the other women, and she focused all of her attention on building a strong relationship with Gerry.






 Leslie Opened Her Heart To Gerry 

 

Despite having her guards up at first, Leslie was able to fully open up to Gerry and trust him. On Leslie&#39;s first one-on-one date with Gerry, she told him that she&#39;s been divorced twice and was a single mother. She feels that she&#39;s never had a true partnership, and she&#39;s been single for 22 years. In her confessional, she revealed that Gerry embodies everything that she wants in a man.

Leslie shared that she&#39;s never dated a man like Gerry before, and, in her past relationships, she&#39;s been hurt and abandoned. When he looked back to check on her as they rode ATVs, it meant everything to her. Leslie also trusted Gerry enough to go rappelling with him during the daytime portion of their Fantasy Suite date. She made herself vulnerable to him. When Leslie tells Gerry that she loves him, it&#39;s very sincere. It&#39;s clear that she really means it. Gerry would be lucky to be with a woman like Leslie, who&#39;s willing to give him her whole heart.




As The Golden Bachelor comes to an end, Gerry has a very difficult and life-changing decision to make. Although Theresa is a fantastic woman who&#39;d make a good match for him, Gerry should choose Leslie. They seem like the perfect fit for each other. Hopefully, Gerry and Leslie are now happily engaged, and ready to begin the next chapter of their life together.

The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
