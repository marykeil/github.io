## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner is close to the end of his journey as the lead, but he&#39;s speaking out about the future of the Golden franchise.




The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner opened up about whether or not there could be a Golden version of Bachelor In Paradise. While Gerry’s journey as The Golden Bachelor is coming to an end, there’s still drama left to unfold in the inaugural season of the Bachelor Nation spin-off. As Gerry prepares to defend his final decision and reveal the woman he’s chosen to spend the rest of his life with, many are looking ahead to what’s next for The Golden Bachelor as an entity. While anticipation is building for a possible Golden Bachelorette, there&#39;s another idea being floated that&#39;s outside the box.




According to EW, the Golden Bachelor season 1 star isn’t getting his hopes up for a season of Golden Bachelor In Paradise. “I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s something I would support,” he admitted when asked about the possibility for a beach-side turn for the cast. Gerry continued on, however, by saying, “I do know there&#39;s an awful lot of individuals from The Golden Bachelor that would be fantastic on a beach. They would have the time of their lives!” While Gerry may not be supportive of the idea of Golden Bachelor In Paradise, it’s possible the show could be greenlit if there is enough interest.

While Gerry’s speaking out about the future of the franchise, he’s also sharing his thoughts on who could become the very first Golden Bachelorette. In a recent interview with People, Gerry shared that he thinks “it would be exciting because it&#39;s going to continue the theme that we&#39;ve started of being hopeful and being visible at our age.” While there’s at least one woman Gerry likely wouldn’t nominate for the lead, he kept it diplomatic when he was asked who should be handing out roses as the first Golden Bachelorette. “There&#39;s 22 women that stand out. I absolutely would not be able to single one out...there&#39;s no bad choice.”





 

While Gerry may not be playing favorites, speculation is mounting online over who could become the very first Golden Bachelorette, if there is one. Though Gerry has yet to make his final choice, if either Leslie Fhima or Theresa Nist are open to becoming the first lead of the women&#39;s side of the franchise, that would create a lot of excitement. Outside of Leslie or Theresa, other names have been floated around online to take the lead on The Golden Bachelorette including Faith Martin, Susan Noles, Sandra Mason, and Ellen Goltzer.

With Gerry&#39;s time as The Golden Bachelor coming to an end, a new group of people looking for love could happen after renewed faith in the franchise. Though The Golden Bachelorette hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet, there&#39;s hope that seeing the success of the current spin-off will ensure that a second series comes to fruition. With nearly an entire cast of women to choose from, there could be a whole new series to look forward to in the future, possibly with one of the women from The Golden Bachelor as its lead.

The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
