 Everything We Know About Stranger Things Season 5 
        

Stranger Things season 4 ended with Vecna successfully breaking the barrier between the Upside Down and Hawkins. This leads to a final shot of Eleven standing on a hillside with the majority of the main cast, watching as the darkness of the alternate dimension leaks into the town. The scene indicates how intense the final battle between the heroes and the show&#39;s main antagonist will be, setting the stage for an exciting final season.
Because production on the final batch of episodes is just starting, it will be quite some time before the show returns to Netflix. It&#39;s likely the series won&#39;t come back until 2025, meaning it could be a year or more before the series comes to a conclusion. However, the exact release date of season 5 won&#39;t be clear until after production is complete.
Even though the seriesis coming to a close, the Duffer Brothers still have plenty of stories left to tell in its universe. They have already confirmed a live-action Stranger Things spinoff, which won&#39;t be released until after the main series has concluded. With the behind-the-scenes cast image confirming production has started, the day the series ends is now fast approaching.
Stranger Things is one of the most successful Netflix originals produced by the streaming service.
