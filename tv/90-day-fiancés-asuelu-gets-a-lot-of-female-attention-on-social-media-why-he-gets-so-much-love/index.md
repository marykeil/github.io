## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé’s Asuelu Pulaa may not have been able to win Kalani Faagata back, but he earns a lot of praise from female fans on social media.





During 90 Day: The Last Resort, Kalani revealed the real reason for the issues between her and her husband. She accused Asuelu of cheating on her and shared that he messed around with other women before they had kids. He allegedly cheated on her multiple times when she was pregnant and pushed her to have a second baby. Kalani tried her best to make things work with Asuelu but picked her new caring boyfriend, Dallas, in the end. She couldn’t overcome her husband’s continuous betrayal.

 Asuelu Gets Several Flirtatious Comments On His Photos 

 

Asuelu stood out as the ultimate villain in the new spin-off. Despite that, he maintained his social media popularity and got huge support from his female fans. A few months ago, the new single dad posted a charming photo of himself rocking a full-face beard. He captioned it, “Atlanta what’s good over there,” showing how happy he was without Kalani. Many women took to the comment section, applauding Asuelu’s new look. A social media user wrote, “damn, you look badass, Asuelu.” Another commented, “lookin good.” The Samoan man got thousands of likes, even from single female co-stars like Aryanna Sierra and Winter Everett.






 Asuelu Has A Fun Personality &amp; Is A Talented Dancer 

 

The biggest cause of Asuelu’s popularity is his vibrant personality. He is cool, confident, and an excellent entertainer. Asuelu doesn’t shy away from posting fun videos on Instagram, hooking his followers with his catchy dance moves. 90 Day Fiancé stars also often applaud him in their posts, the most recent example being Yara Zaya. In November 2023, Yara posted an album of photos and videos from her time at the resort, many of which showed Asuelu going wild. A female fan even called Asuelu a “big baby.” She added, “I love kalani so much but asuelo is absolutely hilarious.” 



 Asuelu Is Part Of His Sons’ Lives 
          




It seems that many fans have forgiven Asuelu for cheating on Kalani, as they know that he didn’t get the right education in Samoa. The dad of two cheated on Kalani because he never thought too deeply about the importance of intimacy and the value of monogamy. He also seemed truly apologetic in 90 Day: The Last Resort and wanted to save his marriage. Asuelu was there for Kalani in the spin-off, and he’s also there for his sons, as evident by his Instagram posts. There is some suggestion that the 90 Day Fiancé alum is a good guy who made bad decisions and has paid for them.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
