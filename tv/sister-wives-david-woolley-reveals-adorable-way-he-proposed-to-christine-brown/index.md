## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Christine Brown had no idea that her dream man was going to propose to her, with David Woolley fishing out the ring mid-hike.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown admitted she was “clueless” about the sweet proposal that David Woolley had planned for her. Christine is considered polygamist royalty because she is the granddaughter of Rulon C. Allred, and Kody married her because of that. Christine became Kody’s third wife after Meri and Janelle Brown, in March 1994, and they had six kids together. One of the reasons why Christine decided to leave Kody was because she was unhappy living with him in Arizona. The exes publicly announced their split in November 2021, and in October 2023, Christine married David, whom she met on dating app Stir.




Sister Wives&#39; Christine and David were interviewed by E! News, during which David revealed they went to watch The Little Mermaid for their second date, and he realized she was “going to be the person I wanted to be with.” David popped the question to Christine in April 2023 while they were on a hike. “She was clueless about it,” David confessed. He had planned to propose to Christine on a cliff in scenic Moab, Utah. “I thought of a lot of ideas, my kids, your kids were all like, &#39;Let&#39;s do those big things.&#39; And, you know what, I&#39;m gonna do it the way I want to do it,” David told Christine.

Christine didn’t even know that David had the ring in his hoodie coat. He had tasked his friends to capture the moment. David and Christine had been hugging while his friend approached them coyly and asked Christine, “Do you want me to take your picture?” Christine then revealed, “I&#39;m like, &#39;Yeah.&#39; And he holds it up. And he was recording it instead. It was so sweet. It went perfect.&#34; Christine had, after all, manifested her dream man. She wanted someone with a bald head, a motorcycle, and a penchant for solid communication. “I don&#39;t know what&#39;s sexier than that,” Christine exclaimed.


 

They were attending a family party as a couple, and while they were sitting, David pulled Christine’s chair back to him and put his arm around her. “I laid my head on his chest,” Christine recalled. She could tell that their hearts were in sync at that moment. She took a deep breath. “And it was like I took my first breath,” Christine mentioned. “And I knew at that point I was in love with him and we were it,” she continued. At that point, Christine knew they were “complete soulmates.” She wanted to start a life together with David and she was going to let nothing get in their way.




Christine’s big day was recently televised in a new wedding special three months after she tied the knot with David. Christine was starting life afresh after two decades of being married to her polygamist husband, Kody. Christine had reentered the dating scene and met David online in October 2022. Then they met in person in December 2022. As a couple, they’ve been together for a little over a year, but the Sister Wives star is looking at a lifelong partnership with the Herriman, Utah, resident.



Sister Wives airs Sunday at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
