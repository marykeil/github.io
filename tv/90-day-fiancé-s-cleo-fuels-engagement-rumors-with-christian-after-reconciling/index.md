## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé couple Cleo Corraine and Christian Allgood may have gotten engaged in secret as the model accidentally reveals a big clue.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Cleo Corraine could be engaged to Christian Allgood, according to a major clue posted on Instagram. Cleo, 32, from Italy, was living in London, England, for her studies while working as a model when she met Christian, 30, from Minnesota. Christian and Cleo had started off being friends and had dated for four months when Christian went to the UK to spend time with her. However, Christian&#39;s family judged Cleo for being a trans woman, which made him wary of continuing the relationship. Despite them being together in the Tell All, Christian and Cleo broke up in October 2023.




However, the split only lasted for a month as Cleo started posting about Christian openly on Instagram and could now be engaged (according to Reddit user Szublimat).


 

The fan posted, “Cleo &#43; Christian Engaged?” while sharing a screenshot from Cleo’s Instagram Stories. The photo showed Cleo playing with one of her cats, who was sitting inside a paper bag, while Cleo was seemingly lying down and taking the photo. Cleo’s left hand showed her wearing a large ring on her fourth finger, which was visible in the photo.

 Cleo &amp; Christian&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

The Reddit user explained that the photo was taken from Cleo’s Instagram earlier that day. “Is that an engagement ring I see?” the fan asked fellow viewers. The fan wrote that Cleo was “just in the U.S.” They also added that since there had been no public announcement, Cleo and Christian’s engagement could mean that they’re going to be back on 90 Day Fiancé. “I feel bad for her,“ the fan added. Others replied to the comment with, “So terrible if true” and “she lost my sympathy a while ago.” Christian had a history of exclusively dating cis women.

This was the first time he dated a transgender woman. Christian’s family’s opinion of Cleo made him decide that he would not indulge in PDA upon meeting her. This hurt Cleo, as Christian avoided being intimate with her. While they were out on their first date night, Christian didn’t take into account that the loud place made his girlfriend, who has autism, uncomfortable. He also started flirting with women at the other table and didn’t feel like including Cleo in the conversation. What ruined his reputation even more was that Christian denied that he had sex with Cleo while she described their romantic encounter to the producers.




Christian was seen inviting a random woman he met at a bar to Cleo’s house for dinner. He also flirted with someone on his Steiner’s Anonymous Discord channel while dating Cleo. Christian shocked his 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days co-stars by proposing to Cleo during the Tell All. Cleo announcing their split in October 2023 came as a relief. However, Cleo and Christian were simply on a break and decided to resolve their differences to get back together. If the photo can be believed, Christian and Cleo are engaged now, but it remains to be seen if she will be documenting her U.S. move on Instagram too.
