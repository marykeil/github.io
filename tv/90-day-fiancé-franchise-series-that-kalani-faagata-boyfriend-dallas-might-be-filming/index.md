# 90 Day Fiancé Franchise Series That Kalani Faagata &amp; Boyfriend Dallas Might Be Filming


## SUMMARY 



  Kalani found validation and care in her relationship with Dallas, providing her with the happiness she did not experience with Asuelu.   Kalani&#39;s relationship with Dallas could potentially be featured on 90 Day: The Single Life, as she fits the criteria of a recently single cast member exploring new relationships.   Kalani and Dallas could also be a good fit for 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, even though they are not married, as recent seasons have featured couples who do not fit the traditional template.

## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Kalani Faagata is divorcing Asuelu Pulaa which means she could be filming a new spin-off with her new boyfriend Dallas Nuez.




Since Kalani Faagata has made her relationship with her boyfriend, Dallas Nuez, official, there are many 90 Day Fiancé shows they will likely film for. Kalani is a 35-year-old from Orange County, California, who started her journey on 90 Day Fiance season 6 when she married Asuelu Pulaa. Kalani and Asuelu were recently on 90 Day: The Last Resort, where she decided to divorce him. Kalani had been raised Mormon, so Asuelu was her first boyfriend. Kalani said it was one of the biggest reasons why she suffered so much heartbreak when she found out he had cheated on her.




Asuelu continued cheating on Kalani throughout their relationship, and she kept giving him many chances, thinking he would change. Asuelu contracting a disease while he was with a woman in Samoa was the last straw for her. Asuelu gave Kalani a hall pass after his infidelity so they could be even. Kalani met her new man Dallas, 28, on social media but developed a full-blown relationship with him behind Asuelu’s back. While Kalani and Asuelu tried to fix their marriage with couples therapy, Kalani had already decided she was better off with Dallas. While Asuelu wanted to make things work, Kalani had already checked out of the marriage afer she met Dallas.

 Kalani Could Star In 90 Day: The Single Life With Dallas 
          




She admitted Dallas gave her the validation and care she craved when she was with Asuelu. However, fans never got to see any of their interactions on camera. Kalani and Dallas’ dates could have been saved for 90 Day: The Single Life, which is where recently single cast members explore new relationships. Kalani fits all the criteria required for her to be a Single Life star. She’s getting divorced from Asuelu, dating someone new for the first time in several years, and finally getting to unmask Dallas after hiding his face on Instagram.



 Kalani &amp; Dallas Could Live &#34;Happily Ever After&#34; 

 

Since Kalani is already in a serious relationship with Dallas, they are also a good fit for 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?. The show started off documenting past 90 Day Fiancé couples after they had completed their K-1 process, but in recent seasons, there have been couples that don’t fit into this template. For instance, Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods are Americans and weren&#39;t married. Like them, Kim Menzies and Usman Umar were also not a married couple. Kalani has found her life partner in Dallas. She hasn&#39;t told fans whether she’s engaged to him. However, there were rumors that Kalani had already met Dallas’ parents.






 Kalani Might Quit Reality TV To Enjoy Her New Relationship 
          

According to The Sun, Kalani and Dallas were ready to move in together in July 2023. Dallas has been gushing about Kalani on his Instagram by calling her a “gem” and a “keeper.” He’s shared his Hawaiian and Filipino traditions with Kalani. However, when asked if he would appear on 90 Day Fiancé next, Dallas laughed, “That’s going to be a no for me.” Kalani may have had enough of the cameras watching her every move and documenting her relationships for the world to see. She might be interested in keeping things with Dallas private and could say goodbye to the franchise entirely to start a new family with him.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
