## Literature Review
Spunky, brave, smart and ambitious, the layers of Lois Lane&#39;s character have revealed themselves in her many appearances over the years.




Lois Lane is by far the second most important character in the Superman mythos other than the Man of Steel himself, and each of the many incarnations of the character all have a standout scene that exemplifies her best traits. Many actresses have taken a crack at the character over the years, with each one imparting their own unique take on Lois Lane. While Lane is often overlooked by general audiences and those less familiar with DC Comics as a simple damsel in distress, the best depictions of Lois Lane prove this assertion as being flat-out untrue.
There are many aspects to Lois beyond simply being Superman&#39;s love interest that the character&#39;s best scenes focus on. At the same time, Lane is a decorated journalist, a feisty go-getter, and a capable General&#39;s daughter. Whether it&#39;s her bravery, cleverness, prowess at her job, or dedication to Clark, there&#39;s a lot to appreciate about the character that her best showings put the spotlight on. Although most may be more familiar with Lane&#39;s appearances in Superman&#39;s many live-action movies, the multitudes of shows based on their relationship have had more time to develop her character via the medium of T.V.









 








 10  Lois Fixes Clarkâ€™s Suit 
My Adventures With Superman (2023)
        

The newly-released animated series My Adventures with Superman kicked the hornet&#39;s nest of Lois Lane fanatics with its quirky tomboy version of the esteemed character. Perhaps overly-ambitious and over-eager to prove herself, this series&#39; Lois Lane is also a capable journalist who knows how to pick herself up after being in a scrape, demonstrated in an intimate scene in which she fixes Clark&#39;s torn jacket just outside a glamorous launch party. Beyond the palpable chemistry between Lois and Clark in this scene, the reveal that she always carries an emergency sewing kit followed by a tender heart-to-heart is one of the most memorable moments in the show.







 9  Clark Tells Lois The Truth 
Smallville (2001)
        

If there&#39;s one sin My Adventures with Superman fell prey to in depicting Lois and Clark&#39;s relationship, it&#39;s the tired &#34;liar revealed&#34; trope, in which a portion of the story must be dedicated to Lois feeling betrayed after figuring out Clark&#39;s secret identity. Yet 20 years earlier, Smallville got it right, in the heartwarming moment where Clark finally admits to Lois that he is &#34;The Blur&#34;, his prototypical superhero alter ego. Lois&#39; literal jump for joy into Clark&#39;s arms subtly proves that she was already well-aware of his secret, but chose to allow Clark to find the right moment for himself to reveal it to her, ecstatic that their relationship had become trusting enough.





 8  Lois Names Superman 
Superman: The Animated Series (1996)
        

Part of the same universe as Batman: The Animated Series, Superman&#39;s own premiere cartoon featured a great Lois Lane that was absolutely crucial to the origin of the franchise&#39;s Superman. As the Man of Steel becomes active enough in Metropolis to be noticed, Lois, Clark, and editor Perry White discuss the hero. Lois proves just how good at her job she is by coming up with Superman&#39;s catchy name, ruminating on Superman&#39;s status as an idealized man with a thoughtful speech. Perry, of course, is only concerned about how good the name will be at selling copies, capping off the dynamic scene that captures Lois&#39; personality with flying colors.





 7  Lois Tells Tess What It Means To Be A Hero&#39;s Wife 
Smallville (2001)
        

In Smallville, Erica Durance&#39;s excellent portrayal of Lois Lane proved that she had unwavering faith in Clark, even when he himself didn&#39;t. When Clark and Oliver return to the Phantom Zone to ensure no more of its dangerous inhabitants will escape, Clark tells Tess to essentially shut the door behind them, sacrificing the two of them in order to keep the Earth safe. Of course, Lois refuses to accept this, going so far as to point a gun at Tess, telling her &#34;Being a hero&#39;s wife...means never accepting defeat&#34;.







 6  Clark And Lois Meet For The First Time 
Superman: The Animated Series (1996)
        

Superman: The Animated Series&#39;s Lois Lane was a tough, ambitious, and clever woman whose lofty career goals weren&#39;t about to be upturned by playing babysitter to a rookie reporter. The scene in which Perry White introduces Lois to Clark for the first time has so many amazing beats -- From Lois demanding answers from Perry as to why her important story didn&#39;t make the front page to her using Jimmy Olsen as a road block to attempt to slow down Clark from following her. This early scene establishes Lois&#39; career-oriented mindset and shows just how much Clark had to do to keep up with her, genuinely impressing her rather than falling for him just because.





 5  Lois Humiliates A Female Security Team 
Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993)
        

One of the most underrated Superman series, Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman knew how to show off Lois sassy side. During an investigation in which Lois needs to gain entry into a club owned by a villainous suspect, she encounters a burly team of female security guards, conveniently identified by their headbands that read &#34;security&#34;. After verbally annihilating the bouncers, Lois holds her own against them in a hand-to-hand scrap, embarrassing the lead guard by tripping her on a rug. The cherry on top is Lois casually roasting her, mentioning &#34;By the way, your roots? They&#39;re a little dark&#34;.





 4  Lois Tracks Down Superman Herself 
Man of Steel (2013)


 







Amy Adams&#39; Lois Lane admittedly didn&#39;t get too many moments to shine in the action-packed DCEU, but the series&#39; first film took the time to describe just how good Lois is as her job as an investigative journalist. With frighteningly little information to go off of, Lois manages to track down Superman, going from lead to lead working her way through a breadcrumb trail of first-hand accounts. This journey eventually leads her to the doorstep of Martha Kent, the grave of Jonathan Kent, and Clark himself, who she had already expected to confront her. This scene proves there&#39;s little that gets away from a properly-adapted Lois Lane.







 3  Lois Shoots Clark Kent 
Superman II (1980)


 







If any Superman series was the most guilty of relegating Lois Lane to little more than a shrieking damsel in distress, it would be Christopher Reeve&#39;s original run of films. Even in this franchise, however, Lois gets a great moment to shine in Superman II when she proves to Clark that she knows he&#39;s Superman, shooting him point-blank. When Clark scolds her, telling her she would&#39;ve killed him if she was wrong, she reveals to him that the bullets were blanks. Outsmarting Clark by forcing him to reveal his hand without even actually putting his life in danger, this clever bit of investigative ingenuity is some of the best detective work by Lois on-screen.







 2  Lois Calls Out Lex Luthor 
Superman: Man of Tomorrow (2020)
        

While Superman may be one of the few people who can contend with Lex Luthor&#39;s evil plots physically, Lois Lane is far more adept at attacking his reputation and leverage within the legal system. Kicking off the Tomorrowverse, Superman: Man of Tomorrow has a great moment demonstrating as much, in which the spunky Lois presents the public with a recording of Luthor admitting to gross negligence in the middle of a high-profile press release. Even if it doesn&#39;t immediately take down Luthor, it damages his reputation, and demonstrates Lois&#39; courage and unwavering commitment to exposing the truth.





 1  Lois Tests Herself After Surgery 
Superman &amp; Lois


 







Many versions of Lois Lane demonstrate bravery in the face of alien threats, political intrigue, and criminal masterminds, but Superman &amp; Lois&#39; version of the character deals with courage of a much more grounded nature. After undergoing a double mastectomy due to her breast cancer, Lois is terrified to initiate intimacy with Clark, nervous about how he&#39;ll perceive her changed body. But in this tender scene, she overcomes this fear, accepting Clark&#39;s unwavering love in defiance of her condition. This understated moment of emotional vulnerability is undoubtedly Lois Lane at her bravest.
