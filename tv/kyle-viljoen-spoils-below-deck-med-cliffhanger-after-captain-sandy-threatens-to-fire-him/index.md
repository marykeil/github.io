Kyle added that his &#34;immigration legal bills piled up&#34; and left him with &#34;nothing.&#34; However, he&#39;s not letting go of his reality TV career completely. He &#34;continuously dreams&#34; of being on his fans&#39; TV screens more so he can share stories that matter. Kyle will be pursuing new hobbies such as podcasting. He will also be &#34;planning a wedding,&#34; which is something he thought would never happen to &#34;someone like&#34; him. Kyle reminded viewers that he is a human being just like them and is still being subjected to hate mail and comments with homophobic slurs, especially when they get to see only a &#34;quarter&#34; of the story.

Kyle revealed he had to go through therapy to overcome what he experienced on Below Deck Med. He was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which is a rare and serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. Kyle mentioned how he didn&#39;t write the note for sympathy but to spread &#34;hope.&#34; Meanwhile, Kyle also shared an Instagram Story where he wrote, &#34;I wish I had quit when I wanted to. When I packed my bag and asked to leave.&#34; Yachting is &#34;PTSD&#34; to Kyle now. He feels &#34;totally at peace&#34; for not being a Chief Steward. &#34;Money is not everything,&#34; he added in conclusion.

The latest episode of Below Deck Med was dramatic and chaotic, thanks to Kyle and Natalya Scudder&#39;s argument over what Max Salvador said about straight people being allowed to be a part of the LGBTQIA community. Kyle&#39;s relationship with Natalya had already been rough after he created unnecessary issues between her and Tumi Mhlongo. He claimed his friendship with Natalya had never been real and called her a &#34;fake-a** b****.&#34; Captain Sandy decided that what Kyle did with Natalya was &#34;bullying&#34; before she accepted the stew&#39;s departure when she requested an early exit.






Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
