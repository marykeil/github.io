Marry My Husband releases new episodes every week on Amazon Prime Video, and the 2024 K-drama series where time travel meets revenge is the best of both genres. There are dozens of K-dramas about time travel, just like there are many Korean TV shows about revenge. For example, one of the best K-dramas of 2023 was Netflix’s The Glory, a story about a woman looking for revenge after being bullied during her school years. Although Marry My Husband is not as grim as The Glory, the former offers an interesting spin on classic tropes while also delivering humor and a love story.

Marry My Husband’s cast includes Park Min-young as Kang Ji-won, Na In-woo as Yoo Ji-hyuk, Lee Yi-kyung as Park Min-hwan, and Song Ha-yoon as Jung Soo-min. The show, which is based on a webtoon, debuted on January 1, 2024, and it will run for 16 episodes until February 20. Combining comedy, romance, sci-fi, and drama, Marry My Husband is already set to be among the best K-dramas of 2024 with just a few episodes released so far.





 Marry My Husband Is A Tale Of Revenge &amp; Second Chances (With Time Travel) 
          

Kang Ji-won, Marry My Husband’s protagonist, has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and has been given only six months by the doctors at the beginning of episode 1. Although she is married to Park Min-hwan, the only person standing by her side in this delicate moment is her best friend, Jung Soo-min. However, Ji-won soon learns that Soo-min and Min-hwan are having an affair. Ji-won walks into her husband and her best friend making out on her bed while she is at the hospital, an infuriating moment that sets the events of Marry My Husband in motion. Hoping to get the insurance quicker, Ji-won’s husband pushes her to her death.


 




This is when Marry My Husband adds a sci-fi twist to its story, as Ji-won wakes up 10 years ago right after dying in 2023. Now in 2013, Ji-won has the chance to distance herself from everyone who did her wrong while building a new life for herself. From healthier habits to breaking up with Min-hwan, Ji-won makes the most of her second chance in 2013, making Marry My Husband not only a story of revenge but also one of new beginnings. The initial episodes of Marry My Husband highlight how cutting toxic people from your life can make things better, and they also set up a new love story for Ji-won.



 How Marry My Husband’s Time Travel Rules Work 
          

Marry My Husband’s time travel follows an interesting set of rules. Firstly, the only thing that has gone back in time is Ji-won’s mind, not exactly her body. In other words, she has her 2023 memories and experiences but is currently existing in her 2013 body. As with many time travel TV shows, Park Min-young’s character decides to use her knowledge of the future to make some money on the stock market, investing in companies she knows will be big. At first, it seems like Ji-won can easily rewrite her destiny and make her life better. However, she realizes things are a bit more complicated.




                  The Best K-Dramas Based On Webtoons, Ranked   These top K-dramas ranked were once all popular webtoons and either got their start on the webtoons.com site or other sites and platforms.    

The first two episodes of Marry My Husband heavily imply that destiny cannot be completely changed, only slightly altered. For example, although Ji-won avoided getting a scar on her wrist from an accident she knew was going to happen, that same scar ended up appearing on the wrist of Yoo Ji-hyuk in the exact same circumstances. Ji-won concludes that she can “give her destiny” to other people, which is where the title of this K-drama comes from. Ji-won decides to get her “friend” and her ex-boyfriend together, so they can have the awful life she was having in 2023 – hence the clever “Marry My Husband” title.
