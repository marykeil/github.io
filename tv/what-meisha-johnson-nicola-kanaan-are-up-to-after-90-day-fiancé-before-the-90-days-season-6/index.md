## Literature Review
After getting engaged to Nicola Kanaan on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, Meisha Johnson shared a sad update about her relationship.




Meisha Johnson and Nicola Kanaan from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days have reached an unexpected phase in their relationship. The 43-year-old Minnesota resident and her Israeli partner were among the most unusual pairs on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. They came from different backgrounds but loved each other due to their mutual interest in spirituality. Initially, Nicola was worried that his family wouldn’t accept Meisha since she was a single mother with a controversial past. He didn’t know what to do, so he tread lightly. Fortunately, Nicola’s mother eased the situation by accepting Meisha as her daughter-in-law.




Nicola and Meisha dated for nearly seven years before appearing on the show. They cared for each other and seemed content with their ongoing relationship. Ahead of the finale, Nicola finally got enough courage to ask Meisha to be his forever. He proposed to her in public, and she immediately accepted. The couple continued their relationship after featuring on the Tell All. Nicola came to the United States to spend time with Meisha but eventually flew back to his home country of Israel.

 Did Nicola Come To The U.S.? 

 

Nicola and Meisha’s relationship took an unexpected turn in 2023 due to the circumstances in Israel. A few months ago, Meisha shared an update on Nicola and revealed he was doing fine. She shared how he lived in the other part of Israel, away from the conflict region. She also thanked God and showed that she was still worried about him. A few weeks ago, Meisha answered a fan who asked her about Nicola’s latest whereabouts. The single mom said Nicola is “in Israel.” She added, “he’s doing good and is safe, thanks be to God.”






 Are Meisha &amp; Nicola Married? 
          

Nicola and Meisha were looking to tie the knot and start their new lives after their engagement. However, they haven’t been able to do that yet. Recently, Meisha replied to a fan who asked her if she married Nicola after the proposal. She said, “Nicola and I are not married. No.” Maybe the couple is waiting for the global situation to improve to take things to the next level. It’s also possible that they are waiting for certain paperwork. For now, Meisha hasn’t revealed the real reason for the delay in marriage.



 What Meisha Has Revealed About Her Future With Nicola 
          




Over the last few weeks, Meisha has hinted that numerous things are at play that have halted her relationship with Nicola. Recently, she talked to a fan who asked her about her story and love life. Meisha answered, “at this point, sister, it is completely surrendered to the will of God.” The Minnesota woman claims she no longer controls all the “multi-layered facets” of her relationship. She thinks that God will take care of everything. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days couple will make it through and tie the knot in 2024.
