## Literature Review
Little People Big World&#39;s Zach Roloff wanted to buy Roloff Farms from his father, Matt Roloff. How much did he offer for the farm?




With all the talk about selling or not selling Roloff Farms, Little People, Big World, there&#39;s curiosity surrounding what Zach offered for the land. Zach and Matt Roloff were in a year-long stand-off over negotiations for the family farm that fell through. While Zach hoped to take over the land, Matt had other ideas. He took the farms off the market and then shifted to a rental before returning it to the real estate market.




Amy Roloff sold her 32 acres of the family farm to Matt in 2020 for a low $975,000. Before that sale, Amy also sold a portion of her land back in 2019 for $667,000. The LPBW matriarch hoped that selling her half would make it easier for Matt to allow his older sons, Zach and Jeremy Roloff, to come in for a repurchase of her shares. Sadly, Matt claimed he tried his best to sell to his twins by giving them a &#34;half-off family discount,&#34; but Zach didn&#39;t see the offer that way.


 What Did Zach Really Offer For Roloff Farms? 
          

Matt finally paid $1,642,000 to own the entirety of Roloff Farms. During the season premiere of Little People, Big World, Zach noted that he had made a competitive offer, telling cameras, &#34;I had a starting point, and it was based on what my dad bought my mom out for.&#34; Viewers can see how his father&#39;s counteroffer may have put off Zach. If Zach chose to offer around $1.6 million and Matt asked for $4 million when he put the home on the open market, that is a difference of almost half a million dollars. It is no wonder Zach felt cheated by his father, as the patriarch may have been trying to make a profit.






 Amy Regretted Selling The Farm Back To Matt 
          

While it is clear that neither Zach nor Jeremy will be taking over the family business, Amy still has regrets about selling the farm back to her ex-husband. During an episode of Little People, Big World, Amy shared that she had hoped that Matt would do the right thing and &#34;negotiate&#34; with the boys. Amy then candidly revealed that she chose to leave the farm for her boys to be able to take over.

Even though Amy may be sad and wishes she had done things differently, Zach has moved on and bought a house out of town. The Little People, Big World star, and his family moved into a new home an hour away in Battleground, WA, where they have space away from Matt and the family drama. It&#39;s safe to assume that Zach tried to be conservative, and Matt expected much higher. In the end, money unfortunately came between the family. Jacob Roloff, Matt and Amy&#39;s youngest son, has been doing most of the work on the property but is uninterested in buying. The drama of the farm sale is ongoing. Unfortunately, Zach and Matt&#39;s relationship will never be the same.
