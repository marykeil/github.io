## Literature Review
Chantel Everett was left devastated by her split on The Family Chantel, but the ex of Pedro Jimeno now has plans for marriage and babies.




The Family Chantel season 5 hasn’t held back when revealing the heartbreak Chantel Everett is experiencing, but the 90 Day Fiancé franchise star is finally showing how she is moving forward. As fans of the hit reality TV show are aware, Chantel was left by her husband, Pedro Jimeno, during The Family Chantel season 4. The Atlanta nurse is now mapping out her future so that she can secure her desired family in the next years.




Chantel experienced a lot of heartbreak on The Family Chantel season 4, as she lost her husband of seven years and became single for the first time in a decade. While Pedro was accused of stepping out on their marriage, Chantel expressed a desire to be married and have children. This left her devastated when she found herself single. The Family Chantel season 5 picks up nine months after the divorce filing when a now 32-year-old Chantel is making new plans for her future.


 Chantel Plots Out Her Future Marriage Plans

Chantel opened up to her brother Riverknight Everett on the latest episode of The Family Chantel season 5. She told her loyal younger brother that she had devised a plan to secure a family. Chantel said that she would freeze her eggs. She informed her brother that the average American man needs four years of dating to get married. She calculated two more years to have a child. Chantel said she would be 39 years old at the end of the process. Therefore, she decided she wanted to freeze her eggs to ensure that she could have kids with her future husband.






 Does Chantel Regret Her Marriage To Pedro? 

 

While Chantel Everett accepts that she did all things with love during her marriage, she did express frustration over being left 32 and single. It is no secret that Chantel has always wanted marriage and kids, as she has made this very clear over the years. However, during The Family Chantel season 5, Chantel expressed she did not regret her marriage because, at the time, she was doing what she thought was right. However, in retrospect, she would clearly do things differently after she discovered the truth that Pedro was using her, and she wasted many years with him.

While The Family Chantel has always been known for drama, season 5 has so far depicted Chantel being brutally honest about the issues she is dealing with. Pedro comes across as cold, as he allegedly cheated on Chantel for at least a year and potentially their entire marriage before their split. On the other hand, Chantel has not been afraid to show her vulnerability and be honest about the fact that she isn’t entirely over Pedro. Hopefully, by the end of The Family Chantel season 5, Chantel will have moved on and maybe even found someone new.








The Family Chantel airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
