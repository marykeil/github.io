## Literature Review
HBO&#39;s The White Lotus Season 3, which will be set in Thailand, adds five more to its cast as production prepares to kick off in February.




The White Lotus is filling out the cast for season 3. The anthology dramedy follows the high-stakes goings-on among the wealthy clientele of the fictional resort chain, with each season taking place in a different location and featuring an almost entirely different ensemble cast. Season 3, which will be set in Thailand, has already been set to feature Carrie Coon, Leslie Bibb, Michelle Monaghan, Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Dom Hetrakul, and Tayme Thapthimthong, along with Natasha Rothwell reprising her season 1 role as Belinda.




Per Deadline, five more cast members have been added to The White Lotus season 3. The stars beefing up the cast for the season, which is set to commence production in February, are Miloš Biković, Christian Friedel, Morgana O’Reilly, Lek Patravadi, and Shalini Peiris. So far, no information has been revealed about the characters that they will be playing.


 Where You Know the New White Lotus Stars 
          

The new stars joining the White Lotus season 3 cast are a varied group of international actors. For instance, Morgana O&#39;Reilly, a performer from New Zealand, is perhaps best known for her starring role in the 2014 horror-comedy Housebound, which was the debut feature of M3GAN director Gerard Johnstone. However, she also has a robust television career, including appearing as Naomi Canning on 194 episodes of the long-running Australian soap opera Neighbours.






Neighbours has helped launch the careers of many Oceanian stars, including Russell Crowe, Margot Robbie, and Liam Hemsworth.




Additionally, the Serbian-Russian performer Miloš Biković has a long resume featuring both movie and television titles, including Black Sun and South Wind. Shalini Peiris also has ample experience on television in shows including The Danny &amp; Mick Show and The Ark, though she has also held small uncredited roles in such prominent movies as The Huntsman: Winter&#39;s War and Justice League. German actor Christian Friedel has much experience of his own, but his most prominent recent role was playing the co-lead Rudolf Höss in Jonathan Glazer&#39;s buzzy new drama The Zone of Interest.

Lek Patravadi is the only one of the newcomers who is based out of Thailand. In fact, though she has few onscreen credits, she is the founder of the Patravadi Theatre in Bangkok and is a major influence in the local theater scene. With so many interesting performers lined up for the new season, it&#39;s possible that it will be able to build off from the shocking The White Lotus season 2 ending and deliver an even bigger and more textured story going forward.
