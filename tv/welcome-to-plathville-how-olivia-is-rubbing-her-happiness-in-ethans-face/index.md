## Literature Review
After splitting from Ethan Plath, Welcome To Plathville’s Olivia Plath looks happier, focussing on her passion for photography and traveling.




Welcome To Plathville cast member Olivia Plath has significantly improved her lifestyle since breaking up with Ethan Plath. The 25-year-old Virginia native didn’t fall in love with her husband when they first met at a family event. However, things changed when she reconnected with him years later, leading to mutual love and admiration. Olivia cared for Ethan from the get-go. However, she couldn’t bring herself to love his parents, who she felt judged her for everything. In Welcome To Plathville season 1, Olivia claimed Ethan’s mother constantly critiqued her.




It wasn’t long before Olivia pushed Ethan to separate from his family, so they could live a happier life. However, the plan backfired when the two started living together and realized they were no longer the same individuals who once fell in love. Olivia wanted to travel, be free, and enjoy her artistic passions. She hoped Ethan would support her ventures and be by her side in her adventurous life. However, Ethan had completely different expectations for his future. He wanted to settle down and build a family. The duo broke up after Welcome To Plathville season 5 in 2023.

In November, she posted a modeling photoshoot of herself on Instagram and wrote, “keep going. it gets better, i promise.” Olivia looked more hopeful than ever in her post. She had that post-breakup glow on her face that can only come after a person is truly set free. For years, Olivia was trapped with Ethan due to his sluggish lifestyle. Now, she’s finally free and ready to show off her real self on her social media.

Olivia is growing and moving on with a stronger mindset than ever. She isn’t grieving the loss of her marriage or cursing Ethan for being a terrible husband. Instead, she’s putting all her energy into building herself up. In December 2023, Olivia posted a few pictures from Phoenix, Arizona. She captioned it, “grabbing life by the thorns, choosing to not be pricks, and sticking together.” After wasting many of her youthful years with her uninspired husband, Olivia is back to being herself. She was and always has been an adventure seeker and world explorer. The Welcome To Plathville star isn’t the one who wants to settle down but the one to reach for the stars.
