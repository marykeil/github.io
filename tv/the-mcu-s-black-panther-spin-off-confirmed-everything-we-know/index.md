## Literature Review
A Black Panther spinoff is coming soon to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and here are all the known details about the upcoming MCU entry.




Eyes of Wakanda, a Black Panther spinoff, has been confirmed for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and some details from the project have already been revealed. Chadwick Boseman first played the MCU&#39;s Black Panther in 2016&#39;s Captain America: Civil War before getting to lead 2018&#39;s Black Panther, which would become one of the MCU&#39;s most popular films ever, running for a Best Picture Oscar — the only MCU film to do so — and becoming a cultural phenomenon. After Boseman sadly passed, Shuri became the MCU&#39;s new Black Panther, replacing her brother T&#39;Challa.




Shuri fought and defeated Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, with Letitia Wright&#39;s character expected to continue as Wakanda&#39;s protector if Marvel moves forward with Black Panther 3. Both before and after the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, rumors about possible new projects that would expand the MCU&#39;s Black Panther mythos emerged. Some of the possible projects that were raised over the past couple of years include alleged Wakanda and Okoye projects. Now, Marvel Studios has confirmed the MCU&#39;s first Black Panther spinoff.

                        All Marvel Movies Releasing In 2024   The Marvel movies releasing in 2024 offer a range of film experiences - and some confusion, due to the changed dates of several incoming installments.    


 What is Eyes Of Wakanda? 
          




In an event to promote the debut of Marvel&#39;s What If...? season 2 in December, it was revealed that the first Black Panther spinoff to premiere would be Eyes of Wakanda. It made sense to reveal the Black Panther spinoff during an event for What If...?, as Eyes of Wakanda is an animated series. That reveal seems to separate Eyes of Wakanda from the Black Panther spinoff that was revealed to be in the works at Marvel Studios back in 2021, as that project was reported to be an Okoye origin series, and Eyes of Wakanda will not focus on a single character.
