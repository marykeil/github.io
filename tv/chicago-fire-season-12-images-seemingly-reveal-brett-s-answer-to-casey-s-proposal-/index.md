# Chicago Fire Season 12 Images Seemingly Reveal Brett s Answer To Casey s Proposal 


## SUMMARY 



  Sylvie Brett may have accepted Matt Casey&#39;s proposal, as she is seen wearing a ring in the Chicago Fire season 12 images.   Sylvie&#39;s acceptance of the proposal is not surprising, as actor Kara Killmer&#39;s confirmed departure from the show has hinted at her character&#39;s future.   It remains to be seen whether Casey and Brett&#39;s wedding will take place in Chicago or their new home state of Oregon, but Firehouse 51 is likely to celebrate their engagement before they leave.

## Literature Review
New promotional stills for the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere may have revealed Sylvie Brett&#39;s answer to Matt Casey&#39;s surprise proposal. 




New Chicago Fire season 12 images may have revealed Sylvie Brett&#39;s response to Matt Casey&#39;s proposal. NBC&#39;s One Chicago is set to return with new episodes a bit earlier than its fellow scripted series, meaning that Wolf Entertainment is ramping up the marketing for all of its Chicago-based shows. Out of the trio, however, Chicago Fire season 12 has the most exciting comeback, considering where season 11 left things for Chief Boden and his crew.




The promotional stills from NBC (via TV Insider) offer an early look at what to expect from the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere, “Barely Gone,&#34; which will air on January 17. Check out the images below: 

         

Aside from the action-packed images that show Firehouse 51 on call, arguably the biggest takeaway from the selection is Sylvie seemingly wearing a ring — effectively confirming that she may have said yes to Casey. 


 What Casey &amp; Brett&#39;s Engagement Means For Chicago Fire Season 12 
          

There are a lot of interesting details in the Chicago Fire season 12 premiere images, including Kelly Severide suiting backup for Firehouse 51 and Hermann seemingly finding himself in a bad spot. In particular, his peers rush to give him medical attention. However, seeing Sylvie seemingly wearing a ring is arguably the most exciting development. After everything she and Casey have gone through, both as a couple and individually, it&#39;s great to see them finally rekindling their romance after being forced to end things.




                  5 One Chicago Characters Who Likely Won&#39;t Return (&amp; 2 Who Might Come Back)   NBC&#39;s One Chicago may look very different when it finally returns with brand new episodes thanks to several character departures and returns.     

Admittedly, Sylvie accepting the proposal shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. Kara Killmer&#39;s confirmed departure from One Chicago has been a big clue for what lies ahead for her character. Casey&#39;s proposal in the Chicago Fire season 11 finale almost serves as a set-up for her to be written out of the show without any tragedy. Once she agrees to get married, the next organic step for her is to move with Casey to Portland, Oregon, which means her walking away from her job in Firehouse 51.

The question now is whether their wedding will be held in Chicago or if they will save that for a later date in their new home state. Regardless, it&#39;s difficult to imagine that Firehouse 51 won&#39;t at least plan a small celebration for the couple before they leave in Chicago Fire season 12. Even if they don&#39;t tie the knot in the Windy City, Chief Boden&#39;s crew will surely take some time off to commemorate their engagement at Molly&#39;s.
