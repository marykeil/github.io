## Literature Review
Some TV weddings, like Jake and Amy&#39;s in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, are so long overdue that it&#39;s impossible not to weep when the love birds tie the knot.




A TV couple has to be really endearing for viewers to empathize with the characters and, eventually, tear up when their wedding day arrives in the most heartfelt fashion. It is not that difficult to make audiences root for a couple — they have to be lovable opposites who get thrown into each other&#39;s arms by destiny. Still, there aren&#39;t many TV relationships that have undeniable chemistry and the right timing for them to become endgame. A wedding often means that the couple has reached their happily-ever-after, although, like with every rule, there are exceptions. In The Vampire Diaries, Stefan and Caroline&#39;s relationship ended on a rather bittersweet note, despite the fact that there was a wedding.
In The Vampire Diaries&#39; case, the tears might not have been purely of joy, but weddings in many other shows leave a much more lighthearted impression. For instance, Mike and Phoebe&#39;s big day in Friends was beautiful and touching, even though none of Phoebe&#39;s family were at her wedding. Sitcoms in general tend to make a big deal out of a wedding, as it can be more than the next big step for the couple. In fact, a wedding can also be a powerful plot device. The important thing is not to take away any of the emotional charge of the event in question.
            
 
 9 Alternate TV Show Endings That Would Have Been Better Than What We Got 
Not every show is fortunate enough to receive a proper send-off, and series like Sex and the City and The Originals have been robbed of good endings.













 








 10  Ben &amp; Leslie 
Parks and Recreation


 







 Parks and Recreation 

 Cast   Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&#39;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe    Seasons   7    




Parks and Recreation featured quite a few great couples, but Ben and Leslie were easily the most entertaining to watch. They started out as frenemies of sorts, but over the course of the show, they developed into equal partners that respect and love each other. Ben and Leslie broke up in season 4 because they wanted to do the right thing, but their mutual affection proved to be too strong, and they couldn&#39;t stay away from each other. In season 5, episode 14, &#34;Leslie and Ben,&#34; the two spontaneously — and uncharacteristically — married at City Hall, and the ceremony was entirely too sweet to handle.





 9  Jake &amp; Amy 
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
        

 Brooklyn Nine-Nine 

 Cast   Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio    Seasons   8    




Jake and Amy were the exemplary opposites that attracted no matter what they did. In Brooklyn Nine-Nine&#39;s earlier days, the couple-to-be were mere competitors at work. Over time, their negative feelings shifted toward uncomfortable flirting, but it took them two entire seasons to even kiss. Once Jake and Amy started dating, they became an unstoppable power duo both at work and outside it. In the season 5 finale, &#34;Jake &amp; Amy,&#34; their wedding day arrived. Despite multiple interruptions, the couple got to tie the knot outside their precinct. The scene was already an absolute tear-jerker, but Holt officiating the ceremony added further emotional depth to it.





 8  Stefan &amp; Caroline 
The Vampire Diaries
        

 The Vampire Diaries 

 Cast   Nina Dobrev , Ian Somerhalder , Steven R. McQueen , Paul Wesley , Kat Graham , Michael Trevino , Michael Malarkey , Zach Roerig , Candice King , Matthew Davis    Seasons   8    




Stefan and Caroline&#39;s marriage was not made to last, but that didn&#39;t stop their wedding scene in season 8, episode 15, &#34;We&#39;re Planning a June Wedding,&#34; from being one of the most moving moments in The Vampire Diaries. These characters weren&#39;t love birds or even friends at the beginning, but they rediscovered each other through loss and misery and evolved together. Stefan was the best version of himself when he was with Caroline, and vice versa. After the amount of tragedy they both had been through, they deserved to be happy — and they were for but a moment.





 7  Jim &amp; Pam 
The Office


 







 The Office 

 Cast   Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski    Seasons   9    




Jim and Pam&#39;s relationship in The Office was a signature slow-burn romance. Even though the two clearly liked each other from episode 1, they didn&#39;t get together properly until season 4. Jim and Pam were the wonderfully awkward union that Dunder Mifflin&#39;s office desperately needed from the start. In the season 5 two-part episode, &#34;Niagara,&#34; the couple tied the knot in the only way that made sense — on a boat, in secret, away from the madness that ensued at the actual location where their families and coworkers were. Jim and Pam&#39;s quiet wedding fitted the characters like a glove, and it was a heart-warming tribute to their love.





 6  Mike &amp; Phoebe 
Friends
        

 Friends 

 Cast   Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer    Seasons   10    




Phoebe was the kindest and most precious person out of her friend group, and she deserved the world. Her world ended up arriving in the face of Mike Hannigan in Friends season 9. Although Mike wasn&#39;t perfect on paper, and he had issues with marriage, he turned out to be Phoebe&#39;s Prince Charming. It took a breakup and a chance that David, Phoebe&#39;s old fling, might marry the love of his love for Mike to change his mind about marriage. In season 10, episode 12, &#34;The One with Phoebe&#39;s Wedding,&#34; the couple wed in a fairytale snowstorm-set ceremony, and their wedding vows were worthy of a happy cry.





 5  Luke &amp; Lorelai 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life
        

 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life 

 Cast   Lauren Graham , Alexis Bledel , Scott Patterson , Aris Alvarado , Sean Gunn , Frank Gallegos , Keiko Agena , Matt Czuchry , Yanic Truesdale , Kelly Bishop    Seasons   1    




Luke and Lorelai were the on-and-off couple of Gilmore Girls, and despite all their issues and breakups, they were adorable together. Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t get to exchange vows on the original show, which was cut a season too short. However, the couple did get to marry in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&#39;s finale, &#34;Fall.&#34; Luke and Lorelai&#39;s wedding didn&#39;t make sense for a multitude of reasons — it was long overdue and smaller than expected, and there were several key people missing. All that aside, the moment Luke and Lorelai stood at the improvised altar was still emotional, as it represented how far they had both come.





 4  Schmidt &amp; Cece 
New Girl
        

 New Girl 

 Cast   Zooey Deschanel , Max Greenfield , Hannah Simone , Damon Wayans Jr. , Lamorne Morris , Jake Johnson    Seasons   7    




Schmidt and Cece didn&#39;t seem like they were going to end up together since they were too different. Throughout New Girl, they faced a lot of obstacles on the way to their happily-ever-after. At first, Cece despised Schmidt for his immature behavior. Then they started secretly hooking up, but Cece was ashamed of it. They broke up and got back together, and their love against all odds culminated in their wedding episode. It was a good thing that Schmidt missed the actual wedding in the season 5 finale, &#34;Landing Gear,&#34; because their private ceremony in the loft was so much more impactful — it served as a callback to the roots of their relationship.





 3  Magnus &amp; Alec 
Shadowhunters
        

 Shadowhunters 

 Cast   Dominic Sherwood , Katherine McNamara    Seasons   3    




Shadowhunters may not have enjoyed the same success as the rest of the shows on this list, but its iconic couple, Alec and Magnus, had the most emotional wedding. Alec and Magnus came from two different worlds, both of which seemed to be against their relationship. Over the course of three seasons, the two defied all odds by proving their love for each other time and time again — Alec even left his fiancée at the altar for Magnus once. Finally, in the season 3 finale, &#34;All Good Things...,&#34; Alec and Magnus said their vows and became husbands amidst the demonic mayhem that was happening all around them.





 2  Marshall &amp; Lily 
How I Met Your Mother


 







 How I Met Your Mother 

 Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Seasons   9    




While Ted, Barney, and Robin couldn&#39;t get themselves together, romantically speaking, for the entire nine-season run of How I Met Your Mother, Marshall and Lily consistently showed what it meant to be a couple. Even though they had been together for years before the start of the series, Marshall and Lily had to temporarily part ways to find their way back to each other. In season 2, episode 21, &#34;Something Borrowed,&#34; Marshmallow and Lilypad&#39;s chaotic wedding day arrived, and of course, none of it went as planned. The love birds eventually stopped trying to fix everything and decided to tie the knot outside their venue with just the gang present.





 1  Leo &amp; Piper 
Charmed
        

 Charmed 

 Cast   Holly Marie Combs , Alyssa Milano , Rose McGowan    Seasons   8    




Leo and Piper&#39;s relationship timeline in Charmed was messy and complicated. People, demons, and the Elders kept getting in the way of their romance, but they persisted. Leo gave up his magical duty for Piper, and the latter dared to go against the Elders for Leo numerous times. Piper and Leo were the sweetest couple on the show, and it was pure bliss to see them exchange their vows — after two failed attempts — in season 3, episode 15, &#34;Just Harried.&#34; Not shedding a few tears when Piper and Leo finally said their &#34;I dos&#34; was out of the question.
