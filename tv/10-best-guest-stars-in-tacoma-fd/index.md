## Literature Review
Since Tacoma FD started in 2019, there have been many funny guest stars on the truTV comedy, but only 10 have stood out to be the best.




Tacoma FD has had many famous guest stars since it began in 2019, but only 10 of those guests should be considered the best. From Whitney Cummings to Jeff Dunham, each guest star has uniquely impacted the station and the audience. Whether they are fellow firefighters or victims of emergencies, the firefighters over at the Tacoma Fire Department have had their fair share of excitement and laughs.
The show is based in Tacoma, Washington, one of the rainiest parts of the country, as firefighters tackle their regular duties, compete in friendly competition, and respond to strange emergency calls. At the helm of the Tacoma Fire Department is Chief Terry McConky and Captain Eddie Penisi, whose attempts to keep control often end in mayhem. Alongside the regular firefighters of the Tacoma Fire Department are guest stars who also leave chaos in their wake and leave an impact. Though Tacoma FD season 5 hasn&#39;t been renewed yet, the number of memorable guest stars could still grow over time.









 








 10  Whitney Cummings 
Courtney Brixton (season 3, episode 5, &#34;Carpet Diem&#34;)


 







Whitney Cummings&#39; guest appearance in Tacoma FD season 3 comes after the team gets a sexual harassment complaint from a citizen. The city brings in a trainer named Courtney (Cummings) to do a sexual harassment workshop with the firefighters, and she quickly puts them in their place. Eddie develops a crush on her and immediately has to figure out how to flirt without harassing her. He attempts everything to impress her, even breakdancing. Cummings&#39; guest appearance as Courtney is spiky and funny, bringing the guys of the stations to their knees as she shows them that women can do anything and everything.





 9  Bobby Moynihan 
Jumper Jim (season 2, episode 8, &#34;The Crying Game&#34;)
        

In a surprisingly intense moment with the Chief, Bobby Moynihan&#39;s appearance as Jumper Jim in Tacoma FD season 2 starts as he is talked down off a ledge. Jumper Jim argues about movies, Ryan Reynolds, and even his own family with the Chief. As they open up to each other, Jumper Jim eventually feels touched enough to not want to jump. In an attempt to thank the Chief by hugging him, both the Chief and Jumper Jim accidentally fall off the roof onto a crash pad in relatively good spirits. The former SNL star makes a memorable mark with his oddball character.





 8  Will Sasso 
Gene Ghoulib (season 1, episode 6, &#34;Full Moon Fever&#34;)
        

Will Sasso&#39;s guest appearance as Volunteer Firefighter Gene Ghoulib in Tacoma FD season 1 starts on the wrong foot with Lucy, who calls him &#34;woke&#34; after he unknowingly insults her ability as a firefighter when he comes in to help out with the team during a full moon. When Lucy is stuck at the station while the guys respond to a call, Ghoulib drives her insane with movie trivia and pokes fun at her for being a female firefighter. With a distinctive laugh and spouting of random historical facts, Sasso&#39;s Tacoma FD character is as strange as the full moon that the episode is based on.

 7  Brett Davern 
Cousin Terry (season 4, episode 4, &#34;Who Gives A-Shift?&#34;)
        

A member of Tacoma FD&#39;s McConky-Penisi family, Brett Davern&#39;s cousin Terry is a part of the &#34;D&#34; shift at Station 24. He is very close to his uncle Terry, which makes cousin Lucy extremely jealous. She yells at him in front of everyone, accusing him of stealing her father&#39;s attention. He is a bit of a joker when it comes to family, but when the pride of his crew comes under threat, he jumps into action. Alongside his team, he competes in a competition to determine which is the best shift at the station. The Awkward alum&#39;s appearance on Tacoma FD may be brief, but it is memorable.





 6  Dana DeLorenzo 
Gigi Bonaro (season 4, episode 6, &#34;Valentine&#39;s Day&#34;)
        

Dana DeLorenzo&#39;s Gigi Bonaro may be a dispatcher in Tacoma FD season 4, but that doesn&#39;t stop her from making Eddie&#39;s life miserable after he dumps her in an attempt to keep his out-of-control love life in control. As one of Eddie&#39;s eight romances for Valentine&#39;s Day, the former Ash vs. Evil Dead actress uses her dispatcher abilities to punish Eddie and his team by sending them to calls that aren&#39;t in their jurisdiction. She eventually shows up at the station and confronts Eddie, saying, &#34;Thank you for opening my eyes. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not with you. Goodbye.&#34;





 5  Flula Borg 
Antonin Aroma (season 3, episode 7 &#34;The Quiet Party&#34;)
        

When Terry decides to try to find a cologne that suits him, he learns about Antonin Aroma, played by Pitch Perfect 2&#39;s Flula Borg, in Tacoma FD season 3. As Eddie&#39;s so-called scent mentor, Aroma&#39;s brutally honest sales pitch to find the perfect cologne match leaves the Chief learning a lot about the sex appeal of colognes. With the use of his scent pyramid to explain how cologne works, Aroma&#39;s over-the-top flamboyance and sales pitch eventually make the Captain go to a different source for help with the cologne hunt.





 4  M.C. Gainey 
Buddy McSwiggins (season 4, episode 9, &#34;Gone Dutch&#34;)
        

M.C. Gainey has been in numerous movies during his career, including Disney&#39;s Tangled, with him bringing sarcastic humor to his guest appearance in Tacoma FD season 4. During a wake for Firefighter Captain &#34;Smilin&#34; Dutch Engels, MC Gainey appears as Buddy McSwiggins, a wisecracking firefighter who plays jokes and tells funny stories to Terry, usually at the Chief&#39;s expense. McSwiggins even goes as far as to give a brutally honest speech about Dutch with plenty of jokes involved. Gainey&#39;s character has no shame about roasting Terry whenever possible and even goes as far as to call the Chief out after the Chief messes up his own speech.





 3  David Arquette 
Captain Teddy Dickosi (season 4, episode 4, &#34;Who Gives A-Shift?&#34;)
        

Tacoma FD season 4 is one of the wildest seasons of the show, with plenty of good guest stars, including Scream&#39;s David Arquette. As the leader of one of the other shifts at the station, Arquette&#39;s Captain Teddy Dickosi is determined to have his team be the best of the shifts. From arranging a tug-of-war with a fire hose to suggesting a trivia contest about the Chief, Arquette&#39;s character holds nothing back when it comes to competitions. As part of a team, his leadership skills and competition come to the forefront when it comes to competing against Peniski.





 2  Jimmy Tatro 
Sergeant Shuck (season 1, episode 2, &#34;Cop Wars&#34;)


 







Tacoma FD is known for friendly competition and practical jokes, especially when it comes to the police officers. When Jimmy Tatro&#39;s Sergeant Shuck ends up on the receiving end of an angry ex-girlfriend thanks to the fire department in Tacoma FD season 1, the ultimate prank war is on between the first responders. The character played by the Home Economics star is hilarious and leaves a lasting impression as someone that the firefighters should not cross when it comes to prank wars.





 1  Jeff Dunham 
Ventriloquist (season 2, episode 3, &#34;Whodunit?&#34;)
        

In one of the strangest rescues on Tacoma FD, real-life ventriloquist Jeff Dunham&#39;s appearance on the show consists of him lying on the ground with a stab injury. Lying next to Dunham is his dummy, who is holding a knife and won&#39;t stop talking. While trying to tell the firefighters what happened, the ventriloquist requests that the dummy be saved first. Granny immediately tells the team to give the dummy CPR instead of the ventriloquist, which results in Penisi wondering what is going on. The ventriloquist&#39;s dummy does not stop talking throughout the entire rescue, even giving first aid advice to the first responders.
