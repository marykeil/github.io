## Literature Review
The Bachelor season 28 is ready to sever up the drama for tennis instructor Joey Graziadei as he looks for a different kind of love amidst drama.




The Bachelor season 28 promises an unprecedented first for Bachelor Nation in its newest trailer. The series is giving professional tennis instructor Joey Graziadei the match of a lifetime to find an entirely different kind of love, though it won’t be easy as he tries to make connections within several different pairs. After getting rejected by Charity Lawson on The Bachelorette season 20, Joey was named the next lead of the franchise and shared that he was ready to find the love of a lifetime. While he had an incredible transformation on The Bachelorette, Joey’s time as the lead on The Bachelor looks like a dramatic, overwhelming journey.




In a trailer for the upcoming season of The Bachelor, Joey is shown making connections with several women in The Bachelor season 28 cast who are hoping to be the one to win his heart. Despite feeling strongly for many women, Joey’s journey seems like it takes a major twist toward the end of the season, as he narrows things down and hones in on his deepest connections.


 

During the trailer, Joey appears as though he’s being broken up with not once, but multiple times throughout the process. He shared that rejection is a huge fear, opening up that “with Charity, I tried to get down on one knee, and I was stopped,” Joey explained tearfully to the cameras. &#34;So my biggest fear is the one walking out. I&#39;m afraid of someone not accepting me for me.”

Joey’s time on The Bachelor season 28 doesn’t come without some drama, especially when it comes to the way the women are behaving toward each other. While Joey does his best to narrow down the group and make deeper connections, it seems as though the women of his season are having some drama of their own. During the trailer, Joey shared that he felt one of the women in the group was lying to him, but with multiple versions of the same story floating around, he couldn’t be sure. “I don’t know which one to believe,” Joey explained, “and I don’t know if I’ll be able to go forward.”





 

While Joey seems to have a difficult time during his stint as the lead on The Bachelor, the drama of the season is what will make it worth watching. Despite being labeled as one of the most dramatic seasons of all time, Bachelor Nation host Jesse Palmer also explained that it’ll be a romantic, picturesque world-wide journey as Joey tries to find the love of his life. While it may not be easy, the season will provide a huge amount of drama and, hopefully, end on a happy note with Joey and the woman he’s fallen for moving into the next phase of their life together.

As Joey gets ready for the world to see his turn as The Bachelor, many are hoping to get hints about how his season ends up. While the winner of The Bachelor season 28 may have already been spoiled, Joey’s time as the lead is about more than the end result. With high drama and an interesting journey for both Joey and the women he’ll be dating, the season is looking to be one of the most exciting in The Bachelor history.
