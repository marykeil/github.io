## Literature Review
Sister Wives&#39; Christine Brown gushes about her new life with David Woolley as she opens up about whether she&#39;ll keep Kody Brown&#39;s last name forever.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown finally revealed if she will continue using her ex&#39;s last name despite having married David Woolley. Kody Brown, now 54 years old, made Christine the third of his four wives in March 1994. Christine Ruth Allred was born on April 18, 1972, to practicing polygamists Rex Allred and Ruthann LeBaron. Christine’s grandfather Rulon C. Allred was the founder of the Apostolic United Brethren. Even though they’d only “spiritually married” and their marriage wasn’t legally binding, Christine changed her last name to Brown. Christine and Kody publicly announced their split in November 2021. Christine found David online in October 2022 and got married to him in October 2023.




There have been questions over why Christine hasn’t changed her last name yet after splitting up with Kody. In a recent interview with ET, Christine, 51, shared that she plans to do so. “I will change it legally to Christine Woolley, but I&#39;ll still be known as Christine Brown,” she explained. Christine said that she’s been Christine Brown for 14 years. However, she admitted she “will be Christine Woolley, definitely.&#34; Christine gushed about having an “instant connection” with David. “We just made sense. It just synced up,&#34; she added.

Christine was with Kody for 25 years. They had six children together, and the youngest, Truly Brown, was born when they were filming Sister Wives season 1.

Christine revealed that she’d finally found the love of her life.





 

Christine admitted that she already started looking at wedding dresses within a month of meeting David. “I had no idea it felt like this or would feel like this. It really is a dream come true,&#34; Christine said about her husband. David popped the question to Christine in April 2023. They got married within a few months in Moab, Utah.

He’s also calling out two of his wives for “trash talking&#34; about him and admitting that he is “guilty” of not loving them. Kody’s relationships with Janelle, Christine, and his first wife Meri are beyond the point of reconciliation. Christine was the first to leave Kody and, within 14 months, three of his marriages ended. Now Kody is only in a relationship with his fourth wife, Robyn Brown.

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
