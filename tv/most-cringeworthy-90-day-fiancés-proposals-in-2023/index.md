## Literature Review
While some 90 Day Fiancé stars proposed to their partners in the most romantic way in 2023, others disappointed viewers with their awkward speeches.




90 Day Fiancé is a show about romance and proposals, but sometimes they can be cringe-worthy to watch. Like every year, the 90 Day Fiancé franchise was full of mind-boggling moments in 2023. One moment comes from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 when Daniele Gates revealed that her husband, Yohan Geronimo, had stolen money from her bank account. She later accused him of infidelity and shared that she had evidence that he cheated on her with at least six different women over the span of their one-year marriage.




Rob Warne’s apartment issue in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 was also cringeworthy. He had invited his British girlfriend, Sophie Sierra, to live with him in the United States. However, he did it without his apartment being fully prepared, which didn’t even include a bathroom. The couple spent multiple episodes arguing about the plumbing issues, something many didn’t expect. Kalani Faagata also dropped a wild bombshell on 90 Day: The Last Resort. She opened up about Asuelu Pulaa’s cheating scandal and described how he got an STD. She spared no detail, making viewers squirm.

 Rob Warne Proposes To Sophie At The Airport 
          




The shocking revelations weren’t the only cringeworthy moments in 90 Day Fiancé in 2023, as plenty of proposals also made viewers cringe. One of the most recent examples comes from 90 Day Fiancé season 10, where Rob danced for Sophie. The Los Angeles native had planned to woo her with his dance at the airport. However, he didn’t do it properly. Instead, he chose to do a 20-second performance for her that didn’t look romantic. Rob then prematurely asked Sophie to marry her as she recovered from the trauma of his dance.



 Jasmine Pineda Begs Gino Palazzolo To Marry Her 
          

Jasmine Pineda’s proposal to Gino Palazzolo was a wild highlight of 2023. Before appearing on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, Jasmine was already engaged to Gino. However, she broke up with him because he didn’t obey her demands in the earlier episodes. When Gino decided to leave Jasmine alone, reality hit her in the face. She realized her life, hopes, and dreams could end fast. Therefore, she decided to cry and beg Gino to take her back. Luckily for her, he did.






 Brandan Dennucio’s Awkward Proposal To Mary Demasu-ay 
         

Fans have seen plenty of terrible couples on 90 Day Fiancé and its spin-offs over the last ten years. However, none have been as cringe-inducing as Brandan Dennucio and Mary Demasu-ay from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. When the two newcomers debuted in the series in 2023, they shockingly revealed that they always stay connected on the phone 24/7. As if that wasn’t bad enough, they shared that they were only 23 and wanted to settle in the Philippines without any source of income. Fans could see all the red flags from the start, but they didn’t see the terrible proposal that came after.

Brandan proposed to Mary a few episodes after he landed in the Philippines and got her pregnant. However, he did it in the most awkward way possible. He took Mary to their store’s storage space and eventually uttered the most ridiculous, underwhelming proposal speech ever. He said, “You know I love you, and I don’t know how else to say this,” and gave her a ring with “I’m enough” engraved. As expected, Mary wasn’t happy with Brandan’s effortless proposal.

 Nicola Kanaan Shocks Meisha Johnson With Public Proposal 
          

Nicola Kanaan’s proposal to Meisha Johnson wasn’t terrible but premature. The Israeli native had been a virgin for 40 years and had no relationship experience, let alone experience proposing. As expected, he had no idea how to make his American girlfriend feel special and asked her to marry him in the most awkward place possible. Nicole proposed to Meisha while walking through a congested local street. He got down on one knee and and said, “I was waiting for a woman like you,” while adding that he didn’t even bring a ring.






 Christian Allgood’s Half-Hearted, Half-Baked Proposal To Cleo Corraine 
         

Cleo Corraine and Christian Allgood had a toxic relationship that seemed one-sided. The introvert Cleo was very much into Christian but felt hurt that he talked to random women at bars. In comparison, extrovert Christian claimed he was sociable and liked to befriend people. Cleo called Christian out during the Tell All about his behavior toward her. However, he decided to propose to her to get the heat off his back. Most fans could see right through Christrian’s act. Unfortunately, Cleo didn’t see it and is still pursuing a future with him.



 Big Ed’s Boastful Proposal To Liz Woods After 11 Breakups 
         




Big Ed Brown and Liz’ Woods’ relationship is probably the worst in 90 Day Fiancé franchise history. The 58-year-old Arkansas native’s romance with the 30-year-old single mom was already questionable from the very beginning. However, nobody expected their relationship to become as terrible as it became over the season. Ed and Liz broke up 11 times in the first two years of their relationship. They had no compatibility, and Ed’s terrible attitude only worsened things. At one point, Ed even kicked Liz out and made her sleep in her car. Despite their awful relationship, Liz stayed with him.

When Ed proposed to Liz in 2022, it was cringeworthy. He seemed very boastful, and it didn’t resonate with viewers. The proposal played out when Ed took Liz on a date. He talked about their six-month-long breakup and used it to state that he missed her. He then smiled and spoke to the cameras about his healthy discussion with Liz about himself. He almost didn’t seem sorry for what he did to her, but happy that he got her back. The 90 Day Fiancé alum also boastfully shared that the ring cost him $13,100, stating that Liz now has 13,100 reasons not to leave him.
