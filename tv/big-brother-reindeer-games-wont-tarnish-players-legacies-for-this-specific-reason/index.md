## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games is a hit with fans, but some are curious if participating in the competition will tarnish the reputation of the BB legends.




Big Brother Reindeer Games may be a completely different series than the original Big Brother, but some are wondering if appearing on the spin-off could tarnish BB legends reputations. Big Brother Reindeer Games is crushing expectations as it continues on its six-episode run. While many felt that BB Reindeer Games wouldn’t be of interest, it’s actually standing out as one of the best seasons of strategic competition Big Brother has ever had. Combining Big Brother legends like Britney Haynes, Danielle Reyes, and Frankie Grande along with interesting strategy-based competitions that require physical and social skills has made for a fascinating series, one that BB fans are excited about.




Some fans on Reddit are wondering if their appearances on Big Brother Reindeer Games, despite the popularity of the series, could tarnish the reputation of the BB legends on the show. “If a winner like Taylor, Xavier, or Cody gets eliminated early does that change how you rank them?” u/xsparkywindego asked, explaining, “I think I’ll feel the same about players like Nicole, Daniele and Britney no matter if they win or lose.” While some considered whether or not the show could change their feelings, many felt that appearing on Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 wouldn’t tarnish anyone’s reputation.

While some considered the idea, others like u/manmanchuck14 explained that their takes on the Big Brother Reindeer Games cast wouldn’t change due to the spin-ff series. “While it does definitely seem like there’s a strategic component,” the Reddit user explained, “it’s still wildly different than actual BB and the games just aren’t comparable. Their legacies as BB players stays the same because this isn’t BB.” Though Big Brother Reindeer Games has strategic components to it, the game is very different from the classic style of Big Brother that fans are used to watching. In competing in two separate games, the BB legend-status itself won’t disappear because of the spin-off.


 

While nobody&#39;s Big Brother legend status will be changing due to their involvement in Big Brother Reindeer Games, the winner of the game may actually become even more of a legend. It seems likely that, much like in the average season of Big Brother, viewers should be prepared to expect the unexpected. While many originally felt a competitive threat like Cody Calafiore or Xavier Prather would win the game, it&#39;s possible that a strategic player could take the win. At the mid-way point in the game, it seems possible that Britney, Taylor Hale, or Nicole Franzel could take the win on BB Reindeer Games.




After three exciting episodes, viewers are already excited for even more Big Brother Reindeer Games content. The episodes of the series have been doing well for CBS, and the series has been a hit with viewers who love Big Brother and are excited to see several BB legends coming out to compete for the $100,000 grand prize. While the cast are considered Big Brother legends, participating in Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 may place them into an even more elite level of gameplayer.
