## Literature Review
The Masked Singer panelist Nicole Scherzinger won&#39;t appear in season 11. Here&#39;s why she&#39;ll be missed from the mystery singing competition show.




The Masked Singer panelist Nicole Scherzinger won&#39;t appear in season 11 due to another commitment, and she will be greatly missed. In September 2023, The Masked Singer announced that singer Rita Ora would replace Nicole on the panel for season 11 while Nicole performed as Norma Desmond in the West End production of Sunset Boulevard in London. Rita joined original panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, and Ken Jeong, and host Nick Cannon. The Masked Singer season 11 began filming in September 2023.




Although Nicole sat out The Masked Singer season 11, she has expressed in the past that she loves the show and wants to continue with it for many seasons to come. Rita was most likely a temporary replacement for Nicole while she performed in London. Although Rita is certain to do a wonderful job, Nicole will be greatly missed as a panelist for many reasons.

 Nicole Scherzinger Is Knowledgeable 
          

Nicole has guessed so many Masked Singer contestants correctly over the years that Nick nicknamed her Sherlock Scherzy. Because of her background as a performer with Eden&#39;s Crush, The Pussycat Dolls, and her solo career, Nicole has crossed paths with many people in the industry. Nicole has also been in films such as Moana, appeared on television, including in Annie Live!, and judged The X Factor USA and UK, all of which contribute to her knowledge as well. Compared with Ken, who&#39;s known for making outrageous guesses, Nicole is a more serious guesser, who uses her expertise to give information that helps viewers figure out the identities of the contestants.






 Nicole Scherzinger Is Passionate 

 

Nicole clearly loves being a panelist on The Masked Singer. Her passion for the show comes through with her genuine and emotional reactions to the contestants&#39; performances and reveals. Nicole will enthusiastically cheer for performances that inspire her and isn&#39;t afraid to cry after performances that move her. When legendary actor and then-97-year-old Dick Van Dyke was revealed to be The Masked Singer season 9&#39;s Gnome, Nicole was brought to tears just to be in his presence. She told him that she and the whole world loved him so much, and it was an honor for him to be on the show. Nicole truly enjoys finding out who&#39;s behind each mask, and her enthusiasm is infectious.



 Nicole Scherzinger Is Fun 

 




Nicole brings her fun personality to every episode of The Masked Singer. She makes funny jokes, and interacts in hilarious ways with her fellow panelists. During the theme nights, Nicole immerses herself in the themes, wearing elaborate costumes, wigs, and makeup to bring each theme to life with the other panelists. From her Masked Singer season 9&#39;s DC Superheroes Night&#39;s Catwoman costume to season 10&#39;s Harry Potter Night&#39;s Hermione outfit, Nicole transformed her look to match each theme. It&#39;s always thrilling to see what she&#39;ll come up with next.



 Nicole Scherzinger Is Very Talented &amp; Entertaining 

 

Nicole has a stunning singing voice, which she&#39;s showcased many times on The Masked Singer stage. During The Masked Singer season 6, she sang on the show for the first time with contestant Jewel (Queen of Hearts), when they performed &#34;Dream On&#34; by Aerosmith. Since then, she&#39;s had several other extraordinary performances, including &#34;Memory&#34; (season 8), &#34;Rainbow Connection&#34; (with Kermit the Frog, Nick, and the panelists, season 8), &#34;Fame&#34; (season 8), &#34;Holding Out for a Hero&#34; (season 9), &#34;Meant to Be&#34; (with Victor Oladipo and Barry Zito, season 10), and &#34;Purple Rain&#34; (season 10). It&#39;s always a treat whenever Nicole sings during The Masked Singer.




The Masked Singer season 11 will certainly feel the absence of Nicole, since she&#39;s been such an important part of the show since the very beginning. The Masked Singer hasn&#39;t changed its panelists in ten seasons, and they&#39;ve developed a lovely rapport with each other. Although Rita will be a great addition to the panel, Nicole will be greatly missed during The Masked Singer season 11.

The Masked Singer season 10 finale airs Wednesday, December 20 at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
