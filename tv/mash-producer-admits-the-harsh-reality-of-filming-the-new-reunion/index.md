# MASH Producer Admits The Harsh Reality Of Filming The New Reunion


## SUMMARY 



  The recently released MASH reunion lacked the magic of previous reunions due to the actors doing their interviews separately, preventing interactions among the cast members.   The format of the 2023 special focused more on the history of MASH rather than on fun anecdotes and stories shared by the actors.   Despite its shortcomings, the 2023 MASH reunion was still a good project, considering the age of the cast members and its significance as a milestone year for the show.

## Literature Review
Co-executive producer John Scheinfeld reveals the harsh truth of filming the recently released two-hour reunion special presentation of MASH on Fox.




The MASH reunion co-executive producer John Scheinfeld reveals the harsh reality of doing the special. In celebration of its legendary finale&#39;s 40th anniversary, the surviving cast members of the groundbreaking war series came together for a two-hour look back at their time on the show. As exciting as it was, however, some production secrets somehow tone down the magic of the recently-released MASH reunion.




Speaking to TV Line, Scheinfeld opens up about how the MASH project came to be, including how they gathered all the materials featured in the project. Apparently, the interviews were done separately, meaning Alan Alda, who played Captain Benjamin &#34;Hawkeye&#34; Pierce, and the rest of the cast barely crossed paths with each other. Read his full quote below:


What we did is we shot two days here in L.A., and Wayne and Jamie and Burt and Gene were all here the same day. It was kind of a love-fest, lots of hugging, lots of memories and all of that. And then we shot three in New York — Alan, Loretta and Gary — all in one day, but they all had busy schedules so they came in on time and they did not cross paths. The thing I would say — and it made me feel good as a fan of the show, and I know you’re a fan as well, so maybe it’ll make you feel good to know this — is that it genuinely seems to be a family amongst that cast. It wasn’t just, “Oh, we worked together and it’s fine.” There seemed to be a genuine familial family there and even though it may be a little bit of time since they had seen each other, it’s all hugs and the “so great to see you!” kind of thing and that makes me feel good. Burt actually kind of says it near the end of the show, where he says that people genuinely like those characters but they also seem to understand that the actors all liked each other. And I think that came across in the quality of their work.






 Why MASH’s 2023 Reunion Is Ultimately Disappointing 
          

Considering how celebrated MASH is, there have already been reunions in the past — both officially and unofficially. The most recent one happened during an episode of Alda&#39;s podcast, Clear&#43;Vivid, where he brought on all the surviving cast members on the show — all of whom also participated in the Fox special. The difference is that the MASH reunion five years ago had more of a casual tone to it, with the actors sharing anecdotes and experiences. For its 30th anniversary, Fox also staged a reunion special, which brought the majority of the surviving cast members back on set for a relaxed look back on the war series.

Both of those projects are ultimately better than the most recent MASH reunion for a couple of reasons. Firstly, they gathered all the actors together, meaning there were interactions among them. Much has been said about how the writing made MASH the legendary show it became, but another factor in its success was the cast&#39;s chemistry. The 2023 special wasn&#39;t able to take advantage of that because everyone did their interviews separately. Secondly, the format didn&#39;t leave room for any fun stories. Instead, the Fox show was more of a rehash of MASH&#39;s history, which has been tackled many times before.




                  All 11 Seasons Of MASH, Ranked   MASH is one of the most groundbreaking shows ever. While it maintained its quality throughout its run, some of its seasons were better than others.    

While the Fox 2023 MASH reunion pales in comparison to its predecessors, it&#39;s still a good project. Considering the ages of the remaining cast members and its recent milestone year, it was the perfect time to stage another special, which could very well be its last. It would be brilliant if they could make another one in the near future, but for now, it will likely be the final one involving that specific group.
