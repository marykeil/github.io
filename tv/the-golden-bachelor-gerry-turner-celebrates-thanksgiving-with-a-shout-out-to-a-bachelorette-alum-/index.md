## Literature Review
Gerry Turner from The Golden Bachelor spent the Thanksgiving holiday surrounded by family. However, he did make a nod to one Bachelorette alum. 




Gerry Turner from The Golden Bachelor is celebrating Thanksgiving this week like every other American, but he also wanted to give a little shout-out to a Bachelorette alum. On The Golden Bachelor season 1, Gerry is a 72-year-old guy looking for a second chance at love after his wife passed away many years ago. He has been on this journey with the viewers since late September, and he may just get his happily ever after. However, Gerry&#39;s love life isn&#39;t the only thing the fans are keeping up with.




On November 23, Thanksgiving Day, Gerry posted an Instagram photo of his daughters and granddaughters, all rocking very large, ornate earrings. He wrote in the caption, &#34;Itâ€™s a Brayden kinda holiday. Thankful for friends!&#34; Along with the caption, Gerry also tagged Bachelorette alum and current Bachelor in Paradise contestant Brayden Bowers. Unknown to fans, Gerry and Brayden seemingly started a friendship since they are both a part of Bachelor Nation.

 Gerry&#39;s Family Wore Large Earrings For Brayden Bowers 
          

Gerry wanted his daughters and granddaughters to sport large earrings for his new friend Brayden. It seems Brayden saw the sweet nod to himself and couldn&#39;t help but leave a comment on Gerry&#39;s post. &#34;This made my day!!!,&#34; Brayden wrote in the comment section. Other Bachelor Nation contestants took to Gerry&#39;s comment section, such as Joan Vasso from The Golden Bachelor and Christina Mandrell from The Bachelor season 27. One fan was even confused by the photo, with one of Gerry&#39;s daughters, Angie Turner, clarifying that they were &#34;giving a shout out&#34; to one of their Bachelor Nation favorites, Brayden.




During Charity Lawson&#39;s season of The Bachelorette, in which Brayden was a contestant, he was known for wearing large, ostentatious earrings, and was the talk of the town among Bachelor fans. While Brayden didn&#39;t win over Charity and was actually considered the villain of her season, he did have another chance at love on Bachelor in Paradise season 9. Brayden is still in the running on BIP, so he could very well leave the season in a relationship or even be engaged.

It seems Gerry is having a little fun over the Thanksgiving holiday with his family by adding a sprinkle of Bachelor Nation to his festivities. Gerry is enjoying being part of the Bachelor family and has clearly become friends with Brayden following his time on the show. Maybe Leslie Fhima or Theresa Nist was there to play along in the Thanksgiving fun.



The Golden Bachelor finale airs November 30 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
