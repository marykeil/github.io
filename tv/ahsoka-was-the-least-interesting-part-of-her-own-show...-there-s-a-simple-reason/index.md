# Ahsoka Was The Least Interesting Part Of Her Own Show... &amp; There s A Simple Reason


## SUMMARY 



  Ahsoka Tano is considered the least interesting element of the show, despite Ahsoka being regarded as one of the best Star Wars TV shows of 2023.   The focus on Padawans in the Star Wars franchise has made their journeys more compelling than their Masters&#39;, leading to Sabine&#39;s storyline being more interesting than Ahsoka&#39;s in season 1.   Ahsoka episode 5, where Ahsoka reverts to being an Apprentice to Anakin Skywalker, was the show&#39;s best episode and showcased a more light-hearted and driven version of the character. Ahsoka season 2 should provide more trials and tribulations for Ahsoka to overcome to make her more interesting once again.

## Literature Review
Unfortunately, Ahsoka Tano was the least interesting aspect of her own Star Wars show, yet there is an understated reason as to why this was the case.




While Ahsoka was overall a great show, the titular character was unfortunately the least interesting element of the story, with one reason standing above others to explain why. Despite this drawback of Ahsoka Tano as a character, Ahsoka was widely regarded as one of the best Star Wars TV shows of 2023. One of the primary reasons for this was the rest of Ahsoka&#39;s cast of characters such as Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, Eman Esfandi as Ezra Bridger, Lars Mikkelsen as Grand Admiral Thrawn, and Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Sabine Wren.




These standout characters led many to highly anticipate Ahsoka season 2, as did the show&#39;s overall importance to the New Republic era alongside The Mandalorian and other upcoming Star Wars shows. Despite all of these positive aspects, it came as a disappointment that Ahsoka Tano herself was the least appealing aspect of the show. While some would argue this was due to the change in actor from Ashley Eckstein to Rosario Dawson, there is actually one simple reason behind Ahsoka&#39;s uninteresting solo story that ties more to the character than any actor who has portrayed the Togruta Jedi.


 Star Wars Is Always About Masters &amp; Apprentices... But Especially Apprentices 
          

Firstly, it is worth exploring the wider Star Wars franchise with some relevant context before exploring Ahsoka&#39;s titular character. Since the franchise began, most Star Wars stories have centered around Jedi Masters and Padawans, with more of a focus on the latter. The original Star Wars begins with the duo of Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Luke being the main character. The Empire Strikes Back is the same, only Obi-Wan is replaced by Yoda. In the final original trilogy film, The Return of the Jedi, Luke becomes the Master yet still has to prove he is not a Padawan out of his depth against Darth Vader and the Emperor.




This trend of focusing on Padawans continued with Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. From the exploration of Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s Jedi origins under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn to Anakin Skywalker&#39;s burgeoning Force abilities, the Padawans yet again received focus in the first prequel movie. Anakin was then the focus of both Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith to round out Lucas&#39; six films that focused on the Apprentices of Jedi Masters.

Finally, the sequel trilogy focused almost exclusively on Rey and Kylo Ren when concerning Force-sensitive characters. Rey was mentored by a few different Masters in the Star Wars sequels, namely the original trilogy trio of Han, Luke, and Leia in each film. Ben was similarly mentored by Luke, Snoke, and unknowingly Palpatine, yet both he and Rey remained the central characters of all three films.



 Sabine&#39;s Journey Was More Compelling Than Ahsoka&#39;s Own 
          




Concerning how these various Star Wars relationships apply to Ahsoka, it links to the Master-Padawan relationship the show built between Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren. This harkened back to the multitude of times in Star Wars&#39; past that projects have centered on a Master and Padawan, though it also followed the same trend of the latter being more compelling. Like Luke, Anakin, Rey, and Ben Solo before her, Sabine&#39;s journey in Ahsoka season 1 was more compelling than Ahsoka&#39;s as it had a clearer path.

All the aforementioned Padawans have a more defined journey than their Masters in each film or show, that being their drive to become a Jedi. This provides each one with a more compelling journey, with their Masters still serving as good characters though naturally less interesting as they are at the seeming end of their journey. This applies to Ahsoka who served as Sabine&#39;s Master in Ahsoka season 1. Ahsokaâ€™s trials and tribulations from Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels have already been overcome meaning her character is inherently less interesting in her solo adventure than Sabine whose Padawan status allows her to have a more complete arc.






 Star Wars&#39; Themes Explain Why Ahsoka Episode 5 Was Her Best Episode 
          

These recurring themes of Star Wars focusing on Masters and Padawans and the latter being more interesting explains why Ahsoka episode 5 was the show&#39;s - and the character&#39;s - best. Before Ahsoka episode 5, the titular Jedi was portrayed similarly to most Jedi Masters, stoic and emotionless, in a way that resembled former Star Wars characters like Qui-Gon Jinn or even Obi-Wan from the latter two prequels to an extent. This led many to criticize the writing behind Ahsoka&#39;s character for the opening of her show, something that ushered in a notable change in episode 5.



Herein lies the reason why Ahsoka episode 5 was the show&#39;s best episode both overall and in its depiction of its main character: Ahsoka was once again the Apprentice.







The premise of Ahsoka episode 5 was the titular character awakening in the World Between Worlds to be confronted by her former Master, Anakin Skywalker. Anakin insisted that he still had lessons to teach Ahsoka, taking her on a journey of self-discovery that many thought would not be possible after Ahsoka&#39;s first four episodes. Herein lies the reason why Ahsoka episode 5 was the show&#39;s best episode both overall and in its depiction of its main character: Ahsoka was once again the Apprentice.

Ahsoka&#39;s journey with Anakin not only reverted Ahsoka to her more childlike form from Star Wars: The Clone Wars which allowed for slightly more emotion, but it allowed the character to undergo a significant change. Rather than be the complete, almost expressionless Jedi Master of Sabine, she became someone who needed to learn and strive to be better. Ahsoka episode 5&#39;s arc saw her take on a noticeably more light-hearted role in the show&#39;s latter episodes thanks to her time as a renewed apprentice.






 What Can Ahsoka Season 2 Learn From This? 
         

This all begs the question of how Ahsoka season 2 can learn from this reality. With many aware that Ahsoka&#39;s interest as a character mainly comes from her struggles and overcoming them, Ahsoka season 2 needs to give its titular character much more trials and tribulations than season 1 did. Only in Ahsoka episode 5 was the character shown to have a renewed drive to overcome obstacles, something that Ahsoka season 2 desperately needs to continue.



Ahsoka season 2 does not have a confirmed release date as of yet. but it is expected to be officially announced in 2024.




Interestingly, Ahsoka has already laid the foundations for this kind of story in season 2. The ending of Ahsoka season 1 saw the titular character and Sabine stranded on Peridea with a sinister plot underway from Baylan Skoll. Joined by Anakin Skywalker and the spirits of the Mortis Gods, Ahsoka season 2 seems to be promising a much more consequential story for the character than the first season. This could allow her to shine in a way that Ahsoka season 1 did not, rectifying the mistake of disinterest and once again making the now-iconic Togruta Jedi one of Star Wars&#39; most compelling characters.
