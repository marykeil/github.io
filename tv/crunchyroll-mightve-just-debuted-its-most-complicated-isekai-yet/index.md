## Literature Review
Sasaki and Peeps&#39; 48-minute debut episode contains so many tropes that it isn&#39;t a stretch to say it might be Crunchyroll&#39;s most complex Isekai. 




Warning: Spoilers for Sasaki and Peeps episode #1




Although Crunchyroll already has a very healthy selection of highly complex Isekai anime in its well-stocked arsenal, the 48-minute debut episode of the new series Sasaki and Peeps has already introduced a very layered premise that incorporates many different Isekai tropes. Best of all, these beloved storylines get much more nuanced when the series introduces a well-known convention from a completely different type of anime series.

Adapted from the light novel series by writer Buncololi and illustrator Kantoku, Sasaki and Peeps&#39; debut episode features as many Isekai tropes as it does just because the two eponymous characters come from completely different backgrounds. So, when they inevitably team up, the resulting story becomes quite nuanced. Peeps is the type of hero who gets reverse Isekai and reincarnates as an animal, before his adventure brings him back home with the help of Sasaki.

          




Meanwhile, Sasaki undergoes more of a double Isekai type of experience by going back and forth between both worlds, and adopts the same mindset as the protagonist in Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for My Retirement.

This already quite layered adventure soon gets much more complex and impressive when the series introduces yet another variable. A common storyline in anime involves supernatural abilities suddenly manifesting in an otherwise normal protagonist who then gets roped into a secret government organization that specializes either in investigating supernatural phenomena or hunting the creatures that cause them. This happens to Sasaki after the magic he learns from Peeps catches the attention of the Paranormal Phenomena Countermeasure Bureau, which investigates humans who gain psychic powers on Earth.




In most anime, the protagonist emphatically embraces their new employer since they either always wanted to be special or joining would help them achieve their personal goals. However, Sasaki is much more interested in further pursuing his Isekai shenanigans with Peeps rather than his new organization, which naturally creates the main conflict of the series thus far. Each of the aforementioned Isekai tropes that Sasaki and Peeps have undergone together then pleasantly clashes with the &#34;paranormal agency&#34; plot, creating something wholly unique.



 Sasaki and Peeps Uses Other Celebrated Anime Tropes 
          

Sasaki and Peeps also explores many other successful anime tropes beyond Isekai that will hopefully catch the attention of more viewers. Probably the most effective of them is how Sasaki&#39;s use of magic is much more powerful than the abilities that Earth psychics get. Many series have captured this overpowered hero dynamic to their benefit, especially in Isekai, whose fans generally enjoy watching the protagonist excel beyond all else. Sasaki and Peeps&#39; explanation, however, is much more acceptable than most series, due to the inherent differences between Earth&#39;s psychic powers and Sasaki&#39;s magic.




Sasaki and Peeps&#39; long 48-minute debut episode provides viewers with more of a chance to fully comprehend the complete scope of its highly complex series, while other new series like Solo Leveling only give viewers part of the whole package. Hopefully, Crunchyroll&#39;s strategy for Sasaki and Peeps&#39; premiere will attract more viewers, so more fans can fully appreciate its unique take on Isekai.
