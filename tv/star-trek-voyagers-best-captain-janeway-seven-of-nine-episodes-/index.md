## Literature Review
Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) had essential roles on Star Trek: Voyager. Here&#39;s a look at their best episodes.




The relationship between Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) on Star Trek: Voyager led to some of the series&#39; most interesting and engaging episodes. The strong female dynamic between the two characters over Janeway&#39;s rescue and subsequent mentorship of Seven of Nine led to an arc of growth and empowerment for both women. With Seven&#39;s introduction designed to counterweight Janeway&#39;s character, their interactions initiated personal and emotional enrichment that enhanced the show and propelled momentum. Though Kate Mulgrew and Jeri Ryan&#39;s relationship was problematic behind the scenes, Mulgrew has since acknowledged the depth Seven of Nine added to Voyager and Captain Janeway herself.
Star Trek: Voyager – introducing Captain Janeway as Star Trek&#39;s first female lead -portrayed both women as strong, capable, intelligent characters, formidable, and impressive. Janeway is a stubborn and steadfast Captain, leading an isolated crew of roughly 150 through unexplored space on a quest to return to the Alpha Quadrant. Seven of Nine, a survivor of Borg assimilation and unofficial addition to the USS Voyager&#39;s crew, works through trauma to explore and regain her sense of humanity, individuality, and independence. Here&#39;s a look at the best and most significant Star Trek: Voyager episodes for Captain Kathryn Janeway and Seven of Nine.

Captain Janeway establishes a tentative accord with the Borg Collective to defeat Species 8472 in the Star Trek: Voyager season 4 premiere. Assigned Seven of Nine as a liaison, Janeway returns to the USS Voyager severely injured following the destruction of the Borg Cube. When Seven of Nine&#39;s Borg implant is later overloaded and pre-assimilated memories as a young human girl dislodged, her connection to the Collective is severed. Recognizing Seven&#39;s value as more than a mere drone bent on efficiency, Janeway considers maintaining her on board Voyager and helping to reassert Seven&#39;s individuality, embarking on a mentorship arc and relationship that would lead to a journey of self-reclamation, self-discovery, and growth.

Refusing Seven’s demands to return to the Collective as tantamount to “tossing her back to the wolves,” Janeway attempts to foster recognition of Seven’s regained humanity, suggesting Seven is now part of a Human Collective. Janeway provides information on Seven’s life before assimilation and establishes a connection that leads to a breakthrough in the former drone accepting a new sense of self post-Borg.

With Captain Janeway taking a hands-on role to aid Seven&#39;s transition into reclaiming her humanity and sense of individuality, the episode explores Seven&#39;s pre-Borg life as the young Annika Hansen. Using Voyager&#39;s holodeck simulation technology, Janeway attempts to teach Seven the importance of relaxation, creativity, and expression, suggesting Seven read her parents&#39; scientific work to encourage her imagination.

Janeway&#39;s uncertainties over Seven and her fears of a traumatic return to the Borg&#39;s Collective are also highlighted, along with the revelation of secret Borg transmissions.

A future-reality Admiral Janeway travels into the past in Star Trek: Voyager’s epic series finale to warn her younger self about an imminent Borg attack and assist the crew in their journey home. Originally ending with the alternate death of Seven of Nine, “Endgame” sees the older Admiral Janeway sacrificing herself to destroy the Borg. The iconic two-part episode demonstrates Janeway’s deep emotional connection to her crew, and particularly to Seven of Nine – with the Admiral using the revelation of Seven’s impending demise to steer the Captain’s actions – as well as the Admiral’s own reaction to seeing Seven alive. It’s a weighty and bittersweet, but meaningful moment for Voyager’s finale episode.
