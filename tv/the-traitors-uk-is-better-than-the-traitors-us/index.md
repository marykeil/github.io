## Literature Review
The Traitors UK and The Traitors US are both back for season 2. However, the original UK series is still better than the US version. Here&#39;s why.




The Traitors UK and The Traitors US season 2 have just dropped, but The Traitors UK continues to prove the British version is better than its American counterpart. Both versions of two of the best reality TV shows have gripped audiences with its suspenseful premise: a group of contestants are forced to work together, each unaware that hidden traitors exist among them. As the traitors secretly eliminate their fellow players, the remaining contestants, called the faithful, grapple with suspicion and paranoia, trying to uncover the identities of the traitors before losing out on a bunch of cash.




Significant differences exist between The Traitors UK season 2 and The Traitors US season 2. While both occur in a Scottish castle and feature murders in the dead of night and similar challenges, the differences are vital to their success. It&#39;s important to note the British version is the original, and while some American spinoffs of British television surpass their inspiration, The Traitors is not one of those series. Some may think The Traitors US is better than the original, but here&#39;s why that isn&#39;t true.


 Regular Cast Members Offer More Character Development Than Celebrities

Regular contestants on The Traitors UK lack the carefully crafted personas that celebrities often project, allowing their true personalities to shine. Their unfiltered reactions, genuine emotions, and relatable struggles provide a deeper connection with the audience and make them more unpredictable, which makes for better gameplay. While Paul Gorton has a game show past, he is relatively unknown, less guarded, and more relatable than celebrities in the US version.

As contestants on The Traitors UK navigate the world of deception and suspicion, they grapple with their perceptions of trust, loyalty, and betrayal. Additionally, they are less worried about how they are perceived, as they can return to their everyday lives after The Traitors. While some will ironically become famous due to their performance on the show, they were unknown during filming.



 Celebrities Who Have Already Done Competition Shows Have A Leg Up 
         






 
The Traitors US cast celebrities who have competed on shows such as The Challenge, Survivor, and Big Brother. However, they also cast housewives such as Phaedra Parks and Larsa Pippen and contestants from other reality TV shows such as Kevin Kreider from Bling Empire and Peppermint from RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race. The celebrities who had to use deception and cunning to win a difficult competition show that relied on ascertaining others&#39; motivations and weaknesses undoubtedly have a leg up over celebrities from Love Island or The Real Housewives. In The Traitors UK, everyone is on a more even playing field.



 Regular People Have More Motivation To Win The Money

Regular contestants on The Traitors UK are more motivated to win the money than their celebrity counterparts. This is because winning the prize can represent a significant financial breakthrough for them, potentially changing their lives and providing them with opportunities they may not have otherwise. For celebrities with wealth and fame, money may not have the same allure or impact. While they&#39;re motivated to get clout, they&#39;ll get that regardless of appearing on the show.




Many of the contestants on The Traitors UK expressed a desire to use the reward cash to pay off debts, support their families, or pursue their true passions. The potential to achieve these goals through winning the prize money can fuel their determination and drive their strategic gameplay. In contrast, celebrities may have already achieved financial stability or have access to other means of generating income, making the prize money superfluous.



 Celebrities Promote Their Brand Rather Than Play A Good Game 
          

The Traitors US seems so much more fake than The Traitors UK because celebrities use the show to promote their personal brand rather than play a good game. In the first episodes, the talking heads of celebrities included their common speech patterns and catchphrases rather than a genuine game plan. For example, Peppermint likely hurt her game because she was trying to exude her personality on RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race rather than defend herself properly when accused of being a traitor. This was unfortunate because she&#39;s such a fun reality TV staple. Similarly, Parvati made winning Survivor her whole personality, which may easily expose her later on as a traitor.




While both iterations are great shows, The Traitors UK is undoubtedly better than The Traitors US. Regular people raise the stakes and introduce viewers to new potential reality TV stars rather than bringing together established stars from other shows. The Traitors UK has higher stakes, is more unpredictable, and is more genuine.



The Traitors UK airs Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays on BBC. The Traitors US streams Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on Peacock.
