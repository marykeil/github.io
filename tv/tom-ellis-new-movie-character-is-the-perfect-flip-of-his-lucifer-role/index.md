## Literature Review
Tom Ellis is best known for playing the titular character in the popular show Lucifer, and his upcoming role is an absolute perfect flip of that.




Tom Ellis is best known for portraying the titular player in the popular series, Lucifer, and his latest movie role is the perfect flip of that. Airing from 2016 to 2021, Lucifer followed a former servant in Hell who decided to come to Earth to better understand humanity. Though drawn to things like women and wine, Lucifer has a wake-up call when someone is murdered outside of an upscale nightclub. Lucifer is called to help, feeling an unfamiliar sense of compassion and sympathy that leads him to a female homicide detective named Chloe who seems to inherently have these great qualities.




Though the show has a fascinating premise that has made it a hit, Lucifer and Chloe&#39;s relationship is one of the most intriguing parts of the show. Their &#34;will they, won&#39;t they&#34; dynamic was captivating and kept audiences on their toes. Lucifer&#39;s transition from being a player to someone who wants to settle down was one of the defining markers of the series, and his new project puts him in a completely different (yet exciting) set of shoes.


 Tom Ellis&#39; Players Character Puts Him In The Shoes Of Lucifer&#39;s Chloe 
In the show Lucifer, Tom Ellis plays the titular character who is a player through and through. From the beginning, Lucifer takes a strong liking to a woman named Chloe Decker, though she does not reciprocate his feelings. He tries to utilize all of his charms to win her over, thinking that because they had worked for a number of women in the past, they would in this case as well. Chloe did not give in easily, though and Lucifer had to chase her for two of Lucifer&#39;s seasons. It was not until two full seasons of angst and many efforts on Lucifer&#39;s part that his and Chloe&#39;s official relationship timeline began.




While Tom Ellis played the player role very well, he is now the one who is being chased. In the movie Players, Ellis plays a character who is being chased by a woman portrayed by Jane the Virgin&#39;s Gina Rodriguez. While it&#39;s unclear based on what is currently known about Players what Ellis&#39; full role will look like, early trailers show Rodriguez&#39;s character falling for him and going after him.



 What Tom Ellis Has Done Since Lucifer 
          

Since Tom Ellis wrapped up Lucifer, he has lent his voice to the animated series Exploding Kittens. He has also had guest appearances in Robot Chicken and The Great North, both of which he served as a voice actor. Players marks his return to more traditional acting, and Ellis is confirmed to also star opposite Emma Roberts in the dramedy series Second Wife.
