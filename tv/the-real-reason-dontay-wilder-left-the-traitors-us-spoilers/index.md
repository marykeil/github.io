Summary

  Deontay Wilder left The Traitors US after Maksim&#39;s banishment - the first player to leave for non-murder or banishment reasons.   The all-star cast of reality TV legends adds drama to the show as they try to determine who the Traitors are.   Deontay struggled with betraying his friends, causing him emotional distress and likely leading to his departure.  







The Traitors US season 2 has lost its first player to something other than murder or banishment as Deontay Wilder, former heavyweight boxing champion, decided to leave the castle after Maksim Chmerkovskiy’s traumatic banishment. During The Traitors US season 2 episode 3, the round table found Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling in the hot seat for an early portion of the questioning, but Deontay vouched for Dan and turned things onto Maksim, who he’d found suspicious all day. Deontay had explained he’d struggled with RuPaul’s Drag Race star Peppermint’s round table banishment in previous episodes, but his state after accusing Maksim and finding out he was a Faithful was worse.

With an all-star cast of reality TV legends and entertainment personalities, the stakes were high from the very beginning on The Traitors US season 2. Deontay was joined by some of the greatest strategic minds of reality TV, and some of the most entertaining personalities that have been part of the entertainment world. With so many large voices in one place, things were bound to get dramatic as the group of Faithful tried to figure out who amongst them were Traitors. Despite knowing how the game worked ahead of time, Deontay had difficulty in betraying those he felt were friends.

 Deontay Shared With Screen Rant That He Had A Hard Time Hurting People 
          

During an interview conducted before The Traitors US season 2 episode 4’s availability, Deontay shared that the hardest thing about the series for him was causing people pain. “I’m a people’s person and I love people…we all need each other,” Deontay explained. “You get a lot of traitors in my profession, so I’m used that world.” Deontay was open about the fact the he felt he would’ve done better as a traitor, sharing, “I think my background, my space of where I come from it fits me better.” It was clear that his connections in the game were genuine, and it pained him to go against people he cared for.






 Deontay Accused Maksim Chmerkovskiy Of Being A Traitor At His Last Round Table 

 

During the final round table Deontay appeared in, he switched things up on Maksim when the conversation was skewing toward Dan, going hard on the professional ballroom dancer. Deontay shared that he felt Maks was a Traitor, giving several examples of suspicious behavior throughout the days prior that had led him to believe it. Others in the room who were already settled on their votes being for other players listened to Deontay, with people like Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina explaining after the vote that his persuasion had caused her to change her mind and choose to banish Maks, who turned out to be a Faithful.



 Deontay Was Emotional During His Final Moments On The Traitors US 
          




After the round table, Deontay was openly emotional. He was shown crying, explaining to a group of other players that he couldn’t do this anymore. Deontay shared he found it too hard on his heart to call other people out only to be wrong. In an earlier confessional, Deontay shared he’d found it tough to pile on Peppermint before her banishment, as well. Deontay, who comes off as kind and caring in person, may not have been able to handle playing as a Faithful. It appears that Deontay’s role on The Traitors US led to such emotional strife that he likely chose to leave the series of his own accord.
