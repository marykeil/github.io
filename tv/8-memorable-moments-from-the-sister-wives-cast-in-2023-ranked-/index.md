## Literature Review
Sister Wives cast members’ lives changed dramatically in 2023. Kody, Christine, and Meri Brown shared many jaw-dropping moments in season 18.




Sister Wives cast members had various life-changing and memorable moments in 2023. The polygamous Brown family has been on TV since 2010. However, 2023 was different as it marked new milestones for almost all the main cast members, including Kody, Meri, Robyn, Christine, and Janelle Brown. Sister Wives season 18 premiered in August 2023 and featured numerous breakups. The show focused on Kody saying goodbye to Janelle and Meri while accepting that he would soon become a monogamous man with his only remaining wife, Robyn Brown. During the season, the Brown family patriarch faced many challenges as he concluded his two marriages for good.
Each Sister Wives cast member had a different take on the inter-family breakups. Kody was glad to lose Meri but also claimed that he still loved her as a person. While there was drama between him and his first wife relating to the new ring and Coyote Pass land, things eventually ended the best they could. Janelle was happy for a bright future and found a comfort zone in Christine. At the same time, Robyn was sad and cried over Janelle and Kody’s breakup. Meri was also glad that she had ended her marriage. While she did waste seven years, she didn’t dwell on it too much.

 8  Meri Moving To Utah 
Meri Decided To Live Away From Kody &amp; Robyn


 







One of Sister Wives’ most shocking moments came in the middle of season 18 when Meri said she wouldn’t stay around Kody and Robyn. The 52-year-old California native claimed she had decided to leave Arizona and live nearly 600 miles away in Utah. She said, “I’ve been thinking about it for a long time.” Meri claimed that her mom’s passing had much to do with her decision to move away. However, it was clear that she was simply trying to find her purpose after being rejected by Kody for nearly a decade since the show’s debut.

Meri Rejected Being In A Fake Marriage With Kody


 







Kody also had some of the most surprising moments on Sister Wives in 2023. At one point, the Brown family patriarch claimed he could pretend to be in a relationship with Meri for the sake of polygamy. He said, “I’m willing to fake being in love with Meri. Doing my duties as a husband.” Kody said that he was willing to overlook the things that he hated about Meri just for the sake of Robyn and to retain plural marriage. However, Meri rejected Kody’s charitable idea. She said, “I don’t want that,” making an end to all possibilities of a reconciliation.





 6  Kody Calling His Kids Bullies 
Kody Claims To Be A Victim Of His Three Wives &amp; Kids’ Bullying
        

Kody hasn’t had a decent relationship with his first three wives and some of his kids over the last few years. However, things went overboard when the polygamous patriarch publicly claimed that his family members had bullied him and Robyn. During Sister Wives: One-on-One, Kody said, “there’s a lot of bullying in the family,” blaming his family. He shared that they’d been “absolute a**h***s” to Robyn and him, which led him to alienate them in return. Kody swore he would no longer sit idle and put up with the bullying. He added, “I’m just not willing to sit here and put up with it anymore.”





 5  Christine Married David 
Christine Walks Down The Aisle In October 2023


 







2023 also featured one of the most joyous moments in Sister Wives history. While Christine didn’t showcase her complete life on the show, she achieved numerous milestones off-screen after her split from Kody. In February, the 51-year-old mom of six revealed she was in a relationship with her new man, David Woolley. A few months later, she announced she had accepted his proposal and gotten engaged. Christine and David tied the knot in October 2023, surrounded by their family and friends. As expected, Janelle was there to show her love and support, but Kody, Robyn, and Meri weren’t in attendance.





 4  Kody Admitted He Was Never In Love With Three Wives 
Kody Is Only In Love With Robyn
        

Kody made some bombshell reveals in 2023. One of his biggest announcements came in late November 2023 when he talked to show host Sukanya Krishnan and accepted that he had never fallen in love with Meri, Janelle, and Christine. He said, “I fell in love with Robyn,” admitting that none of his wives ever made him feel like that. The father of eighteen claimed he chose to be in a “covenant of love” with his first three wives but was never in love with them. According to him, Robyn gave him a feeling of “safety and a vulnerability” that he had never experienced.





 3  Kody Saying He’s Jealous Of Janelle &amp; Christine’s Relationship 
Kody Doesn’t Support Janelle &amp; Christine’s Budding Friendship
        

Jealousy has been the center point of Sister Wives since 2010. For the longest time, viewers have sensed the animosity between Janelle, Meri, Christine, and Robyn, as they were jealous to share one husband. Surprisingly, not many expected Kody to admit he was also jealous of something. During the Sister Wives: One-on-One, he shared that he wasn’t comfortable with the friendship between Christine and Janelle. He added, “I’m jealous because they’re behaving the way they should have for 25 years now.” Kody stated the two ladies weren’t as close before but were suddenly besties. He said, “yeah. It’s like I see it as a big ‘F you’ to Kody.”





 2  Kody Only Wanting A Relationship With His Kids If They Accept Robyn 
Kody Is Willing To Give Up On His Kids For Robyn
        

Kody also opened up about his feelings for his older kids, with whom he no longer speaks. He shared that he wouldn’t reconcile with his children if they didn’t accept Robyn as their matriarch. He said, “some day our family civil war might end,” adding that it will only happen when his older kids acknowledge his fourth wife. Kody said, “you’re not going to separate us,” solidifying that his only condition was for his children to accept Robyn. It will be interesting to see how the family reacts to Kody’s condition and if the older kids mend their differences with him.





 1  Christine’s TV Wedding Special With David 
Sister Wives Viewers Will Watch Christine Get Married To David


Sister Wives isn’t just a show about Kody and his polygamous family but about the four married women who have shown their vulnerable lives to viewers. Therefore, it was amazing that TLC had decided to capture Christine’s fairytale wedding with David and air it as a two-part special. The Utah woman’s wedding episode premieres on TLC in January 2024. It’s the ultimate finale and rightful end to Christine’s story arch. Viewers invested their time and emotions into Christine’s struggles over the years. Hence, it was nice of the Sister Wives production team to give Christine an excellent send-off, even though her story had just begun.
Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.
