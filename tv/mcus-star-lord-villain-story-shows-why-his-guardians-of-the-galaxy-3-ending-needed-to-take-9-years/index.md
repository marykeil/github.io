## Literature Review
What If...? season 2 explored Peter Quill&#39;s life as a villain, proving that his Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ending came at the perfect time.




Peter Quill&#39;s villain arc in Marvel Studios&#39; What If...? season 2 proved exactly why Star-Lord&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ending needed nine years of preparation. Chris Pratt debuted as Peter Quill, a.k.a. Star-Lord, in 2014&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy, and went on to appear in both of James Gunn&#39;s MCU Guardians of the Galaxy sequels, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, Thor: Love and Thunder, and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. Quill was the leader of the MCU&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy team and one of Marvel Studios&#39; most entertaining cosmic heroes, but his younger variant took a villainous turn in Phase 5&#39;s What If...? season 2.




Despite being based on one of Marvel Comics&#39; weirdest teams, James Gunn&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy franchise became one of the MCU&#39;s most popular cornerstones. Chris Pratt&#39;s charisma, personality and commitment as Peter Quill&#39;s Star-Lord had a huge role to play in this success, and while the franchise may have been focused on Rocket Raccoon, Star-Lord was central to Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;s storylines. The original 2014 film saw him find his cosmic family, 2017&#39;s Vol. 2 explored his relationship with his Celestial father, Ego, and Vol. 3 featured him dealing with Gamora&#39;s changes after Infinity War and Endgame, but What If...? season 2 displayed a very different Peter Quill.

                  Marvel Subtly Confirms Legendary Star-Lord&#39;s MCU Future Is His Nightmare   Marvel has subtly confirmed that Star-Lord&#39;s decision at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will keep him from achieving one of his goals.    


 What If...? Season 2 Explains Why Star-Lord Needed 9 Years For His Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 Ending 
         




2023&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ended with Peter Quill returning to Earth, reuniting with his grandfather, and relinquishing control of the Guardians to Rocket. While Chris Pratt has been confirmed to be returning to the MCU, this could have been the perfect ending for Peter Quill, but it was only possible because of the last nine years of storylines. What If...? season 2, episode 2, &#34;What If... Peter Quill Attacked Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes?,&#34; proved exactly why Quill&#39;s return to Earth needed to take so long, as the variant of Peter Quill seen in What If...? hadn&#39;t been through the same growth, and became a villain due to this.

Peter Quill needed to stop idolizing the lives he could have lived in order to make his return to Earth worthwhile. Quill wrongly envisioned how great being raised by his human family on Earth - had he never been abducted - or by his father, Ego, would have been. Learning how to properly embrace his roots and understand his backstory set him up to return to Earth and be a better person, but What If...?&#39;s young Peter Quill didn&#39;t have this understanding. This prompted the young Celestial to use his powers for evil by helping his father to complete the expansion, though he did eventually have a change of heart.






 Why The MCU Needs To Show Star-Lord&#39;s Story After Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 
          

Several Guardians of the Galaxy actors have confirmed they won&#39;t be reprising their roles in the MCU&#39;s future, but Chris Pratt is currently the only one who has been revealed to be returning. After Vol. 3, Quill&#39;s story needs to continue in the MCU, as his return to Earth doesn&#39;t just pose the opportunity for a happy ending, but also for an exploration of Quill embracing his roots more genuinely. Currently, it&#39;s unclear when Chris Pratt will return as Peter Quill&#39;s Star-Lord, and What If...? didn&#39;t provide any hints, but it&#39;s likely he will be seen again before the end of the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga, now as an Earth-based superhero.
