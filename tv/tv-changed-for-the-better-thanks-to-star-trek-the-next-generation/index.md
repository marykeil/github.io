## Literature Review
Star Trek: The Next Generation not only reignited the Star Trek franchise in the 1980s and 1990s, but TNG also changed the television landscape.




Star Trek: The Next Generation ushered in a new era for Star Trek, and it also changed the television landscape for the better. Beginning in 1987, TNG introduced an entirely new cast of Star Trek characters, led by Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Over the course of TNG&#39;s 7 seasons, Captain Picard and his crew on the USS Enterprise-D went on numerous adventures across the galaxy. After TNG&#39;s success, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager would follow, expanding the Star Trek universe and proving that the franchise had room to tell many different types of stories.




When Star Trek: The Original Series aired in the 1960s, television shows were primarily episodic, with very few, if any, plot threads connecting one episode to the next. Aside from soap operas, most popular television shows at the time did not have ongoing storylines or significant character development. Although TNG remained mostly episodic, it began weaving in more ongoing elements and also included the occasional two-part episode. When Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and Paramount Studios were looking for a television home for Star Trek: The Next Generation, the major networks were reluctant to commit to a full season. Roddenberry and the studio eventually decided to skip the major networks entirely and send TNG straight to syndication, which was unprecedented at the time.

                  Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast &amp; Character Guide   Star Trek: The Next Generation has one of the most beloved cast of characters in all of science fiction. Here are the major characters of the classic.    





 TNG Helped Pioneer A More Serialized, Soap Opera Approach To Television 
         

Television today is dominated by serialized shows with storylines that span many episodes and seasons. Even the episodic sitcoms of today still have ongoing threads and character growth. While the shift from episodic to more serialized storytelling happened gradually throughout the 1990s and beyond, Star Trek: The Next Generation was one of the earliest shows to experiment with serialized stories. From Data&#39;s (Brent Spiner) quest to be human to the many appearances of Q (John de Lancie) to the Borg, TNG had several elements that lasted throughout most of the series. Each time these various storylines or characters came up, they would build upon their previous appearances.

TNG may have focused primarily on standalone stories, but it had more serialized elements than Star Trek: The Original Series ever did. After TNG, future Star Trek shows began incorporating more lengthy serialized storylines, such as the Dominion War plot of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Other shows in the 1990s, like The X-Files, would follow in TNG&#39;s footsteps, with a combination of standalone and two- or three-part stories. Not only did TNG help show that stories on television could be told differently, but it also proved that science fiction shows could be successful for a wide audience.






 TNG Invented First-Run Syndication 
          

When Gene Roddenberry and Paramount Studies were initially trying to find a home for Star Trek: The Next Generation, the major networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox) weren&#39;t as keen to commit to the series as Roddenberry thought they would be. The films following Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and the rest of the TOS cast were doing well in theaters, and Trek fans had mixed feelings about a new show with an entirely new cast. None of the major networks were willing to commit to any more than half a season, but Paramount Studies couldn&#39;t justify the large budget TNG would require for so few episodes.

This led Paramount and Roddenberry to make the unprecedented decision to send TNG straight to first-run syndication. This meant that local affiliate networks would air TNG, with Paramount getting a share of the ad revenue. Plus, reruns of TOS would only be available to the networks that picked up TNG. This plan proved to be a resounding success, as TNG went on to achieve ratings that equaled or even surpassed many network shows of the time. Following TNG&#39;s success, several other television shows would take up this model, including Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Today, first-run syndication is mostly used for talk shows, reality shows, and game shows, but the success of Star Trek: The Next Generation cemented the enduring legacy of the franchise and proved that Star Trek will always have an audience.






Star Trek: The Next Generation is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
