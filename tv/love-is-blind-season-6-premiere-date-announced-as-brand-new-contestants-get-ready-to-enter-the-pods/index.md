## Literature Review
Love Is Blind season 6, set in North Carolina, will begin streaming in early 2024, with the premiere being released on a very special day.




Netflix just revealed when Love Is Blind season 6 will be premiering in 2024 and announced exciting news about the future of the series. Love Is Blind season 5 focused on couples Lydia Gonzalez and Milton Johnson, Stacy Snyder and Izzy Zapata, and Taylor Rue and JP Pierce. The latter two couples didn&#39;t end up getting married, but Lydia and Milton did tie the knot and are still together. Paige Tillman and Josh Simmons also got engaged, but for some reason the show decided not to follow their storyline.




After releasing the Love Is Blind season 5 reunion back in October, Netflix is now gearing up for Love Is Blind season 6, which will begin streaming on February 14, 2024.


 

If that date sounds familiar, that&#39;s because February 14 just so happens to be Valentine&#39;s Day, which is the perfect day for the reality dating show to launch a brand-new season. A teaser video was released along with this announcement. In the video, a woman is seen walking down a hallway and opens the door to one of the pods. Inside are Love Is Blind hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey, who are trying to get the room all ready for the contestant. Nick looks exasperated as he says, &#34;What are you doing? We&#39;re not ready for you yet.&#34; Vanessa adds, &#34;I know you&#39;re excited to find love in the pods, but we need a little more time...go away.&#34; She then proceeds to close the door.





 Love Is Blind Season 7 Renewed By Netflix 
          

In equally exciting news, Love Is Blind season 7 has already been renewed by Netflix. In recent years, the streaming service has typically released two seasons of the reality TV show every year. Since Love Is Blind season 6 premieres in February 2024, it seems likely that Love Is Blind season 7 will be released next fall, if past years are any indication.

Love Is Blind season 6 was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina. Each season&#39;s contestants are from the same city. For example, the inauguration edition was in Atlanta, Georgia. Other featured cities have included Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and Houston, Texas.




Even though Netflix is prepping fans for what&#39;s to come from the popular dating show in 2024, there&#39;s still one element of Love Is Blind season 5 that hasn&#39;t been announced yet, which is the After The Altar specials. Netflix tends to release these episodes one or two months ahead of when the next season premieres. Following that timeline, Love Is Blind: After The Altar season 5 will likely be available in January 2024, though no date has been set.

Love Is Blind season 6 premieres February 14, 2024, on Netflix.
