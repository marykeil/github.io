## Literature Review
Despite being marketed for a younger audience, Gravity Falls has some episodes depicting Dipper and Mabel finding themselves in terrifying situations.




Although Gravity Falls is a Disney Channel TV show intended for a younger audience, the series includes some truly terrifying moments. The series becomes darker in its second season as Dipper and Mabel delve further into the mysteries of Gravity Falls and find themselves in increasingly dangerous situations. However, Gravity Falls maintains its witty and sometimes morbid sense of humor, even during its darkest episodes.
Bill Cipher&#39;s appearances in Gravity Falls are always terrifying, but even Dipper and Mabel&#39;s &#34;Grunkle&#34; Stan can be a scary character. The macabre and mysterious tone blends with wacky jokes and random mythology to give Gravity Falls a unique tone. The Owl House and Amphibia, created by Gravity Falls storyboarders Dana Terrace and Matt Braly respectively, include some similar humorous and frightening moments, demonstrating Gravity Falls&#39; influence on TV.









 








 10  Dreamscapers (Season 1, Episode 19) 
Bill makes his first appearance and the Pines twins venture into their uncle&#39;s mind.


 







Gravity Falls&#39; main villain Bill makes his first appearance when Gideon summons him to invade Stan&#39;s mind. Dipper and Mabel, accompanied by Soos, use an incantation to follow Bill into Stan&#39;s head and stop him from stealing the code to the Mystery Shack&#39;s safe. The twins defeat Bill in a fun way by discovering that they can summon anything they can imagine within the mindscape. Yet Bill&#39;s first appearance is a harbinger of his more terrifying presence later in the series. Stan&#39;s mindscape is also generally spooky, taking the form of a ghostly version of the Mystery Shack.





 9  Summerween (Season 1, Episode 12) 
Gravity Falls has two Halloweens and a resident Halloween monster.
        

Stan tells the twins, &#34;The people of this town love Halloween so much they celebrate it twice a year.&#34; They also learn about the Summerween Trickster, who eats kids who do not show proper Summerween spirit. The Trickster inevitably appears, and the twins and co. must gather enough candy to appease him or be devoured. While the Trickster is spooky and spindly for Halloween, the main characters also indulge in some scary moments. Soos defeats the Halloween Trickster by eating him (he is made of candy) while Stan reminds everyone that Halloween is about coming together and celebrating &#34;pure evil.&#34; The episode is driven by superficial but frightening Halloween aesthetics.







 8  The Inconveniencing (Season 1, Episode 5) 
Wendy takes Dipper and Mabel to a haunted convenience store.
        

In the episode where Dipper realizes his crush on Wendy, Wendy invites him and Mabel along to hang out with her friends. The older kids take Dipper and Mabel to an abandoned convenience store which turns out to be haunted by the married couple that died there. The ghosts trap all the teenagers until Dipper negotiates their freedom.
The characters make a lot of jokes about how traumatized they are: Dipper tells the ghosts, &#34;I don&#39;t think you have to worry about us coming back.&#34; Wendy says after, &#34;I&#39;m probably scarred for life&#34; and &#34;I think I&#39;m gonna go stare at a wall for a while and rethink everything.&#34; This episode demonstrates the series&#39; motif of the characters ending up in comically terrifying situations but making jokes about it, creating a unique brand of macabre humor.
            
 
 8 Kids Shows That Were Genuinely Terrifying Horrors (&amp; Still Are) 
Animated and live-action kids&#39; shows have some pretty terrifying moments, and here are eight TV shows that are full of horrors, intentional or not.









 7  Not What He Seems (Season 2, Episode 11) 
Stan&#39;s dark past and the author&#39;s identity are revealed.


 







Dipper and Mabel are on a mission to prove Stan&#39;s innocence when they discover how much he has been hiding. This builds up to the intense moment of Mabel choosing not to deactivate the portal even though it might destroy the world and the reveal that Stan&#39;s brother Ford is the author of the iconic Gravity Falls journals. However, the episode&#39;s more haunting moments happen when the twins make unsettling discoveries. They find Stan&#39;s fake IDs and a newspaper clipping that reads &#34;Stan Pines Dead,&#34; before the camera pans up to a menacing shot of Stan&#39;s portrait. For a while, the episode creepily frames Stan as a twist villain.





 6  Sock Opera (Season 2, Episode 4) 
Bill returns and turns Dipper into his puppet.
        

While most of the episode &#34;Sock Opera&#34; is dominated by Mabel putting on a puppet show to impress a crush, Bill also returns for some moments reminiscent of horror movies. Dipper is trying to get into the author&#39;s laptop and Bill tricks him into making a deal for the password. Bill says that &#34;all [he wants] is a puppet&#34; – as it turns out, he takes Dipper&#39;s body as his puppet. Bill parades around as an unsettling version of Dipper with slit eyes, saying and doing creepy things. Mabel eventually forces Bill out of Dipper&#39;s body, allowing Dipper&#39;s spirit to return.







 5  Society of the Blind Eye (Season 2, Episode 7) 
Dipper and Mabel discover a secret society and Old Man McGucket&#39;s past.
        

After discovering &#34;McGucket Labs&#34; written on the author&#39;s laptop, the twins theorize that Old Man McGucket might be the author. Since McGucket does not remember much about his past, they are sent on an investigation. They discover the Society of the Blind Eye, which erases the Gravity Falls residents&#39; memories of supernatural occurrences. After narrowly escaping the Society&#39;s members, the twins and co. discover a disturbing tape of McGucket progressively losing his memory. However, the episode has a bittersweet ending where McGucket says he is glad to at least have learned who he was. The twins also now know that McGucket worked with the author.





 4  Scary-oke (Season 2, Episode 1) 
Dipper and Mabel are almost eaten by zombies.
        

Dipper is determined to prove the existence of the supernatural to the federal agents who have come to Gravity Falls and summons a zombie, inadvertently starting a small-scale zombie apocalypse. It looks like the end for the twins when they are cornered in the Mystery Shack and Dipper realizes that his search for answers has endangered them. Stan then appears to save them. Stan also morbidly admits that he has always known about the supernatural presence in Gravity Falls. The episode includes some pretty dark and hopeless moments, but the Pines discover they can combat the zombies by singing a three-part harmony to shatter their skulls.





 3  Northwest Mansion Mystery (Season 2, Episode 10) 
A violent ghost takes over Northwest Mansion.
        

Dipper is called upon to expel a ghost from the Northwest Family Mansion. What initially appears to be an average adventure of the week quickly turns into a haunting ghost story. Dipper and Pacifica are pursued by the ghost, who causes blood to leak from the mounted animal heads in one of the rooms and turns everyone at the Northwests&#39; party into wooden statues at different points. The heroes once again make a narrow escape when Pacifica appeases the ghost by allowing the townspeople into the party, but not before some terrifying moments make it into the episode.





 2  Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls (Season 2, Episode 20) 
The Pines family must defeat Bill at all costs.


 







Gravity Falls ends with a multi-episode apocalypse scenario known as &#34;Weirdmageddon,&#34; where Bill unleashes numerous horrors on Gravity Falls. Dipper and Mabel, along with their friends and family, unite to defeat Bill once and for all in Weirdmageddon Parts 3 and 4. During Weirdmageddon, Bill brings various monsters to Gravity Falls, mutilates Pacifica&#39;s father, turns the townspeople into statues to form a throne, and tortures Ford. He then threatens to torture and kill the twins before Stan tricks Bill into entering his mind and Ford erases him. Everyone in Gravity Falls is going to be dealing with a lot of trauma after surviving all that.

 1  Into the Bunker (Season 2, Episode 2) 
Dipper, Mabel, Wendy, and Soos explore a creepy bunker with a terrifying monster.
        

Dipper and Mabel discover the author&#39;s secret bunker and bring Wendy and Soos with them to explore it. After almost being crushed by a booby trap, they meet a shape-shifting monster who at one point becomes a disturbing Dipper-Mabel combination. Wendy is also forced to fight herself. She manages to communicate to Dipper that she is the real Wendy, so Dipper can attack the shapeshifter with an axe.
They are then able to freeze the shapeshifter – but not before it takes Dipper&#39;s form, so Dipper can see himself freeze to death. Characteristic of the show&#39;s humor, Soos laughs and says, &#34;Good luck sleeping tonight.&#34; This is certainly not the only time in Gravity Falls when Soos could have said this.
