## Literature Review
There&#39;s a mysterious figure who appears in in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and it&#39;s plausible he made his way onto Zooey Deschanel&#39;s New Girl too.




There&#39;s a rarely-used character in Brooklyn Nine-Nine whose appearances are often unusual, and they might have featured in New Girl as well. The nature of the character in question means their backstory is flexible. Potentially, the connection could represent one of TV&#39;s best meta castings.




Running between 2013 and 2021, Brooklyn Nine-Nine ended after season 8. New Girl shares a similar history, running for seven seasons from 2011 to 2018. Following the conclusion of Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 5, the show was canceled. However, NBC immediately picked up the show and ran it for three more seasons, meaning it was then on the same network as New Girl for a good portion of its run. During the years when both shows were in production, there was a member of the Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast who could have served as an additional link to the world of New Girl​​​​​​.

Making his first appearance in the show&#39;s pilot, Fred Armisen featured as the enigmatic Mlepnos in four episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The Saturday Night Live star also made his way into the New Girl cast as Brandon in season 5, episode 4, &#34;No Girl.&#34; Mlepnos&#39; backstory is hazy at best, with the details in a seemingly constant state of flux each time he interacts with Jake Peralta. While he claims to be from the fictional country of Leirkrakeegovnia, Mlepnos seems to be making up the traditions and customs of his supposed homeland on the spot.

As a result of the 2016 Brooklyn Nine-Nine and New Girl crossover, the possibility exists that Arimsen&#39;s New Girl character is the same as his Brooklyn Nine-Nine persona. Playing the part of Brandon, Arimsen&#39;s appearance in New Girl is initially quite unremarkable. Although Brandon is a fairly awkward guest in the apartment, he comes across as relatively down-to-earth. However, events take a sharp turn when Nick and Schmidt walk in on Brandon impersonating Jess and wearing her clothes.




Brandon never meets Jess in New Girl, bringing into question how he is able to emulate her mannerisms.

Fred Armisen&#39;s appearances in Brooklyn Nine-Nine and New Girl could be down to a simple casting quirk, but the mystery surrounding both characters would explain Mlepnos&#39; lies. For instance, Mlepnos has lied about meeting Jake during subsequent run-ins. During Jake&#39;s final exchange with Mlepnos in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8, episode 10, &#34;The Last Day Pt 2,&#34; Armisen&#39;s character adds to his intrigue by claiming his name is actually Jerry. Mlepnos also doubles down on the claim that he doesn&#39;t know who Jake is. For this reason, the vagueness of Mlepnos&#39; true identity in Brooklyn Nine-Nine allows for the possibility that he is also Brandon in New Girl.



Brooklyn Nine-Nine is available to stream on Peacock. New Girl is on Peacock and Hulu.
