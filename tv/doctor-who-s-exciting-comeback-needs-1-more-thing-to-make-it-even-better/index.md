## Literature Review
Doctor Who is back, this time bigger than ever, but the BBC is still capable of making the return of the Time Lord even more impactful.




All eyes are back on Doctor Who after the 60th-anniversary specials, but the BBC can make the show&#39;s comeback even more exciting. The return of David Tennant and the introduction of Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor ahead of Doctor Who season 14 have injected some much-needed life back into the franchise. With Russell T Davies returning for his second stretch as Doctor Who showrunner, there&#39;s another move the BBC could make that would thrill longtime fans.




Chris Chibnall&#39;s spell as showrunner proved divisive among viewers, as he introduced some controversial elements to the Doctor&#39;s backstory, such as Doctor Who&#39;s Timeless Child storyline. However, the show has seemingly regained the trust of the public as it moves forward into its new era with Gatwa at the TARDIS console in the wake of the 60th-anniversary celebrations. However, during his first stint in the role as showrunner, Russell T Davies did something else that could pay off in a big way this time around as well.

                  Doctor Who Season 14&#39;s New Writer Is From An MCU Project (&amp; They&#39;re Perfect For The New Era)   Doctor Who season 14 will add a new writer from one of the MCU projects, and they are perfect for the new era led by incoming Ncuti Gatwa.    


 The BBC Needs To Bring Back Torchwood To Complete Its Doctor Who Comeback 
The Doctor Who spinoff previously ended in 2011.
         




Torchwood was the first spinoff of the new era of Doctor Who. Created by Russell T Davies in 2006, Torchwood followed the exploits of the Cardiff branch of the titular organization. The Torchwood Institute was created in the world of Doctor Who as a result of events in season 2, episode 2, &#34;Tooth and Claw.&#34; Running for four seasons, Torchwood focused on much darker themes than Doctor Who, garnering a dedicated following before it ended in 2011.

Although Torchwood ended in a fairly satisfying way, nothing is stopping the return of Captain Jack Harkness and Gwen Cooper to once again monitor alien activity in the Welsh capital. The buzz surrounding Doctor Who is louder than it has been for a while, and the demand for more content is there. A TV show enjoying such popularity can often result in a spinoff series being given the green light. For Doctor Who, such a spinoff already exists, and it is different enough in tone to not saturate the uniqueness of the show from which it spawned.





 



There are other Doctor Who spinoffs, such as The Sarah Jane Adventures and Class, but Torchwood is the only one to not feature the Doctor at some point.






 David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor Could Appear In A New Season Of Torchwood 
Earth is now his home.
          

The ending of the Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials showed David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor essentially in the early days of his retirement. However, during Torchwood&#39;s original run, the Doctor was never so accessible. While the sound of the TARDIS can be heard in the Torchwood season 1 finale, it&#39;s never shown on-screen. Doctor Who&#39;s shocking bi-generation twist has resulted in a version of the Doctor being ever-present on Earth. Therefore, it&#39;s more than possible that Tennant could be the first Doctor to make a cameo appearance in Torchwood.




If a Torchwood revival did bring Fourteen into the fold, the show would need to be careful not to undo the events of Doctor Who. Fourteen is currently recovering with Donna Noble due to centuries of emotional trauma, so thrusting him back into action could reverse his self-care arc. This doesn&#39;t mean that he and Donna can&#39;t feature in a new season of Torchwood. The scenes would just have to be handled with care.

                  Doctor Who Properly Reveals What Happened To Torchwood After 12 Years   Doctor Who returns to Torchwood after 12 years and it doesn&#39;t look good. Could the secretive organization be resurrected for the Ncuti Gatwa era?    



Seasons 1-4 of Torchwood are available to stream on Max. The Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials are available on Disney &#43;.






 Audio Adventures Have Allowed Torchwood To Continue Since It Left TV Screens 
There is plenty of source material to mine from for the show.
          






While the TV show ended in 2011, Torchwood has the advantage of having never truly stopped. The story continued with audio adventures from Big Finish Productions.




The revival of a show can come with risks, as it can be difficult to recapture what made it so special in the first place. Torchwood has the advantage of having never truly stopped. Although the TV show ended in 2011, the Torchwood series finale was not the last installment. The story continued with audio adventures from Big Finish Productions.


 

The events of the Torchwood audio stories take place in various places along the show&#39;s timeline. One advantage of the medium is that there is no visual element involved, so the age of the actors is not an issue. As a result, the writers are given a greater degree of flexibility. A return of the Torchwood TV show could reference the events in the audio adventures, meaning the producers aren&#39;t starting with a blank slate.




While there is some question regarding whether the events of these stories are canon, some original Torchwood cast members have returned to record them. John Barrowman is among the returning actors, reprising his role as Captain Jack Harkness. The Torchwood audio plays have also featured some big names previously unaffiliated with the franchise, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#39;s James Marsters. The fact that Torchwood never really died is all the more reason for its resurrection to add to the comeback of Doctor Who.
