Summary

  K. Trevor Wilson reflects on his time as Squirrelly Dan and considers it a life-changing role in the Hulu comedy Letterkenny.   Wilson expresses his sadness about the show ending after almost 10 years and shares how the show has been a significant part of his life.   From living with roommates to owning his own home, Wilson&#39;s life has transformed during his tenure on Letterkenny. The end of the show marks a new chapter for him.  





As he says goodbye to the beloved character, K. Trevor Wilson reflects on his life-changing role as Letterkenny&#39;s Squirrelly Dan. Wilson&#39;s character belongs to the group known as the Hicks in the titular Canadian town, often hanging out with his friends and main characters Wayne, Katy and Daryl. Ahead of its premiere, it was revealed that Letterkenny season 12 would be the end for the Hulu comedy, with creator/star Jared Keeso going on to focus on the show&#39;s first spinoff Shoresy and inking a first-look deal with the streamer for future shows.




During a recent interview with Screen Rant for Letterkenny season 12, Wilson opened up about his feelings about the show coming to an end. The star reflected on his time as Squirrelly Dan in the Hulu comedy, looking to it as a life-changing role as he went through a lot of major life events during his tenure, including meeting his wife and moving from living with multiple roommates into his own home. See what Wilson shared below:


We shot the last season last September, so we were sitting on the secret for over a year, that the show was ending. I got the call last summer from Keeso that he thought it was time to close the book on this one for the time being. I wasn&#39;t ready to say goodbye, the decision was made for me, not by me, as I&#39;ve said before, and I think we had a few more stories left. I had at least two years left on my option, so I thought we were gonna go to work for a little bit longer.
I was definitely sad to see it go. It&#39;s been a strange year, it was the first year in eight years we didn&#39;t go to summer camp. I hung out with a bunch of the guys a few weeks ago at the Leafs game, and we hadn&#39;t seen each other in over a year. That&#39;s the longest we&#39;d gone without seeing each other since COVID. It&#39;s strange, learning what life is like without Letterkenny, because it&#39;s been a big part of my life for almost 10 years.
I met my wife during the run of this show, I bought my dogs during the run of this show, I lost my dad during the run of this show. A lot happened. When I auditioned for Letterkenny, I didn&#39;t have a bedroom, I slept on a couch in an apartment I shared with three other dudes, and now, I&#39;m sitting in the basement of the house I own, so my life has changed for the better, in a lot of ways. Sometimes, it&#39;s just change, but it&#39;s been a journey, and it&#39;s definitely strange, not putting on those overalls anymore.






 Why Squirrelly Dan Was Secretly The Heart Of Letterkenny 
         

With a roster of characters as big as the show&#39;s, it can be difficult to narrow down who is truly the main character in a show like Letterkenny, even if Keeso&#39;s Wayne is often the forefront of the story. It can be argued, however, that Wilson&#39;s Squirrelly Dan was secretly the heart of the Hulu comedy, frequently outshining some of his companions throughout the show&#39;s run.

When the show first launched, Dan was often used as a running gag with his unique way of talking, often ending words with an &#34;s&#34; unnecessarily, particularly his iconic catchphrase &#34;That&#39;s what I appreciates about you&#34;. He also would often engage in flatulent battles with Nathan Dales&#39; Daryl or subtly hitting on Michelle Mylett&#39;s Katy, which Wayne would calmly caution against. As the show went on, however, Dan would begin to show further layers as viewers saw him begin to learn more about the importance of feminism while attending night school and fall in love with women who brought joy to his life.




Additionally, Dan was often the glue among his friend group throughout Letterkenny. While squabbles between Wayne, Daryl and Katy never typically lasted long, Dan was frequently the one pushing the group to better communicate with one another as he sought to keep the atmosphere light and friendly among them. Though it&#39;s unclear whether Wilson will return for any of the proposed Letterkenny spinoffs following the show&#39;s final season, one can hope that Keeso finds a way to reunite with his star to bring the beloved character back to the screen at some point in the future.



All seasons of Letterkenny are now streaming on Hulu.
