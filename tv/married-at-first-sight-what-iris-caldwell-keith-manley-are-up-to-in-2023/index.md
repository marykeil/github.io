## Literature Review
Married at First Sight season 9 alums Iris Caldwell and Keith Manley said no on Decision Day. Both of them have been busy since the show aired.




Iris Caldwell and Keith Manley were matched on Married at First Sight season 9, and despite going their separate ways, there&#39;s still curiosity surrounding the MAFS alums. The couple experienced many issues, but Iris&#39;s reluctance to get intimate remained at the core of their troubles. She was a virgin, but that wasn’t the issue. What bothered Keith was her immaturity about the prospect of intimacy. Despite their initial attraction, they quickly encountered issues.




Both MAFS cast members entered the process with open hearts and pure intentions. The experts hoped that Keith would be understanding and patient with Iris. However, there were other issues at the heart of their relationship. While he was okay with Iris being a virgin, Keith felt that Iris lacked experience in other departments. On Decision Day, although Iris wanted to stay married to Keith, he preferred to divorce. Iris was open to reconciliation at the reunion, but Keith wasn&#39;t. As viewers await the outcome of the current MAFS season 17, it&#39;s time to check in with Keith and Iris.


 Iris &amp; Keith Are Focused on Their Careers Post-MAFS 

 

The exes have moved on from their MAFS journey, and both have kept busy since the show ended. Iris frequently posts gorgeous photos on Instagram and has been spending her time modeling and acting. She appeared in the Netflix film Falling for Christmas in 2022. On the other hand, Keith finished writing a book, Life is Just...: A Walk Within. He said the book was inspired by his grandmother, who loved writing. He appeared to be dating musician Ari Lennox in 2022, but whether they&#39;re still together is unknown. They likely privately parted ways because they haven&#39;t posted together in 2023.






 Iris &amp; Keith Have No Regrets After Married At First Sight 
          

While both of them have similar backgrounds (they are spiritual and religious), that wasn’t enough to keep them together. However, Iris expressed no regrets and wished Keith the best. Their marriage wasn’t all bad, as Iris helped Keith when he had to deal with the passing of his grandmother. Although they weren&#39;t a &#34;forever&#34; match, they were a season in each other&#39;s lives. Other couples on MAFS season 9 also chose divorce, with Jamie Thompson and Elizabeth Bice announcing their split in 2023.

Iris and Keith are excellent people, but some things don’t click even with the best intentions. Neither Keith nor Iris is at fault for the breakdown of their marriage, though it would be easy for them to blame each other. MAFS has changed a lot since season 1, but one constant aspect is the incredibly low MAFS success rate. However, Keith and Iris may still find their people outside Married at First Sight. Their romantic futures may be better than they could ever have imagined. For now, both appear to be single.
