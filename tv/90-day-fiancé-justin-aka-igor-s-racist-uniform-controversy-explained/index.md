## Literature Review
Fans want trans 90 Day Fiancé star Nikki Exotika&#39;s partner Justin AKA Igor canceled after a video of him wearing a racist uniform is discovered.




90 Day Fiancé fans have been asking for Justin AKA Igor to be canceled because of a video that shows him wearing an offensive uniform. Justin is from Chişinău, the capital city of Moldova. Justin was just 20 years old when he first met his partner, Nicole Sanders, AKA Nikki Exotika. Nikki is a trans woman and internet celebrity from Hoboken, New Jersey. She was in Moldova 17 years ago to meet her then-Russian boyfriend who had been deported from the U.S. Nikki found out the man was two-timing her and decided to look for love locally when she met Justin, who was 10 years younger.




Nikki and Justin were in a long-distance relationship for two years before he came to America 15 years ago on a K-1 visa. They split within two weeks when Nikki told him she used to be a man. They reconnected 15 years later and got engaged once again. However, Nikki has doubts about Justin’s affection towards her in season 10. She’s flown to Moldova to make sure Justin has really accepted her gender identity and isn’t uncomfortable showing her off to his family and friends. While the cameras are following Nikki and Justin’s second K-1 visa journey on reality TV, Justin has come under fire in real life for allegedly being racist.

 90 Day Fiancé Star Justin AKA Igor Wore Offensive Costume On Instagram 

 




Reddit user peepeehalpert_1 shared a video of Justin where he could be seen driving a car and singing along to “Sexbomb” by Tom Jones. Justin was in costume in the video and wearing dark aviators to complete his look. However, the outfit that he wore was not just a regular military uniform. “This is probably a cheap replica of an SS Officer’s parade uniform,” wrote user No-Sympathy6035. “This looks to be a (replica/costume) 1932 Model Service Jacket SS Obergruppenfuhrer Allgemeine. Worn by officers and generals,” added u/FeistyReplacement315. The video was originally posted by Justin on Instagram on June 23, 2023, before he deleted it.



 Justin&#39;s Response To Controversial Video Was Slammed 

 

90 Day Fiancé fans demanded an answer from Justin for his actions. A screenshot of Justin’s conversation with a fan following the controversy was shared by @Ghostof_lisasbabytoe. In it, the fan asked Justin why he deleted the racist video from his Instagram feed. The fan also tagged the network and the show’s IG accounts in the comment. “Who are you? And why are you so interested?” asked Justin. He asked the fan if they ever have “fun” at all. “I wonder how you spend your Halloween there? What do you dress up as?” he continued. Justin claimed he doesn’t understand American “culture” yet but wants to “understand better.”




“All he had to say was he wasn’t dressed up as one and leave it at that.,” a fan wrote in the comments. Justin’s response showed that he knew exactly what his costume was. Some fans commented about how they’ve been dressing up for Halloween for over 30 years but have never managed to dress in a racist costume. “He needs to be removed from the show,” demanded another viewer.



 90 Day Fiancé Fans Accuse Justin Of More Problematic Behavior 

 

Meanwhile, Reddit user u/cupcakerrr found another photo of Justin together with Nikki on her Instagram page which they believe is problematic. “Even more sus combined with that other post with him wearing a n**i uniform?” the fan asked in their caption. The picture showed Justin wearing a camouflage outfit with his right arm raised in a salute. “Vile . They should b removed,” commented Gypcbtrfly. However, a few comments did defend Justin this time by claiming what the 90 Day Fiancé star was doing was not the Sieg Heil salute.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
