## Literature Review
The Rookie season 6 is coming, and a little later than usual. With that in mind, here is the cast, story, and release date of the show.




The Rookie season is arriving later than expected, but it&#39;s nevertheless shaping up to be a return to form for Nathan Fillion&#39;s John Nolan. The Rookie premiered in 2018 and tells the story of John Nolan — a man in his 40s who decides to become the oldest rookie in the LAPD. While most of his fellow officers didn&#39;t take him seriously, John Nolan proved that he was genuine about the opportunity and, over five seasons proved he was a great police officer.




The Rookie season 6 story will follow up the huge twist at the end of The Rookie season 5 where a series of attacks on the LAPD saw a man arrested, but someone that John Nolan didn&#39;t believe was guilty. With that case still open in John&#39;s mind, there is also a new villain arriving in The Rookie season 6 and things might get worse before they get better for the officers. While much of the series will continue to focus on different cases throughout the season, there is also the overarching case, where the beloved cast of the series will keep it as one of the most popular shows on ABC.

 The Rookie Season 6 Story 
What Will The Rookie Season 6 Be About?
          

The Rookie season 6 story will follow up on The Rookie season 5&#39;s shocking finale. There was a plot throughout the entire season that featured coordinated attacks against police officers. This ended with Luke Moran being arrested for the attacks, but John Nolan knew that he wasn&#39;t responsible. He was right, as Kristian Bruun&#39;s new villain confirms. It was Brunn&#39;s character who masterminded the attacks, and it will be up to John and the rest of the LAPD to figure this out and bring him down.

The Rookie season 6 story will also have to figure out who lived and who died in that finale. Masked criminals attacked Aaron Thorsen and Celina Juarez, shooting Aaron in the back. At the end of the season, he started coding, so it will be revealed in the premiere whether he died. There have been lots of deaths in The Rookie, so anyone is game — including Aaron. There is also a good chance Elijah Stone might return even after his arrest in season 5, and that the romantic storyline between John and Bailey and Tim and Lucy continues. The Rookie season 6 is sure to include more great moments when it finally returns.
