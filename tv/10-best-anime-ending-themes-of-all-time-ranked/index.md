## Literature Review

Anime ending themes are frequently overshadowed by upbeat and heavy opening themes, but they&#39;re always the perfect bookend for a series or season.




The best anime ending themes are often overshadowed by a series&#39; opening theme, but good EDs are arguably easier to find than good OPs. Openings have to prepare audiences and get them excited about the upcoming episode, whereas endings have much more flexibility. An ending song can be a cute exclamation to bookend an episode, or it can segue into a high-tension preview of what&#39;s to come.
Consequently, ending themes are easy to miss compared to the opening animations, but once discovered by reappearances of the song;, either from anime reviews, news, or anime song covers such as the virtuosic anime piano arrangements by Animenz on YouTube, a wave of nostalgia will sweep past, evoking the same feelings with which a series was ended. The best of these ending themes will not only bring back memories, but will leave room for artistic expansion.

 10  &#34;Hyori Ittai&#34; Gets Fans Anxious For the Next Episode 
Hunter x Hunter Ending 5 by Yuzu
        

The fifth ending song of the hit remake of Hunter x Hunter, &#34;Hyori Ittai&#34;, is an exciting song about reminiscence and preparation for battle – something that the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter x Hunter is all about. This particular ending plays at the end of episodes throughout the aforementioned arc, which is arguably one of the best in Hunter x Hunter, a series already well-known for immaculate story structuring. As a result, any time &#34;Hyori Ittai&#34; plays, even if it is just the first few bars, scenes of Gon and Killua fighting high-stakes battles will flash through the mind&#39;s of fans.

 9  &#34;Orion&#34; Is a Shining Star 
March Comes in Like a Lion Ending 2 by Yonezu Kenshi


&#34;Orion&#34; from March Comes in Like a Lion sounds exactly like what it was made out to be, a shining start that marks the end of an emotional journey. In &#34;Orion&#34;, Yonezu Kenshi&#39;s songwriting prowess shines much like it does in his other works, which include openings in My Hero Academia and Chainsaw Man, and his most recent single &#34;Spinning Globe&#34; in the Studio Ghibli Film, The Boy and the Heron. Although Yonezu does not normally write ending themes, &#34;Orion&#34; perfectly compliments the trials and tribulations that main character Kiriyama Rei encounters.

 8  &#34;Michishirube&#34; Is a Guiding Light in the Darkness 
Violet Evergarden Ending by Chihara Minori
        

Violet Evergarden is a short, but touching drama that not only pulls at the heartstrings, but makes one excited to follow a young woman&#39;s personal growth. The song &#34;Michishirube&#34; that sends off every episode is a metaphor for the journey of the main character, Violet, and the difficulties she has in finding her way. Violet has deep-seated trauma from her experiences in war as a preadolescent girl, but in a time of peace, she has taken up the job of an auto memory doll, which is essentially a ghostwriter. Violet&#39;s job and emotional discovery are perfectly accented by &#34;Michishirube&#34;.

 7  &#34;Dango Dai Kazoku&#34; Delivers Dollops of Joy 
Clannad Ending by Chata
        

The anime Clannad is a romance drama series that emotionally hits when least expected, making the song &#34;Dango Dai Kazoku&#34; a soothing way to end every episode. The title of the song essentially translates to &#34;Big Family of Dango&#34;, a traditional, squishy, and round Japanese sweet. The visuals involve a big group of creatures based on the treat that have gained sentience as they sing the iconic theme. Overall, the song is quite mellow, but paired with the anime, it becomes a representation of sadness and nostalgia.
The original &#34;Dango Dai Kazoku&#34; is only available on Apple Music

 5  &#34;Sugar Song and Bitter Step&#34; Sends Fans Off With a Dance 
Blood Blockade Battlefront Ending 1 by Union Square Garden


The anime Blood Blockade Battlefront is an amalgamation of fantastical and bizarre adventures, from vampires to fishmen, and the ending song &#34;Sugar Song and Bitter Step&#34; provides the final exclamation mark to its eccentricity. Although the song itself is nothing out of the ordinary despite being a musical masterpiece, its upbeat nature is an unusual pairing with a show that boasts the name Blood Blockade Battlefront. Regardless, the song by Union Square Garden has become an anime song homestead for both viewers and non-viewers of the anime, as its musical prowess has transcended the boundaries of a single fandom.

 4  &#34;Wind&#34; Carries an Air of Loneliness 
Naruto Ending 1 by Akeboshi
        

Any fan of the first half of Naruto will remember the adversity and discrimination that the titular character suffered early in the series and onward. Similarly, fans will likely remember the ending credits in which a lonely childhood version of Naruto sits on a swing in an empty playground as &#34;Wind&#34; by Akeboshi plays in the background. Akeboshi&#39;s voice is sweet, but filled with the same sense of suffering and loneliness that Naruto endures, and the lyrics sound as if they are begging for a better future to grace the life of the Nine-Tailed Fox&#39;s Jinchurichi.

 3  &#34;Trust Me&#34; Is a Beacon of Verity Amid Never Ending Chaos 
Durarara!! Ending 1 by Matsushita Yuya
        

In the chaos that overwhelms the action mystery anime Durarara!!, the ending theme, titled &#34;Trust Me&#34; is a grounding point of clarity that returns at the end of every episode. As a series, Durarara!! can be complex and confusing at times, making it perfect for a rewatch, with characters ranging from a motorcycle-riding dullahan in search of her missing head, to a russian sushi chef who mingles with the Ikebukuro underground. However, the song &#34;Trust Me&#34;, as its title describes, is a statement that says that within the chaos and confusion that litters the narrative, there is an explanation that will inevitably bring the cast and audience a level of clarity.

 2  &#34;Samurai Heart&#34; Is a Headbanger of an Ending 
Gintama Ending 17 by Spyair
        

The hit shonen gag comedy anime Gintama is a laid back episodic series that takes advantage of its incredible science fiction premise, having aliens arrive on Earth during Japan&#39;s Edo period, leading to the modernization of samurai and the colonization of humans. However, one modicum of hope, Sakata Gintoki, brings laughter through all sorts of hilarious situations. Despite the lighthearted nature of the series, its seventeenth ending theme, titled &#34;Samurai Heart&#34;, also known as &#34;Some Like It Hot!!&#34;, is a masterful, high-tempo piece of rock that does nothing but hype up the ensuing episodes, which is a bit of a joke in and of itself.

 1  &#34;Uso&#34; Makes It Hard To Believe That the Episode Is Over 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Ending 1 by SID
        

Widely lauded as one of the greatest anime of all time, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shonen series that incorporates deep philosophy along with memorable battles and complex storytelling. Consequently, everything in the anime is exquisitely bracketed by an amazing soundtrack. In particular, &#34;Uso&#34; by SID is the undoubtedly the best ending theme in the series, and perhaps, of all time. The band&#39;s vocals paired with the riveting ending animation that takes a step away from the mainstream and evokes a child-like nostalgia makes for the perfect song to end the first few episodes of a series that seeks so much meaning in truth.
