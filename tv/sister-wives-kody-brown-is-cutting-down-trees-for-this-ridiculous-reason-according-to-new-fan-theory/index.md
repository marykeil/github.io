## Literature Review
Sister Wives&#39; Kody Brown was aggressively cutting down trees during Christine Brown and David Woolley&#39;s wedding special due to a very cunning reason.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown was chopping down trees during the Sister Wives: Christine and David&#39;s Wedding special for a reason according to some very observant viewers. Fans got to view Christine Brown and David Woolley’s October 2023 wedding on the screen because of the two-part special. Christine’s ex-husband Kody Brown was not a part of the guestlist. After 16 years of being together, Christine had announced her difficult decision to leave. Christine was the first to leave Kody back in 2021, followed by Janelle Brown and Meri Brown.




A segment of the Sister Wives: Christine and David&#39;s Wedding special had Christine revealing how David told her he was aware of her family life being public for 13 years, while Kody was shown cutting down trees in Flagstaff, Arizona. A confused Reddit user u/Certain_Cantaloupe56 asked, “What the F was that all about?!?! Was he taking his wedding anger on a tree?!?! Was he annoyed that he was not the center of attention that day?” Kody was cutting down the tree with an electric chainsaw wearing a visor and gloves as he screamed, “Go, go, go, da*n!” and Robyn cheered him on from a distance.

 Sister Wives Fans Blast Kody For Incorrectly Cutting Down Trees 
          




“He is still trying to pretend he&#39;s a manly, outdoorsy rancher guy,” noted Reddit user Wigglypannacotta. They recalled another episode in Sister Wives season 18, where Kody was spotted cutting down random bushes. Utootired mentioned how Kody swearing at the tree was him trying to add to his manliness. Meanwhile, Active-Literature-67, added, “My take is he was trying to show everyone he is the bigger man so to speak.” Viewers agreed that the shot of Kody cutting down the tree was him intentionally trying to show what a “real man” is like. However, __Bing__bong__ declared that Kody being shown “in contrast” to a seemingly normal family event was a “chef’s kiss.”


 

At the same time, some TLC viewers pointed out how Kody was cutting down the trees in the most unsafe way possible. While he may have been using it as a means to exhibit his manliness or use it as an anger-management tool, Kody was also doing it wrong. Kody didn’t have a hard hat on. The way he was swinging the saw also came across as scary to viewers. “I would stay far away from him,” wrote Nozora, a fan who used to fell a lot of trees while working for the forest service.




Besides, Kody not having any control over the tree as it fell was possibly used as a metaphor by the show for Kody’s life that’s spiraling out of his control on Sister Wives. Kody himself is the reason behind his failed marriages. He did love Meri, Christine, and Janelle at the start, even if he claims he didn’t, but he made Robyn his priority. Kody’s ego is fragile, and he will never admit that he created the mess. The Sister Wives star’s been left picking up the pieces as Christine and the rest move on while he keeps finding ways to prove he is still a manly leader of his clan.
