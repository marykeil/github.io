## Literature Review
My Unorthodox Life season 2 is streaming on Netflix, and there&#39;s curiosity surrounding Julia Haart&#39;s life after the show.




My Unorthodox Life season 2 has come and gone, but there&#39;s curiosity surrouding Julia Haart&#39;s life post filming. Most of the show&#39;s second season focused on the upheavals that Julia faced in her marriage with Silvio Scaglia, whom she wed in 2019, as they navigated a messy split. During the season, Julia referenced Silvio&#39;s alleged turbulent relationships with her kids, Batsheva Haart, Shlomo Haart, Miriam Haart, and Aron Hendler.




Besides Julia and Silvio&#39;s split, My Unorthodox Life season 2 also focused on her losing her job at Silvio&#39;s modeling and talent agency, Elite World Group. Silvio fired Julia from her job as CEO, alleging that she misappropriated company funds and abused her position. However, Julia, who was shocked by Silvio&#39;s actions, denied the allegations and maintained her innocence. Although the show&#39;s second season shed more light on Julia and Silvio&#39;s divorce, it was filmed between January 31, 2022, and April 12, 2022.


 Julia&#39;s Lawsuits Against Silvio 
          

After Silvio fired her, Julia filed a lawsuit claiming that he named her Elite World Group&#39;s co-owner, following their marriage in 2009. Therefore, Julia claimed that she owned 50% of the company. However, in May 2022, a judge ruled that Julia didn&#39;t own that portion of the firm. Julia filed another lawsuit in July 2022, suing her estranged husband for $257 million. She also accused him of bullying and abusing her. Yet again, a judge dismissed the case, but gave Julia exclusive use of her and Silvio&#39;s shared penthouse, which features in My Unorthodox Life.






 Julia Published A Book After Season 2 Filming Wrapped 
          

Although Julia was entangled in legal drama, she kept busy, as she was preparing her book for publication. Eventually, in April 2022, she published, &#34;Brazen: My Unorthodox Journey From Long Sleeves To Lingerie.&#34; The book details the first half of Julia&#39;s life, focusing on her childhood, her married life in Monsey, and how she left the community. It also delved into her designing her shoe line and becoming a creative director at the luxury intimates brand, La Perla.



 Julia &amp; Silvio&#39;s Divorce Still Not Finalized 
          

With Julia and Silvio involved in an intense battle over the ownership of Elite World Group, amid the court rulings, they have yet to finalize their divorce. In a December 2022 chat with The Times of Israel, Julia revealed that she appealed in Delaware, and filed defamation and fraud lawsuits against Silvio. She added, &#34;I feel very confident about my fraud lawsuit. But in the meanwhile, since we&#39;re fighting about control of EWG and I don&#39;t have access to it, I realized I don&#39;t want to sit still.&#34; 






 Julia &amp; Batsheva Are Going To Therapy 

 

Amid her marital issues and lawsuits, Julia ensures that her relationships with her kids are okay. Evidence from Julia&#39;s Instagram page shows that she and Batsheva have continued going for therapy. The mother-daughter duo also attended MoÃ«t &amp; Chandon&#39;s &#39;Your Voices&#39; Holiday Celebration. In addition, a recent post by Julia showed her and Batsheva making Tzatziki. Julia also spent time with her kids during Thanksgiving, and shared a cute snap of them on her Instagram page.

In addition to spending time with her kids, Julia is also seeking new ventures, as she now hosts a monthly event tagged, &#34;Paint 2 Power,&#34; and describes it as a feminist roundtable. She also started her own shapewear line called &#34;Body by Julia Haart&#34; in summer 2023. The My Unorthodox Life star has been through so many travails in the past year, and handled the difficulties bravely. She is staying focused on achieving her goals. Hopefully, the immediate future will be kind to Julia.
