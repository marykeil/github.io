## Literature Review
The Bear recently won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy TV Series. While it&#39;s undoubtedly a dramedy, these moments prove its comedic merits.




FX&#39;s The Bear isn&#39;t purely a comedy show, but moments of tension and drama are complemented by levity and well-timed humor. For season 2, The Bear won the Golden Globe for Musical or Comedy TV Series, and it&#39;s fair to say it fits neatly between the comedy and drama genres, both of which are relatively loose parameters. While traditional sitcoms like Seinfeld construct their episodes around jokes, the humor of The Bear is more akin to real-world conversations between friends, where a blend of contrasting personalities can make anything hilarious.
The Bear is exceptional at creating distinct characters and, thus, different senses of humor. Carmy isn&#39;t a notably funny character, but his dry, deadpan expressions and quick wit make for hilarious moments. Richie&#39;s loudmouth antics clash with Sydney&#39;s intelligence and wit, making for great contrasting banter. Fak is primarily a comedic relief character whose wholesome energy provides consistent and joyous humor. Like the dramatic success of The Bear, the show&#39;s comedy relies on its fantastic ensemble.

 15  Fak Brothers Baseball Card Investment 
Season 2, Episode 6
        

&#34;Fishes&#34; is the best episode of The Bear so far, mainly due to its intensity. The episode is filled with cameos, including actors Jamie Lee Curtis, Bob Odenkirk, and comedian John Mulaney. In the episode, the Fak brothers make a sales pitch to Mulaney&#39;s Stevie, trying to get him to invest $500 in their plan to flip the value of baseball cards.

An underlining plot in The Bear season 2 is Carmy&#39;s relationship with Claire and the possibility of him finding happiness while opening a stellar restaurant. Throughout the season, he&#39;s meant to call the fridge guy and get the door handle fixed, ultimately backfiring in The Bear&#39;s season 2 ending. One of the first times it&#39;s mentioned, Marcus enters the room and tosses the phone to Carmy, who, not expecting it, ducks and watches as the phone shatters behind them. Carmy dryly replies, &#34;I&#39;ll call him back,&#34; showing how humor interweaves with fast-paced dialogue.

Season 2, Episode 2
        

Shortly after Richie downplays the mold problem, he insists again that the situation is under control. In a perfect moment of karmic justice, Richie gives a speech about the status of the ceilings, saying, &#34;Were we to have mold, it would collapse when I go like this,&#34; before tapping the ceiling, which comes crashing down on him. Richie is immediately covered in mold and dust. If that wasn&#39;t enough, a ball shortly follows, bouncing off Richie&#39;s head.

Season 1, Episode 4
        

The season 1 episode &#34;Dogs&#34; is filled with funny moments and one of the series&#39; darker, more deadpan comedic exchanges. Carmy and Richie are catering for a child&#39;s birthday party, and Carmy is slicing oranges at their table when an old man comes over and says, &#34;Carmen, is that you?

 7  &#34;I Wear Suits Now&#34; 
Season 2, Episode 8


 







Richie goes through a significant arc in The Bear, season 2. The episode &#34;Forks&#34; is pivotal to him, realizing his potential and value to the restaurant as a people person after training at another restaurant. In &#34;Bolognese,&#34; the effects of that stint are visible, as Richie wears a suit throughout the episode. In a subtle yet funny moment with Sydney, she acknowledges his attire, and Richie replies, &#34;I wear suits now.&#34; As Richie became a fan-favorite and one of the most likable characters in The Bear, the quote became a meme.

Season 2, Episode 5
        

In The Bear, Sugar gets more involved in season 2, adding charm and humor to the restaurant dynamic. It&#39;s clear that Uncle Jimmy has a soft spot for his niece, who utilizes this to get him to help out. Nat butters up Uncle Jimmy, which works like a charm, and the funniest part of the scene is Carmy and Richie spectating.

Season 2, Episode 1
