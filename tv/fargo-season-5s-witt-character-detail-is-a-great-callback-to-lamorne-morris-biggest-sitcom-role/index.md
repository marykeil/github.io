## Literature Review

The finale of Fargo season 5 shows that Deputy Witt Farr now has a character trait and a connection to Lamorne Morris&#39; biggest sitcom role. 




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for Fargo season 5 finale!The Fargo season 5 finale gave audiences a major character detail about Lamorne Morris&#39; Deputy Witt Farr, and it is a great callback to his most famous sitcom role. In the show, Morris plays Deputy Farr, a police officer whom Dorothy Lyon saves during a shootout with some of Roy Tillman&#39;s men. One of the highlights of the Fargo season 5 cast, Farr develops a sense of responsibility and protection for Dorothy and makes it his mission to keep her safe while ex-husband Roy Tillman hunts her.




Lamorne Morris, who also starred in films such as Game Night, Jumanji: The Next Level, and How it Ends, has spent the majority of his career on television, starring in shows such as Woke and Call Me Kat. Before Fargo, however, his breakout role came when he starred in the sitcom New Girl on FOX from 2011-2018. In that series, Lamorne Morris&#39; character shares a specific and humorous connection to Deputy Witt Farr, his latest character from the Fargo universe.



All episodes of Fargo season 5 can be found on the Hulu streaming service.





 Witt Being A Cat Dad In Fargo Is A Great Callback To Lamorne Morris&#39; Cat In New Girl 
          

One year after the events at the Roy Tillman ranch that took Deputy Farr&#39;s life, Dorothy, Scotty, and Olmstead visit his grave. Dorothy asks if he has any family, and Indira Olmstead, the former police officer who went to work for Lorraine Lyon, mentions Farr had a bunch of sisters and that he had a cat, which she is now taking care of. The fact that Witt Farr was a cat person connects him to his most famous role as Winston Bishop in New Girl.




In New Girl, Morris&#39; character (who is also a police officer) memorably had a cat named Furguson Michael Jordan Bishop. Originally, the cat belonged to Winston&#39;s girlfriend Daisy, and she asked Winston to cat-sit while she was out of town. They break up because Winston is convinced she is cheating on him, and Winston, for a time, tries to figure out a way to kill the cat. Over time, however, he falls in love and officially becomes a cat dad, just like Witt Farr in Fargo.

When Dorothy, Scotty, and Office Indira Olmstead visit Deupty Farr&#39;s graveside, they have a nice conversation remembering their friend and note that his past likely influenced the type of protective person he had become, and why Witt Farr would do anything to help Dorothy and her family. Indira mentions Witt had several sisters, so he grew up looking out for the women in his life. When Dorothy was in trouble, Witt was the first to volunteer to lead a rescue team to save her from the Roy Tillman ranch.




Deputy Farr treated Dorothy the same way he treated his sisters and made sure she was rescued from Roy. His dedication and devotion to protecting Dorothy meant he would be willing to sacrifice everything, even if it meant losing his own life for the person who risked hers when he was hurt in episode 1. In the season 5 finale of Fargo, Witt Farr&#39;s belief in the good in people ultimately led to his death at the hands of Roy, but Deputy Farr&#39;s lasting legacy was that he would do anything to remove the threat from Dorothy&#39;s life forever.
