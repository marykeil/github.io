## Literature Review
Natalie Mordovtseva hasn’t changed since 90 Day Fiancé season 7. She is still selfish and wants Josh Weinstein to meet her high expectations.




Natalie Mordovtseva has returned to 90 Day: The Single Life with Josh Weinstein, but there are some reasons why she won&#39;t enjoy a happily ever after with him. Natalie was first featured in 90 Day Fiancé season 7 with Mike Youngquist, and she married him in season 8. However, Natalie left Mike six months after the wedding because he didn&#39;t spend enough time with her. She flew to Florida, lost weight, and started working on her goal of becoming an actress. Eventually, Natalie met Josh, the CEO and founder of a company called Preview Models.




Natalie started dating Josh in 90 Day: The Single Life season 2 and seemed head over heels in love with him. Although the new couple have chemistry, they don&#39;t seem compatible. In the first episode of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, Natalie reunited with her mom in the United States. Soon, the mother-daughter duo moved to Los Angeles so that Natalie could be closer to Josh and get more modeling offers. However, it doesn&#39;t seem like Natalie&#39;s move helped her relationship, as Josh still can&#39;t make enough time for her.

 Natalie Mordovtseva Keeps Complaining 
         




In the latest episode of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, Natalie gets into a fight with Josh because he can&#39;t help her enough after her move to California. According to Natalie, Josh had promised her to help find a job and a place to live for her and her mom. However, the modeling agency owner told Natalie during their dinner date that he needed to leave for Ohio for two weeks due to work. Natalie felt betrayed by Josh and had a breakdown in a parking garage.

Although Josh is wrong about not fulfilling his promise to Natalie, she must stop complaining about her problems. The 90 Day Fiancé alum decided to move to Los Angeles with her mom without a stable job and living situation. She doesn&#39;t have the right to call out Josh for not being available for her. Natalie has been living in the United States for more than two years now, and she should have funds and a credit history and be able to find a job and a house on her own. If Natalie keeps such high expectations of her lover, she may never find a suitable match.






 Josh Would Want Someone More Level-Headed Than Natalie Mordovtseva 
         

Josh has mentioned that he likes Natalie but doesn&#39;t seem enthusiastic about being in a committed relationship with her. The 42-year-old reality star feels that his relationship with the Ukrainian native could go wrong at any time. Since Josh is the head of a modeling agency, he has a lot of responsibilities and duties. He would want to be with someone who understands his job and doesn&#39;t feel disappointed when he is busy building his business. Natalie appears too needy and emotional to be with a workaholic business owner and father.

Although Natalie has been working with the 90 Day Fiancé franchise for a few years, she doesn&#39;t seem to have any savings. She doesn&#39;t feel responsible for her own well-being and expects her partner to help her financially. During 90 Day Fiancé season 8 Tell All, Natalie revealed she was still using Mike&#39;s credit card despite moving out of his house to pursue her modeling career in Florida. Natalie didn&#39;t look embarrassed while admitting that Mike was helping her financially. Natalie is now expecting similar treatment from Josh. She has moved to Los Angeles, hoping he&#39;ll provide her with monetary assistance.

                  Most Cringeworthy 90 Day Fiancé’s Proposals in 2023   While some 90 Day Fiancé stars proposed to their partners in the most romantic way in 2023, others disappointed viewers with their awkward speeches.    

In the latest episode of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, Natalie and Josh looked happy checking out a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. However, Natalie revealed that she has no credit history to rent the apartment and expects Josh to be her guarantor. The couple got into a heated argument when Josh didn&#39;t seem confident to be her guarantor. Natalie said it was &#34;bulls**t&#34; that Josh didn&#39;t support her. Until Natalie feels financially independent, she won&#39;t be able to attract true love.






 Josh Isn&#39;t Ready To Settle With Natalie Mordovtseva 
          

While apartment hunting, Josh told Natalie that he didn&#39;t want to be her guarantor because he doesn&#39;t feel secure in their relationship. He said, &#34;I just don&#39;t think right now, where we&#39;re at, that we&#39;re ready to have joint anything. I need to feel secure in our relationship first.&#34; While Josh is honest, his statement suggests he doesn&#39;t trust Natalie. The couple has been in an on-again, off-again relationship for about two years, and they&#39;re still not confident about their connection. Josh doesn&#39;t want to help Natalie because he doesn&#39;t know what the future holds. He is prepared to leave her if it inconveniences him. 



 Natalie Mordovtseva Lacks Emotional Self-Regulation 
          




There&#39;s no doubt that Natalie is a difficult person to be with. She&#39;s in her late 30s and has been married three times but still hasn&#39;t found a long-term partner to spend her life with. Natalie can&#39;t control and regulate her emotions if something doesn&#39;t go her way. She has been accused of verbally abusing Mike, and now she is using the same tactic with Josh. Natalie expects people to cater to her needs, and she lashes out at them when they don&#39;t come through.

Although Natalie has been through several hardships in the United States, it&#39;s difficult to feel sympathy for her because she acts selfishly. Due to her actions toward Mike and Josh, she has become one of the most toxic cast members of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. Natalie could have abandonment issues, but it&#39;s high time she acknowledged them and worked on herself to become less reactive and more responsive. Viewers should buckle up for what&#39;s to come in Natalie&#39;s relationship with Josh in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.
