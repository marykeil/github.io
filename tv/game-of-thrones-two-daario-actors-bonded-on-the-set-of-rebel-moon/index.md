## Literature Review
Ed Skrein and Michiel Huisman bonded over their shared Game of Thrones role of Daario on the set of Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon during production.




Ed Skrein reveals how he and co-star Michiel Huisman bonded over their shared role of Daario Naharis from Game of Thrones when working together on key scenes of Zack Snyder&#39;s Netflix sci-fi epic Rebel Moon. Skrein portrays Atticus Noble, a dedicated soldier of the Imperium willing to do whatever it takes to advance his goals, spreading fear and tyranny throughout the faction&#39;s territories. Huisman portrays Gunnar, a farmer from the world of Veldt who takes a stand against Noble&#39;s Imperium forces when they demand fealty.




With Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child Of Fire released on Netflix, Skrein opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about working on Snyder&#39;s two-part space opera, including his unique connection with another cast member. The actor revealed that he spent time and got on well with Huisman, whom replaced him in HBO&#39;s Game of Thrones when Skrein withdrew from the show, and that there was a solid understanding of the situation and no hard feelings were held between the two. Check out Skrein&#39;s explanation below:


That village scene is mainly a conflict between your character, Corey Stoll’s character and Michiel Huisman’s character, and you and Michiel have a fascinating subplot that has nothing to do with Rebel Moon, as you both played Daario on Game of Thrones. So did you say, “Hi Daario,” to one another during your first encounter on set? Or was there a Western standoff at first?
(Laughs.) No, it was the complete opposite. It was, “Hi Michiel. Hi Ed. Nice to meet you. Can’t wait to work with you. Where do you live? Have you got children?” And we got on really well from the beginning, actually. It was really nice. So there were no awkward standoffs with him or anyone in the cast. Michiel is a good dude. He’s a really good dude, and I loved spending time with him on set. I also loved training with him in the gym and going on this press tour with him, so it’s been really nice. If I think of him as any character, it’s Gunnar from Rebel Moon.
It’s my job to make a fuss about two actors sharing the same role, but as you pointed out earlier, this is all part of an actor’s life. Sometimes, you replace an actor, and sometimes they replace you. So I can understand why it’s just another day at the office for you.
Yeah, I feel a kind of camaraderie and kinship with other actors, regardless of what roles they’ve taken or not taken. We understand the dynamics of our job and therefore can relate. And especially if we’re in the same cast, then it should be everyone’s preoccupation to just keep everything as positive and nice as possible. So that’s the way it goes. People will replace me in the future and I will replace other people in the future, and I’ll be a gentleman about it at all times. And I think Michiel will be, too.






 Why Did Ed Skrein Leave Game of Thrones? 
          

Over a decade before Rebel Moon released, Skrein made his Game of Thrones debut in season 3, episode 8, &#34;Second Sons&#34;, as part of the episode&#39;s titular faction. An ally and eventual lover of Emilia Clarke&#39;s Daenerys Targaryen, Daario betrays his fellow captains and assumes control of the Second Sons after refusing to kill the rising ruler. Daario would remain loyal to Daenerys throughout her campaigns across Meereen, but the pair would part once the Targaryen heir set her sights on Westeros, remaining in Meereen to keep the peace as the government is reformed following the second siege in season 6.

                  Netflix&#39;s New Action Movie Makes Game Of Thrones’ Most Jarring Recast More Bizarre, 9 Years Later   Netflix&#39;s new sci-fi action movie features two former Game of Thrones actors in its cast, which is a reminder of a famous recasting on the HBO show.    




However, Skrein would depart the role in season 4 of Game of Thrones just after the character pledges his allegiance to Daenerys, with Huisman taking on the role until season 6&#39;s conclusion. While Skrein was eager to remain in the role throughout the character&#39;s full story arc, Skrein has stated he left Game of Thrones due to motives he described as &#34;Political&#34;, offering no further hints as to the exact terms that led to him parting ways with the HBO series. Skrein&#39;s departure may not have been his decision, but the actor would continue to play roles in blockbuster features including Deadpool, Alita: Battle Angel, and now Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon duology.

While Skrein and Huisman may be on opposing sides as Noble and Gunnar, it is clear there&#39;s no bad blood among the two Rebel Moon cast members. Though Skrein&#39;s past comments show he regrets being unable to fulfill his Game of Thrones role, the actor understands the complexities the career can bring, and has clearly found a friendship with his co-star. Noble and Gunnar may be finding themselves on opposing sides once more following Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire&#39;s ending, but the camaraderie between Skrein and Huisman remains strong.
