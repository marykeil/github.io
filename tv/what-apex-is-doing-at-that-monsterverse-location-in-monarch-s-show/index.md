# What APEX Is Doing At THAT Monsterverse Location In Monarch s Show


## SUMMARY 



  APEX has a presence on Skull Island, which makes sense considering it is the home of Kong and the only place in the Monsterverse where a Titan roams freely.   The motivation behind APEX&#39;s presence on Skull Island is to conduct studies on Titans, specifically Kong, and gather valuable information on Titan biology.   APEX&#39;s outpost on Skull Island is likely a result of a deal with Monarch, and their possession of Skullcrawler eggs in Godzilla vs. Kong hints at their connection to Skull Island.

## Literature Review
Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1&#39;s ending revealed APEX is based at a surprising Monsterverse location. What are they doing there?





Summary

  APEX has a presence on Skull Island, which makes sense considering it is the home of Kong and the only place in the Monsterverse where a Titan roams freely.   The motivation behind APEX&#39;s presence on Skull Island is to conduct studies on Titans, specifically Kong, and gather valuable information on Titan biology.   APEX&#39;s outpost on Skull Island is likely a result of a deal with Monarch, and their possession of Skullcrawler eggs in Godzilla vs. Kong hints at their connection to Skull Island.  







While the big reveal that APEX has a presence on Skull Island was a game-changing development for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, their activities there make sense when regarding where they fit into the Monsterverse. The home of the Monsterverse&#39;s Kong, Skull Island has made two appearances in Apple TV&#43;&#39;s show. The first, which was in the series premiere, helped connect John Goodman&#39;s Bill Randa to the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters cast. As for the second, it seemingly laid the groundwork for the story of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2.

Monarch&#39;s show shook things up for its principal characters by jumping forward by two years in the Monsterverse timeline. But not only have Cate, May, Shaw, and Keiko found themselves thrust in 2017, they&#39;re also on Skull Island with Kong. Their hosts are APEX, who apparently operate a facility there on the island. As for what they&#39;re doing there, that&#39;s yet to be fully explained. That said, what&#39;s known about them in Godzilla vs. Kong shed light on why they&#39;d be sharing a home with Kong in 2017.





 APEX Building A Base On Skull Island Makes Sense (Because Of Kong) 
         

Though Brenda Holland never mentioned Skull Island in her earlier exchanges with May, their talk in episode 7 offers a hint about their motivations for going to Skull Island. Before ultimately making a deal with Verdugo, Holland was only willing to let May go if she would be APEX&#39;s spy within Monarch. By her admission, her goal in using May in this way would have been to acquire information on the Titans. As Holland said, they believe studying Titan nervous systems will help APEX accomplish their goals. That alone can account for why they&#39;d want a base on Skull Island.

Skull Island is the only known place in the Monsterverse where a Titan (Kong) roams freely. All the others are either in hibernation, keeping a low profile in the ocean, or lurking in the Monsterverse&#39;s Hollow Earth world. That makes it the perfect place for APEX to conduct its Titan studies. There on Skull Island, APEX operatives and scientists will have plenty of opportunities to examine Kong in his natural habitat and pick up valuable information on Titan biology. What&#39;s more, Skull Island is populated with other unique monsters that can further benefit APEX&#39;s monster research.






 APEX&#39;s Skull Island Facility Was Most Likely A Result Of Their APEX Deal 
          

Chances are, APEX being on Skull Island is a direct consequence of the unseen conversation between Brenda Holland and Natalia Verdugo at the end of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 7. As she said to Simmons on the phone, they&#39;ve arranged a &#34;deal&#34; that she believes will help APEX in the long run. Sharing their resources - which may or may not have included Skull Island - could have been one of APEX&#39;s conditions for giving Monarch what they wanted. If the two are going to start working together in 2015, it stands to reason that APEX could have gained power and a place for itself on Skull Island by 2017.



 Godzilla Vs. Kong Already Hinted At APEX&#39;s Skull Island Ties 
          




Nearly three years before the release of the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, there was already a clue pointing to APEX&#39;s connection to Skull Island. In Godzilla vs. Kong, APEX was shown to be in possession of Skullcrawler eggs. How they got them wasn&#39;t revealed within the movie and was considered a mystery since APEX had no obvious way of obtaining them. After all, there was no indication that any organization other than Monarch had forces on Skull Island. Monarch did discover it in the 1970s, decades before anyone else reached it, and therefore they most assuredly had a great level of control over what happens on the island.

The confirmation that APEX had an outpost on Skull Island should put an end to any speculation over how APEX got their hands on a Skullcrawler. Plus, it allows for more insight into what tasks they&#39;ve been spending their time on. The fact that they stored Skullcrawler eggs suggests that they may have tried obtaining either the DNA or the eggs of other fauna associated with Skull Island as well. There&#39;s no telling what sort of studies or morally questionable experiments have been going on behind closed doors at APEX. The work they did with the monkeys to build the neuro-cybernetic interface in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters is a bad sign for any Skull Island monster that winds up in their custody.






All 10 episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 are available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.
