# Ahsoka Confirmed Star Wars Rebels Season 4 Is Really Ezra Bridger s Jedi Trial


## SUMMARY 



  Ezra Bridger should now be a fully-fledged Jedi Knight since he passed his Jedi Trials in the Rebels season 4 finale.   Despite not having an official declaration from a Jedi above him, Ezra&#39;s abilities and dedication to the light side of the Force make him deserving of the Jedi Knight title.   If a formal promotion is required, it is likely that Luke Skywalker would confer the title on Ezra, as his abilities surpass those of most Padawans.

## Literature Review

The Ahsoka series shows just how far Ezra Bridger has come since his first appearance in Star Wars Rebels by proving he’s no longer a Padawan.




The Ahsoka series confirmed just how far Ezra Bridger has come as a Jedi since Star Wars Rebels, and it may also have revealed his current status in the derelict Jedi Order. Eman Esfandi brought Ezra to life in live-action as a seasoned warrior, while also remaining faithful to Taylor Gray’s quirkier performance in Rebels. Now that Ezra has returned to the main Star Wars galaxy with Grand Admiral Thrawn, it’s likely he’ll feature in more upcoming projects as an important ally of the New Republic, especially considering he is one of the very few Bokken Jedi left.




While the New Republic seeks to protect its newfound peace from a resurgent Empire, Ezra Bridger may be looking for a Padawan so he can pass on what he’s learned and keep his Jedi lineage alive. Like his master, Kanan Jarrus, Ezra’s training was entirely unorthodox. And despite the skills he displays in Ahsoka, no one has technically ever given him the rank of Jedi Knight. Traditionally, a Padawan needed to pass their “Jedi Trials” before becoming a Knight. Nevertheless, the Ahsoka series all but confirmed that Ezra passed his Trials long ago.


 Ezra Bridger Completed His “Jedi Trials” In The Finale Of Rebels 
         

Ezra Bridger is a fully-fledged Jedi Knight because he passed his Jedi Trials in the Rebels season 4 finale. First, Ezra rejected Palpatine’s offer to reunite with his deceased parents. But this test was not enough to prove Ezra a Jedi. He forsook his attachment to his parents in favor of keeping his attachment to the Ghost Crew, his new family. Nevertheless, Ezra made the ultimate sacrifice in the end of the episode by letting go of the Ghost Crew as well. By leaving the main galaxy with Thrawn, Ezra proved how much he’d grown as a Jedi.




While the two tests in Rebels may seem circumstantial, most Jedi Trials often were. For example, the Jedi Council was ready to give Ahsoka Tano the rank of Jedi Knight after they banished her for a crime she didn’t commit. Her dedication to proving her own innocence was her “Jedi Trials.” In other words, Jedi Trials didn’t always have to be planned beforehand. However, while Ahsoka had someone above her offer her the promotion, Ezra doesn’t have any Jedi above him who can officially knight him.



 Kanan Jarrus Would Have Knighted Ezra If He’d Lived To See The Battle Of Lothal 
          

Had Kanan Jarrus lived to see Ezra’s heroic and selfless decisions in the Battle of Lothal, it’s almost certain he’d consider them Ezra’s Jedi Trials. Typically, a Padawan is promoted after a few years of training under a Jedi Master. In Ezra’s case, by the end of Rebels, he’d been learning with Kanan Jarrus for over five years. Throughout that time, Ezra constantly struggled with his attachment to his parents and the Ghost Crew. But he proved he could selflessly cast aside his feelings in the Rebels finale to keep the peace and save the people he loved.




Despite Ezra having no one to officially declare him a Jedi Knight, he clearly displays the aptitude for it at the end of Rebels and beyond. Given his unorthodox training, it seems fair for him to bend the rules by knighting himself. And if, for some reason, the story still demands a true Jedi confer the title on him, then Luke Skywalker would likely be the one to do it. Either way, Luke promoting Ezra Bridger would seem like a formality, as Ezra’s abilities outclass almost any Padawan at this point.

                  How Ezra Bridger&#39;s Secret Force Power Allowed Him To Survive Until Ahsoka   Ezra Bridger&#39;s most powerful Force ability helped him survive long enough to be reunited with Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren in the Ahsoka show.   



 Ahsoka Season 1 Confirms How Far Ezra Has Come As A Jedi 
          

The Rebels season 4 finale was Ezra Bridger’s unofficial Jedi Trials, and he’s spent the last 9 years in exile on Peridea honing his skills even further. In Ahsoka season 1, Ezra shows almost total reliance on the Force. When Sabine Wren offers him his old lightsaber, he refuses, and instead fights Thrawn’s army with the Force as his ally. Refusing to rely on something as superficial as a lightsaber displays wisdom in the Force that rivals most Jedi Knights during the height of the Jedi Order. In fact, Ezra may even be close to becoming a Jedi Master.






Ezra Bridger was 14 when Rebels began, and he is 28 by the time of Ahsoka; he&#39;s been training in the Force for over half his life now.




In Rebels season 1, Ezra began as someone who barely knew about the Jedi and Force. In the beginning, he was impulsive, oftentimes making decisions that accidentally endangered the Ghost Crew. Given his association with Maul and a Sith holocron, he’s experienced the dark side and even flirted with it. But he ultimately proved his allegiance to the light side of the Force in the Rebels season 4 finale. Now that Ezra Bridger is an unofficial Jedi Knight in Ahsoka, he should take on an apprentice and teach them the ways of the Force, just as Kanan once taught him.
