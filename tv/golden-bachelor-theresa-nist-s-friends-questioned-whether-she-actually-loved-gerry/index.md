## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Theresa Nist admits she had not fully convinced her friends that she wanted to marry Gerry Turner after getting engaged.




The Golden Bachelor’s Theresa Nist revealed that her friends were skeptical about the news of her engagement to Gerry Turner. Gerry’s journey on The Golden Bachelor season 1 began with him dating over 20 women, but Theresa was the one he felt a connection with right from the start. Gerry and Theresa celebrated her 70th birthday together during the season, and many other romantic dates followed until Gerry gave his heart away to the financial services professional. Gerry, 72, dropped down on one knee to propose to Theresa, 72, and she was giddy with excitement as she told him, “Yes!”




Gerry and Theresa are getting married in a live televised ceremony on January 4, 2024, and in her latest interview with People, the Shrewsbury, New Jersey, resident spilled some behind-the-scenes secrets about her romance with the Indiana man. Theresa’s friends were not sure that she was head over heels with the man she was going to marry. “I would say my friends who didn&#39;t know until when it really was announced, they just wanted to make sure, ‘Are you really in love? Are you really happy?&#39;” Theresa revealed. She simply told them, “Yes, I am.” Fortunately, as soon as her friends knew that, they were satisfied and came on board.

Gerry had, after all, told Theresa that she was the person he couldn’t live without and that he loved her “1,000%.” He chose her over fellow contestant Leslie Fhima. Theresa will be exchanging vows with Gerry during The Golden Wedding special on ABC. Theresa and Gerry were both previously married. While Gerry has two daughters and two granddaughters, Theresa has a son, a daughter, and six grandsons. All of their family members have been involved in the wedding planning.

The Golden Bachelor couple will celebrate the memory of their late spouses in the two-hour ceremony. Theresa knows that life isn’t over for the two of them yet. The best is yet to come for the golden pair.
