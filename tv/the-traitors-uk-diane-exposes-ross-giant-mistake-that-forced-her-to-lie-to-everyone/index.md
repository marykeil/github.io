## Literature Review

The Traitors UK season 2&#39;s murdered player Diane Carson came into the game with her son Ross, who made a mistake immediately and set her up to fail.




The Traitors UK season 2’s Diane Carson came into the game with her son, Ross Carson, in secret, but a mistake made early in the game caused her to have to lie unnecessarily throughout her time on the series. The Traitors UK season 2 has been a fascinating mix of the Traitors deceiving the Faithful, while the larger group works their hardest to find out who’s taking them out one by one. Despite both of them being Faithful, Diane and Ross had a difficult time working together in the game, as their suspicions about who were Traitors tended to be different from day to day.




During an interview, Diane shared that pinpointing Traitors with her son wasn’t the only difficulty of her time as a cast member of The Traitors UK season 2. “He – not we, sorry, there’s no ‘we’ in this – he made a mistake within two minutes of getting on the train,” Diane revealed in a clip shared by The Traitors HQ on Twitter. “ [Ross] was going to say he was from Blackpool which would allow me to say I was from Lenham, then I wouldn’t have to lie. And Jonny came in and said…’where are you from?’ and [Ross] said Lenham.”

During the rest of the interview, Diane shared that it was difficult to keep up with the lies that hid her and her son’s true relationship throughout the game. She revealed she chose to tell the rest of the cast she was from Ireland, which isn’t technically a lie though she lives in England now. Otherwise, Diane shared she “was in this whole string of lies,” during her time on The Traitors UK season 2 despite spending the entirety of her time in the game as a Faithful. It was clear that the issues Diane was facing in the game made it hard for her to break from her shell.





 

While Diane and Ross were hoping that coming into The Traitors UK with someone they could trust 100%, things changed when they actually got into the game and had to begin playing. With more than just their own well-being in the game on the line, Diane and Ross tried to align their votes and ideas as best as they could, but it was clear they were both thinking too independently and hiding how they were really feeling from each other. Though they were both doing their best in the game, they didn’t have suspicion on the right people and it ultimately cost them the chance at up to $120,000 pounds.

As Ross has continued on in the game, Diane has been cheering him on from the sidelines. Looking for revenge for his mother’s murder, Ross has been working hard to try and figure out who the Traitors are and how he can avenge his mom. With a new wrench thrown in the mix after the most recent episode of The Traitors UK, it’s possible Ross could have finally discovered the key to making sure whoever murdered Diane will pay the consequences.
