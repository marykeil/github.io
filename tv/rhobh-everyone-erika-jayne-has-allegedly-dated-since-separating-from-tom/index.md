# RHOBH Everyone Erika Jayne Has Allegedly Dated Since Separating From Tom


## SUMMARY 



  Amidst the legal drama surrounding her ex-husband, Erika Jayne revealed a strong rotation of hookups at the RHOBH reunion, drawing attention away from Tom Girardi&#39;s misdeeds.   Speculation about Erika&#39;s love life has been rampant, with names like Scott Disick and Michael Gaughan being thrown around as potential suitors. Michael, a Las Vegas Casino owner, seems like a natural fit for Erika after Tom.   While rumors suggested Erika was dating Scooter Braun, she quickly shut them down, calling them &#34;silly as f**k.&#34; Jim Wilkes II, a disgraced lawyer, is the one man Erika is linked to, as he reportedly helps her with her financial troubles.

## Literature Review
Regarding who&#39;s in Erika Jayne&#39;s rotation, several high-profile names popped up in 2022, and the RHOBH star has many potential suitors. 




There&#39;s a lot of speculation about Erika Jayne from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, especially about who she&#39;s dating. Since Erika&#39;s separation from Tom Girardi, she has faced accusations about her involvement in his devious financial schemes. However, amid all the lawsuits and diamond drama, her love life had fallen on the back burner.




However, Erika shared that she had a strong rotation of hookups in motion at the RHOBH season 12 reunion, which drew focus away from the legal drama surrounding Tom. While there aren&#39;t any definitive answers as to who Erika&#39;s been dating recently, that hasn&#39;t stopped everyone from playing guessing games. Erika&#39;s been linked to a few big names over the last year. Hopefully, she&#39;ll find a real man who can put her Savage X Fenty ambassador closet to work sooner than later. A new chapter of romance could be precisely what Erika needs to get out of the doom and gloom.


 Scott Disick 

 

One of the most ridiculous names thrown around on Twitter was Scott Disick. Wrex Weed from Twitter asked, &#34;Is Erika Jayne dating Scott Disick??&#34; While Scott was linked to Kimberley Stewart, he&#39;s mostly known for dating barely legal women. However, Scott is always up for a good time, and his honesty and humor match Erika&#39;s. Whether Scott and Erika hooked up, they could quickly form a friendship with shared histories of being reality television&#39;s black sheep.






 Michael Gaughan 

 

One of the more realistic prospective love interests proposed was Michael Gaughan. Kempire Daily speculated on YouTube about Erika&#39;s potential relationship with Michael, and the rumor mill ran with it. They also joked about Erika&#39;s potential suitors, not necessarily younger but younger than Tom. Michael is still, however, old enough to be considered a sugar daddy like Tom.

Tres Luis Rueles from Twitter joked, &#34;Not someone on Wikipedia listing Erika Jayne as one of Gaughan&#39;s children. Who did this!?!&#34; Michael is a Las Vegas Casino owner originally from Omaha, Nebraska. After Tom, Michael does seem like a natural fit for Erika. His love of cowboys also doesn&#39;t seem alienated from Erika&#39;s Southern roots.



 Scooter Braun 

 




Another unlikely but amusing suggestion was Scooter Braun. Before Erika and Tom separated, Erika met Scooter at a political event. When the rumors started circulating, Scooter had recently filed for divorce around the time Erika filed for divorce. Michael Breslin from Twitter joked, &#34;Taylor is pathologically using cabin core to get back at Scooter Br*un, who is now reportedly dating Erika Jayne.&#34; However, Erika was quick to shut down this rumor calling the accusation &#34;silly as f**k,&#34; according to Page Six.



 Jim Wilkes II 
          

Putting the rumors to rest is Erika&#39;s connection to disgraced lawyer Jim Wilkes II. Clearly, Erika has a type, as her ex-husband, Tom, is also accurately described as a disgraced lawyer. The pair were spotted by a photographer at Caesar&#39;s Palace in Las Vegas. Jim is reportedly assisting Erika with her financial woes due to her divorce from Tom. It appears Erika can put other rumors to rest and solidify her new sugar daddy. While Jim is considerably older than Erika, he&#39;s not quite as old as Tom.




Ultimately, it&#39;s unlikely that Erika dated any of the rumored men aside from Jim. For now, The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star is enjoying her new sugar daddy and distancing herself from Tom&#39;s legal troubles. Hopefully, that Savage X Fenty wardrobe is being put to good use with her new beau.
