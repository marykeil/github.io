## Literature Review
Apple TV&#39;s Foundation is one of the most exciting sci-fi series on television. Here are the top things we want to see heading into season 3.




With Apple TV&#43; renewing Foundation for season 3, several narrative ideas are on the wishlist. The science fiction show is developed for TV by The Dark Knight trilogy writer David S. Goyer, adapting the classic novel series by Isaac Asimov. The Foundation novels encompass centuries of a fictional history, meaning the series has taken significant creative liberties to allow for consistent characters, such as retaining the Cleons through genetic cloning and Hari Seldon through AI consciousness.
Since Foundation isn&#39;t a direct adaptation of the novels, there&#39;s plenty of room for inferred prediction and theorizing about what could happen in season 3. Season 2 drew elements primarily from the novel Foundation and Empire and some ideas from Second Foundation, and season 3 will continue to use ideas from both non-linearly. The series has also incorporated elements from other Asimov book series like the Robot and Empire series. Season 2 was a vast improvement over season 1 narratively, and the next installment will hopefully continue to grow more epic.
            
 
 Foundation Season 3 Still Needs To Explain One Of Gaal Dornick&#39;s Most Interesting Abilities 
Foundation season 3 has one aspect of Gaal Dornick&#39;s abilities that it needs to explore in greater detail, or it will remain a mystery.













 








 10  Foundation Season 3 Should Involve Demerzel More 
Demerzel is one of the show&#39;s best characters, and she needs the spotlight.
        

Demerzel was one of the most captivating Foundation characters in season 1, and season 2 developed her further with a massive plot twist. Demerzel&#39;s backstory in Foundation season 2 established her as a complex and self-motivated player. Given that Empire is barreling toward its own destruction, seeing Demerzel inch closer to her freedom will be one of the most exciting narratives in the future. Hopefully, season 3 will continue to explore her character further.





 9  Foundation Should Explore The History Of The Robot Wars 
This historical event has been teased several times, and it seems important to the show&#39;s future. Given that Isaac Asimov&#39;s series are connected, Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Foundation has been incorporating ideas from the Robot series. For example, Demerzel is an adaptation of the Robot character R. Daneel. Several characters in Foundation refer to a historical event known as the &#34;Robot Wars,&#34; which wiped out most of the galaxy&#39;s robots. Given the serious consequences this event had on the larger world and some of the show&#39;s main characters, it seems necessary to explore it more.
            
 
 8 Foundation Characters, Ranked By How Powerful They Will Be In Season 3 
The struggle for power is shared by many characters in Foundation. From Hari Seldon to Lady Demerzel, however, the type of power they hold varies.









 8  The Future Of Sareth And Dawn&#39;s Child Needs To Be Explained 
Sareth and Day&#39;s child should tie-in to Foundation season 3&#39;s timeline. Foundation seasons 1 and 2 have shown Brother Dawn to naturally be the rebellious stage of the Cleon dynasty. In season 2, Dawn develops a romance with Queen Sareth of the Cloud Dominion, who&#39;s betrothed to Brother Day. The end of the season sees the pair escape Trantor together, seemingly with the intent of raising their child away from the Empire. Wild theories for Foundation season 3 suggest that their child could be an essential figure in the future, and it&#39;ll be interesting to see how it turns out.





 7  The Mule Should Be The Season&#39;s Main Villain 
The Mule was set up through most of season 2, and should replace Brother Day as the central antagonist. Brother Day has been the central antagonist for Foundation seasons 1 and 2, and while Lee Pace makes for a phenomenal villain, continuous conflicts between Empire and Foundation may get redundant. The Mule was set up through most of season 2, given that Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick have entered a cryosleep in preparation for the antagonist&#39;s arrival. A change in pace with a fresh antagonist can help the series persist for its inevitably vast timeline.





 6  Foundation Season 3 Should Explore A New Version Of Cleon 
New Cleons will make for fresh characters.


 







Since Cleon has been the antagonist of previous Foundation seasons, and three new Cleons have been decanted and become Empire, season 3 could be an opportunity for a fresh variant of the character. To ensure that the new Cleons don&#39;t repeat the same mistakes as previous ones, Demerzel will be keeping tighter control of the new trio. It&#39;s the first time that Demerzel has had to replace all three simultaneously, and there will likely be severe consequences for this action.
            
 
 Foundation: All Major Changes The Show Makes To Isaac Asimov&#39;s Books 
David Goyer&#39;s Foundation TV series brings Isaac Asimov&#39;s works to life on Apple TV&#43; - but it makes quite considerable changes along the way.









 5  Season 3 Should Explore Society In The Second Foundation 
The TV series can&#39;t gloss over the societal progress of the Foundation.
        

For the most part, Foundation season 2 steered away from events happening on Terminus. However, many of its civilians have survived the cataclysmic conflict with the Empire and have left to establish the second Foundation. While many season 2 narratives took place on other planets, it&#39;s essential to see how society has developed for Hari Seldon&#39;s civilization, given that it&#39;s the focal point of the novels. Season 2 loosely explored the Foundation&#39;s transition from scientism to commerce, and there&#39;s more to explore in the aftermath of Hober Mallow&#39;s arc.





 4  Foundation Needs To Incorporate More Foundation Book Characters 
David S. Goyer has teased more characters from &#34;The Mule&#34; in season 3.
        

Most of the Foundation cast consists of characters from Asimov&#39;s novels, but more have been skipped over, given the non-linear approach to book events. Season 2 featured Bel Riose, a pivotal character in Foundation and Empire, and Hober Mallow from Foundation, though both were killed off. The Mule chapter in Foundation and Empire introduces new characters: Toran, Bayta, Ebling, and Magnifico, who have been teased as characters for season 3 by showrunner David S. Goyer in an interview with Variety.





 3  The Two Hari Seldons Should Meet 
There are two versions of Hari&#39;s AI consciousness.


 







Despite being one of the show&#39;s leads, Hari Seldon is a highly enigmatic character with debatable intentions. The original Hari Seldon has died, but two versions of him still exist: the Hari that&#39;s been with Gaal and Salvor in season 2 is an AI form with a human body, and there&#39;s also a digital version of Hari in the Vault. It would be interesting to see the two versions of Hari meet in season 3, as it might provide some insight into his psyche. The duality between the versions would be fascinating, showing how consistent they are with the original Hari.





 2  Demerzel Should Explore The Prime Radiant In Season 3 
Foundation season 3 will show what Demerzel is capable of with the Prime Radiant.
        

The Prime Radiant is an enormously important item in Foundation, as it holds all of Seldon&#39;s psychohistory calculations. Demerzel admits at the end of season 2 that she&#39;s not capable of understanding the device yet but will be able to. Given how powerful Demerzel already is through her intelligence and cunning, it will be fascinating to see what she&#39;s capable of with the knowledge of the Prime Radiant. The event could drastically affect the galaxy and the course of Seldon&#39;s anticipated timeline and could finally give Empire an edge over Seldon.





 1  Foundation Season 3 Should See A Significant Step In The Imperium&#39;s Fall 
The Imperium is barreling toward its destruction.
        

The whole premise of Foundation explores the fall of the Imperium and, inevitably, civilization. The series has already seen consequential steps toward this impending doom, with season 2 seeing Empire take significant losses with the destruction of its Spacer ships. The unpredictability of the Mule could make a substantial impact, but it seems like Foundation is gearing toward the Genetic Dynasty, seeing to its self-destruction. Season 3 could see the state of the Imperium continue to decline.

 Foundation 
Isaac Asimov&#39;s novel series is brought to life in Foundation, a television adaptation of the epic sci-fi saga created for Apple TV&#43; but deviates somewhat from the original source material. The show follows a group of exiled humans that find themselves as the last chance to save the Galactic Empire - from itself.Â
