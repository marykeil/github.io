## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 7 couple Emily Larina and Aleksandr &#34;Sasha&#34; Larin may have split for good if these several social media clues are true. 




It’s been a long time since 90 Day Fiancé season 7 couple Emily Larina and Sasha Larin have been together on TV, but are they still together? Emily was a 27-year-old college graduate from Oregon when she met Sasha, 31. Emily was living abroad in Russia, hoping to teach English and travel across Europe. Emily had a change of plans after meeting Sasha, who worked as a trainer at a gym she frequented in Volgograd. Sasha’s backstory was full of red flags as Sasha already had two Russian ex-wives and two sons with each woman.




Emily later became pregnant with Sasha’s child, and he became known as a serial impregnator among fans. When Sasha’s first ex-wife showed up in season 7, she told Emily that Sasha had cheated on her with his second wife. She also suggested that Sasha could have cheated on Emily with his second wife. Emily had decided not to give birth to her and Sasha’s child, David, in the U.S. because it would not have been possible for Sasha to come with her and witness the birth. Sasha then moved to America on a K-1 visa to marry Emily in Newport, Oregon.

Unlike most 90 Day Fiancé cast members, Emily has not used her Instagram page to become an influencer. Emily likes to keep things lowkey on social media and doesn’t post any updates about her private life as often as fans might want her to. However, in July 2023, Emily made a surprise visit to the app to share the results of her hair appointment. She tagged her hair stylist and wrote, “I’m so glad I had the chance to see @jeni.hair.girl while I was in town.” Emily brightened up her natural blonde hair and raved about how much she loved her long layers.



 Sasha Larin Is Still Body-Conscious 

 

One thing about Sasha that still hasn’t changed after all these years is his love for fitness. Sasha loves flexing his muscles in gym mirrors and pumping iron.“I’ll just leave it here without description,” Sasha captioned his July 2023 fitness update. Sasha had pushed Emily into losing weight after she had their baby. It was one of the biggest reasons why Emily’s sister, Betsy, resented him. He had also questioned the “cra**y food” that Emily and her family had for breakfast. Sasha preferred oatmeal with peanut butter and fruit to start his day and not a bowl of cereal with sugar.

It appears Sasha doesn’t have to indulge in American food anymore, as his location for the post was a gym in Russia. Sasha had geotagged the post as “World Class Таганский,” which is a gym based in Moscow. Emily isn&#39;t in any of the 85 posts Sasha has on his Instagram. Sasha had last posted a photo with his and Emily’s son outside Native Foods in Oregon, with Emily also not sharing any photos with Sasha. Emily and Sasha were reportedly moving to Russia in June 2021. While the plan was for Sasha to get his family to the U.S., the pandemic added to their visa woes.

In June 2023, Emily posted a set of photos on Instagram captioned, “A little bit of life lately. It’s good to be home.” When a fan asked Emily, “So pretty. Are u and Alex still together?” someone else replied, “I&#39;m thinking no, possibly.” A different 90 Day Fiancé viewer suggested Emily and Sasha are still together, but they’re having issues in their marriage, which they’re keeping off social media. Emily and Sasha are also not following each other, which speaks volumes about their relationship status in 2024.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
