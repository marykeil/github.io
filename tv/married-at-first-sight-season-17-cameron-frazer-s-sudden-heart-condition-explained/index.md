## Literature Review
Married at First Sight season 17 cast member Cameron Frazer developed a sudden heart condition after ending his marriage to Clare Kerr. 




Married at First Sight season 17 cast member Cameron Frazer revealed that he developed a sudden heart condition amid his split from Clare Kerr. Cameron and Clare said yes to marrying each other as strangers at the altar, and the pair seemed to have good chemistry during their wedding. However, their disconnect started on their wedding night, which was awkward and set the pace for their honeymoon. Cameron, 33, and Clare, 27, could not find a spark during the honeymoon and clashed several times about their outlooks and values. Most notably, Cameron and Clare differed on their views on therapy and raising children in the church.




Cameron and Clare&#39;s impasse with Clare wanting to raise her children religiously and Cameron not wanting to proved to be the main factor that broke their marriage. They tried to get to the basics of enjoying each other&#39;s company but Cameron felt like they were beating a dead horse and it was bad for his mental health. Moreover, Clare did not want to advance romantically with Cameron, but he was attracted to her. The pair mutually decided to part ways and get a divorce. After the big decision to split, Clare opened up about Cameron&#39;s health, and viewers heard from Cameron about what was going on.


 Cameron Will Need To Have Heart Surgery 
          

During the latest episode of Married at First Sight season 17, Cameron, who is well over 6 feet tall, appeared back at his Boulder, Colorado, home where he was sitting on his stairs trying to get his heart rate down. He explained, &#34;I&#39;ve developed a heart condition. The doctors don&#39;t really have much to say other than I&#39;m going to need a procedure done on my heart.&#34; He relayed that the surgery would need to be done in the next several weeks and that he hadn&#39;t been doing &#34;anything&#34; strenuous because it gets his heart rate over 100, which is a danger zone for Cameron at this time, and it could cause permanent damage to his heart.




Cameron said he hasn&#39;t been meeting with the experts or anyone else and that he has just been at home. The scene ended with Cameron monitoring his heart rate on his watch as he remarked that it didn&#39;t look like his heart rate was going to go down. Cameron did not elaborate on what his actual diagnosis was. Now that Cameron has a serious medical problem going on, the focus has shifted from his relationship with Clare and its aftermath to viewers following Cameron to make sure he is okay.



 Did Cameron&#39;s Marriage Demise With Clare Lead To Heart Condition? 

 

Clare and Cameron have butted heads and had some uncomfortable moments and struggles in the month they were married (via Lifetime.) In his scene talking about this heart condition, Cameron pondered, &#34;Did the stress of my separation from Clare lead to this heart problem? Um it was probably something that was going to happen, maybe it accelerated it.&#34; Cameron did not directly blame the strain and suffering he experienced in his short marriage as the reason for his medical issue, but it seems to have exacerbated it.






 Cameron Does Not Have Family By His Side 
         

Married at First Sight season 17 viewers learned that Cameron has been in America without his family. He is a New Zealand native who has close friends in the Denver area that he confides in. Moreover, Cameron said his dad was in very poor health and did not even know Cameron was getting married on TV. Since Cameron and Clare are in such a delicate spot, it&#39;s hard to say how Cameron will want Clare to show up and be there for him, if at all. Clare is eager to help Cameron through this time. Next episode, Cameron will have his procedure, so fans will come to know more.



Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST.
