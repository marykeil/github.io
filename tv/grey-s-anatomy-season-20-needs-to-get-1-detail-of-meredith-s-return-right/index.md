## SUMMARY 



  It&#39;s crucial for Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 20 to get one detail of Meredith Grey&#39;s return right, considering her importance to the show&#39;s success.   Season 20 shouldn&#39;t have Meredith taking center stage, as her story has already been well-explored and other characters deserve the focus.

## Literature Review
The upcoming season 20 of ABC&#39;s medical drama Grey&#39;s Anatomy needs to be careful to get one detail of Meredith Grey&#39;s return correct. 




Because of how paramount Meredith Grey has been to Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;s success, it is important that season 20 gets one detail of her return correct. Played by Ellen Pompeo, Meredith left for Boston during season 19 of Grey&#39;s Anatomy in order to focus on her children&#39;s education. Though shocking, given how involved the character has been in the show, the show has managed to continue to find success in her absence. Plus, Meredith has made appearances since her departure and the show&#39;s director and star have confirmed she will continue to do so in season 20.




While a return from Meredith is always exciting and welcomed, Grey&#39;s Anatomy should be cautious in how they approach this in season 20. It might seem like the best approach to have the titular character as involved as possible in the new season, just like she was in prior ones. However, this is not the way to go, and Grey&#39;s Anatomy needs to have a sense of balance in season 20.

                  Grey&#39;s Anatomy Season 20: Release Date, Cast, Story, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 20 has been confirmed, here&#39;s everything you need to know about the next season before it arrives in 2024 on ABC.    


 Meredith&#39;s Return In Grey&#39;s Anatomy Season 20 Shouldn&#39;t Take Center Stage 
          

Though Meredith Grey has been an integral part of Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;s success for the past nineteen seasons, season 20 shouldn&#39;t have her taking center stage. Because her story has been front and center for so long, season 20 should keep Meredith&#39;s role smaller than it has been. Her story has been well-explored, and audiences have gotten the chance to see her in many stages of her life and career. Viewers know that Meredith is okay despite all of the horrible things that have happened to her. It has been made known that now she is working on something she&#39;s passionate about and taking care of her family, so it is not a bad thing for her to continue in a more limited role. This would allow for the focus to be on other characters, and Grey&#39;s Anatomy has proven that that can work.




Meredith had a scaled-back role in season 19 of Grey&#39;s Anatomy, and while it took a little bit to get used to, the show was able to carry on without her. She is an incredibly interesting character, but the show was able to focus on all of the other captivating characters who haven&#39;t gotten as much time to shine. Season 20 should follow suit, and have Meredith take on a more limited role. This would allow for characters like Miranda, Richard, Jo, Owen, and Amelia to be further explored.

                  Grey&#39;s Anatomy: How Old Meredith Is (From Season 1-19)   Meredith Grey has led Grey&#39;s Anatomy through 19 seasons and viewers have seen her grow in all areas of her life, but how old is she?    



 Grey&#39;s Anatomy Must Strike The Right Balance Bringing Meredith Back 
          

While Meredith Grey shouldn&#39;t be front and center once again, Grey&#39;s Anatomy should still bring her back. She is the titular character, after all. Luckily, there are definitely ways to have the best of both worlds in this case. The show can capitalize on the excitement of Meredith returning without having her overshadow more prevalent storylines. For example, she can come back for an episode or two to consult on major cases and reconnect with her fellow doctors. This allows Meredith to still be connected to the show, without dragging on her storyline or preventing other characters from shining.




             Grey&#39;s Anatomy Grey&#39;s Anatomy is considered one of the great television shows of our time, winning several awards and four Emmys. The high-intensity medical drama follows Meredith Grey and the team of doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial, who are faced with life-or-death decisions on a daily basis.
