# HBO s House Of The Dragon Spinoff Will Continue An Exciting Fantasy Franchise Trend


## SUMMARY 



  Nine Voyages will now be an animated spinoff of House of the Dragon rather than a live-action series.   The decision to make the spinoff animated continues a trend seen with other fantasy franchises like The Lord of the Rings and The Witcher.   Animation is a great medium for this genre of storytelling, allowing for more flexibility in bringing fantastical elements of the world to life.

## Literature Review
HBO’s upcoming House of the Dragon spinoff just got a major update, and it’s continuing a growing trend among popular fantasy franchises.




House of the Dragon is only the second show to take place in HBO&#39;s Game of Thrones&#39; universe, with several more planned — and one upcoming House of the Dragon spinoff will follow an exciting fantasy franchise trend that opens the door to all kinds of possibilities. With House of the Dragon approaching its second season, it&#39;s somewhat surprising that HBO is already developing content based on its supporting characters. However, the history behind George R.R. Martin&#39;s fantasy world is vast, and there&#39;s plenty more to explore on-screen.




Nine Voyages will take Game of Thrones fans to the seas, following Lord Corlys Velaryon as he sets sail in Westeros. Set before the events of House of the Dragon, the prequel will reveal how Corlys earns his title and reputation as the Sea Snake. While Nine Voyages is currently in development at HBO, not many other details have been released about the upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff. One recent update makes a major change to the show&#39;s format, though, adding to a growing trend in the fantasy genre.



All eight seasons of Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon season 1 are streaming on Max.

While Nine Voyages was originally supposed to be a live-action series like Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon, author George R.R. Martin recently revealed on his website that the HBO spinoff has shifted from a live-action format to an animated one. Martin cited &#34;budgetary constraints&#34; as a reason behind the choice to make Nine Voyages an animated series. And it&#39;s true that HBO will have an easier time bringing the Sea Snake&#39;s adventures to life without worrying about live-action sets, props, and special effects to do them justice.




The Game of Thrones franchise adding animation to its lineup is an exciting prospect — and it&#39;s a decision that follows the lead of several other growing fantasy properties. While live-action fantasy shows won&#39;t go away any time soon, more properties seem to be expanding into animation. Game of Thrones isn&#39;t the first franchise to make the jump to this medium, and it probably won&#39;t be the last.



 The Animated House Of The Dragons Spinoff Continues An Exciting Fantasy Franchise Trend 
         

Game of Thrones isn&#39;t the first major fantasy franchise to dip its toes into animation in recent years, and Nine Voyages is continuing a trend already seen with The Lord of the Rings and The Witcher. While Warner Bros. saw success with the live-action Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies, its 2024 release will return to Middle-earth in an animated setting. Like NIne Voyages, The War of the Rohirrim will expand on the lore of the live-action projects using a different medium. Although The War of Rohirrim isn&#39;t LOTR&#39;s first animated film — that would be 1978&#39;s The Lord of the Rings — it indicates a potential shift away from live-action.




Netflix&#39;s The Witcher franchise has also added an animated project to its lineup, with The Nightmare of the Wolf debuting on the streamer back in 2021. The animated film followed Geralt of Rivia&#39;s mentor, Vesemir, during his younger years, showing how he became the battle-worn Witcher introduced in the live-action show. The movie also revealed what the Continent was like nearly a century before the events of The Witcher. Similar to the upcoming Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones spinoffs, it took viewers deeper into an already-established fantasy world. And there&#39;s a good reason animation is used for such purposes.



 Why Animation Is A Great Medium For Fantasy Storytelling 
          

While live-action fantasy series are impressive in their own right, animation is an ideal medium for this type of storytelling. The fantasy genre is full of characters, abilities, and action sequences that are difficult to capture in live-action. While evolving technology makes things easier, animated movies and shows offer more flexibility than their live-action counterparts. As Martin suggests, animating elements like magic, dragon, and fight sequences don&#39;t require as much money or effort to bring to life.




For established franchises like Game of Thrones, The Lord of the Rings, and The Witcher, animation also eliminates the need to recreate characters and sets that match pre-existing projects. Since Nine Voyages will follow a character viewers already know, the House of the Dragon spinoff would need to ensure its casting fits with Steve Toussaint&#39;s version of Corlys Velaryon. Its sets would also need to match the locations Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon have covered before. By contrast, an animated Nine Voyages show can get away with changing things up — and it can recreate parts of the live-action shows more easily in the first place.
