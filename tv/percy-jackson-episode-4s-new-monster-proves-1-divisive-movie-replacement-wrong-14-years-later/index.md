## Literature Review
Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4&#39;s new villains confirm that the 2010 movie divisively changing a crucial scene was unnecessary.





Summary

  Percy Jackson season 1, episode 4 introduces the villains Echidna and the Chimera, proving that they should not have been replaced in the 2010 movie adaptation.   The TV show effectively portrays the terrifying nature of Echidna and the Chimera, providing a compelling and scary battle for Percy.   Including Echidna and the Chimera in the TV show expands on the franchise&#39;s mythology and avoids potential problems with future story set-ups.  







The next stop on the titular demigod’s quest in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 4 introduces the villainous Echidna and her monster Chimera, who prove that the 2010 movie made a mistake in replacing them. Though Percy Jackson season 1 makes several book changes, the Disney&#43; series also has significant involvement from author Rick Riordan, which wasn’t the case for the 2010 and 2013 movie adaptations. Consequently, some divisive changes were made to the book series’ events and characters in the movies, including the absence of two significant villains from The Lightning Thief novel.

Occurring shortly after their run-in with Medusa in episode 3, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth battle Echidna and her monster child the Chimera in Percy Jackson episode 4. The immortal “Mother of All Monsters” unleashes the Chimera on Percy in the hopes of eliminating the demigod and the “dangers” he poses, leading her to menacingly chase the tweens around the Gateway Arch before sending Percy falling into the Mississippi River. However, this sequence played out much differently in the 2010 movie. Rather, Logan Lerman’s Percy battled a Hydra at the Parthenon replica in Tennessee, with this change proving controversial and less effective than the show’s version.





 Echidna &amp; Chimera&#39;s Terrifying Percy Jackson Episode 4 Story Proves They Would Have Worked In The Movies 
The movies didn&#39;t need to replace them with the Hydra
         

In a 2010 interview with Ain’t It Cool News, screenwriter Craig Titley revealed that the scene with the Chimera and Echidna was replaced because of how difficult it would be to translate the Chimera’s fearsome nature to the screen. Titley elaborated that making the Chimera’s complex lion-goat hybrid structure scary could come across as more humorous, so the decision was made to include the Hydra from The Sea of Monsters book for that moment instead. However, rather than following suit in Percy Jackson and the Olympians’ TV show, the series returned to the books’ version of events and proved how frightening Echidna and the Chimera could still be on the small screen compared to their page descriptions.

                  Percy Jackson And The Olympians Cast &amp; Character Guide   The cast of Percy Jackson and the Olympians for Disney&#43; includes a mix of rising talent and veteran actors to bring Rick Riordan&#39;s books to life.    




Suzanne Cryer’s performance as Echidna provides a compelling level of psychological terror for Percy in the TV show, making her even more villainous than her book counterpart. Additionally, Percy being poisoned by the Chimera and having its fire breathed at him gave him yet another horrifying brush with death against some of the most shocking monsters from Greek mythology. The monsters are both still terrifying in Percy Jackson season 1, episode 4, proving there was no need to replace them in The Lightning Thief movie. Furthermore, including Echidna and Chimera is a greater way to simultaneously give Percy a dangerous battle while expanding on the franchise’s mythology and lore.



 Why Rick Riordan Disliked The Percy Jackson Movie&#39;s Hydra Change 
The movies didn&#39;t follow Riordan&#39;s advice
          

Having penned the Percy Jackson book series, author Rick Riordan had strong opinions regarding the Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief movie. In a post on Riordan’s blog from 2018, the author shared a letter he wrote to the producers of the 2010 movie with his notes. One aspect of Riordan’s feedback focused on the Hydra change, with the author writing that “this scene is awful and completely alien to the story.” Riordan continued his note by suggesting it was changed because the St. Louis Arch may be difficult to replicate and the Hydra is more widely recognizable than the Chimera, though he pointed out that these adjustments would “lose the readers of the books.”




                  Percy Jackson Season 1 Episode 4 Recap: 6 Biggest Story Reveals   Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 furthered Percy’s quest to the Underworld and featured a handful of shocking story reveals in the process.    

Now, 14 years later, the TV show has proven Riordan correct in that the Hydra scene being changed for the 2010 Percy Jackson movie was unnecessary. As he predicted, it turned out to be a divisive change that both the author himself and many fans of the books disliked, with no real reason for it in the first place. Replacing the Chimera and Echidna seems to be far from Riordan’s biggest gripe with the movie adaptation, but his response was justified given how much better the TV show’s reception has been for this particular sequence. While the movie didn’t have to take Riordan’s advice, the TV show has been better off by taking his opinion on these important plot matters to heart.



 Percy Jackson Series&#39; Echidna Appearance Avoids An Even Bigger Movie Mistake 
The movies lost out on some important villain foreshadowing
          




By not repeating the movie’s erasure of Echidna and the Chimera, Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 is also avoiding a potential problem with its future story set-ups. Percy Jackson&#39;s Echidna appearance serves as a subtle early tease for a few other major villains, including her grandmother, Gaia, and husband, Typhon. Echidna’s presence as the Mother of All Monsters was an important precursor to Percy’s battles with these even more powerful foes, which the movies had lost by replacing her with the Hydra.

Of course, the Percy Jackson movie series from the 2010s would conclude with an adaptation of the second novel, The Sea of Monsters. Consequently, the set-up for Gaia and Typhon, who arrive much later, wasn’t entirely necessary in retrospect. Still, a full Percy Jackson movie series based on the novels was certainly expected, which means that subtle instances of foreshadowing would still have been important to include. With Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 already being a hit with critics and audiences, being faithful to Echidna and the Chimera’s sequence as well as prioritizing Riordan’s input makes the prospect of successful longevity for the TV show all the more likely.
