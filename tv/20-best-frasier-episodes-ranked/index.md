## Literature Review
Frasier has been gracing screens since 1993 with plenty of comedy and heartfelt moments, but only 20 episodes are considered to be the best.




Frasier has been on television screens since 1993, with plenty of funny moments and sexual innuendo, but some episodes stand out as the best. Throughout its 11-season run, Frasier has won over 100 awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1996 and two Golden Globes. From a romantic tango in season 3 to getting stuck in a ski lodge with plenty of sexual farce, there is no shortage of comedy or heartrending moments in Frasier. The show has also boasted plenty of celebrity guest stars over the years, thanks in part to Frasier&#39;s role as a radio psychiatrist.
The show is a spinoff of the 1982 show Cheers, and it continues the misadventures of Dr. Frasier Crane as he adjusts to his new life in Seattle after he moves from Boston. As the host of a radio show, Frasier gives out wise advice to his viewers about their problems, but often struggles with his own familial issues, especially with his brother Niles and his father, Martin. Along for the ride are Roz, the producer of the radio show that Frasier is host of, and Daphne, Martin&#39;s live-in caregiver. With plenty of humor, heartrending moments, and classic farce, the bestepisodes of Frasier still hold up.









 








 20  Moon Dance (season 3, episode 13) 
Niles tries dating again with a tango


 







This 1996 episode opened the door for sparks to fly further for Niles and Daphne after Niles gets divorced from the never-seen Maris. Needing a date for a country club dance and not wanting to embarrass himself, Niles immediately turns to Daphne for dance lessons after realizing he can&#39;t dance. After hours of practicing at home, the two end up dancing a very romantic tango, complete with a kiss. While Daphne does unintentionally end up breaking Niles&#39; heart by telling him he is a good actor, it is a powerful episode that proves that Daphne and Niles have the potential to be a great couple.
            
 
 Every Woman Niles Dated In Frasier (Before Daphne) 
After divorcing Maris, Niles Crane faces the turbulence of the dating world several times before marrying Daphne - here is every woman he dated.









 19  Travels with Martin (season 1, episode 21) 
Martin, Niles, Daphne, and Frasier go on an accidental road trip to Canada
        

Traveling with the family can be an adventure, but when Frasier&#39;s family is involved, hilarity often ensues. When Frasier&#39;s hope of going on a luxury spa trip is dashed, he ends up in an RV with the rest of the family and Daphne. This ends up causing trouble when the group gets to Canada and Daphne&#39;s citizenship is called into question. According to John Mahoney, this was his favorite episode of Frasier to film and it is funny to watch the Crane family try to get through the trip without killing each other.





 18  The Innkeepers (season 2, episode 23) 
Frasier buys a restaurant
        

When Frasier&#39;s and Niles&#39;s favorite restaurant is on the verge of being closed down, they do what anyone would do and immediately buy the restaurant. In true Frasier style with plenty of farce, everything goes wrong during the opening night service. The whole family tries to pitch in to help with disastrous results just in time for a critic to make an appearance. Frasier often uses disasters during episodes, which often works in the show&#39;s favor. It definitely works for this episode as it keeps to the humor that makes the show unique.





 17  Momma Mia (season 7, episode 1) 
Frasier dates a woman who looks like his mother
        

Frasier&#39;s mother Hester died long before the start of the series, but audiences heard plenty about her in mentions and flashbacks. When Frasier begins to date a woman named Mia who looks exactly like his mother, his family are beyond surprised. Most of the episode is spent with the characters focusing in on this one plot point, but it still has an impact as audiences learn more about Hester. While it is still fun to watch and doesn&#39;t lose any of the magic, knowing that Rita Wilson plays both Mia and Hester is a bit creepy.





 16  Rooms With a View (Season 10, Episode 8) 
Niles&#39; surgery leaves room for contemplation
        

This episode is higher up, not because of the comedy, but because it focuses primarily on the more serious aspect of having a relative in the hospital. Niles ends up having bypass surgery, leaving a nervous family in his wake as they wait anxiously for news and reflect on their own hospital experiences. While it does have some funny moments, the audience can&#39;t help but feel anxious alongside the family, even though repeat viewers know that Niles is okay. The episode also does a good job of showcasing the love that the Frasier brothers have for each other, which is why the episode has earned a place on this list.





 15  The Seal Who Came to Dinner (season 6, episode 8) 
Slapstick/physical humor on the cusp of an award
        

Season 6, episode 8 &#34;The Seal Who Came to Dinner&#34; uses plenty of slapstick comedy and physical humor. In the story, Niles must host a party for his fellow club members at Maris&#39; beach house and get rid of a smelly, dead seal that keeps washing ashore at the wrong moments. While slapstick humor is not unheard of in Frasier&#39;s plotlines, it is used effectively in this episode, and it works well for the storyline. Both Grammer&#39;s and Hyde Pierce&#39;s acting in this episode is superb, and they complement each other well with their use of slapstick.





 14  Roz and the Schnoz (season 5, episode 2) 
Roz meets Rick’s parents
        

Roz Doyle is known for many things in Frasier, especially her hypersexuality. When she gets pregnant due to a one-night stand with a college student, Roz&#39;s focus is now on the impending birth of her child. When Roz meets the parents of her baby&#39;s father, she is shocked to notice their extremely large noses or &#34;two giant schnauzers&#34; and becomes worried that her baby will have that characteristic. While the episode focuses most of the comedy on this one joke, it is nonetheless funny and executes good use of plot devices to keep the characters&#39; storyline fresh.

Roz spent much of her time on Frasier coming up with witty remarks that were usually steeped in sarcasm, making for some great quotes.









 13  Ham Radio (Season 4, Episode 18) 
The station celebrates 50 years
        

In this episode, the station celebrates over 50 years of being on the air with a live murder mystery show written and directed by control freak Frasier that quickly goes wrong. Niles ends up getting assigned multiple roles at once, at the expense of Frasier&#39;s ego. Despite it being one of the funnier episodes, the episode&#39;s comedy routines are all over the place, and it is often known as a confusing episode among fans. But this episode can be seen as making fun of Frasier&#39;s officious nature and love of order.





 12  Death and the Dog (season 4, episode 12) 
Eddie sees a dog psychiatrist
        

Eddie the dog is everything to Martin Crane, much to Frasier&#39;s annoyance, as the dog often ruffles Frasier&#39;s feathers. In this episode, Eddie is in a funk despite Martin&#39;s attempts to cheer him up and eventually, Martin has to call in a dog psychiatrist. Audiences see some of the show from Eddie&#39;s point of view and eventually understand what is bothering him. Despite this episode being a bit on the strange side, the episode is a good one and helps audiences understand that even dogs have the potential to be comedy gold.





 11  An Affair to Forget (season 2, episode 21) 
Maris has an affair


 







As the unseen, never heard wife, Maris&#39; existence has been the subject of debate throughout the entirety of Frasier. In this season 2 episode, Frasier helps out one of his radio show listeners with her worries over her fencing instructor husband having an affair with one of his students, who turns out to be Maris. In the ultimate showdown, Niles fights for his marriage via fencing and vows to win Maris back no matter what. While Maris has never been seen on the show, this episode gives a good insight into Niles&#39; troubled marriage.





 10  Halloween (season 5, episode 3) 
Roz learns she&#39;s pregnant
        

Roz&#39;s adventures as a parent start out in season 5, episode 3 &#34;Halloween&#34;, as she learns that she may be pregnant. In true Frasier fashion, the theme of miscommunication comedy is present throughout the entire episode as Niles throws a Halloween costume party. Thanks to an impromptu moment of telephone, it&#39;s not too long before everyone at the party becomes aware of what is going on. This episode is not only funny, but also a step forward, since having a storyline about a single mother was rare at the time (via Collider).





 9  “A Lilith Thanksgiving” (Season 4, Episode 7) 
Lilith comes for a visit
        

Bebe Neuwirth&#39;s character Lilith has been a frequent visitor in Frasier over the years, but this episode is one of the best ones out there. In the Frasier Thanksgiving holiday episode, Frasier flies out to Boston to help Lilith get their son Freddy into a fancy prep school run by the snobbish headmaster. This is the first time that audiences have seen Trevor Einhorn as Frasier&#39;s son, Freddy. It is an episode with plenty of heart and comedy, showing that not all the Frasier episodes need to be in Seattle for it to be funny.





 8  The Return of Martin Crane (Season 9, Episode 4) 
Martin goes back to work
        

Martin Crane puts up with a lot on Frasier, whether it&#39;s acting as a peacemaker between his two sons or spouting sarcastic jokes. This episode, albeit with plenty of good humor to keep it funny, is one of the more serious episodes of the series. It focuses on Martin&#39;s return to work as a security guard. While everyone focuses on who will take care of Eddie, Martin struggles with reminders of why he had to leave the police force in the first place. This episode is a good balance of funny and heartwarming, as audiences can see just how much Martin has had to give up.





 7  Author, Author (season 1, episode 22) 
Niles vs. Frasier
        

Niles and Frasier have a very tempestuous relationship, but this episode proves to be the best of their relationship. When the two brothers join together to write a book, it nearly starts up a war and brings attention to their different personalities. Audiences also see how the brothers use different approaches when it comes to psychiatry, making it a strong episode with comedic undertones. Frasier&#39;s relationship with his brother has been a long-running plotline in the show and this early episode really helps it shine.





 6  The Good Son (season 1, episode 1) 
Frasier moves to Seattle
        

In the first episode of Frasier, audiences see Frasier move to Seattle and get used to having his father back in his life. Audiences who watched Cheers get to enjoy seeing Frasier again, this time front and center, not on the side. It is a good start to the show, with lots of funny moments and a good chance to see Frasier&#39;s new life in Seattle. The pilot episode helps scratch the surface, introducing characters and locations that soon become an important part of Frasier&#39;s new life. For old fans of Cheers and those who are watching the show for the first time, it is a good episode to watch.





 5  The Two Mrs. Cranes (Season 4, Episode 1) 
Niles and Daphne pretend to be a couple
        

In an early Frasier episode that began to tease the possibility of Niles and Daphne, this episode is another classic and a must-watch for any first-time viewer. In the season 4 premiere, Daphne asks Niles to pretend to be her husband after her ex-fiancée Clive comes to visit from England. To help with the charade, Frasier pretends to be married to Maris, who is Roz. Once again, audiences get a snippet of what Niles and Daphne could be like as a couple. This episode demonstrates Frasier&#39;s aptitude for the comedy of miscommunication and errors, resulting in one of the funniest episodes ever.





 4  The Guilt Trippers (Season 9, Episode 23) 
Frasier and Roz sleep together
        

Roz and Frasier have been coworkers and friends for years, often confiding in each other when things go wrong with their personal lives. When Frasier attempts to comfort Roz after her latest romantic failure, it ends with the two of them sleeping together. As a result, Frasier examines his relationship with Roz and what it means to their friendship. The writers do a good job of showing the audience why this relationship would not work and make it a powerful reminder of why there is nothing wrong with being friends with someone.





 3  Something Borrowed, Someone Blue (Part 1&#43;2) (season 7, episode 23-24) 
Niles and Daphne finally kiss
        

After many seasons of will-they, won&#39;t they, audiences were delighted to finally see Niles and Daphne kiss in season 7&#39;s two-parter finale. During wedding prep, Daphne finally realizes that she is beginning to fall in love with Niles at last, eventually running off with him at the end of the two-parter. While peppered with plenty of funny moments, this is an episode that shows the serious side of Daphne and Niles&#39; relationship and gives fans of the couple much-needed relief as the two finally admit their feelings for each other.





 2  Goodnight, Seattle (season 11 episodes 23&#43;24) 
Frasier leaves Seattle to be with Charlotte/Daphne gives birth
        

It may be the series finale, but it is one of the most powerful episodes ever as the characters move on with their lives. The episode ends with Frasier reading &#34;Ulysses&#34; by Alfred Lord Tennyson and Frasier moving to Chicago to go after the woman he loves. This episode also shows the birth of Daphne and Niles&#39; son David, named after Frasier co-creator David Angell, and Martin marrying girlfriend Ronee. There are plenty of good moments, making it a favorite among fans. This episode also teaches the importance of how all good things must come to an end or in Frasier&#39;s case, move on to find something better.







 1  The Ski Lodge (Season 5, Episode 14) 
A trip up to the ski lodge


 







Considered to be the best episode of season 5 and the entire show, &#34;The Ski Lodge&#34; is one of the funniest Frasier episodes ever. The episode sees the Crane family, Daphne, and one of Daphne&#39;s friends going on a winter vacation that a pregnant Roz gives Frasier in exchange for a free television. Frasier writer Joe Keenan got an Emmy nomination for this episode, and it is considered to be one of the best sex farces seen on the show. With plenty of funny moments, including Frasier walking in on James Patrick Stuart&#39;s character Guy, it truly defines the show and gives it bite.
