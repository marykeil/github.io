  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Vanderpump Rules season 11 picks up close to where we left off, with Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval&rsquo;s scandalous breakup still playing a major player.</p>
<p>Vanderpump Rules season 11 is back and bringing the cast of the series into the limelight after the fallout of the Scandoval drama has changed absolutely everything for them. With Ariana Madix and Katie Maloney front and center during the Vanderpump Rules season 11 opening credits, the series made it clear that the story of the season would revolve around the women rebuilding their empire without their exes. While Tom Sandoval wasn’t featured in the season’s opener, the rest of the cast was quick to share how they’ve been doing in the months since Vanderpump Rules season 10’s finale, which made it clear Scandoval would include picking sides.</p>
<p>With a decade on the air, Vanderpump Rules has been long-held as the gold standard for Bravo, but after changes in the cast, some were wondering if the show’s last season would be its final. Originally focused on the divorce between Katie and Tom Schwartz, who were together for 12 years before divorcing in 2022, Vanderpump Rules season 10 changed direction when it was discovered that Tom Sandoval had cheated on Ariana with Raquel Leviss. Becoming a major part of the cultural conversation, there are more than just long-time viewers coming to Vanderpump Rules season 11 to see what’s next.</p>

<p>Tom &amp; Ariana Still Live Together Despite Having No Contact
Ariana Communicates Through Tom’s Assistant</p>
<p>After months away from Valley Village, Tom and Ariana’s shared home is the first stop for Vanderpump Rules season 11. While Tom isn’t featured in the episode until the final moments, his presence is felt throughout the opening moments especially. Ariana, who shared that she and Tom are still living together despite their dramatic split, explained that though she and Tom are still cohabitating, she makes a point of avoiding all contact with him. Tom, who was filming Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test season 2 at the time, has been giving Ariana a difficult time about moving out of the house, or finding a way for them to split it.</p>
<p>Ariana Shared She Believes Tom &amp; Raquel Are Still Together
She Updated Viewers On Their Relationship Status</p>
<p>Although Ariana hasn’t been in contact with Tom or Raquel, who left Vanderpump Rules after appearing on the series for several years, she shared some insight into their relationship. With Ariana and Tom still living under the same roof, Ariana’s been privy to his mail and deliveries, especially while he&rsquo;s been out of the house. She shared that while she has no real insight into the relationship, she believes Tom and Raquel are still together due to the mail she’s seen come from Raquel at her mental health facility in Arizona. At the time of filming, it appeared likely the pair were still trying a relationship.</p>
<p>Scheana Offered Support To Tom After His Friend Ali Passed
Tom Blocked Her Number After Seeing The Messages</p>
<p>Early on in the Vanderpump Rules season 11 premiere, Scheana Shay and her husband, Brock Davies, are shown with their daughter, Summer Moon. Scheana and Brock eventually sit down to chat about what’s been happening in their friend group, and Scheana shared that after Tom’s close childhood friend Ali died, she reached out to her former friend to offer support. While she wasn’t sure what she would’ve said if he’d responded, she wanted to extend an olive branch after losing someone so close to him. Scheana revealed that after texting Tom, she found out that he’d blocked her number and then blocked her on all social media, as well.</p>
<p>Lala Shared She&rsquo;s Been Skeptical Of Everything Due To Past Trauma
She’s Hoping To Put A New Foot Forward</p>
<p>After everything that’s happened with Lala Kent and her ex-fiance, Randall Emmett, in the last several years, it’s not surprising that Lala’s been dealing with some trauma cropping up in her everyday life. Sharing that in the months since Scandoval she’s taken a look at the way she wants to live and has brought her mother and brother to live with her in Los Angeles, Lala shared that she wants to try to move past the trauma she’s dealt with. While she’s working her way through it, Lala shared she’s been having a hard time not feeling skeptical of everything and everyone.</p>
<p>Tom Schwartz Feels Alienated By The Rest Of The Group
He Shared He Feels Scorned By Tom Sandoval</p>
<p>While Tom Sandoval’s actions have hurt everyone in the group, they’ve hurt Ariana and Tom Schwartz the most. As one of the closest duos on the series, Tom and Tom have a history that’s spanned through decades. With their personal and professional lives wrapped up in one another, Tom Schwartz took a major hit when Scandoval hit airwaves. Tom shared that not only did the pair’s business, Schwartz &amp; Sandy’s, take a massive hit due to Tom’s behavior, but Tom Schwartz’s personal life became unmanageable as he had to learn who in the friend group he was able to talk to, and who was icing him out.</p>
<p>Ariana Revealed Details About Her New Boyfriend, Dan
Her Relationship Was An Interesting Turn Of Events</p>
<p>Although Tom and Ariana’s breakup was only months prior during the Vanderpump Rules season 11 premiere, the latter introduced her new boyfriend over FaceTime in the episode. Ariana explains that she met her new man, Daniel Wai, at a mutual friend’s wedding and has found him to be an incredible source of strength in a difficult time. She shared that though Dan lives in New York, he’s been traveling out to visit her whenever possible, and the pair has been happily getting to know one another despite the fact that she was still dealing with her long-term ex in every aspect of her life.</p>
<p>The Group Met Up At TomTom &amp; Ariana Relived Tough Memories
TomTom Was A Special Place</p>
<p>Although Ariana was skeptical about going to the bar her ex opened with Tom Schwartz and Lisa Vanderpump, she knew that she wouldn’t be seeing Tom Sandoval there and decided to make the best of a tough situation. While the rest of the group wasn’t quite so nervous, they were excited to see James Kennedy DJ at the club and support Ariana to find her renewed strength. While Ariana was happy to be surrounded by her friends, she did have a few moments of difficulty while at TomTom, explaining that it was difficult to be back somewhere that something so traumatic had taken place just months earlier.</p>
<p>Tom Schwartz Tried To Reintegrate Himself Into The Group Unsuccessfully
He Missed His Relationship With Ariana</p>
<p>Although Tom realized that his relationship with Ariana was already damaged, he was hopeful that he would be able to reintegrate himself into their friend group, even for a night. At TomTom, he did his best to make himself available to Ariana and the rest of the group, but he was iced out and found himself being pushed away time and time again. Tom, unhappy with his progress, shared he was feeling left out with one of the bartenders at the club. He explained that though he understood Ariana being hurt by him, he wanted to make things right and prove he could be there for her.</p>
<p>Lala Felt Empathy Towards Raquel And Reached Out
After Being Hard On Raquel, Lala Felt Bad</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Lala was probably the most harsh with Raquel during the fallout of Scandoval, she shared that during her own scandalous relationship with her ex-fiance, she had felt the weight of the world calling her some terrible things. Lala shared that wearing the badge of “homewrecker” had hurt her tremendously, and she didn’t want Raquel to also have to deal with the stigma that surrounded relationships like hers with Tom, regardless of the fact that she didn’t condone it. Lala chose to reach out to Raquel over a voice message, explaining she’d love to talk sometime if Raquel would be open to it.</p>
<p>Ariana, Scheana, &amp; Katie Weren&rsquo;t Happy With Lala&rsquo;s Decision
The Group Wasn’t Thrilled About Reaching Out To Raquel</p>
<p>Ariana, Scheana, Katie, and Lala went out for a girl&rsquo;s night, feeling they needed to reconnect after the drama from Scandoval had died down. Despite knowing that Ariana would have difficulty with the decision, Lala shared she’d reached out to Raquel and was open to talking with their former friend. Though Ariana was surprised, she explained that Lala was an adult who could make her own decisions, and though she wasn’t happy with the idea, she couldn’t stop her. With a moment of Tom finally getting back to his and Ariana’s house at the end of the episode, the drama on Vanderpump Rules seems to only be getting started.</p>
<p>Vanderpump Rules airs at 8 p.m. Tuesdays on Bravo, and streams the following day on Peacock.</p>
