  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Watcher miniseries mixes elements of true story and fiction, adding drama and intrigue to the real-life events surrounding the Broaddus family.   The letters sent by The Watcher to the Broaddus family were eerie and threatening, mentioning the history of the house and warning against renovation.   The Broaddus family took legal action against the previous owners of the house, who failed to disclose the threatening letters they also received from The Watcher.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Watcher case is a curious one, but what the real true story of 657 Boulevard and what did Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s popular Netflix series change?</p>
<p>This article contains discussion surrounding real-life crimes that include stalking and murder.</p>
<p>The Watcher true story is stranger than any fiction a writer could dream up. Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s 2022 Netflix miniseries chronicles a stalker who threatens a family after they move to a new home. The foundation of The Watcher&rsquo;s storyline is the mysterious real-life events that unfolded around the Broaddus family — changed to Brannock in the show — when they purchased a suburban New Jersey home at 657 Boulevard. However, to add more heft to the true story&rsquo;s intrigue, the show stretches reality, and as a result, The Watcher is a mix of true story and pure fiction.</p>
<p>When it comes to The Watcher&rsquo;s portrayal of the titular perpetrator, the show is spot-on about their shocking letters and negative impact on the family. The Watcher dips its feet into fiction when it draws parallels between The Watcher case and a forgotten crime that haunted 657 Boulevard&rsquo;s neighborhood. Its storyline becomes even less believable — although arguably more interesting — when it reveals a labyrinth of empty tunnels existing below 657 Boulevard. There are also a few elements in the storyline that are hard to believe but are based on the experiences of the Broaddus family.</p>
<pre><code>              Best True Crime Shows On Netflix Right Now   From seasoned favorites to new hits and hidden gems, here’s a rundown of the best Netflix true crime shows fans of the genre can stream.    
</code></pre>
<p>The Real Location Of The Watcher House Explained
The True Crime Took Place In New Jersey</p>
<p>As portrayed in Netflix&rsquo;s The Watcher, the location of the house is 657 Boulevard in Westfield, New Jersey. However, instead of using the original location&rsquo;s zip code (07090), the series changes it to 11537. Netflix&rsquo;s The Watcher accurately shows that Derek and Maria Broaddus, whose names are changed to Dean and Nora Brannock in the show, bought the house for $1.36 million but were never informed about letters in the Watcher case by the previous owners. Through John Graff&rsquo;s story arc, the Netflix true-crime series draws references to a real family murder, which shook the otherwise idyllic community.</p>
<p>The crime happened in November 1971, when Westfield resident John List killed his wife, mother, and three children before going into hiding (via ABC News). The series takes creative liberties with its depiction of the actual home&rsquo;s layout from The Watcher true story. To add layers of drama to an otherwise simple true tale, the series shows an underground passageway beneath the property that did not exist in the real home. In addition, the filming location for the Netflix series is also relatively bigger than the original home and located in Rye, New York, instead of Westfield, New Jersey.</p>
<pre><code>              The Watcher Cast &amp; Character Guide   In its seven-episode runtime, Netflix's The Watcher features a roster of characters, with Naomi Watts and Bobby Cannavale playing the leading roles.    
</code></pre>
<p>The Real Letters Of The Watcher Case Explained
The Mysterious Letters Are Even More Chilling In Real Life</p>
<p>The real perpetrator in The Watcher true story initially wrote three letters to Maria and Derek Broaddus (played in the cast of The Watcher by Naomi Watts and Bobby Cannavale). The first one reached them soon after they bought the property in June 2014 and was addressed to &ldquo;The New Owner.&rdquo; Although the letter started on a warm note by welcoming the family to their new neighborhood, it drifted into a threatening tone as it progressed. The Watcher case was heavily reported on after the fact, and many of the specific details surfaced.</p>
<p>The letters to the real-life Broaddus family that The Watcher is based on were the subject of analysis, and featured eerie messages (via The Cut):</p>
<p>&ldquo;657 Boulevard has been the subject of my family for decades now and as it approaches its 110th birthday, I have been put in charge of watching and waiting for its second coming. My grandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched in the 1960s. It is now my time. Do you know the history of the house? Do you know what lies within the walls of 657 Boulevard? Why are you here? I will find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s TV series accurately depicts, the Watcher also warns them that renovating the house and destroying its heritage will make &ldquo;657 Boulevard unhappy&rdquo; and claims that they would lure the Broadduses&rsquo; three children to them. The second letter reaches the family a few weeks after the first and is followed by the third a month later. There is also a fourth letter, which arrived three years after the third one. However, it was presumably a copycat&rsquo;s work because of its angrier tone and relatively different writing style.</p>
<pre><code>              Everything We Know About The Watcher Season 2   Ryan Murphy's latest true crime thriller ended on a cliffhanger and left audiences wanting more. Here are all the updates on The Watcher Season 2.    
</code></pre>
<p>Why Did The Broaddus Family Sue The Previous Owners Of The Watcher House?
The Woods Family Knew About The Watcher</p>
<p>John and Andrea Woods, the previous owners of the house, also received a threatening letter from The Watcher. However, they did not disclose this to the Broaddus family before selling them the home. Consequently, one year after the new family bought the house, they decided to take legal action against the Woods by filing a complaint. While at it, they tried their best to avoid the media&rsquo;s involvement in the story, but one reporter found out about the house and triggered the chain reaction that made The Watcher true story go viral.</p>
<p>The Broadduses Did Not Initially Tell Their Children About The Letters In The Watcher True Story
Derek And Maria Tried To Keep Their Kids Safe Through Hiding The Truth</p>
<p>Dean and Nora&rsquo;s children Elie (Isabel Gravitt) and Cater (Luke David Blumm) learn about the Watcher case letters from the beginning of the Netflix adaptation. However, the real parents, Derek and Maria, kept their children in the dark for a long time before telling them about the house and the letters. Only when their dire situation garnered the media&rsquo;s attention did they decide to tell their three children about the Watcher and their strange letters. For the sake of the miniseries, it engaged two additional characters, but The Watcher true story was somewhat simpler.</p>
<pre><code>              Who Was The Watcher? Every Theory &amp; Update   The Netflix series The Watcher is an atypical crime drama that ends ambiguously. Here are the most likely suspects and theories from the show.    
</code></pre>
<p>Did The Broadduses Actually Suspect Their Neighbors?
The Local Community Is Incredibly Suspicious In The Watcher</p>
<p>As seen in the popular 2022 Netflix original series, the family&rsquo;s quirky neighbors are among the many prime suspects. There are also a few altercations between the Broaddus family and the old couple that live across from their home. However, none of these conflicts are as aggressive as the ones depicted in The Watcher. The first letter also addresses the Broadduses as &ldquo;Dearest new neighbor at 657 Boulevard,&rdquo; which suggests The Watcher was either intentionally leading them to believe they are their neighbor or subtly implying that they live in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Watcher also seems to know many intricate details about the family, including their kids&rsquo; names and birth order. In one letter, the Watcher also asks if the Broadduses&rsquo; daughter is &ldquo;the artist of the family&rdquo; after she is likely seen using an easel on the home&rsquo;s porch. While all these pieces of evidence suggest the perpetrator resides near the Broadduses, no neighbor is ever proven to be the culprit in the Watcher case.</p>
<pre><code>              Why True Crime Show Fans Should Watch More Documentaries   Dramatic true crime shows like The Girl from Plainville may reach a wider audience. But their documentary counterparts offer more in their details.   
</code></pre>
<p>Did The Real Broadduses Report The Watcher To The Police?
The Brannocks Tried To Get Help From The Authorities</p>
<p>In The Watcher true story the real-life Brannock couple reported the disturbing letters to the police. During the investigation, Detective Leonard Lugo interviewed their neighbors but found no evidence to prosecute them for the letters. In addition, the family also took help from a private investigator and contacted two FBI agents to find the identity of the Watcher. To their disappointment, even after meticulous investigation, The Watcher&rsquo;s real identity remained a mystery.</p>
<pre><code>              The Watcher Causing Spike In Nightmares &amp; Sleepless Nights For Netflix Users   Netflix has conducted a psychology study that shows a significant increase in nightmares and difficulty sleeping for The Watcher viewers.   
</code></pre>
<p>What Did The DNA Reveal In The Real Watcher Case?
No Neighbors Matched The Samples On The Letters</p>
<p>The Watcher&rsquo;s case was appointed to the Union County Prosecutor’s Office, which led to some intriguing developments. A DNA test revealed that a woman had licked the envelope on the Watcher&rsquo;s letters, and taking this as a cue, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office collected DNA samples from the neighborhood but found no matches.</p>
<p>Maria and Derek even tried convincing the investigators to compare the DNA with ancestry databases, but the prosecutor&rsquo;s office refused. In 2020, the Broadduses took matters into their own hands by asking the prosecutor&rsquo;s office to shut the case and hand over evidence. Unfortunately, the office declined, and the mystery surrounding the Watcher case remained unsolved (via The Cut).</p>
<p>The Broadduses Never Really Moved To The Watcher House
The Biggest Change The Show Made To The Real Story</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest difference between The Watcher true story and the series is that the Broaddus family never lived in the house. Realizing the danger, they lived with Maria&rsquo;s parents while their home remained empty. Six months after the Watcher&rsquo;s first letter, they tried selling the home but failed to do so after potential buyers learned about the case. In July 2019, the Broadduses finally sold the house for $959,000 (via CNN), a hefty financial loss for the family. Luckily, selling rights to Netflix for The Watcher series helped recoup losses and let them have some say in their story.</p>
