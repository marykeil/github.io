## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 &#39;s Kimberly Rochelle and TJ Goswami had a blowout fight in the finale. Are they still together and married?




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Kimberly Rochelle and Tejaswi Goswami, AKA TJ, could be getting divorced soon if Kimberly’s social media posts are any indication. Kimberly arrived in India from Alabama in season 5 of the spin-off. Kimberly had lived in Jaipur for a year on a student visa before she moved there to marry TJ. However, she couldn’t adjust to TJ’s family’s rules since Kimberly had to stay with them as a dutiful daughter-in-law. TJ did not tell Kimberly that she was supposed to do the cooking and cleaning, while some of their rituals freaked Kimberly out.




Kimberly and TJ were about to break up right before their wedding day, but they reconciled and went through the ceremony. Kimberly and TJ’s honeymoon period was a disaster as she was left spending her time alone in the house for three months when TJ was out working. Her not knowing the Hindi language prevented Kimberly from venturing outside. She claimed she was depressed and wished TJ could comfort her, but, instead, he asked her to go back to the U.S. The finale showed Kimberly reaching her breaking point, and it looks like she and TJ broke up after filming it.
