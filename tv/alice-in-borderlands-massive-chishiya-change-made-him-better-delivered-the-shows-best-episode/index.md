## Literature Review
Netflix’s Alice in Borderland made some changes to Chishiya’s character compared to the manga, and the result could not have been better for the show.




Alice in Borderland made some significant changes to Chishiya compared to the manga, and these changes arguably improved the character and set up the show’s best episode. Haro Aso’s Alice in Borderland manga resulted in one of the most successful Netflix live-action adaptations, and while the source material is great, some aspects of the show are equally good or even better. Interestingly, now that the manga has been covered in its entirety, Alice in Borderland season 3 will have to be an original story, leaving little room for comparisons between the show and the source material.




Although some aspects of Alice in Borderland match the manga perfectly, others are very different. For example, Alice in Borderland season 2’s ending included the Joker card as a cliffhanger, which does not happen in the manga. There are also differences in terms of character development, as seen with Chishiya.


 How Alice In Borderland’s Chishiya Is Different From His Manga Counterpart 
          

Netflix’s version of Chishiya may not be the most loveable and charismatic character, but his Alice in Borderland manga counterpart is even less likable. Whereas live-action Alice in Borderland&#39;s Chishiya is more of an introverted character who hides his emotions and tries to use logic first and foremost, manga Chishiya comes off as someone who genuinely does not care about others. Netflix’s Alice in Borderland portrays Chishiya as an anti-hero, someone whom Arisu should never fully trust, yet he is far from being a villain or a major threat to others. The same cannot be said about Chishiya in the manga.




In the source material, Chishiya even compares himself to Niragi, one of Alice in Borderland’s most despicable villains. The friendship between Chishiya and Kuina in Alice in Borderland, which resulted in a lot of wholesome moments in the show, is an example of how different the live-action interpretation of the character is from the manga. The biggest difference between the two iterations of the character, however, comes from their backstories as doctors. Whereas Netflix’s Chishiya slowly lost his humanity while working for a corrupt hospital, manga Chishiya was a heartless doctor who never really cared about his patients. Although Netflix kept the essence of Chishiya from the manga, they are very different characters.



 The Best Alice In Borderland Game Didn’t Include Chishiya In The Manga 
         

Alice in Borderland’s Jack of Hearts game, also known as Solitary Confinement, did not feature Chishiya in the manga. This can be very surprising for those not familiar with the source material considering how great of an episode Netflix’s version of the game, which focused entirely on Chishiya, was. In theory, Chishiya is not suitable for Hearts games, as he does not have any attachments and would not care about having to sacrifice someone he knows. However, by putting Chishiya in one of the manga’s most interesting games of Hearts, Netflix’s Alice in Borderland combined the best of both worlds.





 

The only way to beat the Jack of Hearts was to know when to trust someone and when not to, which, in hindsight, is a perfect game for Chishiya. On one hand, it allowed the character to use his cynicism and cold personality to his advantage – Chishiya never got scared or anxious during the Jack of Hearts. On the other hand, it made it so that Chishiya had to leave his comfort zone and momentarily bond with others to survive. Ironically, had Chishiya entered the Solitary Confinement game with Kuina or even Arisu and Usagi, he would have had no problem beating it.



Alice in Borderland&#39;s Jack of Hearts game happens mostly in season 2, episode 3, but it is concluded in episode 4.









 Alice in Borderland’s Chishiya Change Made His Redemption Better 
          

By making Chishiya a little more sympathetic than his manga counterpart, Alice in Borderland made the character’s eventual redemption in the King of Diamonds game better. Even though redeeming a more flawed person can work better, the manga’s version of Chishiya might have never connected with audiences the same way Nijiro Murakami’s character did. Live-action Chishiya clearly had redeemable qualities from the start, meaning his change of attitude by the end of season 2 does not feel too abrupt. The mistakes Chishiya made in the real world also feel more tragic on the show, as he originally wanted to be an empathetic doctor but gave in to a corrupt system.

                  Alice In Borderland&#39;s Cast &amp; Character Guide   From Arisu and Usagi to Kuina and Chishiya, Alice in Borderland’s cast includes a lot of fan-favorite characters, all played by great actors.    




Alice in Borderland is returning for season 3, which creates an interesting challenge for how the show will handle Chishiya going forward. Assuming he will be on season 3, Alice in Borderland will have to find a way to keep Chishiya compelling without reversing his character development. What made Chishiya so successful is how different he is from the show’s heroes, namely Arisu and Usagi, which is something season 3 cannot lose track of. That said, Chishiya now values his life and the lives of others more than he did at the beginning of the show, and this important evolution must be portrayed in season 3.
