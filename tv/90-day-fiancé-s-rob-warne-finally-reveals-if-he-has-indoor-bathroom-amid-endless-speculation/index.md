## Literature Review
Rob Warne shows off his well-lit indoor bathroom in response to critics who called out his questionable living situation in 90 Day Fiancé season 10.




Rob Warne from 90 Day Fiancé season 10 shut down critics by unveiling his new indoor bathroom on Instagram. The 32-year-old reality star received massive criticism when he invited his British girlfriend, Sophie Sierra, to the United States and took her to his bathroom-less apartment. The Los Angeles native didn’t think twice before forcing his girlfriend to live in less-than-ideal conditions and undermining her concerns. In a recent episode of 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Rob left a bad impression on Sophie’s mom, Claire, who felt he wasn’t ready to marry her daughter. Claire is concerned that her future son-in-law isn’t financially stable.




Rob&#39;s living situation has been widely criticized, but that has seemingly all come to an end. Recently, Rob took to social media and revealed that he’s finally living in a place with an attached bathroom.


 

The new 90 Day Fiancé cast member posted an Instagram Story in which he said (via @realitytvgurl), “This is my bathroom,” while showing his followers a glimpse at the white walls, wooden door, and mirror lights. He added, “indoor bathroom life,” stating that this video was for “all those people” who keep asking about the same or calling him cheap.

 Rob Warne&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Living Situation Explained 
          

The outdoor bathroom drama began when Sophie arrived at Rob’s house in Los Angeles. She found it absurd that her man didn’t have an indoor bathroom and asked him to do something about it. Unfortunately, Rob didn’t take her very seriously or value her concerns. Instead, he tried to gaslight her into thinking she was making an unusual demand. In one particular 90 Day Fiancé season 10 scene, Sophie looked disappointed while doing her makeup in bad lighting in the outdoor bathroom. Eventually, Sophie left Rob’s house and found a separate place of her own. In the next episode, she returned to Rob’s apartment.

It seems Rob finally has a better place to live with a flashy indoor bathroom. However, it goes without saying that he should’ve had this kind of apartment before he asked his 23-year-old girlfriend to move in with him. Rob should’ve focused on building a stable career in his mid-20&#39;s instead of wasting those years. He should’ve invested his time into something worthwhile. He should’ve learned something from Sophie, who has worked hard to earn her money. While she belongs to a wealthy family, she hasn’t let that stop her from finding and committing to work.




Rob may have found a job to get himself his new apartment. However, it’s also possible that he’s still not financially stable and has merely used the reality TV money to upgrade himself. Rob’s pictures and videos don’t show him discussing any new career or job. Instead, his last Instagram Story was about his hair and how he hadn’t groomed himself in a while. There’s also a small possibility that Rob has cut back on any additional expenses to ensure that he has enough savings for other things. The 90 Day Fiancé season 10 star previously posted that he has only been eating ramen every day.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
