## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s winner, Jag Bains, made inappropriate comments about women while on the show. Is his apology for the jokes he&#39;s made genuine?




Big Brother season 25 winner Jag Bains has been relishing his win for the last week but has taken time to reflect and apologize for some of the off-color jokes he made during the game. The longest season of Big Brother to date was a grueling 100-day strategic, social competition that came down to Jag and his long-time ally Matt Klotz sitting next to each other in the final two chairs. Jag and Matt were loyal to one another throughout the game, but ultimately, the jury of 7 chose to select Jag as the winner of Big Brother 25 after an incredible final speech explaining his game.




During his time in the Big Brother house, Jag made some off-color jokes about the women in the game, especially Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields. While Felicia and Cirie did the majority of the cooking, Jag and his allies, Matt and Cameron Hardin, made remarks about the women only having the ability to cook but not to play the game. In an interview with the Black Bi Reality podcast (via Times Of India), Jag took accountability for the comments, sharing, “[The jokes are] something I’ll own up to. It was all in good fun...but jokes like that are...inappropriate to make. So I absolutely accept responsibility for that.” 


 Jag Bains&#39; Big Brother 25 Gameplay Explained 
          

While Jag’s comments about Cirie and Felicia staying in the kitchen rather than getting down to strategically playing Big Brother were inappropriate, his ability to blend in socially with the rest of the cast was helpful to him. Allowing Matt and Cameron to make remarks that he didn’t exactly agree with throughout their time in the game and not necessarily disagreeing with them was a tactic that helped Jag to remain under the radar throughout Big Brother 25. Part of Jag’s gameplay was appearing socially neutral, which allowed him to make bonds beyond alliances and pushed other players to keep him safe.





 

Though Jag wasn&#39;t the strongest player on Big Brother 25, he was one of the most intelligent. His strategy early on in the game was challenging to watch, as he played more emotionally than strategically. After Matt&#39;s BB Power of Invincibility nullified Jag&#39;s unanimous eviction in week 4, he changed his style. Staying loyal to Matt, Jag was able to have a hand in several evictions without actually wielding power. When he finally got power, Jag chose to cut players he knew he could beat him at the end, like Cory Wurtenberger. Ultimately, Jag owned up to the tough calls he made at the end of the game.

While off-color remarks and jokes can help someone get through the game of Big Brother, hearing them from the outside is always much harsher. With Jag understanding the severity of his comments inside the house, he&#39;s taken steps to ensure that he&#39;s taking accountability for what he&#39;s done in the game, apologizing to those involved in private while reassuring the public that he&#39;s made amends. While there&#39;s still work to be done surrounding the power imbalance between some male and female contestants, Big Brother has always made it clear that the actions of its contestants are always shown fully so the audience can make their own judgments.
