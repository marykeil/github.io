Summary

  Silo season 2 resumed filming in December 2023 after delays due to the SAG/AFTRA strike, and the release date is still uncertain.   The show&#39;s renewal for season 2 shows Apple TV Plus&#39;s confidence in its ongoing success.   Silo season 2 story may expand the universe with new characters and locations outside the silo.  





The first season of Silo was not even finished when Apple renewed the sci-fi show for another volume, and even more exciting Silo season 2 news has followed since. Silo is based on a series of novels by author Hugh Howey, and tells the story of thousands of people living in a giant silo that acts as an underground bunker. Residents of the silo are forbidden from exploring the outside world. Rebecca Ferguson stars as an engineer named Juliette who begins investigating what happens to people who attempt to leave the silo and how the residents are controlled.




Silo premiered on Apple TV Plus on May 5, 2023, and the Silo season 1 finale became available on the streaming platform beginning June 30, 2023. Since Silo&#39;s debut, the show has developed a loyal following and received positive reviews from critics. Trends in TV change frequently, and there has been a focus on producing miniseries that only receive one season over stories that take place over multiple seasons. Silo being renewed for season 2 signals just how big of a hit it is for Apple TV Plus and how much faith the streaming platform has in the adaptation.

 Silo Season 2 Latest News 
          

After months of delays, the most recent news regarding the Apple TV&#43; hit is positive and sees Silo season 2 resume filming in December 2023 (via Collider). The production of the series was halted due to the SAG/AFTRA strike which saw many actors stop work in July 2023, but the show wasted no time getting the ball rolling again once the issue was resolved. Though a release date hasn&#39;t been set, the months-long delay will certainly have a profound effect on when Silo season 2 comes out. 






The SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.

Silo season 2 news confirmed the continuation of the series in June 2023. Apple TV Plus head of programming Matt Cherniss revealed in a statement that the streamer believed in the show since the start. This implies that adapting the books beyond the first season was always in the cards, but viewership numbers still needed to be good enough to commit, and they have been.

Though the show is filming once again, no word has come regarding the cast of Silo season 2. One thing is for certain, Rebecca Ferguson will once again return as the show&#39;s main character, Juliette, and it&#39;s safe to assume that the members of the main cast who are still alive will be back for Silo season 2. This means that expected returning cast members include: 

 Actor  Silo Role   Common  Robert Sims   Tim Robbins  Bernard   Avi Nash  Lukas   Chinaza Uche  Paul   Harriet Walter  Martha

 Silo Season 2 Story Details 
          




Because Silo is based on books, there is some source material for the season 2 story to follow. The second book, Shift, is a prequel. Since Silo features multiple changes from the books, future seasons might not follow the prequel storyline and will instead interweave flashbacks into the current plot. With confirmation that Silo season 2 is happening, the series will likely pick up directly after the startling season 1 cliffhanger when Juliette steps outside only to live.

Silo season 1 asked two main questions; what really happens when characters leave the silo, and how much does Judicial actually know about the world? For season 2 to move forward and stay engaging for viewers, it will eventually need to expand its universe. This means that Juliette may have to venture out into the world now that she&#39;s left the silo and lived. Because of this, it can be expected that Silo season 2 will introduce new characters, locations, and plot lines outside the silo.
