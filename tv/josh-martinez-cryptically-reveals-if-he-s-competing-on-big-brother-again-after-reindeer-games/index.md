## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games&#39; Josh Martinez may have been eliminated during Santa&#39;s Showdown, but he&#39;s teasing his possible return to Big Brother.




Big Brother Reindeer Games saw Big Brother 19 winner Josh Martinez’s elimination after a photo-finish during Santa’s Showdown, but he might not be done with the franchise just yet. Josh was a polarizing houseguest during his time on Big Brother 19, winning the game in a 5 to 4 vote against Paul Abrahamian. While Paul was objectively the better Big Brother player, Josh was a huge personality in the game and had competitive gameplay along with a sense of loyalty, which Paul lacked. While Josh may not have been a fan-favorite during his time on Big Brother, he was a tremendously memorable cast member and has stayed in the reality TV arena.




After his shocking elimination from Big Brother Reindeer Games, Josh was emotional as he made his way through the Big Brother house and shared that he’d love to play again one day. On Twitter, after a fan expressed they’d love to see him play the game again, he responded with a cryptic message that made it clear he’s in the same boat.


 

In response to @BreezydayH sharing, “After #ReindeerGames I now really want to see @JOSHMBB19 play a regular season of BB again,” Josh couldn’t say much but said, “Will be back,” with a winking emoji to keep things confusing.


 Josh Martinez&#39;s Big Brother Reindeer Games Journey Explained 
          




Josh came to Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 after a long absence from Big Brother but with several seasons of The Challenge under his belt. While Josh was supposed to return for Big Brother 22 as an All-Star, he tested positive for COVID-19 prior to his entry into the house and had to back out. He was excited to be returning to the game as a life-long superfan, hoping to prove himself as a competitor after winning the game in the past. While he was a threat to several of the Big Brother Reindeer Games cast members, he was lower on the list than some others, like Xavier Prather or Cody Calafiore.

Josh made it through the first several eliminations on Big Brother Reindeer Games without having to face Santa’s Showdown, but the competition was a difficult test of endurance he was facing against Big Brother 18 winner Nicole Franzel. Both competitors had to hold on to a large rotating candy cane for as long as possible, and while Josh had the advantage of a larger wingspan, Nicole was able to continually adjust her grip to keep her arms engaged. After being thrown off at nearly the same moment, Josh wound up losing the competition and being eliminated from Big Brother Reindeer Games. While he was emotional, Josh enjoyed his time on the series.




Josh’s time on Big Brother Reindeer Games may have been cut short, but he was able to do something tremendous during his run on the series. While many viewers came into the show with differing opinions on Josh from his time on Big Brother in the past, he was able to rehabilitate his image with charming, funny diary room sessions and a show of his athleticism. As a Big Brother Reindeer Games player, Josh has made it clear he’d be a great pick for another Big Brother season in the future.

Big Brother Reindeer Games airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
