The Cleaning Lady is a gripping FOX crime drama, and The Cleaning Lady season 3 is just around the corner.

This unforeseen action by Nadia not only thwarted Thony&#39;s plans to collaborate with the FBI but also set off a chain reaction of consequences, setting up a gripping The Cleaning Lady season 3.
