## Literature Review
Several signs suggest that fans won’t watch The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 14 without a completely new cast and storylines.




There are a few reasons why The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills could end after season 13. The reality TV series has been one of Bravo’s biggest franchises over the last decade. It premiered in 2010 and has come a long way since then. The spin-off’s newest season came out in October 2023, featuring some old cast members and many newcomers. These latest names included proud mommy Sutton Stracke, entrepreneur Crystal Kung Minkoff, and Kyle Richards’ neighbor Annemarie Wiley. RHOBH season 13 focused on the usual drama, with the biggest plot being Kyle’s relationship.
RHOBH’s newest season featured some notable moments. In episode 1, viewers got a brief glimpse of former cast member Lisa Rinna’s resignation letter. She thanked the network for 8 years and revealed she wouldn’t renew her contract or return to the series anymore. Erika Girardi also shut down some rumors about her weight loss. She claimed her transformation was thanks to good hormones and not Ozempic. The premiere episode also showed Kyle and her husband, Mauricio Umansky, navigating their separate lives. Watching the once happily married couple fall apart was uncomfortable for many viewers.

 10  The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills’ Viewership Has Declined 
The Show’s Failing To Keep Viewers’ Attention For Long


 







Despite a successful decade-long run, season 13 may be the last time viewers see RHOBH. One reason is the show’s viewership, which highlights RHOBH has become a shadow of its former self. During season 2, the series hit over two million viewers in the key demographic. In comparison, RHOBH season 13 was close to the one million mark, with the age ranging from 18-49 across multiple platforms. The network also put out delayed viewership numbers, sharing the data of the first three days probably because the live viewership numbers weren’t good.

 9  Many Iconic Cast Members Have Left The Show 
Viewers Don’t Get To Watch Familiar Faces Anymore
        

RHOBH may not be as interesting as it used to be due to all the cast exits. When the show premiered in 2010, fans got involved in stories of Taylor Armstrong, Camille Grammer, Adrienne Maloof, Kim Richards, Kyle, Lisa Vanderpump, and many more. Fast forward to season 13, and nearly 90% of the original cast has left the show, with only Kyle remaining. Some other iconic cast members who became famous in the later seasons, like Eileen Davidson and Lisa, have also said goodbye, leaving viewers with only new cast members.

 8  Kyle Richards May Want To Quit To Focus On Her Future 
Kyle May Need Off Time To Bring Order To Her Chaotic Life


 







Another reason why RHOBH may end is Kyle’s potential exit. Kyle may want to take time off to focus on her life and future. Over the months, she has faced many challenges in her personal life. She has dealt with divorce rumors about her husband, Mauricio, new relationship rumors with Morgan Wade, and many more. Kyle may need time to focus on herself and her goals after season 13. She may want to work on her relationship with Mauricio or finally decide to move on to a better future with someone else.





 7  New Cast Members Aren’t Enough To Carry The Show In Kyle’s Absence 
New Stars’ Lives May Not Be Able To Hook The Audience
        

RHOBH has always been star-studded, with wealthy families like the Richards and Vanderpump being the show’s highlight. However, things have changed considerably after all the cast members dropped out of the franchise and moved on. Now, the series relies upon Kyle, whose exit could mean the end of the show. If Kyle leaves RHOBH, the new names like Crystal, Garcelle Beauvais, Sutton, Dorit Kemsley, and Erika aren’t enough to carry the show any further. Bravo will have to get back some of the originals if they want to continue the series.





 6  RHOBH Audience Is Losing Interest In New Stars’ Shenanigans 
Fans Say “Beverly Hills To Be Cancelled”


Apart from Kyle’s epic split-up drama in RHOBH season 13, there aren’t many things fans care about in the show. People are least interested in the new stars’ stories and have publicly shared that they want the show to end. In one Reddit thread (via another_feminist), fans discussed if it was time for “Beverly Hills to be canceled,” because it wasn’t as interesting as before. A Redditor commented, “it’s getting so old,” adding that the cast members are now focusing on “the most basic, surface level issues” to create on-screen drama. Another Redditor wrote, “vet your newbies better or bring back the oldies.”





 5  Bravo Could Cancel The Show To Reboot (Like RHONY) 
The Network Would Try A Different Approach To Retain Viewership


 







There’s a possibility that Bravo could do the same thing to RHOBH that they did to The Real Housewives of New York City. In 2023, the network rebooted RHONY completely, bringing in a new cast, stories, and drama. Fans have also been asking Bravo to reboot RHOBH since the show desperately needs it. In a recent social media discussion via hello__brooklyn, viewers discussed why RHOBH deserves a “complete reboot and new casting.” The network may listen to its fans and give the series the much-needed adrenaline boost by reimagining it with new cast members.





 4  Lisa Rinna Throws Shade At The Show 
Lisa Doesn’t Want To Work In Toxic Conditions
        

Filming RHOBH has become toxic for cast members, as per Lisa. In early 2023, she shared her feelings with People and implied some reasons for her departure from the show. She said, “I just think it’s unhealthy.” Lisa claimed she “fu**ing hated” her recent months on the franchise while dealing with her mother’s passing. She claimed the show wasn’t right for her, hinting that it wasn’t what it used to be. The RHOBH alum’s scary words indicate the backstage may be full of tension or a toxic environment that the public doesn’t know about.





 3  There’s No News On RHOBH Season 14 Renewal 
Bravo May Consider Other Options Before Filming Season 14
        

Bravo is pretty quick while renewing or greenlighting its popular shows. Often, fans can find the news about the announcements of new seasons early on. However, the network hasn’t released any information on whether they have renewed RHOBH for more seasons and what’s in the future for the series. The silence hints that Bravo may reconsider what to do with the spin-off after the recent season. The network may try to reboot the show, end it, or transform it into something else. The year 2024 will be a wild one for RHOBH fans.





 2  The New Ladies Don’t Have Chemistry 
New Cast Members Seem To Hang Out Together For The Sake Of The Show
        

RHOBH no longer works because of the chemistry between new cast members. The change was first noticed in season 10 when many newcomers were getting to know each other. At the time, it was realized that the new cast was simply on the show for the sake of it. There was some suggestion that the ladies would never hang out with each other if it weren’t for filming RHOBH. Over the years, this lack of chemistry has only broadened, with even newer names joining the franchise. The show needs a cast with history and chemistry.





 1  Major Storylines Have Concluded 
OG Cast Members’ Interesting Stories Have Reached Resolution
        

Like any reality TV show, RHOBH is all about cast members and their journeys. Unsurprisingly, many of those journeys have concluded over the last thirteen years. Nowadays, RHOBH seems like a series without a purpose, which impacts it negatively. The show has no watch-worthy storylines, and none of the drama appears as genuine. When the cast was new to the series, each one of them had certain goals in their minds. Witnessing their stories unfold and watching them reach their destinations was entertaining. Unfortunately, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has no major plot left anymore, which calls for a reboot.
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST.
