## Literature Review
The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon has started strong, and with season 2 on the way it&#39;s clear AMC has big plans for the Norman Reedus TWD spinoff.




AMC has big plans for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2, especially since Norman Reedus&#39;s crossbow-slinging globetrotter will finally reunite with his dearest friend. Set after The Walking Dead finale, the TWD spinoff focuses on Norman Reedus as the titular Daryl Dixon. Alongside The Walking Dead: Dead City and the upcoming The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon continues the story of AMC’s iconic zombie apocalypse franchise (although the timeline is now completely detached from the original Robert Kirkman comics).




The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2 will more-than likely take place in Europe thanks to Daryl&#39;s French found family — especially surrogate son figure and possible messiah Laurent. The first chapter of Daryl Dixon’s new story sees him travel to France, where the zombie virus originated. It became clear in the first episode that the story is much wider than Daryl, with the finale potentially impacting the entire TWD universe. With an ensemble range of endearing characters, a hefty amount of mystery, and some monstrous new TWD zombie variants, it’s easy to see why AMC was so quick to renew The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2.


 Most Recent The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 2 News 
         

Though an official release date has not been established yet, the AMC 2024 trailer featured The Walking Dead&#39;s spinoffs which suggests a release window. While the teaser didn&#39;t feature any new footage from The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon - The Book of Carol, it served its purpose of drumming up interest in the sophomore outing. It also featured a tease for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, the spinoff that centers on Rick and Michonne and it&#39;s clear that the Walking Dead universe is still central to AMC&#39;s plans for the future. 






The Walking Dead: Dead City season 2 was not included in the teaser, suggesting it won&#39;t return in 2024.






 The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 2 Is Confirmed 
          

AMC has renewed The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon for season 2. Confirmation of the season 2 renewal came in July 2023, when the network announced both Daryl Dixon and sister spinoff The Walking Dead: Dead City would both be getting second volumes (via AMC). The announcement came less than a week before the Dead City season finale, and several months before the first season of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon had aired.



 The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 2 Cast 
          




There’s one guarantee when it comes to the cast of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2 — Norman Reedus will be back as Daryl Dixon. The biggest Daryl Dixon season 2 cast change is the addition of Melissa McBride as Carol as a series regular. Carol&#39;s appearance was teased in episode 5, &#34;Deux Amores&#34;, with McBride appearing in the flesh for a cameo in the finale, &#34;Coming Home&#34;. AMC has confirmed that Carol is in season 2 of Daryl Dixon, and she&#39;ll be so central to the story that the official title for the next chapter is The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon — The Book of Carol.

A new character has also been cast for the upcoming season. Manish Dayal will be playing Ash, a Maine-based engineer who has managed to maintain upkeep on a plane throughout the zombie apocalypse but potentially holds a dark secret in the greenhouse in his backyard.

The returning cast is expected to include: 

 Actor  The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Role   Clémence Poésy  Isabelle   Louis Puech Scigliuzzi  Laurent   Laïka Blanc-Francard  Sylvie   Anne Charrier  Genet   Romain Levi  Codron   Adam Nagaitis  Quinn   








 The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 2 Story 
          

The ending of Daryl Dixon season 1 left a few teases for the second season, even if it was also an incredibly ambiguous cliffhanger. Given that season 2 of Daryl Dixon has been filming in France, it&#39;s likely he&#39;ll be staying in Europe. With the mystery surrounding Laurent&#39;s special gifts still unresolved, season 2 could flesh them out. Additionally, Daryl will likely get caught up in the fight between the Union of Hope and Genet&#39;s Pouvoir des Vivants, though he avoided getting involved in season 1. 

The big question The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2 plot needs to resolve is how Daryl and Carol reunite. Melissa McBride made an appearance at the end of the first season, and it&#39;s been confirmed that the next will be titled The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon - The Book of Carol. Whatever else happens when the spinoff returns it&#39;s guaranteed that Carol will be involved somehow, though the specifics of how, such as whether she gets to France to join Daryl, have yet to be revealed.






 The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon Season 2 Trailer 
          

Though it is far from a revealing trailer, the first tease for Daryl Dixon season 2 was released by AMC in the form of their 2024 trailer which showed off all the series returning for the year. Amid clips of other AMC shows, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon and The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live were featured prominently through the use of old footage. Though fans will have to wait a while to get their first glimpse of the new season, the trailer all but confirms season 2 is coming in 2024.
