<p>Best Drama TV Shows On Netflix
The Crown (2016-2023)</p>
<p>The Crown   Release Date   November 4, 2016    Genres   Biography , Drama , History    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Netflix&rsquo;s epic, Emmy-winning drama The Crown is a dramatic retelling of Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s reign. The show is part historical time capsule, as it covers the various political and world events in the British monarchy, from the Cold War to the unemployment crisis under Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s administration. However, The Crown is also an intense family drama that delves deeply into the royals&rsquo; personal lives from Elizabeth&rsquo;s rocky marriage to Prince Philip to her conflict with Princess Margaret over marrying Peter Townsend.</p>
<p>Three actresses play Queen Elizabeth II at various stages in her life — Claire Foy, Olivia Colman, and Imelda Staunton — and they all leave their mark playing the world&rsquo;s most famous woman. The Crown has faced numerous controversies for historical inaccuracy, but when taken at its intent, as a dramatization, it is an utterly enthralling, binge-able series that shows that indeed, heavy is the head that wears the crown.</p>

<p>Squid Game (2021-Present)</p>
<p>Squid Game   Release Date   September 17, 2021    Cast   Wi Ha-joon , Anupam Tripathi , Oh Yeong-su , Heo Sung-tae , Park Hae-soo , Jung Ho-yeon , Lee Jung-jae , Kim Joo-ryoung    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Action    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Capitalism critique has never been more violent or visually stunning than it has with Squid Game. Released in the fall of 2021, this South Korean Netflix series took the pop culture zeitgeist by storm. It sees 456 financially strapped contestants compete in a series of lethal children&rsquo;s games in the hopes of winning the big cash prize. Class warfare has become an increasingly popular subject of film and TV, but many offerings in this subgenre have a decidedly &ldquo;eat the rich&rdquo; slant whereas Squid Game is all about the brutality of being on the losing side of capitalism, which most are.</p>
<p>While Squid Game&rsquo;s violence is difficult to stomach, it&rsquo;s impossible to look away as the sets, costumes, and cinematography show what a work of art the series is. And the brutal deaths aren&rsquo;t what&rsquo;s terrifying about Squid Game — it&rsquo;s the lengths the contestants will go to for the smallest chance of getting out of debt, a struggle that is all too relatable.</p>

<p>Better Call Saul (2015 - 2022)
Better Call Saul   Release Date   February 8, 2015    Cast   Bob Odenkirk , Rhea Seehorn , Jonathan Banks , Patrick Fabian , Michael Mando , Giancarlo Esposito    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   6</p>
<p>When Breaking Bad&rsquo;s ending drew a close to the stories of Walter White, Heisenberg and occasionally unwilling sidekick Jesse Pinkman, whatever came next was always going to have a Herculean task. But Better Call Saul was never interested in being an over-hyped pretender, and the spin-off focused on Bob Odenkirk&rsquo;s slippery lawyer actually managed the unthinkable for many, surpassing the greatness of the original. It did so by never stooping so low as to imitate what came before it.</p>
<p>Odenkirk&rsquo;s Jimmy McGill - an early prototype of what Goodman would become by the time of Breaking Bad - wasn&rsquo;t the most obvious spin-off character, but his own Breaking Bad journey is as compelling and outrageous as that of Mr White. And while Better Call Saul does rely on favors from returning characters, and eventually overlapped with Breaking Bad, it stands on its own merits with incredible performances and a subtler take on the underworld it so revels in exploring.</p>

<p>Band Of Brothers (2001)</p>
<p>Band of Brothers   Release Date   September 9, 2001    Cast   Kirk Acevedo , Eion Bailey , Michael Cudlitz , Dale Dye , Scott Grimes , Frank John Hughes , Damian Lewis , Ron Livingston , James Madio , Neal McDonough , David Schwimmer , Richard Speight Jr. , Donnie Wahlberg , Matthew Settle , Rick Warden , Marc Warren , Dexter Fletcher , Colin Hanks , Ross McCall    Genres   Drama , History    Seasons   1</p>
<p>The highest praise that Band of Brothers deserves is that it is unquestionably the gold standard of HBO&rsquo;s TV show history. With an ensemble cast playing versions of real-life figures, it is as profoundly affecting more than twenty years after its release as it ever was. Stunningly executed with a provocative, precise portrayal of World War II military campaigns, it is easily one of the greatest mini-series of all time and its appeal is far from limited by its military genre.</p>
<pre><code>              Band Of Brothers Ending Explained: The Aftermath Of Easy Company After WWII   The Band of Brothers ending shows the complicated nature of being a soldier, even after the war is over, but also, the relief in no longer fighting.    
</code></pre>
<p>Produced by powerhouses Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Band Of Brothers tells the story of the 506th&rsquo;s legendary Easy Company from their conscription and training through to the end of World War II. Led eventually by Richard D. Winters (the stunning Damian Lewis), the company see action at the very forefront of the US&rsquo; military campaign in Northern Europe. But it&rsquo;s about so much more than the war, and fundamentally, Band Of Brothers is a stunning achievement, with an incredible cast, and some of the best storytelling you&rsquo;ll ever witness. The fact that it is now on Netflix makes its celebration as the best TV show on the platform simple.</p>

<p>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy (2005-Present)</p>
<p>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy   Release Date   March 27, 2005    Cast   Kelly McCreary , Patrick Dempsey , Kevin McKidd , Chandra Wilson , Jesse Williams , Jake Borelli , camilla luddington , Ellen Pompeo , Chyler Leigh , Eric Dane , Caterina Scorsone , Giacomo Gianniotti , Anthony Hill , Kate Walsh , Justin Chambers , Sarah Drew , Greg Germann , Martin Henderson , Katherine Heigl , T.R. Knight , Sara Ramirez , Jerrika Hinton , Richard Flood , Sandra Oh , Kim Raver , Jason George , Tessa Ferrer , Isaiah Washington , James Pickens Jr. , Gaius Charles , Chris Carmack , Brooke Smith , Jessica Capshaw    Genres   Romance , Drama</p>
<p>The show that launched the Shondaland empire, every season of Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy is available to stream on Netflix. Medical dramas have long been a staple of network TV, but when the brilliant Shonda Rhimes released Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy in 2005, she captured lightning in a bottle. The series begins with Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) beginning her medical internship at Seattle Grace Hospital (now Grey Sloan Memorial), and from there Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy gives viewers a peek behind the surgical curtain at the personal and professional lives of Meredith and her colleagues.</p>
<p>As seen in her other shows like Scandal, How to Get Away with Murder, and Bridgerton, Rhimes is a master at creating steamy, soapy romances that also feel grounded and real. And while Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy is beloved for its enthralling romantic storylines, it also deftly tackles sensitive subjects from abortion to sexual assault. There&rsquo;s a reason Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy has achieved such success — it&rsquo;s not only one of Rhimes&rsquo; best shows but also one of Netflix&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Friday Night Lights (2006-2011)</p>
<p>Friday Night Lights   Release Date   October 3, 2006    Cast   Taylor Kitsch , Jesse Plemons , Kyle Chandler , Connie Britton    Genres   Sports    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Friday Night Lights started as a non-fiction sports book by H.G. Bissinger, which was turned adapted into a 2004 movie. The TV series is loosely inspired by the movie, and it is by far the best and most memorable. Like its predecessors, the Friday Night Lights series follows the high school football coach and players of a football-obsessed town, the fictional Dillon, Texas. While there&rsquo;s plenty of action-packed football, Friday Night Lights is just as concerned with the day-to-day lives of its characters off the field.</p>
<p>Whether viewers have picked up a football in their lives or not, Friday Night Lights will inspire everybody who watches. From Coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) instilling wisdom into his players to his wife, guidance counselor Tami (Connie Britton) helping students reach their full potential, it&rsquo;s impossible not to get swept in the &ldquo;clear eyes, full hearts, can&rsquo;t lose&rdquo; optimism on full display every episode. Friday Night Lights launched the careers of some of today&rsquo;s best young A-list actors, from Jesse Plemons to Michael B. Jordan, and the show is a masterclass of acting and storytelling.</p>

<p>Suits (2011-2019)
Suits   Release Date   June 23, 2011    Cast   Patrick J. Adams , Sarah Rafferty , Gabriel Macht , Meghan Markle , Rick Hoffman , Gina Torres , Amanda Schull , Dule Hill , Katherine Heigl    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   9</p>
<p>Witty, slick, and addictive, Suits is a USA Network legal drama that all starts with college dropout Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) using his photographic memory to talk his way into a job at a law firm despite having no legal experience. He&rsquo;s hired by powerful &ldquo;closer&rdquo; attorney Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), and together they take on cases and navigated the sharkwater politics of Pearson Hardman. Suits also notably stars Meghan Markle as whipsmart paralegal Rachel Zane, and was the actress&rsquo; first role before she became the Duchess of Sussex.</p>
<p>The show made headlines in the summer of 2023 when Suits broke records after arriving on Netflix, as it became the highest-viewed acquired show in a single week, clocking 3.674 billion hours of watch time. While Markle&rsquo;s star power likely has something to do with this, in an era of intense, serialized prestige TV drama, sometimes viewers just want an easy watch, and with its procedural format, Suits delivers just that, while still maintaining an intelligent, fresh tone.</p>
<p>5:18                       7 Reasons Suits Is Dominating Netflix 4 Years After It Ended   Four years after it ended on USA Network, the legal drama Suits is dominating the charts since arriving on Netflix. Here are the reasons why.</p>

<p>Six Feet Under (2001-2005)</p>
<p>Six Feet Under   Release Date   June 3, 2001    Cast   Peter Krause , Lauren Ambrose    Genres   Drama    Seasons   5</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the Sopranos or the Roys, nobody delivers a dysfunctional family show quite like HBO, and Six Feet Under&rsquo;s Fisher clan is right at the top of the list. The family runs a funeral home and their world is rocked when patriarch Nathaniel Fisher (Richard Jenkins) dies. Each Six Feet Under episode begins with a death that is thematic of the storylines faced by the main characters as the Fishers go about their lives, trying to run their business, grieve, live, love, and grapple with their own mortality.</p>
<p>From the beginning right to the finale, which has been hailed by many as one of the greatest series finales of all time, Six Feet Under grabs viewers by the emotional heartstrings and refuses to let go. Much like the deaths on the show, Six Feet Under&rsquo;s awards are numerous. With all the acclaimed, legendary shows HBO has produced, the fact that Six Feet Under is still in the conversation speaks to its staying power and sterling quality.</p>

<p>Best Comedy TV Shows On Netflix
Gilmore Girls (2000-2007)</p>
<p>Gilmore Girls   Release Date   October 5, 2000    Cast   Lauren Graham , Scott Patterson , Sean Gunn , Keiko Agena , Matt Czuchry , Alexis Bledel , Yanic Truesdale , Kelly Bishop , Melissa McCarthy , Edward Herrmann , Liza Weil , Jared Padalecki , Milo Ventimiglia    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   7</p>
<p>reator Amy Sherman-Palladino may have struck awards gold with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, which is an excellent show, but Gilmore Girls is her true legacy. This comforting series is the ultimate binge-watch as it follows the titular mother-daughter and best friends duo Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) as they bond over dreams, relationships, movies, and too much coffee. Whether it&rsquo;s spending time at Luke&rsquo;s Diner, at a town festival in their quaint home of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, or at a Friday Night Dinner with Lorelai&rsquo;s rich, snobby parents Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop), the Gilmore girls are always having a fast-talking adventure full of heart.</p>
<p>There is truly no show like Gilmore Girls, as the series cemented itself in TV history with its trademark rapid-fire, pop culture reference-heavy dialogue and warm tone, which makes every viewer wish they could move to Stars Hollow (particularly in Gilmore Girls&rsquo; autumn episodes). The series&rsquo; popularity is enduring, with Netflix releasing a four-part revival special Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life in 2016 and Luke actor Scott Patterson hosting a rewatch podcast called I Am All In. So grab a blanket, a coffee, and your favorite junk food, and tune into the best show on Netflix.</p>

<p>Sex Education (2019-Present)</p>
<p>Sex Education   Release Date   January 11, 2019    Cast   Gillian Anderson , Ncuti Gatwa , Tanya Reynolds , Aimee Lou Wood , Alistair Petrie , Kedar Williams-Stirling , Connor Swindells , Asa Butterfield , Emma Mackey , Patricia Allison    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Sex Education felt like a breath of fresh air when it debuted on Netflix back in 2019. What&rsquo;s perhaps most impressive is that it remained that way right until the very end. It&rsquo;s not easy to make a TV show about teens, especially one that feels simultaneously as of-the-moment yet somewhat timeless as Sex Education: get it wrong and it falls anywhere between pandering, condescending, cringe-worthy, or tryhard. Netflix deftly finds the balance, though, with a show that&rsquo;s sweet and heartfelt, utterly hilarious (often grossly so), emotional, risk-taking, and has strong messaging on a wide variety of issues, but weaves them organically into its plot.</p>
<p>What makes Sex Education work so well, ultimately, are its characters. Even when the plots get a little absurd, they keep it all grounded. The show is authentic and honest, and its characters are very much like real teenagers - their struggles either relatable or providing a teaching moment or two, and often both. Sex Education&rsquo;s cast is entirely great, and full of actors who are already breaking out into bigger things (Ncuti Gatwa could power the TARDIS on his megawatt smile and pure charisma alone). At the same time, they may not be in too many things that are better.</p>

<p>Grace And Frankie (2015-2022)</p>
<p>Grace and Frankie   Release Date   May 8, 2015    Cast   Jane Fonda , Ethan Embry , Brooklyn Decker , June Diane Raphael , Sam Waterston , Martin Sheen , Lily Tomlin , Baron Vaughn    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Veteran stars of 9 to 5, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin reunite for Grace and Frankie. In the Netflix comedy series, they play the titular mismatched duo who are forced to lean on each other for support when their husbands announce they are leaving them for each other. As the martini-swilling type-A Grace and the artsy free-spirit Frankie move into their shared beach house, they learn to tolerate each other&rsquo;s differences, and with every passing episode, their relationship takes little steps towards becoming one of television&rsquo;s greatest friendships.</p>
<p>At seven seasons, Grace and Frankie is Netflix&rsquo;s longest-running original series to date.</p>
<p>Senior characters are rarely the protagonists of TV shows, and Grace and Frankie&rsquo;s success proves audiences of this demographic are starved for characters they can relate to. But Grace and Frankie&rsquo;s charm doesn&rsquo;t just appeal to those close in age to the protagonists; it is an uproariously funny, sweet and heartwarming show that makes for one of the most relaxing, uplifting binge-watches on Netflix.</p>

<p>Beef (2023)</p>
<p>Beef   Cast   Steven Yeun , Ali Wong , David Choe , Young Mazino , Joseph Lee , Patti Yasutake    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Academy Award nominee Steven Yeun and two-time member of Time&rsquo;s 100 Most Influential People list Ali Wong lend their considerable talent for this Netflix Original miniseries. In Beef, a simple act of road rage between struggling contractor Danny Cho (Yeun) and successful small business owner Amy Lau (Wong) gives way to a feud for the ages. Typically, praise for on-screen chemistry is reserved for romantic leads, but Yeun and Wong absolutely sizzle off the screen as two bitter enemies.</p>
<p>Netflix&rsquo;s Beef is produced by A24, the acclaimed independent production company behind Best Picture winners Moonlight and Everything Everywhere All at Once. The company is known for refreshing arthouse dramas with an edge, and Beef is no exception. Whether or not it sees awards glory, Beef will forever live rent-free in the minds of Netflix audiences.</p>

<p>Seinfeld (1989-1998)</p>
<p>Seinfeld   Release Date   July 5, 1989    Cast   Jerry Seinfeld , Julia Louis-Dreyfus , Jason Alexander , Michael Richards    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   9</p>
<p>Netflix struck gold when the &lsquo;show about nothing&rsquo; arrived in its catalog. What started as one of the simplest premises ever, courtesy of Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, became one of television&rsquo;s most iconic and influential series. The sitcom follows the mundane happenings of comedian Jerry Seinfeld (Seinfeld in a fictionalized version of himself), his insecure and cheap best friend George (Jason Alexander), his sarcastic ex-girlfriend turned platonic friend Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and his wacky neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards).</p>
<p>Across its nine seasons, Seinfeld is a treasure trove of classic episodes, including &ldquo;The Chinese Restaurant&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Soup Nazi&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Marine Biologist&rdquo;, and of course, &ldquo;The Contest&rdquo;. The sitcom is full of hilarious one-liners and pop culture terms that are still quoted to this day, from &ldquo;Serenity now!&rdquo; to &ldquo;spongeworthy&rdquo; to &ldquo;double-dipping&rdquo;. The Writers Guild of America has honored Seinfeld as the second-best written television show of all time, behind only The Sopranos, making it truly the master of Netflix&rsquo;s domain.</p>

<p>Best Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy TV Shows On Netflix
Black Mirror (2011-Present)</p>
<p>Black Mirror   Release Date   December 4, 2011    Cast   Bryce Dallas Howard , Hayley Atwell , Anthony Mackie    Genres   Anthology , Drama , Science Fiction , Thriller    Seasons   5</p>
<p>The 21st century&rsquo;s answer to The Twilight Zone, Black Mirror is a sci-fi staple on Netflix. It&rsquo;s an anthology series that shows the darkest of humanity through its social commentary on technology and the media. Black Mirror began as a series on Channel 4 in the UK, but upon its move to Netflix, its scope increased along with its budget, with its haunting visuals and roster of A-list cast members, including Jon Hamm, Jesse Plemons, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Annie Murphy.</p>
<p>What makes Black Mirror so terrifying is that it doesn&rsquo;t blame technology for the atrocities of its storylines; it blames humanity. The show explores that the more technology evolves and develops, the more opportunities people have to tap into their most disturbing impulses. While some dystopian sci-fi stories are comfortingly far-fetched, viewers will find themselves questioning whether or not the events of Black Mirror episodes could happen — and will more often than not be horrified at the answer.</p>

<p>One Piece (2023-Present)
One Piece (Live-Action)   Release Date   August 31, 2023    Cast   Iñaki Godoy , Mackenyu , Emily Rudd , Jacob Romero Gibson , Taz Skylar    Genres   Action , Adventure , Comedy , Fantasy    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Based on the hugely popular manga and anime (which started in 1997 and is still going), Netflix&rsquo;s live-action One Piece is both a respectful adaptation (creator Eiichiro Oda is thankfully involved) and also a great starting point for new fans. Given the weight of lore behind One Piece&rsquo;s cast of characters, that&rsquo;s no small feat, and it&rsquo;s down to a well-executed, entertaining story that packs in oceans of heat. The swash-buckling story follows the colorful Straw Hat Pirates as they search for the fabled &ldquo;One Piece&rdquo; treasure. It&rsquo;s trope-heavy, but there&rsquo;s a beautiful simplicity to it that should give anime fans hope that other series could follow to live-action.</p>
<p>One Piece the anime has over a thousand episodes, and is still running.</p>
<p>Thanks to the episodic story set-up, with adventure-of-the-week chapters that take the pirates, under Iñaki Godoy&rsquo;s Monkey D. Luffy to new islands for new emerging challenges, it&rsquo;s also a Netflix show that can be dipped into and not necessarily hungrily binged at once. And while there are changes to the source material, they are largely smart, and the aesthetic commitment to making it feel like it came from the anime world may massage some of the bruises purists feel because of them.</p>
<pre><code>              Netflix's One Piece Season 1 Ending Explained (In Detail)   One Piece season 1's ending may bring the first chapter of Netflix's live-action adaptation to a close, but it's only the beginning for Luffy.

<p>The Witcher (2019-Present)</p>
<p>The Witcher   Release Date   December 20, 2019    Cast   Tom Canton , Maciej Musial , Björn Hlynur Haraldsson , Anna Shaffer , MyAnna Buring , Lars Mikkelsen , Royce Pierreson , Eamon Farren , Wilson Radjou-Pujalte , Joey Batey , Jodhi May , Therica Wilson-Read , Anya Chalotra , Mimi Ndiweni , Henry Cavill , Freya Allan , Adam Levy , Amit Shah , Liam Hemsworth , Laurence Fishburne    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Action , Fantasy    Seasons   2</p>
<p>While screen adaptations of video games are slowly shedding their bad reputation thanks to shows like The Last of Us, The Witcher also had literary help, as it is based on the fantasy book series of the same name by Andrezej Sapkowski. The show centers on stoic monster hunter Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) and his adventures, as he is eventually tasked with protecting Crown Princess Ciri of Cintra (Freya Allan). The Witcher season 1 beautifully establishes the show&rsquo;s fantastical world, and seasons 2 and 3 expand upon it and the characters&rsquo; complex relationships.</p>
<p>Fantasy series can be incredibly difficult to pull off because they require the very best in special effects so as not to appear cheesy, and a rich lore that fans can sink their teeth into. Universally praised, The Witcher delivers on all counts. The show has been especially highlighted for its strong performances, which makes Cavill&rsquo;s departure after season 3 all the more disappointing. Liam Hemsworth will step in to play Geralt in The Witcher season 4, and he has big shoes to fill, but hopefully, fans will give him a fair shake. But regardless of the series&rsquo; future, The Witcher has three excellent seasons under its belt.</p>

<p>Stranger Things (2016-Present)</p>
<p>Stranger Things   Release Date   July 15, 2016    Cast   Finn Wolfhard , joe keery , Jamie Campbell Bower , Brett Gelman , Caleb McLaughlin , Maya Hawke , David Harbour , Matthew Modine , Priah Ferguson , Gaten Matarazzo , Winona Ryder , Charlie Heaton , Sadie Sink , Millie Bobby Brown , Joseph Quinn , Dacre Montgomery , Natalia Dyer , Noah Schnapp    Genres   Fantasy , Horror , Drama    Seasons   4</p>
<p>Along with House of Cards, Stranger Things is arguably the most important Netflix Original that the platform has ever released. Responsible for a huge uplift in interest in the streaming giant when it debuted in 2016, the horror fantasy blend perfectly blends Amblin-like 1980s nostalgia with an undeniable Stephen King vibe that proves to be a winning formula. With a twisty narrative that draws heavily on Dungeons &amp; Dragons lore, Stranger Things is a far more street level success than its high concept might suggest, mostly thanks to its excellent cast.</p>
<p>Trope-heavy, Stranger Things marries multiple genres in a heady blend that appeals across all genre quadrants: its horror is successfully creepy (particularly after the introduction of Vecna); its coming-of-age elements are pitch-perfect; and the plot never disappears under its own weight as other shows with such longevity like Lost and Heroes. Impressively, the show has successfully reinvented itself even as it escalates its original ideas and the upcoming Stranger Things season 5 is easily one of the most hotly anticipated TV seasons in recent memory.</p>

<p>Dark (2017-2020)</p>
<p>Dark   Release Date   December 1, 2017    Cast   Tamar Pelzig , Louis Hofmann , Moritz Jahn , Stephan Kampwirth , Christian Hutcherson , Karoline Eichhorn , Andreas Pietschmann , Maja Schöne , Deborah Kaufmann , Oliver Masucci , Jordis Triebel , Peter Benedict    Genres   Mystery , Drama , Crime    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Set in a small German town with a story that spans centuries, Dark is a compellingly complex thriller that easily ranks among the best Netflix shows. When the search for a missing child goes wrong, Dark transports the narrative to the past via a mysterious wormhole underneath a nuclear power plant. With the same actors playing characters across the span of time, the show becomes a surreal character study, exploring the trauma that shapes characters in the present, before suggesting what might await them in the future. With three seasons to enjoy, Dark is one of the most satisfying sci-fi series on the platform.</p>
<p>Dark may ask a lot of its audience (especially as the original German is undisputably the best way to watch it), but the reward is just as good. By the time you get to Dark&rsquo;s ending, you&rsquo;ll be exhausted and exhilarated, having been forced through an ordeal of philosophically challenging investigations that strike at the very heart of human existence.</p>

<p>The Umbrella Academy (2019-Present)</p>
<p>The Umbrella Academy   Release Date   February 15, 2019    Cast   Colm Feore , Cazzie David , Genesis Rodriguez , Robert Sheehan , Aidan Gallagher , elliot page , Emmy Raver-Lampman , Jordan Claire Robbins , Jake Epstein , Mary J. Blige , David Castaneda , Justin Cornwell , Justin H. Min , Britne Oldford , Adam Godley , Tom Hopper , Javon &lsquo;Wanna&rsquo; Walton , Ritu Arya , Cameron Britton , Sheila McCarthy    Genres   Adventure , Comedy , Action    Seasons   3</p>
<p>While Stranger Things is probably Netflix&rsquo;s more famous sci-fi-like ensemble cast show, The Umbrella Academy is even better, increasing in quality with each release. Based on the incredible comics series by My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way, the show deals with the small problem of the end of the world. Repeatedly. Centered on a group of exceptional misfits with the kind of superpowers you won&rsquo;t see in Marvel or DC Comics, The Umbrella Academy is as funny as it is subversive, exploring incredibly dark material while throwing in must-see dance numbers.</p>
<p>The character performances are delightful and irresistibly meme-able, and the looming shadow of destiny means there&rsquo;s barely time for a misplaced step or pause in the plot, which throws in some of the most unexpected twists you&rsquo;d ever imagine. And many you couldn&rsquo;t possibly. With The Umbrella Academy season 4 promising to bring the complex, time travel story to its inevitably explosive conclusion, there&rsquo;s still a lot to look forward to. Just make sure you&rsquo;re there for the ride by catching up first.</p>

Bridgerton (2020-Present)</p>
<p>Bridgerton   Release Date   December 25, 2020    Cast   Will Tilston , Rege-Jean Page , Ruth Gemmell , Luke Thompson , Isabella Cortese , Martins Imhangbe , Julie Andrews , Phoebe Dynevor , Ruby Stokes , Ruby Barker , Claudia Jessie , Adjoa Andoh , Nicola Coughlan , Golda Rosheuvel , Charithra Chandran , Ben Miller , Jonathan Bailey , Florence Hunt , Polly Walker , Shelley Conn , Joanna Bobin , Luke Newton , Simone Ashley    Genres   Romance , Drama    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Shonda Rhimes arrived with a bang on Netflix with Bridgerton, the first scripted show on the streaming platform from Shondaland, her production company. Based on the Julia Quinn novels of the same name, Bridgerton takes place in high-society Regency era London and centers upon the eponymous noble family. Each season focuses on one Bridgerton sibling falling passionately and vexingly in love while the anonymous writer Lady Whistledown reports the steamiest scandals of the ton in her scandal sheet.</p>
<p>Bridgerton prequel, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, is also available to stream on Netflix.</p>
<p>Bridgerton is famous for its steamy storylines and passionate love scenes, but they&rsquo;re also full of romance and heart, making it the perfect show for lovers of the genre. And while a period piece, Bridgerton is an alternate history show, as people of color are among the nobility, finally bringing the period genre into the 21st century.</p>

<p>Heartstopper (2022-Present)</p>
<p>Heartstopper   Release Date   April 22, 2022    Cast   Olivia Colman , Kit Connor , Rhea Norwood , Yasmin Finney , Cormac Hyde-Corrin , Stephen Fry , Tobie Donovan , William Gao , Sebastian Croft , Kizzy Edgell , Chetna Pandya , Joe Locke , Jenny Walser , Corinna Brown , Fisayo Akinade    Genres   Romance , Drama    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Created by Alice Oseman, and based on her webcomic and graphic novel of the same name, Heartstopper is a heartfelt British teen series about two high school boys, Nick (Kit Connor) and Charlie (Joe Locke), who fall in love with each other and form a romantic relationship. It also explores the boys&rsquo; other friends as they too come of age, explore their sexuality, and decide who they want to be in the world.</p>
<p>The show has been lauded for its positive representation, as it depicts many issues LGBTQ+ teens face, from being outed to discovering sexuality. Heartstopper also stands out from other teen shows because it doesn&rsquo;t base Nick, Charlie, or any of their friends&rsquo; experiences in suffering; rather, the show is a celebration of being young and in love, whatever the characters&rsquo; sexual orientations may be.</p>

The Fall Of The House Of Usher (2023)</p>
<p>The Fall of the House of Usher   Release Date   October 12, 2023    Cast   Carla Gugino , Bruce Greenwood , Mary McDonnell , Carl Lumbly , Samantha Sloyan , T&rsquo;Nia Miller , Rahul Kohli , Kate Siegel , Sauriyan Sapkota , Zach Gilford    Genres   Drama , Horror    Seasons   1</p>
<p>From The Haunting of Hill House to Midnight Mass, acclaimed horror director Mike Flanagan has become a Netflix mainstay, offering terrifying miniseries that promise to give viewers more than a few thrills every spooky season. Flanagan&rsquo;s 2023 contribution is The Fall of the House of Usher, based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe. The Fall of the House of Usher has a stacked ensemble cast full of Mike Flanagan actors who regularly show up in his work.</p>
<p>The drama centers around tyrannical pharmaceutical CEO Roderick Usher (Bruce Greenwood) who must contend with a demon haunting the family and killing off his children, the heirs to his company. With this premise, which could be described as Succession meets the slasher genre, Flanagan taps into the best of both worlds; with its themes of capitalism and greed, The Fall of the House of Usher entertainingly explores themes of greed, capitalism, and family dysfunction that are seen in many prestige dramas while the scares are chilling and memorable enough to strike fear into the heart of even the most seasoned horror fan.</p>

<p>Wednesday (2022-Present)
Wednesday   Release Date   November 16, 2022    Cast   Jenna Ortega , Catherine Zeta-Jones , Luis Guzman , Gwendoline Christie , Riki Lindhome , Jamie McShane , Christina Ricci , Hunter Doohan , Emma Myers , Joy Sunday    Genres   Comedy , Fantasy , Supernatural    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Based on the cartoons by Charles Addams, The Addams Family franchise has been gracing TV screens since the 1960s. The creepy and kooky family has also appeared in movies, and a young Christina Ricci is responsible for popularizing the macabre pig-tailed Addams daughter Wednesday when she first played her in The Addams Family (1991). And nobody was more perfect than Tim Burton to bring Wednesday Addams back to TV woth Wednesday. The series sees Jenna Ortega play the titular anti-heroine, as Wednesday is shipped off to the mysterious Nevermore Academy after she is expelled from public school. There, she must solve a decades-old murder mystery.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s impossible to say who&rsquo;s a better Wednesday between Ricci and Ortega, the latter roots the character firmly in Gen-Z while still maintaining Wednesday&rsquo;s dark, deadpan demeanor. Ortega&rsquo;s Emmy-nominated performance, along with Wednesday&rsquo;s talented supported cast make the Addams Family franchise feel as lively as it ever was, and the mystery at the core of season 1 makes Wednesday perfect for a binge-watch. Wednesday broke Netflix&rsquo;s record for most hours viewed in a week for an English-language series at 341.2 million hours, dethroning Stranger Things season 4.</p>
<pre><code>              Wednesday Cast &amp; Character Guide   Jenna Ortega leads Netflix's Wednesday, but she's backed by a strong supporting cast playing Addams Family characters, like Wednesday's mom Morticia.

<p>The Haunting Of Hill House (2018)</p>
<p>The Haunting of Hill House   Release Date   October 12, 2018    Cast   Michiel Huisman , Carla Gugino , Henry Thomas , Elizabeth Reaser , Oliver Jackson-Cohen , Kate Siegel , Victoria Pedretti , Lulu Wilson , Mckenna Grace    Genres   Drama , Supernatural , Horror    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Mike Flanagan&rsquo;s Netflix projects read like a best of the best horror releases of recent years, and The Haunting of Hill House is arguably the one that set the standard. Raising the bar for Netflix&rsquo;s best horror titles, The Haunting of Hill House relies on Flanagan&rsquo;s always excellent casting eye and ridiculously successful scare tactics to really leave a mark. And it&rsquo;s not just jump scares (though it has one of the best ever), as Flanagan&rsquo;s creative team builds an atmosphere of dread that is both nightmarish and compulsive viewing.</p>
<p>The Netflix show drew from Shirley Jackson&rsquo;s iconic novel, updating the source material and injecting new life (and death), into The Haunting of Hill House&rsquo;s story of the shared trauma of five children who grew up in the ominous house. Watch if you&rsquo;re a fan of good old-fashioned ghost stories, and expect a high chill factor. For good reason, The Haunting of Hill House remains among the best shows to watch on Netflix right now.</p>

Top Boy (2011–2023)</p>
<p>Top Boy   Release Date   2011-00-00    Cast   Ashley Walters    Main Genre   Crime    Genres   Thriller    Seasons   5</p>
<p>With the likes of Gangs of London and the near-iconic Peaky Blinders, the UK has a rich vein of recent crime TV shows, but Top Boy deserves just as much attention. Considered the British answer to The Wire, the comparison may seem generous from outside, but it&rsquo;s a fitting parallel: both shows deal with shifting power dynamics, the cut-throat world of underworld crime, and the relationships of the main characters and rivals.</p>
<p>Uneasy rivalries, stunning betrayals and often stunning performances punctuate everything, as Top Boy&rsquo;s cast was something of a proving ground for talents as rich as Benedict Wong, Laetitia Wright and Michaela Coel, with Barry Keoghan appearing briefly, but memorably. It&rsquo;s still incredible to think Channel 4 initially canceled Top Boy after just two seasons, but Netflix swooped in after rapper Drake led a campaign to boost the show. And everyone should be thankful for the fact.</p>

<p>Mindhunter (2017-2019)</p>
<p>Mindhunter   Release Date   October 13, 2017    Cast   Jonathan Groff , Holt McCallany , Hannah Gross , Cotter Smith , Anna Torv , Stacey Roca , Cameron Britton , Michael Cerveris , Joe Tuttle , Lauren Glazier    Genres   Crime , Drama , Thriller    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mindhunter&rsquo;s development story might be one of the most frustrating tales of missed opportunity in TV history, as the show was given only a disappointingly short run. That said, the disappointment is directly correlated to just how great the Netflix Original series is. Offering true crime fans the irresistible prospect of seeing some of real-life history&rsquo;s most notorious serial killers, Mindhunter charts the rise of the FBI&rsquo;s dedicated serial murder department (Quantico&rsquo;s Behavioral Science Unit). Far more than a who&rsquo;s who of killers, the show&rsquo;s exploration of the personal relationships of the main characters and their struggles adds huge depth.</p>
<p>Drawing on creator David Fincher&rsquo;s movies, Mindhunter is compellingly dark, exploring the depths of human depravity without edging into exploitation. If you&rsquo;re a fan of The Silence of the Lambs, or Se7en, or movies of that ilk, Mindhunter is a must-see, particularly thanks to the unnervingly precise portrayals of some of the most notorious serial killers ever.</p>

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off (2023)</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off   Release Date   November 17, 2023    Cast   Michael Cera , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Satya Bhabha , Kieran Culkin , Anna Kendrick , Brie Larson , Alison Pill , Aubrey Plaza , Brandon Routh , Jason Schwartzman    Genres   Animation , Action , Adventure , Comedy    Seasons   1</p>
<p>With its eye-popping visuals, irreverent sense of humor, and one of the most stacked casts of the 2010s, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a veritable cult hit, and it&rsquo;s back in an alternate reality animated sequel series, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Much to fans&rsquo; delight, the cast of the original live-action movie have reprised their roles. In Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, Scott (Michael Cera) must still defeat the seven evil exes to win the object of his affection, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). This time, however, Scott seemingly fatally loses his battle against Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha). But when Ramona finds out Scott might still be alive, she sets out on a quest to find him.</p>
<p>Both the Scott Pilgrim TV show and movie are based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O&rsquo;Malley, and while the movie&rsquo;s visuals give it a cartoon feel, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off actually is a cartoon, and is thus able to evoke such delight with the feats of imagery it pulls off. Many fans agree that Scott, though likable, is possibly the least interesting element in his own story, so putting Ramona front and center is a welcome way to freshen up this beloved franchise.</p>

<p>Big Mouth (2017-Present)</p>
<p>Big Mouth   Release Date   September 29, 2017    Cast   Fred Armisen , Jessi Klein , Nick Kroll , Ayo Edebiri , Jenny Slate , Andrew Rannells , Jordan Peele , John Mulaney , Maya Rudolph , Jason Mantzoukas    Genres   Romance , Animation , Comedy    Seasons   6</p>
<p>With bodies changing at an uncontrollable rate and hormones running wild, experiencing puberty can often feel like living the life of a cartoon character, and Big Mouth takes this concept literally. Nick Kroll&rsquo;s hilarious animated Netflix series follows a group of middle schoolers as they experience adolescence, many with the guide of their &ldquo;hormone monsters&rdquo; — creatures who offer advice and guidance based on their charge&rsquo;s hormonal temperament.</p>
<p>Big Mouth is raunchy and vulgar, but it&rsquo;s every bit as sweet as it is salty. It&rsquo;s a sex- and body-positive show that refuses to sanitize puberty, which is often incredibly messy business, both literally and figuratively. The animated nature of the show allows Big Mouth to really explore what these young teenagers are going through, all while treating them with kindness. The series may be called Big Mouth, but it&rsquo;s also got a big heart.</p>

<p>For a show about a talking horse, BoJack Horseman can be almost too real. Will Arnett stars as the titular anthropomorphic protagonist, a has-been actor famous for starring in a &rsquo;90s sitcom. Wanting to stage a comeback, BoJack plans to write an autobiography with the help of ghostwriter Diane Nguyen (Alison Brie). This forces BoJack to confront his failures, demons, and a whole lot of existential dread.</p>
<p>Adult animated shows have been popular since the 2000s, and while many of them are over-the-top and outrageous, BoJack Horseman is one of the more grounded offerings, despite its surreal premise. BoJack Horseman tackles many serious, real-life issues with such authenticity it can be uncomfortable to watch, but the show maintains its acerbic sense of humor throughout. There&rsquo;s truly no show like it, and it&rsquo;s one of the best on Netflix.</p>

<p>The Great British Baking Show   Release Date   August 17, 2010    Cast   Paul Hollywood , Mary Berry , Noel Fielding , Prue Leith    Seasons   14</p>
<p>Reality TV is perhaps the most maligned genre of television. Many dismiss it as trashy and salacious, and there are a lot of shows that prove the naysayers right, but that&rsquo;s where The Great British Baking Show (also known as The Great British Bake Off) shines. It&rsquo;s not about gossip, backstabbing, or sabotage — it&rsquo;s a sweet show about amateur bakers competing in a series of challenges for judges.</p>
<p>With its warmth and kind-spiritedness, The Great British Baking Show makes for the perfect cozy binge-watch. While there is competition, it is extremely low-stakes, as there is no cash prize at the end — the winner is gifted with a cake stand and a bouquet of flowers. The Great British Baking Show celebrates people trying their best, and that&rsquo;s what makes it so special and endearing.</p>
