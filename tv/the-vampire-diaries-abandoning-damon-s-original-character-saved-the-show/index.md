## Literature Review
Damon Salvatore is The Vampire Diaries season 1’s main antagonist. However, if his character did not change the show would not have lasted as long.




Damon Salvatore underwent a notable character transformation on the CW show The Vampire Diaries following season 1, a change that played a crucial role in the show&#39;s longevity and remarkable success. Adapted from L. J. Smith&#39;s book series, The Vampire Diaries was developed into a supernatural teen drama television show by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec. The series premiered in 2009 and concluded in 2017, spanning eight seasons and 171 episodes. The Vampire Diaries cast continuously changed and expanded throughout the eight seasons, but the central focus remained on the relationship between vampire brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore.




The story starts with Elena Gilbert, who is sucked into the supernatural world of Mystic Falls following the loss of her parents. As the series progresses, a love triangle forms between the two brothers and Elena. Damon is originally the main antagonist in season 1, as he strives to find and release Katherine Pierce from her tomb. However, after The Vampire Diaries season 1, his character changes considerably. This pivotal change contributed to the show&#39;s sustained popularity and success.



At the time of writing this article, The Vampire Diaries is available to watch on Max and Peacock.





 Damon Was A Totally Different Character In The Vampire Diaries Season 1 
         

While Damon is well known in The Vampire Diaries as the end-game partner for Elena and a reliable ally in times of trouble, his character didn&#39;t start that way in season 1. The elder vampire brother initially served as the primary antagonist, whose main purpose is to return to Mystic Falls and free Katherine Pierce. In his pursuit of the woman he fell in love with in 1864, Damon wreaked havoc in Mystic Falls through acts of killing, maiming, and transforming civilians into vampires.




In The Vampire Diaries season 1, episode 1, Damon brutally murders a couple camping in the woods. In the episode &#34;You&#39;re Undead to Me,&#34; he kills his nephew, Zach Salvatore, because he wants to prove he has no sense of humanity left. Throughout season 1, Damon manipulates Caroline Forbes, compelling her to do what he wants, sleeping with her, and using her as a blood bag. Damon&#39;s torment extends to his brother Stefan, as he kills his best friend Lexi. With all of these villainous characteristics that Damon has in The Vampire Diaries season 1, the show would have been unsustainable if Damon had not reconciled with his brother. 



 The Vampire Diaries Couldn&#39;t Have Lasted As Long Without Changing Damon 
          

Damon was originally the reckless Salvatore brother in The Vampire Diaries, but as the story continued, he evolved into more of an anti-hero and trusted friend of the core group of characters. If the show had kept Damon as the antagonist, it&#39;s unlikely that it would have lasted eight seasons. Despite the love triangle, the core of The Vampire Diaries lies in the love and lives of the Salvatore brothers. The show chronicles their lives throughout time, starting when they were humans back in the late 1800s. This is when they both fell in love with the same woman, paving the way for them to become vampires.




Then The Vampire Diaries followed them through time as the brothers carried animosity towards one another over the years, and then, as the narrative develops, it sees them come together. Even when Elena left The Vampire Diaries, the show managed another two seasons, as it continued its focus on Damon and Stefan as they confronted supernatural entities in Mystic Falls. The enduring theme centers around the profound bond between the two brothers. Without this central relationship, The Vampire Diaries would not have lasted as long as it did.



 How Abandoning Damon&#39;s Season 1 Character Changed The Vampire Diaries 
          

Having Damon as the main antagonist of The Vampire Diaries season 1 effectively established the strained relationship between Damon and Stefan. The main reason for their hatred for one another was their shared relationship with Katherine. At the end of season 1, Katherine is freed from the tomb and shows her ability to impersonate her doppelgänger, Elena, successfully fooling Damon as well as Elena&#39;s biological father, John Gilbert. This plot development not only introduced a new villain but also initiated a shift in Damon&#39;s character to become a more compassionate and likable person.




This transformation allowed the series to redirect its focus on the gradual rebuilding of the Salvatore brothers&#39; relationship. The series finale of The Vampire Diaries even ends with Damon greeting Stefan in the afterlife with &#34;Hello, brother,&#34; the same words he said to him in the pilot. This moment underlines the ongoing focus of the show, proving the series always had to rebuild the brothers&#39; relationship in order to make The Vampire Diaries a success. Without changing Damon&#39;s character after The Vampire Diaries season 1, the show would not have endured for as long as did, as the success of the series relied on the loving relationship between Damon and Stefan.
