## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda refuses to get married to Gino Palazzolo. She has made these threats before, but her latest one is more serious.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Jasmine Pineda found a new outrageous reason to cancel her wedding to Gino Palazzolo. Jasmine and Gino first appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5 when they met each other in person for the first time. It became clear that Gino was supporting Jasmine financially. After all, they had met on a sugar baby dating platform and Jasmine expected Gino to fulfill her every whim and fancy. Gino&#39;s family asked him to be cautious of Jasmine&#39;s motives. Gino and Jasmine&#39;s relationship took a serious turn when they got engaged, and she came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa.




A 90 Day Fiancé season 10, episode 11, preview clip by ET shows Jasmine and Gino on a beach in Miami.


 

Jasmine is so impressed by Miami that she is thinking of getting married on the beach. &#34;I could get dressed in my bikini,&#34; she said. Gino joked that it&#39;s cheaper than a wedding dress but said that it can&#39;t happen because his family won&#39;t be there. &#34;I still don&#39;t feel comfortable with the idea of your family going to our wedding,&#34; Jasmine bluntly told Gino. Jasmine said, &#34;If your family goes to the wedding, I&#39;m not getting married.&#34; Jasmine reminded Gino about how bad her first meeting with his family was in the U.S.

Jasmine didn&#39;t like Gino&#39;s cousin Dana taking him to the strip club or Tony asking Gino to get a prenup. Jasmine seemed bitter about Gino&#39;s nephew telling her she had to be &#34;grateful&#34; because Gino had brought her to America. Gino defended his family, saying they were just trying to get to know her better. However, Jasmine also blamed Gino for being &#34;mysterious.&#34; She was suspicious about what happened at the bachelor party since Gino had texted his family to not let Jasmine know that they&#39;d been to the strip club. Jasmine is not interested in having the same people who proposed the prenup idea attend her wedding.

Jasmine and Gino were visiting the city after they fought over his visit to a strip club and Jasmine threw away her ring. However, in usual Jasmine and Gino fashion, the couple got back together and are now making wedding plans. Jasmine expected Gino to have a bachelor party when she was with him in the States. However, Gino went to a strip club the day before Jasmine&#39;s arrival. Considering how much Gino was spending on Jasmine for things such as her hair, surgeries and rent, Gino&#39;s family worried about his future.




Gino was digging into his savings to cater to Jasmine&#39;s needs even when he was unemployed. In 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Gino quit his job to make Jasmine feel more comfortable in the U.S. Jasmine is against this decision as well. She worried about how Gino would be able to bring her two sons and her younger sister to America. It&#39;s starting to look like not only is Jasmine with Gino for his money, but she&#39;s also trying to alienate him from his family so he can give his undivided attention to her.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
