## Literature Review

Netflix&#39;s Magic For Humans needs an explanation of how the tricks are performed and how legitimate people&#39;s reactions are.





Magic for Humans is a Netflix show about how one stage magician, Justin Willman, goes to the street to get genuine reactions from a passerby about his tricks. He may sometimes play these for laughs, discuss psychological studies with marshmallows, or discuss Justin&#39;s phantom limb trick with kids. Netflix released season 3 in 2020, with more illusions and stunts. Some go beyond the marshmallow trial, which is pretty questionable; in one, Justin performs card tricks after eating a ghost pepper. However, is it real or fake?

TV Guide goes into the details about the allegations. The Magic for Humans star Justin was accused of using actors and green screens for his stunts. Justin denies the claims and says that his tapings instead have ample rehearsal to prepare for technical difficulties and astounding feats. He cites that Harry Houdini had a trick similar to the one Justin did in Magic for Humans season 1 for pulling his wife out of a bag.

To the onlooker, this line of inquiry seems silly to accuse a film magician of doing tricks to further Justin&#39;s illusion. Stage magic, by nature, requires a suspension of disbelief; the audience knows that they are viewing a magic trick. People can float with technology but can&#39;t fly via sheer force of will. The joy comes from not knowing how it&#39;s done; some feats are death-defying. People have died trying to recreate the escapes and tricks of those like Harry Houdini or David Copperfield, and sometimes, it&#39;s the luck of the draw that they avoid sharp nails.

With Netflix, viewers do not see the trick done at a magicians&#39; camp or in a club but rather filmed ahead of time. A magician needs to find different ways to find their audience in the age of television on-demand as it diminished interest in stunts and sleight-of-hand. Artists have even turned simple decks of cards into stories about magicians. An onlooker wants to be entertained, to see traditional stage tricks translated to the big screen.




Justin is a showman and a magician; between 2010 and 2016, Justin hosted Cupcake Wars on the Food Network. That means entertaining the contestants, the judges, and the viewers; it is no easy feat. Magic for Humans relies on his charm and charisma to win over the visible audience on-camera and the invisible viewer beyond his tangible reach. Justin can make a donut challenge seem cruel and hilarious at the same time.

The more significant concern is that the passerby&#39;s reactions may or may not be genuine and that the show&#39;s premise is misleading. If that is the case, then Netflix has to do damage control to reassure its audience that the tricks are fake and the reactions just as much. They need to roll out the disclaimers and backpedal on the pitch that they see &#34;real&#34; people on the streets. However, it doesn&#39;t seem to have impacted the popularity of Magic For Humans.



Magic For Humans is available for streaming on Netflix.
