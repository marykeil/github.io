## Literature Review
Walker Scobell has been praised as Percy, but one story behind Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4&#39;s water scene makes him an even better fit.




Warning: This article contains spoilers for Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 4Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 introduces a key moment in Percy&#39;s journey, and the backstory behind what went into that scene makes Walker Scobell even better as the titular character. Major Percy Jackson story reveals in episode 4 range from Grover sharing he wants to find Pan to Echidna and the Chimera&#39;s introduction. Additionally, the dynamic between Percy and Annabeth and their views on the gods take a front seat in the episode&#39;s narrative.




Aside from this, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4&#39;s details help develop Percy&#39;s skills and journey. Since arriving at Camp Half-Blood, Percy has undergone many changes, including tests of his physical stature and endurance. From the weapons training where he found archery was not his strong suit to the practice of battle strategy using Medusa&#39;s severed head to defeat Alecto, Percy&#39;s growth is evident with each new episode. Episode 4&#39;s river scene is a true testament to Walker Scobell&#39;s strengths as the young demigod.

                  How Many Episodes Percy Jackson Season 1 Has Left &amp; When The Finale Is   Percy Jackson and the Olympians is already over halfway through season 1 on Disney&#43;, with only a few more outings to go before the finale.    


 Walker Scobell Perfected Swordsmanship &amp; Diving To Play Percy Jackson 
          




In the spirit of dedication to the worthy adaptation Rick Riordan aimed for, Walker Scobell underwent intense Percy training. Naturally, Scobell had to practise using a sword since Riptide is his character&#39;s primary magical weapon. The young actor did, in fact, master swordsmanship so well that he even had to tone it down for filming. Riordan explains, &#34;[Scobell] had gotten so good at swordplay that he had to remember how to do it badly for [the capture-the-flag scene] because his character hasn&#39;t learned how to fight very well&#34; (via TV Insider).

This highlights how quickly Scobell picked up on new skills to portray Percy accurately. One area - underwater training - was particularly useful for episode 4 during Percy&#39;s river scene. Scobell was able to obtain his junior diver&#39;s license thanks to his rigorous training (via Teen Vogue). He shares, &#34;There were a lot of wetsuits and gear to keep me cold from being wet, and I don’t think I understood how much I would be wet throughout the series.&#34; Evidently, Percy has just scratched the surface when it comes to manipulating water during combat, and the river scene in episode 4 puts all Scobell&#39;s diving training on full display.






 Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Episode 4&#39;s River Scene Highlights How Important Scobell&#39;s Training Was 
         

Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 ends with Percy falling from the Gateway Arch in St. Louis while fighting Echidna and the memorable Percy Jackson monster, the Chimera. As he falls, a tunnel of water from the nearby river engulfs Percy and starts a roughly one-and-a-half minute underwater scene. During this, Percy dives, tries to free his trapped foot, is seemingly very deep beneath the water, tries and swim upward, and eventually visibly takes a deep breath. Given that divers are trained to withstand longer periods underwater, Scobell&#39;s training was crucial to facilitating his acting in this scene.

Additionally, the river scene is a shock to Percy&#39;s system as he visibly panics, which naturally affects breathing poorly. Meeting a sea nymph sparks his confusion during this stressful situation, but her aid introduces one of Percy&#39;s special abilities as Poseidon&#39;s son. She instructs him to breathe, which he does effortlessly after calming down. Breathing underwater increases his strength as a demigod and expands his skill set, which will undoubtedly give him a major advantage for future fights involving water. Moreover, Percy&#39;s introduction to a sea nymph, known as a Nereid, adjusts the course of his journey.




                  Percy Jackson Episode 4’s Villain Makes A 19-Year-Old Book Mystery Even More Frustrating   Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 4&#39;s ending leaves one Lightning Thief villain mystery still unanswered after 19 years.    



 What The Water Nymph In Percy Jackson And The Olympians Suggests For Percy’s Journey 
          

Percy reiterates his disdain for Poseidon in episode 4 when he tells Annabeth that he doesn&#39;t want anything from his father, and that Poseidon&#39;s missed his chance to be there for him. This belief that Poseidon is an absent father is almost immediately challenged when Percy is saved from his fall and visited by the Nereid, a messenger of Poseidon. The Nereid tells Percy that Poseidon is always around, indicating he is willing to intervene when he deems it fit to do so.

Plus, the Nereid helping Percy unlock his underwater breathing skill creates a similarity between Poseidon and Sally. In the beginning of episode 4, Sally tries teaching a young Percy to swim, and he reminds her that she always tells him to breathe and that she&#39;ll always be there. The Nereid relaying Poseidon&#39;s message mirrors Sally&#39;s advice. This suggests Poseidon&#39;s care for Percy is not far from Sally&#39;s, despite his distance. Moreover, this complicates Percy&#39;s perception of the gods, but mostly his father, which could alter how his journey and relationships develop throughout the rest of Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
