## Literature Review
The Ted TV show breaks a Rotten Tomatoes record for the franchise with its audience score, cementing the series as a memorable new entry.




The Ted TV series has broken a Rotten Tomatoes record for the franchise, proving itself as a memorable entry in the comedy series. A prequel to the original films starring Mark Whalberg, the streaming series is set in 1993, focusing on John and Ted&#39;s early years in high school. Every episode sees the pair getting into new situations, utilizing the same form of crude humor that made the films so popular.




That popularity has seemingly translated to the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for the Ted TV series, which sits at 83% as of writing. This breaks a franchise record for highest audience score, which was previously held by the original movie at 73%. However, with only around 50 ratings so far, this score could go higher or lower in the future - but it is a good sign for how viewers received the show.


 Why Audiences Love The Ted Show 
          

Despite taking place 20 years before the original movie, the Ted series maintains the same mixture of vulgar and goofy humor that made the first entry so memorable. It also features new characters like John&#39;s cousin Blaire and father Matty, who get further developed as the series progresses. The show&#39;s episodes also reveal how the best friends become the people they are in the movies, such as exploring their first experience with drugs.




Since there are 7 episodes in season 1, there are plenty of comedic adventures the pair go on that fans of the original will enjoy. The amount of content may have contributed to the high score, especially given the major focus on hilarious, boundary-pushing scenarios. Since Ted himself is still portrayed by Seth McFarlane, the show&#39;s signature character makes it feel as if the franchise never left.

If the series becomes successful thanks to positive word of mouth, it&#39;s possible a Ted season 2 could be on the horizon. There could also be a renewed interest in the franchise as a whole, prompting the production of another theatrical entry in the series. With the show having only been released on January 11, there&#39;s still plenty of time for it to gain even more traction.



All episodes of Ted are now streaming on Peacock.
