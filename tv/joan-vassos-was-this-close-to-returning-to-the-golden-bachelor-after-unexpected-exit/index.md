## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor contestant and fan favorite, Joan Vassos, was very close to returning to the show to continue to compete for Gerry Turner&#39;s heart.




Beloved The Golden Bachelor contestant Joan Vassos had to leave the reality dating series early due to a family matter, but she now reveals that she was very close to returning to the show to continue her journey. Joan decided to leave The Golden Bachelor to return home after receiving a phone call from her daughter who was experiencing postpartum depression. Joan and Gerry had been building a strong connection, but he understood why she had to leave. Gerry wept after Joan left. On &#34;The Women Tell All&#34; special, Joan admitted that she imagined that Gerry would show up in her hometown because they had unfinished business.




In an interview with The Wrap, Joan revealed that she was going to return to The Golden Bachelor after helping her daughter. Joan explained that first she &#34;needed to get her some mental health care.&#34; Joan went on to say that while she was in the process of doing that, the show invited her back, and production even booked her a flight. She said, &#34;I was going to come back, maybe four or five days after I left. And then my daughter wasn’t good again. We just hadn’t made it far enough — I hadn’t gotten her a doctor yet; I had calls in, but it just couldn’t unfold quick enough.&#34;

Joan shared her daughter is doing better now, but her recovery took longer than anticipated. Joan realized that her return to the show, &#34;wasn&#39;t in the cards.&#34; Joan also revealed that she enjoyed her time with her fellow Golden Bachelor contestants. She said, &#34;I felt like I found my tribe. I found these people that were just like me, and I haven’t had that since my husband had passed away, and leaving them was as hard as it was leaving Gerry, honestly.&#34; Since Joan&#39;s daughter is doing better, and she really cherished her experience with the show, perhaps she could have a second chance by becoming the first lead of The Golden Bachelorette.





 

Joan&#39;s Golden Bachelor story was relatable and heartbreaking. She and Gerry had such a strong relationship, but she put her daughter first, which was very admirable. Gerry understood why Joan left because he&#39;s very close to his family as well. If Joan had returned to the show, it seems that their deep connection could&#39;ve led to a lasting relationship, but, as Joan said, it just wasn&#39;t meant to be. However, now that Joan&#39;s daughter is doing better, perhaps she could take on the role of the Golden Bachelorette.

Joan, a 60-year-old school administrator from Rockville, Maryland, would be the perfect star of The Golden Bachelorette. She&#39;s beautiful, kind, and soft-spoken. She&#39;s a good listener, and empathetic toward other people. Joan&#39;s willingness to open up to Gerry shows that she&#39;s ready to find the next great love of her life. After giving so much to others, Joan deserves a wonderful relationship and some magic in her life. She was a bright light on The Golden Bachelor, and would be an extraordinary lead of The Golden Bachelorette.
