# The Harry Potter Reboot Show Can Capture Christmas At Hogwarts Even Better Than The Movies


## SUMMARY 



  HBO&#39;s Harry Potter TV show has the opportunity to focus more on the holiday at Hogwarts, including Christmas celebrations.   The TV show can have Christmas specials and other holiday episodes, offering greater creative freedom to the writers.   The show&#39;s release schedule could align with the real-world holiday season, potentially releasing a Christmas episode around the same time.

## Literature Review
The Christmas scenes in the Harry Potter movies are kept quite brief, but HBO&#39;s upcoming TV show could dedicate entire episodes to the holiday.




While the Harry Potter movies include brief Christmas sequences, HBO&#39;s upcoming TV show has the chance to focus much more on the holiday at Hogwarts. Due to the calendar of the fictional school, many students at Hogwarts celebrated Christmas. However, the festive scenes in the Harry Potter books and the movies rarely offered much narrative substance. The story&#39;s new format on TV screens makes it possible for Harry&#39;s Christmas period to become much more meaningful.




The Harry Potter books were adapted into a series of eight movies that were released between 2001 and 2011. As the books grew longer, more had to be removed from their on-screen counterparts. Due to their questionable relevancy to the plot, the Hogwarts Christmas sequences were among those that were shortened or cut from the movies. HBO&#39;s Harry Potter TV show would allow much more screen time per book, so Christmas at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry doesn&#39;t need to be rushed.

                  10 Biggest Challenges Harry Potter&#39;s TV Remake Must Overcome   The Harry Potter TV remake has the potential of being great, but there are various factors working against it, including the franchise&#39;s popularity.    


 HBO&#39;s Harry Potter TV Show Can Have Christmas Specials

While all the Christmas sequences from the Harry Potter books became little more than a condensed scene in many of the movie adaptations, the TV show reboot can embrace the tradition of a Christmas special. Addressing the holiday too heavily in the Harry Potter movies would likely have affected their pacing. That said, HBO&#39;s upcoming TV version of the Harry Potter saga has the chance to focus on Hogwarts&#39; festive celebrations for an entire episode per season, or possibly even two.




Despite not being a Christmas franchise, the Harry Potter movies have earned a reputation for being good viewing around the holidays. HBO&#39;s reboot utilizing Christmas specials as part of their schedule would serve as a nice acknowledgment of this unofficial association between Harry Potter and the holidays. However, the tone of the specials would likely change in later Harry Potter seasons, with the main trio being away from Hogwarts during the holidays.

Christmas isn&#39;t the only holiday that could be improved by Harry Potter&#39;s transition from the big to the small screen. For instance, Halloween is another notable date in the Hogwarts calendar. As such, the TV show could also have Halloween specials, a trope well-suited to a fantasy franchise such as Harry Potter. There are even scenes in the books where Valentine&#39;s Day is openly celebrated at the school, although this would arguably be less interesting to focus on for an entire episode.



 Harry Potter Christmas Specials Could Mean Greater Creative Freedom Than The Movies Had

Due to the Christmas scenes often slowing the plot in Harry Potter, the TV show&#39;s writers will likely need to alter them, fleshing them out to make a special episode worthwhile. The Harry Potter movies were largely very faithful to J. K. Rowling&#39;s original work. However, special Christmas episodes would give the show&#39;s writers the chance to flex their creative muscles. Doing so would afford them the chance to contribute to the expansive Harry Potter universe during these festive installments.

For example, Hermione Granger had years when she did not stay at Hogwarts Castle for Christmas with Ron and Harry. As a result, she vanished from the story for a brief while. A Christmas Special, especially one set during the events of the first book, could include a story that shows what Hermione got up to in her time away from school, though her actions would need to be compelling enough to justify the additions being made to the story.



 The Format Of A Harry Potter TV Show Lends Itself To A Christmas Special

The traditional TV season tends to run from September through to the following May. While HBO&#39;s streaming service isn&#39;t beholden to this framework, lining up their release schedule for the Harry Potter show with something resembling this structure could benefit them. Because Hogwarts adheres to the standard school calendar, starting the show in September would also signal the beginning of the school&#39;s term in the world of Harry Potter. As a result, a Christmas episode could be arranged for release around the same time as the holiday in the real world.

                  Every Christmas Present Harry Potter Got In The Series, Ranked   Christmas is a big part of the Harry Potter movies - and so are the gifts that he gets, including those only in the books.     

However, HBO doesn&#39;t tend to make overly long seasons of their shows. For instance, The Last of Us season 1 ran for nine episodes, and Game of Thrones seasons 1-6 ran for ten episodes each. Therefore, a weekly release for a Harry Potter TV show that starts in September would be unlikely to reach Christmas at all. To rectify this, Max would likely need to start airing a 10-episode run of Harry Potter sometime around November. This way, a Christmas special could line up with the holiday in the world of the show.






The Harry Potter movies are available to stream on Max. The TV show reboot of the franchise has yet to be given an official release date.
