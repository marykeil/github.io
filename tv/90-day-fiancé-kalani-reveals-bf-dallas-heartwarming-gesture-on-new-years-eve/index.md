## Literature Review
Kalani Faagata rings in the New Year with Dallas. The 90 Day Fiancé star reveals how her new boyfriend made her feel special at midnight.




Kalani Faagata from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise shared how she and her boyfriend Dallas celebrated their first New Year together. The 35-year-old Orange County woman was previously in a relationship with her husband, Asuelu Pulaa. She loved him and wanted to stay by his side. Unfortunately, Asuelu crossed the line when he repeatedly cheated on Kalani over the last few years. He didn’t learn from his mistakes and kept hurting her until she decided to do the same and cheat on him. In 90 Day: The Last Resort, Kalani revealed she slept with another man named Dallas, who later became her boyfriend.




Kalani is in a healthy relationship with Dallas. She loves to flaunt him on social media and show he makes her happier than ever. Most recently, the single mom shared an Instagram story showing her new man’s romantic gesture towards her. Kalani posted a photo of his hand and revealed that he wished her Happy New Year at midnight.

          

Kalani wrote, “he took his lunch break to kiss me at 12,” adding loving face emojis and hearts. She didn’t take a shot at Asuelu and showed grace by not comparing her beau to anyone else.

 Kalani &amp; Dallas’ Relationship Explained 
Kalani met Dallas sometime after Asuelu gave her a hall pass to kiss another man. While she could’ve easily done that and moved on, she decided to form a relationship with Dallas and keep dating him. In 90 Day: The Last Resort, Kalani almost reconciled with Asuelu and blocked Dallas’ number. However, Dallas kept pursuing her, which inspired her to follow him back. Kalani and her new man got into a serious relationship right after the spin-off. The two have since dated, and Dallas has even met Kalani’s kids and family.




It is great to see that Kalani is in a healthy relationship after her gut-wrenching breakup with Asuelu. She lacked the confidence to pursue another man due to her limited dating history before marriage. She had only ever slept with Asuelu, which made it hard for her to even think about infidelity. Fortunately, Kalani discovered her self-worth once Asuelu gave her the option of a hall pass. She realized that he never really loved her but simply used her as a wife and the mother of his children.

Kalani has all the right to flaunt her new boyfriend on social media and make her critics jealous. Previously, Asuelu rarely ever acted romantically or made any gestures for her. However, Dallas is extremely romantic and fulfills her emotional and physical needs. Kalani is finally in love and feels like it as well. She posts about her new boyfriend because he has really become an important part of her life. Previously, many critics accused Kalani of counter-cheating Asuelu. However, the 90 Day Fiancé alum didn’t engage in infidelity; she simply fell in love.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
