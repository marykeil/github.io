## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Asuelu Pulaa reportedly revealed he was deported and was back in Samoa. Kalani Faagata decided to divorce him during The Last Resort.




90 Day Fiancé fans fear Asuelu Pulaa may have been deported after his split with Kalani Faagata on 90 Day: The Last Resort. Asuelu is a 28-year-old from Samoa who got married to Kalani, 37, in season 6. Asuelu and Kalaniu had met during her vacation in Samoa while he was 23, and she was a virgin. They welcomed their first son before he moved to the U.S. and Kalani was pregnant during their wedding. Kalani and Asuelu had an unhappy married life where she kept blaming him for not being a good father or husband. In The Last Resort, Kalani finally revealed that Asuelu had cheated on her throughout the relationship.




Kalani decided she would divorce Asuelu during the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off and made her relationship with Dallas Nuez Instagram official. Meanwhile, Reddit user u/namast_eh (as shared by TVSeasonSpoilers) claims Asuelu did a TikTok live where he said, &#34;he’d got deported because his papers expired.&#34; The fan wanted to know if anyone else had heard about Asuelu getting deported. They asked what it would mean &#34;for the kids and custody.&#34; Redditor nowyouoweme asked if Asuelu was crying. &#34;This is sad for Asuelu. Have a heart,&#34; wrote Zosoflower while adding that Asuelu being deported would leave his two sons feeling devastated.

 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Asuelu Is Still In America 
          




However, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Asuelu recently shared photos of himself clicked at Painted Desert Golf Club in Las Vegas. Asuelu captioned the post, &#34;Golf too much with these O.G’s haha&#34; referring to his friends who joined him while golfing. Asuelu&#39;s comments were from people who complimented his looks and loved that he was &#34;thriving.&#34; Someone even called Asuelu &#34;handsome.&#34; Asuelu did not share any updates about his deportation claims on his IG. He appears to be still living in Las Vegas. Asuelu moved there in July 2023.


 

Asuelu had posted about going to Samoa in October 2022. It was while there were rumors of Asuelu and Kalani&#39;s split. The couple had unfollowed each other on Instagram and stopped posting about each other as well. Asuelu had claimed he was single sometime in June 2022. Kalani and Asuelu&#39;s home in Utah had been put for sale in the same month. Kalani found herself a house in California. Asuelu cheated on Kalani when he was in Samoa. He came back and gave her a hall pass, so she could go and kiss someone else. Asuelu didn&#39;t know that Kalani had met Dallas on social media and started having an affair with him behind Asuelu&#39;s back.




Kalani had had enough of Asuelu&#39;s lies and cheating. She recently accused her of abusing her and made disturbing claims about him. Kalani finally looks happy now that she is with Dallas. She doesn&#39;t need to hide her relationship from the world, even though she is continuing to hide Dallas&#39; face from 90 Day Fiancé viewers. In all likeliness, Asuelu was lying to fans about being deported or simply trying to get their attention.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
