  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Historical figures in
Doctor Who
provide entertaining narratives and often carry important moral messages.
From Charles Dickens to Queen Victoria, historical figures have played prominent roles in the modern era of
Doctor Who
.
The interactions between the Doctor and historical figures like Agatha Christie and Winston Churchill have had significant impacts on the show&rsquo;s storylines.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Since Doctor Who&rsquo;s reboot in 2005, the Doctor has crossed paths with many prominent names from human history, both on-screen and mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>Across the entirety of time and space, the Doctor has met several historical figures in Doctor Who. Since the show&rsquo;s reboot in 2005, there have been both on-screen appearances of and references made by the Doctor to notable names from real-life history. With Doctor Who season 14 airing in May 2024, and the reveal of an episode that will involve the Beatles, it&rsquo;s hoped that more historical figures will feature in the show.
Some characters are unable to be accurately portrayed appearance-wise, especially those from so long ago that their description has been marked over time. Despite this, their narratives are often still entertaining and sometimes come with an important moral message. Whether it&rsquo;s as a friend, foe, or simply on the sidelines, historical figures in Doctor Who have been prominent in the modern era.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens In &ldquo;The Unquiet Dead&rdquo;
The Ninth Doctor meets the author in Doctor Who season 1, episode 3.</p>
<p>Three episodes into the reboot series, Doctor Who&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Unquiet Dead&rdquo; sees the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) encounter Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol author Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) in Victorian Cardiff. The interpretation of Dickens here is fascinating, and although the author is at times rude and almost cowardly, the Doctor is still in amazement about meeting him. The events of this episode are implied to have inspired Dickens&rsquo; sending for The Mystery of Edwin Drood. However, in real life, the book was never finished, as Dickens died the following year.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria In &ldquo;Tooth And Claw&rdquo;
The Tenth Doctor meets the royal figure in Doctor Who season 2, episode 2.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria (Pauline Collins) is the first historical figure that the Tenth Doctor meets on-screen, alongside Rose, in the season 2 episode &ldquo;Tooth and Claw.&rdquo; While it&rsquo;s a brilliant experience for the Time Lord, he is unaware that their meeting sets up a chain of events that impact not only the rest of the season but also the lives of his companions, both past and present. Following the events of the episode, Queen Victoria ensures the creation of the Torchwood Institute, a secret organization that will cause Rose to become stuck in a parallel world, but will also one day leave Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) its sole and final employee.</p>
<p>Madame De Pompadour &amp; Louis XV In &ldquo;The Girl In The Fireplace&rdquo;
The Tenth Doctor meets the two French figures in Doctor Who season 2, episode 4.</p>
<p>Doctor Who season 2 has several historical figures cross paths with the Doctor. &ldquo;The Girl in the Fireplace&rdquo; introduces a new love interest for the Doctor in Madame de Pompadour (Sophia Myles), as well as her lover, Louis XV (Ben Turner). Despite the Time Lord managing to stop the Clockwork Droids from using her to fix their ship, she dies before the Doctor can return through the correct time window to take her away in the TARDIS with him. Even though Louis could see the love she had for the Doctor, the two men shared a sweet sentiment over the woman before they parted ways.</p>
<p>Elizabeth I In &ldquo;The Shakespeare Code&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;The Day Of The Doctor&rdquo;
The Tenth Doctor encounters the Virgin Queen at two different points in her life.</p>
<p>The appearance of Elizabeth I in Doctor Who sparked a mystery that took six years to be resolved. The monarch&rsquo;s first appearance is in the season 3 episode &ldquo;The Shakespeare Code,&rdquo; when an older Elizabeth I (Angela Pleasence) chases the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) away, deeming him her &ldquo;sworn enemy.&rdquo; While the Doctor hints at having married the queen in the episode &ldquo;The End of Time Part 1,&rdquo; these events aren&rsquo;t seen on-screen until the special &ldquo;The Day of the Doctor,&rdquo; where a younger version of the figure is then portrayed by Joanna Page. In typical Doctor style, the Time Lord manages to accidentally wed her while tracking the Zygons.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare In &ldquo;The Shakespeare Code&rdquo;
The Tenth Doctor meets the Bard in Doctor Who season 3, episode 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Shakespeare Code&rdquo; also sees the Doctor cross paths with William Shakespeare (Dean Lennox Kelly). While this is the first time that the Time Lord comes face to face with the poet and playwright, it isn&rsquo;t Shakespeare&rsquo;s first appearance in Doctor Who. The historical figure also makes a cameo in the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial &ldquo;The Chase&rdquo; in 1965. Shakespeare only appears once in the modern Doctor Who era, but given his flirting and developing adoration of Martha Jones (Freema Aygeman), it makes sense for the Time Lord to avoid him for a while.</p>
<p>Agatha Christie In &ldquo;The Unicorn And The Wasp&rdquo;
The Tenth Doctor encounters the mystery author in Doctor Who season 4, episode 7.</p>
<p>In the season 4 episode &ldquo;The Unicorn and the Wasp,&rdquo; the Tenth Doctor and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) unexpectedly meet legendary author Agatha Christie (Fenella Woolgar) at a garden party. Much like Vincent van Gogh, who appears in the following season, Christie was unaware of how much of a success she&rsquo;d become. However, unlike Dickens, inspiration from her interactions with the Doctor makes it into her finished work.
Christie being such a brilliant detective writer is an advantage for her run-in with the giant, wasp-like, alien Vespiform. Without her assistance, the Doctor and Donna&rsquo;s fate may have ended up being very different. The final moments of this episode also see a reference to a real-life fact of Christie, providing a possible theory as to what happened during her disappearance in 1926.</p>
<p>Winston Churchill In &ldquo;Victory Of The Daleks,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pandorica Opens,&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;The Wedding Of River Song&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor first meets the prime minister in Doctor Who season 5, episode 3.</p>
<p>During World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) calls upon the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) and Amy Pond (Karen Gillan). The season 5 episode &ldquo;Victory of the Daleks&rdquo; introduces the politician on-screen, and he makes two more cameos, once later on in the season, in the episode &ldquo;The Pandorica Opens,&rdquo; and again in the season 6 finale &ldquo;The Wedding of River Song.&rdquo; Although the Time Lord doesn&rsquo;t allow Churchill to use the Daleks to help him win the war, which would cause absolute havoc on timelines, the Prime Minister still has a lot of respect for the Doctor.</p>
<p>Vincent Van Gogh In &ldquo;Vincent And The Doctor&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor befriends the artist in Doctor Who season 5, episode 10.</p>
<p>One of Doctor Who&rsquo;s most heartbreaking moments comes from the season 5 episode &ldquo;Vincent and the Doctor,&rdquo; which sees the Eleventh Doctor and Amy encounter legendary painter Vincent van Gogh (Tony Curran). This episode is another instance in which a historical figure takes an interest in a companion. Throughout, there is clear chemistry between Van Gogh and Amy, with her and the Doctor joking that they could have been parents to the &ldquo;ultimate ginger.&rdquo; Although the artist saw a tragic end in real life, in the episodes, the Doctor takes him to the future to discover just how much of a success he&rsquo;d eventually become.</p>
<p>Charles II In &ldquo;The Impossible Astronaut&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor encounters the English king in Doctor Who season 6, episode 1.</p>
<p>One of Doctor Who&rsquo;s funniest opening scenes sees the Eleventh Doctor hiding from Charles II (Paul Critoph). In &ldquo;The Impossible Astronaut,&rdquo; while leaving Amy and Rory (Arthur Darvill) messages throughout time, the Doctor is found by the king in the room of aristocratic painter Matilda (Henrietta Clemett), who was working on a nude study of the Time Lord. Of course, the Doctor&rsquo;s natural solution to this is to hide under her skirt, but he reveals his location by sneezing and quickly tries to awkwardly explain to the King that all was not as it seemed.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon In &ldquo;The Impossible Astronaut&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Day Of The Moon&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor works with the American president at the start of Doctor Who season 6.</p>
<p>The season 6 two-part opening adventure, &ldquo;The Impossible Astronaut&rdquo; and &ldquo;Day of the Moon,&rdquo; sees the Eleventh Doctor, Amy, and Rory encounter U.S. President Richard Nixon (Stuart Milligan). Despite the Time Lord not being particularly fond of the president, likely because of some of the scandals the man faced during his political term, the Doctor works with him to get to the bottom of the mysterious phone calls Nixon has been receiving. While it takes a while to find out the identity of the girl in the spacesuit, it is quite funny that River (Alex Kingston) is there to assist, whether she remembers her actions or not.</p>
<p>Doctor Who: River Song&rsquo;s Story In Chronological Order Explained
Doctor Who has a history of going &ldquo;timey-wimey,&rdquo; but River Song is the ultimate example - here&rsquo;s her complete timeline in chronological viewing order.</p>
<p>Henry Avery In &ldquo;The Curse Of The Black Spot&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;A Good Man Goes To War&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor reunites with the famed pirate in Doctor Who season 6.</p>
<p>Doctor Who season 6 sees several historical figures, with another being the pirate Henry Avery (Hugh Bonneville) in the episode &ldquo;The Curse of the Black Spot.&rdquo; Like Shakespeare, this is Avery&rsquo;s first on-screen appearance, but not his first mention, having been referenced previously in the lost 1960s Doctor Who serial &ldquo;The Smugglers,&rdquo; and this episode serves as a loose sequel. Unlike some historical figures, there are fewer confirmed details about Henry Avery. Despite this, he is portrayed as a fiercely loyal man and even returns to help the Eleventh Doctor with the rescue of Melody Pond in &ldquo;A Good Man Goes to War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler In &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Kill Hitler&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor crosses paths with the German dictator in Doctor Who season 6, episode 8.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brief, but the Eleventh Doctor, Amy, Rory, and River encounter one of history&rsquo;s most notorious figures, Adolf Hitler (Albert Welling). Despite the aptly named episode, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Kill Hitler,&rdquo; he isn&rsquo;t killed, and instead, the leader of Nazi Germany is forced into a cupboard by Rory. However, before doing so, the Lone Centurion makes sure to punch him in the jaw and hold him at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Nefertiti In &ldquo;Dinosaurs On A Spaceship&rdquo;
The Eleventh Doctor encounters the Egyptian queen in Doctor Who season 7, episode 2.</p>
<p>The season 7 episode &ldquo;Dinosaurs on a Spaceship&rdquo; sees one of the earliest historical figures in Doctor Who, as the Eleventh Doctor finds Queen Nefertiti (Riann Steele) forcing herself onto the TARDIS after he has saved Egypt from some giant alien locusts. The Lady of Two Lands isn&rsquo;t shy about expressing her lust over the Time Lord, and her adventurous spirit makes her a headstrong and confident side character, even if it results in her clashing with game hunter John Riddell (Rupert Graves).</p>
<p>Robin Hood In &ldquo;Robot Of Sherwood&rdquo;
The Twelfth Doctor discovers the legend to be true in Doctor Who season 8, episode 3.</p>
<p>While Robin Hood is mostly accepted to be a legend, the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) and Clara (Jenna Coleman) cross paths with the figure (played by Tom Riley) and find him to be very real. Historians have spent centuries debating whether the 12th-century outlaw was fact or fiction, but there&rsquo;s plenty of evidence to suggest he was real, although some of his famous tales are likely to have been embellished or exaggerated. Ironically, the Doctor and Clara&rsquo;s arrival in Sherwood Forest is a result of the Doctor wanting to prove to Clara that Robin Hood didn&rsquo;t exist, only to encounter him as soon as they step out of the TARDIS.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks In &ldquo;Rosa&rdquo;
The Thirteenth Doctor gets involved in the American Civil Rights movement in Doctor Who season 11, episode 3.</p>
<p>While Doctor Who has seen the appearance of several historical figures, the episode &ldquo;Rosa&rdquo; is unique, as it involves the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) and her companions in an iconic moment in human history. Not only does this episode see Team TARDIS meet Rosa Parks (Vinette Robinson), but Ryan (Tosin Cole) — but not the Doctor — also gets to meet Martin Luther King Jr. (Ray Sesay). While these events provide a twist on the true story of Rosa Parks, they also give a beautiful but necessary commentary on racism, not just in that time but also in the present day.</p>
<p>James I In &ldquo;The Witchfinders&rdquo;
The Thirteenth Doctor meets the English king in Doctor Who season 11, episode 8.</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Doctor encounters James I in the episode &ldquo;The Witchfinders,&rdquo; in which the monarch takes quite an interest in Ryan. King James is suspicious of the Doctor, especially due to her obsession with finding out more about the witch trial they&rsquo;d landed in the midst of, and his sexism toward her makes things more difficult. However, the Doctor picks up on King James&rsquo;s interest in Ryan, and much to his chagrin, finds himself babysitting him. By the end of the episode, James invites Ryan to become his new protector but is turned down.</p>
<p>Nikola Tesla &amp; Dorothy Skerrit In &ldquo;Nikola Tesla&rsquo;s Night Of Terror&rdquo;
The Thirteenth Doctor inspires the inventor and his secretary in Doctor Who season 12, episode 4.</p>
<p>In Doctor Who season 12, the Thirteenth Doctor meets Nikola Tesla (Goran Višnjić) and his secretary Dorothy Skerrit (Haley McGee). While Skerrit is lesser known in history, it&rsquo;s a refreshing change of pace to see not only a big name in Tesla appearing in Doctor Who, but also someone from his day-to-day life. Despite the events of the episode not making any major changes to Tesla&rsquo;s timeline, it is heavily implied that his run-in with Team TARDIS inspires some of his future inventions.</p>
<p>Mary Shelley &amp; Percy Shelley In &ldquo;The Haunting Of Villa Diodati&rdquo;
The Thirteenth Doctor meets the famous literary couple in Doctor Who season 12, episode 8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Haunting of Villa Diodati&rdquo; features a unique instance, in which the Thirteenth Doctor meets a historical couple. Her interactions with Mary Shelley (Lili Miller) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Lewis Rainer) in one of Doctor Who&rsquo;s eeriest episodes result in the rise of a Cyber Army once again. Although it can&rsquo;t be avoided, the Doctor has to show Percy his future death to remove the Cyberium infecting him, which alters timelines. Interestingly, this episode also provides an alternative account of the creation of Mary Shelley&rsquo;s Frankenstein, with similarities between the creature and the Cybermen.</p>
<p>Isaac Newton In &ldquo;Wild Blue Yonder&rdquo;
The Fourteenth Doctor encounters the scientist and philosopher in a Doctor Who 60th-anniversary special.</p>
<p>The opening moments of the Doctor Who 60th-anniversary special &ldquo;Wild Blue Yonder&rdquo; sees the Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant) and Donna crash into a tree, only to find themselves at the exact moment that Isaac Newton (Nathaniel Curtis) discovers the idea of gravity. This moment ends up altering timelines, creating the &ldquo;mavity&rdquo; running joke in Doctor Who, which is also referenced in the 2023 holiday special &ldquo;The Church on Ruby Road.&rdquo; This brief interaction cements a recurring Doctor Who concept, and proves how easily time can be changed due to carelessness.</p>
<p>Historical Figures The Doctor Has Mentioned Meeting
Not every icon referenced in Doctor Who was seen on-screen.</p>
<p>While there have been plenty of interactions between the Doctor and historical figures in Doctor Who&rsquo;s modern era, not all of them have been seen on-screen. Throughout the show, the Time Lord mentions meeting other prominent faces of human history in passing. Iconic magician Harry Houdini, for example, has been referenced by the Tenth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, and Fifteenth (Ncuti Gatwa) Doctors.
The Eleventh Doctor often name-drops during his tenure and mentions knowing Franz Schubert, Sigmund Freud, Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Virginia Woolf, Giacomo Casanova, Michelangelo, and Pablo Picasso. It&rsquo;s also known that he crossed paths with Henry VIII, after an incident that resulted in Amy accidentally marrying him. The Eleventh Doctor got Stevie Wonder to serenade River for her birthday, and in &ldquo;The Impossible Astronaut,&rdquo; he starred in a Laurel and Hardy film, although he never shared a scene with the duo. He also managed to get engaged to classic Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, who, after their wedding, consistently called the TARDIS phone.
The Tenth Doctor met several historical figures, too. In &ldquo;The Girl in the Fireplace,&rdquo; he claims to know Cleopatra, and in &ldquo;Smith and Jones,&rdquo; he tells Martha he&rsquo;d known both Benjamin Franklin and suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, calling the latter &ldquo;a cheeky woman&rdquo; for stealing his laser spanner. In &ldquo;Gridlock,&rdquo; he speaks of the origins of his famous flowing coat, recalling that he&rsquo;d received it as a gift from rock star Janis Joplin. He mentions in &ldquo;The Lazarus Experiment&rdquo; that he&rsquo;d also met classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven, who taught the Time Lord how to play the organ.
The Ninth Doctor had experienced issues with Gengis Khan at some point, recalling that the TARDIS had once been subjected to an attack by one of his hordes. He also references British Prime Minister David Lloyd George having drunk him under the table in the past, a funny comment considering the politician was an aggressive campaigner against alcohol. The Twelfth Doctor brings up Jane Austen multiple times, and Clara also implies that the novelist was a &ldquo;phenomenal kisser.&rdquo; The Thirteenth Doctor also mentions crossing paths with Amelia Earheart, vaguely recalling an event involving a spider web, but says the famous pilot was &ldquo;a right laugh.&rdquo;
