## Literature Review
Rogue Squadron could survive as a TV show, and the episodic format could be the perfect way to showcase legendary pilots and space battles. 




Lucasfilm may have canceled Patty Jenkins&#39; Star Wars: Rogue Squadron movie, but it&#39;s still possible for it to come back as a TV show. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, Lucasfilm officially confirmed three upcoming Star Wars movies - and made it quietly clear Patty Jenkins&#39; Rogue Squadron has been canceled. Still, that doesn&#39;t mea the idea will never happen - perhaps even in a different medium.




Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy made that abundantly clear in an interview with IGN back in April, shortly after the latest announcements. &#34;Rogue Squadron, that definitely is something that we still talk about,&#34; she confirmed. &#34;Whether it&#39;s a movie or whether it ends up being in the series space, that&#39;s definitely something.&#34; There is still a chance to see some of the greatest pilots in the history of the Rebel Alliance and New Republic, and a TV format could be the perfect way to tie together the original and sequel trilogies along with many of the other shows.

 Rogue Squadron Would Be Ideal As A TV Series 
          




The title of Rogue Squadron is an obvious homage, not only to the famous pilots of canon, but also to a bestselling series of Legends novels by Michael Stackpole and Aaron Allston.

Beginning with the surviving pilots from Red Squadron, Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles, Rogue Squadron could give a new perspective on everything from the Battle of Yavin to the New Republic era. Focusing on the Rebel and Republic pilots that make up the Rogue Squadron opens the door to so many exciting opportunities and directions the show could go in, and a TV show format is ideal for serialized storytelling and deep character developments.

Rogue Squadron is sure to follow a variety of characters over a span of several years. The episodic format of a TV show would make it much easier to follow such a sprawling story while also giving the variety of characters and ships the necessary attention. The format could also give it space to breathe and the time it needs to develop the pilots&#39; characters and explore the battles it follows. Additionally, it could take away some of the pressure that would come with being Star Wars&#39; first return to feature-length movies since 2019. Whatever form Rogue Squadron takes and however long it takes to be completed, the future will hold plenty of space battles, TIE fighters, and X-Wings.
