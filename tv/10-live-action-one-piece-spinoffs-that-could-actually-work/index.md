# 10 Live-Action One Piece Spinoffs That Could Actually Work


## SUMMARY 


 The success of the live-action One Piece opens up the possibility of spinoffs and prequels set in the same world. 
 Potential spinoff ideas include exploring the backstory of characters like Garp, Nico Robin, Shanks, and Buggy. 
 Another interesting spinoff idea could be a show from the perspective of the Marines, delving into the impact of the Straw Hat pirates on the World Government.

## Literature Review
Successful shows usually lead to spinoffs, and there are surprisingly many live-action One Piece spinoff ideas that could work – especially prequels.




There will probably never be a One Piece anime spinoff, but when it comes to the live-action version of the show, it would not be surprising if Netflix were to expand the franchise with prequels and original stories. More than breaking the live-action anime adaptation curse, One Piece delivered a show that even those who are not familiar with the source material could enjoy. One Piece season 2 is happening, and with Netflix focusing so much on the IP, more live-action series set in the world created by Eiichiro Oda could eventually happen.
From the characters to the locations, One Piece has some of the best, most fascinating examples of worldbuilding in all of fiction. This is particularly impressive considering it mainly follows one main character, Luffy. The richness of that world can give Netflix plenty of material for spinoffs to be released concurrently with the main show if the live-action One Piece continues to be successful.
            
 
 10 Live-Action One Piece Scenes We Can&#39;t Wait To See In Season 2 
Netflix’s live-action One Piece sets the stage for Luffy’s journey in season 1, but season 2 will feature even more exciting anime scenes.













 








 10  A Young Garp One Piece Prequel 
Garp was given a lot of focus in season 1
        

One Piece season 1 focused quite a lot on Monkey D. Garp, especially considering Luffy’s grandfather was not part of the East Blue saga in the source material. Garp&#39;s connection to Luffy is only revealed hundreds of episodes into the anime, which is why it was so surprising to see how the Vice Admiral was used in the live-action adaptation. That said, using so much of Garp that early opens the door for a live-action Garp spin-off centered on a younger version of the character. This show could see Garp rising through the ranks of the Marines while also establishing key relationships, such as Garp and Roger’s friendship.





 9  An Ensemble One Piece Old Era Epic 
One Piece doesn’t begin with Luffy


 







A young Garp spinoff would be fun, but a Game of Thrones-style epic about the Old Era would be even better. Although the term “before the Great Pirate Era” refers to literally everything that happened before Gol D. Roger’s execution, a live-action show centered on younger versions of some of One Piece’s most important characters would not have to go that far back into the timeline. Gol D. Roger would naturally be one of the protagonists in this spinoff, but the series would be able to explore a lot of key players from the One Piece universe ahead of their debut in the main series.





 8  The Life Of Nico Robin Before Arabasta 
Robin went through a lot before meeting Luffy
        

Who will play live-action Nico Robin in One Piece season 2 remains to be announced, but the devil fruit eater archeologist is among the most important characters the Netflix show will soon introduce. Although joining the Straw Hat Pirates is a new beginning for Robin, her life before the events of the Arabasta arc was very agitated. Robin has one of the most tragic backstories in One Piece, from the Buster Call in Ohara to becoming a wanted person with a major bounty on her. Robin’s backstory should only be revealed in full during the Enies Lobby arc, but it could be fleshed out in a prequel series.





 7  Young Shanks &amp; Buggy’s Adventures Aboard Gold Roger’s Ship 
It would be a hilarious One Piece prequel
        

If Netflix wants to explore One Piece spinoffs that will tackle different genres and will not rival the main show, a series focused on young Shanks and Buggy’s time as members of Gold D. Roger’s crew would be great. Buggy was a scene-stealer in One Piece season 1 and could easily carry his own spinoff, but showing too much of the clown beyond his interactions with the main characters could ruin some aspects of his story. As such, the next best option would be a show about young Buggy also featuring Shanks, which could start before Gold Roger’s death and go beyond the fallout between the clown and the red-haired pirate.







 6  A Spinoff About Shanks &amp; His Crew 
“Where is Shanks during this arc?”


 







One of the most unintentionally hilarious things about One Piece is how Shanks will be listed as one of the main characters in the opening pages of every manga volume, even though he does not show up in most of them. There are even jokes about how Shanks can only appear once every year in the anime. While this approach works for the source material, things need to move fast in the live-action adaptation. As such, a live-action Shanks spinoff could reveal what he was doing during each season of the main show. For example, Shanks was seemingly one of the rebels in Arabasta, yet he never actually appears in that arc.





 5  One Piece Told From The Perspective Of The Marines 
Many One Piece secrets could be unfolded
        

Considering the main One Piece heroes and villains cannot be explored too much beyond the main show at the risk of spoiling or removing the impact of their stories, a good idea for a spinoff would be to switch the focus to the Marines. This show could take place concurrently with the main events of the series, perhaps starting from East Blue and exploring how the actions of the Straw Hat pirates are affecting the World Government. It would be a great way to flash out the world of One Piece, especially the “three powers” dynamic that also involves the Four Emperors and the Seven Warlords of the Sea.





 4  A One Piece Ace Spinoff 
Ace is set to be introduced in season 2
        

Portgas D. Ace, Luffy’s brother, will probably steal the show in One Piece season 2. However, just like Shanks and other beloved One Piece characters, Ace does not have much screen time in the anime – especially compared to how convoluted his backstory and life are. A charismatic character with a cool set of devil fruit powers, Ace would be a perfect pick to lead his own spinoff. A live-action Ace show could be based on the canon Ace light novels, but it could also add a new spin to the character’s story.





 3  A Crocodile Spinoff Set Before Arabasta 
Crocodile will likely be One Piece season 2’s main villain
        

Compared to the One Piece villains that are yet to appear in live-action, the ones from season 1 are not even that scary. Live-action Sir Crocodile will shake things up in One Piece season 2, but there is room for the character to be explored beyond his role in the Arabasta saga. Crocodile’s past is a fascinating one, and there are still a lot of mysteries surrounding the character. A prequel Crocodile series could star right after Gold D. Roger’s death and then explore the formation of the Baroque Works. If season 2 works, One Piece may want more of Crocodile.





 2  The Origins Of The One Piece World 
One Piece has thousands of years’ worth of stories
        

History and passage of time are complicated parts of the world of One Piece, even more so considering the World Government actively tries to hide what happened during the Void Century. Considering the One Piece manga is heading toward its ending, Netflix could eventually create a live-action series about the origins of the One Piece world – something set thousands of years before the Great Age of Pirates. The show could lean heavily on worldbuilding while also introducing new characters based on the lore that already exists.





 1  A Spinoff About Original One Piece Characters 
Netflix could go for something very different


 







No pirate crew can make as much noise in the world as the Straw Hats, as that would go against One Piece’s entire premise. However, this does not mean a live-action One Piece show cannot explore a brand new set of protagonists, from pirates to bounty hunters. Countless adventurers are searching for the One Piece at any given time following Gold Roger’s death, which would allow a new show to develop new characters without having to worry about spoiling or contradicting the main series. Although a risky approach, it could expand the live-action One Piece franchise in a very interesting way.
