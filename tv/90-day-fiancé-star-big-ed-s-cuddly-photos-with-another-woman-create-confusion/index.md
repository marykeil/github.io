## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé’s Big Ed Brown looks extremely happy with his female friend while watching a game in San Diego without his alleged wife, Liz Woods.




Big Ed Brown from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise posted a few photos where he appeared overly close with a female friend. The 58-year-old reality star is most known for his unstable relationship with Liz Woods. Ed and Liz were first featured on 90 Day: The Single Life in 2021, after which they decided to become a couple. However, it wasn’t until 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 that they overcame many personal problems and underwent numerous therapy sessions. During the spin-off, Ed and Liz finally fixed their issues and decided to be with each other.




Ed and Liz reportedly got married in Arkansas after filming The Last Resort. Despite that, they haven’t posted much content together, sparking breakup rumors. Most recently, Ed amplified the gossip by sharing a few cuddly pictures with one of his female friends. He visited a local game with the woman and captioned his post, “Fun night at the Gulls with my SD buddies!”


 

As expected, many 90 Day Fiancé fans noticed Liz wasn’t in the pictures and called the San Diego reality star out. A social media user wrote, “Where is your wifey??” Another asked, “Why bro holding her arm tho?”

 90 Day Fiancé Star Liz Woods Reveals Her Latest Updates 
          

While Ed posted photos from the stadium, Liz shared Instagram Stories from indoors. She shared a video of her having a beverage with her friends, looking happier than ever. In another picture, Liz cuddled with one of her female friends. It’s hard to tell what Liz’s Instagram posts suggest, but it’s possible that the couple likely visited their friends to enjoy distinct activities. While Ed went to the ice hockey game to experience San Diego Gulls, Liz chose to have a calm day enjoying drinks at home.

Ed and Liz may not have wanted to confuse their fans, but they have indirectly sparked breakup rumors with their posts. The couple often shared many cute photos and videos to showcase their love. Liz claimed she and her beau were two peas in a pod. Surprisingly, the pair has been awfully quiet since appearing on 90 Day: The Last Resort. They haven’t talked much about their reported marriage or shared any photos from the event. It has been speculated that the two have may have separated after getting marriage.




Still, many signs suggest that nothing bad happened to Ed and Liz’s relationship. The most obvious clue is the couple’s social media accounts. The two still follow each other and have family photos on their profiles. Liz even liked Ed’s post with his female friend, hinting she knew about it and trusted her beau. The popular pair is likely quiet about their relationship because of contractual limitations. They may be hoping to air their wedding on another 90 Day Fiancé spin-off or waiting for any contract-related restrictions to be over.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
