# Shocking Wednesday Season 2 Theory Reveals Tyler s Return &amp; New Hyde Master


## SUMMARY 



  There&#39;s been speculation over Tyler&#39;s return in Wednesday season 2, with one theory suggesting that Wednesday herself is now Tyler&#39;s Hyde master.   If Wednesday is Tyler&#39;s Hyde master, it would provide a sensible excuse for Tyler&#39;s redemption arc and keep him around in season 2.   The Hyde and Hyde master relationship could prompt the characters to acknowledge their past and learn forgiveness and trust, potentially leading to a friendship and growth.

## Literature Review
There’s been speculation about Tyler’s potential return in Wednesday season 2, and one theory posits a clever way to keep the character around.




There&#39;s been a lot of speculation over whether Tyler Galpin (Hunter Doohan) will be back in Wednesday season 2, and one surprising theory makes it possible— and even offers a delightfully awkward way for it to happen. Tyler&#39;s betrayal is one of the saddest aspects of Wednesday season 1&#39;s ending, delivering a devastating blow to Jenna Ortega&#39;s lead, who comes to trust him during her time at Nevermore Academy. Wednesday&#39;s clues about Tyler being the monster might have been obvious to viewers, but the show&#39;s heroine doesn&#39;t see it coming. And Wednesday season 2 may throw another unexpected Tyler development her way.




Wednesday&#39;s love triangle wasn&#39;t popuar with everyone, but it&#39;s unlikely the show will write Tyler off completely. The Wednesday season 1 finale doesn&#39;t grapple with his betrayal enough, nor does it solve the problem of him being the Hyde monster; it simply gets rid of his master. Given the final moments&#39; tease, the series seems likely to further explore his dynamic with Wednesday in season 2. One theory posits a great way to do this — though it probably won&#39;t go over well with Tyler or Wednesday.

Although Tyler&#39;s Hyde monster is the one attacking people throughout Wednesday season 1, the true villain turns out to be the Hyde master: Marilyn Thornhill (Christina Ricci). Marilyn is able to draw out Wednesday&#39;s Hyde monster because she &#34;freed&#34; him. She&#39;s able to induce his transformations, subsequently provoking the monster&#39;s attacks. It&#39;s clear Tyler isn&#39;t completely innocent in all this — his resentment toward other people prevents him from feeling much remorse — but his actions and transformations often depend on the person in control.

After Marilyn&#39;s downfall in Wednesday season 1, Tyler is seemingly free of her manipulation. And one Wednesday season 2 theory shared by the cast suggests he has a new master. This theory posits that Wednesday herself is now Tyler&#39;s Hyde master, as she defeats Marilyn in the finale. It&#39;s not entirely clear if this is how the Hyde&#39;s powers work. However, Tyler&#39;s final season 1 scene supports this hunch. As the vehicle transporting him passes a car with Wednesday in it, Tyler immediately begins to transform. There&#39;s no real reason for the shift, which raises questions about whether he&#39;s unknowingly responding to Wednesday&#39;s presence.

Such A Development Would Keep Hunter Doohan&#39;s Character Around
          

If Wednesday does turn out to be Tyler&#39;s Hyde master, it likely means he&#39;ll get something of a redemption arc in Wednesday season 2. This development would certainly provide a sensible excuse to keep Tyler around beyond season 1, as Wednesday will need to deal with this new bond. It may also give Wednesday a reason to return to Nevermore Academy, as she doesn&#39;t give Xavier a clear answer about enrolling for another semester in the finale. If she&#39;s needed to figure out — or help control — Tyler&#39;s transformations, she&#39;ll have a mission for season 2 that makes her presence at Nevermore Academy inevitable.




Tyler being the Hyde also gives Wednesday season 2 a straightforward way to continue season 1&#39;s story. There are still plenty of questions surrounding the Hyde that warrant answers. Tyler&#39;s negative experiences growing up also make him an easy target for future character development. Viewers will likely get both things in future seasons of Wednesday. Of course, keeping Tyler around may also reignite season 1&#39;s unpopular love triangle, even if he and Wednesday aren&#39;t endgame.

Tyler And Wednesday Could Benefit From This Arrangement
          

Although Tyler and Wednesday won&#39;t be happy with such a development in Wednesday season 2, Wednesday being Tyler&#39;s new master could actually be a great thing for him. Wednesday likely wouldn&#39;t want such a responsibility, which could prompt an investigation into getting rid of his monstrous powers. Even if this proves impossible, Wednesday won&#39;t have any interest in using Tyler&#39;s abilities for her own ends. Assuming Tyler ever gets free of his imprisonment, he&#39;d be able to live his life without his master&#39;s interference.




Wednesday and Tyler being forced to acknowledge the events of season 1 — and work past them — could also teach both characters forgiveness and trust. While Tyler and Wednesday ending up together would be unlikely at this point, the pair could still use such a bond to form a friendship, and subsequently, a more positive view of humanity. Both characters are fairly jaded heading into Wednesday season 2, but that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t grow from their experiences in season 1. Using the Hyde and Hyde master relationship to prompt this would be a clever way to make that happen.
