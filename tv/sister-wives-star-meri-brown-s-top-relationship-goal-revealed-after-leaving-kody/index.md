## Literature Review

Meri Brown is excited to move on after the end of her marriage with Kody Brown. The Sister Wives star has made a special wish on her 53rd birthday.




After splitting from Kody Brown, Meri Brown from Sister Wives looks forward to a romantic date with a “great guy” on her birthday. Meri married Kody in 1990, and the couple welcomed Janelle and Christine Brown to make their marriage plural. All three sister wives had a harmonious relationship with Kody until Robyn joined the Brown family in 2010. Robyn became Kody’s main priority, which made Meri and the other wives jealous. In mid-2010, Meri struck up an online relationship with a man who turned out to be a catfish. Her betrayal caused Kody to loathe her and stop caring for her even more.




The Sister Wives star lived without the love of her former husband for years. Therefore, Meri has been craving romance and wants a meaningful connection with someone who’s nicer than Kody. Meri and her friend recently posted a birthday wish list on Instagram, revealing Meri’s top 25 goals.


 

While the list had many great wishes, the top one was related to a potential relationship. The first wish read, “Birthday dinner date with a great guy.” While Meri didn’t reply to the post, her friend, Jenn, asked her about it. She wrote, “Ok @therealmeribrown make a wish,” asking her to pick one.

 Meri Brown&#39;s &#34;Birthday Wish Idea List&#34; Revealed 
          

Meri’s birthday wish list also had many other interesting ideas. The second wish in the post was about skydiving. Since Meri was trapped in a loveless relationship with Kody, it makes sense that she wants to try something adventurous. Some of her other wishes included visiting Greece, Canada, and San Francisco. It seems Meri really wants to travel after being stuck in Flagstaff for years. She wants to explore the world, something she couldn’t do while she was part of the Brown family. There were also some unique wishes on the list. One such idea was to climb Mt. Timpanogos while another was going on a cruise.

Meri was Kody’s first wife, and she pulled out all the stops to make their marriage work. However, the Brown family patriarch didn’t value her emotions and even obliterated her self-esteem by asking her to move into his barn. It’s amazing to see the Sister Wives star come out of such a dark place and think of celebrating her birthday with a bang. Meri’s list is completely justifiable and spot on. It includes some of the best birthday celebration ideas that really work for her. From skydiving to traveling, Meri would enjoy each of these wishes if they came true.




Meri may have destroyed his trust by falling for a catfish online, but Kody had already ruined the relationship years before by not being a good husband. Now Meri is justified in wanting a new relationship. Her first birthday wish of dating a nice guy shows that she’s over Kody and ready for something new. Hopefully, Meri will be able to find someone just like Christine’s husband. Meri’s former relative found her soulmate, David Woolley, in 2023. She didn’t wait long before buying a house and marrying him. Hopefully, the Sister Wives cast members will have similar luck finding someone new.
