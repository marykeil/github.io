## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Debbie Aguero is ready to date again after her failed romance with Oussama Berber, who was 43 years younger than the Georgia woman.




Debbie Aguero is trying her best to avoid dating another Oussama Berber as she searches for her soulmate during 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. Debbie is a 67-year-old woman from Sugar Hill, Georgia, who first appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Debbie had given up on love after two failed marriages. However, she knew she had something special going on with Oussama despite him being just 24 years old. Debbie and Oussama had met online and connected over their shared love for art and poetry. She moved to Morocco to get married to Oussama.




However, Debbie split from Oussama when she realized his true intentions, and according to a preview clip from 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, courtesy of Access Hollywood, Debbie has become an expert at reading red flags.


 

Debbie is all dressed up in a frilly pink outfit at what appears to be a singles&#39; event. She walks up to a man named Gabriel and introduces herself while asking him to dance with her. The pair hits it off well, with the man praising Debbie’s dancing skills by declaring, “We’re gonna shake and bake this place.” However, Debbie catches the man’s eyes straying to the younger woman next to him.

As the man celebrates by clapping hands with the younger woman, Debbie admits it feels like “alarm bells going off” in her head. The man reminds Debbie of her ex-husband. She returns to her table to sit with her friends, who ask her if she ended up getting Gabriel’s number. Debbie agrees that she liked him until she “caught his eye wandering at the hot, tight, young body” next to her. Debbie says that it’s easy for a man to write himself off her book with a “permanent marker” once she sees him looking at or touching “another chick.”

Debbie knows that she’s been down that road before, and she is not interested in revisiting men with a “wandering eye.” Once Oussama told Debbie about his plans to move to the U.S., Debbie accused him of caring more about getting a visa to leave his country than their relationship. Debbie was upset that she had uprooted her whole life to move to Morocco. She realized Oussama never had unconditional love towards her. Perhaps, Debbie suspected that Oussama would leave her for a younger American woman once he came to the U.S.




Oussama wanted to get back with Debbie after their split. Debbie confessed that she spoke to him quite a few times, and he asked her to return to Morocco to marry him. She wants Oussama to find a nice woman and have a beautiful future with her. Meanwhile, Debbie is on 90 Day: The Single Life to meet a kindred spirit who possesses an intellectual capacity and will give her company while she enjoys the sunset years of her life.
