## Literature Review
There are some who may write off Star Wars: The Clone Wars as “just a kids’ show,” yet the series boasts even darker moments than the movies.




There are some who may write off Star Wars: The Clone Wars as “just a kids’ show” for its cartoonish animation. And yet, there are several episodes in the series with darker plot lines and themes than live-action Star Wars. Despite it’s strangely grotesque animation, The Clone Wars amplifies many of George Lucas’ theme. Not only did the series introduce and flesh out Ahsoka Tano—who went from being hated for “breaking Canon” to earning her own live-action series—but the series single-handedly changed how the audience views the clone troopers.
Barely any of the Clone Wars was shown in the Star Wars movies, leaving the tv series to delve deeply into the carnage and horrors the war brought about. While the clones struggle to define what being a “good solider” is, the Jedi Knights become more concerned about their supposed role as peacekeepers of the Republic. All the while, the series slowly builds toward Order 66 as Palpatine continues to orchestrate the war from the shadows.
            
 
 5 Ways Star Wars: The Clone Wars Contradicts The Movies (&amp; 5 Ways It&#39;s A Faithful Adaptation) 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars sometimes contradicted the prequel trilogy, but it also faithfully adapted George Lucas&#39; vision to animation.













 








 10  The Wrong Jedi 
Season 5, episode 20
        

The finale of The Clone Wars season 5 defied all expectations for Ahsoka Tano’s journey by forcing her to face the corruption in the Jedi Order. “The Wrong Jedi” is one of the most serious and somber episodes in the series, as Ahsoka is unjustly put on trial for a crime she was framed for. Despite serving the Jedi faithfully her whole life, they turn on her for the sake of their relationship with the Senate. “The Wrong Jedi” features one of the most complicated betrayals in the series, and ultimately results in Ahsoka choosing to leave the Jedi Order.





 9  Revenge 
Season 4, episode 22
        

“Revenge” starts off with Darth Maul’s transformation from a mindless spider-like droid to a cold and calculating Dathomirian. By using Nightsister magick, Mother Talzin is able to remove the crazed aspect of Maul’s decayed mind, restoring him to his former self. Of course, after regaining his legs and his purpose, Maul’s first goal is to lure Obi-Wan Kenobi to him. To this end, Maul slaughters several innocent villagers and sends evidence to Kenobi to draw him out. While Kenobi makes his usual funny quips, the overall tone of this episode focuses on Maul’s hatred for Kenobi. At one point, Maul even taunts Kenobi by discussing Qui-Gon’s death.





 8  Slaves Of The Republic 
Season 4, episode 12


 







“Slaves of the Republic” may be one of the most controversial episodes of the series, as it portrays the brutality of the Zygerrian slave empire. Despite successfully infiltrating the Zygerrian Queen’s court, things take a turn for the worse when the Zygerrians want Anakin to torture a captured Obi-Wan. Using Obi-Wan and Ahsoka’s freedom as leverage, the Zygerrian Queen forces Anakin to become her bodyguard, all the while reminding him of his childhood in servitude of the Hutts. Meanwhile, the slave keeper Agruss wastefully kills several Togruta slaves to show Obi-Wan how others will suffer should he rebel.





 7  Massacre 
Season 4, episode 19
        

The Nightsisters are often seen as one of the gloomiest races in The Clone Wars, but “Massacre” subverts expectations by showing their fight against the Separatist Army. This episode introduced the idea of Nightsister reanimation, a ritual later brought to live-action in the Ahsoka finale. Even though Old Daka resurrects an army of Zombie Nightsisters, the Dathomirians end up being no match for General Grievous and his droid army. In the end, Grievous commits genocide and ends up nearly wiping out all the remaining Nightsisters on Dathomir. Mother Talzin, Ventress, Merrin, and Morgan Elsbeth are among some of the few to have escaped the slaughter.
            
 
 One Dark Clone Wars Episode Shows The Real Reason Palpatine Turned Yoda&#39;s Apprentice Into A Sith 
This one tragic Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode explains why Palpatine chose to target Count Dooku and turn him into a Sith Apprentice.









 6  The Lawless 
Season 5, episode 16


 







“The Lawless” is one of the darkest tragedies in the series. Unlike “Revenge,” where Maul killed innocent villagers’ lives to lure Obi-Wan out, Maul instead takes Mandalore for his own, prompting Obi-Wan to try and rescue his beloved Satine. Sadly, Maul ends up killing Satine right before Obi-Wan’s eyes, driving Obi-Wan to his lowest point of grief. Satine’s death brought about a Mandalorian Civil War between Bo-Katan’s Nite Owls and Maul’s Death Watch Loyalists. In the meantime, Savage Opress is killed by Palpatine, who then proceeds to torture Maul with Force lightning.





 5  Orders 
Season 6, episode 4
        

“Orders” does not feature nearly as much death or destruction as other dark episodes in the series, but the psychological impact of Fives’ plight leaves an indelible impact. After putting the pieces of the puzzle together, Fives comes face to face with Chancellor Palpatine himself. Of course, Palpatine himself ends up framing Fives even further. This episode shows the pure futility of Fives attempting to warn everyone about Order 66. Much like Ahsoka, Fives is betrayed by the very Republic he served. In the end, Fives’ nightmare finally ends with him being shot mere moments before he can explain the plot to kill the Jedi.





 4  Brain Invaders 
Season 2, episode 8
        

Many think that The Clone Wars only gets dark in the latter seasons, but “Brain Invaders” from back in season 2 is one of the most horrific in the series. After their mission on Geonosis, parasitic brain worms infect multiple clone troopers on a supply ship with Ahsoka. As the worms slowly infect the entire crew, Ahsoka’s fellow Padawan Barriss Offee ends up becoming infected as well.





 3  Carnage Of Krell 
Season 4, episode 10


 







As part of the Umbara arc, “Carnage of Krell” deals with some of the darkest themes in the entire series. The episode starts with Jesse and Fives almost being executed by fellow clones, but are thankfully spared their gruesome fate. Things don’t get better, as General Pong Krell then tricks them by pitting them against a squadron of the 212th. Rex finds out that the entire battle is a horrific friendly-fire accident. Despite Krell being the Jedi General assigned to protect them, he turns against them and slaughters the clones mercilessly. In the end, the clones are forced to choose between following orders or keeping their lives.





 2  Padawan Lost 
Season 3, episode 21
        

“Padawan Lost” shows Ahsoka Tano being captured by Trandoshans, marking one of the first time she’s really alone from her master, Anakin. She’s then placed in a hellish, Hunger Games-esque arena where the Trandoshans hunt Padawans and younglings for sport. Should they be found, the Trandoshans will kill and mount them on their walls like trophies. Without Anakin, Ahsoka is forced to fend for herself while being helpless to help the other Padawans and younglings stuck with her.
            
 
 Star Wars: The Clone Wars Episodes In Chronological Order (Correct Watch Order) 
With Star Wars: The Clone Wars being released non-chronologically, you need the correct viewing order to make sense of its different plotlines.









 1  Victory And Death 
Season 7, episode 12


 







As the final episode of The Clone Wars, “Victory and Death” redefined just how horrific Order 66 was from the perspective of the clone troopers. Ahsoka and Rex are ultimately forced to face off against their friends and allies that they’ve fought beside for years. Because of the inhibitor chips, the 501st—against their will—try to kill Rex and Ahsoka. Despite Ahsoka and Rex&#39;s best efforts not to kill anyone, the rest of the army dies after crash-landing on the planet below. And after seven seasons of fighting, Ahsoka and Rex survey their fallen brothers and wonder what the point of The Clone Wars even was.
