## Literature Review

Loki season 2â€™s standout cast member, Ke Huy Quan, has reunited with his fellow God of Mischief cast members in a sweet Emmy reunion photo.




Ke Huy Quan, the man responsible for bringing Ouroboros/OB to life in Loki season 2, has reunited with his costars in a delightful photo. The image comes from 2024&#39;s Emmy ceremony which saw several members of Loki season 2&#39;s cast in attendance. Given that Loki season 2&#39;s ending left many wanting more from the world of the TVA, the reunion captured by Ke Huy Quan is wonderful to see.




The image in question comes from Ke Huy Quan&#39;s Instagram page and sees the actor smiling alongside two variants of the Asgardian God of Mischief. The actor of the titular character, Tom Hiddleston, was snapped flanked by Quan and Sylvie actor Sophia Di Martino. The image is certainly bittersweet after the somewhat tragic ending of Loki season 2 and begs the question of whether the characters will ever truly reunite again in upcoming MCU shows or movies.


 

                  Will Loki Season 3 Happen? Everything We Know   Although it hasn&#39;t yet been confirmed by Marvel Studios, Loki&#39;s MCU story could continue in the MCU. Will season 3 actually happen?   


 Will Loki, OB, And Sylvie Ever Reunite On-Screen In The MCU? 
          




Unfortunately, the likelihood of Loki, OB, and Sylvie ever reuniting in the MCU is slim. Loki season 2 ended with the titular character becoming God Loki, the being responsible for holding the very existence of the MCU multiverse together in a Yggdrasil tree of neverending branches. This allowed Sylvie to live the life of peace she always wanted, while OB continued his work with the TVA. Given Loki season 2&#39;s final episode depicted Loki&#39;s position as one that can never be left, the chances of seeing the trio reunite are tragically poor.
