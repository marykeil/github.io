<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>A-1 Pictures is a beloved studio with a rich history that has delivered dozens of influential anime, but these are truly the cream of the crop.</p>
<p>Thanks to the studio&rsquo;s rich history and passionate creatives, most anime fans would count at least one of the best A-1 Pictures anime among their favorites. Even in a medium where so many anime studios are vying for the top, it is easy to understand why A-1 Pictures holds a special place in many fans&rsquo; hearts, having created countless beloved titles since its inception in 2005.
Naturally, the more titles a studio produces, the more likely there is to be a variance in quality and originality. After all, even the medium&rsquo;s most talented and creative people are unable to deliver numerous successful projects continuously. As such, it would be reasonable to say that A-1 Pictures has had its fair share of forgettable titles, but they are undoubtedly outweighed by the numerous iconic anime that the studio is known for, which cover all genres and themes, providing something for everyone.</p>
<p>10  Solo Leveling (2024)
Based on the Manhwa by Hyeon-Gun &amp; Seong-Rak Jang</p>
<p>When the enigmatic Gate suddenly appeared one day, connecting the human world with magical dungeons inhabited by dangerous monsters, the world quickly realized that it was not only a threat, but also an opportunity. To fight against the otherworldly beasts, ordinary people received extraordinary abilities, allowing them to become hunters. However, not all hunters are equal, with Jin-Woo Sung being known as the world&rsquo;s weakest hunter. Yet, after facing his demise in a dungeon overrun with monsters, he is selected by the System and gains unlimited potential to grow.
Although this series is currently airing, meaning that its quality cannot yet be concluded upon, it would seem that, based on preliminary reviews, Solo Leveling has the potential to rival some of the medium&rsquo;s most popular titles. Its world and premise may be somewhat generic, but fans of power fantasy stories are bound to enjoy the exhilarating character development and beautifully animated, vibrant action scenes. Moreover, it seems to not only faithfully adapt the beloved source material, but also elevate the experience, thanks to the anime medium&rsquo;s unique strengths.

<p>9  Silver Spoon (2013)
Based on the Manga by Hiromu Arakawa</p>
<p>Stressed by his parents&rsquo; expectations and tired of having to accommodate their preferences, Yugo Hachiken decides to get away from his family by enrolling in Ooezo Agricultural High School, a boarding school in the Hokkaido countryside. Initially convinced that he would perform well just about anywhere, as he is confident in his learning abilities and hard-working nature, Yugo soon finds himself far behind his colleagues, who are more used to farming life. Despite being a fish out of water, Yugo is determined to keep up with his friends and find his own goals in life.
Following a flawed yet realistic and relatable protagonist, Silver Spoon tells a compelling tale of self-discovery. Thanks to its focus on the agricultural industry and the depth it goes into exploring the farming world, it could have easily risked exhausting viewers with the details. Instead, its well-researched setting does nothing but to further bring the interesting characters to life, providing an engaging, heartwarming experience that shows how people can learn from overcoming difficulties and facing new situations.</p>

<p>8  ERASED (2016)
Based on the Manga by Kei Sanbe</p>
<p>Satoru Fujinuma is a struggling 29-year-old manga artist, working hard to leave his mark on the industry. While he may appear ordinary on the surface, he secretly possesses a supernatural ability; whenever tragic disasters take place, he is thrust back in time by a few minutes. Using the ability he calls &ldquo;Revival&rdquo;, he has prevented countless catastrophes throughout his life, saving strangers from lethal accidents. But one day, after he is wrongfully accused of murder, he is sent back into the distant past, where he seeks to save his grade-school classmate Kayo Hinazuki and solve the mystery behind her disappearance.
ERASED quickly became one of the most popular titles in the mystery genre, thanks to its supernatural twist and masterful storytelling. The series keeps viewers hooked from the beginning to the end, always revealing further details about the underlying mystery at the perfect time. Furthermore, it is also able to tackle serious themes, such as abuse, without making the overall experience overwhelmingly depressing. All in all, ERASED is easily one of the best thriller anime, having rightfully earned its reputation as a captivating, one-of-a-kind drama.

<p>7  Lycoris Recoil (2022)
Original Series Written by Asaura &amp; Directed by Shingo Adachi</p>

After Takina Inoue, an exceptional Lycoris who values efficiency above all, disobeys orders, she is forced to transfer to LycoReco, an unusual café. Here, she meets Chisato Nishikigi, a prodigy with a unique outlook on life.
As a winner of Crunchyroll&rsquo;s 2023 anime awards, Lycoris Recoil provides an incredibly original and entertaining experience. Although action fans are likely to be drawn in by the numerous high-octane fighting scenes, there is a lot more to this title than meets the eye.

<p>Shuchiin Academy is a prestigious private school, attended only by the cream of the crop, the rich and the nobles. At the top of the student body lie its president, Miyuki Shirogane, and vice president, Kaguya Shinomiya, two highly respected students who excel in all academic fields. However, despite having developed romantic feelings for each other, neither of them is willing to be the first to admit it. In a battle of pride and love, Miyuki and Kaguya constantly try to deceive the other into confessing, resulting in a captivating psychological war.
Innovating upon a lighthearted and often predictable type of story that rarely stays with viewers past the closing scenes, Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a modern rom-com classic that leverages the best attributes of its genre. The charming ongoing conflict between Miyuki and Kaguya may define the title, but the supporting cast is no less memorable, featuring a variety of colorful and chaotic characters that fans can&rsquo;t help but love. Naturally, the vibrant animation perfectly matches the atmosphere, and the music provides some of the medium&rsquo;s catchiest tunes.

Even though his world has lost much of its color, Kousei lives a comfortable, yet uneventful life with his beloved friends. But everything changes when he encounters Kaori Miyazono, a free-spirited violinist whose inspiring and unorthodox performance reignites his passion for music, and reminds him of the beauty of life.

But after a work incident causes him to lose his job, Mutta tries once again to take a step towards his childhood dream. The acceptance of his application marks only the beginning of an ambitious journey full of hurdles and obstacles.
