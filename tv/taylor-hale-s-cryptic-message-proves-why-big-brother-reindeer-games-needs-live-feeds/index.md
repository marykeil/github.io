# Taylor Hale s Cryptic Message Proves Why Big Brother Reindeer Games Needs Live Feeds


## SUMMARY 



  Taylor Hale has survived elimination twice on Big Brother Reindeer Games, showing her strategic gameplay.   Taylor wishes there were live feeds for Big Brother Reindeer Games to show viewers everything they&#39;re missing out on.   The lack of a live element on Reindeer Games makes for a different viewing experience. Maybe a season 2 can bring back the live feeds.

## Literature Review
Taylor Hale has returned to the world of Big Brother via the Reindeer Games spin-off, but she has a bone to pick with a particular formatting change.




Big Brother Reindeer Games is very different than a regular season of Big Brother, but contestant Taylor Hale has a specific reason why she wishes they were more alike. Taylor initially competed as a houseguest during Big Brother 24. She made it all the way to the end and went head-to-head with Monte Taylor for the jury&#39;s votes. Once host Julie Chen Moonves read out the results, Taylor not only pulled off the win, but it was an overwhelming 8-1 landslide victory.




Taylor is one of nine alums returning for Big Brother Reindeer Games. Since the holiday-themed spin-off is not live, the contestants are able to share their thoughts on social media as each episode airs, which is what Taylor did this week as the season kicked off.


 

While watching Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1, Taylor cryptically tweeted, &#34;This is why we need live feeds. I’m finally an alum saying &#39;you didn’t see everything!!&#39;&#34; Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t reveal any specific info about what viewers are missing out on. Her followers replied to her asking her to spill the tea. Some of them wondered why she spoke to Frankie about going after Cody; they didn&#39;t think the edit was putting her in a good light.


 How Is Taylor Hale Doing On Big Brother Reindeer Games? 
          




Only two episodes of Big Brother Reindeer Games have aired so far, and Taylor has survived elimination both times. Big Brother 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin, who just won America&#39;s Favorite Player this fall, was the first contestant to leave the competition. Then Cody Calafiore from Big Brother 16 and Big Brother 22 left on night 2, leaving seven players left in the game. Along with those three, Xavier Prather, Frankie Grande, Nicole Franzel, Josh Martinez, Danielle Hendricks and Britney Godwin have been brought back to compete against each other. Taylor strategically acknowledged on the show that Cody is a huge threat, and he found out about what she had been saying.

Taylor made an interesting observation about the lack of live feeds for Big Brother Reindeer Games. Obviously, there are various elements that make this spin-off different from a normal season of the CBS reality competition show. The entire season was filmed ahead of time, whereas Big Brother is normally live and viewers can tune in not just on CBS but also via the live feeds. Also, the players are not living together in the house. With the way Reindeer Games has been set up, it would be impossible to have live feeds.




Taylor might have just been referring to the fact that there were deleted scenes left on the cutting room floor, which she hinted at in her tweet. All reality shows are edited for time, and not everything can make it into each episode. But her comment still brings up a very valid point. The lack of live feeds on Reindeer Games makes for a very different viewing experience than fans are used to. If there&#39;s enough backlash to this particular element of the spin-off, maybe a potential Reindeer Games season 2 could be reformatted so that it&#39;s feasible for the live feeds to return.

Big Brother Reindeer Games airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
