## Literature Review
Sterlin Harjo and Taika Waititi&#39;s Reservation Dogs has some fantastic music on soundtrack, and the songs perfectly complement the Hulu comedy series.




The hit Hulu TV series Reservation Dogs features a fantastic music soundtrack with songs that are both enjoyable on their own and thematically significant to the scenes they play in. Reservation Dogs is an FX series from Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo that follows the lives of four Indigenous teenagers from Oklahoma. The group of friends mill around together, commit petty crimes, and think of ways to earn money to get out of their reservation community. It&#39;s the first American TV series to feature a team of all Indigenous writers and directors, along with a cast of primarily Indigenous North American actors.
Reservation Dogs has been nominated for one Golden Globe and one and has been widely celebrated for its humor, powerful story, and look into a culture that is woefully underrepresented in media. The quotes in Reservation Dogs are very memorable as is the acting of the talented crew, and the use of Native American imagery is original and impressive. But another way the series sets itself above others is its masterful use of music. Using both Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists, Reservation Dogs creates a playlist of beautiful, haunting, and exciting songs that help paint the themes of the story without overpowering the characters or the plot itself.
            
 
 Reservation Dogs: 10 Memes That Perfectly Sum Up The Show 
Reservation Dogs has been picked up for a third season on Hulu which means more Elora, Bear, Cheese, and Willie Jack; and more memes. 













 








 10  &#34;Angry&#34; By The Rolling Stones (Season 3, Episode 8, &#34;Send It&#34;) 
Plays when Uncle Kenny picks up the teens in his bus.
        

&#34;Angry&#34; by The Rolling Stones comes from their 2023 album Hackney Diamonds and is a catchy, loud anthem with a guitar riff that can&#39;t be shaken. The lyrics are part whining, part teasing about insisting someone not be angry with another&#39;s choices. It&#39;s perfect for the scene where the teens get picked up by Uncle Kenny (Kirk Fox) to break Maximus Fixico (Graham Greene) out of the hospital, so Maximus can make up with his dying cousin. The song is an encapsulation of the Rez Dogs as kids who mean well even when they&#39;re breaking the law.







 9  &#34;The Shadow Knows,&#34; By Link Wray (Season 1, Episode 2, &#34;NDN Clinic&#34;) 
Plays when Bear gets beat up by the NDN Mafia.
        

From the early episodes of Reservation Dogs, music helped set the tone of the show. In season 1, episode 2, &#34;NDN Clinic&#34;, Shawnee guitarist Link Wray&#39;s thrumming cords and almost devilish cackle followed by the announcement of &#34;The shadow knows&#34;, set the series up as something droll, slightly mean, and unnervingly mystical. Bear (D&#39;Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai) getting beat up by the NDN Mafia is positioned as a common occurrence with this steady, almost bored song playing overtop of his pummeling. It&#39;s eerie, sort of silly, and more than a little hardcore, which is a tone only Reservation Dogs seems to easily pull off.







 8  &#34;The Swimming Song,&#34; By Loudon Wainwright III (Season 2, Episode 2, &#34;Run&#34;) 
Plays over the final scenes of season 2, episode 2.
        

At the end of &#34;Run&#34;, Bear can&#39;t find a job, Elora (Devery Jacobs) and Jackie (Elva Guerra) don&#39;t know where to go next, and Willie Jack (Paulina Alexis) and Cheese (Lane Factor) have lifted the curse but don&#39;t feel better. But despite not achieving much, the Rez Dogs still tried. Loudon Wainwright III sings, &#34;This summer I went swimming/This summer I might have drowned/But I held my breath and I kicked my feet/And I moved my arms around&#34;. Trying something can be frightening, but making an effort is the only way for the Rez Dogs to grow, just as Wainwright says it&#39;s the only way to swim.







 7  &#34;Stadium Pow Wow&#34; By The Halluci Nation (Season 1, Episode 1, &#34;F*ckin’ Rez Dogs&#34;) 
The Rez Dogs walk out to confront the NDN Mafia.
        

Reservation Dogs gives a platform to many Indigenous voices. One of the louder and more heart-pounding ones is that of The Halluci Nation, formerly known as A Tribe Called Red. Their song &#34;Stadium Pow Wow&#34; is a riff on an earlier song they produced, &#34;Electric Pow Wow&#34;. It&#39;s a chest-thumping, head-banging anthem that is perfectly matched to the scene in the series premiere of the Rez Dogs walking out to confront the NDN Mafia, dressed in suits. Quentin Tarantino and his Reservoir Dogs can have &#34;Little Green Bag&#34;; Reservation Dogs has &#34;Stadium Pow Wow&#34;.







 6  &#34;Washita Love Child&#34; By Jesse Ed Davis (Season 3, Episode 4, &#34;Friday&#34;) 
Plays at the end of the episode as the Rez Dogs go to Sonic.


 







In this episode, the Rez Dogs have been punished for leaving for California by being forced to do community service. It&#39;s not a real punishment and is a sign their families and community are more than willing to forgive the petty thievery they committed on their way out of town. Jesse Ed Davis is a guitarist from the Comanche Nation and his hopping, funky song &#34;Washita Love Child&#34; is a happy and optimistic classic rock-and-roll tune that reflects the Rez Dogs at this moment. Sure they&#39;re nominally being punished, but they&#39;re together and back home, just going to Sonic and making jokes like they always have.







 5  &#34;Time After Time&#34; By Samantha Crain (Season 2, Episode 9, &#34;Offerings&#34;) 
Plays at the end of the episode while Hokti looks at a picture of Daniel.
        

&#34;Time After Time&#34; by Cyndi Lauper is a classic love song, but the rendition in Reservation Dogs is not just a cover but a worthy successor. Oklahoma artist and Choctaw native Samantha Crain sings her version of &#34;Time After Time&#34; at the end of this episode, over a scene of Hokti (Lily Gladstone) updating her prisoner visitor sheet to include Willie Jack. They had spent the episode discussing Daniel with Willie Jack trying to understand why his mother, Hokti, refuses to see anyone. With the help of her spirit guide, Gram (Tafv Sampson), Hokti opens herself up to her family, all scored by the haunting and warbling vocals of Crain.







 4  &#34;Early Blue&#34; By F.J. McMahon (Season 3, Episode 2, &#34;Maximus&#34;) 
Plays at the end of the episode when the police take Maximus away.


 







Bear meets Maximus in Reservation Dogs season 3, episode 2, &#34;Maximus&#34;, and slowly grows fond of the older, eccentric man. Maximus has had a tough life. His parents died when he was young, and he was raised at a boarding school. Since then, he&#39;s been by himself but considers Bear a kindred spirit. This quiet, slightly hopeful song plays over Bear watering Maximus&#39; plants before leaving his home. &#34;Early Blue&#34; by F.J. McMahon includes the lyrics &#34;From my window/In the morning’s light/I try to hide from people&#34; which alludes to how Maximus has lived his life and how Bear could too if he doesn&#39;t end up reuniting with his friends.







 3  &#34;Cripple Creek&#34; By Buffy Sainte-Marie (Season 2, Episode 2, &#34;Run&#34;) 
Plays at the beginning of the episode with Elora and Jackson running through a field.
        

&#34;Run&#34; begins where the season 2 premiere left off, with Elora and Jackie running away from a group of men chasing after the pair. The men are chasing the girls with guns, and the girls are both in very real danger. However, &#34;Cripple Creek&#34; by Buffy Sainte-Marie is a jaunty, twangy ditty that plays over the two girls running, making for a surprisingly funny juxtaposition of what&#39;s being heard and what&#39;s being shown. Reservation Dogs never plays scenes too dire and this song helps match the tone of the series by turning the chase from something ominous to something mischievous and playful.

 2  &#34;If It’s Monday Morning&#34; By Lee Hazlewood (Season 1, Episode 2, &#34;NDN Clinic&#34;) 
Plays at the end of the episode over a montage of scenes.
        

&#34;If It&#39;s Monday Morning&#34; by Lee Hazlewood has a sound that&#39;s completely true to Reservation Dogs. It&#39;s beautiful, sad, quiet, dryly funny, and a little bit silly. Hazlewood speak-sings over his infrequent guitar plucks as he talks about the struggles of getting up on a Monday morning. The song plays over Cheese helping his grandmother to watch the sunset together, Officer Big (Zahn McClarnon) dealing with stomach issues, and a doctor enjoying a quick smoke break. It&#39;s an uncertain and storybook song that could very well be playing in the heads of the Reservation Dogs&#39; characters anytime in the series.







 1  &#34;Salmon Stinta,&#34; By Black Belt Eagle Scout (Season 2, Episode 10, &#34;I Still Believe&#34;) 
Plays at the end of the episode while the Rez Dogs are hugging in the ocean.


 







At the end of Reservation Dogs season 2, the Rez Dogs finally make it to the Pacific Ocean. They embrace, glad to have completed their friend Daniel&#39;s goal, as &#34;Salmon Stinta&#34; by Black Belt Eagle Scout plays. Ethereal vocals from Swinomish/Iñupiaq singer Katherine Paul float over a dreamy guitar and humming beat that&#39;s hard not to get lost in. Reservation Dogs has always toyed with mystical aspects, and it almost feels like Daniel is there with his friends. Then, the camera pivots, and Daniel (Dalton Cramer) is knee-deep in the water, hugging the Rez Dogs. No one says anything; Paul&#39;s voice says it all.
