There have been several films and television series that have looked into the gangster scene in Boston throughout the years, most notably Martin Scorsese&#39;s Oscar-winning The Departed as well as 2015&#39;s Black Mass which starred Johnny Depp as the notorious Whitey Bulger.

A majority of the famous gangster movies and television shows are set in New York and New Jersey, such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Gangs of New York, and Once Upon A Time In America. The Departed is certainly the most famous Boston mob movie but it was set in the 1980s. The Peaky Blinders Boston spinoff suggests a much earlier time period that is likely going to chronicle how the Irish mob and the Italian mafia took over the city throughout the 20th century.
