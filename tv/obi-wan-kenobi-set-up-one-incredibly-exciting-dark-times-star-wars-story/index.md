## Literature Review
The mention of Quinlan Vos in the Obi-Wan Kenobi set up a thrilling opportunity to explore the character&#39;s history with the dark side of the Force.




Star Wars Disney&#43; TV series Obi-Wan Kenobi referenced Quinlan Vos, a character whose Force powers leave him vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. The Jedi Master Quinlan Vos is one of the most complex characters in the prequel era, working alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3. He has a long and established history with the dark side.




Quinlan Vos has the Force power called psychometry, an ability that allows him to experience the past when he touches a person or object. The prequel era Jedi believed this power left him vulnerable to the dark side, because it means he experiences the emotions of another person when he touches an object. As seen in Christie Golden&#39;s Dark Disciple - based on an unused story from Star Wars: The Clone Wars - he wound up on a mission that would indeed expose him to the dark side.

 Obi-Wan Kenobi Confirmed Quinlan Vos Survived Order 66 
          

Obi-Wan Kenobi episode 3 saw the Jedi Master discover a Hidden Path that allowed Order 66 survivors to flee from the Empiire. He sees names etched into the wall, and is surprised to realize &#34;Quinlan was here.&#34; This moment is profound because it reveals that Quinlan survived Order 66, as had been teased but not confirmed in the comics, and was working with the Rebellion. This was surely a meaningful moment for Obi-Wan; although Obi-Wan rejects an alliance with a Jedi rebel at the beginning of the show, it must have been a comfort and a boost of hope when another survivor emerged, particularly one he knew.




The book Star Wars 100 Objects, written by Kristin Baver, elaborates upon this reveal. The book explains that Quinlan played much more than just a small role in helping the Rebels.


&#34;The maverick Jedi Quinlan Vos, who helped smuggle younglings to freedom, also used this network. He had boldly left his name so that others in a similar situation might recognize it and be comforted. Vos’s act of defiance was a morale-boosting signal to remain hopeful, despite the dangerous times ahead. It was also a defiant recognition that he — like many of those following after — would soon be shedding his old identity and going into hiding.&#34;


This information comes as a bit of a shock given the complex history Quinlan had throughout Star Wars.

The reveal that Quinlan became such a hero means that his story must be told, particularly given that his fate during the Imperial Age is unclear. Beyond a reference in 100 Objects, it would be a great service to the character to represent those actions on-screen. Moreover, the quote from the book gets at a fascinating Star Wars concept that has yet to be fully explored: Maverick Jedi. The most notable Maverick Jedi was Qui-Gon Jinn, who was similarly unconventional and even critical of the Jedi. Quinlan, having even tapped into the dark, would offer a captivating portrayal of that concept should Star Wars elect to build on his story.
