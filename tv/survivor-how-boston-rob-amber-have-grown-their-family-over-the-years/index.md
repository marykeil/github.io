## Literature Review
Survivor alums Rob and Amber are one of the few Survivor couples who made their relationship work after their show. Here&#39;s how their family has grown.




Boston Rob and Amber Mariano met on Survivor: All Stars, and they&#39;ve been growing their family ever since. While appearing on two seasons of one of the best reality TV shows together and a couple of The Amazing Race installments, Rob and Amber started prioritizing having kids. Here is everything the two are up to now and what their family looks like after Survivor season 8. Their iconic status is part of why the show is still going strong, with Survivor season 46 coming soon.




In between blindsides at Tribal Councils and competing in rigorous challenges, romantic partnerships were bound to form. However, some cast members often kept those bonds under wraps so they wouldn&#39;t have targets on their backs. Boston Rob and Amber are not the only pair to find comfort with fellow Survivor castaways, though relationships usually do not last after the show&#39;s stars leave the island. Another couple to famously come out of the series is Whitney Duncan and Keith Tollefson from Survivor season 23, who are also married and have since competed on The Amazing Race.

Rob and Amber started in the same tribe, and their chemistry was evident. Their relationship formed on the show in 2004, during Survivor season 8, which took place in Panama. Rob holds the record for most Survivor appearances, as he has been on six different installments. He first competed on Survivor season 4, where he placed 10th, and was asked to compete in the first returning players season, Survivor: All-Stars. When they got separated in a tribe swap, Rob started making deals with other players, saying that he would help them if they kept Amber safe. Amber went on to win the season, with Rob as the runner-up. In a shocking twist, he proposed to her at the live finale.

Rob went on to compete in Survivor: Heroes vs Villains and won the title of Sole Survivor two seasons later on Redemption Island. After he and Amber got engaged at the finale, they appeared on a CBS special called &#34;Rob and Amber Get Married&#34; in 2005, and the two have been going strong ever since. They have also proven to be strong competitors together on The Amazing Race, as they went on the show twice and placed second and then eighth. Later, they played a historical season of Survivor: Winners at War together, and despite not being victorious, they got an adorable family visit from their daughters.




While competing on Survivor throughout the years, Rob and Amber also spent time growing their family, and they now have four beautiful daughters. They are Lucia Rose (12), Carina Rose (11), Isabetta Rose (9), and Adelina Rose (7). Though the pair seem to be living in sunny Pensacola, Florida, Rob and Amber still spend a lot of time in his hometown of Boston, and he still sports his famous Boston hat.
