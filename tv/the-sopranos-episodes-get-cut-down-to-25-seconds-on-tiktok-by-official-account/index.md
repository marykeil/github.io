## Literature Review
The Sopranos episodes are cut down to 25 seconds by the show&#39;s official account on TikTok in commemoration of the series&#39; 25th anniversary.




The Sopranos episodes are being cut down to 25 seconds on the show&#39;s official TikTok account as part of commemorating the series&#39; 25th anniversary. The crime drama follows Tony Soprano, an Italian mobster who balances being a criminal with his family life. Despite beginning in 1999, the show has maintained popularity and recognition for its stellar performances and writing.




Now Sopranos, the official account of The Sopranos, is posting 25-second videos summarizing the key events in every episode of the show. These shorts are being produced to commemorate the show&#39;s 25th anniversary. As of writing, the series has been summarized up through season 2, with the account posting more leading up to January 10, the day the series premiered 25 years ago.


 Why The Sopranos Episodes Should Be Watched In Full 
          

The Sopranos influenced many popular TV shows, including those with similar crime-based premises like Breaking Bad and Ozark. Because of how historically important it is to television history, it has become memorable for its major story twists and classic character archetypes. This is especially true of Tony himself, whose status as an antihero viewers can root for inspired similar types of characters.




Because of how many hilarious and sad moments The Sopranos has, it does a disservice to the show&#39;s complexity by watching 25-second summaries of every episode. Doing so negates its emotional highs and lows, not giving viewers the same level of satisfaction as watching the series develop in its full-length format. It also takes away from the methodical development of the story by spoiling key events in a short amount of time.

However, it&#39;s possible these short format summaries - especially ones for earlier episodes - can entice new viewers into watching The Sopranos in full. This could lead to a resurgence of popularity for the crime drama, despite new viewers having some key events spoiled for them. However, given the influence the series has had on television for decades, watching 25-second summaries would be a disservice to the effort put into the full-length show.






The Sopranos is streaming on Max.
