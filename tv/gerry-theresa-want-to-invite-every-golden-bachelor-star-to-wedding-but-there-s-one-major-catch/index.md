## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s golden couple Theresa Nist and Gerry Turner are set to get married live on ABC, but there&#39;s one major catch to their guest list.




The Golden Bachelor&#39;s live wedding event is almost here, and Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist are ready for their beautiful ceremony, which will include a mystery guest list, according to the bride and groom themselves. After meeting on The Golden Bachelor season 1, Gerry and Theresa&#39;s connection was nearly instantaneous. The pair made it through the difficulty of Gerry dating the rest of The Golden Bachelor cast, making it to the end of the season, where Gerry proposed to Theresa with a beautiful, romantic speech. After keeping their relationship under wraps, the pair shared they would be getting married live on the air during After The Final Rose.




During an interview with Us Weekly before their wedding, Gerry and Theresa revealed they&#39;d love to have the entire cast of The Golden Bachelor season 1 attend their wedding, but they don&#39;t have control of the guest list. &#34;You know what, if it was up to us, we would invite everyone,&#34; Theresa explained. &#34;We’re not in charge of that process. We seriously love every single one of these women, but it’s out of our hands...We actually don’t know the list.&#34; While Gerry and Theresa may not be in charge of the guest list, they&#39;ve planned other aspects.

While Gerry and Theresa may not have been able to control who will be in attendance at their wedding, there are several pieces of the ceremony that they&#39;ve been able to plan for themselves. Theresa revealed that her dress selection was a fun process she shared with her daughter, explaining, &#34;When I came down with [one] dress, everybody in unison went, ‘Oh, that’s the dress,&#39;” Theresa said. “They also said, ‘Oh, your face was glowing. You look so beautiful.’&#34; Gerry shared that he&#39;s ready to be surprised, explaining, &#34;The only thing I know is how many great reviews I’ve heard of the dress that Theresa has chosen.&#34; 


 

Though Gerry and Theresa appear to have some control over their Golden Bachelor wedding, it&#39;s clear that the majority of the bigger decisions are being made by production. Though Gerry and Theresa&#39;s families will be included in the ceremony in a thoughtful, sweet way that honors their late spouses, the rest of the wedding ceremony itself will be focused on the happy couple and their future together. With Gerry and Theresa&#39;s Golden Bachelor co-star Susan Noles taking the role as their wedding officiant seriously, the ceremony itself will be a beautiful testament to the fact that Gerry and Theresa have found a second chance at love later in their lives.




The Golden Bachelor season 1 may be over, but the fact that Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding is coming up so quickly and will allow them to continue the celebration long after the final rose has been handed out will be sweet and refreshing. As Gerry and Theresa head into the next chapter of their lives, there may still be things up in the air about their future together, but one thing they&#39;re certain about is each other. The pair will be glowing during their live wedding ceremony and, hopefully, after the stress of the day is over, they&#39;ll get to relax away from all things The Golden Bachelor.

The Golden Wedding airs January 4 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
