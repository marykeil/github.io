## Literature Review
The Bear season 2 ended tragically, as Carmy loses the restaurant’s opening night and his relationship, but this ending was almost very different.




In the finale of The Bear season 2, Carmy&#39;s life rapidly comes apart, as he is locked in a freezer, isolated from the opening of his restaurant, and furthermore, is broken up with due to his unavailability, however there is one aspect of the final episode that is particularly gut-wrenching, and it almost didn&#39;t make it into the show. The Bear is a drama comedy following a young chef named Carmen who returns to Chicago to run his deceased brother&#39;s sandwich shop, even as it slowly inches toward being closed. The series, which streams on Hulu, has two seasons and The Bear season 3 has been confirmed.




While The Bear season 2 was full of intense moments, the final episode was a turning point for Carmy. Although the season sees him holding everything together, managing to open the restaurant on time despite overwhelming setbacks, it isn&#39;t easy for him, and this becomes clear in the last installment. Just as Carmy is going to get everything he wants, it is ruined when he gets locked in a freezer, and overcome with emotion, declares that he would rather focus on being a chef than on his girlfriend Claire. Claire breaks up with him, and later, when he hears Claire&#39;s unopened voicemail revealing her love for him, it is heartbreaking.



Hulu has confirmed that The Bear season 3 will premiere some time in 2024.





 The Bear Season 2&#39;s Ending Almost Didn&#39;t Include Claire&#39;s Voicemail 
As Confirmed By Molly Gordon
          




Even though Claire&#39;s voicemail is what really hits the nail in the coffin for Carmy during The Bear season 2 ending, it turns out that this detail almost didn&#39;t make it into the episode. Molly Gordon, who plays Claire in The Bear, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview:


&#34;When I first read episode 10 [the finale], the voicemail was never going to be in it...Jeremy and I had a connection — he’s such a wonderful person and so available as an actor and a beautiful scene partner — and what I think happened is that Chris wanted to make that part more meaningful and add more to the episode.&#34;


Ultimately, the voicemail did achieve what Gordon described. While it was bad enough to watch Carmy say such a cruel thing without even realizing that Claire stood behind the door, it was worse to see him listen to the voicemail once everything was already over. Notably, Carmy and Claire&#39;s relationship is one of the first healthy relationships he has ever had that is not related to his work. For much of the season, it seems like Claire is going to be really great for him, able to get him out of his shell and outside of the restaurant, so when it is ruined, it is really upsetting to watch.

What The Voicemail Means For Carmy&#39;s Character
         

Ultimately, if The Bear had not used Claire&#39;s voicemail, it would have made the finale worse because the voicemail is truly the cherry on top of Carmy&#39;s terrible situation. Carmy&#39;s situation is as follows: he blew up at his crew during the restaurant opening then got himself locked in the freezer, which prevented him from having control or being able to enjoy the successful opening. On top of that, Carmy ruins his relationship with Claire by choosing his work over her. In total, this is pretty horrible, but the voicemail is what makes it all worse, because it shows Carmy what he could have had.

During the finale, Carmy is so caught up in the restaurant opening that he barely gives himself time to be happy about his success. He becomes so overwhelmed with the orders, the patrons, and having everything be perfect, that he is totally blind to the fact that he has already done something amazing. And really, he doesn&#39;t get the chance to see this when he is in the freezer either, because he is essentially stuck in his own negative feedback loop. But Claire&#39;s voicemail is the one moment where he sees the other side. Listening to that, he finally realizes that he had it all, and he ruined it.



 The Bear Season 3 Must Deal With Season 2&#39;s Voicemail 
          

It is a great thing that The Bear season 2 ended up including Claire&#39;s voicemail, but hopefully, this won&#39;t be the end of it either. Carmy and Claire&#39;s break-up happened so quickly, and Carmy only listened to the voicemail once it was too late. Therefore, it would be unfair if the show did not follow up with them in The Bear season 3. Carmy should be able to respond to Claire&#39;s voicemail in some way, even if they cannot be together, just so they don&#39;t end on such a horrible note. The voicemail is also a good opportunity for Carmy to acknowledge his struggle with maintaining healthy relationships and behaviors.
