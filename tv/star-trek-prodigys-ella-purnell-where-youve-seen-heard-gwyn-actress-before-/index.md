## Literature Review
Ella Purnell voices Gwyndala in Star Trek: Prodigy, but the British actress has also appeared in popular TV series and feature films. 




Ella Purnell voices Gwyndala in Star Trek: Prodigy, and here is where you have seen and heard the talented English actress before. As Gwyn, a heroic young Vau N&#39;Akat, Purnell is one of the lead characters of Star Trek: Prodigy, which is now streaming season 1 on Netflix prior to season 2 premiering in 2024. Along with Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray), Zero (Angus Imrie), Jankom Pog (Jason Mantzoukas), Rok-Tahk (Rylee Alazraqui), Murf (Dee Bradley Baker), and Hologram Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Gwyn saved Starfleet and the galaxy in Star Trek: Prodigy season 1.




Star Trek&#39;s two current hit animated series, Star Trek: Prodigy and Star Trek: Lower Decks, boast major Hollywood names voicing key roles alongside some of the finest and most renowned voice actors in the industry. Co-starring with Ella Purnell, actor and singer Brett Gray (On My Block) voices Dal R&#39;El while comedian Jason Mantzoukas (Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine) plays Jankom Pog, and Purnell&#39;s fellow British actor, Angus Imrie (The Crown), voices Zero. Meanwhile, Star Trek: Lower Decks is led by actor and comedian Tawny Newsome (Space Force) as Lt. Beckett Mariner and Jack Quaid (Scream 5, Oppenheimer) plays Lt. Bradward Boimler, both of whom appeared in live-action in Lower Decks&#39; crossover with Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. However, Ella Purnell&#39;s voice should sound familiar because she has starred in many popular TV series, films, and video game adaptations.

Ella Purnell currently has a hit Showtime live-action series, as she plays Jackie on Yellowjackets. In April 2024, Purnell will lead another major TV show when she appears as Lucy in Fallout, an adaptation of the popular video game premiering on Prime Video. These two roles will add to Purnell&#39;s already stellar resume; the 27-year-old previously starred as Tess in Sweetbitter on STARZ, as Hester Argyl in Agatha Christie&#39;s Ordeal By Innocence, and as Lady Maria Grey in Belgravia.

In Star Trek: Prodigy, Ella Purnell imbues Gwyndala with heart, passion, intelligence, and courage. The daughter and progeny of the Diviner (John Noble), Gwyn turned her back on her father&#39;s evil plan to destroy Starfleet and found a new family among the ragtag young crew of the USS Protostar. Gwyn questions herself and her origins throughout Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, but she comes to realize that she has the power to determine her own destiny, and Gwydala can potentially save the Vau N&#39;Akat from civil war as well.



 What To Expect From Ella Purnell’s Gwyn In Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 
Will Gwyndala reunite with her friends?
         

At the end of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, Gwyndala chose not to attempt to join Starfleet Academy along with Dal and her friends. Instead, Gwyn decided to travel to Solum, the homeworld of the Vau N&#39;Akat, which has not yet achieved First Contact with Starfleet. In the tragic 25th-century future the Diviner came from, the Vau N&#39;Akat destroyed themselves in a civil war after their First Contact with Starfleet. Gwyn hopes her knowledge of Starfleet, the United Federation of Planets, and future events can influence the Vau N&#39;Akat to choose a different path that won&#39;t lead to the ruin of their civilization, thereby making the 25th century the Diviner hails from a preventable alternate reality.




Gwyn&#39;s relationships with her friends, especially her burgeoning romance with Dal, are the heart of Star Trek: Prodigy. Although young Dal and Gwyn do not yet have the emotional maturity for a relationship, there are genuine feelings between the two, as well as a fierce loyalty Gwyndala feels for all of her friends. Gwyn also believes in the ideals of Starfleet and the Federation, and she hopes she can show the Vau N&#39;Akat a better way to save them. Gwyn is a standout new Star Trek character thanks to Ella Purnell&#39;s heartfelt voice acting, and the Star Trek franchise is fortunate to count a talented rising star with mainstream cache like Ella Purnell among its impressive roster of actors.



Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 is streaming on Netflix, and Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix in 2024.
