## Literature Review
Mama June from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo confirmed that star Anna &#34;Chickadee&#34; Cardwell has died of cancer. Find out details below.




Mama June from Here Comes Honey Boo Boo confirmed her daughter Anna &#34;Chickadee&#34; Cardwell has died of cancer. Anna was featured alongside her family on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Toddlers &amp; Tiaras. She was the eldest daughter of June Shannon, the family&#39;s matriarch, and was known for her outspoken personality and protectiveness of her younger siblings. Her sister and reality TV star Alana Thompson was the impetus for the family&#39;s rise to fame.




According to Page Six, Anna passed away on December 10, 2023, at the age of 29, after a battle with Stage 4 adrenal carcinoma. June shared the news via Instagram, saying, &#34;She gave one hell of a fight for 10 months she passed away with her family around her.&#34; Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, also posted about her sister, saying, &#34;This is one post I wish I didnâ€™t have to make ðŸ’” Last night we all surrounded Anna with love &amp; let her know it was okay to go. Unfortunately around 11pm Anna took her last breathe.&#34;


 Alana Mourned Anna&#39;s Death On Instagram 

 

Alana mourned Anna&#39;s death in a heartfelt Instagram post. The former Toddlers &amp; Tiaras and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star wrote a lengthy caption, including, &#34;I really donâ€™t know what to say as my heart is completely broken. Watching my 29 year old sister this last year battle this horrible disease hasnâ€™t been easy,&#34; the 18-year-old reality TV star continued, &#34;Iâ€™m so glad that you waited til i was home to take your last breath! I wouldâ€™ve loved for you to get to see me graduate college but i know you will forever cheer me on in heaven!&#34; While the reality star has struggled since Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, including Alana&#39;s boyfriend getting arrested for an alleged DUI, it&#39;s clear Anna was a source of stability in her life.




Anna was fiercely protective of her siblings on Toddlers &amp; Tiaras and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo as the oldest child in a chaotic household. June wasn&#39;t always the most stable mother and garnered serious backlash for her neglectful parenting. In 2019, it was revealed that June had rekindled her relationship with her ex-boyfriend, Mark McDaniel, who had been convicted of child molestation, leading to the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. She was also arrested along with Geno Doak for drug possession.

Despite June&#39;s questionable parenting skills, she is upset about the loss of her eldest daughter. While Anna&#39;s family was unpredictable, she positively influenced reality TV, openly speaking about her personal struggles. She leaves behind two young daughters who need the support of their family and fans. The Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star will undoubtedly be missed and was taken far too soon from the world.
