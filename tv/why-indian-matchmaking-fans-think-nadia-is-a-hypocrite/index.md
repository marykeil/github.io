## Literature Review
Indian Matchmaking star Nadia Jagessar returned for season 2. However, she didn&#39;t make a good impression after season 1.





Aparna Shewakramani, Pradhyuman Maloo, and Nadia returned in Indian Matchmaking season 2. While Aparna moved to New York with her initial flame Jay Wadhwani, he was quickly friend-zoned. Pradhyuman was introduced to a new girlfriend, Ashima Chauhan, whom he proposed to and married on the show. Meanwhile, while there was a prospect of Nadia and Shekar Jayaraman&#39;s union at the end of season 1, Nadia dumped Shekar shortly into the season.





 Nadia And Shekar Had Potential On Indian Matchmaking 
          

Indian Matchmaking season 2 began on a hopeful note for the couple, as Shekar traveled from Chicago to New Jersey to spend time with Nadia’s family. Several times throughout the meeting, Nadia’s parents shared their frustration over Nadia and Shekar not getting engaged. Following the time spent with her family, Nadia arranged a mixer featuring several other marriage hopefuls, most of whom were working with matchmaker Sima Taparia. This is where she met her next flame, Vishal Kalyanasundaram, a man seven years her junior, whom she made out with on the dance floor later that night in front of Shekar.

This prompted Nadia to break up with Shekar over FaceTime after he returned to Chicago. She insisted that their romance had fizzled out, whereas Shekar argued that Nadia was the one who made them slow down. Shekar was left in tears, retreating from the camera, and confused about where they had gone wrong. Nadia continued pursuing her relationship with Vishal until he unceremoniously dumped her in Los Angeles after traveling out to see her. Despite Indian Matchmaking star Sima’s past request that Nadia find someone age-appropriate, Nadia continued her relationship with Vishal. This left fans believing she got her karma for being a hypocrite to Shekar.



 Indian Matchmaking Fans Spoke Out Against Nadia 
          

Angry Indian Matchmaking fans did not hold back online. One Twitter user, Abha, said, “Love the instant karma in Indian matchmaking. Nadia rejected Shekhar, saying I like you as a friend and got rejected by the same excuse. Vinesh rejected a girl saying there is no chemistry basically saying she is not hot and got rejected in the same way, lol.” Another user, pillow thoughts, said, “My heart is breaking he is so lovely… i feel like Nadia simply found Vishal that little bit more physically attractive. Nothing else makes sense. Poor Shekar”.




Nadia did have a hopeful ending for herself, establishing that she still believed in love after Indian Matchmaking. She doesn&#39;t appear to currently be in a relationship, but she&#39;s still living her best life away from the online hate. Hopefully, she finds love one day, but in the meantime, Nadia is doing well for herself.
