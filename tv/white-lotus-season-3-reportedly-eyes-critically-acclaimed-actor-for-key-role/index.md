Carrie Coon is a critically acclaimed actor with an impressive television resume, including roles in two HBO shows. The actress first starred as a grieving mother Nora Durst in HBO&#39;s The Leftovers, winning a Critics&#39; Choice Television Award for her performance. Coon currently stars as the aspiring socialite Bertha Russell in The Gilded Age, which was recently renewed for a third season on HBO. The actress also has prior experience in an anthology series, playing the dedicated police officer Gloria Burgle in FX&#39;s Fargo season 3, for which she was nominated for an Emmy.

After the first two seasons were set in Maui and Sicily, respectively, The White Lotus season 3 will reportedly be filmed in Thailand and, according to creator Mike White, will provide a &#34;satirical look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality.&#34; Another report suggests The White Lotus season 3 characters will include &#34;a patriarch, a corporate executive, an actress, a few moms, a misfit, and a yoga enthusiast,&#34; one of which Coon could be playing. Given her versatility and ability to portray complex characters with emotional depth, Coon would be perfect for any character in The White Lotus season 3.






The White Lotus season 3 is expected to premiere in 2025, according to HBO chief Casey Bloys.
