 How Did Gabe Honor His Wife Raquell? 

 

Over Valentine&#39;s Day week in 2022, Gabe took to his Instagram to share some cute photos of himself with Raquell. In his post, Gabe pointed out he&#39;s been married to the love of his life for four years, saying all his dreams have come true.

 Gabe And Raquell Have A Happy Marriage 
          

Gabe&#39;s post illustrated the depths of his relationship with Raquell and how well they know each other. While the first photo showed the couple in a precious moment, the second snap highlighted their goofy sides. Raquell and Gabe had their tongues sticking out to pull a funny face or catch a snowflake.

Gabe&#39;s post was also lovely to see for another reason. Alaskan Bush People showed the Brown family coping with their most significant loss to date and trying their best to move on. The past two years have been extremely hard for the Wolf Pack after they lost Billy to a seizure. Gabe was revealed to have been the one to dial 911 the night his father passed away. Viewers heard the dispatch call during the season. While Gabe may still be mourning, he makes sure to live every day to its fullest and cherish the ones he loves. Hopefully, his relationship with Raquell and their children will continue to bring him solace throughout 2023. Although there wasn&#39;t a special post, they have been married for over five years.
