## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s winner Jag Bains may have been known for his charming personality, but which of his critical social moves in the game does he regret?




Big Brother season 25 winner Jag Bains may have played a strategic game, but there&#39;s one social move he regrets about his overall gameplay strategy. With 100 days in the Big Brother 25 house having come and gone, Jag, Matt Klotz, and Bowie Jane entered the two-hour live finale, each ready to take home the $750,000 grand prize. After Jag won the final Head Of Household title of the season, he chose to evict Bowie and bring Matt to the final 2. Jag stepped up his game, owning each move of the season in an impressive set of answers to the jury&#39;s questions, and ultimately took home the grand prize.




After his win, Jag was interviewed about his overall game, and Parade asked about one specific move he made in the house. In the final weeks of competition, Jag, Matt, and Bowie cooked up a plan to make 63-year-old Felicia Cannon frazzled in order to ensure she’d lose the upcoming HOH competition. When confronted with his actions, Jag shared that he felt “that one did get out of hand, for sure. I&#39;ll own up to that...that&#39;s not something that ever was going to happen, or that I ever wanted to happen, truly.”


 Jag Bains Denies Being Cocky During Big Brother 25 Finale Speech 
          

Jag explained that his plans against Felicia were &#34;not, I think, true to who I am, or my character, or how I wanted to play the game&#34;, but there were other moments where he felt authentic about his moves. When asked about his intense final speech to the jurors of Big Brother 25, Jag shared with EW that he didn&#39;t feel it was cocky or aggressive, but &#34;I was getting passionate...this is who I am. I played this game, I&#39;m going to own up to it. And at the end of the day, I did have a lot of people&#39;s blood on my hands.&#34; 





 

While Jag defended his gameplay, the fact that he owned up to his actions on Big Brother is exactly why he won the game. During the finale, Jag finally owned up to making some of the most betraying moves of the season. Taking responsibility for nearly every eviction for the members of the jury of 7, Jag explained that in order to win Big Brother 25, he had to hurt people he&#39;d come to care about but took accountability for doing so and impressed the jurors he backstabbed. Big Brother 25 runner-up Matt Klotz was unable to defend his game moves, while Jag owned them entirely.

Big Brother 25&#39;s jury was able to deliberate prior to the live two-hour finale, and for some time, it seemed like they could&#39;ve landed on Matt as the winner of the game. After some impressive answers and a speech that explained his gameplay style, Jag was able to take home the grand prize for his efforts. Though he may have gone too far in some aspects of the game, Jag&#39;s ability to take responsibility for his actions pushed him to the end of Big Brother season 25 as the most impressive player left standing.
