## Literature Review
Jeri Ryan&#39;s Seven of Nine joined the cast of Star Trek: Voyager in season 4, shaking up the dynamic of Voyager&#39;s crew in good and challenging ways.




Jeri Ryan&#39;s Seven of Nine joined the cast of Star Trek: Voyager in season 4, which led to some understandable frustrations among the already-established cast members. Over the course of Voyager&#39;s seven seasons, Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) commanded the USS Voyager through the unexplored Delta Quadrant on the long journey back to Earth. The introduction of former Borg drone Seven of Nine and the departure of Jennifer Lien&#39;s Kes in Voyager season 4 shook up the show and created a new dynamic among the cast. With her knowledge of Borg technology, Seven of Nine proved to be instrumental in helping Voyager return home, and the character quickly became popular with fans.




Along with Captain Janeway, Seven of Nine has become one of Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s most enduring characters, as she returned to the franchise in Star Trek: Picard. Seven&#39;s journey from Borg drone to accomplished Starfleet officer has been fascinating to watch, but Seven&#39;s introduction had its fair share of difficulties. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Jeri Ryan talks about her experience joining the cast of Star Trek: Voyager in season 4. Read her full quote below:


When my character was added, it was a difficult situation. It’s always hard when you’re writing out one character who’s been there from the beginning and you’re adding a new person. And this was season four, which is never an easy or comfortable situation. There is no best-case scenario. One of the problems with Seven in terms of the other cast members and their characters is that you had a character that was so rich to begin with that the writers wanted to write for her. The writers would be salivating to write for anybody new after three years, so a disproportionate number of episodes had Seven as the A-storyline or a very strong B-storyline, which can be frustrating for actors who have been there for years. And then you add on the fact that Paramount was very clear—they made no bones about it—that they saw this as their chance to break Star Trek into the mainstream media. They said that verbatim in publicity meetings before the character launch, that the sexy part of her was a way of catching attention outside of sci-fi. And they actually did it, which is why you saw a huge jump in the ratings. People who weren’t traditionally sci-fi fans who hadn’t watched before, began to watch, because you had to attract their attention. So the marketing was successful, but that was not going to be easy for the actors who have been plugging away for the three previous years. And understandably so.





                  Star Trek: Voyager’s Best Captain Janeway &amp; Seven of Nine Episodes   Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) had essential roles on Star Trek: Voyager. Here&#39;s a look at their best episodes.    


 Seven of Nine&#39;s Star Trek Story Needs To Continue 
Seven of Nine can be the next female Captain to lead a Star Trek show.
         

Seven of Nine made a triumphant return to Star Trek in Star Trek: Picard season 1 as a member of the Fenris Rangers. Before joining this vigilante group, Seven had tried to join Starfleet, but her application had been rejected due to her Borg past (and despite protests from Admiral Janeway). Seven joined Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) on his adventures in Picard seasons 1 and 2, eventually finding her way back to Starfleet. By Star Trek: Picard season 3, Seven was serving as the first officer on the USS Titan under the command of Captain Liam Shaw (Todd Stashwick).




Star Trek: Picard season 3 ends with Captain Seven of Nine in command of the newly rechristened USS Enterprise-G, preparing to boldly go on even more adventures. With Commander Raffi Musiker (Michelle Hurd) as Seven&#39;s first officer and Ensign Jack Crusher (Ed Speleers) as her special advisor, Star Trek: Picard provided the perfect setup for a spin-off. Despite this, the fan-demanded Picard spin-off, Star Trek: Legacy, seems dead in space. Star Trek: Voyager introduced some amazing new characters to the Star Trek franchise, and Seven of Nine has had a wonderful story arc that needs to continue.



Star Trek: Voyager &amp; Star Trek: Picard are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
