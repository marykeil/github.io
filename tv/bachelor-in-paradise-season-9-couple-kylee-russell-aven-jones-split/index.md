## Literature Review
Just two days after the BIP finale revealed that Kylee Russell and Aven Jones were still a couple, allegations of infidelity have split them apart.




Two days after the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale aired, Kylee Russell and Aven Jones have broken up. Before Paradise, Kylee and Aven had been flirting a bit online, as Aven had liked some of her pictures and even left a fire emoji on one. They had a drama-free relationship until the last days of Paradise when Kylee began to push for an engagement, but Aven wasn&#39;t ready to propose. However, in the end, they left the show together as a couple. In the updates segment at the end of the season finale, the show revealed that they were still going strong. They even shared an announcement about their relationship on Instagram.




However, in an Instagram story, Kylee revealed that she and Aven had broken up due to his alleged cheating. She wrote, &#34;I want to thank my God he did not allow me to live another day in the dark. In the last 24 hours I have been grasping with the fact that one of the most important relationships in my life has dissolved due to multiple infidelities.&#34; Kylee continued, &#34;This is not just a show but my real life and for the foreseeable future I will be in a time of healing and trying to put the puzzle pieces of my life back together.&#34; Kylie concluded her post by asking for privacy and expressing her love for everyone.

 Aven Jones Responds To Kylee Russell’s Infidelity Claims 
          




The following day, Aven responded to Kylee&#39;s post in an Instagram story of his own. He wrote, &#34;After careful thought and consideration into writing this I want to first and foremost apologize to Kylee, my family and my friends for my actions. I have made major mistakes in the relationship and hurt someone who was very close to me.&#34; Aven continued, &#34;At this time, I am in an extremely extremely low place trying to work on myself. I am doing my best to find healing, find myself and be a better person.&#34; He concluded by asking for grace and respect for Kylee and her family through this difficult time.


 

It&#39;s shocking that Aven has pretty much admitted to cheating on Kylee, especially since he&#39;s been regarded as one of the Bachelor Nation &#34;good guys&#34; since he was Rachel Recchia&#39;s runner-up on The Bachelorette season 19. He even came to Rachel&#39;s rescue during the &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; segment when she and her ex-fiancé, Tino Franco, were discussing their breakup due to his infidelity. Although Aven had told Kylee that he wasn&#39;t ready for an engagement, he seemed very committed to her and making their relationship work outside of Paradise. They&#39;ve spent the past few months since filming wrapped together, but now their relationship has come to a sad ending.




Hopefully, Aven will get the help he needs to get through this situation. Although he made a mistake, he needs support if he feels that he&#39;s in a low place. Kylee also deserves grace, love, and support through this difficult time. Bachelor in Paradise has had many post-show breakups over the years, but this one is particularly surprising. As Kylee said in her Instagram story, this is not just a television show, but their real lives, and they should be given the privacy they need moving forward. Kylee and Aven were one of Bachelor in Paradise season 9&#39;s most solid couples on the show, but they will now go their separate ways.
