## Literature Review
These incredible Korra and Asami cosplays make quite the case for a live-action Legend of Korra adaptation, especially in the wake of Netflix&#39;s ATLA.




A few incredible Korra and Asami cosplays make quite the case for a live-action Legend of Korra adaptation, especially in the wake of Netflix&#39;s live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender TV series. Created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, The Legend of Korra is a sequel to ATLA. Set in a world where some people can manipulate one of the four elements — water, earth, fire, or air — the series features a being called the Avatar, born once in a generation, who&#39;s capable of bending all four elements. Not only that, but the Avatar, a bridge between the spirit and physical worlds, is tasked with maintaining balance.
While Avatar: The Last Airbender centers on Avatar Aang, The Legend of Korra focuses on his successor, the defiant Avatar Korra. Over the course of Korra&#39;s four seasons, the young Avatar becomes a strong, capable, and balanced hero. Some of Korra&#39;s success stems from the support of her friends, including Asami Sato — a skilled engineer and heir to her industrialist father&#39;s fortune. In the series finale, Korra and Asami&#39;s relationship turns romantic.TheLegend of Korra&#39;s sequel comics explores their queer love story more deeply, making Korra and Asami&#39;s dynamic one of the most enduring and beloved aspects of the series.









 








 10  The Distracted Korra Meme Adds Levity To The Show&#39;s Love Triangle 


Avatar: The Last Airbender fans have plenty of unpopular opinions about Korra, but most viewers can likely agree on one thing: Korra and Asami were the superior LoK pairing. In Book 1: Air, the show really plays into the love triangle between Korra, Mako, and Asami. When Mako and Asami start dating, Korra is clearly envious. Although she tries to keep her distance from Asami at first, Korra realizes just how great the brilliant engineer is as a person. That said, this distracted Korra meme hammers home how much fun a live-action Legend of Korra could have now that the outcome of the love triangle is a known quantity.





 9  Book 1 Korra &amp; Asami Share A Quiet Moment 


In hindsight, Korra and Asami share a lot of sweet moments before they walk off into the Spirit World together in the series finale. Although they aren&#39;t portrayed as overtly romantic — unfortunately, the Nickelodeon of yesteryear wasn&#39;t as keen on uplifting LGBTQ&#43; characters and relationships — there&#39;s clearly a spark between them. This stellar Korrasami cosplay captures a quiet moment between the pair, proving that Korra and Asami&#39;s relationship is something that deserves to be showcased more, especially if a live-action Korra adaptation comes to fruition.





 8  Korra Flexes Her Avatar Strength 


There&#39;s no doubt about it: Korra and Asami are two of the strongest female characters in The Legend of Korra — in terms of strength of character, anyway. Korra might take the cake for feats of physical strength, but Asami certainly holds her own on the battlefield. Despite being a non-bender, Asami is skilled at hand-to-hand combat and can pilot just about anything. Even though Asami doesn&#39;t need a romantic partner to uplift her, there&#39;s something incredibly charming about this fun Korrasami photo shoot.





 7  Team Avatar Squad Goals 


Some of the best Legend of Korra episodes feature the full Team Avatar — Korra, Asami, and the pro-bending brothers, Mako and Bolin. The chemistry between the show&#39;s cast of characters is great all around, but the blend of comedic moments and action-packed thrills that come from Team Avatar&#39;s hangouts are unrivaled. This cosplay captures the easy dynamic between the foursome, reiterating how great it would be to see the group of teenage heroes in a live-action Legend of Korra adaptation.





 6  The Korrasami Kiss That Never Was On The Original Legend Of Korra 


While Korra and Asami hold hands and walk into the Spirit World together at the end of The Legend of Korra, the couple don&#39;t get to share many &#34;firsts&#34; on screen. At the time, the network wasn&#39;t comfortable with such explicit queer representation, forcing the show&#39;s creators to hide Korrasami in the subtext. As this poignant moment between these two cosplayers proves, fans were robbed of seeing Korra and Asami&#39;s relationship milestones play out in the TV series. That said, it&#39;s a storyline Avatar Studios needs to explore, even if it just adapts the wonderful Legend of Korra comic book series.





 5  Find Someone Who Looks At You Like Korra Looks At Asami 


While some viewers were upset that the titular protagonist&#39;s experiences in Book 2: Spirits resulted in Korra losing her Avatar connection to her past lives, these isolating moments are crucial to Korra&#39;s series-long arc. By the end of Book 3: Change, Korra loses her sense of self — the physicality that&#39;s defined her. All of these moments push Korra to look inward, and the only person to draw her out of this seclusion is Asami. When Korra and Asami reunite at a Republic City restaurant in Book 4: Balance, their romantic feelings for each other are clear. The look shared between these cosplayers captures that sense of tenderness perfectly.





 4  Korra &amp; Asami Hit The Gym 


In Book 3: Change, Team Avatar heads to Ba Sing Se while searching for Airbenders. Waiting on the petulant queen, the group is forced to kill time. For Bolin and Mako, that means running into some long-lost family members, but for Korra and Asami, that means getting some training in. Although Asami agrees to be Korra&#39;s sparring partner, she clearly regrets it a little — the Avatar punches hard, after all, especially when she&#39;s frustrated. This cosplay of Korra and Asami hitting the gym feels like an ode to that small moment, but also a look at what could be in a more Korrasami-forward live-action adaptation.





 3  Korra &amp; Asami Share A Kiss At The Beach 


Not only were Korrasami fans robbed of getting to see their preferred pairing in the animated series, they were robbed of beautifully animated scenes centered on the couple. Ahead of the series finale, Asami brings Korra a cup of tea while they plot their next move on Air Temple Island. The sky is a striking violet; it&#39;s a kind of romantic setting the couple wasn&#39;t normally treated to — not until they walk into the Spirit World portal as the show ends. This cosplay moment on the beach underscores all the small, sweet moments that a live-action adaptation could bring to the screen.





 2  Asami &amp; Korra Strike A Pose 


The Legend of Korra&#39;s main characters have iconic scenes in spades, from Korra finally unlocking her airbending while facing off against Amon to Asami&#39;s daredevil pilot moves in the series finale. However, the show is also full of small, character-driven moments that feel equally cool. For starters, that time Asami takes Korra for a spin at the Satomobile racetrack. This cheeky cosplay shows the couple striking poses in a way that is carefree and fun. The animated Legend of Korra boasted plenty of light-hearted moments, but it could have used more between Korra and Asami.





 1  Korra &amp; Asami Have A Swim At The Sato Mansion 


Unlike other Korrasami cosplays, this one recreates a specific scene from The Legend of Korra&#39;s first season. When Mako and Bolin are without a place to stay, Asami opens the doors to her family&#39;s estate. Begrudgingly, Korra joins her friends for a swim. Not only does this recreation highlight one of the show&#39;s more amusing sequences — teenagers just being teenagers, even as the threat of Amon looms — but the moment illustrates the fun steampunk-meets-1920s design of The Legend of Korra&#39;s world, and how delightful that would look in a live-action adaptation.
