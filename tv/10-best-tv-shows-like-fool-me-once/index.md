## Literature Review
Though Fool Me Once won&#39;t get a second season on Netflix, multiple other dramas and thrillers exist that offer a similar storyline and themes.




Multiple TV shows exist like Netflix&#39;s Fool Me Once that offer similar themes, storylines, and genres. In this fast-paced thriller, a veteran named Maya Stern becomes distressed when she sees her murdered husband playing with her daughter in the security footage of her home. Adapted from the eponymous novel by Harlan Coben, Fool Me Once became an instant success, hitting the top ten list for the most popular shows on Netflix.
Part of the success of the series can be attributed to the Fool Me Once cast, which includes both established actors and up-and-comers. Michelle Keegan offers a compelling performance as her character Maya questions whether her husband is still alive after his funeral. Additionally, the storyline keeps the audience guessing about who&#39;s keeping secrets and why they&#39;re behaving suspiciously. Fool Me Once won&#39;t be back for season 2, but there are many other series that audiences can watch to get similar enjoyment.
            
 
 30 Best Thrillers On Netflix 
Netflix is home to some of the most unique, tense, and incredible thrillers in cinema history but what are the best ones on the platform?













 








 10  The Watcher (2022) 
High-Tension Series with Mysteries
        

Netflix’s The Watcher tells the story of the Brannock family who move into a new house and start receiving a terrifying series of letters from an anonymous figure called “the Watcher.” The husband, Dean, becomes obsessed with unraveling the mystery to the detriment of his family. Both Netflix miniseries are high-tension and incorporate mysteries in the plot. However, The Watcher has a unique angle not present in Fool Me Once. The series is loosely adapted from a true crime that’s still unsolved as of the start of 2024.





 9  A Nearly Normal Family (2023) 
Psychological Thrillers Involving Families


 







The Swedish Netflix series A Nearly Normal Family explores the lengths that the Sandell family will go to protect each other after one member gets accused of the brutal stabbing of a businessperson. While many psychological thrillers relate back to bigger societal systems, both A Nearly Normal Family and Fool Me Once look at the different relationships within families. They also both focus on the impact of grief on the human psyche. A Nearly Normal Family’s book includes darker themes as well including the legal system and sexual assault – something to which the series remains faithful.





 8  Mouse (2021) 
Psychological Thrillers With Mental Health Angles
        

Mouse is a crime thriller K-drama, available to stream on Viki, that follows a rookie police officer and veteran detective who partner up to find a serial killer. Like Fool Me Once, Mouse is fast-paced and compelling. The series both do a good job of giving the audience insight into the confusion that the main characters feel. What sets Mouse apart is the deep psychological question about whether nurture or nature determines psychopathy. The series encourages characters and – by extension – the audience to examine their own biases about mental illness.

 7  Stay   (2021) 
Harlan Coben Adaptations With Connected Deaths


 







Netflix’s British mystery drama Stay   looks at three people whose lives are upended after a disappearance from years ago gets drudged up by a second missing person case. The streaming giant adapted both Fool Me Once and Stay   under the 2018 contract to turn 14 novels by Harlan Coben into a series (via Deadline). These stories from the author also both involve multiple deaths across a large timespan that seem connected. Despite this, Stay   remains unique in that it incorporates multiple points of view into the narrative, giving the series a more dynamic storyline.





 6  You (2018-Present) 
Dramatic Thriller Book Adaptations
        

The Netflix thriller series You follows Joe Goldberg, a man who quickly becomes obsessed with and starts stalking women he encounters. This leads him to commit crimes like kidnapping and murder. Authors Caroline Kepnes and Harlan Coben have extremely similar tones and pacing in their stories, which translates into You and Fool Me Once feeling like they’re within the same universe or related to one another, even though they’re completely different stories. Still, You allows audiences to get into the mind of a criminal, whereas Fool Me Once takes on the perspective of a family member of a victim.
            
 
 5 Reasons Why Joe Will Be A Scarier Villain In You Season 5 
The You season 4 finale presented Joe Goldberg with many opportunities to become the scariest killer he&#39;s ever been, especially with Kate&#39;s influence.









 5  The Crowded Room (2023) 
Dramas With A Psychological Angle
        

Apple TV&#43;’s miniseries The Crowded Room explores the arrest and investigation of a man named Danny Sullivan involved in a shooting in 1979 Manhattan. The interrogator, Rya, learns about Danny’s mysterious past as she attempts to piece together the crime. The Crowded Room is a perfect followup to Fool Me Once because both shows examine the psychology and trauma of the main characters. However, there’s an extra level of intrigue to The Crowded Room since it’s based on the true story of the criminal case of Billy Milligan outlined in the novel The Minds of Billy Milligan by Daniel Keyes.





 4  Devil In Ohio (2022) 
Thrillers With Major Mysteries
        

The Netflix series Devil in Ohio follows a teen named Mae who escapes a satanic cult and gets taken in by a psychiatrist named Dr. Suzanne Mathis. This creates chaos that puts Mae, Dr. Mathis, and her family in danger. Both Devil in Ohio and Fool Me Once include a high-tension mystery that poses a threat to the main characters. In the case of the former, the threat is physical, whereas the threat is mental in the latter show. Devil in Ohio also shines a light on the systems that protect cults and abusers.





 3  Shelter (2023) 
Harlan Corben Adaptations With Dead Family Members
        

In Amazon Prime’s Shelter, a young man named Mickey Bolitar gets roped into an investigation after learning that his dead father might be alive and connected to the dark underbelly of the Kasselton, New Jersey suburb. The popularity of Fool Me Once is a reminder to watch Shelter because both series are adapted from Harlan Corben novels with extremely similar plotlines. They center on someone who’s supposed to be dead seemingly coming back to life. Both series are short and easy to binge-watch, only lasting eight episodes each. Unlike the Netflix series, though, Shelter includes teenage angst and impulsivity due to the age of the characters.





 2  Sharp Objects (2018) 
Atmospheric Dramas With Trauma Storylines


 







The HBO series Sharp Objects looks at a mentally ill reporter named Camille who goes back home to cover the investigation of two teen girls’ murders. As she spends time in her childhood home, she must face her traumatic past. Sharp Objects is a great miniseries to watch after Fool Me Once because both series are atmospheric, well-written, and involve family drama. Both of the main characters also experienced trauma in the past that impact their actions. However, Sharp Objects is a slow-burn that has a more internally-driven narrative, relying on Camille’s introspection during deeply emotional scenes.
Sharp Objects is Oscar-nominee Amy Adams&#39; first major role on the small screen. 






 1  Bloodline (2015-2017) 
Family Dramas With Crime And Murder
        

Netflix’s Bloodline looks at the secrets, lies, and demons underlying the Rayburn family – an integral part of the Florida Keys community. The siblings must decide where their allegiances lie as crimes start leading back to the family. Bloodline is extremely similar to Fool Me Once in the amount of drama and plot twists. While both series include family angles, Bloodline gives a much deeper examination of the various dynamics and conflicts that can occur within a toxic family system. This can make the series relatable, even when the show delves into mysteries and murder.
