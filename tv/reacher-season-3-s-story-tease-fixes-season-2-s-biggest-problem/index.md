## Literature Review
Long before it premieres on Amazon, Reacher season 3&#39;s story tease will be able to address the biggest problem that is currently plaguing season 2. 




Reacher season 3 is poised to fix the biggest disappointment in season 2. Amazon Prime Video&#39;s take on Lee Child&#39;s famed books has become so popular that production for its third year has already started before its sophomore outing even wraps up. It&#39;s a testament to how much Alan Richtson has been embraced as the quintessential live-action version of the character, despite following Tom Cruise&#39;s iteration on the big screen. Despite being its titular character, a big part of its success is based on the people that he interacts with. However, like Child&#39;s books, Reacher takes on an anthology approach to storytelling, meaning it has a rotating cast every season.




In Reacher season 1, Jack found his way to Margrave, Georgia, where he was roped into a string of murders. Initially, he became the suspected murderer, since the crimes began once he arrived. Eventually, he became allies with Margrave PD&#39;s Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) and Oscar Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin). In Reacher season 2, Jack is reunited with his 110th Special Investigations Unit on the heels of the mysterious deaths of some of their former members. Their history with Jack allows for a different kind of dynamic compared to his friends in Margrave, which isn&#39;t exactly a positive thing for Reacher.

                  Reacher Season 2&#39;s Biggest Death Proves Amazon&#39;s Teased Spinoff Would Be Perfect   Reacher season 2, episode 6 features the biggest death of the year thus far, and it further proves that the proposed Amazon spinoff would work.     


 Reacher Season 2&#39;s Character Dynamic Isn&#39;t As Fun As Season 1&#39;s 
Jack loses his air of mystery in Reacher season 2.
         




Reacher season 2 reunites Jack with Frances Neagley (Maria Sten) — the first member of the Special Investigators introduced in the franchise. Their reunion, unfortunately, couldn&#39;t be under worse circumstances, as they re-team after news of their former teammates either dropping dead or going missing. They recruit their surviving members, David O&#39;Donnell (Shaun Sipos) and Karla Dixon (Serinda Swan). Reacher season 2 goes back and forth between their mission at hand and their time in the military, highlighting their bond with each other.

Sadly, their dynamic isn&#39;t as fun to watch compared to Jack&#39;s time with Roscoe and Finlay in Reacher season 1. Unlike his frosty demeanor upon his arrival in Margrave, Jack is more open and relaxed around his peers, which should be refreshing for the series. Instead, it dulls his appeal as a character because it takes away the mysterious air about him — a big part of why it&#39;s so fascinating to watch him navigate different kinds of situations. Additionally, seeing him engage in banter while still maintaining his matter-of-fact approach to things is absent in Reacher season 2.






 Season 3 Will Put Reacher In Unfamiliar Surroundings Again 
Jack will have to figure out who his foes and allies are again in Reacher season 3. 
          

By Reacher season 3, Richtson teases that Jack will find himself isolated in a new city. Unlike season 2, which heavily leans on his time with the military as it assembles the 110th Special Investigations Unit, the former military police-turned-wandered will be put in a position where he is on his own — similar to the kind of situation he was in when he first arrived in Margrave in Reacher season 1. This means that Jack will meet new foes and, more importantly, allies, effectively bringing back his closed-off demeanor before slowly opening up to his new allies.

Granted that Reacher season 2 features a mystery about a potential traitor within the Special Investigations Unit, somehow it isn&#39;t as compelling as Jack having to defend himself from being accused of murder in a new city only to find out that one of the murder victims was his own brother. There&#39;s no doubt that Jack can take care of himself, but it&#39;s highly entertaining to see him build a team around him, especially since he isn&#39;t exactly great with social cues despite being extremely observant.




                  Who Was Reacher&#39;s Brother? What Joe Did Before His Season 1 Death   As Jack&#39;s investigation into Swan&#39;s ties to New Age in Reacher season 2 gets more complicated, he gets some unexpected help from his brother, Joe.     



 Why Jack Reacher Is Best When Surrounded By New People 
Jack&#39;s reunion with Finlay is one of the best moments of Reacher season 2 thus far.
          

Reacher season 1 showed the reason why Jack is best when he is surrounded by new people. Narratively, it&#39;s so much more satisfying to see his bond develop with people that he meets during his time wandering the country. It highlights one of the aspects of his hobo lifestyle. Jack&#39;s dynamic with Roscoe and Finlay became the backbone of Reacher season 1, hence why it&#39;s so disappointing that they weren&#39;t primary players in season 2.

Finlay did return for Reacher season 2, but it is nothing but a cameo. Still, even their short reunion is more impactful than getting back together with O&#39;Donnell and Dixon because their history didn&#39;t fully play out on the screen. Neagley is unique because she was already introduced in season 1, meaning viewers already have an idea of their dynamic and connection. Moving forward, it&#39;s better for Jack to forge new connections, and Reacher season 3 putting him in an entirely new setting can do that.






Reacher season 2 drops new episodes every Friday on Amazon Prime Video.




             Reacher Produced by Amazon Prime Video, Reacher adapts Lee Child&#39;s Jack Reacher book series to live-action. The series follows veteran Military Police Officer Jack Reacher as he unravels a dangerous conspiracy in the fictional town of Margrave, Georgia. Played by the towering Alan Ritchson, the titular hero collaborates with officer Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) and Chief Detective Oscar Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin) to clean his name and save Margrave from crime and corruption.
