## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor lead, Gerry Turner, allegedly lied about his dating life and work history, meaning he spun a false narrative on the show.




Evidence suggests that The Golden Bachelor lead, Gerry Turner, allegedly lied about his dating life and work history on the show. Gerry is the first lead in the pioneering Bachelor Nation spinoff focusing on seniors trying to find love. Gerry began his The Golden Bachelor journey dating 22 women, and he has narrowed his pool down to just two women, Theresa Nist and Leslie Fhima. Gerry has become America&#39;s senior sweetheart after showcasing what viewers have thought was a genuinely well-intentioned and empathetic demeanor.




According to The Hollywood Reporter, Gerry spun a false narrative on the show. He had a rich dating history that started only one month after his late wife, Toni, died. Apparently, he carried on an almost three-year-long relationship with a woman 14 years younger (who wants to stay anonymous.) Unlike the sweet and empathetic character Gerry portrays on The Golden Bachelor season 1, Gerry was allegedly cruel to his ex when they split. The deep dive report also called out Gerry for not having retired at 55 as a restauranteur, as he said. Gerry worked odd jobs, including as a hot tub installer and maintenance man.

 How Did The Golden Bachelor’s Gerry Break Up With Carolyn? 
         




Gerry met his ex at his maintenance man job at a mental health facility where his former flame worked. Gerry sent her amorous text messages with very similar pining verbiage to things he said on the show to the ladies. Gerry and his ex, reportedly corroborated by texts and first-person accounts, dated ten months before she moved into his lakeside home in Indiana. They dated for a year and a half before the breakup. Gerry allegedly broke up with the woman by telling her, &#34;I’m not taking you to the reunion looking like that.&#34; as he pointed to her body while she was packing to go on a high school reunion trip with him. She said she had gained ten pounds.

Moreover, Gerry&#39;s jaded ex said the invitation revocation led to their breakup and that she fell down the stairs and injured her foot, requiring surgery, while she was trying to gather her things and move out. Gerry allegedly accused her of prolonging her exit from the house and wanting to sue him for the injury. Gerry&#39;s behavior during the breakup sure doesn&#39;t sound like the lovable Gerry viewers have gotten to know. What&#39;s more, according to a waitress at a restaurant Gerry frequented who considered him a friend, Gerry dated several women up until his The Golden Bachelor stint. ABC and Gerry declined to comment on the eye-opening report.




Gerry&#39;s romantic life as a widower does not align with what he has said on the show. Whether Gerry has been lying to America to preserve his image or whether the network itself wanted to present Gerry in a certain light is unknown. The motivation behind the falsities could be to make Gerry more likable and relatable when, in reality, he has a checkered past that isn&#39;t as endearing as he&#39;s shown on The Golden Bachelor.



The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.
