# Supernatural s Most Underused Characters Pinpoint A Disappointing Trend That Season 16 Could Fix


## SUMMARY 



  Supernatural season 16 could address the show&#39;s lack of central female characters and give them the spotlight they deserve.   The cancellation of the Wayward Sisters spinoff was a missed opportunity to showcase a diverse group of female demon hunters within the Supernatural universe.   If Supernatural season 16 happens, the revival should prioritize and expand the roles of the show&#39;s underutilized female characters.

## Literature Review
Supernatural never solved one of the show&#39;s biggest recurring problems throughout its 15 seasons, but a season 16 revival could fix this issue.




While Supernatural fell into an unfortunate pattern regarding the characters it always seemed to underutilize, season 16 could solve this with a continuation of the show’s story. Supernatural focused on the Winchester brothers, a pair of demon hunters who traveled across America facing off against all manner of paranormal threats. Originally a monster-of-the-week serial in the vein of The X-Files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural grew more focused on serialized plots as the show continued. The final season of Supernatural saw Sam and Dean battle against God himself, an ambitious twist that was set up by later seasons incorporating more angels, demons, and religious figures into the show’s lore. This decision proved divisive when the series ended.




While Supernatural&#39;s season finale did give both brothers a happy ending, the conclusion received a mixed reception among the show’s sizable fandom. Dean’s much-discussed relationship with Castiel remained firmly platonic despite fan expectations, Sam’s later decades were condensed into a fast-paced montage, and many of the final season’s biggest subplots ended with a whimper instead of a bang. Supernatural season 16 could undo this and, in the process, the revival could address a much older issue that plagued the show for years before the ending. Supernatural’s lack of central female characters could be ameliorated in a season 16 reboot.

                  7 Supernatural Supporting Characters Who Could Continue The Show After Sam &amp; Dean   Supernatural ran for an incredible 15 seasons, but if the story is to continue, there are some other characters that deserve to take the spotlight.    


 Most Of Supernatural&#39;s Underutilized Characters Are Women

From Charlie and Bela to Meg and Eve, many of the best female Supernatural characters were sorely underused. To make this problem worse, there was a distinct pattern of Supernatural introducing promising female characters only to kill them off soon after. Supernatural’s best wasted character, Jo, seemed set to become a hunter who could rival either of the Winchester brothers, only for her to be forgotten about for three seasons and killed off when she finally did return. Similarly, the morally ambiguous Meg was ready to play the brothers off Crowley in an ambitious attempt to defeat the demon, but she was killed off before this storyline could come to fruition.

Time and again, Supernatural proved that there were plenty of interesting female characters in the show’s universe only to then forget about them or kill them when they did appear. Dean’s love interest, Anna, had a promising relationship with him but ended up brainwashed and killed off when she returned to Heaven. Missouri Moseley seemed destined to become an older advisor to the boys in the early seasons, only for her to then vanish without explanation. This pattern resulted in a series whose main players were almost exclusively male when Supernatural season 15 rolled around, with female characters being largely limited to minor players and love interests.






 Wayward Sisters&#39; Canceled Spinoff Highlighted Supernatural&#39;s Female Character Problem 
Supernatural’s Wayward Sisters spinoff could have solved this issue
          

Supernatural season 13, episode 10, “Wayward Sisters,” attempted to redress this imbalance. A backdoor pilot, “Wayward Sisters” was intended to set up a spinoff that would have focused on a foster family of women orphaned by various supernatural threats. Effectively a bigger, female-led Supernatural, Wayward Sisters would have recast the central demon hunters as women. Not only that but the group would also have been connected by their shared origins instead of biological family. The Wayward Sisters varied in terms of age, ethnicity, and background, thus offering the show a more varied lineup than Supernatural’s pair of leading men. Unlike the Winchesters, they represented a diverse cross-section of society.

This made the spinoff a promising prospect since it would have felt like more than a mere retread of the Supernatural formula. Wayward Sisters taking place in the show’s universe meant it could have shared lore, characters, and monsters with the original show, but its unique premise offered an opportunity for the spinoff to make up for Supernatural&#39;s shortcomings when it came to female characters. However, the CW didn’t make Wayward Sisters, meaning the standalone episode was the only chance that fans got to see this group of female demon hunters in action. Although this is a shame, all hope isn’t lost for the franchise.






 How A Supernatural Season 16 Could Fix The Original Series&#39; Disappointing Trend 
Supernatural’s revival can prioritize the show’s underrated female stars
          

If Supernatural season 16 happens, the show needs to put its female characters front and center. Since death isn’t permanent in the world of the series, most of the underused characters who appeared throughout the original show could still come back in this revival. However, even if the show doesn’t take this path, its singularly male-centric worldview still needs to change. Sam and Dean could gain a female accomplice or work together with a new demon hunter, either of which would allow the show to expand its short list of major female characters. This is the least that Supernatural could do after a disappointing streak of wasted women stars.
