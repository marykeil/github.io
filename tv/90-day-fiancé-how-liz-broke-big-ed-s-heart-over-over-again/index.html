Big Ed denies the rumors of their split, but Liz is focused on showing how much happier she is without him.   Liz experienced verbal and mental abuse from Big Ed, as captured in a leaked phone call, and she repeatedly went back to him despite red flags.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Liz Woods is taking revenge for the times Big Ed Brown hurt and manipulated her when they were in their toxic relationship.</p>
<p>90 Day: The Last Resort couple Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods have split, and the San Diego woman could be the reason. Big Ed first entered the franchise in a relationship with Rose Vega from the Philippines. However, Rose broke up with him, and Big Ed returned home with a broken heart. He then began romancing Liz, a waitress manager at a local restaurant. Big Ed manipulated Liz into dating him, and although she was resistant, she agreed to be Big Ed’s girlfriend.</p>
<p>Liz never seemed happy in the relationship. However, now Liz is looking very different in 2024 after she broke up with Big Ed and has reportedly started dating someone new. Big Ed and Liz were a problematic couple, not only because of their 28-year age gap, but because there were several heated arguments on screen. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s time for Liz to show Big Ed she is better off without him.</p>

<p>Liz Woods Is Flaunting A New Man
Meanwhile, Big Ed Denies Split Rumors</p>
<p>Liz started posting dates with a mystery man sometime in November 2023. Liz went to a painting party with him and even posted boomerangs of her clinking cocktail glasses with him on Instagram. Liz didn’t reveal whether it was a new person, but evidently, the body that was visible in the photos and videos didn’t belong to Big Ed. Liz repeatedly started posting content revolving around her man and even celebrated New Year’s with him by sharing a photo of them holding hands. Liz captioned a different story, “his stubborn princess,” which showed him bending down and tying her shoelaces.</p>
<p>While Liz was busy in San Diego spending time with her new boyfriend, Big Ed did an Instagram Live in December 2023, claiming, “Liz and I are still together, I’m happy as can be.” Liz is in no mood to entertain Big Ed’s delusions. Her only goal right now is to move on from Big Ed. Liz’s actions could be making her new boyfriend feel used and think Liz is only using him to get back at Big Ed. She’s also genuinely showing off her newfound happiness to the world after having been in a toxic relationship for all these years.</p>
<p>Liz Woods Accused Big Ed Brown Of Abuse
Big Ed Had Dropped The F-bomb 19 Times</p>
<p>In May 2021, a leaked phone call between Big Ed and Liz circulated online. It revealed Big Ed had allegedly been verbally and mentally abusive towards Liz. The audio had Big Ed yelling at Liz for giving her co-worker a ride home (as shared by @90daycouple.) He repeatedly used abusive language, called Liz stupid, and refused to give her a chance to explain herself. Big Ed kept making Liz feel like she had committed a crime while she desperately begged him to let her explain the situation. During the call, Liz even mentioned that Big Ed had approved her request when she asked for permission.</p>
<p>Big Ed had said sure at first and then turned on Liz to belittle and gaslight her about the incident and shame her even though he had told her he had no problem with her dropping off the co-worker. Big Ed said “f<strong>k you” to Liz multiple times in the four-minute-long conversation while adding that she was “f</strong>ked in the head.” Liz broke down in tears when he called her names and demeaned her. Meanwhile, Liz posted a quote on Instagram that read, &ldquo;At the beginning of the relationship, the narcissist will get to know you very well.”</p>
<pre><code>              90 Day Fiancé: Liz Woods Failed Big Ed (Was She Using Him?)   90 Day Fiancé star Liz Woods recently teased fans about a new romance after reportedly marrying Big Ed, which shows she never loved him.    
</code></pre>
<p>“He will want to know everything about you. You truly open up to him and share everything, but then the mask slips, you realize that he uses those things against you,” it continued. It wasn’t the only instance where Big Ed came across as abusive towards Liz. During the 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7 Tell All, Liz claimed Big Ed had kicked her out of his house and given her less than a week to move. Liz had to stay on her friends’ couches before moving into her own apartment. However, Liz was still spending her nights at Big Ed’s.</p>
<p>Liz Woods Was An On-Again Off-Again Partner
Liz Kept Returning To Big Ed Despite Red Flags</p>
<p>Liz had gone back to Big Ed after the phone call, accusing him of being abusive, spotted him using an Asian dating website, and was exposed for DMing his ex, Rose. By the time of the Tell All, Big Ed and Liz had broken up for the &ldquo;9th or 10th time.” When they came to 90 Day: The Last Resort to give their relationship one last try, they’d been through their thirteenth split. Fans were tired of asking Liz to break up with Big Ed, but somehow, she always ended up going back to him.</p>
<p>Liz may have kept reconciling with Big Ed, thinking he had changed or because she was unwilling to see the truth for what he was. Despite knowing he wasn’t right for her, Liz wore rose-colored glasses and trusted Big Ed to take care of her as she decided to spend the rest of her life with him. She acknowledged that there had been growth in their communication and trust.</p>
<p>“We can and will see the sunrise on all of our tomorrows from this sunset on. Forever, hand in hand, as we are meant to be,” Liz told Big Ed while agreeing to move to Arkansas and giving him an engagement ring she had been holding on to for a year. Liz was waiting for the right time to recommit and finally decided that he was the one she would marry.</p>
<pre><code>              90 Day Fiancé: Liz Woods' Transformation Amid Big Ed Split Rumors Is Shocking (Has She Moved On With A New Man?)   90 Day Fiancé’s Liz Woods’ social media activity and a photo with a mystery man suggest that she’s happy living away from Big Ed’s toxic behavior.   
</code></pre>
<p>Liz Woods&rsquo; Age Gap With Big Ed May Have Ruined Their Relationship
Liz Used Her Age As An Excuse To Quit</p>
<p>Big Ed had accepted the right and agreed to start planning their wedding. The wedding was supposed to have taken place in August 2023. However, Liz being seen with a new man just three months later does confirm that a lot went wrong in their relationship. According to @mac.and.chisme, Liz’s mystery boyfriend is named Jayson and is around 28–29 years old, very close to Liz’s age. Big Ed and Liz had a 28-year age difference between them.</p>
<p>Big Ed being older and insecure about his appearance made him a jealous person and often accused Liz of cheating on him. He was controlling of Liz, even trying to get Liz to lose weight. Big Ed and Liz may have had a great time together, but, given their age difference, there was always a point of contention. The criticism that Liz dealt with for being with Big Ed may have eventually made her realize he wasn’t the right man for her.</p>
<p>Besides, Liz, being young, may have wanted to expand her family, and Big Ed had already let Rose down by not telling her about his desire to not have kids. Big Ed and Liz are rumored to appear in the next season of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?, but until then, fans can put the puzzle pieces together to figure out if it was Liz who was the real villain in this relationship.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
