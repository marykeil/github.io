## Literature Review
As the premiere of 1923 Season 2 draws closer, many questions need answers, and many characters need resolutions to their shocking arcs.




The prequel to Taylor Sheridan&#39;s hit show Yellowstone, 1923, has proved just as popular and intriguing, so with season 2 on the way, there is much anticipation as to how certain storylines will play out. With the fate of so many characters hanging in the balance of what happens in the next season, whatever the outcome of the narrative, it&#39;s certain to be astounding. With almost every major player from the first season signed on for the next installment, no loose ends should be left as the story wraps up.
As with the original series, a central part of the plot is the Dutton family&#39;s ranch and keeping hold of the land no matter what. Premiering in 2022, 1923 tells the story of how the Dutton&#39;s came to control that land and interweaves the complex lives of other people living in the area and the ancestors of the characters in Yellowstone. Utilizing a much more sweeping and grand scale for the series makes the world of 1923 seem much larger than Yellowstone, as the show takes its time revealing how every character is connected.

 1923 Season 2: Renewed, Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know 
The story of the Dutton ranch continues in the 20th century with 1923, and a second season has been announced for more of Cara and Jacob and family.













 








 10  Whitfield Getting What He Deserves 
Never getting his hands on the ranch
        

One of the most formidable villains in the series, Donald Whitfield (Timothy Dalton), uses all the wealth and power at his disposal to undermine the Dutton family and their claim to the land. He made his fortune mining the land and intends to do the same with Paradise Valley. Though he&#39;s only introduced halfway through season 1, he quickly becomes the most formidable opponent Jacob Dutton (Harrison Ford) has ever faced. In season 2, the Duttons are going to have to work together to stop him and make sure that the slimy oilman is run out of town.





 9  If Alexandra Is Pregnant 
How will Spencer react if she is


 







In the season 1 finale, Alexandra (Julia Schlaepfer) and Spencer (Brandon Sklenar) are tragically separated after working so hard to be together, and many subtle hints point to the fact that Alex may be expecting a child. She suffers from sea sickness onboard the ship they&#39;re on, but it could also be attributed to morning sickness. If she is pregnant, it&#39;s going to be a hard journey as she intends to find Spencer again by meeting him in Montana. Additionally, if she has a baby, it opens up the question of who that baby will be in the future, and if that person exists in Yellowstone. 





 8  Zane And Alice Reunited 
Despite their horrible separation in the finale
        

Alice (Joy Osmanski) and Zane (Brian Geraghty) have a kind and loving marriage with children and a full life ahead of them. Regardless, the anti-miscegenation laws prevented people from being in mixed-race relationships, and this cruel and prejudiced government regulation is brutally enforced in the season finale. A group of men shows up at their house and forcefully remove Alice from their home, leaving Zane beaten and unable to stop them. 1923 has shown much of the worst that period of history, but in season 2, if anyone deserves a happy ending and to be left alone, it&#39;s Zane and Alice.





 7  Alex Adjusting To Life In Montanna 
After traveling so far to get there
        

Once Alex and Spencer are back together, it seems that it will be in Montana, and there will be a lot of changes taking place at the ranch. Spencer will have to introduce her to the entire family and Alex will face a culture and environmental shock. Although she is a capable traveler and can handle herself, if she&#39;s pregnant and her family is conspiring to keep her from Spencer, it will be a long road to get to Montana.
There&#39;s also the question of how the rest of the Duttons will feel about Alex and if they will accept her as Spencer&#39;s wife after his long absence. With all the issues facing the Duttons and the ranch, Spencer will be needed to help clean up the mess, and might not have time to be with Alex and help her grow accustomed to the new lifestyle. If Alex gets to Montana and life isn&#39;t what she imagined, that could mean trouble for the already fraught couple.





 6  Jack And Elizabeth Successfully Having A Baby 
Despite their miscarriage
        

One of the saddest moments of the season 1 finale was when Elizabeth (Michelle Randolph) had a miscarriage due to complications with the injury she got earlier in the season. This was a blow for both her and Jack (Darren Mann), who were so excited to welcome a new life into their family. If they can conceive again, it would be wonderful to see them have the family they always wanted, but if not, there is more than one way to build a family. Their child was thought to be the potential father of John Dutton III (Kevin Costner), but fate may have other plans.





 5  Jacob And Cara Having The Family Back Together 
All under one roof


 







Although Jacob and Cara (Helen Mirren) could not have children of their own, they raised John Sr. (Audie Rick) and Spencer themselves after the death of their parents in 1883. With Spencer gone for so many years, and then John Sr.&#39;s death early in the season, it&#39;s been difficult fending for the farm and supporting Jack in his time of need. Enemies have been coming all around, and with the events of the finale, how Jacob and Cara will be able to save the ranch is up in the air. However, if everyone can come back and put up a united front, it will strengthen Jacob and Cara&#39;s resolve.

1923’s Helen Mirren, who portrays Cara Dutton, reflects on her magical dynamic with co-star Harrison Ford, who plays her on-screen husband.









 4  Spencer Accepting Alex&#39;s Royal Background 
Not letting it get in the way of their love
        

Though Spencer was aware that Alex came from money in England, he wasn&#39;t aware of just how high-class she really was. When they encounter her ex-fiancé on the ship at the end of the season, he reveals that she is a Countess, which shakes Spencer to his core. Though it&#39;s possible that he would use this as a reason to keep them apart, it would be satisfying to see him realize that this doesn&#39;t change how they feel about each other and that she chose to be with him no matter what.





 3  How The Duttons Will Pay Whitfield 
Will Jacob take out a mortgage
        

One of the biggest cliffhangers of season 1 is the biggest obstacle to keeping the ranch yet: the debt the Duttons are in with Whitfield. In an underhanded business move, Whitfield pays the property tax on the ranch, which means that the Duttons will have to find the money to pay him back before the end of the year or the ranch will legally be Whitfield&#39;s. Right now, Jacob and Cara barely have the money to feed their animals, much less pay back an enormous debt, and Whitfield knows this. Jacob has long been against taking out a mortgage on the land, but there might not be another choice.





 2  The Identity Of John Dutton III&#39;s Grandparents Revealed 
Is it Jack and Elizabeth or someone else
        

Both 1923 and the prequel 1883 have told the stories of the ancestors of John Dutton III, the protagonist and anti-hero of Yellowstone. One of the major mysteries of 1923 is who his father is, and therefore, who his paternal grandparents are. He must be descended from either Spencer or Jack, but the show has not confirmed who it will be. Once it comes to light, it will give insight into the inner workings of John III&#39;s mind and explain the strong ties he feels to the land.





 1  Teonna And Her Journey To Yellowstone 
Finding some peace after so much hardship


 







Aminah Nieves, who plays Teonna Rainwater, has hopes for Teonna in 1923 season 2. After suffering at the hands of the horrific boarding school for Indigenous youths, she finally escapes and reunites with her father, Runs His Horse (Michael Spears), but her journey is far from over. It&#39;s been surmised that she is the ancestor of Thomas Rainwater (Gil Birmingham), and so she will most likely become involved with the Duttons in Montana at some point. It will be interesting to see how she gets there and, most of all, that she can find safety and happiness along the way.
