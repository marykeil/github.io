## Literature Review

Barrie and Tony Drewitt Barlow brought their relatives along on Below Deck Sailing Yacht,. The two charter guests are known for making LGBTQ&#43; history.





Episodes featuring the Below Deck season 2 stars showed a different sort of trouble in paradise. It turned out that kids could be very fussy eaters. Chef Natasha De Bourg, who said that she is often underestimated because she is pretty, had trouble serving the large family due to all the requests. This strained her relationship with chief stew Daisy Kelliher. It didn&#39;t help that Barrie had taken up with his daughter Saffron Drewitt Barlow&#39;s ex Scott, and welcomed another child into their relationship. In fact, his marriage with Tony broke up because he was having an affair with his daughter&#39;s ex. Saffron drew a line in the sand about Barrie and Scott kissing in front of her. Traveling on a ship with her family proved to be really awkward, especially since Scott was there as well.

 Barrie &amp; Tony Were Fascinating Below Deck Sailing Yacht Guests 

 

Barrie and Tony from the Below Deck franchise are a landmark couple. After a law was passed that legitimized LGBTQ&#43; marriage, they were the first pair of officially recognized gay dads in the United Kingdom. They have five children, and the future reality stars started their parenthood journey by having a set of twins who were conceived with a surrogate mother in Los Angeles. During that time period, gay men generally did not pursue this avenue, and adoption systems had ingrained biases against LGBTQ&#43; couples. Joining forces with a surrogate mother helped to set a precedent for other people who wanted to go the same route.



 Below Deck Sailing Yacht&#39;s Tony &amp; Barrie&#39;s Family Kept Growing 

 




While the couple from Below Deck Sailing Yacht decided to sail through Croatia on the nautical reality series, they eventually stopped being romantic partners, but their separation was amicable. They maintain that their relationship became friendly, rather than romantic. The two chose to focus on being good parents. Barrie is with his daughter&#39;s ex, and Saffron has stated that she would rather not know details about their romance, as Barrie has no filter. Barrie has admitted that it&#39;s weird how he has fallen for someone half his age. Nevertheless, they&#39;re all maintaining relationships with one another.

Barrie and Scott&#39;s baby is named Valentina Willow Drewitt-Barlow, and she was born in October 2020. Tony had throat cancer in the early 2000s. Unfortunately, it returned in 2018. During his treatment, Tony fell for a nurse named Brent, who is significantly younger than him, and a very devoted partner. Part of the reason he signed on as a Below Deck Sailing Yacht charter guest is the fact that Tony wanted to spend every precious moment with his family, including his ex and children.




The two, along with their partners, needed to adjust to spending so much time together. Though they were still present in each other&#39;s lives, they did not want to be romantic partners. Barrie, who seemingly flirted with just about anyone, played a dangerous game. Tony was gracious, but it was unclear if his partner Scott was as patient with Barrie&#39;s personality. Barrie flirting with Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 2 crew member Jean-Luc Cerza Lanaux, right in front of Scott, may have reminded Scott of why Tony and Barrie ended their romantic relationship.
