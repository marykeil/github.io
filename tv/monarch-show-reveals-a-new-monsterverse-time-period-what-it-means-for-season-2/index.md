## Literature Review
The Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 finale featured a sizable time jump. Here&#39;s everything known about the new Monsterverse time period.





Summary

  Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 will explore a new period in the Monsterverse timeline, moving the story to 2017 after a time jump in the season 1 finale.   Keiko and Hiroshi Randa are now part of the show&#39;s principal characters, and they have found an unlikely ally in APEX.   The show may address Monarch&#39;s growing public scrutiny and the risk of more Titans rising to the surface due to Hollow Earth rifts in season 2.  







A time jump in the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 finale moved the story to 2017, setting up a new period in the Monsterverse timeline for season 2 to explore. Events across multiple years were showcased in the series, with Monarch: Legacy of Monsters telling stories set in 1952, 1959, 1962, 1982, and more. But while its approach to its legacy heroes was to run through years of Monarch history, it stuck primarily to 2015 with its modern-day characters. But from the looks of things, that won&#39;t be the case for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2.

A new status quo has been set for the show&#39;s principal characters, as both Keiko - who was once thought to have died in 1959 - and Hiroshi Randa - appear to be part of the fold going forward. What&#39;s more, they&#39;ve seemingly found an unlikely ally in APEX. When Monarch refused to help, Kentaro and the others turned their attention to May&#39;s former boss, thus laying the groundwork for them all to reunite at an APEX base on Skull Island. But due to the strange way that time passes in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; underground world, it&#39;s no longer 2015 for Cate and May.





 What Happened Between 2015 And 2017 In The Monsterverse Timeline 
          

It&#39;s now 2017, three years after the events of Godzilla and two before Godzilla: King of the Monsters. So far, Monsterverse events are confirmed to have happened in 2017 specifically, leaving much of what occurred during this period ambiguous. In regards to Monarch, they stepped out of the shadows in episode 7, meaning that the organization has likely been facing growing public scrutiny for two years now. Chances are, this is a problem that will gradually get worse, as it&#39;s known that they&#39;ll have to answer for their decisions at a Senate hearing in 2019 (as seen in King of the Monsters).

On the other hand, APEX&#39;s situation looks to have improved immensely since 2015. The soon-to-be creators of Mechagodzilla were already a powerful tech company, but their efforts to get May to act as their spy proves that they had a lack of resources when it comes to investigating the Monsterverse Titans. But in 2017, they have a base on Skull Island, a place that occupies a free-roaming Titan (Kong). This goes to show that APEX benefited greatly from whatever &#34;deal&#34; she made with Verdugo in episode 7. That makes sense, considering how optimistic about the future Holland was when mentioning their arrangement to Walter Simmons over the phone.






 What Still Needs To Happen Before Godzilla: King Of The Monsters 
Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has already done well to fill in the gap between Godzilla and its sequel. Before the show, it was understood that between the two films, Monarch&#39;s secrecy had to end, and the series did indeed cover this missing Monsterverse moment. But while this was the biggest unseen plot development known to have happened between the two films, that doesn&#39;t mean season 2 doesn&#39;t have room for more twists and turns. After all, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters created its own timeline gap via Lee Shaw&#39;s Hollow Earth plan.

Because of his actions, other Hollow Earth rifts are receiving massive spikes in gamma radiation, thus creating a risk of more Titans rising to the surface. It&#39;s important to note that in spite of all the destruction wrought by Ghidorah in King of the Monsters, the Monsterverse wasn&#39;t on the verge of any Titan-related catastrophes when the movie started. Ghidorah&#39;s attack was induced by the eco-terrorists - not unstable Hollow Earth rifts. What this implies is that Monarch either resolves the issue or it dies down on its own before 2019. Presumably, this is a loose end for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 to wrap up.




Another Monsterverse development Monarch: Legacy of Monsters may be able to make use of in season 2 is Monarch&#39;s discovery of 17 Titans. The number of known Titans was noted in King of the Monsters, but ignored in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. It&#39;s possible that Monarch is aware of some of them in 2015, but there&#39;s no evidence they know about as many as 17 at this point. What transpires in season 2 can account for this by having Monarch find traces of more Titans, leading them to have records of 17 by 2019. The gamma radiation spikes may even play a role in Monarch uncovering more, which would make a lot of sense if that&#39;s how they were found.



 What The Monsterverse Timeline Reveals About Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Season 2 
          

In addition to season 1&#39;s ending, what&#39;s known about the Monsterverse timeline helps create a framework for what season 2 can and can&#39;t do. It was established in King of the Monsters that Godzilla and the Titans disappeared from the public eye, which explains why season 1&#39;s monster battle and Godzilla&#39;s emergence in Algeria happened away from civilization. This allowed the Monsterverse series to use Godzilla without breaking canon. It stands to reason that Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 will have to abide by the same rules and avoid any public Titan appearances, or at least until after Godzilla&#39;s fight with Ghidorah comes to pass in 2019.




As for what&#39;s next for Kong and Skull Island, it&#39;s no secret that both have bleak futures in the short term. In 2024 (the timeframe of Godzilla vs. Kong), Kong lost his home to the worsening storm around the island. This won&#39;t happen for some time, of course, and his cameo in the finale indicates that Monarch has yet to build a protective dome around him. That said, the sad fate of Skull Island is less than a decade away in the timeline.

Since it&#39;s not something to happen suddenly, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if it was addressed at length in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2&#39;s 2017 storyline, at least in some form. Since the storm will eventually make the island uninhabitable, the show may set up the island&#39;s eventual downfall by touching on its deteriorating condition. The finale itself reinforces that notion by having a storm raging in the background while Kong makes his grand entrance. Judging by the scene, the storm has already taken over Skull Island; it just hasn&#39;t ruined the ecosystem yet.






All 10 episodes of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 are available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.
