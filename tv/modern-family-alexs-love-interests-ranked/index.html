  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Alex Dunphy&rsquo;s love life is often overshadowed by her sister Haley&rsquo;s, but she had her fair share of boyfriends throughout the series.
Some of Alex&rsquo;s relationships were short-lived and didn&rsquo;t work out, like James who turned out to be a thief, while others like Michael and Teddy were better off as friends.
Arvin Fennerman was the perfect match for Alex, with their shared professional interests and understanding of past relationship troubles. They ended up dating and had a promising future together.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>It may seem like Haley is the one with the tumultuous love life on Modern Family, but Alex Dunphy has had her share of romantic ups and downs too.</p>
<p>For 11 seasons, Modern Family fans saw the children of the Dunphy family grow into adults, and with their coming-of-age came some relationships, including Alex Dunphy&rsquo;s boyfriends. Funnily enough, the series focused so much on Haley&rsquo;s (Sarah Hyland) roller coaster of a love life that fans completely forgot about all the boys Alex (Ariel Winter) had her eyes on (and vice versa). Alex spent the first few seasons of the series focusing on school and judging Haley&rsquo;s relationship mishaps, but she did have a few of her own.
Watch on Peacock
Alex Dunphy was known for her smarts and sarcasm more than her relationships. She kept the Dunphys on track during their silly moments and focused on being the best student she could be, so she could move on from the nest. However, her love life shouldn&rsquo;t be discounted. Alex dated plenty of men, but it wasn&rsquo;t until later seasons that she set time aside from school and work to focus on her love life. From her mom&rsquo;s intern to her brother&rsquo;s friends to a brilliant astrophysicist, Alex&rsquo;s boyfriends had promise.</p>
<p>20 Shows To Watch If You Love Modern Family
Modern Family isn&rsquo;t the only brilliant sitcom about family dynamics and hilarious moments - check out these other offerings.</p>
<p>11  James The Wallet Thief
Played by Dominic Sherwood</p>
<p>In the episode &ldquo;Crazy Train,&rdquo; the whole family takes a train to DeDe&rsquo;s wedding. Throughout the episode, everyone makes comments about trains making them annoyed, which Alex finally understands after meeting James, with whom she completely let her guard down. That turned out to be a bad idea since James was Alex&rsquo;s worst love interest.
James sat next to Alex in first class and tried to stay there with her but got ushered back to coach. Alex joined him, and the two had a great time. When James suddenly disappeared, fans thought he was a Modern Family character who left too soon until Alex realized that James had stolen her wallet. He was cute, and Alex might have had a fun time with him, but Alex deserved someone who wouldn&rsquo;t steal from her.
Dominic Sherwood was Sarah Hyland&rsquo;s (who plays Haley Dunphy) real-life boyfriend when he appeared on Modern Family.</p>
<p>10  Michael The Friend
Played by Joe Metcalfe</p>
<p>The first meaningful Alex Dunphy boyfriend in the series was Michael. Alex was thrilled to finally have a boyfriend in season 3 because it meant she had a date to prom. Claire and Phil were excited that their little girl was not only going to the prom but that she had a date since, at that point in the series, Alex was more devoted to her school than she was to her social life. They wanted her to experience everything she could as a teenager.
When Michael appeared at the Dunphy residence, Phil and Claire got an instant feeling that she and Michael were strictly friends and nothing else. And while Michael tried showing affection to Alex, these two didn&rsquo;t have chemistry. He was sweet and treated her well, but they were better off as friends.</p>
<p>9  Alec The &ldquo;Fake&rdquo; Boyfriend
Played by Luke Benward</p>
<p>Fans only met Alec briefly, but he seemed to have a real hold on Alex’s heart. It’s not clear where the two met, but she was dating him in secret until she eventually told her parents. It&rsquo;s not clear how compatible the two were since the audience only really gets Alex&rsquo;s perspective of their relationship when she tries to talk about him.
Sadly, Claire and Haley didn’t believe that Alec was real and ignored Alex every time she spoke about him. They thought she was making it up to fit in with Haley Dunphy and her many love interests. But as it turns out, Alec was real. Unfortunately for Alex, he broke up with her because his family was moving to Africa.</p>
<p>10 Best Modern Family Episodes, Ranked
ABC&rsquo;s Modern Family is one of the funniest American sitcoms in recent memory. Across its eleven seasons, these are some of the show&rsquo;s best episodes.</p>
<p>8  Teddy The Bad Boy
Played by Carlito Olivero</p>
<p>In Modern Family, Alex&rsquo;s boyfriends don&rsquo;t fall into the bad boy category as often as Haley&rsquo;s do. She did have a few bad boys interested in her though. Right after Alex and Alec broke up, she found out the person who was leaving flowers on her porch was a guy named Teddy, not Alec, who she originally thought it was.
Unlike Alex’s other boyfriends, Teddy seemed like a bad boy. He drove a motorcycle and worked at the cemetery where he stole flowers and an American flag as a gift for her. It’s obvious she was smitten by Teddy, but he certainly wasn&rsquo;t endgame. The two didn&rsquo;t make sense, considering Alex always judged Haley&rsquo;s interest in bad boys.</p>
<p>7  Jimmy Scrivano
Played by Matthew Gumley</p>
<p>When the Modern Family characters took a vacation to Wyoming, the adults were out on horseback, but Alex was too busy being &ldquo;romanced&rdquo; by a boy named Jimmy. The two met while she was reading by the pool and he was unintentionally splashing her. As she told him off, he couldn’t help but flirt with her, which she found surprising. Alex wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested in Jimmy, but more in the idea of a boy liking her.
What was more surprising was when he kissed her. She wasn’t expecting it and, quite frankly, didn’t seem interested. Nothing happened between these two after Wyoming, but it was exciting to see Alex let her hair down for once. Jimmy wouldn&rsquo;t rank among Alex Dunphy&rsquo;s serious boyfriends as they were 13 at the time of the story, and Alex hadn&rsquo;t become interested in dating anyone yet. He did, however, open her eyes to the fact that other people could be interested in her.</p>
<p>6  Ben, Claire&rsquo;s Assistant
Played by Joe Mande</p>
<p>At the start, Ben seemed like the perfect fit for Alex. He was older, he had a career, he already knew how Claire Dunphy could be a bully, and he was a homebody. The problem with Ben is that, after a while, Alex grew tired of him. He got a little too comfortable and didn’t excite her anymore. Not to mention that Claire despised the idea of her assistant dating her daughter.
Alex eventually broke up with Ben, but it was for the best. While breaking up with him, she realized that he cheated on her with his ex-girlfriend. But before that reveal, he seemed like a good fit for her and the Dunphy clan.</p>
<p>5  Reuben Rand
Played by Spenser McNeil</p>
<p>Both Haley and Alex Dunphy have boyfriends in Modern Family who are not the same age as them. While both of them date older men as the series progresses, Alex also dates this younger man at one point, though the relationship is brief. Reuben was friends with Manny and Luke, and a little too theatrical for her liking.
However, there was an undeniable connection between the two. He’s the one person whom Alex pushed away but couldn&rsquo;t seem to keep at bay. No matter how rude she was to Reuben, he always came back and won her over. Reuben was also incredibly bright and well-read. If she hadn’t let the age gap or his “dorkiness” get in the way, these two could have been a good match a few years down the line instead of while he was still in high school.</p>
<p>Modern Family: Alex&rsquo;s 6 Best (&amp; 5 Worst) Story Arcs
On Modern Family, Alex Dunphy blossomed from the nerdy middle child into a successful career woman. But her character development had some bumps.</p>
<p>4  Sanjay Patel
Played by Suraj Partha</p>
<p>Was Sanjay Patel Alex Dunphy&rsquo;s ideal boyfriend? He was as smart as she was, went to an incredible school, and pushed her to better herself. The two of them started as major competitors but ended up falling for each other. But being the level-headed thinkers they are, the couple formally decided to call off their relationship before going to college.
Alex and Sanjay knew that long-distance couples rarely worked throughout the separation, and they weren&rsquo;t wrong. When they decided to try long-distance after all, Sanjay cheated on Alex and broke her heart, making him one of the most hated Modern Family supporting characters. If these two met later in life when distance wouldn&rsquo;t come between them, they might have been a great match.</p>
<p>3  Jason Darling
Played by Caleb Hoffman</p>
<p>Alex met Jason while the two were touring Caltech together. They instantly connected and were semi-competitive when answering questions in their tour group. Fans know how awkward Alex can be when she tries to flirt with men, but Jason was just as bad. They were both so nervous that they lied to one another initially, coming clean during the school visit. These two kids seemed to have a shot at something special if they both attended Caltech at the same time.
Sadly, after this episode, fans never heard more about Jason. He and Alex became Facebook friends, and she was hoping to connect with him if they both went to Caltech but that never happened. Was Jason the Alex Dunphy boyfriend that got away? If these two didn&rsquo;t connect at school, did that mean he went elsewhere? Fans will never know, but these two could have been something special.</p>
<p>2  Bill The Firefighter
Played by Jimmy Tatro</p>
<p>Bill was a firefighter who rescued Alex after her dorm room fire. The two began dating despite their differences and seemed good together. They were a Modern Family couple fans stood behind. However, unlike Arvin, her crush at the time, Bill wasn’t as “smart” for Alex, or the men that Alex usually fell for. Bill was the average guy with a heart of gold who would have been a great member of the family. He balanced well with Alex and stood up for himself when she poked holes in his personality.
The two complemented one another very well, since Bill helped Alex embrace her more emotional side instead of her intellectual side, and Alex learned to accept that Bill wasn&rsquo;t a genius. Sadly, these two called it quits over a misunderstanding. When Bill found out that Alex accidentally sent compromising photos to a colleague instead of Bill because of some phone number confusion, Bill blamed Alex instead of comforting her. It was an abrupt end to their relationship and demonstrated that Bill might not have been as understanding as originally thought.</p>
<p>1  Arvin Fennerman
Played by Chris Geere</p>
<p>The age difference between Alex and Arvin might have initially put some Modern Family fans off, but Arvin was really Alex&rsquo;s perfect man. He started out as her professor whom she had a crush on, but that crush was diminished when he started dating Haley. Alex tried to move on from her feelings by seeing Bill, but that didn&rsquo;t work out. When Haley realized she still loved Dylan more than Arvin, she cheated on him, and they broke up as well.
Alex made a move on Arvin when the timing was right, and she was no longer his student, and it paid off. By the end of the series, the two began dating and were getting ready for a work trip abroad together. They worked in the same field, understood what it was like to be cheated on, and found a way to balance their professional and personal lives. If there&rsquo;s one guy fans could wish for Alex, it would have been Arvin. The two deserve a Modern Family spin-off of their new life.
