## Literature Review

Young Sheldon season 7&#39;s trailer strongly suggests that it will fix a controversial crime against The Big Bang Theory&#39;s version of Sheldon Cooper. 




The Young Sheldon season 7 trailer suggests that it will finally fix its most controversial The Big Bang Theory Sheldon crime. With just a month to go before Sheldon wraps up his time in Medford, Texas, CBS is starting to ramp up the marketing campaign for the series. Not that it is in dire need of attention, considering Young Sheldon&#39;s continued popularity, especially in light of its arrival on Netflix, but promoting the prequel is a great way to get more people interested while also keeping fans excited for what&#39;s to come.




Given its prequel nature, certain events are expected to be tackled in Young Sheldon season 7. The Big Bang Theory has established several key elements during this time in Sheldon&#39;s life, including George&#39;s death and his move to Pasadena. Aside from those, however, lingering plot lines need to be addressed to ensure a satisfying send-off to the Coopers. While spoilers have been kept tightly under wraps, marketing materials for the final season of the spinoff are teasing an emotional journey&#39;s end for the beloved clan, but there seems to be a shift in its storytelling.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Fixes Its Oldest Big Bang Theory Plot Hole   Young Sheldon season 7 is finally fixing its oldest The Big Bang theory plot, but it is at the expense of the prequel spinoff&#39;s storytelling.

As The Big Bang Theory&#39;s prequel, the initial idea for Young Sheldon was to expand on what was already known about Sheldon&#39;s childhood in Texas. The first few seasons of the series stayed true to this idea, with the focus primarily on the boy genius and his adventures. In the last couple of years, however, Young Sheldon gradually transitioned to become more of a family series, meaning there&#39;s increased attention given to the rest of the family. By season 6, this transformation has been completed, as evidenced by the variety of storylines offered.

For what it&#39;s worth, the change seemed to be a welcome one. Young Sheldon season 6 posted series-high ratings, proving that the viewers are responding to more diversified storytelling for The Big Bang Theory prequel. That being said, not everyone is thrilled with this change, especially since Young Sheldon has been struggling with giving Sheldon a compelling plot. At this point, the rest of the family&#39;s respective arcs are more interesting than his despite being its titular character. This is particularly controversial for those who have loved Sheldon since The Big Bang Theory.






 Young Sheldon Season 7 Trailer Hints That It Will Bring The Focus Back On Sheldon

Ahead of its premiere, a new Young Sheldon season 7 trailer looks back at Sheldon&#39;s arc throughout the last six seasons of the series. It leans on nostalgia as the character grew from a small boy to a pre-teen who is now about to finish college at 14 years old. By seasons 5 and 6, however, other members of the family become the focal point of the video — visually representing the shift to an ensemble comedy. While the majority of the clip is composed of old scenes, it also features new ones, which noticeably only centers on Sheldon.

This is an indication that Young Sheldon season 7 will bring Sheldon back to the forefront of its storytelling. Despite being a prequel, this effectively functions as the completion of his personal arc on the small screen, considering that the majority of his adult life in Pasadena, California was already tackled in The Big Bang Theory. While the rest of the family will still be key players in its farewell year, it seems like the writers will make sure that Sheldon gets the attention he deserves in his limited time left in Texas.




                  Young Sheldon’s New Spinoff Makes A 16-Year The Big Bang Theory Trend Worse   George and Mandy&#39;s in-development Young Sheldon spinoff will worsen a disappointing trend that The Big Bang Theory started 16 years ago.

For years, Young Sheldon created countless plot inconsistencies between itself and The Big Bang Theory. When it started to break away from its parent show and develop its own stories, there was an expectation that CBS would formally separate the shows, allowing the prequel to continue beyond the established canon. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case. Instead, the creatives behind Young Sheldon insist that it still shares the same universe as The Big Bang Theory. Because of this, it should stick with its original idea for Young Sheldon and make up for sidelining Sheldon before it bows out.




In addition to that, CBS can continue the remaining Coopers&#39; story via Georgie and Mandy&#39;s Young Sheldon spinoff, which is set to premiere during the 2024-2025 TV season. Meanwhile, since Sheldon will already be in Pasaedena by that point, the prequel&#39;s final season needs to properly transition him from his life in Medford to his early days in California. That way, it can re-establish its storytelling ties with The Big Bang Theory.

              Young Sheldon  A spinoff of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon follows the youth and coming-of-age of Sheldon Cooper during his childhood in Texas as he pursues science and academia. The show also follows his parents, siblings, and Mee-Maw, painting a picture of the world where Sheldon grew up.
