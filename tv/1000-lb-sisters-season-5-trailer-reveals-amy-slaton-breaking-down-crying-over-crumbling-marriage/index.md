## Literature Review
Amy Slaton from 1000-Lb Sisters is at her “breaking point” after welcoming two sons, Gage and Glenn, with her unsupportive husband, Michael Halterman.




The 1000-Lb Sisters season 5 trailer shows Amy Slaton’s marriage on the verge of ending. The 36-year-old Dixon resident has known her husband, Michael Halterman, from a young age. The two first met in high school and remained a couple for over a decade. In March 2019, they finally took their relationship to the next level and tied the knot in Nashville. Amy and Michael welcomed their first child, Gage, in 2020 and their second baby, Glenn, in 2022. They seemed happy together as of last year.




Recently, TLC dropped the 1000-Lb Sisters season 5 trailer, which shows things have significantly changed for Amy and Michael. The preview clip shows Amy pouring her heart out, claiming she’s “very overwhelmed and stressed out” because her husband, Michael, isn’t helping her with tasks.


 

The reality star mentions that every part of her life is “chaotic,” as the camera cuts to a dramatic fight. Amy’s sister, Amanda, tells Michael to return her debit card, but he denies the request. The refusal leads Amanda to get into Michael’s face, as Amy demands that Michael “get out” of her house.

Amy isn’t the only cast member facing a marital issue during 1000-Lb Sisters season 5. The trailer also shows Amy’s sister, Tammy Slaton, worrying about her husband, Caleb Willingham. In the clip, Tammy is able to leave rehab after losing 300 pounds. She says, “I can’t imagine walking out of this place without my husband.” Caleb states that the doctors haven’t approved him to go home yet, which makes Tammy cry. The newlywed woman says she wants to conquer the world but also shows concern that her husband is &#34;backsliding.&#34; She says, “I don’t know if he has the strength to do this on his own.”

The TLC reality show has been entertaining viewers since 2020. However, 1000-Lb Sisters season 5 seems like the most dramatic one yet. The Slaton sisters are facing some of their biggest challenges this year that aren’t related to their weight. The ladies are working on their health and dealing with personal problems that may forever change their future. Amy may have to get a divorce from Michael, considering his disrespectful behavior and lack of support. Similarly, Tammy may have to choose between living her new free life or going back to support her beau, Caleb.




Amy’s situation is gut-wrenching and painful to watch. The mom of two has had a positive outlook on her future and lost weight to live a normal life. She has given Michael everything she could, including two babies. Despite that, her husband hasn’t reciprocated as well as he could. He hasn’t been a decent partner to her or cared to share her pain. Amy’s statements in the 1000-Lb Sisters season 5 trailer show that she may be unable to find an easy solution to her problems and might have to take a drastic step, like a separation or divorce.



1000-Lb Sisters season 5 premieres December 12 at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
