## Literature Review
With Bridgerton coming back in 2024, the series needs to feature some of the characters who appeared in the spinoff show about Queen Charlotte.




Bridgerton is back for a third season this year, and there are plenty of new characters from the spinoff show Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story that need to appear in the main series. As the story of Bridgerton season 3 will focus on Penelope and Colin, having supporting characters from Queen Charlotte could help with plotlines. Both shows focus heavily on flashback sequences, meaning characters that were introduced in the prequel spinoff series could be easily brought back. 
Covering the early days of the title character&#39;s reign, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story takes place nearly 60 years before the main Bridgerton timeline. The cast of Queen Charlotteincluded both new and familiar faces as it focused on how Charlotte became the witty, powerful monarch she was. From Princess Augusta to the Danbury children, there are plenty of characters from Queen Charlotte that need to have their storyline completed or expanded on in Bridgerton season 3.
            

 Bridgerton Season 3’s New Images Reveal First Look At Anthony &amp; Kate’s Married Life, Francesca Replacement &amp; More Colin &amp; Penelope 
New images for Bridgerton season 3 reveal more of Colin and Penelope and a first look at Kate and Anthony&#39;s married life and Francesca&#39;s replacement.




 9  Brimsely 
Portrayed by Sam Clemmett and Hugh Sachs in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story


As Queen Charlotte&#39;s right-hand man, Brimsley has had an interesting storyline dating back to her first years as a newly wedded queen. Brimsley is never far away from the queen and picks up plenty of gossip from the ton as she hosts audiences. Since he is always seen at the queen&#39;s side, Brimsley&#39;s background in the Bridgerton universe has plenty of room for expansion. His story in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story brings attention to the fact that he is gay and in love with the king&#39;s secretary, Reynolds.
Since being gay was considered immoral during the period in which Bridgerton takes place, Brimsley and Reynolds conducted their love affair in secret. Bridgerton season 3 could expand on the love affair between the two men and see what happened between them after Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.It could also see Brimsley finding a new lover or reminiscing about what happened in the past.
Both Bridgerton and Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story are available to stream on Netflix. 




 8  Reynolds 
Portrayed by Freddie Dennis in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story
        

Reynolds played an important part in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story as Brimsley&#39;s lover and the king&#39;s secretary. He was revealed to be gay and having a passionate affair with Brimsley, Queen Charlotte&#39;s right-hand man. Despite being a major character in the prequel, there is no mention of him in Bridgerton. According to actor Hugh Sachs, Reynolds&#39;s fate was explained in a deleted scene as an older Brimsley meets him again after years of being apart. This scene could be included in Bridgerton season 3 and could help wrap up the romance storyline between Brimsley and Reynolds.



 7  Coral 
Portrayed by Peyvand Sadeghian in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story
        

While Queen Charlotte has Brimsley to help, Lady Danbury has Coral. As a lady-in-waiting during Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, Coral was on hand to help with anything that Agatha might need, and the two were close. While Coral has not appeared in Bridgerton yet, the character&#39;s return could help show how far Lady Danbury has come over the years. Coral is a funny character with a little-known background and has strangely not even been mentioned by Lady Danbury. While Coral might have left, it would be good to see how she&#39;s doing.
            

 All 8 Queen Charlotte Characters Missing From Bridgerton &amp; Where They Went 
Queen Charlotte has plenty of crossover with Bridgerton, but there are several characters who go missing. Here is who doesn&#39;t appear in both series.




 6  Lord Ledger 
Portrayed by Keir Charles in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story
        

Violet&#39;s father, Lord Ledger, greatly influenced her life and doted on her. His homemade party hats were well-loved and appreciated by the people who received them. Bridgerton season 3 could expand on Lord Ledger&#39;s love for his family and the aftermath of his affair with Lady Danbury. Since he has not been shown in Bridgerton yet, the assumption is that he died off-screen sometime before the events of the main show. Since Bridgerton is famous for incorporating flashback sequences, this could be used to explore Lord Ledger&#39;s relationship with his daughter and wife or the relationships with his grandchildren, if he ever met them.





 5  Lady Vivian Ledger 
Portrayed by Katie Brayben in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story 
        

Violet&#39;s mother, Lady Vivian Ledger, was one of the ton who reluctantly accepted Charlotte as the new queen in the Bridgerton spinoff. A stickler for perfection, she was dismayed to hear that the Black members of the community would be socializing with the rest of the ton, and she was very hard on her daughter to be a proper young lady. While it&#39;s possible she passed away before the events of Bridgerton season 1, it would be interesting to see what she thinks about her daughter&#39;s marriage. Since it was never revealed if Vivian found out about her husband&#39;s affair, this could be another point brought up in season 3.
            

 Bridgerton&#39;s 10 Romances, Ranked From Worst To Best 
While Bridgerton&#39;s romances are what made the Netflix hit famous, not every couple can be as beloved as Simon and Daphne or George and Charlotte.




 4  The Danbury Children 
Portrayed by Isaiah Ajiboye and others in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story 
        

Agatha&#39;s children are very rarely mentioned or seen in the Bridgerton universe. Since Dominic Danbury only appears in a brief role, seeing the rest of the Danbury children in season 3 would make sense to better understand Agatha&#39;s personality and feelings toward her children. Since Dominic is now Lord Danbury, audiences could see him again in either this upcoming season or later on as he adjusts to being the now-grown-up head of the household. Given that one of Agatha&#39;s grandchildren marries Hyacinth Bridgerton in a later plotline, bringing her children back and revealing what has become of their lives would be very interesting.
            

 Bridgerton: Lady Danbury Could Be Hiding The Show&#39;s Biggest Scandal 
Little is known about Lady Danbury’s life before Bridgerton, but her secret past may reveal more family ties and make her an official Bridgerton. 



 3  Lord Danbury 
Portrayed by Cyril Nri in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story 
        

Even though Lord Danbury has been long dead by the time Bridgerton season 3 rolls around, bringing him back in a flashback or even a mention could help explain his relationship with his wife and family. While Agatha did not think fondly of her husband while he was alive, Bridgerton season 3 could introduce how she met him or what their life was like before Queen Charlotte. Lord Danbury may not be a well-liked character, but it is partially thanks to him that Agatha was able to assert her independence after his death and become the strong-willed character that audiences know and love.





 2  Princess Augusta 
Portrayed by Michelle Fairley in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story
        

As Queen Charlotte&#39;s mother-in-law and the authority on all palace matters, Princess Augusta ruled in her son&#39;s stead, due to his mental health challenges. Since the real Princess Augusta died in 1772, it is assumed that she has been long dead in Bridgerton, but her influence should continue to affect the queen to the present day. Whether by the use of flashback sequences or by mention, Princess Augusta&#39;s huge impact on both her daughter-in-law and her son could be explored in season 3.





 1  Adolphus 
Portrayed by Tunji Kasim in Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story




As the queen&#39;s brother, Adolphus made sure to do everything to keep Charlotte in line before her marriage contract to bind her to King George. He falls in love with Agatha Danbury and ends up going home heartbroken after she rejects his marriage proposal. Bridgerton season 3 could show how Adolphus has been since that time, as well as cover his relationship with his sister Charlotte over the years. Bridgerton could also expand on Adolphus and Charlotte&#39;s childhoods before she met the king and show what their relationship was like when they were growing up.
