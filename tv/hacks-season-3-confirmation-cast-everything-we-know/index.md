## Literature Review
After many delays, the HBO series Hacks is returning for its third season, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the award winner. 




Hacks season 2 had a bittersweet ending that offered closure, but the hit HBO series is returning for a third season. Comprised of a wide cast of comedic actors and real stand-up comedians, Hacks tells the stories of performers, executives, and other workers in the cutthroat entertainment industry. Noted for its biting wit and industry satire, Hacks also found its heart throughout its first two seasons on the air.




Hacks season 2 was just as well-received as the first, which received six Emmy nominations and three wins – most notably the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress, awarded to Jean Smart for her lead role as the legendary Deborah Vance. Hacks season 3 will be working with an almost clean slate – a new beginning for each of the main cast members of Hacks. Although much has changed in the comedy scenes of both Las Vegas and LA, Hacks season 3 will likely continue exploring different facets of the industry from the perspectives of both Deborah and Ava.

 Hacks Season 3 Latest News 
          

After much delay, the latest news for the popular HBO series is a positive update as Hacks season 3 officially establishes a release window. While it isn&#39;t a hard date yet, it was announced on Instagram that the show will be coming back sometime in spring 2024. This is big news because the series was renewed for season 3 shortly after the conclusion of season 2 in 2022, but was constantly delayed due to cast health issues and the Hollywood strikes.





 



 Hacks Season 3 Production Status 
          

Hacks season 3 hasn&#39;t established a firm release date yet, but it has been confirmed that the long-awaited show will return in spring 2024. This comes after the production was delayed for numerous reasons, not the least of which was star Jean Smart&#39;s heart procedure in February 2023. Of course, Hacks joined most of the rest of Hollywood when it shut down due to the industry strikes. Fortunately, since the resolution of the strikes, the show is back on track and debuting sooner rather than later.



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.









 Hacks Season 3 Cast: Who Can Return? 
          

The true-story-inspired narrative of Hacks wouldn&#39;t be possible without Deborah and Ava, played respectively by Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder, both of whom are returning for season 3. A host of other main cast members are expected back, and Hacks season 3 is bound to cast more real stand-up comedians in various new roles. 

Though no other cast members have been officially confirmed, the rest of the season 3 cast will likely include:

 Hacks Season 3 Story 


 
Though an official story has not been revealed yet, it isn&#39;t hard to speculate about the basic plot of the upcoming season of Hacks. After being fired by Deborah, Ava will finally be faced with the life she&#39;s always wanted but might struggle without the comedian&#39;s presence. Additionally, Deborah will be riding high from her successful stand-up routine, and will most likely encounter all the positives and negatives of her regained fame. Regardless, Hacks season 3 could take the award-winning series in an entirely new direction and make the show all the better for it. 

               Hacks   Summary:   Debuting with two episodes on Thursday, May 13, Max Original Hacks explores a dark mentorship that forms between Deborah Vance (Jean Smart), a legendary Las Vegas comedian, and an entitled, outcast 25-year-old (Hannah Einbinder).
