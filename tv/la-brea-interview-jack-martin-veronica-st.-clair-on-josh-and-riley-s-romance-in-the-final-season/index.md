Returning to NBC on Tuesday, January 9, La Brea season 3 will be the show&#39;s last. The final season will consist of six episodes and see the 10,000 B.C. survivors face their biggest challenge to date. After several sinkholes open in the sky, the group finds themselves at the mercy of whatever arrives in the Clearing. Given the number of plotlines that need to be wrapped up before La Brea comes to a close, dinosaurs are only one of many problems to overcome.

 Jack Martin &amp; Veronica St. Clair Talk La Brea Season 3 
         




Screen Rant: With this being the last season, I&#39;d love to hear from both of you how this experience has been overall and how you feel about bringing your characters&#39; journeys to a close.


Veronica St. Clair: This has been such a gift. This was the first time that both Jack and I got to be series regulars and actors every day for three years, so it has been such a wonderful journey. I have learned so much as an actor and as a person being on this show. It has been so fun getting to be on a high-production sci-fi show like this one. Every time we got a script, we&#39;d be calling each other being like, &#34;Did you see what happens on page 15? That is crazy!&#34; It&#39;s been so fun. Coming into season 3, I&#39;m excited that we&#39;re doing dinosaurs finally. I&#39;m excited for everyone to finally get to see it. It&#39;s been an absolute joy.
Jack Martin: Pretty much the same for me. This whole show meant so much to me. I was in college for political science, and then a few months later, I had my first pilot audition for the show, and then I booked it, and then I was out in Australia for three years shooting it. It took up a lot of space in my life and always will. I got to chase saber-toothed tigers in a jeep in the outback and live with a bunch of other actors and have 10,000 wraps on set of a huge production show. It was crazy. I still kind of can&#39;t believe it&#39;s over. It&#39;s just an amazing experience that I&#39;ll always be grateful for.





I have to say that one of my favorite parts of the show is actually the romance between your characters. Josh and Riley are such a sweet and heartful aspect of the series. How was building this rapport with each other over the last three years?


Veronica St. Clair: The best. I cannot even describe to you how many times after a day of shooting I would text Jack and be like, &#34;It could have only been you. I&#39;m so grateful it&#39;s you.&#34; It really has been the time of my life getting to know Jack better as a person and as an actor and also having him as a scene partner. We had the most laughs on set, I think, out of anybody. I&#39;m claiming that now.
We laughed so much shooting this show. We had a really great time. Some of those days shooting the show it was very rainy and very cold and Jack brought the sunshine every day. It has been truly a joy, and I&#39;m so grateful that so much of our experience on the show was Riley and Josh and their relationship growing together.
Jack Martin: I couldn&#39;t put it better. That was beautiful. I couldn&#39;t agree more. We had the absolute best time working together. I&#39;m glad that reflected for someone. We had so much fun just hanging out as people, but also, we really enjoy working together as actors. I think we have a similar approach to it that worked really nicely. Something that&#39;s sort of fun is our characters have this love story, and I think we&#39;re the only one that&#39;s not a love triangle or has some sort of wedge or thing that goes horribly wrong.
I don&#39;t know how much I can say about this, but I think, originally, there was going to be one, but we didn&#39;t do it. I&#39;m happy about that and that we were able to be this heart and this wholesome thing in the midst of it all. I don&#39;t know if it was always going to be that way, but I feel like we turned it into that.





          

Veronica, at the end of season 2, Riley found out that her parents were about to get a divorce before she and her father fell into the sinkhole. How is this knowledge going to impact her in season 3?


Veronica St. Clair: That was a bombshell. When I read that in the script, I was like, &#34;That is the worst possible thing to find out.&#34; We are fighting so hard to get back to a reality where everything is whole and back to where it was and my family is together, and it turns out that, even if we were able to get back to 2021, my family won&#39;t even be together. That&#39;s truly awful. That&#39;s an awful thing. Honestly, I can&#39;t really say that much about what happens this season.
There are six episodes only that we&#39;re trying to tell a lot of story in, and so you&#39;re just going to have to tune in and find out to see how much that affects the season and our characters within the season. What I will say is that Riley&#39;s relationship with her dad has grown so much across these three seasons. By season 3, there is just such love between the two of them and such an understanding between the two of them that wasn&#39;t there before. Riley is so grateful to have the trust of her father and the protection of her father and love from her father, and you see that a lot in this season.





On the note of separation, Jack, the Harris family is going through it. They are being separated again with Eve in an unknown location and time period. How might that affect him emotionally, considering that this is not the first time this has happened?


Jack Martin: Yeah, he&#39;s over it. He&#39;s sick of it. His family&#39;s always getting split up. Just when he thinks he has them all together, they&#39;re separate again. I mean, it sucks. He loves his mom a lot, and he loves his dad, too. There&#39;s literally that one moment at the end of season 2, right after Gavin comes back to life, that they end up hanging out again. It&#39;s just a constant rug being pulled out from under him. His family is everything to him. It&#39;s tough, and it&#39;s also going to be his main motivation—getting everybody back together.
