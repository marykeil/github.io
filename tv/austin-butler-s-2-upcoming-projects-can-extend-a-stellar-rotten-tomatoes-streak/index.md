## Literature Review
Austin Butler is a star on the rise, but the actorâ€™s next two projects releasing in 2024 can continue a notable Rotten Tomatoes streak.




Austin Butler is still riding high on his award-winning role from 2022, but his next two projects set for 2024 could continue an impressive Rotten Tomatoes streak. The American actor officially got his start in the industry in 2005, starring as Zippy Brewster in Ned&#39;s Declassified School Survival Guide. For the next five years, Butler acquired roles primarily on Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel, including a main role in Zoey 101 season 4. As the years went on, Butler continued to appear in more substantial parts, with his TV breakout coming in The Carrie Diaries before starring as Wil Ohmsford in the short-lived The Shannara Chronicles.




Despite his ongoing success with TV roles, Butler&#39;s biggest claim to fame would come through his movie career. After appearing in smaller releases, 2019 became a game-changer for Butler as he appeared in Jim Jarmusch&#39;s The Dead Don&#39;t Die and Quentin Tarantino&#39;s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. From there, Butler was cast in the highly coveted titular role in 2022&#39;s Elvis, based on the singer&#39;s career alongside manager Colonel Tom Parker. While Butler&#39;s accent as Elvis Presley got a lot of attention, his performance won an Academy Award. It also continued Butler&#39;s incredible streak that will likely continue through 2024.

  2:03                       Upcoming Austin Butler &amp; Tom Hardy Movie Is The Sons Of Anarchy Prequel We&#39;ve Wanted For 9 Years   Although the Sons of Anarchy prequel series never happened, an upcoming movie starring Austin Butler and Tom Hardy can easily fill that void.    


 Masters Of The Air &amp; Dune: Part Two Can Continue Austin Butler&#39;s Great Rotten Tomatoes Streak 
          




Masters of the Air and Dune: Part Two can continue Butler&#39;s stellar Rotten Tomatoes streak that began with 2019&#39;s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which received a &#34;Fresh&#34; 85%. Elvis was a bit lower, getting 77%, but the 94% audience score was the highest for any Butler project. Before the focus is switched to major 2024 releases, another one of Butler&#39;s releases is worth mentioning: The Bikeriders. Though it currently has an 86% critics rating due to festival screenings, the movie focused on a &#39;60s motorcycle club isn&#39;t being theatrically released until June 2024, so it could very well add to the streak.

Based on what&#39;s known about the Masters of the Air&#39;s true story and Dune: Part Two, both projects have the potential to score high Rotten Tomatoes ratings. Masters of the Air, in particular, is the next companion series following Band of Brothers and The Pacific, two critically acclaimed and award-winning series. The stakes might be a little higher for Dune: Part Two since it&#39;s based on more extensive IP, but the first movie in the current series received 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, with signs pointing that the Dune sequel will be even better than the 2021 entry.






 How Austin Butler&#39;s Next Roles Could Become Bigger Than Elvis 
          

In Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&#39;s case, Butler had a pivotal role, but it was smaller than names such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, and Brad Pitt. Granted, Butler had leading roles in Elvis and The Bikeriders, proving he&#39;s a vital reason for the current Rotten Tomatoes streak. Based on the quality of Band of Brothers and The Pacific, it makes sense to assume that Butler&#39;s portrayal as Gale Cleven in Masters of the Air will be in awards discussions, or at least a factor in the show&#39;s reception. There&#39;s even a possibility that Butler&#39;s role as Benny in The Bikeriders sneaks into award discussions after its wider 2024 release.

Butler is playing Dune: Part Two&#39;s villainous Feyd-Rautha, who had already caught attention in the Dune sequel&#39;s trailers. Though the role might not get any award-worthy debates, the immense popularity surrounding the Dune franchise could mean Feyd-Rautha emerges as Butler&#39;s biggest role to date. Award nominations and wins are highly-regarded accolades, but success in something like Dune or more notoriety from Masters of the Air could lead to even bigger things for Austin Butler as his career goes on.
