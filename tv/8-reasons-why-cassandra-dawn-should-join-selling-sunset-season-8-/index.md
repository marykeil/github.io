# 8 Reasons Why Cassandra Dawn Should Join Selling Sunset Season 8 


## SUMMARY 


 Cassandra Dawn could potentially join Selling Sunset season 8, fitting the vibe of the series as a dynamic woman. However, not everyone at The Oppenheim Group would be thrilled with her arrival. 
 Cassandra already has drama with Bre and their feud could be a captivating storyline for the show. On the other hand, she has formed a close friendship with Chelsea, making them a potential dynamic duo. 
 Cassandra&#39;s background in contemporary art as an advisor and agent gives her a great client rolodex and attention to detail, making her a valuable addition to the Oppenheim Group. She isn&#39;t afraid to go toe-to-toe with those who dislike her and the Oppenheim brothers seem open to hiring her.

## Literature Review
Cassandra Dawn was introduced on Selling Sunset season 7 and may join the Oppenheim Group. Will she now be part of the Selling Sunet season 8 cast?




Cassandra Dawn was introduced during Selling Sunset season 7, and there are many reasons why she will join season 8. The Netflix reality series is known for introducing a new cast member every season, for the most part. Last season, Bre Tiesi was brought onto The Oppenheim Group team and was met with open arms by some and others with hesitation. Emma Hernan joined the show, she immediately grew close to Chrishell Stause and even some of the other women. However, Chelsea Lazkani had a tougher time getting to know the women as she became close with known villain Christine Quinn.
While Selling Sunset season 8 has yet to be confirmed, if the show does come back for another season, viewers will likely see Cassandra again on their screens. Selling Sunset is great at casting and finding dynamic women to add to the reality series. Cassandra falls under that type of person Selling Sunset is looking for, so she would definitely fit the vibe of the series. However, Cassandra may step on a few toes if she does join The Oppenheim Group team. It seems not everyone in the brokerage would be too thrilled if Cassandra was officially working for the company.

 8  Cassandra Already Has Beef With A Selling Sunset Cast Member 
Bre Doesn&#39;t Like Cassandra


 







One of the most important aspects of a reality star is they need to be able to bring or at least get involved in drama. If Cassandra joins Selling Sunset season 8, she will already have drama going into the season with Bre. The pair did not get along during Selling Sunset season 7, as Bre didn&#39;t get great vibes from Cassandra. Although Cassandra claims they knew each other during their bottle service days in their 20s, Bre had no idea who Cassandra was. Cassandra rubbed Bre the wrong way and clearly has no interest in being friends or acquaintances. The Cassandra vs Bre feud could be a captivating storyline.





 7  Cassandra Has Become   With A Selling Sunset Cast Member 
Cassandra Is   With Chelsea


 







After Cassandra was introduced in Selling Sunset season 7, she immediately became friends with Chelsea. The two hit it off during the Oppenheim Los Angeles offices&#39; group Cabo trip to check out their new office there. Chelsea gravitated towards Cassandra as she is also pretty new to the group and knows what it&#39;s like to be the newbie at the Oppenheim Group. If they keep up this friendship, Chelsea and Cassandra could be the next dynamic duo on Selling Sunset.





 6  She Has A Great Client Rolodex &amp; Interesting Career Background 
Cassandra Worked As An Art Advisor


While Cassandra never revealed who her clients were, her job before becoming a relator meant she had a number of clients she could easily sell luxury real estate to. Cassandra has been working as a contemporary art advisor since 2010, according to Revel Real Estate, and became an agent for them in August 2022. Her career background in contemporary art will not only help her bring top-tier clients to Selling Sunset but will also help in her real estate career. Art requires a lot of attention to detail, so Cassandra will thrive at the Oppenheim Group.





 5  Cassandra Doesn&#39;t Seem Afraid Of The Women Who Dislike Her

Cassandra got the vibe right away that Bre was not into being friends with her. When the pair met on-screen in Cabo, there was palpable tension between Cassandra and Bre. Cassandra was seemingly trying to be friendly with Bre, but Bre wasn&#39;t having it. Cassandra then called Bre out for her bad &#34;attitude,&#34; but Bre didn&#39;t really care what Cassandra thought of her, and vice versa. Clearly, Cassandra isn&#39;t afraid to go toe-to-toe with Bre if she needs to. While none of the other women showed a dislike for Cassandra, Bre is friends with several women in the office who will take her side over Cassandra&#39;s.

 4  The Oppenheim Brothers Like Cassandra 
Jason Is Considering Hiring Cassandra
        

When Chelsea recommended Cassandra to join the brokerage, Jason Oppenheim was open to the idea. Cassandra has everything the Oppenheim brothers look for in a good realtor, so there really isn&#39;t a reason for them not to hire her. However, Jason did say in one of his Selling Sunset season 7 confessionals that he is worried Cassandra and Bre&#39;s feud could hurt the dynamics of the office. This could affect her possible employment, but the brothers also know they are filming a reality show, so they could hire her because she makes great TV.





 3  Other Cast Members Might Leave, Making Room For Cassandra 
Rumors Are Swirling That Bre &amp; Chrishell May Leave Selling Sunset
        

After Bre&#39;s conversation with Jason about the commission split, there&#39;s a good chance this could be the last viewers see from Bre on Selling Sunset. The Oppenheim Group changed their commission split from 90/10 to 80/20, which Bre was so furious about that she left the conversation unsure about her feature at the brokerage. Even Chrishell may leave the group due to her ongoing feud with Nicole Young and wanting to prioritize her relationship with her partner, G-Flip, over real estate. If both Bre and Chrishell leave, this could leave a huge gap in the cast that Cassandra could fill.





 2  Cassandra Has A Large Instagram Following 
Cassandra Has 248K Followers On Instagram


Cassandra has over 248,000 followers and counting on Instagram. Not only will her appearance on Selling Sunset help her follower count grow, but if she were to be a cast member on the show and promote it, she would bring more eyes to the series. Her large social media following could help the Selling Sunset series grow to new heights.

Even though Cassandra may have already started her real estate career with another company, a spot on Selling Sunset could still help her career. The show has helped several of the agents reach new heights in their real estate careers and even outside of them. Chrishell was able to go on Dancing With the Stars while Christine wrote a book. The possibilities for Cassandra at The Oppenheim Group are endless.
Selling Sunset season 7 is now streaming on Netflix.
