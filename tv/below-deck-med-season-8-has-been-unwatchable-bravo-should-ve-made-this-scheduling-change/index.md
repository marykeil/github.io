## Literature Review

Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 fails to entertain viewers and is finally ending, despite featuring a few dramatic moments and shocking fights.




Below Deck is a great reality franchise, but Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 has been underwhelming, according to fans. The reality TV show has always been dramatic, and it was no different this year. Below Deck Med season 8 has featured some controversial cast members and surprising twists. Among the most scandalous moments was the time when Kyle Viljoen drove his friend Natalya Scudder to the edge. His toxic behavior turned her off so much that she left midway through the season. While Max Salvador shocked the crew with his antics, Luka Brunton proved himself to be a terrible bosun. Even Captain Sandy Yawn failed to control the drama on her yacht.




Viewers did watch the Below Deck spin-off as usual. However, they were underwhelmed by Below Deck Med season 8 and felt it wasn’t close to being as good as previous seasons. Recently, fans discussed the upcoming Below Deck Med season 8 finale on Reddit and shared their honest opinions. A Redditor commented (via Teanailpolish), “I feel like this season lasted an eternity,” thanking God that the season concluded.


 

Another Redditor wrote, “Looking forward to something (hopefully) better starting,” adding that they were happy that Below Deck Med season 8 was over. Someone even compared it to the spin-off Below Deck Sailing Yacht. The fan wrote, “I would rather watch season 1 of Sailing Yacht twice,” stating that Below Deck Med season 8 was disappointing.

 Why Fans Don&#39;t Like Below Deck Med Season 8 
          

Fans shared many reasons Below Deck Med season 8 was unwatchable. However, the top reason appeared to be the length. The spin-off lasted 16 episodes and dragged many storylines for far too long. As a result, it seemed too repetitive and got boring quickly. Somebody had a great idea for a real change that could have saved the season. The Redditor shared that Bravo should’ve “done the double-episode plays for this one,” like they did for Below Deck Down Under. The fan added, “The Down Under season went by way too fast and was 1000000000x better.” A few people disliked the crew this season except Lara Du Preez and Max.




Fans are spot on about the flaws of Below Deck Med season 8. The show started in September 2023 and ran until the end of January 2024. It aired on Bravo for nearly four months and dragged out many storylines. The issues between chief stew Tumi Mhlongo and Natalya started in the second episode. However, their rivalry didn’t end until episode 9, when Natalya finally quit Below Deck Med. The problems with Luka underperforming as bosun continued throughout the season, and Kyle’s drama never really stopped. Captain Sandy also didn’t take strong measures to shake things up, making Below Deck Med season 8 boring.

Bravo could’ve saved Below Deck Med season 8 by altering its release schedule. However, the fix may not have been so simple. The latest season of the popular Below Deck spin-off was inherently flawed. It didn’t offer much because the casting for the show wasn’t good. Bravo needed to have better casting and hire newer crew members for the spin-off. Cast members like Kyle, Natalya, and Tumi shouldn’t have been on Captain Sandy’s yacht during this charter season. The boat needed better workers with quirky personalities. Below Deck Med season 8 could’ve also used more demanding charter guests so that the new twists and turns in every episode would be more entertaining.




Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
