Summary

  The shocking For All Mankind season 4 finale shows that nobody is spared, adding danger and tension to the show, says actor Krys Marshall.   Dani&#39;s near-death experience brings the people of Happy Valley together, uniting them after a season of inequality and rivalry.   Dani&#39;s survival in the season 4 finale sets up potential storylines for her character in season 5.  







For All Mankind&#39;s shocking season 4 finale is explained by actor Krys Marshall. Heading into the now completed fourth installment of the alternate history Apple TV&#43; sci-fi drama, For All Mankind had already done away with several prominent characters. That adds an element of danger to the show. It added to the sense that Marshall&#39;s character, Danielle Poole, might actually die when she was shot during an effort to break up a brawl.

In an interview with The A.V. Club, Marshall addresses the shocking turn of events in the For All Mankind season 4 finale. The actor, who has been with the show since season 1, said that she appreciated that “nobody is spared.” She listed some of the characters that have died previously, although Dani ultimately survives. Marshall also talked about what it would have been like if Dani had been killed by the gunshot since she and the showrunner considered that possibility. Read Marshall&#39;s quote below:


One of the things I love about For All Mankind is nobody is spared. As we saw in season two, Tracy (Sarah Jones) and Gordo Stevens (Michael Dorman) bite the bullet. It happens in the season-three finale with Karen (Shantel VanSanten) and Molly (Sonya Walger). So we know that at any given time, any of us can be killed. There was a lot of back and forth if Dani would make it through season four. Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi, our showrunners who also wrote episode 10, and I had a long discussion about what the world would look like if Dani died from her bullet wound. They wrote a version of the script where she dies.
Ultimately, they didn’t go ahead with it. I don’t know if it’s because they personally couldn’t do it or because they have plans for her in season five. But they decided against it. For me, I could see a world where either was a beautiful ending. We tragically lose Danielle, and it’s the kind of gut punch we’re used to with FAM. But I also love that we didn’t go in that direction. We end season four on a relatively more thoughtful, hopeful note. We’ve seen Dani enter [the show] as this twenty-something young woman in an all-male program, a Black woman in an all-white program. She enters that astronaut candidate room in season one shy and anxious. She can hardly speak her name. Now we see her in season four, and she’s an accomplished commander, a mother, and a grandmother. Something is rewarding and healing in watching those final moments of her in the finale, reuniting with her family, and it feels like all is right in the world. But again, it could’ve gone either way.






 The Significance Of Danielle&#39;s Near Death In For All Mankind Season 4 Finale, Explained 
          

Danielle is shot in the chest during the chaos of the brawl. She then falls into the arms of Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman), a friend and rival. But the possibility of her death ends up being the ground that brings Happy Valley together, and it goes even deeper than that. The gun that was used to shoot her was last seen in the For All Mankind&#39;s season 3 finale. It belonged to Lee Jung-Gil (C.S. Lee), who used it to defend himself against Dani and Grigori Kuznetsov (Lev Gorn).

The gun resurfaced, inadvertently leading to Danielle&#39;s brush with death. A security officer discovered the gun and tried to use it, misguidedly, in an attempt to control the riot, and Danielle paid the price. But in the end, the outcome brings the people of Happy Valley together. After a season of inequality and rivalry, Danielle&#39;s critical gunshot wound puts everyone on the same side.

Another time jump takes the story to 2012, with Danielle alive and well and reunited with her family on Earth. With the show&#39;s team hopeful about a For All Mankind season 5 renewal, it&#39;ll be interesting to see what becomes of that unified front and what the next chapter might be for Danielle. The show is also not afraid to write characters off, even if the farewell isn&#39;t fatal.



For All Mankind is available to stream on Apple TV&#43;.
