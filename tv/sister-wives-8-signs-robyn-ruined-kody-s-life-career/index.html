  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Robyn&rsquo;s manipulations have had a negative impact on Kody&rsquo;s relationships, mental health, and career.
Robyn&rsquo;s passive-aggressive behavior and petty complaints show a lack of respect for Kody.
Robyn&rsquo;s control over Kody and the Brown family dynamic has led to the unraveling of their plural marriage. There could also be potential financial consequences.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives star Robyn Brown is the catalyst for disaster. She&rsquo;s brought so much turmoil to Kody&rsquo;s life. She may ruin the show they both appear on.</p>
<p>Sister Wives star Robyn Brown&rsquo;s all about crying jags and passive-aggressive power moves, and her endless manipulations are destroying Kody Brown&rsquo;s peace of mind and career. While he thinks Robyn&rsquo;s the perfect woman, he may be wrong. This is a female who&rsquo;s made him sink to the lowest depths over and over again. Robyn&rsquo;s pushed him to avoid his own kids while lavishing attention on her and their children. Of course, Robyn keeps her hands clean. She will never own up to openly trying to hurt other people.
Sister Wives season 18 shows some cracks in Robyn and Kody&rsquo;s marriage. While they&rsquo;re still a united front (mostly, anyway), Robyn&rsquo;s letting some of her anger seep out. Since she&rsquo;s not into overt confrontation, she vents by making sometimes-petty complaints about Kody. For example, she said that his crêpes didn&rsquo;t look or taste good. Sure, that wasn&rsquo;t so serious, but in its own way, it showed more disrespect than is typical for Robyn, who prefers backstabbing or &ldquo;influencing&rdquo; others to just putting them down while the cameras roll.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  Robyn Brown Changed Kody Brown&rsquo;s Personality
Robyn Brown Doesn&rsquo;t See Her Own Role In Things</p>
<p>Robyn has a distinct personality. She&rsquo;s not a particularly bold woman, but Robyn gets her way without being too direct. Since she&rsquo;s been with Kody for years, Robyn&rsquo;s ways may be rubbing off on her man. He fought with Janelle Brown openly during season 18, but he doesn&rsquo;t get into too many extreme confrontations with his non-Robyn wives. In fact, Robyn showed him how to get a rise out of people without saying mean things. He learned the art and science of passive-aggression from his mate.
The issue is that Kody&rsquo;s turning into Robyn. He&rsquo;s getting moody, just like Sobbin&rsquo; Robyn. He&rsquo;s in his feelings, which makes him grumpy, irrational and annoying. Years of infighting in the Brown family has led to emotional wounds that may never heal, and Kody&rsquo;s become a difficult person. Why were those wounds inflicted in the first place? For her sake - it was all for Robyn. Without Robyn in the mix, the Brown family might still be carving pumpkins together, sledding, and generally functioning as a cohesive unit. Instead, there&rsquo;s chaos.
Basically, Robyn&rsquo;s complaining about a monster that she created. She taught Kody that their relationship comes first. It&rsquo;s the only thing he seems to care about. Offscreen, a trio of wives fled - Kody, hardened by years of fighting for Robyn at everyone else&rsquo;s expense, blamed the women who left.
Of course that wasn&rsquo;t fair, but Robyn warped his mind. The spouses who ran for the hills were making logical choices. They weren&rsquo;t getting any love from Kody so they bailed out. That was his fault. Ultimately, Kody let Robyn control him and that changed his life. He seems unhappy now, so maybe these changes weren&rsquo;t really to his benefit.
Offscreen, three wives have flown the coop. Kody&rsquo;s bitter over their departures, and Christine Brown&rsquo;s exit changed his personality, according to Robyn. However, Christine would probably never have left if Kody hadn&rsquo;t provoked her. How did he do that? By favoring Robyn. He broke the large family&rsquo;s unspoken rules by giving all of his love and attention to one wife. If every fight the family had is a domino, and the dominos are arranged in a long line, then favoring Robyn was the first domino. When tipped over, it triggered a chain reaction that led to a complete meltdown.
Robyn is someone who has a strong effect on others while displaying a meek and mild persona that&rsquo;s possibly a sham. Underneath, Robyn&rsquo;s a very strong person. Yes, she bursts into tears, but under those hair-trigger types of emotional responses, she&rsquo;s as cool as a computer. Since Robyn engineered the exit of the other wives, one careful step at a time, it&rsquo;s safe to say that she shouldn&rsquo;t be complaining about Kody&rsquo;s post-divorce demeanor.</p>
<p>7  Robyn Brown Cut Kody Off From His Older Sons, Including Paedon Brown
Does Robyn Brown Need To Apologize?</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s relationships with his older children have never been worse, and Robyn played a role in the disintegration. As the family tried to gather for Christmas, toxic dynamics made planning a typical holiday experience challenging. There was a text chain where Kody&rsquo;s older sons sounded off, and Robyn, who was initially a part of the drama, eventually bailed out. However, she didn&rsquo;t stop there. Her next step was to manipulate Kody into avoiding his older sons at Christmas.
Yes, she talked Kody out of seeing his older sons during that special occasion. That&rsquo;s so cold-blooded. Kody needs to stand up for himself and try to establish stronger bonds with his kids. While things are bad with Paedon (he&rsquo;s criticized Kody publicly and isn&rsquo;t speaking to him right now), a parent should never just throw in the towel with their child. They should do everything they can to keep the lines of communication open. Kody bears the responsibility for avoiding his older sons during the holiday. Robyn thought they&rsquo;d cause too much drama.
Maybe that holiday wouldn&rsquo;t have been so bad. Possibly, Kody and his older kids could have made up, or at least made things a bit better. People fight and then resolve their problems. Arguments are sometimes healthy. What&rsquo;s really toxic is silence - both sides get bitter and paranoid. No one really shares their feelings. Well, they don&rsquo;t share them with the people who need to hear about them.</p>
<p>6  Robyn Brown Made Kody Brown A Laughingstock
Kody Brown Has Gotten Some Shade</p>
<p>When Kody started appearing in Sister Wives, he was taken more seriously. He was someone who was trying to normalize polygamy. His mission was to make it seem like a viable option for families. Now that his plural marriage has imploded onscreen, he probably feels like he has a target on his back.
Kody is mocked. In season 18, when he isn&rsquo;t raging, he&rsquo;s like a sad clown. He&rsquo;s become a joke and Robyn got him there. It&rsquo;s not that she actually emasculated him. She&rsquo;s too dainty and traditionally &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; for that. Instead, she encouraged choices that were sketchy at best, while denying all responsibility for what happened. Robyn pushed him to feud with others and ice out Meri, Janelle and Christine.
In terms of how he became a laughingstock, it all leads back to Robyn. He preferred her and began to antagonize his other wives. By turning a plural marriage into a farce, he became the leading man. Instead of slapstick and one-liners, Kody told his unloved spouses to embrace their misery. For example, he and a &ldquo;bro&rdquo; chatted about the concept of &ldquo;sacred loneliness,&rdquo; which is all about women suffering silently during their unfulfilling spiritual unions. While Kody feigned sympathy, he&rsquo;s a dyed-in-the-wool sexist. Under the surface, he&rsquo;s all for sacred loneliness. No one hates hearing women complain more than Kody.</p>
<p>5  Robyn Brown Befriended Meri Brown
Meri Brown Was Kody&rsquo;s Least Favorite Spouse</p>
<p>When Robyn got &ldquo;thisclose&rdquo; to Meri, it seemed so contrived. Robyn&rsquo;s known for hurting and humiliating the other wives (in oblique yet creative ways), so it was hard to believe that Meri would give Robyn that kind of trust. She did though, and maybe she shouldn&rsquo;t have. Meri would confide in Robyn, but Robyn secretly wanted monogamy. Obviously, under the surface, they were at odds as Meri was trying to stay in the marriage. So, Meri spilled all her secrets to Robyn, who probably shared every private confidence with Kody. Robyn is that kind of person and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s hard to believe in her essential goodness.
Why would Robyn try to be friends when she really wanted Kody all to herself? It&rsquo;s not hard to figure out why. Like some kind of double agent, Robyn was gathering intel that she could use as leverage. While the other wives wouldn&rsquo;t befriend Robyn (Christine, who has a good head on her shoulders, never trusted her), Meri felt that Robyn could help her to get along with Kody. She even took Robyn with her when she wanted to tell Kody about her plans to move. Meri really doesn&rsquo;t understand Kody&rsquo;s favorite wife.
This impacts Kody because it made the process of disengaging from Meri even more complex. She wasn&rsquo;t just his wife in a spiritual union - she was the &ldquo;bestie&rdquo; of his only legal wife, Sister Wives&rsquo; Robyn Brown. So, when Meri revealed her plans to move, they all sat down together, forming a bizarre love triangle for the ages. It was a weird setup as Kody was basically trying not to laugh at Meri - he clearly has no respect for her. He was making faces and Robyn was trying not to laugh. Would a nice woman do that to her &ldquo;friend&rdquo;?
Robyn shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten so close to Meri. She doesn&rsquo;t love her as a friend. Robyn wanted all the other wives gone and she accomplished her goal. By getting so cozy with Meri, Robyn just intensified Kody&rsquo;s problems.</p>
<p>4  Robyn Brown Lives Like A Wealthy Woman
Does Kody Brown Go Into Debt For Her?</p>
<p>Kody and Robyn have a fancy house - it&rsquo;s got tons of space and all the amenities, including a wine fridge and gourmet kitchen. Sure, they&rsquo;re straitlaced Mormons, but maybe they&rsquo;ve stocked that fridge with vino and enjoyed some furtive sips in the privacy of their own home? Regardless, although Robyn has said that she doesn&rsquo;t need upscale accommodations, it&rsquo;s possible that she sings a different tune when the Sister Wives cameras aren&rsquo;t rolling. The truth is that she lives in what&rsquo;s basically a palace, especially when it&rsquo;s compared with Janelle&rsquo;s bare-bones rental apartment in season 18.
Also, Gwendlyn Brown, Kody&rsquo;s daughter, accused him of spending wildly. However, she might not have considered the fact that he was doing it to please Robyn. Since almost everything else he does is centered around pleasing his true love, why would this be any different? Kody may squander cash on Robyn to give her the life of her dreams, but that could negatively impact his finances down the line. If the overspending gossip is true, Kody may be in debt because he wants to give Robyn the best of everything.</p>
<p>3  Robyn Brown Seemed To Run My Sisterwife&rsquo;s  t Into The Ground
Did Robyn Destroy Kody Brown&rsquo;s Online Business?</p>
<p>Robyn wanted to take over My Sisterwife&rsquo;s  t. That&rsquo;s the online business the family ran. Browns sold jewelry and other merchandise. While Robyn did put some energy into revamping the brand with her own jewelry designs, she soon seemed to lose enthusiasm for the project. Maybe sales were down, but something made her change. Before too long, the My Sisterwife&rsquo;s  t website shut down. Perhaps that was Kody&rsquo;s decision, but it may have been the result of Robyn&rsquo;s management.
Possibly, Robyn wanted to outshine the other wives by taking over the business. However, she may not have realized how many long hours of hard work are needed to make a company thrive. There are endless details that need to be considered. When these things aren&rsquo;t a priority, quality can slip. Robyn wasn&rsquo;t a seasoned entrepreneur before, so basically, she got the job because she&rsquo;s Kody&rsquo;s wife. That&rsquo;s fine, but she didn&rsquo;t show a lot of commitment to it.
Now, the company doesn&rsquo;t have the best reputation. It&rsquo;s commonly viewed as a failure. A cloud of mystery surrounds the company, as the family hasn&rsquo;t revealed a lot of details about why the business is inactive. There are questions about My Sisterwife&rsquo;s  t that never get answered. Meanwhile, Kody may have lost whatever money he put into the business.</p>
<p>2  Robyn Brown&rsquo;s Not Even Happy With Kody
Kody Brown Gave Up So Much For Her</p>
<p>Robyn wanted monogamy, but is she really in love with Kody? Lately, she seems to be as restless and &ldquo;over it&rdquo; as his exes were before they left him. While she might have gotten a momentary thrill from being the last wife standing, the kind of elation is wearing off. Kody&rsquo;s hard to live with. He&rsquo;s not a big-time polygamist anymore. Kody&rsquo;s now a typical man with one wife. This loss of status may hurt more than his ego, which is remarkably fragile. It may also hurt his pocketbook.</p>
<p>1  Robyn Brown&rsquo;s Manipulations May End Sister Wives
Will Robyn Brown Destroy The Show?</p>
<p>Robyn&rsquo;s secret obsession with monogamy may eventually end Sister Wives. The plot lines may not be quite so intriguing where there&rsquo;s only one real wife. Viewers want drama and three wives going their separate ways actually neutralizes a lot of that. The &ldquo;Kody and Robyn&rdquo; show would possibly be dull to the point of being unwatchable. How much drama can the two stir up on their own? Other wives are needed to create tension onscreen. In the clip above, as per TLC, Robyn accuses Kody of sabotaging their relationship - is it projection? It could be.
If Sister Wives dies, it will really hurt Kody financially. He often talks about money, so the fact that monogamy may not pay off for him is surely on his mind. If they find that they&rsquo;re earning less money, Kody may begin to turn on Robyn. If they divorce, it could be argued that she ruined his life.</p>
