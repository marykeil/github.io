## Literature Review

The Bachelor season 28 contestant Lea Cayanan came into the Bachelor Mansion with a mystery envelope that has her fellow contestants speculating.




The Bachelor season 28&#39;s Joey Graziadei already met one of his contestants, Lea Cayanan, during Charity Lawson&#39;s &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; episode, and she was given a mystery envelope that contained an advantage, which she was instructed not to open until premiere night. The Bachelor star Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro originally from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, who now resides in Koloa, Hawaii, was Charity&#39;s Bachelorette runner-up. Although he was heartbroken when she got engaged to Dotun Olubeko instead of him, he now has the chance to find love again as the star of The Bachelor season 28.




In an Instagram post, The Bachelor shared a clip from the premiere in which some of The Bachelor season 28 women begin to panic about the contents of Lea&#39;s mystery envelope.


 

Maria Georgas says in her confessional, &#34;I think it’s been really freaking all of us out because what if it puts her a couple steps ahead?&#34; Lea reassures the group of women that she was told that it&#39;s not a date card. In Sydney Gordon&#39;s confessional, she states, &#34;We’re all just like, what the heck is this thing? Is she going to be able to send somebody home? Is this like, a guaranteed rose? Like, what is this thing?&#34;

 Lea Cayanan&#39;s Mystery Envelope Explained 
          

During Charity&#39;s Bachelorette &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; episode, Lea had the opportunity to meet Joey, and she was given an envelope that she wasn&#39;t allowed to open until premiere night. Host Jesse Palmer told her that it wasn&#39;t a date card, but it would help her on her journey with Joey and would change everything. In the preview clip, Lea shares, &#34;Having the card is definitely driving me crazy. Everyone’s been speculating and guessing what it could be, and I’m just anxious to open it and see what it is. I’m really nervous. I definitely think it could be a little bit of a target on my back.&#34; In private, Lea opens the envelope and covers her head with her hands, saying, &#34;Oh my god.&#34;

Lea&#39;s envelope is certain to cause drama during The Bachelor season 28. It seems odd that, in a show about falling in love, Lea would be given an advantage that makes the show feel more like a reality competition series than a reality dating series. If the women are correct and Lea receives immunity from a guaranteed rose or a power that allows her to make a decision for Joey, then there&#39;s always the danger that Lea and Joey&#39;s relationship could feel forced. However, the producers seem to enjoy throwing these curveballs into the mix whenever they have the chance.




Hopefully, whatever the card in the envelope says will help Lea, rather than hurt her. She&#39;s right that any sort of advantage could put a target on her back. It&#39;s unfair that Lea already has so much pressure and stress on her. The other women could become jealous of her, which would be a bad thing for everyone. Whatever happens, hopefully, Lea will build an authentic connection with Joey, without the need for the envelope. Lea and Joey deserve to explore their connection naturally, without any interference from The Bachelor season 28 producers.

The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
