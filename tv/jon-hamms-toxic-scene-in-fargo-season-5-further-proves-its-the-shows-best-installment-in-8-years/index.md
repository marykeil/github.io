Fargo season 5 proves that it&#39;s the best installment of the show in eight years during Jon Hamm’s scene set to a cover of “Toxic” by Britney Spears. Since 2014, FX has released a TV continuation of the movie Fargo by the Coen Brothers. Each season is set in a different time period with unrelated characters and storylines. The thread connecting them is the location – the American Midwest – and the genre – black-humored crime drama.

While every season has been fun to watch, not every season has had the same level of success. Fargo seasons 3 and 4 struggled to maintain the same magic of the movie and first two seasons. They were narratively solid and had excellent acting, just like the first two seasons. Unfortunately, the overall product was simply lackluster. Luckily, season 5 has regained its footing, going over so well that there’s a good possibility that Fargo season 6 will happen.





 Fargo Season 5 Is The Show&#39;s Best Installment Since 2015&#39;s Season 2 
          

While Fargo seasons 3 and 4 were good, they weren’t as excellent as the originals or the newest installment. Fargo season 5 is entertaining and well-written. The season provides an empathetic portrayal of domestic violence while maintaining its over-the-top elements characteristic of the show. This balance between seriousness and dramatization has been hard to maintain in the more recent seasons of Fargo. What’s more, the two main characters both have subtle nuances that add layers to their personality and motivations.

At first glance, Sheriff Roy Tillman is an evil man, but a closer examination shows just how fragile his ego is. He embodies toxic masculinity when he transitions all his emotions into anger and aggression. Moreover, he projects his feelings of inadequacy onto Dot, making their relationship more contentious. On the other side, Dot is the perfect example of a strong heroine. There’s no doubt that she’s strong; however, her backstory of being Tillman’s child bride shows the level of resilience that drives her. She matches her level of vulnerability with a drive to survive. This level of character development and writing matches up with the oldest seasons of Fargo.






 Why Sheriff Tillman&#39;s &#34;Toxic&#34; Cover Song Scene In Fargo Was So Chilling 
          

During Fargo season 5, episode 8, “Blanket,” John Hamm’s “Toxic” sequence displays the brilliance of the newest season. Lasting two minutes and five seconds long, the scene feels unbearably long, building tension with each second. Jon Hamm’s facial expression slowly shifts, expressing Sheriff Roy Tillman’s progression from upset to anger. His eyes squint, his jaw tightens, and the corners of his mouth pull down.

About halfway through his walk, his eyebrows furrow while his shoulders swing and bounce with the increased momentum. He increases speed very slightly as the cover of Britney Spears’s “Toxic” builds speed, adds instruments, and gets to the chorus. Sheriff Tillman’s expression, combined with the song, foreshadows his actions towards both Dot and Danish Graves. He turns all his emotions into anger and takes it out through physical aggression. Frankly, if Graves hadn’t shown up, Dot probably would’ve been killed in this episode of Fargo instead of him because Tillman projects all his negative emotions onto his captive due to his position of power over her.
