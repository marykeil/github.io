## SUMMARY 



  Married at First Sight fans are criticizing cast member Clare for being disingenuous and using therapist rhetoric to push her own narratives on her husband.

## Literature Review
Married at First Sight season 17&#39;s Clare Kerr is being criticized by viewers for her therapist rhetoric which many feel makes her seem disingenuous.




Married at First Sight fans are not feeling the way cast member Clare Kerr comes off as disingenuous when speaking her therapist rhetoric. Clare, 27, is in the last stages of school before she becomes a full-fledged therapist. On the show, she has used her therapist-derived viewpoints, lenses, and delivery to push her narratives on her husband Cameron Fraser. Not only has Clare urged her new husband to see things from her perspective, but she has been overbearing about controlling situations in her favor. Clare was given what she asked for in Cameron, but she has been failing to find the romantic spark between them.




A Reddit thread was started by Lifesfailur3​, who​​​​​​ asked what Clare does for a living before stating, &#34;Is she a therapist? Idk she hasn’t mentioned it. God she’s insufferable.&#34; The comments section of the thread lit up with other Married at First Sight season 17 fans who were eager to expand on that notion.


 

One viewer jabbed, &#34;Mental health professional who most assuredly does not use her tools in her own relationship.&#34; Another person thought Clare was all lip service when they said, &#34;I hate the way she says the &#34;right&#34; thing but it&#39;s obvious she doesn&#39;t mean what she says.&#34; Yet another critic stated Clare is &#34;unaware of her own flaws.&#34; Many Married at First Sight fans are seeing the same negative traits in Clare, and her demeanor and choice of verbiage are not working well in her marriage. She is coming off as disingenuous by using her therapist rhetoric.

 Why Are Clare &amp; Cameron Having A Disconnect? 
         

Married at First Sight fans are feeling like Clare does not practice what she preaches and is inauthentic, leading many to question her skills as a therapist. Clare has shown viewers that she likes to act like she sees things from different perspectives, but she has been one-sided and judgmental in her marriage to Cameron. Cameron and Clare have being having a disconnect because they are finding they have different core values and can&#39;t seem to compromise. Their failure to understand one another and Clare&#39;s seemingly unappreciativeness of Cameron&#39;s efforts has been setting them up for failure.




Clare&#39;s faith is really important to her, and Cameron does not share the same weight in religion as Clare. Clare wants to raise her future children in the church while that is the last thing Cameron wants to do. Moreover, during the honeymoon, Clare did not reciprocate Cameron&#39;s romantic gestures and affectionate behavior, which only drove them further apart. Clare seems to be trying to say everything to make herself seem like she is not the problem, but fans think it&#39;s apparent that Married at First Sight season 17&#39;s Clare is the one causing issues.
