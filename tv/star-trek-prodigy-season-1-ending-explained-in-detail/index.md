## Literature Review

Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 ended with a noble sacrifice and hints about what&#39;s to come in season 2. We break down every big moment and what it means.




Warning: SPOILERS for Star Trek: Prodigy Season 1 Finale - &#34;Supernova, Part 2&#34;The Emmy award-winning Star Trek: Prodigy ended season 1 with a thrilling and emotional finale that paid off the season&#39;s major storylines while setting up an exciting season 2. Now streaming on Netflix, Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, episode 20, &#34;Supernova, Part 2&#34; resolves &#34;Supernova, Part 1&#39;s&#34; epic cliffhanger as the Living Construct weapon about the USS Protostar corrupted Starfleet, causing the Federation&#39;s starships to attack each other. Although Gwyn (Ella Purnell) was able to summon the Federation&#39;s allies to help Starfleet, it wasn&#39;t enough to prevent the armada&#39;s imminent destruction.




Star Trek: Prodigy season 1&#39;s finale concluded the Vau&#39;Nakat&#39;s revenge plot to destroy Starfleet and prevent First Contact with Solum from ever happening. Asencia (Jameela Jamil) AKA the Vindicator activated the Living Construct and killed Gwyn&#39;s father, the Diviner (John Noble), before escaping with Drednok (Jimmi Simpson). When the Protostar&#39;s young crew realized that Starfleet would just send more ships until the entire fleet becomes corrupted by the Living Construct, they realized the only way to stop the signal was to destabilize its Proto-Core and destroy their starship. To prevent the cataclysmic destruction of the solar system, Hologram Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) chose to stay behind to ensure the Protostar jumps into warp. Here&#39;s how every major Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 story wrapped as the heroic teens saved Starfleet and the galaxy.

                  Star Trek: Prodigyâ€™s Young Alien Heroes &amp; Starfleet Future Explained   Prodigy&#39;s brave young crew of the USS Protostar is made up of new and old Star Trek alien species, all of whom hope to one day join Starfleet.   





 Hologram Janeway&#39;s Sacrifice Means Admiral Janeway Becomes The Kids&#39; New Mentor 
Admiral Janeway believes in the Protostar&#39;s young crew.
         

Hologram Janeway originally believed that she could transfer her program to a data chip and escape the Protostar with Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray), Gwyn, and the others. To her dismay, Hologram Janeway&#39;s program had evolved to become too big to fit on a data chip. Instead, Janeway recorded a farewell message for her proteges and stayed behind as the Protostar jumped to Proto-Warp and destroyed itself, along with the heroic Hologram. But their plan worked: the Protostar&#39;s self-destruct while at warp meant the damage caused by the baby star in the Proto-Core was mitigated by being spread across space, which saved billions of lives. And the Living Construct&#39;s destruction saved Starfleet.

Hologram Janeway was the mentor to Dal, Gwyn, Rok-Tahk (Rylee Alazraqui), Zero (Angus Imrie), Jankom Pog (Jason Mantzoukas), and Murf (Dee Bradley Baker) who taught them the values of Starfleet in Star Trek: Prodigy season 1. The Hologram gave up her life to save the galaxy in true heroic Starfleet fashion, but the loss of Hologram Janeway also passes the torch to Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) as the kids&#39; new mentor. Dal and his friends no longer need the Protostar&#39;s training hologram as they now have the real, flesh-and-blood Janeway to look up to.






 Why Captain Chakotay Is Now In An Alternate Future Timeline 
Chakotay is trapped on Solum.
         

Ascenia and the Diviner&#39;s plan to destroy Starfleet was meant to prevent First Contact with Solum, which led to a civil war that decimated their world. Even though they didn&#39;t destroy Starfleet, the events of Star Trek: Prodigy season 1&#39;s finale still changed the future because the First Contact between Starfleet and Solum that&#39;s still to come will not happen now the way Ascenia remembers it. This means that Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran) is now stranded in the year 2436 of an alternate 25th-century future timeline.



Chakotay and the USS Protostar initially traveled through a wormhole and arrived in Solum, where the Vau&#39;Nakat took him and his crew prisoner.







However, Starfleet determined that the Protostar&#39;s destruction created an interspatial rift that duplicated the original temporal anomaly Chakotay and the USS Protostar fell into in 2383, which brought them to Solum 52 years into the future. Starfleet plans an expedition to that alternate future, and of course, Admiral Janeway will lead it because her original mission to the Delta Quadrant to find Chakotay remains unfinished. This is a clear and exciting setup for what should be the main storyline for Star Trek: Prodigy season 2.



 Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s Young Heroes Don&#39;t Get Into Starfleet Academy (But Get Something Better) 
The Protostar kids become Admiral Janeway&#39;s warrant officers.
          

Dal, Gwyn, and their friends dreamed of joining Starfleet throughout Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, and Admiral Janeway persuasively argued for their acceptance into Starfleet Academy to the Federation Council. However, they were not accepted into the Academy on the grounds that it would be unfair to the other applicants already in line. Yet the Protostar&#39;s former crew&#39;s heroism in saving every Starfleet ship must also be rewarded. Instead of joining the Academy, the kids were given the rank of Warrant Officers under the supervision of Admiral Janeway herself.




This turns out to be a better option for our young heroes because had they been accepted into Starfleet Academy, they would have to remain on Earth and attend classes. This means Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 would be set in San Francisco and prevent the Protostar&#39;s ex-crew from gallivanting around the galaxy on a starship. Dal&#39;s status as an Augment was also resolved as Admiral Janeway persuasively defended the purple teen as a living embodiment of the Federation&#39;s multi-species culture. Thankfully, Dal was given a special dispensation to become a Starfleet Warrant Officer despite the Federation&#39;s ban on Augments.



Dal R&#39;El was created by followers of Dr. Arik Soong from Star Trek: Enterprise, and his genetically engineered body is comprised of the DNA of over 2 dozen species, complete with their special abilities.






 Gwyn&#39;s Choice To Return To Solum And What It Means For Season 2 
Can Gwyndala save the Vau&#39;Nakat&#39;s homeworld?
         




Gwyndala made the heartbreaking choice not to join her friends in Starfleet, after all. Instead, she decided to travel to Solum, her homeworld she has never been to, in the hopes that she can be a voice that argues for Starfleet and prevent civil war when First Contact with the Vau&#39;Nakat happens. Gwyn is optimistic that her own experiences can be a harbinger of change for the Vau&#39;Nakat. Gwyn also hopes to meet the younger version of her father, the Diviner, who is still alive in the Prime timeline. Gwyn lost the father she knew, but the Diviner sacrificing himself to save her confirmed that he really did love his &#34;progeny.&#34;

Although Gwyn left her friends behind, she is, thankfully, still going to be part of Star Trek: Prodigy season 2, which will apparently follow Gwyn&#39;s journey to Solum to change the outcome of First Contact. Gwyn also promised Dal they&#39;d see each other again, and they shared a sweet kiss that paid off their budding relationship since Star Trek: Prodigy began. However, Dal won&#39;t meet an older Gwyn in the alternate future where Chakotay is because Gwyn isn&#39;t on Solum in that timeline. It remains to be seen how and when Gwyn will be reunited with her friends in Star Trek: Prodigy season 2. It&#39;s also possible Asencia will return in season 2 since she survived Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, and Admiral Janeway has a score to settle with her treasonous ex-Ensign as well.




                  Is That Tendi From Lower Decks In Star Trek: Prodigy?   Is an Orion science officer in Star Trek: Prodigy actually Tendi from Lower Decks? Prodigy&#39;s co-executive producer Aaron Waltke has the answer.    



 Admiral Janeway Has &#34;Something Bigger&#34; That Sets Up Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 
Janeway isn&#39;t flying another Protostar Class starship.
          

They may not be Starfleet Academy Cadets, but Dal, Rok-Tahk, Jankom Pog, Zero, and Murf were still deservedly welcomed by Starfleet as heroes as their individual character arcs were rewarded. Zero was given a new mechanical body to house his Medusan energy, Jankom showed Starfleet&#39;s engineers a trick or two, and Rok-Tahk met Starfleet scientist Lt. Commander MacDonald, played by Star Trek&#39;s Science Advisor Dr. Erin MacDonald, which officially makes her a canonical character. After everything the kids endured aboard the Protostar, it was a joy to see them as part of Starfleet as they begin to grasp their unlimited potential.




After the kids watched Gwyn&#39;s starship depart for Solum, Admiral Janeway unveiled a new Protostar Class starship, which means it&#39;s no longer an experimental NX-class ship. However, the heroic teens won&#39;t be crewing a new Protostar because Janeway has &#34;something bigger&#34; in mind instead. This likely means Star Trek: Prodigy officially leaves the Protostar behind in season 2, which makes sense since Dal and his friends leveled up and are no longer &#34;baby stars.&#34;



 What Comes Next In Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 
Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix in 2024
         

Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 promises to be even more epic than season 1, and will touch upon every other Star Trek in the franchise in some way. Already revealed about Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 is the arrival of The Doctor (Robert Picardo). Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s former Emergency Medical Hologram takes charge of Dal and his friends to become their new mentor at the request of Admiral Janeway. The young warrant officers will join Janeway on her expedition to save Captain Chakotay, and they will do it in style aboard the brand-new, Lamarr Class USS Voyager-A. Janeway&#39;s second coming of Voyager will need all of its advanced technology for its time travel mission.




For Dal, Zero, Rok-Tahk, Murf, Jankom Pog, and Gwyn, Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will immerse them into the greater world, and complications, of life in Starfleet. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will also feature callbacks and guest stars beyond Star Trek: Voyager, and time travel as an element of the next 20 episodes means Voyager-A could potentially visit different Star Trek eras as well. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2&#39;s finale will also wrap up the 40-episode saga of both seasons while leaving the door open for Star Trek: Prodigy season 3. Hopefully, the Netflix viewership will be sufficient to warrant season 3 and more.



Star Trek: Prodigy Season 1 is available to stream on Netflix. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix in 2024.
