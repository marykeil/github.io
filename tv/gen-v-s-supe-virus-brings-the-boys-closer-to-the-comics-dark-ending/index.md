## Literature Review
Gen V introduces a supe-killing virus, which not only shifts power dynamics in the show but also brings The Boys closer to the comic book&#39;s ending.




Gen V&#39;s supe virus might have brought The Boys&#39; overarching storyline much closer to the original comic book&#39;s ending. In its initial moments, Amazon&#39;s Gen V only drops a few references to its parent franchise while establishing itself as a standalone series. However, the closer it gets to its finale, the more it introduces narrative elements that will likely become major plot points in The Boys season 4. One of these narrative elements is the supe-killing virus that Cardosa formulates at Dean Shetty&#39;s request.




Although Dean Shetty and Cardosa die towards the end of Gen V season 1, leaving little to no evidence for its existence, the fact that Victoria Neuman acquires it suggests it will play a pivotal role in The Boys season 4&#39;s events. How Neuman intends to use the virus is yet to be seen. However, the virus&#39; mere existence in The Boys&#39; universe brings the franchise scarily closer to the comic book&#39;s conclusion.

 Gen V&#39;s Supe Virus Could Put A New Spin On The Boys Comics&#39; Ending

In the original The Boys comic book&#39;s ending, Billy Butcher commits supe genocide while his team turns against him because of his ruthless actions. Several initial developments in Billy Butcher&#39;s arc suggested that his narrative in the Amazon show would not emulate his comic book storyline. Despite hating supes in the series, like his comic book counterpart, Butcher does not avoid working with Starlight, Kimiko, and even Maeve. He even shows empathy towards Ryan, suggesting that he would never want all the supes to get wiped out. However, the introduction of the supe virus could put a new spin on his comic book ending.




Although most details surrounding the supe virus from Gen V are still shrouded in mystery, the spin-off series&#39; final arc confirms that Grace Mallory might have told Butcher about the virus after Dean Shetty revealed its secrets to her. Cardosa gives away the virus to Victoria Neuman in Gen V, but the show&#39;s mid-credits scene shows Billy Butcher investigating the underground tunnels of the Woods. This could mean that Butcher was likely down there to learn more about the virus and find traces of it. Although it remains to be seen how Butcher will get his hands on the virus, the virus could give him the power to commit a supe genocide like his comic book counterpart.

Following the events of The Boys season 3, Billy Butcher has a ticking clock over his head. With his death inching closer, it won&#39;t be long before he will get desperate and resort to extreme methods to take down the supes he hates. Therefore, if he acquires the virus, he might end up ignoring how it would affect innocents, choosing instead to use it as a weapon of mass destruction.






The Boys seasons 1-3 and Gen V season 1 are streaming on Prime Video.






 How Gen V&#39;s Supe Virus Could Break Up Billy Butcher&#39;s Team

After Gen V&#39;s events, the supe virus rests safely with Victoria Neuman, who will not use it carelessly because she and her daughter are also supes. However, the same cannot be expected from Billy Butcher. Despite hating supes, Butcher previously tried to become one just to be able to overpower Homelander. Owing to this, if he gets his hands on the virus, he might actively try to spread it without considering how it would kill supes like Starlight and Kimiko, who are on his side. If his final plan threatens Starlight and Kimiko, Frenchie and Hughie will be the first ones to go against him.





 

Even if Butcher does not actively spread the virus and only sits back and watches it destroy supes, his relationship with Frenchie, Hughie, and others on his team could reach a breaking point as it would highlight how his vendetta against supes has completely consumed him. Billy Butcher has always been susceptible to the corrupting influence of vengeance, and his inaction towards stopping the virus from killing the people on his team would prove that he is not so different from Homelander. Hence, the external destruction caused by the virus would fracture the internal dynamics between Butcher and his team as Hughie and others would no longer be able to trust him and his motives.



 The Boys Season 3&#39;s Ending Makes Billy Butcher&#39;s Comic Book Ending Even More Likely

Although Billy Butcher could not be the father figure Ryan needed, a part of him always empathized with the young supe. After The Boys season 3&#39;s ending, however, it seems likely that Butcher will gradually lose his affection for Ryan the more he follows in Homelander&#39;s footsteps. A scene from The Boys season 4&#39;s trailer also hints that Ryan will kill a civilian in broad daylight like his father. Once Butcher learns that Ryan has turned into a reflection of Homelander&#39;s dark tendencies, his relationship with him will take a conflicted turn, where he might even stop caring about his well-being. If that happens in The Boys season 4, no one will be able to stop Butcher from burning the world down before he self-destructs.

             The Boys The Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.
