There are plenty of fantastic live-action adaptations of anime TV shows to enjoy, from Future Diary: Another World to Netflix&#39;s One Piece.




For anime fans looking to explore the live-action adaptations of their favorite shows, there are plenty that have proven themselves worthy of watching. There are a number of fantastic live-action TV adaptations of anime out there to enjoy, but, as with any genre, some shows are better than others. What makes one adaptation better than another can vary for a number of reasons, including its quality and faithfulness to the source material. From intricate set designs to incredible performances, some are able to capture the spirit and charm of the anime with incredible accuracy.
Netflix is particularly notable for its live-action anime adaptations, with some like Death Note (2017) leaving fans rather disappointed, while others like One Piece thrilled audiences and even gained new followers who hadn&#39;t previously encountered the classic anime. Live-action has the unique capacity to reimagine characters and worlds in a way that appeals to a broader audience by bridging the gap between anime fans and newcomers. The best examples also offer an opportunity to experiment with different filmmaking and creative techniques that bring these stories to life in a fresher, newer, and more exciting way.









 








 10  Prison School (2015) 
The adaptation of the hit raunchy anime is full of the same lewdness and humor.
        

The live-action adaptation of Akira Hiramoto&#39;s manga and subsequent anime series Prison School is just as scandalous and shocking. The show follows five male students after they enroll in an all-girls boarding school. After the student council accuses them of peeping, they are locked away and have to plan their escape. The live-action show stays true to the original source material, being full of the same raunchy comedy, crudeness, and drama. The humor, much like the anime, is especially lewd and silly at times, making it unsuitable for younger audiences. It&#39;s a faithful adaptation, but it doesn&#39;t bring anything new to the series.
Prison School can be streamed on Amazon Prime Video and Crunchyroll. 






 9  The Prince of Tennis (2019) 
This live-action adaptation is set in China, rather than Japan.
        

The 2019 Netflix adaptation of The Prince of Tennis makes several changes and departures from the original manga and anime. The anime is set in Tokyo, Japan, focusing on Seishun Academy&#39;s tennis club. The live-action TV show, however, is set in China for a Chinese audience. This might upset some fans of the original show, which is considered by many to be one of the best sports animes of all time, as culturally, the show steers away from Japan. However, the gripping sports scenes and fun, fast-paced action are just as enjoyable to watch as they are in the anime. Fans of sports dramas will devour every episode of this live-action adaptation.
The Prince of Tennis can be streamed on Netflix. 






 8  Honey And Clover (2008) 
There&#39;s just as much romantic drama in this adaptation as in the anime.
        

The 2008 live-action television drama Honey and Clover follows Yuta Takemoto, an art college student in Tokyo, who falls for genius painter Hagumi Hanamoto. This charming coming-of-age story unfolds around the complex romantic relationships and campus life of young college students. The live-action adaptation follows quite close to the original storyline of the anime. Although the pacing of the show has been criticized by some viewers for being a bit slow, there&#39;s still plenty of melodramatic drama packed in to keep things moving. Fans of the classic love triangle dynamic will love this adaptation.





 7  Future Diary: Another World (2012) 
The live-action show has a different storyline from the manga and anime.
        

Future Diary: Another World is a live-action adaptation of the popular manga and anime series Future Diary. The story follows Arata Hoshino, a carefree college student, who inadvertently becomes a player in a deadly game after receiving a prototype smartphone from his friend. This phone, equipped with a Future Diary app, predicts the future and drags Arata into a battle royale against other diary holders. Compared to the anime, the live-action show takes a more realistic approach to the story by dialing back special effects and supernatural fight sequences. Despite this more grounded approach, the show still manages to stay true to the spirit of the original anime.
            
 
 This Upcoming Live-Action Adaptation Will Struggle To Adapt One Of The Best Anime Movies Ever Made 
An upcoming live-action adaptation is an incredibly exciting prospect but it will certainly struggle to adapt one of the best anime films ever made. 









 6  Erased (2017) 
A few changes make the Erased adaptation even more gripping.
        

Netflix&#39;s Erased is the 2017 live-action adaptation of the same-titled anime, itself based on Kei Sanbe&#39;s manga of the same name. The story follows Satoru Fujinuma, a manga artist who time travels to prevent a series of child murders. The show makes a few subtle changes from the anime, particularly with Satoru&#39;s character. It&#39;s difficult to translate certain anime elements into a live-action format, which is why the live-action version of the character is much softer and less abrasive. Additionally, the show does an excellent job of building suspense and mystery around its time-travel premise, making it a truly gripping watch.
Erased can be streamed on Netflix. 






 5  Death Note (2015) 
The 2015 Japanese miniseries Death Note stays faithful to the anime with a few character changes.
        

The 2015 Death Note drama series is considered to be one of the best Death Note live-action adaptations. While based on the manga, it introduces several changes to the narrative, such as characters like Light and L being adapted for realism. Light Yagami, portrayed by Masataka Kubota, is gentler and more compassionate, contrasting with his colder manga counterpart. L, portrayed by Kento Yamazaki, exhibits unique obsessive-compulsive behaviors, relying on liquid diets and exclusively wearing white clothing. While not perfect, it offers faithful storytelling and solid performances but differs from the original in its character portrayal.
            
 
 Netflix’s Best &amp; Worst Anime Adaptations Proved A Popular Live-Action Fan Belief Wrong 
Many beliefs and assumptions surrounding live-action anime still exist, but one was proven completely wrong by Netflix&#39;s best and worst adaptations.









 4  Ōoku – Tanjō: Arikoto And Iemitsu (2012) 
This 2012 adaptation features an award-winning performance.
        

Ōoku – Tanjō: Arikoto and Iemitsu is a historical drama series following a 2010 movie of the same name. Set in the Tokugawa era, during a disease outbreak affecting men, it explores Japan&#39;s social changes with fewer men. The story, based on Yoshinaga Fumi&#39;s ongoing manga, centers on two main characters: a monk and a female shogun. The show has some fantastic performances, including from actor Masato Sakai, who won a Galaxy Award for his performance. Engaging and fascinating, it&#39;s a must-watch for those interested in intricate storytelling without typical samurai action.





 3  Yu Yu Hakusho (2023) 
Yu Yu Hakusho is packed with exciting action sequences and impressive special effects.


 







 Yu Yu Hakusho (2023) 

 Release Date   December 14, 2023    Cast   Takumi Kitamura , Shuhei Uesugi , Jun Shison , Kanata Hongô    Genres   Action , Adventure , Comedy    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




The 2023 series Yu Yu Hakusho is Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of Yoshihiro Togashi&#39;s popular supernatural shonen manga of the same name. YuYu Hakusho follows the story of teenager Yusuke Urameshi, who becomes a spirit detective after dying and being revived. This live-action version excels in capturing the charm of the original manga, particularly in its action scenes and melodrama. It&#39;s a straightforward, faithful, albeit fast-paced adaptation of the original manga. Like the 1992 anime adaptation, the show is jam-packed with exciting action sequences and flashy effects. It&#39;s a must-watch for fans of anime.





 2  Alice In Borderland (2020) 
Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of Alice In Borderland is visually striking.


 







Alice in Borderland is adapted from Haro Aso&#39;s manga, following Arisu and Usagi as they navigate a mysterious, deadly game in a deserted city. Initially framed as a coming-of-age dramedy with an upbeat rock soundtrack, the series quickly shifts to a darker tone, presenting life-or-death challenges. Aso&#39;s manga was turned into an anime in 2014, and the live-action captures much of the show&#39;s thrilling action sequences and drama. The show&#39;s visual execution, from the desolate landscapes of Tokyo to the intricately designed game scenarios, is both faithful to the source material and incredibly visually striking.
Alice in Borderland can be streamed on Netflix. 






 1  One Piece (2023) 
The original anime, based on Eiichiro Oda&#39;s manga, began in 1999 and is still ongoing.


 







 One Piece (Live-Action) 

 Release Date   August 31, 2023    Cast   Iñaki Godoy , Mackenyu , Emily Rudd , Jacob Romero Gibson , Taz Skylar    Genres   Action , Adventure , Comedy , Fantasy    Rating   TV-14    




Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of One Piece captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda’s original manga with ease. Set in a world of piracy and adventure, it tells the story of Monkey D. Luffy&#39;s quest to become the Pirate King. The show excels in world-building, using detailed sets and background characters to create a believable universe. While some visual effects, like Luffy&#39;s stretching powers, are challenging to adapt to live-action, the series generally manages to balance physical effects with CGI.
Impressively, the anime adaptation of Oda&#39;s manga is still ongoing to this day. With over a thousand episodes, the condensed Netflix show offers an easier entry into the One Piece universe. After much anticipation, the 2023-premiering show One Piece is Netflix&#39;s best live-action anime adaptation in years, receiving widespread acclaim for its faithfulness to the anime and compelling performances.
