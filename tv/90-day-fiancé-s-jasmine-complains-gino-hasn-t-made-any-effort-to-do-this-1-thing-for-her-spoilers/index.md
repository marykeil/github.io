## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Jasmine Pineda shares the biggest regret in her relationship with Gino Palazzolo after dating him for three years.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda revealed the one thing that&#39;s bothered her the most about Gino Palazzolo in their three-year-long relationship. Jasmine is a 36-year-old woman from Panama, now living in Michigan with Gino. Jasmine and Gino met online and began a long-distance relationship for nine months before Gino took the opportunity to fly to Panama on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. Jasmine and 53-year-old Gino are one of the few franchise couples who didn&#39;t have communication issues due to a language barrier. Jasmine is fluent in English due to her background as an American literature teacher.




However, Gino seemingly can&#39;t speak any Spanish at all, as revealed by Jasmine in a preview clip from 90 Day Fiancé episode 10, shared by Extra.


 

Gino and Jasmine are in Miami in the next episode, and Jasmine is elated to have left the cold climate of Canton behind, at least for a few days. The couple is driving to their hotel as Jasmine takes in the sights and sounds of the place. As their cab driver points to the Miami harbor and scenic skyline, Jasmine asks him, &#34;Do you speak Spanish?&#34; The driver replies, &#34;I do,&#34; and jokes that it is his primary language. Jasmine starts complaining to him about Gino in Spanish. &#34;This ****** gringo doesn&#39;t speak Spanish at all,&#34; she says.

Jasmine confesses that she misses talking in Spanish. She is disappointed with Gino as he hasn&#39;t made any effort to learn Spanish in their three years of dating. &#34;Here you learn easily because not a lot of people speak English,&#34; the cab driver tells Jasmine. Gino misinterprets what he is saying and asks the driver, &#34;So you don&#39;t speak much English?&#34; The driver replies, &#34;I do,&#34; which makes Gino feel embarrassed. Jasmine is left in awe after hearing him talk about Miami and decides that it is the place where she can see herself living in the United States. &#34;It&#39;s like living the American Dream in the Latin American way,&#34; she declares.

One of the hardest things Jasmine did when she moved to the U.S. was saying goodbye to the sunny Panama City weather. She couldn&#39;t see herself parting with the fun she had in her country with her family. Jasmine felt the chilly weather in Michigan was not meant for her at all. She said that Michigan screams of depression and didn&#39;t like that it was gloomy and dark, calling it the &#34;winter version of h***.&#34; Jasmine eventually dreams of bringing her two sons with her to the U.S. along with her kid sister Liz. Perhaps Jasmine is envisioning living in Miami and not Michigan with them.




Gino might not want to move out of his state because it&#39;s where most of his family is located. However, Jasmine is known to be persuasive and might put her foot down until Gino says yes. Jasmine loves the sun and the beach, and Michigan is not her American dream. She also wants to launch a real estate career once she marries Gino. 90 Day Fiancé season 10 might show Jasmine being able to finally fulfill her dream in the U.S.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
