## Literature Review
Vanderpump Rules cast members, including Tom Sandoval, Lala Kent, and Katie Maloney, offer their opinions on Rachel Leviss&#39; new podcast.




The ex-Vanderpump Rules star Rachel (Raquel) Leviss has revealed she&#39;s debuting a podcast, and her former castmates have opinions. The upcoming show, Rachel Goes Rogue, will launch on January 8, 2024, only a few weeks before Vanderpump Rules season 11 premieres. The podcast pledges to delve into Rachel&#39;s seven-month affair with Tom Sandoval, telling her side of the story. In her podcast&#39;s official trailer, Rachel teased listeners with the prospect of being surprised about what they may find out.




Debuting on iHeart Radio, Rachel Goes Rogue promises to explore a broad spectrum of topics, emphasizing self-empowerment and navigating life&#39;s challenges through a no-holds-barred approach. Rachel will confront her truths, reveal secrets, and speak about strength gained from ongoing transformations. Notably, the podcast will feature prominent guests from entertainment, pop culture, mental health, and self-help areas. As Rachel embarks on this bold journey, some fellow castmates have chosen words, especially since she&#39;ll be absent from Vanderpump Rules season 11.


 Tom Sandoval Isn&#39;t Concerned 
          

During the Two Ts In A Pod with Teddi Mellencamp and Tamra Judge (via Heavy) podcast episode released on December 7, Tom expressed impassivity towards Rachel&#39;s podcast and implied he&#39;s skeptical about its success. Even after Tom went topless to announce his own podcast, he critiqued Rachel, stating her behavior seemed immature and suggested she was &#34;pushing blame on everybody else.&#34; Tom also revealed he wanted to continue dating Rachel even after news of their relationship came out, and his comments suggest he&#39;s bitter about the way their relationship ended.






 Lala Kent Shared Some Advice 
          

On a December 6 episode of Give Them Lala (via Heavy), Lala Kent critiqued Rachel&#39;s podcast cover art, deeming it &#34;boring,&#34; &#34;lame,&#34; and &#34;stupid.&#34; Considering Rachel&#39;s past controversial moments, Lala thinks a more provocative or story-driven visual would have made an impact. She suggested an &#34;oopsie face&#34; or something along those lines that&#39;s more engaging. Lala advised Rachel to focus on download numbers over comments, highlighting that even negative attention translates into listening, ultimately contributing to overall viewership.



 Katie Maloney Is Indifferent 

 




In a recent Off the Vine with Kaitlyn Bristowe podcast episode, Rachel&#39;s former colleague, Katie Maloney, questioned her choice to host a podcast instead of returning as part of the Vanderpump Rules season 11 cast. Katie suggested that returning to the show could&#39;ve shed more light on Rachel&#39;s actions and given her an already established platform to plead her case. Katie said, &#34;If you want to tell your side, I think you should have just come back this season.&#34; Despite this reaction, Katie acknowledged the reason behind Rachel&#39;s decision to stay away from the show, citing her focus on mental health. Katie expressed understanding, stating, &#34;You got to do what you got to do to take care of yourself.&#34;



 Ariana Madix Is Unfazed 
          

During a recent Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen episode, Ariana Madix casually addressed Rachel&#39;s podcast, indicating she was unfazed. Ariana quipped, &#34;Do your thing, girl. Good luck!&#34; Her carefree response suggests she&#39;s not worried about Rachel&#39;s actions or her podcast. As Vanderpump Rules season 11 progresses, some wonder how Rachel will stir the pot off-camera. With Ariana&#39;s dismissive stance, the unfolding dynamics between the two - and Sandoval - will make for an intriguing watch.










Vanderpump Rules season 11 premieres January 30, 2024 at 8 p.m. EST, on Bravo and streaming on Peacock.
