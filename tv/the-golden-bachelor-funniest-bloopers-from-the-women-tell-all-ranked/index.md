## Literature Review
ABC surprised The Golden Bachelor stars with hilarious behind-the-scenes bloopers during the Tell All. Here are the most memorable montages. 




The blooper reel shown at The Golden Bachelor Tell All featured some hilarious moments from the show. After an impressive inaugural season of The Golden Bachelor, all the cast came together in &#34;The Women Tell All&#34; special to discuss some of the season&#39;s most memorable moments. Apart from a surprise guest appearance from Kris Jenner, who revealed look-alike Susan was her favorite, Gerry Turner shocked everyone by sending Faith Martin home. Leslie Fhima and Theresa Nist became the last standing women from the 22 that started the show.




Still, in what was completely unexpected and ultimately the funniest moment of the night, ABC decided to show a blooper reel of some of the hilarious behind-the-scenes moments from the show. The reel featured some of the cast members&#39; most embarrassing and funniest moments throughout the season. Although the blooper featured most of the cast, it contained perhaps a historical highlight from one of the women.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Pronouncing Gerry&#39;s Name Incorrectly 

 

In a dating reality TV series that involves 22 women competing for the attention and affection of one man, one would think that the first thing the ladies would never want to get wrong is the name of their prospective partner. However, that wasn&#39;t the case when The Golden Bachelor blooper reel was played, and it featured a montage of some of the contestants trying to pronounce Gerry&#39;s name correctly. Many pronounced Jerry for Gerry and had to be corrected several times (via Bachelor Nation).




While the mispronunciation might seem like a rookie mistake, not knowing how to use Gerry and Jerry is a common mistake many people make. Not only are G and J very close on the English alphabet table, but they are pronounced at the same location in the mouth, and Gerry and Jerry are also similarly spelled. Still, the ladies can be forgiven since none of them got sent home for getting Gerry&#39;s name wrong.



 The Women Sitting Down During The First Rose Ceremony 
         

In The Bachelor universe, the first rose ceremony is significant since it allows contestants to make a lasting first impression on the leading man or woman. However, the enormity of the moment didn&#39;t seem to faze The Golden Bachelor women who, although all dolled up, asked if they could sit down and do the ceremony in the sitting position when they couldn&#39;t afford to stand much longer than they already had.




Seeing the ladies looking tired before meeting their prospective partner was one of the funniest behind-the-scenes montages. While the likelihood of women sitting during the rose ceremony will most likely be unacceptable in most of the other Bachelor Nation shows, the youngest woman on The Golden Bachelor is 60 years old. As senior citizens, The Golden Bachelor women received more lax rules than what is considered normal in the Bachelor Universe.



 Kathy Being Clumsy 
          

The Golden Bachelor star Kathy Swarts didn&#39;t stay long on the show and was evicted during episode 4. Besides Kathy&#39;s feud with Theresa, which marked her time on the show, The Golden Bachelor bloopers showed another side of the retired education consultant from Austin. After warning her co-stars about being &#34;an accident waiting to happen&#34; and being worried about &#34;face-planting,&#34; the bloopers showed Kathy falling a couple of times, once into a couch and another time in the pool. Despite being 70 years old, Kathy held her own on the show, and a couple of falls only added another layer to the reality star.






 Gerry Always Saying &#34;So&#34; 
          

One of the least surprising montages of clips from the season was Gerry&#39;s continuous use of the word &#34;so&#34; to begin his sentences. This notable habit will live long in the memory of The Golden Bachelor fans and cast. The Golden Bachelor lead used the word so often that even the women quickly realized it early in the show. Gerry&#39;s usage of the word &#34;so&#34; was so constant the women could anticipate and mimic the moment he said the word. It also became a banter, and it was funny to see Gerry also make fun of his own speech pattern.



 Susan Flashing Kathy 

 




One of the most obvious takeaways from The Golden Bachelor blooper reels was that the women interacted quite freely with one another. However, when Kathy asked Susan if she had nip covers on in one of the montages, no one expected Susan to casually lift her gown and show her boobs for Kathy and the other ladies to see. The funny moment was accompanied by gasps from the other women before Kathy faced the camera and said, &#34;Hope you liked that view.&#34;



 The Women Burping During Confessionals 
          

The majority of The Golden Bachelor&#39;s behind-the-scenes clips spotlighted individuals. However, one of the most embarrassing things all the women similarly did was make bodily noises during their confessionals. While some of their stomachs gurgled, others burped during their confessionals. Judging from the clip, most of the women had their confessionals just after eating, making their burps quite excusable but nonetheless hilarious.






 Sandra Mason&#39;s Fart Blooper 

 

In what was perhaps the most embarrassing and funniest scene from the clip, Sandra Mason warned the camera crew of her lower G.I. upset, explaining they would all have to live with it, preparing them for what was about to occur. After telling the crew to hold on a second, Sandra let out a pretty loud fart that went on for uncomfortably long. She then proceeded like nothing happened, saying, &#34;You were saying.&#34; Sandra’s fart blooper drew the biggest laugh from The Golden Bachelor crowd, and the reality star herself couldn’t bear to watch it, covering her face in embarrassment.

Sandra was one of the cast members who complained about the living arrangements of the mansion, which eventually made her choose the lower bunk because of her knees. Still, the bloopers showed the funny side of the 75-year-old whose fart blooper has set the bar high for future contestants. After an entertaining season, the blooper reel showed fans the funny side of the women that weren’t necessarily featured in the series, and it was undoubtedly one of the funniest moments of The Golden Bachelor Tell All.






The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
