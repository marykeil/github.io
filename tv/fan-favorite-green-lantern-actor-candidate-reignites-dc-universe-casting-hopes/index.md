## Literature Review
A long-time fan favorite actor choice for John Stewart sparks new interest in him being cast in James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe as an iconic Green Lantern.




This is Us star Sterling K. Brown chimes in on possibly joining James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe as John Stewart in the Lanterns TV show. Gunn&#39;s DC Universe is on its way, following the official conclusion of the DCEU that wrapped up its decade-long-run with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. While Superman: Legacy will be the first movie to come out from DC Studios, viewers will get a taste of the new DC Universe this year with the Creature Commandos TV show.




In a recent interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Brown was asked about whether or not he would still be interested in playing Stewart, with James Gunn now running DC Studios and a Lanterns TV show being one of the major projects in the works. After discussing the fact that one of the Green Lanterns has already been cast, Brown shared the following about possibly playing John Stewart in the DC Universe:


I watched that Justice League cartoon religiously in like high school, college right after, etc. It was dope. Seeing John Stewart, knowing that there was a black Green Lantern was something like in terms of representation, was like &#39;Oh Man! Thereâ€™s a space for me in this world and I see it.&#39; And when I looked [at the cartoon], I would think, &#39;I kind of look like this dude.&#39; If it could happen, that would be legitimately exciting. That would be one of those giddy-inducing moments in life because my kids would get it, without me having to explain it to them.


                  5 More Green Lanterns That Can Appear In DC Universe&#39;s TV Show   While Hal Jordan and John Stewart have been confirmed for the DCU&#39;s upcoming Lanterns series, other Green Lanterns from Earth could debut as well.    





 What We Know About John Stewart In James Gunn&#39;s Green Lantern TV Show 
         

In January 2023, John Stewart was announced as one of the two leads for the Lanterns TV series that will be coming out on Max, alongside Hal Jordan. The Max drama is supposedly pulling inspiration from True Detectives, with the show set to focus on an ancient horror. According to Gunn, the mystery surrounding this plot will play a big role in DC Universe movies and TV shows outside of Lanterns.

Very little has been revealed so far about John Stewart&#39;s role in the show, but Lanterns will focus on his relationship with Hal as they work together as the Green Lanterns of Earth. Lanterns will mark the first proper live-action debut of John Stewart, as he was almost featured in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League. It&#39;s unclear if Lanterns have even started casting yet, or if that is still too early at this point.






The second version of Greg Berlanti&#39;s Green Lantern TV show was set to feature John Stewart as the leading character after the series got retooled.




Given how popular John Stewart is as a DC superhero thanks to the Justice League animated shows, it will be exciting to see who actually gets tapped to play him. It will also be intriguing to see what role Stewart plays later on in the DC Universe. Hopefully, as DC Studios get further into 2024, Lanterns will announce who will be playing John Stewart, allowing audiences to get a clearer sense of what to expect for the hero going forward.
