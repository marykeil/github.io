  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Many House, M.D. characters had to overcome a lot of obstacles on their way to success, but they never got to their happily-ever-after.</p>
<p>Summary
The characters in House, M.D. often faced personal setbacks and misfortunes despite their professional success.
Some characters, like Dr. Taub, received a happy ending despite their questionable behavior, while others who grew and evolved were left alone and miserable.
The shocking death of Kutner was a frustrating plot twist that ended the potential growth and bright future of the character.</p>
<p>House, M.D. had some of the most well-developed characters on television, but the show largely mishandled their fates. If they had breakthroughs at work, their personal lives took a hit or got destroyed completely. Gregory House was a complete jerk on multiple occasions, so he had most of the misfortunes coming, but that was not the case for everyone else. House&rsquo;s colleagues at least tried to be better people, but they still ended up alone and miserable by the end of the series. Other characters had even worse fates — Kutner&rsquo;s shocking death in House, M.D. was absolutely infuriating.
Certain House, M.D. main characters were more likable than others for obvious reasons, but even if they deserved the world after everything they had been through, they rarely got it. In reality, it often worked the other way around — for instance, Dr. Christopher Taub was a manipulative cheater who hurt his wife, but somehow still got his version of a happy ending. Even though Taub was frequently the only voice of reason on House&rsquo;s diagnostics team, he was not a nice person, and he was not willing to change, unlike other characters who constantly strove to grow and evolve.</p>
<p>The 8 Best Couples In House, Ranked
There were quite a few couples over the course of eight seasons of House, M.D., but some surely worked better together than others by a long shot.</p>
<p>6  Dr. Lisa Cuddy
Played by Lisa Edelstein</p>
<p>Dr. Lisa Cuddy was one of the few genuinely lovable characters in House, M.D. Not only did she put up with House himself for the sake of the hospital and patients, but she also tried to do her best for everyone even when she was faced with impossible decisions. While it made sense for Cuddy to leave House, M.D. after season 7 because House driving his car into her living room out of spite in the finale, &ldquo;Moving On,&rdquo; was truly the last straw, she deserved better than to quit the job she loved and was wonderful at.
House, M.D. season 6, episode 14, &ldquo;5 to 9,&rdquo; showcased how hard Cuddy&rsquo;s work was since she had to deal with House&rsquo;s childish shenanigans, run the entire hospital, and outsmart the executives who wanted to tear her down. Cuddy did not get enough credit for staying as positive, calm, and patient as she did most of the time. Not a lot of people would have been able to handle House the way she did. Hopefully, Cuddy quickly found another high-paying job as the Dean of Medicine off-screen, where no one made her life more difficult than it should be.</p>
<p>5  Dr. Robert Chase
Played by Jesse Spencer</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Chase had the most character development throughout House, M.D.&rsquo;s eight seasons. He went from being a self-doubting man who never dared to defy House to becoming a confident doctor who stood up for what he believed in. While Chase&rsquo;s professional journey&rsquo;s ending was satisfactory, as no one deserved more to replace House as the Head of the Department of Diagnostics than he did, his love life remained a disaster. Chase loved Cameron with all his heart, and it was a shame that they could not work out their problems. Chase should’ve had another shot at happiness.</p>

Robert Chase and Allison Cameron were married in the Fox medical drama series House, M.D., but their relationship was not built to last.</p>
<p>4  Dr. James Wilson
Played by Robert Sean Leonard</p>
<p>Dr. James Wilson was a kindhearted man who had the worst luck in both his personal and professional life. He kept choosing his career over his marriages, but once Wilson was willing to change his self-destructive ways, Amber, the only person he could&rsquo;ve been happy with, tragically died in a bus crash in the season 4 finale, &ldquo;Wilson&rsquo;s Heart.&rdquo; This storyline was one of the most beautifully written plots in House, M.D., but Wilson needn&rsquo;t have suffered this much. Amber was everything to him, and it would&rsquo;ve been incredible if he&rsquo;d gotten to turn his life around for her.
Wilson was beloved by his colleagues, patients, and friends. He was such an amazing human being that even House, the most selfish person in the world, could not help but care about Wilson. His final story arc felt like a slap in the face. He spent his life fighting cancer and saving lives, even becoming the Head of the Department of Oncology. Wilson should not have ended up with a terminal cancer diagnosis — the fact that he refused to treat it was too cruel a joke. This plot twist was the most unfair thing to happen in House, M.D.</p>
<p>3  Dr. Gregory House
Played by Hugh Laurie</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory House was the most complex character in House, M.D. He was excruciatingly annoying, and yet he was also a medical genius. Even though House occasionally turned into a better version of himself, usually for a woman who temporarily took over his heart, he could never stick to the positive changes in his personality. After a while, House&rsquo;s awful attitude became tiresome and repetitive. His decision to fake his own death in House, M.D.&rsquo;s series finale was idiotic and reckless. It would have been much more satisfying if House stopped being a manchild at some point.</p>
<p>2  Dr. Lawrence Kutner
Played by Kal Penn</p>
<p>Dr. Lawrence Kutner joined House&rsquo;s team in season 4 and quickly proved his worth with plenty of correct diagnoses and clever treatment ideas. Kutner&rsquo;s death in House, M.D. season 5, episode 20, &ldquo;Simple Explanation&rdquo; came as a shock. Although Kutner&rsquo;s suicide was flawlessly utilized to propel the plot and have House deal with the aftermath of his actions, it wasn&rsquo;t the best plot twist for the character in question. Kutner was only starting to spread his wings as a diagnostician, and he brought new energy to the show. He could&rsquo;ve had a bright future on House&rsquo;s team and beyond.</p>
<p>1  Dr. Remy &ldquo;Thirteen&rdquo; Hadley
Played by Olivia Wilde</p>
<p>Dr. Remy &ldquo;Thirteen&rdquo; Hadley had a lot of secrets, which was what made her compelling. Thirteen was easily one of the best characters in House, M.D. — she had a tragic backstory, she was a highly competent doctor, and she minded her own business. The storyline that revolved around whether Thirteen had Huntington&rsquo;s disease or not was important for the character&rsquo;s growth, but it would&rsquo;ve been more appropriate if she hadn&rsquo;t tested positive for it. Thirteen would have still overcome her fear of knowing and became all the better for it, but she would have had the future she deserved.</p>
