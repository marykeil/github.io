## Literature Review

Some shows manage to build up trust between characters that feels unbreakable, so when a sudden betrayal shatters that trust, it hits hard.




When shows build up a strong bond between characters or the audience and the characters, it can be a major emotional hit when a secret is revealed and the betrayal comes to light. One of the most important elements of any show is the relationships between the characters. Whether that is romantic, platonic, or any other kind of a relationship of trust.
If a show takes the time to build trust between the characters and with the audience, viewers can get comfortable and familiar with the format. For example, with any good sitcom, the characters should be familiar and that breeds a sense of comfort and positivity. But, with other types of shows, they may take an established trust and turn it upside down with some significant betrayal, which can add to the strength of the story and make things even more emotional as the story suddenly jerks in a new direction.









 








 12  Jesse Was Actually A Spy 
Glee
        

A great example of this type of betrayal comes from the teenage musical TV series Glee. In the latter half of season 1, Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), a talented singer who was the frontman for the McKinley High Glee club&#39;s biggest rivals, Vocal Adrenaline, transfers to McKinley and joins the team. He slowly earns their trust and even starts a relationship with Rachel. Which made his betrayal in the penultimate episode even worse. He eggs Rachel, reveals he was spying on the team, and leaves to rejoin his old team.





 11  Grant Ward Is HYDRA 
Agents Of SHIELD


 







Agents of SHIELD follows a series of highly trained secret operatives as they work to contain any superhuman and extraterrestrial threats. From the start, Grant Ward is portrayed as a gifted spy, and Skye works hard to earn his trust. Framing the relationship with Skye trying to gain his trust, and having him set up as an established member of the team, meant that when Grant revealed himself as a HYDRA agent, it came completely out of the blue. This betrayal stung for as long as Grant kept appearing on the show, and he never turned back after leaving.

 10  Ezra Had Ulterior Motives 
Pretty Little Liars
        

Ezra and Aria had a long, messy relationship for years in Pretty Little Liars, with the pair meeting at a bar and shortly after sparking a relationship, learning that Ezra was a teacher and Aria, six years his junior, was one of his students.

However, near the end of the fourth season, the fairytale relationship hit a major snag when Ezra reveals the truth about the beginning of their relationship.
As it turned out, Ezra had dated Alison before her death, and when she was murdered, he set out on a mission to write a true crime novel, with her as the central figure for the story. Ezra had known who Aria was from the very beginning, and when he met and started a relationship with the 16-year-old girl, he was fully aware she would be his student and had close ties to his late ex. The entire relationship was altered with this revelation, and Ezra became a much seedier, darker figure than before.





 9  Joe Is A Stalker 
You

Joe murders for Beck, and eventually murders Beck, in an ultimate betrayal, after winning her affections through careful manipulation.





 8  Sylvie Kills He Who Remains 
Loki

 6 MCU Projects Sylvie Can Appear In After Loki Season 2 
Though season 2 of Loki seemingly wrapped up Sylvie&#39;s character arc, her story can still continue in these potential future MCU projects.



The trust between the two surely stands for something, but when Sylvie pushes Loki through a portal and kills He Who Remains despite the consequences, the betrayal is a jaw-dropping moment. Loki season 2 does much to repair the relationship and open up a new way forward, but this initial twist was unexpected and massively shook Loki&#39;s confidence. Ultimately, Sylvie gave the prime example of selfishness in the season 1 finale, and Loki offered a look at absolute selflessness at the conclusion of season 2.

 1  The Red Wedding 
Game Of Thrones
        

The infamous Red Wedding scene in Game of Thrones happened in the penultimate episode of season 3. In a show that never shied from killing off central characters from the very first episode, the series had to find new ways to build tension beyond major character deaths. The Red Wedding did exactly that when Robb Stark and a large group of his men were brutally massacred at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey. This scene reaffirmed how high the stakes of the show were and changed the dynamics as Robb was positioned to take the Iron Throne.
