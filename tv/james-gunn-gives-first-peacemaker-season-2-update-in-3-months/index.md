## Literature Review
The DCU&#39;s Peacemaker season 2 finally gets an encouraging update from original series writer and DC Studios CEO James Gunn after months of silence.




The DCU&#39;s Peacemaker season 2 finally gets an official update from DC Studios CEO James Gunn. Despite being a reboot, James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s DC Universe will bring back a few actors and characters introduced in the DCEU. One of the characters who will survive the reboot is John Cena&#39;s Christopher Smith a.k.a. Peacemaker, who&#39;s set to return in the DCU&#39;s upcoming Peacemaker season 2. Although the series wasn&#39;t included in James Gunn&#39;s first announcement for the DCU&#39;s &#34;Gods and Monsters&#34; first chapter and doesn&#39;t have a release date by January 2024, it has been confirmed to release in the near future.




In October 2023, James Gunn revealed that he was writing Peacemaker season 2. Three months later, Gunn&#39;s latest Peacemaker season 2 update on Threads confirms that the DCU show continues to be in active development, with Gunn personally working on the script. According to the writer, he has already written over half of the show. See Gunn&#39;s post below:

          


 


 Is Peacemaker Season 1 and 2 Part Of The New DCU Canon? 
          

During James Gunn&#39;s initial announcement of the DCU&#39;s first chapter, &#34;Gods and Monsters&#34;, the DC Studios CEO confirmed that the DCU will reboot the DCEU&#39;s continuity, which means that none of the characters that appear in the DCU will be the exact same versions introduced in the previous franchise. However, characters such as the Peacemaker season 1 cast will be portrayed by the same actors and will be quite similar to their DCEU counterparts. Therefore, it&#39;s possible that John Cena&#39;s Peacemaker will already have defeated the White Dragon, but he may not have met the Justice League, and the Butterfly invasion may have happened differently.




Taking the DCU&#39;s reboot nature into account, it could be said that Peacemaker season 1&#39;s canon status within the DCU is somewhat flexible, while Peacemaker season 2 certainly won&#39;t be part of the DCEU&#39;s canon. This way, both seasons could be watched back to back alongside other DCU titles despite a couple of discrepancies with other DCU installments. Barring the DCEU&#39;s Justice League cameo, most of Peacemaker season 1&#39;s easter eggs and nods are already ambiguous enough to connect them to the DCU once the reboot officially begins.

Before Peacemaker season 2 arrives, the Peacemaker DCU spinoff Waller will likely answer several questions about Peacemaker&#39;s DCU canon, as Viola Davis&#39; Amanda Waller and possibly other characters who were introduced in the DCEU — including Jennifer Holland&#39;s Emilia Harcourt, Steve Agee&#39;s John Economos, and Danielle Brooks&#39; Leota Adebayo — will make their official DCU debut. Waller and Peacemaker season 2 will then be key to confirm how much of The Suicide Squad will survive the DCU reboot and whether characters like Joel Kinnaman&#39;s Rick Flag, Idris Elba&#39;s Bloodsport, and Margot Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn will be any different or appear in the DCU at all.
