## Literature Review
Love Is Blind’s Brennon Lemieux was rumored to be involved in domestic violence. Why didn&#39;t the show’s producers conduct proper background checks?




Love Is Blind star Brennon Lemieux faced backlash amid his alleged assault allegation, and here are the details to know. Netflix recently wrapped the fifth season of its famous reality series, and the cast has been through a lot since then. While Love Is Blind season 6 is in the works, the show is in trouble with several allegations coming to light. Love Is Blind season 5 failed its contestants because of poor casting choices and multiple lawsuits and allegations. However, Brennon&#39;s past shocked fans and cast members alike before the most recent season.




Brennon genuinely connected with Alexa Alfia on Love Is Blind season 3. The couple seemed like a match made in heaven and appeared to have been in love since the beginning of the show. Fans even declared Brennon and Alexa the Love Is Blind frontrunners, as they were one of the most unproblematic couples on the show. After having little to no ups and downs, Brennan and Alexa convinced each other’s families of their devotion and tied the knot in the finale episode of Love Is Blind. The couple seemed to have found their “happily ever after” just as Brennon&#39;s domestic abuse rumors began to circulate.

 Love Is Blind Star Brennon&#39;s Alleged Assault Explained 
          




In late 2022, a Redditor with the username u/punkcowgirl shared a post attaching a police report as proof of Brennon being involved in a domestic assault. The police report was an actual government document that indicated Brennon being charged with domestic violence in January 2021, before he began filming for Love Is Blind. The reports further described the incident by stating that Brennon asked the complainant to leave after they argued while having a few drinks. When the woman denied Brennon’s request not to go while she was also drinking, he grabbed the woman by her arm and threw her against the wall, leaving the woman unconscious and causing injury.



 Why Viewers Started Blaming The Love Is Blind Producers For Brennon&#39;s Case 
          

Brennon&#39;s domestic assault reports were authentic, and the woman claimed to have suffered bruising and concussion. As per The Tab, while reacting to the alleged assault allegation, Brennon said that the reports are false, and the grand jury rejected it as a “no bill/no validation to the claim.” The confusion around Brennon’s rumored domestic violence persisted and was only the first in many failed attempts to hold the show&#39;s production team to account.




Brennon’s incident has been a huge eye-opener for both viewers and the producers of Love Is Blind. The scandal might be one of the most shocking in the history of the Netflix series, but the allegations only mount. Love Is Blind season 3 had some of the most troublesome cast members, but unfortunately, the show has only gotten more dramatic. Hopefully, production will better protect their future cast members, but it hasn&#39;t looked good.
