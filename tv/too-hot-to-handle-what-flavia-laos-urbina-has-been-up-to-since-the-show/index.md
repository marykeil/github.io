## Literature Review
Flavia Laos Urbina was caught in a love triangle on Too Hot to Handle, but the Peruvian actress is now in a relationship with a very different man.





Too Hot to Handle season 4 introduced ten singles on the hit reality TV dating competition show. However, four newcomers ended up joining the series to shake up the house and offer new temptations. Flavia first tried to steal Scottish race car driver Seb Melrose from American Kayla Richart. When Seb proved loyal, she then set her sights on taking Creed from British beauty Sophie Stonehouse. Flavia succeeded in getting Creed only to end up being played herself when he lied to her about pursuing fellow Australian Imogen Ewan. However, Flavia has since moved on since filming wrapped a year ago.

 Who Is Flavia Laos Urbina Dating After THTH? 

 

Although Flavia wanted to take her TV relationship with Creed to the real world on Too Hot to Handle season 4, as of now, she&#39;s dating singer Austin Palao. While it&#39;s likely that Flavia’s Too Hot to Handle contract has forced her to be somewhat private about her relationship, both she and Austin have videos and photos with each other on their respective Instagram pages. Flavia&#39;s fellow cast members have confirmed that they aren’t allowed to confirm their current relationship statuses until a reunion airs, which may have held Flavia back from posting more.

Flavia has seen her social media gain more followers after starring in the hit Netflix show, though she was already popular in Peru before appearing on Too Hot to Handle. However, finding love with Austin appears to be a big thing that happened for her in 2022. Austin is several years older than Flavia, who, like him, has released her own music. The two have enjoyed romantic travels together, such as a trip to Bali over the summer. Flavia and Austin even released a song together in April called “Estar Contigo.” Like Flavia, Austin is quite popular and has 2.6 million Instagram followers at the moment.



 Was Flavia A Too Hot To Handle Paid Actress? 
          

Many fans of Too Hot to Handle season 4 suspect that Flavia was paid to go after Creed, as her current man looks nothing like him despite the Peruvian stunner declaring Creed to be her exact type. Creed was a clean-shaved blonde, while Flavia now is with a scruffy, dark-haired man. Additionally, Flavia has many acting credentials and was revealed to be quite famous in Peru. Viewers also thought it was convenient that she went after two men in relationships, as she first pursued Seb to get to Kayla and then got under Sophie&#39;s skin. However, Too Hot to Handle fans liked Flavia despite their suspicions about her motives.
