Summary

  Hermes reveals information about Luke&#39;s mother, May, in episode 6, foreshadowing her crucial role in Luke&#39;s downfall and the events of The Last Olympian.   The allusion to May&#39;s prophecies and blessing connects to a scene in the fifth book, where Percy and Nico seek her guidance on how Luke&#39;s body is able to hold Kronos.   May&#39;s love for her son, despite him leaving as a child, is shown through some of her actions, making Luke&#39;s fate even more tragic.  







In Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6, a character Easter egg hints at a sad future reveal for the series. Much like previous episodes, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 has Easter eggs and details, most notably Percy&#39;s dream that hints at Kronos as the main villain. As part of Percy, Annabeth, and Grover&#39;s quest for Zeus&#39; master bolt, episode 6 brings them to Hermes at the Lotus Casino. This, in and of itself, is a major reveal, as Hermes&#39; season 1 presence is already a big but welcome change from Rick Riordan&#39;s Percy Jackson books.

So far, the Percy Jackson Disney&#43; series has taken special care to allude to character arcs other than Percy&#39;s, such as Grover and his expected quest to find Pan. Utilizing the TV show format to expand on the books&#39; story in a way that&#39;s not as singular to Percy&#39;s perspective facilitates this well. With this and Hermes&#39; appearance in episode 6, a brief but important hint about one character ties into who betrays Percy Jackson, as mentioned by the Oracle.





 Hermes Mentions Luke’s Mother In Percy Jackson And The Olympians Episode 6 
          

In episode 6, Annabeth tries to get Hermes to help her and her friends by mentioning their friendship with Luke. Hermes explains that he was warned to stay away from Luke and his mother, May, which is in line with depictions of the gods&#39; behavior so far. Annabeth, who alludes to knowing about Luke&#39;s mother, tells Hermes Luke blames him for what happened to her. Interestingly, Hermes displays a sense of care for his son when he expresses how it feels to be close to a loved one with no option but to hurt each other.

More importantly, Hermes mentions how he intervened to try and help Luke and May, regardless, which references the unfortunate fate Luke&#39;s mother faces in the Percy Jackson series. Later in the book series, it&#39;s revealed that May is a Seer and tried to host Percy Jackson&#39;s Oracle of Delphi. But due to Hades&#39; curse, the Oracle couldn&#39;t be transferred to a mortal body, thus resulting in May&#39;s seizures and the mind-meld she endures. Hermes plants the seeds for future events regarding Luke through his mention of this.





 

                  Percy Jackson Season 1 Episode 6 Recap: Hermes&#39; Return &amp; 7 Other Reveals   Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 features the return of Hermes, as well as some other major story reveals about Percy’s quest.   



 Luke’s Mother Plays A Crucial Role In Luke’s Downfall In Percy Jackson 
          

Mention of May sets up the scene from the fifth book, Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian, when Percy and Nico Di Angelo visit her to learn how Luke can withstand Kronos&#39; possession. This scene touches on May&#39;s prophecies about Luke&#39;s death and reveals that she gave him her blessing to bathe in the River Styx. What&#39;s sadder is, despite May&#39;s muddled mindset, she loves her son even after he&#39;s left her, as she makes cookies for him daily and calls Percy by Luke&#39;s name. Her pleas for Hermes&#39; help emphasizes her powerlessness in preventing her son&#39;s bleak future.




Prior to this, May foresaw that Luke&#39;s body would be a vessel for Kronos, which the River Styx prepared him for. Therefore, May&#39;s blessing is the final piece that ensures Luke will die. Whether he kills himself or lets Percy try to destroy him, Luke won&#39;t survive after Kronos possesses him. Mentioning May sets up Luke&#39;s inevitable downfall in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which could suggest he&#39;s a hero for essentially saving Olympus by dying to defeat Kronos. Plus, it emphasizes Luke&#39;s driving motivation to destroy the Olympian gods, none of whom try to prevent Kronos from possessing him.



New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians premiere on Tuesdays on Disney&#43;.
