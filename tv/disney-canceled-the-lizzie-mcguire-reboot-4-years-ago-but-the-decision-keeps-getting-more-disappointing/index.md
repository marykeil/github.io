## Literature Review

New details about certain storylines from the scrapped Lizzie McGuire reboot reignite the disappointment in Disney&#39;s decision to cancel the show.




Exciting new details about the canceled Lizzie McGuire reboot are making Disney’s decision even more disappointing. Among Disney’s most popular TV shows in the early 2000s was Lizzie McGuire, a sitcom about the titular middle school-aged teen that launched the successful career of Hilary Duff. The show was so popular that it even spawned 2003’s The Lizzie McGuire Movie, which became a $55 million box office hit shortly before Lizzie McGuire&#39;s 2004 series finale was released on Disney Channel. Fifteen years later, Disney began developing a Lizzie McGuire reboot series with Hilary Duff returning, though soon canceled the project.




The Lizzie McGuire reboot was canceled in 2020 due to creative differences between Duff and Disney executives (via THR). Duff wanted to explore mature adult themes as Lizzie navigated life in her early 30s, but this didn’t fit with the Disney&#43; brand. Disney’s other recent reboots of popular 2000s shows, such as Raven’s Home, primarily aired on Disney Channel, so their themes were understandably more family-oriented. However, Duff’s idea for Lizzie McGuire’s reboot would have better targeted the show’s original audience on streaming, and new details reiterate that Disney canceling it was a mistake.


 Disney&#39;s Decision To Cancel The Lizzie McGuire Continues To Get Worse As More Details Are Revealed 
         

Details about what would have been featured in the reboot have continued to be revealed in the four years since its cancelation, with each one being more exciting. Recently, Lizzie McGuire writer Jonathan Hurwitz revealed that the reboot would have seen Lizzie and Gordo reconnect as friends, but not end up together romantically. Gordo would have had a pregnant fiancée with whom he was really happy, with the reboot seeing a romantic twist between Lizzie and Ethan Craft instead. After waking up in Ethan’s bed, animated Lizzie would have cut in with a remark about checking Ethan off of her to-do list – “twice.”




It’s unlikely that Ethan and Lizzie would have become a serious couple, but this plotline confirms that the Lizzie McGuire reboot envisioned by Duff and the creative team would have stayed true to the original show – with more maturity. These details make Lizzie’s future after the original show’s ending more authentic, with the reboot making Duff’s character more relatable to its original audience. Disney’s other reboots have watered down the more adult themes for their now grown-up characters, but Duff’s vision provided a realistic, entertaining way to revisit these beloved figures 15 years later.

 Why The Lizzie McGuire Reboot Deserved A Mature Focus 
          




Just as how middle school-aged viewers saw themselves and their own experiences in Lizzie, the reboot should have been written to reflect the mature experiences of people entering their 30s. The mature focus on Lizzie McGuire would have been an authentic way for the show grow alongside its audience. The family-friendly humor and storylines of the original Lizzie McGuire show were appropriate for a series about 13-year-olds, but a proper, honest reboot about Lizzie as an adult would need to adjust to fit the experiences of 30-year-olds – which, yes, may include Lizzie having a one-night stand with Ethan.

Though a mature Lizzie McGuire reboot may not have fit Disney&#39;s branding on Disney&#43;, the studio also owns Hulu, where the majority of its mature content streams. Similar to how Hilary Duff led the adult-oriented How I Met Your Father spinoff series on the streaming platform, Disney could have placed a mature Lizzie McGuire series on Hulu. This way, Disney would have assured audiences that the reboot&#39;s themes were targeting adults and original Lizzie McGuire fans, rather than focusing on appealing to a new generation of younger viewers on Disney&#43;.
