Dewey&rsquo;s musical ability and creativity surpass Malcolm&rsquo;s, as seen when Malcolm asks him for help with music homework.

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) was the genius of his family, but his brothers and parents proved they were just as smart as him.</p>
<p>Despite Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) being the clear genius of his family in Malcolm in the Middle, there were also some great moments that proved that his siblings and parents were just as smart as him. The hit sitcom had a 7-season run before coming to an end in 2006, as Malcolm headed off to Harvard, with all of his hard work finally paying off. Despite his departure, Malcolm in the Middle&rsquo;s Wilkerson family home was still bustling, with Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) and Hal (Bryan Cranston) discovering they were expecting baby number six.
Malcolm in the Middle is best remembered for its storylines surrounding the chaos caused by Malcolm and his siblings, Francis (Christopher Kennedy Masterson), Reese (Justin Berfield), Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), and Jamie. While there were plenty of great characters in Malcolm in the Middle, it&rsquo;s the Wilkersons, in particular, that make the show so brilliant. Despite Malcolm supposedly being the brains of the family, each member of Malcolm&rsquo;s family had their own kind of intelligence that trumped his, as the show cleverly illustrated numerous times.

<p>10 Dewey&rsquo;s Musical Ability
Season 4, Episode 2: &ldquo;Humilithon&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dewey&rsquo;s greatest talent in Malcolm in the Middle was his musical ability. This was a recurring reference throughout the show but was first seen in season 4, with Dewey secretly ordering a piano and hiding it in the garage. He teaches himself how to play, picking up the skill with ease, and in later seasons, Dewey partakes in nationwide competitions and writes entire musical compositions and plays. Dewey&rsquo;s musicality is one thing that Malcolm doesn&rsquo;t have, with one episode seeing Malcolm beg his younger brother for help with his music homework, clearly lacking the same creative instincts that Dewey has.</p>
<p>9 Jamie The Thief
Season 6, Episode 20: &ldquo;Stealing&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngest of the Wilkerson clan, Jamie, was born in Malcolm in the Middle season 4 finale. Despite being a non-verbal toddler by the end of the show, he still managed to show his smarts. Without prompting, Jamie manages to sneak through the garden fence into the neighbor&rsquo;s yard, slipping through a window and reappearing with various pieces of jewelry and money. While the youngest sibling may have never spoken on-screen, he did manage to prove that there was still a lot going on inside his head.</p>
<p>8 Reese&rsquo;s Cooking Skills
Season 2, Episode 18: &ldquo;Reese Cooks&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reese&rsquo;s best talent was easily his cooking abilities, which he first discovered in season 2. As a way to try and mix up the pattern of Reese&rsquo;s punishments, Hal takes Reese to a cooking class, only to discover that he is a natural chef. This was a recurring plot point throughout the show, with Reese&rsquo;s refined palate for gourmet food developing over time.
Eventually, Reese took over the major meals in the year, including Thanksgiving and Hal and Lois&rsquo; anniversary dinner. His parents began to use his love for food to control his behavior, threatening to take away cooking time as a punishment. Although cooking wasn&rsquo;t something Malcolm attempted to tackle, it was great to see Reese&rsquo;s character become more developed through his cooking skills, proving he was more than just the thoughtless thug he was known for.</p>
<p>7 Lois&rsquo; Manipulation To Get Her Job Back
Season 1, Episode 9: &ldquo;Lois VS. Evil&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout Malcolm in the Middle, Lois worked at the local store, Lucky Aide. While this job wasn&rsquo;t the greatest, it did help the Wilkersons keep a roof over their heads and also gave a reason for Lois&rsquo; hapless co-worker, Craig (David Anthony Higgins) to keep himself firmly involved in her life. Although Lois wasn&rsquo;t the boss, it often felt like it, having worked there for many years, and was able to use this to her advantage when she was fired in season 1.
Her knowledge of Mr. Pinter&rsquo;s (Marc Vann) personal life helps her guilt-trip the man over how her firing has affected her family. However, upon Pinter&rsquo;s realization that Craig and the rest of the Lucky Aide team are listening in on his conversation with Lois, he panics, quits, and disappears. While this wasn&rsquo;t done on purpose, it shows just how strong Lois&rsquo; morals are and how sticking to her guns pays off.</p>
<p>6 Francis Drives The Car Backwards
Season 1, Episode 3: &ldquo;Home Alone 4&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Malcolm in the Middle&rsquo;s best episodes, &ldquo;Home Alone 4,&rdquo; truly establishes Francis&rsquo; character. While he would always be the reckless and rebellious oldest son, he immediately prioritizes when Malcolm gets hurt and has to be taken to the hospital. Despite the possibility of returning home from military school lingering over his head, Francis realizes what is truly important.
However, instead of dropping himself and his brothers in trouble with Lois and Hal, Francis gets creative. After being strictly told not to use the car, with Lois making note of the mileage before she and Hal leave for the weekend, Francis drives it in reverse all the way to the Emergency Room. Although it wasn&rsquo;t the safest idea, it shows just how much he cares about his younger siblings and saves the day while still keeping them all out of trouble.</p>
<p>5 Francis The Dude Ranch Wizard
Season 4, Episode 8: &ldquo;Boys At Ranch&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys at Ranch&rdquo; is an episode that best displays Francis&rsquo; character development in Malcolm in the Middle. With Hal, Reese, Malcolm, and Dewey visiting the Grotto, Francis shows just how much he&rsquo;s grown up, prioritizing the boys&rsquo; safety over everything else. Like many, Hal is surprised to see this change in his eldest son, especially at how easily Francis adapted to the dude ranch life, almost overnight. These skills also become useful to Francis outside his job, and with his experience working with cows and horses, he manages to help Lois give birth to Jamie later in the season.</p>
<p>4 Dewey&rsquo;s Emotional Intelligence
Season 6, Episode 2: &ldquo;Buseys Run Away&rdquo;</p>
<p>Season 5 saw Dewey be entered into the Buseys class, a group of students with emotional difficulties. Despite knowing that he should be in the Krelboyne class, as Malcolm had given him the wrong answers to the IQ test out of fear Dewey would experience the same abuse he did, Dewey decides to stay with the Buseys. Dewey realizes that he can help the Busey students, as he has the patience and understanding to deal with them.
Even when Lois finds out and has him placed back into the mainstream, Dewey fakes a breakdown to return. While he knew that staying would make him appear to be a troubled child, Dewey was committed to the Buseys. Trying to make sure the Buseys had an actual education, as well as the opportunity to be more socially interactive, simply proves just how emotionally intelligent Dewey is.</p>
<p>Malcolm In The Middle: 10 Reasons Why The Show Is Still Relevant 17 Years Later<br>
The hit sitcom is still as relatable to audiences as it was upon its initial release in 2000. 17 years later, the world still loves Malcolm and co.</p>
<p>3 Dewey The Traveler
Season 1, Episode 16: &ldquo;Water Park&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Malcolm in the Middle&rsquo;s funniest scenes saw Dewey form an unusual, yet sweet, bond with his babysitter, only for the older woman to suddenly die. Having been unable to join the family at the water park, Dewey is left alone and ends up taking a journey across the country. Despite being a young child, Dewey is unfazed by the various strangers he comes across, having to trust them to get home.
While this situation would be incredibly dangerous, he manages to get back home with barely a scratch on him. Crossing paths with criminals, field workers, and even a scarecrow, Dewey also keeps himself fed and safe the entire time with no issue. Although it&rsquo;s not clear whether his geographical knowledge assisted him or not, it&rsquo;s obvious that Dewey&rsquo;s street smarts are underrated by his family, who don&rsquo;t believe his tales upon their return.</p>
<p>2 Lois&rsquo; Sneaky Babysitter Hire
Season 4, Episode 13: &ldquo;Stereo Store&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malcolm in the Middle introduced Jessica (Hayden Panettiere) in season 4 as the boys&rsquo; new babysitter, in a rather sly move from Lois. Malcolm, in particular, was horrified, with Jessica being the same age as him and a peer from school, especially as his classmate was able to run laps around Reese and Dewey. While this seems like a bit of a heartless decision from Lois, it shows just how smart she is.
Lois knew that hiring Jessica would give her peace of mind, but it would also challenge her sons and their behavior. Lois also knew that Jessica&rsquo;s presence could be used to embarrass them if needed. Considering how many babysitters and other forms of childcare the boys managed to drive away, it was a brilliant and conniving but relatable act from their mother.</p>
<p>1 Hal&rsquo;s Painting Skills
Season 2, Episode 14: &ldquo;Hal Quits&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Hal was generally the typical paper pusher throughout Malcolm in the Middle, in season 2, he started to show off his creative tendencies. Despite going through some sort of life crisis, Lois supports Hal&rsquo;s decision to quit his job and work on his master painting, a concept he&rsquo;d been mentioning to her for years. This episode is a great demonstration of the creative block, with Hal struggling to know exactly when his piece would be &ldquo;done,&rdquo; but despite some difficulties, he does finish.
The whole family is genuinely amazed by the finished product, so it&rsquo;s clear that his artistic vision is brilliant. However, it&rsquo;s what happens after this that proves just how smart Hal is, and he decides to return to his normal job. While he could easily pursue a career in this area, Hal can identify the stress and pain the painting process caused him was worse than before he quit his job. Despite enjoying his time off in Malcolm in the Middle, Hal is emotionally intelligent enough to realize and accept that the day-to-day, mundane routine he was used to is ultimately better for him.</p>
