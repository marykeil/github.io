## SUMMARY 



The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live can fix some of the shortcomings of previous spinoff shows by exploring a new setting, introducing more action, and delving into the conflict between Rick Grimes and the CRM.   

The spinoff promises to put Rick Grimes in a challenging situation, separated from his loved ones and up against a powerful force.   

The show&#39;s connection to the CRM and other characters from The Walking Dead franchise suggests the potential for a major crossover and the opportunity to introduce new storylines and stakes, unlike the isolated nature of the previous spinoff, Dead City.

## Literature Review
Despite scarce updates, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has revealed a new detail that proves it can achieve what the Dead City spinoff couldn&#39;t.




The latest update on The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live suggests it can achieve what Dead City couldn&#39;t. The Walking Dead&#39;s seven and counting TV shows encapsulate different post-apocalyptic scenarios, from finding a safe place to set up as a home to revealing new, mutated zombie variants. More than this, expanding into spinoffs gives the franchise space to explore existing characters&#39; arcs further, especially after The Walking Dead&#39;s series finale. Dead City attempted this by making Negan and Maggie its focal point and reusing the narrative arc about rescuing Hershel.




While some spinoffs are still ongoing, concluded ones like The Walking Dead: World Beyond and Fear The Walking Dead revealed unique ways to interlink the shows together. For example, the CRM is in multiple shows in the franchise and characters from the main show appear in the main cast of Fear, like Morgan and Dwight. However, some Walking Dead shows aren&#39;t as strong as others either because of tone, pacing, or otherwise. Luckily, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live teases it will avoid one of these shortcomings.


Rick Grimes&#39; Spinoff Can Finally Redeem A Walking Dead Villain You Thought Was Too Far Gone   The much-anticipated Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live promises to address Rick Grimes&#39; time at the CRM. In doing so, one villain can be redeemed.    


 The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live Puts Rick Grimes In A New Scenario 
          



In a recent update, Jadis&#39; actress Pollyanna McIntosh teased a unique situation for Rick Grimes. Additionally, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live&#39;s new setting and tone shifts away from how audiences last saw Rick and Michonne in the main show, but keeps the general spirit of the franchise. The show will also include more action and love, indicating the much anticipated conflict between Rick and the villainous organization, the CRM.

While it&#39;s hard to imagine a situation Rick hasn&#39;t faced after leading the group for over eight seasons, the elusiveness of the CRM leaves a major untapped space for the franchise to explore. In The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, audiences can expect Rick in a rigid setting where he has limited movement, as hinted by the CRM helicopter finding him after he&#39;d supposedly escaped, and he&#39;s separated from all his loved ones. This suggests some familiarity with a much darker Rick Grimes up against a powerful force that has many resources and large numbers of personnel.




The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live - Release Date, Story, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know About Rick &amp; Michonne&#39;s Spinoff   Since his departure from The Walking Dead, Andrew Lincoln has confirmed he will star in a Rick Grimes TV show. Here&#39;s all we know about the series.    



 A New Walking Dead Setting &amp; Storyline Can Help The Franchise Do What Dead City Couldn&#39;t 
          

By putting Rick in a new environment and scenarios, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live can achieve an overall new tone with two of arguably the most recognizable characters. Dead City attempted this with its cooler color tones and metropolitan setting. However, the rehashed storylines, insufficient focus on supporting characters, the Croat&#39;s similarities to Negan, and no real overall narrative progression by the end of the season meant Dead City was not as successful at bringing something fresh to the franchise. It also isolated itself from the rest of the franchise, with its only established characters and connections being mainly confined to New York.




Grounding Rick&#39;s spinoff in the mystery around the established story of him being taken by the CRM in a helicopter with Jadis and introducing minimally explored aspects like the various CRM locations and divisions can rejuvenate the franchise, much like Daryl Dixon&#39;s focus on a new country did. Additionally, the subtle links between the CRM, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, and World Beyond, and Rick&#39;s connection to Fear characters, suggest The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live could facilitate a major franchise crossover. Thus, unlike Dead City, the show can explore new storylines that add to the overall Walking Dead universe, all while in original settings and with new stakes.



The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live premieres on February 25, 2024, on AMC and AMC&#43;.
