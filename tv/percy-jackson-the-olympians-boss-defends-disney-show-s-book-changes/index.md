## Literature Review
Percy Jackson and the Olympians showrunner Jon Steinberg defends the Disney&#43; show&#39;s book changes, explaining why little details were adjusted.




Percy Jackson and the Olympians showrunner Jon Steinberg has opened up about small changes made to the series compared to the books, explaining why certain alterations were made. The Disney&#43; show is a faithful adaptation of Rick Riordan&#39;s novel series of the same name, keeping the larger events from the books intact. However, certain elements like additional scenes and details in different places have made some parts of the show different from the source material.




Speaking with The Direct, Steinberg revealed why some elements of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 differ from the book series. The showrunner explained how the medium of a television series and Riordan treating the show as a &#34;second draft&#34; have remixed some parts of the books in show form. Check out what Steinberg had to say below:


A million changes and you hope that almost all of them are invisible. These are very different mediums, and I think they tell stories differently. And so I think you have to embrace the idea that everything in the book is going to have to find a different form to inhabit in order to be something I&#39;d want to watch on screen.&#34; &#34;So sometimes it&#39;s sequencing, it&#39;s causation, it&#39;s the way set pieces play out is a little different, but it made it work better. Some of it is bigger, some of them, frankly, are things that I think Rick [Riordan] was excited about getting a second go at it. He wrote that book 20 some odd years ago, and you don&#39;t get a second draft... And I think it was exciting and fun for him to sit in conversation about, &#39;Alright, let&#39;s rip the lid off this thing again.&#39;&#34;






 The Percy Jackson TV Show Is A Faithful Adaptation 
          

The TV adaptation of Riordan&#39;s book series has included some details that weren&#39;t present in The Lightning Thief when it was released in 2005. This includes highlighting Grover&#39;s story earlier, with the latest episode hinting at his connection to Pan. Additional scenes were also used to further develop the cast of Percy Jackson, giving audiences a deeper connection to the show&#39;s characters.

These smaller adjustments add to the preexisting source material, broadening what&#39;s on the page and making it suitable for the screen. It&#39;s also a far cry from the 2010 film adaptation of the first book, which featured multiple changes and resulted in a lukewarm reception. By embracing the original story while also making slight adjustments throughout, the TV series can stand on its own while also staying true to the books.




                  37 Biggest Changes Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson Show Makes To The Books   Percy Jackson and the Olympians is being praised for its fidelity to the source material, though that does not mean there are no changes to the books.    

With four episodes left in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the rest of The Lightning Thief is likely to be adapted in a faithful manner. While this may include some alterations to smaller events, the core story seems like it will remain the same. Just how many more changes will occur won&#39;t be revealed until more episodes of the show arrive.
