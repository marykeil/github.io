# 8 Movie Sequels We Are Slowly Giving Up Will Ever Happen


## SUMMARY 


 Sequels can be difficult to make due to scheduling conflicts and the success of the original film. 
 Straight-to-streaming models and uncertain return on investment can prevent sequels from being made. 
 Several beloved movies, such as &#34;The Nice Guys&#34; and &#34;Alita: Battle Angel,&#34; may not get the sequels fans are hoping for due to various obstacles.

## Literature Review

Film sequels can often be stuck in development for many years before their eventual release, but some never make it out of limbo and remain unseen.




When a movie is well-loved, it&#39;s a safe bet that a sequel is not far behind, but no matter how successful a film is, it might never get the follow-up it deserves. Many moving parts have to come together to get a sequel off the ground. Ideally, the original actors and creative team return, but that can be difficult as they might have other projects they&#39;ve signed on to. Additionally, if the first movie works well enough as a stand-alone that a sequel isn&#39;t narratively necessary, there isn&#39;t as much motivation to streamline the production process.
These days, with the prevalence of the straight-to-streaming model, even if a film is shot, edited, and ready for release, there are no guarantees that it will see the light of day. Unless there is a solid chance that the producers and studios will get a significant return on their investment, a sequel can be a risky project. Despite this, it&#39;s always disappointing when a long-awaited sequel doesn&#39;t come to fruition.
            
 
 The 10 Best Movie Sequels Ever Made, According To Ranker 
Most great movies normally have followups but not all sequels end up impressing audiences. So, which are the best ones, according to Ranker?












 








 8  The Nice Guys 2 
The Nice Guys (2016)


 







  The Nice Guys  
R
Mystery
Thriller
Crime



  Release Date    May 20, 2016     Director    Shane Black     Cast    Ryan Gosling , Ty Simpkins , Rachele Brooke Smith , Russell Crowe , Yaya DaCosta , Margaret Qualley , Kim Basinger , Keith David , Matt Bomer , Yvonne Zima     Runtime    116minutes     Writers    Anthony Bagarozzi , Shane Black     Budget    $50 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Ryan Gosling has proved his comedic chops many times over, but it was a wonderful surprise to see how easily Russell Crowe matched him and elevated his performance. The duo was a hilarious pair in The Nice Guys, an action-comedy about a PI (Gosling) and hired muscle (Crowe) who get involved in a twisting crime conspiracy in 1970s Los Angeles. There have been no official confirmations of a sequel entering development, but the film&#39;s popularity has only grown since its initial release. However, the more years pass, the less likely it is that the actors will reunite for another adventure.





 7  Alita 2 
Alita: Battle Angel (2019)
        

  Alita: Battle Angel  
pg-13
Action
Adventure
Romance
Sci-Fi
Thriller



  Release Date    February 14, 2019     Director    Robert Rodriguez     Cast    Rosa Salazar , Christoph Waltz , Lana Condor , Jackie Earle Haley , Eiza Gonzalez , Mahershala Ali     Runtime    122minutes     Writers    Yukito Kishiro , James Cameron , Laeta Kalogridis     Budget    $170 million     Studio(s)    20th Century    


Based on the manga by Yukito Kishiro, Alita: Battle Angel utilized motion-capture technology to integrate the distinct physicality of the characters in the manga. Following the story of Alita (Rosa Salazar) in a distant future full of cyborgs and unbelievable technology, the first film was a challenge to make in its own right. Produced by James Cameron, and using the motion-capture technology he did for the Avatar films, the expensive and time-consuming process has made the sequel difficult to get off the ground. 
Cameron and director, Robert Rodriguez have not shut down all hope for another Alita film, but the timeline remains uncertain. Cameron is focused on the upcoming Avatar sequels, and Alita is not the highest priority on his list. If there is another installment, it&#39;s likely years away and will look very different from the Alita that fans were introduced to in 2019.





 6  Edge Of Tomorrow 2 
Edge of Tomorrow (2014)
        

  Edge of Tomorrow  
PG-13
 Sci-Fi
Action
Thriller
Adventure



  Release Date    June 6, 2014     Director    Doug Liman     Cast    Emily Blunt , Tom Cruise     Runtime    1h 53m     Writers    John-Henry Butterworth , Christopher McQuarrie , Jez Butterworth     Budget    178 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Featuring Tom Cruise in a movie is universally acknowledged as a sure thing at the box office. His latest films, Top Gun: Maverick, the long-awaited sequel to Top Gun, and the newest installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, were both massive hits. However, due to this, it&#39;s unsurprising that he hasn&#39;t found the time for a follow-up to his 2014 film Edge of Tomorrow. Until he&#39;s finished for good with Mission: Impossible, Cruise has a lot of work to do and commitments to make good on before taking on another blockbuster.





 5  Atomic Blonde 2 
Atomic Blonde (2017)
        

  Atomic Blonde  
R
Thriller
Action
Adventure
Mystery



  Release Date    July 26, 2017     Director    David Leitch     Cast    Charlize Theron , Eddie Marsan , John Goodman , James Faulkner , Toby Jones , James McAvoy , Daniel Bernhardt , Sofia Boutella     Runtime    115 minutes     Writers    Kurt Johnstad , Antony Johnston , Sam Hart     Budget    $30 million     Studio(s)    Focus Features    


There&#39;s no question that Hollywood could do with more films featuring strong women in espionage, and Charlize Theron&#39;s Lorraine in Atomic Blonde could go toe to toe with the best of the Bond franchise. However, getting the sequel off the ground has been no easy task. There are rumors that the sequel could come in the next few years and that Theron would reprise her role. To recapture the success of the original film, Theron and director David Leitch would have to come together, but Netflix has many other projects to deal with before focusing on the next Atomic Blonde.





 4  23 Jump Street 
21 Jump Street (2012) &amp; 22 Jump Street (2014)
        

  21 Jump Street  
R



  Release Date    March 14, 2012     Director    Phil Lord , Christopher Miller     Cast    Jonah Hill , Channing Tatum , Brie Larson , Dave Franco , Rob Riggle , DeRay Davis     Runtime    109 minutes     Writers    Michael Bacall     Budget    $42 million     Franchise(s)    21 Jump Street    


Recent updates have hinted that 23 Jump Street will never happen despite the consistently strong popularity of the first two films. The first two films came out in quick succession, and now, ten years after the last installment, 22 Jump Street, there&#39;s little chance that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill will return for a hilarious and action-packed conclusion to their franchise. While this is disappointing, it does make sense as the first two films had a well-rounded arc, and any continuation of the story would be for the enjoyment of audiences, not a necessity for the films.





 3  Heat 2 
Heat (1995)
        

  Heat  
R



  Release Date    December 15, 1995     Director    Michael Mann     Cast    Al Pacino , Robert De Niro , Val Kilmer , Jon Voight , Tom Sizemore , Diane Venora     Runtime    170 minutes     Writers    Michael Mann     Budget    $60 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Michael Mann&#39;s iconic film, Heat, starring Robert De Niro as the criminal mastermind Neil McCauley alongside Al Pacino as the police lieutenant trying to stop him. It&#39;s gone down in history as a fantastic film full of incredible twists, and fans have been on the edge of their seats for a sequel since. In a strange turn of events, Mann published a book, Heat 2, as a follow-up instead of making a movie. However, though Mann has indicated that a movie isn&#39;t out of the question, he has been taking his time developing the project.





 2  Before Sunrise 4 
Before Sunrise (1995), Before Sunset (2004), Before Midnight (2013)
        

 Before Sunrise 
R



  Release Date    January 27, 1995     Director    Richard Linklater     Cast    Ethan Hawke , Julie Delpy , Andrea Eckert , Hanno PÃ¶schl , Karl Bruckschwaiger , Tex Rubinowitz     Runtime    105 minutes     Writers    Richard Linklater , Kim Krizan    


Richard Linklater&#39;s Before trilogy was a test of patience for those waiting for the first three films to come out. As with many of his films, he played with time and shot the movies at nine-year intervals in chronicling the relationship between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy). Both Linklater and Delpy feel that the book is closed on the stories that can be mined from Jesse and Celine, but Hawke has indicated he remains optimistic. Either way, a little too much time has passed for there to be another installment of the Before films.
At the end of Before Midnight, Jesse and Celine were grappling with what it meant to grow older, and how that impacted their relationship. Although it would be interesting to see how the couple dealt with these issues even later in life, and seeing actors growing old is an underutilized story device, the fourth film has the potential to be repetitive. Additionally, Linklater and the actors all have their own projects, with Hawke turning to producing in recent years.

 1  Crazy Rich Asians 2 
Crazy Rich Asians (2018)


 







  Crazy Rich Asians  
PG-13



  Release Date    August 15, 2018     Director    Jon M. Chu     Cast    Gemma Chan , Chris Pang , Awkwafina , Jimmy O. Yang , Michelle Yeoh , Ken Jeong , Henry Golding , Sonoya Mizuno , Jing Lusi , Constance Wu     Runtime    121minutes     Writers    Pete Chiarelli , Adele Lim     Budget    $30 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


There are many reasons why making another Crazy Rich Asians film would make sense. Michelle Yeoh has skyrocketed to fame after her Oscar win for Everything Everywhere All At Once, and there are several other books in the series that the film was based on. However, finding the right writing team to adapt the next novel seems to be a roadblock, as there has been no confirmation that the sequel is officially coming. Fans of the first movie might still hold out hope, but with production not yet in sight, there&#39;s no certainty.
