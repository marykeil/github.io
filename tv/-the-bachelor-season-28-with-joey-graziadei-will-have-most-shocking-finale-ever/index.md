## Literature Review

Joey Graziadei teases that The Bachelor season 28 will have a shocking finale that no one will see coming and encourages viewers to watch.




The Bachelor franchise is no stranger to shocking endings, and the upcoming season with Joey Graziadei will be no different, thanks to Joey letting it slip that the finale will be a big shock to the audience. Joey is the star of The Bachelor season 28 and is also most known for his runner-up role in The Bachelorette season 20, which starred Charity Lawson as the lead. Joey is also a tennis pro who currently lives in Koloa, Hawaii, but is originally from Collegeville, Pennsylvania. While he was heartbroken when he was not chosen by Charity, he believes he did everything he could and is ready to move on.




In an interview with Extra, Joey teased The Bachelor season 28 and hinted at a surprising end to his journey. He said, &#34;Obviously, people have seen me very emotional. I think it&#39;s just one of those things that it was an ending that I just didn&#39;t expect. I think it&#39;s an ending that no one is going to expect -- again, something that&#39;s going to be worth tuning in for.&#34;


 

Joey went on to explain that each part of the season will come with a surprise or a reason to tune in to the show. Joey&#39;s season of The Bachelor is also being called &#34;the most romantic&#34; season yet, which is saying something since the Bachelor franchise has been around for over two decades.


 Lea Cayanan&#39;s Mystery Envelope Will Be A &#34;Game Changer&#34; 
          




During Charity Lawson&#39;s &#34;After The Final Rose&#34; special, host Jesse Palmer gave contestant Lea Cayanan an envelope that she was not to open until The Bachelor season 28 premiere and told her it would be a major help for her journey to love with Joey. Lea was the first contestant to get to meet Joey, and this envelope is going to be a &#34;game changer,&#34; according to the Bachelor lead. “I can’t tell you what was in it, but I can tell you it is a game changer, it changes the show for sure...It is going to be worth tuning in and seeing what is on that note.”

The Bachelor is known for having many twists and turns, and for trying to keep things new and exciting for its viewers. From enthralling finales to games that have raised eyebrows, viewers have seen a lot over the last two decades that the Bachelor franchise has been around. This card that was given at the end of The Bachelorette season 20 is promising to surprise and shock once again. Thankfully, viewers will not have to wait too much longer to find out what the card says, since it will be opened during The Bachelor season 28 premiere.

While the secret envelope is one major twist to the show for fans to look forward to, there are more firsts coming up as well. During The Bachelor season 28, there will be a pair of sisters, Allison and Lauren Hollinger, who will both be competing for Joey&#39;s heart. When siblings are both going after the same person, it is understandable that tension will be created and drama could arise. When Joey was asked what he thought about having the sisters on The Bachelor, he said, &#34;I just knew that I would need to tread very carefully...and never pit them against each other.”

Joey will also be meeting 30 other women from across the country, who will all be trying their hardest to stand out from the rest. Joey has promised that there will be more than one tennis pun on the first night, given his connection to the sport. He has admitted he&#39;s feeling nervous, but he is ready to fall in love and give this everything he has got. It&#39;ll be exciting to see Joey find someone and build a strong, lasting connection with them. He has been a fan-favorite since he appeared in Charity&#39;s Bachelorette season because he is easy to root for.




The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
