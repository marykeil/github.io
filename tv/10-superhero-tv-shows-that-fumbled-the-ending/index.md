# 10 Superhero TV Shows That Fumbled The Ending


## SUMMARY 


 Several superhero shows present wonderful endings, but a few can&#39;t quite stick the landing. 
 Some shows end in a disappointing way due to questionable creative decisions that don&#39;t feel in line with the established characters and worlds. 
 Other endings are the result of premature cancelations, leaving major cliffhangers unresolved.

## Literature Review

Marvel and DC have both faced their fair share of complications with TV shows, but these 10 had the worst conclusions for a number of reasons.




Superhero shows are difficult to conclude, in part because of the nature of network television, with unpredictable cancelations and waxing and waning viewership; several Marvel, DC, and other-branded shows have fallen victim to these difficulties. Marvel has had an especially interesting TV history, with the franchise&#39;s intellectual property changing hands several times only to be swept up by Disney&#43;. DC has similarly appeared on several different networks, and, as they&#39;re a bit beholden to those networks, continuity can prove difficult.
Marvel is making interesting choices, currently trying to integrate several of the Netflix Marvel TV shows that were previously canceled into the MCU Timeline, but disappointing endings for some of those shows may prove difficult to recover from. Perhaps even more than Marvel, DC has had a complex history, with finding success in the long-running but now-concluded Arrowverse. Amid this significant history for the two, alongside some other bids for superhero TV shows, 10 stand out as having particularly poor endings.
            
 
 10 Superhero TV Shows That Nailed The Ending 
Writing a good superhero TV show is tough, and sticking the landing is even harder. However, these ten shows ended on incredibly high notes.












 








 10  Luke Cage Ended On A Controversial Cliffhanger 
Luke Cage Ran For Two Seasons (2016â€“2018)
        

Luke Cage was one of several Marvel shows to be originally housed on Netflix, and the second season ends on an unfortunately unresolved cliffhanger. Largely seen as the biggest transgression of the show, the Luke Cage season 2 ending saw Luke become the new head Harlem&#39;s Paradise, the perch from which he&#39;ll be able to oversee all crime in Harlem. While it&#39;s somewhat understandable and interesting that he chooses to try to control crime instead of fully stopping it (something regularly proven almost impossible), ending his whole story as a crime boss doesn&#39;t sit well with everyone.





 9  Hulu Changed Helstrom Too Much 
Helstrom Ran For One Season (2020)
        

Helstrom was a Hulu adaptation of the Marvel Comics character of the same name and followed siblings Damion and Ana Helstrom (spelled Hellstrom in the comics), although with several changes to their comic book characterizations. To make matters worse, the show was exceptionally dark, with an even more bleak finale. There were deaths, betrayals and characters losing their minds, which was a lot for a single episode. Since the series was canceled after season 1, Helstrom wasn&#39;t able to grow or improve, leaving it to end on a disappointing note.





 8  Secret Invasion Seemed To Switch Genres 
Secret Invasion Ran For One Season (2023)


 







Secret Invasion was set to be an exciting installation in the MCU Phase 5 timeline. It would see Samuel L. Jackson&#39;s Agent Nick Fury after the events of Thanos&#39; invasion and the Snap, both of which had clearly rattled him. The series was also an interesting one because Nick Fury had often been a fairly elusive, secretive figure, and it was more than time for him to have his own series. Despite all of that, perhaps due to issues behind the scenes, Secret Invasion was ultimately lackluster and did a disservice to the character.
Coming on the heels of the major twist that Nick Fury was being impersonated by a Skrull in Spider-Man: No Way Home, the show focused on the revelation that the Skrull had been infiltrating Earth much more than was previously realized. To do that, the show revealed that several characters had secretly been replaced by Skrulls, including James &#34;Rhodey&#34; Rhodes and Agent Ross. No larger reveals occurred, though, and Secret Invasion&#39;s ending ultimately undercut the importance of Maria Hill&#39;s death and didn&#39;t follow through on the promises to bring something new to the MCU.





 7  Agent Carter Never Got Real Closure 
Agent Carter Ran For Two Seasons (2015-2016)


 







Agent Carter was an exciting opportunity for Marvel to further develop a character who had shown so much promise in Captain America: The First Avenger. Peggy Carter was a fascinating character, partly because she held her own as a woman amid a crowd of male soldiers during World War II. She also proved to be much more than just Steve Rogers&#39;, a.k.a. Captain America, love interest, which is always a bonus for superhero content that can, at times, fall back on tropes. Despite that, the show suffered from low viewership, and Agent Carter was canceled after two seasons.
The MCU has worked to add to Peggy Carter&#39;s story in &#34;What If...?&#34; and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.


The root of the cancelation is somewhat unclear, with Hayley Atwell having suggested that Marvel wanted to continue the show but that ABC, on which the show premiered, decided to end it. Like many canceled shows on this list, Agent Carter concluded with a bit of a cliffhanger, although Marvel&#39;s Agents of SHIELD gave an update on the characters of the show. Ultimately, the conclusion of this show is a terrible shame; Peggy Carter remains a great character in the MCU, and her story is still an interesting one.





 6  Adam West&#39;s Batman Couldn&#39;t Keep Its Momentum 
Batman Ran For Three Seasons (1966-1968)
        

The oldest show on the list, Adam West&#39;s Batman was released in 1966, and, while undoubtedly a classic, it didn&#39;t stick the landing. Although initially a success, the series&#39; ratings fell, and Batman was canceled after two years. This was a shame because the show had seemed to be on solid ground; it had even led to a movie, Batman (1966), with lines that are still referenced today. Even so, the show&#39;s redundant, unoriginal plot lines later in the series and the rush to push out more content led to a cancelation and a disappointing end to the show.





 5  Heroes Never Lived Up To Season 1 
Heroes Ran For Four Seasons (2006-2010)
        

Predating much of the modern popular superhero content, particularly of the MCU, which kicked off with Iron Man in 2008, Heroes premiered in 2006 and was a groundbreaking TV show at the time. For four seasons, the show followed the stories of seemingly ordinary people who ultimately discover that they have various powers; particularly, the range of powers presented was an interesting aspect of the show. However, ratings for Heroes declined, as did the story, which grew more convoluted. Heroes ended up being canceled twice. The second time was after an attempt at a revival, Heroes Reborn, which lasted only one season.





 4  The New Adventures of Superman Ended Earlier Than Planned 
Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman Ran For Four Seasons (1993-1997)
        

Perhaps due to the 90s flair, Lois &amp; Clark was quirky from the start; even the show&#39;s title was a play on words, which set the tone for the series. Lois &amp; Clark followed Clark Kent, a.k.a. Superman, and Lois Lane, a staple of the Superman franchise, and included classic villain Lex Luthor, all of which was promising. The show was initially a success, like many on this list, but was abruptly canceled by ABC. The final episode, which wasn&#39;t intended to be the Lois and Clark series finale, somewhat oddly ended with the couple receiving a baby, which was sadly never developed further.





 3  Moon Knight Leaves Its Ending Open 
Moon Knight Currently Has One Season (2022), Though Another Is Possible


 







Moon Knight was an interesting addition to the MCU&#39;s Disney&#43; TV shows because of its shift in tone. The series had a bit of an uphill battle, given its seriously violent themes. While many of the Netflix Marvel shows were equally violent, such as Daredevil, and although Marvel movies like Deadpool are similarly bloody, the Disney&#43; shows (and much of the MCU) hadn&#39;t matched that type of content up until that point. Perhaps due to Oscar Isaac&#39;s masterful portrayal of opposing personalities, though, the show was largely a success.
            
 
 Moon Knight&#39;s Marc Spector and Alters Explained 
Marc Spector&#39;s DID played a key role in Marvel&#39;s MCU Moon Knight. Here&#39;s the difference between Moon Knight&#39;s five alters in both the comics and show.



One issue with Moon Knight was its confusing ending, which included a jump back to the psychiatric hospital and a final scene in Marc/Steven&#39;s apartment, showing them tied once again to the bed. The series, although thrilling, was at times difficult to keep up with because of the nature of the character, who struggles for most of the series to understand what is happening. Although befitting of Moon Knight, it left the Moon Knight&#39;s finale on shaky ground. Of course, this may be revisited; while season 2 isn&#39;t confirmed, the post-credits scene with Jake Lockley left the door open.





 2  Runaways Never Got To Address Its Cliffhanger 
Marvel&#39;s Runaways Ran For Three Seasons (2017-2019)
        

Marvel&#39;s Runaways started from an interesting premise stemming from the comics of the same name. Six teenagers discover that their parents are villains and, in response, decide to become heroes, which sets up an exciting tension and unique plot line. Despite that, viewers were fairly split on the success of the show, and, as were several shows on this list, the show was ultimately canceled. Runaways&#39; finale concluded with a cliffhanger, in part with the intention of leaving the door open for future stories, but many felt that the series simply tried to do too much in the final episodes.





 1  Inhumans Didn&#39;t Live Up To The Hype 
Inhumans Ran For One Season (2017)
        

Marvel&#39;s Inhumans had a fascinating start, releasing in IMAX theaters as a TV show. This signaled that it was expected to be a hit, but the show never really got off the ground. It wasn&#39;t very well-received, and it was canceled after just one season, with the Inhumans ending leaving several questions on the table. Unlike other shows on this list that were canceled due to studio negotiations or issues unrelated to quality, Inhumans seems to have been canceled because of the content, but the contrast between expectation and outcome shows just how difficult endings for Marvel and DC can be.
