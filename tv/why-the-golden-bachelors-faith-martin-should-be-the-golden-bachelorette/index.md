## Literature Review
Faith Martin had a great relationship with Gerry Turner on The Golden Bachelor but they weren&#39;t meant to be. Could she become The Golden Bachelorette?




Faith Martin and Gerry Turner weren&#39;t meant to be on The Golden Bachelor, but there&#39;s a chance Faith could become The Golden Bachelorette. Viewers were introduced to Faith during the first episode of The Golden Bachelor season 1. Gerry was immediately taken by Faith, even talking about how beautiful he thought she was. After getting a chance to speak to all the women, Gerry decided to give Faith the first impression rose. He was excited about his relationship with Faith and getting to know her more throughout the season. Their relationship took a backseat for a few episodes, but Gerry restored &#34;faith&#34; in her after their final date before hometowns.




Gerry reassured Faith during their hometown date that their relationship was solid; he even said &#34;I love you&#34; to her in front of her entire family. She was so happy to be in her hometown of Benton City, Washington, surrounded by her family and the man she loved. However, all that changed when Gerry chose Theresa Nist over Faith during Thursday&#39;s rose ceremony. Both Gerry and Faith were heartbroken, but Gerry simply had a better connection with Theresa and Leslie Fhima. Now that Faith is single, this is her chance to be The Golden Bachelorette if ABC films one.

 Faith Has A Good Family 

 




Viewers got a glimpse inside Faith&#39;s family and who they are as people. Hailing from Benton City, Washington, Faith seemingly has a great family who loves and supports her. During The Golden Bachelor hometown dates, viewers got to meet Faith&#39;s two sons, Nick and Brenden, her grandkids, her friend Joan, and Faith&#39;s older sister Beth. Her whole family was so excited to see her after she&#39;d been away for so long filming the show but were also happy to see her and Gerry had made a connection. When Gerry revealed that Faith got the first impression rose, every single one of her family members jumped for joy. They couldn&#39;t have been happier for Faith.

Even though Gerry and Faith didn&#39;t end up together, her family will still be supportive of her. Their support will be much needed as well if Faith becomes The Golden Bachelorette. There is no doubt that they will back her through the whole process and be there for her when she needs it. Faith&#39;s family clearly loves her and only wants what&#39;s best for her. If becoming The Golden Bachelorette is a possibility for Faith, they will 100% support her decision. The Bachelor franchise loves a supportive family, so Faith&#39;s casting would be ideal for the show.






 She Fell In Love With Gerry, Only For Him To Break Her Heart 
         

Gerry seemed head-over-heels for Faith after they met on night 1 of The Golden Bachelor. He was completely taken by Faith from the moment she stepped off that motorcycle in front of The Bachelor mansion. Gerry was very complimentary of her beauty and enjoyed the song she sang on her guitar for him. Faith was a front-runner for Gerry from the first night, but he developed deeper connections with Theresa and Leslie throughout the season. While Gerry didn&#39;t mean to break her heart, he led Faith on. He did tell her he loved her in front of her family during Faith&#39;s hometown date.

Viewers love a Bachelorette or Bachelor lead who left their season heartbroken. Even though Faith wasn&#39;t shown much in the earlier episodes, Gerry always had a soft spot for Faith. Usually, the woman who wins isn&#39;t so obvious, so when Gerry sent Faith home, it was a shock not only to the audience but to Faith as well. Faith&#39;s elimination is heartbreaking, and viewers want to see Faith find her fairytale ending. Out of everyone in the cast, Faith will likely be the front-runner for The Golden Bachelorette for this reason.






 Faith Has An Interesting Backstory 
          

Faith&#39;s life before The Golden Bachelor is interesting, and many viewers may want to hear more about it on a season of The Golden Bachelorette. Before joining the show, Faith was married to her ex-husband for 21 years before they split in 2005. Despite their split, the two did have two sons who they were able to co-parent together nicely. However, a year before Faith filmed The Golden Bachelor, her ex-husband had passed away. Even though they were not together anymore and had broken up almost 20 years ago, Faith was still mourning the loss.

Her backstory is perfect for a potential Bachelorette, especially for the rumored The Golden Bachelorette. What fans love about The Golden Bachelor is their discussion about grief and finding love after it. Faith not only had to mourn the loss of her ex, but she also mourned the loss of her marriage. In the last 18 years, Faith has been through a lot in her former relationship, and now she was just dumped on national television. It&#39;s time for Faith to finally find a man who will love and appreciate her no matter what.






 She Won The First Impression Rose 
          

Faith also has a leg up as the lead of The Golden Bachelorette since she won Gerry&#39;s first impression rose. Usually, the woman who wins the first impression rose makes it far enough along in the process to develop strong feelings for the lead. The audience grows to love them and their relationship with the lead, so when the lead sends them home, it&#39;s heartbreaking. The first impression rose winner is typically well-known by the audience since the show gives them more of a chance to open up, so it makes sense for them to be the next lead.

Faith was able to do that towards the end of her time on The Golden Bachelor. The audience got to know more about Faith during her last one-on-one date with Gerry and during her hometown date last week. Even though Faith had a slow start, the viewers got to see Faith as a kind and sweet person who deserves love. If ABC does decide to air a Golden Bachelorette season, all signs are pointing to Faith.






The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
