## Literature Review
Jasmine Pineda reminds 90 Day Fiancé viewers about Gino Palazzolo’s potato peeler incident by sharing a new funny video on social media.




Jasmine Pineda from 90 Day Fiancé once again made fun of Gino Palazzolo’s potato peeler meltdown on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. The Panamanian reality star has faced many challenging moments with her American beau over the last two years. However, nothing has topped the crazy fight Jasmine had with Gino about cutting vegetables. During 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, Gino refused to cook a meal with Jasmine because she didn’t have the proper equipment in her kitchen to peel potatoes. He argued with her like a child, making the benign situation a big deal.




In June 2023, Jasmine threw shade on Gino while sharing a YouTube tutorial titled “How to peel a peel without the proper equipment.” However, she didn’t stop there and continued to make fun of the incident. Recently, Jasmine roasted Gino again and ridiculed his below-average culinary skills.


 

Jasmine posted a video and wrote, “How long it will take Gino to peel a potato without proper equipment.” The mom of two used an age filter to show herself rapidly aging as she waited for her beau to peel the potatoes. She jokingly said, “Please, I’m starving. I need to eat.”

The potato peeler incident isn’t the only chaotic moment Jasmine and Gino have shared over the years. In 2021, the two appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5 and turned their relationship into an engagement. At the time, they fought after Gino leaked Jasmine’s private photos to one of his former partners. In 2023, the roles are reversed as Jasmine becomes the main villain in the relationship. She hung out with her ex-boyfriend, lied, and even allegedly cheated on Gino. It seemed like the couple would break up after such turmoil, but they stayed together. They are now in 90 Day Fiancé season 10, hoping to tie the knot.

It’s hilarious to see Jasmine cash in on her viral moment by turning it into a social media video. Jasmine’s antics on the show are hilarious, and she knows that. Therefore, it makes sense that she’s using her reality TV moments and turning them into content for her followers. Jasmine lost her teaching job while filming the previous season of the spin-off. She has been working hard to build a brand around her name and make the best out of her reality TV appearance. She’s likely joking about past incidents because it gets her views and social media engagement.




Jasmine has been trying to become an Instagram influencer like many other 90 Day Fiancé stars. However, she must evolve and stop bringing her past incidents into the public eye. Cast members like Loren Brovarnik and Darcey Silva have improved their social media image by building a niche. Jasmine needs to figure out the same about herself and focus on content that leaves a lasting impact on her followers. She has the skills to be an entertainer, an inspiring figure, a fashion enthusiast, a body-positive influencer, and much more. All the 90 Day Fiancé star needs to do is focus on one thing and rise above the past scandals.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
