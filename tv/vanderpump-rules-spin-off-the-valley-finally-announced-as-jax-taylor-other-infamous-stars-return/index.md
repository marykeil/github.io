## Literature Review

Bravo is gearing up to debut a spin-off of the hit reality show Vanderpump Rules called The Valley, which will debut with a VPR crossover episode.




The Valley, a spin-off of the hit Bravo reality series Vanderpump Rules, has officially been announced, and some former infamous cast members are ready to make their return to the small screen. In 2023, Vanderpump Rules season 10 became the most talked-about reality show after it came out that Tom Sandoval cheated on his girlfriend Ariana Madix with their Vanderpump Rules co-star Raquel Leviss. Tom and Ariana are obviously no longer together--and neither are Tom and Raquel. Ariana has left Tom behind and stepped into the spotlight by competing on Dancing With The Stars, releasing a cocktail book, securing brand deals and much more.




Ahead of the Vanderpump Rules season 11 premiere, Bravo has finally announced that The Valley will be debuting soon on the network. This comes after numerous rumors appeared online about a spin-off starring some former Vanderpump Rules stars.


 

Bravo released a preview video confirming the cast, including Jax Taylor, Kristen Doute, Brittany Cartwright, Luke Broderick, Danny and Nia Booko, Jason and Janet Caperna, and Jesse and Michelle Lally. Jasmine Goode and Zack Wickham will also appear on The Valley as friends of the series regulars. A premiere date is not known at this time, but The Valley will debut sometime in the spring.

The Valley teaser video doesn&#39;t actually reveal any footage from the Vanderpump Rules spin-off. It starts off with Jax driving down a pleasant neighborhood and waving to his neighbors. Danny and Nia are sitting in their front yard with a kiddie pool in front of them. Michelle and Jesse are cleaning up the fallen leaves in their yard. Janet and Jason open up the back of their car to reveal a ton of balloons. Kristen and Luke are shown taking out the trash, which could be a metaphor for the drama that&#39;s about to unfold. Finally, Brittany yells at Jax to mow the lawn as it&#39;s revealed that he&#39;s been driving a child&#39;s motorized car.

While a premiere date hasn&#39;t been announced just yet, Vanderpump Rules producer Alex Baskin just revealed exactly how The Valley will make its debut on Bravo. There will be a crossover between the two shows during Vanderpump Rules season 11, episode 8, featuring Jax and Tom Sandoval. &#34;It&#39;s Jax getting in a few words with Tom; he&#39;s been waiting for this moment. And then he heads over the hill and we&#39;re in a new series,&#34; Alex explained to Deadline. Throughout the season, there will be additional crossovers &#34;in both directions.&#34;




The way Vanderpump Rules will lead into The Valley series premiere will make for great television, ensuring that viewers stick around to watch the spin-off. In fact, this is right out of the Vanderpump playbook since Bravo launched Vanderpump Rules right after The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in a very similar fashion. Vanderpump Rules season 10 didn&#39;t lack for drama, especially once Scandoval broke wide open. Now there&#39;s a chance for two shows to keep fans entertained. Some of the cast members on The Valley were fired by Bravo, so it&#39;ll be interesting to see if their return will cause drama for all the right reasons or all the wrong reasons.



Vanderpump Rules season 11 premieres January 30 at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
