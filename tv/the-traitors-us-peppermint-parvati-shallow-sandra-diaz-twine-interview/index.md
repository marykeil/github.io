## Literature Review

The Traitors US stars Peppermint, Parvati Shallow, &amp; Sandra Diaz-Twine opened up about their experiences in the series, detailing even the toughest.




The Traitors US season 2’s cast, including Survivor legends Sandra Diaz-Twine and Parvati Shallow, along with RuPaul’s Drag Race star Peppermint, chatted with Screen Rant about their time on the show and shared all the juicy details. For stars like Peppermint, coming into a series where there were groups of reality TV stars who had pre-existing relationships was difficult, but she understood it was even tougher for those who actually held relationships with other reality TV personalities. For those hoping to come into a fresh environment, like Survivor’s Parvati and Sandra, seeing people from their past experiences who offered up some potential drama before the show even started was difficult.




As The Traitors US season 2 got started, the cast members all got to know each other on a surface level, working to keep themselves neutral as the traitors were selected. Big Brother’s Dan Gheesling and Married To Medicine’s Phaedra Parks were chosen as the initial traitors and decided to recruit Parvati for their team, knowing she was a cut-throat player on Survivor. While Parvati was already feeling some trepidation coming into the game with Sandra, knowing they had a bit of animosity due to their interactions in their original show together, becoming a traitor was both overwhelming and exhilarating.

Parvati may have been a traitor, but her relationship with Sandra was something she wanted to address quickly upon getting into the game, hoping to clear things up so there was no issue between them. Sandra, too, was interested in extending an olive branch, but when the pair found it difficult to talk to one another, Peppermint stepped in. The trio forged a bond on The Traitors US season 2 that was interesting to watch, and in chatting with them, their rapport was easy to see. Although Peppermint may not have been on The Traitors US for long, her impact on the series was definitely lasting.




Screen Rant: Great to meet you all, and thanks so much for taking the time to chat! To start, if you could go back into the season from the beginning – would you want to go in as a traitor or a faithful? 


Sandra Diaz-Twine: I would love to be a traitor.
Parvati Shallow: I think I would be a faithful.


Screen Rant: Interesting! Why would you want to be a faithful? 


Parvati Shallow: Because I have a really hard time holding a lie – like a really hard time. And bonding with people while lying is very difficult, so I think as a faithful I could go in and create really solid alliances, and then actually think straight…maybe?
Peppermint: You know, if I have the chance to go back again, I would like to be a traitor. I guess if history had to repeat itself, I probably would want to be a faithful because I can’t imagine the cheers and the like, celebration of having eliminated me as a traitor on that first episode. Like if I’d actually been a traitor, then I would’ve been like, ‘ugh, this is too much for me,’ so, I think if I’m going back to 2023 to film this again, then I’d probably want to be a faithful. But next time I come into that house? Watch out.





Screen Rant: I definitely will. You guys are from very different franchises – who from your franchise would you like to see on an upcoming season of The Traitors? 


Sandra Diaz-Twine: I would like to see Kelley Wentworth [from Survivor seasons 29, 31, &amp; 38].
Parvati Shallow: And I would like to see Tyson [Apostol, the winner of Survivor season 27].
Peppermint: I’m going to do a deep cut for the people who are fans of Drag Race and go with Tammie Brown.


Screen Rant: Incredible answers, I love it. Peppermint, moving into the game itself – what was the most unexpectedly difficult part of The Traitors for you?


Peppermint: [sighs] It was, you know…the whole thing is difficult, the preparing to come to the castle, having to have those first conversations and meeting everyone for the first time. Being one of the people who has never met anyone else in the cast or worked with them before was difficult. The challenges, the missions were definitely difficult – and I was like, oh my gosh, you know, I don’t like to swim and get wet…and you have to! So, there’s some overcoming of some personal little barriers.
I think the thing that was the toughest for me, if I’m being honest, is just the feeling of being ganged up on and rejected all in one thing is immediate – without the opportunity for people to actually get to know you, too. People holding more reverence and importance in a lie about who you are was so freakishly true to life with how a lot of transgender people experience the world that it was like, whoa. That was really disorienting for me, to be honest with you.





Screen Rant: It’s a rough situation to put yourself into without knowing ahead of time. You spoke about having pre-existing relationships, now obviously Parvati and Sandra, you two had a pre-existing relationship coming into the show. How did it feel seeing each other? 


Sandra Diaz-Twine: We didn’t know who was going to be there [when we got to the castle], but when I saw Parvati my smile turned into a frown. Peppermint was in the car with me and I was like, ‘oh no, not Parvati’, you know. I can’t just focus on the game and getting to know people, now I have to deal with my issues with Parvati. [laughs] Parvati, your turn.
Parvati Shallow: Yeah, I felt the same way – I was already nervous going into the game because I didn’t know anybody either, and these are people from all different walks of reality television, many of them who had existing relationships with one another already, so…I was like, I’m starting from scratch her and need to build relationships immediately, be super friendly and connect with people. Then I saw Sandra and I was like, great. The only person from Survivor who I could’ve had as an ally is someone who I don’t know if I can trust and don’t know if she hates me, or what. So there was already just built-in drama from day one, which just ratcheted up my stress from the first moment that we got there.
Yeah, the game was so intense from the very first second. It was like, they couldn’t have put Ethan [Zohn, winner of Survivor season 3] on or somebody who’s like, a buddy? I couldn’t just have a buddy to hang out with? But it was good, because once Peppermint brought Sandra and I together, we did have a good moment where we connected and were like, alright – let’s let it go, and we’re good now.
Peppermint: It felt like reality TV history, for sure, the two of you all coming together. I was like oh, now I can relax. I felt like I was in a feud!
Parvati Shallow: It was so stressful!
