  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives star Kody Brown has been dealing with issues in his family, but his lies have finally caught up to him. Check out Kody&rsquo;s biggest lies.</p>
<p>Sister Wives star Kody Brown has been doing his best to speak his truth throughout the most recent season, but the lies he’s told throughout the years have followed him and ruined some of his most important relationships. While Kody’s life has changed tremendously in the last several years, he’s been living unsustainably for more than a decade. After marrying Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, and Christine Brown in the early 1990s, Kody’s life reached a point of stability that the entire family was comfortable with. He seemed happy with his large family, but things took a turn when he brought Robyn Brown, his fourth wife, into the picture.
After marrying Robyn in 2014, Kody’s marriages began to suffer and the lies he’d been building the Brown family’s life upon seemed to start crumbling. From lying about his feelings for his wives to the circumstances surrounding their family’s living situations and many more situations in between, it became clear that Kody couldn’t handle the pressure of being the patriarch of the family. While Kody hasn’t always been dishonest about the things in his life, it’s become apparent that some of his biggest lies have been what’s pushed his family to crumble before his eyes.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  Kody&rsquo;s Claimed Sister Wives Doesn&rsquo;t Compensate The Family
He Has Since Shared He Does Make Money On The Show</p>
<p>During some of the early episodes of Sister Wives season 18, Kody was quick to comment on Janelle’s financial status, sharing that he felt she was likely more financially stable than she was letting on because of the “assets” she had to her name. Kody, who had shared in the past that Sister Wives didn’t compensate him or the rest of the family for appearing on the series, then shared that the show pays them well for documenting their lives. Untangling his own lie, Kody made it clear he’d been speaking out of turn when he said the series didn’t compensate the family for their work.</p>
<p>7  Kody Convinced Said He Was In Danger To Move Away From Utah
He Revealed He Simply Wanted To Live In Las Vegas</p>
<p>Early on in the run of Sister Wives, the Brown family moved from Utah to Las Vegas, Nevada as they were dealing with some very severe issues according to Kody. The patriarch of the family moved his wives and children away quickly, explaining they were in danger and dealing with some extreme legal issues surrounding their polygamous lifestyle. While the wives and children all believed Kody, it came out later that he’d been lying about the reasons as to why they had to move away from their home. Kody explained that they left because he’d wanted to, and that the legal situation had been highly amplified.</p>
<p>6  Kody Claimed His Doctors Had Rules For Him During COVID-19
He Later Shared He Made Up His Own Rules</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brown family had a difficult time figuring out how to make their gatherings safe and avoid transmitting the virus if anyone had been exposed to it. On top of the government guidelines, Kody shared that his doctor had given him a list of rules he had to follow to keep himself healthy, sharing them with the family and explaining he was taking extra precautions. Kody later revealed that his doctor hadn’t given him the rules, and he’d actually written them all out himself with no real understanding of the virus or the way it was transmitted.</p>
<p>5  Kody Revealed He&rsquo;d Researched Custody Laws Before Christine&rsquo;s Move
He Later Explained He Didn&rsquo;t Know If They Were True</p>
<p>During Sister Wives season 17, Kody and Christine were at an impasse. It was clear that she was looking to leave Kody and was planning to take the couple’s youngest daughter, Truely, to Salt Lake City, Utah with her. Christine wanted to be closer to the rest of her kids and her family as a whole, so she made the leap and announced her move. Kody, hurt that Christine was trying to move their child, shared that custody laws would prevent Christine from taking her away. With the legal rights Kody had to Truely being minimal, he later revealed he made the custody laws up to scare his ex-wife.</p>
<p>4  Kody Told Robyn He Loved His Other Wives
He&rsquo;s Since Shared He Never Loved Any Of Them</p>
<p>Early on in their relationship, Robyn shared with Kody that she wanted to be involved in plural marriage. She was interested in joining the Brown family because of her feelings for Kody, but also because she was deeply interested in being with a plural family for the rest of her life. The way Kody talked about his wives, Robyn later revealed, was one of the things that sold her on him as a husband. Robyn shared Kody was so loving that she couldn’t pass him by. During Sister Wives season 18, Kody revealed that he never actually loved any of his original wives, but was able to fake it.</p>
<p>3  Kody Claimed He&rsquo;s Reached Out To His &amp; Janelle&rsquo;s Sons
He Later Shared He Wouldn&rsquo;t Speak To Them Until Spoken To</p>
<p>During an early episode of Sister Wives season 18, Janelle and Kody rehashed an issue that they were facing with between Kody and their kids, who began to ignore him after he temporarily wrote them off for disobeying his COVID-19 protocols. Kody felt that he shouldn’t have to be the bigger person for their sons while Janelle felt he should speak up. Kody lied to Janelle and said he’d spoken to their sons, or at least reached out in the past to no avail. It came out later that he actually hadn’t, and Janelle’s sons were telling the truth when they said Kody had been silent with them.</p>
<p>2  Kody Said Christine Chased Him &amp; &ldquo;Begged&rdquo; For Marriage
He&rsquo;s Admitted In The Past He Perused Her</p>
<p>When Kody and Christine’s marriage began to fall apart, he started to say things about the early days of their relationship that colored her in a bad light. From telling lies about the way Christine treated him to sharing that she initially chased him and “begged” for marriage, so he added her into his family as a wife because he pitied her, Kody’s stories have been all over the place. He’s contradicted himself several times, especially when it comes to the fact that he pursued Christine initially, as documented by several people in their lives.</p>
<p>1  Kody Assured Meri He Loved Her Through The Years
He&rsquo;s Since Shared He Was Faking Loving Meri</p>
<p>After over 30 years with his first wife Meri, Kody’s feelings have twisted and morphed. Especially after Meri’s catfishing scandal, many realized that it didn’t at all appear that Kody had romantic feelings for Meri. He was hurt by her scandal, but ultimately felt betrayed and overwhelmed, telling Meri he would get through it and continue to try to heal their marriage. Despite knowing that he wasn’t happy with the way things were going, Kody reassured Meri he still loved her. During Sister Wives: One On One for the most recent season, Kody dropped the bombshell that he’d actually never loved Meri, and had been faking it the whole time.</p>
