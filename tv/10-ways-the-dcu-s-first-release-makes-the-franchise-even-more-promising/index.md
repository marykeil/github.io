## Literature Review

The first project in the new DC Universe will bring along a series of exciting elements that can make the DCU&#39;s future extremely promising.




Creature Commandos, the first project of the new DC Universe, makes the franchise more interesting in many ways. While James Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy will be the first major release of the DCU, being the universe&#39;s first movie and focusing on the most well-known superhero of all, the Creature Commandos show serves perfectly as the first project for the DCU. The universe is already showing a lot of promise, with Gunn commenting about how the DCU will look more to the comics than the DCEU while also setting itself apart from what has come before.
The new DC Universe is also building a strong foundation. Gunn has formed a group of fantastic writers to chart the overall story of the DCU, which includes people like DC Comics&#39; Tom King, the creator of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil, Drew Goddard, and more. Gunn himself is deeply involved with some of the upcoming DCU movies and series, with the universe&#39;s creative head writing all episodes of Creature Commandos. Based on Gunn&#39;s direct impact on the DCU&#39;s first project and all the revealed details from it so far, here are the ways Creature Commandos could make the DCU even more promising.
            
 
 26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Far  
James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.












 








 10  Creature Commandos Begins To Establish The Tone Of The DC Universe 
The DCU&#39;s Tone Is Extremely Important
        

One of the things that ultimately led to the DCEU&#39;s demise was its tone. Every DC character has an ideal tone for them, with someone like Superman usually doing better with a lighter feel to him. The DCEU took a different approach, with many of its projects having a darker tone and characters such as Superman not living up to their full potential due to it. As the DCU&#39;s first project, Creature Commandos will begin establishing the tone of the universe. Creature Commandos should have a very different tone from the somber DCEU, helping set the DCU apart from it.





 9  Creature Commandos Already Teases What The DCU&#39;s DCEU Link Looks Like 
Multiple DCEU Actors Return As Their Characters In The Series


 







Creature Commandos&#39; characters include some exciting new names that will push the DCU in different directions. However, the animated series is also bringing back multiple actors from the old DCEU as their characters. Most notably, Sean Gunn will return as Weasel from The Suicide Squad, with the character playing a key role in Creature Commandos as part of the series&#39; main cast. Viola Davis&#39; Amanda Waller and Steve Agee&#39;s John Economos round out the series&#39; confirmed DCEU returns, showing that Gunn will bring back past DCEU actors if they fit the new DCU&#39;s vision.
Sean Gunn will be pulling triple duty in the DCU, with the actor also set to play G.I. Robot in Creature Commandos and Maxwell Lord in the DCU. 






 8  Creature Commandos Introduces A Wonder Woman Villain 
The Series Has Cast A Star From Netflix&#39;s The Witcher


 







Gunn has confirmed that Wonder Woman villain Circe is in Creature Commandos. Not only that, but the DCU&#39;s creative head has also confirmed the rumors that The Witcher&#39;s Yennefer actress, Anya Chalotra, will be playing Circe in the animated series. As Wonder Woman currently has no project announced for her to debut in the new DC Universe, Gunn seems to be slowly setting the stage for Diana Prince&#39;s eventual appearance. Between Creature Commandos and Paradise Lost — the prequel series focused on the Amazons of Themyscira — the DCU will lay the foundation for Wonder Woman to soar whenever she debuts.





 7  Creature Commandos Gives The DCU Something The DCEU Never Had 
The DCU Will Experiment With Mediums And Formats
        

When he announced the first projects in the new DC Universe, Gunn revealed that the DCU would include movies, series, animation, and video games. As the DCU&#39;s first project, Creature Commandos does right by that promise from the get-go. The old DCEU never had an animated series, with the new DC Universe&#39;s first project already turning to animation, giving the new universe an exciting new addition. The DCEU mainly consisted of movies, with only Gunn&#39;s Peacemaker as a series, and the DCU expanding its horizons already in its first project is great.





 6  Creature Commandos Could Set Up Waller &amp; Peacemaker Season 2 
Amanda Waller Will Form The Creature Commandos


 







Creature Commandos&#39; expansive character list includes known DCEU names like Amanda Waller and John Economos. Viola Davis&#39; Waller will play a crucial role in the series, as the DCU slate reveal announcement described the series by saying that &#34;Amanda Waller creates a black ops team out of monstrous prisoners.&#34; Like in The Suicide Squad, Economos should play a supporting role as part of those working for Waller. With the two characters in the animated series, Creature Commandos could plant the seeds for their next DCU TV shows, Waller and Peacemaker season 2.





 5  Creature Commandos Is The Perfect Break Between The DCEU And The DCU 
The Animated Series Is The DCU&#39;&#39;s Only Project In 2024
        

The DCEU released its final four movies in 2023. While debuting only a year after the end of the DCEU, Creature Commandos is the DCU&#39;s only release of 2024. Creature Commandos is such a different project to the DCEU, based on its bizarre characters, animated medium, and more, that it serves as the perfect palate cleanser to prepare audiences to go all in on the DCU when Superman: Legacy premieres in 2025. With the anticipated Joker: Folie à Deux representing DC movies at the 2024 box office, a quieter start for the DCU with Creature Commandos is the perfect choice.





 4  Creature Commandos Will Show James Gunn’s Imprint From The DCU’s Start 
James Gunn&#39;s Superhero Movies And Series Show The DCU Is In Good Hands
        

Gunn has shown that he will not only be coordinating the new DC Universe from the top, with the creative being directly involved in a few DCU projects. As the DCU&#39;s first entry, Gunn&#39;s involvement with Creature Commandos will help the universe start with a bang. Gunn wrote all seven episodes of the first season of Creature Commandos, recently revealing that he also directed the series&#39; main voice cast. Based on the success of his superhero projects, having Gunn&#39;s DNA all over Creature Commandos raises excitement for the DCU&#39;s start and his involvement in future projects.





 3  Creature Commandos Boasts An Impressive Cast 
The DCU Has Assembled An All-Star Roster
        

While Viola Davis&#39; Amanda Waller was announced to assemble the team when Creature Commandos was first revealed, the series&#39; full cast would only be shared months later. Creature Commandos&#39; cast includes DCEU actors Sean Gunn as Weasel and G.I. Robot, as well as Steve Agee as John Economos. The main team of the series features Gunn&#39;s two characters, David Harbour&#39;s Eric Frankenstein, Frank Grillo&#39;s Rick Flag Sr., Maria Bakalova&#39;s Princess Ilana Rostovic, Alan Tudyk&#39;s Dr. Phosphorus, Indira Varma&#39;s The Bride, and Zoe Chao&#39;s Nina Mazursky. As voice actors will play their characters in live-action, the DCU gains exciting possibilities.





 2  Creature Commandos Can See Many DCU Character Debuts 
Circe&#39;s Announcement For The Series Brought An Exciting Tease
        

When confirming that The Witcher&#39;s Anya Chalotra would play Circe in Creature Commandos, Gunn also teased more additions to the animated series&#39; cast. Gunn said, &#34;There are other cool characters in the show played by other cool actors.&#34; Creature Commandos has the perfect setup to introduce new characters to the DCU over the years. Every season of the animated series could follow the lead of Waller&#39;s other team, the Suicide Squad, with a few characters returning but mostly a new roster. Obscure DCU characters and intriguing villains like Circe could pass through the show before moving on to live-action.





 1  Creature Commandos Gives The DCU Something The MCU Is Only Now Getting Into 
The DCU Will Play With Its Projects&#39; Tones
        

Creature Commandos is an adult animated series, which means the show will not be afraid to feature mature themes or get bloody. It took the Marvel Cinematic Universe 16 years to finally have a project geared toward an older audience, with Disney&#43;&#39;s Echo being the MCU&#39;s first TV-MA series. By starting with an adult animated series, the DCU shows that it will allow every project to have the tone that best fits its characters and story, avoiding mistakes made by the DCEU and the MCU. Based on all those factors, Creature Commandos makes the DCU&#39;s future even more promising.
