## Literature Review
The latest reality TV show, The Truth: A Game Of Greed, premiered season 1. Here&#39;s when and where to watch the new series.




The Trust: A Game Of Greed just dropped, and it&#39;s time to discuss where and when to watch the show. In what feels like an offshoot of The Traitors franchise, contestants compete for a $250,000 prize with a catch: no one has to be eliminated. Everyone can vote daily to split the money equally and keep everyone in the game. However, it&#39;s unsurprising that the players on The Trust: A Game Of Greed season 1 don&#39;t make this choice.




The Trust: A Game Of Greed is a cross between The Traitors and Big Brother, pitting housemates against each other and encouraging alliances and deception. Contestants of varying financial and ideological backgrounds are poised to backstab and team up to take home the most money possible. While they could keep everyone in at every vote, that&#39;s not the more entertaining option.


 The Trust: A Game Of Greed Season 1 Premiered January 10 
          

The brand-new reality TV series premiered its first four episodes on January 10. During the first episodes, the cast is revealed, and the host, Brooke Baldwin, urges them to form relationships with and opinions about each other. Reiterating that no one needs to go home, the cast gets to work garnering trust and learning more about each other&#39;s motives. Only the first four episodes are available to stream, leading to the assumption that new episodes will be released weekly.

The Trust: A Game Of Greed season 1 can be streamed on Netflix beginning January 10. Only the first four episodes are currently available for streaming, leading to the assumption that new episodes will be released weekly. While it&#39;s unclear how many episodes will stream and when the finale is, the upcoming release will likely indicate the course of the show. Other Netflix shows, such as Love Is Blind or Perfect Match, release three weeks of 3 to 4 episodes before releasing the finale, so it&#39;s possible The Trust: A Game Of Greed will follow the same structure.

The Trust: A Game Of Greed comes out at a great time, as audiences are currently enjoying The Traitors UK. While not the same, the game of elimination, alliances, and deception remain throughlines between the two. Knowing that every contestant could walk away a winner, but the players don&#39;t make that choice, makes for an interesting social experiment. The new series could go far since it combines the premises of two of the most popular shows, Big Brother and The Traitors. Luckily, audiences can tune in beginning January 10 on Netflix.






The Trust: A Game Of Greed premiered episodes 1-4 on January 10 on Netflix.
