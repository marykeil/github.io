# Suits  New Spinoff Proves How Important Meghan Markle s Character Really Was 


## SUMMARY 



  Meghan Markle&#39;s portrayal of Rachel Zane in Suits had a significant impact on the original series and its expanding franchise.   The upcoming Suits spinoff, Suits: Los Angeles, will feature a lead character, Erica, who shares similarities with Markle&#39;s Zane.   While it would have been plausible for Zane to appear in the new series, Markle&#39;s return to the role is unlikely due to her retirement from acting and royal duties.

## Literature Review

Meghan Markle may have left her Rachel Zane role behind, but the influence of her character continues to be vital to the Suits franchise. 




Suits&#39; upcoming new spinoff is a remarkable indicator of how critical Meghan Markle&#39;s Rachel Zane role had been to the original series. Zane was Suits&#39; star paralegal at the Hardmen-Pearson law firm (later Specter Litt), whose character arc was defined by her lasting romance with lead character Michael Ross and her strict ambition to become a fierce lawyer in her own right. Although Zane was a regular character for seven of the legal drama&#39;s eight seasons, Markle left the Suits&#39; role behind to pursue matters that evolved in her personal life.




She may not have made it through to the season finale like the rest of Suits&#39; regular characters, but Zane&#39;s influence has spread well beyond the limits of the original mega-hit show. Excitingly, the Suits franchise is expanding to include another series set in an entertainment law firm in Los Angeles under the development of original show creator Aaron Korsh and NBCUniversal. Details on Suits&#39; new spinoff series, dubbed Suits: Los Angeles, are still building, but a major update has solidified how critical Markle&#39;s Zane role became to Suits and its ever-growing franchise.



Pearson (2019), canceled after its first season, is the first spinoff series of Suits.

While cast decisions are still pending, a new update on the upcoming Suits spinoff asserts that lead character Erica will have considerable similarities to Markle&#39;s Zane. According to Puck entertainment journalist Matthew Belloni, Erica&#39;s character description expresses her as &#34;30s, Black, [a] SoCal native, and [a] Harvard law alum. She’s jockeying to be made Head of Entertainment. She’s great at closing clients but struggles elsewhere. Smarter than everyone.&#34; The future franchise character&#39;s headstrong, driven, and intelligent personality traits are evocative of the characteristics Zane uniquely held in Suits.

Compared to Suits&#39; other characters - like Donna, who had more of a &#34;no holds barred&#34; type of drive, and Pearson, who was already at the top of the food chain - Zane was distinct among Suits&#39; cast of characters. With diverse and uber-talented castmates, Markle&#39;s Zane may not have been every fan&#39;s favorite, but her prevalence in the series is proven retroactively by the franchise&#39;s inclination to develop a new lead in her likeness. Since Zane held her own for most of Suits&#39; run, it&#39;s likely Erica will be an essential component in evolving the spinoff into a thriving franchise installment.

Recreating the mold of Zane&#39;s likeness for Suits: Los Angeles begs the questions of why Markle&#39;s character couldn&#39;t return to lead the new series and if she&#39;ll ever venture back into the franchise&#39;s overarching universe. Zane&#39;s narrative didn&#39;t end in a way that was final by the time of Markle&#39;s series exit. It&#39;s not hard to imagine that Zane and her husband could have established themselves as legal agents over in L.A., especially in view of the fact that Suits star Patrick J. Adams expressed a willingness to return as Ross.

With respect to Suits&#39; overarching narrative, Zane&#39;s appearance in the new series would have been easy to pull off, but it&#39;s doubtful that Markle would return to reprise the role. Markle left Suits after marrying Prince Harry, prompting her to retire from acting to pursue her royal duties (via Pop Sugar). Because of her affiliation with the royal family, Markle seems selective in how she appears in the public eye, making her Suits&#39; return rather unlikely.
