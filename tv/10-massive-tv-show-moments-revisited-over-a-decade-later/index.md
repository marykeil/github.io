## Literature Review
From MASH&#39;s finale to The Red Wedding, the impact some of TV&#39;s biggest moments made on the medium did not become clear until years after they aired.




Even though the biggest moments on television aren’t guaranteed to age well, all of them have a part to play in the history of the medium. Television history is dotted with moments that changed scripted programs forever. Whether they&#39;re from hits like Lost or Boardwalk Empire, redefining the potential size of TV budgets, or shows like The Sopranos and The Walking Dead, changing what kind of envelope-pushing content could be aired on television, major moments in TV history have the chance to change how the medium itself works.
However, this doesn’t mean that every huge TV moment leaves behind a positive legacy in the decades that follow. One look at the worst TV crossovers of all time is all it takes to prove that, sometimes, huge TV moments are nothing more than major disappointments. Similarly, some divisive TV show finales have commanded massive audiences only to leave them disappointed and despondent by the end of the episode. Whether they were beloved or rightfully hated, all of TV’s biggest moments have had a huge impact on the medium in the years since they aired.









 








 10  Lost’s Finale Really Didn’t Work 
The Mystery Series Fell Apart
        

 Lost 

 Release Date   September 22, 2004    Cast   Evangeline Lilly , Naveen Andrews , Henry Ian Cusick , Daniel Dae Kim , Harold Perrineau , Dominic Monaghan , Emilie de Ravin , Jorge Garcia , Josh Holloway , Michael Emerson , Terry O&#39;Quinn , Matthew Fox , Ken Leung , Elizabeth Mitchell , Yunjin Kim    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi , Supernatural    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6    




When Lost debuted, the show was a massive success. The mystery of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 was introduced in Lost season 1, episode 1, “Pilot (Part 1),” which commanded a staggering 18.65 million viewers (via Fandom.com). By the second season’s premiere, that number had skyrocketed to 23.47 million. However, by the time Lost’s infamously divisive finale aired, the average viewership had dwindled to less than half of the first episode’s audience share. For all of its mysteries, Lost’s finale let viewers down when the show revealed that its big ending was just a spin on the purgatory twist everyone had guessed years earlier.





 9  Glee Never Matched Its Debut Season 
The 2000s Hit Couldn&#39;t Keep Its Success Alive
        

 Glee 

 Release Date   May 19, 2009    Cast   Dianna Agron , Chris Colfer , Jessalyn Gilsig , Jane Lynch , Jayma Mays , Kevin McHale , Lea Michele , Cory Monteith , Matthew Morrison , Amber Riley    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Musical    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6    




When Glee debuted in 2009, the show became a massive success. Its cast and writing were both critically acclaimed, its music became a streaming sensation, and the show’s popularity resulted in live concert tours, a concert film, and millions of soundtrack sales. However, this hype couldn’t last. Glee’s popularity declined almost as fast as the show blew up. By the time the series ended in 2015, Glee&#39;s viewership had gone from a season 2 average of 10.9 million to a mere 3 million for the final season (via The Hollywood Reporter).





 8  The Friends Finale Fit The Show’s Legacy 
The Classic &#39;90s Sitcom Ended Right


 







 Friends 

 Release Date   September 22, 1994    Cast   Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Sitcom    Seasons   10    




While the Friends finale might have been a source of consternation among the show’s fan base, the ending still stands out as a testament to its larger legacy. Where hits like Lost and Glee started strong and gradually shed viewers as the years passed, the Friends finale was watched by 52.5 million viewers (via Entertainment Weekly). This made it the most popular episode of the classic sitcom, as well as one of the most-watched television events of the 2000s. This was well-earned since, for all of its flaws, the Friends finale is a strong showcase of the cast’s incredible chemistry.





 7  MASH’s Daring Finale Was The Right Choice 
The Biggest Sitcom Episode Ever Is Dark, Brutal, &amp; Brilliant
        

 M*A*S*H 

 Release Date   September 17, 1972    Cast   Alan Alda , Wayne Rogers , Loretta Swit , Mike Farrell , Harry Morgan , Jamie Farr , David Ogden Stiers    Genres   Drama , Comedy    Seasons   11    




Perhaps the only way to make the impact of the Friends finale seem less impressive would be to compare it with the final episode of MASH. This classic sitcom ended on February 28, 1983, with MASH season 11, episode 16, “Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,” which was watched by a still-staggering 106 million viewers (via CNN). Despite the show’s reputation as a cozy sitcom, MASH’s tragic finale was a bracing, daring anti-war polemic that addressed the extent of Hawkeye’s debilitating PTSD. A brave piece of dramedy, “Goodbye, Farewell and Amen” remains a testament to mainstream comedy’s power to challenge viewers.





 6  The Red Wedding Made Game Of Thrones Essential Viewing 
The HBO Hit Became A Household Name After This Episode


 







 Game Of Thrones 

 Release Date   April 11, 2011    Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Genres   Drama , Action , Adventure    Seasons   8    




While the first few seasons of Game of Thrones were critically acclaimed, the atomized nature of pop culture in the 2010s and the show’s dark tone meant that the series didn’t feel like a global cultural moment. This changed with the arrival of Game of Thrones season 3, episode 9, “The Rains of Castamere.” An impressively brutal outing, “The Rains of Castamere” killed off most of the show’s most unambiguously heroic characters in a massacre dubbed the Red Wedding. This pitiless sequence proved the show wasn’t messing around and made Game of Thrones the full-blown pop culture phenomenon the series was always destined to become.





 5  Buffy’s Musical Episode Is Still One of the Best 
Buffy The Vampire Slayer Spawned A TV Staple
        

 Buffy The Vampire Slayer 

 Release Date   March 10, 1997    Cast   Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters    Genres   Action , Comedy , Drama , Horror , Supernatural    Seasons   7    




Since Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 6, episode 7, “Once More, With Feeling,” first aired, musical episodes have become a veritable TV staple. Everything from Scrubs to Riverdale would stage musical episodes in the years that followed. However, to Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s credit, the show’s outing remains one of the strongest musical episodes in TV history. While many other elements of the &#39;90s hit have aged poorly, “Once More, With Feeling” is proof that this TV staple can work well.





 4  “Who Shot J.R.?” Was Inimitably Huge 
Dallas&#39; Massive Meme Could Never Be Replicated
        

 Dallas (1978) 

 Release Date   April 2, 1978    Cast   Larry Hagman , Patrick Duffy    Genres   Drama    Seasons   14    




The Dallas season 3 finale, “A House Divided,” ended on a cliffhanger, as Larry Hagman’s villain, J.R. Ewing, was shot by an unseen assailant. What followed was a genuine phenomenon as America obsessed over “Who shot J.R.?” in the eight months before Dallas season 4 premiered. Dallas’s answer to “Who Shot J.R.?” commanded an audience of 83 million in just the U.S. (via History Channel), but the episode’s pop culture impact was inimitable. The rise of the internet, the creation of streaming services, and the proliferation of new TV networks made the idea of any show holding American pop culture in such a stranglehold for months on end an impossibility.





 3  Seinfeld’s Finale Changed Sitcoms Forever 
The Sitcom Proved Comedy Leads DIdn&#39;t Need To Be Likable
        

 Seinfeld 

 Release Date   July 5, 1989    Cast   Jerry Seinfeld , Julia Louis-Dreyfus , Jason Alexander , Michael Richards    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   9    




Seinfeld&#39;s final season ended with a two-part finale viewed by 76 million people (via Entertainment Weekly). The show’s ending shocked many longtime viewers by leaving the heroes in prison, a bleak dénouement that avoided the sentimentality of most sitcom finales. In the process, Seinfeld opened the door for darker sitcoms that didn’t focus on likable heroes and happy endings. From Curb Your Enthusiasm to It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia to Arrested Development, sitcoms stopped worrying about making their main characters decent people after the great Seinfeld finale proved that moral ambiguity wouldn’t put off viewers.





 2  “Who Shot Mr. Burns” Had the Right Answer 
The Simpsons Made Its Major Mystery A Big Joke
        

 The Simpsons 

 Release Date   December 17, 1989    Cast   Tress MacNeille , Julie Kavner , Harry Shearer , Pamela Hayden , Nancy Cartwright , Hank Azaria , Dan Castellaneta , Yeardley Smith    Genres   Animation , Comedy    Seasons   35    




The Simpsons parodied Dallas’s famous mystery with the show’s season 6 finale, “Who Shot Mr. Burns,” but few viewers could have predicted that this storyline would also recreate much of the hype that surrounded that earlier event. The question of who shot Mr. Burns became a national obsession, but The Simpsons provided the only answer that would have worked for the playful tone of the series. When it transpired that Maggie had accidentally shot the villain, The Simpsons reminded viewers that the show was — and always would be — a goofy cartoon comedy at heart.





 1  The Divisive Sopranos Finale Really Was Perfect 
Confirming or Denying Tony&#39;s Death Misses The Point


 







 The Sopranos 

 Release Date   January 10, 1999    Cast   James Gandolfini , Lorraine Bracco , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Dominic Chianese , Steven Van Zandt , Tony Sirico , Robert Iler , Jamie-Lynn Sigler    Genres   Crime , Drama    Rating   TV-MA    Seasons   6    




The ending of The Sopranos is one of the most divisive TV show finales ever, but over a decade later, it’s clear that its coda was a perfect conclusion to Tony’s character arc. If The Sopranos ended with Tony enjoying a family meal, the show would have betrayed its dark tone, the lead character’s anguish over the awful things he had done, and the consequences of his actions. If The Sopranos ended with Tony’s death, it would have felt like just another conventional rise-and-fall gangster story with none of the show’s nuance or depth. As it was, the ambiguous finale of The Sopranos was perfect.
