Summary

  The post-credits scene in Marvel&#39;s Echo sets up Kingpin&#39;s bid for mayor of New York City.   Kingpin watches a TV program discussing the need for a fighter as the next mayor, inspiring him to run.   The scene confirms Kingpin&#39;s storyline in Daredevil: Born Again, which adapts a storyline from the Marvel Comics.  







Marvel&#39;s Echo post-credits scene after the fifth episode, &#34;Maya,&#34; sets up the future for an important street-level character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A spinoff from Phase 4&#39;s Hawkeye show, Echo follows deaf Choctaw hero Maya Lopez as she returns home after attempting to murder Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin. While in her hometown of Tamaha, Oklahoma, Maya wages war on Kingpin&#39;s New York City empire, and at the same time reconnects with her family, from which she&#39;s been estranged for close to 20 years. Everything changes when Kingpin shows up in Tamaha and faces off against Maya, who has discovered her ancestral powers.

The battle between Kingpin and Maya is essentially a draw, after Maya uses her healing abilities on Fisk to help him work through some of the trauma he endured as a child that led him to murder his own father. Kingpin and his men flee the Choctaw Powwow while Maya is free to remain with her family. The Echo ending leaves room for future storylines, and the post-credits scene explicitly sets up another upcoming MCU show.




                  Echo: Maya Lopezâ€™s Powers &amp; Comic History Explained   Maya Lopez a.k.a. Echo is a key street-level MCU character with a tragic past and several connections to major Marvel heroes and villains.    


 What Happens In Marvel&#39;s Echo Post-Credits Scene 
         

The Echo post-credits scene opens on Kingpin traveling aboard his private plane seen earlier in the season, in episode 4 when Maya refuses to go home to New York City with him. Presumably, Kingpin is on his way back to New York and is dealing with business matters with the help of a woman who appears to be his assistant. Once he gives an order to assemble all the &#34;remaining heads&#34; so he can &#34;stabilize the situation,&#34; Fisk turns his attention to the TV, which depicts two political commentators discussing the NYC mayoral race.




The reporters are talking about how the race doesn&#39;t have a clear frontrunner. The men on TV say the people of New York want &#34;a fighter&#34; as their mayor to help deal with the problems in the city, even going as far as to say a &#34;bare-knuckle brawler&#34; is needed. One of them asks, &#34;Is that candidate even out there?&#34; As Fisk watches, he leans forward in interest, clearly mulling over throwing his hat into the race to become the next NYC mayor.

Kingpin Gets Inspired To Run For Mayor Of New York City
The TV program Fisk watches on the plane in the Echo post-credits scene is clearly setting up Kingpin&#39;s bid for mayor of New York City. Though Wilson Fisk has always been a public-facing figure, he&#39;s typically presented himself as a businessman, rather than a political candidate. Given the discussion of the men on the TV, who reference the need for someone not afraid to fight for the people of New York and take on the establishment, it&#39;s clear Kingpin thinks of himself as the perfect candidate. Though viewers don&#39;t see Kingpin actually join the race, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s performance in the final moments of the scene shows that Fisk is planning on running.




             Marvel&#39;s Echo   Release Date   January 9, 2024    Cast   Chaske Spencer , Zahn McClarnon , Graham Greene , Alaqua Cox , Cody Lightning , Charlie Cox , Tantoo Cardinal , Devery Jacobs , Vincent D&#39;Onofrio    Seasons   1    Writers   Amy Rardin , Marion Dayre    Streaming Service(s)   Disney&#43; , Hulu    Franchise(s)   Marvel Cinematic Universe    Directors   Sydney Freeland       

Who Are The &#34;Heads&#34; Kingpin Refers To?
Before Kingpin starts watching the discussion about the NYC mayoral race, he&#39;s coordinating with his assistant on what needs to be done when he returns to the city. The only order viewers hear him give is to set up a meeting with the &#34;remaining heads,&#34; which are presumably the remaining heads of his organization. Earlier in the season on Echo, Maya blew up an armory in Fisk&#39;s empire, which took out a lot of his weapons. Since Kingpin largely rules over his criminal empire with fear, and it was thought he was dead following Maya shooting him in the eye, it&#39;s likely Fisk means to stabilize his own organization and its hold on the city once he returns.



 How Echo&#39;s Post-Credits Scene Sets Up Kingpin In Daredevil: Born Again 
         





It&#39;s long been confirmed that Vincent D&#39;Onofrio will return as Kingpin as part of the Daredevil: Born Again cast and, though official story details haven&#39;t been revealed by Marvel, set photos and an early synopsis hinted at Wilson Fisk&#39;s mayoral run. Set photos depicted Mayor Fisk memorabilia at an event, as well as a formally dressed Kingpin on the streets, widely speculated to be another part of his mayoral campaign. Additionally, a U.S. copyright filing for Daredevil: Born Again indicated both Kingpin and Matthew Murdock aka Daredevil will try to &#34;serve the people of New York.&#34;

Now, the Echo post-credits scene seems to confirm all speculation and establish that Kingpin will indeed run for mayor of New York City during Daredevil: Born Again. Since Fisk&#39;s dealings with Maya are seemingly over, the credits scene sets up his next storyline in the MCU, which is to have Kingpin focus on New York. That will no doubt see him resume his long-standing battle with Daredevil for control over the city.




Further, the Echo post-credits scene seems to set up Kingpin as a figure similar to President Donald Trump, insofar as the former U.S. president ran his original campaign on the idea that the country needed someone who wasn&#39;t a typical politician. The way the commentators in Echo talk about New York City needing someone other than the normal political candidates seems reminiscent of Trump&#39;s 2016 campaign, leading viewers to draw obvious parallels between Kingpin and Trump. It&#39;s unclear if that theme will carry over into Daredevil: Born Again, but it seems possible.

Will Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s Creative Changes Affect Kingpin&#39;s Storyline?
          

In late 2023, it was reported that Marvel had fired the writers and directors on Daredevil: Born Again while the production was shut down for the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. The reported reason was that the footage, and ultimately the show, wasn&#39;t working for top Marvel Studios executives, including Kevin Feige. Marvel has since brought in Loki season 2 directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, who are said to be using some scenes and episodes that were previously filmed. As a result, it seems likely the creative changes won&#39;t affect the overall storyline of Daredevil: Born Again, so it should still be expected to depict Kingpin&#39;s mayoral run and tenure.




Kingpin Running For Mayor Adapts A Marvel Comics Storyline
In the comics, Wilson Fisk runs for mayor of New York City and ends up winning. Once in office, he uses his position to wage war against vigilantes, including calling for the arrest of Daredevil. Matt Murdock decides to accept a position as Fisk&#39;s deputy mayor, wanting to use the role as a way to take down Fisk. When an attack by the Hand leaves Kingpin in a coma, Matt becomes acting mayor of the city until Fisk recovers. After he does, Matt steps down as deputy mayor, but makes Fisk promise to end his war against vigilantes.

It&#39;s unclear how much of this storyline will be included in Daredevil: Born Again. The Netflix Daredevil TV show introduced the Hand as a villain, but the organization hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet in the MCU proper. At the very least, it seems likely that Kingpin will become mayor of New York City in the MCU and Matt Murdock will have to contend with Fisk as both a lawyer and as Daredevil.



All three seasons of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil are streaming on Disney&#43;.









 When Will Echo Return In The MCU? 
          

While the Echo post-credits scene is clearly setting up Kingpin&#39;s MCU return in Daredevil: Born Again, Maya Lopez&#39;s future remains uncertain. Echo is not yet confirmed to appear in any upcoming Marvel movies or shows, but considering her ties to Kingpin, it seems possible she could show up in Daredevil: Born Again. After all, Maya did fight Daredevil in Echo episode 1, so she has some knowledge of the Devil of Hell&#39;s Kitchen, and might be willing to lend a hand to go up against her uncle.

That said, Maya might choose to stay in Oklahoma for a bit, setting up a potential Echo season 2, if Marvel Studios decides to continue the television show&#39;s exploration of the characters. There&#39;s also the possibility of Maya appearing in an upcoming Avengers movie, either Avengers: The Kang Dynasty or Avengers: Secret Wars. Since both will see Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes dealing with a multiversal war, the Avengers will need all the help they can get, and Echo has proven herself to be a strong fighter with powerful abilities. So, while it remains to be seen when - or if - Maya returns in the MCU, the Echo post-credits scene does set the stage for another upcoming Marvel show.
