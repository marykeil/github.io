## Literature Review

Netflix&#39;s live-action remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender should include eight characters who are extremely powerful despite being unable to bend.




Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender remake will include a lot of powerful characters, including eight that are non-benders. The original Avatar: The Last Airbender made waves for Nickelodeon, quickly becoming one of the most popular animated series on-air. It&#39;s no surprise then, that Netflix has decided to remake the series in a live-action format, though the well-publicized struggles of the 2010 movie adaptation could have scared it away. The fact that Netflix&#39;s remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender is happening despite the movie&#39;s failure speaks to the quality of the original.
Part of the reason the original Last Airbender is so good is that it has great characters who participate in loads of entertaining action sequences. Though the most powerful figures in the show&#39;s universe are definitely benders, there are a number of strong characters who manage to be effective warriors without the use of bending. With the live-action show&#39;s release quickly approaching, it&#39;s worth taking the time to examine the most powerful non-bending characters likely to appear in Avatar: The Last Airbender&#39;s cast.
            
 
 10 Avatar: The Last Airbender Moments We Must See In Netflix&#39;s Live-Action Show 
Netflix has plenty of material for the live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender, but there are some scenes they can’t afford to exclude.












 








 8  Ty Lee — Azula&#39;s Childhood Friend 
Fighting style: Chi-blocking
        

Ty Lee, one of Avatar: The Last Airbender&#39;s best side characters, is one of the most dangerous fighters in the show&#39;s world. Despite not being able to bend, Ty Lee&#39;s ability to block her opponents&#39; chi, thereby preventing them from bending and temporarily paralyzing them, makes her capable of fighting just about anyone. She is also an extremely skilled and talented acrobat, allowing her to dodge most attacks, even from powerful benders like Katara or Toph.
Ty Lee is also incredibly resilient, which makes her even more formidable. Further, her bubbly personality often conceals the threat she poses, causing her opponents to underestimate her. Those foolish enough to do so are quickly disillusioned, allowing Ty Lee to prove time and time again just how dangerous she can be.





 7  Sokka — Part Of Team Avatar 
Fighting style: Water Tribe Warrior and jian-fencing swordsmanship


 







Sokka, one of Avatar: The Last Airbender&#39;s main characters, is known for his comic relief and general goofiness, but he develops into a fine warrior over the course of the story. Sokka fights with a variety of weapons, including his signature boomerang; a Water Tribe club; a machete; and, in the final season of the original show, a sword. He participates in some of The Last Airbender&#39;s most exciting fights, and distinguishes himself on several occasions.
While Sokka may not be as good in the first season of the show as he is by its conclusion, he is still a worthy fighter and one of the better non-bending warriors in the show&#39;s world. He is also underestimated by fans because he often fights next to Aang and Katara, two of the most powerful benders in the world. Team Avatar takes on some incredibly dangerous opponents, and the fact that Sokka gets through each of those fights as well as Aang or Katara, proves that he is a powerful fighter.





 6  Jet — Leader Of The Freedom Fighters 
Fighting style: Swordsmanship


 







Jet is a recurring character in the original Avatar: The Last Airbender, and he is an extremely skilled fighter. Using an interesting form of hook-ended swords, Jet often tries to disarm his opponent or upset their balance by hooking an ankle or knee with the end of his sword. Jet is a somewhat troubled character, scarred by the loss of his parents at a young age, which causes him to fight with a reckless rage and thirst for revenge against the Fire Nation, making him even more dangerous. With that in mind, he&#39;s definitely one of the strongest non-benders.





 5  Suki — Kyoshi Warrior 
Fighting style: Tessenjutsu
        

Suki, the most prominent member of the Kyoshi Warriors, is another astonishingly skilled fighter. Using the Kyoshi Warriors&#39; characteristic tessenjutsu fighting style, Suki wields iron fans as her primary weapon. She is impressively agile and has seemingly perfect control of her movements. Suki typically dodges or parries with her fans to frustrate her opponents, enticing them to overreach and enabling her to unbalance them, using their own momentum against them. This acrobatic form of martial arts should be incredible to watch in live-action.
            
 
 8 Most Powerful Benders To Expect In Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender Season 1 
Netflix&#39;s live-action remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender will include eight of the show&#39;s most powerful benders in one way or another.








 4  Hakoda — Southern Water Tribe Chieftan 
Fighting style: Water Tribe Warrior
        

Hakoda, the father of Sokka and Katara, is a skilled veteran of many battles and skirmishes, proving his skill as a fighter on numerous occasions. Hakoda is a strong leader as well as a skilled fighter, inspiring loyalty in his troops through sheer force of will and sense of presence. His versatility is his best attribute as a warrior, allowing him to fight up close and personal, or lead from afar as a commander. Hakoda&#39;s fighting skills should make a significant contribution to Netflix&#39;s remake of Avatar: The Last Airbender.





 3  Longshot — Freedom Fighter 
Fighting style: Archery
        

Another member of the Freedom Fighters who is a notable fighter is Longshot. The nearly silent archer is as accurate as one could hope to be with his bow and arrow, and he is even capable of shooting multiple arrows at once. Longshot&#39;s range with his bow and ability to conceal himself in the trees make him extremely dangerous as an enemy because he can hit someone before they even know he&#39;s there. His impressive feats with a bow and arrow should translate well to live-action and help Netflix&#39;s show stay exciting even when bending isn&#39;t a factor.





 2  Bato Of The Water Tribe — Southern Water Tribe Warrior 
Fighting style: Water Tribe Warrior
        

Bato of the Water Tribe is a close friend of Hakoda, Sokka, and Katara&#39;s, and he is another capable warrior without the ability to bend. Like Sokka and Hakoda, Bato uses a variety of Water Tribe weapons to great effect, though it doesn&#39;t prevent him from getting seriously injured in a raid on the Fire Nation during Avatar: The Last Airbender season 1. Despite his injury, Bato is able to return to action for the invasion of the Fire Nation, proving his mettle there beyond any doubt. Bato should be another entertaining addition to The Last Airbender in live-action.





 1  June — Bounty Hunter 
Weapon of choice: Whip
        

June is a bounty hunter hired by Zuko to track down Aang and Team Avatar. Though her mount, a shishu named Nyla, gets the credit for tracking down their quarries, June herself is fully capable of subduing her opponents without the shishu. She shows off her strength in the original show by arm wrestling enormous men in a tavern, proving that she can go toe-to-toe with anyone.
With Nyla on her side, June is nearly unstoppable because of the paralyzing toxins the shishu hits their opponents with. Even Appa, with his enormous size and strength, eventually succumbs to Nyla&#39;s poison attacks. With that in mind, June is another exciting aspect of Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender season 1, and she&#39;s easily one of the show&#39;s most dangerous non-benders.
