## Literature Review
The Letterkenny spinoff brings the world of hockey to the series in a unique way by starring real-life professional hockey players and media pundits.




Shoresy, the spinoff series of Letterkenny, merges the sport of ice hockey with the fictional realm of television by casting many real-life professional hockey players and media pundits. Shoresy is similar to other sports comedies but tends to be more vulgar in its tone. The Canadian series follows the Sudbury Bulldogs as they risk the potential to be shut down. Luckily, Shoresy (Jared Keeso) stops this from happening by making a bet and reshaping the team to play better than ever before.
Praise has been given to Shoresy for its portrayal of First Nation characters and its placing of female characters in charge. For some of the cast members of Shoresy, this is their first acting job. This is because Shoresy, with all of its quips and comedic notes, still aims to depict a realistic ice hockey team and this is accomplished by casting actors with experience in the world of hockey.

 1  Jared Keeso 
Strathroy Rockets


 







Jared Keeso plays the titular character of the series, Shore (&#34;Shoresy&#34;). Though he&#39;s most known for his work in the entertainment industry, Keeso does have experience with ice hockey, which can explain his interest in creating Shoresy. When he was younger, Keeso played for the Strathroy Rockets and the Listowel Cyclones. Before creating Letterkenny or Shoresy, Keeso starred in films about famous ice hockey figures. Therefore, it only makes sense that he&#39;d want to ensure Shoresy was as authentic as can be with its portrayal of the sport and the culture surrounding it.
All seasons of Shoresy are available to stream on Hulu.
