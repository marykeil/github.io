## Literature Review
The popular Netflix science fiction television series Stranger Things is set to conclude after season 5, but that doesn’t mean the story has to end.




Stranger Things will end after season 5 (which will premiere at an unspecified date). But given the immense popularity of the Netflix science fiction horror television show, it would not be surprising if the streaming service ordered one or more spinoffs related to the characters and the lore in the series. Since the writers are confident that five seasons of the original show are enough regarding the overarching story, Netflix may want to continue to bank on Stranger Things&#39;s success by expanding its universe with spinoffs.
Stranger Things centers around Eleven, played by Millie Bobbie Brown. Eleven is a young girl with telepathic and psychokinetic powers, thanks to her time at Hawkins Lab, where Dr. Brenner and the other doctors performed experiments on her and many other children. Throughout the show, Eleven and her friends — Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, Lucas Sinclair, Will Byers, and Max Mayfield — battle creatures from the Upside Down, an alternate dimension, alongside some of their parents, siblings, and other (older) friends. Stranger Things season 5 will undoubtedly give most of these characters a satisfying ending, but that doesn&#39;t mean the story will be over.


 7  Steve &amp; Robin As Roommates 

One of the most obvious Stranger Things spinoffs that many viewers would love to see revolves around Steve &#34;The Hair&#34; Harrington and Robin Buckley. Season 3 introduced the world to this duo, and they quickly became one of the best friendships on the Netflix television show. Although some viewers thought they were being set up to be romantic interests, Robin later came out to Steve, quickly shutting down any possibility of them ever being more than friends, and that was evidently for the better.
Steve and Robin perfectly complement one another since they are polar opposites but understand one another on a level that most people don&#39;t. If they both survive season 5 (fingers crossed), it would be in Netflix&#39;s best interest to order a spinoff centered around Steve and Robin, preferably as roommates in a new city. The Steve and Robin spinoff wouldn&#39;t even have to include any supernatural elements. It could just be about them being single, living in a big city, and trying to navigate adulthood, and people would be ecstatic to watch it.

 6  Kali&#39;s Adventures     

Although Stranger Things season 2, episode 8, is arguably one of the show&#39;s worst episodes, it does have the possibility of setting up an intriguing spinoff. The hour focused on Eleven meeting Kali Prasad, aka Eight, one of the other Hawkins Lab test subjects. Although Eleven and Kali had similar experiences growing up and could bond over their powers, they couldn&#39;t have been more different. So, it would be interesting to learn more about Kali&#39;s ideals and adventures after Eleven left Kali in Chicago in season 2.





 5  The Stranger Things Kids All Grown Up     

Most of the Stranger Things kids are not kids anymore — the actors who play them are either in their late teens or early twenties. It&#39;s unclear whether season 5 will have a time jump to account for their rapid aging, but given the cliffhanger in the season 4 finale, it&#39;s unlikely. Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Will, and Max still be in their early years of high school, and that will probably be where the show ends. However, it would be plausible for a spinoff to focus on the Stranger Things kids as young adults, given their ages in real life.
Unfortunately, some characters might die in the final season, which would mean that not every kid could appear in an &#34;all grown up&#34; version of Stranger Things. But for now, fans can dream of a spinoff that continues telling the story of Eleven, Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Will, and Max, whatever that would look like.

 4  Nancy &amp; Jonathan Working At A High-Profile Newspaper 

Stranger Things season 4 ended with Nancy Wheeler and Jonathan Byers on uncertain terms regarding their relationship. After the Byers family moved to California, the distance began to take its toll on the couple. However, Nancy and Jonathan still love one another, as seen during their reunion in the season 4 finale. If they manage to work through their problems in season 5, Netflix might want to continue their love story in a spinoff. A television show centered around Nancy and Jonathan could feature them moving to New York City to pursue their journalism and photography dreams at a high-profile newspaper while navigating their relationship as adults.





 3  Suzie&#39;s Family 
        
Suzie Bingham is another fascinating minor Stranger Things character that Netflix could further explore in a spinoff television series. Suzie was first mentioned by Dustin in the season 3 premiere when he returned from Camp Know Where and told his friends about his new girlfriend, Suzie, whom he met at the summer camp. They refused to believe Dustin until he called her in the finale to ask her the numbers in Planck&#39;s Constant. However, Suzie first forced him to sing &#34;Never Ending Story&#34; with her before she would give it to him. She returned in season 4 when Mike, Jonathan, Will, and Argyle visited her for help, and that&#39;s when the audience met her family.
Suzie comes from a big Mormon family with strict parents, and her siblings are bizarre and hilarious in the best way possible. If Stranger Things season 5 does not show the audience more of Suzie and her family, Netflix could tell their story in another show. Plus, that might mean that the world could see more of Dustin, as well.





 2  Hopper &amp; Joyce As Teenagers      

While the majority of these Stranger Things spinoff ideas look ahead to the future for these characters, a second show could go back in time and tell the story of how Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers met as teenagers. The two were friends and would often ditch class and have smoke breaks together, but they surprisingly never dated. Hopper and Joyce made up for lost time as adults, and as of the season 4 finale, they are together. But a one-off limited series about Hopper and Joyce as kids would make for a fantastic spinoff without having to include the cast members from the original show.

 1  All About Erica 

Erica Sinclair became a fan favorite after Stranger Things season 3 premiered, and sadly, season 4 severely underused her character. It&#39;s unclear how significant of a role Erica will have in season 5, but whatever the case, she deserves all the screentime in the world. So, it would make sense if Netflix ordered a Stranger Things spinoff centered around Erica after Lucas and his friends leave for college, and she has to hold down the fort in Hawkins.
