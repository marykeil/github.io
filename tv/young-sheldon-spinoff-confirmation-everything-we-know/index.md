## Literature Review
As the hit series Young Sheldon comes to an end after seven seasons, it has now been announced that a spinoff will continue the story.




Even as the show ends after seven seasons, a Young Sheldon spinoff has been announced which will continue the story of the Cooper family. Young Sheldon is itself a prequel to the wildly popular Big Bang Theory and follows the fan-favorite character of Sheldon Cooper as he attempts to adjust to life as a brilliant and quirky child in Texas. Much like its predecessor, Young Sheldon became a smash hit in its own right and has necessitated the continuation of the larger Big Bang Theory universe under producer Chuck Lorre. 




The recently-announced Young Sheldon spinoff is not to be confused with the Big Bang Theory spinoff that Lorre also announced at the end of 2023. While details about that spinoff seem to be in limbo at the moment, details surrounding the Young Sheldon spinoff are much more firm and suggest the series is much closer to reaching the screen than the aforementioned Big Bang Theory continuation. Based on the information provided, the Young Sheldon spinoff might not feature the beloved character, which could truly test the overall appeal of the franchise. 


 The Young Sheldon Spinoff Is Confirmed 
          

Unlike the spinoff of The Big Bang Theory that is still uncertain, the spinoff for Young Sheldon was officially announced in January 2024. In order to fill the major void that will be left behind on CBS after Young Sheldon goes off the air following season 7, the network is developing a spinoff that will feature the characters of Georgie and Mandy. Most interestingly, the project will be single-camera and will not have the typical sitcom laugh-track found in its predecessors. The series has Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon alums Chuck Lorre, Steve Holland and Steven Molaro attached as producers. 






 The Young Sheldon Spinoff Cast 
          

Since the spinoff will center on Georgie and Mandy, it stands to reason that Montana Jordan and Emily Osment will return to their respective roles. However, the only unconfirmed detail about the series thus far is the aforementioned actors&#39; involvement, and they have not signed on yet. Fortunately, the odds of the actors turning down the project are slim since anything related to TBBT or Young Sheldon has the chance to be a big hit. At this juncture, it is unclear what other characters from the franchise will be involved, and it is unclear if Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) will even appear in his own spinoff.



 The Young Sheldon Spinoff Story 
          




While exact details about the spinoff&#39;s story haven&#39;t been revealed yet, it is known that it will focus on Georgie and Mandy as they embark on their new lives as parents. It is known for details revealed in The Big Bang Theory that Georgie and Mandy&#39;s relationship ends in divorce, so it is unclear how the new spinoff will tackle such a dark storyline or how the series can sustain itself with such a clear and definite ending. The Young Sheldon spinoff could flesh out the demise of their relationship, or it could do a bit of historical revision.
