  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The Doctor has had a variety of companions from different time periods and planets, including aliens, humans, and even a robotic dog.
Some companions, like Susan and Jamie, had long-lasting relationships with the Doctor, while others, like Katarina and Adric, had brief but impactful stays on the TARDIS.
Companions like Vicki and Zoe brought intelligence and knowledge to the Doctor&rsquo;s adventures, while others like Leela and Captain Jack Harkness provided unique perspectives and skills.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Doctor Who has picked up dozens of companions during his adventures in space, with many coming from worlds and times unfamiliar to the audience.</p>
<p>The Doctor has traveled with many companions in the TARDIS during his adventures in Doctor Who. Doctor Who first began airing in 1963, with William Hartnell in the titular role. As the show evolved over the following 60 years, the lore of the Doctor, his adventures in time and space, and his affection towards Earth continued to grow. The alien from Gallifrey also tends to seek companionship while on his travels, inviting new friends along to experience the wonders of the universe.
While the Doctor has a clear preference for picking up companions from contemporary Earth, he has also branched out and traveled with aliens from other planets, or peoples from the past and future. The Doctor&rsquo;s very first companion was a young alien girl named Susan, who happened to also be his granddaughter, which makes her another Time Lady from Gallifrey, even though this wasn&rsquo;t clearly defined until years later, in 1969. Since Susan, the Doctor has had many more traveling companions, with plenty hailing from other places and times.</p>
<p>18  Susan Foreman
Time Lady From Gallifrey</p>
<p>Susan and the Doctor fled Gallifrey together. When the Doctor first stole his TARDIS, Susan, his grandaughter traveled with him. The pair went on several adventures together before settling down on Earth for some time when Susan enrolled in school and the show first began. As the Doctor&rsquo;s granddaughter, it&rsquo;s clear that Susan shares her home planet and time with the Doctor. However, the show didn&rsquo;t establish the Doctor&rsquo;s people, home planet, and the concept of regeneration until after Susan left the TARDIS to settle into a life with David Campbell in the 2160s.</p>
<p>17  Vicki Pallister
Earth, 25th Century</p>
<p>Vicki grew up in 25th Century England before joining the First Doctor as a companion along with Ian and Barbara. Vicki was just 14 at the time and was clearly included to fill the gap left by Susan. As a student of a highly advanced future, Vicki was extremely intelligent and acquired a great deal of knowledge about medicine, history, and aliens before coming on board the TARDIS.</p>
<p>Why Each Doctor Regenerated In Doctor Who
Doctor Who&rsquo;s titular Time Lord has regenerated many times over the years, but the process has been triggered by a wide array of injuries.</p>
<p>16  Steven Taylor
Earth, Sometime Between The 24th And 26th Centuries</p>
<p>Steven was also a companion to the First Doctor, who stowed away in the TARDIS and ended up becoming a more permanent fixture. Though Steven may be less academically intelligent than his contemporary in the TARDIS, Vicki, he was a man of action and trained as an astronaut and pilot in the distant future of Earth. Steven traveled with the Doctor for some time and saw several companions come and go.</p>
<p>15  Katarina
Earth, During The Fall Of Troy</p>
<p>Katarina met the Doctor, Steven Taylor, and Vicki Pallister in ancient Troy when she was assigned to spy on them for Cassandra. However, Katarina met a heroic end when she sacrificed herself to protect the Doctor and Steven shortly after she joined the team. Katarina may have only traveled with the Doctor briefly, but her importance as the first companion to die while in his care weighed heavily on him long after her death.</p>
<p>14  Jamie McCrimmon
Highland Scot, Mid-18th Century</p>
<p>Jamie McCrimmon has the privilege of being the Doctor&rsquo;s longest companion in terms of how many episodes he has appeared in. Jamie was with the Second Doctor for most of his regeneration and only left due to the Time Lord&rsquo;s exiling the Doctor and sending Jamie back to the moment before he became an official companion to the Doctor. A tribal Scotsman from the mid-18th century, his time in the TARDIS was full of expanding his knowledge and understanding of life beyond Earth and advanced technology before that knowledge was temporarily removed.</p>
<p>13  Victoria Waterfield
Earth, Born 1852</p>
<p>Victoria lost both her parents as a young girl in the middle of the 1800s and was essentially adopted by the Second Doctor and Jamie, who became a surrogate father and brother to the young girl. She was only around 14 or 15 at the time, and during her travels, she was frequently captured as a damsel in distress to bait the Doctor and Jamie. Ultimately, she chose to leave the TARDIS and her friends in favor of a new home with a family in England in 1968.</p>
<p>11 Canon Appearances The Doctor Has Made Outside Of Doctor Who
The Doctor is the main character in Doctor Who, but the Time Lord has appeared in other shows on more than one occasion and for various reasons.</p>
<p>12  Zoe Heriot
Earth, Late 21st Century</p>
<p>Zoe was an extremely intelligent young woman from the late 21st century who often matched the Doctor&rsquo;s intellect. She also traveled alongside the Second Doctor and Jamie up until the Doctor&rsquo;s exile by the Time Lords, when she was returned to her own time, without any memory of her travels. Doctor Who recently confirmed that Zoe had her memories restored in Tales of the TARDIS, where it was also shown that despite not having a clear recollection of her time in the TARDIS, her life continued to be shaped by her subconscious experience of those adventures.</p>
<p>11  Leela
Mordee, Year 5000</p>
<p>Leela is a human descended from a group sent to survey the planet Mordee. Due to warring, the group lost their technologies and devolved into a tribal state, which influenced future generations to behave more like savages than futuristic humans born on other planets. Leela traveled with the Fourth Doctor, and due to her upbringing, she struggled to get accustomed to technology and civil behavior. Eventually, Leela left the Doctor to live with a Time Lord named Andred on Gallifrey, and she kept K9, the Doctor&rsquo;s robotic dog, who chose to stay with her.</p>
<p>10  K9
Bi-AI Foundation, Year 5000</p>
<p>The Fourth Doctor also enjoyed the companionship of the robotic dog, K9. Leela and K9 formed a close bond and the first iteration of the robot eventually chose to go with Leela. Since then, the Doctor has had several other versions of the K9 robot assisting him, with each typically choosing to part ways eventually and go with the Doctor&rsquo;s companions.</p>
<p>9  Romana I
Time Lady From Gallifrey</p>
<p>Romana was assigned to travel with the Fourth Doctor by the White Guardian, who disguised themselves as the Lord President of Gallifrey. Romana is a young Time Lady who excelled at the Time Lord Academy and believes the Doctor to be inferior. She didn&rsquo;t spend long traveling with the Doctor in this incarnation, but after regenerating, the two would become much more familiar.</p>
<p>15 Tennant-Era Doctor Who Characters Who Almost Became Tenth Doctor Companions
In Doctor Who, only the crème de la crème are offered a chance to travel with the Time Lord, but sometimes bad timing still gets in the way.</p>
<p>8  Romana II
Regenerated Time Lady From Gallifrey</p>
<p>After regenerating, Romana joins the Doctor on his travels once again, now harboring romantic feelings for the man she was previously assigned to monitor. Eventually, Romana and K9 Mark II leave the Doctor to follow their own path. Romana is also one of the most utilized characters to appear in audio adventures of Doctor Who and novelizations that expand her story far beyond the series.</p>
<p>7  Adric
Alzarian In The 32nd Century</p>
<p>Adric was a young man who stowed away on the TARDIS after the Doctor, Romana II, and K9 visited his home universe in E-Space. He adventured with the Doctor and accompanied him after he regenerated into the Fifth Doctor. Adric was also part of some of the larger TARDIS teams along with Nyssa, and Tegan before he ultimately met his fate after a Cyberman attack when he died aboard a freighter trying to find a way back home.</p>
<p>6  Nyssa
Trakenite And The Last Of Her Kind</p>
<p>Nyssa met the Doctor briefly before eventually traveling with him. When Nyssa was caught up in an adventure with the Doctor and the Master, she witnessed the destruction of her people, which resulted in her becoming the last of her kind. She traveled with both the Fourth and Fifth Doctors and was present when Adric died. Despite all of this, she traveled with the Doctor for some time, before leaving to help others.</p>
<p>5  Vislor Turlough
An Exile From Trion</p>
<p>Turlough initially met the Doctor when he was employed by the Black Guardian to kill the Fourth Doctor. However, he decided to go against the Guardian and began traveling with the Doctor. Turlough was from the planet Trion, but he was exiled due to his participation in the Civil War. Eventually, after traveling with the Doctor, he was finally able to return home, hailed as a hero.</p>
<p>20 Things To Know About Doctor Who If You&rsquo;re Starting It For The First Time
As many viewers start Doctor Who for the first time, it&rsquo;s important to understand some basic facts about the hit British sci-fi series.</p>
<p>4  Kamelion
Kamelion From Mekalion</p>
<p>Kamelion is a shapeshifting android from the planet Mekalion who was initially found by the Master. The Master used Kamelion to aid him in his nefarious plans, but when the Doctor thwarted his rival, he invited Kamelion to travel with him. His journeys with the Fifth Doctor were short-lived, also traveling alongside Tegan and Turlough. Eventually, when the Master attempted to take over Kamelion once again, he begged the Doctor to destroy him, and the Doctor did so.</p>
<p>3  Captain Jack Harkness
Human Born In 5094 In The Boeshane Peninsula</p>
<p>As a young man, he trained to become a Time Agent, who eventually became a con man after the agency erased two years of his memories. Jack first met the Ninth Doctor and Rose during World War II, when his plan to sell an alien bomb accidentally spread an unusual disease. He went on to travel with the Doctor and Rose, before eventually sacrificing himself to the Daleks to try and protect his friends. As luck would have it, Rose was able to restore him to life with the power of the Time Vortex, but it worked too well and endowed Jack with near immortality.</p>
<p>2  Professor River Song
Proto-Time Lord Born At Demons Run</p>
<p>River Song, or Melody Pond as her birth parents named her, was stolen from her parents by the Silence in order to activate latent parts of her DNA. Despite having two human parents, Amelia Pond, and Rory Williams, she was conceived in the TARDIS while it traveled through the Time Vortex. This anomaly meant that she was imbued with Time Lord DNA, which the Silence activated and used to turn her into their own personal assassin. Eventually, she breaks this control and marries the Doctor in an act of defiance and while they tend to go on their adventures independently, traveling through time in opposite directions, they overlap a lot.</p>
<p>1  Nardole
Humanoid Cyborg With Unknown Origins</p>
<p>Nardole is unsure of his own origins as he states he was found, however, much of his life was spent as a criminal and con artist for hire. Eventually, he came to work for River Song, and she assigned him to care for the Doctor following her death in the library. The Twelfth Doctor relied on Nardole for companionship as he guarded Missy, before he eventually started traveling with Bill Potts. Nardole continued to adventure with the Doctor until he eventually moved on to protect people onboard a large colony ship from the Cybermen.</p>
