# Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Made The Right Choice Cutting 1 Romance Subplot From The Books


## SUMMARY 



  Percy Jackson focuses more on family and friendship, rather than romantic relationships, and the show follows this by cutting Annabeth&#39;s feelings for Luke.   Annabeth&#39;s crush on Luke is not included in the Disney&#43; show, which is a good decision as it doesn&#39;t add much to the story and would complicate her relationship with Percy.   The show is better off building the bond between Percy and Annabeth without the unnecessary drama of a love triangle.

## Literature Review
A minor romance subplot from the Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians books is missing from the Disney show, and that’s actually for the best.

Warning: Minor SPOILERS ahead for Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1 and the books.



Summary

  Percy Jackson focuses more on family and friendship, rather than romantic relationships, and the show follows this by cutting Annabeth&#39;s feelings for Luke.   Annabeth&#39;s crush on Luke is not included in the Disney&#43; show, which is a good decision as it doesn&#39;t add much to the story and would complicate her relationship with Percy.   The show is better off building the bond between Percy and Annabeth without the unnecessary drama of a love triangle.  







Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians is slowly building the relationship between the titular hero and Annabeth Chase, and the Disney&#43; show has made the right choice leaving out one romance subplot from the books. While there are relationships in Rick Riordan&#39;s novels, Percy Jackson focuses more heavily on themes of family and friendship. The show is following in the source material&#39;s footsteps in that regard, even as it alludes to Percy and Annabeth developing feelings for one another.

In the Percy Jackson books, there are suggestions that Annabeth has feelings for someone else, complicating the romance blossoming between her and Percy. Fortunately, the Disney&#43; show doesn&#39;t seem to be including this layer of their relationship. Instead, it depicts mostly platonic bonds between the demigods at Camp Half-Blood. While Percy and Annabeth will break this trend, it&#39;s for the best that the other subplot goes unexplored.

 Annabeth Doesn&#39;t Seem To Have Feelings For Luke In The Percy Jackson Show 
The Books Reveal She Has A Crush On Him
          

Although the Percy Jackson books don&#39;t depict a full-on love triangle, they do occasionally allude to Annabeth having feelings for Luke, especially early on in the series. These feelings are made more complicated by The Lightning Thief&#39;s twist ending, which devastates Annabeth greatly. Nothing ever happens between Annabeth and Luke, but Percy gets jealous of the other demigod. Annabeth also outwardly admits she had a crush on Luke in The Mark of Athena, the third book in Riordan&#39;s Heroes of Olympus series.

Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians show hasn&#39;t suggested that Annabeth has feelings for Luke, painting a more platonic picture of their relationship. Luke refers to Annabeth as a &#34;sister,&#34; and she seems to view him in a similar light. It&#39;s possible she simply isn&#39;t discussing her feelings with Percy and Grover, but her brief interactions with Luke haven&#39;t shown any of the awkwardness that typically accompanies teenage crushes. As such, Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson seems to be changing this aspect of the books — and that&#39;s for the best.






 Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Cutting This Book Subplot Was The Right Choice 
Annabeth&#39;s Crush On Luke Doesn&#39;t Add To The Story
          



Having feelings for him won&#39;t change anything between the duo, but it will complicate her relationship with Percy.




Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show is making the right choice by cutting Annabeth&#39;s crush on Luke, as this romantic subplot doesn&#39;t add much to the story, even in the source material. Annabeth will be heartbroken at the end of Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1 regardless of whether she has romantic feelings for Luke or views him as a brother. Having feelings for him won&#39;t change anything between the duo, but it will complicate her relationship with Percy — something the TV show doesn&#39;t need to focus on amid more interesting storylines.




In addition to the fact that Annabeth&#39;s crush never goes anywhere, Luke is a bit older than Annabeth and Percy in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians. The demigod is 19 when the series opens, while Annabeth and Percy are both 12. This age gap would make any romantic subplot between the trio uncomfortable and inappropriate. And while Annabeth having unrequited feelings might be believable, such a revelation wouldn&#39;t have much of a point. Plus, it&#39;s almost more tragic that Annabeth views Luke as the family she never had. This means her family will disappoint her yet again.



 Why A Love Triangle Between Percy, Annabeth, &amp; Luke Wouldn&#39;t Work 
The Disney Show Doesn&#39;t Need Drama For The Sake Of Drama
         

The last thing Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians needs is a love triangle between Percy, Annabeth, and Luke — even if the latter isn&#39;t really invested. Love triangles in television shows and movies are overdone, and many of them are underwhelming. In the case of Percy Jackson, it would simply exist to complicate things between Percy and Annabeth for the sake of dramatic tension. Luke won&#39;t be around as much in later seasons of the Disney&#43; series, and his appearances will not leave time for romance. The series would be better off building Percy and Annabeth&#39;s bond, which can be refreshingly devoid of such drama.




Even with Annabeth&#39;s feelings for Luke in the books, she and Percy are among the least tumultuous couples out there. Removing Luke allows the Disney&#43; series to capitalize on that completely. In doing so, it can recognize that romance isn&#39;t at the heart of Riordan&#39;s story — and that love stories in teen shows don&#39;t always need to be weighed down by spectacle. Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians is doing a solid job of capturing Percy and Annabeth&#39;s bond already, and by removing Luke from the equation, it promises even more success on that front.
