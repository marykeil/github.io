“I want my Christmas presents for visa approval!&#34; David confessed. &#34;For Sheila. And happy year to all u fans people! Be safe with your family and friends for Christmas!” David added. Sheila and David are one of the most loved couples among the newcomers in the franchise. Sheila wears hearing aids. She had accidentally damaged her ear while she was playing with a broomstick when she was little. Sign language was something that was required for Sheila and David to communicate effortlessly in their relationship when they met in person. Sheila wasn&#39;t fluent in ASL and David had to hire an interpreter named Aimee to help them.


 

Sheila was jealous of Aimee and her efficiency with ASL. Meanwhile, Sheila was also worried about what David would think of her house, which had been damaged by a fire and a typhoon. David went to meet Sheila&#39;s family in a July 2023 episode, but when he woke up the next day, he woke up to the news of Sheila&#39;s mother&#39;s death. Ma Remedious died by falling off the stairs of the family home. The cost to fix the house was exorbitant, but David and Sheila were eventually able to make it habitable. Sheila, who didn&#39;t have a job due to COVID-19 set up her sari-sari shop to make an income.




Sheila wanted to marry David in the Philippines with her family in attendance, but they were advised against doing it because of the long waiting period of three to four years for a spousal visa. David and Sheila then decided against it and applied for a K-1 visa instead, which would take a year or two. Unfortunately, Sheila&#39;s visa has not been approved yet which means David will have to wait longer to welcome her home. David and Sheila&#39;s K-1 visa journey could help them get cast in 90 Day Fiancé season 11 after their successful 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days adventure.
