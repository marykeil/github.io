Summary

  Ne-Yo strategically chose to compete as the female Cow on The Masked Singer to keep his identity hidden from the panelists and host.   Despite having personal relationships with some of the panelists and host Nick Cannon, Ne-Yo wanted to fool them by disguising himself as Cow.   Ne-Yo&#39;s performances on The Masked Singer showcased his distinct style, infectious charisma, and extraordinary talent, making him one of the greatest contestants in the show&#39;s history.  







The Masked Singer season 10 winner Ne-Yo chose to compete as the female Cow, and he now explains that it was a strategic move to keep his identity a secret from the panelists-Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger--and host, Nick Cannon. During the season finale, Ne-Yo took home the Golden Mask Trophy, with John Schneider (Donut) as the runner-up. Janel Parrish (Gazelle) placed third, while Macy Gray (Sea Queen) came in fourth.

In an interview with EW, Ne-Yo explained how his female Cow costume helped him hide his identity from the panelists and Nick. He revealed that he took on Cow&#39;s persona &#34;in an attempt to throw them off. I have a million speaking voices. I can change it, I can do accents, I can do different inflections and everything with my speaking voice. My singing voice kind of is what it is, though. There&#39;s no way around it.&#34; Ne-Yo explained that he has &#34;personal relationships&#34; with Robin, Nicole, and Nick, and he knew that they&#39;d guess him immediately when they heard him sing. He wanted to fool them, so he became the female Cow.

 Ne-Yo Reveals Why He Was So Playful With Nick Cannon On Stage 
          

Throughout The Masked Singer season 10, Ne-Yo joked around with Nick on stage. Nick even commented that Cow probably knew him because he kept picking on him. Ne-Yo explained that he was &#34;doing it on purpose. I was getting such a kick out of the fact that he had no clue. I&#39;m like, I cannot believe that he doesn&#39;t recognize me. Okay, cool. So I&#39;m going to mess with him now. I kept tapping him and playing with him. I was having a lot of fun with it.&#34; Ne-Yo shared that when Nick actually disputed the panelists&#39; guess of his identity, even when he was standing right next to him, he knew that he was &#34;home free.&#34;





 

Ne-Yo really brought Cow to life with his voice and mannerisms. Because he grew up in a house full of women, it was easy for him to channel that kind of energy. Although it was difficult to identify him when he spoke, his singing voice was unmistakable. Ne-Yo brought his distinct style of singing and dancing to the Masked Singer stage in performances that included &#34;Bones&#34; by Imagine Dragons, &#34;Treasure&#34; by Bruno Mars, &#34;Cry Me a River&#34; by Justin Timberlake, &#34;Ring My Bell&#34; by Anita Ward, &#34;Rhythm Nation&#34; by Janet Jackson, and &#34;Take a Bow&#34; by Rihanna, a song which he co-wrote. His routines were effortless, and he lit up the stage with his infectious charisma and extraordinary talent.

As The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Cow, Ne-Yo fooled half of the panelists. Jenny thought that he was Billy Porter, while Ken theorized that he was Usher. However, Robin and Nicole guessed Ne-Yo correctly, which made sense because he&#39;s friends with both of them. Ne-Yo did a great job of disguising his true identity, so that even his friends doubted if they were correct when they guessed him throughout the season. Ne-Yo brought so much magic to The Masked Singer season 10. He&#39;s one of the greatest performers in the show&#39;s history.
