  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>TV shows often introduce plotlines that are later dropped without any resolution.
Examples include the character of Caitlin in Heroes and the warp speed limits in Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Lost and The Simpsons also had unresolved plot elements, such as Walt&rsquo;s mysterious powers and Principal Skinner&rsquo;s true identity.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Some TV shows set up storylines that appear promising and important, only to drop them at a later date with no clarification about what happened.</p>
<p>Some TV shows set up dozens of threads and plotlines, only to drop some without a trace and move in a different direction. To be clear, this is not about shows where there is a promising setup, but it&rsquo;s unable to complete it because the show was canceled too soon, but actual plot devices that were left behind with no resolution. When a TV show is being made, and at each point in the production process, new ideas and storylines can be introduced, not every idea is strong enough or has a worthwhile ending, so some shows choose to just forget and move on.
However, there are few things more frustrating than when a TV show sets up a promising storyline, and then completely moves beyond it without any further acknowledgment. Laying a trail of breadcrumbs for some big conflict or a mystery reveal, only to drop the thread and ignore that it ever happened. Plenty of shows do this, introducing an interesting new rule for how space travel works, only to never reference it again, or revealing a prominent character isn&rsquo;t who they said they were, only to go back on it in the following episodes and pretend it never happened.</p>
<p>10  Caitlin Stuck In The Apocalypse
Heroes (2006 - 2010)</p>
<p>Heroes was a promising series that was plagued with bad luck with delays and cuts due to writers&rsquo; strikes, and the series unfortunately struggled to keep its momentum after the second season. As a result of this inconsistency, one character was left in limbo. When Peter Petrelli accidentally took Caitlin to the plague-ridden future, and he was compelled to return to the present, she became trapped there. When Peter returned to the present and prevented that future, it became entirely unclear what happened to Caitlin, and whether she survived, or became a victim of the future, never to be seen or heard from again.</p>
<p>Heroes<br>
Heroes sees a number of people drawn to each other after a solar eclipse awakens incredible abilities in them. With their destinies seemingly intertwined, these evolved humans use their superpowers to influence the past, present, and future - for better and for worse. When a superpowered killer emerges who is stealing abilities from his victims, they must band together to stop him.</p>
<p>9  Warp Speed Limits
Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987 -1994)</p>
<p>Star Trek: TNG was a revelation for the series and became many people&rsquo;s first contact with the franchise. Throughout TNG, new worlds, new aliens, and new aspects of Starfleet and its operations were explored. With so many new elements being introduced, it makes sense that some things fall by the wayside, such as the natural laws and limitations on warp speed that were introduced in TNG season 7, episode 9, &ldquo;Force of Nature.&rdquo; After discovering the ill effects of passing warp five, a galactic speed limit was introduced, only to be mentioned twice more that season and then dropped forever.</p>
<p>Star Trek: The Next Generation<br>
Star Trek: The Next Generation is the third installment in the sci-fi franchise and follows the adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew members of the USS Enterprise. Set around one hundred years after the original series, Picard and his crew travel through the galaxy in largely self-contained episodes exploring the crew dynamics and their own political discourse. The series also had several overarching plots that would develop over the course of the isolated episodes, with four films released in tandem with the series to further some of these story elements.</p>
<p>7 Great TV Shows Where Every Episode Is The Same
While repetitiveness can be a killer for a TV show, there are some great examples of shows that brilliantly nailed their respective formulas.</p>
<p>8  Walt&rsquo;s Mysterious Powers
Lost (2001 - 2010)</p>
<p>Lost explored several mysterious happenings throughout its six-season run, but while some mysteries got explanations, others were ignored. The most egregious example of this comes with Walt&rsquo;s character, the only child from the plane crash. He was a prominent part of the show in season 1 when Walt began to exhibit strange psychic powers. By season 2, Walt&rsquo;s character faded into the background to a more minor role, which continued to be reduced each season until he didn&rsquo;t even appear in the last season. And after season 2, there was no further exploration of his powers.</p>
<p>Lost<br>
Lost is a mystery drama series created for TV that follows a group of survivors of a plane crash and tells its story between the past, present, and future via flashbacks. When Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 crashes and lands on a mysterious island in the pacific ocean, the castaways discover their new temporary home may have a mind of its own, as strange supernatural events keep them locked to the island. From an unknown black smoke creature to dangerous islanders, the passengers must work together to survive the island&rsquo;s seemingly deadly intentions.</p>
<p>7  Armin Tamzarian
The Simpsons (1989 - Present)</p>
<p>The Simpsons have told hundreds of stories since 1989, but some ideas are left in the past without any further reference. One example of this came almost 10 years into the show&rsquo;s running, in season 9, episode 2, &ldquo;The Principal and the Pauper.&rdquo; The episode revealed that Principal Skinner, who had been a large part of the show from the very first episode, was an impostor by the name of Armin Tamzarian. Despite this huge revelation, the fact that Skinner is not Skinner has been ignored ever since, which is probably for the best.</p>
<p>The Simpsons<br>
The Simpsons is a long-running animated TV series created by Matt Groening that satirically follows a working-class family in the misfit city of Springfield. Homer, a bit of a schmoe who works at a nuclear power plant, is the provider for his family, while his wife, Marge, tries to keep sanity and reason in the house to the best of her ability. Bart is a born troublemaker, and Lisa is his super-intelligent sister who finds herself surrounded by people who can&rsquo;t understand her. Finally, Maggie is the mysterious baby who acts as a deus ex machina when the series calls for it. The show puts the family in several wild situations while constantly tackling socio-political and pop-culture topics set within their world, providing an often sharp critique of the subjects covered in each episode. This series first premiered in 1989 and has been a staple of Fox&rsquo;s programming schedule ever since.</p>
<p>6  The GS Ball
Pokémon (1997 - 2023)</p>
<p>Early in the Pokémon series run, the show introduced a mysterious gold and white Pokéball, the GS Ball. Initially, the ball appeared prominently for a few episodes, and with multiple professors trying to uncover its secrets, it appeared as though it would play an important role in the story. However, fans were disappointed when the ball was later given to Kurt and forgotten about for the remainder of the more than 1,000 episodes. The ball did appear in the games, and the original plan was eventually revealed (via Game Rant), but the show never resolved the mystery.</p>
<p>5  Quaithe Of Qarth
Game Of Thrones (2011 - 2019)</p>
<p>During the second season of Game of Thrones, Daenerys spends much of her time in the merchant city of Qarth. While there, she becomes embroiled in the politics of the city and crosses paths with a mysterious masked woman named Quaithe. The introduction of Quaithe, and the lack of expanding on her in-depth knowledge about the inner workings of the city were never explored after they left the city, despite the character feeling like a setup for something potentially bigger and more important. In fact, the entire city of Qarth is ignored after season 2.</p>
<p>Game Of Thrones<br>
Created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Game of Thrones is a TV series based on the book “A Song of Ice of Fire” by George R. R. Martin. It tells the story of the ongoing battle between the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros - as they fight for control of the coveted Iron Throne. Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the far north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night&rsquo;s Watch, led by House Stark&rsquo;s Jon Snow, is the first to encounter icy horrors that threaten all realms of men. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and quickly became one of the biggest event series in the &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; of TV. Winner of 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international fan base.</p>
<p>8 Massive TV Show Plot Twists That Were Clearly Not Planned In Advance
Plot twists can make or break their TV shows, and some aren’t planned from the very beginning, which can make them memorable for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>4  The Doctor&rsquo;s Daughter
Doctor Who (2005 - Present)</p>
<p>In the 60 years since Doctor Who began, there have been countless plots and stories making it near impossible for Doctor Who to have a consistent story free of plotholes. However, in the modern series, season 4, episode 6, &ldquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; the show introduced a character who was technically a clone/genetic offspring of the Doctor. Near the end of the episode, it appeared that she was dead, but, thanks to Time Lord DNA, Jenny, recovered with regeneration energy and flew off into space, creating a loose end that begged to be explored, and never came back.</p>
<p>Doctor Who<br>
Originally premiered in 1963, Doctor Who is a sci-fi series that follows a powerful being known as a Time Lord, referred to as the Doctor. Using an interdimensional time-traveling ship known as the TARDIS, the Doctor travels time and space with various companions as they solve multiple problems and help avert catastrophe as much as they almost cause it. Though the Doctor is always the same character, they experience regenerations, allowing them to be recast every few seasons as a unique immortal being with new personality traits.</p>
<p>3  The Suicide Squad
Arrow (2012 - 2020)</p>
<p>Large IPs like DC contain a huge library of characters to explore for film and TV, but things can get complicated if characters are due to appear in a film, and the shows need to change their plans to free the characters up. This is what happened in the case of the Suicide Squad, an obscure team of villains who were being set up to appear in Arrow during seasons 2 and 3. Despite introducing several of the team members, the show had to kill them off ahead of movies starring the characters and thus had to change its plans.</p>
<p>Arrow<br>
After five years of being presumed dead, billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) is discovered alive on a remote island in the Pacific. Upon returning to his hometown, Starling City, Oliver beings to make amends for the selfish man that he once was. With a renewed sense of life, Oliver plays the role of a self-indulgent socialite during the day while secretly taking on those who corrupt the city at night. After running for eight seasons on The CW, Arrow ended in 2020.</p>
<p>2  Heath Literally Disappears
The Walking Dead (2010 - 2022)</p>
<p>Heath is a major character in The Walking Dead graphic novels, and when he showed up in season 6 of the TV show, fans were excited to finally see the character. However, the following season, Heath and Tara go on a supply run and run into a horde of zombies. In the struggle, Heath falls from a bridge and into the fast-moving water, quickly disappearing. The show has frequently featured characters disappearing only to return at a later date, but Heath never came back, and his fate was left unaccounted for in The Walking Dead or its spin-offs.</p>
<p>The Walking Dead<br>
Based on one of the most successful and popular comic books of all time, AMC’s The Walking Dead captures the ongoing human drama following a zombie apocalypse. The series, developed for television by Frank Darabont, follows a group of survivors, led by police officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), who are traveling in search of a safe and secure home. However, instead of the zombies, it is the living who remain that truly become the walking dead. The Walking Dead lasted for eleven seasons and spawned several spinoff shows, such as Fear the Walking Dead and The Walking Dead: World Beyond. </p>
<p>1  Fez And Laurie&rsquo;s Marriage
That &rsquo;70s Show (1998 - 2006)</p>
<p>When Fez is facing deportation in That &rsquo;70s Show season 5, the Foreman&rsquo;s daughter, Laurie, agrees to marry him. The relationship is obviously one that was manufactured to help Fez out of a tough spot, but the show continues to play with their relationship throughout season 6 before Laurie moves to Canada and the series, and Fez, forgets about her. For the remainder of the show, the character is absent, and this is noted in the series finale when Kitty asks &ldquo;has anyone seen Laurie?,&rdquo; but there&rsquo;s no resolution about whether Fez and Laurie divorced or if they remained married.</p>
<p>That &rsquo;70s Show<br>
That ‘70s Show was one of Fox’s most popular sitcoms upon its release in 1998. Starring Topher Grace (Eric Forman), Laura Prepon (Donna Pinciotti), Mila Kunis (Jackie Burkhart), Danny Masterson (Steven Hyde), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez), and Ashton Kutcher (Michael Kelso), That ‘70s Show revolves around the teens’ mishaps as they grow up in Point Place Wisconsin in the 1970s.</p>
