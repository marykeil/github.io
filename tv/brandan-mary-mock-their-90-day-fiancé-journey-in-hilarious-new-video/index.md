## Literature Review
Now that 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Brandan and Mary confirmed they&#39;re still together, they&#39;re openly making fun of their storyline from The Other Way season 5.




Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay poked fun at their 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 storyline in a rib-tickling video. Brandan, 23, was going through a breakup when he met Mary, also 23, who had been cheated on by her boyfriend. Mary also had trust issues because her parents had abandoned her and her brother when they were little children. Brandan was Mary’s dream man. According to Mary, he was a cross between her crushes Justin Bieber and Harry Potter. Mary feared Brandan would leave her too. She wanted to be on a 24/7 video call with Brandan during their two-year long-distance relationship.




Mary didn’t stop being jealous when Brandan moved to the Philippines, but things seem to have changed now since the couple is making fun of Mary’s obsessiveness in Brandan&#39;s Instagram Stories.

          

Brandan posted a short clip of them lip-syncing to a funny audio. Brandan wore a white printed shirt with black tropical leaves while Mary sat behind him wearing a blue dress and playing with her nails. “You’re the most jealous woman I know,” Brandan mouthed, but Mary looked at him with suspicious eyes and asked, “You know other women?”

 Brandan &amp; Mary&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

The TikTok trend seems to have been inspired by a scene from the Japanese yaoi drama series Cherry Magic! Thirty Years of Virginity Can Make You a Wizard?! Brandan and Mary are quite active on TikTok and often repost their top-performing content for their Instagram fans to see. They made headlines for their toxic relationship after their 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 debut. Mary wanted to be on a video call with Brandan while he was visiting the dentist or even when he ate, took a bath, visited the bathroom, or was sleeping. Mary didn’t want Brandan to meet his mother because she lived with female roommates.


 




Brandan’s relationship with his half-sister was also affected. While Brandan was on his way to the Philippines, he got a seat next to a female passenger on a flight from Eugene to Los Angeles. Brandan filmed a video from his seat and texted Mary after getting Wi-Fi on the plane. Once she found out he was sitting next to a woman, Mary was angry at Brandan and even made him switch seats. If Brandan thought Mary was clingy just because they were in different countries, she continuously reminded him, &#34;Don&#39;t look at girls,&#34; instructing him to only look at her and the priest when she brought him to her church.

Brandan told the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cameras, &#34;It can&#39;t be like this forever,” and confronted Mary and told her, “I’m willing to learn, but I don’t want to be forced into submission,” after mass. Mary admitted, “Every time I love people, I am afraid they will just leave me behind,” and got a panic attack. However, Brandan put his foot down and warned Mary that she would have to learn to trust him, or he was going back home to the U.S. Brandan and Mary have been married for the last nine months and are parents to a 5-month-old baby daughter Midnight.
