## Literature Review
Ashley Tolbert, also known as player 278 on Squid Game: The Challenge, rubbed some players the wrong way during Glass Bridge. Who is she?




Many fan favorites have emerged from Squid Game: The Challenge, but one contestant, Ashley Tolbert (278), garnered some enemies after episodes 6-9 were released on Netflix. After not agreeing to the teamwork strategy in Glass Bridge, only one contestant seemed to notice her refusal to adhere to the team spirit: top 3 Squid Game: The Challenge finalist Mai Whelan. Mai&#39;s attempt at getting 278 eliminated after the dice game was unsuccessful, but Ashley received the villain edit online after the last set of episodes was released.




Before refusing to be a team player in Glass Bridge, Ashley was best known for her close friendship with Phalisia (229). The two complained about Gganbu Gang people of similar ages, races, genders, and backgrounds grouping but bonded over their own shared interests. After Phalisia took a chance and eliminated three key players, Ashley was forced to take out her friend in a game of marbles. Who is Ashley outside of Squid Game: The Challenge?


 Ashley&#39;s Age 
         

According to Netflix Tudum, Ashley is 30 years old. One unique element of Squid Game: The Challenge is the contestants&#39; relative diversity compared to other reality TV shows. While representation on reality TV has a long way to go, the 456 contestants were much more diversified than other television shows. Ashley&#39;s age puts her on the younger side of the contestants, who ranged in age from their 20s through 60s.






 Ashley&#39;s Job 
          



 
Ashley reveals more about her life through several talking heads on Squid Game: The Challenge. The 30-year-old mother is a Civil Rights Investigator working for the US Department of Health and Human Services, a job she has held since 2019. According to Ashley&#39;s LinkedIn profile, she was previously a graduate research assistant at Emory University and Morehouse School of Medicine during her studies from 2016 to 2018. In addition to her work, she speaks Chinese and enjoys doing puzzles.



 Ashley&#39;s Instagram 

 

Ashley can be found on Instagram @a_tolb. Her latest posts on the page focus on her time on Squid Game: The Challenge, even posing with pal Phalisia and making fun of herself by proposing t-shirts that read #NotATeamPlayer. In her bio, the current Squid Game: The Challenge villain asserts she is a &#34;homie. lover. friend.&#34; and showcases the person who does her hair. She also has a Cameo and product collections for fans to peruse. Despite her status as a villain, she&#39;s making moves to gain influencer status after the show.






 Ashley&#39;s Hometown 
          

Ashley was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. However, the civil rights investigator went to a predominantly white university, Smith College, for her undergraduate studies, which was a massive cultural shift for Ashley. After college, she moved back to Atlanta to pursue graduate studies, where she now lives and works for the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.



 How Far Does Ashley Go On Squid Game: The Challenge? 
          

Despite being the direct reason for fan-favorite Trey&#39;s (301) elimination due to her refusal to be a team player in Glass Bridge, Ashley doesn&#39;t quite crack the top 3. After making it through the dice game, despite Mai&#39;s attempt to eliminate her, Ashley loses her circle of trust. Despite her effort to eliminate Phill when chosen to deliver the gift box, he correctly guesses she placed the present on his desk, and she goes home. Perhaps Phill is uncommonly good at reading body language, or it was bad karma, but Ashley was eliminated right before crossing the finish line.




While Trey went home early, Ashley earned the chance to solidify herself as a reality TV villain and ultimately made the top 9 but couldn&#39;t reach the top 3. However, casting Ashley as the villain may not be exactly fair. She never agreed to play by the team player rules in Glass Bridge, and as the game got closer to the top 3, it was understandable for her to make wise moves. Ashley nearly made it to the top 3, and Phill got lucky by guessing she gave him the gift. Anybody chasing $4.56 million is bound to get cutthroat and messy. Nevertheless, who wins Squid Game: The Challenge is still in the air, but it won&#39;t be Ashley.



The Squid Game: The Challenge finale airs on Netflix on Wednesday, December 6, 2023.
