## Literature Review
2023 has been a huge year for reality TV programming. With things coming to a close, here are the ten best reality TV series of the year, ranked!




2023 has been a huge year for reality TV, providing some of the best moments of television all year long. Reality TV has been one of the most integral parts of the entertainment industry throughout 2023, especially after the long-drawn-out industry strikes that lasted from the summer through the late fall. From the bombshell-dropping Vanderpump Rules season 10 to the brand-new series, 90 Day: The Last Resort, there were reality TV series that piqued viewers&#39; interest in every vertical throughout the year. While the style of programming has shifted in the last decade, the discourse around reality TV has changed tremendously.
As viewers, we used to look to reality TV as something sensational and outlandish, but in recent years, reality TV has been far more about watching a reflection of our own lives. Reality TV, regardless of the premise, brings some of the most core problems a person can face to the forefront and makes them more grandiose and entertaining. Tackling fundamental issues, reality TV has been a source of comfort for many during the long industry strikes. With so many reality TV series bringing their a-game in 2023, the top ten were difficult to narrow down.
