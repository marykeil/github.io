# Bridgerton Season 3 Needs To Deviate From Eloises Book Story For Good


## SUMMARY 



  Eloise&#39;s investigation into Lady Whistledown&#39;s identity sets her apart from her book counterpart and gives her a purpose that she never had before.   Bridgerton season 2 changed Eloise&#39;s relationship with Penelope, allowing them to develop as individual characters and enriching their friendship.   Eloise&#39;s romantic interest in the books, Phillip Crane, may not work in the TV show due to changes in the storyline, and it would be better for Eloise to find someone new after pursuing her own purpose.

## Literature Review
The differences between TV show Eloise and book Eloise make them almost separate characters, prompting Bridgerton S3 to continue with the changes.




Warning! SPOILERS for the Bridgerton books ahead.




Eloise’s investigation into Lady Whistledown’s identity made sure her storylines were relatively central in Bridgerton seasons 1 and 2, and in doing so it also established her as a much different character from how she was in Julia Quinn’s books. Although Bridgerton’s nature as a TV show made it easier to focus on multiple characters’ stories at once unlike the original book series, where each book focused on a different sibling, seasons 1 and 2 remained relatively faithful to the characters as Quinn’s books introduced them. However, Eloise carved a path for herself in Bridgerton seasons 1 and 2 that already set her apart from book Eloise.

The changes Bridgerton introduced to the stories of Daphne, Anthony, Colin, and Benedict until now enriched them, only adding detail to their journeys while all in all keeping their defining characteristics similar to those of their book counterparts. With Eloise only defined as a relatively happy spinster who was never too far from Penelope Featherington in the novels, Netflix’s Bridgerton had more room to maneuver in the building of her character. However, many of the Bridgerton season 2 events, from her society debut to her rift with Penelope, contributed to Eloise’s portrayal greatly differing from her book version, making the continuation of Eloise’s changes in Bridgerton season 3 necessary.





 Bridgerton Season 2 Set Up A Different Path For Eloise 
         

To Sir Phillip, With Love, the book focusing on Eloise’s story, is only the fifth novel in the Bridgerton series, and the setup for Eloise’s big escape from London to reach Sir Phillip in Gloucestershire was secretly put in place already in Penelope and Colin’s book, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton. However, the reasoning behind Eloise and Phillip’s epistolary relationship is the Bridgertons’ connection to Marina’s family, leading Eloise to write to Phillip after Marina’s death in the books. Not only is the connection between Eloise and Phillip nonexistent in the series but it would be extremely difficult for Eloise to sneak out to write to him, having just debuted in society.

Eloise repeatedly emphasized throughout Bridgerton seasons 1 and 2 how she wanted to do more than practice dancing or the other activities young ladies debuting in society needed to master. Besides highlighting the lack of options like higher education or grand tours for ladies, Eloise effectively spent most of Bridgerton seasons 1 and 2 investigating Lady Whistledown, with the search giving her a purpose her book version never had. Finding out the truth about her at Bridgerton season 2’s ending not only drastically changed her relationship with Penelope, but also proved Eloise’s abilities and hunch right, making her focused on something unlike her book counterpart.






 It’s Good That Bridgerton Isn’t Sticking To Eloise’s Book Story 
          

Bridgerton season 2’s fight between Eloise and Penelope changed their dynamic, but it can also give them the chance to learn who they are without each other, enriching their friendship and making them even more multidimensional characters. Unlike the series, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton only has the two briefly ignore each other because Eloise was hurt by Penelope’s desire to get married, which she never had, always counting on remaining a spinster with Penelope forever. Penelope’s marriage to Colin made Eloise feel left out and alone, without Penelope as a safety net, effectively prompting her to run away to give her connection with Phillip a chance.

                  Bridgerton Secretly Revealed Lady Whistledown&#39;s Identity Within The First Episode&#39;s Opening 10 Minutes   While Bridgerton didn&#39;t reveal Lady Whistledown&#39;s identity until the season 1 finale, the show did hint at their real name much, much earlier.    




Eloise’s book version not being properly introduced before her book and choosing her fate in response to the fear of being a spinster alone wouldn’t do Bridgerton’s Eloise justice, especially as she already expressed very clear wishes against courtship or finding a husband in the TV show. Bridgerton moving away from such a storyline for Eloise would stop her from choosing something out of fear, and would also make her story more suited for the character she is in the TV show. Distancing itself from such a storyline, Netflix’s Bridgerton can let Eloise have the freedom to choose love, possibly after finding her purpose in life as she clearly wanted.



 Why Eloise Needs A New Romantic Interest (That Isn’t Philip Or Theo) 
          

Phillip Crane as Eloise’s romantic interest in To Sir Phillip, With Love works in the books because Marina and the Cranes were never part of Julia Quinn’s Bridgerton books before then. However, Marina’s past entanglement with Colin and her connection to the Featheringtons rather than the Bridgertons in Netflix’s Bridgerton essentially make the possibility of Eloise contacting Phillip to express her condolences almost impossible, erasing the logic behind their connection. Their disdain for the ton is their biggest similarity in the books, and while that could potentially work in the series too, there could be many more romantic interests sharing the same disdain that Eloise could meet in London.




Bridgerton season 2’s Theo could potentially be one of them because Eloise met him through her investigation into Lady Whistledown and they bonded over women’s rights. However, because of their already checkered history and Whistledown’s words, pursuing a relationship would be far too loaded besides being frowned upon because of their belonging to different classes. While he could undoubtedly be a stepping stone for Eloise to understand that she might enjoy a bond with someone who shared her interests, it would be easier for Eloise to fall for someone new, and even better to do so after finding and pursuing her purpose, which is something she clearly wants in Bridgerton.



Bridgerton season 3, part 1 releases May 16, 2024 on Netflix, with part 2 following on June 13, 2024.
