## Literature Review
One of Farhana Bodi&#39;s Dubai Bling storylines revolved around her struggles to move on from her ex-husband, Heroies Havewalla, after their divorce. 




Dubai Bling star Farhana Bodi&#39;s ex-husband, Heroies Havewalla, is younger than the reality TV star. Before making her debut on Dubai Bling, Farhana was already a wealthy and famous personality due to her successful fashion career. When fans met her on Dubai Bling, Farhana’s luxurious lifestyle and several feuds with her co-stars made her one of the show&#39;s standout characters. She also reprised her role in the recently released Dubai Bling season 2.




However, besides her feuds and motherhood journey, one of the things Farhana talked about during Dubai Bling season 1 was her reluctance to move on from her divorce from her ex-husband Heroies, whom she married in 2012. Four years later, the couple welcomed their son Aydin in 2016. Despite Farhana&#39;s heartbreaking marital status, she tried the dating scene again when she met and went on a date with boxer Mohammed Ali, but the relationship never developed. Nonetheless, the mother of one is currently single.
