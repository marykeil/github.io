# “Anti-Serialization” Was Voyagers Weakness Compared To DS9, Says Star Trek Discovery Creator


## SUMMARY 



Bryan Fuller believes that the lack of serialization in Star Trek: Voyager stifled character development and hindered the writing process.  

In contrast, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s serialized format allowed for the evolution and growth of its characters, which made the storytelling more effective.   

When Voyager did embrace serialization, it became richer in its storytelling and showcased the transition from a syndicated model to a modern cable model.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: Voyager could have hit its stride much earlier if it had embraced the serialized storytelling of its predecessor, Deep Space Nine. 




Star Trek: Discovery creator Bryan Fuller says &#34;anti-serialization&#34; was a weakness of Star Trek: Voyager, especially compared to its predecessor, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. DS9 wove a rich tapestry of stories about the Dominion War, centering the moral dilemmas inherent to maintaining Federation ideals at a time of political upheaval and strife, which necessitated a serialized format in order to be effective. Star Trek: Voyager, by contrast, rarely lingered in one part of space during its homeward quest, and Voyager&#39;s earlier stories reflected that steady pace onward by maintaining its characterization from week to week.




Bryan Fuller was a writer on Star Trek: Voyager before creating Star Trek: Discovery, which relies on modern serialized storytelling methods in its ambitious season-long arcs and is richer for recognizing its characters&#39; evolutions. In The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Fuller explains how the lack of serialization in Star Trek: Voyager stifled the development of its characters, ultimately also hindering the writing process as storylines had to be abandoned in favor of constant forward motion. Read Fuller&#39;s quote below:


The strength of DS9 was its serialization. Its ability to say this is an ongoing story and we have to see our characters evolve and change and grow. On Voyager, I remember we had an episode where B’Elanna Torres had kind of a religious reawakening and it was going to be a huge deal that this person, who was essentially a recovering Catholic, had turned her back on the Church and had no interest in being a part of it anymore, then has this fantastic experience where she sees the afterlife. She has a religious epiphany. To me, that was something so fascinating for this character to go through, because she is essentially having a confirmation of things that she had previously denied to herself and to everyone who would listen. Now she has to deal with religion becoming fact in her heart. But the storyline was just dropped. It was, like, here we have a character who can rediscover things and yet it was “No, you’re holding on to storylines from previous episodes and we have to move forward.” The weakness of Voyager in its anti-serialization was the strength of DS9. And when Voyager did embrace its serialized nature or a serialized nature it was more rich in its storytelling for it. It really was seeing a very early transition from a syndicated model into what is now more representative of a modern cable model.

Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s early attempts at serialization were sporadic at best, but Voyager improved when it allowed its characters to be affected by their circumstances instead of keeping them stagnant. Voyager&#39;s mixed Maquis and Starfleet crew should have been the source of more strife, but that aspect of its concept was quickly dropped, leaving only the discovery of Seska (Martha Hackett) as a Cardassian traitor as its sole ongoing storyline early on. After Seska&#39;s departure, Voyager hurried along its course to the Alpha Quadrant with characters that usually reset to their base models after single episode revelations, as Fuller describes.




The addition of Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) brought numerous changes to Star Trek: Voyager, including the adoption of more serialized storytelling. Voyager kept its self-contained episodes, but the concept of Seven as a Borg drone becoming a more realized human required serialization in order to work. Because Seven had to change, other Voyager characters were also free to begin developing beyond their initial templates, most evident in the relationship between Lt. Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) and Lt. B&#39;Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and the evolution of the Doctor (Robert Picardo). Fuller&#39;s comments reinforce character development as central to engaging storytelling, which Star Trek: Voyager achieved when it embraced serialization.
