## Literature Review
A former 90 Day Fiancé star is making a comeback to the franchise in 2024, but before that, she&#39;s shocking fans with her Selena Gomez look.




A popular 90 Day Fiancé star revealed a shocking makeover that fans think makes her look like Selena Gomez. 90 Day Fiancé season 1 premiered in 2014, and 26 spin-offs later, the popularity is still sky-high. There have been several 90 Day Fiancé cast members introduced to viewers in the past decade. Some of them have faded into obscurity with no recent updates, while there&#39;s still a lot of support for several despite them not having starred in any recent shows. Among them is a reality TV show star who was last seen on screen in 2022. She gets continuous questions from fans asking about her comeback.




As if turns out, Julia Trubkina is returning to the franchise very soon, possibly with a new Selena-inspired look.


 

Julia is from Krasnodar, Russia, and moved to the U.S. when she got engaged to Virginia-based Brandon Gibbs. Julia faced deportation threats sometime ago, but she&#39;s still in America and making her dreams come true. Julia recently posted an Instagram video that showed her before-and-after with a ravishing transformation. Julia posted the Reel in collaboration with a make-up artist, and it showed her lip-syncing to &#34;Darkside&#34; by Neoni before revealing her final look. Julia looked very different after the makeover with her straight hair now curled and her make-up featuring a glossy nude lip with dark eye make-up.

Someone told Julia, &#34;You are looking like Selena Gomez.&#34; A different fan added, &#34;Girl you should sign with the modeling agency.&#34; Julia&#39;s own mother-in-law also showed up in the comments to praise Brandon&#39;s wife. Betty thought Julia looked &#34;beautiful and enchanting!!&#34; after her makeover. Meanwhile, 90 Day Fiancé cast members Anny Francisco and Thaís Ramone also praised Julia&#39;s beauty.

While Julia keeps posting updates on her social media to talk about her life with Brandon, but she has been on screen lately. She often talks about the problems in her life, but she sometimes doesn&#39;t share what happens next, leading to a lot of concern. However, fans won&#39;t have to wait much longer to see Julia back on 90 Day Fiancé since she is soon joining Thaís on one of the spin-offs. Variety has confirmed that 90 Day Diaries season 5 is premiering in January, and Julia is a part of the cast with Brandon. Julia and Brandon will finally be able to share what they have been up to since 90 Day Diaries season 4.




90 Day Diaries documented Julia and Brandon planning to move to Florida. Brandon had even quit his job. However, the move didn&#39;t happen as he decided to stay close to home with his parents, and the couple got a house in Virginia Beach instead. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not like Julia has been living a happy life in the house. The couple has dealt with robbers, and she once got into a brawl with a neighbor who threatened to shoot the Russian woman. Julia has been through a lot of troubles since she arrived in the U.S., but her makeup videos and posts with Brandon give some assurance that she&#39;s now doing much better.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
