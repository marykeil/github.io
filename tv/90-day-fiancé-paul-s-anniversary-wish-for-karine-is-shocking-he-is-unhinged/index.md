## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Paul Staehle and Karine Martins were married for six years. Paul&#39;s anniversary wish for his estranged wife was extremely disturbing.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Paul Staehle is shocking fans with his odd anniversary wish for estranged wife Karine Martins. Paul, 40, and Karine, 27, are one of the most controversial couples in the franchise. Paul and Karine met online when they were introduced on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1. The Louisville man and the Brazilian woman, Karine, who lived along the Amazon River with her family struggled to communicate due to their language barrier. Despite their differences, they married in 2017 and welcomed their son Pierre in 2018.




Karine joined Paul in Kentucky in 2019, and their relationship issues have been escalating. Their second son, Ethan, was born in 2021 amid arguments about infidelity. In December 2021, a clip circulated online, showing Paul and Karine physically fighting inside their home, which caused Paul and Karine to lose custody of their sons. Ethan and Pierre are now with the same foster family. Paul and Karine began fighting for the custody of their kids; however, in August 2023, Karine claimed Paul had gone missing in Brazil. She even shared a cryptic post hinting Paul was dead. Paul returned to Instagram in September 2023, claiming he never went missing.

 Paul Calls Karine A &#34;Wh**e&#34; On Wedding Anniversary 

 




Paul’s anniversary wish for Karine on November 3, 2023, was unusual. Paul started by sharing a screenshot of Karine’s OnlyFans page, which showed a green dot next to her profile picture, suggesting she was active. Paul added a link to her page on his story. His next story contained a screenshot of Karine’s Unfiltrd page. It&#39;s a platform similar to OnlyFans, launched by 90 Day Fiancé cast member Stephanie Matto. Paul then proceeded to share photos from his and Karine’s November 3, 2017, wedding. Paul used the song “I Write Sins Not Tragedies” in the story.

He highlighted certain lyrics to Panic! at the Disco 2005 song (as shared by Reddit user u/Fabulous_Minute_9929.) Paul made sure the lyrics, “What a beautiful wedding,’ says a bridesmaid to a waiter / And yes, but what a shame / what a shame the poor groom’s bride is a wh*re,” were on the screen alongside three different photos from their wedding. Paul then shared three more pictures set to the tune of Bishop Bullwinkle’s “Hell To Da Naw Naw.” His final story was another link to Karine’s OnlyFans page.






 Does Paul Have Ulterior Motives? 
          

Paul’s stories make it look like he is not together with Karine. However, fans suspect Paul’s stories are desperate cries for attention. On the one hand, he shamed his wife by calling her a “wh*re” but on the other hand, he also promoted her adult modeling content by sharing multiple links. Paul and Karine used to create OF content together when they launched the account. Moreover, Paul’s confusing antics also remind viewers of the time when Karine posted about his “disappearance” and shared a video alluding to his death when he was very much alive. Paul’s stories about Karine could be him advertising her content so curious followers could subscribe.
