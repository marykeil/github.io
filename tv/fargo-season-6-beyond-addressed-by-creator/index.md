## Literature Review

Following the season 5 finale, creator Noah Hawley now addresses whether Fargo season 6 is on the cards and what the show’s future will be.




Fargo season 6 and beyond gets a response from series creator Noah Hawley. Loosely inspired by the 1996 Coen Brothers&#39; movie of the same name, Hawley&#39;s critically acclaimed crime drama anthology show first aired on FX in 2014. The Fargo season 5 finale recently brought the show&#39;s most recent outing to an end with a bang, and it&#39;s been unclear how or if the show will continue.




During a recent interview with THR, Hawley addresses whether Fargo season 6 and beyond is a possibility. While he is currently hard at work on bringing an Alien TV show to life, Hawley expresses interest in bringing another Fargo story to life at some point down the line. Check out his full comment below:


&#34;I have as many eyes as I can put on [Alien] right now, but when we had some time when the town shut down, my mind certainly wandered to Fargo again. But it’s not where I can put the front of my brain. I entered the fifth season thinking it would be the last one. Even telling FX that it was going to be the last one.
&#34;But I got it up on its feet and thought: Who am I kidding? This is such a rewarding arena to be constantly reinventing under the auspices of that word, Fargo, to do just about anything as long as it has a couple of elements in it. There are no restrictions, other than there has to be crime, and there has to be decency. Other than that, the sky’s the limit. I don’t have an idea at this moment, but, they seem to come.&#34;







Hawley&#39;s Alien TV show is set to resume filming this month after pausing due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. A release date is not yet set, but it likely won&#39;t hit screens until 2025. 




  


 Why Fargo Season 5 Shouldn&#39;t Be The End 
          

Season 1 of Hawley&#39;s crime drama is widely considered to be the show&#39;s best, though season 2 was also very warmly received. Fargo season 3 proved a little more divisive overall, and season 4 arguably lost a little of the show&#39;s magic. The season 5 reviews, however, have largely hailed the show&#39;s latest outing as a return to form. Praise has been heaped upon the Fargo season 5 cast and Hawley&#39;s smart, surprising storytelling, and the season as a whole is proof that there&#39;s still life left in the show&#39;s premise.




While a prospective season 6 would mean saying farewell to the characters of season 5, part of the beauty of the show is that each season is a new story with a new cast. Over the course of its 5-season run, Fargo has featured the acting talents of Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton, Jesse Plemons, Kirsten Dunst, Jean Smart, Nick Offerman, Carrie Coon, Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Chris Rock, Jon Hamm, and Juno Temple, among others, and season 6 would provide the opportunity for even more great actors to join the show.

Although the 1996&#39;s Fargo certainly didn&#39;t seem like a movie that demanded further exploration in the form of a series, Hawley has proven himself uniquely capable of capturing the Coens&#39; unique tone and voice, and mixing it with his own. The dark humor, oddball characters, and shocking moments of violence aren&#39;t done quite the same way in any other show. While Fargo may be done for now, it thankfully sounds like the series isn&#39;t gone for good.






All 5 seasons of Fargo are currently available to stream on Hulu.
