  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Big Brother Reindeer Games will include one Big Brother 25 houseguest. Here&rsquo;s a list of eight contestants who&rsquo;d be perfect for the competition series.</p>
<p>The new competition series Big Brother Reindeer Games will feature one Big Brother 25 houseguest, and there are eight contestants who would be perfect for the show. Big Brother 25 wrapped up on November 9 with Jag Bains winning the competition, Matt Klotz placing second, and Cameron Hardin winning the America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest prize on the milestone season. During the finale, host Julie Chen Moonves announced that Big Brother Reindeer Games will premiere on December 11 with nine Big Brother legends as contestants, and one Big Brother 25 houseguest will be selected to compete on the show. It will be a show with pre-taped competitions, rather than a social game.
According to EW, unlike a regular season of Big Brother, the contestants won&rsquo;t be living in the house and there will be no live feeds. Instead of Julie hosting, Big Brother icons Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will serve as &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Elves,&rdquo; and guide players through the show. In each episode, the contestants will play in three competitions that will culminate in &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Showdown,&rdquo; which determines which player will be eliminated. Four players will compete in the December 21 finale. The winner will take home the $100,000 prize. Here are eight Big Brother 25 who&rsquo;d be perfect for Big Brother Reindeer Games.

<p>8  Red Utley
Placed 13th on Big Brother 25</p>
<p>Red Utley, a 37-year-old salesman from Gatlinburg, TN, placed 13th on Big Brother 25. He had a big personality that was so much fun to watch. Although Red only won one competition during the season, he came through for himself and his Final 2 Chillers alliance member, Cameron Hardin, by winning the Power of Veto during week 4 when Cameron was HOH.
Red also proved himself on the Big Brother 25premiere during the Scary-Verse competition, when he focused completely on not being pulled into the Nether Region during the endurance competition. Red showed that he could excelat endurance competitions, with laser focus and amazing physical and mental strength. He also lasted for 10 hours and 8 minutes in the Pressure Cooker endurance HOH competition. Red would be a strong competitor in Big Brother Reindeer Games.</p>
<p>7  Reilly Smedley
Placed 15th on Big Brother 25</p>
<p>Although Reilly Smedley, a 24-year-old bartender, originally from Portland, ME, who currently resides in Nashville, TN, was evicted during Big Brother 25 week 2, she was a fan favorite who deserves a second chance to play. During the premiere night Scary-Verse endurance competition, Reilly was cool, calm, and collected, focusing all of her attention on not being pulled into the Nether Region. She then won the first HOH competition. However, her time in the Big Brother house was cut short when HOH Hisam Goueli targeted her the following week. Reilly had so much potential, and it would be wonderful to see her compete again.</p>
<p>6  Jared Fields
Placed 11th on Big Brother 25</p>
<p>Jared Fields, a 25-year-old exterminator from Norwalk, CT, placed 11th on Big Brother 25 after secretly playing the game with his mother, Survivor legend and The Traitors season 1 winner, Cirie Fields. During his time in the game, he won two HOH competitions and one Power of Veto. Without the pressure of keeping a huge secret, Jared could thrive on Big Brother Reindeer Games. He had the drive to succeed and was fantastic at competitions. Jared was always very determined to win, and took the game seriously.

<p>5  Hisam Goueli
Placed 14th on Big Brother 25</p>
<p>Hisam is a 45-year-old geriatric physician and psychiatrist who is originally from Minneapolis, MN, but currently resides in Seattle, WA. At night, he&rsquo;s a cabaret and burlesque performer. Hisam set out to prove that older contestants could be fierce Big Brother competitors, and he succeeded. Hisam was a competition beast in the first two weeks of the competition, but was evicted in week 3.
In just 23 days in the game, Hisam won one HOH and two Power of Veto competitions. He held all of the power in week 2 when he won both competitions. Hisam didn&rsquo;t have the best social game, so his own alliance turned on him. However, Big Brother Reindeer Games seems to be only about competitions, so Hisam could be the ideal contestant for the show.</p>
<p>4  Bowie Jane
Placed 3rd on Big Brother 25</p>
<p>Bowie Jane, a 45-year-old barrister by day and DJ by night, who is originally from Melbourne Australia, but now lives in Los Angeles, CA, was the third place finisher on Big Brother 25. After laying low for the first half of the game, Bowie eventually won three Head of Household (HOH) competitions. These were mental games that ended in tiebreakers. Without the pressures of the social aspect of the game to deal with, Bowie could perform well on Big Brother Reindeer Games. She has a sweet and funny demeanor that would be entertaining. Bowie would also use her competition skills in order to win.</p>
<p>3  Matt Klotz
Big Brother 25 Winner</p>
<p>Matt, a 27-year-old Deaflympics gold medalist originally from Cameron Park, CA, who currently lives in Baton Rouge, LA, placed second to his Final 2 Minutemen alliance member, Jag. For the premiere night Humili-Verse competition, the houseguests had to kick themselves in the butt 100 times with a giant boot by moving it with a lever. Matt took the Humili-Verse competition by storm, coming up with a great strategy and showing his physical prowess. He won the competition and kept himself safe from being nominated.
After being voted as a competitor by the fans, Matt also won the Power of Invincibility, which he used to save Jag from his unanimous eviction. During the season, Matt won one HOH and two Power of Veto competitions. Both vetoes were in the second half of double elimination episodes, which proved that Matt works well under intense pressure. Because of this, Matt would be an ideal Big Brother Reindeer Games contestant.

<p>2  Jag Bains
Big Brother 25 Winner</p>
<p>The second half of Big Brother 25 winner Jag&rsquo;s game was all about winning competitions. Because of this, he was able to keep the power in his hands for the last several weeks of the game. Jag, a 25-year-old truck company owner from Omak, WA, was excellent at both physical and mental games. He first proved himself on premiere night, when he won the BB Comics-Verse competition, in which the contestants had to connect wires from a table to a goo bomb, fitting them correctly. If it exploded, it was correct. Jag solved his puzzle almost immediately. He worked calmly and precisely, and had an impressive first place finish.
Jag proved his intelligence and focus from the very beginning. He went on to win three HOH and seven Power of Veto competitions. Although he didn&rsquo;t win it, he also lasted 12 hours and 50 minutes in the Pressure Cooker endurance HOH competition. Jag broke the record for the most single-season Power of Veto wins and the most single-season combined HOH and Power of Veto competition wins. He would clearly be perfect for a show like Big Brother Reindeer Games, which is all about winning competitions.</p>
<p>1  Cameron Hardin
Placed 9th on Big Brother 25 &amp; Was America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest</p>
<p>Cameron, a 34-year-old stay-at-home dad from Eastman, GA, dominated the first half of Big Brother 25, but his back was constantly against the wall as his alliance members kept betraying him because they saw him as a threat. Cameron was forced to win competitions because, when he didn&rsquo;t have power, he was nominated for eviction. This happened five times, and he eventually placed 9th in the competition.
During his time on Big Brother 25, Cameron won three HOH competitions, including the grueling Pressure Cooker endurance HOH competition, with an astonishing time of 13 hours and 49 minutes, just five minutes short of breaking the record set by Jennifer Vasquez in Big Brother 6. Cameron also won two Power of Veto competitions, including the Tiny Veto, which requires incredible stamina and patience.
Cameron was unanimously evicted from the Big Brother 25 house, but he fought his way back by besting Jared in the Resurrection Rumble. This allowed him to choose whether he&rsquo;d compete in the Do or Die competition, or pass it to Jared. Cameron chose to play, and he resurrected his game by winning. Throughout Big Brother 25, Cameron excelled at both physical and mental competitions, and was very impressive.
Cameron prided himself on having fun with the game, and making it entertaining for everyone. As a Big Brother superfan, he built his strategy from his knowledge of the game, and, at times, especially at the beginning of the season, it seemed like Cameron was the only one playing the game at all. Because of this, the fans voted Cameron America&rsquo;s Favorite Houseguest. It would be thrilling to see him compete again in Big Brother Reindeer Games, and it would give fans what they want - a second chance for Cameron.
Big Brother 25 had many other extraordinary players, including Cirie, Felicia Cannon, Blue Kim, Cory Wurtenberger, and America Lopez, but they weren&rsquo;t as strong at winning competitions as the houseguests mentioned above. They had impressive strategies and social games, but Big Brother Reindeer Games is a competition show. Therefore, the houseguests who are competition beasts should have the chance to play. Big Brother Reindeer Games can&rsquo;t go wrong if one of these eight houseguests returns to compete.</p>
