# The Bad Batch Season 3 May Have To Echo The Ending Of Another Tragic Star Wars Story


## SUMMARY 



  The Bad Batch season 3 needs to address the absence of Clone Force 99 during the Galactic Civil War, as they have not been shown outside of The Clone Wars or The Bad Batch.   Due to their unique abilities and previous encounters with the Empire, it&#39;s unlikely that Clone Force 99 simply stopped fighting. The finale will have to explain their continued absence in other Star Wars media during that time.   The possibility exists that The Bad Batch may need to share a tragic ending similar to Rogue One, potentially killing off all its main characters if they are not shown fighting for the Rebel Alliance.

## Literature Review
Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3 may have to adapt another Star Wars story&#39;s ending to keep continuity within the currently established canon.




Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3 may need to follow the tragic ending of one other Star Wars story. First entering Star Wars canon in 2021, the animated The Bad Batch series quickly became popular. Focusing on Clone Force 99 during the early days of the Empire, it is a refreshing break from Star Wars&#39; usual focus on the Jedi. The Bad Batch season 3 will be the show&#39;s final season, and after the dramatic ending of The Bad Batch season 2, season 3 has a lot of questions to answer.




The end of The Bad Batch season 2 was fraught with tragedy. From Tech sacrificing his life to save his squad to Omega&#39;s capture by the Empire, The Bad Batch season 2 finale proves the animated series will not shy away from exposing its heroes to devastating circumstances. Now that Omega and Crosshair are being detained in the same place, it&#39;s possible they can free themselves or be saved by their squadmates - but season 3 still has one important reality to address.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    


 Clone Force 99 Isn&#39;t Around During The Galactic Civil War 
          

One worrying detail is that Clone Force 99 has yet to be shown during the Galactic Civil War. This is odd, given the fact they have had multiple run-ins with the Empire. Not only that, but one of their members, Echo, already left to join Captain Rex in the earliest rebel efforts in season 2. It seems to reason, then, this early rebel cell would reach out to the Bad Batch at some point, given their unique abilities and defection from the Empire. Yet, Clone Force 99 hasn&#39;t been shown in canon once outside Star Wars: The Clone Wars or The Bad Batch.






 The Bad Batch Season 3 Will Have To Explain Their Absence 
         

Because season 3 will be the show&#39;s finale, it must explain why Clone Force 99 wasn&#39;t shown in the Galactic Civil War. It&#39;s unlikely that Clone Force 99 simply stopped fighting. While it&#39;s true they have Omega to think about, she has proven herself capable, and she is unwilling to live a quiet life. When Hunter tries to leave her with the defected clone Cut Lawquane and his wife, Suu, so that the girl can live a normal life, she refuses to stay. She is insistent on staying with Clone Force 99 even though it is more dangerous.

Further, while season 1 mainly focused on them taking jobs to earn credits, season 2 pitted them directly against the Empire. With Omega being kidnapped and Crosshair becoming angry with the Empire, it&#39;s unlikely the remaining members of Clone Force 99 will continue to avoid joining the rebels. The Empire has made this too personal and has proven they aren&#39;t going to just let them go. This sets up the clones taking a stand in the fight against the Empire. Seeing as this is the setup for season 3, the finale will have to explain why they haven&#39;t been shown in other Star Wars media set during that time.






 The Bad Batch May Have To Share Rogue One&#39;s Tragic Ending 
          

 Star Wars Galactic Event  Date   The Bad Batch defects after Order 66  19 BBY   The Galactic Civil War begins  4 BBY   The Rebel Alliance officially unifies  2 BBY   The Galactic Civil War ends  5 ABY   



Since they are not shown anywhere during the Galactic Civil War, The Bad Batch may need to echo Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&#39;s tragic ending and kill off all its main characters. Given the large stake the Bad Batch has in fighting against the Empire, there would be no easy reason for them to avoid the Rebellion effort aside from death itself. Further, the precedent for killing off the show&#39;s main characters was already set when the show killed off Tech at the end of season 2.




Since Star Wars tends to jump around in the timeline, there&#39;s still a possibility the Bad Batch will show up in another piece of Star Wars media set during the time of the Galactic Civil War. Just as the Ghost appeared in the background of a Rogue One scene, other canon movies and TV shows could feature Clone Force 99 in a cameo, thus making their survival and role in the Galactic Civil War canon. Until that happens, however, The Bad Batch season 3 will either have to feature their deaths or come up with some other way to explain why they aren&#39;t fighting for the Rebel Alliance.



Star Wars: The Bad Batch is available to stream on Disney&#43;.
