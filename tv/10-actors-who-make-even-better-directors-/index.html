  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Acting experience can greatly benefit directors in working with actors and creating empathetic and understanding experiences on set.
Several actors-turned-directors, such as Regina King and Clint Eastwood, have proven their skills in both fields and have left a significant impact on the film industry.
Transitioning from acting to directing allows for greater involvement in the creative process and the opportunity to explore personal interests and storytelling.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Directing and acting both take skill and commitment, so it&rsquo;s no wonder so many performers turn to directing and helm memorable films.</p>
<p>When an actor crosses over to work behind the camera, it’s not always a success, but these actors have proven they have a great eye and the skills to make excellent movies. Every aspect of filmmaking is vital to the creation of the finished project, but directing is a significant task that requires overseeing many moving parts. Making the transition from acting to directing, or vice versa, can be a shock, but it can also open up the world of the creator and lead to fantastic projects the world would be worse off without.
Working as an actor before moving to directing can provide vital skills for working with actors and helping them achieve their best performances. A director with the knowledge of what it feels like to be in front of the camera creates a more empathetic and understanding experience for both parties. Often, these actor-director powerhouses are also interested in writing their own work, so they can be as involved in the process of creation as possible.</p>
<p>10 Famous Directors Who Are Secretly Better Actors
They may be better known for their work behind the camera, but these filmmakers have a surprising amount of screen presence and dramatic chops.</p>
<p>10  Regina King
One Night In Miami&hellip; (2020), Let The Church Say Amen (2013), Scandal (2012 - 2018)</p>
<p>Regina King has proved herself a jack-of-all-trades many times over, with great performances across a myriad of genres, and iconic voice work as well. However, as a director, her ability shines, not just in film, but also in television. Her films like One Night In Miami&hellip; are a broader exploration of the style she brings to the many stand-alone episodes she has directed for shows. These episodes frequently receive critical and audience acclaim and have put her on the map in the directorial realm. There&rsquo;s no doubt that King&rsquo;s career has just begun and will continue to thrill viewers.</p>
<p>9  Clint Eastwood
Unforgiven (1992), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), Mystic River (2003)</p>
<p>The American Western genre wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without Clint Eastwood. Both a prolific actor and director within the genre, he established tropes early in his career, only to break them and change the landscape of cinema as he matured as a director. Unforgiven, which he directed and starred in, is considered a masterpiece in both performance and behind-the-scenes execution. Though he easily works with himself as a star, his ability to collaborate with so many great actors, including Meryl Streep, shows that he belongs in the director&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>Is Clint Eastwood A Better Actor Or Director? This Stat Settles The Debate
Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s extensive career includes great films as an actor and as a director; however, one of those two roles seems to suit him the best.</p>
<p>8  Robert Redford
Ordinary People (1980), Quiz Show (1994), A River Runs Through It (1992)</p>
<p>While Robert Redford might be more well-known for his acting performances, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the films he directed aren&rsquo;t just as worthy of praise. His directorial debut, Ordinary People, won many awards, including Best Picture at the Oscars. This set the bar high for his later work, but he maintained the same commitment to quality and innovation in filmmaking. Before working in film, he got his start acting on Broadway, which informed many of his acting choices. The intelligence and humor that he brought to his roles are always present in his films.</p>
<p>7  Todd Field
Tár (2022), Little Children (2006), In The Bedroom (2001)</p>
<p>Todd Field has had an interesting path to the world of filmmaking but has distinguished himself with films of fantastic caliber. Tár made waves after its release because of Field&rsquo;s masterful direction, and Cate Blanchett&rsquo;s career-defining performance while working with him. Much of his talent as a director can be traced back to the creators he worked with as an actor. Being on set with Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut must have taught him much about the art of cinema. Though he often takes significant breaks between projects, Field is the kind of director worth waiting for.</p>
<p>6  Sarah Polley
Women Talking (2022), Away From Her (2006)</p>
<p>Sarah Polley recently made waves when she won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for her most recent film, Women Talking. Before this, and her earlier films and TV shows, Polley was a child star in the series Ramona and Road To Avonlea, as well as many films like The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen. Though she successfully transitioned to adult roles, it was soon clear that Polley&rsquo;s passion, and talent, lay with writing and directing. Polley infuses all of her work with her political activism and desire to shed light on untold stories.</p>
<p>5  Benny Safdie
Good Time (2017), Uncut Gems (2019)</p>
<p>Benny Safdie is an interesting case of an actor-director combination because he was a more prominent director first. He and his brother, Josh Safdie, were a prolific pair, and one to watch. The Safdie brothers have recently split up due to the former&rsquo;s desire to commit to acting. Though it&rsquo;s still early in his acting career, it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to beat the legacy of directing that he created with his brother. Both Uncut Gems and Good Time are known for their anxiety-inducing pace, and the brothers could have had plenty of success making more films in this style.</p>
<p>4  Olivia Wilde
Booksmart (2019), Don&rsquo;t Worry Darling (2022)</p>
<p>Though her most recent film, Don&rsquo;t Worry Darling, didn&rsquo;t perform as well as her debut, Olivia Wilde is still making waves and an up-and-coming director to watch. Booksmart solidified her as a force to be reckoned with and someone with great insight into the teenage girl experience. Her acting career was successful in both film and television, but she was often typecast as a love interest instead of a fully fleshed-out individual. Through her films, she has worked to create female characters with rich backstories and strong development.</p>
<p>3  Jon Favreau
Chef (2014), Iron Man (2008), Elf (2003)</p>
<p>Best known for his work within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Jon Favreau also plays a recurring character, Happy Hogan, who teams up with Iron Man and Spider-Man. He&rsquo;s a titan in the superhero genre because it was he who directed the first Iron Man in 2008, which kicked off the popularity of Marvel onscreen in the twenty-first century. Before that, he had proved his talent in comedy and drama with films like Elf and Chef. Favreau makes a fun sidekick and comedic relief in his acting roles, but they don&rsquo;t come close to the talent he displays behind the camera.</p>
<p>10 Best Characters Jon Favreau Introduced To The MCU
Jon Favreau made the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe possible with the success of 2008&rsquo;s Iron Man. He introduced icons like Tony Stark and Nick Fury.</p>
<p>2  Jordan Peele
Get Out (2017), Us (2019), Nope (2022)</p>
<p>Jordan Peele was not just an actor, but also an iconic comedian, but it&rsquo;s these comedic chops that prepped him so well for his biting horror films that are rife with satire. Beginning with Get Out in 2017, Peele proved himself to be different from any other director working in Hollywood today because of his ability to turn critical analysis of culture and prejudice into exciting narratives. It&rsquo;s due to his wide range of experience that the films he produces are so well received, and his time as an actor helps him direct the performers he works with so effectively.</p>
<p>1  Greta Gerwig
Lady Bird (2017), Little Women (2019), Barbie (2023)</p>
<p>One of the most popular female filmmakers in recent years, Greta Gerwig first made her name portraying lost young women in indie films such as Frances Ha and Twentieth Century Women, but she had too many ideas to remain in front of the camera. Her first foray into behind-the-scenes work came in co-writing Frances Ha with her now husband Noah Baumbach. Since then, with every film under her belt, she&rsquo;s only increased her scope by taking on larger and more high-profile projects.
Barbie is her most commercial hit to date, but Gerwig making Barbie wasn&rsquo;t selling out, but simply the next step in her evolution as a director. The quieter films she was known for in her early years helped develop her keen sense of empathy and sharp writing skills that turned even the most popular movie into a think piece. Though Gerwig brought a unique charm to her onscreen performances, it&rsquo;s clear that she belongs behind the camera, and there&rsquo;s no going back.</p>
