## Literature Review
RHOP husband, Juan Dixon, was fired as a coach for allegedly failing to report accusations of harassment from a student against a member of his staff.




On a recent episode of The Real Housewives of Potomac titled &#34;Tequila, Tears, Texas,&#34; the ladies confronted Robyn Dixon about her husband Juan Dixon&#39;s recent scandal, which caused him to get fired from his coaching job. The confrontation took place in Austin, Texas, where the RHOP women were on a trip planned for the group by Ashley Darby. What was supposed to be a fun vacation was upended when they questioned Robyn about the scandal. Robyn lost her cool and became very emotional as she defended her husband.




The incident began innocently enough, with the women discussing sexual proclivities at the dinner table. When Robyn admits something rather suggestive, Karen Huger recommends that she not do so, considering the latest accusations of infidelity against Juan. Finding herself in the hot seat, Robyn claims that she never read DMs between Juan and the other woman because he erases his phone so often. The other women think this is shady behavior on Juan&#39;s part, but Robyn insists that she trusts her man. This leads to a conversation about Juan&#39;s recent firing from his coaching job at Coppin State University.

 What Is Juan Accused Of? 
          




Robyn&#39;s husband, Juan, was fired as head basketball coach at Coppin State University, where he served as head coach for six seasons. Tensions between Juan and the school came to a head when a player accused members of his staff of inappropriate behavior. Lucian Brownlee, an assistant coach, was accused of catfishing a student, pretending to be a woman, tricking him into sending sexually explicit photos, then using those photos to blackmail him (via The Baltimore Sun). The lawsuit alleges Juan and other members of staff knew about the harassment and didn&#39;t any to protect the student from Lucian. It likely didn&#39;t help that the Coppin State basketball team had a losing record under Juan.



 Robyn Stands By Her Man 
          

Robyn didn&#39;t react well to the conversation, she lost her temper and was overwhelmed with emotion. She said that Juan, who she&#39;s had a complicated relationship with, is innocent. She claimed that people at the college have been supporting him and insisted that he wasn’t fired because of the lawsuit. When Wendy Osefo suggests that Juan likely lost his job because of a Title IX violation, Robyn says this is not true. According to Robyn, Juan reported the accusations made by the student shortly after he learned of the situation.






 What The Women Said After The Confrontation 
          

After Robyn&#39;s meltdown, the women separated into two groups to head back to their hotel. Robyn ended up in a car with Mia Thornton, Candiace Dillard Bassett, and Wendy. The fireworks continued during the ride as Robyn broke down into tears. She accused Candiace and Wendy of attacking her when she’d done nothing to them. As Robyn got more and more worked up, the episode of The Real Housewives Of Potomac ended on a cliffhanger.



The Real Housewives Of Potomac airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
