## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner has blazed a new trail for seniors on his groundbreaking season. Here&#39;s the topic he doesn&#39;t shy away from.




The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner has broken new ground in the world of reality dating competition shows, and he now reveals the taboo topic he&#39;s not afraid to talk about. Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, lost his beloved wife, Toni, six years ago after 43 wonderful years together. Gerry is the proud father of two daughters and the beloved grandfather of two granddaughters. He began his journey with 22 women over the age of 60. Gerry has now narrowed down his choice to two women - Theresa Nist, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, or Leslie Fhima, a 64-year-old fitness instructor from Minneapolis, Minnesota.




In an interview with Bachelor Nation, Gerry was asked which taboo topic he loves talking about. He replied, &#34;All too often, people of a certain age are stereotyped. I like to break age biases and push the envelope HARD so we are seen as individuals and not a number associated with age.&#34; Gerry has proved this in many instances on the show from his exciting dates such as ATV riding, horseback riding, and rappelling. He was also very open about what spending time in the Fantasy Suites could mean for him and the women as older people.

 Gerry Turner Reveals Which Bachelor Star Gave Him The Best Advice 
          

When asked for the best relationship advice that he ever received, Gerry repeated what The Bachelorette season 1 star Trista Rehn Sutter told him. He said it was, &#34;Don’t look for the partner you can live with; look for the partner you can’t live without. That advice came from Trista Sutter and helped me immensely to make decisions on the show.&#34; Trista gave these words of wisdom to Gerry during her appearance in the pickleball date on The Golden Bachelor, and he has repeatedly referred to them throughout his journey. Her advice must be good since she&#39;s been married to her choice from the show, Ryan Sutter, for twenty years.





 

Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Gerry has achieved his goal of showing that people of any age can do anything. He thought that his life was over when his wife passed away, but he&#39;s now getting a second chance, which is beautiful to see. With his kind and funny demeanor and his adventurous spirit, Gerry has captured America&#39;s attention. The women of The Golden Bachelor have also broken stereotypes, and have won everyone&#39;s hearts with their personalities, talents, and openness to finding love again.

Gerry really took Trista&#39;s advice to heart, and he&#39;s used it to help him make some difficult choices on the show. The November 30 season finale will reveal which woman--Leslie or Theresa--Gerry can&#39;t live without. It&#39;ll be exciting to see whether Gerry proposes. No matter what happens, Gerry and the women should be proud of how they represented the older generation on The Golden Bachelor. By sharing their stories with the world, they&#39;ve broken new ground. Gerry has done a fantastic job during his Golden Bachelor journey, and he deserves his happily ever after.




The Golden Bachelor season finale airs Thursday, November 30 at 8 p.m. on ABC.
