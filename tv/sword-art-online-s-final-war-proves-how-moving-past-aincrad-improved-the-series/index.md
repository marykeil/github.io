# Sword Art Online s Final War Proves How Moving Past Aincrad Improved the Series


## SUMMARY 



  Sword Art Online: Alicization&#39;s final war in Underworld was much grander and more complex than what could have been achieved in Aincrad.   Underworld allowed for the involvement of multiple real-world factions, unlike the inherently exclusionary Aincrad.   Underworld also life-or-death stakes and real-world implications due to the cloned humans living inside the world.

## Literature Review
Although many think Sword Art Online should&#39;ve remained in Aincrad, Underworld&#39;s final war proves that the move was the best thing for the franchise.


Summary

  Sword Art Online: Alicization&#39;s final war in Underworld was much grander and more complex than what could have been achieved in Aincrad.   Underworld allowed for the involvement of multiple real-world factions, unlike the inherently exclusionary Aincrad.   Underworld also life-or-death stakes and real-world implications due to the cloned humans living inside the world.  






Although far too many critics believe that Sword Art Online should have remained in Aincrad, the franchise&#39;s final war in Sword Art Online: Alicization War of the Underworld, set in SAO&#39;s fourth MMO environment, Underworld, could never have been as grand or as far-reaching as it was if author Reki Kawahara complied with these critiques. In fact, Kirito&#39;s final battle against Akihiko Kayaba in Aincrad can be easily interpreted as what Sword Art Online&#39;s finale could have been if the story didn&#39;t suddenly move into ALfheim Online (ALO) midway through season one, which would have been underwhelming by comparison to the true ending that Kawahara envisioned.

Aincrad&#39;s story was inherently exclusionary, which severely limited its potential. Those in Aincrad were trapped there and no one dared save them for obvious reasons. Akihiko Kayaba had manipulated the programming of his own world so that players whose avatars died in the game would pass away in real life and no one could log out once they dived in.


 

Sword Art Online&#39;s Underworld was the exact opposite. Anyone could leave, and dying in the game wouldn&#39;t kill them. This setup allowed multiple different parties in the real world to get involved.


 Aincrad Could Have Never Supported So Many Different Factions As Underworld Did 
          

Before things got incredibly complicated, the final war in Underworld was already shaping up to be much grander in scale than anything that happened in Aincrad. The U.S. had essentially hired Japanese mercenaries to steal some coveted technology inside Underworld for their own use. Moreover, the in-world characters from the game were cloned humans who were essentially raised inside Underworld as part of a grand experiment. So, the three involved parties in Underworld&#39;s final world were Kirito, real-world Japanese mercenaries hired by the U.S., and cloned humans from Underworld. This alone was already much more nuanced and complex than Aincrad&#39;s setup.

Things got even more complicated in Underworld, and Aincrad wouldn&#39;t have been able to emulate any of it. The Japanese mercenaries hired by the U.S. soon tricked gamers in China and Korea to log in as members of the Dark Territory to help them reclaim the server from Japanese players who they wrongfully claimed hacked the game. None of these players would have ever agreed to dive into Aincrad, since it was well-known that those who did could die there. On the surface, these might seem like much lower stakes than dying in Aincrad. However, it is much more complex than that, much like how the franchise&#39;s divisive move into ALO allowed Sword Art Online to get much more personal and better as a result even though no one&#39;s life was on the line.

Rather than having to worry about dying, Underworld explored the dichotomy between gamers and non-gamers. Sword Art Online is about gaming after all. Kirito&#39;s gamer acquaintances were asked to convert their own avatars to dive into Underworld, which could result in those avatars being erased completely. Kirito&#39;s acquaintances initially rejected the offer since they were being wooed by Sword Art Online survivors, and they believed these SAO survivors looked down on them. However, they eventually relent once they hear how the SAO survivors were stigmatized as gamers by society just like them.



 Underworld Still Had Life-or-Death Stakes And Real-World Implications 
          

Death and real-world stakes were still on the table in Underworld. Even though the players from the real world weren&#39;t at risk of dying, the human clones who were raised in Underworld faced the destruction of their world and themselves. Even if Kirito and his friends wouldn&#39;t die, this mattered to viewers since they had just watched more episodes of Kirito interacting with these characters than he ever did with those in Aincrad. Moreover, the reason why Underworld&#39;s program was created introduced massive real-world implications and even brought about philosophical and moral questions about whether human rights can be attributed to clones.

As revealed in the final season, Underworld was part of a much larger experiment to create human clones to replace human soldiers in battle. If completed, Japan would therefore have been able to force these clones to fight wars for them so humanity wouldn&#39;t have to sacrifice themselves.

          

Underworld not only introduced stakes that could change the course of human history in the real world, but even greatly expanded what Aincrad&#39;s final battle could have ever hoped of achieving by allowing more real-world factions to be involved. While many critics wish that Sword Art Online remained in Aincrad, the final war in Underworld proves that moving beyond that first world was in the best interest of the entire franchise.
