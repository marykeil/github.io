## Literature Review
Jibri Bell’s latest Instagram video has stressed many 90 Day Fiancé viewers. They think he is struggling with his mental health in Thailand.




Many 90 Day Fiancé viewers are worried about Jibri Bell after watching a video of him doing something extreme. The South Dakota native debuted on the show with his Serbian partner, Miona Bell, in April 2022. Since the couple appeared to be in love and had similar career goals, it wasn’t surprising when they got married towards the end of 90 Day Fiancé season 9. As planned, Miona and Jibri left South Dakota after getting married and moved to Palm Springs to attract more work opportunities. The Serbian native started her online wig business, which allegedly helped her become a millionaire.




While Miona seems to enjoy her new life in the United States, Jibri appears to be following a less glamorous path without his wife. He has moved to Thailand to learn more about meditation and the lifestyle of a Buddhist monk. For the last two months, Jibri has talked about his experiences in Thailand and living a stress-free and peaceful life. Since Jibri and Miona have been living away from each other and have removed their pictures together on social media, it has been suggested that they’ve pulled the plug on their marriage. Although Jibri claims that he is still with Miona, his life appears to be going down a rabbit hole.

 Jibri Gets A Tattoo On His Bald Head 

 

Recently, Jibri posted a video of himself lying on his belly while getting a Sak Yant (traditional tattoo) from a monk. He shared clips of his new addition on Instagram, showing how he got the pattern inked on the crown region of his head. The 30-year-old 90 Day Fiancé star captioned the post, “Sak Yant tattoos were exclusive to monks and warriors.” According to Jibri, the new tattoo imbues wearers with special abilities, protection, and good fortune. He wrote, “the tattoo hurt but the energy in the temple was so calming,” adding that he cried during the process.






 Is Jibri Acting Erratic? 
          

Jibri has been acting wild since his new spiritual journey began. However, the decision to get a painful crown tattoo to obtain some magical powers hints that he is slowly losing it. Someone commented (via 90sipsofrealitea), “this dude is off the rail. She Will NEVER Take Him Back.”  Many 90 Day Fiancé viewers think Jibri is having a mid-life crisis because of his wife’s money-focused and luxury-oriented mindset. The American man has been discussing how he prefers a calm life and hardships over living in 5-star hotels since coming to Thailand.



 Is Jibri Looking For Attention After Being Away From Limelight? 

 




While some viewers think Jibri has truly changed, others feel he’s exploiting Thailand’s culture for social media clout. Jibri has always done the wackiest things in the past to stand out from others. In 2022, he sported the strangest outfits on cameras to make a brand around himself. Soon after, he used the show to promote his song, which he played during his wedding scene. Jibri also made a meme out of himself by misbehaving with other cast members during the Tell All. The 90 Day Fiancé alum’s Thailand trip may be his latest invention to gain clout from the Western audience.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
