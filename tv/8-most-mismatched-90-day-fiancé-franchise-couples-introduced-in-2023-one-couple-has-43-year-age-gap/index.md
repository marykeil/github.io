## Literature Review
The 90 Day Fiancé franchise sometimes introduces couples who should’ve never gotten together due to a lack of intimacy or personality differences.




Since 2014, 90 Day Fiancé has given many individuals a platform to tell their love stories to the world. Some pairs have been excellent duos, while others have surprised viewers with their differences. Omar Albakour and Avery Mills are one couple who shocked fans by making their relationship work. While the American woman and her Muslim beau faced countless challenges, they overcame them together and tied the knot in the finale. Avery converted to Islam and embraced the new traditions without resisting the change.
Jovi Dufren and Yara Zaya also amazed many viewers by continuing their marriage despite clear differences. The American man’s alcohol addiction and the Ukrainian woman’s lack of trust in her husband seemed like two of the most crucial issues in their relationship. However, the pair stayed together and managed to raise an adorable daughter. 90 Day Fiancé icons Loren and Alexei Brovarnik also became a standout couple of the franchise. The two welcomed three kids, embraced each other’s traditions, and almost decided to move to Israel in their spin-off.

 8  Julio Moya &amp; Kirsten Schoemaker 
Julio Moya Didn’t Want To Move In With Kirsten Schoemaker
        

Sadly, not all pairs appearing on the show have been good matches. In 2023, different 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs featured many odd couples with disastrous journeys and shocking differences. Julio Moya and Kirsten Schoemaker are two of the most incompatible cast members of the franchise. The two initially seemed like a good match and appeared to share matching goals. The New York man even promised to move to his girlfriend’s home country of the Netherlands to build a future. However, Julio got scared of the big move and changed his mind in the middle of the season, leaving Kirsten heartbroken.

 7  Debbie Aguero &amp; Oussama 
Debbie Aguero &amp; Oussama Had A 43-Year Age Gap
        

Debbie Aguero and Oussama are among the most mismatched couples in the history of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. Although they met via social media like many other successful couples, they had a massive age gap. Watching Oussama, 24, fall for a lady 43 years older than him was strange. While Oussama initially seemed genuinely in love with Debbie, it soon became apparent that his true intention was to move to the United States to make money through his art.

 6  Nicola Kanaan &amp; Meisha Johnson 
Nicola Kanaan Appears Ashamed Of Meisha Johnson’s Past
        

Meisha Johnson has had a colorful past. While the single mother may be inspirational to Americans, her Israeli boyfriend, Nicola, wasn’t too cool with her dating history. The middle-aged virgin man seemed ashamed of Meisha’s past from the beginning. He wasn’t even honest about his relationship with his mother because he feared that his family would be disgusted by his partner. As expected, Meisha wasn’t too happy about her lover’s opinion of herself. It’s unknown if the two made their relationship work after getting engaged on the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off.





 5  Christian Allgood &amp; Cleo 
Christian Allgood &amp; Cleo Have Very Different Personalities


 







Christian Allgood and Cleo were probably the worst match of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Not only did they have personality differences, but they also faced major sexual issues that stopped them from truly loving each other. Cleo was an introverted transgender woman who wanted a man to accept her true self. She hadn’t opted for the gender-affirmation procedure then but hoped that Christin would be fine with that. In comparison, Christian was an extrovert party boy who had only dated women. He may have just used Cleo to achieve reality TV fame.





 4  Ashley Michelle &amp; Manuel 
Manuel Mocks What Ashley Michelle Does For A Living


90 Day Fiancé season 10 also features some of the worst pairs. The biggest example is Ashley Michelle and Manuel, who aren’t a good couple by any stretch of the imagination. Apart from clear age and cultural gaps, Manuel and Ashley have differences in mutual respect. While the New York woman is fine with her Ecuadorian beau, he isn’t respectful. According to social media users (via Middle-Cream-1282), Manuel is “shady and secretive,” “sexist and condescending,” and “an absolute prick.” He doesn’t support Ashley’s witch career and has mocked her job several times on the show.





 3  Nikki Exotika &amp; Justin 
Justin Fails To Accept Nikki Exotika As A Trans Woman


 







Justin and Nikki’s relationship in season 10 has been controversial and odd. The two first met nearly eighteen years ago. At the time, Justin was a barely legal teen, while Nikki was nearing her 30s. The pair had a short relationship at the time, which ended when Nikki revealed she was trans. However, the couple somehow reconciled again and decided to appear on the reality TV show to televise their journey to the wedding aisle. Justin still feels awkward being intimate with Nikki, and it seems the duo won’t make it far.





 2  Kimberly Rochelle &amp; TJ Goswami 
Kimberly Rochelle Doesn’t Respect TJ Goswami’s Culture


 







Kimberly Rochelle and Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami show no concern for each other’s emotions and argue childishly on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. TJ’s brother, Yash, was especially against Kimberly because she always disrespected Indian culture. He called her out numerous times, which resulted in more toxicity and issues. Kimberly claimed she wouldn’t embrace TJ’s Indian traditions and culture and compared it to American culture. She didn’t make much effort to try to be a good wife to TJ and returned to the United States soon after her marriage.





 1  Kris Foster &amp; Jeymi Noguera 
Kris Foster &amp; Jeymi Noguera Didn’t Have Any Chemistry
        

Kris Foster and Jeymi Noguera were two more cast members who didn’t seem like an ideal duo. Their problems went beyond simple trust issues and lack of respect. They didn’t have any chemistry at all and never seemed like a real couple. Kris did travel to Colombia to settle down with Jeymi, but the pair split up soon after their wedding. Kris claimed that Jeymi had cheated on her, while Jeymi stated that Kris disappeared from her life without notice. With nearly a 10-year age gap, it was good that the 90 Day Fiancé franchise pair split up before they emotionally hurt each other more.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
