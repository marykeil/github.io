# Ezra Bridger Actor Reveals His Favorite Ahsoka Fight Scenes &amp; Stunts


## SUMMARY 



  Eman Esfandi&#39;s stunts in Ahsoka were impressive and showcased his talent.   The fight scenes and lightsaber moments were particularly memorable for the actor given that they were the first scenes Esfandi shot during production.   Esfandi&#39;s performance made the live-action version of Ezra Bridger feel true to Star Wars Rebels which is hopefully something that will continue in future Star Wars appearances.

## Literature Review
The actor responsible for bringing Ezra Bridger to live-action Star Wars in Ahsoka has revealed his favorite stunt moments from the show.




The actor who portrayed Ezra Bridger in Ahsoka, Eman Esfandi, has revealed his favorite moments from the show surrounding fight sequences and other stuntwork. One of the brightest sparks of Ahsoka was Star Wars Rebels&#39; Ezra Bridger, largely due to the performance of Eman Esfandi perfectly capturing the feel of the character. Hopefully, this spark continues in the story of Ahsoka season 2 now that a continuation of the tale has been confirmed as an upcoming Star Wars TV show.




                  Ahsoka Season 2 Confirmed In Major Star Wars Update   Lucasfilm officially confirm Ahsoka season 2 is in active development by Dave Filoni, George Lucas&#39; protégé and Ahsoka Tano&#39;s co-creator.    

However, despite Ahsoka season 2&#39;s announcement, Esfandi has recently appeared on the Dagobah Dispatch podcast to look back on his time during Ahsoka season 1. At one point during the podcast, Esfandi was asked about the stunts and other fight sequences found in Ahsoka, with the Ezra actor outlining his favorite moments of this ilk in his reply:


&#34;I guess I surprised myself at how many of the different moves they taught me I could put in succession, right, in the choreo that they planned... It felt like goofy for most of the time, and then all of a sudden, it came together and it wasn’t goofy anymore... I think the succinctness of it was the most impressive part. I think the most fun was the fight scene with my lightsaber, which is the first thing I shot... it’s the first time you see Ezra use a lightsaber in the show against the Night Troopers. There’s something real special about, you know, slashing a bunch of troopers with a lightsaber, and then actually, practical effects blowing up and going off and falling and… it’s pretty surreal.&#34;






 Eman Esfandi&#39;s Star Wars Stunts Are Seriously Impressive 
          

Esfandi&#39;s comments help to reiterate just how impressive the actor&#39;s Star Wars stunts are in Ahsoka. Across the board, the Disney&#43; show featured fantastic choreography with Ezra often being at the heart of it. Be it the Force martial arts he exhibited in Ahsoka season 1, episode 7, or the lightsaber moments Esfandi alluded to from Ahsoka&#39;s finale, the actor performed his stuntwork admirably. None of the actions looked out of place which combined with Eman Esfandi&#39;s fantastic Ahsoka performance to make the live-action version of Ezra Bridger feel as though he had stepped right out of Star Wars Rebels&#39; animated formate.
