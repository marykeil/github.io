# New Details On Canceled Lizzie McGuire Reboot Revealed (Including Racy Hook-Up Between Beloved Characters)


## SUMMARY 



  The canceled Lizzie McGuire revival would have shown adult Lizzie living in New York. Disney halted production in 2020, finding the show too mature for its platform.   Writer Jonathan Hurwitz reveals on TikTok that in the revival, Lizzie meets up with Gordo, who is engaged and expecting a baby with another woman. In episode 3, Lizzie wakes up in Ethan&#39;s bed, implying a hook-up between the two.   It&#39;s likely the Gordo and Ethan storylines would have divided fans of the original series, especially those rooting for Lizzie and Gordo to end up together.

## Literature Review

New information emerges about the Lizzie McGuire revival, which would have featured a surprising twist with two of the show&#39;s original characters.




A writer on the canceled Lizzie McGuire revival reveals new details about the show, including a surprise hook-up. The follow-up series, which was being created for Disney&#43;, would have shown adult Lizzie living in New York. However, once she discovers that her partner cheated on her, she heads home and moves back in with her parents. While two episodes of the revival were filmed, they never saw the light of day; in 2020, Disney halted production after deciding the show was too mature for its platform.




Now, writer Jonathan Hurwitz has posted on TikTok about some of the storylines viewers would have seen in the Lizzie McGuire revival. Check out Hurwitz&#39;s video (via TVLine) below:


 

In the video, Hurwitz focuses on what likely would have been two of the revival&#39;s most surprising developments, involving original characters Ethan and Gordo. Hurwitz&#39;s full quote follows:


[In episode 2] Lizzie meets up with Gordo, who she&#39;s just kind of been in touch with via text over the years, occasionally. They meet up, and Gordo reveals that he is engaged to a woman, and she&#39;s pregnant, and they&#39;re really happy. So no, in this version, Lizzie and Gordo would not have ended up together. Episode 2 ends with Lizzie getting a text from Ethan Craft, and little animated Lizzie faints.
Episode 3 wasn&#39;t filmed, but there was a script for it. Lizzie wakes up in Ethan&#39;s bed in his water polo t-shirt. Animated Lizzie pops up, and she has this little checklist, like a to-do list, and Ethan is on the list. She checks it off, and I think she says something like, &#39;Well, checked that box [dramatic pause] twice.&#39;






 The Gordo &amp; Ethan Twists Would Have Divided Viewers 
          

If the Lizzie McGuire revival had made it all the way to Disney&#43;, the Ethan and Gordo storylines would have been divisive for fans of the original series. Throughout the show, Gordo was one of Lizzie&#39;s best friends along with Lalaine&#39;s Miranda. It wasn&#39;t until The Lizzie McGuire Movie in 2003 that their relationship turned romantic, with the two sharing a sweet kiss at the end of the film.

As that movie marked the end of Lizzie McGuire until the revival was announced, some viewers were likely hoping to see her relationship with Gordo explored further. However, as childhood romances rarely last into adulthood, the twist that Gordo&#39;s expecting a baby with someone else feels more believable and likely would have been applauded for its realism.




In comparison, Lizzie and Ethan&#39;s relationship in the original series was less meaningful â€“ Ethan is Lizzie&#39;s longtime crush, but she&#39;s largely over him by the end of the show. In that way, their hook-up would have served as a fun payoff from the original Lizzie McGuire. Considering Lizzie has just found out her partner cheated, her night with Ethan probably would have been treated as a diversion rather than something serious. Still, some may have seen it as character regression for her.

As Hurwitz suggests in his video, the Ethan twist is likely one of the storylines that concerned Disney. However, as Lizzie is an adult by the time of the revival, it makes sense that the writers found it a perfectly valid story beat. While the Lizzie McGuire revival remains canceled as of now, there&#39;s always hope that Disney may be willing to revisit it in the future, ideally with realistic adult material.
