## Literature Review
After losing nearly 100 pounds in eight months, Anna Campisi from 90 Day Fiancé shares close-up photos to celebrate her new weight loss achievement.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Anna Campisi is flaunting her new chiseled jawline and slimmer face after losing 94 pounds following her weight-loss surgery. Anna featured in 90 Day Fiancé season 7 with her Turkish man, Mursel Mistanoglu. The couple married in 2019 and welcomed their son, Gokhan John, via surrogate in April 2022. While Anna has maintained great physical health, she did feel the need to opt for gastric sleeve surgery. In April 2023, she finally underwent weight-loss surgery in Turkey.




Anna has posted many full-body pictures in the last few months to show off her 94-pound weight loss. Recently, she celebrated another big victory with her 329K Instagram followers. Anna posted a few pictures of her husband and sons from their recent family outing. With family photos, Anna also shared a close-up of her face, which looked much slimmer than before.


 

She captioned the Instagram post as, “I had a great non scale victory today! The face recognition on my phone officially stopped working!” The 90 Day Fiancé alum now looks so different that she had to reset her face recognition on her phone.

 90 Day Fiancé Fans React To Anna’s New Slimmer Face 
          

Anna’s fans are excited to see her weight-loss journey unfold on social media. They’ve seen her gradually lose pounds and become her desired version of herself. Anna’s latest Instagram post also received many sweet comments from fans. A social media user commented, “wow! I love that! I never thought about that happening. You looked great!” Another user chimed in, “beautiful before and after. But congratulations! I know you must be so proud.” Others thought Anna had started looking younger than her age. A few 90 Day Fiancé viewers also wished TLC was still following Anna and Mursel’s story.

In the past few years, many reality TV stars have opted for gastric sleeve surgery to kickstart their fitness journeys. In the 90 Day Fiancé franchise, Angela Deem, Tiffany Franco, and Winter Everett chose to undergo surgery to lose weight. Angela and Winter have dropped about 100 pounds in the last three years, and Tiffany has lost nearly 85 pounds in the past two years. Although all the ladies are inspirations for people who want to lose weight, Anna pulls ahead as the most inspirational 90 Day Fiancé cast member who has lost the most weight in the least amount of time.




It’s amazing to see Anna lose nearly 100 pounds in eight months. However, weight loss surgery is just a tool, not a magic wand. To sustain her impressive weight-loss results, the 38-year-old reality star must keep following a healthy routine, including exercising. Since Anna already lives an active lifestyle while caring for her four sons and managing different businesses, keeping the weight off shouldn’t be tough. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé cast member will soon achieve her weight goals.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
