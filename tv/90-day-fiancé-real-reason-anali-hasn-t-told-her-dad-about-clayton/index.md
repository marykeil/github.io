## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 cast member Anali Vallejos is yet to tell Clayton Clark the real reason she has been hiding him from her father in Peru.




90 Day Fiancé star Anali Vallejos is keeping Clayton Clark a secret from her father back in Peru. Anali, 26, and 29-year-old Kentucky man Clayton met on a language learning app. The couple started exchanging text messages and Clayton went to meet her a few months later. Anali came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa to marry Clayton. Anali was shocked to see the sorry state of Clayton’s house with his two guinea pigs, two chihuahuas, and his mother Violet living inside his closet. Anali and Clayton went for over two months without having sex, and Anali was visibly put off by Clayton’s behavior.




Clayton’s friend Kameron is the one who made Clayton realize there were several issues in their relationship that had to be tackled before Clayton could get married. The lack of intimacy was a major red flag but, Anali had not told her father about Clayton. Anali was hiding Clayton from her father. Claytonwarne Anali that if she didn’t do it, he would do it himself. However, Clayton was worried that it would not end well and that Anali would threaten him or even break off their relationship. He wondered if it was a relationship he even wanted to be in if that was a possible outcome.

 Anali Could Be Afraid Of Her &#34;Overprotective&#34; Dad&#39;s Reaction 
          




After his conversation with Kameron, Clayton thought that everything Anali had said about her dad in the last two and a half years didn’t make sense. She kept telling Clayton, “I’m going to talk to my dad when I want.” Clayton wanted to know when she would do it and if there was going to be an appropriate moment at all. Clayton told Anali that her father would “die without knowing” if he didn’t come clean to him.

There was no reason for Anali to not tell her father about Clayton. Meanwhile, Anali told the cameras that while her dad was happy and funny, he was also “very protective, overprotective.” She admitted that if that was how things were when she was in Peru, things would be “three times worse” when she came to America. Anali did not confess it to the cameras, but her leaving dinner midway and rushing to the bathroom to cry made Clayton worry if she “was in danger” because she seemed “scared.”

Kameron had suggested to Clayton that the reason behind her not telling her dad about him was because Anali had some “uncertainty” about him. “I don’t know man,” Clayton had admitted. However, Kameron was watching out for his friend and didn’t want to see him getting hurt. During his introductory episode, Clayton had gushed about how he’d proposed to Anali three days after meeting her. Even then, Anali had taken the longest time to say “yes” and when she did, she didn’t seem too thrilled about it. Anali might not be in love with Clayton and might have considered going back to Peru if things didn’t go well.



 Anali Is Keeping Her Options Open In The U.S. 

 




Anali finally posted about Clayton on her Instagram page, but that did not equate to her telling her dad about it. Anali’s father might not have even been following her on social media for him to know his daughter was in love with an American man and had moved there to marry him. Anali could have thought of coming to America and marrying Clayton only to leave him for someone else later. Anali’s disappointment with Clayton has been evident since she arrived at his apartment, and her refusing to have sex with him showed her lack of interest in becoming his life partner.

90 Day Fiancé star Anali may have even decided to tell her father about Clayton once she moved into his house, but his closet mom and the messy apartment with the pets could have made her change her decision. Anali could have felt ashamed of letting her father know of her choice. Anali might have hoped to find a better partner in America who was worthy of being shown off to her father instead of 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Clayton.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
