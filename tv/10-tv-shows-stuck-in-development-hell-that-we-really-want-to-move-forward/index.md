## Literature Review
Some TV shows, such as the Aeon Flux reboot and Madeline Miller&#39;s Circe, have been in development for so long that fans doubt they will ever be made.




Adaptations of popular book series and reboots of TV shows and movies are among the TV shows that are currently stuck in &#34;development hell,&#34; and have been that way for years. The list of series in development demonstrates the post-Game of Thrones trend of fantasy and sci-fi books being adapted into shows rather than movies. Several dystopian series are also in development, including an Aeon Flux reboot and an adaptation of Margaret Atwood&#39;s MaddAddam.
Adaptations and reboots face the challenge of living up to a beloved original story. However, they are guaranteed an audience that will watch the show out of curiosity, if nothing else. Yet some of these shows will simply never be made. Studios will sometimes officially announce the cancellation of a show in development, which happened with the True Blood reboot. Others will be shelved indefinitely until it is widely assumed that they are dead, as is the case of the Throne of Glass TV show.









 








 10  A Court Of Thorns And Roses (Hulu) 
Hulu is working on an adaptation of Sarah J. Maas&#39; bestselling fantasy series.


 







Hulu announced a TV show adaptation of A Court of Thorns and Roses in 2021, with author Sarah J. Maas and Outlander creator Ronald D. Moore developing the series. A Court of Thorns and Roses has comparatively not been in development for long. However, a TV show adaptation of Throne of Glass, another series by Maas, has also been stuck in development at Hulu since 2016. Fans might be skeptical that Hulu will make A Court of Thorns and Roses when its predecessor has been shelved for so long. However, the success or failure of A Court of Thorns and Roses could determine the fate of the Throne of Glass.
            
 
 10 Fantasy Books We Can&#39;t Believe Haven&#39;t Become Movies Or TV Shows Yet 
With the fantasy craze still in effect from Game of Thrones, it&#39;s a surprise that these fantasy novels haven&#39;t made it to TV or film yet.









 9  The Bone Church (Cedar Park Entertainment) 
There is a planned TV show adaptation of Stephen King&#39;s narrative poem.
        

Stephen King&#39;s 2009 narrative poem The Bone Church is told from the perspective of a bar patron who relates the tale of a doomed jungle expedition in exchange for drinks from a listener. The indie studio Cedar Park Entertainment reportedly acquired the rights to develop The Bone Church into a TV show in 2018 (via Deadline). The proposed series has remained in development ever since. King&#39;s status as an influential author of fantasy and horror means that people will always want to see adaptations of his writing. The Bone Church is not alone among upcoming Stephen King movies and TV shows.





 8  Sam And Twitch (wiip) 
Todd McFarlane is working on a Spawn spinoff about two NYPD detectives
        

Todd McFarlane is the creator of the comic book character Spawn, about whom a live-action movie and animated TV show were both made in 1997. However, McFarlane more recently began developing a live-action series about the Spawn side characters Sam and Twitch, two NYPD homicide detectives. The indie studio wiip teamed up with McFarlane for the project. McFarlane even expressed interest (via The Hollywood Reporter) in expanding the story into a Spawn shared universe. But shared universes are all too common these days, and the lack of news on the Sam and Twitch TV show is not encouraging.





 7  League Of Pan (Syfy) 
A continuation of Peter Pan focusing on Wendy Darling and the Lost Boys as adults.
        

Syfy&#39;s announced series League of Pan, taking place 10 years after the events of Peter Pan, is described as (via Variety) &#34;[Wendy and the Lost Boys] must return to Neverland to face a new evil that is threatening the existence of the magical place they once called home. This return reignites bitter rivalries and unearths “twisted secrets” from their past.&#34; Syfy announced this series in 2020. The series would fit right in among today&#39;s live-action remakes produced by Disney and other studios. However, Syfy would have to develop a show that stands apart from Disney&#39;s recent movie Peter Pan &amp; Wendy.





 6  Aeon Flux Reboot (Paramount&#43;) 
A live-action remake of MTV&#39;s animated Aeon Flux TV show.
        

The animated Aeon Flux TV show originally aired on MTV from 1991 to 1995. The show follows the title character, who is an immortal secret agent. The series was adapted into a criticized live-action Aeon Flux movie starring Charlize Theron in 2005. A live-action Aeon Flux reboot was announced in 2018 and moved to Paramount&#43; in 2021, with Teen Wolf creator Jeff Davis attached to the project. If it is made, Aeon Flux will have to contend with living up to the popular original series. The reception to Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender live-action remake might have some bearing on whether Paramount&#43; decides to move forward with Aeon Flux.





 5  Sin City (Legendary Television) 
A spinoff series of Frank Miller&#39;s Sin City movies.
        

In 2019, Frank Miller signed off on Legendary Television making a TV show set in his Sin City universe, focusing on original characters (via Deadline). Miller&#39;s Sin City comic book series was previously adapted into a movie of the same name, directed by Miller himself and Robert Rodriguez. It was followed by a sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, that failed to match the success of its predecessor. There has been no news on the TV show since 2019. In fact, the most recent piece of news related to Sin City was that Miller created new art of the character Marv to support the WGA strike in 2023.

Movies like Sherlock Holmes 3 and Legally Blonde 3 have been in the works for years, but hope for their release doesn&#39;t fade yet.









 4  The Chronicles Of Narnia (Netflix) 
The Narnia TV show may be abandoned in favor of movies.


 







Netflix acquired the rights to C.S. Lewis&#39; The Chronicles of Narnia books in 2018 and subsequently announced that one or more TV shows rebooting the series were in development. However, it was announced that Greta Gerwig will be directing two Narnia movies in 2023. Netflix has not clarified what this means for the proposed Narnia TV shows.
If Gerwig&#39;s movies are successful, it will probably lead to the rest of Narnia being adapted as movies. With many fantasy franchises opting for the TV show format over movies, it would be interesting to see if Netflix abandons the idea of a Narnia TV show. This is especially true since the previous Narnia movies were not considered successful enough to finish the franchise.





 3  MaddAddam (Hulu) 
Hulu is planning another Margaret Atwood dystopia TV show.
        

Hulu announced that The Little Drummer Girl showrunner Mike Lesslie would be adapting Atwood&#39;s MaddAddam in 2021 (via Deadline). MaddAddam is the title of the third book in a dystopian trilogy by Atwood, following Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood. Given Hulu&#39;s success with The Handmaid&#39;s Tale, based on another dystopian novel by Atwood, studio executives should be eager to move forward with MaddAddam. Yet there has been no news on the MaddAddam TV show since it was announced almost three years ago.





 2  Circe (HBO) 
Based on Madeline Miller&#39;s bestselling rendition of the Greek myth of Circe.
        

HBO Max ordered an 8-episode adaptation of Madeline Miller&#39;s international bestseller Circe in 2019 (via Deadline). Married screenwriting duo Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Jurassic World) were meant to write and produce the show, but they have been busy working on Avatar: The Way of Water and its sequels in recent years. There has been no new information about the Circe TV show since it was announced. Miller is also the author of the equally, if not more beloved novel The Song of Achilles. Her fans would certainly enjoy seeing an adaptation of her work if HBO moved forward with the project.

 1  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Amazon) 
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has had two movies and is now getting a TV show.


 







A TV series based on Stieg Larsson&#39;s thriller novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was announced by Amazon in 2020. The book series was first adapted into the 2011 movie The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before the entire cast was replaced for the sequel The Girl in the Spider&#39;s Web in 2018. Acclaimed actresses Rooney Mara and Claire Foy have both portrayed the main character Lisbeth Salander. After three years with no new information about The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo TV show, Amazon recently announced Veena Sub as the series&#39; showrunner. While some fans may find this encouraging, other TV shows will never escape development hell.
