## Literature Review
Patrick Stewart gave Kate Mulgrew some sound advice on commanding a starship before she took over the lead role as Captain of Star Trek: Voyager.




When Kate Mulgrew took on the role of Captain Kathryn Janeway in Star Trek: Voyager, Patrick Stewart offered her some advice from one captain to another. After being catapulted to the unexplored Delta Quadrant while on her first mission, Captain Janeway faced the seemingly impossible task of getting the USS Voyager and her crew back home. Over the next seven seasons of Voyager, Janeway and her crew accomplished the impossible, not only making it back home to Earth but also discovering countless new alien species along the way. After returning to Earth, Janeway went on to become one of Starfleet&#39;s most accomplished and celebrated admirals.




After starring as Captain Jean-Luc Picard for seven seasons on Star Trek: The Next Generation, Patrick Stewart knew a thing or two about commanding a starship. While the USS Voyager faced a crisis entirely different from those faced by the USS Enterprise-D, Patrick Stewart provided Mulgrew with some sound advice on how to be a Starfleet captain. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Kate Mulgrew talks about her experience playing Janeway and the advice Stewart gave her. Read her full quote below:


Voyager is a chapter of my life that probably has defined a great deal of the rest of my life. It is, suffice to say, a complete, unexpected mystery that I stumbled into. That was not in my idea of my future. In no way did it figure into my imagination as an actress. But it captured me, it took me, it spun me into a different galaxy altogether, didn’t it? As an artist, it challenged me on every conceivable level. Patrick Stewart was right the day he came up to me, shook my hand, and we got a cup of coffee or something. I said to him, “How am I going to survive this?” He said, “Take a watch. You see that bridge? Just own that bridge. Come for seven years. Do your work. Do it to the best of your ability. Make them follow you. Make them bloody proud.





                  10 Ways Voyager Turned Janeway Into Star Trek&#39;s Most Badass Admiral   During Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s seven years in the Delta Quadrant, Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) had to be all of Starfleet in one person.     


 Kate Mulgrew&#39;s Kathryn Janeway Remains An Important Star Trek Figure 
Janeway became one of Starfleet&#39;s most decorated admirals.
         

Not only did Kate Mulgrew own the bridge as Captain Janeway, but she continues to bring the character to life in modern Star Trek. Although Admiral Janeway makes a brief cameo in Star Trek: Nemesis, her true return happens in the animated Star Trek: Prodigy, which features multiple versions of Janeway. After Dal R&#39;El (Brett Gray) and his ragtag crew take over the USS Protostar, they discover that the ship is equipped with a holographic version of Captain Janeway. Hologram Janeway helps Dal and his crew throughout Prodigy, saving their lives several times over.




The flesh-and-blood Vice Admiral Janeway also makes an appearance in the latter half of Star Trek: Prodigy, as she searches for her friend Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran) and the missing USS Protostar. In command of the USS Dauntless, Janeway pursues the Protostar across the galaxy, eventually helping the young crew save all of Starfleet. By all appearances, it seems Kate Mulgrew took Patrick Stewart&#39;s advice to heart, bringing a calm, confident, and caring energy to Janeway that shines through the character even today. From Star Trek: Voyager to Star Trek: Prodigy, Kate Mulgrew and Kathryn Janeway certainly made &#34;them bloody proud.&#34;



Star Trek: Voyager is available to stream on Paramount&#43; &amp; Star Trek: Prodigy is available to stream on Netflix.
