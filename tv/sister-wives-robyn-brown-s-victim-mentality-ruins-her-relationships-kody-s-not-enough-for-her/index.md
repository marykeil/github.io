## Literature Review
Sister Wives Robyn Brown&#39;s consistent victim mentality has been something viewers of the show have taken notice of and has ruined her relationships.




Sister Wives has explored the relationships between Robyn Brown and her husband, Kody Brown, along with her ex-sister wives, Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, and Christine Brown, who have all noticed that she has a victim mentality in their interactions. Robyn first joined the Brown family in 2014, legally marrying Kody after 4 years of being courted. While Kody and Robyn had spent tons of time together when she married into the family, she&#39;d spent less time with Kody&#39;s other wives, who were waiting to welcome her into the fold. Kody&#39;s wives, Meri, Janelle, and Christine, had all gotten to know Robyn to an extent, but needed to learn more.




Robyn&#39;s connection with each of her fellow sister wives has been tested during Sister Wives season 18, both in person and otherwise. While Robyn has always been difficult for the rest of the family to handle, her emotions in the most recent seasons of Sister Wives have been unparalleled. After Christine made the tough choice to leave Kody and the family after Sister Wives season 17, Robyn&#39;s true colors became an issue for the rest of the family. While she&#39;s always played the victim, Kody&#39;s emotions about his divorce from Christine were pushed onto Robyn, who made things about her.

 Robyn&#39;s Mentality Makes It Seem Like Her Marriage Isn&#39;t Enough 
Kody Isn&#39;t Fulfilling Robyn&#39;s Need For A Plural Family
         

Although Kody and Robyn entered into a marriage with and for each other, recently Robyn has been struggling to make it clear that she loves Kody and is happy in their relationship. Despite the fact that both Kody and Robyn have shared on Sister Wives season 18 that they have no intention of leaving their marriage, the affection Robyn shows toward Kody has never been more double-edged. In her moments alone on Sister Wives, Robyn has blamed Kody for many of the issues he&#39;s facing in his relationships with his other wives. Seeing the husband that Kody is to the other women in the family has changed Robyn&#39;s feelings.




While Robyn was aware of who Kody was when she married him, both have grown since their nuptials in 2014. Kody, who&#39;s gone through some difficult times in his other marriages, has brought baggage back to his relationship with Robyn, who has tried to do everything in her power to reject the issues in Kody&#39;s other relationships. In recent episodes of Sister Wives, it&#39;s been obvious that Robyn&#39;s feelings toward Kody have changed. By constantly playing the victim, Robyn makes it feel like her relationship with Kody isn&#39;t enough for her. She appears to need a level of drama, one Kody can&#39;t always give her, on top of her marriage.



 Robyn Pushes The Rest Of The Family Away, But Blames Kody 
It&#39;s Kody&#39;s Fault Robyn&#39;s Monogamous
          

After Christine decided to leave the Brown family, divorcing from Kody and distancing herself from the rest of the Browns in Flagstaff, Robyn seemed to understand that change was only beginning for the Browns. Once Christine left, things continued to change radically in the large family structure. Throughout Kody&#39;s rage over his breakup with Christine, his relationship with Janelle began to suffer. Robyn claimed she was watching from the sidelines as Kody destroyed his marriage to Janelle. While its possible Robyn pushed Kody to talk to Janelle, what&#39;s more likely is that Robyn understood she&#39;d have more of Kody to herself if Janelle was out of the picture.




Despite wanting plural marriage, Robyn&#39;s desire to feel like she&#39;s the most important person in Kody&#39;s life always wins out. Robyn likely helped Kody push Janelle away, knowing she would still be able to be in a plural marriage if Meri was in the picture. Robyn and Kody didn&#39;t bargain for Meri to begin advocating for herself. Meri, who had been adamant she&#39;d stay in her marriage forever despite Kody&#39;s public criticism of her, stood her ground and decided to leave the relationship. While Meri&#39;s confidence wasn&#39;t part of Robyn&#39;s ideal plan, it&#39;s likely she&#39;s already started blaming Meri instead of acknowledging she&#39;d pushed her sister wife away for years.



 Robyn Says Her Kids Are The Emotional Ones, But It&#39;s Her 
The Brown Kids Are Still In Touch
          

While Robyn has been vocal about the fact that her kids are suffering more than her regarding Kody&#39;s other relationships ending, hearing Robyn&#39;s children talk about their feelings tells another story. Robyn&#39;s older kids have been adopted by Kody, but are originally from her first marriage with her ex-husband David Jessop. They entered into the Brown family at young ages, and with Kody having children around their ages, they connected quickly as siblings. While Robyn&#39;s children have a good relationship with Kody, the other Brown children haven&#39;t been as lucky. In the other children deciding to separate from Kody, the relationship between the kids have been difficult to navigate.




Robyn has spoken about the issues her kids have with Kody&#39;s other children extensively, but instead of leaving the problems to the kids to work out, she&#39;s chosen to place the blame elsewhere. By inserting herself into the problems of her children, Robyn&#39;s made herself an issue for the other kids in the Brown family. While she seems to be trying to help, Robyn&#39;s overly emotional stance on the Brown kids has made things worse for her children. By pushing her own agenda on what her children&#39;s relationships should look like with their siblings, Robyn has made herself the problem.



 Robyn Never Considers Taking Accountability For Her Problems 
The Sister Wives Star Blames Everyone Else

 

Throughout the run of Sister Wives, Robyn has been the most vocal about what everyone else&#39;s problems in the family are. Despite the fact that she&#39;s faced issues of her own and consistently been the center of the drama, Robyn has chosen to speak candidly about what issues the rest of the Brown family are dealing with. She places the blame onto others, rather than accepting that she could hold some fault for what&#39;s happened in her life. Robyn&#39;s inability to take accountability for her issues will, ultimately, be her downfall in the family. With her marriage delicate, Robyn should try to take responsibility for her share of the issues.






 Robyn Won&#39;t Admit She&#39;s Never Been A Good Sister Wife 
Christine, Janelle, &amp; Meri Are The Problem
          

Since Christine, Janelle, and Meri have all left the picture, Robyn may want to rethink her place in the Brown family&#39;s structure. While she can cast blame on the rest of her ex-sister wives for their part in the decline of her marriage, Robyn hasn&#39;t been able to admit that she&#39;s part of the problem. Robyn has never been a supportive sister wife, especially after joining such an established family unit. As documented throughout Sister Wives, Robyn has always been selfish and more interested in her marriage to Kody than the plural marriage she claims she wanted. Robyn&#39;s faults exist, and it&#39;s about time she owned them.
