## Literature Review
One name has been added to the cast for The White Lotus season 3, and their involvement only increases the hype surrounding the upcoming episodes.




The White Lotus season 3 cast is getting bigger with each passing day, and the HBO television show added one impressive name to its roster a few days following its mass cast reveal. The highly anticipated upcoming season of Mike White&#39;s dark comedy-drama anthology series will start filming in February 2024 following a few delays related to the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. The cast and crew are traveling to Thailand, which will serve as the setting of the third season, following Hawaii in the first season and Italy in the second. Consequentially, the only things known about season 3 are its location and cast.




Reports previously revealed that Natasha Rothwell would reprise her role as Belinda Lindsey from season 1 in the upcoming episodes. In early January 2024, HBO confirmed Rothwell&#39;s return and released many of the other names in the cast of The White Lotus season 3, including Parker Posey, Leslie Bibb, Dom Hetrakul, Jason Isaacs, Michelle Monaghan, and Tayme Thapthimthong. Soon after these actors were announced, HBO added another star to the cast, whose involvement takes the excitement surrounding season 3 to another level.


 Why Carrie Coon Is Perfect For The White Lotus Season 3 (&amp; Elevates Its Cast) 
          

Carrie Coon is the latest actress to join the cast of The White Lotus season 3, but like many of her co-stars, the character she will be playing is unknown. Coon is known for her television roles as Nora Durst in The Leftovers, Gloria Burgle in Fargo, and Bertha Russell in The Gilded Age. She has also appeared in films such as Gone Girl, Widows, The Post, Avengers: Infinity War, and Ghostbusters: Afterlife. Now, Coon can add the HBO anthology series to her repertoire, and she is undoubtedly the perfect addition to the season 3 cast.




The initial cast drop for the upcoming season of The White Lotus contained multiple exciting names, like Parker Posey and Jason Isaacs. But it still felt a bit small compared to previous seasons. Of course, as filming gets closer, HBO will announce more actors in the cast, like Coon. Coon is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood, although she is arguably one of the best television stars of the last decade or so. Her presence elevates the cast with her talent and versatility, and looking at Coon&#39;s past credits, The White Lotus is the perfect show for her. Another Emmy nomination is calling Coon&#39;s name.

                  The White Lotus Season 3 Has Its Jennifer Coolidge Replacement (So More Actors Shouldn&#39;t Return)   One character from season 1 returning to the show might be what The White Lotus&#39; third season needs to overcome Jennifer Coolidge Tanya&#39;s absence.    



 How The White Lotus Season 3&#39;s Cast Compares To Previous Seasons 
          




Only eight of The White Lotus season 3 cast members are known, and more names will likely be unveiled in the coming months. But, at first glance, the roster is quite different from the season 1 and season 2 casts. The new stars are on the older side compared to the previous casts, which included a wide range of ages. Perhaps younger actors will be added to the upcoming season, but for now, the cast of The White Lotus season 3 is still exciting, especially with Carrie Coon&#39;s involvement.



Reports claim that The White Lotus season 3 will likely premiere in 2025.
