## Literature Review
Jibri Bell from 90 Day Fiancé season 9 has been working on his physical and mental health while living in Thailand. His body now has only “10% fat.”




Jibri Bell has transformed his physique after appearing on 90 Day Fiancé season 9 in 2022. The South Dakota man made a big impression on the viewers when he debuted in the franchise. He wore unconventional, bright-colored outfits and remained over the top and flamboyant. Jibri pursued his Serbian girlfriend, Miona Bell, in 90 Day Fiancé season 9. He wasn’t financially prepared for the marriage but seemed hopeful about making her dreams come true and building a home in California. He even made a song for his wedding, which played in the season finale.




Jibri and Miona kicked off their post-marriage lives with a bang. The 30-year-old man was able to cash in on his reality TV fame by selling his torn pants to an interested buyer. At the same time, the Serbian woman turned her passion into a business and built a ponytail extension brand, Miona Beauty. The couple seemed happy, wealthy, and content with their lives in early 2023. However, things changed for some unknown reasons in the summer, and Jibri flew to Southeast Asia to pursue a more spiritual life, while Miona stayed in Palm Springs to work on her brand.
