## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé fans started suspecting Tim Malcolm was either gay or a trans man after watching him romance Jeniffer Tarazona on Before the 90 Days.




90 Day: The Single Life season 4 cast member Tim Malcolm took aim at his critics after revealing that he will star in the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Tim is a 43-year-old man from Charlotte, North Carolina, where he owns a custom gun business called Gringo Custom Guns that specializes in rare and exotic firearms. He first starred in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 3 with his then-Colombian girlfriend Jeniffer Tarazona. Tim and Jeniffer met in person for the first time on the show, but he never expressed any interest in her sexually. She asked him to man up.




90 Day Fiancé fans asked Tim if he was gay or transgender, but Tim has always maintained that he is not attracted to men in any way and that he is cisgender.


 

In his latest post where he confirmed that he&#39;s making a comeback via 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, Tim wrote, &#34;I hope all of you guys will show up to mock, ridicule, question my sexuality, discuss if im transitioning from a woman to man.&#34; He called it the &#34;usual &#39;Tim&#39; conversation.&#34; Tim also mentioned comments about him wearing eyeliner or having shapely eyebrows. He commented that there are critics who compare him to The Grinch. &#34;I just wouldn’t know how to live my life without reading that for another couple of years!&#34; Tim wrote with sarcasm.

Tim also had a message for his true supporters. He addressed those who followed him regardless of the negative rhetoric. He told them that they would enjoy The Single Life because there are some great cast members this season. A fan asked Tim if he is a part of the Veronica Rodriguez and Jamal Menzies&#39; storyline or if the cast member is exploring his own single life since the trailer showed him butting heads with Jamal. Tim replied, &#34;No I have my own story on this one.&#34; A different follower wrote to Tim saying, &#34;I thought you had been happy with Linda for years.&#34;

They were talking about Linda Ramirez, whom Tim had introduced as his girlfriend during an episode of 90 Day Bares All in March 2021. Tim confirmed he was still dating Linda in October 2021. He claimed he had been in a relationship with her for two years. Linda was also from Colombia, like Tim&#39;s ex-girlfriend Jeniffer. However, the native Spanish speaker had moved to the U.S. sometime in 2019. Tim claimed he had met Linda on a dating app. Tim and Linda had an age gap of 17 years, but it never bothered their relationship. However, in 2023, Tim started throwing hints that he and Linda were not together anymore.

Tim may have never revealed his breakup because he was already filming 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. He was spotted by a Redditor filming in Charlotte in May 2023. The post has now been deleted, but the photos showed Tim sitting with a mystery woman in a lush green setting and enjoying drinks with her. The woman may have been Tim&#39;s new girlfriend or someone that he was meeting for the first time on the spin-off. After all, 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 is going to be all about firsts: first kisses, first dates, and first loves.






90 Day: The Single Life premieres Monday, January 1, 2024, at 8 p.m. EST On TLC
