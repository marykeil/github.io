# Ezra Bridger Actor Eman Esfandi Has The Perfect Ahsoka Season 2 Theory


## SUMMARY 



  Season 2 of Ahsoka could focus on Ezra Bridger&#39;s mission to bring Sabine Wren and Ahsoka Tano back home, suggests star Eman Esfandi.   The Ezra actor pitches an idea where his character&#39;s goal is to ensure everyone is safe and feels at home, so bringing back Wren and Tano is crucial.   The theory also allows for the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn and exploration of Wren&#39;s and Tano&#39;s experiences on Peridea.

## Literature Review
Ahsoka star Eman Esfandi, who portrays Ezra Bridger, has the perfect theory for the show&#39;s second season, positing it will follow season 1&#39;s pattern.




Ahsoka star Eman Esfandi has the perfect theory for a potential season 2 plot. Esfandi portrayed the live-action iteration of Ezra Bridger in the show&#39;s first season. Meanwhile, the season followed Ahsoka Tano&#39;s (Rosario Dawson) and Sabine Wren&#39;s (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) attempts to bring Bridger home nearly a decade after he went missing while fighting Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen). Unfortunately, the show ends on a cliffhanger, and viewers are still awaiting an official season 2 renewal. However, if it is greenlit, Esfandi already has an idea for the plot.




In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Esfandi revealed his theory for Ahsoka season 2. He theorized that, just as season 1 saw Wren and Tano trying to get Bridger home, season 2 would see the roles reversed as Bridger tries to get Wren and Tano home. The major difference is that the mission should be more straightforward since it has been done before. Esfandi predicts that Bridger will have to find Wren and Tano, as he won&#39;t really feel at home until everyone is safe. Check out his statement below:


His immediate goal will be finding how to get Ahsoka and Sabine back, just like it was for Sabine and Ahsoka when he went missing. But they’ve now got a much better chance at it, because it’s been done by Ezra, Ahsoka and Thrawn. So it’ll be a prescient goal if season two is green lit and whatnot. Bringing them back would be a huge point, because it is not entirely home until everybody is back and safe.



 Eman Esfandi&#39;s Theory Makes Perfect Sense 
          




Esfandi&#39;s season 2 theory makes perfect sense, considering how the first season of Ahsoka ended. In the show, Tano and Wren are forced to travel outside the Star Wars galaxy for the first time to retrieve Bridger from the extragalactic planet of Peridea. Unfortunately, things don&#39;t go according to plan, as Thrawn is also on Peridea. In the end, Bridger makes it home, and Thrawn re-enters the Star Wars galaxy, while Wren and Tano remain stuck on Peridea with seemingly no way to return.

Hence, it almost seems like a given that Bridger will try to save Wren and Tano in Ahsoka season 2. Meanwhile, it would allow the second season to maintain the same pattern as the first, where there&#39;s a dual focus on the rescue mission and the emerging threat of Thrawn. The most obvious way for Bridger to get to Wren and Tano is the Eye of Sion—the hyperspace transport ring that Thrawn left Peridea in. If Bridger&#39;s best bet to saving his friends is Thrawn, this naturally brings Thrawn back into the picture and will likely reveal what he is up to.




The Ahsoka season 2 theory also provides an opportunity to explore Wren&#39;s and Tano&#39;s experiences on Peridea. While the pair seemed content to hunker down on Peridea for the time being, Bridger&#39;s rescue mission means viewers will have to know something of what the pair have been doing on Peridea. Perhaps Tano and Bridger could even find a way to communicate via Force telepathy. Ultimately, Esfandi&#39;s Ahsoka season 2 theory is fairly straightforward and reasonable while also allowing all the major players from the first season to return naturally.
