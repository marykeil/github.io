 12  Kirsten Calls &#34;Homie&#34; She Cheated On Julio With 
Kirsten Called Him During The Tell All 
        

Julio and Kirsten ended their relationship on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 when he couldn’t leave America and didn’t give her a definite timeline. Julio claimed there was a different reason why he decided to split. He said Kirsten had gone dress shopping with a man who she claimed was just a friend. However, they were calling each other “Mami” and “Papi” over texts. Julio claimed to have a video of the conversation between Kirsten and the man but said Kirsten deleted the video from his phone. “He’s my friend still this day. We can call him right now,” said Kirsten, trying to defend her friendship.
She said she sent him a photo of one dress and no nudes, as Julio was trying to suggest. “Cheating is not just physical sex,” Julio declared. The cast pushed Kirsten into calling the man saved as “Homie” on her phone. “No, no, no this is a big, big joke,” the man said when Kirsten asked if she was ever dating him. Meanwhile, the man referred to Julio as “this guy” during the conversation, which led some cast members, like Tim Malcolm, to believe Kirsten was lying. If her friend knew she was getting married to Julio, she wouldn’t have referred to him as “this guy.”

However, when Kirsten was seemingly caught in a lie, she said the real reason Julio broke up with her was that he “found another girl.” The girl’s name was beeped out when Kirsten said it. Kirsten revealed that Julio met a makeup artist in September 2022 before he broke up with Kirsten at a wedding he attended as a DJ. Kirsten saw the two tagged in pictures together on Instagram. Julio broke up with Kirsten two months later and went on vacation with the woman. Julio admitted he&#39;s in a relationship with the woman but maintained they followed each other on Instagram after his breakup.

Kenny Was Upset About It


Kenny said that he and Armando picked an egg donor who went through the whole process. However, the woman ghosted the clinic on the day she was supposed to come in. Kenny couldn’t hold back his tears when he revealed they had to go through the process all over again. He said there were two things in his life that he almost didn’t do, one was being with Armando, and the other was starting a family with Armando, and they were both due to his age. Kenny realized he was thankful he did the surrogacy process in the end because they have seven embryos now.

Kenny Was Unsure About The Embryos They Wanted To Transfer
        

The clinic asked Armando and Kenny how many eggs and embryos they wanted to try and transfer. The couple had been debating over it because Kenny thinks one embryo would be fine, while Armando is insisting on two. They had 15 days left to decide when they filmed the Tell All. Kenny himself wants Armando to change his mind. “This was $74,000,” Kenny shockingly revealed. Tim said he advised Kenny to not go ahead with it because he could tell Kenny did not want to do it. “I feel like he’s doing it more for Armando than himself,” said Tim, who was scared Kenny could have twins.

He admitted Tim messages him, “Hey Daddy,” but it’s all in fun. He said that Tim gets a lot of flak online about his sexual orientation. “And he’s not,” said Kenny about rumors of Tim being gay. Kenny admitted Tim is simply comfortable in his own skin to play around like that.

Daniele said it went “surprisingly fine” because she went to have dinner with Yohan and his family at his house.

She realized that’s the reason why he wanted to live there. Yohan tried explaining that he couldn’t have brought anyone there since the only way to reach the apartment was through the reception area. Daniele caught onto his lie and revealed that they always used the side stairs to go up.

He flashed a Facebook post that showed his picture and a post created by Daniele. She explained that it was a “sanky panky page,” where she made a post and asked other members if anyone was dating this man from the Dominican Republic. She asked the woman to be careful and to not give him money. Daniele admitted she was being petty when she created the post. However, she said that it was effective since more women reached out to her after they saw her post.

When asked if she had plans to go back to South Africa, Holly said, “Not really.” She revealed that she hadn’t spoken to Wayne in two or three weeks.
