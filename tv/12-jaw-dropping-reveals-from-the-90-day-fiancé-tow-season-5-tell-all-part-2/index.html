  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 is ending on a scandalous note with several secrets about the couples being revealed during the Tell-All Part 2.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 has aired its penultimate episode and several shocking moments were revealed in the Tell All Part 2. Couples such as Daniele Gates and Yohan Geronimo, Kenneth “Kenny” Niedermeier and Armando Rubio, and Julio Moya and Kirsten Schoemaker were in attendance. Kimberly Rochelle and TJ Goswami, and Holly Weeks and Wayne Cornish also took center stage to make accusations about each other.
Some of the seven American cast members may have relocated to various parts of the world. Some of those countries include Mexico, the Netherlands, India, The Dominican Republic, and South Africa. They went abroad to find love, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they ended up with their partners. As one part of the epic reunion still remains, here’s everything that Tell All Part 2 has revealed about the couples, including the bittersweet moments and the jaw-dropping ones.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>12  Kirsten Calls &ldquo;Homie&rdquo; She Cheated On Julio With
Kirsten Called Him During The Tell All</p>
<p>Julio and Kirsten ended their relationship on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 when he couldn’t leave America and didn’t give her a definite timeline. Julio claimed there was a different reason why he decided to split. He said Kirsten had gone dress shopping with a man who she claimed was just a friend. However, they were calling each other “Mami” and “Papi” over texts. Julio claimed to have a video of the conversation between Kirsten and the man but said Kirsten deleted the video from his phone. “He’s my friend still this day. We can call him right now,” said Kirsten, trying to defend her friendship.
She said she sent him a photo of one dress and no nudes, as Julio was trying to suggest. “Cheating is not just physical sex,” Julio declared. The cast pushed Kirsten into calling the man saved as “Homie” on her phone. “No, no, no this is a big, big joke,” the man said when Kirsten asked if she was ever dating him. Meanwhile, the man referred to Julio as “this guy” during the conversation, which led some cast members, like Tim Malcolm, to believe Kirsten was lying. If her friend knew she was getting married to Julio, she wouldn’t have referred to him as “this guy.”</p>
<p>11  Kirsten Reveals Julio Has A New Girlfriend
Kirsten Believes Julio Left Her For This New Woman</p>
<p>However, when Kirsten was seemingly caught in a lie, she said the real reason Julio broke up with her was that he “found another girl.” The girl’s name was beeped out when Kirsten said it. Kirsten revealed that Julio met a makeup artist in September 2022 before he broke up with Kirsten at a wedding he attended as a DJ. Kirsten saw the two tagged in pictures together on Instagram. Julio broke up with Kirsten two months later and went on vacation with the woman. Julio admitted he&rsquo;s in a relationship with the woman but maintained they followed each other on Instagram after his breakup.</p>
<p>10  Kenny &amp; Armando&rsquo;s Egg Donor Ghosted Them
Kenny Was Upset About It</p>
<p>Kenny said that he and Armando picked an egg donor who went through the whole process. However, the woman ghosted the clinic on the day she was supposed to come in. Kenny couldn’t hold back his tears when he revealed they had to go through the process all over again. He said there were two things in his life that he almost didn’t do, one was being with Armando, and the other was starting a family with Armando, and they were both due to his age. Kenny realized he was thankful he did the surrogacy process in the end because they have seven embryos now.</p>
<p>9  Kenny &amp; Armando Spent $74,000 On The Surrogacy
Kenny Was Unsure About The Embryos They Wanted To Transfer</p>
<p>The clinic asked Armando and Kenny how many eggs and embryos they wanted to try and transfer. The couple had been debating over it because Kenny thinks one embryo would be fine, while Armando is insisting on two. They had 15 days left to decide when they filmed the Tell All. Kenny himself wants Armando to change his mind. “This was $74,000,” Kenny shockingly revealed. Tim said he advised Kenny to not go ahead with it because he could tell Kenny did not want to do it. “I feel like he’s doing it more for Armando than himself,” said Tim, who was scared Kenny could have twins.</p>
<p>8  Kenny Confirms That Tim Is Not Gay
Tim Calls Kenny &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armando exposed Tim on the Tell All by asking him a question. He asked, “Are you sure nothing has gone down in New York when you’re there with him?” while adding that Tim calls Kenny “daddy” via text. “Oh my God,” gasped Kenny. He admitted Tim messages him, “Hey Daddy,” but it’s all in fun. He said that Tim gets a lot of flak online about his sexual orientation. “And he’s not,” said Kenny about rumors of Tim being gay. Kenny admitted Tim is simply comfortable in his own skin to play around like that.</p>
<p>7  Daniele &amp; Yohan Agreed They Won&rsquo;t Be &ldquo;Enemies&rdquo; After Split
Daniele Respects His Mother &amp; Sister</p>
<p>Daniele confirmed she and Yohan were still separated during the Tell All Part 1. However, when the host, Shaun Robinson, asked them when was the last time they saw each other in person, Yohan said it was two weeks ago. Daniele said it went “surprisingly fine” because she went to have dinner with Yohan and his family at his house. When Tania Maduro asked why she would do that since Yohan doesn’t deserve her time or friendship, Daniele said, “I value his mother, his sisters.” Yohan confessed that when they broke up, they agreed they didn’t need to be enemies.</p>
<p>6  Yohan Was In A Relationship With 50-60 Women
It Was Difficult For Daniele To Keep Count</p>
<p>Daniele spoke about Yohan’s secret girlfriend messaging her to tell her about her giving him money and coming to their apartment to sleep with Yohan. Daniele said the first time Yohan slept with the woman was a month before he married Daniele. She had receipts that Yohan was with “woman after woman after woman” and taking money from them. The woman sent Daniele a photo of Yohan’s “very private part.” When Shaun asked her how many women she thought Yohan had slept with, Daniele said she didn’t keep count, but it would be close to “like 50 or 60.”</p>
<p>5  Daniele Claimed Yohan Used Their House As &ldquo;Sanky Panky Home&rdquo;
Yohan Wanted To Live   To The Hotel He Worked At</p>
<p>Daniele revealed the real reason why Yohan picked the apartment complex for their home. She said Yohan had affairs at the hotel where he worked “the whole time.” She called it his “wh*** hotel.” As per Daniele, after he brought the women to his hotel, he took them to the apartment complex. She realized that’s the reason why he wanted to live there. Yohan tried explaining that he couldn’t have brought anyone there since the only way to reach the apartment was through the reception area. Daniele caught onto his lie and revealed that they always used the side stairs to go up.</p>
<p>4  Daniele Posted Warning About Yohan On &ldquo;Sanky Panky&rdquo; Facebook Page
Yohan Called Out Daniele For The Page</p>
<p>Yohan blamed Daniele for going on social media sites and talking bad about him to some women and accused Daniele of defaming him. He flashed a Facebook post that showed his picture and a post created by Daniele. She explained that it was a “sanky panky page,” where she made a post and asked other members if anyone was dating this man from the Dominican Republic. She asked the woman to be careful and to not give him money. Daniele admitted she was being petty when she created the post. However, she said that it was effective since more women reached out to her after they saw her post.</p>
<p>3  Yash &amp; Kimberly Are Making Progress In Their Relationship
Yash Likes Kimberly As His Sister-In-Law</p>
<p>Kimberly’s brother-in-law, Yash Goswami, was invited to the Tell All. The scene where Yash called Kimberly “stupid&quot; was shown to cast members. Kimberly maintained that she never disrespected TJ or his family. Meanwhile, Yash decided not to interfere in the issues between TJ and Kimberly. Yash said Kimberly has been making an effort to go downstairs to mingle with his family. He even said he liked Kimberly being his sister-in-law now. “We are family and ultimately we have to we have to heal everything,” Yash said.​​​​​​​</p>
<p>2  Holly Hadn&rsquo;t Spoken To Wayne In 2-3 Weeks
Holly Moved Back To The U.S.</p>
<p>Holly said she flew back to the U.S. because her mom was very sick, and she had some credit card debt back in South Africa. Holly thought she would get a job in the U.S. so she could pay off her debt quickly. When asked if she had plans to go back to South Africa, Holly said, “Not really.” She revealed that she hadn’t spoken to Wayne in two or three weeks. Wayne claimed his phone kept on dying, which was likely an excuse. She also believes Wayne didn’t like the fact that she wasn’t fun anymore.</p>
<p>1  Holly Runs Away From Tell All Set Mid-Filming
Wayne Isn&rsquo;t Sure He &amp; Holly Will Stay Together</p>
<p>Holly kept crying during the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All. Cast members observed that Holly was crying because she wanted Wayne to comfort her, but Wayne didn’t make an effort to comfort her. She wanted Wayne to tell her he was there for her. Wayne said he was supporting her financially; however, Wayne didn’t realize he wasn’t providing her with emotional support. Shaun asked Wayne if he saw a future in their relationship, and he said, “I don’t know,” which made Holly get up from the set and start running backstage in a state of panic.
