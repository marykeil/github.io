## Literature Review
Harry Kim famously had a long line of failed romances during his time on Star Trek: Voyager, but some of his relationships were better than others.




Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) had a multitude of failed romances during his time on Star Trek: Voyager. Harry was the USS Voyager&#39;s operations officer, serving on the bridge for all seven seasons of the show as part of the main cast. Harry was the youngest member of Voyager&#39;s senior staff, but also very gifted, hardworking, idealistic, and eager to prove himself. Despite some slights during Voyager&#39;s run (such as his &#34;Eternal Ensign&#34; status), Harry was a valuable member of the crew and had his fair share of interesting storylines.
One of Harry&#39;s most notable character traits was his failure in the romance department. After leaving behind a committed relationship when Voyager became stranded in the Delta Quadrant, Harry suffered through a string of ill-advised crushes, failed romances, and heartbreaking one-sided relationships throughout the series. While other characters like Harry&#39;s best friend Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) managed to find stable love, Harry seemed to always be the one left alone at the end. However, some of Harry&#39;s failed romances were undeniably more compelling than others.
            
 
 15 Star Trek Characters Promoted Faster Than Voyager&#39;s Harry Kim 
Harry Kim was famously never promoted, but lots of other Star Trek characters have been promoted faster, making his Starfleet career look even worse.













 








 10  Eudana 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 1, episode 10, &#34;Prime Factors&#34;
        

Harry&#39;s very first on-screen foray into romance was in &#34;Prime Factors,&#34; a Voyager season 1 episode that saw the crew stop at a planet inhabited by the Sikarians, a hedonistic race who offered everyone some rest and relaxation. While taking shore leave on the planet, Harry had a very brief and utterly forgettable flirtation with Eudana (Yvonne Suhor), a Sikarian woman. Besides it being the first time Voyager depicted Harry being attracted to someone, the only other significance Eudana had in Harry&#39;s story was helping to kick off the episode&#39;s real plot when she showed Harry technology created by the Sikarians that could potentially get Voyager home.





 9  Rinna and Eliann 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 3, episode 20, &#34;Favorite Son&#34;
        

&#34;Favorite Son&#34; is a famously unpopular episode of Voyager, but did feature Harry nearly marrying two women, Rinna (Kelli Kirkland) and Eliann (Cari Shayne), who were attempting to harvest his genetic material and kill him in the process. Harry&#39;s gullibility in almost falling for the two women&#39;s scheme is often cited as a great example of his failure to engage in meaningful romantic relationships. The fact that barely anything happened between the three and the level of criticism &#34;Favorite Son&#34; garnered after its release make Harry&#39;s relationship with Rinna and Eliann one of his worst romantic subplots.





 8  Linnis Paris 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 3, episode 21, &#34;Before and After&#34;
        

&#34;Before and After&#34; introduced audiences to a bizarre alternate timeline where Kes (Jennifer Lien) was married to Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) and Harry was married to their daughter, Linnis (Jessica Collins). Although Linnis and Harry&#39;s relationship seemed fairly genuine, with the two even having a son together, Voyager did not make it the focus of the episode. Most likely, this was because the family dynamics of having Harry go from Tom&#39;s best friend to son-in-law were bizarre and hard to digest. Luckily, the timeline in &#34;Before and After&#34; never came to pass, meaning that Linnis was never born and the real Harry never met her.





 7  Irina 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 7, episode 3, &#34;Drive&#34;
        

Irina (Cyia Batten) was an alien woman who became Harry&#39;s racing partner when he and Tom decided to participate in a drag race being held as a cooperative gesture between two warring species. The only reason Irina ranks a bit higher on Harry&#39;s list of paramours is because she was at least a slightly more normal choice than some of the women he had become attracted to before. However, the fact that Irina was eventually revealed to be a terrorist and that basically nothing happened between her and Harry, at least on-screen, makes her a fairly forgettable example of Harry&#39;s romantic partners as well.





 6  Marayna 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 4, episode 14, &#34;Alter Ego&#34;


 







&#34;Alter Ego&#34; was an episode full of twists and turns, all centered around Marayna (Sandra Nelson). Although seemingly only a hologram, Marayna was revealed to actually be the avatar of a lonely alien looking for connection, which she found first in Harry and then in Tuvok (Tim Russ). The object of Marayna&#39;s affections quickly switched away from Harry when she met Tuvok, but watching Harry grapple with the moral dilemma of being attracted to a non-sentient hologram was a fun premise for the episode to begin with. Additionally, Harry&#39;s crush on Marayna was referenced a few times throughout Voyager&#39;s run, when Tom Paris would tease Harry about his romantic issues.





 5  Megan Delaney 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 5, episode 9, &#34;Thirty Days&#34;
        

One half of the infamous Delaney sisters, Megan Delaney (Heidi Kramer) was only featured on-screen in &#34;Thirty Days&#34; although she and her sister Jenny (Alissa Kramer) were mentioned as early as Voyager season 1. Nothing was ever shown to have happened between Harry and either of the Delaney sisters, but their status as important minor characters on Voyager thanks to Tom and Harry&#39;s flirtation with them elevates Harry&#39;s crush on Megan to another level. Unfortunately, Harry&#39;s attraction to Megan was ultimately doomed since Jenny was the one who was in love with him.





 4  Seven of Nine 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 4, episode 5, &#34;Revulsion&#34;


 







Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) briefly became the object of Harry&#39;s affection when she joined Voyager&#39;s main cast in season 4. Given how popular Seven became as a character and her significance to the Star Trek franchise even in modern times, her and Harry&#39;s very brief flirtation is an interesting &#34;what if&#34; scenario. Seven&#39;s lack of understanding of human social norms led to some hilarious moments when she propositioned Harry during the episode &#34;Revulsion,&#34; and Harry&#39;s short-lived crush was another failure that Tom would go on to tease Harry about often, keeping it alive in the minds of viewers during future Voyager episodes.





 3  Libby 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 2, episode 5, &#34;Non Sequitur&#34;
        

Libby (Jennifer Gatti) was Harry&#39;s girlfriend back on Earth before he was lost in the Delta Quadrant with the rest of Voyager&#39;s crew. Libby only appeared in one episode, likely because despite their relationship status, the chemistry between her and Harry didn&#39;t pop on-screen. However, Harry very clearly cared deeply for Libby, and she was one of the main motivating factors in his desire to get back home, which was a huge aspect of his character. Their relationship was referenced multiple times throughout Voyager&#39;s run, and although Harry seemed to have moved in later seasons, his character arc would have been very different without the inclusion of Libby.





 2  Derran Tal 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 5, episode 17, &#34;The Disease&#34;
        

&#34;The Disease&#34; became one of Harry&#39;s more interesting episodes, featuring a significant character arc for him thanks to his relationship with Derran Tal (Musetta Vander). However, rather than Tal herself being the important factor, the existence of their relationship was the catalyst for some compelling scenes between Harry and Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew). After Tal essentially gave Harry the equivalent of an STI without his knowledge, Captain Janeway&#39;s disapproval led to a genuine heart-to-heart between her and Harry and some character growth on both sides. In terms of Tal, although their relationship was short-lived, Harry did seem to genuinely care for her.





 1  Lyndsay Ballard 
In Star Trek: Voyager season 6, episode 18, &#34;Ashes to Ashes&#34;


 







By far the most interesting and tragic of Harry&#39;s ill-fated romances on Voyager was with Lyndsay Ballard (Kim Rhodes), a former crew member who died and was subsequently resurrected by an alien race called the Kobali. Although Star Trek: Voyager should have depicted Ballard&#39;s death in an earlier episode for better continuity, she was the most compelling of Harry&#39;s relationships during the show&#39;s run. Rhodes is a phenomenal actor and played Ballard with a hilarious charm that helped make the character instantly compelling. Along with this, everyone loves a good unrequited love story, and Ballard and Harry&#39;s tragically short romance was genuinely sweet as well as sad.
Star Trek: Voyager is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
