# Why Peaky Blinders Killed Off Grace In Season 3


## SUMMARY 



  Grace Shelby&#39;s death in Peaky Blinders was necessary for the show to continue because it prevents Tommy from finding happiness and gives him a reason to seek revenge.   Grace&#39;s death adds emotional depth to Tommy&#39;s character by allowing viewers to sympathize with his grief and guilt. She even appears as a hallucination throughout the show, but is absent in the final season.   Tommy Shelby&#39;s redemption arc is tied to the absence of Grace&#39;s ghost in the final season, indicating that he no longer feels the need to join her in death and is moving away from his life of crime.

## Literature Review
Grace was a significant part of Tommy Shelby&#39;s life in Peaky Blinders, but the fan-favorite character had to die. Here&#39;s why Grace was killed off.




While Peaky Blinders fans have endured countless heartbreaking moments throughout the show&#39;s run, none have been as devastating as the death of Grace Shelby. Played by Annabelle Wallis, Grace is introduced in the first episode of the historical true-crime drama series Peaky Blinders, working in a pub called The Garrison. Throughout her time on the show, Grace becomes a fan favorite, making the showrunner&#39;s decision to have Grace die in Peaky Blinders even more shocking.




In the British period drama Peaky Blinders, Grace is secretly an undercover spy for the Birmingham police tasked with getting close to Peaky Blinders leader Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy). The pair eventually fall in love, but when Tommy discovers her initial motives, they separate. In Peaky Blinders season 2, Grace is reintroduced into Tommy&#39;s life as married to another man, but their feelings remain the same, leading them to have a child together and get married. Grace and Tommy&#39;s happiness doesn&#39;t last long, though. She is shot by an assassin hired by Vicente Changretta — a shocking moment followed by the immensely tragic scene when Grace dies in Peaky Blinders.

                  10 Incredibly Heartbreaking Deaths In Peaky Blinders   A lot of characters die in Peaky Blinders, but there are 10 character deaths in the show that are more heartbreaking than the rest of them.    


 Why Grace Shelby Dies In Peaky Blinders 
Grace Living Would Have Provided Tommy With Too Much Happiness
          




While Grace dies in Peaky Blinders in a massively shocking way, it is the only way for the show to continue. Speaking to fans, creator Steven Knight stated that the creative reasoning behind Grace&#39;s death was simply that Tommy wasn&#39;t supposed to be happy (via Reddit). If Grace were to remain alive, Tommy would have felt satisfied with his life and probably stepped away from the Peaky Blinders, but her death gives him a reason to be angry and seek retribution.


&#34;The point with Grace is that if she had lived, Tommy would have been happy. He wasn&#39;t meant to be happy.&#34;


Additionally, there was a narrative justification for Grace dying in Peaky Blinders. Grace&#39;s death gives Tommy&#39;s character more emotional depth, allowing viewers to sympathize with his obvious grief and guilt. Grace often manifests as a ghostly hallucination as the show progresses, even appearing before Tommy as he attempts to take his own life in the season 5 finale. However, she is notably absent from Peaky Blinders&#39; final season.




                  Peaky Blinders: Why John Shelby Was Killed Off In Season 4   Peaky Blinders&#39; Season 4 premiere episode killed off the character of John &#34;Johnny&#34; Shelby. Why was this was the case?    



 Why Grace&#39;s Ghost Didn&#39;t Return In Peaky Blinders Season 6 
Tommy Shouldn&#39;t See Grace Again Until His Redemption Arc Is Complete
          

 Grace&#39;s ghost doesn&#39;t return in the final season of Peaky Blinders because Tommy Shelby finally reaches the start of his redemption arc after being brought down to his lowest point. After years of struggling with an opium addiction that contributed to his guilt and hallucinations of Grace, he finally doesn&#39;t feel a need to join her in death. This, in turn, ties in with the rest of Tommy&#39;s arc throughout Peaky Blinders season 6, with the show ending with him seemingly turning away from his life of crime and leaving the Peaky Blinders empire in the hands of his son, Charles, and Arthur.





 

While Grace&#39;s story has seemingly come to a close when Grace dies in Peaky Blinders, Tommy still has a long way to go if his character is to receive a proper redemption arc. With many unanswered questions from the ending of Peaky Blinders season 6, particularly regarding Tommy&#39;s sanity, much more needs to be done to complete his story. However, with a spin-off movie of Peaky Blinders currently in the works, fans won&#39;t have to wait much longer for more Tommy Shelby.

                  How Peaky Blinders Ends: Will Tommy Shelby Die?   Peaky Blinders will end its television run with season 6, which promises more intrigue and gang violence, but Tommy’s survival is questionable.

Since Grace died in Peaky Blinders, actress Annabelle Wallis has had plenty of time on her hands to continue her career — which has gone from strength to strength since Grace Shelby was written off the show. Directly after Peaky Blinders, Wallis joined the Dark Universe by starring as archeologist Jenny Halsey in The Mummy reboot in 2016. In that same year, she also played the role of Maggie in Guy Ritchie&#39;s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.

The actress got another leading role in 2018 in the comedy Tag as Rebecca Crosby, opposite the likes of comedy legends Ed Helms and Jake Johnson. She was also in the SHOWTIME miniseries The Loudest Voice as head of booking at Fox News Channel Laurie Luhn. Yet another leading role for Annabelle Wallis, she featured in the James Wan horror film Malignant as the protagonist Madison. Most recently, Wallis appeared in the Christmas comedy Silent Night, alongside Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode. So, despite being killed off in Peaky Blinders, it looks like Annabelle Wallis isn&#39;t slowing down any time soon.

 Could Grace Ever Return To Peaky Blinders? 
Some Theories Have Come Up With Ways For Grace To Return
          

Grace died in Peaky Blinders and this was a turning point for Thomas Shelby. However, that doesn’t mean there can&#39;t be a way for him to come back from it. Ever since losing Grace, Tommy has had hallucinations of her, suggesting it is the one thing that haunts him more than anything else he has done. This has led some fans to feel Tommy&#39;s path to redemption lies in the reveal that Grace is not dead. The Peaky Blinders season 1 cliffhanger suggested Grace&#39;s death, only for that to be revealed as a fake-out. Before falling for Tommy, Grace was a successful secret agent who could conceivably stage her death if needed.




Some of the theories suggest Grace faked her death because she was still working undercover. Others theorize she did it to protect her family from outside forces who were threatening them. These ideas may sound outlandish, but actor Annabelle Wallis praised the imaginative fans (via Digital Spy). She admits it is &#34;exciting to see people get inspired that way, and long for the characters that way&#34; and also insists &#34;I&#39;m open to them.&#34; While Wallis did not return in the final season of the show, the Peaky Blinders movie could show these theories had validity and that Tommy could finally find peace from Grace&#39;s Peaky Blinders death.
