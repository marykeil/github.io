## Literature Review
Throughout the past 21 seasons, American Idol has featured many finalists who&#39;ve proven that contestants don&#39;t have to win in order to be successful.




Throughout the past 21 seasons, American Idol has featured some extraordinary finalists who&#39;ve proven that contestants don&#39;t have to win the show in order to be super successful. American Idol debuted on June 11, 2002 on FOX, where it aired for 15 seasons until its series finale on April 7, 2016. After a two-year hiatus, ABC revived the show on March 11, 2018. Although the judges have changed over the years, Ryan Seacrest has hosted for all 21 seasons. The current judging panel consists of Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan.
Although winning American Idol is an outstanding achievement for singers, sometimes just being a finalist on the show can catapult a contestant to superstardom. In fact, some of the finalists who didn&#39;t win have surpassed the actual winners in record sales, film, television, and Broadway appearances, and more. Here&#39;s a list of the most successful American Idol losers of all-time, in no particular order.
