Following suit of several other fantasy reboots, Disney is developing an Eragon series based on Christopher Paolini&#39;s fantasy saga, The Inheritance Cycle. Eragon and its sequels follow the title character Eragon, who discovers a dragon egg in the forest near his home and becomes a rider bonded to the dragon Saphira. Eragon finds himself in the middle of a war to save the kingdom of Alagaësia.
Disney faces the challenges of adapting the novels&#39; extensive world-building, larger-than-life characters, and fantasy concepts that may be awkward on screen. The Inheritance Cycle was previously adapted into the movie Eragon, which bombed at the box office because of its poor writing and acting. The movie demonstrates just some of the difficulties of creating an Eragon TV show. The show will also have to adapt additional characters and concepts introduced in the later books if it is renewed after the first season.









 








 10  World-Building Alagaësia 
Eragon might need more than four seasons.
        

The Inheritance Cycle is primarily set in the country of Alagaësia, which has an extensive history and mythology. Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Urgals, and other races all play a role in the story. The books introduce the history of Alagaësia through supporting characters, primarily Brom, who explain things at length to Eragon. However, there is only so long they can talk in a TV show before the exposition becomes tedious.
Disney could cut the setting&#39;s non-essential elements, but it would lessen the world&#39;s depth. The Eragon TV show would probably benefit from five or six seasons, rather than just one season for each of the four books. This way, the story has more time to progressively introduce different parts of the world as they become relevant.





 9  Eragon &amp; Arya&#39;s Relationship 
Eragon and Arya&#39;s actors need to implicitly convey a profound relationship.


 







While Eragon expresses his feelings for the Elf princess Arya multiple times throughout the books, Arya rejects him because she believes that neither of them can afford to be distracted from the coming war. The movie was criticized for its flat characterization of Arya. The actors playing Eragon and Arya in the Eragon reboot will be challenged with depicting a profound relationship between the two characters without anything ever happening between them. These actors will hopefully have good writers to help them bring Eragon and Arya&#39;s dynamic to life.
            
 
 10 Most Important Eragon Characters That Disney&#39;s Reboot Can&#39;t Afford To Fail 
Disney&#39;s reboot of Eragon needs to take special care crafting 10 of the book series&#39; most important characters to avoid the movie&#39;s mistakes.









 8  Writing Compelling Supporting Character Arcs 
Murtagh, Nasuada, Roran, and Brom should all be fully developed characters.


 







The Inheritance Cycle also includes many interesting supporting characters whose arcs must be included in the show. Supporting characters who are essential to the plot include Murtagh, who is both an antagonist and ally to Eragon at different points; Nasuada, the rebellious daughter of the Varden&#39;s leader who steps into the role herself after her father&#39;s death; Roran, Eragon&#39;s cousin who is drawn into the conflict; and Brom, Eragon&#39;s mentor with a mysterious past. The show must find the right actors and the necessary screen time, so all these characters are given their due.





 7  Elva 
Elva will be a particularly difficult character to adapt.

In the first book, Eragon accidentally curses an orphaned baby girl because he is not adept at using the Ancient Language yet. The girl Elva feels the pain of others and can sense oncoming dangers. Her curse to &#34;be a shield&#34; causes her to age rapidly, so she can better accomplish this role. At only a few months old, she appears to be a small child and speaks like a grown woman.
Elva is a morally gray character in the series who does not always use her power for good. Disney will need to find a young actress who can convey Elva&#39;s ethereal nature as well as her selfishness, possibly using some effects to give her an older-sounding voice. They might age Elva up to 12 or 13 just so she will be easier to cast.





 6  Creating Good Action Sequences (With Dragons) 
Eragon will need a big budget to cover the dragons.
        

The action sequences in Eragon will be expensive to produce and difficult to plan, especially those involving dragons. The CGI is also a weakness of the Eragon movie, but Disney will likely invest the necessary resources into the show. Game of Thrones introduced dragons within a big-budget fantasy television show, but the original series never depicted any dragons fighting against each other. House of the Dragon season 2 will include this and could inspire the Eragon team. While additional dragons for Eragon and Saphira to combat do not appear until Eldest, Eragon&#39;s first season still must live up to past fantasy battles in movies and TV.
            
 
 10 Reasons Fantasy TV Shows Are Still So Hard To Adapt (Despite Fantasy Being Huge Right Now) 
Many studios have tried to recapture the success of Game of Thrones with their own fantasy shows. Here are the reasons why it&#39;s so difficult.









 5  Casting Galbatorix 
The Inheritance Cycle&#39;s main villain will probably be played by a famous actor.
        

Many of the main characters in The Inheritance Cycle have supernatural powers that make them conceptually bigger than any realistic human. For example, the main villain King Galbatorix is built up throughout the series as a force who is impossible to beat. Galbatorix was a dragon rider himself who betrayed the other riders. His second dragon Shruikan is gargantuan, bigger than any other dragon in the series. Disney will likely want an A-lister who already carries a kind of gravitas to play Galbatorix.





 4  Unique Production &amp; Costume Design 
Eragon should not copy other fantasy franchises.


 







Disney will likely look to other fantasy adaptations such as The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones for inspiration for Eragon&#39;s production and costume design. All modern fantasy series featuring elves or fae are arguably inspired by The Lord of the Rings. However, Eragon faces the challenge of not looking like a carbon copy of previous franchises. Talented designers will be able to put a new spin on typical fantasy costumes, while the production team might consider new locations for filming. Game of Thrones was filmed in Ireland and Spain at different points, while the original Lord of the Rings trilogy was completed in New Zealand.





 3  Creating The Ra&#39;zac 
The Inheritance Cycle&#39;s monsters need to be terrifying.

In The Inheritance Cycle, the Ra&#39;zac are a nearly-extinct ancient race that feeds on humans. The last two Ra&#39;zac serve Galbatorix by hunting dragon riders. They are conceptually similar to the Nazgûl from The Lord of the Rings or the dementors from Harry Potter, but the Ra&#39;zac have an exoskeleton and a hooked beak. Disney&#39;s Eragon will have to think creatively to make these creatures as scary as they are in the books. Hopefully, Eragon will innovate in how they capture the Ra&#39;zac.





 2  Eragon &amp; Saphira&#39;s Telepathic Communication 
Eragon and Saphira&#39;s communication is awkward in the movie.
        

Eragon and Saphira are bonded, so he hears her speaking in his head, and he can communicate similarly or speak out loud. The movie failed to capture the depth of their connection, which will be difficult for the show as well. Having Saphira &#34;speak&#34; out loud might come across as awkward, but she does need to speak enough to develop her character. Their communication is more organic in the books where the dialogue is simply italicized. Disney will need to carefully consider how to approach this – Saphira&#39;s voiceover is probably unavoidable, but they may be able to occasionally show Eragon instinctively understand her without speaking.
            
 
 8 Fantasy Books That Are Getting Movies &amp; TV Shows 
Some of the most captivating TV shows and movies are in the fantasy genre, so here are 8 more fantasy novels that are being adapted for the screen.









 1  Abridging The Inheritance Cycle For Television 
The Eragon TV show must remain true to the story.
        

Every epic fantasy series that has ever been adapted has needed to eliminate some elements, and Eragon will be the same. However, one of the biggest issues with the movie adaptation was that it was not true to the books. Disney&#39;s show must retain the most essential elements, such as the main characters&#39; development and key relationships, to maintain the feel of the original story. The Inheritance Cycle is a complex fantasy series with an extensive world and many characters – Disney has its work cut out when it comes to adapting these novels.
