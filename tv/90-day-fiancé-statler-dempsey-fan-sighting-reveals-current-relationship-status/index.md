## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 couple Statler Riley and Dempsey Wilkinson confirm if they&#39;re still together in a surprising update.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Statler Riley&#39;s current relationship status with Dempsey Wilkinson has been revealed after a surprise fan sighting. Statler is a 33-year-old who grew up with ADHD in a family that adopted her right after her birth. Statler felt like the black sheep of her family and decided to move to England once she fell for Dempsey, who&#39;s from Darlington, England. Statler, however, had not told Dempsey about her plans when they saw each other in person on the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Dempsey was taken aback by Statler&#39;s request to move in with her but still chose to continue dating her.




Statler and Dempsey announced they were going on a Euro trip together in a caravan during the Before the 90 Days Tell-All, and Kmas0_0 on Reddit recently posted a photo that shows where the 90 Day Fiancé couple is right now.


 

The photo shows Statler and Dempsey looking happy together while they pose in what appears to be a convenience store. The fan wrote that Statler and Dempsey were spotted in London. The OP&#39;s mom approached the couple to ask them for a photo or selfie while apologizing for not remembering their names. &#34;I died when she sent this to me,&#34; the OP added. They confirmed that the photo was taken at Leicester Square.

Meanwhile, another Reddit user, PaleKey6424, told the OP, &#34;It&#39;s in Westminster mate.&#34; The OP said something about Statler and Dempsey selling candy at a booth. When Statler and Dempsey decided to take their dream trip around Europe, they were going to buy a caravan but had been facing financial troubles. Dempsey didn&#39;t have work, so she was thinking of doing odd jobs while she selling her things to earn some cash. Statler, meanwhile, worked remotely, so she became the only earning member in the relationship, even though she didn&#39;t seem to mind it. The couple didn&#39;t make it look like a big issue.

It&#39;s not clear if Statler has moved to the U.K. for good. However, her supposedly working at a store and selling candy could mean that she moved and has already found a job there. Dempsey was worried about whether she was going too fast in the relationship since Statler had a British ex before her. Statler&#39;s ex-girlfriend broke up with her when Statler pitched the idea of moving in with her. Dempsey was cautious about Statler and decided to take things slower. Statler was also in touch with her ex, which was a cause of concern for Dempsey. Statler did convince her that the two of them were simply friends and nothing was going on between them.




Another thing that worried Dempsey was Statler refusing to have kids with her in the future. Dempsey almost broke up with Statler when the latter said she didn’t think she had the “maternal bone” in her body and said she wasn’t interested in adopting a child. The 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days couple decided it was a debate they could save for later. Their photo shows that Statler and Dempsey have managed to overcome the challenges they faced on the reality TV show and are still together, despite their critics saying they were an incompatible couple.
