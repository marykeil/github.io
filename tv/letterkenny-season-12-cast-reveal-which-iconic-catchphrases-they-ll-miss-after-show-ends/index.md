With the Hulu comedy now at an end, the Letterkenny cast reveal which iconic catchphrases they&#39;ll miss after the show&#39;s ending. The final season of the hit Canadian comedy sees the main group living in the eponymous town considering moving on with their lives as Wayne is broken up with by Rosie, Katy finds herself in love with the country of Mexico, Daryl falls in with the local Degens and Dan prepares to take the next step with Lovina Dyck. Meanwhile, Reilly and Jonesy try to convince Katy to stay in Letterkenny while Stewart and Roald look to find the next exciting venture for their drug dealing.




In honor of the series finale, Screen Rant interviewed Letterkenny season 12 cast members Michelle Mylett, Dylan Playfair, K. Trevor Wilson, Andrew Herr and Tyler Johnston to reflect on the show&#39;s run. When asked which of the comedy&#39;s iconic catchphrases they&#39;ll miss getting to be a part of their work lexicon, the group all pointed to a variety of options, with Playfair even humorously explaining he&#39;s had to change his way of talking to avoid sounding like Reilly in real life while Wilson pointed to one specific quote that will &#34;haunt&#34; him for the rest of his life. Check out what the group shared below:


Tyler Johnston: I didn&#39;t have too many, I didn&#39;t get to have too many disses, I was usually the one getting dissed. But for me, the one I really liked was &#34;shirt tucker,&#34; because it almost felt like motherf---er. So it was like I could lean into shirtucker a little bit, and it was the one that I felt like I had some power over. &#34;You have your life together so much that you&#39;re tucking in your shirt, you loser.&#34; [Laughs] So that always felt like an interesting insult that I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll call anyone in my life a shirt tucker, but it felt good at the time.
Andrew Herr: That&#39;s a tough question. I don&#39;t know why, I always loved when there would be a girl walking by, and I would always be like &#34;snipe!&#34;. I don&#39;t know why, maybe it&#39;s the tone of it, but I just loved saying that. I think I&#39;ll miss saying that, because I definitely don&#39;t say that.
Tyler Johnston: Something we can&#39;t do in real life.
Andrew Herr: Like walk around Toronto, going, &#34;Snipe, snipe, snipe&#34; [Laughs] —
Tyler Johnston: &#34;Sniper, sniper, sniper&#34;. [Laughs]
Andrew Herr: I also have a fiancée, so I&#39;m gonna keep the horse blinders on. Yeah, I mean, all of it, Dylan and I had so many just ridiculous things to say. Specifically, I think it&#39;s like season 2 or season 2, we&#39;re talking about getting our space dink sucked in outer space and sucking on Martian t----es. It&#39;s like, &#34;What are we even saying? Like, what are we actually f---ng saying?&#34; [Laughs] But it was hilarious.
Michelle Mylett: Off the top of my head, I think &#34;to be fair&#34;, I don&#39;t know if I said it a lot before, or it&#39;s just infiltrated my brain, because I do say it a lot in my present life. I think that must be because of Letterkenny. The other ones I probably, to be totally frank, won&#39;t use, and might be kind of weird if I was like Michelle saying &#34;pitter patter&#34; to people, it&#39;d be a bit of a bad look. But, yeah, they were all really fun, and it was cool to watch our fan base catch on to them so much. It&#39;s got a bit of a cult vibe to it, in a good way, and yeah, I&#39;ll miss that and also enjoy people still using those words.
Dylan Playfair: Yeah, I had to change the way I spoke, because it was hijacked by the character I played, Reilly. Lots of what I said off set was what Riley said in the show. I&#39;m the oldest of three boys, all three of us played hockey, my dad played in the NHL, coaches NHL, my uncle played in the NHL. I was born around hockey guys, so lots of my vernacular came from my home life. Which, the opposite of Michelle, I&#39;ve now had to adjust, so people don&#39;t think I&#39;m a weird guy who lives in character, a full-time method actor. [Chuckles] So, yeah, most of those words were mine to begin with, and now, I&#39;m opening up my thesaurus and finding new ways to say &#34;boys, boys, boys&#34;. [Laughs]
K. Trevor Wilson: I don&#39;t think I can say &#34;allegedly&#34; or &#34;appreciates&#34; for the rest of my life without people perking up and getting excited and adding an s to it. The &#34;to be fair&#34; will haunt me for the rest of my life, also. It&#39;s strange to not have to talk like that anymore, it got to the point that I&#39;d have to, while getting ready for a show, watch the old seasons to be like, &#34;Okay, there&#39;s Dan&#39;s voice.&#34; And then it always took me a couple of weeks afterwards to stop.
Every once in a while, I&#39;ll say something and my wife will say, &#34;Oh, there&#39;s Dan again. Oh, hello Squirrelly Dan. We&#39;ve missed you.&#34; [Laughs] So, anytime an s slips in where it isn&#39;t supposed to be, it&#39;ll make me think of Letterkenny. For the rest of my life, I&#39;m probably going to be doing cameos where people asked me to tell them what I appreciates about them, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever fully go away.






 Letterkenny Character&#39;s Iconic Catchphrases Explained 
         

Throughout its 12-season run on Crave and Hulu, Letterkenny has delivered a wide variety of memorable quotes and catchphrases for audiences to quote in their day-to-day lives. Jared Keeso&#39;s Wayne, in particular, was one of the biggest sources for said phrases during the show&#39;s run, whether it be his greeting every single person with &#34;How&#39;r ya now&#34; and &#34;Not s&#39;bad&#34;, while also quickly shutting down foes with the likes of &#34;You&#39;re spare parts, aren&#39;t ya bud?&#34; and &#34;You&#39;re f----ng ten-ply&#34;, or warning them with &#34;I suggest you let that one marinate&#34; and &#34;Figger it out&#34;. This would even extend to his friends, frequently lamenting to Nathan Dale&#39;s Daryl &#34;Wish you weren&#39;t so f----ng awkward, bud&#34; and to most of them to &#34;Take about 15% off there&#34;.




K. Trevor Wilson&#39;s Squirrelly Dan was also a consistent source of hilarious catchphrases during Letterkenny, subtly hitting on Michelle Mylett&#39;s Katy by saying &#34;That&#39;s what I appreciates about you&#34; when she does something for the group. He also became known for the running gag regarding The Boots and Ginger and their relationship with an ostrich, noting everything said about the duo is &#34;allegedly&#34; true. He was also one who was quick to shut down threats or complaints by shouting &#34;Well, tough f----ng sledding!&#34; in a nearly unintelligible voice.

One of the more notable quotes to extend to the entire Letterkenny cast was the phrase &#34;to be fair&#34;, with Wayne, Katy, Daryl and Dan all having a full conversation about its overusage by certain people, while also turning it into brief musical moments. Others spoken by more than just the Hicks were &#34;Texas-sized 10-4&#34; to indicate a strong confirmation of something, &#34;Pitter Patter&#34; to call for the characters to get to work, and &#34;when a friend asks for help, you help them,&#34; pushing many characters outside of their comfort zones in order to help even those they hesitate to fully call a friend when they&#39;re in need.






All seasons of Letterkenny are available to stream on Hulu.
