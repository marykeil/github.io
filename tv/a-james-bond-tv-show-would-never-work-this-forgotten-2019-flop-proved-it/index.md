# A James Bond TV Show Would Never Work (&amp; This Forgotten 2019 Flop Proved It)


## SUMMARY 



  A James Bond TV show would be a bad idea, as Jason Bourne&#39;s TV series, Treadstone, failed to impress and was canceled after one season.   Bond&#39;s extravagant adventures, long runtimes, and star-studded casts make him unsuited for television, unlike the grittier Jason Bourne franchise.   A Bond TV show would face challenges in finding a lead actor and maintaining the franchise&#39;s reputation, risking ruining the character&#39;s mysterious edge.

## Literature Review
While the James Bond franchise&#39;s producers avoiding TV spinoffs may seem disappointing, one small-screen flop proves 007 belongs only in cinemas.




While a James Bond TV show might sound like a profitable endeavor, one forgotten flop proves that this would be a bad idea. The James Bond franchise’s producers are famously averse to radical change. In recent years, executive producer Barbara Broccoli confirmed that there would not be a female James Bond (via THR), while producer Michael G. Wilson told TheWrap in 2021 that a Bond TV show was also off the cards. Broccoli reaffirmed this in an October 2023 interview, saying that a scripted TV show in the James Bond universe wasn’t a high priority for the franchise’s creators.




While this might sound like a missed opportunity, the producers may be right to ignore the clarion call of the small screen as they focus on making the upcoming Bond 26 finally happen. As surprising as it might seem, a James Bond TV show is unlikely to succeed for numerous reasons. Not only that, but a comparable TV series was already released to lukewarm reception, effectively proving this point. Back in 2019, another major spy franchise attempted to branch out into television and failed. This misfire proves just how tough it would be for the James Bond franchise to translate its timeless appeal to television.


 Treadstone Proved Big Spy Franchises Don&#39;t Belong On TV 
          

The 2019 series Treadstone attempted to bring the Jason Bourne franchise to TV, but the show failed and was canceled after only one season. In the process, Treadstone showed that spy stories don’t work on television since their fast-paced car chases, exotic locations, and brushing fight scenes all benefit from the big screen. If the grounded shaky-cam world of Jason Bourne fell flat on the small screen, then the comparatively outlandish and over-the-top James Bond franchise would be guaranteed to fail. Although Bond has his darker moments, Bourne is the more serious character and his multi-movie arc theoretically seems better suited to a television adaptation than Bond’s standalone adventures.




                  Why Jason Bourne TV Show Treadstone Season 2 Was Canceled   There&#39;ll be no Treadstone season 2, as USA&#39;s Jason Bourne spinoff series has been cancelled after just one season. Here are the reasons why.    

Treadstone struggled for numerous reasons, chief among them the fact that Bourne himself wasn’t heavily involved. Since the Bond franchise has a bigger reputation to protect than the more recent Bourne movies, there is no way a TV show could include the lead actor himself. As a result, any Bond TV show would be more likely to center on supporting stars like Miss Moneypenny, M, or Q, and this could get old fast. Alternatively, if a Bond TV spinoff focused on a young Bond, it would risk ruining his mysterious edge. One of Treadstone’s worst decisions was altering Bourne’s backstory, and giving 007 a lackluster new origin could be even worse.



Treadstone holds a &#34;Rotten&#34; 47% score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.









 Treadstone Couldn’t Bring Bourne To TV (And Bond Would Be Even Trickier) 
          

Bond isn’t suited to television due to the lavish, big-budget nature of his adventures, the lengthy runtimes of his movies, and the films&#39; star-studded casts. Bourne didn’t have these issues to contend with since the series is less glamorous and grittier, but Treadstone still failed to impress critics upon release. Considering what a disaster Bourne’s TV debut was, it&#39;s difficult to believe that Bond’s journey to the small screen would be any more successful, and plenty of justifications for expecting 007’s show to be even worse. As a result, James Bond should steer clear of TV after seeing a fellow super-spy’s franchise crash and burn on the medium.
