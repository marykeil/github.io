## SUMMARY

Kalani received a DM from a follower criticizing her boyfriend&#39;s looks and making racist remarks about Samoans.   Kalani&#39;s response to the follower&#39;s DM shows that she chooses not to fully share her boyfriend on social media due to the negative and psychotic behavior of some people.

## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Kalani Faagata doesn&#39;t post her boyfriend Dallas Nuez&#39;s face on social media. She&#39;s revealing the real reason that&#39;s stopping her.




90 Day: The Last Resort star Kalani Faagata is finally revealing why she doesn&#39;t post photos that show her boyfriend Dallas Nuez&#39;s face. Kalani, 36, was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé season 6 with Asuelu Pulaa, 28. He was 23 when they met at a resort in Samoa. Kalani brought him to America after she became pregnant with their first baby. They never seemed compatible enough to get married, and their issues often made them consider divorce. What Kalani had not told the cameras was that Asuelu had been continuously cheating on Kalani even after coming to the U.S. It was because of him that Kalani met Dallas.




Kalani first spoke about Dallas on 90 Day: The Last Resort but Kalani never really shared his face on social media, choosing to crop it out or cover it with emojis. She recently shared a photo of Dallas on her Instagram and later posted a DM she received from a follower about the picture of her boyfriend. &#34;Hey chee, white head in his nose, lint on his beard,” the fan told Kalani. The photo in question barely showed any of Dallas&#39;s face, as Kalani had posted a drooling emoji over it. It made the fan ask her, &#34;Why so secretive over him?” In the end, the fan made a racist remark about Dallas suggesting that Dallas looked like Asuelu and added, &#34;Lazy like all those Samoans.”

In her screenshot, Kalani also shared her own response to the 90 Day Fiancé viewer. She wrote, &#34;You can’t be hideous and racist.&#34; Kalani continued, &#34;Pick a struggle, embarrassing a*s b***h. And, FYI, he’s part your people.” Moreover, Kalani used the DM as an example to reveal why she didn&#39;t expose Dallas&#39;s face on social media. “Quite literally why I don’t fully share him,” Kalani confessed. “Because some people are psychotic,&#34; she added in conclusion. Kalani met Dallas when Asuelu gave her a &#34;hall pass.&#34; Asuelu cheated on Kalani when he was in Samoa to meet his father. He received oral sex from someone and got a yeast infection on his tongue. He told Kalani she could kiss someone else. Kalani ended up doing a lot more.


 




Kalani started dating Dallas a year ago, in November 2022. She had to keep his identity under wraps because she was supposed to talk about him on 90 Day: The Last Resort. While Dallas visited the resort where Kalani was staying, he wasn&#39;t shown on camera. Kalani started to post about Dallas on Instagram, but they were photos of his tattooed arms. Then came his photos with his face missing. Kalani could be under contract to not show her boyfriend&#39;s face on social media until he makes his 90 Day Fiancé debut. However, Dallas himself has claimed that he&#39;s not too interested in starring in the reality TV show.

There were suspicions that Kalani would star in 90 Day: The Single Life with Dallas. The cast has been announced for the January show but Kalani doesn&#39;t feature in it. Perhaps Kalani will star in the upcoming 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 8 in March 2024 with Dallas. There&#39;s still some time for the cast to be announced, and it remains to be seen if Dallas will finally become a reality TV celeb. However, until then, fans might have to keep letting 90 Day: The Last Resort star Kalani tease them with these faceless pictures of Dallas unless she stops posting about him altogether because of the negative comments she&#39;s getting about his appearance.
