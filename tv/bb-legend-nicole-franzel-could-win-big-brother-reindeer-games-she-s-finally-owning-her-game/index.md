Throughout her time on Big Brother, Nicole has always been classified as a “rat”, or a player who rats other people out when it’s convenient. Nicole’s game has nearly always revolved around sharing information, but in the past, she’s never admitted to using this strategy in her favor. Instead, she’s gotten emotional when people accuse of her backstabbing others for her own gain. During Big Brother 22, especially after Daniele Donato sparked pre-game controversy, Nicole was one of the most disliked players in the house because of the way she shared information and refused to own up to her “rat” strategy.

After years away, Nicole’s strategy has evolved in her favor for Big Brother Reindeer Games. While she’s still playing a game of telephone, Nicole came into BB Reindeer Games with people who she had conflict with outside the house. Dealing with personal beef between both Britney Haynes and Cody Calafiore, Nicole knew the only way to actually get people to strategize with her was to be cut-throat, but honest. She was able to play up her loyalty to Cody and Frankie Grande, who were both on BB 16 with her, while aligning with the other women in the game. Nicole’s priorities seem to be the women, which is benefitting her.
