## Literature Review
The Traitors US season 2&#39;s Sandra Diaz-Twine and Parvati Shallow, both of whom dominated Survivor, are ready to dominate the murder mystery game.




The Traitors US season 2 features two Survivor winners--Sandra Diaz-Twine and Parvati Shallow--who are legends of the game, and they&#39;re ready to destroy their fellow Traitors competitors. Sandra and Parvati will be competing against 19 other celebrities, and will either be traitors or faithfuls in the game. They&#39;ve played multiple seasons of Survivor, and Sandra even has the distinction of being the first-ever two-time winner. On The Traitors US season 2, they&#39;ll go head-to-head with contestants from shows such as Big Brother, The Challenge, The Bachelor, Dancing With The Stars, and The Real Housewives franchise, among others.




In a new preview for The Traitors US season 2, shared by Peacock on YouTube, Sandra and Parvati shared their game plans for the show.


 

As exciting scenes from The Traitors US season 2 were revealed, including quotes from beloved host Alan Cumming, Sandra and Parvati described their strategies for the game. Sandra declared, &#34;You would think I&#39;m your best friend when, in fact, I&#39;m here to destroy you.&#34; Parvati stated, &#34;I&#39;m a poisonous spider crawling up to catch you when you least expect it.&#34; Parvati&#39;s quote referenced the Black Widow Brigade alliance, which she founded on Survivor: Micronesia.

 Janelle Pierzina Is A &#34;Dangerous&#34; Traitors US Player 
          

Big Brother icon Janelle Pierzina, who played the game four times, is also a Traitors US season 2 contestant. In the Traitors US preview, Janelle said, &#34;People keep spreading this gossip that I&#39;m selfish. Let&#39;s just be real. I&#39;m dangerous.&#34; Throughout her time on Big Brother, Janelle was always known as a player who went after what she wanted no matter what, so it seems that this will be her style of play during The Traitors US as well.

Parvati competed in four Survivor seasons: Survivor: Cook Islands, Survivor Micronesia (winner), Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains (runner-up), and Survivor: Winners at War. Sandra appeared in four seasons: Survivor: Pearl Islands (winner), Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains (winner), Survivor: Game Changers, and Survivor: Winners at War. She was also a non-competing mentor on Survivor: Island of the Idols. She also competed on Australian Survivor: Blood V Water with her daughter, Nina. The Traitors US season 2 cast has an interesting mix of reality competition show beasts, including Sandra; Parvati; Janelle; Dan Gheesling (Big Brother); and Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio, Trishella Canatella, and Chris &#34;CT&#34; Tamburello (The Challenge).




It&#39;ll be intriguing to see how contestants such as Peter Weber from The Bachelor, Maks Chmerkovskiy from Dancing With The Stars, and stars from The Real Housewives franchise, including Larsa Pippen, Phaedra Parks, ShereÃ© Whitfield, and Tamra Judge, fare against these cutthroat players. Although they&#39;ve faced competition in some ways on those shows, reality competition shows are completely different. Sandra, Parvati, and Janelle are used to doing what it takes to win, even if it means &#34;murdering&#34; their fellow players in the middle of the night during The Traitors US season 2.

The Traitors US season 2 premieres Friday, January 12 on Peacock.
