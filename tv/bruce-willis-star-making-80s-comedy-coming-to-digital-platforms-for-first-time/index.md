 Moonlighting’s Impact on Bruce Willis’ Career 
          

Moonlighting’s new release represents the first time that all five seasons of the show will be available on a digital platform. Despite being one of the most beloved shows of the 1980s, Moonlighting had not been previously available for digital streaming. The episodes could be purchased via DVD, but the full seasons were relegated to this physical media version. Now, the content will become much more universally accessible as Moonlighting becomes available widely later this month.




Moonlighting holds a particular nostalgia as the ‘80s series was a major launching point in Willis’ career. Prior to Moonlighting, Willis had only had a few small TV roles and played a minuscule role in 1982’s The Verdict. After Moonlighting, the actor became much more of a household name, earning an Emmy nomination and going on to land his 1988 role in Die Hard.

Now, Willis is ubiquitously known for his action stardom, as well as a few notable dramatic roles in films like The Sixth Sense. In March 2022, Willis was diagnosed with aphasia (and later frontotemporal dementia), and retired from acting. Making Moonlighting widely available will now give viewers a chance to look back at Willis&#39; prolific career in the absence of new films from Willis.
