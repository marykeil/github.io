## Literature Review
Since Natalie Mordovtseva’s relationship with Josh is going downhill on 90 Day: The Single Life, she proposes a ridiculous idea to Mike Youngquist.




In a new preview of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, Natalie Mordovtseva asks Mike Youngquist if he would consider having a baby with her. Natalie and Mike were first featured in 90 Day Fiancé season 7 to showcase their incompatible relationship. Even though the couple realized that they weren&#39;t made for each other, Natalie moved to the United States to marry Mike. The controversial couple got married in 2020, but Natalie left Mike six months later. The Ukrainian native couldn&#39;t adjust to living in the woods and kept arguing with Mike due to his busy work schedule and drinking habits.




Natalie is now featured in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 with her new love interest, Josh Weinstein. However, her storyline is about to take a dramatic turn in the next episode.


 

A preview posted by 90 Day Fiancé on YouTube shows Natalie&#39;s mom frustratingly asking her why she wants to be with a man like Josh, who doesn&#39;t want to build a family with her or isn&#39;t interested in having a baby. After listening to her mother&#39;s concerns, Natalie says she wants a baby from someone she loves. In the next scene, she meets Mike and asks him if he wants to have a child with her.

 90 Day: The Single Life Teases Veronica &amp; Tim Feud 
          

Meanwhile, Veronica Rodriguez is dating Jamal Menzies on 90 Day: The Single Life. She wants her ex-boyfriend-turned-best friend, Tim Malcolm, to get along with her new man. However, Tim isn’t happy with Veronica’s relationship and thinks Jamal is taking advantage of her. In another part of the preview, Tim and Jamal meet at a restaurant to sort things out. However, things go south, and they get into a major argument again. Tim tells Veronica, “Jamal came in hot, not me,” adding that the young man is dating Veronica for the wrong reasons. This accusation makes Jamal angry, and he walks out while saying, “This s*** is p***ing me the f*** off.”

The preview clip shows that 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 is full of unending drama. Natalie’s journey stands out the most, as it’s one of the longest-running storylines with the most twists and turns. When Natalie came to the United States, she loved Mike and wanted to build a family with him. However, she changed her mindset and moved on to explore new options soon after. The Ukrainian 90 Day Fiancé star pursued different men, claiming she wanted to have a baby with them. However, none fulfilled her wish, so she’s back to square one, asking Mike to get her pregnant.




Veronica’s storyline has also been wild. When the North Carolina native debuted on 90 Day Fiancé, she was a supporting cast member, aiding Tim in his relationship. However, things changed when she became popular and decided to televise her journey on reality TV. Veronica has tried to be with different men over the last few years, but not many expected her to pursue a relationship with Kim Menzies’ son. Tim was visibly furious when Veronica revealed she was dating a much younger man. It was a bit hypocritical of him to have such a reaction when the 90 Day: The Single Life star supported him in his relationship with Jeniffer Tarazona.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
