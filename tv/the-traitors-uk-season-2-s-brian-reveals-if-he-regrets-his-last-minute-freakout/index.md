## Literature Review
Brian Davidson opens up about whether he should have handled the round table differently, which was his downfall on The Traitors UK season 2.




Brian Davidson was recently banished from The Traitors UK season 2, and he&#39;s now sharing his thoughts about the moment he started &#34;crumbling&#34; on TV right before leaving the show. The Traitors has been a hit reality show in both the United Kingdom and United States. During The Traitors UK season 2, Brian was accused of being a traitor. He was at his wits&#39; end during the round table, pleading with his fellow contestants that he&#39;s a faithful. In the end, though, he wasn&#39;t convincing enough and he was banished from the competition.




When the faithfuls are on the chopping block, they try to do whatever they can to stick around. For Brian, he ended up &#34;crumbling,&#34; which he has some regrets about, as noted in an interview with Metro. While he pleaded his case during the round table, he &#34;just felt so emotional, and I was going through my head because I was flip-flopping.&#34; He thought he had made a convincing enough argument, but it wasn&#39;t enough. Looking back, he would have handled the situation differently. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t jumped in at the end, I don&#39;t think I would have got that many votes,&#34; Brian admitted, adding that he should have &#34;shut his mouth.&#34;


 Brian Didn&#39;t Tell Traitors UK Cast About ADHD Diagnosis 
          

Every contestant comes into the game with their own lived experiences, which can affect how they perceive others and how they react to certain circumstances. Brian had recently been diagnosed with ADHD before filming the reality show, which he chose to keep a secret. It was such a secret that he didn&#39;t reveal this information to his fellow Traitors UK season 2 contestants &#34;because it was a new thing and I don&#39;t think anyone should label themselves with anything.&#34; When Brian started &#34;freaking out&#34; right before his banishment, he started questioning himself, saying, &#34;Should I even be on this medication? Is that what is making me panic and freak out there?&#34;





 

In hindsight, though, Brian doesn&#39;t think his medication affected the situation because he realized he&#39;s acted that way when not on medication. Having that privilege of hindsight can&#39;t change the game itself, but Brian did wonder if he should have told his fellow contestants about what he was going through. In fact, when speaking to Metro, he acknowledged that opening up to them might have gotten him further into the game. He might have some regrets about his behavior at the round table, but he&#39;s not beating himself up over the &#34;should&#39;ve, would&#39;ve, could&#39;ve&#34; of it all.

It&#39;s unfortunate that Brian started &#34;crumbling,&#34; as he put it, which put more of a target on his back. At the end of the day, though, no one can blame any of the faithfuls for trying as hard as they can to convince everyone they&#39;re not a traitor. A lot of money is on the line, and they all want to be there at the very end to collect the grand prize.

The Traitors UK is a drama-filled reality show with many twists and turns, and the stress that these contestants undergo each step of the way sometimes leads to unfortunate situations. Looking ahead, though, there&#39;s still over a dozen people left in the competition. Only time will tell which ones will rise to the occasion and manage to &#34;murder&#34; and/or banish the rest to become the winner(s).



The Traitors UK season 2 airs Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 9 p.m. UK time on BBC One.
