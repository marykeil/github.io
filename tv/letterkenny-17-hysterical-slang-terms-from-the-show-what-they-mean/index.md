 10 Letterkenny Questions That Need To Be Answered In The Final Season 
Letterkenny has delivered plenty over its 11 seasons, but there are a few burning questions that need to be resolved before the series wraps.












 








 17  Let That One Marinate 
Wayne Telling People To Calm Down


 







Even if some of the characters and lifestyles of Letterkenny can seem laidback, tempers often run high. With passionate opinions apt to turn into fights at any moment, wise words are needed to warn everyone to take a step back and think about how to proceed. When Wayne gets particularly annoyed, he&#39;ll state his opinion clearly and tell everyone &#34;I suggest you let them one marinate.&#34; Much like meat marinating in a sauce, he advises everyone to soak up what he&#39;s saying and not respond too hastily lest they meet his wrath.





 16  10-Ply 
Wayne Comparing How Tough He Is
        

There are some vicious insults thrown around on Letterkenny and most of them come from Wayne. With his tough guy attitude, it is no surprise that most of these insults seem to imply that other men in town are not so tough, leading to the shady use of &#34;10-ply.&#34; When speaking of toilet paper, 2-ply is seen as soft toilet paper. For Wayne to call someone 10-ply, it is clear just how &#34;soft&#34; he thinks they are and how little respect he has for them. It is a hilarious insult that goes back to the show&#39;s beginnings on YouTube.





 15  5&#39;11 
Wayne Calling Someone Average
        

Wayne&#39;s talent for insulting others can take something that seems so inoffensive and turn it into some of the most biting criticism imaginable. When going after Reilly and Jonesy, he often calls them average, which eventually makes its way to telling them, &#34;You&#39;re so 5&#39;11, bud.&#34; This is the average height of a man, which by definition, would seem inoffensive, but Wayne uses it to show the dimwitted hockey players that there is nothing remarkable about them and nothing that stands out as special.





 14  Chorin&#39; 
Getting Work Done On The Farm
        

Each group of Letterkenny residents, from the hockey players to the &#34;hicks,&#34; has their own slang that only relates to them. For the hicks like Squirrelly Dan, their life is mostly made up of &#34;Chorin&#39;,&#34; which is to say doing chores around the farm. Clearly, there are always endless things to get done around the farm. As a result, it&#39;s one of the most common slang words that viewers will hear on Letterkenny, so it&#39;s a firm fan favorite.





 13  Pitter Patter 
Get To Work
        

Articulated frequently throughout the series by Wayne and his farming friends, the slogan is short for &#34;Pitter-patter, let&#39;s get at &#39;er.&#34; It&#39;s a way of telling someone to get off their butt and get to whatever it is they should be doing, and the slogan makes for one of the best running gags on Letterkenny. The phrase perfectly encapsulates Wayne&#39;s character. The star of the show and never one to sit around procrastinating, Wayne is a man of action. Whether it&#39;s chorin&#39;, fixing, or fighting, when something needs to be done in the town of Letterkenny, residents can always count on Wayne to get the job done.





 12  Let The Paint Dry 
Wayne Warning People Not To Date Too Young


 







This expression comes from the fifth episode of season 3, titled &#34;The Battle for Bonnie McMurray,&#34; in which several characters vie for the affection of the young and beautiful local bar server and cashier Bonnie McMurray. While Bonnie may be of age, she&#39;s still significantly younger than the characters trying to win her heart, prompting Wayne to suggest that they wait a tad longer before pursuing her. His words fall on deaf ears, though, as his friends try in vain to woo Bonnie, who seems to only have eyes for the uninterested Wayne.





 11  Ferda 
Playing Hockey As A Team Player
        

A recurring slogan of Reilly and Jonesy, two hockey-playing best friends rarely ever seen apart, &#34;ferda&#34; is an abbreviated form of &#34;for the boys.&#34; It is one of many Letterkenny hockey slang terms that contribute to Letterkenny being one of the most hilarious Canadian comedy series. The expression doesn&#39;t have much to do with the male gender, as the &#34;boys&#34; in the slogan refers to the hockey team that Reilly and Jonesy play for. Playing ferda means conducting one&#39;s actions in a way that benefits their team or group above themselves.





 10  Boat 
A Championship


 







In both Letterkenny and the Shoresy spinoff series, there is a lot of pride in the local hockey team and the hope that they will bring home the championship. It is an obsession shared by Jonesy and Reilly when they are players as well as when they are coaches. This constant talk of bringing the trophy to Letterkenny results in a lot of talk about &#34;the boat.&#34; This is slang for a championship, as it can be shortened to the final syllable &#34;ship&#34; and it is not a big leap to then take it from &#34;ship&#34; to &#34;boat,&#34; proving that these hockey players have a bit of creativity as well.

Letterkenny spinoff Shoresy features a colorful cast of characters that some audiences may recognize, and others will be brand-new faces to viewers.








 9  The Native Flu 
Faking An Illness To Get Out Of Something Scary
        

The concept of the Native Flu is introduced in the season 2 Letterkenny episode of the same title when the hockey team travels to the Rez (Native Canadian Reservation) to play against the local team. A notoriously violent and tough team to play against, the Natives are known to play a physically aggressive and punishing style of hockey, so it&#39;s not uncommon for players on opposing teams to fake illnesses to avoid playing against the Natives. Therefore, the &#34;Native Flu&#34; refers to someone faking sick to get out of an unpleasant experience.





 8  Donkey Juice 
A Favored Alcoholic Beverage Name
        

The drink of choice for most Letterkenny characters is a Puppers (beer) or Gus N&#39; Bru (whiskey), but when someone wants to get as drunk as possible as quickly as possible, there&#39;s no substitute for Donkey Juice - a vile concoction made from whatever alcohols are available.
The cocktail has different names depending on the locale - hairy buffalo, trashcan punch, Purple Jesus, jungle juice. No matter what someone calls it, drinking it is a quick way to get sick, especially when mixed with darts (cigarettes), electric lettuce (marijuana), booger sugar (cocaine), disco biscuits (MDMA), zoomers (mushrooms), or beans (methamphetamines). While the number of terms can be difficult to track if viewers do not pay attention, they make the dialogue even funnier and help to put Letterkenny among other great comedy shows to binge on Hulu.





 7  Spit 
Vomiting From Excessive Drinking
        

When Donkey Juice makes an appearance at the Christmas Party in Letterkenny, fans get introduced to a new term. Letterkenny likes to keep its holiday party classy and insists on no &#34;spitting&#34; until midnight. Spitting refers to vomiting from excessive drinking, and despite the rule about keeping it classy, many partygoers find themselves doing just that. With Daryl warning that Donkey Juice makes him spit and Reilly casually telling Jonesy he was thinking of going to have a spit, it makes the act of vomiting seem much more acceptable.





 6  Flatulence (Various) 
How To Describe The Bodily Function
        

Drinking too much Donkey Juice won&#39;t just make someone spit, it&#39;s also a good way to get some bad gas the following day, which the Letterkenny residents have several colorful ways of referring to. Air biscuits, ass flappers, colon bowling, rectal turbulence, steaming one&#39;s Calvins (jeans); whatever someone calls their flatulence, they should just be careful they don&#39;t accidentally mistake it for a King Cobra Coil (feces) or the scoots (diarrhea), which are great ways to scare off any women that might potentially be interested.





 5  Attractive People (Various) 
Different Names To Refer To Beautiful People
        

A &#34;rocket&#34; is a term that usually refers to an attractive woman on the show, but it can be used to describe a beautiful person of any gender. Rockets are also referred to as &#34;slams,&#34; &#34;snipers,&#34; or &#34;snipes,&#34; and when someone matches up with a snipe on a dating app like Tinder, they&#39;re a &#34;swipey snipey.&#34; Athletes in Letterkenny are known to be distracted from games by snipes in the crowd. A slam that&#39;s attracted to lacrosse players is a &#34;lacrosstitute,&#34; while a rocket that&#39;s partial to hockey players is a &#34;puck bunny,&#34; which can cause team infighting, as demonstrated in the second episode of season 3.





 4  Good Hockey Players (Various) 
Different Names To Refer To Hockey Stars


 







Hockey is an important part of life in Canada, and the town of Letterkenny is no exception. Their local senior team, the Letterkenny Irish, is frequently discussed, and the more successful women&#39;s team, The Shamrockettes, is a major focus in seasons 5 and 6. A talented and well-liked hockey player is a &#34;certified beautician,&#34; and one with silky smooth hair is a &#34;Pantene pro.&#34; To become a beaut, a player&#39;s got to be able to consistently light the lamp (score goals), and that means having the dirty dangles (stick-handling skills) to wheel, snipe, and celly (skate, shoot, and celebrate).





 3  Bad Hockey Players (Various) 
Different Names To Refer To Bad Hockey Players
        

No one&#39;s born a great player, they&#39;ve got to &#34;praccy like a donkey&#34; (practice hard) to get there. There are few greater dishonors in Letterkenny than being bad at hockey, so there&#39;s no shortage of terms to serve as reminders. Rookies are &#34;schmelts,&#34; and slow skaters are &#34;plugs.&#34; They are &#34;pylons&#34; because they get skated around or &#34;pheasants&#34; because they&#39;re easy targets. If someone doesn&#39;t get playing time, they&#39;re a &#34;duster&#34; or a &#34;grocery stick&#34; because they just separate forwards from defenders on the bench. Regardless of skill level, they&#39;d better be ready to fight, so they can&#39;t be 10-ply.





 2  Fights (Various) 
The Various Slang Terms For Fights On Letterkenny
        

In Letterkenny, fighting isn&#39;t just done in hockey; it&#39;s an important part of life. An episode without a fight is rare, as the pilot focuses on Wayne&#39;s attempts to give up fighting, only to see him fight several times in the following episode to be crowned the toughest guy in Letterkenny. Reilly and Jonesy like to pop their tarps (shirts) off for tilly time (a fight), but whether people call it a donnybrook, a scrap, or a dust-up, if they are in Letterkenny, they always need to be ready to drop the mitts (have a fight).





 1  Shirt Tucker 
The Most Insulting Slang Terms
        

Most of the most vicious insults in Letterkenny comes from the &#34;hicks&#34; ridiculing other groups, including and perhaps most directly the &#34;skids&#34; or &#34;degens.&#34; But those insults can go both ways as Stuart and his friends have some choice words for Wayne. They describe the hicks as &#34;shirt tuckers&#34; referring to the way Wayne tucks his shirt into his pants. It also suggests contempt for someone who feels the need to conform to polite or expected society.
