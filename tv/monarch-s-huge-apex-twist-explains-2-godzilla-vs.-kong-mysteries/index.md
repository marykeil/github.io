Summary

  Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 10 reveals that APEX had a base on Skull Island, explaining their extensive knowledge of the Hollow Earth.   The season finale also shows that both APEX and Monarch have outposts on Skull Island, debunking the assumption that only Monarch had a base there.

The shocking Skull Island twist in the Monarch Legacy of Monsters season 1 finale cleared up two Monsterverse mysteries left unsolved by Godzilla vs. Kong. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 7 created an unexpected bridge between the show and the 2021 crossover when it brought APEX into the picture. With the season finale, the show significantly expanded the role of Mechagodzilla&#39;s creators in the narrative with a surprising development.

The season 1 finale&#39;s ending shook things up for the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters characters by revealing that not only did two years pass while Cate, Shaw, and May were in the Hollow Earth, but Kentaro, Tim, and Hiroshi Randa had aligned with an enemy to save them. Despite APEX&#39;s pursuit of May, the three sought the company&#39;s help in retrieving their friends from the Hollow Earth world. As if the discovery that APEX had become an ally wasn&#39;t enough, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters added another surprise by confirming that the characters were on Skull Island.





 Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Reveals Why APEX Knew So Much About The Hollow Earth 
          

The revelation that APEX had a base on Skull Island in 2017 is a huge addition to the Monsterverse lore, albeit not a retcon. In fact, it makes sense when considering some key details in Godzilla vs. Kong. At the beginning of the movie, APEX founder and CEO Walter Simmons expressed a thorough understanding of what the Hollow Earth is. He even had a good idea of what people would find down there, discussing the &#34;lifeforce&#34; of the Hollow Earth and an &#34;ecosystem vast as any ocean.&#34; Simmons&#39; impressive knowledge raised questions about how he could know so much about the Hollow Earth, especially since humans allegedly hadn&#39;t been down there.

What happened in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters provides the Monsterverse with a working explanation for Simmons and APEX knowing so much about the Hollow Earth in Godzilla vs. Kong. It&#39;s reasonable to jump to the conclusion that getting Cate, Keiko, Shaw, and May out of the Hollow Earth led to APEX gathering all sorts of valuable intel on what lies below. Keiko was down there much longer than anyone else and could have additional information to share on the Hollow Earth world that the other three aren&#39;t privy to in Monarch&#39;s show.






 APEX&#39;s Skull Island Base Explains A Weird Godzilla Vs. Kong Detail 
          

Another confusing aspect of APEX&#39;s role in Godzilla vs. Kong pertains to the scene where the &#34;Team Godzilla&#34; characters encounter Mechagodzilla. While in the APEX base, they stumble upon Skullcrawlers eggs, followed by a fight between Kong and a giant Skullcrawler. Curiously, Godzilla vs Kong offered no hints as to how APEX had obtained these Skullcrawler eggs. Their possession of them was noteworthy, particularly since Skullcrawlers are only known to live on Skull Island. Supposedly, that was a place where only Monarch had a base, but Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has proven this previous assumption wrong.

The closing scene in the finale has confirmed that both APEX and Monarch have built outposts on Skull Island. Because they had people stationed there as early as the late 2010s, APEX&#39;s access to resources exclusive to Skull Island in the timeframe of Godzilla vs. Kong is no longer a mystery. Missions to retrieve the eggs from the Hollow Earth tunnel where the Skullcrawlers periodically emerge could have been part of APEX&#39;s activities on the island.






 Monsterverse Has One More APEX Mystery Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Can Solve 
          

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; use of APEX has contributed a great deal in the way of filling the gaps in APEX&#39;s Monsterverse history. However, it hasn&#39;t exhausted its opportunities with the organization; the mysterious circumstances of Walter Simmons&#39; acquisition of Ghidorah&#39;s head give the show an additional question it can answer. The novelization featured a scene in which Simmons bought the Ghidorah head from a character implied to be Jonah from Godzilla: King of the Monsters. But why the eco-terrorist leader, someone interested in revitalizing the world, would make that arrangement with Simmons was unclear, not to mention the matter of how they&#39;d know each other.

It&#39;s worth keeping in mind that the novelization&#39;s place in Monsterverse canon is murky at best, so it&#39;s hard to say if this exchange actually happened. Even if it did, it&#39;s a development of such significance that it needs to be properly addressed. It&#39;s a bit jarring that possession of Ghidorah&#39;s missing head went from an eco-terrorist to someone of distinctly different motives without an onscreen explanation. If Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2 hints at a relationship between APEX and Jonah, or jumps forward to 2019 after Ghidorah&#39;s death, it can finally complete the Monsterverse&#39;s APEX puzzle.
