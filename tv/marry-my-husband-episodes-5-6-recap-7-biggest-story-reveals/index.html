  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From the 2005 flashbacks to the BTS song twist, Marry My Husband’s episodes 5 and 6 included some game-changing moments for the Prime Video K-drama.</p>
<p>Summary
The main characters in Marry My Husband, Ji-won and Ji-hyuk, have discovered each other&rsquo;s secrets.
Ji-hyuk has confessed his feelings for Ji-won and expressed his desire to be with her.
Ji-hyuk may have died and come back multiple times, and the show hints at him being obsessed with fixing things in his pursuit of Ji-won.</p>
<p>Marry My Husband’s episodes 5 and 6 featured major reveals, including but not limited to Ji-hyuk confessing his love for Ji-won, as well as the two main characters learning about each other’s biggest secret thanks to a couple of BTS songs. Every Marry My Husband episode ends on a cliffhanger, but the two most recent chapters might have been the show’s most important yet. Similar to other K-dramas based on a webtoon, the series has made some changes to the source material, especially regarding Ji-hyuk.
The anticipation for Marry My Husband episode 7 could not be higher following the end of episode 6. The idea of exposing the main characters’ secrets through the use of “Dynamite” and “Spring Day” by BTS was great, and it completely changed the status quo of the show. Marry My Husband’s latest episodes brought Ji-won and Ji-hyuk closer, but it also made their potential relationship more complicated.</p>
<p>7  Ji-won &amp; Ji-hyuk Have Found About Each Other’s Secret Because Of BTS
Marry My Husband episode 6</p>
<p>Marry My Husband episode 6’s final scene is a game-changing moment for the show, as Ji-won and Ji-hyuk learn each other’s secret thanks to two BTS songs. When discussing music they like, especially songs from BTS, Ji-won mentioned “Dynamite” as her favorite. Ji-hyuk, on the other hand, listed “Spring Day” as his favorite hit from the group. The problem, however, is that “Dynamite” and “Spring Day” were released in 2020 and 2017, respectively. Ji-won and Ji-hyuk, both of whom are living second lives, were having this conversation in 2013. Accidentally, they revealed themselves as “time travelers.”</p>
<p>The Best K-Dramas Of All Time, Ranked
K-Dramas have been enjoying a lot of success and fan adoration as of late, and these are the best K-dramas of all time.</p>
<p>Neither Ji-won nor Ji-hyuk could have possibly imagined that another person was living a second life so close to them. However, as soon as they made the mistake of mentioning songs that did not exist in 2013, it became obvious that the other person also had memories from the future. Ji-won did find it strange that Ji-hyuk knew so much about her life and was always ready to help her, which now makes a lot more sense to her given he has information from the future. What this major reveal will mean for their dynamic remains to be seen.</p>
<p>6  Ji-hyuk Confessed His Feelings To Ji-won
Marry My Husband episode 6</p>
<p>Although Ji-won and Ji-hyuk learning about each other’s ultimate secret was massive, there was another very important moment involving the two characters in this week’s Marry My Husband episodes. Not only did Ji-hyuk finally tell Ji-won that he likes her, but he specifically said that he wanted to be with her and will wait for her until she is no longer with Min-hwan. Until now, even though it was very obvious Ji-hyuk liked Ji-won, she refused to believe in it or even acknowledge it. Ji-won is not really with Min-hwan, but she would never enter a relationship that involved cheating.
Ji-won still needs to be with Min-hwan as part of her revenge plan, which is summarized by the “Marry My Husband” title, and thus cannot enter a new relationship. Additionally, Ji-won believed that Ji-hyuk was dating Yoo Hee-yeon, which is one of the reasons why she was always avoiding him. However, now that things have been properly explained, it will be interesting to see how Ji-won will react not only to Ji-hyuk being in love with her but also to the fact he is living a second life just like her.</p>
<p>5  Ji-won &amp; Ji-hyuk Have Known Each Other Since College
Marry My Husband episode 5</p>
<p>Most of Marry My Husband episode 5 was set in 2005, eight years before the main events of Prime Video&rsquo;s time travel K-drama in 2013. The flashback sequence revealed that Ji-won and Ji-hyuk have known each other since 2005, as they both attended the same college and used to walk the same street. It is unclear whether Ji-won remembers having met Ji-hyuk that night, as she was drunk and seemingly never saw him again. Regardless, Marry My Husband’s lead characters once spent an entire night walking around the city and talking about their lives.
Marry My Husband all but confirmed that Ji-hyuk has died and come back more than once, meaning that he might have had multiple “second lives” already.</p>
<p>Ji-won opened up about having lost her father three months ago and recently breaking up with her boyfriend, whereas Ji-hyuk talked about also having lost his father. Na In-woo’s character had a lot of good pieces of advice for Ji-won, which led her to joke about him knowing the future. Although Ji-hyuk’s reaction may have been a red herring, it suggested that he indeed had knowledge of the future and was already living a “second life” back in 2005. Ji-hyuk tried to reconnect with Ji-won in the following days but failed. He would then die in a car accident shortly after that night.</p>
<p>4  Ji-hyuk Has Died &amp; Come Back More Than Once
Marry My Husband episode 5</p>
<p>Marry My Husband all but confirmed that Ji-hyuk has died and come back more than once, meaning that he might have had multiple “second lives” already. This became clear once the character was run over by a car while trying to save a cat. Ji-hyuk died in 2005 but woke up in the past and got to start over. Additionally, Marry My Husband’s episodes 5 and 6 imply that Ji-hyuk has tried to get Ji-won to like him multiple times, and when he fails, he dies and then starts things from scratch again.</p>
<p>The 20 Best Time Travel K-Dramas, Ranked
Time travel is a common trope used in K-dramas to solve mysteries, add intrigue and propel love stories. Here are the best time travel K-dramas.</p>
<p>There have been a couple of shots of Ji-hyuk dramatically opening his eyes, which indicates he is “respawning” after dying in the future. An example of this is when he wakes up at the hospital at the beginning of episode 6. If Ji-hyuk is really having multiple new lives just so he can try to be with Ji-won over and over, then the character might come off as a stalker if not written well. That said, Marry My Husband could make Ji-hyuk into a character who got obsessed with the ability to go back and fix things.</p>
<p>3  Yoo Hee-yeon Is Ji-hyuk’s Sister
Marry My Husband episode 6</p>
<p>In one of the most hilarious Marry My Husband scenes so far, Ji-won learns that Yoo Hee-yeon is not Ji-hyuk’s girlfriend – she is his sister. It is curious how Ji-won had yet to realize that Hee-yeon, arguably her one true friend, was the sister of Ji-hyuk. Not only that, but Ji-won truly believed the two were a couple after seeing them entering a car together. Fortunately, Marry My Husband did not overplay this misunderstanding storyline and wrapped it up with a fun scene in which Ji-hyuk called his sister in front of Ji-win.</p>
<p>2  Su-min Once Copied Ji-won’s Handwriting
Marry My Husband episode 5</p>
<p>A small but important detail from episode 5 is that Su-min can copy Ji-won’s handwriting. This is how Su-min was able to forge a letter with Ji-won’s name in it and send it to Eun-ho all those years ago. The fact that Su-min was behind Ji-won and Eun-ho breaking up is nothing new. However, if Su-min could replicate Ji-won’s handwriting back in high school, nothing would stop her from doing it again, perhaps to steal one of her friends’ projects or get her in trouble at work.</p>
<p>1  Ji-won Has Learned How To Fight Back
Marry My Husband episode 6</p>
<p>Ji-won is now capable of fighting back, both literally and figuratively. After taking judo classes with Ji-hyuk’s friend, Ji-won is now applying the fundamentals of martial arts to her professional life. She metaphorically used a series of judo tactics, such as seemingly lowering her guard to her boss’ schemes, only for her to strike back. Ji-won is slowly gaining more control over her life and will not let others use her. The director of U&amp;K has been fired, and Ji-won’s project has her name in it by the end of Marry My Husband episode 6.
