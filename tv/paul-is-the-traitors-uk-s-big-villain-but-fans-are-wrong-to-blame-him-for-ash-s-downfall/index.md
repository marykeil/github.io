## Literature Review
Paul may have been the smartest traitor in the beginning, but turning on Ash on The Traitors UK was a big mistake.




The Traitors UK is well underway, and Paul turning on Ash has made him the most unpopular player. Paul, Ash, and Harry represented the three original traitors, joined by Miles in the first episodes. The Traitors UK is one of the best reality TV shows, so there&#39;s no wonder the chatter surrounding Paul&#39;s behavior is high. He started confident and strong, but cutting down Ash in favor of himself is not making him a popular player in The Traitors UK season 2. Paul may have a game show past, but he&#39;s not playing around.




Eliminating Brian instead of Ash was a mistake for the faithfuls, but Paul ultimately pays the price. While the traitors chose to gamble and send both Ash and Paul down to the dungeon, by saving Anthony, the traitors were put in a tough spot. However, even before Brian&#39;s elimination, Paul was too eager to send Ash home and save himself. Paul may be turning into the villain, but he&#39;s not the sole cause of Ash&#39;s downfall.


 Ash Played A Bad Game On The Traitors UK

             The Traitors (UK)   Release Date   November 29, 2022    Cast   Claudia Winkleman    Genres   Reality , Competition    Network   BBC       

While Paul began advocating for Ash&#39;s elimination when he realized he could go home in her place, she was doomed beforehand. Ash played a lousy game. She consistently appeared guilty and tried to play people in the house against each other. Ash was caught before Brian was eliminated, especially when he was revealed to be faithful. Unfortunately, she seemed to have known she was doomed because she stopped properly defending herself. Despite her lousy game, Paul still deserves some of the villain status.






 Paul Turning On Ash Was Bad For His Game On The Traitors UK 
          

Fans are turning on Paul after his performance in episode 4. On the Reddit thread posted by u/TheTraitors, no one had positive things to say about Paul. Some rightfully criticized his gameplay, saying, &#34;Paul plays badly. He’s spent two days saying &#39;I got a target on my back&#39; and he’ll turn up to breakfast tomorrow after killing Meg, who people will recognise has zero business being murdered.&#34;

However, his jig may be up regardless. Paul and Meg are the most likely to get killed at the round table. If Meg is sent home, it will be obvious Paul is a traitor. Another user noted, &#34;Paul was way too vocal about Ash, so if he was a Faithful then he’d be a threat. He’s also way too influential in the group. Any traitors would be stupid to kill Meg instead of him tonight, so when he comes home tomorrow it should be obvious he’s a Traitor.&#34;




Paul may have started as a popular player on The Traitors UK, but his negative attitude, poor gameplay, and treatment of Ash put a target on his back. Sending two traitors down to the dungeon is an unwise choice and shows his overconfidence in how the group feels about him. While it&#39;s possible Paul can save himself, his jig may be up after one too many mistakes. Ash&#39;s elimination isn&#39;t entirely his fault, but he played a part.



The Traitors UK airs on the BBC on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays at 9 p.m..
