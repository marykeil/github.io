## Literature Review
True Detective Season 4’s trailer already suggested that its level would be close to the first installment, and now early critics have confirmed that.




True Detective&#39;s fourth season&#39;s release is only days away and there are plenty of reasons to believe that this installment will finally match the level of the first. True Detective first aired almost 10 years ago, in January 2014. The first season rapidly became a massive hit and was soon considered one of the best mystery TV shows ever. The first installment&#39;s success, which relied on Nic Pizzolatto&#39;s incredible writing and Woody Harrelson and Mathew McConaughey’s amazing performances, spawned two more seasons. However, the show had some serious trouble trying to match the first installment&#39;s quality.






True Detective: Night Country will be available on January 14th at 9pmET, on MAX.




True Detective season 2 continued with the show&#39;s tradition of casting superstars like Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, and Vince Vaughn, but took a step backward by changing the universe and tone of the first. The third installment, on the other hand, left behind the casting tradition but brought back some elements that suggested connections with the universe from season 1, but it was not enough. Keeping this in mind, the excitement about True Detective season 4 is strictly related to the fact the trailer suggested a stronger connection with season one&#39;s tone and universe, among other things. Furthermore, early reviews sustained this and, thus, brought even more excitement.

 True Detective Season 4’s Reviews Are Great So Far 
         

True Detective: Night Country&#39;s early Rotten Tomatoes scores from the critics have been revealed and confirmed what was already hoped: True Detective season 4 is bringing back some of season 1&#39;s quality. Keeping in mind that the numbers will probably fluctuate as more reviews keep appearing, the season received a 100% score, which is a groundbreaking achievement, being the highest of all seasons. Season 1 used to be the highest, with a 91% score, while Seasons 2 and 3 had 47%, and 84% respectively.

Regarding that 100% score, the critics have specifically praised some interesting aspects of this upcoming season that further sustain the excitement. In the first place, Hoai-Tran-Bui, from Inverse, for example, called it &#34;the most thrilling and invigorating season of the show since its first,&#34; which is one of the many positive comparisons with season 1. Furthermore, regarding the tone, Caryn James from the BBC, praised how creepy the season was, which was a huge reason behind the first installment&#39;s positive response. In other words, early critics&#39; reviews indicate that True Detective: Night Country will be the best installment since season 1.






 True Detective Night Country Is What The Show Needed After 2 Divisive Seasons 
          

After two seasons that failed to match the first one’s quality, True Detective: Night Country is exactly what the show needs for two very important reasons. In the first place, a bad season would have been really hard to overcome and probably would have ended the series forever, considering it is one of HBO&#39;s most expensive shows. On the other hand, if this was the final installment, regardless of its performance, it would be a great way of honoring one of the best crime TV shows ever.
