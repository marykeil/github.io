## Literature Review

Tell Me Lies season 1 only revealed the first year of Lucy and Stephen&#39;s 8-year tumultuous relationship. Here&#39;s what we know about season 2.




Tell Me Lies was filled with sordid excitement and twisted drama, but the second season has been a long time coming despite being renewed by Hulu in 2022. Based on the novel by Carola Lovering, executive produced by Emma Roberts, and created by Meaghan Oppenheimer, Tell Me Lies follows the tumultuous relationship between Lucy (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen (Jackson White) over an 8-year period.




The first season of Tell Me Lies was met with mostly positive remarks from critics, though some panned it for its flimsy and soapy story, while others applauded it for the same reasons (via Rotten Tomatoes). Regardless of its mixed critical reception, the viewership numbers were strong enough to inspire Hulu to renew the series for a second season in late 2022, but a mix of factors has continued to delay its release. Despite all that, Tell Me Lies season 2 is on the way.

It didn&#39;t take long after the release of the first season for Hulu to opt to renew the fledgling romantic drama. Tell Me Lies season 2 was confirmed in November 2022, but was delayed again and again by various unforeseen circumstances. The Hollywood strikes brought the industry to a halt for most of 2023 and are largely responsible for keeping Tell Me Lies season 2 out of production until early 2024. 



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG-AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.

 Tell Me Lies Season 2 Story 
          

Since the first season was just a sample of what was to come, viewers can expect season 2 of Tell Me Lies to escalate to even more tense and dramatic places. Though there are a plethora of threads still left to pull, the most pressing is Stephen&#39;s engagement to Lydia in the 2015 timeline and how that came about. On top of that, the fallout of Stephen dating Diana at the end of season 1 will likely cause Lucy to go on a jealous rampage that could have lasting repercussions in season 2.
