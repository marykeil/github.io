## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Loren Brovarnik calls out the &#34;trolls&#34; and &#34;haters&#34; after having to deal with unwarranted criticism on Instagram.




90 Day Fiancé star Loren Brovarnik showed her critics the middle finger after being called &#34;annoying.&#34; The Florida resident is a regular cast member on Pillow Talk with her husband Alexei Brovarnik. Loren first starred in 90 Day Fiancé season 3, during which she married Alexei, whom she&#39;d met in Israel. Their heartwarming love story was mostly drama-free, earning them one of the top spots in the franchise&#39;s most loved couples. However, Loren&#39;s popularity has declined over time after being accused of being a secret mean girl and clout chaser.




Loren has been working as a mom influencer while raising her three kids. She recently posted a mirror selfie captioned, &#34;Blazer szn,&#34; while posing with a peace sign. Loren&#39;s now lashing out as her social media followers who criticized the photo.


 

Loren may have expected the fan reactions to the post to be from her fun and happy followers, but instead, she received comments such as, &#34;I really used to like her. Suddenly a mommy make over and modeling her clothes&#34; and &#34;people are tired of looking at you just about every day! Truly annoying&#34; from fans asking Loren to get over herself. The amount of negativity in her comments section made Loren lash out at the critics by sharing a selfie on her Instagram Stories captioned, &#34;Ooooff the haters are out today. Have a blessed day.”





 Loren Brovarnik Questions Why Critics Follow Her On Social Media 
          

Loren took the selfie while resting her chin on one hand and placing her middle finger on her cheek to convey an offensive gesture. Loren wanted to make her message to her critics loud and clear. She even addressed the criticism she was getting in a series of Instagram Stories that she uploaded after a successful therapy session. Loren asked her followers about how she&#39;d noticed there has been such a rise in negativity online and a decline in empowering others. While she addressed “what’s going on in the world,&#34; Loren observed how things have gotten so bad, especially with people following people that they don’t like on Instagram.

“I don’t have time for that,” Loren asked. She wondered why people follow her if they are not interested in her content anymore. Loren said that she had been posting about her mom bun, pimples, and breaking out while sharing her “journey” with them. Loren explained that everyone has different chapters and phases, and her journey is no different. “So if you don’t like it, then just don’t follow,” she added. Loren reminded her critics that they don’t have to sit behind their phones and bash someone they don’t even know for absolutely no reason. She fails to understand why people feel good about doing something like that.

Loren is now thanking her supporters for helping her stay grounded and get through the day. She has understood that the “haters are just trolls” and it’s her supporters who really matter. Loren is choosing to acknowledge the positive and the good in her life. She’s learned to count her blessings every day. Having both fans and critics is part and parcel of her life as a celebrity and especially as a 90 Day Fiancé cast member who&#39;s spent the last few years in front of the camera and on social media, giving fans a peek into the most personal aspects of her life and inviting them to form an opinion about her.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
