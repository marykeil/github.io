## Literature Review
The Masked Singer season 10 finals are about to begin. Which finalist has the best chance of winning based on their performances so far?




The Masked Singer season 10 is about to begin its Group A, B, and C finals, and some of the contestants have a better chance of making it through to the finale and winning the Golden Masked Trophy than others. During the finals, the panelists--Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger--will have one opportunity to use the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell, and send one contestant straight to the finale. The Ding Dong Keep It On Bell hasn&#39;t been an option yet in season 10, but it will make a comeback during the finals.
Throughout The Masked Singer season 10, many legendary stars have been unmasked. During the premiere, Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse. From Group A, Anthony Anderson (Rubber Ducky), Tom Sandoval (Diver), and Michael Rapaport (Pickle) were revealed, while Group B&#39;s Billie Jean King (Royal Hen) and Tyler Posey (Hawk) were unmasked. In addition, Group C&#39;s Luann de Lesseps (Hibiscus) and Metta World Peace (Cuddle Monster) were revealed. Here&#39;s how the finalists from Group A (Gazelle, S&#39;More, Cow), Group B (Tiki, Husky, Sea Queen), and Group C (Donut, Candelabra, Anteater) rank based on their performances so far.

 9  Anteater 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group C Finalist


Group C finalist Anteater has had the hardest journey to the finals of any contestant in any group because he&#39;s the only singer who&#39;s had to compete in two Smackdowns. Despite his magnificent vocals and strong stage presence, he was in the bottom two for two weeks in a row. The first week, he sang &#34;Walking in Memphis&#34; by Marc Cohn, followed by &#34;I Want It That Way&#34; by Backstreet Boys in his second week.
For his first Smackdown, Anteater bested Luann de Lesseps (Hibiscus) when they both sang, &#34;Hey Mickey&#34; by Toni Basil. He then won his second Smackdown versus Metta World Peace (Cuddle Monster) after they both sang &#34;Can&#39;t Stop the Feeling!&#34; by Justin Timberlake. Although being in the bottom two for both of his performances might seem like a huge obstacle in the way of getting to the finals, it does give Anteater an advantage because he&#39;s had the opportunity to sing for the panelists more than any of the other contestants. He holds a special place in their hearts.





 8  S&#39;More 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group A Finalist


S&#39;More has had the most difficult journey to the Group A finals among himself, Gazelle, and Cow. He started out strong in his first week with a smooth version of Niall Horan&#39;s &#34;Slow Hands&#34; and stole hearts in week 2 with his rousing rendition of &#34;Moves Like Jagger&#34; by Maroon 5.
However, in S&#39;More&#39;s third week, he found himself in the bottom two after his performance of &#34;Hey There Delilah&#34; by Plain White T&#39;s. He then won the Smackdown versus Wild Card contestant Michael Rapaport (Pickle), in which they both sang &#34;Sugar, We&#39;re Goin Down&#34; by Fall Out Boy. With his stellar vocals, S&#39;More has captivated the panel, so there&#39;s a good chance that they might save him with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell, but his fellow Group A contestants, Gazelle and Cow, are very strong singers as well.
            
 
 The Masked Singer Season 10: Every Celebrity Reveal 
The Masked Singer season 10 had 17 incredible reveals. Here&#39;s every celebrity who was unmasked in the mystery singing competition&#39;s milestone season.









 7  Tiki 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group B Finalist


The Masked Singer Group B contestant Tiki is obviously a rock star. After his powerful first performance of &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&#34; by Elton John, he found himself in the bottom two the following week after he sang &#34;Magic&#34; by Pilot. In order to earn his spot in the Group B finals, Tiki had to win the Smackdown versus Tyler Posey (Hawk), in which they both sang &#34;Monster&#34; by Lady Gaga.
Although a win from Tiki would be awesome because his style of singing is so unique, the fact that he was already in the bottom two could make it harder for him. However, Bishop Briggs (Medusa) won The Masked Singer season 9 after being saved by the panelists with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell in week 3 of the competition, so anything is possible.





 6  Sea Queen 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group B Finalist


Sea Queen was a Group B Wild Card, and she has the distinction of being the only Wild Card contestant of the season who didn&#39;t participate in a Smackdown. Her one performance of &#34;Love Potion No. 9&#34; by The Searchers was so enchanting that she went straight to the finals. Unlike the other contestants, Sea Queen has had just one performance so far in the competition, so she&#39;s not as well-known to the panelists as some of the other contestants who&#39;ve stolen their hearts. However, Sea Queen&#39;s voice is so mystical that she could continue to cast her spell, make it to the finale, and win.





 5  Donut 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group C Finalist


As an original Group C finalist, Donut moved the audience with his emotional performances of &#34;Hooked on a Feeling&#34; by Blue Swede and &#34;I Do (Cherish You) by 98 Degrees. He showed his vulnerability when he talked about the loss of his wife, and showed how healing performing can be. Donut&#39;s relatable story, along with his immense talent, might earn him a spot in the finale, and the Golden Mask Trophy.





 4  Gazelle 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group A Finalist


Gazelle was one of the original Masked Singer Group A finalists. She&#39;s had many impressive performances so far on the show, including &#34;Uninvited&#34; by Alanis Morissette, &#34;The One That Got Away&#34; by Katy Perry, and &#34;Lucky&#34; by Britney Spears. Gazelle&#39;s stunning vocals and beautiful stage presence could earn her a place in the finale, but she has some tough competition with her fellow Group A contestant, Cow. However, the judges could use their Ding Dong Keep It On Bell Save to keep both of them in the competition for the finale.
            
 
 Who Made It To The Masked Singer Season 10 Finals From Each Group? 
The three Masked Singer season 10 groups have performed, and three from each are moving on. Here&#39;s who made it to the finals from Groups A, B, and C.









 3  Candelabra 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group C Finalist


Original Group C finalist Candelabra lit the stage on fire with her soulful performances of &#34;1 Thing&#34; by Amerie and &#34;All My Life&#34; by K-Ci &amp; JoJo. The panelists think that Candelabra is a professional singer, and have guessed some of the most iconic artists for her identity. Her singing and dancing dominates the stage, and she has a great chance of winning The Masked Singer.





 2  Husky 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group B Finalist


Husky is an original member of Group B. He easily made it through to the Group B finals singing entertaining versions of &#34;Bennie and the Jets&#34; by Elton John and &#34;Super Freak&#34; by Rick James. Husky&#39;s effortless performances indicate that he&#39;s most likely a professional singer. Husky could definitely win The Masked Singer season 10, but he&#39;ll have some tough competition from the other groups with singers he hasn&#39;t faced yet.





 1  Cow 
The Masked Singer Season 10 Group A Finalist


Cow is an original Group A member. He stunned the panel when his voice revealed that he was a male singer because his costume looks female. Cow sailed through to the finals with his extraordinary renditions of &#34;Bones&#34; by Imagine Dragons, &#34;Treasure&#34; by Bruno Mars, and &#34;Cry Me a River&#34; by Justin Timberlake. Although he&#39;ll be competing against some of the best singers in Masked Singer history, Cow is obviously a professional and seasoned performer who could easily take home The Golden Mask Trophy in this milestone season.
The Masked Singer season 10 has been a spectacular celebration of singing so far. These nine competitors are all supremely talented, and any one of them could be crowned the winner. As these talented singers are unmasked, the question of &#34;Who is that?&#34; will finally be answered. The Masked Singer season 10 finals are certain to be very exciting, and the finale will be one of the best in the show&#39;s history.
The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
