# Monarch Show Corrects The Biggest Problem With KOTM s Villain Plan


## SUMMARY 



  Monarch: Legacy of Monsters corrects the villains&#39; plan from Godzilla: King of the Monsters by showing that their idea was pointless.   The show&#39;s dual timelines provide depth to the Monsterverse lore, exploring the origins of Monarch and introducing theories and historical context.   Colonel Lee Shaw&#39;s plan to stop Titans from emerging makes more sense than the eco-terrorists&#39; plan to unleash them, considering the potential death and destruction caused by the Titans and the unknown impact on the globe.

## Literature Review
Monarch: Legacy of Monsters reveals that Lee Shaw is correcting the one of biggest problems the villains introduced in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.




Warning: Spoilers for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8Monarch: Legacy of Monsters finally corrected a plan from the villains in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and showed that their haphazard idea was pointless. Happening before any of the events of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters and one of the major characters in the show was able to provide a blueprint for future monster hunters, but the events in Episode 8 don&#39;t seem to have resonated with the plot of future films. Monarch: Legacy of Monster&#39;s place in the Monsterverse timeline means that certain aspects of the story could have provided a guide for future stories like Godzilla: King of the Monsters.




The dual timelines of the Monarach: Legacy of Monsters characters has lent the show to providing more depth and meaning to many of the Monsterverse lore questions that exist because of the movies. The timeline in the 1950s has allowed the show to explore the origins of Monarch and introduce theories, Titans, and historical context that the movies could not provide. The 2015 timeline, however, can pose problems of continuity and logic because it is set directly in the middle of events of a series of films. One of those major failures in logic occurs when Colonel Lee Shaw seeks to contain the Titans before others try to free them.


 Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Flips Emma &amp; Jonah&#39;s Villain Plan 
          

In Episode 8 of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, the older Lee Shaw is traveling the globe to various Titan locations, fighting Monarch involvement along the way. His goal is to blow up as many portals to the Monsterverse&#39;s Hollow Earth, which he believes will close the doors to more Titans entering earth. This path around the world is similar to the one forged by the eco-terrorists led by Colonel Alan Jonah and joined by Dr. Emma Russell in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, who are also hunting the known locations of each Titan with echo-location and Monarch data.




However, there are two major differences between the plan Shaw intends to complete and the one concocted by the villains in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. First, Shaw wants to stop the Titans from emerging, not bring them out into the world, which was the goal of the eco-terrorists and Colonel Jonah. The second major difference is that Shaw&#39;s plan actually makes sense in terms of what the global armed forces, Monarch, and other monster hunters are trying to accomplish. Russell and Jonah&#39;s plan was to unleash Titans on the earth and let them naturally address issues of human overpopulation, lack of resources, and dwindling natural environment.



 Lee Shaw Has The First Monsterverse Villain Plan That Makes Sense 
          

This plan developed by Godzilla&#39;s King of the Monsters primary villains was clearly flawed because of the death and destruction that would be caused. In addition, the environment and impact on the globe would be a complete unknown if upwards of a dozen Titans roamed the earth. There are no guarantees that Titans, most of whom are driven by domination and natural hierarchy, would provide the world with the necessary purging and resource-saving that Jonah&#39;s team thinks it will. Lee Shaw&#39;s plan of closing off the Hollow Earth entrances to keep the Titans shut off from our world, however, sounds reasonable compared to this plan and to several others that have been developed throughout the Monsterverse.




APEX Corporation was revealed in Episode 7, and in Godzilla vs. Kong they would use their animal neural interface technology to develop Mechagodzilla, which was destroyed by the Titans. Dr. Serizawa&#39;s plan in Godzilla: King of the Monsters was to walk a nuclear bomb next to a mortally wounded Godzilla and detonate it, where one wrong step could have had disastrous results. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters finally introduces a plan that makes sense, although the end of Episode 8 sees Shaw and Cate Randa fall into a portal along with a Titan, leaving a cliffhanger as to whether Shaw will be able to continue his work.
