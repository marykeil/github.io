## Literature Review
The Real Housewives Of Orange County season 18 will likely be coming back in 2024, but the show still has some unknown details such as the cast. 




The Real Housewives Of Orange County season 18 is set to return sometime in 2024, but some details are still unknown. The Bravo series began back in 2006 and was the inception into the world of The Real Housewives. Thanks to RHOC, viewers have been introduced to 11 different Real Housewives series in the United States alone. While many other spin-offs have done well among fans, RHOC will always be known as the series that skyrocketed The Real Housewives to popularity. Not only has the series helped jumpstart other shows, but RHOC alone has had over 26 housewives appear throughout its 17 seasons.




Some of RHOC&#39;s most well-known stars include Vicki Gunvalson (also known as the &#34;OG of the OC&#34;), Tamra Judge, Shannon Beador, Heather Dubrow, and many more. Not only has the cast been stellar over the years, but RHOC also has some of the craziest storylines in Housewives&#39; history. Who could forget Brooks Ayers faking cancer and Vicki going along with it, Shannon&#39;s divorce from ex-husband David Beador, Shannon&#39;s weight-loss journey, and Tamra meeting and getting married to Eddie Judge, just to name a few. Overall, RHOC has been a classic series in The Real Housewives franchise, and there&#39;s so much more to come in the upcoming season 18.

While nothing has been officially confirmed by Bravo, RHOC will likely return for season 18. Despite the show&#39;s less-than-captivating storylines from seasons 13 to 15, RHOC went through a renaissance during season 16 when Heather returned as a cast member. Since then, RHOC has been a fan favorite and one of the show&#39;s fans of the franchise look forward to the most. It&#39;s unclear when the new season will return; however, it&#39;s safe to say that RHOC season 18 will premiere sometime in 2024.



 The Real Housewives Of Orange County Season 18 Potential Release Window 
          

The release date for RHOC season 18 has yet to be revealed. However, judging by the release date of prior seasons, it&#39;s easy to guess when the new season will premiere. For the most part, RHOC seasons have premiered closer to the second half of the year. During the very early years of the show, most seasons aired sometime in November. However, for many years after, seasons would often premiere between April and July. For the last three seasons, RHOC has premiered in October, December, and most recently, June. There have been no signs of the cast filming, so RHOC season 18 will likely have a late 2024 release date.






 The Real Housewives Of Orange County Season 18 Potential Cast 
         

The cast for RHOC season 18 hasn&#39;t been confirmed by Bravo as of December 2023. However, a few have confirmed that they aren&#39;t returning. In late November 2023, Taylor Armstrong, who appeared as a friend on RHOC season 17, confirmed she would not be returning to the Bravo series. Taylor shared the news in an Instagram post and wrote in the caption, &#34;Loved spending time with the ladies of #RHOC and thankful I got to give the viewers an update on my life. Iâ€™ve made some real friendships that I cherish. Wishing the ladies all the best for season 18.&#34;

Her casting was historic as she was the first housewife to do a crossover, as Taylor first appeared on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills from seasons 1-3. Other than Taylor, no other cast members have been officially announced. However, Deadline did reveal that Heather will likely be returning for RHOC season 18. The cast last season included Tamra, Shannon, Gina Kirschenheiter, Emily Simpson, and Jennifer Pedranti, who was new to RHOC. Vicki also returned as a friend and has said she will only return for RHOC season 18 if she&#39;s a full-time cast member.






 When Will The Real Housewives Of Orange County Season 18 Start Filming? 
          

As for if and when RHOC season 18 will start filming, that is also currently unknown. They could begin filming as early as the beginning of the new year, which they have done in the past, or start later in the year, around the summertime, as they have done as of late. However, what is known is that the show has not started filming the new season as of December 2023. As long as The Real Housewives Of Orange County season 18 premieres sometime in 2024, fans will be happy whenever the season starts.



The Real Housewives Of Orange County is streaming all episodes on Peacock.
