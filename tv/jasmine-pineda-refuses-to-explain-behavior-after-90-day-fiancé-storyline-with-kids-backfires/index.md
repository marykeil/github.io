## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda&#39;s big revelation about her son on season 10 is not getting her any sympathy. Jasmine&#39;s son JC has special needs.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda’s major revelation about her kids on season 10 is not getting the right kind of reactions from certain viewers. Jasmine, a former English literature teacher from Panama City, met Gino Palazzolo from Canton, Michigan on a dating platform. Jasmine was divorced from her ex-husband and shared two sons, Juance and JC, with him. Jasmine made Gino promise that he’d get her children to the U.S. once they got married. Meanwhile, Gino kept pushing Jasmine to have a baby. During episode 12, Jasmine revealed her son, JC, was born with special needs.




After the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 episode, Jasmine posted an Instagram Story addressing her followers and the show’s viewers.

          

Jasmine told them, “Don&#39;t even bother to ask anything show-related.” She said that she was not going to explain, address, or comment on anything. Jasmine asked her fans to simply keep watching the show. “That&#39;s all you&#39;ll get from me.

I love you all, Jazzy,” she added. Jasmine could have been responding to comments criticizing Jasmine’s storyline with her kids. For instance, @BitterGirl2128 tweeted, “If Jasmine cares so much about her children, why is she flying all over the world taking non-stop vacations and getting boob jobs and butt implants?”

 Jasmine’s 90 Day Fiancé Season 10 Storyline Explained 
          

Someone else pointed out how Jasmine was crying on camera about her child having special needs, but she was not even with him. “I’d never leave his side,” @Melissa76751925 wrote. Jasmine came to the U.S. after dating Gino for three years in the 2023 reality TV show. Jasmine didn’t know that Gino had quit his job so he could spend more time with her. Jasmine was furious when Gino told her the truth. She wondered if it would affect the chances of her bringing her kids to America. Meanwhile, Jasmine had spent all of her wedding dress allowance on getting butt implants while also borrowing extra money from her ex-boyfriend.


 




Jasmine accused Gino of cheating on her when she found lip-gloss lying underneath her car seat. She also discovered that Gino had visited a strip club for his bachelor party without informing Jasmine. The 90 Day Fiancé couple almost broke up with Jasmine throwing away her ring. They did get back together, so they could visit Miami. Jasmine preferred Miami over the cold of Michigan. They were having a good time during their vacation when Jasmine told Gino it was her biggest fear that she’d give birth to another child with special needs. She explained that people in the past had been very mean and had no tolerance.

Jasmine asked Gino what would happen if she couldn’t give him a “neurotypical” kid. Gino assured Jasmine that they would take care of the child no matter what. Considering Jasmine made such a big confession in the episode, 90 Day Fiancé fans could want to know more details about Jasmine the mother, more than her relationship with Gino. However, Jasmine is in no mood to entertain fan questions. Jasmine is busy making moves in the U.S. as an influencer and an upcoming businesswoman.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
