# Sister Wives Christine &amp; Janelle Claim Kody Is Lashing Out For This 1 Specific Reason


## SUMMARY 



  Christine and Janelle dismiss Kody&#39;s claims of them bad-mouthing him to their children, suggesting he&#39;s trying to find fault with others because he&#39;s unhappy with his own life.   Although they don&#39;t care about their future relationships with Kody, Christine and Janelle hope Kody will work on repairing his relationships with his estranged children.   Kody distances himself from his children and blames them, rather than taking responsibility for his own actions and making an effort to reconcile with them. Christine and Janelle keep Sister Wives going in their own way.

## Literature Review
Sister Wives Christine Brown and Janelle Brown share why they believe Kody Brown has been lashing out against his former wives in difficult moments.




Sister Wives Christine Brown and Janelle Brown shared their thoughts surrounding Kody Brown&#39;s claims about his ex-wives trash-talking him on the first installment of Sister Wives: One On One. While Christine and Janelle have made the difficult decision to end their marriages with Kody, they&#39;re still bound together by their children and Sister Wives, leaving a lot of room for the exes to talk about each other. In the first installment of the four-part Tell-All episodes, Kody alleged that his exes have spent the majority of their time trashing him. He even shared that he feels Janelle and Christine are closer now because they have him as a common enemy.




In an interview with E! News, Christine and Janelle shared their thoughts on the claims that they&#39;ve bad-mouthed Kody to their children. &#34;I think he&#39;s trying to find fault because he&#39;s not liking things that are happening in his life,&#34; Christine explained, &#34;So he&#39;s trying to find fault with other people.&#34; Janelle, who left Kody during Sister Wives season 18, explained, &#34;I feel bad that he feels like that. But it does feel like he&#39;s trying to find a reason.&#34; While the women don&#39;t feel there&#39;s any validity in Kody&#39;s claims, they&#39;re hopeful that things can be mended in time.

 Kody Brown Needs To Fix Relationships With His Kids 
          

While Janelle and Christine don&#39;t care much about the relationships they have with Kody in the future, they&#39;re both incredibly hopeful that Kody will try to fix things with their children, many of whom he&#39;s estranged from. &#34;His relationship with his kids is his responsibility. He needs to fix it,&#34; Christine shared, continuing, &#34;We actually would love Kody to have a great relationship with all of his children, and I do whatever I can to facilitate that.&#34; Janelle agreed, explaining, &#34;I hope time eventually heals [things]...I&#39;m hoping that over time, he can find a relationship with the children that he&#39;s estranged from...I just hope that there is a peace.&#34;





 

Kody&#39;s issues with his children haven&#39;t come to a boil overnight, but instead, have grown as his perspectives have changed in the last few years. While he&#39;s had a rocky road with some of his kids more recently, Kody&#39;s issues with Garrison Brown and Gabriel Brown have been slowly growing for years, resulting in Kody missing out on many of his children&#39;s lives entirely. The patriarch of the Brown family has been slowly distancing himself from his kids for a while but chooses to lay the blame on the kids instead of himself, even though he refuses to reach out to them or offer any sort of olive branch.

While Kody sees everyone outside his immediate family with Robyn as a villain, it&#39;s possible that his biggest opposition is himself. While Kody has made claims that Christine and Janelle are spewing hatred for him at their children, he hasn&#39;t taken any initiative to try and repair his relationships with them at all. Rather than laying blame on others, Kody could be reaching out to his kids to see what he can do to repair the damage. In turn, he could also share that his feelings have been hurt. While Kody tries to salvage his relationships, Christine and Janelle have been keeping Sister Wives afloat in their own charming way.
