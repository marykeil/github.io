## Literature Review
Even the most eye-catching TV shows will inevitably fail if they can’t deliver on the basics. Great shows need much more than a unique premise.




TV shows can grab people&#39;s attention with a unique and exciting concept, but there are plenty of cases where audiences are let down by terrible execution. Sometimes, a show is just different to what people were expecting, and although this can be disappointing, there&#39;s no need to write the show off. Unfortunately, there are many more examples of when a show spoils a good premise with lazy plotting, one-dimensional characters, or boring dialogue. As it turns out, good concepts are relatively easy to come by, and they aren&#39;t usually what makes or breaks a TV show.
An intriguing premise can only do so much for a TV show. With any show, the novelty will eventually wear off, so the storytelling is paramount. Shows need to be able to explore their premises in new and interesting ways, and the writers must understand what excites people about an idea in the first place. However, even TV shows which promise to be completely unique still need to execute the fundamentals well. Interesting characters responding to difficult situations are vital to both comedy and drama, and failing to deliver on this basic concept means that even the most revolutionary TV shows will inevitably fall flat.









 








 10  Velma (2023-) 
A complete reinvention of beloved characters


 







Scooby-Doo and Mystery Incorporated have been popular characters for decades, in many different styles and iterations, so an adult animated sitcom seemed like it could be a fun reinvention. Unfortunately, Velma is not much of a reboot, as it completely changes the characters beyond recognition. Velma is snarky and sarcastic, Fred is an entitled rich kid, and Daphne is a drug dealer. The biggest sin by far is that Scooby-Doo is not even in Velma. Some fresh ideas were necessary, but Velma goes overboard in rewriting a beloved concept. Despite receiving a ton of backlash from fans, Velma has been renewed for season 2.





 9  Ghosts (2021-) 
A lifeless American remake of a British hit
        

Not all successful British shows should have American remakes, but Ghosts is one that fully justifies the treatment. Ghosts follows a young couple as they inherit a large country house. Allison soon suffers a head injury which gifts her with the ability to see all the ghosts which inhabit the grounds. The ghosts each represent different stereotypes from British history, so an American version had the potential to transfer this idea to US history. Sadly, the show’s misfiring comedy lets down some interesting characters. There have been some terrible American remakes of British sitcoms over the years, and Ghosts couldn’t escape the same fate.





 8  Space Force (2020-2022) 
The workplace sitcom failed to achieve lift-off

        

The show runner of The Office, Greg Daniels, reunited with Steve Carell in 2020 for Space Force, a workplace sitcom about the newest branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Space Force doesn’t compare to The Office, either in terms of its quality or its popularity, and it was canceled after just two seasons on Netflix. Space Force wastes a brilliant comedy cast on jokes that often miss their mark and a plot with no thrust. The Office is extremely grounded and relatable. By contrast, so many unbelievable things happen in Space Force that it’s hard to understand the rules of the universe, and it’s therefore hard to relate to the characters.





 7  The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power (2022-) 
Lacking in both direction and intrigue


 







The Rings of Power struggles to find an intriguing angle within its richly detailed world. 

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power had some of the greatest fantasy novels ever written as source material, and Peter Jackson’s remarkable trilogy to refer to. Unfortunately, this combination didn’t quite yield the expected results, or at least it hasn’t yet. There is a good chance that The Rings of Power season 2 will sort out some of the teething problems, but the first season didn’t justify the hype. The plot meanders between a series of vaguely related characters, some of whom are left without a compelling story of their own. The Rings of Power struggles to find an intriguing angle within its richly detailed world.





 6  Queen Cleopatra (2023) 
A confused blend of soap opera and hard facts
        

There have been some excellent TV shows about Ancient Rome, but Ancient Egypt’s potential remains relatively untapped. Netflix’s Queen Cleopatra promised to tell the story of one of Egypt’s most fascinating figures, but it’s an uneasy mixture of documentary and drama. The tonal shifts between the talking heads and the artistic recreations are far too jarring, as if the show is trying to be two things at once. Had it committed to either serious historical discussion or lavish historical soap, it could have been worthwhile. Queen Cleopatra wasn’t precise enough to examine its subject with any real depth or nuance.





 5  Super Drags (2018) 
Queer superheroes who fail to deliver the laughs
        

Super Drags is a Brazilian animated comedy about a group of drag queen superheroes, and it shares a similar punchy visual style with The Powerpuff Girls. Non-English language comedies don’t often find an audience in English-speaking countries, but Super Drags has an English dub featuring stars from Ru Paul’s Drag Race. The stale, juvenile humor ruins what could have been a cult hit, and a groundbreaking queer show. Super Drags might have been able to develop a more compelling story with more than five episodes, but this wouldn’t have helped improve some cringe-inducing jokes, which play on outdated queer stereotypes but frequently fail to land.





 4  Under The Dome (2013-2015) 
Paranormal adventure which spun out of control
        

Stephen King’s novels have been adapted into some superb movies and TV shows, and Under the Dome began with some promise. It needed some refining, but what it got instead was a left turn into risible plot contrivances. Each ludicrous twist pushed the show further from reality, and by its third season, Under the Dome resembled Stephen King’s work in name only. It could have been brilliant if it had been a miniseries from the beginning, rather than spinning into increasingly outlandish story lines to drag out the drama. As soon as the show departs from all basis in reality, there is no reason to care about the outcome.





 3  The Twilight Zone (2019-2020) 
A weak imitation of a revolutionary show
        

The Twilight Zone is one of the most influential TV shows of all time, and its effects can still be felt decades later. In 2019, Jordan Peele stepped into Rod Serling’s shoes for a reboot, but this failed to stack up to the original. The Twilight Zone has been unsuccessfully rebooted multiple times. The horror credentials of Peele were a sign that this time might be different, until the series aired, and each episode was either derivative or bereft of tension. If the series managed to reignite interest in the original series, then it was not a total waste, but it was a missed opportunity.





 2  Joey (2004-2006) 
The right spinoff with the wrong execution
        

TV spinoffs often struggle to live up to the standards of the original show. For every Better Call Saul or Law and Order: SVU, there are at least half a dozen duds. Out of all the characters on Friends, Joey was probably the right choice for a spinoff, since his career as an actor provided a fresh perspective that Friends hadn’t explored. Joey failed to surround Matt LeBlanc with a cast anywhere near as funny as his costars on Friends, but it still could have worked if it had managed to maintain Joey Tribbiani’s goofy, immature charm. His character becomes anxious and pessimistic in Joey.
            
 
 10 Unfortunately Terrible Spinoffs To Amazing TV Shows 
Some shows are so engaging with brilliant characters that they demand a spin-off to expand the narrative, other spin-offs aren&#39;t quite as necessary.









 1  Avenue 5 (2020-2022) 
Political satire in a sci-fi setting


 







Armando Iannucci has a remarkable track record with TV shows, creating both The Thick of It and Veep, but Avenue 5 misses the mark. 

Due to a terrible error, a spaceship full of cruise passengers are faced with the reality that their estimated return to Earth has ballooned from two weeks to three years. This sci-fi premise could be a horror movie, but Avenue 5 plays it as a sitcom, using the futuristic setting to mock the uber-rich and incompetent leaders. Armando Iannucci has a remarkable track record with TV shows, creating both The Thick of It and Veep, but Avenue 5 misses the mark. The most interesting secret is Captain Jack’s fraudulent personality, but this is revealed far too soon, and the show drifts along as slowly as the ship.
