## Literature Review
Apple TV&#43; renewed Severance for season 2 in 2022, but a release date is still unknown. So, in the meantime, fans can watch a similar show on Netflix.




Sadly, the return of Severance still doesn&#39;t have a timetable. But the good news is that Netflix has a similar television series that serves as the perfect replacement for the Apple TV&#43; show that fans can watch while waiting for season 2. The first season of the science fiction psychological thriller series debuted in early 2022 and swiftly received praise from critics and audiences alike. The show went on to be nominated in 14 different categories at the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2022, winning awards for Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Original Dramatic Score). Consequentially, anticipation for the upcoming set of episodes has been building for a while.




Severance stars Adam Scott as Mark Scout, an employee of Lumon Industries who underwent the &#34;severance&#34; procedure, which surgically separated his consciousness into two — one for work and one for his personal life. Season 1 centers around Mark uncovering the secrets of the biotechnology corporation when he encounters one of his colleagues outside of work. Given the nature of the Apple TV&#43; series, the Severance season 1 finale ended on a cliffhanger, meaning that fans have waited a long time to learn what happens next in the story. Unfortunately, the wait isn&#39;t over, but they can pass the time by watching related series.


 Netflix&#39;s Maniac Is The Perfect Show To Watch While Waiting For Severance Season 2 
          

While anticipation for Severance season 2 continues to build, the best television show to watch while waiting is currently available to stream on Netflix — Maniac. Maniac is a 2018 psychological black comedy-drama miniseries starring Emma Stone as Annie Landsberg and Jonah Hill as Owen Milgrim. Without giving too much away, Annie and Owen are two strangers who participate in a pharmaceutical trial in New York City in the future, resulting in them traveling through multiple hallucinatory worlds.




The Netflix show is only ten episodes long, seeing as it is a limited series and wasn&#39;t renewed for a second season. So, depending on how long it takes someone to watch any show, it could help fill the time before Severance season 2 premieres or be a quick binge. Whatever the case, Maniac, which received positive reviews from critics, is the perfect (temporary) replacement for the Apple TV&#43; thriller.

                  7 Burning Questions Severance Season 2 Needs To Answer   With many questions lingering since Severance ended, anticipation builds for season 2 to answer some of the series&#39; most burning questions.     



 Emma Stone &amp; Jonah Hill&#39;s 2018 Netflix Show Has A Lot In Common With Severance 
          

Maniac shares a lot of qualities with the Apple TV&#43; science fiction psychological thriller series. The Netflix show contains similar mind-bending elements, and both works feature experimental biotech trials with unexpected twists. Plus, the casts of Maniac and Severance include big names (Jonah Hill and Adam Scott) who are typically known for starring in comedies thrust into more serious roles. As a result, Maniac can fill the Severance-sized holes in viewers&#39; hearts while waiting for the season 2 premiere.






Severance season 2 is expected to be released in 2024.
