## Literature Review
Sister Wives lead Kody Brown is revealing the real reason he couldn&#39;t split with Christine Brown before she decided to end their 26-year marriage.




Kody Brown is finally telling Sister Wives fans about the shocking reason why he was unwilling to split with Christine Brown before she initiated the separation. Cody and Christine were spiritually married on March 25, 1994. Kody had claimed that he married Christine because she was “polygamist royalty” and he believed her family name could help his status in the church. Christine left Kody after 26 years together because, according to her, Kody broke her daughter Ysabel’s heart. Kody had declined to join them for Ysabel’s scoliosis operation and otherwise, Christine felt she was lacking trust and communication in their relationship.




A teaser clip for the upcoming Sister Wives Look Back: How It’s Going special shared by UsWeekly has Kody claiming that Christine called him a “coward” because he was never willing to break up with her. “It’s because, well, you’re not really allowed,” Kody explained. The ex-spouses will be watching a clip of a conversation they had in 2021 in which Christine confessed she no longer wished to be married to Kody. Back then, Kody had said he was “good with that” and maintained that neither of them was a “prisoner” in their spiritual marriage.

However, Kody has now changed his mind. After all, he thinks he is a “prisoner” because he couldn’t just tell her, “Hey b**ch, I’m done with you.” Kody explained that when a polygamist husband thinks that he can’t deal with a woman anymore, he has to go “through the church authority channel.” Kody explained his initial reaction by saying the authority would have needed him to remain married to Christine. “Once we’ve committed to marry a woman, the choice is gone,” he added. Kody claims he is “glad” that Christine showed bravery in splitting with him. He confessed he wasn’t in love with Christine.


 

“As much as I tried to love her, it just wasn’t working all the time,” he continued. Meanwhile, TLC&#39;s Christine is very much in love because she met the love of her life after leaving Kody. Christine calls David Woolley her soulmate. She knows that her current marriage comes without any strings attached. Her marriage to Kody was just the opposite. The first thing she realized about David was that he loved her and made it known. It gave her the confidence to be herself. Christine didn’t have to do anything to earn David’s love. Christine was looking for a partner when she matched with David on the dating website, and she found him.




Christine was instantly smitten by David being able to say everything right. She was impressed by how genuine he was. Christine said she didn’t know what she “didn’t have before” when she was with Kody. However, meeting his family made Christine realize that “this was it,” before she married him. Christine introduced David to the world more than a year after she called it quits with Kody. They were engaged two months later, and Sister Wives star Christine was walking down the aisle in October 2023 at her fairytale wedding ceremony in Moab, Utah.



Sister Wives: Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding airs January 7 and 14 at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
