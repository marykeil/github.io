## Literature Review

After over 30 years of polygamy, Kody Brown found himself in a monogamous marriage with his fourth wife, Robyn. Are they headed for divorce too?




The dissolution of Kody Brown&#39;s plural family started with Christine Brown&#39;s exit during Sister Wives season 17, and now it seems he and Robyn Brown might be headed for divorce. Christine was Kody&#39;s third wife for 25 years and left Kody in 2021. Christine&#39;s decision reverberated throughout the entire Brown family. In 2022, after 30 years of marriage, Kody&#39;s third wife, Janelle Brown, decided to leave Kody too. Finally, Kody&#39;s first wife, Meri Brown, was tired of being neglected by Kody and followed suit, leaving the plural marriage. This leaves Robyn, Kody&#39;s fourth and newest wife, as his last remaining wife.




Sister Wives season 1 showed Kody courting and marrying Robyn in 2010. She was the first wife to be added to the family in 16 years. Though the complex plural family had their fair share of problems, Kody&#39;s marriage to Robyn was what triggered their dissolution. Janelle and Christine felt that Kody was showing favoritism to Robyn. For his part, Kody was open about Robyn being the only woman he loved. He claimed to never have loved any of his other three wives, but there are reasons to believe that his marriage with Robyn is headed for divorce as well.

 Robyn Wanted A Plural Family 
          




Robyn has said she wants a plural marriage. She&#39;s revealed that a big part of the reason she fell in love with Kody was because of the Brown family dynamic and wanted to be a part of it. Robyn&#39;s first marriage was monogamous, and it ended badly in divorce. After several years of being a single mom of three kids, Robyn met Kody and his family. Robyn believes in the principle of plural marriage and doesn&#39;t want to be Kody&#39;s sole wife. Since Kody doesn&#39;t currently have any intention of bringing another wife into the family, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Robyn decides their marriage isn&#39;t working.



 Kody Isn&#39;t Cut Out For Monogamy 
          

After being polygamous for more than 30 years, Kody became monogamous when three of his four wives walked away from their plural family. He remained married to Robyn and recently said that, due to his failed relationships, Kody&#39;s no longer an advocate for polygamy. That being said, Kody will get bored being married to only one woman. He may have entered into polygamy out of religious conviction, but the reason plural marriage worked out for him for so long is because Kody loves attention. Also, after raising 18 kids, Kody&#39;s used to having more people around; he will feel stagnant living with one wife and five kids.






 Robyn Will Take Half 
          

When the series Sister Wives first premiered in 2010, Kody was legally married to Meri, his first wife, whom Kody now says he regrets marrying. He was also spiritually married to Janelle and Christine as a part of his polygamist relationship. When Robyn joined the family, she entered into a spiritual marriage with Kody. Kody and Meri were legally married for 14 years before he divorced her in 2014 so he could legally marry Robyn and adopt her three children. Unlike Meri, Janelle, and Christine, if Robyn were to divorce Kody, she&#39;d be entitled to spousal support and child support.

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
