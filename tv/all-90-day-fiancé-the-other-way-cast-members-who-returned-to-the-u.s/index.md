## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way is one of the popular spin-offs, but most of the cast members refused to live abroad and have returned to the U.S.




Several Americans who appeared on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way have returned to the United States after sparking romance in foreign countries. The famous reality TV spin-off has always featured a lot of drama over the years. Most recently, 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 gave a platform to some of the most chaotic pairs with striking differences. One such duo was of New York native Julio Moya and his Dutch girlfriend, Kirsten Schoemaker. The couple planned to settle in the Netherlands after tying the knot. However, Julio got cold feet and retracted from the relationship before moving to his girlfriend’s home country.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 also featured off-screen drama and controversies. One such incident happened when the Turkish man, Sarper Güven, revealed that he had joined the show to find his illegitimate child with another woman. Sarper claimed that he wanted to build a reach and use the power of TV and social media to locate his only descendant. Another off-screen scandal happened when newcomers Kimberly Rochelle and TJ Goswami accused former cast members Sumit Singh and Jenny Slatten of being fake. The former cast members weren’t too happy about such accusations and called Kimberly and TJ immature kids.
