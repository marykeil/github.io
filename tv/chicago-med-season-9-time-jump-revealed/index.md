## Literature Review
Chicago Med showrunner Andy Schneider confirms that season 9 will include a time jump, incorporating the real-life delay into the show.




Chicago Med season 9 will feature a time jump, incorporating the real-life delay into the storyline, according to showrunner Andy Schneider. Returning for a shorter season comprised of 13 episodes because of the scheduling fallout from the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, that fallout will not only impact the number of episodes. It will be reflected in how upcoming storylines are presented during a changing time for the long-running procedural, with high-profile cast exits in the One Chicago franchise.




In an interview with Deadline, Schneider confirms that Chicago Med season 9 will include a time jump. The showrunner explains that it didn&#39;t make sense to pick up from exactly where the NBC drama left off. So, instead, the new season will begin six months after the season 8 finale. The full quote is below:


I wanted to add one thing. Since it’s been so long since we have been in production, we decided to make that part of a timeline. We didn’t think it was realistic to jump back right after the finale. So this premiere takes place six months after the finale.






Chicago Med season 9 debuts Wednesday, January 17 at 8 PM ET on NBC.
