## Literature Review
Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist&#39;s wedding had to be planned so quickly that it might not have happened at all, if not for this person.




The Golden Bachelor engaged couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist will be married in a live televised wedding on Thursday, January 4, and Theresa is now revealing that the nuptials might not have happened at all if not for her daughter, Jen. Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, and Theresa, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, got engaged during The Golden Bachelor season finale, after falling in love on the show. From their first date in which they danced with a flash mob to Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believin&#39;&#34; to their meaningful Fantasy Suite date, they built a strong connection based on love and hope.




In an interview with People, Theresa shared that her daughter, Jen, has been &#34;a lifesaver&#34; during their wedding planning. She explained, &#34;There&#39;s so many decisions that had to be made, and in some instances, she would get the vision board together for me or she would get ideas of dresses and veils and rings.&#34; Theresa said that by mid-December, there were &#34;very few decisions left to be made.&#34; She gushed, &#34;She just keeps feeding me great things, and I’m saying, Yeah, that, that, that.&#39; Seriously – I don’t know if there would be a wedding if she wasn’t involved.&#34;
