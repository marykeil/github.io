## Literature Review
Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina may be one of the greatest to ever play the game, but will she appear on Big Brother Reindeer Games this year?




Big Brother Reindeer Games will see some BB legends taking on holiday-themed competitions as they compete for a cash prize, but will Big Brother legend Janelle Pierzina appear in the series? After a grueling 100-day season, Big Brother 25 has come to a close and the announcement about the new spin-off, Big Brother Reindeer Games, was made during the live finale event by host Julie Chen Moonves. The new series will be a different game than traditional Big Brother, inviting houseguests back to play lower-stakes competitions for a cash prize. Without the need for a social strategy or the presence of live feeds, the series will focus on the physical.




After the series&#39; announcement during the Big Brother 25 finale, many have been curious about the cast lineup for Big Brother Reindeer Games. While BB greats like Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will be joining in as elves who host the competitions, most are more curious about the competitors. Some were hoping to see Janelle, who once held the record for most BB competition wins, on the show.


 

Unfortunately, Janelle shared that she wouldn&#39;t be able to participate. &#34;I can’t I have a new show coming out in January. Can’t have two shows air at the same time,&#34; Janelle shared on Twitter. She is set to appear in the upcoming season of The Traitors US in 2024.


 Janelle Pierzina Will Compete On The Traitors Season 2 Instead 
          




Janelle will be competing on The Traitors season 2, joining an incredible lineup of reality TV greats. While she would&#39;ve loved to compete on both The Traitors and Big Brother Reindeer Games, being under contract with a different network made it impossible for her to do both. Thankfully for Janelle fans, seeing her on The Traitors will put her social game to the test. Rather than relying on competitions, The Traitors challenges its competitors socially through some difficult decisions, hoping to isolate who in the group is a Traitor. A new game for Janelle, her fans are excited to see her try her hand at The Traitors.


 

As one of the stars of The Traitors season 2, Janelle will be part of a cast of reality TV legends. She&#39;ll be joined by her fellow Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling, Real Housewives Tamra Judge, Phaedra Parks, Larsa Pippen, and Shereé Whitfield, as well as The Challenge veterans Chris &#34;CT&#34; Tamburello, and Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio among other competitors. With such a stacked cast, Janelle will have her work cut out for her on The Traitors as she tries to navigate a tangled web of deceit. With cast members from other Bravo shows, Love Island USA, Dancing With The Stars and others, The Traitors season 2 has a diverse cast.




Though Big Brother Reindeer Games will sorely miss Janelle, the fact that she&#39;s pursuing other avenues of reality TV makes it seem like she misses competing. While Janelle herself has said she likely wouldn&#39;t return for another season of Big Brother in the future, the door is never fully closed for someone who loves the game as much as Janelle does. It&#39;s possible that whether it&#39;s on another season of Big Brother Reindeer Games or Big Brother in the future, viewers will get the chance to see Janelle compete once again.
