## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge has been showing off the players who make a big impact, but one player is getting more of a villain edit than any other.




Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Ashley, player 278, has come under fire for her behavior during one of the series most complicated games, Glass Bridge, and is being branded as the show&#39;s biggest villain. With the high stakes of the competition on Squid Game: The Challenge, people displaying their worst behavior isn’t surprising. Ashley, who has been mostly in the background for the majority of the competition, is one of several cast members who is playing the game for themselves, but she may have taken things too far for her fellow competitors. During Glass Bridge, a complex game that requires laser focus, Ashley showed her selfish side at the wrong moment.




During Glass Bridge, the players on Ashley’s team strategized to give everyone a fair chance at making it across. Rather than simply allowing those further ahead in line to have better odds, the players took turns passing one another to make things fair. While Ashley was okay with this plan for others, she chose not to give up her own turn for fan favorite player 301, Trey. “Ashely absolutely refused to play the game everyone else agreed to,” Reddit user u/SkydivingSquid explained. Ashley made a decision for herself rather than her team, ultimately making viewers angry at her decision.

 Ashley’s Squid Game: The Challenge Behavior Explained 
          

While Ashley’s decision was polarizing, many have been slamming her as the villain of Squid Game: The Challenge after her devious decision. As another Reddit user, u/molesterholt, shared, &#34;Ashley made Trey jump 3 times and she takes this holier than thou approach like &#39;I&#39;m a team player&#39; blah blah blah. Everyone else is on her side? What the f*** is wrong with people? She clearly self eliminated Trey and everyone should have rolled on her until she was out.&#34; Ashley&#39;s decision to get Trey to give up his life in the game while trying to portray herself as a team player has Squid Game: The Challenge fans in an uproar.





 

While Ashley&#39;s choices were questionable in the game, the rest of the Squid Game: The Challenge contestants were angrier at another player for calling her out. Mai, player 287, spoke up after Ashley decided to go out of her way to choose herself over the team. As the only player who had the guts to speak up, the rest of the players weren&#39;t happy with Mai&#39;s decision to open her mouth about Ashley&#39;s behavior. Angry, they chose to be upset with Mai rather than agreeing that Ashley&#39;s choice wasn&#39;t a compassionate one. The mob mentality of the players on Squid Game: The Challenge has been fascinating to watch unfold.

With just a few players left on Squid Game: The Challenge after episode 9, the competition is down to the wire and every single action is important. Though some may have seen Ashley&#39;s decision as an act of self-preservation, most saw it as a destructive, unnecessary moment of weakness from a player who was doing anything they could to tear down someone else. With just one more episode of Squid Game: The Challenge to go, it&#39;s truly anyone&#39;s guess who will emerge the winner of the most complicated game Netflix has ever produced.
