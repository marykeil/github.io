# David Tennant s Regeneration Finally Completed Doctor Who s Toymaker Plan From 57 Years Ago


## SUMMARY 



  The final episode of Doctor Who&#39;s 60th anniversary special brings back the Toymaker villain, a character who hasn&#39;t appeared since 1966.   In a twist, the Doctor regenerates while facing the Toymaker, introducing Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor alongside David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor.   This regeneration fulfills a long-ago plan, as original producer John Wiles once considered having William Hartnell regenerate during a Toymaker episode.

## Literature Review
The Fourteenth Doctorâ€™s regeneration during The Giggle is a big deal for many reasons, including that the show tried to make it happen way earlier. 




In the final episode of the Doctor Who 60th anniversary special, &#34;The Giggle,&#34; David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor regenerates into Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor, and this is not only important because it heralds in Doctor Who season 14, but also because this was a Doctor Who plan many years ago. In November and December 2023, Doctor Who released three special episodes in honor of the show&#39;s 60th anniversary. The episodes followed the Fourteenth Doctor, played by David Tennant, and his companion, Donna Noble, played by Catherine Tate. Notably, in the third episode, &#34;The Giggle,&#34; the Doctor and Donna go up against Neil Patrick Harris&#39; the Toymaker.




The events of &#34;The Giggle&#34; are exciting for Doctor Who for a variety of reasons. For one thing, Doctor Who&#39;s villain, the Toymaker, has not appeared in the series since the 1966 episode, &#34;The Celestial Toymaker.&#34; Therefore, his return in the 60th anniversary special is monumental. Furthermore, when the Doctor faces off with the Toymaker, he bi-generates. This means that for the first time ever, two Doctors existed at once: David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor and Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor. But above all, &#34;The Giggle&#34; was exciting because it enacted a Doctor Who plan from many decades ago.


 Doctor Who Originally Intended William Hartnell To Regenerate While Facing The Toymaker 
         

Although the Fourteenth Doctor&#39;s regeneration while fighting against the Toymaker may seem like a novel and exciting concept, as it turns out, the series had a plan for the same thing to happen to another Doctor entirely and in a completely different time. And more than that, the Doctor&#39;s regeneration had an entirely different motive. In the 1960s, Doctor Who producer Verity Lambert passed over her responsibilities to newcomer John Wiles. Though Doctor Who had always been deemed as something of a childrens&#39; show, Wiles wanted to push the series in a new direction that would be more adult and sophisticated. William Hartnell, the Doctor at the time, disagreed.






William Hartnell was the first actor to play the Doctor on Doctor Who. He held the role from 1963 to 1966.




Ultimately, Wiles and Hartnell&#39;s disagreement became so intense that Wiles considered regenerating the Doctor during the first Toymaker episode, &#34;The Celestial Toymaker.&#34; This way, William Hartnell would no longer be the Doctor, and a new actor could be brought in that agreed with Wiles&#39; views. However, as we know now, this regeneration never actually happened. Hartnell maintained his role as the Doctor for a time, but resigned shortly after, and was followed by Patrick Troughton. John Wiles also left Doctor Who during the same era.



 57 Years Later, A Doctor Finally Regenerated In A Toymaker Episode 
          




Despite the fact that John Wiles&#39; plan to regenerate the Doctor during a Toymaker episode did not happen as he wanted it to, the Doctor did eventually regenerate during a Toymaker episode. Instead of William Hartnell regenerating during &#34;The Celestial Toymaker,&#34; David Tennant regenerated during &#34;The Giggle,&#34; 57 years later. While these two situations obviously share the same outcome, regeneration, the motives behind them were clearly very different. While Wiles simply wanted to get rid of Hartnell due to creative differences, Russell T. Davies likely wanted to end the 60th anniversary special with a splash.

Aside from having a better motive, Russell T. Davies Toymaker regeneration is better than John Wiles&#39; because it also includes the bi-generation. While it is cool enough to have the Doctor regenerate in the midst of an intense conflict, it is even better to add a new element like bi-generation. In this way, audiences got to see the Doctor regenerate, but also, got to see two great actors play the same character side-by-side. All in all, it was an exciting opportunity that definitely made Doctor Who&#39;s 60th anniversary extra special. On the other hand, Wiles&#39; regeneration likely would have been much more bitter and inexplicable.






 Doctor Who Coming Full Circle Shows Season 14 Really Is A New Era 
          

Ultimately, the fact that David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor regenerated in a Toymaker episode, and more than that, bi-generated, is proof that Doctor Who is coming up on a new era. While the series has definitely made some important steps forward in recent years by casting the first female Doctor, there is definitely more revamping that the show could stand to do. However, by adding new elements like bi-generation, Russell T. Davies is proving that Doctor Who season 14 will not be like other seasons of the series. Things are changing, and for the most part, it is for the best.
