: The Amazon, the series&#39; sixth season, aired in 2003. It was the first season to divide the starting tribes by gender. It feels more exciting and less stale than earlier seasons. While gender stereotypes are at play, the season manages to avoid some of the most obvious tropes and includes top-notch gameplay sure to thrill new viewers.





 9  Survivor: Millennials Vs. Gen X 
Survivor Season 33


 







Season 33, Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X, divided contestants by age for an adventure that fans say started out rocky but quickly become a much more breezy affair thanks to its fun characters and interesting twists. It includes one of Survivor&#39;s best storylines. Contestants were kind to each other and will be a great watch for new viewers due to captivating cast members and plots.





 8  Survivor: Panama — Exile Island 
Survivor Season 12


 







Survivor: Panama, the 12th season of the series, is hilarious, which makes it a great choice for new viewers. The characters are comedic together, which creates some of Survivor&#39;s greatest comedic moments and some of its tensest drama. It&#39;s well-rounded with lighthearted moments and focuses on the show&#39;s entertainment factor rather than strategic gameplay, which may appeal to less-seasoned fans.





 7  Survivor: Kaôh Rōng — Brains Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty 
Survivor Season 32
        

Season 32, Survivor: Kaôh Rōng, is a go-to recommendation for those beginning their Survivor journey. Its brutal setting gives contestants a tougher environment that forces them to actually survive, an essential element that newer seasons tend to focus on less than in the show&#39;s early years. The season also leans heavily on its strong cast, as everyone is engaging and deserving. There are epic storylines throughout sure to hook any new viewer on the series.





 6  Survivor: Borneo 
Survivor Season 1


 







It would be impossible to suggest good starting points for a Survivor binge without including Survivor season 1: Borneo. For fans who prefer to do their binge-watching in chronological order, this is the obvious choice, but there are other good reasons to include the season. It remains the best cast that has ever been assembled on the show and sets the tone for the entire Survivor universe.





 5  Survivor: Cagayan — Brains Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty 
Survivor Season 28
        

Season 28, Cagayan, is a great entry in Survivor&#39;s &#34;new school&#34; era. Like many great Survivor seasons, it doesn&#39;t feature any returning competitors, meaning first-time viewers can discover how the game functions along with the players. Some incredibly iconic players make their debut on this season and it&#39;s a straightforward introduction to the hit reality TV series.





 4  Survivor: David Vs. Goliath 
Survivor Season 37
        

Survivor: David vs. Goliath, season 37, is another great season to begin with. The season doesn&#39;t overwhelm viewers with confusing twists, it features dynamic gameplay, and it has a likable cast of players who are easy to root for. In a way, it&#39;s a textbook example of the long-running series, with everything from engaging characters to impactful storytelling.





 3  Survivor: Tocantins 
Survivor Season 18
        

Season 18, Survivor: Tocantins, is a great choice for new viewers because of its memorable characters and for avoidance of overly complicated strategy elements compared to the rest of Survivor. This engaging season is very difficult to predict due to the contestants constantly having problems with creating alliances and implementing strategies. It also introduces a few villain characters who have become mainstays in the Survivor franchise.





 2  Survivor: China 
Survivor Season 15
        

Season 15, Survivor: China, is a blend of different styles and eras of Survivor. What results is an engaging season with a strong backbone and contestants who are fun to watch. It becomes easy for new viewers to get into this season because it doesn&#39;t overemphasize the more complex elements of the game. Every cast member serves a purpose and there aren&#39;t any stragglers who don&#39;t contribute to the plot. However, it may be wise to watch this season after Survivor: Pearl Islands, as it spoils an incredible twist from that season that ranks among the most iconic moments in Survivor history.





 1  Survivor: Pearl Islands 
Survivor Season 7
        

Survivor: Pearl Islands is the most fundamentally perfect season of Survivor, with contestants going to extreme lengths to win a million dollars. Featured early on in the franchise&#39;s run as one of the best reality TV series of all time, the season introduced series icons and included a groundbreaking, shocking twist. The only reason not to begin with Survivor season 7 is because it&#39;s all downhill from there, even with 44 other seasons to choose from.
               Survivor   Cast:   Jeff Probst    Release Date:   2000-05-31    Seasons:   44    Genres:   Reality    Summary:   In this long-running reality competition show, sixteen people are split into two tribes and must survive off the land in various rural locales. Each week, they compete in challenges for resources, luxuries, or immunity — and each week, one person is voted out by their teammates, losing their chance at being the sole Survivor.
