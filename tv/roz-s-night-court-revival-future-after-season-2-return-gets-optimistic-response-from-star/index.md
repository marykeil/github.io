# Roz s Night Court Revival Future After Season 2 Return Gets Optimistic Response From Star


## SUMMARY 



  Marsha Warfield is open to returning as Roz on Night Court if asked, as she says the door has never really closed.   Warfield&#39;s recent appearance in Night Court season 2 was only meant to be a single-episode cameo.   The Night Court revival has brought back another original cast member: John Larroquette in a main role.

## Literature Review
Marsha Warfield optimistically weighs in on whether she&#39;ll reprise her role as Roz Russell again after her Night Court season 2 premiere cameo.




Night Court star Marsha Warfield has discussed the possible future return of Roz Russell. Warfield originated the character, a stern bailiff who works the night shift at the Manhattan Criminal Court, on the original long-running sitcom, which ran between 1984 and 1992. She appeared in a total of 136 episodes between seasons 4 and 9, becoming the show&#39;s sixth longest-running character. Russell later made a surprise return as Roz in the ongoing Night Court revival during the season 1 finale in 2023, as well as the recent season 2 premiere.




TVInsider recently conducted an interview with Warfield to discuss her appearance in Night Court season 2. When asked if she is going to return in future episodes, she revealed that she was only meant to return for a single season 2 episode. However, she said that &#34;If they ask me, I’ll serve,&#34; and &#34;The door’s never really closed.&#34; Read her full quote below:


If they ask me, I’ll serve. The door’s never really closed, but I think we left it open enough to where it wouldn’t be strange if Roz did come back.



 Will Roz Return To Night Court? 
          

There are only 11 Night Court season 2 episodes left due to a shortened order. This means that, if Roz was meant to return this season, it&#39;s likely that Warfield would have already been informed given the necessary production schedule. However, this does not rule out her possible appearance in season 3, should the show be renewed by NBC for the 2024-2025 season.






While many shows have received shortened episode orders in the wake of the 2023 writers and actors strikes, Night Court season 1 only had 16 episodes, so season 2 isn&#39;t significantly shorter.




In fact, Warfield making a statement similar to her recent quote is likely what got her a cameo in the new Night Court cast in the first place. Back when season 1 premiered in 2023, she shared a video message on TikTok expressing her excitement for the show and saying, &#34;I hope you have as much fun this time around.&#34; At the time, it did not seem that she knew she would be participating in the show just 15 episodes later.

The Night Court revival has already proven its willingness to honor legacy characters. This has included the return of John Laroquette, the lead character being the daughter of the original show&#39;s Judge Harry Stone, and, naturally, Warfield&#39;s two-episode stint across two seasons. Given this precedent, it seems entirely likely that Roz could make yet another return.
