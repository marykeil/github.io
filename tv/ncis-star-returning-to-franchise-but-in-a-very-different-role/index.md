## Literature Review
A veteran NCIS alum is making her way back to the hit CBS franchise very soon, although in a different capacity than the role that she’s known for.




NCIS alum Daniela Ruah is returning to the franchise, although in a different capacity than her long-running NCIS: Los Angeles role. Ruah portrayed Kensi Byle for all 15 seasons, saying farewell to the character once the LA-set spinoff concluded in May 2023. But she&#39;s coming back to the network-defining CBS franchise, contributing to two NCIS shows.




According to Deadline, Ruah is directing two episodes of the NCIS franchise. She’ll be helming an episode of NCIS season 21, which will premiere in February. That will be followed by an episode of NCIS: Hawai’i season 3, which debuts in April. Ruah made her directorial debut with NCIS: Los Angeles season 12 and has directed six episodes of the spinoff, in addition to an episode of the miniseries Contado por Mulheres. Read her comments about the new opportunity, below:


“Kensi was born as a character on NCIS, 15 years ago, so now to be able to step onto that set again, as a director, with that incredible cast and crew, is an absolute honor. So many familiar faces and people I love and they’ve welcomed me with open arms. It’s like coming home.”




NCIS season 21 debuts Monday, February 12 at 9 PM ET on CBS, with NCIS: Hawai’i season 3 following at 10 PM ET.








 Could Daniela Ruah&#39;s Kensi Return To The NCIS Franchise? 
          

In the NCIS: LA series finale, it was revealed that Kensi and Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen) have a baby on the way. There is nothing definitive about what happens to the pair beyond that. Given that LL Cool J&#39;s Sam Hannah will be recurring in NCIS: Hawai’i season 3, following an unannounced season 2 finale cameo, it opens the door for other NCIS alums to make appearances.

Ruah has addressed returning to NCIS in the past. Discussing the possibility in July 2023, the actor struck an optimistic tone. The Los Angeles vet indicated that she would be open to reprising her role in the right circumstances and if she&#39;s asked to do so. Based on her latest statement, though, Ruah is focused on stepping into the director&#39;s chair. But given her close ties to the CBS franchise, there are positive signs that Kensi could show up as a guest character.




NCIS: Los Angeles has a long legacy. Concluding with 323 episodes, the NCIS spinoff built up a loyal audience. The decision to end the series was reportedly financially motivated by CBS, taking into account the drama&#39;s significant price tag as the show tended to cost more the longer it continued. Still, between LL Cool J&#39;s recurring role and Ruah&#39;s directorial duties, the LA ensemble are still linked to the overall franchise.
