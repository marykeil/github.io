## Literature Review
The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All still has two parts left, with time for the couples to shock fans with unexpected twists. 




Part 1 of the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All was full of shocking moments, and the upcoming Part 2 and Part 3 will be no different. The 2023 edition of the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off had a total of 21 episodes, which is the longest any season of the show has ever had. Seven couples were featured, with two returning pairs, so fans were already somewhat familiar with their storylines. 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 premiered in July 2023, and as it inches closer to the finale, it was not hard to see that most of the couples had not made it to the end.




Daniele Gates and Yohan Geronimo had broken up before the last episode, while Holly Weeks was sure she couldn’t spend more time with Wayne Cornish in South Africa. Julio Moya had already broken up with Kirsten Schoemaker before the season finale, and Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay are having marital issues post-show. Kimberly Rochelle and Tejaswi &#34;TJ&#34; Goswami have also been living in different countries since September 2022. It appears the only couples still together are Shekinah Garner and Sarper Güven and Kenneth “Kenny” Niedermeier and Armando Rubio.

 After Julio, Kirsten Accuses Him Of Cheating On Her 
          




Julio and Kirsten came face to face after their break-up for the first time at the Tell All. Julio revealed there was more to the split than him deciding not to leave his family. He mentioned that “trust issues&#34; were the reason behind the decision. Julio accused Kirsten of cheating on him in Part 1, but in Part 2, Kirsten accused him of infidelity. The preview shows Julio acting bitter about Kirsten not introducing him to the “good friend” he thought she was having an affair with. “She was like, I blocked him,” he says.

Julio insists that the “real reason” for their break-up was the trust issues he was having because of that situation. However, Kirsten says, “No, it’s not the real reason.” Kirsten says she believes Julio found another woman. “That ***** her name,” she alleges. Kirsten will be accusing Julio of cheating on her with a woman he met while they were in a relationship. “Why are you lying? You’re such a liar,” Kirsten says with tears in her eyes, as everyone else around her is shocked.






 Holly Runs Away From The Tell-All Stage 
         

During Part 1, Holly revealed she&#39;s been back in the U.S. for four months. Wayne complained he’d lost contact with Holly and called the situation “strange.” In the upcoming episode, Holly will reveal that she and Wayne hadn’t spoken in two to three weeks when they filmed the Tell-All. Wayne tells the audience that he doesn’t feel there’s a “connection” between him and Holly like before. Wayne admits that he felt abandoned by his wife and suggests he is considering ending his relationship. Holly runs away from the set, crying after hearing what her husband said of their relationship. 



 Brandan Accuses Mary Of Being A Scammer 
          




Brandan and Mary’s storyline wasn’t discussed during Part 1, but the upcoming episodes give a look inside their relationship after getting married in the finale. Host Shaun Robinson asks Brandan what he’s like when he gets mad. Brandan admits he calls Mary a scammer and a “b***h” when he’s mad at her. Shaun turns to Brandan’s mom, Angela, to ask what Mary could have possibly done for Brandan to call her these names. “Do you guys want to talk about the last incident?” Angela asks Brandan and Mary. 



 Andrei Castravet Tells Shekinah To “F*** Off” 

 

The most surprising, yet interesting, moment from the Tell All hasn&#39;t aired. It’s the trailer for the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 reunion, which shows Andrei Castravet and Shekinah getting into an argument. Shekinah asks Andrei if he’s “seriously” confronting her. When he says, “Yes,” and claims Shekinah said he was the “most toxic” person in the room. Shekinah tries to ignore Andrei and asks him to sit down and “get out&#34; of her face. Andrei&#39;s clearly annoyed with Shekinah telling him what to do and tells her to “f**k off” while she calls him a “d**k.”
