## Literature Review

The Netflix adaptation of Boy Swallows Universe is a fairly close retelling of the popular Australian novel by Trent Dalton with some key differences.

 There are several differences between the series and the book, including the portrayal of Teddy&#39;s violence, the level of optimism in Eli&#39;s character, and the ending, which is more focused on exposing Tytus in the series but is broader in the novel. 


The Netflix series Boy Swallows Universe differs in a few minor ways from the celebrated novel of the same name written by Trent Dalton. Dalton wrote Boy Swallows Universe as a semi-autobiographical account of his childhood in 1980s Brisbane, combining real-life events with magical realism and a wide web of gritty underground corruption. Boy Swallows Universe was adapted for the screen by John Collee (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) and was brought to Netflix by Australian actor, director, and producer Joel Edgerton.
Boy Swallows Universe includes a phenomenal cast led by Felix Cameron as the protagonist and Dalton&#39;s alter-ego Eli Bell, who is portrayed by Zac Burgess as an older teenager in the last two episodes. Boy Swallows Universe was adapted into a seven-part miniseries from a book with over 450 pages. Critics and viewers alike have commended the series for its close representation of not only the events but the emotions of the original work as well. Other significant cast members include Phoebe Tonkin as Frances Bell, Lee Tiger Hailey as Gus Bell, and Simon Baker as Robert Bell.

 10  Boy Swallows Universe Novel Doesn’t Start With Kroll Scene 
Netflix series opens with a flash-forward teaser
        

The Netflix adaption of Boy Swallows Universe begins with an intense scene that introduces Eli, Gus, Frances, Lyle, and one of the main antagonists, Ivan Kroll. While the scene is intensely gripping and immediately entices the audience into the world of the story, the book opens on a much less action-packed note with Eli contemplating Gus&#39;s cautionary words, &#34;Your end is a dead blue wren&#34;. The Kroll scene does happen in the book but at a later time in the narrative.





 9  Tytus Broz Orders Kroll To Cut Eli’s Finger Off In The Book 
Tytus was at Lyle&#39;s house with Kroll to collect Lyle
        

Another major difference between the Boy Swallows Universe series and the book regarding that scene is the fact that Tytus Broz was also there in the novel. In the series, Broz&#39;s working relationship with Ivan Kroll is not officially discovered until later in the series when Caitlyn Spies (Sophie Wilde) finds financial information linking the two men. In the book, however, Tytus is present at Lyle&#39;s house when Kroll and his henchmen take him away and is the person who tells Kroll to cut off part of Eli&#39;s finger.





 8  Boy Swallows Universe’s Tone Is Heavier In The Book 
Boy Swallows Universe series has more coming-of-age elements
        

The Boy Swallows Universe Netflix adaptation offers a unique blend of coming-of-age sentimentality and gory, frightening action sequences. The television series leans more into the young adult tropes than Dalton&#39;s novel does which arguably enhances the overall narrative. Dalton&#39;s book carries an overall bleaker tone than the Netflix series, which works hard to still include some of the more innocent moments of Eli&#39;s adolescence despite being inescapably surrounded by broken and corrupt people.





 7  Teddy Is Much More Abusive In Boy Swallows Universe Novel 
Teddy assaults Frankie to a higher degree in the book
        

Teddy proves to be one of the most despicable and pathetic characters in Boy Meets Universe, and his portrayal in the Netflix series as an entitled and abusive coward is pretty spot on with his characterization in Calton&#39;s book. One major difference, however, is the extent of Teddy&#39;s violence between the series and the semi-autobiographical novel. While Teddy is clearly physically abusive to Frankie in the Netflix series by hitting and pushing her around, he actually knocks some of Frankie&#39;s teeth out in the novel, a viciousness that isn&#39;t captured onscreen.

 6  Eli Is More Optimistic In Boy Swallows Universe Netflix Series 
Eli feels more emotionally complex and nuanced in the book
        

Eli&#39;s charismatic drive and unyielding sense of optimism are the core aspects of his character and the clear links between the younger and older versions of himself in the Boy Swallows Universe series. From playing peacemaker in a street fight between rival gangs to convincing Raymond Leary to open up about his connection to Tytus and Kroll, Eli&#39;s inspirational spirit is undefeatable in the Netflix series. In Dalton&#39;s novel, Eli does carry the same optimism but he is also given more realistic elements of his character that ultimately make him more of a complex protagonist.





 5  The Boy Swallows Universe Finale Is Longer In The Book 
The book&#39;s ending also features a bigger role for Caitlyn
        

The ending of Boy Swallows Universe unfolds rather drastically in the Netflix television adaptation, whereas it is much broader in the Dalton novel. The ending in the series is acutely focused on Caitlyn and Eli&#39;s objective of exposing Tytus once and for all and leaves out some of the other supporting elements such as the aftermath of Eli&#39;s hospitalization. Caitlyn and Eli continue their investigation after Tytus is exposed in the book. There is also an additional scene with the red phone that is somewhat confusingly included at the end of the Netflix series in a dream sequence.





 4  There Are Many More Chapters In Boy Swallows Universe Book 
Boy Swallows Universe series only has seven chapters
        

The Boy Swallows Universe Netflix series is broken into seven episodes and is given seven chapter titles as a result: Boy Smells Rat, Boy Gets Chop, Run Boy Run, Boy Loses Dad, Boy Takes Flight, Boy Seeks Work, and Boy Meets End. The chapters in the novel are much shorter than the hour-long episodes, which would approximately equal 50–60 pages each. Some of the book chapter titles not included in the series are: Boy Writes Words, Boy Follows Footsteps, Boy Makes Rainbow, Boy Kills Bull, and Boy Loses Luck.

 3  Boy Swallows Universe Book Is Told Only Through Eli’s Perspective 
The Netflix series offers more scenes without Eli&#39;s direct involvement
        

While Dalton&#39;s novel is only told through the first-person perspective of Eli Bell, the Netflix series does a good job of including other character perspectives and scenes that do not always include Eli&#39;s direct involvement. This change is mostly due to the requirements of a well-balanced story in the screenplay format and allows the viewer to discover some things about the plots and characters that aren&#39;t necessarily known to Eli, which ultimately creates a more intricate narrative.





 2  Eli Doesn’t Charge Onto The Stage With Lyle’s Head In The Book 
Eli also discovers his finger in Tytus Broz&#39;s research facility
        

One of the biggest plot deviations from Dalton&#39;s novel in the Netflix series is the method in which Eli exposes Tytus at the Queensland Champions ceremony using Lyle&#39;s preserved head. In the book, Gus and Eli replace a mechanical limb that Tytus planned to showcase to the audience with Lyle&#39;s head, which is arguably a more clever way of exposing Tytus. Eli also finds his severed finger in Broz&#39;s secret laboratory in the book but not in the series.





 1  Gus Doesn’t Save Eli At The End Of Boy Swallows Universe Novel 
Eli defeats Kroll on the clock tower by himself in the novel


 







Another major narrative shift in Boy Swallows Universe is how Kroll is defeated in the final act. In the book, Eli is able to defeat Kroll himself in the clock tower by smashing the glass case with his severed finger in it on Kroll&#39;s head, which knocks him unconscious. This obviously differs from Gus saving Eli&#39;s life at the final moment and pushing Kroll to his brutal death hundreds of feet below. While there are some significant differences between the Boy Swallows Universe novel and the Netflix series, particularly in the end, both are celebrated for their outstanding quality.
