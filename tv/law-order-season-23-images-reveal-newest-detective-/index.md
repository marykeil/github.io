## Literature Review
New images from Law &amp; Order season 23 reveal the show&#39;s newest detective on the force, portrayed by veteran television actor Reid Scott.




New photos from Law &amp; Order season 23 have revealed the newest detective to join the series, portrayed by TV actor Reid Scott. Season 22 saw the departure of Jeffrey Donovan, who had been on the series as Detective Frank Cosgrove since its revival in season 21. Given the revolving cast Law &amp; Order has gone through since the start, it was inevitable someone else would join to fill his spot.




Now, TVLine has revealed images of Scott as Law &amp; Order season 23 newcomer Detective Vincent Riley. The first look shows the former Veep star sitting at his desk and working outside, as well as posing for a shot of his character. Check out the images of Scott in his new role below:

         


 Everything To Expect From Law &amp; Order Season 23 
          

Riley was recruited by Lieutenant Kate Dixon, indicating the pair know each other from past events. While there will be very little in the way of an overarching storyline due to a weekly case format, this new character introduction could still play with the team&#39;s dynamics. In addition, the series may deliver some shocking information for each new case, making them uniquely engaging.




As Scott joins the series, multiple familiar actors are set to reprise their roles from previous seasons. This includes Sam Waterston as District Attorney Jack McCoy, Mehcad Brooks as Detective Jalen Shaw, and Camryn Manheim as Lieutenant Kate Dixon. There will likely also be guest stars during Law &amp; Order crossover episodes, featuring big cases multiple teams will need to tackle.

Scott joining Law &amp; Order signals new dynamics within the team as a whole, something that could make case presentations different moving forward. However, given his appearances on TV throughout his career, it&#39;s clear he will be a welcome addition to the series. More information about his introduction and his relationship to Dixon will likely be revealed when the series returns.






Law &amp; Order is set to return to NBC on January 18, 2024, alongside its two spinoffs, Law &amp; Order: SVU and Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime.
