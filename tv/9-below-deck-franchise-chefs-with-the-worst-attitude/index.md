## Literature Review

The Below Deck franchise has had several chefs on board and many of them didn&#39;t have the best attitude. Here are the chefs with the worst ones. 




Over the years, many chefs who&#39;ve appeared in the Below Deck franchise didn&#39;t have the best attitudes on board. If the popular Bravo franchise taught its fans anything, it&#39;s that chefs can be quite unpredictable and sometimes even mean. There have been one too many instances where a chef was mean to one of the stewards for not bringing their food to the charter guests while it was hot or would act differently depending on the day. Despite their unpredictability, the chefs in the Below Deck franchise have become some of the most memorable cast members.
Chef Ben Robinson from Below Deck and Below Deck Mediterranean is one of the more well-known chefs from the franchise. While he did have an attitude on board sometimes, he was pretty mild compared to other chefs who&#39;ve been on the show. Also, Chef Ben is one of the best chefs the franchise has ever had, and fans still talk about him today. Other chefs, like Chef Marcos Spazini from Below Deck Sailing Yacht and Tzarina Mace-Ralph from Below Deck Down Under, had a few unhinged moments but still had good attitudes on board overall. However, several of them didn&#39;t have the best attitudes throughout their seasons.

 9  Chef Dave White 
Below Deck Mediterranean Season 7
        

Chef Dave White from Below Deck Med season 7 had a bad attitude on board for reasons not even related to him as a chef. Before his time on board, Dave had a secret romance with Chief Stew Natasha Webb. The pair kept their relationship under wraps for as long as they could until Dave snapped after Natasha wasn&#39;t giving him the attention he wanted. Plus, Natasha was still in contact with her ex-boyfriend and even got back together with him while on the yacht. Dave was so terrible to Natasha the whole time because of their situation, but he eventually apologized for his actions.





 8  Chef Jess Condy 
Below Deck Adventure Season 1
       Below Deck Adventure&#39;s Chef Jess Condy  

During her time on Below Deck Adventure season 1, Chef Jess Condy had a pretty tame attitude until closer to the end of the season. What caused Chef Jess to develop a bad attitude was her feud with Chief Stew Faye Clarke. Faye felt like Jess was trying to intimidate her while in the galley and didn&#39;t appreciate her overall rude demeanor. She immediately went to Captain Kerry Titheradge regarding the issue, and the two were, thankfully, able to get past their differences.





 7  Chef Kevin Dobson 
Below Deck Season 7
        

Chef Kevin Dobson&#39;s bad attitude began when he started feuding with Chief Stew Kate Chastain during Below Deck season 7. Their feud almost began immediately, as Kevin didn&#39;t feel Kate had what it took to create a dinner service up to his standards. Kevin even called out stew Simone Mashile for her uninspiring dinner service. Not only did Chef Kevin call out the stews, but he even insulted Captain Lee Robach twice in one night. Any time Kevin was called out about these shortcomings, including the quality of his food, he would act out with a bad attitude.





 6  Chef Tom Checketts 
Below Deck Mediterranean Season 5
        

Chef Tom Checketts&#39;s true colors came to light early on in Below Deck Med season 5. Tom immediately showed signs of diva behavior from the moment he stepped on board. Not only was he rude to his then-girlfriend and the person who got him the job, Malia White, but he was also mean to the other crew members on board.
Tom even yelled at Aesha Scott for simply cutting a cucumber wrong. He even threw a tantrum in front of Malia after a provision delivery went wrong, and he was trying to prepare for the next charter. Tom&#39;s claim to fame on Below Deck Med season 5 was being a diva in the galley.





 5  Chef Rachel Hargrove 
Below Deck Seasons 8-10


 







Even though Chef Rachel Hargrove is one of the best chefs to ever appear in the Below Deck franchise, she often acted out whenever something didn&#39;t go her way. Rachel, who appeared in Below Deck seasons 8-10, even monetarily left the yacht during season 8 after the guest&#39;s dinner menus were too much for her to handle. Despite some of her comedic relief throughout her seasons, Rachel often had a bad attitude when it came to doing what the guests wanted.





 4  Chef Mathew Shea 
Below Deck Mediterranean Season 6
        

Chef Mathew Shea caused quite a few issues throughout his time on Below Deck Med season 6. From the moment he stepped on board, he was causing trouble. He complained about standing after a knee injury that caused him to miss out on the first charter. His absence forced the rest of the crew to scramble and really pull together so the charter guests could still have a great time. Despite what they did for him, Chef Mathew continued to complain throughout the season, showing his terrible attitude.





 3  Chef Leon Walker 
Below Deck Season 3
        

Chef Leon Walker from Below Deck season 3 had one of the worst attitudes in franchise history. Not only did he put down Kate anytime she brought up a real issue with him, but he even spoke poorly to Captain Lee. One time, Chef Leon even started a fire in the galley after not cleaning the oven properly but still managed to blame Kate for it. Leon&#39;s bad attitude eventually got him fired and replaced by Chef Ben.





 2  Chef Adam Glick 
Below Deck Mediterranean Season 2-3 &amp; Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 1


 







Chef Adam Glick&#39;s time in the Below Deck franchise overall wasn&#39;t a great look for him. During his first season, Below Deck Med season 2, Chef Adam showed his bad attitude when Malia didn&#39;t reciprocate romantic feelings for him; Malia decided to continue a relationship with Bosun Wesley Walton. Other than his relationship issues with Malia, Adam would often become passive-aggressive in the galley. In Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 1, Chef Adam was often tough on stew Madison Stalker for no reason at all. Chef Adam&#39;s bad attitude was likely the last straw for him to return to the franchise for a fourth time.





 1  Chef Ryan Mckeown 
Below Deck Down Under Season 1
        

Chef Ryan Mckeown from Below Deck Down Under season 1 was one of the most disrespectful chefs to ever appear in the Below Deck franchise. Not only did Chef Ryan treat the stews, including Chief Stew Aesha, as if they were beneath him, but he would attack anyone who tried to put down his less-than-appetizing food. Any sort of constructive criticism Ryan received was met with a bad attitude from him, even if it was Captain Jason Chambers offering the advice. Nonetheless, Ryan&#39;s terrible attitude means he likely won&#39;t be returning to a Below Deck series again.
Below Deck season 11 premieres on February 5 at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
