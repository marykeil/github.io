## Literature Review
AppleTV&#43; renews one of their longest running shows for a season 5, as the spy drama Slow Horses also anticipates its upcoming season 4.




Slow Horses season 5 is renewed by Apple TV&#43; before season 4 even debuts. Based on the Slough House novels by Mick Herron, with writer Will Smith adapting the story for television, the spy thriller reveals what administrative purgatory is like for those who&#39;ve been rejected or downgraded from MI5. It centers around Slough House, where the downgraded agents are expected to do dull tasks under the supervision of experienced intelligence officer Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman). However, they always tend to end up investigating far more serious threats. The cast also includes Jack Lowden, Kristin Scott Thomas, Saskia Reeves, Rosalind Eleazar, and Christopher Chung.




While Slow Horses season 4 is still in development, Variety confirms that AppleTV&#43; renewed the show for season 5. This earns the spy dramedy the distinction of being the longest-running Apple TV&#43; scripted series, though The Morning Show and For All Mankind could match it if they also get renewed in the coming months. Based on the logline, Slow Horses season 5 is confirmed to adapt the novel London Rules.


 What Does The Popularity Of Slow Horses Reveal? 
          

A common refrain about streaming services is that shows are too often canceled without getting the chance to develop an audience. Even in the case of Apple TV&#43;, with its smaller catalog of originals, the streamer canceled several comedies and dramas in 2023, such as City on Fire and Dear Edward. However, the trajectory of Slow Horses shows what can still be accomplished with the right casting, writing, and a little bit of patience.




Apple TV&#43; has cited Slow Horses as one of its most popular shows, with recent reports noting that the adaptation is on its way to becoming the streamer&#39;s most popular title in the U.K., growing 65% compared to Slow Horses season 2. This would not have been possible if not for the fact that Apple consistently renewed the series, allowing for positive word-of-mouth to accumulate.

It also helps that the show is a relatively light spy thriller that is easy to get behind, working as both an anthology that deals with a new case each season but bringing back most of the same characters and giving space for personal bonds to build. That will continue with Slow Horses season 5, which will see everyone&#39;s suspicions raised when Roddy (Chung) gets a glamorous new girlfriend. Bizarre events begin to unfold across the city, and it&#39;s up to the Slough House team to figure things out.
