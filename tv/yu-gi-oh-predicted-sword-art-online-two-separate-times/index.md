# Yu-Gi-Oh! Predicted Sword Art Online Two Separate Times


## SUMMARY 



  Sword Art Online and Yu-Gi-Oh! both feature protagonists trapped in virtual reality games, but they have major differences in genres, themes, and presentation.   Both series showcase the characters&#39; exceptional gaming skills, but Yu-Gi-Oh! ties it to Duel Monsters while Sword Art Online focuses on mastering various virtual reality games.   Despite similarities, Sword Art Online took the premise in a unique direction, making it distinct from Yu-Gi-Oh! and highlighting how ideas can originate from unexpected sources.

## Literature Review
Many anime have imitated Sword Art Online&#39;s virtual world concept, but Yu-Gi-Oh! actually predicted this trend with two arcs in its first series.




Sword Art Online is a landmark franchise that spawned an entire genre of anime, but it was actually predicted by Yu-Gi-Oh! on two separate occasions. Of course Yu-Gi-Oh! isn&#39;t the only anime to have played with its concepts beforehand. However, it is shocking that the series would have predicted it in this way given the two shows are in entirely different genres.




Sword Art Online is a series following Kirito, a gamer who gets trapped in a virtual reality game and must battle his way through in order to escape. As the series progresses, he plays other virtual reality games as well, and in each one manages to master the game he plays and complete whatever goal is set up for him. This premise inspired many other shows to copy this idea, with a myriad of other similar series proliferating in the years since Sword Art Online premiered. However, before that series became so popular, Yu-Gi-Oh! actually featured the idea of traveling into a virtual world as well.


 Yu-Gi-Oh! Featured Virtual Reality Arcs Long Before Sword Art Online 
          

Between the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City arcs, there was a strange storyline that featured Yugi and his friends entering a virtual reality game to rescue Kaiba, who had been trapped within it. Later right before the finals of the Battle City tournament, Yugi and his friends were again trapped in a Virtual Reality game, this time by Kaiba&#39;s digitized stepbrother. This arc also let Kaiba overcome his trauma in a brilliant way. Both of these arcs of course had some major differences with Sword Art Online as the nature of the games was very different and Yu-Gi-Oh! didn&#39;t present these storylines as a power fantasy. But there are some major similarities as well.




The most obvious similarity is that both stories feature the protagonists trapped in a virtual reality video game. However, there are also more subtle similarities such as Yugi and Kirito both being preternaturally good at the games they are a part of (which in Yugi&#39;s case is due to the games being tied to Duel Monsters). In addition, the first virtual reality arc features different stages the characters must clear, much like the stages in the original Sword Art Online game. In addition, both Sword Art Online&#39;s first game and the first virtual world in Yu-Gi-Oh! have fantasy settings even if the worlds themselves aren&#39;t exactly the same.



Sword Art Online&#39;s later games are a bit more distinct than Yu-Gi-Oh!&#39;s virtual worlds.






 Despite Similarities, Sword Art Online Isn&#39;t a Yu-Gi-Oh! Rip-Off 
          




All this being said, this doesn&#39;t make Sword Art Online a rip-off of Yu-Gi-Oh! by any means. The later anime took the premise in a very different direction than its predecessor did and was also extremely different in themes and tone. However, it does show that many modern ideas can have their roots in the most unexpected places, given as a whole Sword Art Online and Yu-Gi-Oh! are quite different from each other.
