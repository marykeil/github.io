Lucasfilm confirms with celebratory tweet


Lucasfilm releases an official tweet celebrating Ahsoka season 2.







Lucasfilm has officially confirmed that Ahsoka season 2 is currently being developed by Dave Filoni, George Lucas&#39; protégé and Ahsoka Tano&#39;s co-creator. The Ahsoka Disney&#43; TV show was a hit for the streaming service, and played a crucial part in the developing plans around The Mandalorian era. It introduced Lars Mikkelsen as the live-action Grand Admiral Thrawn, the main villain of this part of the Star Wars timeline.

Lucasfilm has finally confirmed that Dave Filoni is now working on Ahsoka season 2.


 

This will presumably continue from Ahsoka season 1&#39;s ending, which saw Rosario Dawson&#39;s Ahsoka Tano and Natasha Liu Bordizzo&#39;s Sabine Wren stranded in a distant galaxy on the planet Peridea. Ahsoka season 2 will presumably be developed alongside The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, confirmed as the next Star Wars movie.




                  Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know   Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project.    


 What Should We Expect From Ahsoka Season 2? 
          

There&#39;s been speculation for months over Ahsoka season 2, with star Rosario Dawson recently claiming she&#39;d heard no news. It&#39;s exciting to finally have confirmation that this is in the works, and it will clearly play a major role in Lucasfilm&#39;s ongoing story. The end of Ahsoka season 1 revealed the mysterious planet Peridea is somehow tied to the Mortis gods, cosmic avatars who represent aspects of the Force.

Lucasfilm&#39;s comments suggest development is still in its earliest stages, though, meaning it&#39;s likely there won&#39;t be any further news for some time. Meanwhile, the story of this time period will continue in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, a movie that will bring Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin and his beloved apprentice Grogu to the big screen. It&#39;s possible characters like Grand Admiral Thrawn will be seen there before Ahsoka season 2.
