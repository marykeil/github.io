## Literature Review

The Sopranos was a show that was all about life and death. Some of the character deaths broke fans&#39; hearts, while others were quite welcome.




As expected with a series that dealt with the mob, there were many notable The Sopranos deaths that saw the main characters of the series taken out. The Sopranos was the show that turned HBO into must-watch TV long while also showing that there could be shows featuring complex, flawed and even evil characters as the protagonists. Indeed, Tony Soprano was someone who was not afraid to order the deaths of many people and kill with his own bare hands when pushed, he was also surrounded by violence with many associates and enemies dying in The Sopranos.
While there are many clues that Tony died in The Sopranos&#39; finale, it remains officially unconfirmed. However, there were plenty of other character who audiences got to know over the course of the seven seasons that did certainly die. Some of these were characters who fans loved and met heartbreaking ends. Some of them were characters fans loved to hate who received their comeuppance in satisfying ways. These deaths of The Sopranos main characters account for some of the show&#39;s most iconic moments and cemented its legacy on television.
            
 
 The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked 
The best TV shows of all time will be debated forever, but there are clear contenders. These are the very best TV shows of all time, ranked.



Watch On Max
Honorable Mention: Pie-O-My
        

Pie-O-My was a pretty unique death in the series as it was an animal. However, this beloved horse to whom Tony grew so attached ended up having a huge impact on him. Sadly, the innocent animal was one of the unfortunate victims to get wrapped up in the mob world. Despite Pie-O-My earning a lot of money for Ralphie, he ends up burning down the stable and the horse has to be killed due to its extensive injuries. Pie-O-My&#39;s death ends up being very significant as it ultimately causes Tony to kill Ralphie in anger.









 








 14  Billy Leotardo 
Played By Chris Caldovino
        

Billy Leotardo was a soldier working for his brother Phil, an influential boss in the crime family. Though he did not have a huge role in the series, he was a prime example of how one act can spiral into a violent series of repercussions in this world. Billy was by his father&#39;s side in the power struggle in which he murdered Angelo Garepe. In response, Angelo&#39;s friend, Tony Blundetto, kills Billy as he leaves a restaurant with his father. Not only did Billy&#39;s death ultimately lead to Blundetto&#39;s death, but it intensified the feud between Phil and Tony.





 13  Jackie Aprile Jr. 
Played By Jason Cerbone
        

The Aprile family caused a lot of problems in the series. However, Tony Soprano was shown to have a fondness for Jackie Jr. Tony took the young man under his wing and tried to steer him away from a life of crime, but it didn&#39;t work. Jackie attempted to make something of himself by robbing a mob card game, but that plan backfired terribly making for one of the worst decisions of The Sopranos. Despite Tony&#39;s previous affection for Jackie, he has Vito hunt him down in hiding and execute him.





 12  Johnny Sack 
Played By Vincent Curatola
        

In a world filled with so much violence, Johnny Sack left the show in a very unexpected way. As a well-respected member of the Lupertazzi crime family, Johnny was a cherished ally of Tony for much of the series. However, he ended up being taken down by illness rather than bullets. Johnny was diagnosed with cancer and was shown to get more and more ill as time went on. It was interesting to see a character pass away so gradually on the show rather than in the typical shocking manner.





 11  Livia Soprano 
Played By Nancy Marchand


 







Tony&#39;s relationship with his mother Livia is one of the most interesting aspects of the show. While Tony stands up against just about any enemy he comes across, he is constantly frustrated by his uncaring and hurtful mother.
It was likely their relationship was meant to be a huge part of the show for a long time to come, but actor Nancy Marchand sadly passed away before the show&#39;s third season. The Sopranos used a CGI Livia to give one final scene with Tony. It was then explained that Livia passed away in her sleep and, as a testament to the importance of her character, she continued to have a huge influence on Tony even in death.





 10  Phil Leotardo 
Played Frank Vincent
        

Phil Leotardo did not show up until season 5, played by big-screen mobster legend Frank Vincent. Leotardo was a high-ranking member of the Lupertazzi Crime Family, which were Tony&#39;s main enemies in the last two seasons of the show. Leotardo gets out of prison and then becomes the boss of the family. As the war between Tony and Phil grew deadlier, it seemed as though Phil might ultimately kill Tony in the end. However, Phil meets his end when he is shot while pumping gas and has his head run over by his own car in The Sopranos finale.





 9  Bobby Baccalieri 
Played By Steve R. Schirripa
        

Bobby Baccalieri rose through the ranks of the family, starting as a soldier before becoming a top aide to Junior and then finally becoming a capo. Out of the many people in Tony&#39;s crew, Bobby was a good person and a loyal family man. Bobby&#39;s gentle nature made his death all the more tragic when Phil Leotardo sent assassins after all of Tony&#39;s men. Bobby was gunned down in a toy store while buying a model train. His death raised the stakes for the final episodes, proving that no one was safe.
            
 
 Shocking Sopranos Theory Reveals Who Betrayed Tony, And It Totally Changes Season 6 
There are many questions surrounding Tony’s death in the Sopranos season 6 finale, but one theory reveals who betrayed the show’s lead.








 8  Vito Spatafore 
Played By Joseph R. Gannascoli
        

Vito Spatafore was a loyal member of Tony&#39;s crew who rose quickly through the ranks. However, season 5 saw a major revelation that changed his life when it turned out that Vito was a closeted homosexual. Due to the rampant homophobia within the mob, that was something that marked Vito for death on The Sopranos. After going into hiding, Vito is found by Phil Leotardo who has Vito viciously beaten to death. His murder stands out as one of the most unnecessary Sopranos deaths.





 7  Tony Blundetto 
Played By Steve Buscemi


 







Steve Buscemi entered the series in season 5 when his character of Tony Blundetto was released from prison. Blundetto was Tony Soprano&#39;s cousin and decided he wanted to lead a straight and crime-free life now that he was out of prison and a free man again.
Sadly, Tony&#39;s plans for a crime-free life didn&#39;t go as planned and he was soon sucked back into the mob world. When his friend was killed by Billy Leotardo, Tony B kills him in revenge, setting off a war. In the end, Tony Soprano kills his cousin to save him from the brutal plans Phil had for him.





 6  Mikey Palmice 
Played By Al Sapienza
        

If there was one major character death on The Sopranos that made a lot of people happy, it was the death of Mikey Palmice. He was very loyal to Junior during the early feuds between him and his nephew Tony. Mikey especially enjoyed doing Junior&#39;s dirty work and killing people. It quickly made him a character that many fans wanted to see meet a brutal end once the war between Junior and Tony really ignited.
When Mikey went jogging and found himself face-to-face with Paulie and Christopher, it provided a huge fan favorite moment when the two gunned him down mercilessly. Seeing the smug and cruel Mikey try to talk his way out of being killed and lie about his involvement reduced him to a cowardly villain before his death.





 5  Ralph Cifaretto 
Played By Joe Pantoliano


 







Another character who was easy to hate was Ralph Cifaretto, someone who grew up with Tony and was sent to Florida to watch after the family&#39;s interests there. This is where he picked up an addiction to cocaine and developed a harsh and violent temper.
It was that temper that put him and Tony at odds. Ralph beat a girl to death outside The Bada Bing and he and Tony ended up fighting themselves. While that was smoothed over in time, when Ralph admitted to killing Tony&#39;s racehorse, he ended up beaten to death on the floor of his kitchen and disposed of by Tony and Christopher.
            
 
 The Sopranos: 10 Greatest Betrayals, Ranked 
In the world of organized crime, betrayals are the name of the game; and Tony Soprano, his crew, and his enemies were all guilty of it at some point.








 4  Richie Aprile 
Played By David Proval
        

Richie Aprile showed up on The Sopranos after getting out of jail, the brother of former family boss Jackie Aprile Sr. The problem is that he was cruel and violent, his smile a facade for someone who threw his weight around -- even to the point of hurting the family.
The fact that Tony worked under him until Richie went to jail meant that there was immediate tension between the two. When Richie decided he was going to have Tony murdered, that immediately put a bullseye on him. However, in another example of the show subverting audience expectations, Jackie ended up killed when he hit Janice Soprano who responded by shooting him in the chest.





 3  Adriana La Cerva 
Played By Drea de Matteo
        

The most horrific death on The Sopranos was that of Adriana La Cerva because, at the end of the day, she was the best person on the show. Her death proved that Tony, Christopher, and their entire family were evil and deserved no redemption. Just because she loved Christopher, she was bullied into the role of an informant for the FBI.
When she tried to find a way out, she failed and ended up in even more trouble with the FBI. She tried to convince Christopher to run away with her but he almost killed her when he found out the FBI was trying to turn her against the family. Finally, Christopher told Tony and he had Sil drive her into the woods and shoot her in the back as she tried to escape.





 2  Sal Bonpensiero 
Played By Vincent Pastore
        

Through the first season, there were plenty of reasons to know that Tony Soprano was a bad guy but he was still someone that viewers were able to get behind. He did bad things but the people he hurt were people who were also bad people and Tony seemed to be the lesser of two evils.
However, another character that fans had started to like was Sal &#34;Big Pussy&#34; Bonpensiero. He was a long-time friend of Tony&#39;s and a loyal soldier for the Soprano crew. He was even someone who voted to put Tony in power. However, when the FBI busted him dealing heroin, he was forced to become another of The Sopranos&#39; FBI informants in order to stay out of prison. Tony ordered Sal&#39;s death, which he pulled off with Silvio and Paulie, and the sight of them killing their close friend showed no one was safe.





 1  Christopher Moltisanti 
Played By Michael Imperioli


 







The most shocking death on The Sopranos came when Tony Soprano killed his own nephew Christopher Moltisanti. For years, Christopher was supposed to be the man who one day replaced Tony as the head of the family and he was with his uncle every step of the way, both as a hired gun and a trusted associate.
However, Christopher was getting sloppy and much of it was due to a heroin addiction that started to cause him to make mistakes. The end for Christopher came when he was involved in a car accident and was in his car, possibly dying. That is when Tony suffocated his nephew when he realized that Christopher&#39;s daughter would be dead if she was in the car with him. He seemed relieved that he finally removed his nephew from his family tree.
