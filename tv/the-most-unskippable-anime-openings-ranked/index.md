## Literature Review

The opening of an anime is the first impression many fans get as to what the series is all about. Some of the most iconic are impossible to skip.




The most unskippable anime openings will not only enthrall an audience, but they will create an introductory musical theme so iconic that viewers cannot bear to skip the minute-and-a-half sequence if given the choice. Anime openings serve as the face of a series, and studios will do everything to make it a meaningful part of the viewing experience.
Naturally, such a feat is a tall task that involves both aural and visual crafts that are heightened to the utmost effect. It is imperative that the musical mood be representative of the mood of the respective anime series, but its lyrics must also be relevant, and the rhythm must pair well with the visual previews that most opening animations serve as.
Because opening themes are so important, most animation productions will actually reach out directly to prominent Japanese artists to commission songs for the sole purpose of an anime&#39;s opening theme.

 10  &#34;Departure&#34; Doesn&#39;t Lose To Repetition 
Hunter x Hunter Opening 1-6 by Ono Masatoshi


The opening theme to Hunter x Hunter is one that has stuck around for the entirety of the popular shonen remake&#39;s 148 episodes.

Despite the repetition, the song, titled &#34;Departure&#34;, is a perfect pairing to every part of the anime, not allowing any feelings of monotony to reach its viewers. Furthermore, the themes of the music highlight both the hardships that the main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio face, and the pleasant times spent together.

 8  &#34;Unravel&#34; Gives An Eerie, But Enrapturing Start 
Tokyo Ghoul Opening 1 by TK


Tokyo Ghoul is a fantasy horror anime produced by Studio Pierrot based on the manga by Ishida Sui that is perfectly introduced by the rollercoaster of emotion that is TK’s &#34;Unravel&#34;. The song begins with a falsetto opening that accentuates the isolating visuals portraying the main character, Keneki, sitting in a heaven-like space.
TK&#39;s voice has a soft but harrowing timbre that draws viewers into a sense of gravity, as the vocals are interspersed by surprise bursts of band solos that feature furious guitar riffs and fast movements through registers. &#34;Unravel&#34; is possibly the best pick to represent the tumultuous and frightening story of Tokyo Ghoul.

 7  &#34;The World&#34; Ignites Psychological Battles 
Death Note Opening 1 by Nightmare


The popular psychological mystery Death Note, produced by Madhouse and based on the manga by Obata Takeshi and Ohba Tsugumi, is a peak example of shonen suspense that is depicted exquisitely by its first opening theme titled &#34;The World&#34;. This song by Nightmare is a high-energy piece of rock with metal elements that takes the excitement of horror and infuses it into a rather upbeat opening theme.
As Death Note follows the complex intellectual battles of its characters, Light, L, and even Ryuk the shinigami, the psychological aspect of the anime comes to the surface. Paired with the opening&#39;s visuals, &#34;The World&#34; is a perfect preview of what’s to come.

 6  &#34;Colors&#34; Paints an Explosive Canvas 
Code Geass Opening 1 by Flow


Code Geass is a supernatural mecha anime produced by Studio Sunrise and is an original series directed by Taniguchi Gorou that flips typical action shonen archetypes on their heads. Naturally, the first opening theme, &#34;Colors&#34; by Flow, is a slightly deceptive song that gets audiences pumped for exciting adventures, but doesn’t prepare for the surprises that are in store.
If anything, such an omission of tone is a perfect match for Code Geass, as the anime prides itself on its sophisticated plot twists and complex character relationships. Regardless, &#34;Colors&#34; is a good enough song to stand on its own, but is heightened when paired with Code Geass.
Flow has also done three openings for the original Naruto series, and music for an extensive number of other anime.

 5  &#34;Hikaru nara&#34; Is Transformative With Plot 
Your Lie in April Opening 1 by Goose house


Your Lie in April is a musical slice-of-life anime produced by A-1 Pictures based on the manga by Narakawa Naoshi. Despite its misleading genre classification, Your Lie in April is much more than a high school feel-good anime or a simple romance, and the opening theme, &#34;Hikaru nara&#34;, secretly introduces these subtle twists.
The opening immediately became the song of a generation, featuring upbeat and beautiful harmonies that prime for optimistic experiences before all pretense is torn down. As the anime&#39;s plot takes a turn, the opening theme&#39;s dramatic undertones slowly come to the surface, and the song transforms into an elegy of sorrow that can only yearn for happy endings.

The song, titled &#34;Kyouran Hey Kids!!&#34;, opens the second season of Noragami and feels as if it opens a door to a new world as well. This second season brought the once underrepresented anime to the peak of popularity, in part due to its unique opening sequence. Incorporating surprising twists of genre with jazzy undertones, The Oral Cigarettes beckons viewers to give the series a try.

 3  &#34;Again&#34; Is An Unforgettable Classic 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood Opening 1 by Yui


Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a shonen anime that is often lauded as one of the best anime of all time, and Studio Bones&#39; anime adaptation of Arakawa Hiromu&#39;s famous manga does no wrong in choosing any of its accompanying music. Brotherhood features no songs that aren’t compelling, from openings to endings, but &#34;Again&#34; by Yui is the most prominent and memorable.
Yui&#39;s voice presents a feeling of both serenity and nostalgia despite serving as a first introduction to the series. Perfectly paired with the grave but beautiful laws of Fullmetal Alchemist&#39;s world, &#34;Again&#34; intertwines with the plot and the characters themselves, leaving a piece behind even after changes to the opening song.
