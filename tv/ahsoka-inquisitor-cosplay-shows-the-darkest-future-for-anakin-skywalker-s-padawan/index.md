## Literature Review
This compelling Star Wars cosplay shows a different path for Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Padawan Ahsoka Tano as an Inquisitor embracing the dark side. 




One compelling Star Wars cosplay shows a darker future as an Inquisitor for Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Padawan Ahsoka Tano. After the destruction of the Jedi Order and the Order 66 massacre of most Jedi in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Ahsoka goes into hiding and later re-emerges not as a Jedi but as &#39;Fulcrum.&#39; In the animated Star Wars Rebels series, Ahsoka works under this alias alongside the Rebels, fighting back against the Empire and their Inquisitors, who seek and kill Force-sensitive people and any lingering Jedi. In this cosplayer&#39;s imagining, though, Ahsoka instead turns to the dark side, becoming an Inquisitor herself in the wake of Order 66.




                  How Ahsoka Survived Order 66 In Star Wars   Despite her past as Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Padawan during the Clone Wars, Ahsoka Tano survived Revenge of the Sith&#39;s Jedi Purge known as Order 66.    

Cosplayer moraicosplay posed with a red double-bladed lightsaber in Inquisitor garb in an impressive cosplay. Though capturing the same beloved face markings and lekku of Ahsoka perfectly, this image depicts a very different version of the fan-favorite character. The cosplay is not only striking but also intriguing, suggesting what Ahsoka could have become had her path twisted toward the dark.


 

Given the lesson Anakin teaches Ahsoka in Ahsoka episode 5 about life versus death, Ahsoka&#39;s struggle against the dark side is real enough that this cosplayer&#39;s imagining could have happened in an alternate Star Wars universe. Had she chosen death and killed Anakin&#39;s World Between Worlds apparition, then Star Wars viewers very well could have seen an Ahsoka just like this. Most notably, the cosplayer includes the same Sith eyes Ahsoka showed during this scene, proving how likely the scenario could have been if she had made the wrong choice.





 Ahsoka Would Never Have Fallen to the Dark Side 
          

The most powerful light side Force wielders are the most fun to imagine falling to the dark, because the dark side offers such immediate raw power. A version of Ahsoka that leaned into her anger, particularly if she was working alongside Imperial era Darth Vader, is thrilling, because she has so much potential as a villain. Despite this, Ahsoka, like Obi-Wan, never would have turned to the dark side. Ahsoka dealt with her fair share of struggles with both temper and attachments, and she even experienced an extreme temptation to turn on Mortis in The Clone Wars series, but she is also defined by her compassion and commitment to helping others.

As beautifully and tragically depicted in the Ahsoka series, Ahsoka was just a child when she was thrown into the Clone Wars. She was also being taught by Anakin Skywalker who, although powerful and compassionate in his own way, was already struggling with a pull to the dark side and was going against the Jedi Order in his relationship with PadmÃ©, which Ahsoka was marginally aware of. At the end of The Clone Wars, Ahsoka is left with nothing. She believes everyone who was essentially family to her was massacred, and she enters exile. Star Wars seems to make it clear: if these brutal events couldn&#39;t turn her, nothing would.
