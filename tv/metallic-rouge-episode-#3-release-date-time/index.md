Episode #2 was a notably slower episode than the series premiere that preceded it, but it still served as a great follow-up that added a lot to the characters and overall lore. The series is still off to a good start, and there’s plenty to look forward to for episode #3’s eventual premiere.

 What Happened In Metallic Rouge Episode #2? 
          




In Metallic Rouge episode #2, “Wander in the Labyrinth”, Rouge and Naomi took a bus to the town of Wellstown when they were attacked by the Suns of Ares, a mercenary group hired by Viola’s former lover Herman Heyward to capture Rouge. Rouge was able to fight them off with help from the other passengers, but the damage to the bus forced them to stop in a forest for repairs. While there, one passenger, a photographer named Jill Sturgeon, thanked Rouge for saving them and instilled into her the idea of her having free will and not simply following orders.

While waiting for the repairs, Rouge, went exploring the forest with a young girl named Emily, and met a mysterious man named Eden who warned them about an old war machine they discovered called a Cylinder Head. After Emily accidentally activated the weapon, Rouge transformed into Metal Rouge to fight off the Cylinder Head while everyone, including Eden, escaped on the newly repaired bus. Rouge reunited with everyone after defeating the Cylinder Head, and as they continued heading to Wellstown, Rouge remarked feeling that she grew up a bit on account of being able to get along better with others.






 Metallic Rouge Episode #3 Will Build On A Major Lore Reveal For The Series 
          

While Metallic Rouge episode #2 was somewhat light on plot, it did provide some major revelations about the series lore. In a surprising turn, it was revealed that not only was humanity visited by two different alien races in the past, the kindly Visitors and the warmongering Usurpers, but that Neans were created as soldiers in the war against the Usurpers, as well. Alien existence is a big reveal that’s bound to factor in the plot later, especially since they’re responsible for the Neans, so it will be interesting to see how Metallic Rouge develops that plot point, going forward.

Metallic Rouge streams new episodes on Wednesdays on Crunchyroll.
