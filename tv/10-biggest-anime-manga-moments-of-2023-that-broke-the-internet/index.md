 9  Hunter X Hunter&#39;s Possible Ending Revealed By The Creator 
Created by Yoshihiro Togashi
        

Yoshihiro Togashi has suffered a lot with his ongoing health struggles, prompting many hiatuses for Hunter X Hunter, even one lasting 4 years. For fear that he would not make it before he could give a proper conclusion to the manga, he decided to reveal one of the possible endings of the series. Set many years into the future, long after Gon has become a great hunter, the ending will focus on his granddaughter who bears the expectations of her grandfather but wants to live a stable life, the complete opposite of Gon.
This is one of the possible conclusions Togashi envisioned for his story, but one he has already discarded, meaning that the mangaka decided to disclose it in the unlikely case he won&#39;t live enough to bring his work to its proper end. Fortunately, Togashi does seem to be in better health as of recently, and his preferred ending has not been revealed, so fans can only hope he sees Hunter X Hunter to its end.

 1  The Boy And The Heron Sets Multiple Precedents 
Produced by Studio Ghibli


 







Fans of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli had to wait more than 10 years for a new movie, and The Boy and The Heron was definitely worth being patient for. From being the first anime movie to win a Golden Globe, dominating the box office in its opening weekend, to receiving praise from everyone who watched the film, it is not an exaggeration to say that The Boy and the Heron is already an icon in the anime industry.
The unique low-profile marketing, the appeal of being Miyazaki&#39;s final movie (even if the director later announced he has not retired yet) and the sheer quality of one of the best Ghibli productions in years all contributed to making The Boy and the Heron one of the biggest successes of anime in recent years and certainly a highlight of 2023.
