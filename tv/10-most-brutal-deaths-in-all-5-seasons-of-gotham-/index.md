## Literature Review
Throughout its five seasons, Gotham introduced a wide array of villains from Batman&#39;s Rogues Gallery, and that led to one of DC&#39;s bloodiest shows.




DC&#39;s Gotham series featured quite a few deaths over the course of its five seasons, and some of them were more brutal than the rest. Gotham was the spiritual sister series to Smallville, with both of them telling the stories of how DC&#39;s two biggest heroes came to become who they were destined to be. Gotham&#39;s main difference from Smallville was that, although the series told the story of how Bruce Wayne would become Batman — with David Mazouz suiting up as the Dark Knight in Gotham&#39;s series finale — the show was centered on Ben McKenzie&#39;s Jim Gordon.
While Bruce would only become Batman at the end of the series, following a massive 10-year time jump, Gotham had no problems with introducing most of Batman&#39;s iconic villains in the series. Gotham&#39;s Batman villain roster included popular names like Catwoman, Penguin, Riddler, Ra&#39;s al Ghul, Poison Ivy, and many more. With so many Batman villains making their way into the series, Gotham got quite bloody, as most of its characters had no qualms about killing. The series became one of DC&#39;s darkest and most violent, with several intense, bloody fights and deaths over five seasons. Here are the most brutal deaths throughout Gotham&#39;s five seasons.

 10  Commissioner Sarah Essen Is Tied Up And Shot By Jerome 
Season 2, Episode 2
        

While Gotham could never fully use the Joker, the series made do with a few different versions of the character. In season 2, Cameron Monaghan&#39;s Jerome was terrorizing Gotham City as the first version of the series&#39; Clown Prince of Crime. Jerome led a raid on the Gotham City Police Department headquarters that saw pretty much the entire GCPD get murdered. The event&#39;s most brutal death was that of Commissioner Sarah Essen, who was toyed with on live TV by Jerome before being fatally shot by the villain. Essen motivating Gordon to go on with her dying breath sealed the deal on the tragic and brutal death.





 9  The Fake Leader Of The Court Of Owls Is Decapitated 
Season 3, Episode 19
        

Kathryn Monroe was initially thought to be the leader of the ancient evil organization known as the Court of Owls in Gotham.

After two seasons in Gotham, Monroe&#39;s brutal death came at the hands of Nathaniel Barnes — the Executioner. Monroe tried to get Barnes to help her escape Gordon and the GCP after she had been apprehended, only for the Executioner to decapitate Monroe without hesitation.





 8  Alice Tetch Is Impaled On A Pole 
Season 3, Episode 4
        

Mad Hatter was one of Gotham&#39;s most unsettling villains. Even Jervis Tetch&#39;s sister, Alice, did not want to be near him. The Batman villain did not want to let his sister go, capturing Alice and making her wear clothes similar to those of the titular character in Alice in Wonderland. Alice&#39;s blood was poisonous, and when Jervis caught his sister, he took some of her blood and stored it to blackmail her into never leaving him again, or he would dump her blood on Gotham&#39;s water supply. When Jervis&#39; hideout was breached, Alice attempted to escape but ended up falling to a brutal death, being impaled on a pole.

 7  Azrael Is Killed By An RPG 
Season 2, Episode 20
        

Azrael had one of the most brutal and downright bizarre deaths in all of Gotham&#39;s five seasons.

That was not the end of Galavan&#39;s time in Gotham, as he would be resurrected as Azrael by Hugo Strange. Azrael would later try to kill Bruce Wayne, only to be stopped by Butch Gilzean, who simply exploded Azrael with a rocket launcher.

While he would get another season in Gotham, Butch&#39;s time in the series ended with a brutal second death. After Solomon Grundy was turned human again, Butch was shot and killed by his former friend, Cobblepott, as revenge for Tabitha having killed his mother.





 5  Nora Fries Is Frozen To Death 
Season 2, Episode 13
        

Nora Fries is one of DC&#39;s most tragic characters, and Gotham&#39;s version of the character could not be any different. In the series, Victor Fries took his normal path of freezing Nora to give him time to find a cure for her condition, as he does in most other adaptations. However, Gotham took an unexpectedly dark turn.

One of Gotham&#39;s saddest and most brutal deaths was that of Gertrud Kapelpult, the Penguin&#39;s mother.

When Gertrud is let out of the cage she was being kept in, Tabitha shockingly throws a knife in her back.

Nygma confessed to having killed the abusive Thomas Dougherty, which scared Kringle, who attempted to pack her things and leave her boyfriend&#39;s apartment; however, the door was closed. Nygma then proceeding unknowingly to kill Kringle by choking her, all while telling her he was not a monster, was extremely dark.





 2  Grace Van Dahl Is Fed Her Children Before Being Killed 
Season 2, Episode 17
        

The Penguin is responsible for several of Gotham&#39;s most brutal deaths over the show&#39;s five seasons, all mainly due to the character being after revenge for others hurting him or his loved ones. Grace Van Dahl and her children fit both cases, as Grace — Oswald&#39;s stepmother — killed his father, and alongside her children, made Oswald their servant. Grace&#39;s death was one of Gotham&#39;s most twisted, as she was forced to eat her children, whom Oswald had cooked into a meal for her. Grace was later repeatedly stabbed by the Penguin.
