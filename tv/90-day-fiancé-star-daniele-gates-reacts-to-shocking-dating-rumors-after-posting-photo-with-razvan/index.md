## Literature Review
After sparking dating rumors with Razvan Ciocoi on social media, Daniele Gates from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise reveals if she’s interested in him.




Daniele Gates from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way dismissed rumors that she may be romantically involved with Razvan Ciocoi. Many cast members from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise stood out in 2023. However, only Razvan made it to the U.S. without the help of his American partner. During 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, the Romanian reality star dated a single mom named Amanda Wilhelm. He loved her, but things didn’t work out. After breaking up with Amanda, Razvan focused on himself and his acting career. He made it to the United States after acquiring an artist visa.




Razvan has posted many pictures from New York City. In December 2023, he connected with a fellow 90 Day Fiancé star and met her. Recently, Daniele posted a few pictures of herself standing with Razvan. She met the Romanian man in Miami at an event. As expected, many fans wondered if Daniele was dating Razvan or was interested in him.


 

However, she quickly debunked the dating rumors. The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star replied to the curious social media users, “it’s not a thing, so please, no one make it a thing.”


 Daniele Gates &amp; Razvan Ciocoi&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Journeys Explained 
          




Daniele and Razvan had similar journeys on different 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs. They were in relationships with insensitive partners who broke their hearts. Daniele was in a relationship with Yohan Geronimo, who disrespected her throughout their short marriage. The Dominican Republic man stole money from her, cheated on her, pushed her to have a baby, and even mistreated her for his benefit. Similarly, Amanda used Razvan to move on from the loss of her husband. She enjoyed Razvan’s company until he asked her to support him in coming to the United States.

Fans are rightfully excited about a possible romantic connection between Razvan and Daniele. They are both victims of their past relationships and deserve someone who can give them true love. Razvan is a good fit for Daniele because he has made it to the United States independently. Unlike Yohan, he wouldn’t be looking at Daniele to provide for him and give him money. In comparison, Daniele just wanted a husband who could love her. Since Razvan cared for Amanda despite knowing she was a single mother with emotional problems, he could also do the same for Daniele.




Unfortunately, Daniele and Razvan may not yet be ready to fall in love. Razvan had just left his toxic relationship with Amanda and needed time to focus on his career. He’s young and has years to build a family. For now, he has come to the United States on an artist visa and should focus on his career more than anything else. Likewise, Daniele is still heartbroken and damaged by Yohan’s betrayal. She needs time to trust others and recover from her tragic divorce. For now, Razvan and Daniele should remain friends.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
