# Doctor Who Showrunner RTD Reveals Emotional Connection Behind Seasonal Special Guest Star


## SUMMARY 



  Davina McCall&#39;s appearance in the Doctor Who 2023 Christmas special is emotionally connected to the show&#39;s 2006 BAFTA win.

## Literature Review
Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies reveals the emotional connection behind the latest Christmas special&#39;s guest star, Davina McCall.




Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies has explained the emotional connection behind Davina McCall&#39;s appearance in the show&#39;s latest Christmas special. During &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; McCall guest starred as a fictional version of herself, becoming a victim of bad luck due to the goblins targeting Ruby Sunday. She is also the host of a TV show aiming at reuniting families through DNA, something she tries in vain to help Ruby with.




Speaking on Doctor Who: Unleashed, Davies revealed the emotional connection that led to McCall guest starring in the special Doctor Who season 14 episode. The showrunner explained part of the reason was her presenting the series with its BAFTA award in 2006, connecting her to the very beginning of the show. Check out what Davies had to say below:


I kind of owed it to put Davina into this, because when we won a BAFTA for Doctor Who in 2006, it was Davina who presented it to us, so that was… I associate Davia McCall with Doctor Who very closely.



 What Is Davina McCall’s Other Doctor Who Connection? 
          

McCall&#39;s portrayal as herself isn&#39;t the first time she&#39;s appeared in the sci-fi series. She first made her debut in season 1, episode 12, &#34;Bad Wolf,&#34; where she voiced the Davinadroid, a voice hosting a version of Big Brother in the distant future. The actor hosted the British version of the real game show from 2000 to 2010, her initial appearance in the series was a reference to her job at the time.




However, the latest Christmas special is the first time McCall has appeared in a physical capacity on the show. Despite only joining the Doctor Who season 14 cast for this particular episode, her involvement in the special exhibits how much she is connected to the series. Her role reflects Davies&#39; appreciation for her and how much he associates the show&#39;s success with her own.

                  A Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Actor Has A Hidden Connection To Season 14&#39;s New Companion   There is a clever casting decision in the Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials that links a new companion to one of her former projects.    

Since the Doctor Who 2023 Christmas special ended with the Fifteenth Doctor saving McCall, it&#39;s possible she could make another appearance in the show&#39;s future. If she does, the series will no doubt continue to honor her importance within its history. Perhaps her guest starring in the latest episode will open the door for other familiar actors to appear in later seasons of the show.






Doctor Who continues when season 14 properly begins in May 2024.
