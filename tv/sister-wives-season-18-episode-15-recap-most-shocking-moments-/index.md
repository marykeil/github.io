## Literature Review
Sister Wives season 18 episode 15 was the first installment of One On One, where the cast members sit down to unpack the season on their own entirely.




Sister Wives season 18 episode 15, “One On One: Part One”, gave viewers a look into the Brown family’s headspace as host, Sukanya “Saki” Krishnan, asked probing questions about the state of their relationships. The Brown family went through a difficult season of life throughout Sister Wives season 18, with Kody Brown still processing his divorce from Christine Brown and taking his anger out on everyone else in the family. Although Kody knew he would have problems in his relationships after feeling betrayed by Christine, he chose to take his feelings out on Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, and Robyn Brown throughout the season, changing their dynamics with him entirely.




After Christine made the difficult decision to leave the Brown family during Sister Wives season 17, she moved back to Salt Lake City as Kody&#39;s other marriages began to crumble. The most recent season of Sister Wives saw Kody&#39;s relationship with Janelle fizzle after a massive fight during Sister Wives season 18 episode 3. While both considered reconciliation, Janelle chose to be independent. Kody&#39;s marriage to Meri, which spanned over 30 years, came to a close after Meri chose to stop sitting idly by while Kody ignored and belittled her. Though Robyn is still with Kody, things have changed entirely.

 Kody Admitted He Wasn’t In Love With His First Wives 
His Relationship With Robyn Was Different
          

Early on during Sister Wives season 18 episode 15, Kody was asked about the differences between falling in love with Robyn and how he felt about Meri, Janelle, and Christine. While Kody&#39;s wives understood that the relationship between Kody and Robyn was different than what he had with his other wives, Kody and Robyn felt they were protecting their relationship by trying to downplay it. Kody admitted that his relationship with Robyn was genuine love, whereas he chose to be a loving husband to his first wives without actually falling in love with any of them. It didn&#39;t occur to Kody that this could be hurtful in the long term.






 Janelle Was In Love With The Idea Of Kody 
She Believes They Ultimately Fell In Love

 

Although Janelle rarely agreed with Kody during the first part of Sister Wives: One On One, it did come to pass that she also felt her relationship with Kody wasn&#39;t based on a feeling of romantic love at first. She shared that, in the beginning, she was in love with the idea of Kody and the life she could have with him. Janelle was open about wanting to be married and accepted into a plural family, and ultimately, she felt that she fell in love with Kody over time. She shared that she felt their relationship grew at an interestingly steady pace.

She Wasn’t Happy To Learn His Real Feelings
         




While Janelle revealed that she understood the machinations behind Kody&#39;s marriages prior to her time in the family, Robyn shared the opposite sentiment. Tearfully, Robyn explained that she didn&#39;t have any indicator that Kody&#39;s marriages hadn&#39;t been built on a foundation of romantic love. From Robyn&#39;s perspective, she saw a man who had three loving marriages and was welcoming her in to be the fourth. The fact that Kody wasn&#39;t feeling romantic love for any of his wives seemed to hurt Robyn, as her perception of Kody had changed entirely from the man she thought he was.

Christine shared that there was a moment when she was watching Kody get ready to take Robyn on a date and asked him if he was in love with her. When Kody excitedly confirmed that he was in love with Robyn, Christine said her heart broke. She shared that it was difficult to see someone she wanted that same love from give it so freely away to someone else.






 Kody Feels Christine &amp; Janelle Have Been Trashing Him 
He Says He’s Guilty Of Not Being In Love With Them
         

Although Kody admitted that he was never truly in love with his first wives, he quickly pointed out that he&#39;s currently upset with Christine and Janelle because he thinks they&#39;re trashing him behind his back. From the moments he&#39;s seen on Sister Wives season 18 to things he&#39;s heard from the rest of the family, Kody feels that Christine and Janelle have combined forces to talk poorly about him to each other and their children. He&#39;s hurt because he thinks they&#39;re letting their marital issues bleed into how they talk to the Brown kids about Kody, despite the fact that the kids are adults who can make their own calls.

After watching Janelle and Kody&#39;s fight from Sister Wives season 18 episode 3, each of the cast members had their own difficult reactions. Kody wasn&#39;t proud of the fight, explaining he felt very triggered by the fact that Janelle was celebrating Christmas without him, while Janelle had to laugh some of it off, knowing the fight was a huge part of her divorce. Both Janelle and Meri shared they feel Kody needs to reflect on who he is as a person and how he&#39;s behaved toward them in the past. Seeing him yell in Janelle&#39;s face confirmed for both women that they&#39;d rather be without Kody.

He Doesn’t Feel They Were Friends Before
         

Kody shared that while he&#39;s not sure he&#39;s interested in continuing a marriage with Janelle, his feelings have turned sour regarding Christine&#39;s relationship with Janelle. Kody explained that he didn&#39;t feel they were close before Janelle and Kody&#39;s split. Even if they supported each other in the past, Christine was a bad sister wife to Janelle, so Kody doesn&#39;t understand their bond. Kody explained he&#39;s jealous of Christine and Janelle&#39;s relationship, but doesn&#39;t understand how to approach that feeling for himself. Christine, in turn, was happy to hear Kody felt the same jealousy all his wives had felt about each other in the past.






 Kody Believes His Estranged Children Are Bullies 
He Doesn’t Feel All His Kids Care For Robyn
          

Kody&#39;s relationship with his kids has been explored throughout Sister Wives season 18, but during the first part of the One On One, he explained that he doesn&#39;t want a relationship with several of his children who he believes are bullies. Kody shared that his main issue with his kids is that they don&#39;t respect his relationship with Robyn. The kids who aren&#39;t Robyn&#39;s biologically have problems with her; if they have problems with Robyn, they have problems with Kody. Instead of understanding that his children can have relationships with him independent of his wife, Kody explained that if they don&#39;t want Robyn in their life, they can&#39;t have him.



 Robyn Revealed She’s Frustrated Over Kody Involving Her 
She Doesn’t Want To Be Blamed For Kody’s Drama
          




While Kody feels like he&#39;s going to war to keep Robyn safe, she doesn&#39;t want any part of his behavior. She shared that though she appreciates him looking out for her, she&#39;d rather he try to have a relationship with his children than push them out the door for her. Robyn explained that she feels she&#39;s taken the blame for problems Kody has created, which she has no interest in. Instead, she&#39;d much rather let the kids be angry with her and see them have a relationship with their father. Robyn understands her role as the scapegoat and would accept it if the kids could get along with Kody.



 Janelle Shared After Her Fight With Kody She Felt Relief 
She Didn’t Want Him In Her Life Anymore
          

At the end of Sister Wives: One On One part 1, Janelle shared that after her fight with Kody early in the season, she was hit with a huge sense of relief despite knowing that her marriage was probably over. Janelle explained that she hated fighting with Kody, but she&#39;d walked away from it understanding that she was stronger for fighting with him and not letting him walk all over her. She said she was flooded with a sense of relief about no longer having to be tethered to Kody any longer. Janelle felt her marriage was probably over months before the estranged couple even spoke again.
