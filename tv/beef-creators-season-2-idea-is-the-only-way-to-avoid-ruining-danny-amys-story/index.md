The creator of Netflix&#39;s Beef has given his idea for what a potential season 2 could be, with this plan being the only way to avoid ruining Danny and Amy&#39;s story. Danny and Amy&#39;s titular conflict in Beef is the main story of the series, with many viewers wondering how the show could continue after the season 1 finale. However, it seems that the team behind Beef has a plan, with the show&#39;s creator presenting how the series can continue while preserving the conclusion of Danny and Amy&#39;s arcs.

Netflix&#39;s Beef was one of the streaming service&#39;s most popular original series of 2023, with the platform teaming up with A24 in order to make the critically acclaimed show. Beef follows Danny and Amy, two complete strangers who have a road rage incident that quickly spirals out of control, with the duo escalating things as they go back and forth in an attempt to get revenge. By the end of the series, however, Danny and Amy&#39;s beef is resolved, with the potential path forward for Beef season 2 going unknown until now.




                  Is Netflix&#39;s Beef Based On A True Story? Real-Life Inspiration Explained   As over the top as their feud was, it&#39;s easy to relate to Amy and Danny&#39;s moment of road rage in Netflix&#39;s Beefâ€”so is their story based in truth?    


 An Anthology Would Be The Best Option For Beef Season 2 
         

When looking at the possible paths forward for the series, it is clear that making the show an anthology would be the best option for Beef season 2. When asked about the future of the show, Beef creator Lee Sung Jin explained that an anthology series is actually what he envisioned when developing the series. According to Jin, each season was supposed to be about a new beef, with the stories presumably following a similar structure to that of Danny and Amy&#39;s beef.

While Beef season 2 focusing on entirely new characters may sound like a risky move, it is actually the perfect way for the show to go forward. Having characters from Beef season 1 have another beef on the same scale as the original story would be completely unbelievable. However, focusing on new characters in new locations would allow Beef season 2 to tell all kinds of different stories while also staying fresh.






 Why Beef Season 2 Shouldn&#39;t Focus On Danny &amp; Amy&#39;s Original Story 
          

An anthology series is the perfect way to continue the show, as Beef season 2 really shouldn&#39;t focus on Danny and Amy&#39;s original story. By the end of Beef season 1, Danny and Amy have mostly made up for their past conflict, with the finale exploring the duo having to come to terms with each other while stuck in the desert. Due to their relationship now being on more friendly terms, it would be nearly impossible to have them get into another season-long beef without it feeling contrived.

On top of that, bringing back Danny and Amy&#39;s story would completely undo everything that Beef season 1 built. Beef was all about the slow raising of stakes and tension between the two characters, with it getting to the point where they both realize things have to end. Having them start another beef would undo the thematic purpose of the original story, hurting Beef seasons 1 and 2.
