## Literature Review
Peacock&#39;s long-gestating Battlestar Galactica reboot gets an exciting update as a new showrunner has been hired to lead the show&#39;s latest reinvention.




Peacock’s upcoming Battlestar Galactica reboot has landed a new showrunner, marking a significant step forward for the long-gestating project. First announced in 2019, the latest incarnation of the Battlestar Galactica franchise is set to be produced by Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail and had originally tapped The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes screenwriter Michael Lesslie to serve as showrunner in 2020. However, less than one year later, Lesslie departed the project in favor of working on a television adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s Maddaddam series for Hulu.




Per a new report from Deadline, Peacock has now secured The Sinner creator Derek Simonds to serve as the reboot&#39;s showrunner. According to the report, Simonds will not only serve as a series writer and showrunner, but he will also executive produce the series alongside Esmail and Leave the World Behind producer Chad Hamilton. This latest development comes on the back of Esmail’s previous assertion that development on the Battlestar Galatica reboot was “in great shape” following the successful resolution of 2023’s WGA writers’ strike.


 Can The New Battlestar Galactica Continue To Elevate The Franchise Beyond Its Roots? 
          

Prior to Ronald D. Moore’s critically acclaimed 2004 reimagining of the Battlestar Galactica franchise, the original 1978 series developed by Glen A. Larson rose to popularity at a time when space-faring science fiction began to dominate the pop culture landscape. Capitalizing on the unprecedented success of the original Star Wars movie, Larson’s own intergalactic adventure not only was able to leverage the hype surrounding George Lucas’ expansive space opera to get his own pilot greenlit, but his show would also find itself the center of a lawsuit alleging the show had stolen many of its underlying ideas.






While 20th Century Fox would sue Universal Studios in 1978 alleging Battlestar Galactica had stolen 34 separate ideas from Star Wars, Universal in turn lodged their own countersuit alleging Star Wars had stolen ideas from 1972&#39;s Silent Running and the original Buck Rogers serials of the 1930s.




While the original show’s legal dramas would eventually be resolved without trial, the various connections between Battlestar Galactica and Star Wars had already been solidified and remains an enduring component of the franchise’s legacy. However, with the 2004 Battlestar Galactica reboot proving the property was able to be elevated far beyond the pulp sensibilities of the 1970s’ original, any lingering comparisons between the two properties slowly gave way to a far more nuanced and gratifying approach to sci-fi storytelling. Widely regarded as one of the best science fiction shows of the early 2000s, Moore’s approach to the property would win over both new and established Battlestar Galactica fans alike.

  1:24                       Battlestar Galactica&#39;s Ending Secretly Set Up The Perfect Reboot Series   Ronald D. Moore&#39;s divisive Battlestar Galactica ending perfectly set up the next entry in the BSG canon, by revealing that we may face the same fate.    




With Simonds now tasked with helming the next reinvention of Battlestar Galactica, it will be interesting to see whether he will be capable of following in Moore’s footsteps and bringing the franchise to ever greater heights. In a world where Star Wars itself is increasingly dominating the television landscape, a new Battlestar Galactica show has the potential to offer viewers a new and exciting alternative to the same franchise that once helped it take its original form.
