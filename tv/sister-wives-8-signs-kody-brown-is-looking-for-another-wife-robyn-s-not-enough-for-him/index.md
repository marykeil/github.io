## Literature Review
Several signs suggest that Kody Brown from Sister Wives would marry another woman to continue staying in a plural marriage with Robyn Brown.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown may want to find another woman after recently falling into a monogamous relationship with Robyn Brown. The Brown family patriarch was initially happy with his relationships with Robyn, Janelle, Meri, and Christine Brown. However, things changed over the last thirteen years, which led him to fall apart from all his wives. Initially, Kody began having problems with Meri, his first significant other. He didn’t love her and stopped trusting her after the catfish scandal. Kody realized falling in love with Meri again was too risky.
Like Meri, Kody also became distant from Christine and Janelle amid the COVID-19 pandemic. His lack of affection for the two ladies pushed them to find other options and part ways. From 2021 to 2023, the polygamous man lost three of his wives, leaving him bitter and angry. He didn’t like how his plural relationships collapsed, leading him to have problems with his only remaining wife, Robyn. After spending over thirty years preaching polygamy, Kody is finally a monogamous man. However, there are a few reasons he may find another wife to reinstate polygamy.

 8  Kody’s Embarrassed To Be Dumped By Three Wives 
Kody Would Add Another Wife To Feel Confident Again


 







Kody would likely want to have another wife out of embarrassment. Over the last three years, the polygamous patriarch has lost three of his wives due to his actions. What started as a big, warm household in 2010 has become a little family of two with four kids. Kody is disconcerted by the demise of his three relationships, so much so that he has claimed he wanted to bring “another lover.” The 54-year-old man is ashamed that he couldn’t do anything to stop the inevitable. He’s likely furious that he is no longer charming enough.

 7  Kody Practiced Poylgamy For 30 years 
Kody Has Always Been A Polygamist
        

Kody may want to bring another wife into the family because of his religion and history. The Brown family patriarch was in a polygamous relationship with Meri, Christine, and Janelle for over three decades. It wasn’t just something he did out of fun but something he opted to do because of his religious beliefs. Kody would be unable to live a normal life or fulfill his goals if he stayed in a monogamous relationship with Robyn. He’d likely want to find a woman willing to stay with him and Robyn and help them expand their family.

 6  Robyn Is Getting Older (She’s Currently 45) 
Kody Would Want To Feel Younger &amp; Youthful Again


 







There’s a saying that history repeats itself, which may just happen to the Brown family. Kody tied the knot with Meri in 1990. He then courted Janelle in 1993 and Christine in 1994. All the women he married were in their twenties or thirties, fit and capable of giving him every benefit. However, things changed when these women reached their 40s, and Kody decided to bring in another wife, Robyn, who was in her early 30s. Now, Robyn is 45, which may be a sign for Kody to find someone new and youthful. He’d probably like to feel young with another woman.





 5  Kody’s Fighting With Robyn A Lot 
Kody’s Ready To Sabotage His Only Marriage
        

In the latest Sister Wives season 18 One on One episode, Robyn shared that Kody has begun sabotaging their marriage. She revealed that he had started picking fights with her, which is slowly destroying their relationship. Kody also admitted to Robyn’s claims and shared the scenario is true. He revealed that he’s just a bit too irritated about everything and wants to punish himself. Kody said, “these are my demons and that’s like doing something that destroys myself.” He even added that he had thought of getting into another relationship to sabotage everything between him and Robyn.





 4  Kody May Wed Another Woman To Revive Sister Wives 
Kody Could Marry Someone To Stay In A Polyamorous TV Relationship
        

Most viewers know Kody and Robyn have been reality TV celebrities for over a decade. They’ve lived most of their recent lives in front of the cameras and earned a lot. Sister Wives is like a golden goose for the Brown family, so the cast members wouldn’t want it to end. Since Meri, Janelle, and Christine have moved away from Kody, he’d need someone else to balance things out. Sister Wives is all about polygamy, and the show doesn’t work if Kody is monogamous with Robyn. Therefore, he’d probably find another wife.





 3  Kody Is Jealous Of Christine &amp; Janelle 
He Feels More Envious Than Happy About His Monogamous Life With Robyn


 







Kody’s lack of appreciation for his one-on-one relationship with Robyn is a major sign that shows he doesn’t want monogamy. Over the weeks, he has shared how annoyed he is with Christine and Janelle’s friendship. He doesn’t feel happy he has Robyn all to himself and is more focused on his former wives and their sudden connection. Kody may want to marry another woman, so Robyn has a good friend. He’d probably want to give the viewers a better Sister Wives duo out of jealousy for Christine and Janelle.





 2  Kody May Fake Another Relationship For Robyn 
Kody Could Fulfill Robyn’s Wish To Be In Plural Marriage
        

Most viewers have seen Robyn cry over the sad state of her family and her husband’s breakup with Meri, Janelle, and Christine. She only married Kody to stay in a plural marriage, which is no longer the case. She’s emotionally breaking apart and cries in every major scene. She’s so heartbroken that Kody even considered faking to be in love with Meri so that Robyn could live her fantasy. Thankfully, Meri rejected the idea. Now, Kody has no other options. If he doesn’t want to be in the relationship, he might have to fake being in one for Robyn.





 1  Kody Loves To Control/Be The Patriarch 
He Doesn’t Want To Lose That Power
        

Kody is a control freak. Viewers who watched Sister Wives during the COVID-19 pandemic watched him show pure dominance over his family members. He made rules for them, enforced restrictions, and even asked Janelle to kick out their elder sons as punishment. Kody loves to live like the king of his empire. He likes to command people, which are mostly his family members. Now, the Brown family patriarch no longer has his kingdom. The Sister Wives star would likely want to marry other women, so he could recreate his polygamous castle and take back his throne as the rightful ruler.
Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC. 

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
