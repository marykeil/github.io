# Crunchyrolls First New Isekai of 2024 Is Ridiculous But Promising


## SUMMARY 



  Fluffy Paradise focuses on the unique power of its protagonist, Neema, who has unlimited access to adoring animals for her to cuddle.   The series appeals to viewers who enjoy cute and adorable characters, with Neema&#39;s cuteness providing a ridiculous appeal to the overall story.   The cliffhanger in the debut episode hints at a potentially ingenious twist to the common isekai trope, where Neema&#39;s seemingly humble power might hold more significance and gain her immense status in the new world.

## Literature Review
Fluffy Paradise was quite clearly made for a specific target audience, but the first episode&#39;s cliffhanger suggests it could be so much more.




Warning: Spoilers for Fluffy Paradise episode 1!!!






Fluffy Paradise is an adaptation of the light novel series I&#39;ll Try My Best So I Can Pet and Pat in Another World by Himawari.




Crunchyroll definitely chose an interesting series in Fluffy Paradise to lead its litany of isekai titles into the new year. But rather than rely on past successes by licensing series where protagonists get reborn as absurd animals or objects like vending machines and pigs, the winter season&#39;s debut Isekai focuses on a rather oddly specific type of power with a humorous limited scope that promises to deliver an abundance of ridiculous cuteness – but possibly much more.

This adaptation of the light novel series I&#39;ll Try My Best So I Can Pet and Pat in Another World appears to be relying on how much the anime community can&#39;t seem to get enough of overly adorable little girls like Spy x Family&#39;s Anya.

          




But rather than being psychic, Fluffy Paradise&#39;s Neema has unlimited access to an endless supply of adoring animals for her to cuddle because of the one power she asked god to bestow her with when reincarnating her into this new world.

Because of this odd yet understandable wish, Fluffy Paradise&#39;s first episode is inundated with scenes where animals flock to little Neema as she loves and plays with them. On the surface, it appears this series was made specifically to appeal to viewers who need more cuteness in their lives and who would love the chance to cuddle any animal – even a massive tiger. Neema&#39;s cuteness also provides anime-goers with the enjoyable trope where a protagonist is special in some way that separates them from everyone else, like gaining unprecedented access to unreachable places restricted from the public and powerful, influential people that a mere child should never have. The fact that she initially receives this special treatment because she&#39;s an adorable little girl just adds to the overall ridiculous appeal of the series.




And yet, the debut episode&#39;s cliffhanger appears to be suggesting something so much more than that. If true, it would give a rather ingenious spin to a ubiquitous isekai trope. In some series, the protagonist is bestowed with a seemingly useless skill that actually ends up being incredibly powerful. Before this inevitable revelation, the misunderstood protagonist is usually ostracized or ridiculed in some way that demands retribution. However, the protagonist almost always has no say in the skill that is given to them and the truth is meant for them to figure out on their own (if the god didn&#39;t make a mistake). In this case, the power that Neema&#39;s pre-reincarnated self, Midori, requested for a very humble reason could also be incredibly useful in this new world and gain her immense status. It&#39;s more intriguing when considering the fact that God was surprised by Midori&#39;s request and clearly didn&#39;t realize the power&#39;s true potential.

          




Without knowledge of the original light novel, Fluffy Paradise could very well go the route of past Crunchyroll isekai like I Shall Survive Using Potions! or ones where the protagonist just wants to live &#34;the slow life&#34; if Neema starts getting inundated with unwanted requests that could separate her from what she truly wants in this new life – cuddling and loving animals. Only time will tell, but, so far, Fluffy Paradise is at least promising to be just an adorable new isekai from Crunchyroll.
