## Literature Review
The Mandalorian season 3 lightens the mood with wordplay, referencing Din Djarin&#39;s actions, notable cameos, and Star Wars audiences&#39; dedication.




The Mandalorian season 3 covered some serious events, but it still took the time to feature a hilarious pun about one of Din Djarin&#39;s actions as an Easter egg. Star Wars has a history of including humorous Easter eggs, usually as a reference to other movies in the franchise. The Mandalorian has numerous references for viewers, and The Mandalorian season 4 will likely continue the tradition.




The Mandalorian season 3, episode 6 featured many Easter eggs, but some were more hidden than others. Language plays a role in Star Wars&#39; setting, from swear words like The Mandalorian&#39;s &#34;dank farrik&#34; to the written language. Aurebesh, the written form of the galaxy&#39;s most common language, Galactic Basic Standard, is featured throughout the galaxy, from signs on buildings to datapads and rangefinders. While the text often makes sense in context, or is gibberish that was never meant to be translated, Lucasfilm sometimes hides a joke for the most eagle-eyed viewers - as was the case for one hilarious pun in &#34;Chapter 22: Guns For Hire.&#34;

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    


 Din Djarin Dove Through A &#34;Dive&#34; Bar 
          




Over the course of the episode, Din and Bo-Katan Kryze help the people of Plazir-15 with their rogue droid problem. At one point, while chasing a super battle droid down the streets of the town, Din dives through the window of a business to tackle and destroy the droid. The translated Aurebesh revealed that this business was a dive bar, meaning that Din dives through a dive (bar). The dad joke quality of this pun fits perfectly with the fan-favorite father figure and shows how he&#39;s settling into his role as Grogu&#39;s guardian.



 Aurebesh Hides Star Wars’ Best Jokes 
          

Later in the same episode, another Aurebesh Easter egg appeared on text on console screens. This was less of a pun, and more of a call-out to dedicated viewers. The text read, &#34;This means nothing. However, fans may interpret the hell out of it.&#34; Lucasfilm understands their audience and knew the text would quickly be translated and analyzed. This text playfully jabs at their dedication and how many secret jokes Aurebesh hides.




There is another fun Easter egg directed at Commissioner Helgait, the mastermind behind the droid malfunctions. Helgait was played by Christopher Lloyd, perhaps best known for his role as Doc Brown in the Back to the Future trilogy. Aurebesh text on one of the screens makes a fun reference to an iconic quote from Lloyd and his character, reading, &#34;Roads? Where we are going, we don&#39;t need roads.&#34; While the two movie franchises don&#39;t exist in the same universe, Lloyd&#39;s impact on the science fiction genre was huge, and Lucasfilm clearly appreciated his previous role.

The Mandalorian can be a very serious series at times, but it is also filled with lighter, funnier moments. The Easter eggs included in the show help to lighten the mood, reference actors&#39; other works, and poke fun at viewers. Star Wars is one of the most fun science fiction franchises ever, and this pun in The Mandalorian proves it never forgets to include amusing jokes whenever possible.

             The Mandalorian The Mandalorian is set after the Empire&#39;s fall and before the First Order&#39;s emergence in the ever-growing Star Wars universe. The series follows the travails of a lone gunfighter named Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic. Acting as the first live-action Star Wars series, The Mandalorian has become incredibly popular on Disney&#43;, partly due to Mando’s relationship with Grogu, which the internet dubbed “Baby Yoda” upon his introduction in season 1.
