## Literature Review
Loren Brovarnik from 90 Day Fiancé says she won’t back down after Instagram deletes one of her crucial interviews about a controversial topic.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Loren Brovarnik claims no one will stop her from speaking out against injustice. The 35-year-old mom of three has been vocal about the Israel conflict over the last few months. Previously, she took to her social media and requested donations from her followers. Loren urged people to support the victims of the Israel-Hamas war. Loren’s husband, Alexei Brovarnik, has also been very open about his views. The former Israeli resident previously showed his support for the Israeli army. He claimed he had full faith that the IDF and Israeli special forces would eradicate Hamas from being a constant threat.




Loren doesn’t hesitate to speak her mind on social media platforms. Recently, she talked about how Instagram had removed her interview video with Ayelet Levy-Shachar, the mother of hostage Naama. She said, “For whatever reason, it wasn’t letting me share my interview with her. So I am gonna try it again.” The powerful 90 Day Fiancé influencer claimed that the setback won’t stop her from talking about the truth about Israel and the victims. She added, “We have all seen the video of Naama being dragged with bloody pants, being held at gunpoint,” stating that she wouldn’t stop saying Naama’s name.

 Loren Brovarnik&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Journey Explained 
          




The reality star is passionate about the ongoing global conflict in Israel, as she is directly related to the country. Loren met Alexei during her birthright trip to Israel. She found the love of her life there and built an emotional connection with the place and its people. A few years ago, Loren even considered moving to Israel permanently. She showcased her journey on Loren &amp; Alexei: After The 90 Days, where she debated with her family about her plans. As expected, Loren’s parents, Marlene and Bryan Goldstone, weren’t happy and didn’t support her decision. They told her she was making a mistake.


 

The best thing about Loren is her unapologetic personality. She doesn’t mince her words while addressing bigger issues. Instead, she likes to talk about things directly with complete confidence. Previously, the 90 Day Fiancé cast member discussed her psychological struggles and postpartum stress without sparing details. She didn’t try to make herself look like a victim but talked about her issues in the most confident way possible. Loren’s strong social media presence may be why she’s one of the most-followed and loved 90 Day Fiancé franchise stars on social media. The mom influencer has nearly 1.5 million followers on Instagram.




The Israel-Hamas war isn’t the only topic Loren has discussed in recent months. Previously, the Florida native discussed her struggles as a mom of three and posted about her life-changing procedures. She also discussed having Tourettes Syndrome and how it affects her life. Loren has been the voice of the voiceless for a long time. She isn’t just a brilliant influencer but also the ambassador for the Tourette Association of America. Loren has been taken seriously because she’s honest and truthful. The 90 Day Fiancé star could really bring awareness to the Israel issue if Instagram allows her to speak her mind and post controversial videos.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
