# Squid Game Theory Would Allow Netflix To Expand The Franchise Beyond South Korea


## SUMMARY 



  A popular Squid Game theory suggests that the competition could take place in multiple locations around the world, providing new settings for future seasons.   The VIPs in Squid Game host their own games, implying an international aspect to the competition.   While an international setting could explore different cultures and issues of wealth inequality, it may also present challenges such as language barriers and the potential loss of the unique Korean flavor that attracted global audiences.

## Literature Review
Squid Game season 1 inspired a theory that the brutal event is also held in other countries, and proving this in season 2 could mean a new setting.




A common Squid Game theory could be proven correct in season 2 and would allow the series to expand beyond its South Korea setting. The entirety of the Netflix show&#39;s first season was set within this country, but several characters were presumably born and raised elsewhere—most notably the VIPs, who traveled to Korea to watch Oh Il-nam&#39;s brutal competition. It was through these wealthy observers that a popular Squid Game theory gained some traction, and the idea behind it could mean an opportunity for new settings going forward.




Squid Game season 1 established that the competition that gives the poor and desperate an opportunity to get rich or die trying was established by Oh Il-nam, a wealthy old man who found that his immense fortune made him and others like him board and disquieted by life. To solve this, he started a competition that allowed the wealthy elite to place bets on people competing for money, like betting on horses. The men whose money is behind the events in Squid Game come from all over the world and wear bedazzled masks to keep themselves anonymous. Still, a comment from one of the VIPs has led to an intriguing theory.

                  Who Are Squid Game&#39;s VIPs? Every Actor   Squid Game&#39;s VIPs are among the most mysterious characters in the show. Most of their identities never revealed, but here is a guide to the actors.

The VIPs only showed up on the island where the games were held near the end of Squid Game season 1, but their conversations after arriving implied that they had been watching by other means up to this point. One of the masked men mentioned that the &#34;Korean games&#34; were particularly good that year. This seems to imply that, like the Olympics, a different country hosts the games every year, and this could mean some exciting possibilities in future seasons of Squid Game.

Of course, it&#39;s possible that, since Oh Il-nam&#39;s games aren&#39;t technically called the &#34;Squid Games&#34; (this is only the name of the final game played), this anonymous VIP was referring to the competition by its country of origin—so to him, the event is called the &#34;Korean Games.&#34; Additionally, we see in the Front Man&#39;s records that Korean games are held yearly (and the Salesman is seen recruiting Korean players again at the end of Squid Game season 1), so a new location every year doesn&#39;t quite check out. Still, this theory could still work if there are multiple games held every year all over the world.






 Confirming This Theory Would Allow Squid Game To Expand Beyond South Korea 
          

Squid Games season 1 ended with Gi-hun seeking revenge for his traumatic experience by taking down Oh Il-nam&#39;s games. If, in his effort to do so, he learns more about the VIPs and discovers that other events are held around this world, this would confirm the international games theory. Of course, this would mean a far greater task for Gi-hun. Rather than just taking down a single operation, he would have to find a way to take down the games in each of these different countries.

Including Il-nam, there were ten total VIPs in Squid Game season 1, implying ten countries where the games could be held. The nationalities of each of these characters are unclear, but based on language and accents, there is a wealthy benefactor from at least the United States, England, Japan, and a Spanish-speaking country. This leaves a lot of wiggle room for virtually any setting going into Squid Game season 1 and beyond, so South Korea may be left behind (for a time, anyway).






 How Squid Game Could Work Outside Its Original Location (&amp; Why It Shouldn&#39;t Go That Route) 
          

Though Squid Game is a South Korean-made series, it gained a massive following from audiences all over the world. This makes the idea of international settings all the more intriguing since it allows audiences to see their own cultures and childhood games reflected by the series. Additionally, Squid Game explores concepts that aren&#39;t exclusive to Korea. There&#39;s an imbalance of wealth in many major countries worldwide, which sees the vast majority struggle to get by while a small percentage has more money than they could ever need. Seeing what this looks like in different countries can further drive this point home.

Still, an international setting for future Squid Game seasons would also have some struggles. First, there is the language barrier. It&#39;s implied that Gi-hun will continue to be the central character of at least Squid Game season 2, and bringing him to different countries would mean mixing him with characters who don&#39;t speak the same language. Then, most importantly, there is the fact that Squid Game season 1 brought Korean culture and entertainment to the mainstream, and stepping back from this would remove the unique flavor that appealed to global audiences to begin with. There&#39;s a lot of potential for an international setting, but it may be best to keep going with what works.
