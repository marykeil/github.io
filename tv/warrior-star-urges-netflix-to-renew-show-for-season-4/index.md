## Literature Review
Warrior star Jason Tobin is hopeful that Netflix will renew the show for season 4, as he believes it can bring attention and ratings in droves.




One Warrior star wants to see the show move to Netflix for season 4. The show was inspired by Bruce Lee&#39;s work and follows the story of a martial arts fighter living through the events of the historical Tong Wars in San Francisco. It originally appeared on Cinemax, before moving to Max for season 3. It has since been canceled, leaving its future in doubt.




While Max may not want Warrior season 4, star actor Jason Tobin is hopeful that Netflix will greenlight it. Tobin, who plays Young Jun, took to Twitter to call for Netflix to order another season.


 

Tobin&#39;s recommendation comes after reports that Warrior&#39;s streaming rights will be moved to Netflix in 2024. Tobin hopes that there will be a flood of viewers who will flock to the show as soon as it reaches Netflix. With that news in mind, he believes that Netflix should greenlight season 4.


 Could Netflix Approve Warrior Season 4? 
          

Warrior season 3 premiered on June 29, and the season ran until August 17 with a season finale that promised massive changes in Chinatown. Unfortunately, Max chose not to move forward with season 4, leaving the show in limbo. It is not the first instance of Warrior left searching for a home, as the Cinemax cancelation marked a major point of departure, but it is a moment that could prove decisive in determining the future. If Netflix does not greenlight another season, it is unlikely that it will ever come to be.






Warrior is currently accessible through Max, but it will move to Netflix in February.




Netflix has a history of canceling shows, even if they have a devoted fanbase and a massive following. Warrior Nun and The OA both enjoyed strong support, yet both suffered cancelation all the same. Even Mindhunter failed to earn a season 3, despite being a well-known and highly-praised production. For Netflix to approve Warrior season 4 would be a departure for the company, but it would not be altogether impossible.

                  Warrior Is About To Become Bigger Than Ever, Despite Being Canceled After Season 3   Despite being canceled after just its third season, HBO&#39;s martial arts crime drama, Warrior, is about to become even bigger than ever before.    

Netflix picked up You after it first began its run on Lifetime. You has already reached season 4, proving that Netflix has been willing to move forward with greenlighting new seasons of shows that are not originally Netflix productions. Stranger Things reaching season 5 is also a strong indication that Netflix is willing to approve multiple seasons, even if it requires world-shattering viewership numbers. If Warrior manages to receive strong numbers when it reaches Netflix, the streaming platform may just approve season 4.
