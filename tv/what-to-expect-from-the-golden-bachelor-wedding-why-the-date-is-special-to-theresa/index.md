## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor wedding is airing tonight, and there&#39;s a lot to expect from the historic day. Plus, the date has a special meaning to Theresa. 




The Golden Bachelor wedding is set to air tonight (January 4), and there is a lot viewers can expect to happen; plus, the date has special meaning for the bride and groom. The stars of the wedding, Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist, will be getting married tonight after meeting on The Bachelor spin-off, which was filmed over the summer. Gerry was announced as The Golden Bachelor lead just weeks before they began filming, and his life would change forever. That change was a second chance at love when he met Theresa, who was one of the 22 women vying for his heart and the final rose.




When Gerry first laid his eyes on Theresa, he knew there was something special about her. Even though Faith Martin got the first impression rose and Theresa did not, Gerry still saw something in Theresa that was intriguing. Gerry gave Theresa the first date of the season, and the two drove an old-school convertible down the Los Angeles highways and had dinner at a cute little dinner where everyone broke out into song. However, this was just the beginning of Gerry and Theresa&#39;s love story. Gerry got down on one knee, proposing to Theresa; now the two are about to get married.

 Gerry &amp; Theresa Will Have Speeches &amp; Wedding Vows 
          




Similar to every other wedding, Gerry and Theresa plan on having wedding speeches and vows. In an interview with People, Gerry and Theresa spoke with the media outlet about their upcoming nuptials, including what their kids will be saying in the speeches. However, the couple admitted that they haven&#39;t gone over what exactly their family will be saying after they make it down the aisle. &#34;Both of us are looking forward to some of the element of surprise,&#34; Gerry revealed to the news outlet, adding that if they &#34;get too involved&#34; or &#34;over plan&#34; their vows, he believes there won&#39;t be as much &#34;joy&#34; for them. 

As for their wedding vows, Gerry handwrote his vows, and they will serve as his special touch for the historic Golden Bachelor wedding ceremony. &#34;That&#39;s very personal for me,&#34; he said regarding his vows for his upcoming new bride. As for Theresa, she wants her vows to come out the way they intend to. &#34;We just hope that we say the vows correctly!” she added. However, Gerry does anticipate shedding a tear or two well before they say their vows. &#34;Theresa will not have even made it to the platform [...] and that moment I see her walking down the aisle is going to get me,&#34; Gerry said. 






 The Ceremony Will Be Taking Place At A California Resort 
          

Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding ceremony will be taking place at La Quinta Resort &amp; Club in La Quinta, California. This place may sound familiar as The Bachelor franchise filmed several seasons here when the cast had to quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pair wanted the ceremony to be elegant over anything, and this California resort fit their vibe perfectly. As for their color scheme, Theresa said she chose &#34;pale colors of pinks and peaches&#34; along with some gold flowers as she and Gerry wanted a &#34;very light and airy look&#34; for their ceremony. These colors Theresa has chosen will go perfectly with the resort decor.

Theresa revealed to People that she &#34;can&#39;t believe [her wedding is] on her birthday, because it started on my birthday.&#34; The 70 year-old turned her miletsone age the day she walked out of the limo, which was August 4, at The Bachelor mansion and met her now soon-to-be-husband Gerry. &#34;We&#39;re both on the fourth of the month; what are the chances?&#34; an excited Theresa added. Not only

Once Gerry and Theresa say their &#34;I do&#39;s&#34; tonight, the couple plans on taking a honeymoon; however, they are keeping the location under wraps. While speaking with People, Gerry said he and Theresa &#34;don&#39;t want to let [...] out&#34; that the couple likely plans on taking what they are calling a &#34;mini-moon,&#34; as they don&#39;t want people &#34;looking for that and asking questions and so forth.&#34; Gerry is also looking forward to some &#34;anonymity&#34; once the televised wedding is over. &#34;We can just enjoy each other&#39;s company without some of the glitz and glamor that&#39;s been thrown our way lately,&#34; he added.
