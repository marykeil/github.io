Ethan and Olivia&#39;s marriage is irreparably damaged, so the pair have decided to end their relationship and pursue a divorce. Throughout Welcome To Plathville, the couple has struggled as they&#39;ve changed and grown as people outside their families of origin. With things changing more for Olivia surrounding her beliefs and values, Ethan was no longer a partner that she could count on in their marriage. The divorce may not be amicable, but it was a mutual choice.

 Olivia Plath Wonâ€™t Change Last Name Amid Divorce 
          

While Olivia will be coming back for another season of the dramatic series, she&#39;s staying true to herself regarding her name and making it clear why she doesn&#39;t want to change it. Olivia sparked buzz when she made it seem like she wouldn&#39;t be open to changing her last name back to Meggs, and shared more of her thoughts in another Instagram story. Olivia explained, &#34;This has been my name for the entirety of my adult life. Honestly, sometimes I joke that I ******* earned it...with everything I went through and I&#39;m not about to change it back.&#34; Olivia feels like she&#39;s earned the right to keep her name.


 




Olivia goes on to mention not going back to her family of origin, which she deliberately separated from when she reached adulthood. For both Ethan and Olivia, this has been a hot-button issue and one of the major sticking points in their marriage. Throughout Welcome To Plathville, Olivia has pushed for Ethan&#39;s independence from his family while he&#39;s been more disinterested in the idea of leaving them behind. After years of trying, Olivia simply couldn&#39;t participate in the Plath drama any longer and decided she wanted to be free of the difficult family. Though this cost her a relationship, being free of the Plath family may be worth the price.

While she&#39;ll be appearing on the show in the future and intends to keep her last name, those will be her only true connections to the Plath family as she&#39;s known them. For Olivia, focusing on her life outside of her marriage will be an exciting adventure. She seems ready to take on the challenge of living a newly single life, and in sharing that she&#39;s returning for another season of Welcome To Plathville, she&#39;s made it clear that she&#39;s willing to be open with her fans and followers about what comes next.
