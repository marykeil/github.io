# The Traitors UK Season 2 This Contestant Has No Idea How To Play The Game &amp; Its Infuriating To Watch


## SUMMARY 



  The Traitors UK season 2 has been frustrating to watch as the Faithful have been led to incorrect answers by illogical thinking.   Ross Carson has been called out for his terrible gameplay, as he consistently makes wrong guesses and lacks the ability to reason or read people.   Despite his poor performance, Ross&#39;s presence in the game benefits the Traitors due to his consistently bad reads and instincts.

## Literature Review

The Traitors UK season 2&#39;s Faithful have been having a tough time finding the Traitors, but one sticks out for having no idea how to play the game.




The Traitors UK season 2 may be seeing the Faithful finally get to work on some of the Traitors, but one player is sticking out from the rest at how terribly they&#39;ve played the game. Throughout the current season, the cast has made some unpredictable guesses at who the Traitors may be. While some of the Traitors have brought each other&#39;s names to the table, hoping to take the suspicion off themselves before it&#39;s too late, the fact that the Faithful have been led to the answers is frustrating. Watching The Traitors UK season 2 has been maddening as the players haven&#39;t all been logical in their thinking.




Though The Traitors UK season 2 cast has seen its fair share of disloyalty among the group, Ross Carson has been called out for just how terribly he&#39;s been playing the game. According to Reddit user u/_Zso, &#34;[I&#39;m] actually getting wound up with how bad Ross is at this game. Constant wrong shouts with so much certainty. [He has] zero ability to reason or read people.&#34; While some felt the criticism of Ross was harsh, most agreed with the sentiment. &#34;I am just amazed that he hasn&#39;t had more of a target on him,&#34; u/dormant-plants shared in agreement.


 Rossâ€™ Traitors UK Gameplay Explained

Reddit users continued on about Ross&#39; gameplay in the comments, agreeing that he&#39;s been playing terribly. User u/ayyanothernewaccount shared, &#34;He&#39;s that classic type of contestant that fundamentally misunderstands the game. If he gets on with someone he thinks they&#39;re 100% faithful. If someone&#39;s personality rubs him the wrong way he thinks they&#39;re 100% traitor.&#34; The consensus on Ross is that he refuses to believe what&#39;s happening in front of him, instead engaging with his thought process. &#34;Ross is one of the worst players in any game show I&#39;ve ever seen,&#34; u/DLRsFrontSeats shared, confirming that Ross and his mother, Diane Carson, seem to have the same thought process in the game.





 

While Ross&#39;s game may be difficult to watch, there&#39;s been some incredible gameplay on The Traitors UK season 2 thus far. With the game more than halfway through, there&#39;s been a flux of Traitor on Traitor deception happening throughout the season behind the backs of the Faithful. Ross, who&#39;s been playing the game with a secret of his own even after his mother Diane left in a recent murder, has been working as best he can to find the identities of the Traitors. Even though Ross has been playing poorly, he&#39;d be great for the Traitors to keep in the game for the long run with his notoriously bad reads.

As The Traitors UK season 2 rolls into its final week, the cast will be put through some of the most difficult gameplay thus far. While Ross has successfully been a part of votes that have removed Traitors from the game, it&#39;s been clear that he&#39;s not doing the best job figuring things out on his own. While he&#39;s fierce and forward in his accusations, Ross&#39;s instincts often lead him to the wrong contestants. His time on The Traitors UK season 2 may not be successful, but he&#39;ll be remembered for his tenacity on the series regardless.
