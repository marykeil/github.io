## Literature Review
Social media users are interested in learning more about the Sister Wives cast members’ family group chat, which could unveil some unknown chaos.




Many Sister Wives viewers want to see the Brown family’s group chat so badly that they are ready to pay for it. Kody Brown and his family members have always faced drama. In Sister Wives season 18, they had a big disagreement amid Kody’s breakups with Janelle, Meri, and Christine Brown. The family members discussed the Christmas gift exchange on a group chat when Robyn Brown said they should do the annual family celebration via video call. As expected, nobody was happy with the idea and shut her down. The whole argument turned so heated that Robyn decided she and her kids wouldn’t join the family tradition in 2023.




In recent weeks, Sister Wives viewers have shown their eagerness to see the Brown family group chat to find out what transpired. People want to know how these cast members behave behind the cameras and if Robyn is truly the kind woman she claims to be. Reddit user Hussafeffer shared an illustration of a character holding a credit card and stated, “I know one of the kids has screen shots.”


 

In another Reddit post by Eismycat, a fan asked for “the Brown Family text thread.” The posts got hundreds of upvotes, which showed that people wanted to see that side of the Sister Wives stars.


 Sister Wives Season 18 Drama Explained 
          




Sister Wives season 18 was the most pivotal in the franchise’s history. It not only showed Kody overcoming his breakup with Christine, but it also showed him losing Meri and Janelle. The season focused on Kody’s journey of embracing monogamy with Robyn and the other sister wives moving on with their lives. It highlighted that the Brown family is no longer Kody’s sanctuary. Instead, everyone has become independent, and the patriarch has lost control. The contents of the private group chat could consist of some things that Robyn and the others may not want people to see. It could contain things that may damage the reputation of these cast members forever.

The eagerness from fans is understandable. Sister Wives is one of TLC’s longest-running reality TV series. Viewers have grown to love these cast members over nearly 14 years. There&#39;s a desire to see the group chat to dive deeper into the new family dynamic. Since Kody is no longer with Meri, Christine, and Janelle, the group conversation may show who’s more hostile toward the other. Viewers have seen the cast members fight and argue. At the same time, they’ve seen them reunite and love. However, they’ve never seen their behavior behind the cameras, and the group chat may disclose that.




Still, it isn’t right for social media users to ask for a group chat. Paying money for someone else’s private messages sounds invasive. If the Brown family members wanted to reveal the drama on screen, they would’ve shown that during Sister Wives season 18. However, they didn’t air the private chat, so they aren’t uncomfortable sharing it. People pressuring the Browns to reveal their conversations is sad. Just because the family has decided to show some of their drama on TV doesn’t mean they must tell the viewers every personal detail. Sister Wives stars have the right to confidentiality.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
