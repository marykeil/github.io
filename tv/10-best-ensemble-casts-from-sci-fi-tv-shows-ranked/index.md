## Literature Review
As a genre, sci-fi can boast some of the most impressive ensemble casts found anywhere. Here are 10 of the best examples in TV history. 




Perhaps more than any other genre, sci-fi TV shows can boast an incredible array of great ensemble casts. Whether as a direct result of plot lines involving complex space travel, or high concepts that require an array of characters to adequately explore, science fiction naturally lends itself to more expansive casts than other areas. Some shows have been able to do this with incredible results.
There are several ways for the best sci-fi TV shows to assemble a great cast. One method is to cast a collection of A-list actors in major roles, all but guaranteeing that their accumulated talent will produce a great result. This approach is on full display in a series like Silo. Another, perhaps more common, tactic is to use relative unknowns with good chemistry, relying on writing and the strength of the story to establish the group&#39;s status as a top-tier ensemble. Either way, finding a great cast can make or break a burgeoning series, and is often what separates the best from the rest – regardless of concept. Here are the 10 best ensemble casts ever from sci-fi TV shows.

 10  The Expanse 
Thomas Jane, Steven Strait, Cas Anvar, Dominique Tipper, Wes Chatham
        

        


 The Expanse 

 Release Date   November 14, 2015    Cast   Thomas Jane , Dominique Tipper , Cara Gee , Jasai Chase-Owens , Florence Faivre , Cas Anvar , Keon Alexander , Frankie Adams , Shawn Doyle , Steven Strait , Paulo Costanzo , Shohreh Aghdashloo , Wes Chatham , Nadine Nicole    Genres    Sci-Fi , Mystery , Drama    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6    




One of the most acclaimed series in recent sci-fi history, The Expanse thrives on the strength of its impressive ensemble. Set in a future where humanity has successfully colonized the stars, the show&#39;s cast puts big names like Thomas Jane shoulder to shoulder with comparative up-and-comers like Steven Strait. The result is an eclectic and colorful mix that helps infuse the show&#39;s story of interplanetary politics and conspiracy with genuine heart and emotion. Receiving critical praise throughout its run on both Syfy and Amazon Prime, The Expanse would not be the success it is without the incredible performances of its cast.





 9  Firefly 
Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin
        

        


 Firefly 

 Release Date   September 20, 2002    Cast   Ron Glass , Morena Baccarin , Alan Tudyk , Adam Baldwin , Summer Glau , Gina Torres , Nathan Fillion , Sean Maher , Jewel Staite    Genres    Sci-Fi , Drama , Adventure    Seasons   1    Showrunner   Joss Whedon    




Perhaps the most beloved cult sci-fi series of all time, Jos Whedon&#39;s sadly-canceled Firefly is another example of how a fun space Western can achieve legendary status with the right cast. The ship&#39;s crew of Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Gina Torres et al. brought Whedon&#39;s signature sparky dialogue to life, making Firefly a joy from beginning to end. While the show&#39;s premise certainly helped it gain popularity, it certainly wouldn&#39;t be remembered as fondly as it is if not for the chemistry of the extensive main ensemble, who made the Serenity feel like a genuine family.





 8  Lost 
Evangeline Lily, Matthew Fox, Josh Holloway, Terry O&#39;Quinn
        

        


 Lost 

 Release Date   September 22, 2004    Cast   Evangeline Lilly , Naveen Andrews , Henry Ian Cusick , Daniel Dae Kim , Harold Perrineau , Dominic Monaghan , Emilie de Ravin , Jorge Garcia , Josh Holloway , Michael Emerson , Terry O&#39;Quinn , Matthew Fox , Ken Leung , Elizabeth Mitchell , Yunjin Kim    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi , Supernatural    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   6    




Although Lost could enthrall and frustrate in equal measure, J.J. Abrams&#39; series was undoubtedly one of the major television events of the early 2000s. While its central intriguing plot was certainly a draw, an equally important factor was the show&#39;s incredibly extensive and expertly picked cast. With literally dozens of main cast members comprising one of the most extensive ensembles in TV history, ensuring that every character was given adequate backstory and screen time was a major mission in and of itself. The fact that so many were able to establish themselves as audience favorites is not only a testament to the show, but to the cast members as well.

 7  Futurama 
John DiMaggio, Billy West, Katey Sagal, David X. Cohen
        

        


 Futurama 

 Release Date   March 28, 1999    Cast   Katey Sagal , Billy West , Lauren Tom , Maurice LaMarche , David Herman , Tress MacNeille , John DiMaggio , Phil LaMarr    Genres   Animation , Adventure , Comedy    Rating   TV-14    Seasons   11    




Matt Groening&#39;s futuristic follow-up to The Simpsons took many lessons from the earlier cartoon&#39;s success – including the importance of a strong central cast. Centering on the adventures of the Planet Express delivery crew, characters like Bender, Fry, Zoidberg, and Leela were all given a vitality and charm thanks to the exceptional voicework of its ensemble. While it may be less traditional than other examples, given that some actors played multiple characters, Futurama&#39;s main roles are so iconic that the show definitely deserves recognition.





 6  Stranger Things 
Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Gaten Matarazzo


 







        


 Stranger Things 

 Release Date   July 15, 2016    Cast   Finn Wolfhard , joe keery , Jamie Campbell Bower , Brett Gelman , Caleb McLaughlin , Maya Hawke , David Harbour , Matthew Modine , Priah Ferguson , Gaten Matarazzo , Winona Ryder , Charlie Heaton , Sadie Sink , Millie Bobby Brown , Joseph Quinn , Dacre Montgomery , Natalia Dyer , Noah Schnapp    Genres   Fantasy , Horror , Drama    Seasons   4    Showrunner   Matt Duffer , Ross Duffer    




Since its debut in 2016, Stranger Things has redefined sci-fi horror with its intoxicating blend of nostalgia and scares. However, while its distinctive tone and aesthetic are certainly enjoyable, the show&#39;s true strength comes from its ensemble. With supporting roles from the likes of Winona Ryder and David Harbour, Stranger Things&#39; real stars are the young protagonists who drive the plot forward. While many are now successful in their own right, it was their chemistry and performances on Stranger Things that propelled the likes of Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard to the next level.





 5  Silo 
Rebecca Ferguson, Rashida Jones, Tim Robbins, Iain Glen, Common
        

        


 Silo 

 Release Date   May 5, 2023    Cast   Rebecca Ferguson , Rashida Jones , David Oyelowo , Common , Tim Robbins , Harriet Walter    Genres   Science Fiction , Drama    Seasons   1    Showrunner   Graham Yost    




One of the most original sci-fi series of the 2020s, Silo&#39;s all-star cast is packed with talent. Although heavyweights like Rebecca Ferguson, David Oyelowo, and Tim Robbins lend some serious acting pedigree, the show is in many ways stolen by an excellent supporting cast of lesser-known performers, including Chinaza Uche and Chipo Chung. This combination not only enhances Silo&#39;s complex story, but makes the series engaging from start to finish.





 4  Battlestar Galactica 
Edward James Olmos, Mary McDonnell, Katee Sackhoff, Jamie Bamber, Tricia Helfer


 







        


 Battlestar Galactica 

 Release Date   October 18, 2004    Cast   Grace Park , Katee Sackhoff , Mary McDonnell , Tahmoh Penikett , Tricia Helfer , Edward James Olmos , Aaron Douglas , James Callis , Alessandro Juliani , Michael Hogan , Jamie Bamber , Kandyse McClure    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Action    Seasons   4    Showrunner   Ronald D. Moore    




Perhaps the most successful TV remake of all-time, Battlestar Galactica turned a somewhat campy original concept into an epic philosophical odyssey, exploring the concept of creation and delving into the essence of humanity itself. Making such heady themes compelling week-to-week simply wouldn&#39;t have been possible without a great ensemble. Performances by the likes of Edward James Olmos and Katee Sackhoff are now seen as touchstones by many sci-fi fans, while the likes of Tricia Helfer infused potentially one-dimensional parts with genuine nuance. The result is a show that largely matches its extensive ambition – a feat that just wouldn&#39;t have been possible without truly stellar performances.

 3  Red Dwarf 
Chris Barrie, Craig Charles, Danny John-Jules, Robert Llewellyn
        

A classic cult sitcom set in space, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor&#39;s eccentric hit was defined by the strength of its four central characters. Lister, Rimmer, Cat, and Kryten propelled the show forward with their hilarious and complicated interpersonal dynamic, with each character bringing something unique to the table. Without an ensemble able to make each character stand out and the group as a whole sympathetic, Red Dwarf simply would not have worked. While the show may lack the big names of some other sci-fi series, the quartet&#39;s unique charm has secured their legendary status.





 2  Westworld 
Evan Rachel Wood, Thandiwe Newton, Jeffrey Wright, James Marsden, Ed Harris
        

        


 Westworld 

 Release Date   October 2, 2016    Cast   Anthony Hopkins , Evan Rachel Wood , Shannon Woodward , Ed Harris , James Marsden , Jimmi Simpson , Jeffrey Wright , Tessa Thompson , Thandie Newton , Rodrigo Santoro    Genres    Sci-Fi , Thriller , Western    Seasons   4    Showrunner   Jonathan Nolan , Lisa Joy    Rating   TV-MA    




Although the original film featured the likes of Yul Brynner, the 2016 Westworld TV show is in a different league when it comes to stacked casts. The line-up includes Academy Award winners, movie stars from some of Hollywood&#39;s biggest blockbusters, and industry royalty, all playing off each other to tell a gripping sci-fi story. The array of talent on display makes it unsurprising that the series has consistently been praised for its performances – even as the central narrative has caused some frustration. Whatever the show&#39;s flaws, the strengths of Westworld&#39;s huge ensemble cast still help it to shine.





 1  Star Trek 
William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, George Takei, James Doohan


 







        


 Firefly 

 Release Date   September 20, 2002    Cast   Ron Glass , Morena Baccarin , Alan Tudyk , Adam Baldwin , Summer Glau , Gina Torres , Nathan Fillion , Sean Maher , Jewel Staite    Genres    Sci-Fi , Drama , Adventure    Seasons   1    Showrunner   Joss Whedon    




Arguably the original iconic ensemble cast, Star Trek made household names of the Enterprise&#39;s crew. Shatner, Nimoy, Nichols, Takei, Doohan, Kelley, and Koenig are all rightly seen as sci-fi legends after their recurring roles in both the original series and later Star Trek projects. Offering the perfect combination of an expansive, space-centered story and compelling individual character arcs, Star Trek gave every crew member the chance to shine in their role. Their individual success coupled with the longevity of the franchise makes Star Trek undoubtedly the greatest ensemble cast in sci-fi TV history.
