## Literature Review

The upcoming Wizards of Waverly Place sequel is highly anticipated, and there are a number of questions we want answers to and things we want to see.




Given that the series finale aired over a decade ago, there are a number of things that are high on the wishlist of what viewers want to see on the Wizards of Waverly Place reboot. It was announced that the beloved Disney Channel show would be coming back and would include Selena Gomez and Justin Henrie as executive producers for the show, with the latter also taking on a main character role. It has been reported that Gomez will also be reprising her role as Alex for guest appearances.
Because of how well-known and iconic Wizards of Waverly Place was and continues to be, there are high expectations for this sequel. The fact that it has been so long since audiences have had the chance to see the characters only adds to the anticipation and excitement surrounding the project. Considering Gomez and Henrie, who were both integral to the success of the original show, are involved in this project as well, it is expected to be a strong follow-up and will hopefully provide answers to all of the burning questions audiences have.

 10  Max&#39;s Experience Running The Sandwich Shop 
        

In the series finale of Wizards of Waverly Place, it was revealed that Max Russo wouldn&#39;t be a wizard like his siblings. He lost his powers in the competition, and instead of being a practicing wizard, he would be taking over the family sandwich shop. At the time, he seemed happy about this arrangement, but as he got older he may have felt resentment and sadness over being the only Russo sibling without magical capabilities. It would be interesting to see how Max has handled being a business owner given his mischievous and goofy personality and how he adjusted to not having the powers he grew up with.





 9  How Alex Has Handled Being The Family Wizard 


 







Throughout Wizards of Waverly Place, Alex was known as the rebellious and spunky Russo child who had little regard for rules and authority. She didn&#39;t give much care to studying or practicing for the family wizard competition, so it came as a surprise when she was deemed the winner and got to keep her powers. She did exhibit a lot of selflessness and compassion during the competition, when he helped Justin as he was struggling, and it&#39;ll be fascinating to see whether she continues to show these qualities. Viewers should also get the chance to see if Alex had to go through a period of growth to become mature and be able to handle the power she was given.





 8  What Kind Of Headmaster Justin Has Been 
        

Wizards of Waverly Place always showed Justin as the most responsible in the family and as a type-A personality. He was always committed to his studies, which was why it made sense that he became the headmaster of WizTech after Alex won the family competition. One thing audiences should get the chance to see is if Justin had to loosen the reigns a little bit to be an effective leader. It has been revealed that this new show will focus on Justin leaving his wizard powers behind in order to live a normal life with his wife and sons, so getting to find out how his career played a role in this decision will be a must.





 7  What Theresa &amp; Jerry Have Been Up To After Passing Down The Sandwich Shop 
        

Theresa and Jerry were very involved parents, as they had their children being a part of the family business and were responsible for their magic training. Showing how they adjusted to being empty nesters and not having the sandwich shop will be something that the Wizards of Waverly Place reboot needs to include. Given that Justin has children now, it will also be interesting to see how Theresa and Jerry have adjusted to being grandparents and what their relationship is like with their grandkids.

 6  What Harper Has Been Up To 
        

Alex&#39;s best friend, Harper, was one of the best parts of Wizards of Waverly Place. Her difficulties in fully grasping the intricacies of the wizard world, coupled with her eccentric outfits made her one of the most memorable characters in the cast. That means that audiences will definitely be expecting her to make an appearance in the show and will want to see what kind of life she has built for herself. Seeing how she continues to maintain her individuality as an adult would make for a great storyline in the reboot and satisfy the curiosity surrounding the character.





 5  What Happened To Juliet, Justin&#39;s Vampire Ex-Girlfriend 
        

Justin dated quite a few girls throughout Wizards of Waverly Place, and one of his most memorable exes is Juliet. Juliet is an immortal vampire who was played by Disney Channel star, Bridget Mendler. Little was seen of Juliet following her and Justin&#39;s breakup, so it would be nice to get to find out what she has been up to. Getting to learn how Justin&#39;s wife reacted to learning of his unique set of exes would also make for an intriguing watch.





 4  If Alex &amp; Mason Ever Got Back Together 
        

Alex and Mason were one of the longest-lasting relationships on Wizards of Waverly Place, and their breakup was one of the saddest. Mason brought out the best in Alex, and it seemed like a majority of the things that led to their breakup had to do with the fact that they were young and immature. Because of this, they definitely could have gotten back together and had their happily ever after. The new show should answer the question of whether or not this actually happened and give audiences closure.





 3  If Max Somehow Got His Magic Back 
        

Typically, there is only one person in each family who gets to keep their powers as an adult. But because both Justin and Alex were able to remain wizards, it raises the question of if somehow Max would be able to do the same. Perhaps because of Justin&#39;s status in the wizard community given his career, he had the opportunity to get Max his powers back. Finding out if Max really never got to practice magic again is definitely high on the Wizards of Waverly Place reboot wishlist, as it would give a lot of answers as to what the past years have looked like for him.





 2  If Any Of The Characters Married Non-Wizards &amp; Whether That&#39;s Still Frowned Upon 
        

Jerry did not get to keep his powers because he married a human, and that is not allowed in the wizard community. Based on early details about the new show, it seems like Justin may have followed in his father&#39;s footsteps. Whether or not anyone else in the family did so as well should be a question that the Wizards of Waverly Place sequel answers. In addition, it should address whether or not this is still not allowed. It seems like this would be something that the wizard community moved beyond in the present time, as it feels like a discriminatory rule.





 1  What Justin, Alex, and Max&#39;s Sibling Dynamic Is Like As Adults 


 







Justin, Alex, and Max and their strong bond and silly antics were always the center of Wizards of Waverly Place. Despite their normal sibling bickering, the trio always had each other&#39;s backs and were a great example of family loyalty. These kinds of relationships can be challenged as adults, so it will be interesting to see how their dynamic has grown and changed. Given the added complexity of Justin and Alex being wizards and Max not being one, an explanation of how they get along now needs to be included in the new show.
