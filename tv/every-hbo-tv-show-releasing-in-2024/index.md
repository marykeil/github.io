## Literature Review
HBO’s 2024 lineup will see a number of new and returning series, hopefully continuing the network’s tradition of incredible prestige TV shows.




HBO is well known for being a reliable source of prestige television, with new and returning series releasing in 2024. HBO&#39;s 2023 lineup saw the conclusion of some of their best and most popular shows. Succession and Barry both ended in their fourth seasons. His Dark Materials concluded after season 3. Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty returned for season 2 but was not renewed for a third. Lastly, The Idol was incredibly divisive and concluded after only one season.
The most popular HBO shows, such as The Sopranos and The Wire, highlight the legacy the network has created. That said, 2024 will see fewer shows released following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. For example, shows like Euphoria, The White Lotus, and The Last of Us are confirmed to be delayed until 2025. Luckily, there&#39;s still plenty of great TV coming up on HBO. 




























 








 14  True Detective (Season 4) 
January 14, 2024


 







 True Detective 

 Release Date   January 12, 2014    Genres   Anthology , Mystery    Seasons   3    




True Detective season 1 is regarded as one of the best debut TV seasons ever, with top-quality writing from creator Nic Pizzolatto. The series is responsible for the migration of many film actors to television over the span of the last decade, as stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson displayed the potential for character exploration in short-form television. Following season 1, the series hasn&#39;t managed to find the same popularity and acclaim. With a new direction, True Detective season 4 will premiere on January 14, 2024.


The upcoming season of the mystery/crime series is set to star Jodie Foster and Kali Reis. The series has been penned by writer/producer Issa López and is also executive produced by filmmaker Barry Jenkins. With fresh talent and direction, the HBO series could come back strong. True Detective season 4 is set to take place in Alaska during a polar night period and will follow its lead detectives as they investigate the mysterious disappearance of a research facility crew. The trailer looks incredibly promising, even hinting at some connection to the mystery of season 1.





 13  Curb Your Enthusiasm (Season 12) 
February 4, 2024
        

 Curb Your Enthusiasm 

 Release Date   October 15, 2000    Cast   Larry David , Jeff Garlin , Cheryl Hines , Susie Essman , J.B. Smoove    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   11    Writers   Jeff Schaffer , Larry David    




Curb Your Enthusiasm, created by and starring Larry David, is one of HBO&#39;s most popular comedy series and has been running, with breaks, since 2000. According to reports, Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 began filming in November 2022 and wrapped up around March. Season 12 has sadly been announced as the final season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, ending HBO&#39;s longest-running fiction series.





 12  Tokyo Vice (Season 2) 
February 2024
        

 Tokyo Vice 

 Release Date   April 17, 2022    Cast   Ansel Elgort , Rachel Keller    Genres   Crime    Seasons   2    




HBO&#39;s crime series Tokyo Vice was one of 2022&#39;s most thrilling series, starring Ansel Elgort, Rachel Keller, and Ken Watanabe. Acclaimed filmmaker Michael Mann directed the series&#39; early episodes, helping establish its distinct neon noir style. Season 2 will pick up right where Tokyo Vice season 1 ended, continuing the story of Jake Adelstein&#39;s real memoirs, and actors Takayuki Suzuki, Soji Arai, and Aoi Takeya have been cast as new characters.







 11  The Regime 
March 3, 2024
        

 The Regime 

 Cast   Kate Winslet , Andrea Riseborough , Matthias Schoenaerts , Martha Plimpton , Guillaume Gallienne , Hugh Grant    Genres   Drama    Seasons   1    Writers   Will Tracy    




Kate Winslet gave one of the best performances of her career in the HBO miniseries Mare of Easttown, making it incredibly exciting that she&#39;ll be returning for The Regime. The miniseries will be released in early 2024 and “tells the story of one year within the walls of the palace of a modern European regime as it begins to unravel.” The series is penned by Will Tracy, a writer known for his work on Succession and the film The Menu. The new political drama will be filled with stellar writing and performances.





 10  The Sympathizer 
Early 2024
        

 The Sympathizer 

 Cast   Robert Downey Jr. , Kieu Chinh , VyVy Nguyen , Kayli Tran , Evan Shafran , Sandra Oh    Genres   Drama , History , Thriller    Seasons   1    




The Sympathizer is another new series for HBO, set to star Robert Downey Jr in various antagonist roles. The series, based on Viet Thanh Nguyen&#39;s novel of the same name, will be an espionage thriller/satire that follows a communist spy toward the end of the Vietnam War and his exile in the United States. The series stars Hoa Xuande as its unnamed protagonist, and Robert Downey Jr., is set to play several characters representing various facets of American enterprise. The series will be co-run by Don McKellar and legendary South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook.





 9  The Sex Lives Of College Girls (Season 3) 
Spring 2024
        

Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble&#39;s HBO series The Sex Lives of College Girls was a hit for the network, being renewed before season 2 ended. Season 2, which premiered in November 2022, concluded with substantial drama, with issues stirring between Pauline Chalamet&#39;s Kimberly and Alyah Chanelle Scott&#39;s Whitney, among other plot lines. The series was announced to be returning in the first half of 2024.





 8  Hacks (Season 3) 
Spring 2024
        

 Hacks 

 Release Date   May 13, 2021    Cast   Jean Smart , Hannah Einbinder , Carl Clemons-Hopkins    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   2    




HBO is unmatched in its various comedy-drama series, and Hacks has been an underappreciated continuation of that excellence. The series features Jean Smart, Hannah Einbinder, Carl Clemons-Hopkins, and It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Kaitlin Olson. Season 2 saw a significant division form between central characters Deborah and Ava, and it&#39;s yet to be seen if things will resolve in season 3, which will be released sometime in the Spring.





 7  House Of The Dragon (Season 2) 
Summer 2024


 







 House of the Dragon 

 Release Date   May 21, 2022    Cast   Jefferson Hall , Paddy Considine , Fabien Frankel , Ryan Corr , Eve Best , Gavin Spokes , Graham McTavish , Steve Toussaint , Olivia Cooke , Sonoya Mizuno , Bill Paterson , Matthew Needham , Emma D&#39;Arcy , Matt Smith , Rhys Ifans , David Horovitch    Genres   Drama , Action , Adventure    Seasons   1    




House of the Dragon, one of HBO&#39;s most popular shows, expects a return in the summer of 2024. The show&#39;s first season saw rising tension between two factions of the Targaryen dynasty, with the finale seeing irreversible damage done to one side. House of the Dragon season 2 will see the conflict escalate into the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, as two parties, led by Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower, respectively, contend for the Iron Throne.
Compared to Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon saw an increase in dragons right out the gate, meaning the series will take longer in post-production despite having already wrapped filming. The turnaround for CGI-heavy TV shows is about two years, and many series of similar size may be taking longer due to the strikes. House of the Dragon season 2 was already written before the WGA strike, and the production is under a different acting union contract, meaning they couldn&#39;t stop shooting for the SAG-AFTRA strike.





 6  Industry (Season 3) 
Summer 2024 With Succession ending, the next best thing for HBO fans is the business drama series Industry, a series known for its extreme, nail-biting tension. Industry explores the cutthroat world of investment banking through the eyes of young graduates competing for positions. The show&#39;s third season is set to premiere in 2024, with HBO Game of Thrones alum Kit Harrington excitedly added to the ensemble cast.





 5  My Brilliant Friend (Season 4) 
Summer 2024
        

HBO&#39;s My Brilliant Friend is an Italian coming-of-age drama based on Elana Ferrante&#39;s Neapolitan Quartet series. Each season is based on one of the four novels, meaning season 4 will be the final run, based on The Story of the Lost Child. A late-summer 2024 release window seems the most plausible for My Brilliant Friend season 4, though no date is set in stone.





 4  The Franchise 
Fall 2024
        

 The Franchise 

 Cast   Billy Magnussen , Jessica Hynes , Darren Goldstein , Lolly Adefope , Isaac Powell , Daniel Brühl , Richard E. Grant    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   1    Writers   Jon Brown , Sam Mendes , Armando Iannucci    




One of the most exciting new original series of 2024 is The Franchise, an HBO comedy created by Armando Iannucci with Sam Mendes involved in directing. Billy Magnussen will star, with Richard E. Grant and Daniel Brühl in recurring roles. The new series will follow a film crew producing a superhero film, with a first look shown in HBO&#39;s 2024 trailer. The Franchise is set to premiere later on in the year.





 3  The Penguin

 Cast   Colin Farrell , Cristin Milioti , Clancy Brown , Michael Zegen , Rhenzy Feliz , Alex Anagnostidis , Craig Walker    Genres   Crime , Drama    Rating   TV-MA    Seasons   1    




The Batman is one of the most popular recent superhero films, and DC is capitalizing on Matt Reeves&#39; iteration of the character by expanding it with TV spin-offs. HBO&#39;s The Penguin will follow Colin Farrell&#39;s portrayal of the classic Batman villain, continuing where the film left off, exploring a power vacuum left in Gotham City from Carmine Falcone&#39;s death. The Penguin TV show has no announced release date, but the supervillain drama is expected toward the end of the year.

Another beloved HBO comedy-drama returning in 2024 is Somebody Somewhere, which will return for its third season. The series follows Sam, a woman in her 40s struggling after the passing of her sister. The series has earned widespread acclaim for its candid, earnest characters and themes and was renewed for another season shortly after season 2 ended. There&#39;s no expected release date, but it&#39;s been confirmed in 2024&#39;s release slate.





 1  Pretty Little Liars: Summer School

 Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin 

 Release Date   June 28, 2022    Cast   Bailee Madison , Chandler Kinney    Genres   Drama    Seasons   1    




HBO Max rebooted Pretty Little Liars with Original Sin in 2022, bringing an entirely new cast to the wildly popular series.

No release date window has been announced for the series, aside from it appearing in the HBO 2024 trailer.
