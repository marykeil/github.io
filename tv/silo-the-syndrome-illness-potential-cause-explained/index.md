## Literature Review
Although Silo has not yet explicitly explained what The Syndrome is, it has dropped several clues to hint at its primary symptoms and potential cause.




&#34;The Syndrome&#34; is one of the most intriguing concepts in Silo&#39;s season 1 — but what is &#34;The Syndrome&#34; in Silo, and what is potentially causing it? Based on Hugh Howey&#39;s book trilogy of the same name, Silo stays true to most character beats and sci-fi concepts of its source material. However, to raise the stakes of its action and drama, Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Silo introduces a health condition called &#34;The Syndrome,&#34; which is not an official part of the original books&#39; lore.




After only making a few references to the condition in its first few episodes, Silo season 1, episode 6 reveals an actual character with &#34;The Syndrome.&#34; In the episode&#39;s second half, when Deputy Billings confronts Juliette for not trusting him, Juliette opposes him by saying that she has no reason to trust him because he is hiding that he has &#34;The Syndrome.&#34; While Silo episode 6 does not delve deeper into the details of the seemingly fictional health condition, it establishes that it could have major implications in its sci-fi narrative&#39;s future. Therefore, based on all the hints Silo has presented thus far, here&#39;s a breakdown of what &#34;The Syndrome&#34; is on Silo.

  1:53                       Silo Season 2: Renewal, Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Apple TV Plus has renewed Silo for season 2. Here’s everything we know about what&#39;s next, from story details to which actors could return.    


 Silo&#39;s &#34;The Syndrome&#34; Explained 
          




The first clue surrounding &#34;The Syndrome&#34; appears on a signboard in the Silo&#39;s mechanical. Titled &#34;The Syndrome Do you know the signs?,&#34; the signboard describes the condition&#39;s symptoms as: &#34;Involuntary twitching is the first sign, leading quickly to shaking of the extremities, flashes of pain and muscle spasms are next. Balance and movement is severely impaired. If untreated infection will attack the brain, resulting in reduced cognitive function and finally, A shut-down of the entire nervous system.&#34;

The signboard also includes a call-to-action saying those infected by the condition must report it at any Medical Level to get free advice and treatment. It also assures citizens that they must not be afraid, be honest, and realize that there is help. With this, the signboard&#39;s text ends with a closing sentence that reminds citizens: &#34;Clean living is the real safeguard.&#34; Other than the signboard, Article 5 in the Silo&#39;s mysterious Pact also mentions that people affected by &#34;The Syndrome&#34; are not allowed to hold a public office or any other position of responsibility that may &#34;jeopardize the Citizens of the Silo.&#34;




The Article from the Pact also mentions that those affected by &#34;The Syndrome&#34; must report their condition upon discovery and immediately resign from their position of authority. This explains why Juliette gets mad at Billings for hiding that he has &#34;The Syndrome&#34; and holding on to his position as the Deputy. Later in Silo episode 6, when Billings reaches home and asks his wife whether their child is showing signs of &#34;The Syndrome,&#34; she assures him by implying that the condition is not hereditary. The fact that Billings does not isolate himself from his family also suggests that &#34;The Syndrome&#34; is not contagious.



 What Is Possibly Causing &#34;The Syndrome&#34;? 
          

Although Silo has not yet revealed what causes &#34;The Syndrome,&#34; one can speculate based on its hinted signs and warnings from the first six episodes. The warning signs indicate the condition is caused by an infection that affects motor function and cognitive abilities. Considering how the signboard also talks about &#34;clean living,&#34; The Syndrome could be a noncontagious bacterial infection caused by prolonged exposure to the Silo&#39;s environmental factors, such as indoor pollution and rusty metal parts. This makes even more sense given how the signboard was in the Mechanical, where the pollution levels are higher than other levels.




In an interview (via SFX magazine), Silo&#39;s creator, Graham Yost, talked about the condition by saying that &#34;Human beings weren&#39;t meant to live like this. Talking about that with Hugh, we came up with something called &#39;the syndrome&#39;. It&#39;s a neuralgic response to the pressure of living in these conditions.&#34; His insight on &#34;The Syndrome&#34; implies that it could also be a mental health condition caused by the psychological distress of living in the underground city. The higher authorities of the Silo are likely to treat it as an infection because of their lack of awareness and self-imposed ignorance surrounding mental health.



 What &#34;The Syndrome&#34; Reveals About The Silo &amp; Its Citizens 
         

Regardless of what causes &#34;The Syndrome,&#34; it represents how living in the confined and oppressive environment of the Silo is gradually having a detrimental impact on the citizens&#39; health. The fact that Silo&#39;s authorities try to ostracize people with the condition and force them to resign from their respective positions shows how a highly controlled and hierarchical system exists inside Silo&#39;s walls. The neuralgic symptoms of &#34;The Syndrome,&#34; which cause excessive shaking and impairment of movement, also seem to serve as a metaphor for how the residents in Silo&#39;s underground city are slowly succumbing to the psychological distress of restrictions on social interactions and emotions.
