## Literature Review
Following his divorce from Amy, Little People, Big World star Matt Roloff has an important relationship update with Caryn Chandler.




Little People, Big World star Matt Roloff entered into a relationship with Caryn Chandler after his divorce from Amy Roloff, and they have a significant update to their relationship. Matt has been busy caring for the family farm but has tried his best to make time for love. There&#39;s curiosity about whether the reality TV star will be walking down the aisle anytime soon.




Matt has been dating Caryn since his divorce from Amy. Little People, Big World viewers learned that Caryn had also dealt with a messy divorce at one point. She married Joseph Chandler for 20 years and shares two children with him: a son and a daughter. There was a lot of gossip surrounding Matt and his girlfriend Caryn&#39;s relationship, with many loyal viewers theorizing the duo started seeing one another while Matt was still married. While these claims are unsubstantiated, it&#39;s possible they could be addressed on Little People, Big World season 25.


 Matt Roloff &amp; Caryn Chandler Are Engaged 

 

Matt and Caryn announced in April 2023 that they had gotten engaged via the network and Instagram. The photo, captioned with a simple &#34;She said Yes! #LPBW couple Matt and Caryn are engaged,&#34; features Caryn happily flashing her ring to the camera as the pair beam with radiant joy.




Fans&#39; reactions were mixed in the comments. Some were happy, saying, &#34;Oh my gosh!!!! That’s exciting !!!! I love you guys together !!!! Congratulations!!!!!&#34; but others were highly critical, commenting, &#34;Congratulations! Saw this coming…. I hope a good pre-nup is done so she can’t take the farm away from your kids, that you worked so hard for… oh wait she already has.&#34; Matt and Caryn&#39;s engagement was controversial.



 Matt Roloff &amp; Caryn Chandler Were Discussing Marriage 
          

Little People, Big World viewers will recall Matt once said they wouldn&#39;t even consider marriage until 2022, so a proposal in 2023 aligns with that timeline. Caryn replied to a curious follower during the COVID-19 pandemic, writing that she and Matt were not in a rush and were &#34;enjoying life.&#34; The happy couple bought a retirement home in Arizona before their engagement, away from Roloff Farms, and frequently make trips to the sunnier climate. They indicated their commitment to each other long before Caryn had a ring on her finger.




Caryn and Matt began dating in 2017, but she has always been instrumental in Roloff Farm. She worked behind the scenes at the pumpkin patch for ten years as the manager, which contributed to the cheating rumors. Caryn has even been accused of being a gold digger since Matt&#39;s net worth is reportedly around $4 million.

The couple returned to Oregon to reveal that Matt had decided to sell some of the farm, including the main house. The Little People, Big World star announced that neither of his sons wanted to buy him out, leaving him no other choice but to sell. While this news was sad, it seemed it was the only option for the Roloffs. Hopefully, Little People Big World will give viewers more insight into the family dynamics currently at play and how they might affect Matt and Caryn&#39;s relationship going forward.
