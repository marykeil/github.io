## Literature Review
Side characters in anime often steal the show from the main cast. Many have acquired a large enough fan base to warrant their own series.




It&#39;s no exaggeration that many anime side characters deserve their own spinoff. In spite of their limited screen time, these characters are often just as interesting as the main cast. Something as simple as an iconic appearance, scene, or catchphrase can be enough to endear fans to side characters. Just as frequently, they pose interesting questions or create enough intrigue to make fans want more.
One of the best things about anime is that side characters are often given as much love and care as the main cast. They aren&#39;t simply random extras in the background; they actively contribute to the life and color of the show. When an anime creator invests just as much time in a background character as a protagonist, that dedication shines through and makes fans love the series more than they already do.









 








 10  Kaidou&#39;s Battles With the Dark Reunion Would Add Even More Hilarity to Saiki&#39;s World 
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K (2016)
        

Kaidou Shun is one of the silliest characters in the Saiki K universe, and that&#39;s saying something. He&#39;s convinced that the world&#39;s events are controlled by an evil entity known as the Dark Reunion, and that he alone is capable of stopping them. He even wears bandages on his hands to hold back the full extent of the magical powers he doesn&#39;t have. A spinoff series where Kaidou faces off against the Dark Reunion, whether in reality or in his mind, would make for an incredibly funny watch. Bonus points if the show still featured Kusuo Saiki&#39;s dry commentary.

 9  Fukuma is Bone-Chillingly Creepy and Memorable 
The Vampire Dies in No Time (2021)
        

The Vampire Dies in No Time is one of the best anime on Crunchyroll, and Fukuma is one of its best characters. An editor at Autumn Books, his life is far from that of an office drone. His client, Ronaldo, often procrastinates on his vampire-hunting autobiography, which means Fukuma must take drastic measures to ensure Ronaldo meets his deadlines. From wielding an axe to having a generally threatening aura, Fukuma instills fear in those around him, especially Ronaldo. A spinoff series about his daily life, or even his obsession with cats, would be sure to delight fans of the series.

 8  Ginoza&#39;s Time in the Hospital Was Never Fully Addressed 
Psycho-Pass (2012)
        

Equal parts cool and sensitive, Ginoza Nobuchika is an underrated favorite for fans of Psycho-Pass. When his father was killed at the end of Season One and Ginoza&#39;s crime coefficient skyrocketed, he was hospitalized, appearing again in Season Two with a new hairstyle but not much information on what happened during his quarantine. Given the Sibyl System&#39;s corrupt nature and the alarming emotional state Ginoza was in, a spinoff series about what happened between seasons would answer many burning questions. It&#39;s no surprise that fans of the series appreciate deep dives into character psychology, and there is so much of Ginoza&#39;s interiority worth exploring.

 7  Clow Reed is the Most Mysterious Character in the CLAMP Universe 
Cardcaptor Sakura (1998)
        

The manga artists collective known as CLAMP loves a good crossover, which means the mysterious wizard Clow Reed has made appearances throughout many of their works. Most notably, he is the creator of the Clow Cards that ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto must capture in her eponymous series. Not much is known about Clow Reed personally, especially his time before Sakura when he lived with his creations, the ever-squabbling Kero and Yue. A spinoff series exploring Clow&#39;s ancient past and the dynamic he has with his magical &#34;children&#34; would delight CLAMP fans well-versed in the series&#39; lore.

 6  Kikaku is About Three Seconds from a Mental Breakdown at All Times 
Life Lessons With Uramichi-Oniisan (2021)
        

Hanbee Kikaku is the poster child for the overworked millennial. He works in the merchandising department for a public television company, and though his appearance would suggest emotional instability, he&#39;s really just passionate about his work. Even so, Uramichi Omota fears him, perhaps because he&#39;s always designing new plushies that feature Uramichi in embarrassing outfits from his show. An exploration of Kikaku&#39;s high-intensity work model, or even some glimpses into his life off the clock, would add even more hilarity to one of the best low-stakes anime.

 5  Ragnar Saw His Fair Share of Court Drama While Raising Canute 
Vinland Saga (2019)
        

Many Vinland Saga characters deserve their own spinoff series, but none quite so much as the overbearing but well-meaning Ragnar. The attendant and father figure to Prince Canute, Ragnar witnessed turmoil in the Danish court that caused Canute to grow up timid. A spinoff that explored the court drama, from Ragnar&#39;s point of view, would have twists and turns to rival Game of Thrones. Watching Ragnar interact with Canute&#39;s elder brother, Harold, and the ruthless King Sweyn would also be captivating. After his untimely death in Season One, a Ragnar-centric series could even be cathartic for grieving fans.

 4  Olivier is One of the Toughest Women in Anime 
Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2009)


 







Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood has been praised for its strong and three-dimensional female characters, and Olivier Mira Armstrong is no exception. The terrifying commander of Fort Briggs, Olivier doesn&#39;t settle for mediocrity, least of all from Colonel Mustang or the Elric brothers. Many fans have speculated whether she even has a softer side, which would be great fodder for a spinoff series. An exploration of Olivier&#39;s relationship with her brother, Alex, or her daily life managing her troops would also be compelling to watch. At the end of the day, Olivier is an immensely popular side character, often ranking alongside Riza Hawkeye and Winry Rockbell as one of FMA&#39;s top women.

 3  The Body Improvement Club Are Wholesome Fan Favorites 
Mob Psycho 100 (2016)
        

First impressions would suggest that the Body Improvement Club is high-intensity and cutthroat, but they are completely the opposite. In fact, they are some of the most wholesome characters in the Mob Psycho 100 universe, helping Mob to build confidence and encouraging him to do his best. Mob may be nowhere near their level physically, but that doesn&#39;t stop them from radiating positivity and subverting stereotypes about jocks. A major theme of the series is that intentions and actions mean more than labels or innate abilities, and the Body Improvement Club could not exemplify that message more.

 2  The Shitennou are Some of Sailor Moon&#39;s Most Iconic Rivals 
Sailor Moon (1992, 2014)


 







Led by Queen Beryl, the Shitennou (or &#34;Four Heavenly Kings&#34;) were the first rivals to appear in Sailor Moon and arguably the most fabulous. Jadeite, Nephrite, Kunzite, and Zoisite all have distinct motives and personalities. In other words, watching their interactions together as well as with the Sailor Guardians is neverending fun. Anime fans looking for LGBTQ&#43; representation can look no further than Kunzite and Zoisite, who were heavily queer-coded, but only in the 90s anime. The Shitennou steal the show and are quite simply no-brainers when it comes to side characters who deserve a spinoff series.

 1  Kaworu Changed Shinji&#39;s Life Despite His Brief Screen Time 
Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995)


 







Kaworu Nagisa only appeared in one episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but his impact cannot be overstated. Though Kaworu is controversial, he often ranks alongside Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu as the most popular character in the series. In addition to being philosophical and serene in an almost otherworldly manner, he&#39;s one of the only people who made Shinji feel loved. For this reason, it&#39;s clear that Kaworu has a human side, even though he is actually an Angel. Fans of complex and purposefully ambiguous characters are sure to love Kaworu just as much as Shinji does.
