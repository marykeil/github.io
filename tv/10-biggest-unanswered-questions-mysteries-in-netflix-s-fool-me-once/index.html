<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Harlan Coben&rsquo;s Fool Me Once solved many of the mysteries the limited series introduced, but various other questions remained unanswered.</p>
<p>Warning! SPOILERS about Fool Me Once ahead.
Netflix’s Fool Me Once solved plenty of the mysteries that accumulated through the years in Maya’s life, but some questions remained unanswered in the rush of concluding the thriller’s main storylines in Fool Me Once episode 8. Based on the Harlan Coben mystery novel of the same name, Fool Me Once’s ending managed to wrap up most loose ends concerning Joe’s murder, Claire’s murder, how much the Burketts knew about Joe’s past affairs, and how all murders and mysteries fitted together. However, Fool Me Once episode 8 also consistently left some things unsaid about a couple of central characters and most secondary ones.
Maya’s investigation into her sister Claire’s death right after her husband’s death should have easily predicted her confession in Fool Me Once’s ending, but the many inconsistencies about much that she uncovered easily let some mysteries be forgotten. Whether they stemmed from the reasoning behind the Burketts’ choices that Fool Me Once didn’t explain or the ending to Maya’s story being delivered so fast that the limited series didn’t have time to focus on other characters, the mysteries were various and of different weight. Despite the novel potentially dispelling some ofthe mysteries, various questions remain unanswered as the characters involved are either less important or nonexistent in the book.</p>
<p>1  Shane&rsquo;s Suspicious Behavior Throughout Fool Me Once
The show never said why Shane followed Maya</p>
<p>While Shane proved a loyal friend to Maya, helping her out whether it meant caring for Lily or doing background checks on people, his behavior was at times disturbing in Fool Me Once. From waiting for her in Maya’s own home to tracking her whereabouts and lurking outside her home to spy on her, many of Shane’s behaviors went unexplained in the Netflix limited series. Coben’s novel had Shane admit he followed Maya when she faced the book counterparts of Luka and Izabella because he was worried about her erratic behavior, but nothing like that was shared in Fool Me Once and Shane’s most confusing mystery behavior was never explained.</p>
<p>2  Sami&rsquo;s Symptoms After Stopping Taking Burkett Drugs
Fool Me Once&rsquo;s ending never said if his symptoms got better</p>
<p>Fool Me Once easily sorted out Sami Kierce’s illness when he understood that the drugs he was taking were made by the Burketts’ corrupted pharmaceutical company, making his weird symptoms probably a side effect of the defective drugs. However, while Fool Me Once heavily implied he would have stopped taking the drugs, he also shared that his symptoms might have stayed the same because of how long he took them. While Fool Me Once’s 18-years-later last scene evidently revealed Sami lived much longer than expected, it never unveiled whether his symptoms got better after he stopped taking the Burkett drugs.</p>
<p>Where Was Fool Me Once Filmed? Netflix Thriller&rsquo;s Filming Locations Explained
The Netflix mystery drama series Fool Me Once revolves around the unexpected reappearance of a widow’s dead husband – where was the show filmed?</p>
<p>3  Maya&rsquo;s Plan Against The Burketts&rsquo; Consequences
Maya didn&rsquo;t seem to want to leave Lily to others - did she willingly go to her death?</p>
<p>To assuage Sami’s guilt CoreyTheWhistle said Maya knew what she was doing, and by bringing a gun to the Burketts, she must have predicted the outcome of her death, according to the whistleblower. Despite Maya’s letters to all her loved ones, she never really shared with them if she meant for the Burketts to kill her as the world watched the live feed, making her planning remain a mystery, irreconcilable with her unwillingness to separate herself from Lily and her family. However, Maya leaves her gun in the car in the Fool Me Once novel, making her murder all Neil’s idea, as he kills her with his own gun.</p>
<p>4  The Real Reason Behind Tommy Dark&rsquo;s Murder
Why Joe killed him after the Burketts paid for Dark&rsquo;s silence for 25 years?</p>
<p>Many of Fool Me Once’s cast of characters were in the Burketts’ pockets and the 25 years of payments from the Burketts to Tommy Dark proved he would have not revealed anything if they kept paying him. However, Joe still went out of his way to kill Dark off once Claire got close to him, even though Fool Me Once never revealed whether Claire actually got the truth of Andrew’s murder from Dark. The private investigator’s death cannot be motivated unless Joe only killed him because of his bloodlust, as Dark didn’t have a reason to betray the Burketts who paid him, but Fool Me Once never revealed Joe’s motive.</p>
<p>5  Joe&rsquo;s True Motive For Killing Claire
If he wanted to protect the Burketts why did he contact CoreyTheWhistle?</p>
<p>Fool Me Once episode 8 had Judith reveal to Maya that Joe killed Claire because she had stolen files from them, and he was only trying to protect the Burkett family name. However, if that was the case, Corey wouldn’t have believed Joe to be in cahoots with Claire against the Burketts. While Joe might have wanted to meet Corey only to kill him, he still talked to him long enough to let the whistleblower believe that he wanted to be on the right side of history against the Burketts, thus making Joe’s motive for killing Claire unclear, unless he only wanted to because of his willingness to shed blood.</p>
<p>6  The Meaning Behind Lily&rsquo;s Unusual Actions
She went close to bushes &amp; kept saying &ldquo;Dada&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Izabella and Luka admitted to creating a deepfake of Joe to mess with Maya’s head under Judith’s orders, their commitment still doesn’t explain why Lily would not give a straight answer to Maya’s questions about Joe’s supposed visit. Coupled with Lily’s weird moment where she shouted “Dada” in episode 6, there are various behaviors of Lily&rsquo;s that Fool Me Once never explains. The Fool Me Once novel isn’t much clarifying on the matter, as Lily never made such puzzling comments in the book.</p>
<p>10 Best TV Shows Like Fool Me Once
Though Fool Me Once won&rsquo;t get a second season on Netflix, multiple other dramas and thrillers exist that offer a similar storyline and themes.</p>
<p>7  Caroline&rsquo;s Participation In Judith&rsquo;s Scheme To Catch Maya In A Lie
She was shocked to learn about Joe&rsquo;s killing spree &amp; didn&rsquo;t know Sami&rsquo;s involvement wasn&rsquo;t true</p>
<p>Caroline was the one to instill the doubt in Maya’s mind that DS Kierce might have been working for the Burketts, and her doubts about not being fully sure Andrew and Joe were dead because she never saw their bodies only made her lies more believable. However, when Maya confronted the Burketts about their lies and shared that Joe was a killer, murdering Thomas Mora, Tommy Dark, her sister Claire, and his own brother Andrew, Caroline was shocked, as she didn’t know that Judith wasn’t really bribing DS Kierce. Their confrontation in Fool Me Once episode 8 never clarified what dirty work Caroline did to follow her mother’s plan.</p>
<p>8  Sami&rsquo;s Employment After His Plans To Go After The Burketts With Maya
Sami was already suspended because of PJ&rsquo;s fall – did helping Maya lead to his firing?</p>
<p>PJ’s fall from the roof only to help Sami and his dizziness resulted in Sami’s suspension, as his professional choices had long been terrible ones, because of his health problems and his wish to keep them secret. While his suspension didn’t stop Sami from investigating Joe’s murder, he also evidently helped Maya even after he discovered she killed Joe, as he wanted just as much revenge over the Burketts as her, given that their drugs caused his health problems.
Fool Me Once’s ending never revealed whether Sami stayed a police officer after he, Corey, and Maya made Burketts’ corruption known. While it could have been possible, especially as Sami worked behind the scenes with Corey to set up the live feed, making his involvement not as evident as Maya’s, Fool Me Once doesn’t clarify his fate. The Fool Me Once novel doesn’t either, as Detective Kierce never worked with Maya or was sick because of the Burketts’ drugs in the book, thus making him not part of Maya’s plan, as that was Shane’s role in the original novel.</p>
<p>9  Marty&rsquo;s Involvement In Closing Joe Burkett&rsquo;s Death Investigation
Sami worked with Corey &amp; Maya to unveil the Burkett&rsquo;s corruption</p>
<p>Before helping Maya expose the Burketts’ lies, Sami shared with his partner Marty that he knew Maya had killed Joe. However, Fool Me Once’s ending never shared whether Marty attempted to bring Maya to justice, as the story’s epilogue put all criminals in the same room at the Burkett Estate without the police’s presence. This mystery cannot be solved by the book, as Marty was an original character in the TV adaptation because Detective Kierce never had a partner in the novel. With Marty nonexistent and Kierce a smaller character in the novel, it’s also impossible to know who brought the Burketts to justice after Fool Me Once’s ending.</p>
<p>Netflix&rsquo;s Fool Me Once Popularity Is A Reminder To Watch Canceled Amazon Mystery Show From Last Year
After watching Fool Me Once, one of the most popular Netflix series of the new year, one Amazon Harlan Corben series is the perfect follow-up.</p>
<p>10  Luka &amp; Izabella&rsquo;s Fate After Their Encounter With Maya
They were left by the side of the road &amp; always worked with the Burketts who were now in disgrace</p>
<p>While Shane left Luka and Izabella by the side of the road in Fool Me Once episode 8, their fate after they shared the truth with Maya is unknown. Their relationship with the Burketts was closer as Izabella’s family always worked for them, and they clearly proved their loyalty. Despite that, Maya’s stunt made sure the Burketts would have never had power or influence after the truth came to the surface, making their future employment with the Burketts unlikely. The Fool Me Once book doesn’t solve this mystery either, as Shane only keeps an eye on them so that they can’t warn Judith about Maya knowing the whole truth.</p>
