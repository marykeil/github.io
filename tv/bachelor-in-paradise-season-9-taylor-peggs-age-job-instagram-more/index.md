## Literature Review
Former Bachelorette suitor Taylor Pegg is a late addition to the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 cast. There&#39;s a lot fans should know about him.




Bachelor in Paradise season 9 welcomed Taylor Pegg to the beach during episode 8, and there&#39;s a lot to know about this new suitor. Taylor got his Bachelor Nation start on Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season. On premiere night, Taylor made a strong first impression when he exited the limousine to meet Charity with a GoPro camera. He filmed the moment, saying, &#34;All right, kids, I&#39;m meeting your mom for the first time.&#34; It was a sweet How I Met Your Mother reference. However, Charity eliminated him later that night. He had so little airtime that Bachelor in Paradise referred to him as &#34;Charity&#39;s Background Extra&#34; in his bio caption.




On Bachelor in Paradise season 9, Taylor arrived on the beach with Jordan Vandergriff from Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey&#39;s Bachelorette season. Taylor said that he was super excited to be on the beach. Host Jesse Palmer told them that a date card would be handed out, and they should head down to the beach, have a bunch of conversations, and try their best to form real connections. Taylor said that if he got the date card, he&#39;d want to take Mercedes Northup on the date, but Jordan received it instead. Here’s what to know about Taylor.
