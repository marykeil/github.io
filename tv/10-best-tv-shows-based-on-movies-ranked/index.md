# 10 Best TV Shows Based On Movies, Ranked


## SUMMARY 


 Some of the most amazing TV shows are actually remakes of mediocre films, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 
 It&#39;s the on-screen execution that matters most, not the origin of the idea, as seen in shows like Teen Wolf and 12 Monkeys. 
 Even cult classics like The Lion King and Beetlejuice have lesser-known TV series adaptations that add depth and entertainment to the original stories.

## Literature Review
Surprisingly, some of the best TV shows, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, aren&#39;t exactly originals, as they are based on movies.




Ideas for TV shows can originate from lots of different places, such as movies, books, and comics, and it may come as a shock, but some of the most amazingly written series aren&#39;t based on brand new ideas. Even the hugely successful Buffy the Vampire Slayer was essentially a remake of the film of the same name, although it is worth noting that the Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie was awful in every sense of the word, and it was a miracle that a show turned things around for Buffy Summers&#39; story. The iconic horror fantasy series isn&#39;t the only example of a great TV remake of a mediocre film.
Sometimes, a cult classic movie can spawn a beautifully crafted show that gains a life of its own. For instance, Karate Kid&#39;s TV sequel, Cobra Kai, has been a worthy continuation of Johnny and Daniel&#39;s story so far, and Cobra Kai season 6&#39;s release is among the most highly anticipated premieres of 2024. When it comes to quality shows, it is not the origins of the idea that matter most, but its on-screen execution. In fact, there are quite a few thrilling series that borrowed the core concept or the characters from their respective movies.
            
 
 10 Classic Movies You Totally Forgot Had Sequels 
It may come as a shock, but cult classics like Grease, The Mask, and Donnie Darko have sequels, albeit lesser-known than the original movies.













 








 10  Teen Wolf (2011–2017) 
Based on Teen Wolf (1985)


 







 Teen Wolf 

 Cast   Holland Roden , Tyler Posey , Dylan Sprayberry , Melissa Ponzio , Tyler Hoechlin , Arden Cho , Crystal Reed , jr bourne , Shelley Hennig , Colton Haynes , Dylan O&#39;Brien , Linden Ashby    Seasons   6    




In the 2010s, MTV&#39;s Teen Wolf reignited the lost passion for supernatural narratives by adding a fresh perspective on the werewolf lore. The show was a success, even though it deteriorated in quality in the later seasons, once the new lore started getting out of hand. The series was inspired by the 1985 horror comedy flick, starring none other than Michael J. Fox. The Teen Wolf show and the movie&#39;s differences are undeniable, especially when it comes to the overall tone, Scott&#39;s werewolf origin story, and the way he approaches his condition. Still, both productions provide for a fun experience.





 9  12 Monkeys (2015–2018) 
Based on 12 Monkeys (1995)
        

Syfy&#39;s time-travel drama, 12 Monkeys, starring Aaron Stanford as James Cole, a man tasked with saving the planet from a deadly virus, ran for four successful seasons, enjoying critical acclaim all throughout and winning a few prestigious awards. The hit series was loosely adapted from the 1995 sci-fi thriller of the same name, where Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt played the lead roles. Much like its TV successor, 12 Monkeys was a critical darling, even getting a few nods at the Academy Awards. Both adaptations offer a fascinating time-travel story in the top sci-fi fashion, and 12 Monkeys&#39; ending is truly an emotional rollercoaster ride.





 8  The Lion King&#39;s Timon &amp; Pumbaa (1995–1999) 
Based on The Lion King (1994)
        

The Lion King was one of the highlights of the 1990s animation, and naturally, it spawned an entire franchise, although its sequels and prequels remain relatively unknown. One of them, The Lion King&#39;s Timon &amp; Pumbaa, is an underrated TV series about Simba&#39;s newfound pals, who taught him the Hakuna Matata approach to life. The show, which ran for three seasons, provided a deeper insight into Timon and Pumbaa&#39;s problem-free life and philosophy — their adventures were extremely entertaining to watch. Overall, The Lion King&#39;s Timon &amp; Pumbaa is a decent addition to the franchise.





 7  High School Musical: The Musical: The Series (2019–2023) 
Based on High School Musical (2006)
        

 High School Musical: The Musical: The Series 

 Cast   Olivia Rodrigo , Joshua Bassett , Matt Cornett , Larry Saperstein , Sofia Wylie , Julia Lester , Dara Renee , Frankie Rodriguez    Seasons   4    




High School Musical: The Musical: The Series is considered to be the modern Glee in the best sense of the word. Even though it is one of many continuations of the original 2006 High School Musical movie, which was the breakthrough role for Zac Efron, it has managed to find a footing of its own. The series separated itself from its legendary predecessor while still clearly being in the same universe as the High School Musical films. Coincidentally, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series also propelled its stars, especially Olivia Rodrigo, toward international fame.





 6  The Real Ghostbusters (1986–1991) 
Based on Ghostbusters (1984)
        

Ghostbusters jumpstarted an entire franchise, full of comics, games, TV shows, and remakes, but one particular series, The Real Ghostbusters stood out the most among all the Ghostbusters animated TV shows. The series continued the four Ghostbusters&#39; antics in a slightly more lighthearted and innocent way than the original movie did. It ran for seven seasons, although it was renamed as Slimer! and the Real Ghostbusters at the start of season 4. The Real Ghostbusters may be targeted at kids, but the show can easily interest older viewers as well.





 5  Cobra Kai (2018–) 
Based on The Karate Kid (1984)


 







 Cobra Kai 

 Cast   Tanner Buchanan , Xolo Mariduena , Mary Mouser , Connor Murdock , Ralph Macchio , Nichole Brown , Jacob Bertrand , Griffin Santopietro , William Zabka    Seasons   5    




Cobra Kai may have only been on air for five seasons so far, but it has established itself so well that it is easy to forget that the series is in fact a sequel to The Karate Kid film franchise from the 1980s. The show is every bit as gripping as the original movies, but there are a lot more comedic moments. Ralph Macchio and William Zabka have reprised their Karate Kid roles in Cobra Kai, and the series has been able to give more depth to both Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence. Cobra Kai is an example of a nostalgia-filled martial arts comedy-drama that hasn&#39;t allowed its narrative to get stale or dull.





 4  Beetlejuice (1989–1991) 
Based on Beetlejuice (1988)
        

While Beetlejuice 2&#39;s premiere is still a little while away, it may be time to remember Tim Burton&#39;s lesser-known Beetlejuice work, specifically the animated series of the same name. For four seasons, the sequel show explored Beetlejuice and Lydia Deetz&#39;s relationship and shared adventures both in the Neitherworld and the moral realm. Michael Keaton or Winona Ryder didn&#39;t return to voice their respective characters in the Beetlejuice series, but even without them, the show captured the magic and the atmosphere of the original horror comedy flawlessly.





 3  Fargo (2014–) 
Based on Fargo (1996)
        

 Fargo 

 Cast   Billy Bob Thornton , Allison Tolman , Martin Freeman , Kirsten Dunst , Patrick Wilson , Jesse Plemons , Ewan McGregor , Carrie Coon , Chris Rock , Jessie Buckley , Jason Schwartzman , Juno Temple , Jon Hamm    Seasons   5    




Over the years, Fargo became one of the best modern anthology series. Each season, the story takes place in a different era and location, and a new set of stars joins the narrative. Fargo has taken the finest elements of the 1996 movie and enriched the concept further in a way that pays a tribute to the Coen brothers&#39; masterpiece and explores a completely different universe at the same time. Following in the movie&#39;s footsteps, the Fargo series has been a critical darling for years — it has received over 200 awards and nominations since its premiere in 2014.





 2  Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series (2003–2006) 
Based on Lilo &amp; Stitch (2002)
        

Lilo &amp; Stitch is an enormous franchise, launched by the 2002 film of the same name. While the movie installments are rather well-known and universally beloved, the TV series remains generally overlooked and unfairly forgotten. Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series did the impossible in the sense that it replicated the film&#39;s high-spirited nature. The episodes feel like mini-feature movies, and the characters are as lively as they are in the initial story. A live-action remake is currently in development, and hopefully, it will turn out to be a worthy addition to the Lilo &amp; Stitch franchise.





 1  Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997–2003) 
Based on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992)


 







 Buffy The Vampire Slayer 

 Cast   Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters    Seasons   7    




Without Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the late 1990s and the early 2000s simply wouldn&#39;t have been the same. The vampire horror drama show has shaped an entire generation, and Buffy remains one of the most beloved TV characters of all time — not to mention, one of the most empowering female characters in TV history. As astounding as the success of the Buffyverse has been, none of it would have been possible if it hadn&#39;t been for the 2002 flick that the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series was inspired by. The movie may be campy, but it gave the world one of the most influential shows in recent history.
