# Netflixs One Piece Fixed The Most Common Complaint About The Anime 24 Years Later


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix&#39;s One Piece is praised as one of the best live-action adaptations ever made, successfully addressing the common complaint of the anime&#39;s slow pacing when it comes to new audiences.   One Piece season 1 compressed the East Blue saga into eight hour-long episodes, allowing new audiences to jump into the series more quickly compared to the anime.   The live-action series made significant changes to the source material, but still achieved a satisfying and condensed version of the story, comparable to the Episode of East Blue film.

## Literature Review
Netflix’s live-action One Piece season 1 changed many elements from the manga, but it improved upon the most common One Piece anime criticism.




Netflix’s One Piece is one of the best live-action adaptations in Hollywood history, and it curiously fixed the most famous One Piece anime complaint. Tackling One Piece, one of the most influential and popular manga series ever made, in a live-action television show was no easy task. Even the One Piece anime, which has been on the air since 1999, often deals with criticisms regarding how it adapted certain portions of the manga. Fortunately, the live-action One Piece show had more positives than negatives.




With Netflix’s One Piece season 2 officially happening, the show confirms itself as the first truly successful live-action anime adaptation. The One Piece series will have the chance to continue covering the manga, whose best arcs are yet to be covered. One Piece season 1 worked for both long-time manga readers and new audiences, which is something the anime did not always accomplish.


 Netflix’s One Piece Season 1 Had Better Pacing Than Early One Piece Anime 
          

One of the most common One Piece criticisms is how difficult it is to get into the series, especially regarding the anime. Whereas the One Piece manga is very well-paced and goes from major story to major story in just a couple of chapters, the anime can often move very slowly. This is particularly true for the early One Piece episodes, especially the East Blue saga. It took roughly 60 episodes for the anime to cover the first five arcs from the manga, meaning it takes a lot of time to get through the story’s very first saga.





 

Netflix’s One Piece season 1 avoided that problem by compressing the East Blue saga in eight hour-long episodes. Naturally, the live-action One Piece series is a very different project from the anime. Whereas the One Piece anime is meant to faithfully adapt almost every page from the anime, the live-action show was meant to reimagine One Piece as a cinematic experience for TV. Still, when it comes to introducing One Piece to new audiences, One Piece season 1 did a great job regarding pacing. Rather than watching more than 20 hours of content to get through East Blue, those watching the live-action get ready for the Grand Line in eight hours.



 One Piece Season 1 Still Had To Cut A Lot To Fix The Anime’s Pacing 
          




To reimagine One Piece’s East Blue saga as an eight-hour television experience, the live-action series had to cut a lot from the source material. There are many differences between Netflix’s One Piece and the manga, from how fast characters meet each other to different arcs merging into one. For example, Don Krieg is killed off by Mihawk right after appearing for the first time, with Arlong fighting Luffy at the Baratie instead. Other examples are how the Usopp Pirates do not appear at all and how not much is shown about Nami’s past during the Cocoyasi Village episodes.

                  10 Live-Action One Piece Scenes We Can&#39;t Wait To See In Season 2   Netflix’s live-action One Piece sets the stage for Luffy’s journey in season 1, but season 2 will feature even more exciting anime scenes.    

One Piece season 1 is not nearly as faithful to the manga as the anime, which is not necessarily a problem. Regardless of the changes, what the live-action One Piece series accomplished is arguably a good replacement for the first 45 episodes of the anime. Perhaps the only other piece of One Piece content that achieved something similar is One Piece: Episode of East Blue, which condensed the East Blue saga into a 106-minute long film. How One Piece season 2 will compare with what comes next in the anime is difficult to say, but hopefully, the show will continue to have solid pacing without changing too much of the story.
