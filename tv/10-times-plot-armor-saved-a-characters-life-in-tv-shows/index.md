# 10 Times Plot Armor Saved A Characters Life In TV Shows


## SUMMARY 


 Showrunners often use plot armor to protect important characters, even in shows that claim &#34;anyone can die.&#34; 
 Plot armor allows characters like Bonnie Bennet, Eren Jaeger, and Jon Snow to survive situations they logically shouldn&#39;t. 
 Characters like Jim Hopper, Glenn Rhee, and June Osborne are saved from death due to their importance to the ongoing story.

## Literature Review
Most TV shows include at least some characters who are protected by plot armor and must survive because of their ongoing importance in the story.




Showrunners cannot afford to kill off a character when the story is dependent upon them, which is usually true in the case of a show&#39;s protagonists. However, sometimes a character&#39;s apparent plot armor is just lazy writing. While the audience probably knows that particular characters cannot die because they are framed as the protagonists, the show does not have to put them in situations they should not logically be able to survive.
Several recent shows have advertised themselves as having &#34;anyone can die&#34; settings, including Game of Thrones, Attack on Titan, and The Walking Dead. Yet even these series include a core group of characters with an unnatural ability to avoid death, at least for some time. On the other hand, some plots so adamantly ignore their own rules that fans can&#39;t help but point out the obvious plot armor.









 








 10  Bonnie Hangs Around Until She is Properly Resurrected 
The Vampire Diaries (2009-2017)


 







Bonnie dies close to the end of The Vampire Diaries season 4 when she uses too much power to resurrect Jeremy, and the effort kills her. However, Bonnie manages to hang around for several seasons after this. For the first part of season 5, she is a ghost only Jeremy can see. She then returns to the world of the living by becoming the “anchor” to the Other Side.
In season 6, Bonnie and Damon become trapped in a 90s purgatory, which they both eventually escape. After this, Bonnie is alive again with no strings attached. While Bonnie technically does die, she is not dead from a narrative standpoint. After the season 4 finale, Bonnie continues to be a regular part of the story and Kat Graham continues to be a regular on the show.





 9  Eren Survives Being Eaten By A Titan 
Attack On Titan (2013-2023)
        

Attack on Titan admittedly kills off a lot of characters, but Eren clearly needs to be there until the end. During his first battle, Eren is swallowed by a Titan when he saves Armin. The next few episodes are spent depicting the other characters fighting Titans to defend the Trost District. It is frustrating for the audience who knows that Eren must have survived because the main character is not going to die in episode 5. When the reveal that Eren survived by turning into a Titan himself comes, it is incredibly strange. It becomes less so as the Titans’ origins are further explained throughout the series.
            
 
 10 Saddest Attack on Titan Deaths, Ranked 
While the Attack on Titan anime features many of its characters meeting their tragic demise, some deaths are especially upsetting to watch.









 8  Walt And Jesse Escape A Drug Deal Gone Bad 
Breaking Bad (2008-2013)
        

Breaking Bad protagonists Walt and Jesse are consistently able to escape dire situations in their ongoing conflicts with their rivals in the drug trade. At the beginning of season 2, Walt and Jesse are held captive by Tuco but manage to escape moments before Walt&#39;s brother-in-law Hank arrives and kills Tuco. The fact that Jesse was supposed to die in season 1 demonstrates how showrunner Vince Gilligan envisioned a story where important characters could die – Jesse was even supposed to die in a botched drug deal like the one he and Walt escape. However, Aaron Paul&#39;s performance led to Jesse remaining a part of the show for all five seasons.





 7  Jon Snow Is Brought Back From The Dead 
Game Of Thrones (2011-2019)
        

Game of Thrones was advertised as a show where anyone could die, even the main characters. However, there was still much speculation about how Jon Snow would return after his death in the season 5 finale. It seemed like Jon was essential enough to the plot, and behind-the-scenes details also clued fans in. While death is final for almost every other character on Game of Thrones, Jon gets a pass because he needs to live out his role in the story. Similarly, the Lord of Light is supposed to enable Melisandre and other practitioners to resurrect people because they have a destiny to fulfill.





 6  Hopper Is Imprisoned In Russia 
Stranger Things (2016-2025)
        

In Stranger Things season 3&#39;s ending, the main characters’ plan to destroy the Russian Gate to the Upside Down goes wrong when Hopper is apparently killed in the explosion. However, many fans suspected that he had somehow survived, which was confirmed in the earliest teaser for Stranger Things season 4. Joyce and Hopper together create a balance between the adult and younger characters on the show, which wouldn&#39;t have worked as well if only Joyce remained. Hopper is revealed to have survived by jumping out of the blast radius in time, before being captured by the Russians and transported to a prison camp.





 5  The Butcher Is Stopped Before Killing Glenn 
The Walking Dead (2010-2022)
        

In The Walking Dead season 5 premiere, Rick, Daryl, Glenn, and Bob are all captured at Terminus, but the butcher who is planning to slit all their throats is interrupted moments before he kills Glenn. Therefore, Glenn lives to fight another day. The Walking Dead is also known for killing off prominent characters who are supposed to “be safe,” yet there are still moments where plot armor is obviously at work. Glenn is eventually killed off in the season 7 premiere.





 4  The Main Cast Survives Mordor&#39;s Creation 
The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power (2022-Present)


 







When Orodruin/Mount Doom erupts and creates Mordor in the final episodes of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 1, only a few people die in the explosion. The only main character who suffers any lasting damage is Queen Regent Miriel, who is blinded by the ash. Miriel and the other characters subsequently plan to lead their people to safety and return to fight in the future. Realistically, this type of explosion should have destroyed everything and everyone in the vicinity, including the nearby villages.





 3  Spike Is Impervious To Sunlight 
Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)
        

Buffy the Vampire Slayer establishes that it adheres to the traditional vampire rule that vampires burn up in the sun. However, Spike is too important of a character to be killed off so easily. In season 4, he acquires the Gem of Amara, a ring that protects him from sunlight à la The Vampire Diaries. Spike attempts to kill Buffy, but she manages to take the ring from him. Yet when she does, his fiery death is delayed long enough for him to get to safety. Other vampires in Buffy the Vampire Slayer burn up seconds after being caught in the sun. The only reason Spike survives this is because of plot armor.





 2  Arya Survives Being Stabbed 
Game Of Thrones (2011-2019)
        

While she falls under other characters’ protection from time to time, Arya Stark is mostly on her own for several seasons. The odds of a pre-teen girl with little combat training surviving on her own in the Game of Thrones world should be slim to none. But this is Arya, and the show needs her. This becomes especially apparent later in Arya’s solo journey when she is attacked by the Waif and stabbed several times. She manages to get away and is cared for by Lady Crane. It is worth pointing out that Jon dies in minutes from essentially the same injuries.
            
 
 10 Best Examples of Plot Armor in Game of Thrones 
There are a number of notable examples of plot armor in HBO&#39;s hit series Game of Thrones.









 1  June Is Not Punished As Other Characters Are 
The Handmaid&#39;s Tale (2017-Present)


 







Gilead&#39;s regime in The Handmaid’s Tale will kill or mutilate anyone who steps out of line, with especially harsh rules for women. They demonstrate their willingness when characters such as Janine, Emily, and Serena Joy are maimed for speaking out, having a forbidden relationship, and reading, respectively. However, the show’s main character June narrowly avoids punishment again and again. While The Handmaid&#39;s Tale effectively captures Gilead&#39;s cruel society, it does raise the question of why June is never killed when she actively rebels against the government. June and other main characters are protected by plot armor because the story revolves around them.
