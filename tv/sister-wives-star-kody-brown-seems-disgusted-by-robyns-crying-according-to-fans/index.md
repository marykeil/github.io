## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Kody Brown may have one wife left in his family, but according to fans of the show he&#39;s not happy with the way Robyn Brown behaves.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown may only have Robyn Brown left in his corner, but fans believe that he&#39;s beginning to feel disgusted by her behavior, especially her incessant crying. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, Kody&#39;s marital issues with his ex-wives Christine Brown, Janelle Brown, and Meri Brown were explored in-depth. After Christine chose to leave the family in 2021, Kody&#39;s behavior sparked issues with Janelle and Meri, as well as Robyn. In 2022, Janelle and Meri both separated from Kody, while Robyn stayed with her husband and marveled at how the family could have crumbled before her eyes, crying her way through nearly every conversation.




While Robyn and Kody are still married, fans are convinced that Kody is beginning to feel the ick when it comes to Robyn&#39;s behavior, especially the fact that she can&#39;t seem to stop crying over the family she feels she&#39;s lost. According to Reddit user u/GADR8543, during Sister Wives: Talk Back, &#34;Kody keeps looking at Robyn like this while she is “crying” watching herself hysterical at the end of the finale. He looks at the screen and then her like this several times. He looks disgusted.&#34;


 

Fans in the comments agreed that Kody looks over Robyn&#39;s behavior, with u/xxxspinxxx even explaining, &#34;He rolled his eyes at one of her &#34;That&#39;s not true&#34; moments while watching a clip. I think he&#39;s sick of, and probably confused by, her dramatics and that&#39;s part of what shows on his face here.&#34; While it&#39;s unclear if Kody would ever choose to leave her behind, his facial expressions are communicating his displeasure.





 Kody &amp; Robyn’s Sister Wives Relationship Explained 
          

While Kody and Robyn&#39;s relationship wasn&#39;t explored as heavily during Sister Wives season 18 as his others, the cracks in their marriage were clear as they shared their feelings. Kody had a hard time being present for Robyn, which led many to wonder if he was still invested in her. As explained by u/AAngile, &#34;The pattern is for Robyn to be the victim and then Kody to be her protector. If there are no other wives to victimize Robyn and the adult kids just keep their distance, then who will be blamed? Kody will not take any responsibility for his behavior, so he then cannot be her &#34;protector&#34;.&#34; 


 




Kody and Robyn&#39;s relationship is a difficult balance for the couple, who built their marriage with the expectation they wouldn&#39;t be dealing with a monogamous relationship. As Robyn has come to realize she&#39;s Kody&#39;s only remaining wife, which means she has to carry the burden of dealing with all of his most difficult emotions, it&#39;s become clear that she&#39;s having a harder time dealing with him. Kody, on the other hand, has messed up the other relationships in his life because of his romantic love for Robyn, but he understands that the complications that have come from his actions may not be easy to reconcile.

With Kody and Robyn figuring out how to navigate monogamy after decades of plural marriage, things won&#39;t be easy for the couple as they figure out how much of each other they can handle. Despite the fact that Robyn and Kody have always spent a lot of their time together, it&#39;s likely the first time they&#39;ve ever had to reconcile with the fact that they&#39;re each other&#39;s only confidant. With fans analyzing Kody&#39;s difficult facial expressions and angry outbursts, it seems possible that things may not be easy for the only remaining Sister Wives couple as they move into the next phase of their life together.
