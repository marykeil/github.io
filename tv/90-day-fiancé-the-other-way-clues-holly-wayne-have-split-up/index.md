90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 couple Holly Weeks and Wayne Cornish seem to have gone their separate ways. Holly is a 44-year-old from Ogden, Utah. She worked as a barber and flaunted her 70-inch-long hair during episode 1. Holly had two unsuccessful marriages in her past before she met Wayne on a Jehovah’s Witness dating website. Holly met Wayne in South Africa after a few months of video calling. Wayne proposed to Holly within three days of meeting each other.




Now that she was engaged, Holly moved to Johannesburg with her mom to marry Wayne within a week. Holly had concerns about staying in the country she felt was unsafe due to robberies and frequent power cuts at his house. Wayne is also facing a major financial crisis due to losses in his business. Nonetheless, the couple got married despite the challenges. Holly had spent a couple of months in South Africa after their wedding when she revealed she wanted to fly back home to the U.S. Wayne wasn’t happy with her decision to leave.

Recently, Holly shared a video on Instagram where she revealed her current whereabouts. Holly had compiled clips of the last three years of her life in “no particular order.” It also had moments that Holly spent with her father before he passed away. Holly’s fans sent their condolences in the comments, telling her she would be okay. However, one of her followers asked Holly, “Are you not in SA anymore? I thought you and Wayne made an amazing couple.” Holly then revealed she was in the U.S. &#34;for a funeral.”

Meanwhile, Wayne confirmed his current relationship status on Instagram as well. Wayne deleted his Instagram profile recently, but not before revealing several shocking secrets about his storyline with Holly. Reddit user 90daysfan managed to get a screenshot of Wayne’s interaction with the follower before deactivating his page. Wayne supposedly posted a video on November 6, 2023, claiming he was done with social media. He claimed he was never a Jehovah’s Witness and revealed that he was no longer with Holly. 






 Holly Has Two Failed Marriages; Is This Her Third? 
          

Considering Wayne’s comment, it can be assumed that Holly and Wayne aren’t together anymore. Before he left social media, Wayne was posting content from South Africa while Holly was back in the U.S. Being separated by distance could mean that Wayne never joined Holly in America. A divorce between them would mean it would be Holly’s third failed marriage. Holly was married for two months the first time, and her second marriage lasted 12 hours before she got it annulled. While it&#39;s unclear how long Holly and Wayne remained married, 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 will soon spill the details.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
