             American Idol   




During the first American Idol Disney Night, Katy dressed up as Snow White, wearing her iconic dress with her blue and red puffed sleeves and long yellow skirt. Katy wore a black wig for Snow White&#39;s raven hair, complete with her signature red headband. She also had Snow White&#39;s high white collar and red lips. Throughout the episode, she took on Snow White&#39;s persona, speaking in her sweet, high-pitched voice.



 American Idol Season 17 
Ursula the Sea Witch
          

During American Idol season 17, Katy turned things upside down and dressed as the villain Ursula the Sea Witch, the purple octopus from The Little Mermaid. Katy immersed herself in the costume, painting her face purple and carrying a glass of shrimp cocktail. She had Ursula&#39;s iconic white hair and blue eye shadow and wore the gold seashell necklace where she kept Ariel&#39;s voice. Katy&#39;s sparkly black and purple tentacles completed the ensemble.






 American Idol Season 18 
Mrs. Jumbo
          

American Idol season 18 was unprecedented because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The contestants performed from home while the judges critiqued their performances remotely. For the Disney episode, which was combined with a Mother&#39;s Day theme, Katy dressed up in an elephant costume as Mrs. Jumbo, the mother of Dumbo. Katy&#39;s dog, Nugget, even played the role of Dumbo. What made this moment even sweeter was that Katy was preparing for motherhood herself at the time because Katy was pregnant with her and Orlando Bloom&#39;s daughter, Daisy Dove.



 American Idol Season 19 
Tinker Bell
          




American Idol season 19 returned triumphantly to the studio when the performers could sing for live audiences again. Katy made everyone&#39;s wishes come true in her costume of Tinker Bell, the fairy from Peter Pan. She wore a short, glittery lime green dress with a matching purse and shoes. She also had iridescent fairy wings and carried a magic wand. With her blonde hair and pointy ears, Katy looked like Tinker Bell. She made the night so magical that everyone felt like the theater had been sprinkled with pixie dust.



 American Idol Season 20 
Ariel
          

Katy&#39;s season 20 costume was one of her most outrageous. She was dressed as Ariel from The Little Mermaid, complete with a seafoam green fin and a plastic wig that made it appear like Ariel&#39;s red locks were flowing in the water. She carried a fork, or, as Ariel would call it, a &#34;dinglehopper.&#34; Katy&#39;s fellow judges, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan, even had to wheel Katy onto the stage on a dolly because of her mermaid tail.




When she reached her seat, host Ryan Seacrest began to speak, but suddenly, there was a loud crash. Katy had fallen backward in her chair as it tipped over, but she was not injured. However, it was one of the most hilarious moments of the night. Later, Katy stayed in character and pretended to be a terrified Ariel when Top 10 finalist Nicolina performed villain Ursula&#39;s signature song, &#34;Poor Unfortunate Souls.&#34;



 American Idol Season 21 
Elastigirl
          

Katy Perry stole the show on American Idol&#39;s Disney Night as Elastigirl from The Incredibles in season 21, rocking a skintight red latex bodysuit, red wig, and signature black mask. The esteemed judge brought the superhero mom to life with accuracy and flair. It was great to see Katy continuing to go all out with the Disney theme night, which is fun for audiences.




American Idol Disney Night has gifted audiences with some of the most outstanding performances in the show&#39;s history. Katy&#39;s tradition of dressing up in Disney costumes has delighted fans for the past five years. No matter her role, Katy transforms the American Idol stage into the Happiest Place on Earth.
