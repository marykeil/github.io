## Literature Review
A massive twist concerning the Hollow Earth in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters carries surprising implications for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.




Warning: Spoilers for Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 




A massive twist in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 carries potentially massive implications for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. The penultimate episode of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 headed in a surprising direction after sending three of its characters into the hidden world of the Titans. In addition to providing an additional glimpse into the ecosystem of the Hollow Earth, the series tied this mysterious place to one of the show&#39;s biggest mysteries.

Ever since Kurt Russell&#39;s Lee Shaw first came onto the scene, there have been questions about the discrepancy between the actor&#39;s age and the character&#39;s. When it was acknowledged by other Monarch: Legacy of Monsters characters, it became apparent that there was a specific, narrative reason why Shaw doesn&#39;t have the physical appearance of a man born in 1924. As it turns out, Shaw looks 20 years younger than his actual age because he was trapped in the Hollow Earth between 1962 and 1982. But for Shaw personally, it felt as if hardly any time at all had passed.





 Time Working Differently In The Hollow Earth Can Complicate Godzilla X Kong&#39;s Story 
          

As Shaw explained to May, time works very differently in the Hollow Earth. The fact that he was only there for an extremely short period but missed out on 20 years on the surface says a lot about the risks that come with exploring the Hollow Earth. This new addition to the Monsterverse lore could be of great consequence to Godzilla x Kong&#39;s story, especially when considering how important the Hollow Earth will be. The Godzilla x Kong trailer and synopsis have made no secret of the role it&#39;ll play in the story.

Characters finding that signigicant chunks of time have gone by without their notice every time they leave the Hollow Earth would naturally have a big impact on any efforts they&#39;re making to prevent a Titan threat. Factoring in this rule could prove problematic if the movie tells dual storylines on the surface and in the Hollow Earth. But while this could pose a problem for the narrative, there&#39;s also the possibility that it will serve the story in some way. For example, time passing slowly in the Hollow Earth could allow the movie to work in a big time jump once Kong and the humans return to the surface.






 How Godzilla X Kong Can Avoid The Hollow Earth&#39;s New Time Rules 
          

Rather than make it a part of the story, Godzilla x Kong could choose not to acknowledge the new reveal. As for how the movie could go that route without it being a plot hole, the show may have hinted at the explanation when Lee Shaw mentioned that the Titans&#39; world is made up of many &#34;realms.&#34; In other words, time may only move slowly in the corner of the Hollow Earth seen in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters - not whatever regions are featured in Godzilla x Kong. That being the case could also account for why it didn&#39;t influence Godzilla vs. Kong.
