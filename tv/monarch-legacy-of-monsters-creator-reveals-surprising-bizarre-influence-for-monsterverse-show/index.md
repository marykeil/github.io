Chris Black: If I took one takeaway from the two seasons I spent on Desperate Housewives, it&#39;s [that] secrets are great engines for story. It&#39;s just fun. It pulls you forward. It pulls you, as an audience, in. You want to know what&#39;s going on, you want to know what those secrets are, [and] you want to know what characters are hiding. Itâ€™s such incredibly fertile ground for drama.
