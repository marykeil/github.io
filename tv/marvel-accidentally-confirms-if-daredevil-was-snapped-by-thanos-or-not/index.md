Maya Lopez&#39;s fight with Daredevil in Marvel&#39;s Echo  reveals whether Matt Murdock was snapped by Thanos during the events of Avengers: Infinity War, thus debunking a popular MCU fan theory about Kingpin. Marvel&#39;s Echo continues to integrate Netflix&#39;s Marvel shows into the MCU&#39;s chronological timeline, as it confirms that Daredevil and Kingpin&#39;s shared history has taken place within the MCU all along. With Maya Lopez&#39;s MCU backstory being tied to Kingpin and Echo fighting Hawkeye during her MCU debut, the indigenous warrior has become the bridge between the MCU&#39;s Avengers and Netflix&#39;s street-level characters.

Marvel&#39;s Echo confirms that Maya Lopez had already fought Daredevil some time before meeting Clint Barton and Kate Bishop. As it stands, the events of all three Daredevil seasons seem to be part of MCU canon, which in turn confirms that Kingpin, Daredevil, and the rest of the characters from Netflix&#39;s Marvel shows have experienced events like Thanos&#39; Snap and the five-year Blip that followed it. Daredevil&#39;s short appearance in Echo also provides some subtle new details about Wilson Fisk&#39;s return, which could be key to understand Kingpin&#39;s MCU future after Echo&#39;s post-credits scene.





 When Echo Fights Daredevil In The MCU Timeline 
          

Set after the events of Hawkeye, Echo takes place in the MCU&#39;s present day â€” May 2025. However, Echo also features several flashbacks to Maya Lopez&#39;s childhood, her time with Wilson Fisk, her confrontation with Clint Barton, and her run-in with Daredevil. Maya&#39;s fight with Daredevil in Echo episode 1 takes place before Maya left the Tracksuit Mafia and shot Kingpin, but after Ronin killed her father, which was a direct result of Clint Barton&#39;s quest for justice following Thanos&#39; Snap. This means that Matt Murdock was active as Daredevil during the Blip, and his fight with Echo happened at some point between 2018 and 2025.

                  Marvel&#39;s Echo Ending Explained   Marvel&#39;s Echo ends with an epic finale episode, featuring Maya Lopez as she finally chooses which legacy she truly belongs to in the MCU.    






 Daredevil Not Being Snapped By Thanos Debunks Popular Fan Theory 
          

A popular Avengers: Infinity War fan theory involving Kingpin proposed the idea that Wilson Fisk rose back to power after the events of the Daredevil season 3 finale thanks to Thanos&#39; Snap. According to the theory, the chaos that ensued allowed Kingpin to break out of prison and use his influence to regain power while the authorities were busy dealing with the consequences of the Snap. Most importantly, Kingpin was supposed to achieve this because Daredevil wasn&#39;t around to send him back to prison. But given that Echo seemingly confirms that Daredevil survived Thanos&#39; Snap, it&#39;s safe to say that Kingpin&#39;s freedom never depended on Matt Murdock.

Although the MCU ignores the interesting scenarios Daredevil&#39;s absence during the Blip could have entailed, the fact that Daredevil spent five years fighting crime in a post-apocalyptic world provides plenty of material for the MCU&#39;s upcoming Daredevil: Born Again to play with. There are five years&#39; worth of character development for both Kingpin and Daredevil that the MCU can still explore. Thanks to Echo, the Blip creates the perfect reason for Matt Murdock&#39;s conclusive victory in Daredevil season 3 to be undone so he can fight Kingpin once again.
