## Literature Review
The Mandalorian season 3 introduced the Living Waters of Mandalore, and these are far more important to the future of Star Wars than you think.




The Mandalorian season 3 introduced the Living Waters of Mandalore, a sacred place for the Mandalorians - and important setup for the future. When Din Djarin met with the Armorer in The Book of Boba Fett, she seemed to sense that something was wrong with him. The Armorer challenged him over whether he had ever removed his helmet in front of another person; when Din Djarin admitted he had done so, she declared him an outcast from the Children of the Watch because of his sin. There was only one way Din Djarin could be redeemed; by bathing in the Living Waters beneath the mines of Mandalor.




Oddly enough, it’s only possible for viewers to truly appreciate the significance of the Living Waters if they have a familiarity with the concepts and ideas that inspired Star Wars’ Mandalorian culture. The Mandalorians are heavily influenced by Jewish culture and history, with the Purge of Mandalore serving as a mirror of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD. The Mandalorians are therefore best viewed as a diaspora people, and - given the term &#34;Living Waters&#34; is Biblical - Old Testament prophecies are important to understanding the Living Waters.

                  The Mandalorian Season 4 Updates: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know   After The Mandalorian season 3’s conclusion in 2023, the story of The Mandalorian season 4 is shaping up to be one of the show’s biggest yet.    


 Star Wars’ Living Waters Explained 
          




Mandalorian culture is centered on beskar, the rare and precious alloy that is forged into their armor and weapons. It comes as no surprise, then, that the Mandalorian capital city of Sundari was established over the richest beskar mines on the planet. The Living Waters - a vast subterranean pool, possibly even an ocean - are found beneath these mines.

The Living Waters have become a sacred place for the Mandalorians. They practice what is essentially a baptism ritual in these waters, symbolically washing away their sins and emerging to new life. This is why Din Djarin could only be redeemed at the Living Waters; although initiation rituals had moved away from these specific waters after the Purge of Mandalore, redemption is only possible at this sacred place.

                  The Mandalorian Season 3 Ending Explained   The Mandalorian season 3 has come to an end with an action-packed finale, complete with more than a few surprise twists and teases for the future.    






 The Living waters Are Tied To The First Mandalorian Jedi - And The Mythosaur 
          

There’s evidence the Living Waters are tied to Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian Jedi. Most famous for his use of the Darksaber, the lightsaber he forged that has a unique black blade, he also tamed the Mythosaur - a legendary beast that became the symbol of Mandalorian civilization. The Mandalorian season 3 revealed Mythosaurs still sleep in the depths of the Living Waters.

According to the Armorer, there is an ancient prophecy of a new Mandalorian ruler, or Mand’alor, who will unite the tribes and reclaim their barren homeworld. This Mand’alor will herald the Age of the Mythosaur, riding this great beast to battle. Lucasfilm’s merchandise has confirmed Bo-Katan is now considered to be the Mandalorian Mand’alor, so it’s reasonable to assume she will be the one who eventually rides the Mythosaur. She already saw one of these creatures when she plunged into the Living Waters to save Din Djarin’s life in The Mandalorian season 3, clearly setting this up.






 Old Testament Prophecies Hint At The Living Waters’ Role In Future Star Wars Stories 
          

Most readers also familiar with Scripture will be familiar with the term “living waters” from the New Testament, where Jesus uses it when speaking to a Samaritan woman (John 4: 10). But because Mandalorian culture is inspired by Judaism rather than Christianity, the concept can realistically only be understood with reference to the prophecies of Jeremiah and Zechariah. These are the inspiration for Jesus’ term, and they&#39;re crucial for interpreting it in relation to the Mandalorians.

In Jeremiah 2: 13 and 17: 13, God declares Himself “the spring of living water.” Zechariah builds upon this by foretelling a day when living water will flow from Jerusalem out into the land of Israel, bringing life to the desert. Like Sundari, Jerusalem is situated on an aquifer, with its inhabitants flourishing because they draw from deep wells; these prophecies thus predict a day of dramatic change, when mountains will be leveled and the waters will burst forth as a flowing river.




The Mythosaur prophecy is surely drawing on this imagery. Mandalore is a barren world, but life continues to flourish beneath the planet’s surface, sustained by the Living Waters. The Age of the Mythosaur is presumably one in which war will come to Mandalore once again, with mountains leveled in the conflict and the Living Waters breaking to the surface once again. The Mand’alor - likely Bo-Katan - will ride the Mythosaur to battle on that day, defeating her enemies - and leaving the planet forever changed, with water now on the surface, Mythosaurs swimming freely, and life flourishing. It seems likely this will happen in The Mandalorian movie, the culmination of Lucasfilm’s current plans for this part of Star Wars history, foreshadowed in this wonderfully subtle way.
