## Literature Review
One criticism of The Last of Us season 2 will undoubtedly get hurled at Abby actress Kaitlyn Dever, but it actually doesn&#39;t make sense.




Kaitlyn Dever has been cast as Abby in The Last of Us season 2, and concept art for the character proves why Dever&#39;s casting is perfect. Kaitlyn Dever is an immensley popular actor, with her being one of the names that has been fancasted as Abby ever since HBO&#39;s The Last of Us was first announced. Abby is an incredibly controversial character, with Kaitlyn Dever&#39;s casting as the character already causing some unfair criticisms to be hurled at the actress. However, these The Last of Us criticisms don&#39;t make any sense, as Abby&#39;s concept art shows that Dever can work as the character.




HBO&#39;s The Last of Us is the critically-acclaimed live-action adaptation of the beloved video game of the same name, with season 1 adapting the first entry in the franchise. The Last of Us is considered to be one of the best live-action video game adaptations of all time, and due to this massive success, The Last of Us season 2 will be adapting the second game, The Last of Us Part II. This means that ll kinds of unique characters from The Last of Us Part II will appear in the upcoming season of the HBO series, including the game&#39;s main villain Abby.

                  The Last Of Us Season 2: New Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey will return for a second season of HBO&#39;s The Last of Us, which adapts the successful video game franchise.    


 Original TLOU Game Concept Art Shows Kaitlyn Dever Is A Lot  r To Abby 
          




One of the main criticisms of The Last of Us season 2&#39;s Abby casting has to do with Kaitlyn Dever&#39;s physical appearance, but the game&#39;s original concept art actually proves that Dever is closer to Abby than one might think. In The Last of Us Part II, Abby is absolutely massive, with her apparent strength being one of her primary physical characteristics. Some fans have claimed that Dever isn&#39;t muscular enough to play the part, but they are looking at it from the wrong angle.

The Last of Us Part II concept art shows that Abby wasn&#39;t initially envisioned as incredibly muscular, with her instead having a much more average build (via Reddit). Kaitlyn Dever could easily pull off this look, as being muscular doesn&#39;t have anything to do with what makes Abby such a great character. Even if The Last of Us season 2 goes with a look similar to the game, however, there is still plenty of time for Dever to train.



 Kaitlyn Dever&#39;s Casting Is About More Than Just Looks (&amp; Why She&#39;ll Nail It) 
         




Kaitlyn Dever&#39;s casting as Abby in The Last of Us Part II is about more than just looks, and she&#39;ll still nail it even if she doesn&#39;t look exactly like Abby from the games. Abby is an incredibly complex character, with players first hating her before coming to sympathize with her. Kaitlyn Dever is perfect at playing roles that are both tough and vunerable, meaning that she can perfectly pull off The Last of Us season 2&#39;s most controversial character.

While Abby is strong, her physical appearance is not necessary for the story of The Last of Us Part II. Abby&#39;s story has nothing to do with her physical strength, with her complexity being much more important to her arc. Abby&#39;s story can be pulled off no matter what the actress looks like, which is why Kaitlyn Dever is a great pick for The Last of Us season 2.
