# Shailene Woodley Explains How Big Little Lies Season 3 Delay Opens The Door For Potential Story Arc


## SUMMARY 



  The delay in Big Little Lies season 3 allows for the exploration of how the characters have grown up, per Shailene Woodley.   The focus could shift to the younger actors.   Taking the show in an unexpected direction and avoiding backlash from season 2 may be a good approach for season 3.

## Literature Review
Big Little Lies star Shailene Woodley, who played Jane Chapman on the HBO show, explains how season 3’s delay opens up a potential new story arc.




Big Little Lies star Shailene Woodley explains how season 3&#39;s delay opens up the door for a new story arc. One of HBO&#39;s biggest recent hits, created by David E. Kelley and based on the novel of the same name, Big Little Lies has maintained a lot of interest since its premiere in 2017 debut because of its sharp scripts and a starry cast that included Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, and Woodley. Late last year, Kidman gave an update saying the Emmy-winning drama will return. But since then, there&#39;s been no official response from HBO about the status of the series.




In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar to discuss her role in the new movie Ferrari, Woodley was also asked about Big Little Lies season 3 and specifically what she would want to see for her character Jane Chapman. In response, Woodley talked about how the gap between the second and third installments means that the children of the show are now grown up. She notes: “What does life look like for those people who are not children anymore?” The full quote is below:


It’s been a dream for us [to do a third season]. Working together on that show was so many things, and the way that it affected so many people around the world and the way that it affected us—that was something none of us expected. I think what excites me about the possibility of a third season, more than what I could think of with Jane, is the fact that these children [on the show] are not children anymore. They’re teenagers now!
Jean-Marc Vallée, our brilliant filmmaker who brought Big Little Lies together and really made it what it was, sadly passed away, and at his funeral last year, all of the kids came and the cast was there. So I’m looking around and I’m like, “Where’s our kids?!” Their voices have dropped, they all have their teenage situation happening [waves hands over face to imply acne], and the angst is kicking in, and that, to me, is what is exciting about the possibility of a third season. What does life look like for those people who are not children anymore?






 Could A Different Version Of Big Little Lies Work? 
          

Big Little Lies season 2&#39;s ending wraps up in a big way for the Monterey Five, which is the somewhat infamous name for the characters played by Kidman, Kravitz, Dern, Woodley, and Witherspoon. The group accompanies Bonnie (Kravitz) to the police station after she texts that she is going to confess her involvement in the death of Perry (Alexander Skarsgård), though it&#39;s unclear if Bonnie goes through with the confession. Although the series is based on a novel, there isn&#39;t a second book for the HBO drama to adapt.

Woodley indicates that the focus could shift more to the young Big Little Lies actors. That would include Kathryn Newton, who played the daughter of Madeline (Witherspoon) and Ed (Adam Scott). Newton, known for her roles in Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania and the body swap horror Freaky, could potentially front her own spinoff and continue the story through a different lens.




                  Big Little Lies Season 3 Should Leave Season 1 Mystery Alone (&amp; Do This Instead)   Big Little Lies has done everything it could with season 1&#39;s mystery and it should take a different direction for the upcoming season 3.    

Based on the comments from Kidman and Woodley, the goal seems to be getting the main Big Little Lies cast back together. But without a strong idea, and the backlash to season 2, it may be worth considering taking the show&#39;s return in an unexpected direction and seeing if a different approach sparks interest.



Big Little Lies is currently available to stream on Max.
