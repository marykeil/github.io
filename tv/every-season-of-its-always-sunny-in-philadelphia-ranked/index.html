  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia has been remarkably consistent since day one, which makes finding the best season tough.</p>
<p>Taking a look at all of the It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia seasons ranked from worst to best shows why the sitcom has become one of the longest-running in television history. Following a historic deal with FX, it&rsquo;s been confirmed that It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has been renewed through season 18. While there will be plenty of misadventures to come in the future with the gang at Paddy&rsquo;s Pub, the 16 seasons the show has already produced leave lots of hilarious fun for viewers, even if some seasons of It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia are better than others.
Though there will be a considerable wait until It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia season 17, it remains one of the best shows to revisit and binge-watch with each season offering a collection of wild, edgy, and smart stories with these wonderfully despicable characters. As with any show, there are times when It&rsquo;s Always Sunny seems to falter with the quality of its stories and other instances that show it has improved with age. As a result, the It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia seasons ranked from worst to best show a lot of variety across the sitcom&rsquo;s historic run.

<p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia Cast &amp; Character Guide
It&rsquo;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia is one of the darkest sitcoms of all time, and here&rsquo;s a cast and character guide to the gang at Paddy&rsquo;s Pub.</p>
<p>16  Season 1
Best Episode: Underage Drinking: A National Concern</p>
<p>The show premiered with a slew of extremely edgy material right out of the gate. In fact, season 1 likely remains the most controversial when compared to later seasons of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, as seen in episodes such as &ldquo;The Gang Gets Racist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Charlie Wants an Abortion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Charlie Has Cancer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Underage Drinking: A National Concern.&rdquo;
The season is hilarious, but with the absence of Danny DeVito - and being fairly grounded in reality compared to the later seasons – it doesn’t quite feel totally like the Always Sunny that audiences have come to love. Still, even with just seven episodes, the first season competes well with even the latest seasons.</p>
<p>10 Unanswered Questions That It&rsquo;s Always Sunny Season 17 Finally Needs To Address
As It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia approaches its 17th season, there are still plenty of unanswered questions for the long-running sitcom to answer.</p>
<p>15  Season 14
Best Episode: The Janitor Always Mops Twice</p>
<p>Out of every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, few are as well-produced as season 14. &ldquo;Thunder Gun 4: Maximum Cool&rdquo; sees It&rsquo;s Always Sunny guest star Dolph Lundgren make an extended cameo in a fictional Hollywood action blockbuster, with Charlie hilariously failing to comprehend the extremely simple premise.
Meanwhile, &ldquo;Waiting for Big Mo&rdquo; is a great episode that is a tribute to the play Waiting for Godot, and includes a metacommentary about whether being in one of the most successful shows in history is still worth it — plus hilarious references to Wu-Tang Clan&rsquo;s &ldquo;C.R.E.A.M.&rdquo; However, the crown jewel of the season may be “The Janitor Always Mops Twice,” which turns the show into a parody of 1940s noir movies.</p>
<p>14  Season 12
Best Episode: The Gang Goes To A Water Park</p>
<p>Despite ranking low, It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia season 12 is propped up by some episodes that became instant classics. “The Gang Goes To A Water Park” is one of the most hilariously grotesque episodes of television ever. Meanwhile, shot in the style of a crime documentary, &ldquo;Making Dennis Reynolds a Murderer&rdquo; greatly pays off the running joke about Dennis being a serial killer. Most notably, episodes like &ldquo;Cricket&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Gang Turns Black&rdquo; underscore how the series pulls off using offensive elements for comedic social commentary.</p>
<p>13  Season 15
Best Episode: The Gang Carries a Corpse Up a Mountain</p>
<p>What truly differentiates the 15th season from every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia is that it featured the gang&rsquo;s return after the pandemic, which it quickly addressed in &ldquo;2020: A Year In Review.&rdquo; The season then gets off to a running start with &ldquo;The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 7,&rdquo; keeping the attached controversies alive and even more hilarious. After the gang journeys to Ireland to finally reveal Charlie&rsquo;s real father, culminating in the finale, &ldquo;The Gang Carries a Corpse Up a Mountain,&rdquo; the series ends on a strangely hopeful note.</p>
<p>12  Season 6
Best Episode: A Very Sunny Christmas</p>
<p>Compared to every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, even the first, season 6 is known for being controversial. It opens with &ldquo;Mac Fights Gay Marriage,&rdquo; in which Mac gets angered by finding out that a transwoman he dated is married to a man - consistent with Mac&rsquo;s then-story arc of being a closeted gay man.
Other notable episodes include&quot;Charlie Kelly: King of the Rats&quot; and &ldquo;Dee Reynolds: Shaping America&rsquo;s Youth,&rdquo; the beginning of the gang&rsquo;s controversial &ldquo;reboots&rdquo; of Lethal Weapon. Meanwhile, “A Very Sunny Christmas” is one of the very best season finales in It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Why Always Sunny&rsquo;s Original Dee Actress Was Replaced After The Pilot
It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia is known for its charismatic main cast, but that was almost very different, as the original Dee was replaced.</p>
<p>11  Season 11
Best Episode: Mac &amp; Dennis Move to the Suburbs</p>
<p>Being one of the best of the later seasons, it gets off to a great start with “Chardee McDennis 2: Electric Boogaloo,” providing a sequel to one of the funniest It&rsquo;s Always Sunny episodes. Season 11 also includes &ldquo;Mac &amp; Dennis Move to the Suburbs,&rdquo; scenes from which have provided the fodder for viral memes about dysfunctional relationships. The most innovative episode of the season is inarguably &ldquo;Being Frank,&rdquo; which is shot entirely from Frank Reynolds&rsquo; perspective — one of Danny DeVito&rsquo;s best performances in the series. Moreover, &ldquo;The Gang Goes To Hell&rdquo; is a memorable, thriller-inspired 2-part season finale.</p>
<p>10  Season 10
Best Episode: Charlie Work</p>
<p>Every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia has at least one viral episode, but no other season premiere has inspired as many copycats as “The Gang Beats Boggs,&quot; the infamous airplane drinking competition. Meanwhile, “The Gang Goes On Family Fight&quot; shines the public spotlight on Sunny&rsquo;s unusual family, with Keegan-Michael Key as the game show host tasked with reeling in the gang&rsquo;s non-family-friendly banter. However, the peak of this season is undoubtedly &ldquo;Charlie Work,&rdquo; in which a 7-minute continuous shot reveals how Charlie is the force keeping Paddy&rsquo;s Pub together.</p>
<p>9  Season 2
Best Episode: Mac Bangs Dennis&rsquo; Mom</p>
<p>Every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia will always be compared to season 2, mainly because it featured the introduction of Danny DeVito as Frank, Dennis and Dee’s father. Undoubtedly, Frank has always been the single best improvement in the show. In &ldquo;The Gang Exploits a Miracle,&rdquo; Frank charges patrons to see a water stain in the office resembling the Virgin Mary.
Meanwhile, Charlie does as promised in &ldquo;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&rsquo;s Ass.&rdquo; The finale, &ldquo;Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad,&rdquo; actually establishes many of the key dynamics in the gang revolving around Frank being their collective father figure.</p>
<p>8  Season 13
Best Episode: Mac Finds His Pride</p>
<p>Every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia is surreal in some way, but season 13 just takes it to another level. In &ldquo;The Gang Makes Paddy&rsquo;s Great Again,&rdquo; the first episode, Dennis gets replaced by a sex doll version of himself. Meanwhile, &ldquo;The Gang Does a Clip Show&rdquo; sees the gang&rsquo;s memories mixing with their fantasies, which includes a scene-by-scene recreation of a Seinfeld episode where Mac and Dennis both play Jerry.
It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia season 13 notably ends with &ldquo;Mac Finds His Pride,&rdquo; which finally saw Mac coming into the greatness he always perceived in himself, culminating in the single most cathartic moment in the whole series.</p>
<p>It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia: 10 Things That Changed After The Pilot Episode
It&rsquo;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia has been going on for 14 seasons, and it has changed in many ways since the pilot episode.</p>
<p>7  Season 16
Best Episode: Dennis Takes a Mental Health Day</p>
<p>After the bold Ireland-set season of It&rsquo;s Always Sunny, season 16 of the show returned to its roots for a more basic collection of episodes. The result is one of the best seasons of the show in recent memory with some episodes destined to become classics. Even this deep into the series, the sitcom was still revealing hilarious new things like the fact that Charlie and Frank&rsquo;s apartment is actually a two-bedroom with a bathroom as well as the return of Charlie&rsquo;s sisters to It&rsquo;s Always Sunny.
Some of the episodes set up the comedy from the title alone, such as &ldquo;Frank Shoots Every Member of the Gang.&rdquo; However, the funniest episode allowed Dennis to truly embrace his hilarious rage problems with the finale &ldquo;Dennis Takes a Mental Health Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6  Season 5
Best Episode: The D.E.N.N.I.S. System</p>
<p>“Paddy’s Pub: Home Of The Original Kitten Mittens” possibly has the most memorable soft opening of the series, as Charlie shows the gang a commercial he shot for cats’ footwear, and the gang is just as confused as the viewer. In another one of the gang&rsquo;s iconic presentations, Dennis takes being a creep to another level in “The D.E.N.N.I.S. System.&quot;
Meanwhile, “The Gang Hits The Road” is a classic and must-see road trip episode. Finally, in &ldquo;The Gang Reignites the Rivalry,&rdquo; everyone joins Dennis&rsquo; fraternity to get in shape for a drinking competition that the gang is forcing on their rival pub.</p>
<p>5  Season 3
Best Episode: Mac Is A Serial Killer</p>
<p>Considered by many to be the best out of every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, season 3 is when the show entered its golden age. This includes &ldquo;The Gang Gets Held Hostage,&rdquo; which might be the best and most disturbing episode featuring the McPoyles. There&rsquo;s also the two-part &ldquo;The Gang Gets Whacked,&rdquo; in which the gang gets embroiled in a cocaine dealing operation in the city.
Charlie also channels Serpico in &ldquo;Bums: Making a Mess All Over the City.&rdquo; Season 3, the longest season of the series, ends with &ldquo;The Gang Dances Their Asses Off,&rdquo; in which the gang needs to win a dance contest in order to keep Paddy&rsquo;s Pub.</p>
<p>4  Season 8
Best Episode: The Gang Dines Out</p>
<p>Episodes like “The Gang Gets Analyzed” and &ldquo;Frank&rsquo;s Back in Business&rdquo; means that Frank is arguably the star of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia season 8. However, it also includes &ldquo;The Maureen Ponderosa Wedding Massacre,&rdquo; a fun parody of zombie and mystery films. Meanwhile, in “The Gang Dines Out,” Frank and Charlie are at a standoff against Mac and Dennis, but end up bonding by harassing and assaulting an innocent civilian, as they always do. Season 8 also stands out for Mac&rsquo;s intense and compelling presentation in &ldquo;Reynolds vs. Reynolds: The Cereal Defense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny Season 16 Revives Its Most Hilarious Romance After 10 Years
It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia season 16 has brought back the show&rsquo;s funniest romance, but they should actually make it a permanent story.</p>
<p>3  Season 4
Best Episode: The Nightman Cometh</p>
<p>It doesn’t get better than season 4. It features “Sweet Dee Has A Heart Attack,” the episode that houses the infamous meme of Charlie in front of a corkboard full of strings and pictures as he&rsquo;s trying to solve a mystery. There&rsquo;s also &ldquo;The Gang Cracks the Liberty Bell,&rdquo; in which the gang tells an elaborate story about the historical relevance of Paddy&rsquo;s Pub — in a fully produced period drama parody.
The season also ends with one of the greatest finales of all time, “The Nightman Cometh,” a dark musical with a ton of depth, which actually became a real-life musical for a short time.</p>
<p>2  Season 9
Best Episode: The Gang Tries Desperately To Win An Award</p>
<p>In the premiere episode of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia season 9, “The Gang Broke Dee” proves that Kaitlin Olson is possibly the funniest character among the cast. Meanwhile, the show&rsquo;s parody of Flowers for Algernon, “Flowers For Charlie,&quot; sees everyone get convinced that Charlie is actually a genius.
The ninth season also includes another classic action movie parody in &ldquo;The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 6.&rdquo; With the gang doing the exact opposite of what the title implies in &ldquo;The Gang Squashes Their Beefs,&rdquo; season 9 is rounded off by an absolutely chaotic finale that sees the return of the McPoyles, Cricket, and other beloved side characters.</p>
<p>1  Season 7
Best Episode: CharDee MacDennis: The Game Of Games</p>
<p>What makes the seventh season different from every season of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia? This is when actor Rob McElhenney began drastically changing his body type for comedy. Indeed, season 7 is famous for Mac putting on a ton of weight, with actor McElhenney actually putting on weight in real life to parody the unhealthy practice among actors in the industry. This is also the season that contains “Chardee McDennis: The Game Of Games,” which is simultaneously the best, worst, and most captivating board game ever seen on television.</p>
