 8  Mercedes Northup &amp; Tyler Norris Seem Headed For A Breakup 
Mercedes - The Bachelor Season 27; Tyler - The Bachelorette Season 19, Bachelor in Paradise Season 8
        

Mercedes, a 25-year-old nonprofit case manager from Bloomfield, Iowa, and Tyler, a 26-year-old small business owner from Wildwood, New Jersey, started out strong with a sweet relationship. They both seemed very excited about each other when Tyler arrived on the beach and asked Mercedes on a date. She later ended her budding relationship with Will Urena for him, and gave him her rose at the following rose ceremony. However, things took a turn when Tyler secretly kissed Jess Girod. Although he explored that connection, Tyler gave Mercedes his rose at the next rose ceremony.
During Bachelor in Paradise season 9 episode 8, things really began to go South for Mercedes and Tyler. Someone put a message in the Paradise Truth Box that said, &#34;Tyler, everyone knows you&#39;re not that into Mercedes. You better come clean &#39;cause she deserves the truth.&#34; Mercedes began to doubt their relationship, so she had a conversation with him about their future. Tyler didn&#39;t offer much reassurance when he was very nonchalant about whether a long-distance relationship between them could work.
Their situation got even worse later at the Bachelor in Paradise Comedy Roast, during which Tyler joked, &#34;Mercedes thinks she&#39;s a Mercedes. But she&#39;s more like a [expletive].&#34; Aaron Bryant added that Tyler was more committed to getting his ear pierced than in his last two weeks with Mercedes. In the previews for the next Bachelor in Paradise season 9 episode, Mercedes told Tyler that he wasn&#39;t honest with her. He appeared devastated as she told him that she felt used. In her confessional, Mercedes cried that she just got played. All of the signs seem to indicate that Mercedes and Tyler will most likely break up before they leave Paradise.

 7  Jess Girod &amp; Blake Moynes Are Feeling Off 
Jess - The Bachelor Season 27; Blake - The Bachelorette Season 16, The Bachelorette Season 17


 







Jess, a 24-year-old e-commerce coordinator from Winter Springs, Florida and Blake, a 32-year-old wildlife manager from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, coupled up at the very beginning of Bachelor in Paradise season 9. They felt really connected to each other, but something also felt off about their relationship. They worried that they hadn&#39;t explored any other connections, so Blake accepted a date from Genevie Mayo when she arrived in Mexico. They had a wonderful time, and even kissed. While Blake was on the date, Jess kissed Tyler.
Although they tested the waters with other people, Jess and Blake eventually found their way back to each other, and seemed stronger than ever. However, when Blake&#39;s ex-fiancée, Katie Thurston, showed up on the beach, things took a turn. Katie and Blake hadn&#39;t spoken in two years, and their conversation really threw Blake for a loop. Also, at the Comedy Roast, many contestants mocked the eight-year age difference between Blake and Jess.
In his confessional, Blake said that he spent way less time with Katie, but he still understood the love that he had for her in that time. However, he added that he spent so much more time with Jess, and he should&#39;ve felt it by now. Blake told Jess that he&#39;d had a real taste of what love is there, and he felt that they weren&#39;t getting there at all. It seems as though Blake and Jess&#39; relationship won&#39;t be able to survive past Paradise.

 6  Rachel Recchia &amp; Tanner Courtad Will Most Likely Break Up 
Rachel - The Bachelor Season 26, The Bachelorette Season 19; Tanner - The Bachelorette Season 20


When Rachel, a 27-year-old pilot from Clermont, Florida, found a romantic connection with Tanner Courtad, 30-year-old mortgage lender from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it took her by surprise. When he offered her his rose at the rose ceremony, she thought it was a friendship rose to help her stay in Paradise after Brayden Bowers left her for Becca Serrano. However, when she went on a date with her former Bachelorette suitor, Jordan Vandergriff, Tanner was disappointed, and they later had a conversation about their connection. Rachel and Tanner decided that they wanted to give their relationship a try.
In her confessional, Rachel admitted that she felt the most herself during that conversation than she had in her whole Bachelor Nation experience. However, at the Bachelor in Paradise Comedy Roast, Tanner insulted Rachel. He said, &#34;We were all really, really excited when we found out that there was gonna be an ex-Bachelorette on the beach, and obviously we were really hoping for Gabby, but we got Rachel.&#34; In her confessional, Rachel said that she opened up to Tanner about things that she hadn&#39;t told anyone else, and she thought that their relationship was special. She questioned why he&#39;d say something so mean. She cried that she thought that Tanner liked her, but he didn&#39;t.
Although Tanner&#39;s comment could be seen as a joke, it brought back many of the insecurities that Rachel has felt in the past. She came to Paradise to find a sincere relationship with someone who genuinely liked her, and Tanner&#39;s insult might prove to be too much for her. During the previews for Bachelor in Paradise season 9, Rachel is torn about whom to give her rose. She might choose to give it to Tanner, Jordan, or even go back to Brayden, who currently doesn&#39;t have a connection on the beach. However, Rachel might also decide that enough is enough and leave Paradise alone.





 5  Olivia Lewis &amp; Michael Barbour Have Chemistry 
Olivia - The Bachelor Season 27; Michael - The Bachelorette Season 20


Olivia Lewis, a 24-year-old patient care technician from Churchville, New York, had a difficult and disappointing Bachelor in Paradise journey before Michael Barbour, a 29-year-old yacht captain from Chicago, Illinois, arrived on the beach. Initially, she was excited about her connection with Will, but he left her for Kylee Russell. Then she was over-the-moon about John Henry Spurlock, but he ended their relationship for Kat Izzo. At the rose ceremony, Brayden gave Olivia his rose after Becca self-eliminated at the last minute, so that Olivia could have another chance to find love.
Luckily, Michael came to Mexico the next day with a date card, and asked her to go on the date with him. Olivia and Michael felt an instant connection. Olivia was thrilled that Michael was a perfect gentleman. He even gave her his sandals to wear when she told him that the sand was hot on her feet. They had a terrific date and kissed. Although they&#39;ve been having a fantastic time together and have a lot of chemistry, Olivia and Michael have only known each other for a short time. They might leave Mexico together as a couple, but it&#39;s doubtful that they&#39;ll get engaged after just a few days.

 4  Sam Picco &amp; Peter Cappio Are Building Their Relationship 
Sam - Bachelor in Paradise Canada; Peter - The Bachelorette Season 20
        

Sam Picco, a 34-year-old entrepreneur from St. John&#39;s Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and Peter Cappio, a 33-year-old airline pilot from New York, New York, had the odds stacked against them when they arrived in Paradise. As a night one cast-off from Charity&#39;s Bachelorette season, Peter wasn&#39;t well-known to his fellow contestants. Similarly, Sam was a contestant on Big Brother Canada 7 and Bachelor in Paradise Canada season 2, and, therefore, no one knew her either.
Sam and Peter developed a fun relationship. Because of this, they could actually survive after Paradise. Sam has said in her confessional that she looks forward to seeing what happens outside of Paradise. However, one obstacle in their relationship is that Sam came to the beach later than Peter, so they haven&#39;t had much time together.
During their double date with Kylee and Aven Jones, Sam and Peter had a great time loosening up and dancing with each other. Peter and Sam are two of the older contestants, and they both seem ready to settle down in the near future. On the date, Peter told Sam that he&#39;d like nothing more than to make the rest of his Paradise, their Paradise. He wanted them to keep exploring each other. Sam was thrilled, and said that she felt the exact same way. It would be very sweet if Sam and Peter left Bachelor in Paradise season 9 engaged.





 3  Kat Izzo &amp; John Henry Spurlock An Incredible Connection 
Kat - The Bachelor Season 27; John Henry - The Bachelorette Season 20


 







Kat, a 27-year-old registered nurse from Tampa, Florida, had a tumultuous time in Paradise before she met John Henry, a 31-year-old underwater welder from Virginia Beach, Virginia. She dated Brayden, but then left him for Tanner, who left her for Davia Bunch on her birthday. Kat was very upset, but set her sights on John Henry, who was dating Olivia. Kat pursued John Henry despite this, and he eventually left Olivia for Kat. Now that they&#39;re together, they&#39;ve settled into a cute and fun relationship with deep feelings that might have what it takes to go the distance.
Kat has calmed down considerably since she started spending time with John Henry. He seems to ground her, and she pulls him out of his shell, since he tends to be shy. Kat told the cameras that he makes her a better person. They told each other that their relationship feels right, and Kat said in her confessional that she could see herself falling very in love with John Henry. They were a surprising couple, but they might just be the perfect match. There&#39;s a good chance that Kat and John Henry could leave the beach engaged.

 2  Eliza Isichei &amp; Aaron Bryant Are Exclusive 
Eliza - The Bachelor Season 26, Bachelor in Paradise Season 8; Aaron - The Bachelorette Season 20 Eliza Isichei, a 27-year-old marketing manager from Berlin, Germany, returned for Bachelor in Paradise season 9 after her difficult experience in a love triangle with Rodney Mathews and Justin Glaze during Bachelor in Paradise season 8. Eliza wanted to avoid any drama during her second time in Paradise, and she thought she&#39;d found that in her relationship with Aaron Bryant, a 30-year-old software salesman from Katy, Texas. However, when Kat Izzo revealed to Eliza that Charity had warned her to stay away from Aaron, Eliza was devastated. When Eliza confronted Aaron about everything, he explained that he had a disgrunted ex-girlfriend who was spreading lies about him on social media. He mentioned two other women besides Charity, which only confused and upset Eliza more. Thankfully, Charity arrived in Paradise just in time to explain everything. Eliza was reassured, and her relationship with Aaron has only grown stronger. Aaron eventually told her that he was falling in love with her and asked her to be his girlfriend. Eliza happily accepted. Aaron and Eliza both proved that they were mature and willing to fight for their relationship by overcoming the conflict that arose earlier in the season. Aaron has repeatedly said in his confessionals that he sees a future with Eliza in which they&#39;re engaged. They&#39;ve been together long enough that they&#39;re really getting to know each other. There&#39;s a good chance that Aaron will propose, and Eliza will say yes.





 1  Kylee Russell &amp; Aven Jones Are Falling For Each Other 
Kylee - The Bachelor Season 27; Aven - The Bachelorette Season 19


 







Kylee, a 25-year-old postpartum nurse from Charlotte, North Carolina, came to Bachelor in Paradise season 9 hoping to meet Aven, a 29-year-old sales executive from Salem, Massachusetts. He&#39;d liked a few of her pictures on Instagram, and even put a fire emoji on one, but that was the extent of their contact before the show. Although she initially had a connection with Will, she immediately left him for Aven when he arrived in Paradise.
Kylee and Aven have been the most solid couple so far, without any drama or obstacles in their way. They&#39;ve been together since the beginning, so they&#39;ve been able to get to know each other on a deeper level. Kylee and Aven are fully committed to each other, and have even said that they&#39;re falling for each other. They both want to see where things go outside of Paradise. If things continue on this path for Kylee and Aven, they could leave Paradise engaged.
Bachelor in Paradise season 9 has several couples whose relationships seem doomed, while others might be destined to last forever. There are so many strong couples this season, that there should almost certainly be at least one proposal during the season finale. Hopefully, the couples who are meant to be together will stay together, as history has shown that Bachelor in Paradise can lead to couples having successful marriages and children. Bachelor in Paradise season 9 has been one of the best yet.
Bachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
