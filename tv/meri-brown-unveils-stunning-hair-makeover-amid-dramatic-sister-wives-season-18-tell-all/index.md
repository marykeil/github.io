## Literature Review
Sister Wives season 18 cast member Meri Brown looks different and much happier with her brand-new hair transformation amid the Tell-All drama.




Meri Brown revealed a dramatic hair transformation as the Sister Wives season 18 Tell-All continues to reveal the biggest bombshells of all time. Meri is a 52-year-old woman who made her reality TV debut with Kody Brown in 2009. Meri is Kody’s first wife, whom he married in April 2020 before he decided to introduce three more wives into his family. As Kody married Janelle, Christine and, lastly, Robyn, he started drifting apart from his first wife. After more than 30 years of marriage, Meri and Kody announced their split in January 2023.




Kody openly talked about his lack of physical and emotional attraction to Meri, thus damaging her confidence. However, the Sister Wives season 18 star is now building a great life for herself by undergoing a massive emotional and physical transformation.


 

Meri has been showing off her weight loss on social media and now has also revealed her new hair makeover, which her fans think is her “best look yet.” Meri has chopped off her tresses to make them shorter and permed, making it look fuller. Not to mention, Meri’s hair now is a completely different color. The red and copper in Meri’s hair is something that her fans agree makes her look “amazing.”


 How Has Meri Brown&#39;s Life Changed Since Leaving Kody? 
          




Meri used a famous quote by Coco Chanel in her caption. She added, “A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life,” with the hashtag “#WorthyUp.” She had a mischievous smile in her selfie, and fans couldn’t help but notice how she looked with her new eyebrows. “All of Cody’s wives look better after they leave,” is the top comment on Meri’s post. Someone said they were glad that Meri “got rid” of Kody, while a different follower of Meri’s exclaimed, “So glad you left that pompous jerk! He didn&#39;t deserve you girl!!!”

Meri said Kody no longer considered himself to be married to her when she decided to pump the breaks on the relationship. She wanted to believe that she could make things work with Kody. He had been disappointing Meri for years. He let her down by giving his legal wife status to Robyn. However, there has been a significant improvement in Meri, according to her recent updates. She has started a fitness journey, has a new positive attitude towards life, and is the happiest she’s been in years.
