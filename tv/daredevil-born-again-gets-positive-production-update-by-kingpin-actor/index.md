## Literature Review

With Daredevil: Born Again getting redeveloped by Marvel Studios, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio, who plays Kingpin, shares a massive production about filming.




Matt Murdock&#39;s Marvel Cinematic Universe return is closer to happening as new details have emerged about the filming schedule for Daredevil: Born Again. Following Netflix&#39;s Daredevil TV show, Charlie Cox is becoming a bigger player again in the MCU, as he is set to headline Daredevil: Born Again, one of the next Disney&#43; series from Marvel Studios. However, Daredevil: Born Again went through a major creative overhaul in 2023, as Marvel Studios were reportedly not happy with the initial product.




However, Daredevil: Born Again is close to finally getting on the right track, as the Devil of Hell&#39;s Kitchen gets closer to being back in the MCU full-time. In a new interview with Comic Book, Kingpin actor Vincent D&#39;Onofrio opened up about where the Daredevil: Born Again TV show is at in terms of its redevelopment. According to D&#39;Onofrio, Daredevil: Born Again is getting ready to restart filming, as he shared the following:


We&#39;re days away from restarting Daredevil, so that&#39;s that&#39;s we&#39;re about to plunge into a lot of work. We&#39;re shooting in New York, in the studio and on locations here. Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Chelsea. Stuff like that.


                  Daredevil Born Again: Release Info, Cast &amp; Everything We Know So Far   After being teased in MCU films and television shows, Matt Murdock is returning to the screen for a series in the Disney&#43; Daredevil: Born Again.    


 What We Know About The New Daredevil: Born Again Direction 
         




When Marvel Studios made the call to let go of the original Daredevil: Born Again team, it was part of a new initiative for the MCU, wherein future shows are set to have a more traditional TV structure, including having a showrunner who will craft a series bible intended to maintain multiple seasons. That is now the task for Dario Scardapane, who previously worked on The Punisher and has been hired as the new Daredevil: Born Again showrunner.

D&#39;Onofrio also recently revealed that Daredevil: Born Again will link to Netflix&#39;s Daredevil, as the MCU series aims to lean into the strengths of the original show. While it won&#39;t be Daredevil season 4, it means Daredevil: Born Again is clearly not looking to ignore the previous events that Matt, Wilson Fisk, and even Frank Castle - as Jon Bernthal is reprising the role - have gone through. There are also rumors that Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll) will be back in Daredevil: Born Again, but this has yet to be confirmed or denied.






Despite the shake-up, it appears Daredevil: Born Again season 2 is still going forward.




It will definitely be intriguing to follow the process for Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s new production after all of these creative changes. Even though it will mean people will have to wait a bit longer for Daredevil: Born Again to drop on Disney&#43;, the discussions surrounding these changes suggest they may have also allowed the show to connect more to Daredevil&#39;s past, and provide a more engaging story as a result. Hopefully, once Daredevil: Born Again starts filming, the world will be able to get a better idea of the new direction for the show.
