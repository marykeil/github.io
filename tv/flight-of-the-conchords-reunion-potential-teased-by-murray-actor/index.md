## Literature Review
Flight of the Conchord&#39;s Rhys Darby, who played Murray on the hit two-season HBO series, teases a potential reunion of the long-cancelled show. 




Flight of the Conchords actor Rhys Darby teases a potential reunion. The musical comedy show originally aired on HBO in 2007, airing a low-budget first season that ended up becoming incredibly well-regarded. Flight of the Conchords was awarded a season 2 but never got another season after its sophomore effort.




Speaking to Deadline at the Creative Arts Emmys, Darby teases a potential Flight of the Conchords reunion. The actor said that a reunion like this is something he and his creative companions are “always discussing.” Teasing the return more heavily, Darby noted that: “There will come a time when the world really, really needs [the reunion] and we will suddenly appear.” Check out the full quote from Darby below:


“We’re always discussing the sort of things we’d like to do in the future and looking back at the classic things we’ve done. There will come a time when the world really, really needs [the reunion] and we will suddenly appear.”



 Why A Flight of the Conchords Reunion Should Happen Now 
         

Flight of the Conchords introduced the world to several New Zealanders who would later become critical talents of TV comedy. In addition to Darby, the series starred Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, the latter of whom also created the show alongside James Bobin. Hugely successful director Taika Waititi also serves as a director on four episodes of the show, years before he became the Oscar-winning director-producer sensation that he is today.




Since working on Flight of the Conchords, members of its team have joined forces again on multiple occasions. This includes Waititi and Clement, who worked together on the film What We Do In the Shadows as well as the television show. Waititi also works alongside Darby in the hit pirate comedy Our Flag Means Death. These collaborations demonstrate how Flight of the Conchords laid the groundwork for lifelong creative partnerships, and the strength of these bonds could easily bring the crew back together again.

                  Flight Of The Conchords: The HBO Show&#39;s 10 Best Running Gags   HBO’s Flight of the Conchords only ran for 2 seasons, but there were a couple of running jokes throughout those episodes that tied the show together.    

In the elapsed time between Flight of the Conchords season 2 and now, its stars have only grown higher profiles and honed their creative skills. This clout could do wonders for a Flight of the Conchords reunion, as instead of introducing a novel show, the reunion could attract viewers of What We Do in the Shadows  and Our Flag Means Death. Now is the perfect time to bring back the goofy charm of Flight of the Conchords, and based on Darby’s words, it just might happen when one least expects it.
