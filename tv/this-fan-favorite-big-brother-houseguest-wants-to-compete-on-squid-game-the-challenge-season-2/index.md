Janelle became a Big Brother icon because of her incredible gameplay. Although she&#39;s never won the game, her in-your-face style of playing has been revered for years. Her intelligence, determination, and physical prowess were never more evident than in Big Brother 7. She was known as the Veto Queen for setting a new record of five Power of Veto wins in a single season, and setting the record for single-season combined Head of Household and Power of Veto wins with nine. Those two records were only recently broken by Big Brother 24&#39;s Michael Bruner and Big Brother 25&#39;s Jag Bains, respectively. Janelle is also fiercely loyal to her allies.

Her simple answer of &#34;yes&#34; when asked if she could withstand the Squid Game conditions sums up her attitude toward competing perfectly. It would be epic to see Janelle compete on Squid Game: The Challenge season 2.
