## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé star Natalie has been accused of scamming Mike to get a U.S. visa. She&#39;s revealing the truth behind their shocking 2020 split.




90 Day: The Single Life star Natalie Mordovtseva finally addressed claims that she used Mike Youngquist to live her dream life in America. Natalie from Ukraine met Mike via their mutual friends, Matt and Svetlana. Mike knew Natalie the model and actress was out of his league, but he took a chance to go meet her, and they were soon engaged and applying for Natalie’s K-1 visa. Mike was in Nevada when they started talking, but work took Mike to Sequim, Washington. Natalie knew she couldn’t make her dreams come true in the woods but found a reason to leave Mike when his mom allegedly called her a hooker.




Natalie began dating Josh Weinstein when she relocated to Florida, which would help her achieve her dream Hollywood career, but Natalie told ET that she never took advantage of Mike to get to America.


 

“First of all, I don&#39;t have stability at all and whenever Michael had no papers, I didn&#39;t even take my passport to be honest,&#34; Natalie explained. “It was reasons why but for those wonderful haters who hate me for coming here for papers...” she added. Natalie said she couldn’t go home despite four years of marriage “because of war.” Natalie continued, “I never had even a permit from my marriage. This is the sad truth.&#34;

 Natalie Will &#34;Never   The Door&#34; On Michael Reconciliation 
          

Mike and Natalie are finally getting divorced. Mike filed for divorce from his Ukrainian wife in December 2023, three years after they split. However, Natalie is positive that she might reconcile with him in the future. &#34;I don&#39;t know, I mean I never close the door when it comes to Michael,&#34; she confessed. She revealed that they “always talk,” and since it was Mike’s choice to divorce her, she respects it. Natalie admitted that one of the biggest reasons behind their relationship issues was her wanting to get a job in the entertainment industry when Mike wanted a quiet, normal life.

“He never believed I could succeed, now I understand why, it’s a bit hard here,” Natalie explained. Natalie wanted to try to be accepted by the entertainment industry, while Mike was trying to lead a regular life and have a regular job. He wanted Natalie to be able to pay her bills on time “because [in] this world [it&#39;s] really hard to make money and most of the people are independent contract workers,” she added. Natalie knew that she wouldn’t have the money if she didn’t have a “contract.” She continued,&#34; So it&#39;s really hard. And he knew it. This was the reason.&#34; Natalie doesn’t have any regrets about leaving Mike.




However, Natalie had a “good time” with Mike and appreciated that he was by her side no matter what. Natalie can’t imagine what could have happened to her if she had still been in Ukraine amid the war and the COVID-19 pandemic. Natalie’s mom, Nelia, is still close to Mike and prefers him over Josh as a match for Natalie. Mike is dating a new woman named Sara Rose, whom he’s been showing off on his Instagram page. Mike has moved on from Natalie, but the 90 Day: The Single Life star still needs to figure out her own life.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
