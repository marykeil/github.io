# The Flash 10 Weirdest Stories Across All 9 Seasons 


## SUMMARY 


 The Flash&#39;s weirdest storylines come from both low points and the show&#39;s embrace of eccentric source material. 
 Episodes featuring Gorilla Grodd and Red Death received mixed reviews due to laughable moments and lack of emotional connection. 
 The Flash&#39;s unexpected musical episode and unconventional choices, like making Iris West a temporary Flash, added to the show&#39;s absurdity.

## Literature Review
From a musical episode to abrupt relationship endings to pseudo-lightsaber battles, The Flash entertained some weird storylines over 9 seasons.




With more than 180 episodes spread across nine seasons, The Flash has contributed its fair share of weird story arcs to the DC Universe. The Grant Gustin-led superhero drama has rightfully earned a large fanbase and emerged as one of the Arrowverse’s biggest successes. But with such an ambitious episode count, a few moments are bound to not hit the target. This holds particularly true for the series’ latter seasons, offering some overstretched storylines and plenty of filler episodes. Despite his background as a comic book writer, post-season 4 showrunner Eric Wallace occasionally bore the brunt of disgruntled audiences, chiefly for some of those notorious moments.
However, this doesn’t imply that all of The Flash’s weirdest storylines stem from its low points. As has been the case with the weirdest Flash stories in the comics, the CW original has never shied away from testing out the source material’s eccentric nature. After all, a superhero sci-fi show with a talking gorilla as a guest villain or a Batman-Flash hybrid from the future is bound to get weird at some point or other. But then again, the show often relies on some original elements that take the absurdity a notch higher, be it in the case of speedsters jousting with lightning bolts or a musical with Supergirl.
            
 
 The Flash Season 9 Ending Explained: The End Of An Era 
Barry Allen&#39;s Arrowverse journey ended in The Flash season 9 finale, which brought back multiple characters and featured a huge tease for the future.













 








 10  Grodd’s King Kong Moment Was Laughable 
The Flash Season 2, Episode 7
        

The Flash does acknowledge Gorilla Grodd’s telekinetic powers in season 2, but some cringe-inducing moments leave a bad memory. The episode “Gorilla Warfare” is already formulaic, with Henry Allen giving an emotional speech to the Scarlet Speedster (complete with a “You can do it, Barry” affirmation), but even before that, it’s laughable to find Grodd harboring feelings for Caitlin Snow because she was nice to him at STAR Labs. What follows is a King Kong-style “beauty killed the beast” story, with Grodd forcing her to breed more meta-gorillas like him.
Gorilla Grodd was created by writer John Broome who also created the Green Lantern supervillain Sinestro. 






 9  Red Death Couldn’t Endear As Kate Kane’s Doppelgänger 
The Flash Season 9, Episodes 1-5
        

The Flash season 9 introduces audiences to Red Death, a villain who was an evil speedster version of Batman in the comics. The show put a new spin on the character with Batwoman actress Javicia Leslie randomly quoting Batman lines like “I’m vengeance” and “Let’s get nuts”. Leslie’s performance doesn’t stick to the landing also because her character is just a doppelgänger of Kate Kane (Batwoman), a hero whom Barry is barely acquainted with. In the comics, Barry is heartbroken to find his trusted friend Batman going rogue as Red Death. This emotional connection is lacking in The Flash’s Red Death identity and makes Rogues of War a strange storyline.





 8  A Musical Duet With Supergirl Was A Surprise 
The Flash Season 3, Episode 17


 







The Flash can be light-hearted at times, but the season 3 episode “Duet” is a major comedic deviation. A crossover with Supergirl, the episode reunites Glee stars Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoist with their former co-star Darren Criss. When Supergirl is stuck in a coma by Criss’ melodically over-the-top antagonist Music Meister, Martian Manhunter relies on Team Flash’s help to help her regain consciousness. Trapped in a world where life is a Technicolor musical, the Flash and Supergirl join forces (and harmonies) to escape from the Music Meister’s clutches. The end product is hilariously amusing, but The Flash turning into a full-fledged musical is definitely unexpected.

Now that The Flash and Supergirl musical crossover, &#39;Duet&#39;, has aired, we discuss whether Music Meister should return for a sequel.









 7  Iris West As A Temporary Flash Wasn’t Entirely Memorable 
The Flash Season 4, Episode 16
        

The infamous season 4 episode “Run Iris Run” with Iris being a masked speedster gets some undeserved hate from The Flash fandom, but that doesn&#39;t mean the arc isn&#39;t weird. Her sudden transition into a speedster and then being regarded as a team leader is peak filler content, as she has hardly proven any serious leadership in Team Flash before. Yes, she can help the team at times by speaking in their earpieces, but that&#39;s most about it. She has not helped the team crucially as much as Caitlin Snow or Cisco Ramone. Turning her into The Flash in “Run Iris Run” is an unconventional choice indeed.







 6  Cecile’s Parenting Worries Seem Hypocritical 
The Flash Season 9
        

One of the worst parts of The Flash for some is Cecile Horton’s superhero storyline. Struggling between her responsibilities as a mother and a psychic superhero, Cecile can come off as obnoxious and hypocritical to an extent. On one hand, Cecile is ready to give a resounding “Yes” to Joe West’s proposal to meet her kids only on weekends. On the other hand, she’s ready to mope about being a distant mother to her fellow Team Flash members. The final season does make some weird decisions regarding her character, like Cecile hardly aging a day even in 2049, but it’s her parenting arc that makes the least sense.





 5  Khione Unnecessarily Grabbed The Spotlight In Team Flash 
The Flash Season 9


 







Khione&#39;s rushed entry to the team as Caitlin Snow&#39;s new personality in the final episodes of season 9 proves how the show is just not ready to do away with Danielle Panabaker, reintroducing the actress to the series in a third avatar. When The Flash season 9 explained Khione’s powers, the self-proclaimed goddess was shown to be bonded with nature and harnessing exceptional sensory abilities. This characterization makes Khione too overpowered, occasionally overshadowing The Flash himself. Khione’s arc was strange from the start, considering how she had been hijacking Caitlin’s body all this time. Throw in Chillbane romancing Khione to get closer to Frost, and Khione’s story becomes more convoluted.





 4  Patty Spivot And Barry Allen’s Romance Ended On A Rushed Note 
The Flash Season 2, Episode 11
        

A police officer committed to tracking down her father’s killer, Patty Spivot, strikes up an instant romance with Barry Allen, one that was obviously not meant to last, considering Iris West’s presence in The Flash. But even then, the closure to their relationship could have been fleshed out further instead of Spivot hurriedly rushing to Midway City after discovering Barry’s superhero identity. What is weirder is how Patty forces Barry to reveal his secret. The CCPD officer deliberately puts herself in danger, hoping to get rescued by her boyfriend in his costumed speedster form. Heartbroken, she changes cities and is never to be heard of again.

Barry Allen&#39;s former love interest, Patty Spivot (Shantel VanSanten), left the Flash in the middle of season 2 and never returned. Here&#39;s why.









 3  Caitlin Snow’s Transformation Into Frost Wasn&#39;t As Morally Complex As It Should Have Been 
The Flash Season 3
        

Caitlin Snow’s character arc offered some antiheroic potential since she showed cryogenic traces of turning into the show’s version of Killer Frost. Season 3 addressed a Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde-inspired binary with Killer Frost being an alternate evil personality of Caitlin that the STAR Labs scientist struggles to control. Eventually, the persona takes full control over Caitlin’s body. But the morally gray areas of this binary are only briefly touched upon as Frost fully turns into a superhero in later episodes (even dropping the “Killer” in her name). Using a classic comic villain and then turning her into a likable hero was an odd choice for The Flash.





 2  The Flash’s Big Fight With Godspeed Became A Lightsaber Battle 
The Flash Season 7, Episode 18
        

Despite his intimidating persona in the comics, Godspeed has mostly been reduced to a laughing stock in The Flash. As the stage is set for Barry to take down the super speedster, he gets some unexpected help from Reverse-Flash. But this isn’t even the weird part, considering what follows next. Instead of displaying their superspeed, the three speedsters indulge in armed combat with literal lightning bolts in their hands. The battle with lightsaber-like lightning bolts seems hilarious, and the VFX aren&#39;t quite up to the challenge of the scene. As for Godspeed’s reputation in the show, there’s no coming back from that battle.





 1  The Legion of Zoom Was An Unconvincingly Weak Villain Team 
The Flash Season 9, Episode 13


 







The Flash series finale makes many seasons pointless, considering how easily Team Flash members can individually take on notorious speedsters from Barry Allen’s past. Chaos ensues after Cobalt Blue assembles his own rogues gallery of villains, strangely named Legion of Zoom (even if only one is named Zoom). All of these speedsters can challenge Barry in unprecedented ways, but what follows is a series of fairly predictable fights with Flash’s overpowered allies. This is evident from how Cecile (who gains flying powers without any explanation), Khione, and Allegra defeat Godspeed, Zoom, and Reverse-Flash, respectively. Khione’s victory is still justified by her powers, but Allegra’s lack of fighting experience makes her win seem absurd.
