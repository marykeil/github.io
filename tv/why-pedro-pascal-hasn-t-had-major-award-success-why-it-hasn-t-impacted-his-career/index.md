## Literature Review
Despite Pedro Pascal&#39;s incredible career, the actor has failed to win any of Hollywood&#39;s biggest prizes but this hasn&#39;t caused issues for the star.




Pedro Pascal has had a wonderful acting career, but despite his success, the actor has failed to win a major prize when it comes to Hollywood&#39;s biggest award ceremonies. He has had many successful years in the past and 2023 was no different, with Pascal leading HBO&#39;s hit show, The Last of Us, while continuing his other leading role in The Mandalorian. Pascal also appeared in a short film last year titled Strange Way of Life. With another big year under his belt, Pascal has been nominated for a variety of prizes during the upcoming awards season, but his history at these events hasn&#39;t been kind.




Despite Pedro Pascal being named IMDB&#39;s top star of 2023, there is still a danger the actor could end the awards season without any major prizes. He has been credited for his work by the likes of MTV and the ASTRA TV Awards, but there is no guarantee he will be claiming Hollywood&#39;s biggest prizes this year, especially considering his previous track record. Despite this, Pedro Pascal has some big movie roles coming in 2024, meaning he could replicate 2023&#39;s success, if not surpass it. With more exciting projects on the way, Pascal has proven his lack of awards hasn&#39;t impacted his ability to be cast.


 Pedro Pascal Has Been Snubbed At Numerous Award Shows, Including The 2024 Golden Globes 
Pascal Hasn&#39;t Managed To Win An Individual Prize At The Biggest Award Ceremonies
         

Award shows are far from the defining factor for an actor&#39;s career, but Pedro Pascal has suffered many snubs, including 2024&#39;s Golden Globes. Pascal received his first acting nomination at the Golden Globes this year but was didn&#39;t win the award. His role in The Last of Us made a big impression and has been nominated for several more ceremonies, but this snub continues a trend for the actor. He has been part of numerous huge TV shows, yet never quite managed to secure any big prizes. The Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and Oscars have all overlooked the actor in years gone by, posing the question if the same will happen once again.




Many of the shows he has been a part of have been nominated in the best drama categories, while Pascal&#39;s performances have been ignored. His Golden Globes nomination was a step forward, but failing to win for a show as critically acclaimed as The Last of Us proves how much bad luck he has had. Pascal has often come up against other popular shows and great performances, this year contending with Succession which had its final season. Pedro Pascal&#39;s Joel storyline in The Last of Us season 2 will likely be more limited if it follows the game&#39;s story, meaning, despite the show&#39;s popularity, he will likely be snubbed once again.



Kieran Culkin won the 2024 Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Television Series - Drama, for his role in Succession.






 Pedro Pascal Is Better Known For His Work On TV 
His Biggest Roles Include The Last of Us, Narcos, and The Mandalorian
          




While Pedro Pascal has had numerous great performances, he is better known for his work on genre TV series. Two of Pascal&#39;s biggest roles include The Mandalorian and The Last of Us, which are much more themed than the likes of Succession. With these shows being attached to other franchises and catering more towards specific fans, they tend not to perform as well among voting bodies compared to a broader drama series. Pedro Pascal&#39;s TV shows have proven to be popular with audiences, pulling in big viewing figures, yet this isn&#39;t what performs well come awards season as his past has shown.

Narcos was one of the actor&#39;s most award-friendly shows and helped Pedro Pascal elevate an already successful career, but despite the show receiving some nominations, his performance was once again snubbed. Pascal was even in Game of Thrones, but his character was never prominent enough to warrant a nomination. His movie career has also been strong, but not winning an Oscar makes more sense as he rarely plays the leading characters on the big screen. In contrast, Pascal not winning a BAFTA or Golden Globe mainly comes down to his more genre-focused work, but he would be a worthy winner and deserves more recognition for his work.




                  One Star Wars Scene Is Pedro Pascal&#39;s Best In The Mandalorian - Can It Ever Be Equalled?   One scene from The Mandalorian remains Pedro Pascal&#39;s best in Star Wars yet, but the question of whether it can be equalled again or not has arisen.    



 Why Pedro Pascal&#39;s Award Snubs Don&#39;t Matter 
Pascal&#39;s Career Has Went From Strength To Strength Even Without Major Awards
          

Although Pedro Pascal has suffered many award snubs, it ultimately hasn&#39;t impacted his career. The fact that he is part of such big television shows indicates his star power hasn&#39;t gone down by not winning the major prizes. His Golden Globes nomination is validation for his The Last of Us role, and 2024 looks like it will be full of great performances from the actor. He also appears to be popular among his peers, with Jack Black wanting Pedro Pascal cast in The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2. Kieran Culkin also joked about Pascal during his Golden Globes acceptance speech, which he responded playfully to, showing Pascal is respected in the industry.




Perhaps most significantly, Pascal is widely admired by fans. The star&#39;s endearing personality and lighthearted nature make him the sort of actor most people can enjoy. His huge fan base and support from other actors make it clear that Pascal will continue to have an exciting future, his impressive resume only adding more clarity to the situation. He already has a plethora of projects in the works and will continue to be a draw, whether it is for a TV audience or at the box office. Pascal may not have the awards he deserves, but it doesn&#39;t seem to concern the actor, and it certainly hasn&#39;t damaged his career prospects.
