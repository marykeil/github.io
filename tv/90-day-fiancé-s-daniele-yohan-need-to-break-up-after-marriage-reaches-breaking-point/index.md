## Literature Review
Daniele Gates and Yohan Geronimo&#39;s shocking argument in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 has fans giving them relationship advice.




Daniele Gates and Yohan Geronimo might be better off divorced after their latest argument in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, at least according to fans. Daniele is a former school teacher from New York City who&#39;s married to personal trainer and dancer Yohan from the Dominican Republic. Daniele moved to La Romana after she got married to Yohan when he expected her to get him a spousal visa. Daniele had promised Yohan a new life in America. He dreamed of working there and making money for his family. As years passed in their marriage, Yohan realized his life hadn&#39;t really changed at all since he met Daniele.




Moreover, instead of spending money on him, his American wife Daniele expected Yohan to pay 75,000 pesos a month towards their rent and household expenses. Yohan told Daniele, &#34;You&#39;ve helped me with nothing,&#34; during their fight on The Other Way season 5, episode 19. 90 Day Fiancé fans are now sounding off on this argument.


 

Yohan said, &#34;This relationship isn&#39;t going anywhere,&#34; in the clip, which was shared by 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Instagram page. The caption asked, &#34;Can they save their marriage?&#34; Most of the fans in the comments section urged Daniele to end her marriage and blasted her for not seeing Yohan&#39;s red flags. &#34;Why is she still hanging on to this marriage I will never know!&#34; said a viewer. &#34;She needs to RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!&#34; added someone else.

 Daniele &amp; Yohan&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Fans are tired of asking why Daniele isn&#39;t able to understand that he only wants a free ride from her. When Yohan agreed to marry Daniele, he was looking for someone who would give him money and buy him stuff, and he didn&#39;t have to do anything for it. Yohan even got a dollar sign tattoo after meeting her. Daniele&#39;s friend tried to stop her from marrying Yohan, but she had made up her mind and nothing was going to change her decision. Yohan treated Daniele badly when her ex-boyfriend-turned-friend Taylen Alexander came to the DR to meet her. Yohan even created a scene at The Other Way season 4 Tell-All upon seeing Taylen on set.




Yohan wanted to end his marriage then and there. It seemed Yohan and Daniele were done for good, but they returned for another season of The Other Way after undergoing couple&#39;s therapy. Then they had to deal with a new set of challenges as Yohan had lost his job and his shop, and fully depended on Daniele for money. He also pushed Daniele to have a baby. Given her age, Daniele went through a lot of emotional and physical pain while trying to get pregnant. Yohan finally agreed to try surrogacy as an option. However, it turned out to be an expensive affair for Daniele.

Yohan&#39;s patience started wearing thin when he realized Daniele was not able to provide him with anything that he wanted and, instead, expected him to pay the bills. The couple&#39;s current relationship status remains a mystery since both Daniele and Yohan don&#39;t post about each other on Instagram. Daniele had agreed to get Yohan a tourist visa, and he might have been able to come to the U.S. after all if they stayed together. However, it&#39;s too soon to predict what happens next. All questions will eventually be answered during the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 finale.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
