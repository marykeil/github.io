## Literature Review
Meri Brown from Sister Wives is dedicated to moving on after calling it quits with Kody Brown. She introduces her new family member to her followers.




After separating from Kody Brown in Sister Wives season 18, Meri Brown has found someone else to love. The 52-year-old California native was previously in a polygamous relationship. Meri was married to Kody, who didn’t acknowledge her as his wife. In the recent Sister Wives season, Meri finally had enough of her bad husband’s denial. She decided to move away from him and sought a permanent breakup. Meri and Kody ended their relationship in 2023. They agreed to permanently terminate their marriage because things didn’t work out, despite their best attempts.




Meri has been alone for a long time after ending her marriage with Kody. However, she recently found someone who would love her unconditionally. On January 2, Meri posted a photo of herself with her new pet dog, Zona. She looked ecstatic about becoming a dog mom and wrote, “They say love comes when you least expect it.”


 

Meri shared that she travels too often and lacks the time for a pet. However, she still adopted Zona because “she was special.” Meri added, “I couldn’t get her off my mind or out of my heart, so I went back on Sunday and brought her home with me!”

Many Sister Wives viewers were happy to see Meri move on and find someone to love. A social media user wrote, “I am so happy for the both of you,” adding that it was absolutely wonderful that Meri got a pet. Another social media user commented, “Thank you for rescuing and Hal for having an open heart!” Logan Brown’s wife Michelle Petty was also happy about Aunty Meri’s pet dog. She asked, “I can’t wait to meet her! We’ll have to do doggy play dates.” Logan’s wife invited Meri to visit Vegas to spend time with her and her pet.

Seeing Meri move on and adopt a pet is heartwarming. The single mom was truly in a devastating situation with Kody. She wanted him to love her, but he never cared about her feelings. Ahead of her divorce, Meri was hopeful to see just a little change. She hoped Kody would reconcile with her since they had been married for over 30 years. Unfortunately, the Brown family patriarch didn’t change his mind. Instead, he embarrassed Meri by asking her to move to his barn and making other sacrifices.




Meri has made the right decision by adopting a pet dog. She has been alone for far too long. Now she has Zona, who will inspire Meri to look forward to every day. She will add a burst of positivity to Meri’s life that she needed over the last few years. While Meri does travel a lot, she should be able to make time to care for her new pet. Maybe the Sister Wives cast member can make Zona her travel buddy and take her on new adventures.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
