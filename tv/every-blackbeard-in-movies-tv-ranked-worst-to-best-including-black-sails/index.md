## Literature Review

There have been many versions of the feared pirate over the years in both movies and television, with some versions ranking higher than others.




Blackbeard the Pirate has been seen in many movies and television shows over the years, but some of the media that portrays him have done it better than others. Born Edward Teach in 1680, Blackbeard was a feared pirate in the Caribbean during the 18th century. He married over 14 times during his life and eventually ran his ships aground, including the famous Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge, during a battle. He was eventually caught and killed in an attack in 1718, with his head later being fixed on a pike and shown off to scare other pirates (via Amherst College).
As one of the world&#39;s most famous pirates, his story and likeness have been told countless times across movies and television. Blackbeard has also been portrayed by multiple actors from Hugh Jackman to John Malkovich. Some depictions were much more historically accurate, while others took significant liberties with what&#39;s known about his life story.









 








 19  Pan (2015) 
Hugh Jackman


 







In this version of Blackbeard, the pirate is seen as the main antagonist in this Peter Pan prequel story. In it, Blackbeard uses magical Fairy Dust to keep himself from aging while getting revenge against Peter Pan and fighting against the ones who stole away his true love. Pan was a box office bomb for 2015, grossing only $124.8 million on a budget of $150 million. Hugh Jackman&#39;s portrayal of the famous pirate is overdone and extremely predictable for adult fans, not adding anything new to the Peter Pan story.





 18  The Boy and the Pirates 
Murvyn Vye
        

The Boy and the Pirates is a classic swashbuckler film for children, coming out in April 1960. It covers the story of a young boy who is transported back to the days of Blackbeard after making a wish on a brass jar. Murvyn Vye portrays this Blackbeard and is considerably tamer than more recent versions of the feared pirate. The movie was panned by the New York Times at its premiere and the kid-friendly atmosphere the movie is set in makes it feel unrealistic for people looking for thrills.





 17  Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides 
Ian McShane
        

Ian McShane has portrayed many villains throughout his career, from the fearsome Tai Lung in Kung Fu Panda to Captain Hook in Shrek the Third. But in the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean, McShane&#39;s version of Blackbeard is brought down, not by bad acting, but by the movie&#39;s plot. In this version, Blackbeard is the captain of a zombie crew looking for the Fountain of Youth and the father of Angelica, Jack Sparrow&#39;s former lover. Once again, it&#39;s repetitive and without Gore Verbinski at the helm, there was no chance for success.
            
 
 Which Is The Scariest Pirates of the Caribbean Movie? 
While all of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies have horror elements, only one of them can be considered the scariest outing in the franchise.








 16  Franco, Ciccio, and Blackbeard the Pirate (1969) 
Fernando Sancho
        

This version of Blackbeard is an Italian movie is based on Treasure Island. While it is an okay movie, there is no historical accuracy and there is a primary focus on the comedy side. The movie focuses on the son of a pirate who is on Blackbeard&#39;s bad side. While it is a funny movie, it is a hard movie to follow without a plot and Blackbeard&#39;s character is seen as comic relief rather than a fearsome villain.





 15  Doctor Who 
Gerry Wain
        

Doctor Who&#39;s Blackbeard only showed up briefly in an episode with the Second Doctor in 1968. Given his brief appearance, there is little known about him apart from a few moments with the Master. While it would have been great to see more action from Wain&#39;s Blackbeard, especially since Wain had a background as a stunt coordinator.





 14  Blackbeard (2006 Hallmark) 
Angus Macfadyen
        

While Hallmark movies are known for their over-saturated plots and cheesy endings, this version of Blackbeard is exactly that. Blackbeard tries to make it as historically accurate as possible, but it unfortunately still doesn&#39;t work. Angus Macfadyen&#39;s version is seen as a bad attempt at historical accuracy but with family friendliness attached and more focus on the costumes than the plot. Hallmark&#39;s focus on looks rather than accuracy hurt this movie and left it a bit silly.





 13  Jack of All Trades (2000) 
Tori Ahipene
        

This is one of the few Blackbeards present in a comedy version of the story. Jack of All Trades focuses on the comedy aspect rather than keeping things historically accurate. Blackbeard only plays a supporting role in this goofy comedy that makes absolutely no sense. The show focuses on an American spy who teams up with a British agent to stop Napoleon from taking over the world. When the heroes run into Blackbeard, he is charged with taking the captured Benjamin Franklin to Napoleon. For fans of comedy, it works great, but if audiences want historical accuracy, it falls flat.





 12  Crossbones 
John Malkovich
        

Crossbones was only on the air for a few short months in 2014, earning mixed reviews from critics for its historical inaccuracies and confusing plotlines. John Malkovich portrays Blackbeard in hiding after supposedly being killed ten years earlier. While Malkovich&#39;s portrayal of Blackbeard is good, the show&#39;s plot is lacking.





 11  Blackbeard the Pirate (1952) 
Robert Newton


 







Coming out in 1952, Blackbeard the Pirate is seen as a sleazy pirate who is only interested in beautiful women. While it is not overly gory or overly sexual, Robert Newton&#39;s version of the character is more funny than scary, leaving historical inaccuracies to the wind. Starring Keith Andes, Robert Newton, and Linda Darnell, this film is a classic swashbuckler film of the 1950s and focuses on the damsel-in-distress portion rather than the excitement of the pirates.





 10  Blackbeard&#39;s Ghost (1968) 
Peter Ustinov
        

Disney&#39;s first version of Blackbeard may be kid-friendly, but is considered a classic for children who grew up in the 1960s. First released in theaters in 1968, this version of Blackbeard has him visiting the modern world. Starring Dean Jones as Steve and Peter Ustinov as Blackbeard, it sees the spirit of Blackbeard roaming around Earth until he can do something good. Unfortunately for him, Steve is the only one who can see or hear him. It was well-received by critics and has an 82% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.





 9  Voyage of the Bottom of the Sea (1964 TV Show) 
Malachi Throne
        

Pirates were a very common theme in the 1960s, as children loved watching swashbuckling adventures. The 1960s&#39; TV show Voyage of the Bottom of the Sea sees the adventures of a crew as they explore the sea in the world&#39;s first nuclear submarine and deal with several undersea monsters. In season 4, episode 14, &#34;The Return of Blackbeard&#34;, Malachi Throne guest stars as Blackbeard as he attempts to take over the Seaview while the crew is safeguarding a U.S. President. While not historically accurate, it is very funny and gives a lighthearted view to the fearsome pirate.





 8  Blackbeard: Terror at Sea (2005) 
James Purefoy
        

This version of Blackbeard is a reenactment in a documentary film with historical accuracy and plot as the primary focus. Starring James Purefoy from Pennyworth as the fearsome pirate, Blackbeard: Terror at Sea was released on BBC and National Geographic to okay reviews from critics. The ending of the movie stays honest about what happened to Blackbeard in real life and comes with plenty of narration from real-life historians, making it one of the best adaptions of Blackbeard out there.





 7  Legends of Tomorrow 
Jonathon Cake
        

With Blackbeard the topic of many supernatural storylines on television, its no surprise that this Blackbeard has been portrayed on DC&#39;s Legends of Tomorrow. In season 3, episode 12, &#34;The Curse of the Earth Totem&#34;, Blackbeard boards the Waverider during the Legends&#39; search for the Earth Totem. While it can be a bit jarring to see Blackbeard in the modern world, Jonathon Cake makes the character his own and focuses on keeping him close to the original version, albeit with several changes.





 6  The Time Squad 
Roger Rose
        

The only animated version of Blackbeard on this list, this television show is primarily meant for children learning about history. Originally coming out on Cartoon Network in 2001, this series focused on teaching kids about history with a twist. It is set in 100,000,000 AD and features a trio of kids who meet historical figures who are no longer on the path of their real story. Voiced by Roger Rose, the show was brought to an untimely end in 2003, leaving it unable to reach its full potential, but Blackbeard&#39;s story is still as funny and focuses more on the pirate saving the environment.





 5  Once Upon a Time (2011) 
Charles Mesure
        

Once Upon a Time has had its fair share of villains throughout the show&#39;s run. Known as Black Beard in this version, he is seen as taking control of Hook&#39;s ship, the Jolly Roger and locking Prince Eric away on Hangman&#39;s Island during the first curse. While Charles Mesure&#39;s Black Beard does not die in the show, he ends up cursing out Hook for stealing his ship after the third curse is enacted, leaving his fate unknown. While it is a bit disappointing that Black Beard does not get defeated and is only featured briefly, Mesure&#39;s portrayal still has an impact.





 4  Our Flag Means Death 
Taika Waititi
        

This Blackbeard is comedy-based but was well-received by critics at its premiere in March 2022. Unlike other HBO shows, the show was well-receieved for its portrayal of the LGBTQ community. Despite being cancelled after two seasons, Our Flag Means Death gives a more romanticized version of piracy with plenty of comedy bits tossed in. Taika Waititi&#39;s Blackbeard is funny and chaotic, leaving historical accuracy up in the air. Despite this, Waititi&#39;s Blackbeard is as crazy as history describes him.





 3  Horrible Histories 
Jim Howick
        

Horrible Histories has won many awards around the world for its approach to history with children. This version of the famed pirate comes with a song and dance, leaving the goriness and violence behind. Jim Howick has portrayed many characters on Horrible Histories and he portrays Blackbeard with humor and accuracy. The show also teaches the true story of Blackbeard, but without the gore, which is good for children who are pirate fans or just want to learn about history.





 2   







 1  Black Sails 
Ray Stevenson


 







The best and most accurate version of Blackbeard, Black Sails gives a realistic version of the Golden Age of Piracy complete with plenty of sex and gore to make it likable for pirate fans. The late Ray Stevenson&#39;s Blackbeard is every bit as frightening as one would expect from a Starz show with as much accuracy towards character as possible. As a prequel to Treasure Island, Black Sails shows how Captain Flint became the fearsome pirate that crews learned to fear. The show tries to stay as close to history as possible with Blackbeard, even trying to keep his death as accurate as possible.
