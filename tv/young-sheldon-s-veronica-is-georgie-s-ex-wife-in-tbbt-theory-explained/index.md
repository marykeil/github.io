## Literature Review

Veronica may currently be absent in Young Sheldon, but she could come back and become one of Georgie&#39;s ex-wives as revealed in The Big Bang Theory.




Though she hasn&#39;t appeared since season 3, Veronica from Young Sheldon may end up as Georgie&#39;s ex-wife in the future. Given that Young Sheldon is a prequel, a portion of the Coopers&#39; future has already been revealed in The Big Bang Theory. That includes George&#39;s cheating scandal and subsequent death, Missy&#39;s divorce, and Sheldon&#39;s Nobel Prize in Physics win. As for Georgie, he has a very successful life ahead of him being the owner of Dr. Tire – the biggest tire dealership in Texas. Unfortunately, his love life wouldn&#39;t be going as smoothly as he would like.




Season 6 saw Georgie&#39;s daughter born to Mandy, and the two agreed to get married. Despite this, many are still wondering what happened to Veronica on Young Sheldon and if she and Georgie end up together. Veronica debuted in Young Sheldon season 2, episode 6, with her final appearance in season 3, episode 17. If a popular theory comes to fruition, Veronica could return and marry Georgie. As revealed in TBBT, Georgie first got married when he was 19. It&#39;s possible, given their contentious nature, that Georgie and Mandy may not go through with the wedding.

No explanation has been given regarding what happened to Veronica on Young Sheldon. This means that she could still exist in the show, but she just hasn&#39;t been featured again. This makes sense considering that Georgie had been busy with his latest girlfriend, Mandy, and her pregnancy. However, that relationship is tumultuous at best. Given their serious age difference and the sad reason behind Georgie&#39;s TBBT sacrifice, the relationship is hanging by a thread. It may seem out of left field, but if Georgie and Mandy call off the wedding, this could be the perfect time to bring Veronica back.

Young Sheldon Has Gradually Added New Context To Old Plot Holes
          

One of the purposes of a prequel is to flesh out the content seen in its parent series, and Young Sheldon has the opportunity to shed even more light on the character. If what happened to Veronica on Young Sheldon turns out to be that she&#39;s the woman that Georgie marries, fans may gain further insight into why the marriage fails, as they&#39;ll have the chance to watch a relationship that&#39;s inevitably doomed. This is the same appeal that George Sr. and Mary&#39;s relationship has.




While the basics of what happened between them are clear from The Big Bang Theory, it still adds dramatic heft to see exactly what happens. What TBBT has revealed about the Cooper siblings is just enough to keep audiences on the line, and the storyline could bring further depth to Young Sheldon as Veronica was Georgie&#39;s first love. Unfortunately, even if this turns out to be the case, Georgie and Veronica don&#39;t seem like they&#39;re meant to be together.

As revealed in The Big Bang Theory, Georgie split up with his first wife and married another unnamed woman. However, by the time he visited Pasadena for his brother&#39;s wedding, he was single again. In any case, at least Young Sheldon can fill plot holes and narrative gaps regarding the character&#39;s arc in the franchise.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7: Release Date, Cast, Story, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   The wildly successful Big Bang Theory spinoff series Young Sheldon has followed the genius for six seasons, and here&#39;s what we know about season 7.   






 Who Could Georgie&#39;s Ex-Wife Be If It&#39;s Not Veronica? 
Young Sheldon&#39;s New Spinoff Confirms Mandy And Georige&#39;s Continued Relationship
                                                                

While the theory that there could be a return of Veronica on Young Sheldon, the recently announced Georgie and Mandy spinoff series all but confirms that will not be the case. Alongside Veronica, the next and most obvious option to fill the role of Georgie&#39;s first wife is Mandy. The pair had a tumultuous start, with both of them lying about their respective ages when they first met. When the truth came out, Mandy, who was nearing 30 years old, was rightfully horrified that she had a tryst with a 17-year-old boy.

Things didn&#39;t ease up for the pair when Mandy realized she was pregnant — though Georgie assured her he&#39;d be &#34;18 in March.&#34; Regardless, they managed to couple up and Mandy gave birth to their daughter. The Young Sheldon season 6 finale saw Georgie proposing to Mandy, hinting that she&#39;s probably his first wife that&#39;s described in The Big Bang Theory. The only obstacle that stands in the way of Georgie and Mandy&#39;s nuptials, besides themselves, is George Sr., who didn&#39;t at first approve of the relationship.




It appears as though they will be sticking together for the foreseeable future as they will star in a new Young Sheldon spinoff. Interestingly, they star in a new series together even though fans already know they don&#39;t work out. It remains to be seen if the show will feature the gradual unraveling of their marriage or if they will break up before Young Sheldon ends and the show will be about them raising their child as a divorced couple. Either way, it suggests Veronica will not be returning.
