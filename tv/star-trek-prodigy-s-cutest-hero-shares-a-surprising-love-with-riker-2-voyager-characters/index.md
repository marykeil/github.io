## Literature Review
Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s Murf shares a passion with such Starfleet luminaries as Will Riker and two members of the USS Voyager crew. But what is it?




Murf (Dee Bradley Baker), the cutest of Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s young alien heroes, shares a surprising passion with Captain William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and two Star Trek: Voyager characters. Murf is one of the most enigmatic of Prodigy&#39;s diverse cast of characters and revealed a few big surprises over the course of season 1. From their ability to ingest a protostar to their super-strength, Murf will likely reveal more hidden depths when Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 drops on Netflix.




Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s Mellanoid slime worm also has a surprising connection with Riker, and Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) and the Doctor (Robert Picardo). Murf will meet Voyager&#39;s Doctor in Prodigy season 2, during which they can indulge in their shared passion. It&#39;s unclear at this stage if the Doctor and Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) will be joined by other Voyager alumni for Prodigy season 2. Garrett Wang has hinted at the potential for the clarinet playing Harry Kim to appear in Prodigy, which could give Murf a further chance to pursue the love of jazz that he shares with three Star Trek legends.

                  13 Star Trek Legacy Characters In Prodigy Season 1   The USS Protostar&#39;s ragtag young heroes encounter over a dozen Star Trek legacy characters, many voiced by the original actors, in Prodigy season 1.    


 Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s Murf Shares A Love Of Jazz With Riker &amp; Voyager&#39;s Doctor &amp; Harry Kim 
          




In Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, episode 17, &#34;Ghost in the Machine&#34;, the crew of the USS Protostar are trapped inside the holodeck. As they move through simulations inspired by each of their characters, the Protostar crew walk into a jazz club where it&#39;s revealed that Murf, under the alias Mr. Murfy No-Shoes is a talented dancer and jazz singer. Although Zero (Angus Imrie) suggests that Murf is lip-syncing, the Mellanoid slime worm puts on quite a show. Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s Riker is obviously a big fan of jazz, and a skilled trombone player, and Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Harry Kim is a keen clarinet player who had his own band, the Kimtones.

Harry Kim&#39;s Kimtones appeared in Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s musical episode, &#34;Virtuoso&#34;, in which they performed for a group of alien dignitaries. The Doctor&#39;s informed and enthusiastic introduction to the band hints at an appreciation for jazz and swing, even though his first love is opera. With Murf joining the crew of the USS Voyager-A in Star Trek: Prodigy season 2, there&#39;s the potential for a Kimtones reunion, with the Mellanoid slime worm and the EMH Doctor on vocals, and maybe even a visiting Will Riker on trombone.






 Will Harry Kim Join Voyager&#39;s Doctor For Prodigy Season 2? 
         

Star Trek: Prodigy will feature the brand-new USS Voyager-A, Admiral Janeway, the Doctor, and Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran), but it&#39;s unknown if more Star Trek: Voyager veterans will join season 2&#39;s rescue mission. Star Trek: Picard season 3 showrunner Terry Matalas had wanted to give Harry Kim a cameo, but was told that the character &#34;belongs to Prodigy.&#34; This is a tantalizing tease that Star Trek&#39;s eternal ensign could appear in Prodigy season 2, hopefully with a well-deserved promotion.

Sending the USS Voyager-A into an uncharted alternate future to rescue Chakotay mirrors the fate of its namesake. During Star Trek: Voyager, the crew&#39;s spirits were lifted by holodeck simulations, and live music performances by Harry Kim and the Doctor. It would be fitting if Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s Murf joined those two Voyager veterans to ensure that the USS Voyager-A really swings.






Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 is streaming now on Netflix.
