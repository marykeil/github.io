## Literature Review
While Squid Game: The Challenge players weren&#39;t all strangers, some were booted from the series before its start for breaking their sequester rules.




Squid Game: The Challenge has been an overnight sensation for Netflix viewers and some of the contestants are speaking out about their experiences prior to the series, revealing secrets from the earliest stage of the game. Stephen Lomas, player 243, was a part of the big alliance featured in the first several episodes, the Gganbu Gang. As some of the strongest players in the game, Stephen and the rest of the Gganbu Gang were major assets to the competition but ultimately got eliminated throughout the second half of the game. Despite not being around for the entirety of the competition, Stephen is opening up about his experience online.




In a recent post on his Instagram, Stephen shared some behind-the-scenes information about his time on Squid Game: The Challenge season 1. While he didn’t give anything major away, Stephen shared that in the initial sequester the competitors had for the series prior to its 2-week filming period, several potential players were ejected for breaking the rules. “[We were] not allowed to interact or talk to each other,” Stephen explained.


 

Stephen shared that despite being unable to interact, some potential contestants were trying to sneak around to pass the time in sequester. “Some people got caught sneaking into each other’s rooms and hooking up so they got booted from the show.” While he wasn&#39;t someone who had that exact experience, Stephen shared that his own time in sequester was different.

While Stephen didn’t try sneaking into anyone’s room to hook up, he was caught sneaking into his friend Chase Lawson’s hotel room during the Squid Game: The Challenge sequester. After trying to sneak into Chase’s room and getting caught by the handlers responsible for keeping the contestants apart, the pair were nervous they were going to be thrown out of the game before it could even begin. Thankfully, since Chase and Stephen already knew each other, Stephen shared that, “they were like, ‘Oh, they came here together anyway so they’re fine’.” Thankfully, being pre-existing friends, Chase and Stephen were able to avoid being kicked out of sequester.





 

While Stephen made it roughly halfway through the game, his friend Chase wasn’t as lucky. The pair came into the game together and were excited to compete on one of the most interesting new reality TV series after nearly a lifetime of friendship. While Stephen made it through the first challenge of Squid Game: The Challenge, Chase had a tough time in the initial competition, Red Light, Green Light. After losing who he hoped to be his closest ally in the game, Stephen worked quickly to make a new alliance in the game that could benefit him in the long run.

With Stephen’s insight into the sequester experience before Squid Game: The Challenge, viewers can better understand how the contestants get into the game. After dealing with the isolation of sequester, the challengers were excited to get into the game. Unfortunately for the majority, like Chase, the elimination of Red Light, Green Light took out over half the competition. The rest of Squid Game: The Challenge’s participants, like Stephen, had a more difficult time in the game as it carried on.
