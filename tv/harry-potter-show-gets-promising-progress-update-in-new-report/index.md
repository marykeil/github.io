## Literature Review

Warner Bros.&#39;s plans for a Harry Potter TV show get a promising update with a new report detailing a major step forward for the project.




Warner Bros.’s plans for a Harry Potter television reboot have gotten a promising update courtesy of a new report. First announced in April last year, Warner Bros.’s Max streaming service is set to undertake an unprecedented ten-year commitment to remake J.K. Rowling’s best-selling Harry Potter novels into a new streaming show. This latest move will see a whole new cast selected to play the iconic roles, despite the previous movie adaptations only coming to an end in 2011.




According to Deadline, work on the project is moving ahead with a variety of writers presenting their pitches to Max and Warner Bros. Television in the hopes of landing the coveted task of bringing Harry Potter back to the screen. Some of the writers mentioned in the report include Martha Hillier (The Last Kingdom), Kathleen Jordan (Teenage Bounty Hunters), Tom Moran (The Devil’s Hour) and Michael Lesslie (The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes). It is reported the first round of pitches occurred in L.A. this week, with the top picks set to head to the U.K.


 Why A Harry Potter Television Series Could Surpass The Movies 
          

When news of the Harry Potter television reboot first broke in April 2023, reactions were mixed among the property’s extensive fanbase. While the original Harry Potter movies starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint often omitted or changed several key moments from the original books, many felt that it was still far too early to reboot the property with a new cast. Yet, despite some initial hesitation among potential viewers, Warner Bros.’s plans for a multi-season show spanning all seven Harry Potter books has the potential to deliver a far more faithful and nuanced adaptation of Rowling’s works.




                  12 Book Changes The Harry Potter Remake Should Make   The Max Harry Potter TV show promised to be a more faithful adaptation of the Harry Potter books, but it should make some changes to the books.   

Despite the original movies evolving to become a pop culture phenomenon with few equals, the constraints of needing to adhere to a typical theatrical runtime often led to creative decisions that saw the films deviate from the source material. Simplifying several key plot points and leaving out entire characters like the mischievous Hogwarts ghost Peeves, the Harry Potter television show provides a unique opportunity to revisit the source material and correct the assorted omissions and oversights made by the original movies.

Moreover, the new Harry Potter television series will also have a distinct advantage previously denied to the directors responsible for the movie adaptations. As Rowling was still in the process of writing the final books in her series at the same time that the movie adaptations were being made, the earlier movies were not able to draw from a complete and accurate understanding of where the story was heading. Now, however, whoever is given the task of heading up the television adaptation will have the added benefit of being able to draw from an already completed book series.
