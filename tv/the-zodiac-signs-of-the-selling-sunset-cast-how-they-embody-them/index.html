  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The zodiac signs of Selling Sunset cast members greatly influence their personalities and behaviors.   Chrishell Stause&rsquo;s growth reflects the defensive yet gentle nature of many Cancers.   Each cast member&rsquo;s zodiac sign contributes to their unique traits and roles on the show.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From their personality to their dating type, a cast member&rsquo;s zodiac sign can share the little details about how they behave on Selling Sunset.</p>
<p>With Selling Sunset season 7 wrapped, the hit Netflix reality series continues to thrive because of its cast members, all of whom have zodiac signs that impact their personalities. Selling Sunset season 6 shocked fans with the drama and new feuds developing in The Oppenheim Group. How the cast members handle confrontations, such as crashing birthday parties or asking for a one-on-one talk, not only makes the show one of the best drama-filled reality shows to binge on Netflix, but also reflects their unique personalities.</p>
<p>Many fans would agree that the traits of many cast members derive from their zodiac sign. Zodiac signs can define a person&rsquo;s emotions and influence their behaviors, and it&rsquo;s no different for the cast of Selling Sunset. By knowing the Selling Sunset cast birthdays, fans can understand the logic behind each cast member being more defensive or shy than another.</p>
<p>Chrishell Stause
July 21, 1981: Cancer</p>
<p>Chrishell Stause&rsquo;s birthday is July 21, 1981, and she defines the personality of many Cancers that fans know and love. Fans watched Chrishell have a tough season 3 with an unexpected divorce and managing the horrible press. However, like many Cancers who are self-protective and sensitive, she was vulnerable on camera, often shedding tears and describing her heartbreak.</p>
<p>Chrishell took the time to nurture herself and return to the show stronger than ever by buying her own house and cutting out the toxic energy from Christine and Davina. Chrishell&rsquo;s character growth on the show embodies the attitude of many Cancers who are defensive yet gentle to themselves and their loved ones. Additionally, she showed her ability to fight back for those she loves in seasons 6 and 7 as she defended herself against villains Nicole Young and Jason Oppenheim&rsquo;s ex, Marie-Lou Nurk. Arguably, Chrishell is now in her villain era.</p>
<p>Christine Quinn
October 14, 1988- Libra</p>
<p>Christine Quinn was born on October 14, 1988, and was the show&rsquo;s villain through season 5. Her Libra energy sees her aiming to be refined and have harmony in all areas of life. Though fans may not see these qualities because of Christine&rsquo;s desire to rule the office, she tries to provide a sense of equality in her way.</p>
<p>In fact, Christine&rsquo;s welcoming nature, typical of Libras, is seen in her relationship with the new cast members Vanessa Villela in season 4 and Chelsea Lazkani in season 5. Her desire for tranquility is also seen when she admits to missing Mary and their friendship. However, Christine&rsquo;s desire for diplomacy is not always possible because of her unwillingness to acknowledge her mistakes.</p>
<p>Heather Rae El Moussa
September 16, 1987- Virgo</p>
<p>Born September 16, 1987, Heather Rae El Moussa is a Virgo upholding the typical traits of being shy but analytical. As such, Heather usually keeps to herself and focuses her energy on herself and her husband, Tarek. She also knows when to put herself first, abandoning her loyalty to Christine after realizing her co-star&rsquo;s priority is always maintaining her image.</p>
<p>Heather shows fans that while she may sometimes be in her own world, she has sharp senses in social settings and knows herself well. In fact, during season 4, Heather admitted to rashes appearing on her body when she is stressed and uses these signs to detect the issue in her social life. While Heather is no longer on the show, she is a cast member who will be missed.</p>
<p>Amanza Smith
December 12, 1976- Sagittarius</p>
<p>Amanza Smith is a Sagittarius born on December 12, 1976. Sagittarius signs are known for their independence and outspokenness. Amanza embodies these traits in her work as an agent and interior designer and in her love for her children.</p>
<p>Her journey as a single mom has had its ups and downs, but her work ethic gave her a new level of independence from her ex-partner. In addition, she made the decision to take legal action against her husband despite the unwanted outcome of him not being present. Amanza&rsquo;s outspokenness made her a villain in Selling Sunset season 7, but she didn&rsquo;t mean to stir the spot. Her actions and big heart underline how Amanza embodies the bold traits of the Sagittarius sign.</p>
<p>Jason Oppenheim
April 12, 1977- Aries</p>
<p>One of the founding members of The Oppenheim Group, Jason Oppenheim, is an Aries born on April 12, 1977. Jason is regarded for his leadership skills, pushing agents to their fullest potential and testing their real estate knowledge.</p>
<p>He has the Aries trait of being aggressive in his leadership style, exemplified in confrontations on the show, like when he questioned Christine about her office dynamics or confronted Davina about re-joining the team. His Aries energy always underscores his position as leader of the team and the measures he takes.</p>
<p>Romain Bonnet
June 18, 1993- Gemini</p>
<p>Romain Bonnet is a Gemini born on June 18, 1993. Geminis are regarded as being talkative and adaptable. Romain is open to creating a fun space for Mary and her friends to have a &ldquo;Girls&rsquo; Night&rdquo; at their place but also adapts his fun-loving attitude to defend Mary in social settings.</p>
<p>Romain&rsquo;s attitude can also differ depending on who he is around, which is another typical trait of the Gemini sign. For instance, his changing opinion of Davina from the show&rsquo;s beginning to season 4 indicates his versatility as a fun partygoer and his intuitiveness about people and their intentions. He also was a supportive and robust partner to Mary when she miscarried in season 7.</p>
<p>Vanessa Villela
January 28, 1978- Aquarius</p>
<p>Although she left after Selling Sunset season 5, Vanessa Villela was a short-lived cast member born on January 28, 1978. She is an Aquarius, and her attitude reflects the common Aquarius traits of being assertive, optimistic, and idealistic. Vanessa aims to keep the peace in the office by being the bridge between Christine and the other agents. She even goes out of her way to give Christine resources to heal, hoping to resolve the conflict in the office to hope for a better team experience.</p>
<p>Maya Vander
March 12, 1982- Pisces</p>
<p>Maya Vander is a Pisces born on March 12, 1982. Maya is free-spirited and compassionate. Unlike many agents in the office, Maya does not share a lot of her thoughts or personal life. In addition, she chooses to not look at situations in a one-sided manner. Pisces&rsquo; reserved and sympathetic nature is seen in her relationship with Christine. She looks at the reasoning and all perspectives of Christine&rsquo;s actions. And as a Pisces, Maya thinks with her heart and hopes for the best. She was one of the least dramatic cast members and was missed after she departed from Selling Sunset.</p>
<p>Brett Oppenheim
April 12, 1977- Aries</p>
<p>Brett Oppenheim is another co-founder of The Oppenheim Group and was born as an Aries on April 12, 1977. Like his twin brother, he shares the same Aries qualities of leadership and aggression but is straightforward, which explains why their group is one of the best in the real estate industry.</p>
<p>Unlike Jason, Brett has the Aries quality of being very direct about what he expects or wants. He makes decisions that he knows are best for the team rather than considering a strategy that accommodates every person&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
<p>Mary Fitzgerald Bonnet
September 24, 1983- Libra</p>
<p>Mary Fitzgerald is a Libra born on September 24, 1983. She is not afraid to express her emotions and be open to confrontation, trying to stop the endless drama seen on screen between her and Christine. Her ability to be fair defines her early relationship with Christine, but Mary decides to cut her out of her life to demonstrate her respect for herself.</p>
<p>Like many Libras, Mary is respectful and diplomatic, traits also seen in her fellow Libra Christine. However, the two do differ in some areas of their personalities. While Christine was happy to perpetuate drama, Mary wanted a fair, respectful relationship with Christine. Unfortunately, her diplomatic role didn&rsquo;t last long. She stepped away from her role as office manager when mitigating drama was impacting her ability to do her job.</p>
<p>Tarek El Moussa
August 21, 1981- Leo</p>
<p>On August 21, 1981, Tarek El Moussa was born a Leo. Heather&rsquo;s partner goes out of his way to soothe Heather and support her endeavors as an agent. His generosity and warmth in lifting Heather up demonstrate his Leo traits. Tarek always encourages Heather to be her best self, such as telling her not to let Christine take control of her attitude and leaving before she regrets something.</p>
<p>Emma Hernan - Cancer</p>
<p>Emma Hernan is a Cancer born on July 14, 1991. An iconic moment for many fans, Emma made a bold entrance on the show - openly discussing her relationship with Christine despite not knowing how others may react in the office. Like many Cancers, Emma is gentle but defensive about her business and identity as she gracefully navigates working with other cast members. Emma defines boss energy as handling multiple businesses, but when cast members cross a line, she does not engage. Interestingly, her best friend, Chrishell, is also a Cancer.</p>
<p>Davina Potratz
December 29, 1980- Capricorn</p>
<p>Davina Potratz was born on December 29, 1980, and is a Capricorn. Davina tried her best to outdo everyone in the office. Her ambition reflected the main trait of a Capricorn. However, it didn&rsquo;t always work in her favor, as it has cost her reputation as a realtor by overpricing a listing and causing mistrust with Jason and Brett. Davina left after Selling Sunset season 5 to pursue other opportunities.</p>
<p>Chelsea Lazkani
January 26, 1993- Aquarius</p>
<p>Chelsea Lazkani joined Selling Sunset in season 5 and is an Aquarius sign, famously celebrating her 30th birthday in Selling Sunset season 7. An Aquarius is an Air sign who is unique, strong, social, and doesn&rsquo;t want to be bored. Aquarius signs are also said to enjoy life to be fun and full of curiosity.</p>
<p>Chelsea and Christine saw each other as kindred spirits and became friends at the beginning of season 5. However, she made friends with most women after Christine&rsquo;s exit, excluding Bre Tiesi, with whom she has a feud. Chelsea is smart, fun-loving, and excellent at what she does.</p>
<p>Nicole Young
June 14, 1970- Gemini</p>
<p>Nicole Young was born on June 14, 1970, making her a Gemini. This astrology sign is known for being two-faced, and Nicole certainly has that trait in spades. She started a feud with Chrishell and proceeded to act like the victim. Geminis are also known for being quick-witted, and the life of the party, but that side to Nicole hasn&rsquo;t been seen since she&rsquo;s been too busy sparring with the other ladies in the office. However, she has the trademark personality traits of intelligence and adaptability.</p>
<p>Bre Tiesi
May 4, 1991- Taurus</p>
<p>Bre Tiesi was born May 4, 1991, making her a headstrong Taurus. Nick Cannon&rsquo;s baby mama made waves when she joined Selling Sunset season 6. Like most folks with a Taurus sun sign, Bre is reliable and persistent in becoming a great realtor with the Oppenheim Group. She holds her cards close to her chest and has a rugged exterior but is warm to those close to her, like Heather, Chrishell, and Emma. However, she defends herself against Chelsea, not afraid to fight for herself. It&rsquo;s unknown if Bre will return for Selling Sunset season 8, but she&rsquo;s been an iconic cast member.</p>
