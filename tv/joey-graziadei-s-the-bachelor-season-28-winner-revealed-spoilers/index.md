Summary

  The Bachelor season 28 is set to premiere in January, but the winner has already been revealed: Joey Graziadei is engaged to Daisy Kent.   Excitement builds as fans eagerly await the upcoming season to see how Joey and Daisy&#39;s love story unfolds.   Reality Steve reveals that Lea Cayanan receives Joey&#39;s First Impression Rose.  







The Bachelor season 28 premieres in January, but Joey Graziadei has completed filming, and his winner has been revealed. Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro, is originally from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, but currently lives in Koloa, Hawaii. He got his start in Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season when he was her runner-up. Charity got engaged to Dotun Olubeko, leaving Joey heartbroken. However, Joey was soon asked to be the next Bachelor lead, and he accepted.

According to an Instagram post from Reality Steve, The Bachelor season 28 star Joey is engaged to Daisy Kent, a 25-year-old from Becker, Minnesota.


 

Reality Steve also revealed that Joey&#39;s runner-up is Kelsey Anderson, a 25-year-old from Leesville, Louisiana, while Rachel Nance, a 26-year-old from Honolulu, Hawaii, placed third. Rachel was eliminated at the rose ceremony after the overnight Fantasy Suite dates.

 Who Receives Joey Graziadei&#39;s First Impression Rose? 
          

In his column, Reality Steve revealed that, during The Bachelor season 28 premiere night, Joey gave his First Impression Rose to Lea Cayanan, a 23-year-old from Aiea, Hawaii. On Charity&#39;s &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; episode, Lea was given an envelope that she wasn&#39;t allowed to open until night one. The envelope ended up containing a letter that gave her the chance to steal a one-on-one date from another woman at any point during the season. However, Lea threw the letter in the fire because she wanted Joey to choose her and didn&#39;t want to have to steal a date from someone else. This resulted in Joey giving Lea the First Impression Rose.

It&#39;s very admirable that Lea didn&#39;t want to use the advantage she received to steal one of Joey&#39;s one-on-one dates from another woman. More and more, the producers have been manipulating The Bachelor to create drama. However, the show shouldn&#39;t be seen as a game, but rather as a way for people to find true love. Lea wouldn&#39;t have wanted to force Joey to take her on a date that he intended for someone else to have. This way, their relationship could progress more naturally.




It&#39;s exciting to hear that Joey had a successful season and got engaged to Daisy. During Charity&#39;s season, Joey really seemed ready for an engagement, so it&#39;s no surprise that he was willing to propose. If Joey and Daisy&#39;s relationship lasts, they&#39;ll be on a very short list of Bachelor couples who ended their seasons together and survived post-show, including Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici (married), Matt James and Rachael Kirkconnell (dating), and Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar (engaged). Hopefully, Joey and Daisy&#39;s engagement will lead to marriage and children, and a long, happy, and healthy life together.

The Bachelor season 28 premieres Monday, January 22, 2024, at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
