## Literature Review
Leslie Fhima opens up about being on The Golden Bachelor, explaining that she was surprised to see who made it to the final 2 with her.




The Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima shared that she wasn’t expecting to see Theresa Nist as one of the final 2 women vying for Gerry Turner’s heart. Along with Leslie and Theresa, a large group of women joined Gerry for The Golden Bachelor season 1 in the hopes that they’d find a love to last for the rest of their lives. After losing his wife Toni in 2017, Gerry was heartbroken and bereft for years but finally put himself out there when he joined Bachelor Nation as the first Golden Bachelor star in the franchise. After a long, emotional season, Gerry proposed to Theresa in the finale, leaving Leslie heartbroken.




In a recent interview with the Bachelor Happy Hour podcast (via Us Weekly), Leslie revealed that she was shocked that Gerry chose Theresa over Faith Martin in the final 3, explaining that she and Faith shared a “special bond” that they formed during the season. “I [watched their breakup],” Leslie explained, “[and] my heart broke for her...I remember that night, we were just sitting separately. Not speaking, waiting. I wanted to talk to her so bad, but we couldn’t really talk to each other.” Leslie shared that she “really, really thought” she would be in the finale with Faith, not Theresa.

While both Leslie and Faith made it to the final 3, Leslie was floored to find out that she would be in the final 2 with Theresa. “I was shocked...I wish I could have...cried with her [after Gerry broke things off],” Leslie explained. While Leslie knew that Gerry had told both her and Faith he loved them, she didn’t know at the time he’d also said it to Theresa. Early on, Leslie and Faith were two of the frontrunners for Gerry’s heart as the start of their journey on The Golden Bachelor made it clear their connections were quite strong. The women were shocked to find his connection with Theresa was stronger.





 

Faith earned Gerry’s first impression rose and was a fan-favorite pick prior to her elimination. After winning Gerry’s heart and the hearts of Bachelor Nation, it was shocking to see her gut-wrenching elimination. While Leslie didn’t get exactly the same treatment from Bachelor Nation, her story was compelling from early on in the season. Though she didn’t win Gerry’s heart in the end, she made a huge impact, as there was a lot of support for her to be the woman he proposed to in the end.

Though Leslie and Faith may not have found lasting love with Gerry, both women had an exceptional experience on The Golden Bachelor, finding friendship, community, and opening up the possibility for new opportunities. There&#39;s a lot of speculation about The Golden Bachelorette, with the hopes that Leslie, Faith, or one of the other lovely contestants from Gerry’s season will get the chance to take the lead role. Though it’s not clear if either woman will get to be in control of their own season, The Golden Bachelor led them to each other, forming a friendship that they hope will last longer than their fame from the series.
