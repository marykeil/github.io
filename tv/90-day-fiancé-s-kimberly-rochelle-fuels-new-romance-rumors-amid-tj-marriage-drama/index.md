## Literature Review
After failing to adjust to her new life with TJ Goswami’s family in India, 90 Day Fiancé’s Kimberly Rochelle hints at her journey to find “new love.”




Kimberly Rochelle from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way sparked relationship rumors with her latest Instagram post. The 30-year-old woman left her house in Alabama to build a home with her 33-year-old Indian beau, Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami. However, she couldn’t impress her boyfriend’s family, which led to onscreen drama. Kimberly made enemies with TJ’s brother, Yash, and failed to build a friendly connection with her mother-in-law. Eventually, she got really scared of marrying TJ due to his family’s visible lack of support. While she did tie the knot with TJ, Kimberly soon returned to the United States.




Kimberly has been quiet about her relationship status with TJ for some time. Recently, she shared a photo of herself from her airplane seat, showing an American plane outside. Kimberly captioned it, “I am commmiiinnnngggg toooo youuuuuu,” without revealing who she was talking to.


 

Kimberly’s post and hashtags, such as “#finalflight” and “travellove,” confused many 90 Day Fiancé fans, who speculated that maybe someone new had come into her life. A social media user asked, “A new love already?” Another commented, “Have you found new love?” Unfortunately, Kimberly didn’t reveal much about her new adventure to Colorado.

 All About Kimberly &amp; TJ&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Split Rumors 
          

It’s understandable why fans think that Kimberly has found another partner. Recently, the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 cast members have sparked breakup rumors on social media. In early November 2023, the Alabama-based reality star answered her followers candidly. She revealed that she isn’t in India anymore, adding, “Whenever I am in India, I’m not happy.” Kimberly isn’t the only one who has hinted at her separation. TJ has also been posting cryptic posts and lonely videos. Recently, the Indian reality star celebrated Diwali, but Kimberly was nowhere in his video.

Kimberly’s lack of response to the comments has fueled her split rumors with TJ. However, there&#39;s a chance she wasn’t referring to another man in her caption. Kimberly has lived in the United States all her life. Therefore, she may have been talking to her American friends and referring to them in the post. TJ’s reaction to Kimberly’s plane photo is a major clue that supports this theory. The Indian man liked his wife’s post, which suggests he knew where she was going. The couple may still be together but aren’t interacting due to contractual restrictions.




Still, it wouldn’t be wrong if Kimberly has, in fact, decided to dump her husband to be with another man in Colorado. She was extremely incompatible with her Indian husband, and the daily family arguments impacted her mental health. To make matters worse, TJ rarely stood up to his family to defend her honor. Kimberly would be completely justified if she picked another man over TJ. She would be a great fit for someone who shares her hobbies and lives somewhere in the United States, like Colorado.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
