## Literature Review
Rebecca Yarros&#39;s book Fourth Wing is being adapted into a TV series, but it faces challenges similar to another renowned fantasy series adaptation.




A live-action TV adaptation of the fantasy novel Fourth Wing is currently in the works, but there is a potential challenge that may hinder its success, which another popular series faced. Fourth Wing was written by Rebecca Yarros and released on May 2, 2023. The novel became viral on TikTok&#39;s BookTok community and reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list 13 weeks after its release. The story follows twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail, who is forced into the Riders Quadrant at Basgiath War College by her mother to become a dragon rider.




As the narrative unfolds, it delves into an expansive world where Violet must not only work to survive but also uncover the truth behind the threat of outside forces and an impending war. Yarros has stated that the Empyrean series will consist of 5 books, with two already released. Amazon MGM Studios and Michael B. Jordan&#39;s Outlier Society acquired the rights to Yarros&#39;s books, Fourth Wing, and its sequel Iron Flame, and are developing them into a television series. However, there is a clear obstacle that poses a potential challenge to the show&#39;s overall success.


 Amazon&#39;s Fourth Wing TV Show Would Adapt An Incomplete Book Series 
          

The main concern surrounding the TV adaptation of the fantasy book Fourth Wing lies in the fact that the book series is currently incomplete. The initial book was released in May 2023, followed by the surprisingly quick turnaround of the sequel Iron Flame in November 2023. However, the sequel encountered numerous issues, including misprints such as missing pages, upside-down printings, and spines that were labeled incorrectly. The rushed production also led to criticism in reviews, some noting that parts of the dialogue, particularly with the protagonist Violet, seemed juvenile, and the narrative could have benefited from more thorough editing.




In an interview with Variety Magazine, Yarros said, &#34;Weâ€™re slowing down a tiny bit, not every six months,&#34; about the third book in the series. Given the negative response to the hurried release of the second book, there is a concern that the pace of Yarros&#39;s upcoming books in the series, especially considering that it is not her only book series, may slow down significantly. As the TV show is in development and Yarros acknowledges the need to slow down, there is a potential risk of the show surpassing the books. This could detrimentally impact the plot, characters, and ultimately, the success of the Fourth Wing TV adaptation.



 Tackling Incomplete Fantasy Series Has Hurt Other Book Adaptations 
          

The Amazon adaptation of Fourth Wing faces a critical challenge with the lack of a completed book series, risking the scenario where the show surpasses the source material. Without the blueprint provided by the books, the show&#39;s writers may deviate significantly from the author&#39;s intended direction for the plot and character development. A notable example of this is the television series Game of Thrones, which is slated to be a seven-book series. When the show concluded its fifth season, it ran out of source material, resulting in criticism for rushed storytelling and undeveloped plotlines throughout the ending of Game of Thrones.






At the time of writing this article, Game of Thrones can be streamed on Max.




Completing a fantasy series, particularly one with an expansive world and a substantial audience, can be challenging for authors due to the weighty expectations associated with the final books. Instances of delays in the release of fantasy series include The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss, The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson, and, of course, A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. To prevent the Fourth Wing series from facing a fate similar to Game of Thrones, Yarros must complete her five-book fantasy series before the Amazon adaptation can surpass it, to ensure a faithful and well-executed adaptation.
