 10  The Library Is Open 
        

RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race would not be the same without this iconic line, signaling to the competitors that the reading challenge is about to begin. This catchphrase has been used by just about everyone when they need to trade shady insults back and forth is needed.
Popularized in the legendary documentary Paris Is Burning, reading is a fundamental skill that a drag queen must possess. &#34;The library is open&#34; appears in every season of the show and allows the viewers to delight in the drag queens&#39; skill (or lack thereof in some cases) at reading their fellow competitors.





 9  Good God, Girl, Get A Grip 
        

From the moment Latrice Royale stepped into the Werk Room, fans knew they would be getting iconic moments that would change the competition forever. Most of season four&#39;s most memorable quotes come from this legendary queen. From &#34;Jesus is a biscuit&#34; to &#34;the shade of it all,&#34; Latrice Royale has become known for always saying exactly what is needed at the moment. &#34;Good God, girl, get a grip,&#34; or the &#34;5 Gs,&#34; as commonly called, reminds all queens who have stepped out of line and just need to reign it in.





 8  Sashay Away 
        

The two words no drag queen wants to hear, &#34;sashay away,&#34; are the final words said to the queen who has failed to lip-sync for their life. Since the very first episode, this catchphrase has been used alongside &#34;shantay, you stay&#34; to communicate to the bottom two contestants who gets to stay and compete the next week and who must leave the competition immediately.
RuPaul coined this phrase on the very first episode of RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race, eliminating Victoria &#34;Porkchop&#34; Parker and sending her packing. Since then, it has placed itself at the height of pop-culture vocabulary and has been used by many fans when needing to signal to someone to leave.





 7  Miss Vanjie... Miss Vanjie... Miss.... Vanjie! 
        

No one would&#39;ve guessed the first queen eliminated from season 10 would create one of the best and most iconic catchphrase of the entire series, but Vanessa Vanjie Mateo made drag history with these two simple words. This queen created this memorable moment by walking backward while saying &#34;Miss Vanjie&#34; three times in a row during her elimination.
RuPaul, the judges, and Vanjie&#39;s fellow season 10 queens found the moment so entertaining that they quoted her parting words throughout the rest of the season. Vanjie instantly became so iconic that RuPaul even brought her back to compete in season 11. This catchphrase birthed countless memes and quickly became one of the biggest catchphrases to come out of the show, even being quoted by celebrities such as Rihanna and Andrew Garfield.





 6  This Is Not RuPaul&#39;s Best Friend Race 
        

RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race: Untucked has spawned countless iconic phrases and moments, but none have quite captured the magic of Lashauwn Beyond in season four clapping back at Jiggly Caliente for critiquing their makeup. This catchphrase has taken on a life of its own, being referenced in various seasons and challenges and even holding a place in the intro to RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race: Untucked. While Lashauwn Beyond has yet to make another appearance on the show, she will always be remembered for providing one of the best quotes in the franchise&#39;s history.





 5  No T, No Shade 
        

Alyssa Edwards is one of the most quoted drag queens to ever appear on the show and is responsible for introducing the world to &#34;No T, no shade.&#34; Alyssa Edwards is no stranger to confrontation, so when she uttered this iconic catchphrase for the first time, audiences knew a shady comment was about to follow. This unforgettable catchphrase has evolved, with variations appearing in subsequent seasons. Perhaps the most famous extrapolation of &#34;no T, no shade&#34; is Jasmine Masters&#39; arguably even more iconic &#34;no T, no shade, no pink lemonade.&#34;





 4  Back Rolls? 
        

Yet another legendary quote from the fabulous Alyssa Edwards, this phrase was uttered in response to fellow competitor Jade Jolie commenting about Edward&#39;s body. Never one to let a moment get away, Edwards responded with unexpected shock and disbelief at the thought of herself having back rolls. This catchphrase has appeared repeatedly on the show and has become one of Alyssa Edward&#39;s most repeated quotes. From its first utterance, this quote has become a way to react to an unexpected insult, not referring only to back rolls.





 3  *tongue pop* 
        

While not the first drag queen, and definitely not the last, to do a tongue pop for emphasis, Alyssa Edwards is by far one of the best. Alyssa Edwards and tongue-popping have become so synonymous that she even taught a tongue-popping 101 course during her WOW Presents Plus show. The tongue pop has been used in drag race culture for a long time and has been used for various reasons, such as to emphasize a point or just for fun. Ever since being introduced, Drag Race fans have picked up on it, becoming a widely used effect in gay culture.





 2  Good Luck, And Don&#39;t F--- It Up 
        

&#34;Good luck, and don&#39;t f--- it up&#34; was coined by RuPaul, but many of the fellow judges and competitors have used it. Often used at the beginning of a lip sync or one of the challenges, the phrase aims to motivate the competitors to do their best while ensuring they know not to mess up, or it could mean elimination. It is one of the show&#39;s most popular and often quoted catchphrases simply because it has many practical uses. It has been featured on T-shirts, mugs, and many other products, and it has become an often-used way to wish friends good luck on whatever their endeavor may be.





 1  If You Can&#39;t Love Yourself, How In The Hell Are You Going to Love Somebody Else? 
        

RuPaul says this at the end of every episode to wrap up the events and leave the queens with a positive message. RuPaul has always said that she wants to create a positive and accepting environment for her queens and the viewers at home, and the catchphrase is one of the many ways she does it.
RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race can be a stressful experience for some queens, so RuPaul always likes to remind them to love themselves no matter what happens. Many fans and contestants have used this phrase as a motto in their everyday life, and it has managed to break through into mainstream culture and language. The phrase has become a part of everyday language and culture that most people don&#39;t even know its origin.
