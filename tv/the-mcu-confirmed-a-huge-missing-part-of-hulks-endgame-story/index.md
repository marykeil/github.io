## SUMMARY 



  What If...? season 2 confirmed that Tony Stark had been experimenting on Bruce Banner&#39;s blood, potentially hoping to cure the Hulk.   Bruce Banner&#39;s transformation into Smart Hulk in Avengers: Endgame was perhaps influenced by Tony Stark&#39;s attempts to find balance.

## Literature Review
Marvel Studios still hasn&#39;t explored a major part of Bruce Banner&#39;s story as the MCU&#39;s Hulk, but What If...? season 2 may have revealed new details.




A huge piece of Bruce Banner&#39;s story as Smart Hulk in the MCU still hasn&#39;t been explored, but What If...? season 2 might have revealed some new information about his hidden transformation. Mark Ruffalo has portrayed super-scientist Bruce Banner since 2012&#39;s The Avengers, and has perhaps seen more changes than any other major superhero in the MCU&#39;s history. Edward Norton&#39;s previous iteration of the Hulk in 2008&#39;s The Incredible Hulk proved the creature to be uncontrollable, but the savage Hulk has since become an intelligent, controlled and balanced member of the Avengers known as Smart Hulk. This transformation took place entirely off-screen prior to the events of 2019&#39;s Avengers: Endgame.




During Bruce Banner&#39;s debut in the MCU&#39;s Phase 1, the gamma-irradiated genius was hellbent on finding a &#34;cure&#34; for his Hulk infliction. This hunt brought him into contact with Mr. Blue, a.k.a. Dr. Samuel Sterns, Tim Blake Nelson&#39;s scientist who is returning as the Leader in Captain America: Brave New World. After learning that the Hulk couldn&#39;t be cured, Banner instead focused on taming the beast, which proved vital to the Avengers&#39; success during the Battle of New York and the Battle of Sokovia. Now, however, Marvel Studios may have hinted at this hunt for a cure being a continued quest for Bruce Banner and other members of the Avengers.

                  How Hulk Was Created In The MCU - Origin, Powers &amp; Comic Book Changes   Hulk&#39;s MCU origin has been told through dialog and flashbacks that detail Bruce Banner&#39;s backstory and highlight its differences to the comic books.    


 What If...? Season 2 Revealed Iron Man Tried To Cure Hulk... And Failed 
         




Marvel Studios explored the Holidays during What If...? season 2, episode 3, &#34;What If... Happy Hogan Saved Christmas?&#34; During the Christmas-themed episode, it was revealed that Tony Stark had been keeping a vial of Bruce Banner&#39;s gamma-irradiated blood safe in the Avengers Tower, and had been running tests on the blood in an effort to ease Banner&#39;s transformations. Stark&#39;s experiments on Banner&#39;s blood had already happened prior to the divergence point of What If...? season 2, episode 3, meaning these tests likely happened in the MCU&#39;s live-action continuity, too. Banner&#39;s blood played a key role in the series&#39; Holiday episode, as Happy Hogan used it to transform into the Freak.

Indeed, both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark knew that there was no clear-cut cure for the Hulk, but Stark still worked on Banner&#39;s blood to help his anger. If Banner could control his anger more naturally, the Hulk would be triggered far less, perhaps allowing the scientist to live a normal life. These experiments were perhaps hinted to work, as Bruce Banner neglected to transform into the Hulk during What If...? season 2, episode 3, even when all his fellow Avengers had been put in danger by Justin Hammer and his goons. These tests also inform a major piece of Bruce Banner&#39;s live-action MCU journey, particularly him becoming Smart Hulk.






 Iron Man&#39;s Hulk Experiments Explain Banner&#39;s Smart Hulk Decision 
          

Bruce Banner and the Hulk&#39;s tumultuous relationship had always prompted the former to search for a cure, but Avengers: Endgame revealed that he had instead embraced his Hulk persona, allowing the pair to operate together as Smart Hulk. This transformation was suggested to be in response to the Hulk&#39;s impotence in Infinity War, but actually makes more sense as a result of Tony Stark&#39;s experiments in search of balance. Stark and Banner had worked together in their secret Mexico laboratory to combine the brains and the brawn, perhaps ending years of experiments on Banner&#39;s blood that What If...? season 2 has now confirmed were taking place.
