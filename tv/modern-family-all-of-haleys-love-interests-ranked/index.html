  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Haley Dunphy of Modern Family has had quite a few love interests, from boyfriends to flings. Here&rsquo;s every single one, ranked.</p>
<p>Played by Sarah Hyland, Modern Family&rsquo;s Haley Dunphy has gone through some substantial changes over the years, and there have been 10 characters that have become members of the Haley Dunphy boyfriend club on the way to those changes. She started out as an oblivious teenager who cared only about fashion, her social life, and being pretty. However, over time, she became a more independent woman who carved out a career for herself. Along the way, she&rsquo;s dated some real keepers, as well as some who weren&rsquo;t worthy.
Watch on Hulu
Haley was known for playing the field and being popular. What she&rsquo;s not known for is always having the best judgment when it comes to guys. As she grew up in front of the mockumentary cameras, she learned about prioritizing happiness and love over appearance and bad-boy vibes. Her track record reflects that. Haley Dunphy&rsquo;s boyfriends were just as unique as she was. She didn&rsquo;t have a type, but her love interests helped to show how much she grew. Haley ended the series married, a mother, and a career woman, and these men helped her get there.</p>
<p>10 Best Modern Family Episodes, Ranked
ABC&rsquo;s Modern Family is one of the funniest American sitcoms in recent memory. Across its eleven seasons, these are some of the show&rsquo;s best episodes.</p>
<p>Kenny
Played by Jason Mantzoukas</p>
<p>Haley dates this older man just to get back at her dad — and it definitely gets Phil&rsquo;s attention. Kenny even gifts Phil with a pair of jeans that Phil claims feel like a diaper. According to a quote from Phil Dunphy, Kenny is a &ldquo;slimy, middle-aged jeans salesman.&rdquo; Fans could tell that this love interest wasn&rsquo;t serious, but her father didn&rsquo;t know that.
At the end of the episode, Phil can&rsquo;t take it anymore and goes running after Haley to stop her from making this huge mistake with Kenny. Turns out, she&rsquo;d already stopped herself and ended the relationship. Haley doesn&rsquo;t have a problem dating someone to prove a point, but doing that with Kenny is a sign of her immaturity at that point in the series. Her ending things with Kenny before Phil tries to convince her too, however, is also a sign that she was on her way to making mature decisions at that point as well.</p>
<p>Vincent
Never Seen On Camera</p>
<p>This ex-con is the only Haley Dunphy boyfriend mentioned by name but never shown on camera. Fans know he exists only because he&rsquo;s mentioned by Haley. According to Haley, she doesn&rsquo;t bring him into the house because she knows her parents would never approve of him. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast to her bringing people home she knows will get under her parents&rsquo; skin. Vincent also apparently works at a florist shop.
Haley mentions Vincent in season 6, but the relationship doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere after that. With Haley being so popular, it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for Haley to bring home every man she dated. There could have been other relationships that the audience never even heard about, but Vincent is just a flash in the pan. Without ever really getting to know him, he can&rsquo;t be ranked any higher.</p>
<p>Scott
Played by Adams Hagenbuch</p>
<p>Scott is an important Haley Dunphy boyfriend because he makes Haley realize that she wants someone else, and is sick of dating the &ldquo;bad boys.&rdquo; Scott is a turning point for Haley&rsquo;s character, who has more often than not been drawn to bad boys she can have fun with who she knows won&rsquo;t get along with her parents. Scott is the marker at which Haley realizes that dating doesn&rsquo;t just have to be about being rebellious and having fleeting fun, but can also be about building a life with someone.
In the episode, Haley is waiting for Scott to pick her up when she watches Andy and Phil film a video for Andy to send to his girlfriend. At first, she thinks it&rsquo;s stupid, but then she realizes that this is what caring guys do for their girlfriends. Haley and Scott had great chemistry but as she&rsquo;s about to get in his car, she has a realization. She tells him, &ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;d rather go on a date with someone who would go through a blizzard for me and only honks for the troops.&rdquo; She describes Andy.</p>
<p>Chase
Played by Robbie Amell</p>
<p>Chase seemed like a nice guy, but Haley needed more substance in the personality types of her partners. They could have been great together, but there were too many factors at play to make it happen. The main factor being Andy. In &rsquo; t? You&rsquo;ll Love It!&rsquo;, Haley and Chase go on what is supposed to be a double date with Andy and his girlfriend. However, Andy&rsquo;s girlfriend doesn&rsquo;t show up, which gives Haley and Andy time to realize that there are sparks between them.
Chase also appears in a pivotal moment in Haley&rsquo;s timeline: when she finally admits that she has feelings for Andy. At the end of the episode, Andy gets sent to the hospital, where Haley confesses her feelings for him because she thinks he&rsquo;s asleep. Chase is nice and fun, but he isn&rsquo;t who Haley wants, which is necessary for a relationship. Haley can&rsquo;t just date him as a placeholder.</p>
<p>Modern Family: 10 Things That Make No Sense About Haley
from party girl to career woman and mom-of-two, Haley went through quite a bit during Modern Family. And yet, some things still don&rsquo;t add up!</p>
<p>Ethan
Played by Matt Prokop</p>
<p>Fans met Ethan briefly in season three&rsquo;s &lsquo;Disneyland,&rsquo; when the family goes to Disneyland. Claire invites him because she wants him to distract Haley from Dylan and thinks he would be a good choice to move on with. In turn, Haley likes him and gives him a shot. The two have fun together while on the family vacation, but Ethan doesn&rsquo;t have staying power in the series. He doesn&rsquo;t make a big impression on anyone else.
Unfortunately for Ethan, Dylan shows up, and after bouncing back and forth between liking Ethan and going back to Dylan, Haley finally decides to go back to Dylan. Ethan could have been a good match for Haley because Claire approved of him but Haley has always wanted Dylan — even when their relationship didn&rsquo;t always make sense.</p>
<p>Rainer Shine
Played by Nathan Fillion</p>
<p>Rainer was a local weatherman that Phil desperately wanted to be friends with. This backfires when he realizes he has inadvertently set him up with Haley. However, he eventually accepts the relationship after realizing Rainer will still be his friend. While he was significantly older than Haley, Rainer was actually a decent match for her.
The two of them even have a lot in common, like devoting significant time to a hair routine. They&rsquo;re also both, however, used to being the center of attention, which might have caused them some trouble in the long run. In season eight&rsquo;s &lsquo;Five Minutes,&rsquo; Rainer proposes to Haley, and while she initially accepts, they both immediately have doubts about the future. She realizes that she wants different things out of life, and Rainer can&rsquo;t give them to her. Nevertheless, Rainer was one of the more likable characters.</p>
<p>Dr. Arvin Fennerman
Played by Chris Geere</p>
<p>Haley meets Arvin when she sneaks into Alex&rsquo;s class and ends up disrupting his science lesson. Afterward, he tells Haley he&rsquo;s not sure why, but he feels like he&rsquo;s going to marry her. Arvin could have provided for Haley in the future without worrying her parents that she&rsquo;ll end up living in some kind of commune as is teased in the show.
For many loyal viewers, the spark wasn&rsquo;t there though. That&rsquo;s made apparent when Haley still has feelings for her high school boyfriend Dylan. Arvin might have been intelligent and a nice guy, but the spark was actually between Alex and Arvin. Haley Dunphy had her pick of a lot of boyfriends on the series, so Haley dating Arvin when she knew Alex was interested was one of the lowest sister moments in the show. Alex didn&rsquo;t put herself out there in relationships nearly as often as her sister, so this particular relationship is ill-conceived.</p>
<p>Will
Played by Nick Ballard</p>
<p>Will is the total package. As a doctor, he checks all of Haley&rsquo;s boxes. He appears in season 6&rsquo;s &lsquo;Grill, Interrupted.&rsquo; In the episode, Will repeatedly sees Haley and Andy in compromising situations but thinks nothing of it because he&rsquo;s not the jealous type. He even asks Andy to help him write a card for Haley to express his feelings for her.
Will is one of the best Haley Dunphy boyfriends in the series. Nice, smart, and with a stable job, he could have been a great match for her. The only reason that they broke up was that Haley didn&rsquo;t want a committed relationship. She wanted a fling, and to have fun with someone, but the doctor wanted a more serious relationship. Haley wasn&rsquo;t ready for that just yet.</p>
<p>Modern Family: 10 Other People Haley Could Have Ended Up With Other Than Dylan
At the end of Modern Family, Haley and Dylan were together. But like Claire, fans can&rsquo;t help but think the Dunphy daughter could have done better.</p>
<p>Dylan Marshall
Played by Reid Ewing</p>
<p>Some might think Dylan should be the number one pick because he ends the show as the father of Haley&rsquo;s children and her husband, but he still wasn&rsquo;t always the best choice for Haley. Claire never liked him, and to the end of the series, has never actually fully accepted him. Phil, however, considers him one of his buds.
He and Haley were on and off again for the entire show. The two of them begin their relationship in high school as immature teenagers who rarely see eye-to-eye. Dylan and Haley didn&rsquo;t inspire or motivate each other, and they always felt lost but kept coming back to one another. Dylan did eventually mature and proved that he was dedicated to Haley. He&rsquo;s always been willing to go above and beyond for her, even if it didn&rsquo;t initially seem that way. He begins Haley&rsquo;s bad boy streak, but he also proves that bad boys can grow up into good men. And as it turned out, Haley wanted Dylan more than the others.</p>
<p>Andy Bailey
Played by Adam Devine</p>
<p>Andy is the fan-favorite among the Haley Dunphy boyfriends throughout the entire run of the show. As Jay and Gloria&rsquo;s nanny, Andy added that extra bit of optimism and fun to the Dunphy-Pritchett clan. In fact, many people were peeved when these two didn&rsquo;t last. At one point Haley even says that he&rsquo;s the first guy she&rsquo;s ever loved despite the relationships she&rsquo;s had before him.
They started out as two completely different people who couldn&rsquo;t stop bickering. Then, they fell for each other and realized they made each other better people. Andy made Haley realize that she deserved a nice guy who would care about her, while Haley made Andy realize that he deserved someone who appreciated him. Together, they were a great balance. In the end, they just didn&rsquo;t end up together as their lives took them in different directions. More accurately, Adam Devine&rsquo;s career path took him away from Modern Family, but fans will always love their time together.
Modern Family is also available to stream on Peacock or purchase on AppleTV+.</p>
