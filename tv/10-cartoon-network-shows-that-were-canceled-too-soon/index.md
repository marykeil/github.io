## Literature Review
From Green Lantern to Young Justice, there were lots of Cartoon Network animated series that were unfortunately canceled before their time.




Cartoon Network has produced some of the most iconic and beloved animated series of all time, but unfortunately, some of their shows were canceled way too soon. From low ratings to lack of merchandising sales, there are lots of reasons that incredible animated series were prematurely canceled before they had time to finish their ongoing narratives. While, luckily, some series have been revived and got a second chance at success, others had very short runs and have mostly been forgotten today.
There were Cartoon Network shows like Green Lantern: The Animated Series that, after just one season, were quickly canceled despite the fact that audiences and critics responded well to its complex storylines and mature themes. Another series, Whatever Happened to… Robot Jones?, was only produced in the first place due to a Cartoon Network competition and ended with a short run. Across more than 30 years, Cartoon Network has had plenty of incredible shows, but sadly, many were canceled before their time.









 








 10  Green Lantern: The Animated Series (2011 – 2013) 
Green Lantern: The Animated Series was canceled by Cartoon Network after one season
        

 Green Lantern: The Animated Series 

 Release Date   November 11, 2011    Cast   Josh Keaton , Kevin Michael Richardson , jason spisak , grey delisle    Main Genre   Action    Seasons   1    




The Green Lantern franchise has had difficulty finding success outside the original comics. An example was the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern box-office flop. That’s why it was such a disappointment that when an adaptation was made that featured mature storytelling, an understanding of the character’s lore, and resonated with both kids and adults, it was canceled after one season. Green Lantern: The Animated Series was a strong series that unfortunately was canceled for reasons that had nothing to do with its quality (via Comic Vine.) These included poor toy sales and the disappointing reception to the Reynolds film.





 9  Evil Con Carne (2001 – 2004) 
Evil Con Carne was canceled by Cartoon Network after three seasons
        

The story of crime lord Hector Con Carne, Evil Con Carne had its origins in Grim &amp; Evil, a segmented show that also led to The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy. Billy &amp; Mandy ran for an impressive six seasons as well as several TV movies, while Evil Con Carne had just three seasons and felt like it was overshadowed by its more popular spin-off. Evil Con Carne was about an aspiring dictator, obsessed with taking over the world, whose disembodied brain was transported onto the head of a dim-witted circus bear. With a mix of dark humor and over-the-top slapstick, Evil Con Carne had a unique voice that expertly parodied representations of supervillains.





 8  Whatever Happened To… Robot Jones? (2002 – 2003) 
Whatever Happened to… Robot Jones? was canceled by Cartoon Network after two seaosns
        

Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? was a clever cartoon about Robot Jones, a teenage robot attending high school that boasted an unusual mix of futurism with a 1980s aesthetic. Sadly, Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, which was commissioned as part of a Cartoon Network phone-in competition to give unaired pilots full seasons, had just 13 episodes and did not have time to properly develop as a show. In the show, Robot Jones was sent to high school to gather information on humans and had to traverse the difficulties of schooldays, making friends, and fostering relationships. An interesting and heartfelt show, Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones? was canceled before its time.





 7  Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi (2004 – 2006) 
Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi was canceled by Cartoon Network after three seasons
        

As a fictionalized series focusing on the real-life Japanese pop-rock group Puffy Ami Yumi, Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi was one of the strangest shows Cartoon Network ever produced. Running for just three seasons, it followed the adventures of the cheerful and optimistic Ami and the cynical and sarcastic Yumi, two best friends who travel the world playing music. An unusual mix of adventure and music, Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi told a story of friendship that was steeped in a Japanese anime aesthetic and an over-the-top bright vibrant color scheme. Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi was aimed at young viewers and failed to connect with a mainstream audience before being canceled.





 6  Class Of 3000 (2006 – 2008) 
Class of 3000 was canceled by Cartoon Network after two seasons
        

A fascinating music show, Class of 3000 was co-created by rapper and Outkast member André 3000 and was an experimental and original series that introduced its small audience to blues, hip-hop, rap, and jazz. André 3000 voiced music teacher Sunny Bridges, who quit his life as a famous musician and became a teacher at Westley School of Performing Arts, and inspired the kids in his class to solve their life problems through music. Featuring lots of original music by André 3000, Class of 3000 was canceled after just two seasons following the resignation of Cartoon Network&#39;s General Manager Jim Samples (via Andscape), which led to major changes at the channel.





 5  Samurai Jack (2001 – 2017) 
Samurai Jack was initially canceled by Cartoon Network after four seasons


 







 Samurai Jack 

 Release Date   August 10, 2001    Cast   Phil LaMarr , Mako    Genres   Animation    Seasons   5    




Samurai Jack was created by Genndy Tartakovsky and stands as the most compelling and mature show ever produced by Cartoon Netflix. As a tale of a samurai sent to the future on a quest to return home and defeat the evil demon Aku, Samurai Jack brought together themes about the art of the samurai, a futuristic dystopian aesthetic, and issues around despair, hope, and resilience. Samurai Jack ended after four seasons in 2004 before it resolved its central storyline and plans to finish the narrative with a film were in limbo for years. Eventually, Samurai Jack did return, and the show concluded with a fifth revival series in 2017.





 4  Time Squad (2001 – 2003) 
Time Squad was canceled by Cartoon Network after two seasons
        

Time Squad was about a police force who travel through time and correct historical mistakes. The series was set in 100,000,000 AD and featured a trio of disastrous time cops: The orphaned 21st-century boy Otto Osworth, the immature brute Buck Tuddrussel, and the robot Larry 3000. Throughout their work, the trio meets with historical figures like Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln, and Sigmund Freud, who have fallen off course in the planned story of history and must be put back on track. Time Squad was canceled after just two seasons and the show’s ability to teach kids history while remaining clever, engaging, and funny was unable to meets its true potential.





 3  Cow And Chicken (1997 – 1999) 
Cow and Chicken was canceled by Cartoon Network after four seasons
        

 Cow and Chicken 

 Release Date   July 15, 1997    Cast   Charlie Adler , Candi Milo , Dee Bradley Baker , Dan Castellaneta , Howard Morris    Seasons   4    Creator(s)   David Feiss    




Cow and Chicken was an offbeat show that featured humor that went over a lot of kids’ heads. Following talking animal siblings, Cow and Chicken, their human parents whose top halves are never seen, and the devil-like character known as the Red Guy, the world of Cow and Chicken was eccentric, grotesque, and hilarious. Cow and Chicken was a prominent show for Cartoon Network when it was released, and it is hard to believe it ran for just two years. Some episodes of Cow and Chicken garnered their fair share of controversy, and the more adult-orientated nature of the show means it could never be made for kids today.





 2  Thundercats (2011 – 2012) 
Thundercats was canceled by Cartoon Network after one season


 







Cartoon Network’s reboot of the original 1980s Thundercats was an epic anime-inspired show that added depth and complexity to its already established characters. As a moody and mature reimagining of the Thundercats it was a huge success that made a lot of smart changes to the original show. Thundercats was originally planned for two seasons, but following the end of the first season in 2012 was not renewed by Cartoon Network. Thundercats was then put on hiatus before the creators confirmed in 2013 that it was officially canceled before its time (via MTV.)





 1  Young Justice (2010 – 2022) 
Young Justice was canceled by Cartoon Network after two seasons


 







 Young Justice 

 Release Date   November 26, 2010    Cast   Jesse McCartney , Khary Payton , jason spisak , Nolan North , Danica McKellar , Stephanie Lemelin    Genres   Animation , Action , Adventure , Superhero    Seasons   4    




Young Justice focused on teenage versions of DC superheroes like Robin, Kid Flash, Aqualad, and Superboy, featured a mature and complex storyline, and was a DC animated TV that could be enjoyable by adults and kids. Young Justice was prematurely canceled by Cartoon Network after just two seasons but was thankfully revived by the DC Universe streaming platform for season 3, subtitled Outsiders, and season 4 by HBO, subtitled Phantoms. The last two seasons have some of the darkest storylines in DC animation and they were not restricted to the TV-PG rating of its Cartoon Network run.
