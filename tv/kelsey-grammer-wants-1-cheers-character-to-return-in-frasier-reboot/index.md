# Kelsey Grammer Wants 1 Cheers Character To Return In Frasier Reboot


## SUMMARY 



  Kelsey Grammer wants Diane to return in the Frasier reboot to resolve their past relationship.   Bringing back Diane would allow Frasier to put their history behind them and end on a positive note.   Other Cheers characters could be more compelling to bring back in the Frasier revival than Diane.

## Literature Review
Kelsey Grammer makes an argument as to why Shelley Long&#39;s Diane Chambers needs to return in the Boston-set Frasier reboot on Paramount&#43;.




Kelsey Grammer insists that Shelley Long&#39;s Diane needs to return in the Frasier reboot. The first 10 episodes of Frasier Crane&#39;s third and final act in Boston wrapped up in December with a holiday-themed Frasier season 1 finale. Despite the supposed viewership, Paramount&#43; has yet to renew the Frasier reboot for a second season, although that hasn&#39;t stopped Grammer from coming up with potential plot lines for his character&#39;s planned small-screen return.




Speaking with Kelly Clarkson on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Grammer says that he “would like to see Diane come back&#34; in an upcoming episode of the Frasier reboot.


 

Played by Shelley Long, the Cheers actor was the reason for Grammer&#39;s introduction to the iconic sitcom. Explaining his desire to see his old TV girlfriend back, Grammer says that he wants Frasier to be able to “put something to bed” with Diane so that they “end up with a nice thing between them.” Read his full quote below:


When I first got the role, the key to Frasier for me was that he loved her with his whole heart, that he loved with all of his being. And that actually defined who he is. He’s been that way ever since. He just goes in wholeheartedly with everything — and that’s what makes him funny.






 The Frasier Reboot Doesn’t Need A Diane Appearance 
          

Grammer&#39;s Frasier was introduced in Cheers because of his short-lived romantic relationship with Diane. They met while she was at a mental institution on the heels of her heartbreaking split with Sam. By the time she returned to the bar in season 3, she was already in a relationship with Frasier. The pair continued to see each other and even got engaged, but Diane ultimately left him at the altar after realizing that she was still in love with Sam.

While bringing back familiar faces to the revival is a great way to lean into nostalgia, there&#39;s no need for Diane to reunite with Frasier. Anything that needed to be done to put their history behind them was also done when she visited Seattle. As one of the first Cheers characters to appear in the original Frasier, the opportunity allowed the pair to revisit their ill-fated romance and deal with the long-gestating issues of how their affair ended. The spinoff even staged the Cheers bar as the backdrop of their farewells, making it arguably one of the best moments of the series concerning its parent series.




                  Frasier Reboot’s Refusal To Return To Cheers Hurts Its Most Important Story (Will Season 2 Fix It?)   The Frasier reboot refuses to revisit Cheers despite being set in Boston, effectively disregarding an important piece of the character&#39;s history.     

Unless Grammer believes that Frasier is still hung up on Diane, then there&#39;s no justified reason for their reunion other than for them to cross paths again. His issues with her should have already been long addressed, otherwise, it would look like he moved on with other women in the hopes of masking his trauma over his split with her. At this point, there could be better Cheers characters to bring back in the Frasier revival than Diane.
