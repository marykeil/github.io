## Literature Review

Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 introduced the new characters and established a strong link to the parent series, Julian Fellowes&#39; Belgravia.




Warning! SPOILERS about Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 ahead.
MGM&#43;’s Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 perfectly set up the characters making waves in London’s society 30 years after the events of ITV’s Belgravia. Following the grandsons of James Trenchard, Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 simultaneously establishes a strong connection to the 2020 miniseries by Julian Fellowes, Belgravia, on which Belgravia: The Next Chapter is based, and introduces new characters still facing the consequences of the Trenchards’ secrets decades later. Belgravia central characters like Susan and Oliver nonetheless manage to appear in Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 through flashbacks, instrumental to grasp the consequences of their mistakes.
Belgravia: The Next Chapter can become the period drama to watch awaiting The Gilded Age season 3 with the two shows having only ten years and roughly 3500 miles difference in setting. Although Fellowes’ original Belgravia failed to attract sympathy towards its cruel protagonists, Belgravia: The Next Chapter can differ, especially considering the deeply affecting consequences its protagonists have to live with because of their parents’ actions in Belgravia. Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 proved exemplary as a series premiere by creating a direct link between Belgravia’s darkest secrets and the sequel’s protagonists whose lives are impacted by them.









 








 Frederick Is The Product Of Belgravia&#39;s Susan Trenchard &amp; John Bellasis&#39; Affair 
Being the product of unfaithfulness unknowingly impacted Frederick&#39;s early life
        

Although entirely unaware of the reason behind Oliver’s mistreatment of him, Frederick is soon revealed as the firstborn of Susan and Oliver Trenchard in Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1. However, the understanding Susan and Oliver had in Belgravia’s ending about keeping the secret of Frederick’s true parentage reveals him as conceived by Susan and John Bellasis during their brief affair. While Oliver seemingly agreed to care for Susan and John’s offspring as long as he and Susan kept it secret from everyone, Belgravia: The Next Chapter revealed he didn’t truly feel that agreeable in how he dealt with Frederick.





 Oliver &amp; Susan Trenchard&#39;s Secret Didn&#39;t Make Frederick&#39;s Childhood Happy 
Oliver always reminded Frederick of his differences
        

Oliver and Susan were married for a decade without producing a Trenchard heir, and she only became with child once she started her affair with John Bellasis. Belgravia showed the pregnancy as a big point of contention between Oliver and Susan, as Oliver wanted his progeny and not just a child to care for in whose upbringing he was involved. Oliver and Susan’s decision to keep their firstborn’s parentage secret seemingly made Oliver happy, but Frederick’s few flashbacks in Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 told a very different story.
            
 
 How The Gilded Age Can Become The Next Downton Abbey 
The Gilded Age, premiering on HBO, must follow Downton Abbey’s lead rather than repeating the mistakes of Belgravia, Julian Fellowes&#39; last show.



From bouts of violence during playtime that seemingly aimed to scare Frederick to indoor meetings where Oliver berated his firstborn repeating that he had a “rotten core” and a “bad soul” that made him forever unlovable, Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 made it clear that Frederick’s childhood was rife with emotional violence. This became even clearer once Susan and Oliver had a second child in James, as Oliver’s behavior with his second son was humane compared to how he treated Frederick. With Frederick unaware of his true parentage, he never knew why Oliver despised him so, despite loving James.





 James Being Frederick&#39;s Brother Upends Susan &amp; Oliver&#39;s Hopeful Promise In Belgravia 
James&#39; legitimacy showed how different Oliver&#39;s treatment of him was compared to Frederick&#39;s
        

Belgravia: The Next Chapter introduced both Frederick and James Trenchard, but with them never interacting and James missing Frederick when bringing a present for his wedding, it’s clear that their relationship is nonexistent because of their different childhoods. Oliver and Susan’s pact to care for their firstborn while keeping his parentage a secret in Belgravia’s ending was hopeful because it finally had the two on the same side, but that promise was broken, as Frederick’s childhood was unhappy and full of disdain from what he viewed as his father Oliver, and seeing his behavior with James made it even worse.





 Oliver &amp; Susan&#39;s Character Flaws Risk Dooming Frederick &amp; Clara&#39;s Relationship 
He&#39;s unable to truly connect with Clara despite his wishes


 







The series premiere already showed Belgravia: The Next Chapter’s main characters Frederick and Clara having marital problems, stemming from their upbringing in different worlds and Frederick’s tendency to take everything seriously and not leave space for anyone’s mistakes. Frederick looked for a wife like Clara and a love match precisely to avoid the kind of household where he grew up, not caring about Clara’s lack of wealth because he wanted to foster love rather than whatever linked Oliver and Susan. However, his unhappy upbringing still influenced him in his adulthood.
Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 showed Clara’s willingness to discuss any problem arising with Frederick, as her family was open and full of love. However, Frederick’s reaction was the opposite, as not only he was burdened by his own expectations to be a good husband, but he also didn’t have any idea how to be one, as his past weighed on him and still affected him, and he refused to process it, even hiding the truth of his childhood to Clara. This made evident how Oliver and Susan’s past mistakes strained Frederick and could imperil his relationship with Clara.





 Davison &amp; Fletcher&#39;s Shared Past Hints At Their Future Friendship 
Davison&#39;s understanding &amp; their posts&#39; vicinity suggests they will be allies
        

Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 didn’t go into details about the horrific event that Miss Davison witnessed involving a teenager Mr. Fletcher, but her attempt to apologize because she was ashamed not to have intervened in his favor and her refusal to share his secret indicates their bond can grow. Considering how their positions as lady’s maid and valet respectively also make it impossible for them to avoid each other, their bond can likely flourish into a friendship, and their heart-to-heart hints even more at their allyship in the future.

The Gilded Age is the newest series from Julian Fellowes, and it shares a lot in common with many other costume dramas available to stream.








 Frederick&#39;s Business Interests Mark Yet Another Difference With His Father Oliver 
Oliver never wanted to work like his father James
        

One of Oliver’s biggest struggles in Belgravia was being involved in his father’s businesses, as he felt whatever he did, he disappointed him. Being born into London’s high society, he didn’t feel the need to prove himself as his father James did, and doing business highly stressed him. However, Oliver’s brutal behavior toward Frederick unwittingly made him more like his grandfather James, as Frederick felt like he always had something to prove after being deemed unlovable by who he saw as his own father. Frederick’s continuous search for new investments and new ways to progress marks another difference with Oliver.





 James &amp; Frederick&#39;s Strained Relationship Has More To Do With Oliver Than Them 
Oliver&#39;s unjust behavior towards them still drives a wedge between the brothers


 







Frederick going out of his way not to involve his brother James in his wedding despite him being a reverend and hiding behind a plinth as an immediate reaction after seeing James at his door hints at the problems with his brother stemming from Oliver’s treatment of him rather than direct issues with James. Indeed, their nonexistent relationship that evidently bothered James proved the two were never close, as Oliver openly favored James while Susan defended Frederick, doing so without showing him kindness and prompting him to repress his feelings, thus dividing the brothers from the beginning.





 Clara&#39;s Happy Past Easily Shows The Problem In Her Marriage With Frederick 
She can&#39;t even imagine what he went through &amp; he isn&#39;t open enough to trust her
        

Frederick and Clara’s centrality will unlikely doom them as a couple, but Belgravia: The Next Chapter episode 1 clearly highlighted how their opposite upbringings made them approach their marriage in completely different ways. Clara’s happy childhood with a close-knit family made her unaware of the reasons Frederick might hide his problems, or why he refused to unburden himself by sharing them. While Belgravia: The Next Chapter will likely have Frederick and Clara repeatedly try to meet in the middle without success at first, it’s clear that their marital problems will not be solved unless they truly talk to each other.
New episodes of Belgravia: The Next Chapter air on Sundays on MGM&#43;.
