## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 left off on a cliffhanger, leaving viewers curious who the trio would choose to murder after their dramatic blowup argument.




The Traitors US season 2’s most recent episode saw a murder and a banishment, but who will be the next victim for the Traitors? While the Traitors had a successful episode after they were tasked with killing in plain sight, taking out Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu in a shocking long-drawn-out murder, things were tense when they reconvened at the Traitors turret. Dan Gheesling and Parvati Shallow, two of the strategy gameplayers who have taken on the role of Traitor during The Traitors US season 2, were close to turning on their fellow teammate Phaedra Parks, of Married To Medicine and RHOA fame. While they were still working together, the group wasn’t united.
While the heat came off Dan from the episode prior, things were beginning to turn on some of the other members of the group. When Larsa Pippen, who was still convinced a strong man was the backbone of the Traitors, decided that she wanted to set her sights on Chris “C.T.” Tamburello of The Challenge, many of her fellow Faithful weren’t following along. Instead, they chose to turn on Larsa, banishing another Faithful. With several options on the table for the Traitors next victim, it’s anyone’s guess who will make it on to The Traitors US season 2 episode 5.
            
 
 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now 
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?












 








 14  Dan Gheesling 
Traitor


 







Dan is a Traitor so he can’t be murdered by his fellow players, but he’s the most likely of the Traitors trio to go out first. Dan’s time on The Traitors US has been fascinating, as he’s one of the most strategic players in the reality TV world and entered the game with a massive target on his back. Dan’s time on Big Brother should have prepared him for the onslaught of personalities he’d encounter on The Traitors US, but his time in the game so far has been unlike anything he’s ever experienced on reality TV, especially considering he took a decade-long break between shows.





 13  Parvati Shallow 
Traitor
        

As a fellow Traitor, Parvati can’t be murdered either but is another likely candidate to be banished at the round table. Parvati is one of the most notable Survivor winners of all time, known for her cut-throat gameplay style. Unfortunately, her time on The Traitors US season 2 has been made somewhat difficult by the presence of her Survivor co-star Sandra Diaz-Twine, who’s joined her in the castle. Though Parvati has been sussed out by some of The Traitors US season 2 cast, her time on the series seems it could be something lasting.





 12  Phaedra Parks 
Traitor
        

Although she’s newer to strategy games on reality TV, Phaedra Parks is a veteran when it comes to the unscripted genre. As an original cast member of The Real Housewives Of Atlanta, Phaedra was able to hone her skills on reality TV before moving on to another Bravo series, Married To Medicine. Her skills on The Traitors US season 2 may not always be apparent, but it makes sense that she was chosen as a Traitor in the opening moments of the series. Phaedra can’t be murdered, though a banishment at a future round table is possible.





 11  Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen 
Faithful
        

After an exciting appearance on Love Island USA season 5, Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen became one of the more beloved fixtures of the reality TV franchise. His time on The Traitors US has proven that he’s not just open to finding love, he knows how to be a leader. Bergie’s one of the least likely people in The Traitors US season 2 to be murdered, as he’s someone the cast could look at as an unlikely Traitor in the future. While his temperament makes it clear he’s not a Traitor, he could be someone to take the heat if necessary later on.





 10  Shereé Whitfield 
Faithful
        

As a fixture on The Real Housewives Of Atlanta, Shereé Whitfield has proven herself as a reality TV legend outside of the competition show realm. While he’s trying her hand at The Traitors US season 2, it’s obvious that this is one of Shereé’s first times playing a strategy game. She’s been quiet throughout the season so far, which means there would be no reason for the Traitors to murder her. If she isn’t calling any of them out, it’s much easier to try and make her a target than to take her out without much of a reason.





 9  Kevin Kreider 
Faithful


 







Although Kevin Kreider, best known for his time on the Netflix reality TV series Bling Empire, has been somewhat dramatic during his time on The Traitors US season 2, he’s an unlikely victim for the Traitors to murder. Kevin has been putting himself in an interesting position. While some of The Traitors US season 2 cast members feel that he could be a Traitor, others are certain he’s not. This makes Kevin a great asset for the Traitors to keep around, as he’s someone who could easily get called out at the round table.





 8  Tamra Judge 
Faithful
        

Tamra Judge, who typically appears on The Real Housewives Of Orange County, may be one of the least likely players in the game to be a Traitor, the idea that she could be one of the more devious players in the game is exactly why it makes sense to keep her around. It’s unlikely that the Traitors will decide to eliminate her from the game just yet, though she could be eliminated in one of the upcoming murders. Tamra’s strengths lie in the fact that she’s outspoken about her opinions, so it’s only a matter of time before people begin to point the finger at her.





 7  Mercedes “MJ” Javid 
Faithful
        

After some time away from the spotlight, Shahs Of Sunset star Mercedes “MJ” Javid is one of the middle-of-the-road players who could potentially be murdered by the Traitors if they need someone largely unaffiliated with anyone else. While MJ has an alliance in the rest of her Bravo castmates, she’s not on an active show or in a specific franchise, so she’s more expendable to the alliance than some others. The Traitors would be smart to keep MJ around until her murder makes complete sense, though it’s unlikely she’d be banished from the game in the coming episodes.





 6  John Bercow 
Faithful


Although he’s outspoken, former UK Parliament member John Bercow is both an asset to the Traitors game and a potential detriment. John may be a good asset to the Traitors team in that he speaks up about his opinions and isn’t afraid to engage with people he may not be entirely familiar with. John’s been able to make connections with others in the game, though some aren’t of the highest caliber. While he’s great with the rest of the Faithful socially, he’s also open about what he feels are the weaknesses of his fellow players, making him somewhere in the middle in terms of who will get murdered.





 5  Peter Weber 
Faithful
        

As one of the Faithful who has already been accused of being a Traitor, The Bachelor star Peter Weber isn’t tremendously likely to get murdered by the Traitors, but the possibility is always on the table. Peter’s time on The Traitors US season 2 has been sparse so far, but he’s been working to strategize in order to keep himself safe along with Kevin. Peter’s a possibility when it comes to a person the Traitors would take out, but with some suspicion thrown on him, it’s unlikely they use him as someone to strike out so early in the game.





 4  Chris “C.T.” Tamburello 
Faithful
        

With over 20 years of experience on The Challenge under his belt, Chris “C.T” Tamburello is one of the most experienced players on The Traitors US when it comes to reality TV competition shows. C.T.’s abilities in the game may be the one thing that manage to save him, as he’s able to perform well in the physical missions which makes money for the prize pot. As his skills help the Traitors, C.T. is more likely to stay in the game; however, C.T. being a competition veteran makes him one of the most vulnerable for murder in the next episode.





 3  Sandra Diaz-Twine 
Faithful
        

With an incredible record during her several seasons on Survivor, Sandra Diaz-Twine is a huge threat to the Traitors. Though Sandra’s one-time ally, Parvati, has been clear that murdering Sandra could have some major blowback on her in the future, it’s clear that the gamer is simply too good to stay in the game. Sandra’s reads of players has been immaculate, and her time in The Traitors US house has made her look like a massive competitive threat in the game. While Sandra is great socially, the fact that she hasn’t been able to physically benefit the Traitors in missions makes it possible she could be the next Faithful murdered.





 2  Trishelle Cannatella 
Faithful
        

Although she’s been quiet throughout her time in the game, The Challenge’s Trishelle Cannatella is usually far more outspoken when it comes to her opinion. After the story she shared about RuPaul’s Drag Race star Peppermint made it clear that Trishelle wasn’t looking to play nice with her fellow Faithful. Peppermint found herself banished from the game, leaving Trishelle to pick up the pieces of calling out a Faithful with such certainty. Because of her affiliation with the reality TV side of things, it’s clear Trishelle could be one of the easiest victims for the Traitors to murder.





 1  Janelle Pierzina 
Faithful


 







While she’s affiliated with the rest of the reality TV personalities, specifically Dan, Janelle Pierzina could be the next person murdered on The Traitors US season 2. While Janelle’s track record is great, her close-knit relationship with the rest the reality TV competition players may be enough to take her out of the game. Janelle’s close relationship with Dan has kept her safe thus far in the game, along with her ability to win shields, but it’s possible that she could leave The Traitor US season 2 during the next murder.
