## Literature Review

Hazbin Hotel is a sublime animated series that knows exactly what it&#39;s going for, strengthened by an impressive voice cast and memorable songs.




Created by Vivienne Medrano, Hazbin Hotel is a lively adult animation with flair. The series — which sees Princess Charlie Morningstar (Erika Henningsen), the daughter of Lucifer and Lilith, attempt to rehabilitate Hell’s denizens for a shot at Heaven — boasts a plethora of musical numbers that are sure to entertain. Beyond just style, Hazbin Hotel has fascinating characters that really flesh out the world in which they exist. Crucially, the animated series knows exactly what it is, and its sense of humor, along with an excellent voice cast, align wonderfully with its chaotic energy.




              Hazbin Hotel  Hazbin Hotel centers on Lucifer&#39;s daughter, who opens a hotel for misfit demons she thinks can be redeemed in order to reduce Hell&#39;s overpopulation.  Pros Hazbin Hotel has great characters and a stellar voice cast The songs are catchy and go along with the story perfectly   Cons The story&#39;s themes of good and evil could be more nuanced    


 Hazbin Hotel’s Songs Are Extremely Catchy 

 

The series might be set in Hell, but it has no qualms about including upbeat musical numbers and a ballad or two to set the mood. The stakes are high throughout the first five episodes (which were provided for review), but Hazbin Hotel takes its time getting to know the characters through song. I found myself drawn further into the animated world because of the music, which initially caught me off guard but was a welcome addition to its storytelling.

What’s distinctive about Hazbin Hotel’s song choices is that they fit each character. Charlie Morningstar’s songs are high energy pop beats, while her girlfriend Vaggie’s (Stephanie Beatriz) numbers are a bit more morose. You never really know what you’re going to get, though, and certain musical choices will surprise you in the best way possible. The series’ songs could easily be found on Broadway, but unlike animations like Wish, Hazbin Hotel’s music is unique to the story it’s telling. One doesn’t work without the other, and it’s all the better for it. The song “Poison” is particularly addictive.



 Hazbin Hotel’s Characters Bring Levity To The Story 
But certain behaviors and themes lack nuance
         

The characters are engaging, and they feel like fully formed beings right out of the gate. Characters like Charlie and Angel Dust (Blake Roman), a porn star staying at the hotel, grow a lot during the first few episodes, but their lessons only add to their development. Had they been one-dimensional, it would have taken longer for them to evolve, hindering our engagement with them along their journeys. The central story is grim, especially as it involves Heaven’s forces killing those in Hell so openly, and the characters bring fun and charm to the forefront without sidestepping Charlie’s goals.




Alastor (Amir Talai), aka the “Radio Demon,” is a particularly intriguing character, mysterious and seemingly dangerous, yet protective and snarky. His return to Hell after seven years will have you questioning his every move. Hazbin Hotel’s take on Lucifer (Jeremy Jordan) is that of a sad man who only wants the best for his daughter; his introduction doesn’t play into expectations, despite suggestions to the contrary. His softness is a nice change from the way he’s usually portrayed, adding an element of hopelessness, which nicely contrasts Charlie’s demeanor and go-getter attitude.



The central story is grim, especially as it involves Heaven’s forces killing those in Hell so openly, and the characters bring fun and charm to the forefront without sidestepping Charlie’s goals.




The only downside is the characters can act extremely childish despite the series being an adult animation. Despite discussions about porn and the inclusion of crude humor and adult themes, some of the immaturity dims the attempts to tell a more nuanced story. What’s more, the characters have depth, but everyone in Hell is basically treated as though they’ve only ever been villainous. Sure, that’s the way Heaven sees them, but it would benefit the series if it took a more layered approach when it comes to moral standards.




All that said, Hazbin Hotel is a fabulous watch. It’s got good characters, an intriguing story, fantastic music, and style. It’s nicely paced and the worldbuilding is natural, with a strong start that establishes what kind of series this is and the journey of its characters. It’s an enjoyable watch that will leave you wanting more, and everyone from the writers to the animators and songwriters seemed to have great fun bringing the world of Hell and its characters to life.
