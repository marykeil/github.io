## Literature Review
Here&#39;s a breakdown of all the biggest reveals from the original Hugh Howey Silo books that unfold after the events of the Silo show&#39;s season 1 ending.




Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Silo series explained relatively little about its vast and complex dystopian drama, although once broken down and examined alongside the original books it&#39;s possible to fill in a few gaps ahead of the upcoming second season. Silo season 1 sets the stage for its dystopian drama by introducing the core concepts and themes in Hugh Howey&#39;s original Silo novels. While it takes a few creative liberties and even introduces some original concepts in its storyline, the Apple TV&#43; series stays true to most elements from Hugh Howey&#39;s Wool, the first book in the Silo trilogy.




Juliette nearly meets the same fate as Allison and Holston in Silo season 1&#39;s ending when Bernard makes her step out. Fortunately for her, Martha protects her by asking the Supply team to insulate her suit with good-quality heat tape. As Juliette stares into the vast expanse of the outside world&#39;s wasteland, Silo season 1&#39;s credits start rolling, leaving audiences curious about what could happen next. While the ambiguity is partly what makes the show so gripping, the Silo series explained and compared to the original books shows just how complex it actually is, and answers several questions.

 Juliette Enters A Neighboring Silo &amp; Finds Another Human Survivor 
There&#39;s Life Outside Of Silo18 In Hugh Howey&#39;s Story
          




After leaving Silo-18 in Hugh Howey&#39;s Wool, Juliette comes across another neighboring Silo. This Silo is not as heavily populated as Silo18 because its citizens dissolved their population through rebellion and conflict. However, Juliette still finds one survivor: a man named Solo, who lives in the Silo with a bunch of children. Using her experience working at Silo-18&#39;s Mechanical, she fixes a pump to dry out the lower levels of the new Silo and thinks of digging laterally to make her way back to Silo-18.

While Juliette finds a way to communicate with Lukas from her new Silo home, a rebellion breaks loose in Silo-18 after Juliette&#39;s cleaning incident. The citizens start realizing that previous cleaners were murdered by the Silo&#39;s authorities, who were using faulty tape on their suits. Enraged by this revelation, they plot an attack on IT. Unfortunately, Mechanical loses its first battle against the IT, but to continue their protest, they create steel barricades to restrict IT from entering their Silo region.

Lukas Has An Interest Arc Ahead In Silo
          

Bernard trains Lukas to be his new shadow but does not realize that Lukas is secretly communicating with Juliette. As Lukas trains to become the next IT head, he learns there are 50 silos. He even questions Bernard when he realizes that he could be responsible for killing Mayor Ruth. Considering how Bernard sends Lukas to the Mines towards the ending moments of Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Silo season 1, the show may drift away from these plot developments in Lukas&#39; arc. However, since Bernard eventually decides to send Lukas to clean in Wool, Lukas&#39; storyline in the show could have the conclusion it reaches in Hugh Howey&#39;s original Silo books.

                  Silo’s Tunnel System Explained &amp; What It Means For Season 2   With the conclusion of Silo season 1, a few mysteries were solved. However, the one involving the tunnel system is still in question for season 2.

Since Juliette stays connected with Silo-18&#39;s events, she learns about Bernard&#39;s plans to send Lukas out. She builds a new suit and heads to Silo-18 to rescue him. After assuring Solo and the children that she will return, Juliette goes to Silo-18 and tries saving Lukas by wrapping him in a heat blanket. To her surprise, the man she tries to save is Bernard, who dies by suicide after jumping into the airlock chambers&#39; cleansing fires. It turns out that before Juliette had made her way to Silo-18, Billings had already started a rebellion against Bernard, leaving the IT head in a helpless situation.

Following Bernard&#39;s death, the people of Silo-18 jointly agree to appoint Juliette as their new Mayor. Juliette, too, returns the favor by promising them she will lead with honesty. With this, the first book, Wool, in Hugh Howey&#39;s Silo trilogy ends and a new arc begins with the second book, Shift, in which the author introduces a whole new roster of characters.



 The Purpose Of The Silos Was To Save Humanity From Nuclear Blasts 
Nuclear Armageddon Created Silo&#39;s Dystopia
         

Hugh Howey&#39;s second book, Shift, in the Silo series, begins with a flashback from 2049 that reveals how a Congressman named Donald Keene had unknowingly built the Silos as a part of a project called CAD-FAC (Containment and Disposal Facility). Although Senator Paul Thurman initially told him that the CAD-FAC was meant for storing the world&#39;s nuclear waste in Fulton County, Georgia, the truth turns out to be far darker. A few years later in 2052, when a nuclear blast destroys Atlanta during the opening ceremony of the CAD-FAC, and the attendees of the ceremony seek refuge in the CAD-FAC, Thurman finally tells Keene that the nuclear blasts were pre-planned.




Much later in Hugh Howey&#39;s second Silo novel, Thurman and other leaders who pioneered the Silos justify their actions by revealing that nanotechnology use had become prevalent in the medical industry. However, terrorists were hacking into nano-machines and using them to spread global terrorism. Since the nanobots had already spread throughout the world and were putting everyone&#39;s health at risk, the leaders had no choice but to reset the world&#39;s population through nuclear explosions that would wipe out the nano-tech and allow humans to resettle on the planet after 500 years.

                  Silo: The Flamekeepers &amp; What Happened To Them Explained   Silo&#39;s episode 7 introduces the Flamekeepers and even suggests Juliette could be one - here&#39;s a breakdown of who they are and what happened to them.    



 People From Silo 1 Monitor Other Silos 
The First Silo Has A Sinister Purpose
          




Silo 1 accommodates the leading figures of all the Silos who work in shifts. While one monitors the other Silos for six months, the others remain in cryogenic sleep for decades. When Juliette survives her cleaning from Silo-18 in the year 2345, Silo 1&#39;s authorities set out to wake Thurman up to report the chaos that could ensue in the near future. However, they accidentally awaken Donald Keene, who learns that in 2550, only one Silo&#39;s citizens will be allowed to settle on the planet based on several variables determined through an algorithm.

In the final Hugh Howey book, Dust, Juliette discovers the truth about the world of Silo and its creators and threatens Donald Keene that she and Silo 18&#39;s citizens will come for him. In an attempt to save all Silos from their planned extermination, Keene and his sister, Charlotte, who he illegally awakens, try to understand how survivors can sustain themselves in the outside world. Charlotte even uses drones to explore the wasteland of the outside world.






 Silo-18 Gets Exterminated, Killing Several Citizens 
The Future Is Bleak For The Residents Of Silo-18
         

Juliette plans to dig laterally from Silo-18 to Silo-17, while Solo and other survivors of Silo-17 wait for her. Unfortunately, Thurman wakes up during this movement and releases toxic gases into Silo-18. As a result, only 200 citizens from Silo-18 make it out alive, while pivotal figures like Lukas die during the process. After getting brutally beaten and imprisoned for his conscientious objection to Silo&#39;s regulations, Keene takes it upon himself to destroy Silo-1 and encourages Charlotte to leave with a security officer named Darcy. Darcy, too, eventually puts his own life on the line to save Charlotte, leaving her as the only Silo-1 survivor.

                  5 Biggest Theories About What Happens In Silo Season 2   Silo season 2 has spawned several fan theories that explore hidden truths and a wider world beyond the confines of its subterranean society.    






 Juliette &amp; Other Survivors Go To The &#34;Seed&#34; 
The Bleak World Of Silo Includes A Glimmer Of Hope
          

In the meantime, Juliette finds a facility map that shows how the Silos have an underground tunneling machine that can lead them to a safe zone called the &#34;Seed.&#34; To their dismay, their Silo-17 machine does not have enough fuel to take them to the &#34;Seed,&#34; so they walk to the location instead. When they finally emerge from a screen of dust, they realize that their Silos were surrounded by artificial toxic dust that only sold them the idea of the outside world&#39;s toxicity. It turns out that, in reality, the outside world beyond those layers of toxic dust has already healed and is inhabitable for humans.

Towards the ending moments of the Hugh Howey Silo book trilogy, Juliette and the survivors reach &#34;Seed,&#34; where they find an abundance of materials required for their survival, including seeds that can help them rebuild civilization from the ground up. Charlotte, too, successfully reaches the safe zone and joins their pursuit of reconstructing society.






 Everything That&#39;s Been Revealed About The Next Silo Book 
Hugh Howey Has More Silo Novels Planned
          

In an AMA (via Reddit), a reader asked Hugh Howey if he plans to expand Silo&#39;s lore beyond the first three books. The author responded that he has a second trilogy &#34;planned and outlined,&#34; but he wishes to &#34;write them as a different person&#34; since their stories will not be the same as the first Silo trilogy. He also added that he has written the first few chapters of the next book and likes them so much that he doubts if he will ever change them. Whether Apple TV will adapt the subsequent trilogy will depend on Silo&#39;s overall success on the streaming platform, but with Silo season 2 coming, the prospect does sound exciting.
