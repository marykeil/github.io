## Literature Review
Daryl and Carol are reunited but running for their lives in a fan poster for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2, subtitled The Book of Carol.




A fan poster for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon shows the titular character reuniting with Carol with the pair running for their lives. Season 2 of the ongoing zombie spinoff will see Carol return to the universe, searching for Daryl as he continues his adventures in France. This will inevitably lead to the pair reuniting, though it&#39;s unclear how they&#39;ll find their way back to each other.




Now, bassel.galal has created a fan poster for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2, showing Carol and Daryl running for their lives from a herd of Walkers.


 

Daryl&#39;s motorcycle is also visible, last seen as Carol&#39;s new vehicle at the end of season 1. The duo is also on a broken bridge, a possible reference to Rick Grimes&#39; final episode in season 9 of the original show.


 When Will Daryl &amp; Carol Be Reunited In Daryl Dixon Season 2? 
          

Daryl Dixon season 1 ended with the reveal that Carol is searching for her fellow survivor, having traveled to Maine to bring him home. Season 2&#39;s trailer revealed her journey to find him will be a major focus in the upcoming episodes with the season even being subtitled The Book of Carol. Because of this, it appears much of the next season will be focused on how the two end up reuniting.




By the end of season 1, Daryl is still wrestling with the idea of staying in France, having built a life there with Isabelle and Laurent. While it seems he&#39;ll be sticking around for now, the looming danger of the Pouvoir means his home at the Nest may not last forever. If the group does get attacked in season 2, then it may motivate him to stay overseas and take revenge, despite the people who miss him in America.

                  The Walking Dead&#39;s Carol Return Is A Massive Risk For Daryl Dixon Season 2   The end of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon teased a return of the main franchise character Carol, but her return is a risky choice for the spinoff.    

While it&#39;s unclear when Daryl Dixon season 2 will show a Carol reunion, it&#39;s likely the two end up finding each other before the season comes to a close. This could allow for a more layered inner conflict for the show&#39;s protagonist, as he debates where his true home lies. His final decision doesn&#39;t seem like it will be clear until more of the series unfolds.






The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon - The Book of Carol will premiere on AMC and AMC&#43; in 2024.
