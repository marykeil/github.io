CBS confirmed The Amazing Race season 36 will premiere on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, at 9:30 p.m. ET. It will air a special 90-minute premiere after that evening&#39;s episode of Survivor season 46. However, the remaining episodes in the season will go back to the usual hour-long structure. This season was edited before season 35 was filmed, and consequentially, season 35 was chosen to air longer episodes as production hadn&#39;t yet been edited that season.
