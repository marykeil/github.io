## Literature Review
The Traitors US season 2 star Carsten &#34;Bergie&#34; Bergersen reveals the surprising events that led to his casting after he appeared on Love Island USA.




The Traitors US season 2 features Carsten &#34;Bergie&#34; Bergersen as one of the 21 celebrity contestants, and he now reveals the shocking way that he was cast on the show after his appearance on Love Island USA season 5. Bergie, a 24-year-old from South Dakota, who was a Dairy Queen manager before his Love Island USA stint, found love with Taylor Smith on the show. They&#39;re still together after meeting and falling in love in Fiji.




In an interview with Parade, Bergie revealed that he was cast on The Traitors US season 2 before he even left Fiji after Love Island USA. He explained, &#34;I didn&#39;t even have my phone back yet from doing Love Island. The last episode hadn&#39;t aired yet.&#34; Bergie went on to say that he immediately called his dad and told him that he&#39;d been cast on The Traitors. His father responded, &#34;&#39;No way. We were watching those episodes in between the Love Island episodes, and we absolutely loved it.&#39; So it was perfect, and I didn&#39;t have a job, so it was just like, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.&#34;

 Bergie Reveals If He Wants To Be Faithful Or Traitor 
          




Bergie also shared that the reason that he wanted to appear on Love Island USA was that he had the opportunity to go to Fiji. He explained, &#34;I&#39;m someone that grew up in a small town, never ventured really far out. So any opportunity to leave that area is something I want to explore. This is my second time leaving the country in like three weeks. So I&#39;m super grateful to be in Scotland.&#34; Bergie also revealed that, when he was cast on The Traitors USA season 2, &#34;I came in wanting to be a faithful, for sure.&#34;


 

At 24 years old, Bergie is the youngest member of The Traitors US season 2 cast. He also hasn&#39;t appeared on reality competition shows, such as Big Brother, Survivor, and The Challenge, like some of his fellow castmates, Janelle Pierzina, Dan Gheesling, Parvati Shallow, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanazio, Chris &#34;CT&#34; Tamburello, and Trishelle Canatella have. It&#39;s no wonder that he wanted to be faithful in the game. The faithfuls have to figure out who the traitors are, but they don&#39;t have to lie constantly and &#34;murder&#34; their fellow contestants. It&#39;ll be very interesting to see if Bergie can hold his own versus these reality television competitors, as well as stars from the Real Housewives franchise.




Bergie has been exploring new opportunities in life throughout the past year, and The Traitors US season 2 will be another exciting adventure for him. It&#39;s always interesting to see who can withstand the pressures of being a traitor when they&#39;re selected. Since Bergie went into the game wanting to be a faithful, being chosen as a traitor might throw him for a loop. However, he could also rise to the occasion, and carry out the murders easily with the other traitors. If he&#39;s a faithful, he&#39;ll have to pay close attention to his fellow contestants to figure out who the traitors are. Whatever happens, it&#39;ll be very intriguing to see how Bergie fares during The Traitors US season 2.

The first three episodes of The Traitors US season 2 will be available to stream on Peacock on January 12, 2024.
