## Literature Review
Sister Wives cast member Madison Brown Brush aka Maddie is letting her true feelings about father Kody Brown known in her New Year&#39;s Day 2024 update.




Madison &#34;Maddie&#34; Brown Brush, the second-oldest child of Sister Wives stars Kody Brown and Janelle Brown, threw major shade at her father in a new social media update. Maddie was born in 1995 and is the fourth child to Kody. Kody and Janelle had four more children after Madison. She was raised in Lehi, Utah, until she moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, with her family at 7 years old. Madison got engaged to Caleb Brush in September 2015 and married him in Montana in June 2016. Their wedding was a part of the Sister Wives episode “Maddie Gets Married.” Maddie has three kids with Caleb.




Maddie posed with baby Josephine Lee to look back at 2023 as the “year of growth” in a new Instagram post, but it seems to be a subtle shade at her father.


 

She added, “I learned more about myself than any other year though.” Maddie added captions on top of her photo, including one that read, “A reaction or a response is not always needed. Sometimes silence is best,” and “You will never get the approval or understanding from everyone, even those you love the most.” She mentioned that she’s let go of expectations that her past self put on her. “I closed chapters that needed to be closed long ago,” Maddie continued.

Maddie mentioned that she became more honest with what she wanted from herself and her family and what she needed, while also adding, “It’s ok to change your mind.” Reddit user Fuzzyblackelephant shared a screenshot of Maddie’s post and wrote that they thought Maddie’s New Year&#39;s post seems to be “all about finding peace,” and they couldn’t help but think it’s “significantly about her relationship with Kody.” Reddit user Jolly-Pickle-3550 wrote that the past year may have been particularly sad for Maddie since she had a good relationship with Kody, and they were “really close during her wedding.” Kody had even officiated the wedding.

The fan pointed out how Kody seemed to be obsessed with Axel as his “first grandchild,” and Maddie gave her daughter the middle name Kody. “But it seems like he just forgot about them. Hearing it was all an act must be soul-crushing. I’d hate him forever,” the Sister Wives viewer observed. Kody and Maddie’s relationship became strained during the COVID-19 pandemic when he decided that if she didn’t reach out to him, he wouldn’t bother reaching out to her. Kody seemingly stopped visiting Maddie and the kids.




According to Kody, Maddie stopped talking to him when he was breaking up with Christine Brown. Meanwhile, Janelle revealed that Maddie thinks she doesn’t know who Kody is anymore. She said there’s more to the story about Maddie not calling Kody. Maddie’s kids also play a role in her sudden avoidance of Kody. As per Janelle, Maddie has to consider the stability of what her children see or perceive as a grandfather.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
