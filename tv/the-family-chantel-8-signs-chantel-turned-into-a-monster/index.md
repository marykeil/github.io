## Literature Review
No one thinks that The Family Chantel season 5 star Chantel Everett&#39;s a villain, but maybe they&#39;re wrong. She&#39;s made some terrible decisions.




Following her divorce with Pedro Jimeno, The Family Chantel&#39;s Chantel Everett plays the victim, but there are always two sides, and some of her bad behavior is downright monstrous. In the new season, Chantel&#39;s really unraveling, showcasing darker aspects of her personality. While Pedro chose to bail out, he may feel like Chantel left him absolutely no choice. He gets roasted for being a villain, but what about her? Is she really so blameless? Maybe not.
Onscreen, in The Family Chantel season 5, Chantel may be going too far. Chantel&#39;s accusing Pedro of cheating, she&#39;s yelling and crying, and she isn&#39;t exactly stopping her family members from attacking the person that she once considered the love of her life. However, in her defense, Pedro&#39;s provoking her. This stuff he&#39;s doing is brutal, and his actions may be bringing out the beast in Chantel. His date with a Chantel lookalike seemed like a direct hit at his ex, especially because he said that his new love interest is:
&#34;a little bit more skinny, a little more tall.&#34;  










 








 8  Is Chantel Everett&#39;s Jealousy Poisoning Her Life? 
Chantel Everett Always Worried About Pedro &amp; Other Women


 







At this point, there isn&#39;t much that Chantel can do about Pedro and &#34;other&#34; women. Their marriage is over, but she&#39;s probably still feeling jealous. People like Chantel, who give everything to their partners, are often very hurt when their relationships end. However, they probably feel the happiest while things are working. Pedro&#39;s colder than Chantel, and he inflamed her jealousy many times. Even now, when it&#39;s all over, he seems to try and do that. Pedro&#39;s leaning into the &#34;bad guy&#34; role and bringing Chantel along for the ride. By constantly trying to get a rise out of his ex, he&#39;s taking Chantel to the dark side.
Pedro&#39;s been callous and his bad behavior may be rubbing off on Chantel. 

His date Nallely does resemble Chantel - Pedro was actually surprised by how similar they looked when he saw Nallely for the first time. Dating Chantel&#39;s &#34;twin&#34; is very provocative. Of course, it&#39;s going to get a reaction. However, that isn&#39;t all he&#39;s done. During one recent interview, when he was asked if he cheated on Chantel, the male reality TV show star basically admitted it with his body language, although he didn&#39;t say that he&#39;d been unfaithful.
Over the years, the one thing that&#39;s turned Chantel into a monster, more than anything else, is Pedro&#39;s dalliances. While she may have suspected him of cheating in the past, without really having any proof, his apparent admission that he had stepped out of the relationship showed that where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. Possibly, he really did cheat on her with his boss, Laura Delgado, and/or with Coraima Morla, his sister Nicole&#39;s &#34;bestie.&#34;
It may take some time before Chantel&#39;s able to fully detach. Right now, onscreen, her pain&#39;s very raw. Sometimes, when people are very emotional, they act out, and it doesn&#39;t come off well onscreen. That&#39;s a big part of why Chantel seems like a monster right now. However, what she&#39;s going through isn&#39;t easy - she&#39;s just being human. Nonetheless, she&#39;s showing more venom than she has in the past. When she paints Pedro as the villain, she implies that she&#39;s done nothing wrong, and relationships typically aren&#39;t that black and white.





 7  Pedro Jimeno&#39;s Ex Chantel Everett Can&#39;t Move On 
Will Chantel Everett Love Pedro Jimeno Forever?


 







While there was chatter about Chantel dating Drake, she appears to be single right now. Drake reportedly DM&#39;d Chantel after her split, just to see if she was okay, and she answered him. However, it doesn&#39;t seem like anything else happened. If she does have a partner right now, she&#39;s keeping her romance very quiet.
It&#39;s likely that she doesn&#39;t, as she&#39;d probably show off a new beau online. Why would she do that? Well, most likely, she&#39;d take that step to gain clout and make supervillain Pedro mad. While he might not get jealous, as he really appears to be over it, it&#39;s always possible that Pedro would feel bad if he saw her with someone else. At the moment, she doesn&#39;t post about her love life, if she has one. Chantel appears to be taking a break.
It&#39;s probable that this break will go on for a while. Chantel needs time to heal, but staying single makes her seem a little bitter. Her bitterness creeps out onscreen too. It might be good for her to try to find a new partner, if only to shed the &#34;scorned woman&#34; label. Chantel is carrying so much anger and pain. Her emotions are real and they&#39;re valid. However, her intense feelings make her seem like she&#39;s living in the past.





 6  Pedro Jimeno Accused Chantel Everett Of Stealing Money 
Pedro Jimeno Said Chantel Cleaned Out Their Joint Bank Account
        

Is Chantel a thief? Pedro says she is. During their divorce, things got very messy. They&#39;ve accused each other of terrible things, and Pedro&#39;s allegation&#39;s particularly concerning. If Chantel cleaned out their joint bank account as Pedro said, without his permission, she really crossed the line. The sums involved here aren&#39;t minor. Pedro said that Chantel took a whopping 265K from the account, as per People.
While there&#39;s no hard proof of this, if Chantel&#39;s guilty, she definitely lost herself during the divorce proceedings. This is common - people change rapidly during their divorces, as this type of formal breakup is known for bringing out the very worst in human beings. In fact, when a couple gets divorced, soon enough, both &#34;halves&#34; tend to feel like strangers to each other. This shift from partners to opponents can be so jarring. This is why divorces are often the most traumatic things that people go through in their lives, aside from grieving the deaths of loved ones or dealing with serious health issues.
Chantel may have decided to empty the bank account (again, this act is alleged) because she feared for her financial future. However, it wasn&#39;t her place to do that, as the money belonged to both of them. If she stooped to criminal conduct after they split up, it&#39;s a new low. Sadly, it&#39;s not the only criminal conduct Pedro accused her of.





 5  Pedro Jimeno Asked For A Restraining Order Against Chantel Everett 
The Family Chantel Stars Got Mutual Restraining Orders (Pedro Filed For Them)


 







Pedro wanted physical distance from Chantel after he filed for divorce, and went as far as to file for mutual restraining orders. That&#39;s a level of nastiness that no one could really have anticipated. The fact that Pedro filed first made it seem like Chantel was pressuring him and bothering him. It&#39;s possible that this could be true - however, only the two people involved really know everything that happened.
This drama unfolded in late summer of 2022. That&#39;s when Pedro filed for the restraining orders, signaling a dark turn in their post-split lives. When things get that bad, it&#39;s hardly ever &#34;amicable&#34; afterward. His filing exposed the seamy underbelly of their relationship. Yes, the initial divorce filing showed that there were unsolvable problems. However, that first filing didn&#39;t really dredge up a lot of dirt. The restraining order filing did.
Since Pedro filed to stay apart from Chantel as they moved through their divorce, she seemed like the aggressor in their arguments. Obviously, things got heated between them. While it might not be true that Chantel was the whole problem, something was clearly wrong. The legalese from the filing is harsh:
â€œrestrained from doing or attempting to do, or threatening to do, any act that injures, maltreats, vilifies, intimidates, molests or harasses the adverse party, restrained from selling, encumbering, trading, contracting to sell or otherwise disposing or removing from the jurisdiction of the court any property belonging to the parties except in the ordinary course of business, restrained from canceling or changing health, auto, or life insurance for the parties and restrained from disconnecting or having disconnected the home utilities, including but not limited to electricity, gas, water and telephone, 

Pedro wanted a clean break, and maybe Chantel didn&#39;t. At a certain point, a person going through a breakup has to face reality. The romance is really over. It&#39;s not going to magically be repaired. Chantel may have had trouble getting to that level of acceptance. She was very smitten with her partner while they were together. It&#39;s pretty clear that her love for Pedro was sincere in light of how hard it was for her to break away.
That&#39;s heartbreaking, but Chantel has to take responsibility for what she&#39;s done wrong. If she got in Pedro&#39;s face, that&#39;s her mistake. However, during this divorce, only Pedro&#39;s really been slapped with the villain label. Chantel&#39;s let him get dragged through the mud, and added to the general horror by flinging mud at him too. If she devolved during the process, she needs to be to held accountable.





 4  Chantel Everett&#39;s 1st Post-Separation Meeting With Pedro Jimeno Was Disastrous 
Chantel Said That Pedro &#34;Treated Me Bad And Evil&#34;


The drama hit a fever pitch during the new season, when Pedro and Chantel went head-to-head at a meeting where the division of their property was discussed. Dressed up in a pink pantsuit, Chantel looked like she was all business. However, her emotions were roiling right under the surface. Onscreen, she unloaded about the sins committed against her by Pedro, failing to acknowledge any wrongdoing of her own.
In the clip, Chantel went low while the cameras rolled, calling out his &#34;bad&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; actions towards her. It was a shocking moment. Pedro tried to stay calm, but must have been freaked out by her histrionics. Unfortunately, his Mr. Cool act, while probably necessary, seemed so callous. It clearly hurt his ex when he talked about their divorce being finalized. He said:
&#34;Thanks god&#34; 

When he uttered that ungrammatical statement, her eyes filled with tears. Of course, that doesn&#39;t make her a monster. It makes her relatable. However, continually putting Pedro down in front of the whole world, in what seems like an attempt to win in the court of public opinion, does make her look very bad.





 3  Chantel Everett Seems A Little Thirsty At Instagram 
Are Chantel Everett&#39;s Sexy Poses Covering Up Some Type Of Insecurity?


Chantel&#39;s more popular at Instagram than her ex, but some of her post-divorce pics show her posing sexily. There&#39;s nothing wrong with this, although it can come off as trying too hard. This is very forgivable as she&#39;s really been through the wringer. Ultimately, however, there is a problem - tinges of sadness are often visible in even her most provocative photos. Sometimes, she looks like she&#39;s going to cry. She seems desolate despite all the trappings of influencer and reality TV show fame, including designer clothes, good jewelry and professional hair and makeup.
Being sad doesn&#39;t make a person a villain. The issue is that she may be trying to appear happy when she&#39;s really not. Chantel&#39;s pain is her own business (if she&#39;s in emotional pain), but a more authentic Instagram identity might actually help her. Emotional honesty always shines through, and right now, she doesn&#39;t seem emotionally honest.





 2  Chantel Everett Lets Her Family Attack Pedro Jimeno 
Karen Everett&#39;s Selling Pedro Jimeno&#39;s Possessions
        

The Family Chantel&#39;s Karen Everett&#39;s never been Pedro&#39;s biggest fan, and now that all of her instincts were proved correct, she&#39;s really on the warpath. Chantel lets her mother unload on Pedro, never defending her former mate. While it&#39;s understandable that Chantel wants her family to go after Pedro, it&#39;s in poor taste. The divorce is between Chantel and Pedro, not Chantel and Karen, or Chantel and Thomas Everett (Chantel&#39;s father).
Nasty divorces are legion. This one definitely got very nasty, and Chantel needs to take responsibility for some of that. She did a lot to make things worse, including letting her parents tell Pedro off. Karen once accused Pedro of, &#34;harvesting the American dollar,&#34; and now, her hate is at an all-time high. Chantel should try to defuse that rather than egging them on.





 1  Chantel Everett May Want Pedro Jimeno Back 
Chantel Everett Still Seems To Love Pedro Jimeno
        

Chantel&#39;s seeming reluctance to move on, as well as her obvious heartbreak during The Family Chantel season 5, may mean that she&#39;s still in love with Pedro. What&#39;s negative about this is what it&#39;s doing to her. Rather than pining for a man who&#39;s checked out in every possible sense, she should be looking ahead. Sure, she&#39;s living her life. Chantel&#39;s a travel nurse and a powerful influencer. She&#39;s a reality star. However, this divorce seems like something she has trouble accepting.
When Chantel makes peace with what&#39;s happening, and becomes more philosophical about her problems with Pedro, she can really rebuild. Right now, she&#39;s still extremely emotional, and her feelings are driving so much of her erratic behavior. Sometimes, people behave horribly when they&#39;re feeling a lot. Their emotions make them seem unhinged.
Detachment is the key to getting over things. It&#39;s about acceptance and just staying positive. There&#39;s no reward for mooning over an ex who&#39;s long gone. The Family Chantel season 5 celeb Chantel may still have her &#34;down&#34; days, but soon enough, the sun will come out. Most people don&#39;t stay heartbroken forever. Time doesn&#39;t really heal all wounds, but it heals most of them.
