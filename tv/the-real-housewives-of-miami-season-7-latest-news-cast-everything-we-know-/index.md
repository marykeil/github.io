## Literature Review
The Real Housewives of Miami season 6 will be coming to an end soon, but season 7 isn&#39;t too far behind. Here are some updates on RHOM season 7. 




The Real Housewives of Miami season 6 will be coming to an end soon, which means there will be a lot of buzz surrounding season 7. The series initially began in 2011 on Bravo as one of the earlier shows from The Real Housewives franchise. However, after three seasons, the show was canceled. There was quite a lot of outrage among fans following its cancelation in 2013, and many thought they would never see the RHOM women on their screens again. After being away for eight years, RHOM was revived on Peacock with some old and new additions to the cast.




Since the return of RHOM in 2021, the series has been one of the most talked about shows from The Real Housewives franchise. The ladies not only give plenty of explosive drama, but even the friendships they&#39;ve cultivated on the show are enjoyable to watch. Not to mention, RHOM came back at the best time in the women&#39;s lives. Alexia Nepola was engaged and about to marry her now husband Todd Nepola, while Lisa Hochstein was clearly not in the best place with her now soon-to-be ex-husband Lenny Hochstein. Whether it&#39;s good or bad, the ladies of RHOM never shy away from giving the fans a good season.

 The Real Housewives Of Miami Season 7 Latest News 
         




So far, there isn&#39;t much news on RHOM season 7. Since RHOM season 6 is still airing, there probably won&#39;t be much news about the following season for a while. RHOM season 6 has been doing well in terms of fanfare, so there is a very high chance that season 7 will be happening. Since the reboot began two years ago, the show has only become more popular. Bravo even decided to have RHOM back on the network and have the episodes initially air there instead of Peacock. The cast is also an important part of the show, and they will likely all return.



 The Real Housewives Of Miami Season 7 Potential Release Window 
          

Since the show made its return in 2021, RHOM has been premiering at the end of the year. RHOM seasons 4 and 5 aired in December 2021, while season 6 aired on November 1, 2023. Judging by the past premiere dates, it&#39;s very likely that RHOM season 7 will premiere sometime at the end of 2024. RHOM season 6 is on track to finish in early March or even late February, depending on how many episodes the season decides to air. Last season, RHOM had 19 episodes, while the season before that had 14. This means RHOM season 6 is on track to finish just in time for season 7.






 The Real Housewives Of Miami Season 7 Potential Cast 
          

As for the cast of RHOM season 7, all the ladies will likely return. The cast, for the past three seasons, has included Alexia, Lisa, Larsa Pippen, Guerdy Abraira, Julia Lemigova, and Nicole Martin as full-time housewives. Former full-time RHOM cast members Adriana de Moura and Marysol Patton will likely return as friends, along with Kiki Barth.

There is no word on whether or not new cast members will join the show. The cast has stayed the same since RHOM was rebooted in 2021, so it&#39;s unlikely that Bravo will change the formula. However, former season 2 cast member Ana Quincoces did guest star in a RHOM season 6 episode, so it&#39;s possible she could return for season 7.



 When Will The Real Housewives Of Miami Season 7 Start Filming? 
          




RHOM season 7 will likely start filming in the springtime or early summer, shortly after filming their reunion. Since past seasons of the rebooted RHOM would end sometime in March, that means they would usually start filming in early April. Since RHOM season 6 started a month earlier than usual, season 7 will likely start filming in mid-March or early April, depending on how many episodes RHOM season 6 airs. Nonetheless, The Real Housewives of Miami season 7 will be a hit again once it returns to Bravo later this year.



The Real Housewives of Miami season 7 airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
