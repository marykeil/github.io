## SUMMARY

## Literature Review
Blake Shelton announced The Voice season 23 will be his last. Before his successor was announced, there were many options to consider.




Blake Shelton sadly left The Voice after season 23, but many artists were in the running to take his place. The country singer was a coach beginning with season 1 in 2011. However, after much consideration, he took a break after season 23. Kelly Clarkson also left the show along with Ariana Grande, and Gwen Stefani and Camila Cabello took their places. Unfortunately, Gwen and Camila were not a part of The Voice season 23, but Kelly returned with new coaches, Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan. So far, The Voice season 24 has brought many changes to the series.




It will take a lot of getting used to not having Blake on the competition series, as the country singer was the only original coach to remain on The Voice. As others were switched out regularly, Adam Levine and Blake remained in their chairs. However, season 16 marked Adam&#39;s last season, prompting Gwen Stefani to return for season 17. Season 24 will be Blake&#39;s turn to give someone else a seat on the coaches&#39; panel, and until Reba McEntire was chosen as Blake&#39;s replacement, other viable options were considered. Who could have taken Blake&#39;s place on The Voice?

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?    


 Kelsea Ballerini Had Great Experience On The Voice 
          




Kelsea Ballerini is a country music alum who would have been the perfect coach on The Voice. Kelsea joined the show as a fifth coach during the season 15 Comeback Stage when contestants who didn&#39;t make it past blind auditions returned for another chance. The country singer returned a season later to be a battle rounds advisor for Team Kelly before replacing Kelly during season 20 when the coach was out sick. She had enough experience on The Voice to join as a full-time coach but, unfortunately, wasn&#39;t chosen.



 Maren Morris Has A Lot To Offer The Voice Contestants 
         

Maren Morris is another successful country singer who would have been great on The Voice. Maren admitted that she was rejected from the show and many other competition shows like American Idol and America&#39;s Got Talent. She&#39;s a great example of how persistence leads to success. She also crossed over to pop music with her successful hit &#34;The Middle.&#34; Maren has strong morals, too, and while this doesn&#39;t pertain to talent, she&#39;s a good example of how contestants can use their platform to stand up for their beliefs. However, she wasn&#39;t chosen.






 Normani Knows How Competition Shows Like The Voice Operate 
          

Like coach Camila, Normani has experience in a singing competition series. She and Camila were on The X Factor together and were put into the girl group Fifth Harmony. The &#34;Motivation&#34; singer was also an advisor for Team Kelly during The Voice season 17. She would have been a great addition to the show with her knowledge of singing competitions and strong vocals.



 Cassadee Pope Could Have Made Her Return To The Voice 
          

Cassadee Pope succeeded in the pop-punk band Hey Monday before auditioning for The Voice season 3 as a solo artist. The contestant was offered a spot on all four judges&#39; teams but chose Team Blake, and the two performed together on the show. Cassadee won the season, and her expertise in the series would have benefitted new contestants. It would have also been a great way to honor Blake since Cassadee was on his team. Maybe she can return as a guest since Reba was given Blake&#39;s spot.




                  The Voice: Contestants Who Had The Most Successful Careers Post-Show   Although most The Voice stars failed to enter the music industry, some did build successful careers following their stints on the series.     



 Keith Urban Would Have Been Great On The US Version Of The Voice 
          

Keith Urban knows all about being a coach on The Voice, as he was on the Australian series for a few seasons. The country singer recently announced he&#39;d be leaving the show, which would have given him the perfect opportunity to join the American series. He&#39;s no stranger to the American series either, as he was a Team Blake advisor during season 15. He also has experience as an American Idol judge from seasons 12 through 15.

Blake is one of the most beloved coaches on the show. When choosing a replacement, it needed to be someone great. Hopefully, The Voice fans won&#39;t compare the new coach, Reba, to Blake and will embrace the style she brings to the show.






The Voice airs on Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.
