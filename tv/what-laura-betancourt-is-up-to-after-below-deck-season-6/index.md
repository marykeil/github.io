Laura Betancourt was the third stew on Below Deck season 6, and she has been keeping herself busy since leaving the show in 2019. Despite coming onto the show while the charter season was already underway, she made quite an impact with fans. From starting her own business to traveling the world, Laura lives her best life after Below Deck. As fans await Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to revisit Laura&#39;s time on the show.




Below Deck season 6 followed returning fan favorite like Captain Lee Rosbach and former chief stew Kate Chastain aboard the yacht, My Seanna. The season also included some new faces on the crew, including deckhand Rhylee Gerber and second stew Josiah Carter. Since Laura was very opinionated as soon as she joined the crew, she had some drama with her chief stew while aboard the vessel and even considered quitting during the charter season. However, towards the end of season 6, Laura and Kate were able to get along and now have a strong friendship.

Laura is also known for her boatmance with South African deckhand Ashton Pienaar on Below Deck season 6. They were not the first crewmates to start a relationship in the tight quarters of a yacht, as the show has had some legendary romances throughout its history. Relationships always lead to drama on the show, like Below Deck: Mediterranean season 2&#39;s love triangle with Malia White, Wes Walton, and Adam Glick, ending with Malia and Wes together. Laura and Ashton were popular as a couple, and despite leaving the show together, they were no longer dating by the season 6 reunion.
