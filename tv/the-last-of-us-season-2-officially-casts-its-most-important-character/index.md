Based on The Last of Us Part II, Abby will be involved in some pivotal proceedings (and some major spoilers) set to come in season 2. According to the character&#39;s official description offered by HBO, Abby is &#34;a skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved.&#34; It&#39;s an understatement to say she is the most important character introduced in The Last of Us season 2 and given Dever&#39;s stellar track record, she should continue garnering acclaim, and also upset audiences, if she portrays Abby effectively.

As Mazin and Druckmann&#39;s statement says, Dever is an acclaimed performer who should fit right in with the show&#39;s Emmy-nominated stars, Pascal and Ramsey. The actor is known for her roles in the TV shows Justified, Last Man Standing, Unbelievable, and Dopesick, the last of which earned her an Emmy nomination for her performance. Dever is also known for her leading roles in the films Booksmart, Rosaline, Next Goal Wins, and No One Will Save You. By securing the high-profile role as Abby in The Last of Us season 2, she is sure to explode in popularity.






The Last of Us season 1 is streaming on Max.
