## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Sophie Sierra looks different as she gets rid of her blonde wig to reveal her stunning brunette transformation.




90 Day Fiancé star Sophie Sierra revealed her stunning hair transformation after saying goodbye to her blonde tresses. Sophie is a 25-year-old from London, England. Sophie works as a fashion influencer and social media content creator and stars in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 with Rob Warne. She had seen his photo on a page about biracial men. She followed his page and they started chatting in their DMs. Sophie and Rob dated for two years before Sophie moved to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. They came from different economic backgrounds. She lived in mansions and now she&#39;s having to live in an apartment with no bathroom inside.




Her choice to get married to Rob has been slammed by fans and so has her hair. However, Sophie is not wearing her blonde wig anymore in 2023 as revealed by a video on TikTok (via Weezy-Jefferson on Reddit).


 

Sophie recorded herself lying down and mouthing the words, &#34;Imagine the day they see you again, and you are just, well, better.&#34; Sophie&#39;s hair was bleached blonde with messy dark roots showing at the start of the clip, but after a transition, the clip revealed how she looks now after undergoing a complete transformation. Sophie&#39;s hair now is long, lush, and dark brown.

 Why Did Sophie Sierra Wear A Wig On 90 Day Fiancé? 
          




Sophie looks much happier in the &#34;after&#34; look, and it&#39;s not just because of her new hair. The Redditor noted that Sophie&#39;s glow-up could also be a &#34;slight hint&#34; that she and Rob are no longer together. Other fans in the comments, such as Zodiac_he wrote, &#34;I hope she sticks with dark hair for a while—she looks gorg!!&#34; Brifiguy added, &#34;I think she looks much better with brown hair!&#34; While Sophie&#39;s personality and style have been earning praise since her debut, her hair was being severely criticized. She came under fire for supposedly wearing such a badly fitted wig during her talking head segments.

Sophie revealed the truth while doing a Q&amp;A session with her fans. One of her followers wanted to know when they would see Sophie with her natural hair on the show. Sophie said, &#34;Not until the end,&#34; possibly referring to the Tell-All, which she may have filmed recently. Rob and Sophie&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé season 10 segments are from over two years ago. Sophie wore a wig for an entire year because her hair was badly damaged, but it&#39;s healthy now. She admitted that wearing wigs was worth it while her natural hair recovered. Sophie has now grown her hair longer, although she does wear extensions.




Sophie&#39;s natural hair is curly. Fans saw a glimpse of it during her debut 90 Day Fiancé season 10 episode. She shared that she wears her hair curly sometimes and doesn&#39;t straighten it too often. Sophie thinks she looks different with her natural curls. Meanwhile, she is choosing to remain tight-lipped about her and Rob&#39;s latest relationship status. There are rumors that they have split, even though Sophie is still in the U.S. and living in Austin, where Rob is also living at the moment.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
