## Literature Review
Gotham has been worn many hates over the course of its life, and some seasons of the Batman origin story crime procedural are better than others.




As far as superhero television goes, Gotham was a surprisingly consistent show. Chronicling the history of pre-Batman Gotham city through the lense of a police procedural, the series slowly introduced some of Batman&#39;s most iconic villains, as well as some original creations, via a young James Gordon. Running for five seasons on Fox, Gotham ran the gamut of tone and format, going from a &#34;monster-of-the-week&#34; style series presenting Detective Gordon with varied cases to a heavily serialized drama spanning the absolute breadth of the Batman mythos.
Following Gotham&#39;s finale at the end of the fifth season, it&#39;s interesting to see how the five runs the series had on network television compare to one another. Early seasons held to a more episodic format, following Detective Gordon tackling various cases. As the show went on, however, it became more serialized, deftly weaving in the tale of a young Bruce Wayne alongside Gordon and Gotham&#39;s crime-ridden populace. While the series as a whole ranks solidly among DC&#39;s best live-action TV series, there&#39;s no denying some seasons are stronger than others.

 5  Gotham Season 2 Was Tonally Confused 
2015-2016
        

The beginning of Gotham&#39;s move away from a &#34;monster-of-the-week&#34; crime procedural to a heavily serialized narrative drama, season 2 represents Gotham&#39;s biggest stumbling block. This season unleashed a flood of new villains into the fold while still being expected to revisit the nascent Penguin and Riddler, resulting in some curious double-dipping of concepts. Detective Gordon has his home broken into twice in the span of as many episodes, as new characters like Galavan quickly became redundant copies of archetypes the series already had.
Gotham has often been criticized as having tonal issues, and no season exemplifies this worse than season 2. The big picture and performances of the hapless cities&#39; numerous villains are unabashedly silly, while still going for blood with jarringly nasty dialogue and visceral violence. Bruce Wayne spending the entire season trying to break into his father&#39;s expanded storage area behind a fireplace doesn&#39;t help, either. Overall, while season 2 may have touted itself as the &#34;Rise of the Villains&#34;, it represents a decidedly low point in the series&#39; history. 





 4  Gotham Season 3 Struggles To Juggle Too Many Stories 
2016-2017
        

With the momentum of the horde of villains introduced in the two previous seasons, season 3 of Gotham found itself juggling an avalanche of different stories. Here, the show&#39;s plotlines have splintered into many different plots that couldn&#39;t be more different: Bruce becomes enveloped in the intrigue surrounding the Court of Owls while Gordon and Bullock investigate a mafia wedding. Meanwhile, Oswald Cobblepot makes a convincing run for mayor while Gordon meets a newly-annointed Mad Hatter, going on a psychedelic trip through the looking glass along the way.
Among these myriad plots, some work better than others. Harvey and Jim Gordon are a joy to watch as always, as their relationship struggles to withstand the lingering effects of the previous seasons&#39; virus bomb. Bruce also takes some noticeable strides towards being Batman, his own relationship with Alfred being equally enjoyable. However, the ultimate &#34;Rise of Heroes&#34; arc the season promised felt largely unfulfilled as the unwieldy mess of plotlines surrounding the hunt for the cure to Tetch&#39;s virus gracelessly concludes.





 3  Gotham Season 1 Is A Surprisingly Solid Start 
2014-2015
        

The first seasons of many series are often bad, as syncopated TV shows blindly feel their way into an awkward beginning, still struggling to find their footing. As far as Gotham was concerned, the crime drama had a surprisingly solid start that sowed the seeds for the beloved DC characters Batman fans know and love. The first season saw Gotham flex it&#39;s high production value and tremendous performances, showing off strongly what could easily be taken for granted in the later seasons to come.
Still a novelty at the time of its debut, Gotham was certainly not a hard sell, with dedicated Bat-fans sure to rush to its support. Yet looking back, season 1 holds up as a moody police procedural that has yet to bear the weight of season 2&#39;s avalanche of new characters. The first season still has some of the roughest tonal dissonance of the entire show, but Robin Lord Taylor&#39;s young and hungry Oswald Cobblepot is enough to shatter these concerns and make the season worth watching for his performance alone.





 2  Gotham Season 4 Is A Penultimate Triumph 
2017-2018
        

As focus slowly shifted away from Jim Gordon to Bruce and the arc of the villains, season 4 manages to stick the landing on several key plotlines. There are a few hiccups, such as Grundy&#39;s strange transition into Butch or Ra&#39;s Al Ghul&#39;s disappointing live-action representation, but the season finale is strong enough to elevate Gotham&#39;s fourth season head and shoulders above the rest. Batman&#39;s ever-growing rogues gallery carves up the titular city, which feels as though the hardships of the previous seasons have really had an effect, culminating in an unforgettable cliffhanger ending that had fans champing at the bit for season 5.





 1  Gotham Season 5 Provides A Colorful Conclusion 
2019


 







Appropriately beginning with a Gotham City that has utterly succumbed to chaos, season 5 provides a glorious conclusion that fulfills the series&#39; promise in evolving the dark city into the status quo comic fans know and love. As Gordon and Bullock engage with the climactic free-for-all of villains, Bruce and Selina join forces once again to track down Jeremiah. Jeremiah&#39;s transformation into The Joker is by far one of the show&#39;s most compelling arcs, and season 5 proves this with a jaw-dropping reveal that just might be the series&#39; single most unbelievable twist.
From Commissioner Gordon&#39;s signature mustache to the Penguin&#39;s top hat and the Batsuit itself, season 5 saw nearly every character donning their iconic apparel, finally allowing audiences to see what the Fox show&#39;s interpretation of these characters as fans know them would look like. Season 5&#39;s stunning visuals are some of the best in live-action superhero TV, and the final shot of Batman himself nestled over some gargoyles was the culminating moment of fan service the show deserved after such a solid run. It could be said that Gotham&#39;s final season is the strongest because it pays off the setup of the entire show.
