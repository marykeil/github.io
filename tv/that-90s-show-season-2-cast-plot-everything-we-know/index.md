 The Latest That ‘90s Show Season 2 News 
         

The most recent That 90s Show season 2 news was, like many other shows during the 2023 writer&#39;s strike, focused on delays. While season 2 is definitely happening, and with a bumper number of episodes, fans might be waiting a while. That &#39;90s Show season 2 production was originally scheduled for May to September, but the WGA writers&#39; strike, and the subsequent SAG/AFTRA strike put the show on hiatus, with a new date unknown (via What&#39;s on Netflix). Since the strikes have been resolved, no new information has been revealed. 



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023. 









 That ‘90s Show Season 2 is Confirmed 
          

Netflix officially renewed That ‘90s Show for the second season just a few weeks after it premiered on the streaming giant. It typically takes around two or three months after a show premieres for Netflix to announce whether it has been renewed or canceled, so this was an instant vote of approval from Netflix. When talking about the renewal, co-creator Gregg Mettler said they &#34;owe the fans, old and new, for taking the trip with us in the first season — and we can’t wait to be there with them in the second season&#34; (via THR). 



 That &#39;90s Show Season 2 Production Status 
          




Unfortunately, there was no That &#39;90s Show season 2 release date that was attached to the confirmation announcement, but it was seemingly fast-tracked by Netflix given that production was scheduled to start in May 2023. With filming planned to end in September and with little post-production needed for a sitcom like That &#39;90s Show, season 2 was likely planned to be released in January 2024, exactly one year after season one.

However, the Hollywood strikes threw this plan to the wayside, as That &#39;90s Show is one of countless series and movies to be affected. The production for season 2 couldn&#39;t be rescheduled until the strikes were resolved, and with the SAG/AFTRA strike lasting until November 2023, production has likely only just started. Fortunately, sitcoms are much faster and easier to produce than single-camera TV. 



 That ‘90s Show Season 2 Cast 
          




Being a sitcom, the cast is probably going to remain the same for That &#39;90s Show season 2, barring any major changes. That means Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith will be back as Kitty and Red Forman. Becoming the de facto main character during season 1, Callie Haverda will also be back as Leia Forman for season 2. The only unclear thing is the return of That &#39;70s Show characters, since some were major characters like Wilmer Valderrama&#39;s Fez while others like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis merely made cameos as Michael Kelso and Jackie Burkhart.

Other expected returns include: 

 Actor  That &#39;90s Show Role   Ashley Aufderheide  Gwen Runck   Mace Coronel  Jay Kelso   Reyn Doi  Ozzie   Sam Morelos  Nikki   Maxwell Acee Donovan  Nate Runck   Andrea Anders  Sherri Runck   Laura Prepon  Donna Forman   Tommy Chong  Leo Chingkwake
