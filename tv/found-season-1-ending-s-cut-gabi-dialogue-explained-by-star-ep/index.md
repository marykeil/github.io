Summary

  The cut dialogue from the season 1 finale of Found reveals that Gabi would have continued to justify her dark secret of keeping Sir captive to Dhan.   Gabi would have ended up in the fetal position, losing everything when her associates left, leaving only Dhan for support.   The decision to not include dialogue allowed for a more powerful and intimate moment that internalized the characters&#39; emotions.  







Found star Shanola Hampton and executive producer Nkechi Okoro Carroll have revealed cut Gabi dialogue from the very end of the season 1 finale, and what it would have entailed. The final scene of the episode sees Gabi (Hampton) telling her team about Sir (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), who escaped from her basement at the start of the episode. Realizing he will likely hunt her down now that he is free, she begins to cry in her office.

Speaking with TV Insider, Hampton and Carroll revealed what the final moments of Found would have been after the camera cut. They explained how Gabi would justify her dark secret of keeping Sir captive, speaking to Dhan (Karan Oberoi) until she ends up in the fetal position. Check out what Hampton and Carroll had to say below:


Hampton: It’s so heartbreaking. I will tell you that broke my heart for Gabi. What got edited out is by the end of that, if the camera had stayed with Gabi longer, the audience would’ve seen her end up in the fetal position, that’s how bad it was. She just lost everything in that moment because the associates at M&amp;A are the only family that she has. So when they walk out the door, that’s it for her. There’s no one left except for Dhan. Thank God for him. I love that you don’t hear the words. Even though as an actor, I said words, I said a whole monologue explaining all the things. Something was written. It was never going to be heard, but just so you could really feel the impact of coming clean, we did write it and I did say stuff, but all the audience would see are the reactions.
Carroll: We spent an entire episode with her rationalizing her decisions to Dhan that I didn’t feel we needed to hear that again. I felt what was most important was how each character was internalizing essentially the worst, most unimaginable thing, and I just felt it was more powerful to almost be on the outside as if we were intruding on a conversation and we were intruding on a very intimate moment.






 What Gabi’s Revelation Means For Found Season 2 
          

Now that Gabi has revealed her secret, almost every team member knows she was keeping Sir as a way to help solve cases. The only person who doesn’t know yet is Trent, whose relationship with Gabi will be impacted when he finds out the truth. In addition to the revelation, the final shot of the season shows Sir hiding in Lacey&#39;s home, her life in serious danger now that he&#39;s out of confinement.

Given Sir&#39;s alleged love for Gabi, it&#39;s unclear if the former kidnapper would harm her now that he is free. His initial reason for breaking out was to find her after she was held captive by someone in the previous episode, not realizing she had been freed. Now that he&#39;s targeting Lacey - and was implied to have poisoned her dog earlier in the finale - his behavior beyond his cage is going to be unpredictable.




Sir&#39;s fate seems like it will be a key factor of Found season 2, possibly altering the dynamic of the series that has grown familiar up to this point. He could still assist Gabi in future cases, though, if he gets arrested and assigned as an informant the team can rely on. However, it remains to be seen if the group would be open to the idea now that they know he&#39;s been helping them this whole time.



Found season 2 will consist of 22 episodes, longer compared to season 1&#39;s 13 episode count.
