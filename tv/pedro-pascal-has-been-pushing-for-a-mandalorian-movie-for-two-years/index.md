## Literature Review

One interview from the D23 Expo in 2022 reveals that Din Djarin actor Pedro Pascal has been pushing for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie for 2 years.




The Mandalorian star and Din Djarin actor Pedro Pascal has been pushing for Star Wars to make The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie for 2 years, as revealed by a resurfaced interview. Pascal has received a surge of fame along with his iconic Mandalorian bounty hunter character ever since the debut of The Mandalorian TV show in 2019. Despite his busy schedule as one of Hollywood&#39;s most in-demand actors, Pascal has done everything he can to continue bringing Din to life, and it also seems that he&#39;s been a leading force in pushing for more for the future of The Mandalorian.




                  Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie   The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.   

An interview by Fandango, resurfaced by Mandoverse Updates, at the D23 Expo in 2022 shows Pascal&#39;s early enthusiasm at the idea of The Mandalorian becoming a movie. The interviewer first asks The Mandalorian director and season 3 executive producer Rick Famuyiwa about the possibility of &#34;ending the series with a film,&#34; to which Famuyiwa insists he knows nothing about. Pascal then steps in to enthusiastically answer the question with not just one, but two assurances that &#34;[Famuyiwa] wants to&#34; make The Mandalorian movie.


 




Whether it was early conversations about The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu or simply Pascal&#39;s &#34;wizard&#34; ability to predict the Star Wars future, the actor was obviously very eager to get the idea of The Mandalorian movie going. He even adds at the end of the interview that &#34;if [the movie] isn&#39;t a conversation already, then it will be after today.&#34; This seems to prove what kind of a role Pascal&#39;s likely had in pushing for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, as he calls it a &#34;great idea&#34; here and has since affirmed his excitement for the upcoming Star Wars movie.


 Pedro Pascal Is Ready To Lead The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie 
          

Pascal&#39;s infamously busy schedule has caused some viewers to doubt that the extent of the actor&#39;s contribution to The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu would be anything significant, but this enthusiasm Pascal showed two years ago already challenges that notion. The Mandalorian&#39;s shift away from TV will obviously call for Pascal to take on a more active role than before, and it&#39;s clear the actor has no qualms about that. Pascal has the ability to rearrange his schedule should he desire to make room for other projects, which is something he may do to prioritize The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.




Pascal, then, is more than ready to lead Star Wars back to the movie theaters in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, and he has been for over two years. As someone who&#39;s said he&#39;ll play Din Djarin for the rest of his life if Star Wars will have him, viewers have nothing to fear when it comes to Pascal&#39;s involvement in the future of The Mandalorian. While the fate of The Mandalorian season 4 remains uncertain, as well as Pascal&#39;s role in the potential upcoming TV show season, it&#39;s clear his dedication to The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is already profound.
