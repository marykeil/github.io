## Literature Review
Star Trek has a big 2024 planned with three TV series, a new Star Trek movie, podcasts, and numerous conventions to celebrate the franchise.




Star Trek has a big 2024 on tap, and here are 8 things to look forward to from the final frontier this year. Although the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes halted Hollywood production and the ability of talent and creatives to promote their work for much of 2023, Star Trek had a phenomenal year. Star Trek: Picard season 3, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 2, and Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4 released a cumulative 30 episodes, were highly acclaimed as some of the most innovative Star Trek in years, and many episodes charted in the Nielsen streaming Top 10. All in all, 2023 was a great year to be a Star Trek fan.
Significant questions loom over Star Trek in 2024, however. Paramount may be up for sale, which would certainly impact Star Trek on Paramount&#43;&#39;s various series and projects. There remains no new Star Trek theatrical movie in development, going on 8 years since Star Trek Beyond hit theaters in the summer of 2016. And there is no indication that Paramount&#43; will greenlight Star Trek: Picard&#39;s proposed spinoff, Star Trek: Legacy, in spite of the same type of dedicated fan campaign that helped Star Trek: Prodigy jump to Netflix after it was canceled by Paramount&#43;. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes also delayed production of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, which likely won&#39;t premiere until 2025. Still, Star Trek has a massive 2024 planned, and here are 8 things for fans to be excited about.

 7  Star Trek Virtual &amp; In-Person Conventions 
TrekTalks, Virtual Trek Con 5, The LLAPy Awards, STLV, and more
        

Star Trek has a connection to its fans unlike any other in entertainment, and thanks to the various Star Trek conventions, both virtual and in-person, Star Trek fans have the privilege and ability to meet and hear from their favorite talent and creatives. Star Trek essentially pioneered the fan convention and 2024 kicks off with two huge virtual events: TrekTalks 3, hosted by John Billingsley of Star Trek: Enterprise and Bonnie Gordon of Star Trek: Prodigy, streams live on YouTube on January 13th with a full day of panels featuring over 30 Star Trek guests, all to benefit the Hollywood Food Coalition. TrekTalks 3 will also feature a can&#39;t-miss Star Trek: Picard season 3 panel.
Virtual Trek Con 5, from Cirroc Lofton of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Ryan T. Husk, and The 7th Rule podcast, streams on YouTube from February 15-19 with 4 days of Star Trek panels with numerous special guests. VTC5 is capped off by the 3rd annual LLAPy Awards, the only Star Trek awards show voted on by fans, which streams live on YouTube on Sunday, February 19. For in-person Star Trek cons, two of the biggest are Creation Entertainments ST:SF in San Francisco in March and STLV: Trek to Vegas in Las Vegas in August, both featuring dozens of Star Trek talent. And, with no strikes this year, Star Trek on Paramount&#43; will no doubt return once again with huge panels at San Diego Comic-Con in July and New York Comic-Con in October.





 6  Star Trek Day 2024 
Star Trek celebrates the franchise in person again
        

2023 sadly saw Paramount&#43;&#39;s annual in-person Star Trek Day event canceled because of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Since 2021, Star Trek Day has been a celebration of the franchise bringing together talent and creatives from Star Trek on Paramount&#43;&#39;s series and Star Trek&#39;s legacy shows and films. Held at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles and streamed on Paramount&#43; and Star Trek&#39;s social channels, Star Trek Day is expected to return in September 2024, with a likely agenda of honoring the departing Star Trek: Discovery and looking ahead to Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 and more.
Screen Rant was on the red carpet for Star Trek Day 2022. 






 5  Star Trek: Starfleet Academy Announcements 
Expect information about the newest Star Trek series
        

Star Trek: Starfleet Academy was announced by Paramount&#43; in April 2023, and nothing more is known about the newest upcoming Star Trek series besides the fact that Star Trek executive producer Alex Kurtzman and Noga Landau (Nancy Drew) are the showrunners, and the writers&#39; room includes Tawny Newsome of Star Trek: Lower Decks. 2024 should finally see more information about Starfleet Academy, which will hopefully announce the actors/characters of the show, and perhaps even confirm that Starfleet Academy is set after Star Trek: Discovery season 5, as expected.





 4  Star Trek: Section 31 
Star Trek&#39;s first made-for-streaming movie.
        

Announced in April 2023, Star Trek: Section 31 finally begins production from January to March in Toronto for a possible release in late 2024. Section 31 stars Academy Award-winner Michelle Yeoh, who reprises her Star Trek: Discovery anti-hero, Emperor Michelle Georgiou, and Yeoh used her clout from her Best Actress Oscar to ensure Section 31 is made. Star Trek: Section 31 is directed by Olutande Osunsanmi and written by Craig Sweeny, but nothing else is known about the first Star Trek movie made exclusively to stream on Paramount&#43;. Section 31&#39;s potential success could lead to the plan for a new Star Trek streaming movie every 2 years to come to fruition. Even if Star Trek: Section 31 doesn&#39;t premiere in 2024, fans should at least finally learn what other characters are in the movie and what era of Star Trek Section 31 is set in.





 3  Star Trek: Lower Decks Season 5 
Premieres in 2024 on Paramount&#43;.


 







Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4 may have been the animated comedy&#39;s best season yet, and hopes are high that Star Trek: Lower Decks season 5 will top it. The SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes didn&#39;t affect the production of the animated series, and Star Trek: Lower Decks was able to complete its scripts, with 10 new episodes in production for the show&#39;s traditional late summer/early fall release date on Paramount&#43;. Little is known about the stories planned for Star Trek: Lower Decks season 5 and the newly-minuted junior Lieutenants of the USS Cerritos, except that there will be more exploration of the Orion culture through the eyes of former Lt. D&#39;Vana Tendi (Noel Wells). And while there are fears that season 5 could be the last for Star Trek: Lower Decks, hopefully, the 2023 crossover with Star Trek: Strange New Worlds created more fans of Lower Decks, and creator Mike McMahan&#39;s hilarious animated show can continue for years to come.





 2  Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 - The Final Season 
Premieres April 2024 on Paramount&#43;.


 







The only live-action Star Trek series on Paramount&#43;&#39;s 2024 schedule, Star Trek: Discovery season 5 is the final season marking the end of the voyages of Captain Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) and the USS Discovery. It was Star Trek: Discovery&#39;s success on CBS All-Access, which became Paramount&#43;, that led to Star Trek&#39;s current TV renaissance. Although Discovery season 5 was not originally planned as the final season, following Paramount&#43; canceling the series in March 2023, reshoots were completed to turn Discovery&#39;s season 5 finale into a proper ending for the entire series. Star Trek: Discovery season 5 is also a shift in tone to an Indiana Jones-like intergalactic treasure hunt adventure, according to Jonathan Frakes, who directs the penultimate episode of Discovery. Premiering in April 2024, Star Trek: Discovery will be the Star Trek event on Paramount&#43;.

 1  Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 
Premieres in 2024 on Netflix


 







With a huge global audience discovering the all-ages animated series on Netflix, Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 is possibly the most anticipated Star Trek event of 2024. Netflix premiered Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 on Christmas Day, priming viewers new and old for 20 all-new Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 episodes from creators and showrunners Kevin and Dan Hageman and their team. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 promises to go even bigger than season 1&#39;s high stakes, taking Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and the young ragtag former crew of the USS Protostar into an alternate 25th-century future and beyond. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2&#39;s massive scope will reportedly touch upon the entire Star Trek franchise, and the already-announced new castmember The Doctor (Robert Picardo) as well as the new USS Voyager-A are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the surprises, fun, and adventure Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 has in store.
Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Lower Decks are streaming on Paramount&#43;. Star Trek: Prodigy is streaming on Netflix.
