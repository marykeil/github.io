## Literature Review
Memphis Smith surprises 90 Day Fiancé fans with her latest pictures on Instagram. She’s looking like a model after her postpartum weight loss.




Memphis Smith has stunned many 90 Day Fiancé fans with her new glamorous makeover. The Michigan resident is most known for her relationship with Hamza Moknii. She met him on an international dating website and decided to settle with him. During the season, Memphis demanded Hamza marry her as soon as possible if he wanted to stay with her. She overlooked that he was too young for her and pushed him into tying the knot. As expected, the whole thing didn’t last long. Memphis got pregnant with Hamza’s baby and took him to the United States. Later, she realized he wasn’t the one for her and allegedly broke up with him.




Memphis stayed away from social media for most of 2022 and 2023. She only recently returned to Instagram and began showing her postpartum transformation. Memphis shared a picture of herself before the New Year 2024. She sported a cute green outfit highlighting her curves, minimal makeup, and a side-parted straight hairstyle.


 

Memphis wrote, “so committed to your growth that it encourages the ones around you.” She inspired people by telling them to focus on themselves. Fans also loved the reality TV star’s confident post. They complimented her by telling her she looked “like a model.”

 Memphis Accuses Hamza Moknii Of Fraud 
          




While Memphis looks happy in the post, she has made some controversial accusations before that. In November 2023, the mom of three cryptically blamed her former husband, Hamza. She accused him of fraud and shared a long video dedicated to what happened to her. She implied that Hamza had committed immigration marriage fraud and she was the victim. She then shared that there wasn’t enough awareness about what happened to her. Memphis claimed she wouldn’t go into details but would try to spread awareness. She revealed that she’d open up about her case to the right people.

Memphis’ latest post shows that she’s slowly growing and becoming a more positive person than ever. She was at her lowest of lows in 2021. She was hurt after her failed marriage and was dealing with a painful pregnancy. While things improved slightly in 2022, Memphis still couldn’t embrace freedom. She had a lengthy custody battle with Hamza, who eventually gained a chance to see their daughter. Memphis hasn’t posted the real truth behind her divorce. However, she has implied that it’s far worse than anyone expects.




Memphis is finally growing and stepping out of her comfort zone. She locked herself out of social media for a long time but has regained the confidence to speak. It will be interesting to see when she tells her truth publicly. Fans have been waiting to see the conclusion of Memphis and Hamza’s storyline. They want to know what exactly transpired that caused them to seek divorce. Since the two have split, there’s little to no chance they’ll appear on the same show again. However, they can feature on a 90 Day Fiancé spin-off to share their story.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
