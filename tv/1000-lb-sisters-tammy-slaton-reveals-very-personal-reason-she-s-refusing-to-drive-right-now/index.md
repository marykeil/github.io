## Literature Review
1000-Lbs Sisters lead Tammy Slaton can comfortably sit in a car, but there&#39;s something that&#39;s stopping her from driving, despite her weight loss.




Tammy Slaton from 1000-Lb Sisters is admitting why she has anxiety over driving while she continues to lose weight after her surgery. 1000-Lb Sisters season 1 gave viewers an inside look into Tammy and her sister Amy Slaton’s life while they dealt with obesity and other medical conditions. The Kentucky sisters’ weight increased because of genetic factors, emotional eating, and poor living conditions. They had turned to food for comfort when their grandmother, who looked after them, died in 1999. Tammy reached a weight that prevented her from walking even a few steps. However, things started changing when Tammy made progress in her fitness journey.




Tammy has been interacting a lot with her fans on TikTok lately.


 

One of her followers asked her if she knows how to drive or if it’s something she wants to do now that she’s able to fit in a car seat. Tammy told the fan that she wants to learn how to drive “eventually,” but right now her “anxiety is a little too much.” Tammy explained that she has a “lot” going on, but she is taking baby steps. “But yes, eventually, I do wanna drive a car,” she said.

 Tammy Slaton&#39;s Health Improvements Explained 
          

Tammy has been open about her struggles with anxiety before. She said that what helps her is sitting down alone and meditating while taking deep breaths to just let it go. Tammy is overcoming her anxiety slowly as she overcame her weight-loss issues with sheer dedication in 2023. During 1000-Lb Sisters season 1, Tammy weighed over 700 pounds. She was supposed to drop from 717 pounds to 550 pounds to qualify for weight-loss surgery. Tammy lost an additional 180 pounds after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. She had a total weight loss of 363 pounds by October 2023.

Tammy celebrated a huge milestone in her weight-loss journey during a December 2023 episode when she tried to sit in the front seat of a car. The last time she did it was about 15-20 years ago. Tammy had joked that she would get “squished” in the car. She used her walker to get to the car and was comfortably able to sit in the front seat and even buckle her seat belt. Tammy’s brother Chris had exclaimed that even at 16 years old, she was unable to sit in the front seat buckled up. “Sitting in the front seat, It&#39;s like a whole new world,” Tammy added.




In 2021, Tammy entered a food addiction rehab facility. Her health had taken a turn for the worse, and she was hospitalized for three weeks and put into a medically-induced coma before she was able to stay in rehab for 30 days and shed 115 pounds. The 1000-Lbs Sisters star was hospitalized once again in 2022 and given a tracheotomy. She also faced a personal tragedy when her husband, Caleb Willingham, passed away in June 2023, a few months after she married him after meeting him in rehab. Tammy has gone through several moments in life that could have deterred her from losing weight, but her determination is praiseworthy.



1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
