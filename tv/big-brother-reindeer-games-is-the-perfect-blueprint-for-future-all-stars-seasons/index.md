# Big Brother Reindeer Games Is The Perfect Blueprint For Future All-Stars Seasons


## SUMMARY 



  Big Brother Reindeer Games has exceeded expectations and could be a model for future seasons of Big Brother: All-Stars.   A shorter, fast-paced All-Stars season lasting no more than three weeks would be more appealing to players.   The success of Big Brother Reindeer Games may influence the direction of the entire franchise, potentially bringing about changes to future seasons of Big Brother.

## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games has been a huge success, leaving many fans feeling that the spin-off offers a huge opportunity for a future All-Stars.




Big Brother Reindeer Games has been eye-opening for many viewers, especially those who feel like the most recent season of Big Brother: All-Stars was a massive disappointment. There was a lot of excitement for the second iteration of Big Brother: All-Stars during the first summer of the COVID-19 pandemic, as it was something that had been highly requested since the original All-Stars premiered in 2006. Sadly, Big Brother 22 was a huge disappointment for viewers despite the series bringing back some major Big Brother legends to the game. In a surprising twist, Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1, which also brought back a group of legends, has exceeded expectations.




According to fans on Reddit, Big Brother Reindeer Games should be a framework for how future seasons of Big Brother: All-Stars play out. “Reindeer games might be a temporary season due to the writer&#39;s strike, but I think a winter fast-paced All Star season that lasts no more than 3 weeks is exactly what would be needed to secure some of these players who are hesitant to leave their families, as well as make them play HARD,” Yiggity_yag shared. In past seasons of All-Stars, some stars have been unavailable or uninterested in leaving their families for such a long time.


 Would A Shorter Big Brother All-Stars Improve The Franchise? 
          

While many look forward to the two-to-three-month journey of a Big Brother season each summer, the franchise has introduced winter seasons of the show that are roughly three weeks long. Celebrity Big Brother has been the format of the winter seasons thus far, but a shortened season would be a great format for All-Stars in the future. “I think you could produce an equally good show in 20-30 days and RG has proven that,” E4w12p1 shared, while AnnyongFunke explained, “I’ll take 3 weeks of reindeer games over 100 days of BB25 (if we get feeds of course).”





 

It’s possible to compress the drama of a season of Big Brother into a smaller time frame, which would be more interesting if it meant bringing back Big Brother legends to compete again. While some legends may not be interested in returning to play again, others have declined because of their lives and families. Players like Big Brother 13 winner Rachel Reilly have said they&#39;d love to play again but wouldn’t want to leave their children for such a long stretch of time. If the season was compressed like Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1, legends could return for an exciting and fast-paced competition.

With Big Brother Reindeer Games captivating fans, there&#39;s a lot of hope over what changes the spin-off could bring to the franchise. Though it’s possible there could be very little change to the upcoming seasons of Big Brother, after the success of Big Brother Reindeer Games, it seems far more likely that the production team would understand that fans are resonating with the spin-off series more than the original. With Big Brother 26 already looking for new players to join the cast, it’s possible that Big Brother Reindeer Games could influence the direction of the entire franchise.

Big Brother Reindeer Games airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
