 9 Important Lessons Rick &amp; Morty Season 8 Must Learn From Season 7’s Major Changes 
Rick and Morty season 7 made a few changes – some for the better, some for the worse – and season 8 has some lessons to learn from those changes.













 








 10  Morty Rick 
&#34;The Rickshank Rickdemption&#34;
        

Although the tenth-best Morty on this list is only a background character, the implications of his existence make him one of Rick and Morty&#39;s most interesting Mortys. Seen in the background of the Citadel in season 3, episode 1, &#34;The Rickshank Rickdemption,&#34; Morty Rick is a hybrid of Rick and Morty, with the character bearing Morty&#39;s face and shirt as well as Rick&#39;s body, hair, and coat. It isn&#39;t known if Morty Rick is a Rick variant or a Morty variant, or if the two characters accidentally merged to create Morty Rick. Sadly, these questions may never get answered.





 9  Big Morty 
&#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34;
        

Big Morty may not be the most well-remembered Morty from Rick and Morty, but he is one of the most exciting ones. Season 3, episode 7, &#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34; is an anthology episode giving a look at several Rick and Morty variants that live in the Citadel. Big Morty is a drug lord who resides in Morty Town, with him having a hand in every corner of Morty Town&#39;s criminal underworld. Big Morty acts as the antagonist in Cop Morty&#39;s story, with Big Morty being the cause of a violent shootout that leads to his death. Big Morty&#39;s confidence and intimidating presence show that he is nothing like Morty Prime.





 8  Lawyer Morty 
&#34;The Rickshank Rickdemption&#34;
        

Lawyer Morty is another fun version of Morty that only serves the purpose of being a gag character in season 3, episode 1, &#34;The Rickshank Rickdemption.&#34; In the episode, Lawyer Morty is assigned to defend Morty and Summer in their trial against the Council of Ricks, with the duo realizing that things won&#39;t work out in their favor. Lawyer Morty clearly being unfit for the job and strange details such as his having a collection of pogs make Lawyer Morty a goofy yet memorable character in an episode full of Morty variants.





 7  Campaign Manager Morty 
&#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34;
        

Much like Lawyer Morty, Campaign Manager Morty is another one-off version of Morty who is burdened with working a specific job. However, his story in &#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34; is what makes him so great. Campaign Manager Morty starts out managing the campaign of a presidential candidate Morty. However, he soon finds out that the candidate is actually Evil Morty, causing Campaign Manager Morty to turn against him. Sadly, this mistake caused Campaign Manager Morty to lose his life, with him being executed soon after.





 6  Cop Morty 
&#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34;
        

Cop Morty is one of the protagonists in &#34;The Ricklantis Mixup,&#34; but his story quickly takes a dark turn, which is why this version of Morty is so interesting. In the episode, Cop Morty and his partner Cop Rick are working together on various crimes, only for Rick to discover that Morty is taking bribes from Big Morty. This small story of betrayal is one of the most interesting in &#34;The Ricklantis Mixup,&#34; with the Rick and Morty episode dealing with real issues of police corruption through the character of Cop Morty.





 5  The One True Morty 
&#34;  Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind&#34;
        

One of the best versions of Morty in Rick and Morty is a character that hasn&#39;t really been seen, with him being The One True Morty. The One True Morty is a Morty deity that is worshiped by other versions of Morty, with him first being referenced in season 1, episode 10, &#34;  Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind.&#34; The One True Morty was prophesied to free the Mortys from Rick&#39;s torture chamber, and while it was implied that Morty Prime was The One True Morty, this has been deconfirmed.





 4  Hammerhead Morty 
&#34;  Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind&#34;
        

Tons of background Mortys are created for Rick and Morty, and while many of them are forgettable, one has risen to the top. For whatever reason, Hammerhead Morty is the one that has been clung onto by fans, with the character being so odd that he is hilarious. Hammerhead Morty is literally just a Morty with a hammer for a head, with the character&#39;s appearance having no explanation. However, Hammerhead Morty&#39;s popularity has caused him to have cameos throughout the series, with him also appearing in other Rick and Morty franchise material like MultiVersus.





 3  Roy: A Life Well Lived Morty 
&#34;Rick: A Mort Well Lived&#34;
        

Rick and Morty season 6, episode 2, &#34;Rick: A Mort Well Lived&#34; tells an odd Morty story, with Morty being trapped inside of the fictional video game Roy: A Life Well Lived. While in the game, Morty&#39;s mind is split between every NPC in the game, causing the game to create an entire civilization of Mortys. The episode is a fantastic look into Morty&#39;s psyche, with the Rick and Morty episode changing Morty forever by having these new versions of Morty finally confront Rick.





 2  Evil Morty 
&#34;  Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind&#34;


 







Out of all the alternate versions of Morty in Rick and Morty, the one that has gotten the most development by far is Evil Morty. Alongside Rick Prime, Evil Morty has been the show&#39;s main antagonist, with him serving as a massive threat to the multiverse. Evil Morty&#39;s backstory and history is still being discovered, but the character&#39;s relationship with the show&#39;s main Rick and Morty makes him fascinating and incredibly intimidating.
            
 
 10 Improvised Rick &amp; Morty Moments That Made The Show Even More Hilarious 
Rick and Morty is an animated adult comedy show full of charm and some of that characteristic charm stems from the improvised comedy in early seasons.









 1  Morty Prime 
&#34;Pilot&#34;


 







Morty Prime (formerly known as Morty C-137) is the main character in Rick and Morty, and he is still the show&#39;s best version of the character. Morty has gone through all kinds of troubles and development throughout the show&#39;s seven seasons, with his relationship with Rick and his family being explored in a way that no other Morty has received. While Morty Prime may seem a little bland appearance-wise compared to his alternate versions, when it comes to story and characterization, Rick and Morty still hasn&#39;t outdone the original Morty.
