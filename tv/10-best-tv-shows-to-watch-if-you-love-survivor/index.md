## Literature Review
If the seasons of Survivor aren&#39;t enough to quench your thirst for reality competition series, check out these other similar shows.




Survivor season 45 wraps up at the end of the year, and viewers may need other shows to enjoy as they wait for the next season. The reality TV cornerstone has inspired many other reality competition series that came after it, several of which are still on the air today. While current Survivor season 45 shows how much the series has changed since the inaugural Survivor season 1, much of the format remains the same, adding to its appeal.
What is there to watch in between highly anticipated Survivor seasons? Plenty of other shows on the air will appeal to fans of Survivor, and here are the top 10 greatest. Between different platforms, genres, and formats, many shows have sought inspiration from one of the top reality TV shows ever. Which are some of the best to check out between Survivor episodes?









 








 1  The Circle (2020-) 
Stream On Netflix


 







The Circle has been described as Catfish meets Big Brother. While the players aren’t set out in the wild to forage for food, build shelter, and live with meager means, they are isolated, albeit in an expensive apartment where they can only communicate with others via a text messaging program called “Circle.” There’s still the same level of building alliances, strategizing, and voting out others. There are also many twists on The Circle, just like in Survivor. But it’s not quite as raw and survivalist as Survivor. Nonetheless, the focus on voting out people until only a few finalists remain is the same.





 2  Big Brother (2000-) 
Stream On Paramount&#43;


 







Big Brother and Survivor share many similarities, including people living together in one home (or, in the case of Survivor, on an island in tribes) and a variety of competitions to test physical and mental strength and endurance. Big Brother season 26 is on the way since season 25 wrapped up in November 2023. Big Brother players get to live in a massive home, but they are also cut off from the real world. That means there’s a lot of strategizing, alliance-building, and conversations in the middle of the night or whenever players can get away from others to devise plans.





 3  Solitary (2006 - 2010) 
Available To Buy On AppleTV
        

Airing way back in the mid-2000s, Solitary followed players who were kept in solitary confinement 24/7 for weeks on end. The last person able to make it the entire time in their pod will win the grand prize of $50,000. At the same time, Survivor takes a lot of mental strength to deal with feeling alone in a game with strangers; solitary ups the ante by forcing players to be without human contact or communication. The players communicate with an artificial intelligence named Val, and players are able to do things like send a letter to loved ones, speak to others through Val, and win the ability to taunt others at various intervals in the game.





 4  Capture (2013) 
Available To Buy On Amazon
        

It only lasted a single season, but Capture made the list. Also referred to as The Hunt, the idea was that a dozen pairs are brought to a massive wilderness area where they must hunt for various items, eliminating other teams. The competition lasted an entire month while teams would stay at a small camp where they were given only limited rations, just like in Survivor. For everything else, it was all about survival skills. Fans followed the players through a special vest with a camera over their shoulder and an armband mount displaying a map, location, and other useful information.





 5  72 Hours (2013) 
Available To Stream On PlutoTV
        

Also, like Survivor, 72 Hours saw people drop into the wilderness with only a few essential items. For the rest, they were left to fend for themselves. Players were placed in teams and had to travel through dangerous wildlife, insect infestations, and more. The objective was to find a hidden briefcase with $100,000. The show only lasted one season. Interestingly, unlike shows like Survivor, where fans follow the same group through the entire season, 72 Hours had a different team of players in every episode.





 6  Castaways (2018) 
Not Currently Available To Stream
        

Set in Indonesia, Castaways follows 12 players trying to survive on an island, just like Survivor. The twist here was that players didn’t always know other castaways nearby. The only way to get off the island was to locate a rescue team or quit. Compared to the show Lost, each player was able to bring along only one piece of luggage, but with a twist: each player washed ashore with someone else’s luggage. A journal was the only required item to include, where each person had to write about themselves so that whoever ended up with their suitcase could learn about them. The show only lasted a single season.





 7  The Challenge (1998-) 
Stream On Paramount&#43;


 







It’s no surprise, given the similarities between the two shows, that many Survivor alums have gone on to play The Challenge. The competition show, a spinoff of The Real World and Road Rules, pits players against one another in various group physical challenges. Like the tribe mentality on Survivor, players must work together. However, unlike Survivor, the winner, in the end, is a team, not an individual, which makes having a good team and keeping the strongest members on board even more critical. Similar to Survivor, there have also been plenty of players over the age of 40 competing. While The Challenge USA has gained popularity, The Challenge season 39 will likely happen in the next few months.





 8  Survivorman (2005 - 2016)  
Stream On FuboTV
        

Hailing from Canada, this is the only show on the list that isn’t classified as a reality show. Instead, it follows Les Stroud, a Canadian filmmaker and survival expert, as he demonstrates his survival skills and knowledge while he lives for ten days in a remote location. Like players on Survivor, Stroud only has limited food, water, and equipment. For everything else, he must work to source what he needs. Interestingly, there’s no crew: Stroud films everything himself. Naturally, then, the element of the mental and emotional toll being alone in the wilderness takes is a large part of the show as well.





 9  The Amazing Race (2001-) 
Stream On Hulu
        

Travel with teams of two who embark on an intense scavenger hunt, visiting different countries around the world looking for clues, competing in challenges, and learning about culture in The Amazing Race. From using maps to navigate foreign countries to learning a skill critical to the country, dancing, singing, playing an instrument, or even doing puzzles, the competitions run the gamut. It’s no surprise that many players from Survivor have moved on to appear on The Amazing Race. Every episode is high-intensity, from scaling large buildings to cake decorating, learning a national pastime, and finding the best flight deals.





 10  Australian Survivor (2002, 2006, 2016-) 
Not Currently Available For Streaming
        

Survivor has become so popular that it has spawned many other versions worldwide. One such version is Australian Survivor, which, according to fans of Survivor, is the best show for those who love the American version. The format is identical, with the show even taking some of the themes from the American version, such as Blood V Water, which aired in early 2022 and pits family members against one another. It’s safe to assume that fans of Survivor who love the format and wish there were more seasons would be wise to check out versions from other countries.
