## Literature Review

Any upcoming installments of The Mandalorian, including the newly-announced movie, need to learn one vital lesson from season 3 of the show.




Potential upcoming installments of The Mandalorian, from season 4 to The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, must learn one crucial lesson from season 3 of the Disney&#43; show. In recent months, the future of The Mandalorian has become simultaneously unclear and exciting. January 2024 brought the announcement of a new Star Wars movie titled The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu with the titular duo making their way to the big screen. However, this led to confusion over whether the movie would actively replace The Mandalorian season 4&#39;s story or whether both would be released as one overarching story.

This confusion has not been eased by Lucasfilm with the studio yet to confirm or deny recent rumors. These rumors claimed that a shorter version of The Mandalorian season 4 will be released on Disney&#43; before the upcoming Star Wars movie of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will serve as a theatrical continuation. Regardless, one thing remains clear: any installment pertaining to The Mandalorian&#39;s sub-franchise of Star Wars must learn a valuable lesson after The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s ending highlighted a big character problem within the story of the lone bounty hunter and his adopted child.


 The Mandalorian Season 3 Lost Sight Of Din Djarin &amp; Grogu 
          




The lesson that future installments of The Mandalorian must learn is not to lose sight of what made the show special initially: Din Djarin and Grogu. The majority of The Mandalorian seasons 1 and 2 worked because the story centered intrinsically on the two characters. From Din&#39;s protection of Grogu from the Empire in season 1 to the rescue of his adopted son in season 2, the heart of The Mandalorian&#39;s story was solely attributed to the titular character and his new companion.

However, The Mandalorian season 3 unfortunately lost sight of this relationship. While Din and Grogu were together for the entire season, little of note was presented that developed their bond in any way. Instead, The Mandalorian season 3 focused on Din&#39;s connection with Mandalore, both the planet and the people that inhabit it like the Children of the Watch and Bo-Katan Kryze. This meant that the emotional focal point of The Mandalorian seasons 1 and 2 was lost for season 3, making for a much less impactful season overall.






 The Mandalorian Season 4 &amp; Its Movie Need To Focus On Its Characters 
          

In light of this, the potential story of The Mandalorian season 4 and the confirmed The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu must reposition the focus of the franchise onto its central characters. It is no coincidence that the two most beloved installments of the show thus far are the seasons in which Din and Grogu&#39;s relationship is the primary focus. Therefore, this bond needs to be restored going forward.

While the exploration of Mandalore and Din&#39;s place in the galaxy was intriguing in The Mandalorian season 3, the writing simply could not balance this arc with the character&#39;s relationship with Grogu. The larger, galaxy-altering plot cannot continue to outgrow or outweigh the two characters as it did in The Mandalorian season 3 or both potential upcoming entries to the franchise will be negatively impacted. If The Mandalorian season 4 and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu can retain the relationship that captured viewers&#39; hearts, the franchise will be universally successful once more.
