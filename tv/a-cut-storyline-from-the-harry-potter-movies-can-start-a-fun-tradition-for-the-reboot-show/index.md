# A Cut Storyline From The Harry Potter Movies Can Start A Fun Tradition For The Reboot Show


## SUMMARY 



  Max&#39;s Harry Potter TV show remake will follow the books more closely, allowing for the inclusion of cut plotlines and details that were left out in the movies.   The Deathday Party chapter from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which was not included in the films, could be adapted as a Halloween episode in the Max reboot.   The Max reboot has the opportunity to create fun Halloween-themed specials, as the Harry Potter books often had significant events happening around Halloween that were not fully explored in the movies.

## Literature Review
The HBO Harry Potter remake has the opportunity to use a cut storyline from the books and start a fun tradition that it could use in many seasons.




Max&#39;s upcoming Harry Potter TV show remake is expected to follow the books more closely than the movies, which means they could use a cut storyline from the movies to start a fun tradition. Although the news of the reboot came relatively quickly, considering that the last film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, premiered in 2011, it has an opportunity to explore the source material better. J.K. Rowling&#39;s Wizarding World universe is very complex and detailed, and Max has revealed that it will adapt the seven Harry Potter books over ten years. That could prove to be challenging, but it could also work in its favor.




The magic of the eight Harry Potter movies is hard to replicate, but they weren&#39;t perfect by any means. Given that films have a limited time to adapt the story, there were many details, storylines, and even characters that the original films left out. Although there are many character details and moments the Harry Potter remake can&#39;t replicate, the Max Harry Potter remake has an opportunity to create a more faithful adaptation of the source material, which could also set it apart from the movies by bringing some cut plotlines from the books to life and starting its own traditions.

                  10 Biggest Challenges Harry Potter&#39;s TV Remake Must Overcome   The Harry Potter TV remake has the potential of being great, but there are various factors working against it, including the franchise&#39;s popularity.    


 The Harry Potter Movies Cut Nearly Headless Nick&#39;s Deathday Party 
The scene took place on Halloween
         




Nearly Headless Nick (or Sir Nicholas) was Gryffindor&#39;s house ghost, and he had several scenes, but his Deathday Party didn&#39;t make it to the books. The students interacted with the ghosts more in the books, and in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry had been invited to Nick&#39;s Deathday Party, which celebrated the anniversary of the day he died. The scene didn&#39;t make it in the second installment, which was a shame, because it was funny, weird, and gross, but it was a perfect Halloween scene, especially as it took place on October 31.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron were forced to skip the annual Halloween party to attend Nearly Headless Nick&#39;s 500th Deathday Party. However, it gave readers a bigger view of the Wizarding World, because the guests were mostly ghosts, and all of them had interesting stories. Moaning Myrtle and Peeves the Poltergeist were also invited and it gave a rare insight into the world of ghosts, which seemed to behave like a normal community at a party. There was music, and disgusting food, and, although the Golden Trio were the only humans attending the party, Sir Nicholas explained that it gave him a certain status to have them at his party.






 Max&#39;s Harry Potter Reboot Should Turn This Chapter Into A Halloween Episode 
This could set it apart from the movie adaptation
          

The upcoming Max Harry Potter reboot should adapt the Deathday Party chapter as a Halloween episode. Although Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets still maintains a light tone compared to what&#39;s to come in the rest of the franchise, Nearly Headless Nick&#39;s Deathday Party is the best example of how creepy the franchise can sometimes get, which could work perfectly as a Halloween special. Although the second installment has many creepy moments for people with arachnophobia and ophidiophobia given the scenes with Aragog and the Basilisk, the ghost chapter is still pretty light in a fun way.

Harry, Hermione, and Ron attended the Deathday party, but they found it a bit odd. Although all the ghost guests liked Harry and welcomed them at the party, there was nothing edible for them to eat, and the music wasn&#39;t celebratory, but sad and lamenting. The three of them were keen to check it out, but they used the first opportunity to leave the party. This storyline that was cut from the Harry Potter films would make for a great episode on the Max reboot. Besides, it leads to Harry and his friends finding the first victim of the Basillisk, which would be the perfect ending for a Halloween episode.




                  Death Eaters Can Be So Much Cooler In The Harry Potter Remake (&amp; Far  r To Canon)   The Harry Potter movies made the Death Eaters dirty and stupid, but the remake has the opportunity to restore the sophisticated villains of the book.     



 Halloween Episodes Could Become A Fun Tradition For The Max Reboot 
The Harry Potter films barely covered the holidays
          

The Harry Potter books heavily commented on holidays, and the Max reboot could start a fun tradition with Halloween episodes. The movie adaptations did show glimpses of the fun Halloween decorations, but they never focused on the day itself. Harry Potter is a series about magic, and there are many ways it could create interesting, creepy, and fun Halloween-themed specials. In the books, some of the most defining moments happen around Halloween, especially in the first novels, and it could help the show create original moments that are not overshadowed by the movie adaptations.




The first book had a big party on Halloween, and Professor Quirrell used the opportunity to release the troll in the dungeons. In Chamber of Secrets, they attended Nearly Headless Nick&#39;s Deathday Party. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius snuck in on Halloween and attacked the Fat Lady portrait, and the Champions were chosen on Halloween in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, proving the holiday could become a fun tradition for the upcoming Harry Potter Max reboot.
