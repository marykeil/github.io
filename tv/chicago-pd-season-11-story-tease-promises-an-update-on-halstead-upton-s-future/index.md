## Literature Review
An update on Chicago P.D. season 11 teases the future of Upton addressing a possible appearance by Halstead, after Jesse Lee Soffer’s abrupt exit.




A new update on Chicago P.D. season 11 teases Upton and Halstead&#39;s future. Tracy Spiridakos, who first appeared in Chicago P.D. season 4 in a recurring capacity, quickly became a significant main cast member as Hailey Upton. As part of Chicago P.D. season 10, Upton struggled with the sudden exit of her husband, Jay Halstead (played by Jesse Lee Soffer). He leaves for Bolivia, in hopes of finding some cartel targets. In the process, he stops returning her calls.




In an interview with TVLine ahead of Chicago P.D. season 11, showrunner Gwen Sigan gave an update on the future of Halstead and Upton and offered a candid response to whether Soffer could reprise his lead role. Read Sigan&#39;s quote below:


“I do think there will be closure. I do think that we’re going to see Upton deal with a lot of what happened last year with the fallout and find her way through it and find her way out to the other side — and to a better side for her character. [Upton will find her way to a] healthy, better side, so there will be closure.”
“[There are] no plans to bring [Jay Halstead] back at this point for anything, but I never say never.”



 Upton&#39;s Chicago PD Exit, Explained 
          

It was announced in October of last year that Spiridakos would be leaving the NBC series, the latest in a string of One Chicago exits in the 2024 schedule. Her departure comes after Soffer&#39;s headline-grabbing sendoff in the previous season. The actor mentioned that departing Chicago P.D. was difficult but would leave the door open to return in the future. Audiences were not receptive to how Halstead was written off, arguing that it diminished the couple known as &#34;Upstead&#34; because he not only leaves for Bolivia but fails to tell Upton that he plans to extend his stay.




In any case, Upton will have a busy time in the coming season. New Chicago P.D. story details reveal that her upcoming exit will see the seasoned detective dealing with the task of shadowing a crisis prevention team. She&#39;ll ultimately find her approach to policing to be at odds with the team&#39;s mental health clinician, and it will bring out some of the character&#39;s personal struggles.

                  Ruzek Survives &amp; 6 Other Theories For Chicago PD Season 11   The premiere of Chicago PD season 11 may be a ways away, but the season 10 finale left viewers with unfinished storylines that need to be addressed.    

The larger One Chicago franchise, which includes Chicago Med and Chicago Fire, has included surprise cameos to help a character with their send-off. This even happened with the Chicago Med season 8 farewell of Will Halstead (Nick Gehlfuss), Jay&#39;s brother, as Natalie (Torrey Devitto) appears near the end. This does not look likely for Chicago P.D., though maybe Upton will still find some peace.






Chicago PD season 11 debuts Wednesday, January 17 at 10 PM ET on NBC.
