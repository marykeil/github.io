Olivia felt controlled and criticized by Ethan&rsquo;s family, especially Kim, who wanted to trade engagement rings with her.   Olivia and Ethan announced their divorce separately, with Olivia using harsh language and blaming the Plath family for their marriage ending.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Welcome To Plathville&rsquo;s Olivia Plath has said some difficult things about her husband, Ethan Plath&rsquo;s, family over the years. Here are the worst.</p>
<p>Welcome To Plathville’s Olivia Plath has been vocal about her feelings for her ex-husband Ethan Plath and his family, at times even getting nasty about her ex in-laws. While Olivia and Ethan were married for five years, the couple announced they’d be divorcing in late 2023. Many Welcome To Plathville season 5 viewers weren’t shocked by the news, as they’d been speculating that the couple may have broken up for months after they went radio silent on social media. Despite the fact that Ethan and Olivia’s relationship had always been somewhat quiet due to their time on the family’s series, viewers were convinced there was something wrong.</p>
<p>Olivia, who once had a decent relationship with the Plath family, had come to an impasse with her in-laws. After the Plath siblings, including Moriah Plath and Micah Plath, posted on Instagram to share they were excommunicating Olivia from their lives, Ethan had a difficult choice to make. He had to decide if he was going to be loyal to his wife or his siblings. In the moment, he chose his wife, but after the couple split, he went back to his family of origin. In the meantime, Olivia had some harsh words about the stars of Welcome To Plathville.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>“When Ethan was about 16, 17, his mom signed him up to be on her down line for an MLM she was a part of called Young Living,”
Olivia Plath Accused Kim Plath Of Being Involved In A Pyramid Scheme</p>
<p>In an early episode of Welcome To Plathville, Olivia explained that Kim Plath, Ethan’s mother, was a lot shadier than she made herself out to be. While Kim and Olivia’s relationship had been decent for a time, it came to light that Ethan’s mother had been extorting him in more ways than one. For Olivia, the ways Kim chose to take advantage of her son were difficult to process. She shared that at one point, Kim erroneously signed Ethan up to be in her “team” for an mutli level marketing scheme. She shared that seeing Kim take advantage of Ethan was difficult to witness.</p>
<p>“Ethan is the one and only relationship I’ve ever been in, so I have nothing to compare it to.&quot;
Olivia Plath Puts Ethan Plath Down A Lot</p>
<p>Ethan and Olivia got together at a young age, getting married by the time they were just 20 years old. While Olivia and Ethan could’ve dated in their youth in different families, the families they were born into wouldn’t have allowed them to experience romantic love so early in life. Growing up in fundamentalist families, Ethan and Olivia were cut off from most modern experiences in their youth and ultimately, when Olivia finally married Ethan there was very little for her to compare the relationship to. While she was simply sharing that Ethan is the only serious relationship she’s ever had, the way she phrased it put her ex-husband down.</p>
<p>“He Was Being Stolen From”
Olivia Plath Accused Kim Plath Of Using Ethan Plath&rsquo;s Credit Card &amp; Not Repaying Him</p>
<p>After learning about the MLM that Kim allegedly roped Ethan into, Olivia was already suspicious of her mother-in-law’s intentions. When Ethan shared that Kim was not only pushing him into business schemes, but potentially stealing from her husband by using his credit cards. Ethan explained to Olivia when they were discussing finances that Kim used his credit cards to make purchases, refusing to pay him back and cashing in on the rewards she was earning by using the card. Kim turned on Oliva after being confronted. Olivia’s decision to make Ethan and Kim’s drama about herself made it clear she wasn’t necessarily interested in coming to a resolution.</p>
<p>“When we were dating, I knew that I was being controlled.&quot;
Olivia Plath Said That Kim Plath Wanted To Trade Rings With Her</p>
<p>Olivia explained on Welcome To Plathville that while she knew marrying into the Plath family would involve a lot more than just Ethan, things were more extreme than she expected. Olivia, who was coming out of her own fundamentalist family, shared that she felt that when she and Ethan were dating she felt Kim was very controlling. She explained that when Kim first saw her engagement ring, she exclaimed that she wanted to trade with Olivia. While it could’ve been a joke, Olivia took it seriously and felt that Kim was even more controlling than she’d realized.</p>
<p>“Ethan and I have decided to go our separate ways.”
Olivia Plath Finally Announced Her Divorce</p>
<p>When Ethan and Olivia’s impending divorce was made public, it wasn’t done mutually the way that most reality TV stars share news. Instead, after Welcome To Plathville season 5 entered the back half of the season, Olivia and Ethan released separate statements announcing their divorce. While Ethan’s statement shared that he had nothing but good will towards his soon-to-be ex-wife, Olivia’s wasn’t quite as forgiving. She made it very clear that she had chosen divorce, using harsh language surrounding the announcement that seemed to be shaming Ethan and the Plath family as a whole.</p>
<p>“He Says I’m Not the Person He Married.”
Olivia Plath Got Real About Her Troubles With Ethan Plath</p>
<p>While Ethan and Olivia’s problems began to catch up to them, things quickly got troubling for the couple. As they weren’t spending much time together and found themselves drifting apart, Olivia and Ethan did their best to discuss their problems in an open, honest way. Olivia shared that Ethan said she wasn’t the person he married, explaining that her views and values had shifted tremendously after their wedding. While Olivia wasn’t apologetic about the change in her personality, she shared that she didn’t completely understand how Ethan didn’t expect them to change their outlooks after living life together for the better part of five years.</p>
<p>“I was criticized for what kind of toothpaste I used, or what I ate, or what I wore, or what I did.&quot;
Olivia Plath Called Out Kim Plath Again</p>
<p>Although Kim, her ex-husband Barry Plath, and the rest of the Plath family claimed they were welcoming to Olivia, she shared a different version of events on Welcome To Plathville. Olivia explained that she always felt criticized, especially when it came to Ethan’s mother. Olivia shared that she was nervous to go over to Ethan’s family home, and would find her stomach in knots as she knew she’d be critiqued and questioned about everything possible, and then some. While Kim may have simply been trying to get to know her, Olivia felt she was being called out and made her opinion known to everyone around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It went from like, &lsquo;I love you so much&rsquo; to &lsquo;You have the devil in you’.”
Olivia Plath Talked About Her Horrible Relationship With Kim Plath</p>
<p>Although Kim seems like she’s always been critical of Olivia, the two shared a bond at one point in their relationship. When Olivia was first introduced to the Plath family, Kim accepted her and wanted to get to know her better. After some time, it was clear that Olivia wasn’t a fan of the way Kim treated Ethan. This, as expected, rubbed Kim the wrong way and she chose to not only sever ties with Olivia but criticize her whenever possible. Sharing that Olivia was reminiscent of the devil in her eyes, Welcome To Plathville’s Kim was simply looking out for her son while Olivia took her criticism too personally.</p>
