## Literature Review

Most TV couple can&#39;t admit their interest right away or at all. However,  with these couples, the attraction was immediate and undeniable. 




Love at first sight is a common trope in romance movies and books, but there are also plenty of television couples that prove it can be the real thing. Though the course of their relationships might not have always run smoothly, it was clear from the moment they locked eyes that these couples were destined to be together. Whether or not they acted on their feelings right away, the push and pull of their romantic tension was a huge part of their series.
The chemistry between a couple that falls in love at first sight must be off the charts, and obvious to everyone around them. Often, TV shows will use classic film and television tricks like slowing time down or making it seem like there&#39;s no one else in the room but the fated couple. Of course, the conflict in the shows might mean that the couple doesn&#39;t end up together, as first love doesn&#39;t always last forever, but there&#39;s no question the relationships made an impact on the characters and the series.

After meeting in a bar and spending the night together in the pilot of Grey&#39;s Anatomy, Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and Derek (Patrick Dempsey) couldn&#39;t stay away from each other. Both knew that something about their one-night stand was different, and that being together felt right. There was no couple easier to root for on the show, and few couples with more external factors trying to keep them apart. Although their relationship has a bittersweet end, Meredith and Derek are each other&#39;s one true love.

Marissa (Mischa Barton) is drawn to Ryan (Ben McKenzie) from the moment she lays eyes on him. It&#39;s clear that he&#39;s not from her glittering, picture-perfect world of Orange County, but she wonders if maybe he&#39;s been sent as an answer to her problems. Unfortunately, Ryan and Marissa do end up causing each other a lot of problems, but only because they love each other so much. The biggest source of conflict in their relationship is that they come from different worlds, but when they&#39;re alone together, that becomes the least important thing in the world.

Though Elena (Nina Dobrev) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) end up having the epic love story that she and Stefan (Paul Wesley) thought was theirs, it&#39;s Stefan that Elena falls in love with first. It&#39;s revealed later on in the show that Elena met Damon first, and the attraction is prevalent, but when she runs into Stefan at school in the pilot, their connection is just as strong. When Elena is first introduced, Stefan is the great love she&#39;s been waiting for.
Time and change cause that love to evolve, but it never goes away, and their bond will always be what set Elena on her greatest adventure. Damon has to do a lot of growing before he becomes worthy of Elena&#39;s love, and their relationship develops over time. Stefan is honorable and would do anything for Elena from the start, and that is what she needs and falls head-over-heels for right away.

Michael (Steve Carell) was never lucky in love until he met Holly (Amy Ryan), and even then the timing wasn&#39;t right until the last season he was on the show. However, once she appeared in season 4, there was never going to be anyone else for Michael. They laughed together and related to each other in a way no one had been able to with Michael up until that point. Holly helped soften and humanize Michael, and his love for her proved what a good guy he was deep down inside.

At the time that Alec (Matthew Daddario) meets Magnus (Harry Shum Jr.), he&#39;s still unsure of his sexuality and trying to figure out what he wants from life. Once he sees Magnus, everything is put in perspective, and there&#39;s no denying what he feels. Though they start with sparks flying immediately, they develop a solid relationship built on mutual love and trust. The dramatic beginning of their romance reflects the intensely passionate feelings they have for each other, but once they commit, they realize that the mutual attraction is much more, it&#39;s love.

When Ted (Josh Radnor) and Robin (Cobie Smulders) lock eyes across the bar, it feels like a moment out of a fairytale, but the show makes it clear that Robin is not the mother of Ted&#39;s children. Despite this, and that they marry other people throughout the show&#39;s run, Ted and Robin can&#39;t seem to let go of each other. Even though they have their differences, Ted and Robin have fun together. They prove that soulmates can look a lot of different ways, and they might be just as good at being best friends as being in love.

 4  Kurt &amp; Blaine - Glee (2009 - 2015) 
Not just great duet partners, but great partners in general
        

  Glee  
TV-14
Comedy
Drama
Musical



  Release Date    May 19, 2009     Cast    Dianna Agron , Chris Colfer , Jessalyn Gilsig , Jane Lynch , Jayma Mays , Kevin McHale , Lea Michele , Cory Monteith , Matthew Morrison , Amber Riley     Seasons    6     Writers    Ian Brennan , Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk     Network    FOX     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu     Showrunner    Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk    


Kurt (Chris Colfer) may have expressed his feelings first, but he and Blaine (Darren Criss) were drawn to each other from the moment they met at Dalton Academy. When Kurt transfers from McKinley High School to Dalton in Glee, it&#39;s because he isn&#39;t feeling accepted and able to express himself fully. As one of the few out LGBTQ&#43; kids at the school, the series didn&#39;t shy away from the discrimination that can come with that.
At Dalton, Kurt meets Blaine and instantly feels not only accepted but also the beginnings of an epic love story. Their voices pair beautifully when they sing together, and each brings the other out of their shell in terms of their performances on the show. Although they face challenges when Kurt leaves for college, the pull of their connection is impossible to resist for them both.





 3  Daphne &amp; Niles - Frasier (1993 - 2004) 
A classic case of opposites attract
        

  Frasier  
TV-PG
Comedy



  Release Date    September 16, 1993     Cast    Kelsey Grammer , Jane Leeves , David Hyde Pierce , Peri Gilpin , John Mahoney , Jack Cutmore-Scott , Anders Keith , Jess Salgueiro , Toks Olagundoye , Nicholas Lyndhurst     Seasons    11     Story By    David Angell, Peter Casey, David Lee, Glen Charles, Les Charles     Writers    David Angell , Peter Casey , David Lee     Network    NBC     Streaming Service(s)    Paramount&#43;     Directors    David Lee , Kelsey Grammer , James Burrows , Pamela Fryman    


Frasier Crane&#39;s younger sibling, Niles (David Hyde Pierce), is just as compelling a character as his brother, in part due to his fantastic relationship with Daphne (Jane Leeves). Daphne is the caretaker for the brothers&#39; father, Martin (John Mahoney), and is free and accepting where the Crane brothers are uptight and restricted. Despite his emotional hangups, Niles becomes instantly infatuated with Daphne. Though she denies her feelings for longer, she shares the attraction. Seeing their will-they-won&#39;t-they dynamic fade and finally admitting that they&#39;ve been wild about each other from the start is one of the best parts of the series.





 2  Oliver &amp; Felicity - Arrow (2012 - 2020) 
From underdog fan favorite couple to the central love story
        

  Arrow  
Superhero
Drama
Action
Mystery
Crime



  Release Date    January 10, 2013     Cast    colin donnell , Paul Blackthorne , Willa Holland , Susanna Thompson , Katie Cassidy , David Ramsey , Stephen Amell     Seasons    8     Story By    Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Andrew Kreisberg     Network    The CW     Franchise(s)    Arrowverse     Directors    Andrew Kreisberg , Greg Berlanti    


Arrow made a bold choice when it diverged from the original comics and made Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) Oliver&#39;s (Stephen Amell) primary love interest instead of Laurel AKA the Black Canary (Katie Cassidy). However, it was a strong choice as it made the show stand apart from the source material, and the chemistry between Oliver and Felicity was too apparent to deny. The scene where they first meet is so full of romantic tension that it propelled Felicity from a minor part to a main character, and changed the course of the characters&#39; lives forever.





 1  David &amp; Patrick - Schitt’s Creek (2015 - 2020) 
A couple that helped each other grow and discover who they really are


 







  Schitt&#39;s Creek  
TV-14
Comedy



  Release Date    January 13, 2015     Cast    Catherine O&#39;Hara , Dan Levy , Noah Reid , Emily Hampshire , Tim Rozon , Dustin Milligan , Eugene Levy , Jennifer Robertson , Chris Elliott , Annie Murphy     Seasons    6     Writers    Dan Levy , Eugene Levy , David West Read     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix     Showrunner    Dan Levy , Eugene Levy    


David (Dan Levy) and Patrick (Noah Reid) may come from vastly different backgrounds, but two people have rarely been more right for each other. Many quotes in Schitt&#39;s Creek prove that David and Patrick are perfect for each other. Patrick had not explored his sexuality before he met David, and David had never felt safe and loved in a relationship before they were together. However, when they meet, there is an immediate closeness and sense of ease that foreshadows how happy they will be, and their future marriage.
