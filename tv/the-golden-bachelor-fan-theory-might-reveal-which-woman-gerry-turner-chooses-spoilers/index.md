## Literature Review
There is a spoiler regarding who The Golden Bachelor lead, Gerry Turner, will choose between Leslie and Theresa based on fan theory over a video.




Now that The Golden Bachelor season 1 is close to the end, fans have dissected the promo video and think they&#39;ve figured out who Gerry Turner chose. Viewers watched Gerry land in Costa Rican paradise with his two final choices, Leslie Fhima and Theresa Nist, to spend much-needed alone time together. Gerry spent a full day and night with each of the women, trying to figure out which one he can&#39;t live without.




The answer to that prompt may have been under The Golden Bachelor fans&#39; noses all along. In a Facebook Group for The Golden Bachelor fans, a spoiler theory has been floating around denoting who Gerry picked. In the original promo video for the hit reality show, at the 30-second mark, Ellen Goltzer is shown with her head in her hands as a voice cries, &#34;You made it sound like you chose me!&#34;


 

That voice was not Ellen&#39;s, and fans recognize it as Leslie&#39;s. The wayward voiceover was inserted over Ellen&#39;s scene, but it is really tied to what goes down during the final rose ceremony.

Gerry hinted after his date with Leslie, going into his date with Theresa, that he had his mind made up that he would choose Leslie. He even told her, &#34;You&#39;re the one&#34;, during their overnight date. However, Gerry compartmentalized his feelings and opened himself up to the experience with Theresa, which ended up deepening his feelings for her. Given those circumstances, Gerry may tell Leslie what she wants to hear during the final rose ceremony but ultimately choose Theresa.

Leslie&#39;s voice is distinct, and viewers have heard her voice through cries already this season. Given that, and what fans heard in the trailer, Leslie likely was the heartbroken voice and will not be given the final rose. Leslie and Gerry&#39;s connection has been strong, and the pair seem connected through their love of adventure and Gerry&#39;s wanting to nuture Leslie&#39;s vulnerability. With Theresa, she and Gerry have bonded over their similar past and loss of their spouses. Moreover, Gerry has said he feels totally comfortable around Theresa.




What is coming up on The Golden Bachelor, is the final choice, which means devastation for who appears to be Leslie. Before the final rose ceremony, Leslie and Theresa will have to sit down with Gerry&#39;s daughters, who will have sharp opinions on who their dad&#39;s ultimate partner should be. Fans should buckle up for an emotional conclusion to the pioneering season.



The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.
