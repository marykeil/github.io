90 Day: The Single Life star Natalie Mordovtseva is dating Josh Weinstein on the show. Learn about his job, Instagram, and family.




Since 90 Day Fiancé alum Natalie Mordovtseva is getting serious about her relationship with Josh Weinstein from 90 Day: The Single Life, it&#39;s time to learn more about him. She is currently 38-years-old, and was engaged to Mike Youngquist during her franchise debut. Natalie moved from Ukraine to America to get married to Mike, although they split in the finale. On 90DF, Natalie seemed like a scammer, and fans still ask her to “go back home” while commenting on her Instagram posts. Natalie and Mike’s marriage in Sequim, Washington, USA was short-lived, with Natalie and Mike finally filing for divorce in 2024. When it ended, she relocated to Florida to date new men. One of these men, Josh, has lasted through the current 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.




In 90 Day: The Single Life season 2, Natalie went on a golfing date with Josh. He&#39;d managed a modeling event, which Natalie’s former prospective mate Johnny (who is also a struggling model) had taken her to. “See you in Hollywood,” Josh told Natalie, after seeing her catwalk skills, and she soon developed a crush on him. He is from Los Angeles, and was in Tampa for work when he asked her out on their first date. On the show, Josh called Natalie “intriguing” and “attractive,” but while she acted like a schoolgirl around Josh, she was shocked to discover that he had two children with a couple of women. She also had questions about why Josh wasn’t able to get into “serious” relationships with his baby mamas.

Josh is currently 42, making him four years older than Natalie. While there are undoubtedly problems with his two baby mamas, Josh seems to be a doting dad to his two kids. His older son, Jett, turned 17 in June 2023; he also has a six-year-old, Kinsley. While Natalie is a highly controversial figure in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise, she doesn&#39;t seem to have a taste for men well outside her age range, unlike other cast members of the hit reality TV show. Her soon-to-be ex-husband, Mike, is 37.



 Josh Weinstein&#39;s Job 
         

Despite some misgivings, while being filmed for the show, Natalie found herself going to Hollywood to hang out with Josh. The usually guarded Natalie opened up to him. So far, fans have watched her kiss Josh, and even sleep with him. Josh has mentioned that he is the CEO and founder of a company called Preview Models. He&#39;s also the CEO and co-founder of Cre8 Luck, which organizes luxury giveaways that involve celebs and influencers.




Josh&#39; company is best known for organizing the &#34;Preview Models Fashion Show in Hollywood, CA with Performances by Kid Ink &amp; Don Benjamin,” but it&#39;s also been associated with America’s Next Top Model. The company&#39;s representatives claim that the firm isn&#39;t an agency; they say the enterprise is a “production company,” which gets up-and-coming models in front of agents. Clients also gain access to 90DF franchise celeb Josh’s Rolodex, which includes many names, as he&#39;s been networking for years.

Josh has an acting past, just like Natalie, who appeared in several productions while she was in Kyiv. While she knows that age is not on her side if she wants to make it big in Hollywood, she understands that she still looks youthful. Natalie has modeling goals, which she might have thought Josh would help her to achieve in America. However, there&#39;s been drama between Natalie and Josh in the newest installment, indicating trouble in paradise.






 Josh Weinstein&#39;s Instagram 

 

Much of Josh&#39;s career revolves around his Instagram.

The firm&#39;s marketing materials claim that models from over a hundred cities across America have been “immersed in the entertainment industry,” thanks to Josh’s company. He has several people on his team, including film and television coaches, acting coaches, runway coaches, casting directors, and celebrity mentors. He can be found on Instagram @jweinsteinent.
