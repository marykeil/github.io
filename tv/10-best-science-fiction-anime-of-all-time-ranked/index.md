## Literature Review
The best science fiction anime feature towering mechs, frighteningly human androids, space exploration, and more. 




The best science fiction anime will not only feature but deliberate on technology, science, and related fields, which has led to the creation of new genres such as the mecha genre. However, sci-fi anime is not only limited to the piloting of giant robots, but also includes space travel, androids, and academic scientific discovery.
Some series will take a new spin on the genre, such as Dr. Stone, which alters the genius scientist archetype by placing it in a shonen landscape and structuring each episode to almost serve as a science lesson of sorts, all the while not diminishing plot value. Then, there are the mechas, which heavily carry the science fiction genre of anime, as the featured robots both allow for tremendous creative freedom and high marketability. Essentially, the science fiction anime genre revolves around this genre, with splashes of stand-out series that take more traditional routes.

 10  Psycho-Pass Is a Meditation on The Future of Justice 
An original series directed by Shiotani Naoyoshi
        

  Release Year   2012    Number of Episodes   22 (Season 1)    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll, Funimation, Hulu, Tubi, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV    
The anime Psycho-Pass, produced by Production I.G, is a science fiction series in the purest sense, as its setting and characters embody an elevated form of living when compared to the modern status quo. The world of Psycho-Pass is so advanced that humans have developed tools that can measure the psychological status of a person and dole out punishment based only on the conjecture that they will commit a crime in the near future. The series follows main characters Tsunemori Akane and Kougami Shinya, an Inspector-Enforcer duo whose jobs are to deliver such a prescribed justice, all the while navigating the nuance in this complicated future. 
With a plot built on numerous compelling twists, Psycho-Pass is a compelling watch. What keeps viewers coming back to the series though is that Psycho-Pass is a thoughtful exploration of crime and its place in Japanese society. Far from accepting the brutal dystopian world it presents, the series encourages viewers to question the overarching systems running the world. All of that easily makes Psycho-Pass rank among the best science-fcition anime, with the only thing holding it back being its lack luster follow ups.

 9  Gintama Is a Splash of Laughter In a World of Aliens 
Based on the manga by Sorachi Hideaki


 







  Release Year   2006    Number of Episodes   201 (Season 1)    Where to Stream   Crunchyroll, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video    
Although most of the best science fiction anime will take science and technology as the primary focus, Gintama, produced by Studio Sunrise, became a notable sci-fi series just by being one of the best comedy anime. Main character Sakata Gintoki doesn’t go on any grand crusades within the unique world combining Edo Period Japan with speculative alien civilizations, but the interactions between Gintoki and the latter are able to perfectly capture viewers with its world. Doing odd jobs and cracking silly jokes every episode, Gintoki elevates the anime into a prominent sci-fi series only through the hilarious premise of samurai oppressed by colonizing aliens.
Gintama is a gag comedy that does not follow any overarching narrative structure, so most episodes can be viewed as if they’re independent features.

An original series directed by Anno Hideaki


 







  Release Year   1995    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube    
Neon Genesis Evangelion is no stranger to the science fiction anime scene, as the series produced by Studio Gainax has cemented itself across multiple genres, including shonen, action, and most importantly, mecha. Despite being one of the foundational anime of the genre, the series takes the most interesting spins on robot construction.

With such a deep mystery unfolding, Evangelion follows protagonist Ikari Shinji through a perilous journey of moral reasoning, psychological navigating, and most notably, learning how to get into the robot.
With its beautiful animation, thought-provoking story, and memorable characters, Evangelion is one of the most important and influential anime series ever made.

Dense philosophy and out-there concepts collide in a story that tackles themes like depression, parental abandonment, and societal response to disasters. All of this combines to make Neon Genesis Evangelion the best science fiction anime of all time.
