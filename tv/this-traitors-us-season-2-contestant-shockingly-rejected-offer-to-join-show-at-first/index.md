# This Traitors US Season 2 Contestant Shockingly Rejected Offer To Join Show At First


## SUMMARY 



  Phaedra Parks almost passed on joining The Traitors US season 2, but her mother&#39;s encouragement convinced her to participate.   Phaedra was excited to meet Dancing With The Stars&#39; Maks Chmerkovskiy and The Bachelor&#39;s Peter Weber.   As the game intensifies, Phaedra&#39;s ability to conceal her identity from the Faithfuls may lead her to victory in The Traitors US season 2.

## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 has a cast of 21 celebrities, but one of them almost wasn&#39;t on the show because they nearly rejected the offer.




The Traitors US season 2 could&#39;ve looked very different because The Real Housewives of Atlanta and Married to Medicine star Phaedra Parks almost didn&#39;t join the show. On The Traitors US season 2, Phaedra was chosen to be one of the Traitors, along with Dan Gheesling. They then recruited Parvati Shallow. Since then, they&#39;ve murdered Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio and Marcus Jordan. However, if not for the encouragement of a very special person, Phaedra might&#39;ve said no to The Traitors US season 2 and not appeared on it at all.




In an interview with E! News shared via YouTube, Phaedra revealed that she was asked to be a cast member on The Traitors US season 1, but it didn&#39;t fit with her schedule.


 

When they called Phaedra for The Traitors US season 2, it was four days before she had to leave. Her mother asked her who was on the phone, and Phaedra explained that it was someone from Peacock asking her to be on The Traitors US. Her mom replied, &#34;That is my favorite show! You&#39;re doing it! We&#39;ll be there tomorrow! You get packed up! You&#39;re going! And you better win it!&#34; The rest is history.

 Phaedra Was Most Excited To Meet Maks On The Traitors US 
          

In regard to her fellow The Traitors US season 2 contestants, Phaedra revealed that she was the most excited to meet Dancing With The Stars professional dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy because she loves the show. She also considers herself a member of Bachelor Nation and was excited to see Peter Weber. In addition, Phaedra shared that she didn&#39;t know fellow Housewife Larsa Pippen before the show, but she knew Shereé Whitfield from The Real Housewives of Atlanta.

So far, on The Traitors US season 2, Johnny and Marcus have been murdered, while Peppermint and Maks were banished. The remaining cast members include the Traitors, consisting of Phaedra, Dan, and Parvati. In addition, Faithfuls Peter, Shereé, Larsa, Tamra Judge, MJ Javid, Janelle Pierzina, CT Tamburello, Trishelle Canatella, Kevin Kreider, John Bercow, Deontay Wilder, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Bergie Bergersen, and Sandra Diaz-Twine all remain in the game. As the game heats up, it&#39;ll be thrilling to see if the Faithfuls are able to figure out who the Traitors are in order to banish them before they themselves are murdered in the night.




It&#39;s hard to imagine The Traitors US season 2 without Phaedra as a Traitor. While Dan&#39;s name has already been mentioned as a possible Traitor during the round table by Larsa and MJ, who voted to banish him, and Parvati is about to commit a murder in plain sight, Phaedra has been hiding in the shadows. She&#39;s done a fantastic job of concealing her identity from the Faithfuls. If Phaedra continues on this path, she could win The Traitors US season 2.

The Traitors US season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
