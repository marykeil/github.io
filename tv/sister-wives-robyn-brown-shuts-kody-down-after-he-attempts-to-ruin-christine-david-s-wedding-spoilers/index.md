## Literature Review
Sister Wives&#39; Robyn Brown stops Kody Brown in his tracks as he tries to reveal the &#34;entire story&#34; about Christine Brown before her wedding to David.




Sister Wives star Robyn Brown successfully managed to stop her husband Kody Brown from sabotaging Christine Brown&#39;s wedding to David Woolley. Robyn, previously married to David Jessop, met Kody and his first wife Meri Brown at a gathering hosted by her cousin. Kody courted Robyn in Sister Wives season 1 and legally married her in December 2014 so he could adopt her kids David, Aurora, and Breanna. Kody&#39;s devotion to Robyn didn&#39;t go unnoticed by his three previous wives. The first to confirm her split with Kody was his third wife he had spiritually married. Christine announced their separation in November 2021.




Christine began dating David in 2022 after meeting him on a dating app and got married to him on October 7, 2023, but Kody is missing from the wedding guest list (via ET).


 

Along with Kody, Robyn and Meri were also not invited to witness Christine getting married to David. A trailer was shared for the upcoming Sister Wives: Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding special, which shows Robyn and Kody discussing the nuptials, where the Brown family patriarch says, &#34;I knew David and Christine were gonna get married. She made these accusations that I had...&#34; Robyn interrupts him before he can spill something shocking on camera.


 What To Expect From Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding Special 
          




&#34;Aren&#39;t we just so happy for them?&#34; Robyn asks her husband in an attempt to stop him. Kody continues what he was trying to say earlier to reveal the &#34;whole story&#34; when Robyn adds, &#34;We&#39;re just so happy for them.&#34; The wedding special is going to be a two-hour affair about the ceremony, which took place in Moab, Utah. More than 300 guests showed up to celebrate Christine and David&#39;s special day. The cameras show the couple surrounded by their loved ones at Red Cliffs Lodge with just two days left for the wedding, which features a pontoon boat and mimosas waiting to be chugged.

    

Christine reveals that she &#34;stalked&#34; David before meeting him. &#34;You said, let&#39;s meet,&#34; David responds. &#34;[And I said], &#39;Oh, god. She&#39;s aggressive,&#39;&#34; he says during his confessional. Janelle, Christine&#39;s sister wife for life, is in attendance talking about how Christine and David being &#34;openly affectionate&#34; is helping soothe the wounds that Kody inflicted on his third wife. &#34;I&#39;m excited to say I do, and he&#39;s excited to say &#39;I do&#39; to anything I want!&#34; Christine announces in front of her friends and family, which makes them erupt with laughter. Meanwhile, Meri tells the cameras that she is aware of Christine getting married but doesn&#39;t know when it is happening.




Christine knows she&#39;s met the love of her life. David is the soulmate to Christine whom Kody could never become. Christine knows she can be herself when she&#39;s with David. She doesn&#39;t need to prove anything to him and doesn&#39;t need to do things to &#34;earn&#34; his love. There are no strings attached when David says he loves her. It&#39;s the first thing she noticed about him. Christine is finally having the grand wedding that she always wanted as Sister Wives season 18 comes to an end. After having watched Christine and getting to know her better, it&#39;ll be exciting to watch her dream come true with David.



Sister Wives: Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding airs January 7 and 14 at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
