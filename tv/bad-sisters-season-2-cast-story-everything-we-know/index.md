## Literature Review
Apple&#39;s Irish black comedy Bad Sisters delivered a fair amount of gallows humor during season 1. Here&#39;s everything we know about season 2. 




The darkly comedic Apple TV Plus series Bad Sisters was a hit during its first season, and season 2 is sure to be the same with its returning cast and continuing story. Based on the Flemish series Clan, Bad Sisters follows the tight-knit Garvey sisters as they become embroiled in an insurance investigation when one of their abusive husbands dies suddenly. Noted for its brilliant characters and use of gallows humor, Bad Sisters was a surprise success for Apple TV Plus, and the Irish series found a larger audience abroad.




Bad Sisters season 1 scored high marks from critics, resulting in a rare 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, and audience reviews were almost as favorable. Apple&#39;s signature streamer has quickly distinguished itself as a legitimate destination for one-of-a-kind original content, and Bad Sisters is yet another program that fits in with Apple TV Plus&#39;s brand of shows and movies. Bad Sisters&#39; likable characters are its strongest asset. As the show moves away from its original premise, Bad Sisters season 2 will certainly continue to thrill because of the instantly relatable characters that make the series soar.

 Bad Sisters Season 2 Latest News 
          

The most recent Bad Sisters season 2 update is great news, as the show was not affected by the WGA writers&#39; strike (via Variety). Any writers in the WGA were forbidden from writing anything during the strike which brought most American productions to a halt. While Horgan had to stop working on U.S. shows, she was still allowed to work on UK-based series. The writer/actor noted, &#34;We just had to down tools on all of our U.S. projects, and yeah, I feel kind of guilty I still get to make a show in the UK.&#34; 




Despite the resolution of the WGA strike, no further updates have come regarding the status of Bad Sisters season 2, and it is unclear exactly how far along it is. With Horgan&#39;s brilliant pen behind the series, Apple TV likely won&#39;t rush the sophomore season, and instead allow it to fully form on its own. 



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023.
