## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&#39;s Kimberly Rochelle&#39;s scene with TJ Goswami which shows her yelling her lungs out is a part of the upcoming episode 21.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way is finally revealing the reason behind Kimberly Rochelle&#39;s bloodcurdling scream in season 5. Kimberly is a 30-year-old American woman from Muscle Shoals who moved to India on the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Kimberly met Tejaswi AKA TJ Goswami on a spiritual group online. She claimed to have seen him in her dreams much before she met him because she is clairvoyant. Unfortunately, Kim couldn&#39;t predict how badly her relationship would fare once she relocated to Jaipur. Kimberly couldn&#39;t get along with TJ&#39;s traditional Indian family and lashed out at TJ when anything went wrong. She came close to splitting with him, but Kimberly and TJ got married anyway.




A clip from the upcoming episode 21 shared by ExtraTV shows Kimberly getting used to her new life as a married woman in India a few months after her wedding.


 

Kimberly tells TJ to stop calling her &#34;crazy.&#34; She tells him she&#39;s acting &#34;like a wife who can&#39;t communicate&#34; with her husband, but TJ disagrees. Kimberly tells TJ that she is &#34;depressed.&#34; TJ is tired of Kimberly creating unnecessary &#34;drama&#34; and reveals he&#39;s told her several times to go back to the U.S. if she&#39;s not happy living in India. &#34;You can go anytime whenever you want,&#34; he tells her, which makes Kimberly furious. Kimberly says she wants to be with her husband, but it doesn&#39;t look like TJ even wants to be with her.

 Are Kimberly &amp; TJ Still Together In India? 
          

&#34;You want to find a new person?&#34; asks TJ and Kimberly&#39;s anger keeps escalating. TJ says he can&#39;t help her if she feels like she&#39;s in &#34;jail&#34; when she&#39;s with him. Kimberly only wants TJ to support her. She wants him to listen to her, which is what marriage is according to Kimberly. As they argue about finding a solution to Kimberly&#39;s problem, she yells at him, &#34;Maybe give me a f**king hug and say, ‘I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re f**king depressed.&#34; TJ refuses to do so. As things get more heated, they discuss their duties as husband and wife. Kimberly screams at the top of her lungs after TJ suggests they get separated.

As of November 2023, it appears as if Kimberly and TJ have indeed ended their marriage because she is back in America without him. Kimberly has revealed that she&#39;s been home since September 2023. At first, fans suspected Kimberly had flown to the U.S. to film the Tell-All, but her recent Instagram Q&amp;A session with fans revealed the resentment she has towards TJ, his family, and his country. Kimberly said she&#39;s never happy whenever she is in India. She said her life is much better now that she is not in India. Kimberly accused TJ of betraying her by not telling her how she was expected to behave like an Indian daughter-in-law.




Kimberly has even sparked new romance rumors with her recent Instagram updates. Meanwhile, TJ recently celebrated Diwali with his family, which confirms he is still in India without Kimberly. Kimberly and TJ&#39;s relationship might not see a happy ending on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. With Kimberly&#39;s shouting and screaming, TJ would also not be able to handle her temper tantrums for more than he already has. TJ&#39;s family would want him to leave Kimberly for his own well-being. Besides, Kimberly is making it look like she&#39;s happier than ever to be back home.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
