## Literature Review
Like any good crime drama, Castle made its name through its intriguing cases that kept the audience guessing the killer&#39;s identity until the end. 




Castle the TV series was not only known for the explosive chemistry of its two leads, Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) and Detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic), but also for the amazing cases that the duo solved. The cases in the series range from everyday crimes of passion to conspiracies that go all the way to the top. Regardless of the glamor, the detective, and Castle, take every case seriously, and work tirelessly to bring the criminals to justice.
The premise of the show revolves around the unlikely partnership of Castle and Beckett, as Castle is a novelist who writes murder mysteries but gets permission to shadow Beckett in her work. Though she is hesitant to let him contribute at first, he soon proves himself a valuable asset to the NYPD precinct and is vital in solving more than one murder. Though the tension between Beckett and Castle is a large part of what keeps audiences coming back for more, the chemistry is only elevated by the hard work and complex cases they find at their doorstep.

Though one of the most beloved crime procedurals of its time, rewatching Castle today reveals the issues and drama both on and off-screen. 













 








 10  Fool Me Once 
Season 2, Episode 4


 







By the second season of the show, Castle had found its footing and was starting to put out cases that pushed the boundary of anything seen on TV. In the season 2 episode, &#34;Fool Me Once&#34; the victim&#39;s identity is pinned down, but his occupation and the reality of his life are harder to pin down. At first, he seems to be a con man, then a CIA agent, then neither. It turns out that almost everyone in his life had a hand in the cons he was pulling and the secrets he was hiding, but only Castle and Beckett can uncover the motive that led to his death.





 9  Tick, Tick, Tick... &amp; Boom! 
Season 2, Episodes 17 &amp; 18
        

The two-part episode &#34;Tick, Tick, Tick...&#34; and &#34;Boom!&#34; involve a serial killer, a series of deadly explosions, and an obsession with Nikki Heat. Nikki is the book character that Castle wrote based on the real Det. Beckett. Unfortunately, the serial killer has a dangerous infatuation with the character, and then Beckett herself. This leads the killer to kidnap another agent on the case and though Beckett is put in charge of finding her, she cannot always predict what the murderer will do next. Luckily, since he loves Castle&#39;s books so much, Castle is ready to predict how the story will end.





 8  3XK 
Season 3, Episode 6
        

When a cold case is opened up by the appearance of another victim who fits the profile and signature of the Triple Killer. Castle and Beckett have to work night and day to discover the truth, but it becomes a more dangerous game than either of them could have imagined. The downfall of the episode is that Castle is too cocky, he believes that his instincts are infallible, and this leads him down the path of the wrong man. Though the real killer, Jerry Tyson (Michael Mosley), is discovered, it&#39;s not the last time the team will face him.





 7  Knockout 
Season 3, Episode 24
        

One of the longest-running plots in Castle is the investigation into the death of Beckett&#39;s mother. The work of Beckett and her team on the case up until this point comes to a head in the season 3 finale, &#34;Knockout&#34;. She soon loses herself in the chase to find her mother&#39;s killer and the number of people connected to the crime only grows. As she and Castle trace the chain of events, it leads them to a stunning realization.
The person behind her mother&#39;s death is a powerful figure, which explains why they&#39;ve been having so much trouble pining down evidence, and why so many people involved keep disappearing. Devastatingly, this search culminates in the loss of one of their own at the precinct. Even then, the killer will not stop and has every intention of continuing to target Beckett.





 6  Cuffed 
Season 4, Episode 10
        

Not only does &#34;Cuffed&#34; deliver a mesmerizing mystery, but it also has some of the best Caskett aka Castle and Beckett, moments from before they get together. The pair wake up, handcuffed together, in an unknown bunker with no memory of how they got there. They have to work together to free themselves and piece together what happened to them while Esposito (Jon Huertas) and Ryan (Seamus Dever) try and find them before it&#39;s too late. Structuring the episode in this way lends itself to being quite mysterious, especially since the case is Beckett and Castle themselves.





 5  Murder He Wrote 
Season 5, Episode 4


 







Once Beckett and Castle do get together, the series proved that it could be just as compelling even after the will-they-wont-they part of the relationship ended. In &#34;Murder He Wrote&#34;, the couple are still adjusting to their new relationship status, and decide to get away for the weekend. Unsurprisingly, murder follows them and a man falls dead into the pool of their house. Of course, the mystery-solvers can&#39;t help themselves and are pulled into joining the investigation, and work alongside the local police. Though the other officers do their best, it falls to Castle and Beckett to unravel the mystery.

 4  Target &amp; Hunt 
Season 5, Episodes 15 &amp; 16
        

Beckett&#39;s mother might be a large plot point in the series, but so is Castle&#39;s father. Though his identity was shrouded in mystery up to this point, he is revealed to be a CIA agent who helps Castle after his daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn), is kidnapped. His father&#39;s life of espionage is what causes Alexis to be kidnapped despite him doing everything he could to keep his family safe. They make a compelling pair, and though Castle has a million questions for him, they have to be put on hold until Alexis is brought back safely.





 3  The Lives Of Others 
Season 5, Episode 19
        

In a fun, satirical, but still thrilling send-up of Hitchcock&#39;s Rear Window, Castle believes he has witnessed a murder while confined to bedrest in his home, and must convince Beckett, Esposito, and Ryan to work to solve the case. Cooped up in his apartment, he becomes increasingly paranoid about the murder in the building next door, and starts to go to extreme lengths to find a piece of evidence. Even though he continues to witness incriminating events, no one will take him seriously, and he decides to take matters into his own hands. What happens then proves just how much love he and Beckett have for each other.





 2  Time Will Tell 
Season 6, Episode 5
        

Though Castle rarely delves too deeply into the supernatural, &#34;Time Will Tell&#34; deals with a killer claiming to be a time traveler with a heroic mission. The detectives are more than skeptical about his outlandish claim, but as the facts of the case become more twisted, time travel suddenly doesn&#39;t seem as out of the question. Whether the killer was truly time traveling or not still adds an interesting layer to what might have been a typical case. Beckett and Castle butt heads over the rationality of the situation, but when it counts, they&#39;re on the same team.





 1  Resurrection &amp; Reckoning 
Season 7, Episodes 14 &amp; 15


 







&#34;Resurrection&#34; and &#34;Reckoning&#34; see the return of the notorious Triple Killer, Jerry Tyson, and this time he isn&#39;t alone. He&#39;s working with Dr. Kelly Nieman (Annie Wersching), another recurring villain on the show, and they have a lot in store for Beckett and Castle. Building off Castle&#39;s kidnapping in season 7 of Castle, which revealed much about his motivations and his past, these episodes wrap up the 3XK arc, and are a reminder of how far Caskett are willing to go for each other. Everyone makes it out of the episode safely, but not without consequences.
