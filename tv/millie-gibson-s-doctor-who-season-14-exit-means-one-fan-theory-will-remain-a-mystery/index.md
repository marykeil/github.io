# Millie Gibson s Doctor Who Season 14 Exit Means One Fan Theory Will Remain A Mystery


## SUMMARY 



  The theory that Mrs. Flood is Ruby Sunday from the future is unlikely to be confirmed due to Millie Gibson leaving the show after season 1.   Doctor Who often sets up storylines over multiple seasons, so addressing the Mrs. Flood theory in one season would feel rushed and unusual for the show.   It would be out of place to bring Mrs. Flood back without Millie Gibson&#39;s presence, so Mrs. Flood&#39;s identity will likely remain a mystery.

## Literature Review

Because Millie Gibson&#39;s Ruby Sunday is leaving Doctor Who after season 14, one popular fan theory about the Christmas special will never get resolved.




Since Millie Gibson is exiting after Doctor Who season 14, one massive fan theory will probably never get the conclusion it deserves. The 2023 Christmas special, “The Church on Ruby Road,” offered the first taste of what audiences could expect of Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor and their new companion, Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday – increasing the hype for what’s to come. Additionally, the episode introduced multiple questions about the identity of Ruby’s mother, Mrs. Flood’s backstory, and whether the Goblins will return in future episodes of Doctor Who.




After the 2023 Christmas special, fans began speculating that Doctor Who’s Mrs. Flood is Ruby Sunday from the future. This would explain why she knows about the TARDIS, lives close to Ruby’s family, and acts differently after the goblins kidnap baby Ruby from the past. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely the writers will directly address this theory after the announcement that Millie Gibson will depart before Doctor Who season 15.


 The Mrs. Flood Doctor Who Theory Probably Won&#39;t Ever Be Answered 
          

With Millie Gibson leaving, the probability of the Mrs. Flood theory getting answered is slim to none. Doctor Who typically plays the long game, setting up storylines a good amount of time before they come to fruition. For instance, Bad Wolf started in Doctor Who season 1 but wouldn’t fully pay off until Doctor Who’s 50th-anniversary special. Similarly, the phrase “silence will fall” weaves in and out of the Eleventh Doctor’s storyline but doesn’t reach its climax until Doctor Who’s 2013 Christmas special. Addressing the Mrs. Flood tease in one season would seem unusual and rushed for the sci-fi show.




If Doctor Who didn’t conclude the Mrs. Flood storyline in Doctor Who season 14, it would feel out of place to confirm her as older Ruby after the companion leaves the show. There’s no reason to feature Ruby Sunday so heavily in a storyline without Millie Gibson. Additionally, it wouldn’t make sense to bring back Mrs. Flood without Ruby at least appearing briefly. After all, they are next-door neighbors with a seemingly good rapport. As such, there’s a good chance that Mrs. Flood’s identity will remain a mystery.

                  RTD&#39;s Doctor Who Season 14 Is Continuing One Of The Moffat Era&#39;s Favorite Companion Tropes   Russell T Davies and Steven Moffat both have distinct styles, but as RTD returns to Doctor Who for season 14, he&#39;s borrowing a Moffat companion trick.   



 Other Doctor Who Companions Have Only Lasted One Season 
          




While it’s sad Ruby Sunday won’t return for Doctor Who season 15, she isn’t the first companion to only last one season. During RTD’s first era, both Martha and Donna were Doctor Who companions for only one season. These two companions seemingly departed because of changes in the creative direction, though Martha&#39;s leaving also could’ve been related to actress Freema Agyeman’s filming schedule. Ruby falling in the same category as Martha and Donna could be a good sign. Both companions return a handful of times after leaving the Doctor. Taking this into consideration, Gibson’s Ruby might still appear in Doctor Who a few times after exiting as a full-time companion.
