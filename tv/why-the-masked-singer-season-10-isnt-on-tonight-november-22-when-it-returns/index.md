## Literature Review
The Masked Singer season 10 finals are about to begin, but the show won&#39;t air tonight. Find out why and when it will return for Disco Night.




The three The Masked Singer season 10 groups have completed their preliminary rounds and are about to begin their finals, but fans will have to wait a bit longer for Group A&#39;s Disco Night finals performances. The Masked Singer season 10 welcomed back host Nick Cannon, and panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger, for its milestone season. On premiere night, superstar singer Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse in one of the biggest unmaskings in the show&#39;s history.




The Masked Singer season 10 is now heading to its Group A, B, and C finals. The Group A finalists are Gazelle, S&#39;More, and Cow, while Rubber Ducky (Anthony Anderson), Diver (Tom Sandoval), and Pickle (Michael Rapaport), were unmasked. The Group B finals will feature Tiki, Sea Queen, and Husky. From that group, Royal Hen (Billie Jean King) and Hawk (Tyler Posey) were unmasked. The Group C finalists are Donut, Candelabra, and Anteater, while Hibiscus (Luann de Lesseps) and Cuddle Monster (Metta World Peace) were unmasked. The Group A finalists will perform on Disco Night, but that Masked Singer episode won&#39;t air tonight.

 Why Isnâ€™t The Masked Singer On Tonight 

 

According to a post on the Masked Singer Instagram page, the next episode won&#39;t air tonight, Wednesday, November 22. The post features a photograph of host Nick Cannon and contestant Candelabra with a caption that reads, &#34;I&#39;m bummed there&#39;s no new episode of #TheMaskedSinger this week, but all the more reason to re-watch Season 10 so far on @hulu.&#34; This delay in the schedule is most likely due to Thanksgiving, which is Thursday, November 23. Rather than air a new episode the night before the holiday, The Masked Singer will show an encore performance of the Trolls Night episode.






 When Will The Masked Singer Return? 
          

The Masked Singer will return on Wednesday, November 29 for the Group A finals. The Masked Singer Instagram bio message reads, &#34;#TheMaskedSinger Disco Night is Wednesday, November 29 on @foxtv! Catch up on previous episodes and seasons on @hulu!&#34; The Masked Singer finals will feature the return of the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell, which can be used only once throughout Groups A, B, and C. If the panelists choose to use it to save a contestant, that singer will move directly to the finale. If they don&#39;t use the bell, then two finalists will be unmasked from the group, sending the winner from that group to the finale.

The Masked Singer season 10 has been very entertaining so far. The talent is incredible, so the finals will be very exciting to watch. The final three theme nights will be Disco, Rock and Roll, and Soundtrack of My Life Nights, which are certain to have some incredible performances. It&#39;ll also be thrilling to watch the winners from each group finally compete against each other in the finale. The Masked Singer season 10 has been one of the best yet.




The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
