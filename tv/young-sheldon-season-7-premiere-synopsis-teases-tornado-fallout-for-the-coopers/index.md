## Literature Review
The official synopsis for the Young Sheldon season 7 premiere has been released, revealing what&#39;s next for the Coopers after the Medford tornado. 




CBS releases the Young Sheldon season 7 premiere synopsis, and it reveals the fallout from the recent Medford tornado. The Cooper family has gone through a lot since their story began back in 2017. George and Mary&#39;s marriage had its ups and downs, Georgie now has a daughter, and Missy and Sheldon navigated their pre-teen years. For its final year on the small screen, Young Sheldon will have a significantly shorter run with only 14 episodes.




As part of its extensive coverage of the upcoming return of several CBS scripted series, TVLine reveals pertinent information about the delayed Young Sheldon season 7 premiere. The episode picks up not long after the season 6 finale and will deal with what happens in the aftermath of the latest natural catastrophe to hit the town. Read it below:


“Half a Wiener Schnitzel and Underwear in a Tree” – News of the tornado reaches Sheldon and Mary in Germany. Also, with the Cooper house in chaos, Missy steps up.



 What&#39;s In Store For Sheldon &amp; His Family In Young Sheldon Season 7 
          

For years, Young Sheldon slowly became a true family sitcom, and it is fully embracing that in season 7 from the get-go. While the synopsis doesn&#39;t get into specifics on what actually happens in the episode, the focus is still on the overall storyline instead of Sheldon&#39;s personal arc, which has been the case for quite a while now. Instead of mainly tackling his time in Germany, as it will be vital to his future at Caltech and Pasadena, the outing zeroes in on how he and Mary react to the tragedy that hit Medford.




The Young Sheldon season 6 finale set up many storylines that are expected to play out in season 7. For starters, Georgie and Mandy&#39;s wedding will receive plenty of focus. While The Big Bang Theory canon reveals that they will eventually break up, Young Sheldon must tackle their love story in a way that will best serve its own storytelling. That means that a satisfying ending to their romance is imperative; otherwise, it opens itself up to backlash. Secondly, George&#39;s cheating scandal and eventual death are also two big plot points dictated by The Big Bang Theory that could play out in season 7.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Hints At An Unexpected Character Return   A brand new Young Sheldon season 7 promo hints at the unexpected return of a divisive character that will make the Coopers&#39; lives a bit complicated.     

Finally, Sheldon&#39;s transition from Medford to Pasadena will likely be included before Young Sheldon ends with a special one-hour finale on May 16. Co-creator Chuck Lorre confirmed that the prequel will follow the boy genius until he&#39;s 15 years old, which means that he will already be in California for quite some time when the spinoff wraps up its run. How explicit it will be to highlighting its ties to The Big Bang Theory is currently uncertain, but expect that some homages will be included.






Young Sheldon season 7 premieres on Thursday, February 15.
