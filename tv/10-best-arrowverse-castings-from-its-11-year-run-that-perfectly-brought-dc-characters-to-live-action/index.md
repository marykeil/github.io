## Literature Review
Throughout more than a decade, the Arrowverse brought amazing DC characters to live-action with some of the best casting in superhero adaptations.




Some Arrowverse castings over the shared TV universe&#39;s historical 11-year run brought to life DC Comics characters to great results. The Arrowverse started in 2012 with Arrow. In the series&#39; second season, Grant Gustin would debut as Barry Allen opposite Stephen Amell&#39;s Oliver Queen, setting up the arrival of The Flash in the following year. The Arrowverse would grow exponentially from the relatively low stakes of Arrow season 1, with the DC TV universe becoming more like the comics as it grew, which helped the Arrowverse continue popular after 11 years.
Following an 11-year run that included the Arrowverse&#39;s six main series — Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, DC&#39;s Legends of Tomorrow, Batwoman, and Black Lightning — the shared DC TV universe ended with The Flash season 9 in 2023. Over its life, the Arrowverse brought several iconic DC Comics characters to the small screen. While there are some harsh realities to rewatching the Arrowverse now that it has ended, hardly any of them come from the universe&#39;s casting. The Arrowverse knew how to get the right actors to ensure the DC universe would succeed, and here are the ten best Arrowverse castings that perfectly brought DC characters to live-action.
            
 
 10 Ways The Arrowverse&#39;s Ending Is Better Than The DCEU’s 
The Arrowverse and the DCEU have come to an end; however, the DC TV universe had a better ending than the movie universe due to some major factors.













 








 10  David Harewood Was The Ideal Martian Manhunter 
Supergirl
        

While Supergirl was the star of her own series, Kara Danvers had the company of one of the founders of the Justice League from the comics throughout Supergirl&#39;s six seasons. David Harewood gave life to Martian Manhunter in the series, with the actor being able to embody the character&#39;s complexity perfectly. Supergirl&#39;s version of Martian Manhunter was every ounce as compassionate as the character is known to be in the comics. The hero was also very powerful, with Harewood&#39;s Martian Manhunter being a great mentor for Kara.





 9  Matt Letscher Did Right By The Reverse-Flash In Little Time 
The Flash &amp; Legends Of Tomorrow
        

Matt Letscher was the face behind the Arrowverse&#39;s Reverse-Flash, aka Eobard Thawne. While the actor was responsible for playing The Flash&#39;s greatest villain, Letscher shared the role with Tom Cavanagh, and as the other actor was a series regular on The Flash, Letscher ended up not appearing in the Arrowverse as much as he should have. Still, whenever he came back as Reverse-Flash, Letscher immediately raised the stakes for the universe. Besides The Flash, Letscher&#39;s Reverse-Flash played a major role in making Legends of Tomorrow season 2 one of the series&#39; best.
            
 
 10 Most Brutal Deaths In All 9 Seasons Of The Flash 
As the Arrowverse&#39;s longest series, Grant Gustin&#39;s The Flash featured many deaths over its nine seasons, and some of them were particularly brutal.









 8  Colton Haynes Brought The Grit As Roy Harper 
Arrow
        

Colton Haynes is another actor who was not in the Arrowverse as much as fans wanted him to, but that was due to a personal decision by the actor. When he was onscreen, Haynes showed why his Roy Harper was sorely missed whenever he went without appearing for seasons of Arrow. Like in the comics, Haynes managed to portray Roy Harper&#39;s issues with his self-image and the character&#39;s short temper but big heart well. Roy was part of Arrow&#39;s best seasons, with the show thriving when Green Arrow and Arsenal went on missions together to save Starling City through the use of force.





 7  Manu Bennet Was Perfectly Intimidating As Deathstroke 
Arrow
        

Manu Bennet&#39;s Deathstroke sported a low-budget version of the costume that the character is known to have in the comics. That issue aside, Bennet&#39;s take on Deathstroke led to some of the Arrowverse&#39;s best and most chilling scenes. Slade Wilson was not someone to play with, and the villain showed that by murdering Oliver Queen&#39;s loved ones, including his mother, in a quest for revenge. Seeing Slade slowly fall out with Oliver in Arrow&#39;s flashbacks while Deathstroke made the hero&#39;s life miserable in the present led to Arrow season 2 being seen by many as the series&#39; best.





 6  Tom Cavanagh Pulled Off Playing Several Versions Of The Same Character 
The Flash
        

While it is true that Harrison Wells was an original creation for The Flash, Cavanagh deserves a spot on the list for having perfectly brought to life countless versions of the new DC character, as well as the iconic villain Reverse-Flash. Cavanagh was equal parts a great mentor and an intimidating villain in The Flash season 1, with the actor going on to make every new version of Harrison Wells that would pop up over The Flash&#39;s nine seasons feel unique. Cavanagh&#39;s performances gave The Flash a consistently great element for its entire run.
            
 
 10 Overlooked Positives Of Watching The Flash&#39;s Impressive 9 Season Run Now That It&#39;s Over 
Grant Gustin&#39;s The Flash might have had its problems over the years; however, the Arrowverse series held many positives throughout its nine seasons.









 5  Matt Ryan Was The Pitch-Perfect Constantine 
Constantine, Arrow &amp; Legends Of Tomorrow
        

While NBC&#39;s Constantine series was not created for the Arrowverse, Matt Ryan was so good as DC&#39;s resident Demonologist that he had to be brought back to play the character after his show got canceled after just one season. With a guest role in Arrow and a longer stint in Legends of Tomorrow, Ryan showed that his casting as Constantine stands as one of the best in superhero media. Matt Ryan became synonymous with John Constantine in the eyes of many, looking and acting like the character had stepped right off of the page onto the screen. Ryan would also become the voice actor for Constantine in multiple DC animated movies.





 4  Tyler Hoechlin Sits Among The Best Versions Of Superman 
Supergirl, Superman &amp; Lois
        

Tyler Hoechlin&#39;s casting as Superman made waves, giving the Arrowverse its own Man of Steel. Hoechlin was great in his Supergirl appearances, and seeing him interact with other heroes in the Arrowverse&#39;s crossovers was one of the DC TV universe&#39;s highlights. While Hoechlin showed a lot of promise in the Arrowverse, it was not until Superman &amp; Lois — which has been retconned into existing on another Earth — that Hoechlin became regarded as one of the best live-action portrayals of Superman. The actor perfectly balances the Clark Kent and Superman sides of the character, creating one of the most emotional and exciting versions of the hero.





 3  Melissa Benoist Showed Supergirl’s Might 
Supergirl


 







Melissa Benoist showed the world that Supergirl can be just as great as her more famous cousin if given the chance. Benoist&#39;s time as the Girl of Steel featured the hero going up against some of the Arrowverse&#39;s toughest villains, such as Lex Luthor and Reign. Benoist herself was a breath of fresh air to the universe, with the actress making the universe&#39;s Trinity — with Green Arrow and The Flash — finally feel complete. Benoist was charming, funny, and tough as Supergirl, laying the path for what James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe could do with the character in the announced Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow movie.





 2  Stephen Amell&#39;s Green Arrow Was The Arrowverse&#39;s Iron Man 
Arrow


 







Stephen Amell&#39;s casting as Oliver Queen in Arrow was as important to the Arrowverse as Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark in Iron Man was for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Amell&#39;s series as Green Arrow would serve as the main show in the Arrowverse, with Oliver Queen becoming the leader of the ever-expanding roster of heroes in the Arrowverse. Seeing the Arrowverse grow from Arrow&#39;s early days of realism into a full comic book universe on the small screen only worked because Amell&#39;s Oliver Queen was a compelling character to watch as he learned that the world was very different from what he thought.
While Stephen Amell&#39;s Oliver Queen was perfect for the Arrowverse, the more Batman-like take on the character from Arrow diverted from the lighter Green Arrow from the comics. Due to that, Justin Hartley was a more comic book-accurate Green Arrow in Smallville. 






 1  Grant Gustin Is Arguably DC&#39;s Best Live-Action Flash 
The Flash


 







Finally, Grant Gustin playing Barry Allen, aka The Flash, was the best casting decision the Arrowverse ever made. Gustin&#39;s The Flash quickly grew to become the Arrowverse&#39;s most popular series, making the multiverse a hit concept among superhero movies and shows, introducing some of the Arrowverse&#39;s best villains, and more. Gustin was perfect as Barry Allen, delivering a charming and emotional take on the character that remained strong from start to finish. That led to Gustin becoming the most popular live-action Flash, with many DC fans mad that the DCEU&#39;s The Flash movie snubbed the actor. It was fitting that Gustin concluded the Arrowverse with The Flash season 9.
