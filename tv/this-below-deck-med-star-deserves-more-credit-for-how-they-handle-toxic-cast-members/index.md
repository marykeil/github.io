## Literature Review
Below Deck Med season 8 has been full of drama. But there&#39;s one particular cast member who&#39;s being praised for how they&#39;re handling the situation.




Jessika Asai may be new to Below Deck Mediterranean, but she&#39;s already being applauded for how she&#39;s dealing with a lot of the drama caused by her fellow yachties. While Kyle Viljoen and Natalya Scudder returned, there were several new crew members who signed on for the latest charter season, including Tumi Mhlongo, Jessika, Ruan Irving, Luka Brunton, Lara Du Preez, Haleigh Gorman, Max Salvador and Jack Luby. Drama is always to be expected on a Bravo reality show, and Below Deck Med season 8 hasn&#39;t been any different, with Kyle, Natalya and Tumi at the center of a lot of the toxicity on board the Mustique.




It can&#39;t always be easy for some of the other Below Deck Med season 8 stars to put up with all of that nonsense. Jessika is being praised for how she&#39;s handling the drama. HavocAffinity took to Reddit to proclaim that Jessika is &#34;more intelligent than people give her credit for.&#34; One example that the fan brought up was how Jessika had to accept Kyle&#39;s &#34;fake&#34; apology because &#34;what choice did she have?&#34; The Reddit thread had a ton of replies, mostly defending Jessika and calling out the behavior of Kyle and others causing stress for everyone on board.


 Jessika Asai&#39;s Below Deck Med Storyline Explained 
          

Several Below Deck fans spotted the differences between Kyle and Jessika, with Macgruff and ArtisticBrilliant491 noting that the former is a &#34;bully&#34; and &#34;drama queen&#34; while the latter is &#34;100% wise&#34; and far more emotionally intelligent than Kyle. At one point, Jessika mentioned that she doesn&#39;t handle men yelling at her well, so when things like that happen on the Mustique, she might be doing whatever she can to tamp down the situation, which could explain her apology to Kyle. Heatuponheat made a great observation that Jessika might not be assertive, but she&#39;s still &#34;stealthily working everyone out&#34; because she&#39;s a &#34;quiet observer.&#34;

According to LetshearitforNY, Jessika might not have ever &#34;worked in a toxic environment before.&#34; That particular experience she brought with her to the Mustique likely shaped her perception of how to handle the toxicity and drama. Jessika has only been in the yachting industry for less than five years, so it&#39;s unfortunate that she had to walk into this environment and come face to face with the likes of Kyle, Natalya and Tumi.


 

Having said that, it&#39;s not like Jessika&#39;s own storyline has been devoid of any drama. After Luka and Natalya&#39;s fling fizzled out, Luka started making moves on Jessika. The two of them likely wouldn&#39;t work out in the end, even if they did decide to be in a relationship with each other. Despite Natalya&#39;s early exit from Below Deck Med and Kyle&#39;s uncertain future, there are still plenty of opportunities for more scandal and intrigue in the weeks to come.




Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
