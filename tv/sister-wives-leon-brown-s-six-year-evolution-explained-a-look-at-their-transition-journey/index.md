Leon admitted that they “definitely” did not have almost any of their “s**t figured out” while making the post, but they wanted their followers to know that they were trans. They confirmed their name was Leon or Leo because they loved both names and that their pronouns were “they/them.”

Leon shared a photo of them standing in a doorframe wearing brown shorts with brown sandals and a loose white shirt while playing with their hair. Leon wrote about the “first time” they knew they weren’t a girl. They were pretty young and “unfortunately” grew up in a context that was “incredibly gendered and restrictive.” They admitted that they continued to socialize as a girl and later a woman. Now, they were finally ready to share their “favorite self” with the world. This self of Leon was “incredibly genderqueer, trans, and unapologetic.” Leon wrote that being queer and trans were definitely some of their favorite parts of themselves.




Still, there were “so many things” they were learning in the process, such as loving themselves. “Here’s to me getting to know myself, share myself,” they added in the caption. Leon hoped to continually evolve to be the person they were meant to be and be their favorite self “in all contexts.&#34; Leon also warned that those who were unwilling to use their new name or address them by their correct pronouns did not need to speak to or about them.

 How Was Leon&#39;s Relationship With Meri &amp; Kody Brown In 2023? 
         

Leon met Audrey while attending Westminster College. Leon had a huge crush on Audrey for over a year before they started dating. They knew that Audrey was going to be the one. Leon got married to Audrey in October 2022. The wedding took place at a courthouse in Colorado Springs. Leon and Audrey had been engaged since January 2019 at the Women&#39;s March in Washington, D.C. They had just started dating when they came to the event for the first time in 2017, and it was a special occasion for Leon to propose to Audrey there. According to InTouch, neither Kody nor Meri attended Leon’s wedding.

Meri was visiting Disneyland on October 29, 2022. Kody and Leon were estranged because Kody had claimed, “Leon, Paedon, Dayton, Aurora, Breanna, they don’t fit in well with the rest of the family,” while adding that not all of his kids were cohesive with the family. In August 2023, a source told UsSun that Kody did not support Leon’s transition and that he was “actually disgusted by it.” According to them, Kody was telling his close friends that Leon was a “new person” and he didn’t know who the person was. Kody allegedly declared, “This is not the little girl that I raised”




Kody did not want to have a relationship with Leon anymore. This also affected Kody’s relationship with Meri since, Leon being her only child, Meri was going to pick Leon over Kody “every day.” Meanwhile, the Sister Wives star reunited with Leon at Gwendlyn Brown&#39;s wedding to Beatriz Queiroz in July 2023. The mom and her only child had posed for a sweet selfie together which Meri posted on Instagram.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
