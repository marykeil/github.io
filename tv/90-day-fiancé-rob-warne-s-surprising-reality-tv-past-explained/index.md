## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 is not the first reality show that Rob Warne has starred in. He has a surprising reality TV past which doesn&#39;t include Sophie.




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne was on a different reality TV show before appearing in season 10 with Sophie Sierra. Rob is a 32-year-old from Los Angeles who began dating Sophie, 23, from London sometime in 2019. Sophie grew up rich thanks to her wealthy grandfather. After growing up, Sophie became a social media content creator and model. Rob had a humble upbringing compared to Sophie. As per Sophie, he did “little odd jobs here and there” for work. She was frustrated because Rob did not have a steady career.




When Sophie moved into Rob’s Inglewood apartment, fans saw that Rob didn’t have a bathroom inside his house. Sophie expected Rob’s living situation to be temporary, but, it didn’t seem like Rob had any intentions of moving out. Sophie finally moved out of Rob’s house when she caught him online cheating on her. Rob was using an app to receive disgusting videos from other women. Rob had not been loyal to Sophie throughout the relationship, even though they were about to get married within three months. However, Rob could already be planning to audition for his next reality show with a new partner now that Sophie has split with him.

Rob may have said that he’s a “jack of all trades” during season 10, episode 1, but he seems to be keen on launching a career as a movie or TV star. Since his Love Connection stint didn’t grab eyeballs, Rob may have thought a romance with a British woman would launch him into instant stardom if they applied to be on 90 Day Fiancé. Rob did end up becoming popular overnight, but thanks to all the wrong reasons. He’s more of a franchise villain now than a hero. However, it never stopped the likes of Angela Deem and Big Ed Brown from becoming famous.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
