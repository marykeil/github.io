## Literature Review

Seth MacFarlane confirms that he&#39;s &#34;working on&#34; The Orville season 4, but is it already too late for the sci-fi comedy-drama to return to Hulu?




Seth MacFarlane has revealed that he&#39;s &#34;working on&#34; bringing back The Orville for season 4, but it may already be too late for the sci-fi comedy drama. The Orville&#39;s season 3 finale, appropriately titled &#34;Future Unknown&#34;, dropped on Hulu back in August 2022. Since then, there have been cautiously optimistic updates from creator and star Seth MacFarlane and other members of the cast. However, The Orville remains in limbo, but crucially, there hasn&#39;t been an official cancelation for the show, either.




The latest update on The Orville from Seth MacFarlane came in an interview on Logically Speaking. MacFarlane stated that “We’re working on it”. However, this doesn&#39;t mean that The Orville has been renewed for season 4, it means that discussions are ongoing. While promoting Peacock&#39;s Ted show, Scott Grimes and Seth MacFarlane confirmed that they&#39;re still talking about bringing back The Orville, but it&#39;s a complicated process. The multiple complications involved in bringing back The Orville for season 4 mean that it may already be too late for Captain Ed Mercer (Seth MacFarlane) and the crew to return.

                  The Orville Season 4: Will It Happen? Everything We Know   With The Orville&#39;s future in doubt following the season 3 finale, here&#39;s everything we know about season 4 of Seth MacFarlane&#39;s sci-fi comedy-drama.   


 Why The Orville Season 4 Is Taking So Long To Be Confirmed 
          




In an interview with The Wrap, Seth MacFarlane and Scott Grimes gave a complicated update about The Orville. While MacFarlane reiterated that there&#39;s no &#34;official death certificate&#34; for The Orville, he also made reference to there being &#34;too many factors&#34;. These factors are likely to hold up progress on The Orville season 4, especially as the show&#39;s stars were all released from their contracts at the end of season 3. Scott Grimes also made reference to &#34;building the stuff again&#34;, because the sets for The Orville were taken down when season 3 wrapped.

Given how things were left behind the scenes at the end of The Orville season 3, it&#39;s a more difficult process to remount the show than it would be if the actors were still under contract and the sets were still standing. These will be major factors in the ongoing discussions about the future of The Orville, especially as Disney will be looking to Seth MacFarlane to prove that the show is worth the investment. There&#39;s a demonstrable audience for The Orville, which will aid negotiation, but viewer habits can be fickle, meaning that they may only be willing to wait so long.






 The Longer The Orville Season 4 Takes, The Harder It&#39;ll Be To Bring Back 
         

17 months after The Orville season 3 ended, even the most dedicated fan will be starting to lose hope for the future of the show. The longer the wait for The Orville season 4, the harder it will be to bring it back and make an impact. Even if The Orville is renewed and starts shooting later in 2024, it won&#39;t make it to screens until at least 2025. There&#39;s so much content released on streaming services each week that it could be hard for The Orville to stand out after being away for three years or more.

It&#39;s also worth remembering that The Orville is a job for actors, screenwriters, and production staff. If that job is no longer available, they&#39;ll find another one, meaning that nobody involved with The Orville is sitting around waiting for the renewal. Cast and crew are out working on new TV shows and movies, and the longer the gap between The Orville seasons 3 and 4, the harder it will be to convince those creatives to turn their back on their current jobs.




                  The Orville Can&#39;t End Until This Star Trek Star Makes A Guest Appearance   Many Star Trek actors have had cameo appearances on The Orville, but there&#39;s still one who needs to appear before Seth MacFarlane&#39;s sci-fi show ends.   



 The Orville Season 4 Delays Could Have Cost The Show Its Co-Star 
         

It appears that Adrianne Palicki won&#39;t be in The Orville season 4, as she told Michael Rosenbaum on the Inside of You podcast that she was &#34;no longer doing that.&#34; Elaborating further, Palicki discussed how difficult The Orville was to shoot, and even revealed that the long gaps between seasons impacted the actors&#39; finances. Using J. Lee, who plays Lt. Commander John LaMarr in The Orville as an example, Palicki said:


At one point, we were like we have to fight the studio to give us a holding fee or something. J. Lee was eating saltines and gatorade at one point because we just couldn’t afford anything. It was horrible.”





Adrianne Palicki had previously told Den of Geek that she would love her character Kelly Grayson to be the new captain in The Orville season 4. Palicki&#39;s new comments mark a clear change in her outlook on returning to The Orville. It seems likely that Adrianne Palicki has grown tired of waiting for The Orville season 4, and is now looking for work elsewhere. As the wait gets longer and longer, it remains to be seen if other members of The Orville cast will similarly abandon hope of returning, or if a deal can be struck to bring back Adrianne Palicki as Kelly Grayson in season 4.



All three seasons of The Orville are streaming now on Hulu and Disney&#43;.




              The Orville  Created by Seth McFarlane and set in the 25th century, The Orville follows the crew of the titular ship and its captain, Ed Mercer (McFarlane) as they explore the galaxy. Inspired by Star Trek, it also spoofs the sci-fi classic, taking a comedic approach to its serialized story and science-fiction premise. Adrianne Palicki, Penny Johnson Jerald, and Scott Grimes star alongside McFarlane as part of an ensemble cast.
