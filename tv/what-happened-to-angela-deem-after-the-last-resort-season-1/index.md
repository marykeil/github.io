## Literature Review
Angela Deem is no longer a monster after appearing in 90 Day: The Last Resort. The franchise villain has transformed herself to become a fan-favorite.




Angela Deem was last seen in 90 Day: The Last Resort and here’s how shockingly different her life has been after season 1. Angela is a 56-year-old woman from Georgia, while Michael Ilesanmi is her 34-year-old husband from Nigeria. Angela and Michael met on Facebook DMs, and she documented her first trip to his country on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 2. The couple fought about Michael’s infidelity and Angela’s inability to bear him children. They got married, regardless, in January 2020 right before the COVID-19 pandemic happened. Angela underwent weight-loss surgery and lost over 100 pounds while waiting for Michael’s visa to be approved.




However, Michael cheated on Angela with a much younger woman he met on Instagram. Angela decided she would divorce Michael but attended the 90 Day: The Last Resort to give him one last chance. Angela and Michael were perhaps the least troubled couple on set despite the cheating scandal. Angela revealed that Michael’s mother’s death had brought them together. He appreciated Angela helping him through the difficult times and promised to be a better husband to the American woman. Angela, who had brought divorce papers to the resort, tore them up and told Michael she wanted to start a new journey on the right foot.

 Angela Is No Longer The Monster She Used To Be 
          

Angela had an explosive start on 90 Day: the Last Resort. She got into a heated argument with Liz Woods by accusing her of not defending Big Ed Brown during his fight with Kelly Brown. Angela wanted to stick up for Ed, who had cheated during a couple’s therapy game. She got angry and repeatedly called Liz a “b***h” by getting in her face and aggressively yelling at her. Angela and Liz buried the hatchet later in the season. Since then, Angela has taken on the role of a motherly figure at the Resort. She didn’t fight with Michael and instead tore up her divorce papers to give their love another chance.




The time she spent with the girls on the show was fun to watch and so was the scene with Michael and Angela’s new battery-operated pink friend. Moreover, Angela took baby steps in the right direction during her therapy sessions. She learned to manage her anger and will probably impress fans even more with her new personality if she manages to stick to it.

Angela was never one to make cast members her friends when she first appeared on-screen. Angela and Usman Umar went head-to-head in an explosive fight. Avery Mills claimed Angela allegedly attacked her mom Terri at a Tell-All. Angela even asked Yara Zaya, &#34;Why don&#39;t you sit me down, b***h?&#34; when Yara asked her to calm down at a recent reunion. However, Yara and Angela were friendly while filming 90 Day: The Last Resort as if nothing had happened between them at all. Kalani even posted an Instagram story where she praised her “favorite human” Angela for being “fiercely protective” of her people.






 Fans Suspect Michael Is In America With Angela 

 

Angela is now in the news for her Instagram videos and TikTok Lives with Michael. While the content proves that Angela and Michael have reunited, fans also believe Michael is finally in the U.S. after getting his visa. The 90 Day: The Last Resort couple hasn’t confirmed their location. They could very well be in Nigeria where Angela has gone to meet Michael. Still, viewers want Angela and Michael to work out as a couple because of everything they’ve overcome in their past. Even if Michael is not in America, his being together and happy with Angela is a great sign and means that couples therapy worked its charm.
