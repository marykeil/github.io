# 90 Day Fiancé Why Yohan &amp; Danieles Relationship Might Not Survive


## SUMMARY 



  Daniele plans to divorce Yohan after discovering his multiple affairs with other women, putting their marriage in jeopardy.   Yohan&#39;s motives for marrying Daniele were questionable, as he wanted a green card and relied on her financially without contributing himself.   Daniele&#39;s controlling tendencies and their significant age difference highlight the mismatched and chaotic nature of their relationship, making it unlikely to last.

## Literature Review
Daniele and Yohan&#39;s love has faced a lot of hurdles on the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, and there are signs their relationship may not survive. 




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Daniele Gates and Yohan Geronio are showing signs their relationship may not survive. Daniele has seemingly had enough of her husband and claimed she would file for divorce during the season 5 finale Tell All. TLC first introduced thes couple in 90 Day Fiancé: Love Paradise Season 2, and, despite their 10-year age difference, Daniele and Yohan have been trying to work on their relationship. Daniele and Yohan married after only 5 months together, only for Daniele to move to the Dominican Republic, a move Yohan didn&#39;t see coming.




Daniele and Yohan&#39;s problems began way before they got married. Their relationship has leaned more on lust at first sight rather than love, and they ignored many of their glaring issues. Therefore, looking at all the problems they have weathered throughout and all the warnings she ignored from her friends about this marriage, this relationship might not survive another storm.

 Yohan Has Many Mistresses 
          

Daniele stated that she recently found out that Yohan cheated on her with multiple women. Not only did another woman DM her, indicating she had been in a relationship with Yohan, but she also found enough evidence on his computer of six other women who had been involved with her husband. During the 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way Tell All, Daniele told host Shaun Robinson that she suspected Yohan had hooked up with &#34;probably close to like 50 or 60&#34; women. Their marriage seems to be at risk of total failure following the recent mistress reveal.




Daniele swore she would divorce Yohan after the Tell All, where she came prepared with all the receipts about his infidelity. However, Daniele still has Yohan&#39;s name tattooed on her arm and follows him on Instagram. There is no evidence to suggest the couple is together based on their social networks since they no longer have any other pictures on their pages. Should they decide to give their relationship another try, however, it probably will not survive.



 There Are Clues That Yohan Might Be A User 
          

When Daniele and Yohan got married, he looked forward to moving to the United States. However, Daniele informed him she would be moving to the Dominican Republic without discussing it first, and he was clearly upset. Yohan&#39;s reason for marrying Daniel was to get a green card, claiming he didn&#39;t get to enjoy the life she promised him. Over time, their relationship got stressful, with Daniele complaining about paying for all the expenses in their house with zero contributions from Yohan. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Yohan had been removing money from Daniele&#39;s account without informing her.






 Daniele&#39;s Controlling Tendencies 
          

Daniele and Yohan have nothing in common. Not only is their faith different, but also the couple has a huge and noticeable age difference. Daniele is way older than Yohan, and each seems to be at a different point in their lives. She has lived most of her life, had a child, and experienced a life as a single woman before marrying Yohan.

Daniele has also constantly talked about her sex escapades with Yohan and how she pays for his expenses, which paints him as her toyboy. Daniele and Yohan&#39;s relationship in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way has been chaotic. Only time will tell if their marriage will stand the test of time, but there are too many red flags for them to keep going.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way is available for streaming on TLC and Discovery&#43;.
