 Eric André Talks New Comedy Special &amp; The Eric Andre Show 
         

Screen Rant: I love the special, man. I love your comedy. It&#39;s outrageous and it&#39;s tons of fun. Now with just finishing season 6 of The Eric Andre Show, how do you determine what material you&#39;re going to use for the show versus what goes into the special?


Eric André: The show you can do way more because you have a way bigger budget, way more resources. I don&#39;t have a big budget, but I have a way bigger budget than the live show and I have more resources. And things can exist in a closeup and you can do a ton of stuff with editing. But the live show, when you&#39;re on stage, it&#39;s like one giant wide shot and things that are subtle or dependent on a closeup or some nuanced, subtle thing, they&#39;re not going to translate to a rowdy drunken audience. And also they&#39;re standing room rock venues. Comedy is best typically experienced seated. You don&#39;t watch TV standing up, so you got to treat it like a rock show more than a...





Like a comedy special.


Eric André: Comedy show. So the gags have to be bombastic and loud and interactive. You got to keep the audience&#39;s attention. And I&#39;m proud to say that on our first season&#39;s tour, this is like 10 years ago, a mosh pit broke out during the show. And I think I&#39;m the only comedy show in history, I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m the only comedy show in history, that had a mosh pit during the comedy show.


That&#39;s official. You were the only comedy in history with a mosh pit, that&#39;s official. My buddy Junior&#39;s your biggest fan, and he wants to know if there&#39;s ever going to be a special with all the footage that never made it to an episode.


Eric André: I&#39;ve thought about that or putting out bizarro cuts or extended cuts. But we put the best of the best gags in there. We got there through a lot of painful editing sessions and we get to the final result for a reason. So I&#39;d rather let the mystery remain. I also don&#39;t even know where that footage is. We&#39;ve lost hard drives and I&#39;ve tried to get old footage just like music tracks from a bit that we did on the show years ago. The production company doesn&#39;t even have them. So I think a lot of that footage is lost forever. But I don&#39;t think so.





Right. Comedy&#39;s in somewhat of a controversial medium now with many veteran comics claiming they can&#39;t be funny. But you and many others do not seem to have a problem. Are they right or are they just not funny anymore?


Eric André: It&#39;s hard to say because I&#39;m not sure specifically who you&#39;re referring to, but I don&#39;t know. People say, &#34;Oh, people are offended by everything. You can&#39;t say anything.&#34; But people have always been offended by stuff and just, I don&#39;t know, say whatever you want. You can&#39;t live your life worrying about whether you&#39;re going to offend people. I think Ricky Gervais said the best thing.
I wish this was my quote, this is his quote. It goes, &#34;Just because people are offended doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re in the right. There&#39;s people that are offended by gay marriage and interracial marriage. That doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re right.&#34; So offensiveness, you&#39;re responsible for your own reaction and you&#39;re not necessarily on the path of righteousness just because you&#39;re clutching your pearls.





I&#39;m with that. I&#39;m with that. Hey, yo, is Season 7 happening or not?


Eric André: I can neither confirm nor deny.


All right. Now, you&#39;ve always had these insane guests on your show. Is there someone you&#39;ve been trying to get that&#39;s impossible to get that&#39;s like your dream guest?


Eric André: Bill Cosby.


Fair answer. Fair answer. Is there a stunt that was either too dangerous or too far that couldn&#39;t happen?


Eric André: Oh, all the time, man. I always get my heart broken. I try to do this thing. I was going to be in a wheelchair all bandaged up and I was going to wheelchair down an escalator, like three stories and fall heads over heels down an escalator in a mall. And I was talked out of that. I was talked out of that. I was going to bash a bottle over my face during my standup special. I was talked out of that as well.


Wow, that&#39;s crazy. Now, what would be your dream prank/skit, if anything were on the table with no restrictions at all?





Eric André: Dream prank?


Mm-hmm.


Eric André: I want to drag a dead horse out of the ocean.


Yeah? There you go. Now you seem so fearless and unfazed by all the stunts you do. What does make you nervous and is there something you wouldn&#39;t do?


Eric André: I&#39;m afraid of the dark. I have a hard time sleeping by myself in my house, so that makes me nervous. And what was the other question?


Is there anything you wouldn&#39;t do?


Eric André: I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m like the John Waters saying where there&#39;s good/bad taste and there&#39;s bad/bad taste. I try to figure out what the good/bad taste is. I don&#39;t always nail it, but.


What&#39;s your favorite guest or favorite memory from the show?


Eric André: Favorite guest? Favorite guest is Chet Hanks.


There you go.


Eric André: He&#39;s fucking pissed at me. I don&#39;t even know why. I can&#39;t even remember why. He&#39;s still pissed at me.





For real?


Eric André: I don&#39;t even remember. Yeah, he was just on a red carpet the other day and he&#39;s like, &#34;Fuck Eric Andre, he sucks.&#34; I was like, &#34;Wait, what?&#34; I can&#39;t even remember what I did.
