# 8 Voice Actors That Also Played Their Characters In Live-Action


## SUMMARY 


 Voice actors who deliver strong performances in animated shows or movies are sometimes chosen to reprise their roles in live-action adaptations. 
 Some voice actors play the same character in both the animated and live-action versions, either expanding the character&#39;s role or making a cameo appearance. 
 The live-action adaptations may differ in style and tone from their animated counterparts, but having the same voice actor brings continuity and familiarity to the character.

## Literature Review
Voice actors sometimes reprise their roles in live-action continuations or remakes, in the form of cameos or extended roles in the show or movie.




Suffice it to say, there are a lot of live-action adaptations of animated movies and TV shows today. In a few unique cases, a character&#39;s original voice actor is invited to play the same character in live-action. Some noteworthy actors are set to reprise their roles in remakes of movies as recent as Moana and How to Train Your Dragon. When voice actors give a strong performance in an animated show or movie, producers are unsurprisingly eager to include them in a live-action remake, sequel, or spinoff.
The characters in question may have a small role in an animated property with their character being expanded in the live-action rendition. Alternatively, an actor famous for voicing a certain character could be invited to make a cameo as that character in a newer live-action movie or TV show. However, in some very rare cases, the two properties have nothing to do with each other. Yet an actor, by intention or coincidence, ends up playing two different versions of the same character in completely different stories.




 8  Katee Sackhoff (Bo-Katan Kryze) 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008-2020) &amp; The Mandalorian (2019-Present)




The character of Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) was first introduced to the Star Wars fandom in Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 4. Bo-Katan is the rogue sister of Satine, the ruling Duchess of Mandalore. She is so opposed to her sister&#39;s rule that she joins the terrorist group called the Death Watch, which distrusts the Jedi Order and allies itself with Count Dooku and Darth Maul at different points (and is betrayed by both). She also appears in Star Wars: Rebels and resists the Empire&#39;s rule, until the Empire launches a devastating attack against the Mandalorians known as the Great Purge.
Bo-Katan&#39;s history and role in The Clone Wars and Rebels sets up her appearance in the live-action TV show The Mandalorian. When Sackhoff returns to play the live-action Bo-Katan in The Mandalorian season 2, she is the leader of a Mandalorian cell different from the one the main character was raised in. Bo-Katan plays a major role in the show and is set to appear in The Mandalorian season 4. Sackhoff is a veteran sci-fi actress and has demonstrated that she can effectively play this complex Star Wars character, whether she&#39;s animated or live-action.





 7  Kevin Conroy (Batman) 
Batman: The Animated Series (1992-1995) &amp; Crisis On Infinite Earths (2019-2020)
        

Kevin Conroy first voiced Batman in the acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series of the 1990s, which kicked off the DC Animated Universe. He also voiced Batman in subsequent animated TV shows and video games, including the 2001 animated Justice League series. Conroy is among the cameos in the Arrowverse&#39;s Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover, playing the live-action Bruce Wayne from Earth-99. Conroy&#39;s portrayal of a disillusioned Batman received some backlash from fans (via CBR). However, Conroy is still an iconic Batman actor and was a worthy addition to Crisis on Infinite Earths.

 6  Merle Dandridge (Marlene) 
The Last Of Us (2013) &amp; HBO&#39;s The Last Of Us (2023-Present)
        

Merle Dandridge provides the voice of Marlene for several The Last of Us video games and reprises her role in HBO&#39;s The Last of Us TV show. HBO adapts Marlene&#39;s story from the video games: She was a close friend of Ellie&#39;s mother Anna, is the leader of the revolutionary militia group called the Fireflies, and initially wants to protect Ellie for Anna&#39;s sake, but decides that Ellie must be sacrificed to hopefully produce a vaccine. Because of her final decision, she becomes an antagonist to Joel. Joel kills Marlene and the Fireflies and tells Ellie that they gave up on looking for a cure.





 5  Dwayne Johnson (Maui) 
Moana (2016)




While Auliʻi Cravalho will not be returning to her role as Moana in the live-action Moana remake, Dwayne Johnson will be returning as Moana&#39;s partner in crime, the demigod Maui. Johnson was a highlight of the original 2016 Moana, delivering a stellar performance of Maui&#39;s hilarious arrogance which is slowly revealed to cover up his loneliness. The live-action Moana may struggle with being a remake of such a recent movie, but Johnson will doubtlessly bring the same charisma. Among Disney&#39;s upcoming live-action remakes, Moana is currently the most recent movie being remade. However, a live-action Frozen, a live-action Tangled, and a live-action Princess and the Frog are all rumored.





 4  Lars Mikkelsen (Grand Admiral Thrawn) 
Star Wars: Rebels (2014-2018) &amp; Ahsoka (2023-Present)
        

Lars Mikkelsen also voiced a character in one of Star Wars&#39; animated properties before playing that character again in a live-action TV show. Grand Admiral Thrawn is one of the main villains in Rebels, as he is a high-ranking Imperial officer during the height of the Empire&#39;s power. Thrawn worked side-by-side with Darth Vader, whom he previously knew as Anakin Skywalker. According to Wookieepedia, &#34;[Emperor] Palpatine considered Thrawn and Vader his two most useful servants.&#34; 
Thrawn continues to be one of the most ruthless characters in the Star Wars universe in Ahsoka. Thrawn disappears after the Empire&#39;s fall but returns alongside his apprentice Morgan Elsbeth in Ahsoka, with plans to restore the Empire to its former glory. Thankfully, Mikkelsen plays the intimidating character well in both the animated and live-action mediums, making Thrawn a popular Star Wars villain.





 3  Megalyn Echikunwoke (Vixen) 
Vixen (2015-2016) &amp; Arrow (2012-2020)
        

Megalyn Echikunwoke first played DC&#39;s Mari McCabe/Vixen in the animated series Vixen, which takes place in the Arrowverse. She also voiced the character in the video game Injustice 2. During the animated show&#39;s short run, Echikunwoke made a brief appearance as Vixen in the live-action TV show Arrow. Vixen appears in season 4, episode 15 of Arrow, as an old friend of the series&#39; protagonist Oliver Queen. Oliver calls upon Vixen to help him fight Darhk. Unfortunately, this was Echikunwoke&#39;s only appearance on the show.





 2  Zoë Kravitz (Catwoman) 
The LEGO Batman Movie (2017) &amp; The Batman (2022)




Before starring alongside Robert Pattinson in the acclaimed movie The Batman, Zoë Kravitz actually had a small role as Catwoman in The LEGO Batman Movie. In The LEGO Batman Movie, Catwoman fights alongside other Batman villains, including the Joker and the Riddler. When the Joker betrays them, Catwoman and the rest of the villains ally with LEGO Batman.
Other noteworthy actors make cameos voicing the LEGO villains, including Jason Mantzoukas as the Scarecrow and Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face. Yet Kravitz is unique among them because she went on to play a live-action version of her character. The Batman and The LEGO Batman Movie have vastly different styles and tones, but they are both lucky to have Kravitz as their Catwoman.

 1  Gerard Butler (Stoick The Vast) 
How To Train Your Dragon (2010)
        

Gerard Butler is reportedly reprising his role of Stoick the Vast (via Deadline) in the upcoming live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon. Stoick is a vital character in the original How to Train Your Dragon movies, as he is the chief of the central Viking tribe and the father of the protagonist Hiccup. Butler will be starring alongside Mason Thames as Hiccup, Nico Parker as Astrid, and Nick Frost as Gobber.
Butler and Thames are tasked with capturing the complicated yet hearfelt dynamic between father and son. While the live-action How to Train Your Dragon faces many challenges, finding a suitable actor to play Stoick is not one of them. Some voice actors play essentially the same character in live-action, but Butler&#39;s performance will be interesting because he will possibly be playing a revised version of Stoick.
