The Last of Us season 2 has officially announced its casting of Abby Anderson, making us glad that this 10-year-old casting fan dream never happened. In the years before HBO&#39;s The Last of Us TV show was released, all kinds of fancasting and speculation surrounded the franchise, with a live-action adaptation being the hope of fans for years. Several of The Last of Us&#39; key characters were commonly associated with specific actors, including one that will now be appearing in The Last of Us season 2.




The Last of Us is HBO&#39;s critically-acclaimed adaptation of the video game of the same name, with it being considered one of the best live-action video game adaptations of all time. Season 1 was a massive hit, with it adapting the story of the first game. Due to the massive success of season 1, The Last of Us season 2 will be adapting the story of the second game, The Last of Us Part II, meaning several characters from the sequel will appear in the show for the first time - including Abby.

The Last of Us season 2 has cast Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, with this casting decision paying off a previous The Last of Us fancasting choice. Out of all of The Last of Us Part II&#39;s characters, Abby is the most important new addition to the series, which is why casting a big-name actress like Kaitlyn Dever was important. Dever has previously appeared in movies like Booksmart and No One Will Save You, meaning that The Last of Us season 2 will definitely be an exciting change of pace.




Casting Kaitlyn Dever as Abby is an interesting choice, and she was previously a popular pick for playing Ellie. Fans of The Last of Us have pointed Dever out as the perfect Ellie for a decade now, with many hoping that she would be picked by the time a live-action adaptation occurred. While Dever aged out of the role by the time HBO&#39;s The Last of Us actually happened, casting her as Abby is a great way to pay off this longstanding fan wish.



 Why Kaitlyn Dever Is The Perfect Abby For The Last of Us 
         

Although many fans wanted her as Ellie, Kaitlyn Dever is actually the perfect Abby for The Last of Us season 2. Kaitlyn Dever has already proven that she has an incredible acting range, meaning that she can successfully take the character from someone that audiences hate to someone that audiences sympathize with. Dever is also a fairly big name when it comes to young actresses, meaning that she could bring even more attention to the cast of The Last of Us season 2.




On top of her acting abilities, Kaitlyn Dever also looks a lot like Abby from the video game, meaning that she can be perfectly translated to live-action. Dever&#39;s age also matches up with that of Abby, with her being older than Ellie causing her to be a lot more threatening. On top of it all, Kairlyn Dever has a lot of experience in the film and television industries, meaning that she can probably handle the backlash that Abby will undoubtedly receive in The Last of Us season 2 better than a newcomer.
