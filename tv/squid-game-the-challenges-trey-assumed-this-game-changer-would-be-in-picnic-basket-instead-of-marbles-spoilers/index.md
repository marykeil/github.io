## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Trey Plutnicki, player 301, was playing with his mother LeAnn but even together, they never anticipated this twist.




Squid Game: The Challenge has captivated Netflix viewers with its intense challenges and similarities to the South Korean smash hit, Squid Game, but there were game-changing twists players like Trey Plutnicki, player 301, were expecting to see. The series, which is based on the Netflix original from 2021, has become an overnight sensation and made some of the players competing into buzzworthy reality TV stars. Trey originally joined the game with his mother, LeAnn Wilcox Plutnicki, player 302, and the pair competed to the best of their ability throughout the majority of the competition until they were faced with being torn apart during Marbles, a popular Squid Game challenge.




Trey and LeAnn partnered for what they thought was going to be a celebratory picnic that the players were being treated to for completing a chore in a timely manner. Instead, their picnic baskets contained the marbles that would ultimately push LeAnn to be eliminated. In an interview with People, Trey explained that he’s familiar with the gameplay on Survivor and “[I had] seen two advantages fly by the wayside [during Squid Game], and in Survivor, if the advantage is gone, it&#39;s re-hidden. And I was like, ‘There&#39;s got to be something in here, man. There surely is something.’”


 LeAnn Always Looked For Clues On Squid Game: The Challenge 
          

Trey originally thought there would be an advantage in the game in their picnic baskets, but Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 has been known to twist their twists, ensuring that the players are kept on their toes. For her part, LeAnn shared that she was always “looking for clues” in the game, but wasn’t always sure what she was seeing. LeAnn shared that when it came to Marbles, “we didn&#39;t know what kind of game we were playing…We didn&#39;t know what it was.” LeAnn explained that while they “intended to play a good portion of the game” with their mother and son status a secret, it unfortunately didn’t happen.





 

LeAnn and Trey’s hope that they could’ve duped the competition was dashed quickly when the pair competed in the series first challenge, Red Light, Green Light. While Trey and LeAnn weren’t openly cheering for one another, Trey was visibly struck with fear about whether LeAnn would make it through the difficult game. When LeAnn crossed the finish line, Trey was completely relieved and overwhelmed by the fact that his mother would be continuing on in the competition. Afterward, both were unable to keep the fact that LeAnn was Trey’s mother a secret from the rest of the competition, but they still tried to divide and conquer the game together.

With Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 still pushing the boundaries of the competition down to the last episode, which will air in just a matter of days. As the competition has come down to the wire, only 3 competitors remain in the running for the massive $4.56 million grand prize. Though Trey and LeAnn were both eliminated prior to the Squid Game: The Challenge finale, their analysis of the game and understanding of the inner workings of the competition has been interesting to hear after the fact.
