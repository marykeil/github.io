## Literature Review
The Force lives in all living things, including Mandalorian warriors. Here are 7 Star Wars clues that Mandalorians may actually be wielding the Force.




If any group of people in the Star Wars galaxy wanted to avoid wielding the Force the way the Jedi do, it would be the Mandalorians - but they may already be wielding it in their own way. Mandalorian warriors have long since been renowned as the greatest warriors in the galaxy, a statement both reinforced and proven in The Mandalorian. Their beskar armor and their rigorous training for battle makes them one of the Star Wars galaxy&#39;s most dangerous forces, though there may be even more than that in play.


The Mandalorians seem to always be at odds with the Force, particularly in the area of good fortune. Their homeworld has been desolated on several different occasions, both by adversaries and by themselves. Their hunger for battle is what makes them such a threat, as compared to light side Jedi and dark side Sith Force-wielders. The Mandalorians, however, may have their own way of wielding the Force, and here are 7 clues in Star Wars that they&#39;ve secretly been wielding it all along.


 Star Wars&#39; Mandalorian Timeline &amp; History Explained 
As the greatest warriors in the Star Wars galaxy, Mandalorians have a rich and expanding history, and this is their full timeline in canon explained.













 








 7  Mandalorians Are The Jedi&#39;s Ancient Enemies 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
        

As keepers of the peace, making an enemy of the Jedi is a difficult task to accomplish - and yet the Mandalorians did so. Though many Mandalorians and Jedi have since gone on to work together, from Bo-Katan Kryze and Ahsoka Tano to Din Djarin and Grogu, they still regard one another&#39;s kind as their ancient enemy. Mandalorians are extremely skilled warriors, but to become a formidable foe against the Jedi, it must have taken an extra push for them to truly present a threat to the Force-wielders. The Force itself may have provided that push, accompanying the Mandalorians in a way they may never have been truly aware of.





 6  Mandalore May Have A Force Vergence 
Star Wars Battlefront II
        

The planet of Mandalore has fallen under the interest of two dark side Force-wielders in Star Wars history: Emperor Palpatine and Darth Maul. This is particularly interesting, given the fact the planet truly has nothing to offer other than its skilled warriors, especially with its surface being devastated by the effects of war. Yet it seems the planet was still a target in Palpatine&#39;s contigency plan Operation: Cinder, which saw its destruction at the hands of Moff Gideon after the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War. Seeing as Operation: Cinder targeted planets where Palpatine had hidden observatories, it could very well be that he established one near a dark side Force vergence on Mandalore - which could prove the Mandalorians were drawing the Force from this very same point.





 5  The Living Waters Have Mystic Properties

The Living Waters beneath the mines of Mandalore, as featured in The Mandalorian season 3, have proven to be much more than a simple body of water where traditional ceremonies take place. When providing the proof of his redemption, Din Djarin offers a vial of the Living Waters to the Armorer, and when she pours them out within her own forge, the waters create a shining blue light that ripples throughout the small pool. There is also a Mythosaur who resides within those very waters, a mythical creature who could very likely be feeding on some kind of Force energy embedded within the very waters themselves.
The Living Waters seem to be necessary in the forging of beskar armor, as the Armorer has often demonstrated in The Mandalorian, and this could also link the waters to the Force itself. Beskar armor can repel lightsabers and blaster bolts, but it can&#39;t do so on its own; it needs a magnetic type of seal. The Living Waters seem to contain a property that can act as that seal, and given the Force&#39;s ability to repel the same kinds of attacks, it could very well be a manifestation of the Force within the waters themselves acting as the magnetic property.

 4  Many Mandalorians Have Incredible Intuition

For many years, Mandalorian warriors have often become some of the galaxy&#39;s most skilled bounty hunters, and this isn&#39;t a simple coincidence. Any type of hunting requires heightened senses, and the ability to often expect the unexpected. This proves the Mandalorians possess these qualities and a unique intuition that&#39;s allowed them to thrive in the bounty hunting trade for hundreds of years, with The Mandalorian&#39;s Din Djarin as a prime example. On one occasion, he&#39;s able to catch a creature right as it pounces without even having to look behind him to know it&#39;s there, proving the true strength of his intuition that could very well be guided by the Force.





 3  Mandalorians Have Been Able To Sense The Future 
The Mandalorian
        

One of the Jedi&#39;s unique abilities thanks to the Force is the power to quickly glimpse into the future, something that helps them to detect blaster bolts and more. Mandalorians have also demonstrated their own ability to sense the future, though theirs is used more generically. Rather than offering assistance in defending themselves, Mandalorians in Star Wars history have been able to sense what may be ahead for them - mostly in the form of prophecy.
In The Mandalorian season 1, the Armorer is able to tell Din Djarin that he will &#34;soon&#34; be receiving his mudhorn signet, just before he embarks on the job where he does, indeed, earn his signet. Similarly, Star Wars: The Mandalorian Junior Novel by Joe Schreiber also details Din sensing the radical way his life will change when landing on Arvala-7 to begin the job where he meets Grogu. These moments could be guided by the Force, informing the Mandalorians of where their respective paths lie.





 2  There Have Been Several Mandalorian Jedi 
Star Wars Rebels &amp; Ahsoka
        

Being a Mandalorian and being a Force-wielder have not always been exclusive to one another. Tarre Vizsla, creator of the Darksaber, became the first Mandalorian Jedi to take the cultures of the ancient enemies and blend them together. Ahsoka has also shown that Sabine Wren is following the same path, as she is now learning under Ahsoka Tano as a Jedi Padawan while maintaining her Mandalorian roots. This proves Mandalorians have been strong Force-wielders in their history, even if only a few have decided to strengthen their bond with the Force under the teachings of the Jedi.





 1  The Darksaber&#39;s Unique Properties Greatly Affect Mandalorians 
Star Wars Rebels &amp; The Mandalorian

Before its destruction at the end of The Mandalorian season 3, the Darksaber was the Mandalorians&#39; most famed and respected weapon. The ruler of their people was determined simply by the wielder of this blade, but it was much more than the lightsaber of a Mandalorian Jedi. Over time, the Darksaber proved it carried a heavy burden along with it, one that can only be attributed to the same mysticism that surrounds the Force.
The first to demonstrate this burden was Sabine in Star Wars Rebels, as she struggled to wield and pair with the blade - only being able to do so under the instruction of the Jedi Kanan Jarrus. Din Djarin&#39;s time with the Darksaber also proved his own struggle, as the burden was so heavy for him to bear that he injured himself with it and was never able to master it. The blade carried something significant with it, something that all Mandalorians could feel. If the blade was connected to the Force, this would mean the Mandalorians who used it could also sense the strength of its power in the Force, proving the famed Star Wars warriors must also have their own personal connection to the Force.
