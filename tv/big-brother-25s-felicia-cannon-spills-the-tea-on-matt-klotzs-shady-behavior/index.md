## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s Felicia Cannon has always been among the most outspoken cast members, and her commentary on the season&#39;s round table was revealing.




Big Brother 25’s Felicia Cannon is well known for being one of the most outspoken members of the cast, and in a revealing Instagram Live, Felicia shared her thoughts on the BB 25 jury round table. Felicia competed for the $750,000 grand prize but was evicted from the Big Brother house in fourth place just days before the live finale, where Jag Bains was crowned the winner. As the second to last juror, Felicia participated in the jury round table, a conversation hosted by BB legend Dr. Will Kirby. The round table allows the jury members to discuss who they feel should win the game.




During the round table, things got heated between some of the cast members, like Felicia, Cirie Fields, and Cameron Hardin. As they discussed the merits of each player, Felicia shared on a recent Instagram Live with fellow houseguest Mecole Hayes that her perception of BB 25 runner-up Matt Klotz changed when it was revealed that “Matt said some stuff behind closed doors.” 


 

According to Felicia, Matt’s ability to mask that he was speaking poorly about his fellow houseguests may have cost him the game. She shared with Mecole, “I think somehow that probably got out to people more than he realized, and so that nice all-American guy that everybody wanted to believe he was, they found out he really wasn’t.”

While the jury round table gave the evicted houseguests a chance to sit down and try their best to zoom out for the game to assess the merits of their fellow houseguests, it became difficult to manage at times. Before the round table’s airing, Dr. Will shared that it was one of the most enjoyable round tables he’s ever been a part of, explaining there were several arguments. While many hoped to see the arguments during the finale, the round table segment was edited to be a bit less hostile. In her Live with Mecole, Felicia shared that she argued with Cameron over his ally Red Utley’s eviction.


 

While Felicia clarified that she could hold her own with Cameron, she allowed him to make his point about Red’s eviction being unnecessary. Felicia, understanding the dynamics between Cameron and Red would’ve ultimately been difficult for her to overcome at that stage in the game, maintained getting rid of Red when her alliance did. Outside of her argument with Cameron, Felicia also had a minor issue with Cirie Fields, who was trying to say she never lied to Felicia in the game. Cory Wurtenberger called Cirie out, pushing Cirie to be honest with her long-time ally now that they were outside the game.




As Big Brother 25 has come to a close, the houseguests have been sharing information about the season that many weren’t privy to during the episodes or even on the live feeds. While Felicia was always quick to share what was on her mind in the house and during her time with the jury, when faced with the choice of whom to vote for to win the grand prize, she had a hard time. Though her jury vote went to Matt, who ultimately lost to Jag, Felicia still felt that her role on the jury was important.
