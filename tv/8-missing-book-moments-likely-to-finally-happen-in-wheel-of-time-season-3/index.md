## Literature Review
Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time season 3 has a valuable opportunity to include eight missing storylines from the show&#39;s first two seasons.




The Wheel of Time season 3 is likely to include at least eight important storylines that were missing from the show&#39;s first two seasons. The show is based on Robert Jordan&#39;s iconic novel series of the same name, and thus far, it has covered three of Jordan&#39;s 14 volumes. The end of The Wheel of Time season 2 lines up roughly with the end of the second novel in Jordan&#39;s series, The Great Hunt, though it includes aspects of book three, The Dragon Reborn, as well.
The Wheel of Time season 3&#39;s story is expected to pick up with the fourth novel, The Shadow Rising. Though book four is the purported basis for the upcoming season, it&#39;s highly likely that a handful of the most critical missing plot lines from the first three novels will also be worked in. Some of these missing stories end up being crucial later on, and there are eight of them that seem particularly likely to be included in some fashion when season 3 finally arrives.
            

 Wheel Of Time Cast &amp; Character Guide 
Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time could be the next big fantasy series - here&#39;s a breakdown of the sprawling cast of characters in the expansive saga.



 8  Rand Learns Swordsmanship From Lan 
From The Great Hunt



In The Wheel of Time books, Lan is a mentor and role model for Rand, instructing him in the ways of the sword and teaching him how to face challenges on his feet. Rand&#39;s training with Lan begins at the start of the second Wheel of Time book, The Great Hunt, and though the show has already covered this book, Lan and Rand&#39;s reunion at the end of season 2 makes it possible for their training to occur in season 3. This is one of the moments The Wheel of Time season 3 cannot afford to fail because Rand&#39;s sword skill plays an important role later on.





 7  Perrin Meets Faile Bashere - His Future Wife 
From The Dragon Reborn
        

The Wheel of Time changed course from the books early by giving Perrin a wife in season 1, only to have him tragically kill her while fighting off trollocs. Luckily for Perrin, there is a missing romance from the book series that is likely to occur in The Wheel of Time season 3. This romance is between Perrin and Zarine Bashere, who insists on being called Faile. Since Perrin first meets Faile while traveling, it&#39;s likely he will encounter her for the first time during his journey back to the Two Rivers, which is where his Wheel of Time season 3 story is expected to take him.





 6  Mat Duels Galad And Gawyn With His Quarterstaff 
From The Dragon Reborn




One of the best fights that could occur in The Wheel of Time season 3 is Mat&#39;s sparring bout with Galad Damodred and Gawyn Trakand. Gawyn and Galad, Elayne Trakand&#39;s brother and half-brother respectively, are two of the best swordsmen at the White Tower when Mat encounters them, making it incredibly impressive when Mat takes them both out at the same time using nothing but his trusty quarterstaff. This iconic scene was missing from The Wheel of Time season 2, but Mat&#39;s use of a quarterstaff in the finale could be meant to foreshadow this fight&#39;s imminent arrival in season 3.





 5  Rand Retrieves Callandor From The Stone Of Tear 
From The Dragon Reborn
        

Perhaps the most critical moment from The Dragon Reborn that is missing from The Wheel of Time season 2 is Rand&#39;s retrieval of Callandor from the Stone of Tear. Callandor is one of the most powerful sa&#39;angreal ever made, and it plays a central role in Rand&#39;s final confrontation with the Dark One. Though The Wheel of Time season 2 opted to end with The Great Hunt&#39;s climax, requiring it to skip much of The Dragon Reborn, this event is so momentous that it&#39;s difficult to imagine it being cut entirely.
Further, Rand is expected to journey to the Aiel Waste during season 3, which would likely take him by or through Callandor&#39;s home in Tear. Alternatively, if Rand doesn&#39;t travel to Tear, the location of Callandor could be changed to the sacred city of Rhuidean in the Aiel Waste. Rand finds the access keys to the two most powerful sa&#39;angreal ever made, the Choedan Kal, in Rhuidean, so it wouldn&#39;t be much of a stretch to place Callandor there as well. While this would likely disappoint book fans, it could save the show some valuable time.





 4  Thom Merrilin Reunites With Rand 
From The Great Hunt
        

Thom Merrilin made his debut back in The Wheel of Time season 1, and though he appears to sacrifice himself to save Mat and Rand from a Myrddraal, book fans will know that Thom manages to survive this encounter. In The Great Hunt, Rand is thrilled to find that Thom is alive and living in Cairhien, and though this scene is missing from The Wheel of Time season 2, Thom is expected to return for season 3. Thom&#39;s return is highly anticipated, and his reunion with Rand and Mat should be a powerful scene in the show.





 3  Rand Travels To An Alternate World Using A Portal Stone 
From The Great Hunt
        

During The Great Hunt, Rand discovers portal stones, which are essentially gateways to alternate worlds. The world Rand enters through the portal stone is desolate and dangerous, but his first journey through it allows him to cover far more ground than he could have in his own world. Considering he will have to cross the entire continent to reach the Aiel Waste from his position in Falme at the end of season 2, traveling via portal stone could be a convenient way of getting him quickly from one place to the next, and it would allow the show to introduce another aspect of Jordan&#39;s beloved universe.

Amazon Prime Video has found great success with The Wheel of Time, now the studio is producing The Age of Legends, a prequel film trilogy. 



 2  Mat Travels To Caemlyn And Meets Queen Morgase 
From The Dragon Reborn
        

Mat&#39;s journey in The Wheel of Time season 3 could take a lot of different routes, but one missing storyline from The Dragon Reborn could provide a hint as to Mat&#39;s future. In this book, Mat is tasked with traveling to Caemlyn to deliver a message to Queen Morgase from her daughter and heir, Elayne. There, Mat meets both the Queen and her lover, Lord Gaebril, who turns out to be a Forsaken in hiding. Queen Morgase is mentioned several times during The Wheel of Time season 2, making this missing storyline fairly likely to occur in season 3.





 1  The Aiel Storm The Stone Of Tear 
From The Dragon Reborn
        

The Aiel storming the Stone of Tear is one of the most epic events in The Dragon Reborn, and considering the part it plays in the Prophecies of the Dragon, it&#39;s still likely to occur in The Wheel of Time season 3, even if this season is expected to focus on the following book, The Shadow Rising. The Stone of Tear is a massive fortress, and before the Aiel take it in The Dragon Reborn, it has never been conquered. This incredible achievement seems too momentous to be left out, and with the Aiel expected to take on a larger role in season 3, it&#39;s likely to occur soon.
