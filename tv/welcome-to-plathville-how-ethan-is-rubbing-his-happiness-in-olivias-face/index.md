## Literature Review
Ethan Plath from Welcome To Plathville is spending time with his family and enjoying doing things he couldn’t while living with Olivia Plath.




Welcome To Plathville star Ethan Plath is living his best life after separating from his wife, Olivia Plath. Viewers first saw the pair when the family drama series premiered in 2019. At the time, the couple seemed very much in love and looking forward to building a future together. Welcome To Plathville season 1 showcased Ethan dealing with the usual troubles with his parents not accepting his wife for who she was. Despite his best efforts, he couldn’t improve things, which led him to relocate away from Cairo, Georgia. Ethan and Olivia were hopeful the move would benefit them.




Unfortunately, Ethan and Olivia’s relationship worsened once they began staying away from his family. The couple got to spend more time with each other, making them realize they weren’t on the same page. In Welcome To Plathville season 5, Ethan grew more distant from Olivia and her needs. He looked heartbroken and did many things to sabotage his connection with his wife. Ethan and Olivia reached an impasse as the season finale unfolded. They announced their split on social media.

In June, Ethan shared a video of his car on Instagram. He captioned the post, “my car, the road, and I. The most peaceful place I know.” The Welcome To Plathville star seems more relaxed now than ever. He is comfortable spending time with things like cars, as he can rely upon them more than he could on his self-centered wife.



 Ethan Loves Enjoying Time With His Family 
          




Ethan has reconciled with his family members after breaking up with Olivia. Over the last five years, he had to distance himself from his family members just to appease his wife. He had to give up on so much by staying away from people he loved. Now, Ethan can proudly be with his siblings and parents. He has made amends with his sister and has even begun spending a lot of time with all his friends. In March, Ethan shared a family picture and looked very happy to be home. He captioned the post, “saw my Dad and siblings. So good to see them.” As expected, the Welcome To Plathville star’s bitter wife didn’t like the post.
