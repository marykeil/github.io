## Literature Review
Hannah and Conrad had a drama-filled romance on Below Deck Mediterranean that got them in trouble with Captain Sandy.




Hannah Ferrier and Conrad Empson had a season-long romance on Below Deck Mediterranean season 3 with many dramatic ups and downs. This was not Hannah&#39;s first time finding a connection aboard a yacht, as she had a flirtation with one of the guests, Jason Ziegler, on Below Deck Med season 2. Hannah and Conrad&#39;s relationship divided the rest of the crew, but there is no doubt Captain Sandy Yawn did not approve. As Below Deck season 8 continues to unfold, it&#39;s time to revisit their ill-fated romance.




Hannah and Conrad&#39;s relationship was a slow burn, as they had an attraction, but Conrad wanted to take things slow. The pair often got into trouble with Sandy for getting distracted from their jobs by spending time with each other. They shared a sweet kiss on Below Deck Med season 3, episode 4, but by episode 11, they had called things off. Conrad was a hopeless romantic and liked the sweeter side of Hannah rather than the bossier side, and Hannah wanted him to accept all parts of her personality.

 Cigarettes Ruined Their Relationship On Below Deck Med 
          

Their relationship notoriously came to an end after 50 Euros and a pack of cigarettes. Conrad bought Hannah some cigarettes and expected to be paid back. When he brought it up to her, she felt insulted and went on about her ex-boyfriend buying her expensive things. Neither one felt they were in the wrong, and former Below Deck Med cast member Hannah said the damage was done in the next Below Deck Med episode. Though Hannah and Conrad decided their relationship was over, that did not stop them from stirring up drama until the very last episode of the season.






 Hannah And Conrad Argued On Below Deck Med 
          

Hannah and Conrad continued having volatile arguments over how different they were from each other and how it wouldn&#39;t work between them. In the last episode of Below Deck Med season 3, Hannah proved she was not quite over Conrad. She asked if it would bother him if she went on another man&#39;s yacht after the season ended and slept with him, unsuccessfully trying to make him jealous. Conrad and Hannah spent the night together in the master cabin, but their plans for the future did not pan out the way they hoped.

The pair had planned a trip to Prague after the charter season, but both decided it was for the best if they did not go on it. After Below Deck Mediterranean was over, Conrad and Hannah confirmed that they called things off and did not continue their toxic relationship after the season ended. They have both moved on from their boatmance, as Hannah is married to Josh Roberts and are parents to their daughter Ava Grace. Conrad also has his own family with a girlfriend, a daughter, and a pug.
