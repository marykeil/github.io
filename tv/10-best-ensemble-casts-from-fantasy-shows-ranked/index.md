## Literature Review
Amazing ensemble casts bring fantasy series to life, depicting the ambitions and relationships of the main characters and capturing the overall world.




Recent critically acclaimed fantasy TV shows owe their success in part to great ensemble casts. These casts comprise new talent and veteran actors who are suited to different roles in the story, from mentors to protégés to villains. It is up to the cast to depict, alliances, rivalries, friendships, and romances, but also give a sense of how people who grew up in the show&#39;s setting see the world.
Fantasy TV shows often feature casts of characters who work together as a unit, as is the case with Stranger Things, Wheel of Time, and Attack on Titan. However, since Game of Thrones&#39; success, fantasy series depicting characters flung far and wide with storylines that only occasionally overlap have become more common. Additionally, a fantasy story is by nature obligated to world-build, but the right actor can make even exposition monologues interesting.









 








 10  Stranger Things (2016-2025) 
Biggest Stars: Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder, &amp; David Harbour


 







 Stranger Things 

 Release Date   July 15, 2016    Cast   Finn Wolfhard , joe keery , Jamie Campbell Bower , Brett Gelman , Caleb McLaughlin , Maya Hawke , David Harbour , Matthew Modine , Priah Ferguson , Gaten Matarazzo , Winona Ryder , Charlie Heaton , Sadie Sink , Millie Bobby Brown , Joseph Quinn , Dacre Montgomery , Natalia Dyer , Noah Schnapp    Showrunner   Matt Duffer , Ross Duffer    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




 Stranger Things launched several young stars to fame, including Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown. As the characters and actors grew up, the Stranger Things cast maintained a Goonies-like sense of on-screen camaraderie. While the main group of kids and teenagers carries one part of the story, the other half is led by Winona Ryder and David Harbor as the main adult characters. The combination of awkward kids and resolved adults comes together perfectly. However, the story becomes increasingly convoluted as the show goes on. The once charming cast might not be enough to save Stranger Things season 5.





 9  Wheel Of Time (2021-Present) 
Biggest Stars: Rosamund Pike, Daniel Henney, &amp; Madeleine Madden
        

 The Wheel of Time 

 Release Date   November 19, 2021    Cast   Barney Harris , Zoe Robins , Madeleine Madden , Marcus Rutherford , Daniel Henney , Rosamund Pike , Josha Stradowski , Kate Fleetwood , Priyanka Bose , Hammed Animashaun    Streaming Service(s)   Prime Video    Showrunner   Rafe Judkins    




Robert Jordan&#39;s monumental epic fantasy series was finally adapted by Amazon in recent years, with Rosamund Pike taking on the lead role of wandering sorceress Moiraine Damodred. Pike is joined by Daniel Henney, Madeleine Madden, Zoë Robins, Josha Stradowski, and Marcus Rutherford, who form the central Wheel of Time cast of six main characters who appear in every episode of the series so far. The cast carries the fantasy story well. However, none of them have the same notoriety as the stars recruited for the likes of Game of Thrones, while the newer actors have failed to capture the same attention as Emilia Clarke or Kit Harrington.
            
 
 10 Reasons Fantasy TV Shows Are Still So Hard To Adapt (Despite Fantasy Being Huge Right Now) 
Many studios have tried to recapture the success of Game of Thrones with their own fantasy shows. Here are the reasons why it&#39;s so difficult.









 8  Attack On Titan (2013-2023) 
Biggest Stars: Yûki Kaji, Bryce Pepenbrook, Yui Ishikawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Jesse James Grelle, &amp; Marina Inoue
        

 Attack On Titan 

 Release Date   April 7, 2013    Cast   Matthew Mercer , Josh Grelle , Hiroshi Kamiya , Shiori Mikami , Jerry Jewell , Kishô Taniyama , Jessica Calvello , Masahiko Tanaka , Yui Ishikawa , Romi Park , Robert McCollum , Tomohisa Hashizume , Hiro Shimono , Trina Nishimura    




Attack on Titan features two casts who respectively voice the original Japanese version and the English dub of the show. The series depicts a walled civilization struggling to fend off the Titans, non-sentient giants who eat humans. The story centers on Eren Jaeger (Yûki Kaji/Bryce Pepenbrook), who vows to destroy all the Titans after his mother is killed.
Eren and his best friends Armin Arlert (Marina Inoue/Jesse James Grelle) and Mickasa Ackerman (Yui Ishikawa/Trina Nishimura) join the military together. While the actors voicing the young recruits depict the various characters&#39; personalities and relationships, amazing performances are given by those playing their mentors: energetic Commander Hange Zoe (Romi Park/Jessica Calvello) and ruthless Captain Levi Ackerman (Hiroshi Kamiya/Matthew Mercer).Attack on Titan is an intense show, and only a very talented voice cast could bring it to life.





 7  True Blood (2008-2015) 
Biggest Stars: Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer, Nelsan Ellis, &amp; Alexander Skarsgard


 







 true blood 

 Release Date   September 7, 2008    Cast   Ryan Kwanten , Kristin Bauer van Straten , Sam Trammell , Alexander Skarsgard , Stephen Moyer , Rutina Wesley , Anna Paquin , Chris Bauer    Showrunner   Alan Ball    Streaming Service(s)   HBO Max , Hulu , Prime Video    




Based on Charlaine Harris&#39; Sookie Stackhouse novels, True Blood is a vampire show that arrived along with The Vampire Diaries after Twilight saw massive success. The bizarre series starring Anna Paquin as Sookie features everything from vampires to werewolves to faeries. Paquin is accompanied by Stephen Moyer as Sookie&#39;s main love interest, vampire Bill Compton. Alexander Skarsgard is especially memorable as vampire Eric Northman, while Nelsan Ellis, Rutina Wesley, and Ryan Kwnaten also give noteworthy performances. The True Blood cast plays out a morbid and tense story over the show&#39;s seven seasons.





 6  The Rings Of Power (2022-Present) 
Biggest Stars: Morfydd Clark, Robert Aramayo, Markella Kavenagh, &amp; Cynthia Addai-Robinson


 







 The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power 

 Release Date   September 1, 2022    Cast   Morfydd Clark , Ismael Cruz Cordova , Charlie Vickers , Markella Kavenagh , Megan Richards , Sara Zwangobani , Daniel Weyman , Cynthia Addai-Robinson , Lenny Henry , Lloyd Owen , Nazanin Boniadi , Dylan Smith , Alex Tarrant , Tyroe Muhafidin , Robert Aramayo , Geoff Morrell , Thusitha Jayasundera , Maxine Cunliffe    Showrunner   John D. Payne , Patrick McKay , Louise Hooper , Charlotte Brändström , Wayne Yip    Streaming Service(s)   Amazon Prime Video    




The Lord of the Rings prequel TV show The Rings of Power cast many relatively unknown actors. However, they prove that they can handle the larger-than-life quality of many Lord of the Rings characters. Morfydd Clark and Robert Aramayo play Galadriel and Elrond respectively, both portraying a more youthful version of the wisdom the audience associates with the characters. Markella Kavenagh, Ismael Cruz Cordova, and Nazanin Boniadi lead storylines mostly separate from Galadriel and Elrond.
Kavenagh is one of the Harfoots, the ancestors of the Hobbits; Kavenagh&#39;s character comes across the &#34;Stranger&#34; (Daniel Weyman) who is theorized to be Gandalf. Cruz Cordova and Boniadi portray a star-crossed romance between a single human mother and an elf soldier. While the cast encompasses a lot of talent, several storylines in The Rings of Power never overlap, leaving audiences wondering if they will ever see particular character interactions.





 5  Arcane (2021-Present) 
Biggest Stars: Hailee Steinfeld, Harry Lloyd, &amp; Katie Leung
        

 Arcane 
Set in the League of Legends universe, Arcane focuses on sisters Violet and Powder (later Jinx) as they end up on opposite sides of a growing conflict between the wealthy utopia of Piltover and its dark undercity whose citizens wish to break away from their oppressors. Hailee Steinfeld, Ella Purnell, and Kevin Alejandro star in this animated adventure. 
 Release Date   November 6, 2021    Cast   Hailee Steinfeld , Ella Purnell , Kevin Alejandro , Katie Leung , jason spisak , Toks Olagundoye , Harry Lloyd , JB Blanc , Reed Shannon , Mick Wingert    Showrunner   Christian Linke , Alex Yee    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




 Hailee Steinfeld is the most well-known voice actor of Arcane, based on the League of Legends video game. However, the show includes a variety of talents who voice the other characters. Kevin Alejandro voices the passionate yet naive inventor turned politician Jayce; Harry Lloyd takes on Jayce&#39;s partner Viktor; Katie Leung is Vi&#39;s (Steinfeld) headstrong ally and possibly love interest; Ella Purnell gives an impactful performance as Vi&#39;s violent sister Jinx. The voice actors effectively portray a complicated web of passionate friendships and rivalries among the characters and will continue to do so in Arcane season 2.





 4  Shadow And Bone (2021-2023) 
Biggest Stars: Jessie Mei Li, Freddy Carter, Amita Suman, &amp; Ben Barnes


 







 Shadow and Bone 
Based on Leigh Bardugo&#39;s bestselling Grishaverse novels, Netflix&#39;s Shadow and Bone follows the story of Alina Starkov, an orphan and soldier who has released a power that could potentially set her country free. Instead, Alina joins an elite army of soldiers known as the Grisha as the Shadow Fold, an area of mysterious darkness that grows each year, threatening to envelop her world. Alina quickly learns that nothing is as it seems, and it will take more than the power of magic to make it through.
 Release Date   April 23, 2021    Cast   Daisy Head , Kit Young , Julian Kostov , Ben Barnes , Jessie Mei Li , Simon Sears , Gabrielle Brooks , Amita Suman , Kevin Eldon , Danielle Galligan , Jasmine Blackborrow , Freddy Carter , zoe wanamaker , Sujaya Dasgupta , Luke Pasqualino , Archie Renaux , Calahan Skogman    Showrunner   Eric Heisserer    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




Shadow and Bone featured many relatively unknown actors who were perfect for their roles. Jessie Mei Li plays Alina Starkov, the protagonist of Leigh Bardugo&#39;s original Shadow and Bone trilogy of novels. Li has interesting on-screen interactions with Ben Barnes, who plays the series&#39; main villain.
Meanwhile, Freddy Carter leads a parallel storyline as Kaz Brekker, the leader of the gang known as the Crows. Kaz is a notoriously complex and cunning character in Bardugo&#39;s spinoff Six of Crows, but Carter lives up to the role. Amita Suman and Kit Young also shine as Inej Ghafa and Jesper Fahey, Kaz&#39;s most trusted associates. The Shadow and Bone cast is complimented by other newer actors, as well as Zoë Wanamaker as Alina&#39;s mysterious mentor Baghra.

From His Dark Materials to The Witcher, magic systems are an essential part of almost every fantasy story, and some TV shows got it right.









 3  House Of The Dragon (2022-Present) 
Biggest Stars: Emma D&#39;Arcy, Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, &amp; Paddy Considine


 







  House of the Dragon 

 Release Date   August 21, 2022    Cast   Fabien Frankel , Graham McTavish , Olivia Cooke , Gavin Spokes , Sonoya Mizuno , Steve Toussaint , Matt Smith , Matthew Needham , Rhys Ifans , Emma D&#39;Arcy    




 House of the Dragon recruited several major stars to play a new set of political schemers in Game of Thrones&#39; equally complex prequel. Paddy Considine plays the ailing King Viserys, while Matt Smith portrays his rogue brother Daemon and Rhys Ifans his corrupt advisor Otto Hightower. Olivia Cooke plays Otto&#39;s daughter; the pair becomes one of the main forces behind the civil war for the Iron Throne. On the other side of the war is Emma D&#39;Arcy as Viserys&#39; eldest daughter Rhaenyra. D&#39;Arcy plays their character with palpable wisdom and determination. House of the Dragon also introduced Milly Alcock and Emily Carey as younger versions of Rhaenyra and Alicent, respectively.





 2  His Dark Materials (2019-2022) 
Biggest Stars: Dafne Keen, Amir Wilson, Ruth Wilson, James McAvoy, &amp; Lin-Manuel Miranda
        

 His Dark Materials 

 Release Date   November 3, 2019    Cast   Andrew Scott , James Cosmo , Will Keen , Jade Anouka , James McAvoy , Lin-Manuel Miranda , Daniel Frogson , Clarke Peters , Nina Sosanya , Anne-Marie Duff , Lewin Lloyd , Simone Kirby , Dafne Keen , Lucian Msamati , Amir Wilson , Gary Lewis , Sean Gilder , Ruth Wilson , Ariyon Bakare , Ruta Gedmintas    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , HBO Max    




His Dark Materials, based on Philip Pullman&#39;s fantasy series of the same name, is primarily about Lyra (Dafne Keen) and Will (Amir Wilson) navigating a world that wants to exploit them both. Keen and Wilson have amazing chemistry that is apparent from their first scene together in the season 2 premiere. However, this series about children deciding which adults are allies and enemies would not be complete without the adults. Keen and Wilson are supported by older veteran actors, including Ruth Wilson and James McAvoy as Lyra&#39;s brilliantly corrupt parents Marisa Coulter and Lord Asriel. Lin-Manuel Miranda also demonstrates his acting talent completely divorced from his songwriting as Lee Scoresby.





 1  Game Of Thrones (2011-2019) 
Biggest Stars: Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Emilia Clarke, &amp; Kit Harrington


 







 Game Of Thrones 
Created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Game of Thrones is a TV series based on the book “A Song of Ice of Fire” by George R. R. Martin. It tells the story of the ongoing battle between the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros - as they fight for control of the coveted Iron Throne. Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the far north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night&#39;s Watch, led by House Stark&#39;s Jon Snow, is the first to encounter icy horrors that threaten all realms of men. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and quickly became one of the biggest event series in the &#34;Golden Age&#34; of TV. Winner of 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international fan base.
 Release Date   April 11, 2011    Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Showrunner   David Benioff , D.B. Weiss    Streaming Service(s)   HBO Max    




At the time of its premiere, the Game of Thrones cast included some well-known actors, but also made several more incredibly famous. Season 1 is led by Sean Bean as Ned Stark, but other characters take over after the character&#39;s sudden death. The show&#39;s political conflict is dominated by Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey as siblings Tyrion and Cersei Lannister, with their brother Jaime attempting to act as an intermediary.
However, the stars who are most associated with the show are those who appear in supporting roles in the early seasons but become the main characters as other characters die off. This includes Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark, Maisie Williams as her sister Arya, Kit Harrington as their alleged half-brother Jon Snow, and Emilia Clarke as the deposed heir Daenerys Targaryen. Game of Thrones is arguably the most successful TV show of the 21st century, due to its complex storytelling and amazing cast of regulars and recurring characters.
