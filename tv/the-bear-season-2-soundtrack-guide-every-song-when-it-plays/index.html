  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Bear season 2 is filled with new and classic songs in every episode, primarily rock hits from bands like REM, Pearl Jam, and Counting Crows.</p>
<p>Along with the restaurant chaos, Chicago explorations, and personal storylines, The Bear season 2 soundtrack elevated the successful series pulling from memorable songs of the 1990s. The Bear season 2 picks up shortly after the end of the first season, as Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) and Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri) prepare for the opening of their new restaurant, The Bear, with the returning staff from The Beef. As the tension picks up in The Bear season 2, the FX/Hulu TV show’s music selection adapts to the characters’ new subplots and interactions.</p>
<p>The Bear season 1’s soundtrack was already impressive, and season 2 kicks it up a notch as the killer songs continue to roll in. From the opening scene to The Bear season 2&rsquo;s ending, the soundtrack includes plenty of 1990s rock hits from bands like Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Counting Crows, and The Smashing Pumpkins, as well as older classics from AC/DC, Van Morrison, and Lindsey Buckingham. The Bear season 2 also mixes in modern songs from Taylor Swift, tracks from Chicago-native band Wilco, and Christmas classics during a special flashback episode, making for an expansive and diverse soundtrack in each episode.</p>
