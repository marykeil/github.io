<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Cowboy Bebop is a fan-favorite anime for good reason, but, for those who have already watched it multiple times, there are these other amazing series.</p>
<p>Cowboy Bebop is often cited as a perfect starter anime for good reason, naturally leading many to seek out anime with the same vibe. With its jazzy music, deep characters, and witty plots, Bebop&rsquo;s magic is difficult to recapture. Given that even the series&rsquo; big-budget Netflix remake couldn&rsquo;t even carry the torch by the estimation of many critics and fans, it&rsquo;s tempting to think there&rsquo;s nothing else out there like it. Though Bebop is indeed unique, that doesn&rsquo;t mean fans should give up hope of finding a similar series.
Whether it be fellow anime space westerns, grounded sci-fi, or just plain crime dramas there are several anime that fans of Cowboy Bebop should check out. Bebop casts a wide net with its web of references, meaning fans really have their pick of the litter when it comes to anime. Even the series&rsquo; creator Shinichiro Watanabe has revisited many of the themes and ideas that made Bebop so special in a handful of his future works. Every fan of Cowboy Bebop owes it to themselves to at least give a few other anime series a try.</p>
<p>15  Trigun (1998)
Based on the manga series by Yasuhiro Nightow &amp; produced by Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Netflix, Crunchyroll <br>
Much like Bebop, Trigun is a genre-bending space western with a lot of comedy and even more heart. The series tells the story of Vash, a man with a massive bounty on his head and a mysterious past. Following Vash are insurance adjusters Meryl and Milly who serve as audience surrogates in many ways. Trigun is similar in many ways to Cowboy Bebop, but it is different in that it takes the Western theme further, featuring the classic cowboy look. Cowboy Bebop fans who want another space western owe it to themselves to watch Trigun or its more recent reboot series Trigun Stampede.

2023 was an absolutely incredible year for anime, with new series and established franchises alike making an important mark on the industry.</p>
<p>14  Space Dandy (2014)
Original anime series by Studio Bones</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Tubi, Crunchyroll <br>
Also created by Watanabe, Space Dandy is a lighthearted absurdist take on Cowboy Bebop. The series is packed with adventure, fast-paced action, and a bucket-load of laughs. Set in the far future, the series follows a space hunter named Dandy who searches for undiscovered alien lifeforms. This means Dandy visits the furthest corners of the universe in search of unknown life-capable planets in his efforts to document new alien species. More than just created by the same person, Space Dandy actually takes place in Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s distant future, meaning eagle-eyed fans can catch a few references.
Fans of director Shinichiro Watanabe&rsquo;s work should keep an eye out for his upcoming series Lazarus, expected to be released in 2024.</p>
<p>Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>13  Bungo Stray Dogs (2016)
Based on the manga series written by Kafka Asagiri &amp; illustrated by Sango Harukawa</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   60+1 OVA    Where to Stream   Funimation, Crunchyroll <br>
Bungo Stray Dogs is a series that has a lot of the film-noir feel that fans like in Cowboy Bebop. There&rsquo;s more comedy involved in Bungo, but the plot focuses on individual characters and their personal stories, which is another key feature of the genre. It&rsquo;s also told in a one-shot style with limited serialized elements, a bit like Cowboy Bebop, which means viewers don&rsquo;t necessarily have the watch the episodes of Bungo Stray Dogs in any particular order.
Fans of Bungo Stray Dogs might also enjoy the spin-off series released in 2021 titled Bungo Straw Dogs Wan!</p>
<p>Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>12  Michiko &amp; Hatchin (2008)
Original anime series by Studio Manglobe</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   22    Where to Stream   Funimation, Crunchyroll <br>
Michiko &amp; Hatchin, sometimes known as Finding Paradise in the West, is a 2008 anime series that takes many stylistic cues from Cowboy Bebop. The plot follows the two titular characters—initially implied to be a mother and daughter duo—on the run following a prison break. A tale of intrigue and danger at the fringes of society, Michiko &amp; Hatchin is, in some ways, a revised version of Cowboy Bebop. Interestingly enough, Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s director signed on to produce music for Michiko &amp; Hatchin, strengthening the link between the two series.
Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>11  Outlaw Star (1998)
Based on the manga by Takehiko Ito &amp; produced by Sunrise</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu <br>
Outlaw Star is another anime featuring a group of likable rogues, namely Gene Starwind and Jim Hawking. The two heroes spend their days performing all sorts of odd jobs on their planet of Sentinel III. All of this changes, however, when a mysterious woman named Hilda recruits the two as bodyguards. As is often the case in these kinds of comedic-adventure anime, in no time the pair are in a world of trouble, including being wanted by the cops, pirates, angry aliens, other bounty hunters, and a mysterious assassin. The only thing they do have going for them is their ship, the Outlaw Star, the galaxy&rsquo;s most advanced spacecraft. Much like Bebop, the real heart of Outlaw Star is the crew Gene and Jim accumulate over time.
Watch on Hulu</p>
<p>10  Black Lagoon (2006)
Based on the manga series by Rei Hiroe &amp; produced by Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   24+5 OVAs    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
What makes Cowboy Bebop unique is that the story behind each of its characters commonly revolves around a dark personal tragedy. The same careful, considered character development and an underlying feeling of darkness are to be found in Black Lagoon. The series boasts an equally interesting and dark story, though Black Lagoon follows a rag-tag band of mercenaries as opposed to bounty hunters. The audience&rsquo;s point of view character is Rock, an average businessman who gets captured by mercenaries. He decides to join the crew after a negotiation goes awry, as he&rsquo;s curious to live the harsh yet adventurously eventful life the others lead.

<p>10 Best Studio Madhouse Anime
Madhouse is an animation studio with a long history of putting out classic anime. Here are 10 of the best series every created by Studio Madhouse.</p>
<p>9  Carole &amp; Tuesday (2019)
Original anime series directed by Shinichiro Watanabe &amp; produced by Studio Bones</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream   Netflix <br>
Another anime created by Bebop mastermind Watanabe, Carole &amp; Tuesday is actually set in the same universe as Cowboy Bebop, although slightly further along the timeline. The series follows the titular odd-couple music duo as they try to make it as musicians. Fans of Bebop will instantly appreciate Carole &amp; Tuesday&rsquo;s musical themes and more grounded characters. Though the series does lack much of the action that makes its predecessor so famous, it makes up for it with a compelling depiction of the power of music. Also much like Bebop, the series isn&rsquo;t afraid to tackle social issues. Though Carole &amp; Tuesday was released in 2019, its discussion of AI-generated art feels particularly relevant in the modern age.
Watch on Netflix</p>
<p>8  Baccano! (2007)
Based on the light novel series by Ryohgo Narita &amp; illustrated by Katsumi Enami</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   16    Where to Stream   Currently unavailable on streaming <br>
Those who enjoyed the stylish fight scenes in Cowboy Bebop need not look further than Baccano! Much like Bebop, this anime is jam-packed with jazzy action scenes that are classy and chaotic. The show is also set in 1930s Chicago, and it&rsquo;s been lauded for its enrapturing, period-accurate score. Baccano! is told out of order and features an ensemble cast on the hunt for missing bottles that contain the elixir for immortality. The main story arc isn&rsquo;t all there is, however, with many side stories padding out the overall plot.</p>
<p>7  Psycho-Pass (2012)
Original anime created by Production I.G.</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   41    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Tubi, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime Video <br>
One of the most appealing factors to Cowboy Bebop is that its main protagonist is so well-written, likable, and fleshed out. Viewers learn much about his past, and, throughout the show, Spike is shown to be somewhat of an anti-hero. Psycho-Pass also features an extremely well-written protagonist. Moreover, the show&rsquo;s setting is familiar in that it&rsquo;s both futuristic and has a distinct noir feel to it. Though Psycho-Pass is much more of a crime-thriller, its social commentary and well-written plot will be more than appealing to any fan of Bebop. Psycho-Pass was so successful that it even spawned a massive franchise with two sequel seasons and four movies.

<p>6  Gungrave (2003)
Original anime series created by Yasuhiro Nightow based on the video game by Red Entertainment</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
Gungrave follows two close friends, Harry and Brandon, who are forced to join a crime syndicate once their underworld activities put them in over their heads. However, it&rsquo;s revealed very early on that Harry betrayed Brandon, and the series recounts how the two came to be kingpins of the criminal underworld before tackling the issue of revenge. Beautiful and dire, it&rsquo;s easily comparable to the almost nihilistic narrative approach taken in Cowboy Bebop. Conceptualized by Trigun creator Yasuhiro Nightow, Gungrave is sure to appeal to fans of that series too. Though Gungrave is perhaps better known for the PlayStation 2 video game, the anime series is definitely worth a watch.
Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>5  Coyote Ragtime Show (2006)
Original anime directed by Takuya Nonaka &amp; produced by Ufotable</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream   Funimation, Crunchyroll <br>
Many fans of Cowboy Bebop praise it for its often over-the-top yet visually appealing and entertaining action and adventure, and fans obsessed with the series primarily thanks to its visual flair owe it to themselves to check out Coyote Ragtime Show. The anime follows a space-hopping criminal simply named Mister who spent almost a year in prison. A mere ten days before he would have been released, his partners, Bishop and Katana, break him out. The show features lost treasure, federal investigators, a criminal guild, and android assassins.
Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>4  Blood Blockade Battlefront (2015)
Based on the manga by Yasuhiro Nightow &amp; produced by Studio Bones</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   24+2 OVAs    Where to Stream   Funimation, Crunchyroll <br>
Based on another manga by Yasuhiro Nightow, Blood Blockade Battlefront—also known as Kekkai Sensen—features secret organizations, monsters, gods, and plenty of hijinks-filled adventures. The series boasts a fantastic soundtrack similar to Cowboy Bebop, with many a jazz tune thrown in. Much like Cowboy Bebop, this anime show pays particularly careful attention to its well-produced and dynamic fight sequences. Though Blood Blackade Battlefront features much more fantastical elements, its tone and setting make it a natural fit for any fan of Cowboy Bebop.
Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>3  Death Parade (2015)
Original anime series created by Yuzuru Tachikawa &amp; produced by Studio Madhouse</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
For those who like a series that leans more on the dark aesthetic of the film noir genre, there&rsquo;s Death Parade. Part of this is due to the grim setting, and part of this is due to the central focus of the plot in which souls are used as betting currency in a game. When someone dies, they are given to purgatory&rsquo;s bartenders to eventually either ascend into eternity or face banishment in the void. Death Parade was adapted from a short film called Death Billiards instead of a manga, which definitely gives it a unique edge.
Fans of Death Parade should also check out director Yuzuru Tachikawa&rsquo;s other notable works, Mob Psycho 100 and Deca-Dence.</p>
<p>Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>2  Gun X Sword (2005)
Original anime series written by Hideyuki Kurata &amp; produced by Studio AIC ASTA</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Funimation, Crunchyroll <br>
This outstanding Western-genre-bending anime packs much of the same themes explored in Cowboy Bebop, albeit in a very different fashion. Van, an extremely aloof anti-hero, is hellbent on getting revenge, and, while that&rsquo;s a trope that has been done to death in both classic American Western films and anime Westerns, Gun X Sword nails it, retaining the stylistic aspects of anime and Westerns which fans love about both genres.
Watch on Crunchyroll</p>
<p>1  Samurai Champloo (2004)
Original anime series by Studio Manglobe</p>
<p>Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream   Funimation, Hulu, Crunchyroll <br>
Set during an alternate version of the Edo period, Samurai Champloo follows the journey of three strange individuals, Fuu, Mugen, and Jin. After Fuu, a young girl, saves the other two from certain death by execution, she convinces the chaotic Jin and the reserved Mugen to help locate a mysterious samurai &ldquo;who smells of sunflowers.&rdquo; Samurai Champloo was Shinichiro Watanabe&rsquo;s direct follow-up to Cowboy Bebop, and the characters and the subtle undercurrent that follows the characters through both plots are similar.
Much like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo is also a character-driven story, with each episode revealing more about each. Another notable aspect that both shows share is the sound-track-driven action and style that is carried through the music. Cowboy Bebop features jazz and blues, while Champloo is on point with its hip-hop and lo-fi sound. The characters in both shows are driven by a constant need for money and food.
Watch on Crunchyroll
Cowboy Bebop was truly lightning in a bottle, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there aren&rsquo;t anime with a similar appeal. Whether it be Samurai Champloo&rsquo;s music-driven fight scenes, Trigun&rsquo;s space western escapades, or Gun X Sword&rsquo;s lovable antihero, every element that fans love about Bebop can be found elsewhere in spades. Anime is a diverse medium, and for a series with such an eclectic set of influences like Cowboy Bebop, it only makes sense that there&rsquo;d be a wealth of anime for fans to check out.
Cowboy Bebop is available from Crunchyroll, Hulu, Netflix, and Tubi.
