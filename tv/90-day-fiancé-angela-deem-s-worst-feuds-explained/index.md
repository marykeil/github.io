## Literature Review
Angela Deem has been aggressive before and after her weight loss surgery. She has bickered with half of the 90 Day Fiancé cast in the past few years.




Angela Deem from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise has had dozens of feuds, some worse than the others. The 57-year-old grandma’s reality TV journey began over ten years ago. However, she didn’t become famous until she debuted in 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days season 2 alongside her Nigerian love interest, Michael Ilesanmi. Initially, Angela seemed like a strong and inspiring female cast member who stood up for herself. However, it was soon realized she was simply a bully after she pushed Michael around and made him submit to her demands.




Angela and Michael faced many challenges and trust issues over the last six years. They tried their best to overcome the gaps but failed on every front. In 2023, Angela finally got sick and tired of the whole situation. She joined 90 Day: The Last Resort to seek therapy but also brought divorce papers with her. During the spin-off, Angela discovered her personality issue. She learned how aggressive she was and saw Michael trying to better their marriage. Angela tore the divorce papers up in the finale, and reconciled with her husband. She gave him another chance despite his past infidelity.

 Angela Deem &amp; Usman “Sojaboy” Umar Can’t Stand Each Other 

 

90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7 Tell All featured one of Angela’s wildest fights. The drama began early in the season when Angela ordered Michael to quit social media. She went to his hometown, broke his car, and cursed at him. She even decided not to pay him or support him. Michael befriended fellow Nigerian star Usman in the following months. He shared his grievances with the man and got his support. That friendship led Usman to defend Michael from Angela. He took numerous shots at the American woman on social media, which eventually culminated during the reunion episode.

During the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off Tell All, Usman greeted Angela by calling her a “stupid ass****” person. The curse led Angela to scream back at him and tell him to “shut the f**k up.” The situation made all cast members uncomfortable as they watched their co-stars spew hatred at each other. Usman told Angela to leave the reunion, while Angela told Usman he was all talk, no action. During the fight, Usman alleged Angela was scamming his fellow Nigerian brother, Michael. He called her a “pig,” as she walked out of the reunion, pushing the production crew away.

 Angela Deem Burned Bridges With Former Bestie JoJo 
          

Angela has fought with several strangers and co-stars over the years. However, not many expected her to pick a fight with her former best friend Jojo and ditch her completely. Jojo, starred in the early seasons with Angela. She accompanied the meemaw, supported her, and flew to Nigeria to attend her wedding. Unfortunately, something changed in 2021 when the two ladies stopped following each other on social media. The silence led Jojo to address the situation on Instagram, revealing that he has decided to part ways with Angela.

While Jojo remained respectful in her statement, Angela lashed out at her by reacting to her words. She made a video with the quote, “alpha females don’t run in packs. She is often alone.” In the following days, Jojo revealed why she was no longer friends with Angela. Jojo explained that Angela got angry at her for something insignificant. The problem began when Angela asked Jojo how she knew Debbie Johnson, but Jojo didn’t give Angela credit for it. This communication issue led Angela to burst on Jojo, calling her a “lying bi**h” and “irrelevant.”






 Angela Deem Slapped A “Pal” At A Hotel 
         

Angela has physically attacked people since transforming her personality. She has crossed all the lines, from pushing the production crew to getting into cast members’ faces. In August 2023, one of her wildest fight stories surfaced online as a leaked clip. The video by The Sun showed Angela getting into a physical altercation with Jennifer from Dolce Aesthetics. The two ladies had a minor argument in their cab before they arrived at Hilton Garden Inn on Midtown Park Avenue. Angela was presumably intoxicated and lunged at the woman. The video showed Jeniffer begging Angela to get off her, but she didn’t.



 Angela Deem Got In Yara Zaya’s Face 
         




Yara Zaya and Angela have a love/hate relationship. The two ladies had a toxic exchange during 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7. The drama began when Angela was fighting with Usman, which pushed Yara to tell her to calm down. Angela didn’t like the tone and got into Yara’s face, telling her to shut up. It was a hilarious scene seeing everyone screaming at each other as Shaun Robinson awkwardly asked what was happening. Fortunately, things between Yara and Angela improved during 90 Day: The Last Resort. Meemaw got to know her Ukrainian co-star better. Angela wasn’t happy when Jovi broke Yara’s heart by visiting a strip club.



 Angela Deem Has Had Nasty Fights With Michael Ilesanmi 

 

Angela fought the most with Michael. While the two initially had a decent bond, Angela’s short temper ruined their connection. In one of the wild scenes in the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, Angela shoved a cake in Michael’s face. In another episode, she argued with him and his aunt, Lydia. Angela flashed her breasts on camera, telling them to “suck on these brand new f**king t*tties.” In 2022, Angela had a major fight with Michael in Nigeria. She surprised him at his home, tore his car apart, and cursed at him for asking for more money. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé franchise star won’t have any more fights in 2024.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
