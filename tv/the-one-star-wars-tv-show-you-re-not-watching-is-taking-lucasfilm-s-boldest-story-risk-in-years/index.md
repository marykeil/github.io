## Literature Review

These Jedi Younglings don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming for them as Star Wars pushes this TV show into a time of violence and conflict - the High Republic.




The younglings from the Star Wars TV show Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures may be in for an incredibly intense and deadly few years ahead with this shocking move from Lucasfilm. The children&#39;s animated series Young Jedi Adventures marked Lucasfilm&#39;s &amp; Disney&#43;&#39;s first foray into the landmark High Republic era of the Star Wars timeline as it first aired last year. Now, however, it seems that things are getting much more intense.




Young Jedi Adventures taking place in the High Republic era has manifested in a few ways, one of which being the appearance of Jedi characters Estala Maru, Bell Zettifar, and his master, Loden Greatstorm. These characters appeared in two episodes, and marked the first time characters from The High Republic ever graced a TV screen. Having Young Jedi Adventures set in the High Republic, however, seems to be leading to one of the boldest storytelling decisions Star Wars has made in years.

                  Star Wars&#39; High Republic Explained &amp; Release Guide (Books, Comics &amp; Show)   The Star Wars franchise is expanding into the High Republic Era - and here&#39;s everything you need to know about the books, comics, and shows.   


 Young Jedi Adventures Season 2 Is Set In A Time Of Crisis 
Star Wars: The High Republic - Phase I
         

The High Republic publishing initiative currently consists of books and comics organized into three phases, and explores the deadly events that led the Jedi Order to become the way it is during the prequel trilogy. There are several events in these books and comics that are transmedia crossovers, one being the opening ceremony of the Jedi space station Starlight Beacon. This ceremony is set to appear at the end of Young Jedi Adventures season 1, firmly placing the show in Phase I of The High Republic.




With Young Jedi Adventures season 2 being confirmed to take place during Phase I, this generally peaceful family-friendly show now occurs during a time period full of death and strife. With the Jedi Order and Republic facing down threats like the High Republic&#39;s own terroristic Nihil pirates, hyperspace disasters, the flesh-eating sentient plants known as the Drengir, and even the Jedi-killing Nameless creatures, these kids have no idea what they&#39;re in for. Even the prominent Starlight Beacon (that the kids have even visited in a previous episode) goes down in flames due to a Nihil attack.

When it comes to Star Wars having kids face turbulent times, Young Jedi Adventures will not be the first. Notably, the three kids of Han Solo and Leia in the Star Wars Legends timeline, Anakin, Jaina, and Jacen Solo, were the main characters of many young reader and middle grade chapter books who all faced ridiculously dark times. These may even be the darkest ever seen in Star Wars, with them fighting (and one of the Solo kids dying) in the Yuuzhan Vong War, an invasion from a violent, extra galactic alien species, which had over 365 billion casualties in total.




More recently, though, there were several episodes of Star Wars: The Clone Wars that featured a group of Jedi younglings out and about in the galaxy during the Clone Wars. This was a very dangerous time to be a Jedi, with the likes of General Grievous going around killing them and collecting their lightsabers. Being a kid during rough and turbulent times is not new in the galaxy far, far away, but as Young Jedi Adventures goes in this direction with The High Republic, it&#39;s going to be a refreshingly bold step for Star Wars television.



Young Jedi Adventures season 1 is available to stream on Disney&#43;.
