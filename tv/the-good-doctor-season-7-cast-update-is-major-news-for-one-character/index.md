## Literature Review
As the new season draws closer, The Good Doctor receives a major cast update for season 7 that will bring back one character as a series regular.




The Good Doctor season 7 receives a cast update with major news of one character&#39;s return. The Good Doctor follows Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgical resident with autism, as he becomes a doctor. In season 6, Highmore, Hill Harper, who plays Dr. Marcus Andrews, and Richard Schiff, who plays Dr. Aaron Glassman, were the three remaining original cast members of the series. However, Harper confirmed season 6 would be his last as he prepares to run for the U.S. Senate.




Despite the loss of Harper, TVLine reports that The Good Doctor season 7 will see the return of one original cast member. Chuku Modu will return as Dr. Jared Kalu. Modu has been bumped to a series regular for the new season.


 Dr. Jared Kalu&#39;s History On The Good Doctor 
          

Initially exiting The Good Doctor after season 1, Modu was among its original stars when it premiered in 2017. Jared worked as a surgical resident under Dr. Neil Melendez (Nicholas Gonzalez) alongside Dr. Claire Browne (Antonia Thomas) and Shaun. During his time at St. Bonaventure, Jared was one of Shaun&#39;s first friends, and briefly dated Claire. However, Jared was fired from the hospital after he physically assaulted Dr. Matt Coyle (Eric Winter) for harassing Claire. ​​​​​



Chuku Modu originally left The Good Doctor when it was revealed the series was going in a different direction creatively.







Feeling not only betrayed but singled-out by the hospital, Jared sued them for racial discrimination and won the case, but decided to move to Denver after being looked down upon by his superiors. He was written out of the series after the season 2 premiere. However, Modu returned for The Good Doctor season 6, starring in 7 episodes across the run as Jared enlisted his former colleagues&#39; help with a patient.

The Good Doctor season 6 finale saw Jared, Danny (Brandon Larracuente), and Jerome (Giacomo Baessato) get into a serious car crash while transporting a patient to the hospital. While Jared wasn&#39;t seriously injured, he could have some trauma to work through following the event, which forced Danny into emergency surgery. He will also likely grow closer to Shaun, as he has just welcomed his first child with Lea (Paige Spara) during the season finale.






The Good Doctor season 7 premieres on ABC on Tuesday, February 20.
