## Literature Review
After experiencing one of the biggest betrayals of his life, Tyray Mollett from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise has shifted his focus to fitness.




Tyray Mollett from 90 Day: The Single Life has transformed himself since his last appearance on reality TV. The 33-year-old TLC star had a surprisingly unusual journey on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. He pursued his girlfriend, Carmella, with whom he had been in a happy relationship for over four years. Tyray loved Carmella but had never met her in person. Therefore, he was excited to see her for the first time and document his journey. Unfortunately, things weren’t what they seemed. Carmella wasn’t real; it was a catfish account by a man named Christian.




Tyray discovered the truth midway through 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. He learned that Christian had used another woman’s photos to scam him for nearly four years. After being heartbroken by the revelation, Tyray decided to meet the woman he thought was his girlfriend. He had a great discussion with her and left the show smiling. In December 2023, Tyray announced his return to TV in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. He seemed excited about returning to the dating game and finding someone real for a change.

 How Did Tyray Start Gaining Weight? 
          

Tyray has dealt with excessive weight and fitness problems throughout his adult life. He has been overweight for a long time due to issues that go back to his childhood. He was once a healthy kid when he was very young. However, things changed when he started feeling lonely and fulfilling himself with food to feel happy. Tyray didn’t have many friends to play with or share his feelings. Therefore, he spent his time eating, which eventually transformed into a food addiction. His dependency on food got worse as he grew older.






 Tyray Started Working Out In July 2023 

 

Tyray discovered that he had to work on himself to improve himself in 2023. He started exercising and began focusing on his health and diet. In July, Tyray’s trainer posted a motivational workout video on his Instagram, Buddy Loves Fitness. The clip showed Tyray lifting weights, doing cardio, and looking happy. The new 90 Day: The Single Life star appeared in another outdoor workout video in the following weeks. He hiked with his group of friends and seemed overjoyed with his progress. Tyray commented on a Buddy Loves Fitness post, “can’t wait to do it again,” showing he’s eager to make a change.



 How Does Tyray Look In December 2023? 
          




It has been nearly half a year since Tyray started working out. Nowadays, he looks much happier and healthier and travels more often. Tyray has befriended many of his 90 Day Fiancé franchise co-stars and loves hanging out with them. In early November, he met Kim Menzies, Riley Diego, and a friend, Kiki Marie, and looked to be in great shape. He has lost weight and toned up his physique. He has also shaken up his style and fashion drastically. Tyray has embraced sportswear and also shaved his head.
