## Literature Review
After the latest episode of Sister Wives season 18 aired, Robyn and Kody Brown’s irresponsible and potentially dangerous behavior is being called out.




Sister Wives viewers are holding Robyn Brown and Kody Brown accountable for allegedly being terrible guardians. The married duo has been notorious since their debut in 2010. However, their actions this year truly made them the ultimate villains of the show. In Sister Wives season 18, Kody and Robyn embraced a monogamous relationship after indirectly kicking out Janelle and Meri Brown. They made everything about themselves, from Christine’s birthday to Janelle’s feelings. Kody even shockingly said he wanted Meri to live in his Coyote Pass barn, insinuating that she was just an animal.




Kody and Robyn have been annoying for some time. However, their carelessness in a recent episode of Sister Wives season 18 truly triggered viewers. Recently, Reddit user Losttraveller88, shared their grievances, revealing how Kody and Robyn had medicine lying around the kitchen counter, within reach of kids.


 

The Redditor wrote, “They have young children running around,” claiming that it was bad parenting on Kody and Robyn’s part. Many other Redditors agreed with the sentiment and shared their responses. Reddit user Whatami73 wrote, “And this is when they’ve ‘cleaned up’ for filming.” Pot_Flashback1248 commented, “Leaving meds around is pretty low.”

 Kody &amp; Robyn Brown&#39;s Parenting On Sister Wives Explained 
          

The medicine issue isn’t the first time Sister Wives viewers have noticed Kody and Robyn’s parenting issues. Previously, Kody was accused of being a horrible father when he didn’t visit his daughter on her surgery day. He also forgot to give a Christmas gift to Savannah. Kody has abdicated from parenting most of his kids, except his babies with Robyn. The 54-year-old man has ruined his relationship with his son Paedon; dissed his trans child Leon; made Gabe cry by being ignorant; and forced Meri, Janelle, and Christine to do his job as a parent.

It is never a good idea to keep medicinal drugs in easy-to-reach areas when surrounded by kids. Therefore, Kody and Robyn deserve to be called out for leaving the medicine out in the open. The two Sister Wives stars have decades of experience as parents but still haven’t learned the basics. They must understand that they are now grandparents, and a single mistake could lead to an emergency. Hopefully, Kody and Robyn will listen to the fans and be more responsible about these things. They need to be more self-aware and fix their home arrangements.




Still, there’s a small chance that fans have judged Kody and Robyn too harshly about the meds. They may have simply overlooked it because of the filming schedule and various other chores they do every day. If Sister Wives fans are incorrect, Kody and Robyn must try to defend themselves with proof. Otherwise, this issue will continue to ruin their images.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
