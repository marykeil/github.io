While Gunn has yet to reveal any details from the story of Peacemaker season 2, some of the director&#39;s updates on the series have teased what fans can expect from the DCU show. Recently, Gunn confirmed Peacemaker season 2&#39;s place in the DCU. According to the new universe&#39;s creative chief, Peacemaker season 2 will be part of the DCU&#39;s Chapter One.

Gunn has already confirmed that several members from Peacemaker season 1 will continue as their characters in the new DC Universe, which includes John Cena as Peacemaker, Freddie Stroma as Vigilant, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and more. Following Peacemaker season 1&#39;s ending, the series could have some interesting ties to another DCU TV show. That show would be none other than Waller.

Davis will finally get to lead her own project as Amanda Waller and Peacemaker season 1&#39;s ending teased what the DCU&#39;s Waller series could be about. Leota Adebayo revealed to the world in Peacemaker season 1 that her mother, Waller, was in charge of Project Butterfly and the Suicide Squad. DC&#39;s upcoming Waller series, which is confirmed to feature characters from Peacemaker, could deal with the fallout of that decision, setting up the story of Peacemaker season 2.
