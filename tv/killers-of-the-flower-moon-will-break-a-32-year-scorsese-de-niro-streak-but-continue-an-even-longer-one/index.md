# Killers Of The Flower Moon Will Break A 32-Year Scorsese &amp; De Niro Streak (But Continue An Even Longer One)


## SUMMARY 



  &#34;Killers of The Flower Moon&#34; could secure Robert De Niro&#39;s first Oscar nomination for a Martin Scorsese film since 1992, ending a 32-year streak.   Despite its lack of awards success so far, the film is predicted to receive several Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director.   While Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s chances for an Oscar nomination may be slim, Lily Gladstone is a potential winner, and De Niro is expected to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

## Literature Review

Robert DeNiro will probably get an Oscar nomination on January 23rd for Killers of the Flower Moon, which will end a very long streak. 




The Oscar nominations announcement is only days away, and everything seems to indicate that Killers of The Flower Moon will finally break a nomination streak for Robert De Niro. Killers of the Flower Moon is De Niro and Martin Scorsese&#39;s tenth collaboration. Before this film, they had already worked together in Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, New York, New York, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, and The Irish Man, which was the iconic duo reunion after 24 years.






Killers of the Flower Moon is the first time DiCaprio and De Niro, Scorsese&#39;s favorite actors, worked together in one of his films.




Killers of the Flower Moon isn&#39;t doing so well in terms of winning awards during this season. However, it will surely get several Academy Awards Nominations. According to Oscars 2024 predictions, the film will likely compete for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Regarding acting categories, even though Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s chances of getting an Oscar nomination are pretty much dead, Lily Gladstone might take the awards, while Robert De Niro is most likely going to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, which will mean the end of a long streak while working with Scorsese.

                  Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s Oscars 2024 Chances Look To Be Completely Dead Now   With the Golden Globes ceremony outcomes and recent SAG Awards nominations announcement, Leonardo DiCaprioâ€™s chances at the Oscars are few.    





 Killers Of The Flower Moon Will Likely Be De Niro&#39;s First Oscar Nomination For A Scorsese Movie Since 1992 
          

Robert De Niro&#39;s Oscar history while working with Martin Scorsese marks a positive tendency considering he has received nominations in 3 out of 9 collaborations so far, which could turn into 4 out of 10 if this year&#39;s prediction finally materializes. His role as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver is the first of the three nominations while working together. With his second nomination, which was for his work in Raging Bull, De Niro won an Academy Award for the second time in his career. The third and last nomination was in 1992 for Cape Fear, meaning he hasn&#39;t been nominated while working with Scorsese in 32 years. 

During that time, De Niro and Scorsese worked together in two more movies: Casino, and The Irish Man, both of which featured Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro&#39;s iconic duo. However, De Niro&#39;s performances were overlooked by the Academy, which contributed to the 32-year streak. Nonetheless, leaving out his Scorsese films, De Niro received only one nomination in those 32 years, and it was for Silver Lining&#39;s Playbook when he broke a 21-year nomination streak. In other words, De Niro&#39;s lack of nominations goes beyond his collaborations with Scorsese. 






 Killers Of The Flower Moon Probably Won&#39;t Break De Niro&#39;s 43-Year Streak Since He Last Won 
          

Even though Killers of the Flower Moon is most likely breaking De Niro&#39;s 32-year nomination streak, it probably won&#39;t break a longer one. De Niro&#39;s last Oscar win was in 1980 for Raging Bull and, despite the fact it would be great to see him break Katherine Hepburn&#39;s Oscar record, all predictions indicate that Robert Downey Jr. will take the statue for his role of Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer. Such a long winning streak for an icon like De Niro is quite weird and makes one wonder if it will ever be broken, considering he is 80 years old.
