# Percy Jackson Episode 6s Dream Leaves Out A Major Demigod Character s First Cameo


## SUMMARY 



  Percy Jackson episode 6&#39;s dream sequence introduces the important character Thalia in the book, but the show omits her cameo, likely due to casting uncertainties and a desire to avoid overwhelming future teases.   The dream in episode 6 provides valuable set-up for future storylines, including hints about the Lightning Thief and The Voice&#39;s plans, but including Thalia would have made the episode too crowded.   The decision to leave out Thalia from the dream was a smart choice by the writers, who can still tease her presence in future seasons if the show continues.

Summary

  Percy Jackson episode 6&#39;s dream sequence introduces the important character Thalia in the book, but the show omits her cameo, likely due to casting uncertainties and a desire to avoid overwhelming future teases.   The dream in episode 6 provides valuable set-up for future storylines, including hints about the Lightning Thief and The Voice&#39;s plans, but including Thalia would have made the episode too crowded.   The decision to leave out Thalia from the dream was a smart choice by the writers, who can still tease her presence in future seasons if the show continues.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6&#39;s dream sequence leaves out a cameo from a vital demigod character. One of the major story reveals of Percy Jackson episode 6 is that Percy is now invading the dreams of the mysterious Voice. Percy Jackson&#39;s &#39;The Voice&#39; has been haunting the titular character&#39;s dreams since episode 1, though the sequence found in episode 6 is notably different from before.

In Percy Jackson episode 6&#39;s dream sequence, The Voice was speaking to another person who is later revealed to be the Lightning Thief. This scene is taken from a similar chapter in the original Lightning Thief book, though the Percy Jackson show makes one major book change to the dream. In the book, the dream features the first cameo from a demigod character who proves vital to the overarching story of the series, a cameo that Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 neglected to include.


 Percy Jackson Episode 6â€™s Dream Does Not Include Thalia, The Daughter Of Zeus 
          




The character in question was none other than Thalia Grace, the daughter of Zeus. Thalia has been referenced at length in Percy Jackson and the Olympians as the girl who traveled to Camp Half-Blood alongside Luke and Annabeth. Thalia sacrificed herself to save Annabeth and Luke with Zeus taking pity on his daughter and preserving her life in the form of a pine tree that now protects Half-Blood Hill.

In the dream before Percy reaches Las Vegas in Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Percy notices Thalia sitting next to him in a school classroom. Both are wearing straitjackets before Percy breaks free, symbolizing his importance as the only remaining child of the Big Three gods now that Thalia has been turned into Camp Half-Blood&#39;s tree. However, the dream in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 leaves this part of the dream out, instead using it to tease the Lightning Thief.



 Why The Percy Jackson Show Missed Out Thalia 
          




The omission of Thalia from Percy Jackson episode 6&#39;s dream likely has many reasons, the most realistic simply being that Thalia is yet to be cast given the current uncertainty over future seasons of the show. That said, another reason is also because Percy Jackson season 1 has already foreshadowed several future characters and storylines. The likelihood is that the writers of the show did not want to risk overdoing the future teases, something that certainly would have been the case had Thalia&#39;s cameo been included.

The dream alone in Percy Jackson episode 6 provides a lot of set-up for the future through the teases of the Lightning Thief to The Voice&#39;s plans for Percy and a great war in the future. Combined with the story of the Castellans - Hermes, Luke, and Luke&#39;s mother May - and Percy Jackson episode 6 would simply have been too overstuffed if Thalia was included. This was certainly a smart choice from the writers of Percy Jackson and the Olympians who will have a lot of chances to tease Thalia should the series be picked up for future seasons.
