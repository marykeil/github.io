## Literature Review
Nick Ham and Devin Hoofman joined 90 Day Fiancé season 10 with mixed reactions from fans, but the couple might be the real deal after all. 




Nick Ham and Devin Hoofman are 90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomers who joined the popular reality TV show to mixed fan reactions, though their wedding in the latest episode shows why they might work out in the end. Nick and Devin are very different people as Nick comes from city life in South Korea, while Devin is from a small town in Arkansas. However, their wedding showed that they might really be a 90 Day Fiancé franchise couple who goes the distance.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 newcomers Nick and Devin have not received a warm welcome from fans, as Nick comes across as rude and Devin can be temperamental. Nick has a very un-serious attitude and also loves calling Devin &#34;piggy.&#34; This is a nickname that she said upset her, though she reluctantly accepted it when he refused to stop. However, her friends and family were shocked to hear him calling her such an offensive nickname, as it pokes fun at Devin&#39;s body. Meanwhile, Devin showed that she can be moody and temperamental when trying to prepare for the wedding. However, their relationship seems strong nonetheless.


 Nick Earned Acceptance From Devin’s Family 
          

Although Nick got off to a horrible start with her family by calling Devin &#34;piggy” and voicing offensive American stereotypes in front of them, he managed to fix his relationship with them on their wedding day. Nick admitted to Devin’s father that he got emotional practicing for the wedding, which led to her father admitting he had changed his mind about Nick and was accepting him into the family. This showed a big departure from the typical 90 Day Fiancé franchise father, as Devin&#39;s parents clearly didn&#39;t have a positive first impression of Nick. However, seeing them accept Nick and watching him become more vulnerable revealed a new side to the relationship.






 Nick &amp; Devin Might Be Soulmates 

 

Nick and Devin also showed a sweeter side to their romance on their wedding day, as the 90 Day Fiancé newcomers discussed how they met by chance, calling each other soulmates. Unlike other couples in the extended franchise, Nick and Devin had an organic meeting when they were both traveling in Australia. Nick doesn&#39;t seem focused on a green card, as he doesn&#39;t have a high opinion of the U.S. Therefore, it seems the couple is together because they have real feelings for each other, even if they haven&#39;t had many sentimental moments.

There is another reason why Nick and Devin appear to be one of the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 couples who will last. Devin showed she respects Nick’s culture and wants to honor Korean traditions. She selected a traditional dress for their wedding to make Nick feel more welcome in the U.S., while she also practiced a bit of Korean. However, the newly married Nick and Devin should find a new home following 90 Day Fiancé season 10 so they can start their lives together.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
