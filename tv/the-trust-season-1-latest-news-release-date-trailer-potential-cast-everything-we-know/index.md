## Literature Review
The Trust: A Game of Greed has been confirmed by Netflix. The reality competition lets greed take center stage as 11 contestants fight for $250,000.




The Trust: A Game of Greed is a thrilling new reality TV competition series coming to Netflix soon, and here’s what to know about its premiere date, the host, the cast, and the trailer. The Trust pretty much describes its premise through its name. The Netflix show brings together a group of strangers and gives them a once-in-a-lifetime offer that is hard to resist. They have to divide $250,000 equally among themselves. However, the question is whether they will play fair or get greedy about winning more and vote each other out.




No one has to be eliminated from The Trust. However, the total prize pot will increase as the number of people in the game starts decreasing. A single vote is enough for a contestant to get the boot, further sowing the seeds of mistrust among the group. The cast members will go through a series of tests that will expose the team players and the traitors to the rest. The Trust is the ultimate test of human nature, and greed is what will eventually tear the relationships made in the villa apart because not everyone can leave as winners with backstabbers among them.
