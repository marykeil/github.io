## Literature Review
Andor season 1 ended with an explosive finale, leading many to wonder what season 2 has in store for the characters of Star Wars’ most exciting show.




Andor season 2 is one of the more highly-anticipated upcoming Star Wars TV shows, meaning many questions are being asked about the project. Initially, Andor was intended to last five seasons, before being confirmed as two seasons leading into the events of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. With Andor season 1 featuring a few relatively self-contained story arcs before culminating in the finale, Andor season 2 is expected to more closely resemble Rogue One, both in terms of its titular character and the show&#39;s timeline.




Originally, Andor season 2 was expected to be released in 2024. This was thrown into doubt when the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023 forced production to shut down. Since then, some updates have been provided about the status of Andor season 2. Moving away from the show&#39;s productions, there have only been a handful of clues about the second season&#39;s plot that promise a continuation of Andor season 1&#39;s ending all while tying into Rogue One. In light of 2024’s Star Wars movies and shows being announced, here is everything there is to know about Andor season 2.

 The Latest Andor Season 2 News 
Filming on Andor season 2 is surely a priority for Lucasfilm
          




Andor season 2 has been confirmed, but news is sparse. Andor season 2 began filming in November 2022 but it was forced to shut down when it had just two weeks of filming left. It&#39;s currently unclear when Andor will resume production once more, but it is reasonable to assume this will be a priority for Lucasfilm. Given that the 2023 strikes ended in close proximity to the holiday period of that year, it is likely that Andor season 2 will resume filming in the first quarter of 2024.



Andor season 2 will be split into four three-episode installments, each depicting a 12-month period that is important to the development of the Rebel Alliance.




Regarding the story of Andor season 2, there have been a few teases and hints. Showrunner Tony Gilroy has confirmed that Andor season 2 will be split into four three-episode installments, each depicting a 12-month period that is important to the development of the Rebel Alliance. The story will include Yavin 4, the jungle planet that served as the base of operations for the Rebel Alliance in Rogue One and the first Star Wars movie, which makes sense as the show heads toward 0BBY in the Star Wars timeline. Meanwhile, Gilroy has strongly hinted Andor season 2 will finally introduce Cassian&#39;s droid K-2SO, telling his origin story.




In December 2023, Star Wars&#39; 2024 slate confirmed Andor season 2&#39;s delay. A release from Lucasfilm confirmed that the only 2024 TV shows coming from a galaxy far, far away would be The Acolyte, Skeleton Crew, Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3, and Tales of the Jedi season 2. As a result of this confirmation, it was similarly confirmed that Andor would not hit the initially planned 2024 release date and will instead likely be released in 2025 after completing production.



 Andor Season 2 Has Been Confirmed 
Cassian Andor&#39;s full story will be told
          

It&#39;s little surprise Andor was renewed, as both Star Wars fans and critics alike agree it is arguably the best Star Wars Disney&#43; show so far. Andor season 2 was confirmed pretty early on in the game, along with the fact that it will be the final installment to the series. Since Andor season 2 leads directly into the events of Rogue One, Cassian&#39;s story can be completed officially thanks to the standalone Star Wars feature film ending his journey with his tragic death on the beaches of Scariff.






 Andor Season 2 Cast 
The cast of Andor will return
         

 The cast of Andor will return in season 2. This includes some unexpected returns, with hints even Andy Serkis&#39; Kino Loy will be back in action. Here are the main cast and characters expected in Andor season 2:

 Andor Actor  Star Wars Character   Diego Luna  Cassian Andor   Stellan Skarsgård  Luthen Rael   Genevieve O&#39;Reilly  Mon Mothma   Forest Whitaker  Saw Gerrera   Faye Marsay  Vel   Varada Sethu  Cinta   Adria Arjona  Bix Caleen   Joplin Sibtain  Brasso   Kyle Soller  Syril Karn   Denise Gough  Dedra Meero   Andy Serkis  Kino Loy   








 Andor Season 2 Story Details 
Andor season 2&#39;s plot is still a mystery
          

In terms of Andor season 2&#39;s story, details are a little more scarce. However, some lingering plot points left over in the Andor season 1 finale hint at the plot of season 2, as can some wider knowledge of the Star Wars universe. Similarly, the showrunner Tony Gilroy has mentioned that Andor season 2 will feature the titular character learning how to become a leader as well as finding out just how difficult it is to build the Rebellion. Given how Andor season 1&#39;s final scene saw Cassian finally embracing the Rebellion by joining Luthen, these comments from Gilroy make a lot of sense.

With Cassian now an official part of Luthen&#39;s team, he will have firsthand experience of building the Rebel Alliance into what it later becomes. Through this, Andor season 2 will almost certainly feature the first meeting of the titular character and Genevieve O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Mon Mothma, a close ally of Luthen. Speaking of Mothma, her continued efforts to stay hidden from the eyes of the Emperor all while building the Rebellion will be a big focus, as will the ramifications of introducing her daughter to Davo Sculdun&#39;s son in the finale.




This could lead to big moments known to come from Mon Mothma in Andor season 2. In Star Wars Rebels, it was revealed that Mon Mothma left Coruscant and officially formed the Rebel Alliance after the Ghorman Massacre. This event could be highlighted in Andor season 2, as could several other interesting, exciting, tension-filled moments that allow the Rebel Alliance to become the Empire-fighting force it is in the original Star Wars movie.

               Andor   Summary:   Diego Luna stars as Cassian Andor in Andor, a Disney&#43; exclusive series set five years before Rogue One. The series follows the titular character as he transitions from a humble thief to a revolutionary icon of the rebellion against the empire. Cassian, a man who tries to keep himself out of confrontations post the destruction of his world, is shoved into the central conflict as he naturally slots into the role of leader. Andor will explore the rebellion&#39;s burgeoning days and highlight pivotal events in the Star Wars Franchise before the construction of the Death Star.
