## Literature Review
Perhaps the most exciting prospect of Star Wars’ 2024 TV shows is one project taking the franchise where it has never gone before in live-action.




One Star Wars TV show will take the franchise somewhere it has never gone before in live-action: Star Wars: The Acolyte. The Acolyte was first announced in December 2020 and is written by creator Leslye Headland. The show will introduce a whole host of new characters via The Acolyte&#39;s Star Wars cast and is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing projects of Lucasfilm&#39;s in 2024.




The Acolyte&#39;s enticing story is mostly open to interpretation until more is revealed about the show. Serving as one of two upcoming Star Wars TV shows in 2024, at least in live-action, The Acolyte has had several tidbits of confirmed information thus far that prove it to be such an exciting prospect. From the revelation that the Disney&#43; show will take live-action Star Wars to a point on the timeline it has never been before to the announcement of what exactly the premise of the show is, the directions The Acolyte is taking a galaxy far, far away in 2024 are supremely compelling.


 The Acolyte Will Introduce The End Of The High Republic Era 
          

The first reason 2024 is so exciting for Star Wars is that The Acolyte will explore the waning days of the High Republic. The High Republic era in Star Wars was first introduced via a series of interconnected books, novels, and comic books released by Lucasfilm. Since then, the era has grown in popularity leading to Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures - a family-friendly show set in the era - and The Acolyte which will take the franchise to the High Republic for the first time in live-action. The High Republic has also played a part in recent video games, including elements in 2023’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.




The Acolyte has a confirmed setting of 100 years before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace meaning it will detail how the High Republic transitioned into the era of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. This means that familiar faces like Yoda, Oppo Rancisis, and Yarael Poof could appear in The Acolyte as all three were part of the Jedi Council during the High Republic era. Regardless, the prospect of seeing the High Republic translated into live-action after only being written in novels or animated in comics is incredibly exciting.



 For The First Time, A Star Wars TV Show Will Star The Sith 
         

Another, perhaps even more exciting aspect of The Acolyte is that the show will delve into the secrets of the Sith. In Star Wars&#39; long history, the Sith have always been shown as antagonists. As such, their behind-the-scenes manipulations and direct confrontations with the Jedi have only ever been explored from the perspective of the Order. With The Acolyte, this is destined to change as the show promises to get to the gritty, dark truth behind the Sith’s rise in the High Republic Era.




The official synopsis for The Acolyte on StarWars.com reads:


&#34;The Acolyte is a mystery-thriller that will take viewers into a galaxy of shadowy secrets and emerging dark-side powers in the final days of the High Republic era.&#34;


As evident by this premise, it is clear that the dark side entities of the High Republic will be explored in the 2024 Disney&#43; show. Aside from brief insights into Anakin Skywalker&#39;s psyche, the Sith perspective has long been absent from Star Wars, making The Acolyte&#39;s 2024 promises all the more tantalizing. Going into the first half of 2024, more news will likely be given on actors, characters, and stories from The Acolyte that will explore these dark facets of Star Wars.



 The Latest Star Wars Book &amp; Comic Characters Are Coming To TV At Incredible Speed 
          

While Star Wars TV is no stranger to introducing characters from previous animated efforts or other books, The Acolyte will take the franchise where it has not gone before if only due to the incredible speed in which some High Republic characters will make the transition. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, it was revealed that Rebecca Henderson would be joining the cast of The Acolyte, with the character she will be portraying catching the eye of many High Republic fans. The character Henderson will be bringing to life in The Acolyte is Vernestra Rwoh, a fan-favorite character from several High Republic books and comics.




Vernestra Rwoh was first mentioned chronologically in Claudia Grey’s book, The High Republic: Into the Dark before appearing in Light of the Jedi. These stories take place in Phase I of the High Republic with Vernestra then appearing across Phases II and III also. The Acolyte will mark the quickest turnaround in Star Wars history between a character appearing in comics or books before appearing in a live-action property. Another notable character in which this happened was The Mandalorian&#39;s Cobb Vanth, though the turnaround was not at this incredible speed. As such, The Acolyte continues to promise to take Star Wars in bold new directions in a myriad of ways.
