## Literature Review
In ATLA, Sokka usually wears a blue tunic that cosplayers enjoy recreating, in ways that demonstrate him to be more than just the &#34;boomerang guy.&#34;




One of the most beloved characters from Nickelodeon&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender, Sokka is so much more than just a guy with a boomerang. Sokka is characterized as the &#34;Gaang&#39;s&#34; planner and joker, providing logistical support like navigation and scheduling, as well as a constant stream of jokes. He is the more carefree counterpart to his serious-minded sister Katara but also proves himself to have a more practical mindset than the optimistic Aang. While Sokka was initially the &#34;boomerang guy,&#34; he developed his skill set and eventually became a skilled swordsman.
Sokka cosplayers recreate the different outfits Sokka wears throughout the series, including all his weapons of choice and other accessories. They sometimes design original variations, including modern and minimalist takes on Sokka&#39;s standard look. Cosplayers also perfectly capture Sokka&#39;s personality and his relationships with the other characters in the photos they share on social media. With the release date for Netflix&#39;s live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender TV show drawing closer, fans are eager to create and share cosplays of Sokka and his friends.



 9  Detailed Sokka 
A more intricate version of Sokka&#39;s basic outfit.


Throughout the series, Sokka wears a blue tunic, along with furs when he and the characters are in colder environments. Most of the time, the characters wear the colors of the elements associated with their home. Therefore, Sokka and Katara usually wear blue because they are members of the Southern Water Tribe. In the live-action Avatar show, Sokka wears more complicated versions of his original outfits. Similarly, @mrpaultran dons a more detailed version of Sokka&#39;s getup, with embellished and fur-lined pieces.@mrpaultran&#39;s costume design is based on another fan&#39;s artwork.





 8  Improvised Sokka 
Sokka&#39;s simple outfit can easily be adapted.


Sokka&#39;s blue tunic is simple and flexible, making it perfect for his adventures with the Gaang and occasional battles with soldiers from the Fire Nation. It can also be easily cosplayed in a variety of ways. @estelablancoa calls their Sokka cosplay &#34;improvised,&#34; comprising an on-hand light blue shirt and a basic recreation of the necklace Sokka usually wears. The different type of fabric contributes to a new but recognizable version of Sokka. While Sokka occasionally adopts other looks, such as his temporary Sherlock Holmes-like getup in &#34;Avatar Day,&#34; most of his outfits look like he put on the first thing he could find.

Sokka is one of the most hilarious, courageous, and ingenious characters in Avatar: The Last Airbender, and he has many episodes that prove it!





 7  Sokka Hanging With Zuko 
Sokka and Zuko have some memorable adventures together.


Sokka and Zuko undertake a mission together to rescue Sokka and Katara&#39;s father Hakoda from the Boiling Rock prison. Aside from some initial awkwardness, Sokka and Zuko quickly develop an easy dynamic. Sokka teases Zuko as he does with every other member of the Gaang, and Zuko is comfortable talking to Sokka. For instance, he tells Sokka about his relationship with Mai and asks for advice when he tries to gain Katara&#39;s trust. @zales_starlight and @holygrailcosplay wear classic Sokka and Zuko costumes while capturing the characters&#39; friendship. @zales_starlight&#39;s Sokka cosplay also includes some subtle water patterns on the lining of their tunic, which is a nice touch.





 6  Battle Ready Sokka 
Sokka plays an important role in &#34;Day of the Black Sun.&#34;


The Gaang reunites with Hakoda to launch an attack on the Fire Nation on the Day of the Black Sun. For the invasion, Sokka conceptualizes submarine-like vessels, so their forces can enter the Fire Nation without being immediately attacked. During this two-episode arc, Sokka wears the Southern Water Tribe soldier&#39;s uniform, like his father and the others. Sokka wears this outfit again for the show&#39;s finale, which focuses on the final battle against Fire Lord Ozai&#39;s army. @riverlacenti wears a great cosplay of this outfit that includes Sokka&#39;s &#34;space sword&#34; and boomerang.





 5  Cactus Juice Sokka 
&#34;Drink cactus juice. It&#39;ll quench ya. Nothing is quenchier. It&#39;s the quenchiest!&#34;


One of Sokka&#39;s funniest moments is the famous and oft-quoted &#34;cactus juice&#34; incident. When the Gaang are stranded in the Si Wong Desert without Appa, Sokka proposes that they drink cactus juice to stave off dehydration. Sokka and Momo drink the cactus juice and subsequently experience mild hallucinations, leading to some of Sokka&#39;s other funniest lines such as &#34;Who lit Toph on fire?&#34; and &#34;I have a natural curiosity.&#34; @theelfinartist wears the classic costume and poses as Sokka drinking from a &#34;cactus,&#34; before re-enacting some of Sokka&#39;s stretches, featuring @viker20 as a confused-looking Aang.







 4  Sokka Hyping Up Katara 
Sokka and Katara are a perfect sibling duo.


Sokka is consistently the sillier sibling, while Katara is more threatening. While they are looking for a bending master to teach Aang Earthbending, they get into a fight with some entitled students at the Earthbending Academy and Katara freezes them both. When the group comes back the next day, the students immediately tell the group where they might find the Blind Bandit. Katara has the last word by warning them that she has her eye on them, while Sokka elevates the moment by simply saying &#34;Water Tribe.&#34; @arroxpegaooo and @DidsRainfall perfectly recreate this scene, while also both wearing great cosplays.





 3  Sokka With Suki And Katara 
This cosplay highlights Sokka&#39;s most important relationships.


Katara is doubtlessly one of the most important people in Sokka&#39;s life. The siblings have been through everything together, including the loss of their mother and their father leaving to fight the Fire Nation. Sokka even says that Katara is almost like a mother to him because she is so caring. Sokka also starts dating Suki later in the series. Suki is vital to Sokka&#39;s story because she calls out his assumption that girls can not fight, inspiring Sokka to be a better person. Cosplay photographer @azproductions shares some excellent cosplays of Sokka, Katara, and Suki, featuring Sokka posing with his sister and his girlfriend.





 2  Modern Sokka 
Sokka with a graphic tee and a letterman&#39;s jacket.


@nimblenoor demonstrates the versatility of Sokka&#39;s look with their modern cosplay, based on artwork by @punziella. The tee shirt features the symbol associated with the element of water. The back of the letterman&#39;s jacket depicts Tui and La, who symbolize Yin and Yang and take the form of koi fish in Avatar. This alludes to Sokka&#39;s first love interest in the series, Princess Yue of the Northern Water Tribe. Yue sacrifices herself to resurrect Tui, the spirit of the moon, in the season 1 finale. This cosplay incorporates many important symbols from the show â€“ yet it also makes it possible to imagine Sokka as an average high school student.

Sokka may have been the Gaang&#39;s comic relief, but he was also the brains of the team, and he had many amazing ideas along their travels.




 1  Sassy Sokka 
Sokka&#39;s best faces.


Sokka is the established jokester of the Gaang in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Sokka spends some time away from the group learning swordsmanship from Piandao, and the others are distraught because they cannot come up with plans or jokes to match Sokka&#39;s. Not only does Sokka make cheesy jokes but also funny faces. @rerenga_cosplay dresses up as Sokka with a particularly good recreation of Sokka&#39;s necklace and captures some of Sokka&#39;s sassiest, funniest faces and poses. Cosplays like this demonstrate all aspects of Sokka&#39;s character, from his humor to his bravery.
