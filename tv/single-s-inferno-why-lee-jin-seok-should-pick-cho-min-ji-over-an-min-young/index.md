The hit South Korean dating show Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 is currently streaming on Netflix, and Lee Jin-Seok has found himself in a love triangle with An Min-Young and Cho Min-Ji. This season started with a whole new group of young, gorgeous men and women stuck on a &#34;Hell Island.&#34; They have minimal supplies, cook their food outside on a fire, and sleep in shipping containers. The only way off the island is to couple up with another single. If a couple manages to make a successful match, they&#39;ll go to &#34;Heaven Island&#34; for the night, a luxurious hotel with amazing accommodations, food, and more.




Cafe owner Jin-Seok hit it off with Pilates instructor An Min-Young right away. The two matched up during the premiere episode of Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 and spent the first night together in paradise. When Jin-Seok expressed his interest too enthusiastically, she pulled away, but when aspiring newscaster Cho Min-Ji joined the cast and picked Jin-Seok to take to paradise, Min-Young was obviously jealous. Both women want Jin-Seok, but here&#39;s why he should choose Min-Ji over Min-Young.

 Min-Young Plays Games 
          

Min-Young said she came to the inferno to find an exciting love. On day one, after meeting several Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 cast members, Jin-Seok and Min-Young chose each other for paradise. Their date went well, and their chemistry was undeniable. They watched the sunset together, and they later swam in the pool. Jin-Seok giving Min-young a piggyback ride was the most physical contact between contestants this season. Back at the inferno, Jin-Seok told her he intended to focus solely on her, but Min-Young didn&#39;t like that the rest of the cast was already treating them like a couple. She told Jin-Seok that she wanted to talk to the other men. 






 Min-Ji And Jin-Seok Have Chemistry 


 
When Min-Ji arrived on the island, she was immediately interested in Jin-Seok, which created a Single&#39;s Inferno love triangle. After meeting all the men, she was allowed to choose two to take to paradise. She chose Jin-Seok and Choi Min-Woo, but it was clear that she was more interested in Jin-Seok. They connected, and Jin-Seok was charmed by the new girl. Once Min-young saw that another woman wanted Jin-Seok, she was immediately jealous. After he got back from paradise, Min-Young bared her heart to Jin-Seok, but he expressed ambivalence about his feelings for her.



 Min-Young May Drive Min-Ji Away 
          

Min-Young runs hot and cold. Though she has every right to want to get to know all the men before making her decision, she should let Jin-Seok do the same. Instead, she pressured him and tried to lock him down, which she had accused him of doing to her. Min-Young&#39;s behavior made Min-Ji uncomfortable. She jokingly told Jin-Seok that she didn&#39;t know he practically already had a wife at the inferno. She revealed that she was miffed because she liked him. There are still a few episodes left in Single&#39;s Inferno season 3. Hopefully, Min-Young&#39;s indecisive behavior will make Jin-Seok realize that Min-Ji is the better choice for him.






Single&#39;s Inferno is streaming on Netflix. Episodes 8 and 9 drop on Tuesday, January 2, 2024. Episode 10 drops on Tuesday, January 9, 2024.
