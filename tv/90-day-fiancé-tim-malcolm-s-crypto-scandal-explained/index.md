## Literature Review
Tim Malcolm considers himself a cryptocurrency genius and wants to help others with his knowledge, but many 90 Day Fiancé fans don’t trust him.




Tim Malcolm from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise is garnering negative attention on social media. The 43-year-old reality star is known for numerous appearances in the 90 Day Fiancé network. He’s popular for being a former cast member, a Tell All host, and a Pillow Talk commentator alongside his best friend, Veronica Rodriguez. Tim has appeared on different 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs over the years. He’s popular for appearing on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 3 and 90 Day: The Single Life. He’s famous for his quick-witted nature, unique presence, and hilarious banter with Veronica.

 All About Tim’s Crypto Class 

 




While Tim seems like a great guy, he has begun rubbing many 90 Day Fiancé fans the wrong way. Over the months, he has been associating himself with cryptocurrency, which has damaged his prestige. Tim has been pro-crypto since the craze began in 2020. He has promoted NFTs and told his followers to invest in cryptocurrency, putting himself forth as a “crypto enthusiast.” Unfortunately, things have changed drastically over the last two years after the crypto market’s crash. People now consider the topic a taboo, which is why Tim’s recent attempt at promoting his “crypto class” didn’t go well.



 Tim Allegedly Posted Proof Of His Income 
          

Tim has encouraged his followers to attend his $129 private Zoom call to excel at crypto trading. He has claimed that his portfolio for NFTs and crypto has gone over “100% in 3 weeks” and continues to go up. Unfortunately for him, many fans are no longer falling for it. They feel the former 90 Day Fiancé franchise cast member is running a scam and earning money by misinforming people. Recently, Tim took to his Instagram to shut down the critics once and for all. He posted a video showing the screen capture of his $120k portfolio, which had gone up 37% in a week.






 Tim Can&#39;t Build Trust With Fans 
          

Tim did his best to diffuse the situation and make people trust his word. However, many people still left negative comments on his post, stating that he’s “broke” and “resorting to scams to get money.” Tim isn’t at fault for people’s lack of faith in crypto. In the last year, the volatile market has dwindled significantly, leaving a sour taste in everyone’s mouths. Popular celebrities like Stephanie Matto, Logan Paul, and many others have been in one or the other NFT or crypto scandals. Therefore, fans can’t trust social media influencers with their get-rich-quick schemes. People probably don’t want a 90 Day Fiancé franchise celebrity advising them about their hard-earned money.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
