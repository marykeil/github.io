## Literature Review
After just two seasons on Max, fan favorite pirate rom-com Our Flag Means Death has been cancelled, putting an end to Stede and Ed&#39;s story.




Our Flag Means Death has been cancelled by Max after two seasons. Starring a hilarious cast of pirates played by Rhys Darby, Taika Waititi, Con O’Neill, Joel Fry, Matthew Maher, and Nathan Foad, the show explores the world of early 18th century pirates, weaving adventurous and romantic tales along the way. Our Flag Means Death first aired in 2022, with season 2 debuting in the fall of 2023.




Now, Our Flag Means Death and its potential season 3 has been cancelled at Max. Showrunner David Jenkins confirmed the news in an Instagram post, which can be seen below:


 

Per Deadline, the first two seasons will reportedly remain on the platform despite Warner Bros. Discovery removing cancelled content recently. A representative from Max said the following:


“While Max will not be moving forward with a third season of Our Flag Means Death, we are so proud of the joyous, hilarious, and heartfelt stories that creator David Jenkins, Taika Waititi, Rhys Darby, Garrett Basch, Dan Halsted, Adam Stein, Antoine Douaihy and the entire superb cast and crew brought to life. We also thank the dedicated fans who embraced these stories and built a gorgeous, inclusive community surrounding the show.”






 Our Flag Means Death’s Cancellation Was Predictable (But Still So Unfortunate) 
         

While Our Flag Means Death’s cancellation is disappointing, this news does not come as a complete surprise. After a well-received season 1 on Max, Our Flag Means Death season 2 was met with a series of production challenges including budget cuts, which Jenkins reported to be a 40% decrease. These changes meant that the series had to entirely alter their plans for season 2, leaving the production more rushed.

While these budget cuts were a harbinger of demise for Our Flag Means Death, the show’s sophomore season proved just how much potential it had. With season 2, Jenkins and his team managed to create eight compelling episodes that told their story well within the show&#39;s now-limited means. With just one more season of Our Flag Means Death, which the creators had hoped for, perhaps Jenkins could have brought the series to a more satisfying close with more planning.




That said, Our Flag Means Death season 2&#39;s ending included a number of elements that make it an acceptable conclusion to the series. O’Neill’s beloved character Izzy was killed off, giving a sense of closure to one storyline as his companions emotionally said goodbye. The final episode also has an ambiguous sense of finality, as Ed and Stede retire from pirate life to become innkeepers. Though its cancellation after two seasons may come as a huge disappointment to many, Our Flag Means Death is at least not leaving any major cliffhangers.
