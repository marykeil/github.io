## Literature Review
Exclusive: Screen Rant offers a first look at the winners of the 3rd annual Astra TV Awards’ Astra TV Icon and Artisan Spotlight awards.




The Hollywood Creative Alliance’s third Astra TV Awards ceremony is set for January 8th, 2024. The awards recognize outstanding achievements in the world of television—both network and streaming—with a wide range of shows, stars, and platforms represented. Nominees in their respective “Best Series” categories include Succession, Ted Lasso, What We Do in the Shadows, Weird: The Al Yankovic Movie, and Beef; many of the series represented at the Astra TV Awards are also serious contenders at the delayed 2023 Emmys, which will take place the following week.




The Hollywood Creative Alliance has revealed two of the creators set to be honored at the upcoming Astra TV Awards. The first is writer, director, and showrunner Eric Kripke, who will receive the Astra TV Icon award for his work developing, writing, and writing hit television series including Prime Video’s The Boys and Gen V. Being honored with the inaugural Artisan Spotlight Award is Emmy-nominated composer Ariel Marx, who scored the 2022 series A Small Light for National Geographic. Screen Rant interviewed Ariel Marx about the series, and how she brought modern musical stylings to the story of Anne Frank and Miep Gies, the woman who hid her and her family.

                  The Boys Season 4’s Trailer Breakdown: 8 Biggest Story Reveals   The Boys season 4 teaser trailer has just been released, and there are a lot of details to be gleaned from the 1-minute 50-second clip.    

The Astra TV Awards can be watched on KNEKTtv and the HCA YouTube channel beginning at 5pm PDT on January 8th.





 Astra TV Awards Has A Longer History Than You Think 
         

The Astra TV Awards may only be in its third year, but the roots of the event date back to 2016 when what is now known as the Hollywood Creative Alliance was founded as the Los Angeles Online Film Critics Society. In 2019, the organization was renamed to the Hollywood Critics Organization; it wasn’t until 2023 that the group became known as the Hollywood Creative Alliance. While the January 8th awards ceremony is the 3rd Astra TV Awards, it is the first with that name, as the ceremony was previously known as the Hollywood Critics Association TV Awards.

As with prior years, the Astra TV Awards boasts an impressive list of presenters who will hand out the night’s coveted awards. Antony Starr and Jack Quaid, the actors behind some of The Boys’ best characters will present awards, which is fitting given Kripke’s spot as a guest of honor. Other presenters include Emily Swallow (The Mandalorian), Sophie Thatcher (Yellowjackets), Terrence Terrell (Obliterated), and Abigail Spencer (Extended Family).




For the 3rd Astra TV Awards, the shows with the most nominations are Yellowjackets with 11 and Party Down with 10. The Boys and Abbott Elementary each received nine nominations. Last year, the best comedy and drama series both went to some of the best Apple TV&#43; shows, with Ted Lasso winning Best Comedy Streaming Series and Severance winning Best Drama Streaming Series. Although Yellowjackets and Party Down have plenty of chances to win, competition is certainly stiff; watch the broadcast to find out who comes out on top.



The 3rd annual ASTRA TV Awards will take place on Monday, January 8th. They can be streamed on KNEKTtv and the HCA YouTube channel.
