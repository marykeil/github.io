## Literature Review
Newcomer 90 Day Fiancé cast member Sam Wilson hasn&#39;t told his partner Citra about a shocking secret on season 10. His past keeps haunting him.




90 Day Fiancé star Sam Wilson is keeping a secret from his fiancé Citra that could potentially end their relationship. Sam is a season 10 newcomer. He is 30 years old and is from Cameron, Missouri. Citra is a 26-year-old living in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. Sam met Citra on a dating app over three years ago. Citra had reached out to Sam first, and although he thought she was hot, he didn’t get attached to her right away. Sam thought Citra was easy to talk to and had a great personality. Sam met Citra in person two years later in Indonesia.




Sam didn’t have money for a ring, but he still proposed to Citra. Now, Citra is coming to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. Citra is Muslim and her faith is important to her. It’s something that Citra discussed with Sam before they started getting serious. Sam was going to have to convert to Islam if he had to marry Citra. Sam grew up with a religious Christian mother and a dad who believed in aliens. He is an atheist, nervous about how hard it is to live by the strict rules he would have to follow. However, there was something else that was bothering Sam on 90 Day Fiancé.

 Sam Got Addicted To Opiates At 15 Years Old 
          

Sam sleeps in his car. He works double shifts and “it&#39;s an hour each way”, so it&#39;s easier for him to take naps in his car than do the whole tiresome commute. Sam works for an online retailer where she does stocking work “like a dockworker basically.” It isn&#39;t Sam’s career of choice, but he didn&#39;t have a lot of options because of his past. Sam got addicted to pain medicine when he was 15 years old. He stayed addicted for “quite a few years.”






 Sam Never Had A &#34;Real Relationship&#34; Before Citra 
          

Sam spoke about being a “cold, numb person” when he was on opiates. He never had a real, lasting relationship. Sam was sick every other day because of his addiction, so he could never commit to anything. He described his experience of trying to get drugs and buying them on the street, “getting burned” as a dirty and ugly world. Sam got clean and sober at 22. It has been almost 10 years since then. However, staying sober has been a constant struggle for Sam. He has relapsed a few times, but he knows it’s important that he stays clean for his fiancé Citra.



 Sam Is Keeping A Secret From Citra &amp; Her Dad Herman 

 




Sam told Citra about his drug past a year after they started talking. She looked past everything and loved him. Sam told the 90 Day Fiancé cameras that he’d never believed in himself the way Citra believed in him. However, there is a “secret” Sam is keeping from Citra. He worries that when he tells her, and she tells her dad, he would forbid her from marrying him. Citra’s dad, Herman, is a police officer. Sam revealed it was the fear of her dad that kept him from getting intimate with Citra. Sam has to please Citra’s dad when he comes to the U.S. by making him feel comfortable and taking good care of his daughter.

Sam also has to plan the wedding and figure out his conversion to the Islamic religion. Sam has to make sure Herman sees that he is devout and is following the Islamic way. Sam worries that if he doesn&#39;t get everything done, it will make him look like he is “not a man to her dad,” and Citra will just end up going back with her dad to Indonesia. Sam is under a lot of pressure, but then again, he is hiding something that could end his 90 Day Fiancé relationship with Citra forever.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
