## Literature Review
All TV shows have plot armor to some degree, but some are less afraid of killing off their beloved major and supporting characters than others. 




All TV shows have plot armor to a certain extent, ensuring major characters survive through certain situations where, logically, their deaths would be more than likely. Plot armor is a term used in film and TV to describe where a key character is protected from danger and death by the necessity of the plot. Sometimes, the story just has to keep going, even if that sacrifices some of the show&#39;s realism. However, when TV shows dare to defy this expectation and keep audiences on their toes by doing away with plot armor as much as they can, it produces some of the most memorable and thrilling scenes on television.
There are plenty of times plot armor saved a character’s life in a TV show, leading to disappointing and predictable plots. However, shows like Game of Thrones and The Wire, two series that have been hailed as some of the best television of all time, have dared to kill off their main characters. Some of these deaths include fan favorites, creating some of the most shocking and memorable moments in television history. The unpredictability of any characters&#39; safety keeps the viewers constantly engaged and unsure of what might happen next. There is a genuine sense of risk and suspense, as no character, regardless of their importance to the plot, is guaranteed to make it to the series&#39; end.









 








 10  Primeval (2007) 
The show killed off one of its central characters.
        

Primeval is a British science-fiction series following a group of scientists studying mysterious anomalies in the UK that let creatures from the past and future enter the modern world, as they also try to prevent the world from ending. The show&#39;s later seasons were not afraid to break away from its earlier patterns, even killing off one of its central characters, Nick Cutter. The show&#39;s ability to surprise with significant plot twists, coupled with some of the best visual effects of its time, drew an impressive audience. However, Primeval sometimes tended to shield some key characters from fatal outcomes, regardless of the dangers they faced.
Streaming on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 9  House of the Dragon (2022) 
Many of Fire &amp; Blood&#39;s mysteries are revealed with shocking twists.


 







  House of the Dragon 

 Release Date   August 21, 2022    Cast   Fabien Frankel , Graham McTavish , Olivia Cooke , Gavin Spokes , Sonoya Mizuno , Steve Toussaint , Matt Smith , Matthew Needham , Rhys Ifans , Emma D&#39;Arcy    Main Genre   Fantasy    Seasons   1    Franchise   Game of Thrones    




House of the Dragon season 2&#39;s major change from the books means even fans of George R. R. Martin&#39;s Fire &amp; Blood will be surprised by the events to come in the new season. As Martin has constantly emphasized, not everything in the history books of Westeros is entirely true. Season 1 had a surprising twist when it was revealed that Laenor was alive and had chosen to go into hiding outside the country. The show also reveals other mysteries in the book, like what happened to the Strongs and if Damon killed his wife (yes, he did). However, due to the nature of the show being a Game of Thrones prequel, there&#39;s only so much House of The Dragon can change that wouldn&#39;t contradict canon events in the universe.

Several major character deaths throughout the seasons shocked and saddened fans, including that of the show&#39;s youngest Bishop family member, Etta. However, many viewers criticized the decision to kill off her character as they felt it was premature, sacrificing her potential character arc for an emotional gut punch.

Some of the most shocking deaths in The Sopranos include J. T Dolan&#39;s surprise shooting and Christopher Moltisanti&#39;s murder at the hands of Tony Soprano. However, the best example of this might be the very final note on which the show ended.

Fargo excels at creating complex villains and placing loveable, unique, ordinary civilians in perilous situations.

 5  The 100 (2014) 
Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the show isn&#39;t afraid to kill off key characters.

The CW&#39;s The 100 is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi series known for its high death toll over its 100 episodes. With survival a constant theme, death is always imminent, and no character is entirely safe. Of course, this led to the series unhesitatingly killing off key characters left and right, starting as early as episode 3 of the very first season. Viewers of the long-standing series grew deeply attached to the core characters, making their deaths particularly devastating. Due to the show taking place on an inhabitable version of Earth, these shocking deaths add realism to the harsh, survival-driven world of The 100.

 4  The Wire (2002) 
The show unceremoniously killed off fan-favorite characters.

The Wire is often hailed as one of the best TV shows of all time. The show dives deep into Baltimore&#39;s drug war and its widespread impact on the city. It garnered critical acclaim for its stark realism and complex characters. The show is known for its unexpected character deaths. Among the most poignant deaths is that of Wallace (Michael B. Jordan). The young worker in D&#39;Angelo&#39;s drug operations is sadly killed by his own friends, Poot and Bodie. Another fan-favorite character, Omar (Michael Kenneth Williams), dies at the hands of a young boy in a convenience store. His death is sudden and unceremonious, proving to be quite the gut punch for fans.

 3  Vikings (2013) 
The show is not afraid to kill off its protagonist.
        

 Vikings 

 Release Date   March 3, 2013    Cast   Travis Fimmel , Katheryn Winnick , Gustaf Skarsgård , Jessalyn Gilsig , Clive Standen , George Blagden    Genres   History , Drama , Action    Seasons   6    Network   amazon prime video , History Channel    Streaming Service(s)   Amazon Prime Video , Hulu    




Vikings is a show notorious for its unpredictable character deaths. Despite many characters being based on historical figures, the series often deviates from historical events, making it nearly impossible for even a historian or history buff to predict their fates. Notably, one of the most heartbreaking Vikings deaths is that of the show&#39;s main protagonist, Ragnar Lothbrok. Ragnar dies alone, thrown into a pit of venomous snakes by King Aelle. It feels wrong to watch such an accomplished warrior die in isolation and without glory, making the scene particularly harrowing to watch. Killing off the protagonist is one of the most unexpected moves a TV show can make.
Streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. 






 2  The Walking Dead (2010) 
Spanning 11 seasons, the series has the highest death count of any TV show.

Singleton    Genres   Horror , Thriller , Drama    Seasons   11    Network   AMC    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , AMC Plus    




The Walking Dead is notorious for having the highest death count out of any TV show. Even major characters fall victim to zombies, other humans, and even disease. In fact, by the end of season 11, the original main cast of the show had almost entirely been wiped out. The post-apocalyptic show received both critical acclaim and fan adoration due to its realism, dramatic storylines, and fantastic visual effects. Of course, living in a world infested with zombies is inevitably going to lead to many life-and-death situations. What makes The Walking Dead so special is how it wasn&#39;t afraid to brutally eliminate fan-favorite characters.
Streaming on Netflix. 






 1  Game of Thrones (2011)

After the shocking murder of Ned Stark towards the end of season 1, fans of Game of Thrones quickly realized that the fantasy-medieval show was unlike any other they had seen before. The HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin&#39;s A Song of Fire and Ice book series was an enormous success, spanning 8 seasons. With dramatic and harrowing scenes like The Red Wedding killing off major characters unexpectedly, these moments highlighted the very aspect of what made the show so famous - that some of Game of Thrones&#39; most brutal and horrific deaths would happen at the most unexpected times, and no character was safe.
