## Literature Review
Loren Brovarnik from 90 Day Fiancé season 3 is starting a brand new career after getting her controversial natural mommy makeover in September 2023.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Loren Brovarnik is embarking on a shocking new career after her mommy makeover. Loren is a 35-year-old Florida resident who was first seen on 90 Day Fiancé season 3 with her husband, Alexei Brovarnik. Loren met Alexei during a birthright trip to Israel where he worked as a medic, and he soon came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. Loren and Alexei got married in September 2015 and have welcomed three kids since then. Loren&#39;s back-to-back pregnancies took a toll on her physical and mental health. She dealt with postpartum depression, gestational diabetes, and weight gain.




Loren began her weight-loss journey after giving birth to her third baby, Ariel, in September 2022, and her efforts have proven to be successful as Loren is now debuting as a model (as shared by kimmy_robinson_66.)


 

Loren posted several stories from her first-ever modeling gig as she took her Instagram followers behind the scenes of her shoot. She made a video with three women who chose her to be a model for their campaign. &#34;I&#39;m mom modeling, no like a real campaign you guys, a real model,&#34; an excited Loren revealed. In a different story, Loren gave her fans a tour of the studio and admitted she was &#34;freaking out&#34; and &#34;very, very nervous.&#34;

Loren also posted a video where she was &#34;getting full glam.&#34; She was happy to show her fans the &#34;life of a model&#34; and exclaimed that she couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. One of her videos showed Loren posing for the cameras wearing clothes by the brand called Elan. Loren looked every bit the professional in her black trousers, black crop top, and black booties with a contrasting black and white jacket. Although Loren frequently posted photos and videos of herself working out at the gym, her dramatic weight loss made some fans believe that she was using the drug Oxempic.

Loren kept telling naysayers that she was on a Jenny Craig diet and that&#39;s what helped her rapid weight loss, but not many were convinced. In September 2023, a year after she had her third baby, Loren decided to go under the knife. She underwent a natural mommy makeover which included a tummy tuck, liposuction, and fat transfer. Loren&#39;s body underwent multiple changes after having kids. She revealed she had abdominal diastasis, so she had opted for stomach surgery to bring her muscles back together. Loren had always been open about the changes that she was going through and wanted to take her fans along with her on the journey.




Loren&#39;s hard work has indeed paid off with her now starting a career as a model. Loren won praise as a reality TV star, including an MTV award, and has starred in several 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs documenting her life after her wedding to Alexei. Loren is a regular on Pillow Talk episodes as well and a favorite among her cast members, who look up to her for her successful relationship with her husband. While many of her co-stars may have given up on their marriages, Loren is doing an exceptional job at being a wife, a mom to three, and now, a professional model.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
