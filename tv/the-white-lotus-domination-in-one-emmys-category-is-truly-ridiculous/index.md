The 2023 Emmys were originally set to take place in September of last year at their typical date but the dual WGA and SAG strikes pushed them back to happen instead on January 15, 2024.




The highly-anticipated season 3 of The White Lotus will finally begin production in February 2024 in several luxurious areas of Thailand. Specific filming locations include Bangkok, Koh Samui, and Phuket, which are all major tourist locations in Thailand. After its season 1 setting in Hawaii and season 2 location in southern Italy, The White Lotus season 3 is poised to be the celebrated series&#39; biggest season yet. Cast members for The White Lotus season 3 include Jason Issacs, Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb, Parker Posey, and Natasha Rothwell reprising her season 1 role as Belinda.
