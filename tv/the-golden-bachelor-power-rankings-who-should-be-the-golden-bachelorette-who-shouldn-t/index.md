Summary
 A potential Golden Bachelorette seems likely due to the success of The Golden Bachelor and fans are eagerly awaiting the announcement of who it could be. 
 Patty James may be in the running for The Golden Bachelorette because her son was a former Bachelor lead, but fans don&#39;t know her well enough to determine if she would be a good lead. 
 Sandra Mason, who made it far on The Golden Bachelor, deserves another chance at love and could potentially be the Golden Bachelorette, as she is fun, interesting, and knows what she&#39;s looking for in a partner. 


With The Golden Bachelor coming to an end soon, there is some curiosity surrounding a potential Golden Bachelorette and who she could be. A Golden Bachelorette seems very likely since The Golden Bachelor has done well since its series premiere episode aired in September. Gerry Turner was announced as the lead shortly before The Golden Bachelor season 1 began, and he received nothing but praise from Bachelor Nation. Gerry&#39;s casting is a breath of fresh air as fans of the franchise have only seen what it&#39;s like for people in their 20s and 30s to look for love on this platform.
The making of The Golden Bachelor was confirmed back in 2020, but filming was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For three years, fans have been waiting to see what this series would be like and who could be the lead. Now that it&#39;s finally here, viewers are happy with the outcome and are now hoping for a female spin-off. With the positive feedback The Golden Bachelor has been getting, this seems very likely. As for who the female lead will be, that is still up for debate, and she could come from Gerry&#39;s season.
            
 
 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now 
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?













 








 1  Patty James 
Might Be In Running Because Her Son Matt James Was The Bachelor


 







Even though Patty James was eliminated on night 1, she could still be up for the role of The Golden Bachelorette; however, she might not be a good lead. The reason is she simply didn&#39;t have enough air time to show off her personality. She could be in the running though, due to her son, Matt James, being a former Bachelor lead. However, just because her son was a lead, it doesn&#39;t mean his mom could carry a show too, especially since Bachelor Nation doesn&#39;t know her very well.






 2  Sandra Mason 
Sandra Is Ready To Settle Down
        

Sandra Mason made it far on The Golden Bachelor and enjoyed her time getting to know Gerry. Even though it didn&#39;t work out between them, Sandra deserves another chance at love. In Sandra&#39;s ABC bio, she said she was looking for the one and was hoping he would be Gerry. However, since she was eliminated last week, Sandra could find the one as The Golden Bachelorette. Sandra is fun, interesting, and, at 75 years old, clearly knows what she&#39;s looking for in a partner.





 3  April Kirkwood 
April Smack Talked Gerry Post-Show
 April Kirkwood clearly got the attention of Gerry as she made it all the way to the top 7. It wasn&#39;t surprising as April was fun, cool, and knew how to have a good time. However, April might not make a great Golden Bachelorette after her post-show antics. During the November 2 episode of The Viall Files podcast, April said, &#34;I’m glad he’s not my guy! I don’t look like I belong on a wedding cake with him.&#34; April also admitted that she realized early on that she and Gerry didn&#39;t have a connection, so she &#34;didn’t care what happened.&#34; If April were to be the Golden Bachelorette, she would be there for the wrong reasons.





 4  Joan Vassos 
She Left The Golden Bachelor Early


 







Joan Vassos was a popular cast member of The Golden Bachelor for being so relatable. Not only was she still grieving the loss of her husband, who passed away from cancer in 2019, but she is a dedicated mother to her family. While she and Gerry had an amazing connection during their one-on-one time following a group date, Joan needed to get home to her daughter, who just had a baby. Joan left the show early and wasn&#39;t able to explore a potential happily ever after with Gerry. As The Golden Bachelorette, Joan could find that with another suitor.
            
 
 Is The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner Engaged? (Spoilers) 
Gerry Turner is looking for a second chance at love and a potential wife on The Golden Bachelor. Is there a chance he will leave the show single?









 5  Nancy Hulkower 
Nancy Might Not Be Ready For A Relationship
 Nancy Hulkower immediately had eyes for Gerry when she met him, but she did go through a rough time during the wedding photo group date. Nancy wasn&#39;t ready to find love with Gerry, and he didn&#39;t have a connection with her, so he sent Nancy home early. While Nancy seems like a lovely person, she might not be ready to take that next step with a potential partner. She was clearly still not over her late husband, so it might be best for her to not take on the role as the Golden Bachelorette.





 6  Ellen Goltzer 
Ellen Loves Pickelball
        

Ellen Goltzer made it to the top four on The Golden Bachelor before she was eliminated last week. She had the potential to win Gerry&#39;s heart, but he had stronger connections with other women. Ellen definitely could have made Gerry happy as she is compassionate, funny, and very active, seeing as she is an avid pickleball player. Other suitors could see Ellen as a great partner, and she could find her happily ever after as the Golden Bachelorette.





 7  Kathy Swarts 
Caused Too Much Drama on The Golden Bachelor
        

Kathy Swarts got a lot of air time for her on-screen feud with Theresa Nist on The Golden Bachelor but didn&#39;t receive Gerry&#39;s final rose. While many believe Kathy has the potential to be a great Golden Bachelorette, she caused too much drama during The Golden Bachelor to be considered as the female lead. However, if there&#39;s ever a Bachelor in Paradise for The Golden Bachelor contestants, she would be perfect for that show.





 8  Faith Martin 
Faith Won Gerry&#39;s First Impression Rose
        

Even though Faith Martin is still in the running to win Gerry&#39;s heart, The Golden Bachelor spoilers say she won&#39;t make it to the final 2. If Faith doesn&#39;t make it to the final 2, she would be the ideal Golden Bachelorette. On the regular Bachelor, someone like Faith, who the lead really liked and is beloved by viewers, usually becomes The Bachelorette. Plus, Faith has a lot of personality and can be vulnerable with Gerry, which makes for a great lead. If Faith doesn&#39;t end up with Gerry, she will make the perfect Golden Bachelorette​​​​​.
            
 
 The Golden Bachelor: Signs There Will Be A Golden Bachelorette 
There are signs that ABC&#39;s The Golden Bachelor will produce a spinoff in The Golden Bachelorette since the franchise has several trends.









 9  Susan Noles 
Susan Isn&#39;t Suited For The Golden Bachelorette
        

Susan Noles wasn&#39;t a front-runner on The Golden Bachelor, but she did make it far enough to let her personality shine. Susan has a huge personality, is sweet and caring, and is clearly young at heart. While Susan would make a great lead, she may be too young at heart to be The Golden Bachelorette. Maybe if the show casted younger male contestants, then Susan could possibly be the lead.





 10  Leslie Fhima 
Leslie Once Dated Prince


 







Leslie Fhima is also still in the running to win Gerry&#39;s heart on The Golden Bachelor. However, according to Reality Steve&#39;s Instagram, she doesn&#39;t end up with a proposal from Gerry, so she will likely be ABC&#39;s first pick as The Golden Bachelorette. Not only does she have an interesting past (Leslie once dated Prince), but she is fun-loving and is the definition of young at heart. If anyone deserves this role, it&#39;s Leslie.
The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
