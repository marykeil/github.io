## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Gino Palazzolo&#39;s family is not a big fan of Jasmine Pineda. They have talked inappropriately about her on multiple occasions.




90 Day Fiancé star Gino Palazzolo’s family has made Jasmine Pineda feel bad about herself on several occasions. Gino, 53, from Canton, Michigan, found love online. Gino began a long-distance relationship with Jasmine, 36, from Panama. Gino complained about Jasmine using his money for her cosmetic procedures within minutes of his 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days introduction. Gino was unemployed then due to COVID-19 but was digging into his savings to pay for Jasmine’s expenses. Jasmine used to work as a school teacher but allegedly lost her job when Gino sent her nude photos to an ex-girlfriend to make her jealous, and it got back to Jasmine&#39;s employer.




Jasmine started relying on Gino for everything because she blamed him for making her lose her job. Gino started working again on 90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days season 6 and didn’t entertain Jasmine’s lavish lifestyle. However, that didn’t stop Jasmine from spending her wedding dress allowance on butt implants. This season, Jasmine found out Gino had quit his job so he could spend more time with her during her first year in the U.S., which was shocking to Jasmine, who expected to get her two sons over to America on Gino&#39;s back. Jasmine also had to deal with Gino’s family, who considered her a gold digger.
