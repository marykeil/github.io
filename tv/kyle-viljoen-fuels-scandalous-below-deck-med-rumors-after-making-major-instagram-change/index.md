## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean fans have reason to believe recent rumors about Kyle Viljoen after there&#39;s suspicious activity on his Instagram page.




Below Deck Mediterranean fans suspect the scandalous rumors about Kyle Viljoen are true after he made a shocking change to his Instagram profile. Kyle was introduced in Below Deck Med season 7 in 2022. He joined the cast and worked on the superyacht Home as it sailed around the coast of Malta. He had to deal with an injury onboard after he twisted his ankle and was relieved from his duty by Captain Sandy Yawn. “Drama queen” Kyle was invited back on the yacht for Below Deck Med season 8, and he started stirring the pot even before he stepped on board.




Kyle created unnecessary drama within the interior team by warning Tumi Mhlongo about Natalya Scudder. Fans started to believe Kyle would be the next person fired since he lies and manipulates situations to create drama. Meanwhile, Reddit user Throwaway54438392 noticed that “Kyle’s Instagram is empty.” They asked their fellow fans, “Is it just me or is all his photos gone?” Kyle appears to have deactivated his Instagram profile @kylethebold. Upon accessing the link, a message from Instagram reads, “Sorry, this page isn’t available.” Lanky-Conclusion-952 added, “Possibly deleted it because his sacking episode is due on soon. I hope so anyway,” in the Reddit thread.

 Kyle Viljoen&#39;s Below Deck Med Controversies Explained 
          




Chewy009x commented, “He was saying how the haters weren’t getting to him.” Little23Crow wrote, “I hope his IG acct disappearing means he&#39;s disappearing from the franchise as well.” However, a few fans rubbished the theory. They don’t think Kyle is getting fired because Kyle was invited to BravoCon where he was a part of the Below Deck Med Crew Panel. “And Captain Sandy said she liked him,” explained Dry-Vermicelli-8323. However, Kyle not being invited could also have come across as a spoiler if he was fired. That could have been why he was present at the Bravo convention.


 

It seemed like the 31-year-old would stay away from reality TV and focus on an alternative career such as being a social media influencer after his Below Deck Med season 7 exit. Bravo&#39;s decision to bring him back was questioned, and Captain Sandy was accused of lowering her standards. Kyle didn&#39;t pick a side in Tumi and Natalya’s feud so he could pretend to be a good guy. Tumi trusted Kyle because he came from South Africa like her, while Natalya wanted to maintain a good friendship with Kyle. Tumi soon realized that Kyle could have been after her Chief Stew job. Natalya called Kyle a “horrible human being.”




Creating drama between Tumi and Natalya is not the only controversial thing that Kyle has been caught doing. He was also accused of starting a relationship with charter guest Frank Day in Below Deck Medi season 7 for reality TV clout. He twisted facts and lied about things and came across as a cunning individual. Kyle has proved time after time that he is not to be trusted. In that case, his disappearance from Instagram could also be an elaborate ploy to gain attention, as he continues to create trouble and pit his cast members against each other for his own sinister gains.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
