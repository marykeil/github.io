## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner&#39;s family finally addresses rumors about his ex-girlfriend &#34;Carolyn&#34; after she made shocking claims about Gerry.




The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner, 72, might be getting married to Theresa Nist, but his alleged past continues to haunt him. Gerry was announced as the franchise&#39;s first Golden Bachelor in July 2023. Retired restaurateur Gerry married his high school sweetheart in 1974 and lived a happy life for 43 years with Toni until 2017 when she suddenly died. Gerry made it look like his stint on The Golden Bachelor was his first adult experience with dating. He had never found the one woman he’d spend the rest of his life with. However, it was recently reported that Gerry had a secret three-year romance with an unidentified woman.




As per the U.S. Sun, Gerry’s family is now exposing the truth about his alleged girlfriend, referred to as “Carolyn.” A close family member defended Gerry by claiming, “None of that is true. It’s all out of spite.” They are referring to the reason behind the split between Gerry and his alleged girlfriend in October 2019. Gerry and Carolyn seemingly dated for 10 months and then lived together for one year and nine months, when he allegedly made negative comments about her weight. Gerry had reached out for help with donating his wife’s clothes, but his messages with Carolyn had supposedly turned flirty after they went to dinner as friends.

Gerry’s family member now claims that the reason for Gerry’s split with his ex-girlfriend was different. “She wanted her name on the lease of his lake house. He said no, and that was it for them,” they said, before adding, “I don’t even remember her name.” An article from THR surfaced as The Golden Bachelor finale approached and challenged the narrative that Gerry had not dated anyone in 45 years and had never kissed anyone in the six years since his wife died. As per the outlet, Carolyn was 14 years younger than Gerry. They reportedly met at a mental health clinic in Davenport, Iowa, before Toni’s death.





 

According to Carolyn, Gerry asked her to make the bed before coming to breakfast and split the price of every meal in advance but picked up the tab at restaurants to make it look like he paid. Carolyn alleged that Gerry told her, “I’m not taking you to the reunion looking like that,” while heading to his high school reunion. She believed it was due to her having gained 10 pounds from stress. She claimed she injured her ankle while moving out by falling down the stairs. She said Gerry had accused her of intentionally hurting herself to extend her stay at his place.

Gerry has dismissed the claims. He wants to focus on the positive things happening in his life, especially his wedding to Theresa, which he is looking forward to. Gerry claims he hasn&#39;t had time to look at the expose to see how accurate it is as he&#39;s spending time with his new fiancée. He has to put together a wedding plan and doesn’t have time to waste. Gerry and Theresa, who got engaged during The Golden Bachelor finale, will be getting married in a live ABC wedding special on January 4, 2024.
