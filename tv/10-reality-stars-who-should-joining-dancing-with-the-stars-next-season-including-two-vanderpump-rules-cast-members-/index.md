## Literature Review
A few very popular and entertaining reality TV stars deserve to be on Dancing With The Stars season 33 to show off their dancing skills.




Dancing With The Stars will return in 2024, and there are a few reality TV stars who should appear in it. The dancing competition series is one of the longest-running American reality TV shows ever. It’s popular for featuring top dance acts and many well-known celebrities. Over the years, the series has cast actresses such as Zendaya, Selma Blair, Nicole Scherzinger, and more. At the same time, it has given a platform to reality TV stars like Kim Kardashian, Lisa Vanderpump, Trista Sutter, and more to demonstrate their skills.
Dancing With The Stars is popular for showcasing some of the craziest moments in the show&#39;s history. During DWTS season 9, dancer Derek Hough got the swine flu and couldn’t compete. The virus spread further, and numerous other dancers and celebrities had to step out. The whole season was a danceless disaster. In Dancing With The Stars season 2, rapper Master P joined the show to showcase his dancing skills. However, fans were shocked to see how terrible he was at moving his body to the beat. Hopefully, season 33 has better luck.

Dancing With The Stars returns to ABC with a brand new season. Take a look at the 14 competing celebrities, judges, and release date of season 32.













 








 10  Kalani Faagata 
90 Day Fiancé Season 6
        

There are a few reality TV stars who should try their luck on Dancing With The Stars season 33. One celebrity is Kalani Faagata, known for her journey in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. The mom of two recently appeared on 90 Day: The Last Resort, where she exposed her husband, Asuelu Pulaa, for cheating on her. She opened up about marital issues and stood out as an inspirational and confident woman. Kalani’s stunning looks, body positivity, and past struggles make her an ideal candidate for Dancing With The Stars in 2024.





 9  Winter Everett 
The Family Chantel Season 1-5
        

Winter Everett from The Family Chantel is another great reality star for Dancing With The Stars. Over the years, viewers have seen the Atlanta native overcome her fears and move on from her former partner, Jah. She has also lost over 100 pounds and has become a fitness influencer. Winter is an inspirational and motivational influencer with a bold personality. It will be great to see her flutter her wings and showcase her dancing moves on the stage of Dancing With The Stars.





 8  Chantel Everett 
The Family Chantel Season 1-5


 







Like Winter, her sister Chantel Everett is also a great pick for the dancing competition. The 32-year-old nurse is among the most popular reality TV stars. She debuted on 90 Day Fiancé season 4 and recently filmed the latest season of her spin-off, The Family Chantel. Over the last two years, Chantel has faced several challenges in her personal life and said goodbye to her former husband, Pedro Jimeno. She’s ready to move on, rediscover her passion, and show the world she’s strong. Chantel loves dancing, and Dancing With The Stars is the perfect platform for her post-divorce life.





 7  Jag Bains 
Big Brother Season 25
        

Big Brother 25 winner Jag Bains could also debut on Dancing With The Stars to showcase his radiant smile and colorful dance moves. He not only became the first Sikh contestant in the series but also the first Sikh winner, as he surprisingly won the season. The Washington native is passionate about music and entertaining his fans with his energy. He’s the perfect reality TV star for the dance competition.





 6  Lindsay Hubbard 
Summer House Season 1-7
        

Lindsay Hubbard is known for starring in Bravo’s Summer House. She has a bright personality and a positive attitude. She’s popular for her now-broken engagement to Carl Radke and other relationship rumors. She’s fashionable, sassy, and always full of enthusiastic energy. Her addition to Dancing With The Stars would be a great move for the show.





 5  James Kennedy 
Vanderpump Rules Season 3
        

James Kennedy is another Vanderpump Rules star with the looks and personality of a Dancing With The Stars winner. He’s a reality TV star, a DJ, and a music producer who understands the beats and rhythm. James has the crowd experience needed to pull off anything. If Dancing With The Stars can make a deal with James, he could certainly be one of the most entertaining cast members of the dancing competition series. Even Ariana Madix thinks he&#39;d be great on DWTS.





 4  Kyle Richards 
The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 1-13


 







Kyle Richards would be another great addition to DWTS. She’s the lead star of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and has over two decades of experience in film and television. However, her successful career isn’t the only reason she needs to be on Dancing With The Stars. Kyle is a public figure recently surrounded by divorce rumors from her estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky. She’s a thrill-seeker and could set the Dancing With The Stars stage on fire with her talent. She&#39;d be following in the footsteps of Mauricio, who competed on DWTS season 32.





 3  Tom Sandoval 
Vanderpump Rules Season 1-10


Tom Sandoval is another Vanderpump Rules star who would compete on the show. Since Tom is a musician and could be a decent dancer. Plus, since his ex Ariana competed this past season, he will definitely want to try and show her out next season.





 2  Christine Brown 
Sister Wives Season 1-18


 







Christine Brown is one of Sister Wives&#39; most well-known stars. Therefore, it makes sense for at least one of the cast members to appear on Dancing With The Stars. Christine, who left the polygamous family after spending three decades with them, is an ideal fit for Dancing With The Stars. In 2023, she became the show&#39;s most motivational woman and is now married to the love of her life. Fans love how happy Christine is nowadays, and there’s no better platform than the dancing competition series for her to express her joy.





 1  Gerry Turner 
The Golden Bachelor
        

Gerry Turner could bring it to the Dancing With The Stars stage. The Indiana native might be 72, but his appearance on The Golden Bachelor shows he’s young at heart. The retired restaurateur searched for love on The Golden Bachelor and found it with Theresa Nist. Gerry has a great chance to impact Dancing With The Stars by being one of the oldest The Bachelor stars to appear on it. Over the years, numerous names from The Bachelor franchise have joined the dancing competition series, such as Matt James, Charity Lawson, Gabby Windey, Kaitlyn Bristowe, Hannah Brown, Nick Viall, and more. Gerry should also join to show off his talent.
Dancing With The Stars airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
