## Literature Review
A Games of Thrones star opens up about how their role in the popular HBO fantasy series created a massive problem for their acting career.




Game of Thrones actor Iwan Rheon opens up about how the show created a problem for his career. Based on the ongoing book series by George R.R. Martin, HBO&#39;s massively popular fantasy show follows nine noble families fighting for control of Westeros and the Iron Throne. The series, which aired from 2011 to 2019, featured a few despicable characters, none more so than the psychopathic torturer Ramsay Bolton, who was played by the Welsh actor Iwan Rheon.




Over four years after the fantasy series ended, Rheon opened up about how Games of Thrones created a problem for his career in an interview with Radio Times. Because of his reputation-making role as Ramsay, Rheon has been repeatedly typecast as psychopaths, though he just wants to play a &#34;nice guy&#34; for once. Read his full comments below:


There’s no other way of looking at it. Because of the magnitude of the show, it did loads for my career. But it brought a lot of barriers as well. All of a sudden you’re just getting offered lots of parts where they want you to do the same thing... Well, exactly! I was like: ‘Can I play a nice guy, please?



 What Iwan Rheon Has Done Since Game Of Thrones 
          

After Ramsay Bolton was killed off in Game of Thrones season 6, Rheon&#39;s first role was as one of the most famous psychopaths in history, playing Adolf Hitler in the BBC comedy series Urban Myths. The typecasting continued in 2017 when Rheon was cast as the villain Maximus in Marvel&#39;s short-lived Inhumans series on ABC. After that, Rheon played the Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars in the 2019 film The Dirt who, because of his rockstar lifestyle and condition known as ankylosing spondylitis, was an equally complex character compared to his past roles.




                  Game Of Thrones Cast - Where Are They Now?   The Game of Thrones cast was one of the best ensembles in TV history, with many actors continuing to deliver impressive performances after its ending.    

Rheon was most recently seen in the BBC miniseries Wolf, playing a man who is believed to have murdered a 10-year-old boy during the 1990s. However, the actor plays against type in the upcoming BBC movie Men Up as one of the middle-aged Welsh men who took part in the first clinical trials for the drug that became Viagra. The Game of Thrones actor will also star in Prime Video&#39;s sprawling swords-and-sandals series, Those About to Die, as a wheeler-dealer who runs the gambling and underworld of Ancient Rome.
