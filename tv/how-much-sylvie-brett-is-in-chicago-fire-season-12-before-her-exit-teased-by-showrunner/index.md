## Literature Review

Chicago Fire showrunner Andrea Newman teases how much Sylvie Brett is in season 12 of the long-running drama before her exit in a future episode.




Chicago Fire showrunner Andrea Newman opens up about how much Sylvie Brett appears in season 12 before her exit in a later episode. It was previously announced that Kara Killmer, who has portrayed Brett since season 3, would be exiting the show in its latest batch of episodes. However, it was unclear at the time how many more episodes she would have before leaving the series.




Speaking with TVLine, Newman confirms that Brett&#39;s final episode in Chicago Fire season 12 won&#39;t be happening for quite some time. The showrunner teases her appearance throughout most of the season, while also saying she has plenty of action ahead in her final episodes. Check out what Newman had to say below:


[Kara is] in a good chunk of the season. It’s a rollercoaster for [Brett] this season. She’s got a lot of big action, actually, this year, and she’s making lots of plans that keep having wrenches thrown at them. So she’s readjusting on the fly. But she’s got a lot of great hero stuff this season.



 How Will Brett Exit Chicago Fire? 
          

Chicago Fire season 11 ended with Brett successfully adopting Julia, poised to build a family after struggling all season. However, her boyfriend, Dylan, breaks up with her, prompting Casey to propose to her. The season ends before it is clear what she will say, leaving it as a suspenseful thread that will no doubt be resolved when the show returns.




Since Brett will have a story arc before exiting the show, it&#39;s possible she still hasn&#39;t decided what to do with Casey&#39;s proposal once the series comes back. This may be a difficult decision she&#39;ll have to make, especially since he no longer lives in Chicago permanently. If she does decide to marry him, then it could explain her exit while giving her character arc a satisfying conclusion.

                  Severide Returns &amp; 7 Other Theories About Chicago Fire Season 12&#39;s Story   Chicago Fire season 11 ended on a handful of cliffhangers, including one character’s fate, so there are plenty of season 12 theories to conjure up.   

However, Newman also indicates some of Brett&#39;s plans will face obstacles, indicating her deciding to leave isn&#39;t going to be a simple task. It&#39;s likely the first episodes of Chicago Fire season 12 will focus on how she decides to move out of the city, and what she needs to do in order to prepare. Sticking around for a good amount of the season, though, it appears the series will have plenty of time to set up her farewell.






Chicago Fire will be coming back to NBC on Wednesday, January 17.
