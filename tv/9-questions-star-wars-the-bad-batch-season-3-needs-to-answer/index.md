## Literature Review
As the show&#39;s final season, Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3 has a lot of questions it has to answer, and here are 9 of the most essential ones.




Announced during Star Wars Celebration 2023, Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3 arrives in 2024 and has several major questions to address before the series&#39; conclusion, with many of these questions surrounding both its own original characters and other key Star Wars characters. The conclusion of The Bad Batch will be significant, because it determines the fate of the clones. After the Empire took over following Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, they replaced clone troopers with stormtroopers, leaving the clones without a purpose and, worse still, treated like second-class citizens.
Despite their contributions to the Clone Wars and Palpatine&#39;s successful takeover by carrying out Order 66, the clones are essentially abandoned by the Empire, with many struggling to survive. In the Obi-Wan Kenobi live-action series, a clone trooper veteran begs for money and is seemingly homeless. The series may see this plot point through, ultimately suggesting what comes of the clone troopers, for better or worse. The clone troopers&#39; fate is not the only one on the line in this final season, though; main characters like Omega and Tech have been left in the balance, with Omega kidnapped and Tech presumed dead. Here are 9 questions The Bad Batch season 3 must answer for the sake of Star Wars&#39; future.

 Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 3 Updates: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know 
The season finale of Star Wars: The Bad Batch has major implications for season 3. Here&#39;s everything we know about season 3 and when it will air.



 9  Is Tech Actually Dead? 
The Bad Batch Season 2, Episode 16
        

 One of the most devastating blows of The Bad Batch season 2 was the (apparent) death of Tech, one of the members of Clone Force 99. His death has yet to be confirmed, and Star Wars has a history of bringing characters back from what seemed to be the dead, including major characters like Darth Maul and Boba Fett - who then became essential to certain Disney&#43; TV shows such as The Book of Boba Fett and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Whether Tech really died or not will need to be confirmed before the series finale to give the audience closure, and it really could go either way.





 8  Does Boba Fett Know About Omega? 
The Bad Batch
        

 Boba Fett is alive throughout The Bad Batch, working as a bounty hunter. Because of this, he almost certainly knows about Omega&#39;s existence - if not from his time on Kamino, then because Omega actively had a bounty out for her. This could have major implications for The Bad Batch season 3, particularly if the two connect in some way. As Omega is still kidnapped, this could even include Boba Fett becoming part of her rescue, although that&#39;s unlikely; it isn&#39;t clear what sort of allegiance Boba would feel toward Omega, and he worked for the Empire. He wouldn&#39;t want to wind up on their bad side.





 7  What Happened To Commander Cody? 
The Bad Batch
        

 Commander Cody is a major character in the Star Wars franchise and remains an audience favorite. First appearing in Revenge of the Sith as the clone who receives the initial Order 66 command and shoots at Obi-Wan Kenobi after just handing him back his lightsaber, he became a major player in The Clone Wars series. In The Bad Batch season 2, he reappears, disappointingly still working for the Empire; however, Commander Cody is eventually redeemed, ultimately going AWOL. Given the Empire&#39;s treatment of even the clones&#39; best, Commander Cody deserves positive closure to his story as much as The Bad Batch characters.
It&#39;s difficult to separate Commander Cody from the events of Order 66 because he was such a prominent part of that scene in Revenge of the Sith, but simplifying his character to that connection would be reductive. Commander Cody fought alongside Obi-Wan in the 212th Battalion in the Clone Wars, and he was a major support to the Jedi. It&#39;s clear that the Order 66 inhibitor chip worked extremely well on him; working for the Empire would completely contradict his moral code seen throughout The Clone Wars. Now that he has gone AWOL, viewers might get to see his (hopefully happy) conclusion in the franchise.




 6  What Will Omega&#39;s Fate Be? 
The Bad Batch Season 2, Episode 16


Omega was kidnapped by the Empire in The Bad Batch season 2 in an effort to encourage Nala Se to carry out Palpatine&#39;s plans for cloning. Clearly, Nala Se&#39;s skills and background make her essential to this plan, and her soft spot for Omega is meant to get her to comply, where previously she resisted. Her refusal makes sense given the Empire destroyed Kamino, her home, but it will be interesting to see whether her almost maternal affection for Omega has the desired effect on her. That leaves Omega&#39;s fate in question, though; while she&#39;s presently just a gambling chip, the Empire has proven throughout their Inquisitor initiative and Order 66 that they are happy to kill children.
If Nala Se refuses, this puts Omega&#39;s life at risk; however, it seems unlikely that the series would kill her off. Along with being a beloved character, the Bad Batch team is currently on their way to her, which inspires significant hope about her fate. The only other obstacle to consider is, given Palpatine&#39;s clear interest in cloning, he may want to experiment on Omega to determine why she was an anomalous clone, different from the others in that she&#39;s female and, like Boba Fett, was not subject to advanced aging. This could spell out more danger for her, which could further compromise her life.





 5  What Other Atypical Clones Are Out There? 
The Bad Batch
        

 With both Omega and Boba Fett being unmodified and complete replicas of Jango Fett, the prototype for the clones, it raises questions about what other anomalies in this larger batch of clones might exist. In fact, The Bad Batch season 2 revealed another &#39;sister&#39; of the clones, Emerie Karr. Given that Star Wars continues to reveal clones who fall outside the mold, the possibility is there that the number of those atypical clones is much higher than just three. This could be an exciting development with many new characters and would make sense given that The Bad Batch season 3 will focus so heavily on cloning.





 4  What Will Come Of Nala Se? 
The Bad Batch Season 2, Episode 16
        

 As mentioned, Nala Se is currently being pressured by the Empire to assist in Palpatine&#39;s cloning project, although she was initially refusing. Denying Palpatine what he wants has historically not worked out for those in his opposition, so her continued refusal would surely end in her death, also putting Omega&#39;s life at serious risk. If she does bend to the Empire&#39;s will because of her concern for Omega, this would also make her complicit in future Star Wars events, including those of the sequel Star Wars trilogy, when Palpatine has clearly used cloning to his advantage. This would be a disappointing but unsurprising conclusion for Nala Se.

 3  What Future Can The Bad Batch Have? 
The Bad Batch


Star Wars content set in the Imperial era, particularly The Bad Batch, has made it clear that clones do not have a clear place in this new regime. As deserters, the Bad Batch team seems to have even less of a clear path forward because they are either actively hiding from the Empire or joining in Rebel activity. This has posed concerns for Omega, who is still just a child; the clones of the Bad Batch have wondered if it would be better for her if they went their separate ways so that she could have something like a normal childhood, although Omega opposed the idea.
It&#39;s nice to imagine that the Bad Batch, including Omega, could settle into a more traditional family, free from the violence of the Empire, as clone trooper Cut did. Star Wars isn&#39;t often one to grant domesticity, especially for its main characters, though. Even the most prominent couples in the franchise, such as Padm√© Amidala and Anakin Skywalker or Princess Leia and Han Solo, did not get a happy ending. Of all the characters, however, the clone troopers perhaps deserve the most rest; they were created to fight in a war, weaponized against their friends, and discarded by the Empire. A conclusion providing them with peace would be welcome.





 2  What Are The Lasting Effects Of The Destruction Of Kamino? 
The Bad Batch Season 1, Episode 16
        

In The Bad Batch season 1, Kamino becomes yet another victim of the Empire, with the planet and its people being wiped out by order of Admiral Tarkin. The ramifications of that genocide continued to be explored throughout season 2 of the show, but the aftershocks are still being defined. In addition to having a massive emotional impact on the clones, particularly Omega, this onslaught also made Nala Se less willing to work for Palpatine, which threw a wrench in his plans to explore cloning. However, the destruction of Kamino seems to spell out other problems for the Empire, who attempted to sweep it under the rug.
In response to backlash, the Empire tried to cover up their responsibility for the attack on Kamino by claiming the incident was simply an unfortunate accident. This is interesting and telling because, previously, the Empire was depicted as simply ruthless‚Äîthroughout the original Star Wars trilogy, they destroy planets and populations, such as Alderaan, with very little regard for public image. This choice to lie suggests that perhaps earlier on, the Empire was more fragile, not able to risk outcry about their cruelty. It will be interesting to see if The Bad Batch explores that a bit more, identifying cracks in the Empire&#39;s system.





 1  What Is Palpatine&#39;s True Purpose On Wayland? 
The Bad Batch
        

The pressure for Nala Se to contribute to Palpatine&#39;s work being carried out at the Imperial cloning facility on Wayland&#39;s Mount Tantiss raises questions about what Palpatine wants with Nala Se, but the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker may have already spelled that out. The twist of the movie, that Palpatine is the big bad after all, required significant plot bending, and that hinged on the idea that Snoke was a Palpatine clone and that Palpatine used clones to return. Because Nala Se represents the ability for Palpatine to explore cloning himself, The Bad Batch season 3 will hopefully lead to Star Wars finally explaining the infamous &#34;somehow, Palpatine returned.&#34;
The Bad Batch seasons 1 and 2 are now streaming on Disney&#43;.
