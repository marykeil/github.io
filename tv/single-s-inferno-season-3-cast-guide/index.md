## Literature Review
Season 3 of the Korean dating show is currently streaming on Netflix. Let&#39;s meet the 12 gorgeous singles looking for love.




Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 is currently streaming on Netflix with a new group of young, gorgeous men and women stuck on a &#34;Hell Island,&#34; roughing it with minimal supplies with the hopes of coupling up to go to &#34;Heaven Island.&#34; After the success of seasons 1 and 2, season 3 introduces fans to a whole new cast of hopeful singles looking for love. This season promises love triangles and heartfelt connections among the cast, who all have interesting and dynamic backgrounds.




Though the premise of the show remains the same, producers have changed the format and structure of the show in season 3. Not only have they introduced some new rules, but they added a whole second island with a second set of contestants, which was revealed in a surprising twist during episode two. Regardless of who had coupled up, they knew they would likely be split up at the end of a night in paradise. By the time the two islands merged, there were participants who still had never met each other, which added to the drama and conflict.

 Kim Gyu-ri 
          




The first cast member to be introduced during the premiere episode of Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 was Kim Gyu-ri, a 28-year-old model and Miss Korea 2022 contestant. Though the other contestants immediately saw Gyu-ri as beautiful and formidable, she struggled to make a connection and was left standing alone after the first matching session. On the first night, Gyu-ri was the only woman not to go to paradise but later drew interest from Lee Gwan-hee and Park Min-kyu.



 Choi Hye-seon 

 

The next cast member introduced during the opening minutes of Netflix&#39;s Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 was Choi Hye-seon. The 26-year-old college student at the prestigious Ewha Women’s University majors in bioinformatics in the Life Sciences department. According to Hye-seon&#39;s Instagram (@hazelchoiii), she has also modeled for Korean fashion and beauty brands. Hye-Seon made an immediate match with Lee Gwan-hi and spent a night away from the inferno in paradise. The format of the show makes it hard to predict who anyone will end up with, which makes Single&#39;s Inferno more exciting.






 Choi Min-woo 
          

Choi Min-woo was the first male cast member to be introduced. Min-woo describes himself as “shy and introverted” on the show. Posts on Min-woo&#39;s Instagram (@choimin_woo) reveal that he has modeled, both on the runway and in print, and has even appeared on the pages of Esquire Hong Kong. During the first matching session, he was selected by Gyu-ri, but he chose An Min-young, who chose someone else. Min-woo was left behind, along with Gyu-ri.



 Lee Jin-seok 
          

 Lee Jin-seok is a 31-year-old owner of several cafes in the city of Daegu, where he does everything from baking desserts to brewing coffee. Jin-seok initially matched with An Min-young and the two had a great time in paradise. But when Min-young pulled away to explore other matches, he later moved on with newcomer Cho Min-ji. The format of the show makes it hard to predict, so with five episodes left in Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 to drop, it remains to be seen if Jin-seok chooses Min-young, Min-ji, or someone else entirely.






 An Min-young 

 

The 26-year-old Pilates instructor, An Min-young, owns and runs her own Pilates studio. According to Min-young&#39;s Instagram (@my_floria_) and YouTube channel, she also does some modeling and was crowned Miss Korea Busan 2023. She was immediately popular, being chosen by two men for the first matching session. She chose Jin-seok but felt that he came on too strong. When he moved on later, Min-young was openly jealous. It&#39;s possible she could either win him back or lose him forever.



 Lee Gwan-hee 
          

At 36 years old, Lee Gwan-hee is the oldest contestant on the show. He&#39;s a professional basketball player who plays for the LG Sakers, where he plays the shooting guard position. The extremely confident Gwan-hee initially matched with Choi Hye-seon but later also matched with Yun Ha-jeong, with whom he has chemistry and lively banter that delights the Single&#39;s Inferno hosts. Gwan-he has shown interest in three different women but offended all three of them by pointing them out openly.






 Son Won-ik 
In a surprising twist, the second episode revealed that there was a second Single&#39;s Inferno on a different island with a whole other set of contestants. The first contestant introduced during the second episode was Son Won-ik. Won-ik is a real estate agent who sells luxury real estate, but his Instagram page (@hiwonik) also features shots of various modeling jobs and several marathons he&#39;s participated in. He successfully matched up with Yu Si-eun during the fourth episode, and they spent the night together in paradise. But Si-eun later revealed that she felt that Won-ik didn&#39;t open up enough. With half the season left, Won-ik can still connect deeply with someone. 



 Yun Ha-bin 
          

Actor Yun Ha-bin currently plays a minor role in the popular Netflix K-drama My Demon. During a Single&#39;s Inferno segment that involves contestants secretly giving candy to the men or women they were interested in, Ha-bin was the only contestant to receive a piece of candy from every single female on the island. Though he is very popular, the season is halfway through, and he has yet to form a strong bond with anyone.






 Yun Ha-jeong 
26-year-old Yun Ha-jeong works in the office of a medical clothing company, where she handles customer service and purchasing. Ha-jeong&#39;s Instagram (@hi_jjeong2) also suggests that she has done some modeling work and she was runner-up for Miss Chunhyang 2021. She says that people describe her as a &#34;fox&#34; based on her looks. She also says she&#39;s super popular and is extremely confident in her looks and personality. She matched up with Gwan-hee early on, but he is openly interested in two other women.



 Park Min-kyu 
Park Min-kyu is a police officer and a member of the Korea Coast Guard Special Rescue Team. Min-kyu&#39;s Instagram (@ssrt_mk) showcases his rescue skills and strong swimming abilities. The tall and muscular Min-kyu was instantly popular with the ladies. He has expressed interest in getting to know Gyu-ri better, but so has Gwan-hee, setting up a potential love triangle.



 Yu Si-eun 
         




27-year-old Yu Si-eun is a freelance model in the wedding, fashion, and beauty industries, an influencer, and a media personality who was the first runner-up for Miss Korea 2022. With no shortage of confidence, she says that she has been popular since she was little. She&#39;s also well known for looking a lot like Jennie from the popular K-pop girl band Blackpink. She successfully matched up with cafe owner Won-ik during the fourth episode, and they spent the night together in paradise. But Si-eun later revealed that she felt that Won-ik wasn&#39;t as vulnerable as she had hoped.



 Cho Min-ji 
26-year-old Cho Min-ji joined the series during episode five and caused quite a stir. The aspiring news anchor currently majors in Economics at Ewha Women&#39;s University. Like several of the other female members of the cast, Min-ji was a former Miss Korea contestant. Upon arriving, she was allowed to choose two men to take to paradise. After conversations with all of the men, she chose Min-woo and Jin-seok but hit it off much better with Jin-seok. With five episodes of Single&#39;s Inferno left, Min-ji may stick with Jin-seok or choose someone else.






Single&#39;s Inferno is streaming on Netflix. Episodes 6 and 7 drop on Tuesday, December 26, 2023. Episodes 8 and 9 drop on Tuesday, January 2, 2024. Episode 10 drops on Tuesday, January 9, 2024.
