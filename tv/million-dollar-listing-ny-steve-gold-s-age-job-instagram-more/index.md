## Literature Review
Steve Gold joined the Million Dollar Listing New York series for season six in 2017. It was easy to fall for his good looks and charming personality.




Steve Gold joined the Million Dollar Listing New York series for season six in 2017, and there are some interesting facts about his life. Steve stars in the series alongside Ryan Serhant and Fredrik Eklund and was brought in following the departure of Luis Ortiz. When Steve&#39;s first season began to air, it was easy to fall for his good looks and charming personality. His long, dark hair was also a hot topic among his fellow MDLNY castmates. As the series progressed, Steve presented himself as a top-notch real estate agent with the potential for success on the show. Due to his past career and charm, his career has only grown since the end of his time on MDLNY.




While the MDLNY cast member may be one of the best real estate agents in the Big Apple, his good looks were why many fans tuned into season six. While his attractiveness is always a focus, watching Steve work his magic in the real estate business was also enjoyable. He makes home-buying transactions as simple as possible for his clients while getting the correct property prices. Even though Ryan and Fredrik helped to catapult MDLNY to popularity, as Fredrik now lives in an LA house part-time, Steve contributed to the momentum.
