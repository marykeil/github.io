<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Over the course of seven seasons, many members of SAMCRO were killed in Sons of Anarchy – and here&rsquo;s how and why each one died.</p>
<p>The Sons of Anarchy deaths across its seven seasons helped the show maintain its connection with the Shakespearian tale on which it was based. Created by Kurt Sutter, Sons of Anarchy premiered in 2008 and ended in 2014. It was successful from the beginning, praised for its tone, performances, and the themes it addressed, such as racism and corruption. SOA tells the story of Jax Teller, VP of the motorcycle club Sons of Anarchy, based in Charming, California.</p>
<p>When Jax finds a manifesto written by his late father, he goes on a personal journey that makes him question his path, role in the club, and relationships. His father’s ideas and goals for the club were different from those of the current President, Clay Morrow, which paved the way for a lot of drama and conflict inside the club, the effects of which were felt throughout the series. These conflicts came at a high price, and various members of the Sons of Anarchy MC were killed throughout the series.</p>
<pre><code>              Sons of Anarchy: Why Jax &amp; Clay Both Failed As SAMCRO Leader   The Sons of Anarchy club was led by two people throughout the series: Clay Morrow and Jax Teller, and both failed as leaders. Here's why.   
</code></pre>
<p>Kip “Half-Sack” Epps
Cameron Hayes Stabbed Him And Kidnapped Jax&rsquo;s Son</p>
<p>Kip Epps (Johnny Lewis), best known as Half-Sack, was a prospect in seasons 1 and 2 of Sons of Anarchy. Given his position in the club, he was often asked to do things the other SAMCRO members didn’t want to, such as cleaning around the clubhouse, but he also took part in many of the club’s big jobs. In season 2, he was tasked with watching over Gemma (Katey Sagal) and Tara, but Gemma left to go after Polly Zobelle.</p>
<p>On his way back to Jax’s home, Half-Sack was followed by Cameron Hayes, who entered the house and threatened to kill Maggie Siff&rsquo;s Tara and Abel, Jax’s son. As Cameron was about to kill Abel with a knife, Half-Sack jumped to stop him and was stabbed and killed by Cameron, who then took Abel with him to Ireland.</p>
<p>Eric Miles
Juice Killed Him To Cover For His Betrayal</p>
<p>Following Half-Sack’s death, three new prospects joined the club, and among those was Eric Miles (Frank Potter). Eric was patched into SAMCRO in season 4, and later on, he discovered that Juice (Theo Rossi) had been stealing bricks of cocaine from the warehouse. Juice attacked him, and as Eric pulled out a knife, Juice shot him in the face several times and then framed him for the theft. Eric was stripped of his patch and excommunicated, and it wasn’t until season 6 that his name was finally cleared.</p>
<p>Piermont “Piney” Winston
Clay Murdererd Piney</p>
<p>Piermont Winston (William Lucking), AKA Piney, was a co-founder of the Sons of Anarchy club, one of the First 9, and the father of Harry “Opie” Winston (Ryan Hurst). Disgusted with Clay’s actions after getting the club involved in drug dealing, Piney retreats to his remote woodland cabin. Clay visits him and tries to talk to him about the letters that reveal Clay and Gemma killed John Teller. The conversation turns violent, and Clay shoots and kills Piney. Clay made the murder look as if it was enacted by the Lobos Sonora cartel.</p>
<p>Herman Kozik
Kozik Stepped On A Landmine</p>
<p>Herman Kozik (Kenny Johnson) was a member of the Tacoma chapter of SAMCRO who later joined the main faction. He endured a rough relationship with Tig Trager (Kim Coates) due to the murder of Tig&rsquo;s dog, but after being forced to work together many times, their relationship became much more amicable. When some of the Sons along with the Galindo cartel came across a field of land mines planted by the Lobos, Kozik accidentally stepped on one, unceremoniously killing his character.</p>
<p>Harry “Opie” Winston
Pope Had Prison Guards Beat Opie To Death</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most heartbreaking deaths in Sons of Anarchy was that of Opie, Piney’s son, and Jax’s best friend. Opie’s arc was often marred by tragedy, as he had a rough childhood, his wife was accidentally killed by Tig, and he found his father’s corpse as a boy. As a result, Opie distanced himself from the SAMCRO club for a while but returned right on time as Jax, Chibs (Tommy Flanagan), and Tig were arrested and joined them by attacking the sheriff.</p>
<p>Once in jail, Jax was forced to accept a deal under Damon Pope’s terms, and one of those was having to choose one of his SAMCRO brothers as a sacrifice, so the rest could be free. Jax refused to choose and planned on offering himself, but Opie stepped up and punched one of the guards, thus being forced to become the sacrificed member. Opie is beaten to death by Pope’s in-prison agents, with Jax, Chibs, and Tig watching on as horrified witnesses.</p>
<p>“Filthy” Phil Russell &amp; V-Lin
The Irish Killed Both Men As A Warning</p>
<p>“Filthy” Phil Russell (Christopher Douglas Reed) and V-Lin (Walter Wong) died in Sons of Anarchy season 6 as some of the most graphic deaths in the entirety of the show. Phil was patched in season 5 while V-Lin was still a prospect, and they were at the club&rsquo;s arms warehouse when the Irish (following Jax&rsquo;s dissolved partnership with the Real IRA) arrived. They shoot Phil and V-Lin and proceed to mutilate their bodies, leaving them on display in the warehouse as a warning to SAMCRO.</p>
<p>Otto Delaney
The Prison Guards Shot Him To Death</p>
<p>Otto Delaney (Kurt Sutter) was one of SAMCRO’s most dangerous members. Otto spent most of his time in the series in jail, where his mental health continually deteriorated, making him an increasingly violent prospect. He tricked Tara into bringing him a crucifix which he then used to kill a nurse, who turned out to be the sister of a man named Lee Toric (Donal Logue), who decided to avenge her death.</p>
<p>Under his orders, Otto was continually raped, and as he refused to talk to Toric, or indeed anyone else, Otto ended up biting off his tongue. Clay later slipped him a shiv to end his pain, which he used to stab Toric, and when the guards arrived, Otto was shot multiple times in the chest, finally ending his suffering.</p>
<p>Clay Morrow
Jax Shot And Killed His Stepfather</p>
<p>Clay Morrow met his fate in season 6 after all his crimes, lies, and betrayals were laid bare to the club. After Jax told the rest of the club that Clay was responsible for the deaths of his father, Piney, and more, they decided he had to meet “Mr. Mayhem,” and Jax was the one who shot him to death. Jax and company arranged the scene (as they had also killed the leader of the True IRA and his companions) to make it look like Clay had a bloody falling out with the Irish over a bad deal.</p>
<p>Bobby Munson
August Marks Shot And Killed Bobby</p>
<p>Robert “Bobby Elvis” Munson (Mark Boone Jr.) was one of the most loyal members of the club and whose death also broke the hearts of viewers along with the rest of the members of the club. In season 7, and as one of the many consequences of Gemma’s lies about Tara’s murder, Bobby was kidnapped by August Marks’ men, who tortured him and removed his eye and fingers. Bobby was supposedly being freed at the end of the season, but Marks instead shot him in front of Jax as punishment for the latter’s betrayal.</p>
<p>Juan Carlos “Juice” Ortiz
Juice Asked Tully To Kill Him To Protect SAMCRO</p>
<p>Juice (Theo Rossi) was involved in a lot of trouble beginning in season 4 when he was targeted by AUSA Potter as a weak link in the club after finding out that his father was African-American, and due to SAMCRO&rsquo;s archaic rules, he would be stripped of his membership. This was the beginning of Juice’s seemingly unending downward spiral, which involved the callous murder of Eric Miles and Sheriff Roosevelt, along with many other subsequent betrayals.</p>
<p>Juice’s final task of shame as a SAMCRO member was being imprisoned, so he could kill Henry Lin, but that also came with the caveat of becoming Ron Tully’s (Marilyn Manson) sex slave. Juice confessed to Jax that Gemma was the one who killed Tara, and Jax promised Juice a quick death. Juice was offered protection in exchange for killing Tully, but he knew that would have a serious impact on the club, so he chose to tell Tully about it and asked him to kill him once he finished eating his cherry pie.</p>
<pre><code>              Sons of Anarchy: All 15 SAMCRO Ranks Explained   The motorcycle club Sons of Anarchy has its ranks, and here's every one of them, what their roles in the club are, and who wear those patches.   
</code></pre>
<p>Jax Teller
Jax Died By Suicide To End Sons Of Anarchy</p>
<p>The main character in Sons of Anarchy also met his fate in the series&rsquo; coda. Following Tara’s death, Jax’s life spiraled out of control all due to Gemma’s lies, which caused numerous clashes with multiple gangs including the Chinese, August Marks, and more. After killing Gemma and finally telling the club about all her lies, Jax gives himself over to SAMCRO’s rules. Although technically forced to meet “Mr. Mayhem” – the rest of the club couldn’t bring themselves to kill Jax, so he ended up dying by suicide on the road, mirroring his father’s death.</p>
<p>Other SAMCRO Members</p>
<p>Other SAMCRO members also died in Sons of Anarchy, but as they were either part of other charters or minor characters, their deaths can easily be forgotten. These characters are Keith McGee, one of the First 9 who was killed by Clay in Ireland; GoGo, Greg the Peg, and Frankie Diamonds, who were Clay’s secret crew tasked with discrediting Jax’s leadership by terrorizing the town and were killed by Unser, Clay, and Leo Pirelli, respectively; and Orlin West, who was recruited by Bobby and killed by Lin’s people.</p>
