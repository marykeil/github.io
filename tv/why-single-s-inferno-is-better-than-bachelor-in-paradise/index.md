## Literature Review
A comparison of the Korean dating show Single&#39;s Inferno and the American dating show Bachelor In Paradise. Each show has a dedicated fanbase. 




Though similar to the American dating show Bachelor In Paradise, Netflix&#39;s Korean dating show Single&#39;s Inferno is the superior television series. Both reality shows send their young, gorgeous contestants to an exotic location far away from their normal day-to-day lives and give them the opportunity to match romantically with each other. But there are many differences between the two shows.




Bachelor In Paradise is set at a resort in Mexico and brings together rejected cast members from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. Having failed to find their soulmate on previous Bachelor shows, they are given another chance at finding love with each other in a luxurious setting. Single&#39;s Inferno sends cast members to a mostly deserted island with the bare minimum in terms of creature comforts. They are encouraged to match up, so they can escape to paradise, a luxurious Korean hotel.

 Single&#39;s Inferno Features More Couples 
          

On Bachelor In Paradise, couples form quickly, and some stay together until the very end. People who don&#39;t couple up are eliminated from the show. In season 3 of Single&#39;s Inferno, the format doesn&#39;t allow for people to couple up quickly. In fact, the show often separates newly formed couples and forces them to get to know other cast members. This creates new couples all the time, which makes for ever-evolving dynamics and more mystery.






 Single&#39;s Inferno Hosts 
          

Though Single&#39;s Inferno is popular mostly due to the drama between the contestants, the show&#39;s hosts are also part of its success. The hosts are model, actress, and influencer Lee Da-hee, singer, actor, and TV host, Kyuhyun, comedian, model, YouTuber, and entrepreneur Hong Jin-kyung, and Jung Hanhae, an influencer, rapper, and former member of the hip-hop boy band, Phantom. The hosts watch the show along with the audience, providing comical and insightful commentary while the contestants look for love. This format feels like watching the show with friends.



 One Way BIP Is Better 
          




Bachelor In Paradise residents are hooking up within minutes of the first episode. In contrast, the third season of Single&#39;s Inferno has aired five episodes, and there hasn&#39;t been so much as a hug or a kiss between the residents. More hookups make for heightened emotions and, therefore, add to the drama. Single&#39;s Inferno is a much colder show than the sexier Bachelor In Paradise. This is due to cultural differences between the United States and South Korea. It makes it harder to predict who will end up together by the end of season 3.



Single&#39;s Inferno is streaming on Netflix. Episodes 6 and 7 drop on Tuesday, December 26, 2023. Episodes 8 and 9 drop on Tuesday, January 2, 2024. Episode 10 drops on Tuesday, January 9, 2024.
