# Warrior Nun Season 2 s Original End-Credits Scene Would Have Been A Better Ending For The Show


## SUMMARY 



  Beatrice&#39;s final scene in Warrior Nun season 2 would have been a better conclusion to her character and the show, with more satisfying goodbyes involving the other characters.   The original scene, which was cut due to time constraints, would have seen more characters saying goodbye to Beatrice.   The upcoming Warrior Nun movies may or may not provide closure for fans, as it remains unclear how they will tie into the show and if they will involve the original cast.

## Literature Review
Warrior Nun season 2’s final scene was almost different, and it would’ve been a better conclusion not only for Beatrice’s character but for the show.




Beatrice’s final scene in Warrior Nun season 2 was almost very different, and it would have been a better conclusion to both the character’s story and the show. Warrior Nun joined the list of fantasy shows canceled too soon, leaving viewers to wonder what happened to Ava in the other world and when she was going to reunite with Beatrice. Fan campaigns for Warrior Nun season 3 continue, but as of now, season 2’s “Jeremiah 29:13” is the show’s final episode.




Warrior Nun season 2 only had eight episodes – two less than season 1. With fewer episodes to tell a bigger story than season 1’s, Warrior Nun had to condense a lot of plotlines and cut some important moments. Show creator Simon Barry has since revealed scenes and ideas that didn’t make the cut, including elements that would have played a larger role in season 3 and the original version of Beatrice’s goodbye. Pondering about what season 3 might have been like can be frustrating given it didn&#39;t happen, but this different version of Warrior Nun season 2&#39;s finale would have made things less bittersweet.


 Warrior Nun Season 2&#39;s End-Credits Scene Originally Contained More Goodbyes 
         

As revealed by Warrior Nun’s Simon Barry during an interview with The OCS Newsletter, Beatrice’s final scene in season 2 would have been longer and contained more goodbyes. Warrior Nun season 2 ends with Beatrice deciding to leave the Order of Cruciform Sword following Ava’s sacrifice, likely leaving her life as a nun behind as well. Even though Beatrice is one of Warrior Nun’s main characters, her final scene in what could have been the end of the show is quite short. None of the other characters are featured, and it is unclear where Beatrice is heading or for how long she will be gone.






Seeing her leave it without much context or proper goodbyes was disappointing.




The original version of that scene, which never came to be due to time constraints, would have been a more satisfying farewell to Beatrice. She would have had a moment with all the other Warrior Sisters, excluding obviously Ava, which would have added a lot not only to Beatrice’s character but the show as a whole. Beatrice had been part of the OCS for years by the time audiences were introduced to them in Warrior Nun season 1, and seeing her leave it without much context or proper goodbyes was disappointing. It made sense for Beatrice to leave the order after everything that happened, but a longer scene would’ve been welcome.



 The Original Scene Would Have Been A Better Ending For The Canceled Netflix Show 
         




Beatrice’s original final scene would have been not only a better conclusion to her character but also a more fitting ending for the show considering Warrior Nun season 3 hasn&#39;t happened. Netflix canceled Warrior Nun shortly after season 2 was released, and while there has been a vocal campaign for the show to be renewed or saved by a different platform, nothing has changed yet. Given the show was only canceled after season 2 premiered, it makes sense that the finale left a lot of loose ends, including but not limited to Beatrice’s future and Ava’s return from the other world.

                  6 Biggest Things That Would Have Happened In Warrior Nun Season 3   Warrior Nun season 2’s finale, combined with recent comments from showrunner Simon Barry, helps decipher what would have happened in season 3.    

Still, at a time when many shows are canceled before they can even get to season 2, having a somewhat definite farewell to Beatrice and the other Warrior Sisters at the end of Warrior Nun season 2 would have been good. Without a third season, viewers can only theorize where Beatrice was going and what would’ve happened next. With Ava seemingly gone, there was no reason for Beatrice to stay at the OCS, especially now that she was rethinking her life as a nun. Also according to Simon Barry, the Warrior Sisters would have eventually reached out to Beatrice to help them stop an &#34;evil&#34; Ava.






 Warrior Nun Needs To Give Fans More Closure In Its Upcoming Movies 
          

A trilogy of Warrior Nun movies was announced to be in the works by producer Dean English on August 15, 2023. Not much was revealed about the project, including whether it would see the return of the show’s cast members. It was also unclear whether the movies would be tied to the show or if it would be a new adaptation of the comic book by Ben Dunn. More recently, the show’s creator Simon Barry confirmed he is not involved in the Warrior Nun movie trilogy project. Therefore, it is impossible to say if the announced Warrior Nun films will give fans closure, or if Ava and Beatrice’s story from the show is truly over.
