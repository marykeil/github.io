## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé star Brandon Gibbs and his parents Rob and Betty disrespect Julia Trubkina on 90 Day Diaires, thanks to the key to their new house.




90 Day Diaries star Brandon Gibbs is being critiqued for being passive-aggressive like his parents, with Julia Trubkina. Brandon, 30, from Dinwiddie, Virginia, met Julia, 29, from Krasnodar, Russia, through a friend who’d visited the club where Julia worked as a go-go dancer. Julia moved to the U.S. on a K-1 visa after getting engaged to Brandon and had to live on his parents’ farm. Brandon’s parents didn’t respect the couple’s privacy and prevented Brandon and Julia from leaving their house. However, things seemingly became better between Julia, Betty, and Ron after the show, and they started to get along.




Brandon and Julia bought their own house two hours away from his parents’ farm in 90 Day Diaries season 4, and as discussed by Friendly_Sea8570 on Reddit, Brandon gave the key to the house to his mom for Christmas during 90 Day Diaries season 5.


 

“Should he have told Julia first?” the fan asked fellow viewers. Brandon wanted to surprise everyone, including Julia, by giving Betty the key. Julia told the cameras that Brandon “tricked” her because it was Christmas, and she didn’t want to ruin the day for her family members. Julia told Brandon that he needed to have boundaries with his mom. Julia revealed that Betty had started “coming here every weekend.”

 Ron Gibbs Should Never Have Thrown Key At Julia 
          

“I like Brandon less and less the more I see him. He’s turning very passive-aggressive, just like his parents,” wrote catpunch_. Brandon, however, told his mom that she couldn’t drop by without informing them, which made Betty feel upset. She tried to make Brandon understand that she could drop by to surprise them. She asked why he gave her the key if he didn’t want her coming to the house whenever she desired. “Why [does] she need a key?” Julia asked Brandon while telling Betty that he had not told her about it. Betty asked if Brandon only wanted her to be in the house in a “controlled situation.”

Julia asked Betty to give the “key back,” and Betty refused. That&#39;s when Brandon’s father snatched the key from Betty’s hands and threw it at Julia. “Here’s your key,” he told Julia before choosing to walk away from the scene. “Brandon’s dad seems to be pretty quick to anger and almost like he will get physical. It was very rude to throw the key. She should’ve kicked him out right then,” posted Prestigious_Initial1. “I can’t imagine what my husband would do if my FIL threw anything at me!” posted bahtgirl. What’s weird is that Brandon took the key and handed it back to his mom during that scene.




Brandon has no shame in being called a mama’s boy. He prefers to choose his parents’ side over Julia’s whenever there is an argument in the house. While Brandon and Julia have been married for three years, there&#39;s a chance he wants to live with his parents instead of enjoying a private life with Julia. Moreover, Brandon is also trying to control Julia’s life lately. He doesn’t like his wife going back to dancing, even though Julia said she would earn twice what he makes at his pest control job.



90 Day Diaries airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
