The Masked Singer season 10 has released its season finale promo, and fans believe that the Final 2 might&#39;ve been spoiled by that teaser.

YouTube user @TheOfficialLewis wrote, &#34;Guyyys i think Top 2 is Donut and Gazelle bc when it shows all 4 together, Gazelle and Donut are red and Cow and Sea Queen aren&#39;t.&#34; In addition, @walkerslater8322 speculated, &#34;I think Donut and Gazelle are the top 2 because when Nick says the Winner it is red and Donut and Gazelle have red in 0:07.&#34;


 Who Has The Best Chance To Win Masked Singer Season 10? 
          

Based on the journeys of The Masked Singer season 10 singers so far, Donut and Cow probably have the best chance to win. They never competed in a Smackdown during their group rounds, and they both have very impressive voices. Although Gazelle is also an incredible singer, she was saved with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell. However, last year&#39;s winner Bishop Briggs (Medusa) had also been saved by the bell early on. Sea Queen&#39;s voice is also extraordinary, but, because she was a Group B Wild Card, she&#39;s had fewer performances for the audience to get to know her. In reality, with the amount of talent in this group, anyone could win.




The Masked Singer season 10 has already unmasked some legendary stars. They include Group A&#39;s Anthony Anderson (Rubber Ducky), Tom Sandoval (Diver), Michael Rapaport (Pickle), and Ashley Parker Angel (S&#39;More). In addition, Group B&#39;s Billie Jean King (Royal Hen), Tyler Posey (Hawk), Ginuwine (Husky), and Sebastian Bach (Tiki) have been unmasked, along with Group C&#39;s Luann de Lesseps (Hibiscus), Metta World Peace (Cuddle Monster), John Oates (Anteater), and Keyshia Cole (Candelabra).

The Masked Singer season 10 finale is certain to be one of the best yet. Cow, Gazelle, Sea Queen, and Donut have all proven themselves to be outstanding singers and entertainers. They&#39;ve sung so many different styles and genres, with both high-energy and powerfully emotional performances. They will now give their all in their final performances. The Masked Singer season 10 proves that the show is still the best reality competition series on television.

The Masked Singer season 10 finale airs Wednesday, December 20 at 8 p.m. on FOX.
