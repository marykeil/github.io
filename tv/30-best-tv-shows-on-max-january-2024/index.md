Our Flag Means Death (2022-Present)


 







 Our Flag Means Death 

 Release Date   March 3, 2022    Cast   Rhys Darby , Con O&#39;Neill , Rory Kinnear , Matthew Maher , Samson Kayo , Ewen Bremner , David Fane , Nathan Foad , Taika Waititi , Guz Khan , Vico Ortiz , Joel Fry , Kristian Nairn    Seasons   2    Writers   Eliza Jiménez Cossio , Zayre Ferrer , David Jenkins    




 Created by David Jenkins and executive produced by the unimitable Taika Waititi comes Our Flag Means Death, Max&#39;s outrageously funny 18th-century pirate comedy series. In it, Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) is a wealthy man living in Barbados who gets bored with his everyday life and up and decides to become a pirate. With his ragtag crew, Bonnet sets sail on the Revenge and has a wild string of misadventures, including a run-in with the infamous pirate Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard (Taika Waititi).
By its premise, Our Flag Meets Death sounds like total escapist fun, and it is, but the show has also been widely praised for its array of LGBTQ&#43; representation, as Our Flag Means Death features three gay romantic relationships. Beyond representation, it&#39;s simply one of the funniest and best shows on Max.

Sex And The City (1998-2004)
        

 Sex and the City 

 Release Date   June 6, 1998    Cast   Kim Cattrall , Cynthia Nixon , Sarah Jessica Parker , Kristin Davis    Seasons   6    




Sex and the City is one of Max’s most iconic and timeless shows, creating an enduring legacy that can be felt decades on from its release. Featuring an all-female lead cast, the show chronicles the lives of four New Yorkers - Carrie Bradshaw portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker, Samantha Jones portrayed by Kim Cattrall, Charlotte York portrayed by Kristin Davis, and Miranda Hobbes portrayed by Cynthia Nixon – as they negotiate their lives across the city trying to find a partner. The show is credited with helping the network gain tremendous viewership and popularity, as well as spawning a slew of lesser imitators.

The Righteous Gemstones (2019-)
        

 The Righteous Gemstones 

 Release Date   August 18, 2019    Cast   John Goodman , Danny McBride , Edi Patterson , Adam Devine    Seasons   2    




Dysfunctional families are the stuff that TV comedy dreams are made of, and The Righteous Gemstones doesn&#39;t disappoint. It centers on the titular Gemstone clan, a family of televangelists led by patriarch Eli Gemstone (John Goodman), the lead pastor of the Gemstone Salvation Center, a megachurch in Charleston, South Carolina.
This is Danny McBride&#39;s third series for HBO, after Eastbound &amp; Down and Vice Principals, and it&#39;s quite possibly his best. He&#39;s in top form playing his typical loudmouth, profane characters, and the contrast between Jesse&#39;s personality and his job as an associate pastor is a big reason why The Righteous Gemstones is so hilarious.

Barry (2018-2023)
        

 Barry 

 Release Date   March 25, 2018    Cast   Sarah Goldberg , Anthony Carrigan , Henry Winkler , Glenn Fleshler , Stephen Root , Bill Hader    Seasons   4    Story By   Alec Berg    




Perhaps the darkest comedy series on Max, Barry may seem like it has a fun premise — an unhappy hitman accidentally joins an acting class and wants to give up his profession to try and make it as a Hollywood star — but it&#39;s really a haunting meditation on past trauma and finding one&#39;s purpose in life.
However, that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t laughs to be had, particularly from pompous acting coach Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler) and bubbly mobster NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan). But Bill Hader, who also co-created the show with Alec Berg, is the true standout as the titular anti-hero, and he&#39;s won two Emmys for his work. For those who like their comedy with a side of existential dread, Barry is their best bet.

Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000-Present)


 







 Curb Your Enthusiasm 

 Release Date   October 15, 2000    Cast   Larry David , Jeff Garlin , Cheryl Hines , Susie Essman , J.B. Smoove    Seasons   11    




 From the show about nothing to a show about his life, Curb Your Enthusiasm sees Seinfeld co-creator Larry David play a semi-fictionalized version of himself. Peak cringe comedy, each episode inevitably sees Larry get himself into a social conflict, often sprung from either his flouting or ignorance of social conventions.
David is hilarious, but he&#39;s bolstered by a deeply talented supporting cast, with the profane Susie (Susie Greene) and the blunt yet mellow Leon (J. B. Smoove) two particular standouts who always deliver the laughs. With over 20 awards to its name and all 11 seasons to stream on Max, Curb Your Enthusiasm makes for a pretty, pretty, pretty good bingewatch.

 Rain Dogs 

 Release Date   June 3, 2023    Cast   Daisy May Cooper , Jack Farthing , Ronke Adekoluejo , Fleur Tashijan , Adrian Edmondson    Seasons   1    




 A heartfelt black comedy from the UK, Rain Dogs follows a single mother struggling to make ends meet and support her adolescent daughter. Starring Daisy May Cooper in the lead, the unconventional family drama employs dark gallows humor to hilarious effect. The series won critical acclaim and was even recognized as the number-one-rated new show for the first half of 2023 in the United States, according to Metacritic. Despite plenty of established competition, Rain Dogs easily ranks among the best comedy TV shows on Max.

 Release Date   April 22, 2012    Cast   Anna Chlumsky , Timothy Simons , Julia Louis-Dreyfus , Reid Scott , Tony Hale , Matt Walsh , Kevin Dunn , Sufe Bradshaw    Seasons   7    




 From the brilliant mind of Armando Iannucci comes the whip-smart political satire Veep. It stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Selina Meyer, who is elected Vice President of the United States, and her dependable, hilarious support staff. While Selina&#39;s party affiliation is never revealed, Veep offers shrewd commentary and is a brilliant send-up of almost every political trope. Louis-Dreyfus shattered the supposed &#34;Seinfeld curse&#34;, winning a staggering six consecutive Emmys for her role, proving that she has and will always be one of the funniest, most talented actors on television, and the show itself is a comedy masterpiece.

 The Other Two 

 Release Date   January 24, 2019    Cast   Heléne Yorke , Drew Tarver , Case Walker , Ken Marino , Molly Shannon , Brandon Scott Jones , Josh Segarra    Seasons   3    




 Drew Tarver and Case Walker star in The Other Two, a comedy about two siblings who must grow up in the limelight of their younger sibling’s pop-star fame. Co-created by Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, the series&#39; premise sees it take a novel approach to familiar problems like family drama and sibling rivalry. Molly Shannon is hilarious as the lead pair&#39;s fame-hungry mother, and the show made the move to Max after season 1 following a successful debut on Comedy Central.

 Somebody Somewhere 

 Release Date   January 16, 2022    Cast   Bridget Everett , Jeff Hiller , Mary Catherine Garrison , Danny McCarthy , Mike Hagerty , Murray Hill , Jane Drake Brody    Seasons   2    




 Created by Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen, Somebody Somewhere is another roaring comedy success for HBO. The series follows Sam, portrayed by Bridgett Everett, who suffers a midlife crisis following the traumatic and surprising death of her sister. Set in Manhattan, Kansas, the show poignantly deals with loss and identity in a way that is both touching and funny – a difficult balance to strike. With a third season in the works, the pressure is on for the show to continue its 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating from seasons 1 and 2.

Miracle Workers (2019-2023)
        

 Miracle Workers 

 Release Date   February 12, 2019    Cast   Daniel Radcliffe , Geraldine Viswanathan , Steve Buscemi    Seasons   4    Story By   simon rich    




 In his post-Harry Potter career, Daniel Radcliffe seems to have made it his mission to pick the most bizarre projects possible, and Miracle Workers proves why that choice is a rousing success. Miracle Workers is an anthology comedy series based on the works of Simon Rich, a humor writer and the show&#39;s creator.
Radcliffe leads an ensemble of actors including Steve Buscemi and Geraldine Viswanathan through these irreverent quirky stories — season 1 sees God (Buscemi) as the boss of a corporate workplace, season 2 takes place in the Dark Ages, season 3 on the Oregon Trail, and season 4 (not available on Max) in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Miracle Workers&#39; offbeat humor may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but the cast is phenomenal, and Radcliffe proves he doesn&#39;t need a wand to command the screen.

 Best Drama TV Shows On Max 
The Gilded Age (2022-Present)


 







 The Gilded Age 

 Release Date   January 24, 2022    Cast   Carrie Coon , Morgan Spector , Louisa Jacobson , Denée Benton , Taissa Farmiga , Harry Richardson , Blake Ritson , Christine Baranski , Cynthia Nixon    Seasons   1    




 Julian Fellowes crosses the pond to share the stories of 1880s New York elite with The Gilded Age. The Downton Abbey creator focuses his HBO series on the Upper East Side&#39;s rapidly changing high society as the old-money socialite Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski) contends with her Fifth Avenue neighbors, the new-money Russells (Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector). Caught in the middle is Agnes&#39; young niece Martha Brook, who is reliant on Agnes&#39; charity but yearns for her freedom.
A Fellowes show through and through, The Gilded Age is full of astonishing period costumes, powerhouse performances, and scandalous storylines that still manage to offer a deep commentary on society.

Chernobyl (2019)
        

 Chernobyl 

 Release Date   June 3, 2019    Cast   Stellan Skarsgård , Jared Harris    Seasons   1    Story By   Craig Mazin    




 From Band of Brothers to John Adams, nobody does a historical miniseries better than HBO, and Chernobyl is another resounding example. The miniseries tells the story of the horrific 1986 Chernobyl power plant disaster from several characters&#39; perspectives, from those who were involved in it to those who dealt with its aftermath. Chernobyl is unsurprisingly a difficult watch and its relentless pacing is unforgiving for the viewer.
But this provides an immersive experience that allows the audience to fully grasp the tragedies of the disaster. The miniseries thoroughly deserved its Outstanding Limited Series Emmy win, and it&#39;s one of the best dramas on Max.

Band Of Brothers (2001)
        

 Band of Brothers 

 Release Date   September 9, 2001    Cast   Kirk Acevedo , Eion Bailey , Michael Cudlitz , Dale Dye , Scott Grimes , Frank John Hughes , Damian Lewis , Ron Livingston , James Madio , Neal McDonough , David Schwimmer , Richard Speight Jr. , Donnie Wahlberg , Matthew Settle , Rick Warden , Marc Warren , Dexter Fletcher , Colin Hanks , Ross McCall    Seasons   1    




 Created by the Hollywood dream team of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Band of Brothers is not only one of HBO&#39;s best miniseries but its best shows period. Starring a cast of TV&#39;s best actors, from Billions&#39; Damian Lewis to Blue Bloods&#39; Donne Wahlberg, Band of Brothers centers on a group of WW2 paratroopers and their astonishing achievements in the war.
The miniseries is a frank and honest depiction of war and all its horrors, but it is neither gratuitous nor romantic and sentimental. Band of Brothers won multiple awards, including Outstanding Miniseries at the Emmys, and there&#39;s a reason it&#39;s still being talked about over 20 years later.

Succession (2018-2023)


 







 Succession 

 Release Date   June 3, 2018    Cast   Hiam Abbass , Alan Ruck , Sarah Snook , Kieran Culkin , Natalie Gold , Nicholas Braun , J. Smith-Cameron , Matthew Macfadyen , Peter Friedman , Brian Cox , Arian Moayed , Jeremy Strong , Rob Yang , Dagmara Dominczyk    Seasons   3    




 Both a pitch-black comedy and touching family drama, Succession has been rightly praised as one of the stand-out TV shows of the past decade. Brian Cox stars as the foul-mouthed patriarch of an empire-owning American family tasked with figuring out how best to secure his legacy once he&#39;s gone. Deliciously sweary, with some of the sharpest dialogue ever committed to the small screen, Succession uses real-life inspiration to tell a gripping original story that doesn&#39;t let up until its devastating finale.

The White Lotus (2021-Present)


 







 The White Lotus 

 Release Date   July 11, 2021    Cast   Alexandra Daddario , Fred Hechinger , Connie Britton , Murray Bartlett , Sydney Sweeney , Brittany O&#39;Grady , Natasha Rothwell , Jake Lacy , Jennifer Coolidge , Molly Shannon , Steve Zahn , Aubrey Plaza , Theo James , Haley Lu Richardson , Michael Imperioli , F.

 A satirical swipe at classism and the hollowness of pecuniary wealth, The White Lotus is a truly original addition to Max&#39;s roster. The anthology spends each new season at a different branch of the White Lotus hotel – initially in Hawaii, and then in Italy. With some notable exceptions, a different cast of characters comes under the spotlight, creating different stories to explore with each outing. Frequently funny, The White Lotus is also an uncomfortable critique of the things society supposedly values.

The Last Of Us (2023-Present)


 







 The Last Of Us 

 Release Date   January 15, 2023    Cast   Pedro Pascal , Bella Ramsey , Gabriel Luna , Anna Torv , Merle Dandridge , Nick Offerman , Jeffrey Pierce    Seasons   1    




 One of the most successful videogame-to-screen adaptations ever, The Last of Us rewrote the rulebook on what a live-action version of a game can be. The post-apocalyptic drama stars Pedro Pascal as Joel, a smuggler tasked with aiding Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, a teenager immune to the pandemic that destroyed humanity.
The show was co-created by Craig Mazin, known for Chernobyl, and Neil Druckmann, the original game’s director, and has been credited for its faithful retelling of the original story, as well as its ability to adapt the source material for a different format when necessary. With season 2 on the way, The Last of Us is already established as one of 2023&#39;s best TV series.

 Controversial and celebrated in equal measure, Euphoria is somewhat notorious for its uncompromising depiction of teenagehood. Starring screen favorites Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, Sydney Sweeney, and numerous other gifted actors delivering exceptional performances, this show is a devastating mixture of gripping drama and heartbreaking tragedy, making for an undeniably compelling watch. Seriously bingeworthy and boasting a fabulous soundtrack, Euphoria has struck a chord with a younger generation of TV viewers.

  House of the Dragon 

 Release Date   August 21, 2022    Cast   Fabien Frankel , Graham McTavish , Olivia Cooke , Gavin Spokes , Sonoya Mizuno , Steve Toussaint , Matt Smith , Matthew Needham , Rhys Ifans , Emma D&#39;Arcy    Seasons   1    Franchise   Game of Thrones    




 Following the contentious conclusion to the sweeping fantasy drama Game of Thrones, expectations were mixed ahead of House of the Dragon&#39;s debut. As it turns out, fans needn&#39;t have worried. The prequel, set about 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones, chronicles the power-hungry Targaryen family and the beginning of their decline. Matt Smith, Paddy Considine, and Emma D’Arcy deliver riveting performances, while the series&#39; plot dispenses with Game of Thrones&#39; more controversial elements to tell a streamlined and thrilling story.

 Release Date   April 11, 2011    Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Seasons   8    Writers   D.B. Weiss , George R.R. Martin , David Benioff    




 One of the most-talked-about fantasy dramas ever made, Game of Thrones was the definitive TV experience for nearly a decade. Attracting huge viewership numbers, the show chronicled the epic struggle for the throne of Westeros between competing factions. Blending action with backstabbing political intrigue, the show&#39;s initial strength came from its willingness to kill off anyone and everyone in aid of furthering the story. Despite being marred by a sub-par finale, Game of Thrones remains one of the best TV shows on Max.

 Best Crime TV Shows On Max 
The Sopranos (1999-2007)
        

 The Sopranos 

 Release Date   January 10, 1999    Cast   James Gandolfini , Lorraine Bracco , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Dominic Chianese , Steven Van Zandt , Tony Sirico , Robert Iler , Jamie-Lynn Sigler    Genres   Crime , Drama    Seasons   6    




Often hailed as the greatest TV show of all time, The Sopranos helped redefine the modern television landscape. With ambitious storytelling, electric writing, and some of the most iconic performances ever seen on the small screen, it&#39;s little wonder the show continues to receive acclaim. The plot revolves around Tony Soprano, portrayed by James Gandolfini, an Italian mobster based out of New Jersey who struggles to balance family life with the pressures of being a crime boss. Influential long after its conclusion, The Sopranos deservedly features on multiple &#34;must-watch&#34; lists of the best television series.

The Flight Attendant (2020-2022)
        

 The Flight Attendant 

 Release Date   November 26, 2020    Cast   Kaley Cuoco , Michelle Gomez , Michiel Huisman , Griffin Matthews , Colin Woodell , Rosie Perez , Merle Dandridge , Nolan Gerard Funk , Zosia Mamet , T.R. Knight    Seasons   2    Writers   Griffin Matthews    




 While stars of long-running sitcoms often never find success after their shows end, The Big Bang Theory&#39;s Kaley Cuoco is only seeing her career reach new heights. She headlines The Flight Attendant as Cassie Bowden, a charming flight attendant living with alcoholism who wakes up hungover from a fling in Bangkok, only to find herself next to the dead body of her lover. The fact that Cassie can barely remember the night before only further complicates things.
Based on the novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian, The Flight Attendant is a pulpy noir that is also outrageously funny and searingly heartwrenching. As Cassie sometimes clumsily, sometimes successfully tries to uncover the truth, the audience is shown a warts-and-all portrait of a woman with many, many flaws but also deep-rooted vulnerabilities. Cassie is the most complex character Cuoco has ever played, and her outstanding performance makes The Flight Attendant one of the best shows on Max.

 The Wire 

 Release Date   June 2, 2002    Cast   Lance Reddick , Michael B. Jordan , Idris Elba , Dominic West , Wood Harris    Seasons   5    Writers   David Simon    




 Just as The Sopranos redefined Mafia TV shows, The Wire was a fiercely original update to the classic police procedural. Inside of showing the war on drugs from one side of the legal line, the show created a rich tapestry of characters spanning every stage of the process – from hard-boiled detective Jimmy McNulty, to the charming and dangerous drug kingpin Stringer Bell. The Wire probably ranks among the most ambitious shows ever made, with each series switching up the focus to paint a comprehensive portrait of the drugs trade. Led by an incredible ensemble cast, it remains one of the best TV shows ever.

It is difficult to overstate how compelling and exciting True Detective was during its astonishing debut season in 2014. Nick Pizzolatto&#39;s anthology crime drama begins with a demonic tale of abuse and murder set in Louisiana, showcasing two exceptional performances from McConaughey and Harrelson. Subsequent seasons boast equally impressive casts, with the likes of Rachel McAdams, Colin Farrell, and Mehershala Ali all appearing. With True Detective season 4 in the works, the hit series shows no sign of slowing down.

Love &amp; Death (2023)


 







 Love &amp; Death 

 Release Date   April 27, 2023    Cast   Elizabeth Olsen , Jesse Plemons , Patrick Fugit , Lily Rabe , Keir Gilchrist , Elizabeth Marvel , Tom Pelphrey , Krysten Ritter    Seasons   1    Website   https://www.hbomax.com/series/love-and-death    




 Whether in documentary or scripted form, true crime series have become a staple of the 2020s, and Love &amp; Death is the second miniseries in two years centered around Candy Montgomery, the Texan housewife accused of murdering her friend Betty Gore with an ax. The first miniseries, Candy, starred Jessica Biel as Montgomery, and in Love &amp; Death, she&#39;s played by Elizabeth Olsen. When Candy becomes interested in fellow church-goer Allan Gore (Jesse Plemons), the two strike up an affair.
The end result is Candy killing Allan&#39;s wife Betty (Lily Rabe) with an ax and being put on trial for her murder, though Candy insists she acted in self-defense. While Love &amp; Death hits the beats of a suburban true crime story with a bit too much familiarity, the performances of the main cast, particularly Olsen&#39;s, make Love &amp; Death a captivating watch.

Station Eleven (2021)
        

 Station Eleven 

 Release Date   December 16, 2021    Cast   Mackenzie Davis , Himesh Patel    Seasons   1    




 Sci-fi fare can be eerily timely, and this is definitely true for Max miniseries Station Eleven, based on the bestselling Emily St. John Mandel novel of the same name. Released during COVID-19 (with its production impacted by the pandemic), Station Eleven takes place 20 years after a flu pandemic wiped out most of civilization.
It follows a performing troupe called the Traveling Symphony as they try to give hope (and find it themselves) in a broken world. While most dystopian stories are bleak and depressing, Station Eleven, though not without its hardships, maintains a hopeful tone throughout, and whether viewers are watching it in a pandemic or not, it&#39;s a beautiful reminder that the show must always go on.

 Reprising his somewhat surprising breakout role from James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, John Cena returns for the stand-alone series Peacemaker. Despite his pacifistic pseudonym, Peacemaker is one of the most violent characters in the DCU and rarely misses a chance to pick a fight. Gunn returns as writer and director, providing more of the signature humor and wit that made the character so popular in the 2021 DCEU entry. Alongside Cena, co-star Jennifer Holland also delivers a superb performance, making Peacemaker one of the best sci-fi shows on Max.

Harley Quinn (2019-)
        

 Harley Quinn 

 Release Date   November 29, 2019    Cast   Kaley Cuoco , Lake Bell , Alan Tudyk , Ron Funches , Tony Hale , Jason Alexander    Seasons   4    Story By   Paul Dini, Bruce Timm    




 After Margot Robbie&#39;s portrayal in the DCEU, Harley Quinn has become one of DC&#39;s most recognizable characters. However, anyone familiar with the character through film alone may well be shocked at the gloriously profane representation seen in Harley Quinn. Offering a less-than-serious take on some of Batman&#39;s most recognizable opponents and compatriots, the show is gratuitously vulgar and frequently hilarious, thriving in its ability to lampoon characters that can become tediously serious in other projects. Critically acclaimed across its run, Harley Quinn continues to be a major hit for Max into its fourth season.

 Created by Community&#39;s Dan Harmon, Rick and Morty is understandably considered to be one of the most significant animated shows of the past decade. Following the Back to the Future-inspired adventures of boorish genius Rick Sanchez and his skittish grandson Morty, the show is a madcap adventure that spans different dimensions, planets, and timelines. Laced with inventive comedy and classic standalone stories, Rick and Morty is a hugely entertaining riot from beginning to end. Rick and Morty season 7 will be arriving on Max on January too, making it one of the best times to catch the show on the platform.

 Release Date   May 10, 2010    Cast   Tom Kenny , Hynden Walch , Jeremy Shada , John DiMaggio , Niki Yang    Seasons   10    Writers   Pendleton Ward    




 Animated series often fall into two camps: pure kid fare or wildly meant for adults, like Family Guy. That&#39;s what makes Adventure Time such a treasure — it&#39;s sharp enough to appeal to adults while still having a sense of whimsy, fun, and lack of mature themes that older kids and teens can enjoy too. It centers on friends and adoptive brothers Finn the Human and Jake the Dog who have magical shape-shifting powers and together they, of course, go on adventures.
Adventure Time won eight Emmys over the course of its run and its awards pedigree, combined with the show&#39;s proud gender inclusivity and diversity, make it one to add to the streaming queue.
