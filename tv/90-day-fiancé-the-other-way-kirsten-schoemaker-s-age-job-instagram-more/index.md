Get to know 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5&#39;s Kirsten Schoemaker, including her age, birthday, job, and what she posts on Instagram. Kirsten is from Nijeveen in the Netherlands and was introduced in episode 1 by her now ex-boyfriend, Julio Moya, from Brentwood, New York. Julio had found Kirsten while he was scrolling through his Instagram Explore feed and met her in Amsterdam for the first time during the pandemic after three months. Despite never FaceTiming, Julio and Kirsten had to quarantine together for a week. Julio ended up spending two months in the Netherlands once they started dating.




Julio got used to life in the Netherlands and applied for residency. He was moving to the country within three months when Kirsten came to New York to visit him. Julio had not told his family about his decision to move, and once he did, his family convinced him not to go ahead. Julio broke up with Kirsten on a video call when she’d gone back home after failing to give her a timeline about when he could relocate. However, during Tell All, he said trust issues led to their split, as Julio accused Kirsten of cheating on him with a male friend.
