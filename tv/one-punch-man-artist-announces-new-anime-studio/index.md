## Literature Review
The talented artist behind One-Punch Man, Yusuke Murata, has launched his own anime studio, and revealed teaser videos for his first anime series.




The artist behind the One-Punch Man manga, Yusuke Murata, announced the launch of his own anime studio, and he has revealed five new teaser clips for his first project, an original anime called Zaiyuki. Known for his detailed and captivating art, and the innovative use of new technologies, the exciting news will see the mangaka become a full-time animator, much to the joy of fans.




Murata announced he was working on an original anime back in March 2023, and he decided to kick off 2024 by revealing his plans for the series as well as showing videos of his upcoming anime. The new clips highlight one of the strengths of the artist, the dynamic and exciting battle sequences that delight fans of One-Punch Man, and clearly will be an important feature in Zaiyuki too. In another post on X, published on January 1st, Murata also announced the creation of a new anime studio.


 

Although there isn&#39;t a lot of information regarding the project, there has been some progress as evidenced by the new clips posted on Murata&#39;s X account. The plot has also been discerned, revolving around a Kappa boy called Goyjo, who is roped into problems that flip his world upside down.





 One-Punch Man&#39;s Yusuke Murata Ventures Into The Anime World 
          

The first project of Yusuke Murata&#39;s Village Studio will be an original anime called Zaiyuki. It is about Goyjo, a Kappa boy who fails at activities that his brethren are good at, such as swimming and sumo (according to Japanese folklore), and becomes an outcast. He finally gets the opportunity to leave his hometown when he wins the lottery, booking a ticket and going overseas. As he is waiting in line at the airport, an old man hands him an egg, which later hatches into a monkey proficient in martial arts, similar to the same Sun Wukong who inspired Dragon Ball. Unfortunately, he gets mixed with two other fugitives and is hunted down as an accomplice of the criminals.


 




Yusuke Murata has dabbled with animation in the past, for example making a dynamic One-Punch Man short or an Eyeshield 21 clip to celebrate its anniversary. In the pages of One-Punch Man, Murata has constantly been experimenting with the potential of digital manga, producing pages that pushed manga art into the future. These past few months have seen Murata becoming even more active. Besides working on his new anime, he has announced that Eyeshield 21 will receive a new chapter with 51 pages, and participated in the monthly drawing of Dragon Ball&#39;s volume covers by different mangakas, all while putting out new chapters of One-Punch Man.


 

This intense work schedule might explain why One-Punch Man&#39;s latest chapters have been much shorter than ever, going from 35 to 50 pages to a 15-page average for the past 3 chapters. In fact, although the news of a new animation studio headed by Murata is great, it casts doubt as to whether he might be able to continue working on the One-Punch Man manga with the same schedule. Making an anime and running a production studio is very burdensome and time-consuming, even more so at the founding stages. Hopefully, Yusuke Murata&#39;s new venture into animation will not impact fans of One-Punch Man too much, and they will also be able to enjoy his new series Zaiyuki when it comes out.
