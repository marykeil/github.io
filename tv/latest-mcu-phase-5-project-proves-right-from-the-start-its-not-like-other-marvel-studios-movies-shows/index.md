## Literature Review
Marvel&#39;s latest release is different from other MCU shows in several ways, but the most obvious difference is illuminated at the beginning.




Marvel&#39;s Echo is the latest MCU Phase 5 project, and it proves it&#39;s different from others almost immediately. The Echo cast features Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez, aka Echo, and it continues her story following the events of Hawkeye. After taking down Kingpin, Maya returns to her hometown where she reconnects with many people from her past and her Choctaw community. However, when Kingpin makes a surprising return, her past catches up with her, and she unwillingly brings war back with her.




The series is different from other MCU shows in several ways. Echo is rated TV-MA and all five episodes were dropped on the same day on Disney&#43; and Hulu rather than the weekly release strategy. Its most notable difference may be the Marvel Spotlight banner that appears at the beginning of every episode, suggesting Echo is the first of a new, smaller segment of the MCU.

                  Marvel&#39;s Echo Ending Explained   Marvel&#39;s Echo ends with an epic finale episode, featuring Maya Lopez as she finally chooses which legacy she truly belongs to in the MCU.    


 What Is Marvel Spotlight? 
          

The name &#34;Marvel Spotlight&#34; is not new to Marvel as it refers to a comic book anthology series of the same name. The series is responsible for introducing readers to famous characters like Ghost Rider and Spider-Woman. It began with Red Wolf, Marvel&#39;s first Indigenous superhero, which could explain the decision to start the series with Maya, a hero from the Choctaw Nation portrayed by an actor of the Menominee and Mohican nations.




In Echo, the Marvel Spotlight banner plays before each episode with a new logo and original fanfare created by composer Michael Giacchino. Projects under this banner will be character-driven and focus on standalone stories that don&#39;t necessitate knowledge of the larger timeline of the MCU. While Echo was in Hawkeye, the series provides a recap in the first episode so that viewers don&#39;t have to watch other projects to understand this show. The Marvel Spotlight projects should be more accessible to people who aren&#39;t caught up on every Marvel show and movie.



 How Echo Is Different To All Other MCU Movies And Shows

Besides the Marvel Spotlight banner, Echo is more violent than other MCU shows and movies. It features a lot of blood and brutal violence, feeling more similar to Netflix&#39;s Daredevil than any other Disney&#43; show. It&#39;s the shortest MCU series as it only consists of five episodes, and it also has a different release strategy. All five episodes dropped at once, and it was also the first show to premiere on Hulu alongside Disney&#43;. It&#39;s unclear when the next Marvel Spotlight show will debut, but the mature tone of Echo could be a preview of what audiences can expect from Daredevil: Born Again.
