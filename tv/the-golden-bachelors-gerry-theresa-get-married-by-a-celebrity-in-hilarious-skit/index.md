## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner &amp; Theresa Nist are getting ready for their televised wedding on January 4, but a celebrity is trying to officiate.




The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist may be planning to get married during their live wedding special on January 4, but an appearance on Live With Kelly &amp; Mark may have beaten them to the punch. Gerry, who began his journey as The Golden Bachelor with over 20 women to choose from, met Theresa and felt a connection from the very beginning. After the pair rang in Theresa&#39;s 70th birthday on the first night of the season, their love story continued to unfold and Gerry fell for Theresa over several Bachelor Nation style dates. While the decision was tough, Gerry ultimately knew Theresa was the one for him.




After The Golden Bachelor season 1 ended with Gerry and Theresa happily engaged and ready to get married, it was announced their wedding would be airing live on ABC on January 4, 2024. During a recent appearance on morning talk show Live With Kelly &amp; Mark, the couple was surprised by the idea that Mark Consuellos, co-host of the show with his long-time wife Kelly Ripa, was an ordained minister.


 

Kelly and Mark had everything ready for Theresa and Gerry&#39;s wedding to happen during the show, making a joke out of the entire process after Kelly announced that &#34;Mark is an ordained minister&#34; and could marry the pair right then and there. While they didn&#39;t go through with an official ceremony, Gerry and Theresa vowed to be there for each other in sickness and in health, exchanging ring pops as they laughed with the hosts.

 Gerry &amp; Theresaâ€™s Golden Bachelor Relationship Explained 
          

Gerry and Theresa&#39;s connection may not have been as smooth as some of the others on The Golden Bachelor, but their relationship unfolded sweetly after the first night at the Bachelor mansion. Gerry, who knew Theresa was celebrating her birthday on the opening night, brought out a cupcake for them to share, having Theresa blow out birthday candles to make a wish. Theresa and Gerry&#39;s connection may not have been as quick to ignite as his relationship with Leslie Fhima, who many felt would be the winner of The Golden Bachelor, but Gerry&#39;s feelings for his finalist grew steadily throughout his journey to find the second love of his life.





 

During the fantasy suite dates on The Golden Bachelor, Gerry knew that he was going to make the difficult choice to end things with his other finalists. While he couldn&#39;t fully commit to Theresa yet, he shared that she was going to be his choice at the end and told her he loved her. Theresa, thrilled to know that Gerry felt the same way she did, was excited to get started in the next chapter of their lives. While their proposal was a sweet, romantic affair, the couple&#39;s happy journey is just getting started ahead of their wedding in just a few short days.

Although Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding could&#39;ve happened during their live appearance on Live With Kelly &amp; Mark, their wedding special has already been in the works for far too long to let it go to waste. The couple, who are excited to begin the next chapter in their lives together, shared that they&#39;re looking forward to simply settling down after the wedding. For Gerry, who&#39;s bringing Theresa and her sweet family into the fold after their love story, The Golden Bachelor will be an experience he remembers forever.
