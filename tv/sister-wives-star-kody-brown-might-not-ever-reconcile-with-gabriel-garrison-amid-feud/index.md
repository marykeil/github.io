# Sister Wives Star Kody Brown Might Not Ever Reconcile With Gabriel &amp; Garrison Amid Feud


## SUMMARY 



  Sister Wives star Kody Brown&#39;s relationship with his sons Gabriel and Garrison is strained and unlikely to improve, as they haven&#39;t made any efforts to reconnect.   The feud between Kody and his sons started during the COVID-19 pandemic when they resisted his rules and restrictions, leading to Kody&#39;s anger and attempts to kick them out.   It seems that both Kody and his sons have moved on from their strained relationship, with Kody focusing on his younger children and the boys no longer needing or wanting a relationship with him.

## Literature Review
Sister Wives’ Janelle Brown reveals where Kody Brown stands with Gabriel and Garrison in 2023 after having a falling out with them during COVID-19.




Kody Brown from Sister Wives isn’t close to his sons, Gabriel and Garrison Brown, and that may never change. The Wyoming resident has ruined his relationship with many family members in the past few years. One such cast member is his second wife, Janelle Brown, who doesn’t want to be with him. Kody and Janelle’s issues began during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, he gave his wife a list of rules and asked her to enforce those restrictions with his sons. As expected, Janelle didn’t interfere in her kids’ lives, which made Kody furious with her, Gabriel, and Garrison.




Recently, Janelle opened up in an interview amid her split from Kody. She talked to Us Weekly and revealed that the relationship between her former partner, Kody, and her sons, Gabriel and Garrison, hasn’t improved. The Sister Wives star said, “There’s still not a lot of movement,” adding that neither side has tried to re-establish the connection. Janelle feels that her former husband and her kids should come to a peace. She’s optimistic that time will heal the differences between Kody and his sons. The single mom is “hoping that in the future, things can get better.”

 Kody Brown&#39;s Feud With Gabriel &amp; Garrison Explained 
          




Kody’s feud with Gabriel and Garrison started around the pandemic. Around that time, Gabriel wanted to see his girlfriend and felt restricted by Kody’s rules. Similarly, Garrison wasn’t too happy about the situation and didn’t support his father. While the young lads were right to question the rules, the TLC star felt it was disrespectful of them not to listen to him. At one point, the Brown family patriarch got so furious at the two that he tried to kick them out of Janelle’s house. Kody had also previously made Gabriel cry by forgetting his 20th birthday.


 

While Janelle hopes that her ex-husband and her sons will reconcile one day, the chances of this seem slim. Kody is too busy with his wife, Robyn Brown, and his younger kids. He is no longer interested in spending time or building a meaningful relationship with his elder sons. The fact that he tried to kick them out during the COVID-19 pandemic proves that he probably doesn’t share the same affection or love for them as he used to when they were younger. The father of 18 already has too many children to father.




Likewise, Gabriel and Garrison probably don’t care for Kody as well. The 22-year-old and the 25-year-old are grown men on their own paths to building their families. It doesn’t seem either of them has the time to make amends with their father. Gabriel and Garrison also don’t benefit at all from befriending Kody. They no longer need his guidance and have lost respect for him. The sibling duo likely doesn&#39;t think their father is a good example of a real family man. They probably resent him and refuse to idolize him like some other controversial Sister Wives cast members.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
