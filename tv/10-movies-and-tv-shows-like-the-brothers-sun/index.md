## Literature Review

The Brothers Sun&#39;s excellent blend of comedy, crime, and martial arts makes it a game changer, but, there are other projects similar to the comedy.




While The Brothers Sun follows a fresh approach to the martial arts genre, other shows and even movies share similar themes and sensibilities as the Netflix show. The Brothers Sun is a darkly humorous action comedy that centers around the generational divide between its protagonist&#39;s standard American life, and his family&#39;s status as the most notorious Triad gang in Taiwan, with Michelle Yeoh as the matriarch who attempts to keep the family together. After the successful first season, talks of The Brothers Sun season 2 inspire hope that the first season&#39;s unique blend of humor and martial arts will persist.
The Brothers Sun cast of characters aid significantly in giving the show a distinct style as most action movies catered to American audiences tend to be more in line with action vehicles like The Expendables and John Wick. However, basing a show around the cultural and generational complexities of Taiwanese families offers a unique perspective rarely seen in mainstream productions, thus contributing to The Brothers Sun&#39;s overall positive reception. As much of a game changer as the new show is, there are other quality projects similar to The Brothers Sun that are also worth checking out.

 10  Animal Kingdom (2016 - 2022) 
Centers around the ruination of a southern Californian family due to their greed.
        

Animal Kingdom follows the Cody family&#39;s descent into despair as their lust for greed and power breaks the family apart in many treacherous ways. Across its six seasons, Animal Kingdom treats viewers to carefully constructed drama that not only manages to make for compelling TV, but also reinforces to its audience the central theme of greed and its negative impact on a family. Although Animal Kingdom is devoid of martial arts, its themes and atmosphere more than make it a show in a similar lane as The Brothers Sun.

 9  Warrior (2019) 
Warrior sees Chinese immigrants attempting to establish themselves in 1870s San Francisco.
        

Based on actual journal entries by the legendary martial arts icon Bruce Lee, Warrior centers around an immigrant from China named Ah Sahm, who finds himself embroiled in organized crime in 1870s San Francisco, California. While Warrior&#39;s focus is more on its protagonist&#39;s survival in the seedy underworld of Chinese and American gangsters, the unlikely familial bonds forged between Ah Sahm and some of the other characters perfectly demonstrate the similarities between Warrior and The Brothers Sun.

Filled with plenty of action and leaning more into Schwarzenegger&#39;s oft underutilized comedic side, FUBAR offers audiences a heartfelt story about family and doing what one must to maintain and preserve their relationships with their loved ones. While The Brothers Sun emphasizes the action and gore, FUBAR&#39;s familial sensibilities are in line with it.

Featuring plenty of well-choreographed fight scenes and enough drama to keep its less grueling moments grounded and engaging, Into the Badlands excels in its ability to create a world in which characters from multiple backgrounds bond over their shared circumstances of surviving the apocalypse. In addition to its great action sequences and well-written characters, the evolution of each character and their relationships is Into the Badlands&#39; strongest connection to The Brothers Sun.

Rife with deceptive characters, tense drama, and enough action to give its competition a run for its money, Gangs of London&#39;s emphasis on the relationships between its criminal characters perfectly mimics that of an actual family.

The Fantasy teen comedy series reunites Yeoh with Key Hu Quan and Stephanie Hsu.
        

American Born Chinese centers around American high-schooler Jin Wang as his life is uprooted after finding himself entangled in a war between mythological Chinese gods. Filled with great performances by some of the industry&#39;s best comedic talent, American Born Chinese masterfully blends its action sequences and set-pieces with the more grounded and humorous tone of Jin&#39;s home and school lives. Featuring Yeoh in the role of Guayin Pusa, American Born Chinese also sees her alongside Everything Everywhere All At Once co-stars Key Hu Quan and Stephanie Hsu, thus cementing the family comedy vibes of The Brothers Sun.

 4  Bloodhounds (2023) 
Bloodhounds sees its leads develop a brotherly bond while taking on members of organized crime.
        

Three youths in debt decide to use their martial arts skills to take on the most notorious and influential members of organized crime in a South Korean action drama rife with actions and suspense. Although Bloodhounds doesn&#39;t lean into comedy as much as shows like FUBAR and The Brothers Sun, the show&#39;s heavy reinforcement of its brotherly love themes between its protagonists helps keep it in line with The Brothers Sun. Furthermore, Bloodhounds features plenty of violence throughout its eight episodes that more than makes up for its noticeable lack of humor.





 3  Vincenzo (2021) 
Vincenzo is a South Korean crime drama that centers around familial bonds and tradition.
        

Vincenzo is a South Korean crime drama that sees its protagonist, Vincenzo, a Korean-Italian lawyer, take on members of organized crime in a story rife with themes of family, honor, and tradition. Although Vincenzo only has a single season to its credit, it perfectly demonstrates the cultural difference between South Korea and Italy while also maintaining its themes of family and tradition through its paralegal protagonist. Whereas other shows in the crime drama thrive on their violence, Vincenzo makes a strong impression on its audience by highlighting the lengths one will go through to preserve their family&#39;s honor.





 2  Police Story 3: Super Cop (1992) 
Police Story 3: Super Cop sees Yeoh exchange fists and laughs with Jackie Chan in her breakout role.


 







Police Story 3: Supercop sees Yeoh team up with Hong Kong action star and martial arts legend Jackie Chan, in an action movie rife with Chan&#39;s signature brand of humor and bravado that audiences both foreign and domestic have come to love. Police Story 3: Supercop sees the two bring down a ruthless Chinese drug lord in one of the best movies in the Police Story franchise, as well as Yeoh&#39;s breakout role as she holds her own with the wildcard that is Chan. Coupled with their chemistry, Police Story 3: Supercop is the second-closest movie to The Brothers Sun.





 1  Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) 
Yeoh&#39;s Oscar-winning film shares similar sensibilities and themes with The Brothers Sun.


 







Oscar winner Everything Everywhere All At Once sees Yeoh as Evelyn Wang, a meek small business owner struggling to maintain both her business and family as her daughter&#39;s homosexuality threatens to break up the more traditional members of the Wang household. The film utilizes multiverses in a fresh way that shows Evelyn and audiences the importance of and value in appreciating family just the way they are. Additionally, Everything Everywhere All At Once is just as hilarious as it is filled with creative martial arts scenes, thus making it most like The Brothers Sun in Yeoh&#39;s filmography.
  Everything Everywhere All at Once  


  Release Date    March 25, 2022     Director    Daniel Kwan , Daniel Scheinert     Cast    Jenny Slate , Ke Huy Quan , Stephanie Hsu , Harry Shum Jr. ,  Jamie Lee Curtis , James Hong , Michelle Yeoh     Runtime    132 minutes
