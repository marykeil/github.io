It’s unlikely that The Challenge: USA’s production company Bunim/Murray Productions and MTV Entertainment Studios have filmed season 3 already. According to an old Reddit post from Few-Sort-5643, the show’s producers contacted The Challenge: USA’s season 2 cast members in December 2022. If the same is true for season 3, it&#39;s likely the producers haven’t finalized the cast. Old reports hint that the filming for the spin-off often takes merely seven weeks. Therefore, the production crew will probably film The Challenge: USA season 3 sometime in early 2024.
