## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games star Xavier is working his way through the competition, but he was keeping a secret about his health during the series.




Big Brother Reindeer Games star Xavier Prather was known as a competition beast during his time on Big Brother, but he&#39;s not as certain about his chances after having multiple surgeries prior to the BB spin-off. Xavier was the first Black man to win Big Brother in a phenomenal season that revamped the series entirely. While Xavier has kept his life private since his time on Big Brother, he was excited to return and compete in Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 alongside several other BB legends. Xavier&#39;s time on the series has been exciting thus far, with the rest of the cast none the wiser about his secret.




In a promotional Instagram story, Xavier shared that he&#39;s had &#34;two major athletic surgeries since my last time competing on TV,&#34; along with his cast photo from Big Brother Reindeer Games. &#34;Do I still have what it takes to win,&#34; Xavier posited, along with the photo of him smiling in front of a Christmas tree set.

          

While Xavier didn&#39;t disclose the nature of the surgeries he&#39;s undergone, it appears that as a physically fit person, he&#39;s suffered some injuries in the past that required repair. As one of the strongest physical competitors on the Big Brother Reindeer Games cast, the fact that Xavier had to deal with sports injuries and rehabilitation before competing on BB Reindeer Games is interesting, given the nature of the show is overtly physical.





 How Is Xavier Prather Doing On Big Brother Reindeer Games? 
          

While there&#39;s only been one episode of Big Brother Reindeer Games to judge Xavier&#39;s performance from, he&#39;s already off to a great start on the competitively challenging series. Xavier may not have won the first competition, which involved gathering clues to solve a Christmas carol-themed riddle, but he didn&#39;t receive a disadvantage after BB 12&#39;s Britney Haynes received the first Naughty Or Nice power of the game. Britney chose to give the Naughty power, a disadvantage in the next game, to Cody Calafiore, who is Xavier&#39;s biggest competitive threat. After competing in the second competition of the day, Xavier didn&#39;t make any enemies, but he didn&#39;t get out unscathed.


 




After the first competition, Frankie Grande had the power to choose the two players who would head into Santa&#39;s Showdown. The loser of the showdown would be sent home from Big Brother Reindeer Games. Frankie chose to send Xavier along with Big Brother 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin into the competition, hopeful that Xavier would be someone who could beat competitive threat Cameron. Thankfully, Xavier was able to complete his complicated Christmas sweater puzzle and keep himself in the game. While he wasn&#39;t thrilled to be facing an elimination round, Xavier was happy to have kept himself safe.

Xavier&#39;s time on Big Brother Reindeer Games has already been more difficult than expected, but after facing an early elimination challenge it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s got his head in the game. While Xavier was worried that after having some injuries and needing surgery, he may not be able to compete, it was clear that he had it in him to pull out a win. With Xavier&#39;s competitive threat level higher than it was upon entering the house, it&#39;s possible his target on Big Brother Reindeer Games is bigger now, but he may be able to handle anything the competition throws at him.
