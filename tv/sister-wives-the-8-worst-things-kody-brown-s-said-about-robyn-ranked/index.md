## Literature Review
Sister Wives Kody Brown may only have Robyn Brown left as a wife, but he&#39;s said some pretty terrible things about her in the past several years.




Sister Wives patriarch Kody Brown has been harsh on all of his wives, even Robyn Brown, whom he’s openly admitted he favors over any of his other relationships. Kody and Robyn’s relationship has been difficult for some to understand, especially after he admitted he’s only ever been in love with Robyn during Sister Wives season 18. The couple, who may be renewing their vows for their tenth anniversary in the coming months, are the last romantic pair standing after Kody’s other wives chose to leave their marriages throughout 2021 and 2022. Despite continuing to spend their lives together, Kody has been hard on Robyn recently.
After years together and the breakdown of their large family, Kody and Robyn only have each other outside of their children. While the pair have been closer throughout his breakups with his other wives, Robyn has shared that Kody is still doing his best to push her away whenever possible. Though Kody loves Robyn, he’s never been afraid of being harsh with her, and at times has been incredibly difficult to deal with. Kody has said some horrible things about Robyn in the past, which are more difficult to reconcile with, considering she’s his only remaining wife.

 8  Kody’s Tried To Sabotage His Marriage To Robyn 
He’s Picked Fights With Her Over Menial Things


 







While Kody and Robyn have remained married despite his several breakups, their relationship hasn’t been easy to maintain over the last few years. During Sister Wives season 18 episode 16, Robyn revealed that Kody has been doing everything in his power to push her away after his relationships with Christine Brown, Janelle Brown, and Meri Brown have crumbled. Kody shared that he’s not actively trying to push Robyn away but instead is trying to punish himself for ruining their family. Robyn, on the other hand, was tearful when she shared that Kody has been trying to push her away and picking fights with her, making it clear he&#39;s resisting love.





 7  His Marriage To Robyn “Isn’t The Same” After Divorce 
Kody Feels His Marriage To Robyn Has Shifted
        

Though Kody and Robyn have decided to stay married, things aren’t easy for the only remaining couple in the Brown family. During Sister Wives: One On One, Kody was transparent about changing since experiencing extreme heartbreak. Even though Robyn has been doing her best to keep them together, her relationship with Kody has been more difficult after the fallout with his ex-wives. Kody shared that everything, including his marriage to Robyn, is harder after experiencing not one but three wives choosing to leave their marriages to him. He said their relationship simply “isn’t the same” now, which has left Robyn hurt.





 6  Kody Wants His “Barndominium” To Get Away From Robyn 
He Needs Space For His Things And His Ego
        

During an episode of Sister Wives season 18, Kody explained the plans he has for an upcoming “barndominium” project. He plans to convert the barn on his and Robyn’s property into somewhat of a condo. While he was sharing it as an idea for Meri, he explained that he’ll be creating the space in order to have a storage area for some of his things, and likely to have a space for himself. 
While he’s welcome to have his own domain, the fact that Kody is looking for space away from Robyn and his family is alarming. He needs extra space outside of their home to give himself a place to decompress from the family. By doing this, he&#39;s continuing to push them away and leaving them out of his issues.





 5  Kody Compared Robyn To A Family Pet 
He Explained She’s Loyal And Obedient
        

During Sister Wives season 18 episode 12, Kody compared his only remaining wife, Robyn, to a dog, ignoring the fact that viewers were likely to be outraged by his claims. Kody shared that he feels Robyn is “loyal” and “obedient” as a spouse. While this isn’t necessarily insulting, it’s clear that Kody isn’t aware of just how diminishing his words can be. In calling out traits in Robyn that remind him of an animal, he’s lessening her qualities and speaking about his spouse as though she isn’t a human of her own devices but as property. Kody’s made it clear he values himself over Robyn and their marriage.





 4  “I Vetted Robyn Hard Before I Married Her” 
Kody Treated His Relationship With Robyn Like A Job


Kody’s appearance on Sister Wives: One On One was eye-opening for many reasons, as it was one of the most honest viewers have seen Kody in years. In a candid series of conversations with host Sukanya Krishnan, Kody explained many things about his marriage to Robyn, but one of the most stand-out revelations was about his relationship with Robyn prior to their marriage. Kody explained that he “vetted Robyn hard” before they were initially married, sharing that he wanted to be certain about bringing her into the family. Kody didn’t trust Robyn to share the truth initially but instead relied on others&#39; opinions to allow her into his life.





 3  Robyn Had The “Ick Factor” When Kody Was Courting Her 
He Shared He Didn’t Like Her Public Persona


 







During an earlier season of Sister Wives, Kody shared that he didn’t actually find himself liking Robyn’s public persona while they were courting. Though Kody swears that his marriage with Robyn has been one of the deepest, most highly emotional relationships he’s ever been in, he shared he felt “the ick factor” when he first started courting Robyn. While Kody came to eventually love Robyn, he initially wasn’t interested in her joining the family because she wasn’t attractive to him. Though Kody and Robyn’s relationship has changed over the years, the fact that he wasn’t attracted to her at first or her public persona is degrading.





 2  He Accused Robyn Of Having An STD 
Kody May Have Been Joking, But It Was Harsh
        

While Kody’s been Robyn’s husband for nearly a decade, he made a joke during an earlier season of Sister Wives that alluded to her potentially being unfaithful to him in their marriage. During an earlier season of Sister Wives, Kody joked about Robyn having an STD because of a cold sore she had on her lip. Joking that Robyn may have a sexually transmitted disease wasn’t funny, to begin with, but saying that about his own wife made it clear that Kody doesn’t always have Robyn’s best interest in mind. He may have been kidding, but it was harsh of him to say on camera or at all.





 1  Kody “Hates His Life” With Robyn 
He Says He Wants To Run Away From Everything
        

After discussing the issues he was facing in his other relationships, Kody shared a somewhat disturbing thought about his life on the final episode of Sister Wives: One On One. While talking about how much he’s been struggling, Kody explained he “hates his life” with Robyn and that he&#39;d be willing to run away from everything, including his family, to start all over. Though Kody has been dealing with some genuinely difficult things, hearing that he wants to escape from his life with Robyn couldn’t have been easy for the only person who seems to be fighting for their relationship.
