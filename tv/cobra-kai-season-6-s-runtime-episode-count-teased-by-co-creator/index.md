## Literature Review
Co-creator Hayden Schlossberg reveals the episode count for Cobra Kai season 6, and says the total season runtime will be the longest yet.




Co-creator Hayden Schlossberg reveals the episode count for Cobra Kai season 6, and says the season’s runtime is the longest yet. Netflix’s hugely popular Karate Kid sequel show began life as an unlikely success story for the now-defunct streamer YouTube Red. Six years on from the premiere of Cobra Kai season 1, the show is set to begin production on season 6, which will be the final season for the series, as executive producers revealed back in June 2023.




The Cobra Kai season 6 release date has not yet been set, but co-creator Schlossberg did recently give some interesting updates about the new season, saying it will run for 10 episodes, and will have a longer overall runtime than any previous season. Additionally, Schlossberg said the goal is to release the show in 2024, while also revealing that the final episode will be extra-long (he did not lock down an exact runtime).

 Cobra Kai Season 6 Is Still Aiming For a 2024 Release Date, But Is This Realistic? 
          




Netflix&#39;s Karate Kid sequel show was once known as the series that didn’t make fans wait, releasing seasons 3 and 4 within the calendar year of 2021, and then dropping season 5 in September 2022. That brisk production schedule was interrupted by the twin strikes of 2023, but thankfully, things are ready to crank back up again in January 2024, as star Courtney Henggeler revealed to Screen Rant in a recent interview.



Cobra Kai seasons 1-5 are currently available on Netflix.




Given that Cobra Kai season 6 will be longer than any previous season, as Schlossberg just confirmed, is it realistic to expect the show to meet its goal of releasing new episodes in 2024? Cobra Kai used to release right around New Year’s before breaking its pattern with season 5, so targeting the very end of 2024 might be the logical play. All the same, it might be more reasonable to expect new episodes some time in early 2025. Whenever the new season drops, it seems fans can expect longer Cobra Kai episodes than ever before, with a truly super-sized finale.
