## Literature Review
Blue Bloods season 14 images reveal a first look at the show&#39;s last premiere episode, and teases drama on the way for some of its characters.




New Blue Bloods season 14 images reveal a first look at the premiere episode, and tease more drama on the way. The long-running series revolves around members of the Reagan family, who work within different areas of New York City&#39;s law enforcement and are led by Police Commissioner Frank (Tom Selleck). Along with Selleck, the cast of Blue Bloods includes Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Will Estes, and Len Cariou. While the procedural continues to generate impressive viewership on CBS, it was confirmed back in November that Blue Bloods would be ending after season 14, which is scheduled to premiere on February 16.




Now, TV Insider is revealing what audiences can expect from the Blue Bloods season 14 premiere through a number of first-look photos, one of which previews Jamie&#39;s undercover assignment. Check out the Blue Bloods season 14 photos below:

                  All 13 Seasons Of Blue Bloods, Ranked Worst To Best   Blue Bloods has seen plenty of police drama, heartache, and family issues over its 13 seasons, but some seasons are ranked better than others.     


 What To Expect From Blue Bloods Season 14 
          




In the Blue Bloods season 13 finale, Frank addressed &#34;Mission Open Arms&#34; and expressed frustration over the changes that Mayor Chase was planning. Selleck&#39;s character was faced with a decision involving a center for New York City&#39;s homeless population, which he appeared to support by attending a press conference. Given their strife, it will be interesting to see whether Frank actually supports Mayor Chase in the upcoming episodes, and if the latter&#39;s attempts at coercion continue. Jackie Curatola also returned to Blue Bloods and spent time with Danny. Although she didn&#39;t seem eager to work in the city again, Jennifer Esposito could reprise her role in season 14.

One of the more compelling images teased ahead of the Blue Bloods premiere is that of Jamie, who will reportedly be working undercover, dealing with issues related to human trafficking. The other character shown interacting with him, known as Hader, is played by Aaron Abrams. With not much else known about the final season, it&#39;s worth wondering how long the show will focus on this particular storyline, and how it could potentially affect Jamie should anything go wrong.






The 18 episodes in Blue Bloods season 14 will be split into two parts.




The arrival of Blue Bloods season 14 will likely result in mixed emotions from audiences, along with the series&#39; cast and crew. As the season progresses, many associated with the show will likely comment on its ending. These first-look photos, which only provide a glimpse of what&#39;s to come, suggest that the last installment will be full of drama for its many characters.
