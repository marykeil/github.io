The first two episodes of Love Island: All Stars introduced a major twist. After the 12 singles were paired together by the public, Callum and Molly were brought in. Callum was told that he could steal any of the already coupled-up women, or he could choose Molly. Since the two had reportedly ended on good terms, Callum chose Molly so as not to hurt her feelings. It will be interesting to see if they stay together or whether they move on to pursue relationships with other singles at the villa.
