# New Hunger Games Image Shows One Key Part Of The Books Could ve Been Way Better In The Movies


## SUMMARY 



  Nico Delort&#39;s illustrations for The Hunger Games book highlight how the movie changed the design of the Cornucopia, losing its symbolic meaning.   The original book&#39;s description of the Cornucopia, with a woven horn-like design, better emphasized its association with food and symbolized the brutality of the Hunger Games.   The sadistic nature of the Hunger Games was reflected in the Capitol residents viewing it as a feast, with the tributes&#39; deaths as their meal and the Cornucopia as a twisted centerpiece.

## Literature Review

New illustrations for Suzanne Collins&#39; The Hunger Games book reveals that a key location&#39;s design  changed for the worse in the 2012 movie.




Suzanne Collins’ original The Hunger Games book is getting a new edition with illustrations by Nico Delort, which reveal that a core location from the first novel could have been even better in the 2012 movie. The first book in The Hunger Games series was published in 2008, with the dystopian world being brought to life on the big screen only four years later in the hit 2012 movie of the same name. The five Hunger Games movies, including the prequel The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes, are generally considered to be faithful, thrilling adaptations of the books, but there are still some crucial ways in which the novels reign supreme.




The Hunger Games movie made several book changes when adapting the tale for the screen, and Delort&#39;s new illustrations reveal that there were even bigger differences than previously realized. From the original vision for Katniss and Peeta’s arena in the 74th Hunger Games to a different design for the iconic mockingjay pin, the illustrations offer new looks at important elements of the story that were interpreted differently in the movie. One illustration, in particular, highlights that The Hunger Games movie changing the design of a significant location led to losing a key part of its symbolic meaning.

                  The Hunger Games Books In Order: How To Read By Publication Date &amp; Chronologically   While it&#39;s important to read Suzanne Collins&#39; Hunger Games books in order, there are two ways to do that, and both create very different experiences.   


 New Hunger Games Illustration Shows What The Cornucopia Should Have Looked Like In The 2012 Movie 
          




One of the new illustrations for The Hunger Games book (via EW) gives a glimpse at the arena for the 74th event, including the central Cornucopia. The Cornucopia held the majority of the weapons and supplies that the tributes needed to fight and survive, so many ran directly to its opening once the countdown to begin the games hit zero. In the movie, the silver Cornucopia was designed as a more metallic and mechanical structure only vaguely resembling a real cornucopia, which emphasized the bland modernization of the dystopian society – incongruent with the Capitol’s colorful flamboyance and luxury.

                  6 Ways Snow Changes The Hunger Games After Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes (&amp; Why)   Snow revolutionized the Hunger Games as a mentor, but after Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, he made several more important (&amp; heartless) changes.   

The illustrations, however, give a different interpretation of the Cornucopia, which is more accurate to the 2008 book’s description of the location. In the drawing, the Cornucopia is modeled more similarly to the prototypical horn-shaped container that its name comes from. The tail is curved high into the sky while supplies and boxes spill out of the mouth, emulating a basket decoration one might see at a table on Thanksgiving. This illustration better aligns with the novel’s vision, which describes the Cornucopia as a giant cone-shaped golden horn with a curved tail, mimicking a woven horn at a harvest.






 The Cornucopia In The Hunger Games Book Was A Better Symbol For The Event 
         

The illustration based on the book’s description of the Cornucopia reiterates that Collins’ original design was superior. The woven horn-style design put a greater emphasis on its association with food and a feast, the perfect symbol for the Hunger Games. However, instead of food being in the Cornucopia, it’s blood, weapons, fear, brutality, and survival gear. Rather than running into a container full of nourishment to sustain life, as the cornucopia often symbolizes, the 74th Hunger Games&#39; tributes are ironically running to their deaths.

The closer food harvest-related symbolism of the book’s Cornucopia design better underscores that the sadistic Hunger Games saw the “feast” as the bloodbath that awaited the tributes. The “feast” was the Capitol’s cruelty, as those working on the Games and eagerly watching at home fed on the savagery and bloodthirst to which the tributes had to resort. As they sat in their lavish clothing betting money on their favorite tributes, The Hunger Games’ titular event was the Capitol residents’ Thanksgiving, the deaths of the tributes were their meal, and the Cornucopia was their twisted centerpiece.
