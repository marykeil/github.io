## Literature Review
Twists involving TV villains can be very powerful storytelling tools. However, using them wrongly can result in a show being labeled as terrible.




Whether they deserve the hate or not, TV shows that made fans mad with their villain twists are forever etched into viewers&#39; minds. These unexpected revelations can elicit frustration when they feel forced, inconsistent with character development, or undermine the overall storyline. Audiences may express disappointment when beloved characters take a sudden dark turn without sufficient build-up, or when the twist seems more focused on shock value than coherent storytelling.
Indeed, the most shocking TV twists of all time aren&#39;t all remembered fondly by viewers, as many are considered failures due to perceived mishandling or deviation from established narratives or themes. This includes twists like heroes being revealed to be villains all along, antagonists making confusing decisions, or just poorly-conceived surprises involving the bad guys. In any case, the backlash typically stems from a sense of betrayal, as viewers invest time and emotions into a show, expecting narrative choices that respect the established tone and character arcs. The challenge lies in executing these twists in a way that enhances - rather than detracts from - the overall viewer experience.









 








 10  Gossip Girl (2007-2012) 
Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) was Gossip Girl all along.
        

 Gossip Girl 

 Release Date   July 8, 2021    Cast   Jordan Alexander , Whitney Peak , Tavi Gevinson , Thomas Doherty , Emily Alyn Lind , Eli Brown    Genres   Drama , Romance    Seasons   2    




Among the many things that make no sense about Dan Humphrey, the final twist revealing that Dan is actually Gossip Girl dismayed viewers the most. Throughout the series, Dan participated in discussions about Gossip Girl, making his unmasking seem implausible. Audiences felt the twist undermined the show&#39;s integrity, as it contradicted established storylines and character motivations. The reveal generated frustration as viewers struggled to reconcile Dan&#39;s real identity with his previous behaviors - particularly when he dramatically reacted to Gossip Girl&#39;s new posts while alone. The disappointment stemmed from the perceived mishandling of Gossip Girl&#39;s central mystery, impacting the satisfaction of the series&#39; resolution for many devoted followers.

 9  Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (2018-2020) 
Sabrina Spellman (Kiernan Shipka) embraces her dark side.
        

 Chilling Adventures of Sabrina 

 Release Date   October 26, 2018    Cast   Kiernan Shipka , Ross Lynch , Lucy Davis , Chance Perdomo , Michelle Gomez , Jaz Sinclair , Tati Gabrielle , Adeline Rudolph , Richard Coyle , Miranda Otto    Genres   Horror , Fantasy , Drama    Seasons   1    




It was in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 3 when Sabrina Spellman embraced her darker side and upset long-term viewers of the show. Sabrina was never perfect, and the teenage witch&#39;s antihero personality and backstory are huge parts of why audiences loved her. However, when Sabrina sacrificed the lives of her friends to fetch her boyfriend from Hell - and then risked destroying universes just to grasp at the chance of living a normal life - viewers felt like her selfishly evil turn was out of character. Many viewers found it challenging to reconcile these twists, feeling that they ultimately contradicted Sabrina&#39;s struggles against dark forces in earlier seasons.





 8  The Legend of Korra (2012-2014) 
The Equalist Amon/Noatak (Steven Blum) was actually a bloodbender.
        

 The Legend of Korra 

 Release Date   April 14, 2012    Genres   Fantasy , Animation    Seasons   4    




The Legend of Korra season 1 disappointed many viewers, much of which was due to the convoluted twists involving the real identity of Legend of Korra villain Amon. Amon was the Equalist leader who claimed to be a non-bender with special powers. He had the ability to remove a person&#39;s bending, leveling the playing field for non-benders and earning popular support in Republic City. While the twist that Amon was actually a bloodbender is great, his backstory as the brother of Republic City councilor Tarrlok felt more like a twist from a soap opera rather than an epic fantasy. Thankfully, Legend of Korra recovered and eventually became a better show.





 7  Luke Cage (2016-2018) 
Cornell &#34;Cottonmouth&#34; Stokes (Mahershala Ali) dies midway through season 1.

 Release Date   September 30, 2016    Cast   Frank Whaley , Theo Rossi , Mahershala Ali , Justin Swain , simone missick , Frankie Faison , Jaiden Kaine , Alfre Woodard , Darius Kaleb , Mike Colter , Kellen C Wingate , erik laray harvey    Genres   Action , Superhero , Drama    Seasons   2    




Unlike most villain twists that made viewers mad, Cottonmouth&#39;s sudden demise left viewers distressed for an entirely different reason - the season 1 antagonist was arguably the best character in Luke Cage. The twist, killing him midway, defied conventional storytelling, surprising fans invested in his complexity. Audiences anticipated a prolonged clash between him and Luke Cage, but the unexpected turn subverted those expectations. Losing such a nuanced character early on impacted the show&#39;s dynamic, leaving fans mourning the potential for further exploration of Cottonmouth&#39;s intriguing backstory and motivations. As he served as the perfect foil for Luke Cage, Cottonmouth&#39;s untimely death was a memorable and unsettling moment for viewers.

 6  Scandal (2012-2018) 
Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) becomes the head of B613.


 







 Scandal 

 Release Date   May 4, 2012    Cast   Kerry Washington , Tony Goldwyn , Scott Foley    Genres   Drama    Seasons   7    




Scandal&#39;s Olivia Pope isn&#39;t exactly a hero, and it&#39;s why audiences love the ambitious power broker. However, even Olivia&#39;s most loyal viewers drew the line when she became the head of B613 in Scandal season 6. Rather than grabbing the opportunity to erase the dangerous cabal she fought so hard against in earlier seasons, Olivia became its leader. Although she did have aims of using B613&#39;s resources for the greater good, it&#39;s obvious that she did this to get back at her father, and to serve her own selfish ends. However, even for Olivia, becoming head of B613 - instead of destroying it - seemed out of character.





 5  The 100 (2014) 
Bellamy (Bob Morley) gets killed by Clarke (Eliza Taylor).
        

 The 100 

 Release Date   March 19, 2014    Cast   Devon Bostick , Christopher Larkin , Marie Avgeropoulos , Sachin Sahel , Richard Harmon , Chelsey Reist , Henry Ian Cusick , Bob Morley , Jarod Joseph , Paige Turco , Adina Porter , Ricky Whittle , Eliza Taylor , Isaiah Washington , Lindsey Morgan , Tasya Teles    Genres    Sci-Fi , Mystery , Drama    Seasons   7    




The reason why Bellamy died in The 100 boils down to how the show revolves around the central themes of survival and sacrifice. While Bellamy could be considered a villain in earlier parts of the show, he became much more than that before his death in The 100 season 7. Considering Bellamy&#39;s complex backstory, redemption arc, achievements, and the hardships he survived, it angered audiences that Bellamy was killed by his long-time best friend and co-leader Clarke. Ultimately, viewers thought that not only did Bellamy deserve better, but that Clarke pulling the trigger was out of character, even if she did it to save someone else.





 4  Pretty Little Liars (2010-2017) 
CeCe Drake (Vanessa Ray) is revealed to be transgender.
        

 Pretty Little Liars 

 Release Date   June 8, 2010    Cast   Troian Bellisario , Ashley Benson , Holly Marie Combs , Lucy Hale , Bianca Lawson , Laura Leighton , Chad Lowe , Shay Mitchell , Nia Peeples , Ian Harding    Genres   Drama , Mystery    Seasons   7    




Cece being revealed as transgender in Pretty Little Liars season 6 sparked controversy for several reasons. Viewers felt the twist perpetuated harmful stereotypes, portraying transgender individuals as deceitful or villainous. The show&#39;s lack of nuanced representation and failure to consult with the transgender community contributed to the backlash. Many argued that the storyline trivialized the challenges faced by transgender individuals by using their identity as a shocking plot twist. Sensitivity and proper representation are crucial when addressing LGBTQ&#43; themes in media, and many fans felt that Pretty Little Liars fell short in handling this narrative, leading to disappointment and frustration among the audience.

 3  Dexter (2006-2013) 
Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) fakes his death.
        

 Dexter 

 Release Date   October 31, 2010    Cast   David Zayas , Michael C. Hall , Lauren Velez , C. S. Lee , James Remar , Jennifer Carpenter , Desmond Harrington , Julie Benz    Genres   Crime , Mystery , Drama    Seasons   8    




As the narrative decision seemed to negate the character growth and moral dilemmas explored throughout the series, Dexter faking his death in the finale upset audiences and felt like an unsatisfying resolution to the original story. Viewers invested in the character&#39;s complex journey were disappointed by the lack of closure and consequences for his actions. Dexter&#39;s escape from accountability contradicted the show&#39;s earlier themes, leaving viewers feeling cheated. The conclusion raised questions about the integrity of the narrative and left a lingering sense of dissatisfaction. Notably, however, the Dexter: New Blood ending did remedy this problem by giving the iconic antihero the finale he deserved.





 2  Once Upon A Time (2011-2018) 
Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) turns into the Dark One.


 







 Once Upon A Time 

 Release Date   October 3, 2011    Cast   Ginnifer Goodwin , josh dallas , Lana Parrilla , Robert Carlyle , Jennifer Morrison , Jared Gilmore    Genres   Romance , Fantasy , Adventure    Seasons   7    




Since the beginning of the show, viewers have been invested in Emma Swan&#39;s growth from a reluctant savior to a strong, altruistic character. This is why Emma Swan&#39;s transformation into the Dark One in Once Upon A Time season 4 dismayed viewers. Long-time audiences felt that it undermined the show&#39;s central themes of hope and redemption, as Emma&#39;s struggle with darkness seemed abrupt and out of character. Arguably, Emma&#39;s villain twist in Once Upon A Time diminished the impact of previous storylines and character development, betraying the essence of her journey and clashing heavily with the established tone and themes of the show.





 1  Game of Thrones (2011-2019) 
Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) becomes the Mad Queen and burns King&#39;s Landing.


 







 Game Of Thrones 

 Release Date   April 11, 2011    Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Genres   Drama , Action , Adventure    Seasons   8    




Out of all the TV shows that made fans mad with their villain twists, none are more notorious than Game of Thrones. While there are several things wrong with Game of Thrones season 8, Daenerys Targaryen going against 7 seasons of character development remains one of the most offensive twists in TV history. Indeed, Daenerys was among the promised saviors of Westeros, whose resolve to help others was only matched by the legitimacy of her claim to the Iron Throne. Although Daenerys deciding to burn instead of free King&#39;s Landing is consistent with the show&#39;s dark themes, it&#39;s ultimately a disservice to one of the best characters in modern fantasy.
