## Literature Review
A brand new Young Sheldon season 7 promo hints at the unexpected return of a divisive character that will make the Coopers&#39; lives a bit complicated. 




A brand new Young Sheldon season 7 hype video hints at the return of a divisive character. Sheldon and the rest of his family are just a month away from returning to the small screen for the final time, and their upcoming comeback is expected to be met with nervous anticipation. Aside from having to transition Sheldon from Texas to his eventual life in California, as seen in The Big Bang Theory, the shortened Young Sheldon season 7 also needs to tackle all the other lingering plot lines that involve the Coopers.




Young Sheldon season 6 was a milestone year for the CBS comedy. Years of gradually transforming itself from The Big Bang Theory prequel that centers on Sheldon to a more dynamic family show finally resulted in more layered and nuanced storytelling. Proof that the change worked was the series posting show-high ratings throughout its 2022-2023 year, coupled with its latest Netflix success, and it&#39;s safe to say that its fan base expanded significantly coming into its final year. So, while CBS has yet to release any official new material for Young Sheldon season 7, the season 6 recap clip teases what&#39;s next for Sheldon and his family.


 Pastor Rob Gets The Spotlight In New Young Sheldon Video 
          

The Young Sheldon season 6 recap video mainly focuses on the Cooper family, rehashing the big storylines for each character. For Sheldon, that&#39;s his move to Germany for the summer. Meanwhile, Missy&#39;s highlight is her tearful apology to her dad during the Medford tornado. The birth of Georgie and Mandy&#39;s baby and Meemaw&#39;s house being destroyed are also touched upon. One stand-out moment from the clip, however, is Pastor Rob&#39;s return — a scene lifted when he barged in at the hospital while Mandy was in labor. The scene sticks out because he&#39;s the only non-Cooper family member to have significant screen time in the promo.




Releasing the Young Sheldon season 6 recap video functions as a reminder of the important plots coming into season 7; it also hints at what narratives to expect in the show&#39;s final stretch. Prominently featuring Pastor Rob could be an indication that not only will he return, but he will play a significant part in the comedy&#39;s last year. This will be a great curve ball thrown at Mary and George, especially in light of the latter&#39;s upcoming death. It&#39;s still uncertain if Young Sheldon will show the tragedy on-screen, but Pastor Rob&#39;s presence will certainly add a layer of drama to the family show&#39;s send-off season.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7&#39;s Finale Was Already Revealed 6 Years Ago   Young Sheldon will end when Sheldon moves out of the Cooper household and to California — something that was already similarly revealed back in 2018.    



 Why Pastor Rob Still Needs To Return In Young Sheldon Season 7 
          




Young Sheldon writers need to be discerning which plots they want to highlight in its shortened final season. There is a plethora of arcs that it can still explore, which is a huge part of why ending it with season 7 is so disappointing, but Pastor Rob and Mary&#39;s storyline, in particular, needs a definitive resolution, considering that it was never brought up in The Big Bang Theory. It would seem odd that something that significantly impacted the already flimsy marital situation of Sheldon&#39;s parents never got a proper ending. At the very least, at least Mary has been able to straighten things out with Brenda — George&#39;s rumored mistress.

             Young Sheldon A spinoff of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon follows the youth and coming-of-age of Sheldon Cooper during his childhood in Texas as he pursues science and academia. The show also follows his parents, siblings, and Mee-Maw, painting a picture of the world where Sheldon grew up.
