## Literature Review
One surprising Gilmore Girls detail changes how to perceive Roryâ€™s relationship history, and her fate in a potential season 9.




A surprising statistic involving Rory Gilmore&#39;s boyfriends completely changes how to view her relationship history while also proving why Gilmore Girls season 9 is needed. Running for seven seasons, Gilmore Girls followed pivotal moments in the lives of Lorelai and her daughter, Rory. The youngest Gilmore, of course, experienced high school, college, and entry into her much-dreamed-about journalism career throughout the show. Granted, Gilmore Girls also documented social aspects, including friendships and romantic relationships.




Throughout Gilmore Girls&#39; seven seasons, Rory had four boyfriends, with three of them serious: Dean Forester, Jess Mariano, and Logan Huntzberger. Though she turned down Logan&#39;s marriage proposal at the end of Gilmore Girls season 7, she was still involved with him in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, which served as the unofficial season 8 of the series. By this point, Rory was in her early 30s, and Logan was engaged to someone else, implying that she didn&#39;t have a future with him outside of the affair. Other factors set up this notion, which could lead to a potential Gilmore Girls season 9.


 Jess Is In Way Fewer Gilmore Girls Episodes Than Dean Or Logan 
         

Considering Dean, Jess, and Logan were Rory&#39;s primary love interests throughout Gilmore Girls, there are often debates about who she should have ended up with. While Dean was her first love, stirring up the sentimental side of the debate, Logan seemed to be the one that Rory couldn&#39;t let go of. However, Jess always carried a loyal fan following after shedding his bad-boy mystique and showing impressive growth with his maturity over the years. Shockingly, Jess was in the least amount of Gilmore Girls episodes compared to Dean or Logan.




 Character  Episode Count   Dean  62   Logan  52   Jess  39   



Despite being a main character in Gilmore Girls seasons 2 and 3, in addition to a season 4 recurring role and future guest appearances, Milo Ventimiglia&#39;s Jess only appeared in 39 episodes total. Even with those appearances, a portion of his focus relied on his relationship with Luke rather than Rory, whereas Rory was the driving force behind Dean and Logan&#39;s relevance to the show. Even in his fewer episode appearances, Jess showed immense emotional growth and proved that he would always be one of Rory&#39;s biggest supporters in life.



 Gilmore Girls Season 9 Needs More Rory &amp; Jess (&amp; Year In The Life Set It Up) 
          




Gilmore Girls: Year in the Life undid Rory&#39;s original ending by revealing she was pregnant. The assumption was that the baby was Logan&#39;s, considering their affair was still recent. However, Jess&#39; involvement in Year in the Life stirred up hope that the baby was actually Jess&#39;. Since Ventimiglia came in and out of Rory&#39;s life, Jess was essentially set up as Rory&#39;s Luke-life character, standing by until the stars align. With Rory and Jess reconnecting in A Year in the Life, another revival in Gilmore Girls season 9 could finally bring them together for good.

While it would be an exciting surprise for Gilmore Girls season 9 to reveal that the father of Rory&#39;s baby is Jess, even if it&#39;s Logan or another man, that doesn&#39;t mean she will end up with that person. That still leaves the door open for Jess, who certainly is &#34;long over&#34; Rory, as he suggested in A Year in the Life. The pair had always supported each other professionally, but it would be thrilling to see them tackle something like parenthood. More Rory and Jess wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing for the future of Gilmore Girls, and a season 9 centered on the duo could give more satisfying closure compared to A Year in the Life&#39;s cliffhanger.
