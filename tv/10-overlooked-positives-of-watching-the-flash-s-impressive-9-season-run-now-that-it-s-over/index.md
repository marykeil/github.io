Throughout nine seasons, The Flash presented some exciting stories, characters, and visuals that might have been overlooked; however, a look back at the finished DC series reveals just how much The Flash got right. Grant Gustin was perfectly cast to play Barry Allen, even if the actor did not resemble the hero physically, with Gustin setting a constant, high-quality bar that would only get higher as the seasons went by. Gustin first debuted as Barry in Arrow season 2, going on to lead The Flash&#39;s nine seasons, with the series ending and concluding the Arrowverse in 2023.
The Flash started strong, with the first three seasons of the series introducing classic comic book characters and stories. The series came as a breath of fresh air to the Arrowverse, opening the shared DC TV universe to superpowers. While it is true that The Flash started to falter as it went on, the series always managed to have some positive aspects throughout its long run, and when The Flash was at its best, it managed to blow the competition out of the water. Here are 10 overlooked positives of The Flash&#39;s nine-season run now that it is over.
            
 
 10 Most Brutal Deaths In All 9 Seasons Of The Flash 
As the Arrowverse&#39;s longest series, Grant Gustin&#39;s The Flash featured many deaths over its nine seasons, and some of them were particularly brutal.







 10  The Flash Featured Many Iconic DC Comics Heroes &amp; Villains 
Reverse-Flash, Kid Flash, Captain Cold... The List Goes On


 







Each season of The Flash featured incredible characters, promoting the Arrowverse debuts — and, in multiple cases, the live-action debuts — of several classic characters from DC Comics. Barry Allen met several Arrowverse heroes and villains throughout the years, with many of them first appearing in The Flash. From good speedsters like Wally West and Jay Garrick to evil speedsters such as Reverse-Flash and Zoom, The Flash brought to life crucial characters from DC Comics. That tradition would continue all the way through The Flash&#39;s nine-season run, ranging from the Rogues to more recent comic book characters like Red Death. DC fans got to see some of their favorites on the show.


 9  The Original Team Flash Was Great 
Their Dynamic Made The DC Show Special
        

One of the most criticized aspects of The Flash over the years was Team Flash. Many believe that by constantly relying on other characters, Barry hardly gets the chance to be his own hero, having little agency despite being the title character of the series. While the concern is valid, the original Team Flash of Barry, Cisco, and Caitlin had excellent chemistry, being one of the factors that made the series so popular from the get-go. As new additions came in to differing results and Cisco later left the show, Team Flash lost most of its magic, but the original trio stands as a beacon of The Flash&#39;s best seasons.


 8  The Flash Had Several Amazing Standalone Episodes 
The Arrowverse Series&#39; &#34;Filler&#34; Was Not All Bad
        

With 20-episode seasons, The Flash was not able to stretch out its main stories for the entire season, which led to a huge number of standalone episodes over the Arrrowverse series&#39; nine seasons. While some of those bottle episodes were boring and nothing more than filler until the main story of the season was resumed, a lot of them provided exciting one-off stories. Barry entering Flashtime to stop a bomb was an instant classic, with other fun episodes like the Supergirl crossover musical &#34;Duet&#34; and Barry getting the power of speed thinking in &#34;The Speed of Thought&#34; showing how The Flash&#39;s standalone episodes&#39; stories could go in wildly different directions.


 7  The Reverse-Flash Vs Flash Dynamic Was Always On Point 
Eobard Thawne Was The Show&#39;s Best Villain


 







The Flash had several great villains; however, no other foe in the Arrowverse series came close to topping Reverse-Flash. Whenever Reverse-Flash showed up, the character was always an absolute menace, proving himself to be one of the most entertaining charcaters on the show. It is a testament to the talent of The Flash&#39;s cast that while two different actors played Reverse-Flash — with Matt Letscher as Eobard Thawne&#39;s true face and Tom Cavanagh playing the character with Harrison Wells&#39; face — the villain&#39;s dynamic with Barry always remained on point, with both actors fully embodying Reverse-Flash to the point the character was the same no matter what face he had.


 6  Barry Allen’s Suit Kept Getting Better 
The Flash Series Has The Hero&#39;s Best Live-Action Costumes
        

The Flash season one featured a leathery look for the hero, with many iconic details from the speedster&#39;s classic comic book costume missing and others still in need of tweaks to look comic book-accurate, such as the initial red emblem. As the seasons went by, Gustin&#39;s The Flash suit would only get better. The red emblem would turn white, The Flash&#39;s iconic golden boots would be added to the costume, the material would go from leather to spandex, and more. While later seasons of The Flash might have had some issues, the speedster&#39;s suit mostly escaped criticism.

 5  The Flash Made The Multiverse Popular In Live-Action 
The Multiverse Would Become A Major Element Of Superhero Movies &amp; Series
        

Flashpoint, the Council of Wells, and more would lead to The Flash&#39;s foray into the multiverse making the concept extremely popular in live-action superhero projects. If the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in the middle of its Multiverse Saga at the moment and the DCEU&#39;s The Flash movie featured a journey through different universes, it all comes back to Gustin&#39;s The Flash. The show introduced different Earths, doppelgängers and more, paving the way for the Arrowverse&#39;s best crossovers and the multiverse to be as popular as it is today, with Grant&#39;s Barry Allen becoming famous for messing with timelines and alternate universes.


 4  The Flash Respected The Character’s Live Action History 
DC&#39;s The Flash Movie Could Have Learned From The Series
        

Gustin might be the most popular version of Barry Allen ever, but there was one actor who played the character in his own The Flash series years before. John Wesley Shipp gave life to Barry in The Flash show from the 1990s. Gustin&#39;s The Flash honored that iteration of the franchise multiple times over the years, with feats that included having Shipp play three characters in the Arrowverse series — Henry Allen, Jay Garrick, and his Barry Allen — as well as Mark Hamill appearing as a new version of the Trickster, who he played in Shipp&#39;s The Flash. That level of respect could have helped DC&#39;s The Flash movie.


 3  The Flash Featured An Unprecedented Arrowverse X DCEU Crossover 
DC&#39;s Movie &amp; TV Universes Collided


 







While &#34;Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Four&#34; is technically an Arrow episode, all five parts of the crossover are needed in turn for The Flash and the other main Arrowverse shows&#39; seasons involved in Crisis on Infinite Earths to make sense. Gustin&#39;s Barry Allen met his DCEU counterpart, played by Ezra Miller, thanks to the multiverse. The moment was shocking due to it being the first time that a shared superhero movie and TV universes really crossed over, with Miller&#39;s Barry Allen even getting his hero name from Gustin&#39;s. Sadly, The Flash movie failed to have the duo interact again, as Gustin was not one of The Flash&#39;s multiverse cameos.


 2  The Flash Played A Lot With Its Tone 
The DC Series Knew When To Get Dark Or Light
        

Over its nine seasons, The Flash featured a refreshing mix between levity and darkness. Most seasons danced around the two tones, while others, such as The Flash season 3 — the series&#39; darkest — leaned heavily toward one side. That aspect of the Arrowverse series helped make Gustin&#39;s nine seasons of The Flash entertaining. For instance, even The Flash season 3, which dealt mostly with Iris&#39; impending death, featured a musical crossover with Supergirl. The mix led to the calmer moments helping build out characters and the urgency of the dark episodes showing how much audiences really cared about Barry and the others.


 1  The Thinker Was Actually An Interesting Villain 
DeVoe Was The Flash&#39;s First Non-Speedster Main Villain
        

While the Thinker was not as entertaining to watch as foes like Reverse-Flash and Zoom, the Thinker presented one of the biggest challenges that Barry faced in the series. After three seasons with speedsters as main villains, having a human foe like the Thinker was refreshing. Clifford DeVoe being extremely smart to the point where he successfully framed Barry Allen for murder and had the hero be sentenced to life in prison showed how sinister he was. The Thinker&#39;s meta-human murder spree was something that many future villains were never able to match, making him one of The Flash&#39;s most underrated elements.
