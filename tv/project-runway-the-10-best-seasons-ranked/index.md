 10  Project Runway Season 14 
Ashley Nell Tipton Won
        

Project Runway season 14 kicked off with a bang and some strong scores with its debut and early episodes. Boasting the intro episode &#34;Road to the Runway&#34; and a reunion, which brought the ratings down slightly, the primary season comprised 14 episodes. Some brilliant Project Runway celebrity guest judges, including Ashley Tisdale and Bella Thorne of Disney Channel fame, appeared, and there were some truly unique challenges. Highlights include &#34;Broadway Or Bust,&#34; where the designers had to create outfits inspired by famous stage shows, and &#34;The Runways in 3D!&#34; where 3D printing techniques were utilized. Designer Ashley Nell Tipton won the season.





 9  Project Runway Season 8 
Had Great Talent
        

Season 8&#39;s scores do not include a run-up show or a reunion piece, as these were less common earlier in Project Runway&#39;s run. However, by season 8, the show had found its footing and began to really recognize and work with some of its core strengths. The crop of talent for the season was truly extraordinary, with Gretchen Jones being one of the most controversial wins of the show. She beat the beloved Mondo Guerra, who later made his mark in All Stars&#39; &#34;There&#39;s a Pattern Here,&#34; where the designers had to create their patterned fabric.





 8  Project Runway Season 11 
Winner Michelle Lesniak Franklin Had Unique Style


 







&#34;Road To The Runway&#34; and the reunion special were back again for season 11, which benefitted from a hot start to the show with the reveal of a team challenge. The season&#39;s low point came when the teams had to design garments for the famous &#34;Thunder from Down Under&#34; show but quickly rose to success again with &#34;The Art of Fashion&#34; textiles challenge. The 15-episode run once again had some truly tremendous talent. Ultimately, Michelle Lesniak Franklin would claim the top crown and leave Project Runway as the victor, as she demonstrated a unique style throughout the various challenges.





 7  Project Runway Season 12 
Included A Few Bizzare Challenges
        

Season 12 demonstrated that Project Runway had found its groove and could deliver consistent quality. Some staple challenges had been formed and the intro and reunion shows had become a mainstay. Dom Streater was named the winner of this season after facing some of the toughest challenges to date. The show once again hooked viewers with this season&#39;s bizarre challenge of designing clothing from parachutes. The glamping challenge was also a fun twist on the conventional.





 6  Project Runway Season 9 
Several Personalities Made This Season One To Remember


 







Season 9 really delivered throughout its run, mainly due to the personalities. Anya Ayoung-Chee was named the winner of the season after showcasing a wide variety of beautiful fabrics and an unmistakable style in all of her work. Oddly enough, season 9 boasted a &#34;Behind the Seams&#34; episode, which made it a little worse, as well as &#34;Image is Everything,&#34; in which designers had to create outfits for an edgy up-and-coming band. Additionally, Exotic Birds Week was a welcome departure from the norm.





 5  Project Runway Season 6 
&#34;Lights, Camera, Sew!&#34; Was A Memorable Challenge
        

Considering how early into Project Runway&#39;s run this season was, it&#39;s surprising how hard it really hit it out of the park. A set of talented designers elevated each challenge, with Irina Shabayeva ultimately taking home the crown thanks to her unique outlook on her designs. A memorable moment of the season was undoubtedly &#34;Lights, Camera, Sew!&#34; in which contestants had to design outfits based on famous film genres.

The Best Season For Capitalizing On Recent Trends


 







By season 15, Project Runway had totally come into its own. With a long list of winners and accolades, Erin Robertson took home the title after several impressive prints in the finale. The show launched with the unconventional materials challenge, which immediately pushed the designers&#39; skills and moved into several different avenues, including swimwear and a pop-up shop. Looking to evolve still, season 15 might have been one of the best for capitalizing on recent trends.





 3  Project Runway Season 10 
Perfect Season For Fashion Lovers
        

Season 10 was definitely a great season for fashion lovers and one that brought with it a host of unique personalities. In fact, the season finale might have been one of the most closely contested to date, making it a nail-biting season to watch. Dmitry Sholokhov was ultimately named champion for Project Runway season 10, as he looked to bring some contemporary and unique designs into his work. With some team challenges, a makeover episode, and a live runway show in New York, the showrunners certainly kept the contestants on their toes.

Designed Clothes For A Rock Stars Wedding
        

Season 13 contained some unique personalities, with Sean Kelly chosen to grace the hallowed halls of Project Runway winners. As one of the biggest seasons of the show, Project Runway season 13 stepped it up a notch with the scale of some of their challenges. The American Girl Store episode was one of the season&#39;s highlights, as was the avant-garde challenge. The contestants even designed clothing for a rock star&#39;s wedding day.





 1  Project Runway Season 16 
The Best Season So Far
        

By Season 16, Project Runway had been cemented as the top of its genre. While other competition shows might have been in development, season 16 demonstrated why Project Runway is such a hit. Won by the inventive Kentaro Kameyama, every contestant truly brought their all at each stage, elevating one another to greatness. There were mesmerizing designs amid the controversy of a cheating scandal. Breast cancer survivors, health and safety workers, and those &#34;on the go&#34; are just some of the people for whom the designers created art.
