# Ahsoka Has Made One Untold Clone Wars Story More Important Than Ever


## SUMMARY 



  Ahsoka&#39;s introduction in Star Wars: The Clone Wars has led to exciting tie-ins, including the inclusion of the Nightsisters and their significance to the New Republic era.   The Nightsisters&#39; origin and their alliance with Grand Admiral Thrawn on Dathomir make them essential to the future of The Mandalorian era and the broader Star Wars galaxy.   The Purge of Dathomir, a significant event in Nightsister history, was intended to be shown in The Clone Wars but was ultimately excluded. This storyline was later wrapped up in the Darth Maul - Son of Dathomir comic series.

## Literature Review
Ahsoka has made this one un-aired Star Wars: The Clone Wars story essential to the future of the New Republic era - and the entire Star Wars galaxy.




Ahsoka has made an un-aired Star Wars: The Clone Wars story more significant than it ever was before. Ahsoka has had lots of exciting tie-ins to The Clone Wars, which is unsurprising given the fact the character of Ahsoka Tano was first introduced in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie. Some of the tie-ins have been the Siege of Mandalore and the Jedi architect droid Huyang. However, there is one tie-in to an untold The Clone Wars story that has massive implications for the future of the New Republic era.




The Nightsisters of Dathomir officially arrived in the Star Wars canon in The Clone Wars, with Asajj Ventress being just one of the notable Nightsisters featured in the animated series. Ahsoka officially brought the full-force of Nightsisters to live-action, following The Mandalorian season 2&#39;s tease of their return with Morgan Elsbeth. This has not only added to Ahsoka&#39;s impressive count of The Clone Wars tie-ins, but it has also set the Nightsisters up for an essential future to the Star Wars galaxy - especially because of their untold The Clone Wars story.

                  When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline   Ahsoka is the latest Star Wars Disney&#43; TV show, featuring the return of iconic Rebels characters - but where does it fit into the timeline?    


 Dathomir &amp; The Nightsisters Are Essential To Ahsoka &amp; The Mandalorian Era 
          




In Ahsoka, viewers learned the Nightsisters originated from the extragalactic planet of Peridea. It was there the Great Mothers formed their alliance with Grand Admiral Thrawn, working on his behalf in exchange for passage back to their homeworld of Dathomir. The end of Ahsoka seems to tease they are less than pleased with this current arrangement of Thrawn making their homeworld a secret base, which may see them change allegiances soon. Either way, they have proven they are essential to the future of The Mandalorian era, whether they continue to serve Thrawn or become their own threat to the rest of the Star Wars galaxy.



 The Purge Of Dathomir Is The Biggest Event In Recent Nightsister History 
          

During the Clone Wars, the Nightsisters proved to be a thorn in the Sith&#39;s side. They served themselves rather than any one side of the war. This was shown when Count Dooku abandoned his apprentice, Asajj Ventress, leaving her grievously injured as she sought Mother Talzin for help. As a Nightsister by birth, she was accepted, and the tight-knit nature of the Nightsisters caused them to fight alongside Ventress for revenge. They used their dark magick to torture Dooku, and helped Ventress break into his room in an assassination attempt. This, however, didn&#39;t go to plan, and many Nightsisters were killed by Dooku.




Because of their allegiance to themselves and the power they possessed, Palpatine wanted the Nightsisters dead. As such, he ordered their genocide, and General Grievous laid siege to Dathomir under Palpatine&#39;s orders. While part of the Purge of Dathomir was shown in The Clone Wars season 4 episode &#34;Massacre,&#34; the full extent of the Purge was not shown. The Clone Wars only aired the First Battle of Dathomir; it left out the Second Battle of Dathomir, which saw the final defeat of Mother Talzin and thus the murder of the last Nightsister on Dathomir, completing the horrific genocide.

                  Clone Wars Timeline Explained: When Each Season Takes Place (Including The Bad Batch)   All seven non-chronological seasons of The Clone Wars take place within a three-year period, but where does one year end and the next begin?    



 Why The Clone Wars Never Showed The Purge Of Dathomir 
         




The full Purge of Dathomir was actually meant to be shown in The Clone Wars. After it was canceled, however, certain story arcs were left unfinished, and one of these story arcs was the Purge of Dathomir. There was supposed to be an episode called &#34;Showdown on Dathomir&#34; that would have featured the Second Battle of Dathomir. Aida Mashaka Croal and Matt Michnovetz had already scripted the episode, and it was intended to air during season 7, but the script was abandoned after the show&#39;s cancelation. While The Clone Wars did eventually return for a final wrap-up season, this arc was not included.



 The Clone Wars&#39; Missing Dathomir Arc Was Told In Tie-In Comics 
This arc wasn&#39;t included because it was actually wrapped up in the four-part comic series Darth Maul - Son of Dathomir six years before The Clone Wars season 7 aired. This comic faithfully adapted Croal and Michnovetz&#39;s unused script. After the First Battle of Dathomir, Mother Talzin and her son, Darth Maul, continued to cause problems for Palpatine. They kidnapped Count Dooku so that Mother Talzin could drain his life force and restore her original body.




This prompted Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, and General Grievous to launch a rescue mission. The battle was a fierce one, with Mother Talzin even possessing Dooku at one point. However, Darth Sidious managed to free Count Dooku, and General Grievous killed Mother Talzin. While Maul escaped with the help of his Mandalorian allies, there wasn&#39;t a single Nightsister left alive on Dathomir.



 Will Viewers Ever Get To See Maul: Son Of Dathomir? 
         

The possibility of an animated (or live-action) Clone Wars: Son of Dathomir movie cannot be ruled out. While no plans for such a movie have been announced, Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 7 was wildly popular. Not only that, but with the Nightsisters and Dathomir becoming a key element of Ahsoka&#39;s story, it would make sense for this important arc to be made into a movie.




The crates they brought with them were likely full of Nightsisters in some sort of stasis. Since Thrawn&#39;s first stop was Dathomir, it appears that the Great Mothers may intend to re-populate Dathomir and bring back the Nightsisters&#39; culture. The Great Mothers haven&#39;t yet specified exactly why they are working with Thrawn, or why they hold some apprehension towards him, but they do still seem to see him as a kind of savior. If he helps them bring back their culture, it will explain why they are willing to submit to his authority.



The Nightsisters have proven they are essential to the future of The Mandalorian era, whether they continue to serve Thrawn or become their own threat to the rest of the Star Wars galaxy.




A Clone Wars: Son of Dathomir movie could be very important to a potential Ahsoka season 2. Since the Great Mothers were able to send Morgan Elsbeth dreams across galaxies and sense her death, they likely felt the genocide of their people. A Clone Wars: Son Of Dathomir movie could not only show the Purge of Dathomir, but it could also give more details about the Great Mothers and their motivations, thus proving how Ahsoka is just the first step in unveiling their true importance to the future of the Star Wars galaxy.
