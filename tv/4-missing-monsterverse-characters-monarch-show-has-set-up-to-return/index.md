# 4 Missing Monsterverse Characters Monarch Show Has Set Up To Return


## SUMMARY 


 Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has set the stage for four pre-established Monsterverse characters to potentially appear in future episodes, including Walter Simmons, Ford Brody, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa, and Dr. Houston Brooks. 
 
 The developments in the series suggest that Walter Simmons, despite his death in Godzilla vs. Kong, could make a return in a future episode due to APEX&#39;s involvement in the unfolding story. 

 Ford Brody, the human protagonist from the 2014 Godzilla film, could become relevant again if Duvall, his aunt in the series, survives season 1 and needs allies in season 2, potentially leading to a cameo by Brody.

## Literature Review
Gradually, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has laid the groundwork for four more characters from previous movies to make appearances in the Monsterverse.




Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has already laid the groundwork for four pre-established Monsterverse characters to appear once more in Godzilla and Kong&#39;s cinematic world. While most Monsterverse movies feature their own casts, they do have a tendency to feature a familiar face or two. That will also be true of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&#39;s cast, which will include three characters from Godzilla vs. Kong: Bernie, Dr. Andrews, and Jia.


Similarly, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has given a significant role to John Goodman&#39;s Bill Randa from Kong: Skull Island. In addition to bringing back Goodman for a cameo, the show has made its younger version of Randa, played by Anders Holm, an integral part of the series as well as a major player in Monarch&#39;s history in the Monsterverse. Aside from Randa, no other characters have returned. However, developments in the series have opened the door for four of them to make appearances.




 4  Walter Simmons 
Played by DemiÃ¡n Bichir in Godzilla vs. Kong
        

Making his first and only appearance in Godzilla vs. Kong, Walter Simmons was the head of APEX and the main human villain of the crossover. He met his end at the hands of his own creation when Mechagodzilla developed some sense of free will and attacked during Simmons&#39; villainous speech. That seemed to be the end of his story, but the big twist in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 7 makes his return a real possibility for future episodes.


As it turns out, APEX is the reason why May has been on the run. The reveal that AET is really APEX was foreshadowed early on by May mentioning &#34;Walter&#34; to Brenda Holland. And in Holland&#39;s last scene, she was shown addressing APEX&#39;s plans on the phone with an off-screen Simmons. Now that APEX has been made a part of the unfolding story, there&#39;s a chance Simmons himself could show up, possibly in a season 2 episode. After all, his death is several years away at this point in the Monsterverse timeline.




 3  Ford Brody 
Played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Godzilla
        

Despite his role as the human protagonist of the 2014 Godzilla reboot that launched the Monsterverse, Ford Brody hasn&#39;t been seen since. Admittedly, his absence makes sense; unless he were to join Monarch, he wouldn&#39;t have a clear place in any of its movies. However, a seemingly throwaway line in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 6 reveals how Ford could become relevant again. Duvall noted that the death of her sister, Sanda, in Janjira is the reason she works for Monarch. It&#39;s no coincidence, of course, that Ford&#39;s mother, also named &#34;Sandra,&#34; died in the incident at Janjira that set the movie&#39;s story in motion.


Making Duvall the aunt of Ford Brody creates a pathway for the character to appear in the series. If Duvall survives season 1 and remains at odds with Monarch going into the next season, she could be placed in a position where she needs allies. That could lead her to contact Ford, whom she may know had his own encounter with Godzilla in 2014. If such a scenario were to transpire, Ford could make a cameo in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2. Naturally, this avenue would depend largely on Aaron Taylor-Johnsons&#39;s availability.




 2  Dr. Ishiro Serizawa 
Played by Ken Watanabe in Godzilla and Godzilla: King of the Monsters
        

Arguably the most important human character in the Monsterverse, Ken Watanabe&#39;s Dr. Ishiro Serizawa made the ultimate sacrifice in Godzilla: King of the Monsters to save Godzilla. Activating a nuclear bomb to undo the military&#39;s mistake of using the Oxygen Destroyer on Godzilla, Dr. Serizawa died giving the alpha Titan the means to return and save the world from King Ghidorah. This effectively wrapped up his story, yet questions about him remain, especially since Godzilla vs. Kong introduced his son and made him an evil subordinate of Walter Simmons without explanation.


Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has an opportunity to properly tie up this loose end. In episode 3, Serizawa was namedropped by Verdugo, who asked Tim why the scientist wasn&#39;t contacted about the Randa situation. Verdugo&#39;s comment raised an interesting point - as their leading Titan expert, Dr. Serizawa is the most obvious person they should be turning to when dealing with monster threats. Since Dr. Serizawa doesn&#39;t die until 2019, he theoretically could appear for that purpose in a later season. If the dilemma concerning the Hollow Earth rifts isn&#39;t resolved by the end of season 1, Monarch may struggle to explain Serizawa&#39;s continued absence if he doesn&#39;t appear.


 1  Dr. Houston Brooks 
Played by Corey Hawkins in Kong: Skull Island and Joe Morton in Godzilla: King of the Monsters
        

In Kong: Skull Island, Corey Hawkins played Dr. Houston Brooks, the scientist who developed the Hollow Earth theory and accompanied Randa to Kong&#39;s home. Having lived through the movie, he returned as a much older man for a cameo appearance in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. As a result, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has two different ways it can use Houston Brooks. One would be to feature Joe Morton in the modern-day storyline, which could see the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters characters look to him for help. He was still associated with Monarch in 2019, so Brooks appearing in that capacity isn&#39;t hard to fathom.


Heading in this direction would give the characters a new connection to the legacy of their grandparents. They have one already in the form of Lee Shaw&#39;s Kurt Russell, but Houston Brooks could provide an additional perspective on them. What&#39;s more, he would be among the few people in the Monsterverse to have firsthand knowledge of Bill Randa&#39;s death. He could relate the events of Kong: Skull Island - including the circumstances of Randa&#39;s demise - to Cate and Kentaro, who would otherwise not be able to get the full picture of what happened to the grandfather. Even Lee Shaw can&#39;t know the whole story since he wasn&#39;t there.


Alternatively, the Apple TV&#43; show could use Corey Hawkins&#39; Houston Brooks by building off setup from episode 8. The 1956 storyline revealed that it was actually Bill Randa who created the framework for Brooks&#39; Hollow Earth theory. Since the Monsterverse is starting to explore Monarch&#39;s introduction to the Hollow Earth concept, Brooks&#39; role in it could be the next step in that journey. If the flashbacks continue beyond the 1950s in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 2, the series can show how Randa met Houston Brooks and the beginnings of their partnership.

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters releases new episodes on Fridays on Apple TV&#43;.
