## Literature Review
The Max Harry Potter TV show promised to be a more faithful adaptation of the Harry Potter books, but it should make some changes to the books.




Max&#39;s Harry Potter reboot is said to be a more faithful adaptation of the Harry Potter books, but there are some book scenes the remake should change. Max&#39;s reboot announcement was met with excitement given the possibility of a better adaptation, but also criticism from Harry Potter&#39;s longtime fans, since the announcement comes merely a decade after the last film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2, premiered. However, a new Harry Potter adaptation means that it has a chance to correct some of the stories that didn&#39;t work well in the books.
The Harry Potter movies and books are very beloved, but they&#39;re not perfect. The movies adapted the seven books into eight movies, and, although they were quite successful, many things didn&#39;t make it to the big screen. When it comes to J.K. Rowling&#39;s books, they are incredibly detailed, as the Wizarding World has been growing for over the last two decades, with numerous Harry Potter details throughout the movies, Tweets, websites, and other media. However, some of the stories are out of date, and the remake has a chance to change that.
            
 
 6 Harry Potter Book-To-Movie Changes The TV Remake Actually Needs To Keep 
Although the Harry Potter film franchise made many changes that fans didn’t like, there are a few differences that HBO’s TV show should keep.













 








 12  The Harry Potter Reboot Should Change Harry&#39;s Children&#39;s Names 
The children&#39;s names received a lot of criticism
        

At the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, there is a time jump leading to Harry and Ginny&#39;s children going to Hogwarts. There, it&#39;s revealed that the couple had three children: Albus Severus, James Sirius, and Lily Luna. Although there was a reason for his children&#39;s names, they were often criticized for being too childish and sounding exactly like a fan naming his children after finishing Harry Potter. The Max show could change this completely, giving them new, unique names, or keeping only one of the names for the children.





 11  The HBO Show Should Place Harry In The Present Day And Include Technology 
The events in the books took place in the 1990s
        

Although it makes sense for the films to take place in the 1990s, as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone premiered in 2001, the HBO show should place Harry in the present day. There&#39;s no reason for a show that will premiere in the 2020s to go back to the 1990s, especially since there aren&#39;t many time-specific details to the series. This way, it could appear more modern, can be more different than the films, and find its own traditions. Besides, it should also introduce technology into the mix, and show how Arthur Weasley gets so excited about smartphones and the internet.





 10  The Dursleys Shouldn&#39;t Abuse Harry In The Max Show 
His abuse doesn&#39;t add anything to the story
        

The Dursley family took Harry in as a baby, but they treated him horribly in the books and movies. The upcoming Max adaptation should fix that, especially since no other adult did anything about Harry&#39;s situation. Of course, there is no way for the Dursleys to treat Harry like their own child, because they were afraid of magic and everything they didn&#39;t consider normal, but they could be less horrible to him. They could always favor Dudley without abusing Harry and keeping him in a small closet. The fact that the Dursleys abused him didn&#39;t add anything to the story, and it should be dropped from the Max show.





 9  The Reboot Should Expand The Wizarding World More Than The Books Did 
It could take into account all the added details


 







The Harry Potter movies and books solely focused on Hogwarts and the UK, where the action takes place, but the Max show shouldn&#39;t have to follow the same path. The Fantastic Beasts spinoff franchise opened the door to new international locations, schools, and governments, and the Max series should take full advantage of that, and build on it. It should also present Durmstrang and Beauxbatons somehow and find a way to connect all of them into a bigger universe.





 8  The Max Reboot Should Have A Good Explanation Of The Time Turner 
The concept was underused
        

J.K. Rowling introduced the Time Turner in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but didn&#39;t really know where to go with it, and the Max show could come up with a better explanation for it. Hermione used it in the third book to be able to attend all her classes and she and Harry used it in the final moments to help Sirius and Buckbeack escape. However, the concept was completely underused in the books and dropped after Prisoner of Azkaban, and it might be a great opportunity for the upcoming show to make some changes and find a better use of it or get rid of the plot completely.





 7  The Harry Potter Reboot Should Show What Happened At Hogwarts In Deathly Hallows 
The magic of Hogwarts was the draw of the series
        

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was the pinnacle of the fight between Harry and Voldemort, sending Harry on a chase for the Horcruxes, which meant he didn&#39;t return to Hogwarts for his final year. While his storyline made sense, the books and movies followed Harry on his journey, and didn&#39;t show what happened at Hogwarts during that time. Since runtime isn&#39;t an issue given Max&#39;s 10-year plan for the Harry Potter remake, it could focus on the events at Hogwarts more, while also showing Harry&#39;s adventures. That way, the viewers can see what Snape is like as Headmaster, and how the Carrows took over and tortured the students.
Harry Potter was always about magic, and Hogwarts wasn&#39;t a big part of the last few films, especially Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Because of that, the Max series could differentiate itself from the movies and books and write its own stories at Hogwarts during Harry&#39;s Horcrux chase. Although it would be a dark time and less magical, it would keep viewers in the loop about what happened at Hogwarts.





 6  The Harry Potter Reboot Should Change The Way Overweight People Were Treated In The Books 
Being overweight was treated as a villainous trait
        

The Harry Potter TV show should make a change to how the series treats overweight people. The books and movies were condescending to overweight people at times. Dudley, Crabbe, and Goyle were all horrible people but were turned into hurtful stereotypes. Dudley&#39;s diet is mocked in the books, and he&#39;s often compared to a pig (and Hagrid even gives him a pig&#39;s tail). Draco&#39;s followers, Crabbe and Goyle, weren&#39;t that bright, they were often shown eating too much, which seemed to hint at their intelligence. The TV show should steer clear of these stories and find other ways to prove how evil they are, regardless of their weight.





 5  The Harry Potter TV Reboot Should Have LGBTQ&#43; Couples 
Just not one of the main ones
        

Making the show in the current setting is amazing because it gives the show a way to add more LGBTQ&#43; characters. In the original series, it was only hinted that Dumbledore was gay and that he had a relationship with Gellert Grindelwald, but there were no openly gay characters. The new series has an opportunity to right that wrong and create LGBTQ&#43; characters and couples. However, for it to work, it shouldn&#39;t put the main pairings like Hermione and Ron and Harry and Ginny in new relationships, but all the other characters have an opportunity for new romances.

From a lack of diversity to the constant fat-shaming, there are some things in this magical series that have not aged well...









 4  The Harry Potter Books Lack Representation And The Reboot Can Change That 
The show should be more culturally sensitive


 







The Harry Potter TV series could involve more people of color, as the books lack proper representation. It should also change some of the characters&#39; names, as Cho Chang and Kingsley Shacklebolt have received criticism for their lack of cultural sensitivity. This way, having a new Harry Potter adaptation could be more aware of the current setting and adapt it accordingly. The Harry Potter stage play, The Cursed Child, proved a black Hermione could work, and the show should include more representation.





 3  The Harry Potter Remake Should Present More Job Options 
There is a way to improve the series
        

The original movies didn&#39;t present many job options after graduating from Hogwarts, and the reboot should fix that. Based on some of the options in the books and the films, wizards graduating from Hogwarts could only work in the government, at the Gringotts bank, teach at Hogwarts, or become a Quidditch player. The Max show should present students with more job options, which could further improve the Wizarding World, and show all the options wizards have.





 2  Slytherin Shouldn&#39;t Be Pure Evil In HBO&#39;s Remake 
The reboot should reinvent the house


 







J.K. Rowling&#39;s books don&#39;t generally place the characters into black-and-white boxes, but she set Slytherin to be a pure evil house. The Slytherin house&#39;s traits are ambition, resourcefulness, determination, and cleverness, but all the students are described as villains. Sure, there were exceptions, like Severus Snape, Professor Horace Slughorn, and Regulus Black, but they were entirely older characters, and the majority of Slytherin turned to a dark path. It would be nice for the Max show to have some Slytherin students who prove they are determined, hardworking, and cunning, yet not evil or mean, and they could easily get along with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

 1  The Max Show Should Work Against The Stereotypes 
There are many hurtful stereotypes that the show could solve
        

Harry Potter has been a comfort series for many, but that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s perfect. The series includes many hurtful stereotypes and problematic plots that the reboot could avoid. There are many racial stereotypes hinted at in the books, including the goblins in the Harry Potter series which seem to be anti-semitic stereotypes, as well as house elves, and so many other storylines. Because of that, the upcoming Harry Potter TV show has the opportunity to fix those stereotypes and change them into better plots.
