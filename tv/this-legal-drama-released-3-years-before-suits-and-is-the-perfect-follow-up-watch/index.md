# This Legal Drama Released 3 Years Before Suits - And Is The Perfect Follow-Up Watch


## SUMMARY 



  Suits, a show about New York lawyers, has gained significant popularity on Netflix despite originally having only middling success during its original broadcast.   The show&#39;s premise revolves around Harvey hiring an associate named Mike, despite not having any legal education, leading to a dynamic partnership and an engaging legal drama with added office politics.   For those who are finally able to finish all 9 seasons of Suits, the next best follow-up binge-watch for them would be another USA Network series — White Collar.

## Literature Review
After bingeing the legal drama Suits on Netflix, there&#39;s another USA Network series that exudes the same vibe, making it the perfect follow-up watch. 




The perfect Suits follow-up show is a 14-year-old show that was also on USA Network. Created by Aaron Korsh, Suits ran from 2011 to 2019 for a total of 9 seasons, and follows the New York lawyers at Pearson Hardman (and its subsequent iterations) as they deal with various challenges. Led by Harvey Specter, the best closer in the city, the corporate law firm deals with high-profile and expensive cases. However, the office drama in the show makes it so much more entertaining to watch. During its original broadcast, it only enjoyed middling success. However, since it arrived on Netflix, Suits has been dominating streaming.




Suits&#39; premise is fairly simple but very intriguing. Harvey&#39;s hesitation to hire an associate changes when he meets Mike Ross, who happens to be running from the police while trying to deliver pot. Despite not going to any law school, Mike&#39;s deep knowledge of the legal system and eidetic memory, not to mention swagger, impresses Harvey, motivating him to hire a fraud. This starts their tremendous team-up, making a formidable team for Pearson Hardman. Aside from winning cases, Harvey and Mike also fight hard to ensure that their secret remains that way, which adds a layer to the legal drama&#39;s storytelling.

  


 White Collar Is The Perfect Show To Watch After Suits

 Suits arrived on Netflix on June 17, which means that at this point, it&#39;s likely that those who started watching it around that time have already finished it. While rewatching is definitely an option, especially considering its entertainment value, some may be looking for their next binge-watch that has a similar vibe and tone as the banter-filled legal drama. Luckily, USA Network has another series that fits that bill: White Collar. Created by Jeff Eastin, the series premiered in 2009 and ran for six seasons until 2014. White Collar stars Tim DeKay as FBI Special Agent Peter Burke and Matt Bomer as con-man, Neal Caffrey as a duo.

  3:55                       The New Suits Show: Everything We Know About The Spinoff   Aaron Korsh and NBCUniversal are working on a new Suits show, but the details around the first Suits TV series since 2019&#39;s Pearson are mysterious.    

While White Collar isn&#39;t a legal drama like Suits, it has the same overall appeal. It starts with an odd partnership between Peter and Neal. As a convicted con-man, Neal proposes a deal with Peter wherein he would be allowed out of prison in exchange for his service to help the FBI&#39;s White Collar division catch his fellow criminals. Like Mike and Harvey, Peter and Neal make a formidable team, but their relationship transcends its professional nature, eventually becoming great friends. Beyond its main duo, White Collar&#39;s appeal is bolstered by its stellar ensemble cast, which makes it more similar to Suits.






Suits is available to stream on Netflix and Peacock, while White Collar is streaming on Hulu.






 Suits vs. White Collar: Which USA Network Show Is Better 
White Collar Is A Simpler, Stronger Show
          

Although White Collar debuted earlier than Suits on USA Network, it ran concurrently with the legal drama for four years until it ended in 2014. This is primarily the reason that they couldn&#39;t inhabit the same storytelling space, as the cable station wanted to offer their viewers variety in their programming. Despite having different genres, it isn&#39;t difficult to compare them to each other. Aside from hinging on a central unorthodox team-up and featuring a brilliant supporting cast, they also share other storytelling elements. For example, both shows are set in New York City. They also have great romance sub-stories, and a procedural type of storytelling.

Overall, however, White Collar may even be better than Suits. Despite the fun banter between Mike and Harvey, some of its cases run a bit too complicated, which bogs it down. White Collar, on the other hand, consistently comes up with interesting and unique cases — most of them are fairly easy to follow. Even Neal and Peter&#39;s individual and collective arcs are stronger. Multiple times in the series, both prove that they are willing to sacrifice themselves to save the other. Finally, while there are arguments that Suits should have ended in season 7 when Mike and Rachel left, White Collar ends with a solid finale.






 Will Suits Season 10 Ever Happen? 
A Revival Isn&#39;t Likely, But A Spin-Off Is On The Way
          

Suits&#39; resurgence on Netflix has started conversations about the show potentially returning, either for season 10 or a spin-off. Producer Gene Klein has confirmed that there were ideas for a few offshoots, but they never materialized. Subsequently, Korsh has squashed hopes about a Suits season 10, saying that it will be difficult to recruit the complete cast for the proposed endeavor. This doesn&#39;t mean, however, that it will never happen, especially since there are ways to explain Rachel&#39;s absence if Meghan Markle decides not to participate. Among the viable ideas include a reunion among Harvey, Mike, and Louis as they help Jessica in Chicago. 

                  Suits Revival: Will It Happen? Everything We Know   Despite ending in 2019 the demand for a Suits revival has never been higher - here&#39;s everything we know about the chances of Suits season 10.    




 However, what has been confirmed is a Suits spin-off. Not much is yet known about the project, which is still in early development, but it is confirmed to be a new show set in the Suits universe rather than a reboot or revival. Aaron Korsh and NBCUniversal are working on the project, which is not the first spin-off from this world. In 2019, a spin-off titled Pearson (following attorney Jessica Pearson as she entered the political arena) aired, but was canceled after a single season. The new spin-off will be attempting to replicate the original&#39;s success, and avoid the pitfalls that led to Pearson&#39;s cancelation. 

             Suits Suits follows Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), who, despite never attending law school, is able to use his photographic memory to become a lawyer. The legal drama ran from 2011 to 2019 for a total of nine seasons and also starred Gabriel Macht, Meghan Markle, Sarah Rafferty, and Rick Hoffman.  Release Date   June 23, 2011    Cast   Patrick J. Adams , Sarah Rafferty , Gabriel Macht , Meghan Markle , Rick Hoffman , Gina Torres , Amanda Schull , Dule Hill , Katherine Heigl    Seasons   9
