## Literature Review

Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley explains how Witt&#39;s shocking final act in the season 5 finale ties back to the overall themes of the show.




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for Fargo season 5 finale!






Fargo season 5&#39;s ending is as shocking as it is tragic, and the showrunner has opened up about why that had to be the case. Based on the 1996 movie, the show takes place in a different setting every season, though always focusing on the Midwest. It has starred various high-profile actors, including Martin Freeman, Kirsten Dunst, Ewan McGregor, and Patrick Wilson, but each finale refreshes the cast completely.

While Fargo always says farewell to its cast and characters, the season 5 finale made it a bloody ending. The lovable Witt Farr (Lamorne Morris) is tragically killed at the Tillman ranch before Roy&#39;s murder spree can finally be stopped. In an interview with Collider, showrunner Noah Hawley explained that he did not initially plan to kill Witt in the season finale. He only decided to go through with the killing after seeing the actors on set and weighing his options. Check out his quote below:
