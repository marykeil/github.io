# Echo Season 2 Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel Studios has not confirmed a second season of Echo, and it may be a miniseries spinoff with no plans for continuation.   The mixed reviews of Echo may further discourage the creation of a season 2.   If there is a season 2, it could explore the relationship between Maya Lopez and Matt Murdock, as well as delve into Wilson Fisk&#39;s backstory and his connection to Maya.

## Literature Review
Following the release of Marvel Studios&#39; Echo series on January 9, 2024, news on a potential season 2 in the MCU&#39;s future has been scarce.




Not much is yet known about a potential Echo season 2 being developed at Marvel Studios. Releasing as part of Phase 5 of the MCU, Marvel Studios&#39; Echo breaks several trends for the franchise, being the first project to release under the Marvel Spotlight banner, the first TV-MA project in the MCU, and the first of Marvel Studios&#39; Disney&#43; series&#39; to drop every episode simultaneously, as the show released all its episodes on January 9, 2024. The MCU&#39;s new Marvel Spotlight banner focuses on more grounded, character-driven storylines that don&#39;t tie directly into the wider continuity of the franchise, but Echo already has links to several other projects, meaning there is clear potential for a second season.




Following her debut in Phase 4&#39;s Hawkeye, Alaqua Cox reprises her role of Maya Lopez, a.k.a. Echo, in her self-titled Disney&#43; spinoff. Echo expands on Maya Lopez&#39;s backstory in the MCU timeline, as she heads back to her hometown in Oklahoma to escape Wilson Fisk&#39;s pursuit, with Vincent D&#39;Onofrio returning as Kingpin from Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil series and the MCU&#39;s Hawkeye. Maya Lopez investigates her Indigenous roots in Echo, and learns to embrace her family, her past and her community. The series marks the return of Charlie Cox&#39;s Matt Murdock, a.k.a. Daredevil, but also introduces a slew of new characters to the franchise, developing Maya Lopez&#39;s story as Echo brilliantly.

Filming for Echo wrapped in August 2022 ahead of its January 2024 release, though the series was subject to a series of delays. Echo&#39;s first five episodes premiered at 9pm ET/6pm PT on January 9, but there hasn&#39;t yet been any word of a potential Echo season 2 so far. In fact, Echo has always been billed as a miniseries spinoff from Hawkeye, focusing on developing Alaqua Cox&#39;s newcomer Maya Lopez by placing her as the main character of her own series, meaning there may not be a second season in the works. Echo also serves the greater purpose of developing the relationship between Kingpin and Daredevil ahead of Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming Daredevil: Born Again, so the story may not have been constructed with a further chapter in mind.



 Echo Season 2 Has Not Been Confirmed By Marvel 
          

Due to the miniseries format of Echo, Marvel Studios hasn&#39;t provided any comment on whether the series will continue in a potential season 2 - and Echo&#39;s mixed reviews may mean the studio avoids creating a follow-up. That said, a recent overhaul of Marvel Studios television production techniques has led to speculation that more shows will get second seasons, rather than only Loki and What If...?, but Echo hasn&#39;t been confirmed to be one of these shows. Nevertheless, Echo appears to lead directly into the events of Daredevil: Born Again, so it&#39;s possible that Maya Lopez&#39;s story will continue in the highly-anticipated series, though Alaqua Cox hasn&#39;t been confirmed to be appearing in Born Again, so her MCU future is yet to be revealed.






 Echo Season 2 Cast: Who Could Return? 
          

 Echo Season 1 Actor Name  Role In Echo   Tantoo Cardinal  Chula   Katarina Ziervogel  Taloa   Cody Lightning  Biscuits   Chaske Spencer  Henry   Graham Greene  Skully   Andrew Howard  Zane   Morningstar Angeline  Lowak   Dannie McCallum  Tuklo   



If Marvel Studios does put Echo season 2 into development, it&#39;s possible that much of the first season&#39;s cast will reprise their roles. Most prominently, Alaqua Cox will surely return as Maya Lopez, though it&#39;s unclear where her story could develop between now and a potential season 2. It&#39;s also very likely that Charlie Cox and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio would return as Matt Murdock&#39;s Daredevil and Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin, respectively, especially since Echo and Daredevil share a close bond in Marvel Comics, so this can be explored further in the MCU&#39;s future. Zahn McClarnon would also likely return as William Lopez, Maya&#39;s deceased father, following his debut in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye.




Several new MCU characters are introduced in Echo that could also potentially return for a potential season 2. Among them, Chaske Spencer&#39;s Henry &#34;Black Crow&#34; Lopez, Maya&#39;s uncle, Tantoo Cardinal&#39;s Chula, Maya&#39;s grandmother, Devery Jacobs&#39; Bonnie and Cody Lightning&#39;s Biscuits, Maya&#39;s cousins, and Graham Greene&#39;s Skully, a grandfather-figure to Maya. Should Echo season 2 be put into development, it would likely release after the events of Daredevil: Born Again, meaning characters from that upcoming series could also return in Echo. This could include Sandrine Holt&#39;s Vanessa Fisk, Kingpin&#39;s wife, who was previously portrayed by Ayelet Zurer in Daredevil, and Jon Bernthal&#39;s Frank Castle, a.k.a. the Punisher.



 Echo Season 2 Story: What It Could Be About 
         




While Phase 5&#39;s Echo explores Maya Lopez&#39;s backstory, and sees her gain superhuman abilities of her own, meaning a potential Echo season 2 would perhaps focus on a broader story for the MCU&#39;s villain-turned-antihero. Echo season 2 could develop the romantic relationship between Maya Lopez and Matt Murdock, and could expand on Wilson Fisk&#39;s own backstory and current marriage to Vanessa, and how this affects his connection to Maya. Kingpin has been billed as the Thanos of the MCU&#39;s street-level stories, so even if Echo season 2 isn&#39;t put into production, it&#39;s likely that Maya Lopez will be appearing in several upcoming projects alongside her surrogate uncle.
