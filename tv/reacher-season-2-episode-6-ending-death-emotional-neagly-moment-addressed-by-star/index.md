Summary

  Reacher star Maria Sten says Neagly&#39;s emotional connection with Russo as he dies reflects her own sense of safety and need for connection.   Neagly&#39;s backstory explains her reluctance to let people close and her need to protect Marlo&#39;s daughter.   The sacrifice made by Detective Russo highlights Neagly&#39;s desire to keep others safe and her willingness to give whatever he needs.  







Reacher star Maria Sten has opened up about season 2, episode 6&#39;s death scene and the emotional impact it had on Neagly. The end of the episode sees Neagly (Sten) in a race against time to save the NYPD&#39;s Detective Russo (Domenick Lombardozzi) as he&#39;s cornered by New Age gunners. The detective sacrifices himself to save Marlo&#39;s daughter, comforted by Neagly as he dies.

Speaking with TVLine, Sten revealed what Reacher season 2, episode 6&#39;s ending means for Neagly, who held hands with Russo as he died despite her fear of being touched. The actor examined the importance of the scene and how it reflects the character&#39;s own sense of safety in the show. Check out what Sten had to say below:


It’s a moment where she knows this person is going to leave this Earth. And he needs that in this moment, he needs connection.
I, for myself, did some backstory about Neagley and what she stands for, and why she is the way she is. I think of her as being sort of lost as a child, growing up very quickly. And she sees Russo as this person who also wants to do anything to keep this kid [Marlo’s daughter] safe. When she sees this man give up his life to save this child, there’s a moment where she feels the need to give whatever he needs, in this moment of closeness. Also, I think Neagley doesn’t every truly feel safe, which is why she doesn’t let people close. So, in this moment she feels safe because she sees Russo in a real, vulnerable way.






 What Russo&#39;s Death Means For The Rest Of Reacher Season 2 
          

Russo was first introduced as a hot-headed detective, forming a transactional relationship with Reacher&#39;s team, so he could get more information about New Age&#39;s crimes. Over time, though, it was revealed he is protective of families and kids, earning respect from the show&#39;s main character. His death reveals how close season 2 is to its end, no doubt having ramifications throughout the final two episodes.

Reacher has yet to learn about Russo&#39;s death, having ended episode 6 shooting at a helicopter that successfully rescued Langston. While his demise will mark a low point for the show&#39;s hero, it will likely also motivate him to move against New Age in an explosive way. If he does, it could prove a Reacher season 2 theory that one of his own teammates is dirty, leading to even more action and drama in the finale.




                  How Many Episodes Reacher Season 2 Has Left &amp; When The Finale Is   Alan Ritchson returns as Jack Reacher in the hit Amazon Prime Video series. Here&#39;s how many episodes Reacher season 2 has left before the finale.    

Given the number of people that have died in season 2, it&#39;s possible Russo&#39;s demise won&#39;t be the last one Reacher displays before the season finale. Instead of a teammate turning against him, the titular character may lose someone else close to him in the final battle with New Age. As the show builds to its climax, the body count remains unclear and could be very high depending on the team&#39;s next move.



New episodes of Reacher arrive on Prime Video Thursdays at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.
