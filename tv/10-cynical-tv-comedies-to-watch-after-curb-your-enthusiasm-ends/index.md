## Literature Review

Curb Your Enthusiasm is heading into its final season, but there are plenty of other cynical TV comedies to fill the Curb void after it ends.




Curb Your Enthusiasm is heading into its final season, but there are plenty of other cynical TV comedies to fill the Curb void after Larry David’s groundbreaking series ends. The 12th season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is set to premiere on HBO on February 4. David has always made each season of Curb Your Enthusiasm as though it would be the last – the season 5 finale is literally called “The End” – but this is the first time that HBO has officially marketed a season of Curb as the final season, so it’s likely that this one really is the last.
It’ll be a bittersweet moment to bid farewell to TV’s greatest curmudgeon, but there are plenty of other TV comedies that have a similar cynical sense of humor and a similar curmudgeonly protagonist. There’s a lot of dark humor to be mined from stories about terrible people who refuse to follow society’s unwritten rules. From other shows set in the cutthroat world of show business to David’s own previous work, there are a ton of classic TV comedies to fill Curb’s shoes after it ends.
            
 
 10 Missing Curb Your Enthusiasm Characters Who Need To Return In Season 12 Before The Show Officially Ends 
Curb Your Enthusiasm is set to end with season 12, and there are a few forgotten characters who need to return before Larry David concludes the show.












 








 10  Party Down 
Stream on Starz
        

A bunch of out-of-work actors reluctantly work as caterers for the Hollywood elites they hope to one day join in Party Down. Curb Your Enthusiasm satirizes the phony friendliness of star-studded Hollywood parties from the perspective of a guest who feels like an outsider; Party Down satirizes those parties from the perspective of the caterers, who are quite literally outsiders. Party Down follows a familiar formula – each episode revolves around a different event catered by Party Down – but each episode finds a new and exciting way to upend the event.





 9  BoJack Horseman 
Stream on Netflix
        

The title character of BoJack Horseman might be a talking horse, but he has a lot in common with Larry David: they’re both coasting on former sitcom fame, they’re both disillusioned with showbiz, and they’re both miserable despite living lives of luxury. BoJack Horseman has the biting showbiz satire and infectious cantankerousness of Curb, but it also tugs on the audience’s heartstrings. There are as many devastating dramatic moments as there are lighthearted comedic moments.





 8  Veep 
Stream on Max
        

If Larry held the second-highest-ranking political office in the United States, then it might look something like Selina Meyer in Veep. From the mind of renowned satirist Armando Iannucci, Veep is a reimagining of The Thick of It set in the troubled world of U.S. politics. Veep shares all the hallmarks of Curb Your Enthusiasm: pitch-black humor, a colorful cast of supporting characters, razor-sharp ironic plotting, and a legend from Seinfeld in the lead role (in this case, Julia Louis-Dreyfus).





 7  Black Books 
Stream on The Roku Channel
        

Bernard Black, the proprietor of the titular bookshop in Black Books, is so miserable and pessimistic that it might be too much even for Larry David. The show wrings plenty of laughs out of the irony of a misanthrope running a business; Bernard despises people, but he relies on them coming into his shop and talking to him in order to earn his living. The refreshing cynicism of Curb Your Enthusiasm is draped over every single episode of Black Books.





 6  It&#39;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia 
Stream on Hulu


 







Giving the Seinfeld formula a delightfully cartoonish makeover, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia revolves around five of the worst people on Earth running an unsuccessful Irish bar in Philly. The early seasons of It’s Always Sunny demonstrate a strong influence from Curb with a lot of awkward situations and improvised dialogue. In the later seasons, it goes off in its own direction and becomes something entirely unique (and one of the funniest shows on TV).





 5  Loudermilk 
Stream on Netflix
        

The eponymous character in Loudermilk – a former music critic reluctantly running a support group for recovering alcoholics – deals with the misery of sobriety by protesting the unwritten rules of society in very Larry David-like fashion. Unlike Larry, Sam Loudermilk actually wants to be a better person, but he rarely succeeds. Loudermilk has all the cranky “old man yells at cloud” rants of Curb Your Enthusiasm on top of a heartfelt exploration of the struggle to overcome addiction.





 4  The Curse 
Stream on Paramount&#43; with Showtime


 







The Curse’s central duo of Asher and Whitney Siegel are an interminable virtue-signaling couple gentrifying the city of Española for their HGTV reality series, whether the locals want it or not – and matters only get worse when Asher is “cursed” by a little girl. The perfect intersection of Benny Safdie’s anxiety-inducing thrillers and Nathan Fielder’s cringe comedy, The Curse is one of the most uncomfortable (and engrossing) TV shows in recent memory. This series is darkly hilarious, deeply unsettling, and wildly unpredictable.





 3  Fleabag 
Stream on Prime Video
        

Phoebe Waller-Bridge adapted Fleabag from her own one-woman show about a free-spirited but rageful young woman living in London. The title character in Fleabag is every bit as cynical and misanthropic as Larry David, but she also has the ability to break the fourth wall, allowing her to confide in the audience and complain about people behind their backs when they’re standing right next to her. Since it only ran for two seasons comprising of 12 episodes, Fleabag is a rare perfect TV show that doesn’t have a single weak episode.





 2  Arrested Development 
Stream on Netflix
        

Whereas Curb Your Enthusiasm is a show about a bad person surrounded by good people, Arrested Development is a show about a good person surrounded by bad people. The endlessly quotable Michael Bluth is the only member of his family with any semblance of a moral compass, so the burden of keeping their company afloat and avoiding criminal charges falls on him. Arrested Development is one of the most well-written TV comedies ever made; every one of its dozen major characters always has something going on, and the dialogue is wall-to-wall jokes.





 1  Seinfeld 
Stream on Netflix


 







Before creating Curb Your Enthusiasm, David brought his witty takedown of the minutiae of daily life to the multi-camera format in Seinfeld. Seinfeld plays like a Curb prototype; there’s even a character based on David himself, George Costanza, who gets himself into similar situations to the fictionalized David in Curb. Whereas multi-cam shows like Friends and How I Met Your Mother are full of sappy emotional moments, Seinfeld upended that well-worn tradition with a strict “no hugging, no learning” policy.
