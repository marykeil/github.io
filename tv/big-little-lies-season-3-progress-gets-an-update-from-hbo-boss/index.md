## Literature Review

Big Little Lies season 3 receives an update from HBO&#39;s Casey Bloys following confirmation of Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon’s involvement. 





Big Little Lies season 3 gets a new update from HBO and Max&#39;s content chairman and CEO Casey Bloys. Following the season 2 finale in 2019, there was no confirmation of a continuation until producers and actors Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon recently shared that they are working on developing season 3 of the hit series. While season 1 was adapted from the Big Little Lies novel by Liane Moriarty, season 2 continued the story beyond the original source material, with season 3 needing to follow this course as well.




When discussing Big Little Lies season 3 with Variety, Bloys shared that he had been told &#34;a little about the idea. I think it could be great.&#34; This includes Kidman and Witherspoon consulting with Moriarty to build on the established storylines and characters from the previous seasons. Bloys expects that showrunner David E. Kelley will return as well, although it is still early in the development process. Read the rest of Bloys&#39; update below:


Where you have all these stars, you’ve got to get their schedules in line, we have to get it written. So, there’s a lot that needs to be done. It’s very early stages right now. The entire cast is doing shows and movies, and everybody’s very busy. But it’s a very special group. They love working together. And when they land on an idea, I believe they will make it happen. We’re excited when they’re ready, and we will take those steps when they’re ready.



 Does Big Little Lies Need A Season 3? 
          




Big Little Lies season 2 was a natural continuation from season 1, as the Monterey Five dealt with the fallout from Perry Wright&#39;s death, and the consequences that stemmed from it. Season 2 felt less open to a continuation, as the Monterey Five went to the police station and presumably turned themselves in, choosing to confront their choices instead of continuing to run from them. It is a powerful final scene that works as an effective way to culminate the development of the characters as individuals and as a group. A season 3 could potentially undermine season 2&#39;s ending.

Based on Bloys&#39; comments, it seems that season 3 is more inspired by the cast and crew wanting to work together again, as opposed to having a specific story or continuation in mind. Seeing Kidman, Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, Zoë Kravitz, and the rest of the Big Little Lies cast reuniting and working together again is an enticing promise, but needs the foundation of a compelling story. Season 1 had the benefit of adapting the novel and season 2 was partly based on an unpublished novella written by Moriarty.






Liane Moriarty is also known for the novel Nine Perfect Strangers, which was adapted into a Hulu series starring Big Little Lies&#39; Nicole Kidman.




While Big Little Lies season 1 was met with critical acclaim, season 2 was more divisive because the story wasn&#39;t as strong. Season 3 runs the same risk, especially if there is no source material. There are intriguing possibilities, including an exploration of the Monterey Five&#39;s time in jail, or Woodley&#39;s suggestion of following the younger generation of characters. Big Little Lies arguably does not need a season 3, but once the talent behind and in front of the camera find a way to properly continue the story, the next installment may prove that it was worth the wait.
