## Literature Review
Disney&#43; cancels the original series American Born Chinese after just one season, despite the show receiving massively positive critical reviews.




Disney&#43; cancels American Born Chinese after just one season. Starring Ben Wang, Ke Huy Quan, and Michelle Yeoh, the Disney series follows teenager Jin Wang who finds himself in a battle with Chinese mythical gods after meeting a foreign exchange student at his high school. The series is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Gene Luen Yang and received rave reviews for its exploration of Chinese mythology, cast performances, and action sequences. After season 1 ended in May of last year, Disney finally decided whether American Born Chinese would continue with season 2. 




According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney&#43; has cancelled American Born Chinese after just one season. While Disney&#43; does not release viewership data, the speculation is that the show failed to become a hit with viewers even though Disney made efforts to promote it on multiple platforms in addition to Disney&#43; (Hulu, Roku, YouTube, and ABC). The show will now be available for producers to shop.


 Will American Born Chinese Be Picked Up By Another Network/Streamer? 
          

The cancellation of American Born Chinese comes as a surprise for many reasons. First, the response from both critics and audiences has been overwhelmingly positive, with its 94% Rotten Tomatoes score matched by an equally impressive 82% audience score. For a showâ€™s debut season, the positive response would generally be indicative of hope for a season 2 renewal. 




Secondly, American Born Chinese had an incredible cast, who should have, in theory, led the show to success. Both Quan and Yeoh acted in the series after their recent Oscar wins for Everything, Everywhere, All At Once. Producer and director Destin Daniel Cretton, who is known for his work on hits such as Short Term 12 and blockbuster film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, was also involved in the project. Given the star power behind this project both on screen and behind the scenes, American Born Chinese may still have hope if the producers can save the show by finding a new streamer or network. 

                  American Born Chinese&#39;s 10 Biggest Changes From The Graphic Novel   Gene Luen Yang&#39;s 2006 graphic novel inspired the Disney Plus series American Born Chinese, but the show still made many pivotal changes to the story.    

American Born Chinese ended with more questions about Jin&#39;s status as the Fourth Scroll. His parents were also abducted by Princess Iron Fan (Poppy Liu), although her reasons for doing so are unclear. Had the show been renewed for season 2, it would have explored more of the Chinese mythology, the protagonist&#39;s Chinese heritage, and the adversary&#39;s motives. So, while the American Born Chinese cancellation may be disappointing for now, there is hope for the series to find a new home and continue the story it left off.
