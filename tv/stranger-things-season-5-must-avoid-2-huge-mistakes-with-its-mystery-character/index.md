# Stranger Things Season 5 Must Avoid 2 Huge Mistakes With Its Mystery Character


## SUMMARY 



  Stranger Things should avoid bringing back deceased characters in season 5, as it would undermine the significance of their sacrifices.   Introducing new characters in the final season would complicate the story and take away from important moments with the established cast.   The mystery character should be a returning player who enhances the narrative and doesn&#39;t distract from the main storyline.

## Literature Review
There’s been a lot of speculation about Stranger Things season 5’s mystery character, but the show must avoid two major mistakes with whomever it is.




There&#39;s been a lot of speculation about Stranger Things season 5&#39;s mystery character, but the Netflix series should avoid making two major mistakes with whomever it&#39;s bringing in. Stranger Things season 5 will bring Netflix&#39;s hit series to a close at long last, but not much is known about the coming episodes. A call sheet shared by Stranger Things co-creator Ross Duffer revealed that a mystery character will make an appearance in the final season&#39;s premiere, as their name is intentionally crossed off in the social media post.




Naturally, there&#39;s been plenty of discussion about the crossed-off character, with Stranger Things fans&#39; predictions ranging from Eddie Munson to Vecna. Whoever it is, it&#39;s clear the Duffer Brothers don&#39;t want fans to know they&#39;ll be making an appearance in the season 5 premiere. And while there&#39;s no shortage of characters it&#39;d be exciting to see again, the series should avoid two mistakes when it comes to this mystery person.

                  Stranger Things Season 5: Renewal, Cast, Story Conclusion &amp; Everything We Know   Stranger Things season 5 will bring the epic Netflix sci-fi horror saga to a conclusion, and here&#39;s everything we know about Eleven&#39;s return.    


 Stranger Things Season 5 Shouldn&#39;t Revive The Dead With Its Mystery Character 
Doing So Would Undermine Certain Characters&#39; Sacrifices
         

Although Stranger Things fans would be excited to see fan-favorite characters like Eddie Munson and Barb again, season 5 should avoid bringing these players back from the grave. The final outing should stay away from raising the dead in general, as deceased characters&#39; sacrifices would be less meaningful if they were to return. The only way a comeback would make sense is to have the characters appear in dream sequences or flashbacks — or to turn them into monsters from the Upside Down. The latter outcome is almost too devastating to imagine, and it might take away from the bigger stakes of season 5.




While Stranger Things has sparked controversy with some of its character deaths — Barb&#39;s spawned an entire social media movement, and Chrissy&#39;s has been criticized for happening too quickly — the show has done a stand-up job of sticking to its guns when it comes to the finality of such developments. If the mystery character is someone who died during a previous season of Stranger Things, the show risks undoing one of its strengths. As such, it&#39;d be better if the mystery character wasn&#39;t someone who died.



 Stranger Things&#39; Final Season Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Bring In Newcomers 
Season 5 Already Has Enough Storylines To Wrap Up
          

If Stranger Things season 5&#39;s mystery character isn&#39;t someone returned from the dead, it could be a newcomer. However, this would also be a huge mistake. Stranger Things often introduces new characters at the beginning of a season, and many of them undergo an entire character arc in a single outing. Unfortunately, there&#39;s not much time for that in Stranger Things&#39; final outing. There are too many loose ends to tie up regarding Eleven, Vecna, and the Upside Down. Adding more characters would just complicate things further and take screen time away from Stranger Things&#39; already-large cast.




There are so many questions Stranger Things season 5 needs to answer, storylines it must wrap up, and characters it has to bid farewell to. New faces and subplots will only serve as distractions from all the important moments viewers have been waiting for. The Netflix series will deliver a stronger ending if it sticks to the storylines and characters it&#39;s already established over the past four seasons. For that reason, the mystery character should be someone viewers already know who isn&#39;t dead in season 5&#39;s timeline.



 The Mystery Character Should Be A Returning Player 
Vecna Or Max Would Make Sense
          

The name on Stranger Things season 5&#39;s call sheet could very well belong to a character who&#39;s alive and established ahead of the final season. There are a few players missing from the list, and the Duffer Brothers would have reasons for keeping all of them under wraps. Vecna isn&#39;t on the call sheet, but the villain could make an appearance in the premiere — something the creators may not want to give away. Max is also not on the sheet, and it&#39;s possible she&#39;ll wake up from her coma or appear in another form in the premiere. Keeping this off social media would allow it to be a pleasant surprise.




Needless to say, Stranger Things doesn&#39;t need to over-complicate its story or eliminate its stakes with its mystery character. With any luck, the crossed-off name will belong to someone who makes sense for the final season&#39;s narrative and doesn&#39;t draw attention away from the main cast. Stranger Things needs to stay focused in season 5, and a returning player won&#39;t prevent it from doing so.



Stranger Things seasons 1-4 are streaming on Netflix.
