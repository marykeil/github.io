## Literature Review

Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss reveal one thing they&#39;d change about the show, and it&#39;s not the controversial final season.




Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss reveal the one thing they would have done differently, and it&#39;s unrelated to the final season. Based on the fantasy books by George R.R. Martin, Benioff and Weiss co-created the massively popular adaption for HBO and acted as the showrunners for all eight seasons. In 2019, Game of Thrones came to a controversial conclusion, with viewers complaining that character arcs were ruined or wrapped up too hastily, with much of the online vitriol directed at Weiss and Benioff&#39;s writing.




During a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Benioff and Weiss revealed one thing they would change about the show, and it has nothing to do with the controversial Game of Thrones ending. The showrunners wish they would have brought back Mord the Jailer from season 1, even sharing an idea for an additional scene. Read their full comments below:


Benioff: One thing I know I wish we could have done is there’s the character Mord the Jailer...
Weiss: It was a mistake not bringing Mord the Jailer back into it. We always talked about doing it.
Benioff: And we had the scene for it. There’s a scene set in a tavern…
Weiss: Was it Brienne or The Hound? But we realized too late that Mord could have owned the tavern. We could have had that actor in the background acting exactly the way he did as a jailer, except now as a small business owner. It was just such an obvious, no-brainer, day-after idea.





                  Game Of Thrones Cast - Where Are They Now?   The Game of Thrones cast was one of the best ensembles in TV history, with many actors continuing to deliver impressive performances after its ending.   


 Who Was Mord In Game Of Thrones? 
          

 In Game of Thrones season 1, Mord the Jailer was the turnkey at the Eyrie in charge of the Sky Cells who tormented Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage). Played by Ciaran Bermingham, Mord is depicted as a cruel, slow-witted man who obediently follows the orders of &#34;betters&#34; in service of House Arryn. After being beaten by his club, Tyrion bargains with Mord, promising him gold in exchange for helping him escape the Eyrie. As Tyrion leaves, true to his word, he tosses a gold-filled purse to Mord, reciting his house&#39;s words, &#34;A Lannister always pays his debts.&#34;




Mord was a minor character in season 1, whose purpose was mostly comic relief. Though he was never seen again, the showrunners&#39; unrealized idea was to bring him back as the owner of a tavern, answering the question of what he did with his newfound wealth. It&#39;s certainly curious that, among all the controversial choices in Game of Thrones season 8, Mord is the only thing the creators would change. However, it shouldn&#39;t be that surprising, since the showrunners staunchly avoid criticizing the series since they believe it wouldn&#39;t benefit themselves or anyone who worked on Game of Thrones.



Game of Thrones seasons 1-8 are streaming on Max.
