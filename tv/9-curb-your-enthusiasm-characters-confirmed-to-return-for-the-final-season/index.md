## Literature Review
Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12&#39;s trailer confirms that several familiar faces will return to join Larry David in the HBO comedy&#39;s final season.




HBO’s Curb Your Enthusiasm is set to premiere its twelfth and final season on February 4, with the first trailer confirming the returns of several beloved characters alongside Larry David. Following a fictionalized version of Seinfeld creator Larry David playing himself, Curb Your Enthusiasm began as a 1999 mockumentary special that evolved into 12 seasons of Larry causing rivalries and mayhem with various celebrities, Hollywood figures, and individuals he comes into contact with each day. Though his relationships have evolved over the past 25 years, the characters who have most frequently been involved in Larry’s major conflicts include Jeff, Susie, Leon, and Cheryl.
With Curb Your Enthusiasm finally coming to an end, there are plenty of other characters who have appeared on the show that are hoped to make a return. Thankfully, the first trailer for the last season confirms that several beloved figures will be making an appearance, including a few unexpected characters. As Curb Your Enthusiasm’s decades-long storylines finally wrap up, some of Larry David’s greatest rivals, friends, and romantic interests are already revealed to be back in season 12.



 9  Leon Black (J.B. Smoove) 
First appeared in season 6, episode 2



J.B. Smoove is confirmed to reprise his role as Leon Black in Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12&#39;s story, and will hopefully have a prominent presence in the final few outings. Though Leon didn’t join Curb Your Enthusiasm until season 6, when his family came to stay with Larry after they lost their home in a hurricane (Leon himself was already living around Los Angeles), he has become one of the show’s most iconic and beloved staples. Even after his family members left, Leon continued living with Larry as the two became reluctant roommates and best friends. In Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12, Leon will still be a frequent accomplice in Larry’s many misunderstandings and disregard of social conventions.





 8  Jeff Greene (Jeff Garlin) 
First appeared in pilot
        

Larry’s manager and best friend, Jeff Greene, is also back for Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12. Having been by Larry’s side since the 1999 mockumentary, Jeff will be returning as he keeps encouraging Larry’s rejection of social expectations and coordinates his meetings with other Hollywood figures. Jeff’s return was previously questioned by audiences after actor Jeff Garlin’s controversial exit from The Goldbergs in 2021, but Curb Your Enthusiasm’s season 12 trailer confirms the actor and character will be back for the HBO comedy’s final installments.

From Larry David to Susie Essman to J.B. Smoove, the cast of Curb Your Enthusiasm is full of comedy heavyweights playing hilarious characters.




 7  Susie Greene (Susie Essman) 
First appeared in season 1, episode 1




With Larry and Susie having the greatest frenemy relationship on Curb Your Enthusiasm, Jeff’s wife returning for season 12 is incredibly exciting. The season 12 trailer reveals that Larry and Susie will continue to antagonize one another as expected, with Susie even yelling at the main character and telling him that he’s a “walking f***ing virus.” As one of the most beloved main characters and arguably Larry’s greatest rival, Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 is expected to feature several more humorous yelling matches between Susie and Larry. Between Curb Your Enthusiasm seasons 11 and 12, Susie Essman also had notable appearances in Theater Camp (2023), Hacks (2022), and Bob’s Burgers (2022).





 6  Cheryl David (Cheryl Hines) 
First appeared in pilot
        

Though she began the series as his wife, Cheryl and Larry David officially divorced in season 8 after splitting up in season 6, meaning the couple has been apart for approximately half of the series. Nevertheless, Larry and Cheryl being a formerly married couple has continued to be a point of focus in the series, whether it be about Larry’s attempts to win Cheryl back, his disdain for his “friends” dating her after their split, or recruiting her to help out with his new sitcom. Cheryl and Larry are just as much at odds as ever in Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12’s trailer, and her growing romance with Ted Danson appears to be an even bigger thorn in Larry’s side.





 5  Irma Kostroski (Tracey Ullman) 
First appeared in season 11, episode 7
        

While it seemed that the story arc with Tracey Ullman’s Irma Kostroski had concluded with Curb Your Enthusiasm season 11, Max’s season 12 trailer confirms the character is back for more. Larry dated Irma in season 11 for one of the show’s most confusing romances, and it seems the two will still be a couple for at least a short amount of time in season 12. Not only is Larry still dating Irma in season 12, but the trailer also reveals that Susie and Jeff are recruited for a double date in one of the upcoming episodes.





 4  Freddy Funkhouser (Vince Vaughn) 
First appeared in season 10, episode 5
        

The fictional Funkhouser family has been a staple of Curb Your Enthusiasm since season 4, with Bob Einstein’s Marty Funkhouser having been one of the most beloved recurring figures in the series. After Bob Einstein passed away in 2019, the show maintained his legacy within the show by bringing on Einstein’s real-life brother Albert Brooks for a cameo in season 11. The importance of his character, Marty Funkhouser, has also been maintained in the series through the increased presence of his half-brother Freddy Funkhouser, played by Vince Vaughn, who has taken on a similar dynamic with Larry.
Vaughn’s recurring character Freddy Funkhouser has now joined Larry in several memorable misadventures in Curb Your Enthusiasm seasons 10 and 11. Freddy is also confirmed to return for Curb Your Enthusiasm’s final season, with the trailer teasing a hilarious feud between him and Larry. With the Funkhousers being core to Curb Your Enthusiasm, there’s hope that other members such as Joey, Bam Bam, and Saul could also make appearances alongside Freddy.





 3  Richard Lewis (Himself) 
First appeared in pilot
        

Another character who was also in the original Curb Your Enthusiasm mockumentary special is comedian Richard Lewis, who plays a fictionalized version of himself in the series. After recovering from surgeries, Richard Lewis took a smaller role in Curb Your Enthusiasm season 11, where he only appeared in one episode. However, Lewis is back for Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 for some more long-awaited bantering and friendly insults with Larry.

Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 will be the show&#39;s final season, giving Larry David the chance to repeat the Seinfeld finale&#39;s best trick.





 2  Ted Danson (Himself) 
First appeared in season 1, episode 2



Cheers star Ted Danson has similarly been playing himself on Curb Your Enthusiasm since season 1, though with plenty of fictionalized changes to the actor’s life. While Danson began the series married to his real-life wife Mary Steenburgen, the fictional version of the character divorced Steenburgen and soon began pursuing Larry’s ex-wife, Cheryl. Like most of Larry’s long-term acquaintances, Danson is one of Larry’s biggest rivals despite having been friends for decades.
With Ted still dating Cheryl in Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12, their rivalry is apt to be even more entertaining than when Ted helped Mocha Joe try to take down Latte Larry’s. While unconfirmed, it’s possible that Mary Steenburgen could finally return alongside Ted for Curb Your Enthusiasm’s final outing. The actress hasn’t appeared on the comedy show since season 9, but her return would be a great way to wrap up the love triangle between Larry, Cheryl, and Ted.





 1  Mr. Takahashi (Dana Lee) 
First appeared in season 7, episode 7 Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12 will also see the return of the recurring character Mr. Takahashi, played by Dana Lee. Mr. Takahashi is a staple of Larry’s golfing-related antics, as he owns the country club where Larry and his friends are members. With Curb Your Enthusiasm season 12’s trailer including a clip of Larry and Mr. Takahashi angrily pointing at one another, it’s safe to say that Larry does something that disturbs the peace of Takahashi’s country club in the upcoming episodes.
