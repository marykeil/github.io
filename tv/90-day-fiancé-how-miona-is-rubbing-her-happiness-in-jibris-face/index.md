## Literature Review
Miona Bell from 90 Day Fiancé is living the American dream while Jibri Bell is in Thailand. She couldn&#39;t be happier in her latest Instagram posts.




Miona Bell from 90 Day Fiancé season 9 has had a great 2023 without her husband, Jibri Bell. The couple became popular in 2022 when they tied the knot and settled in Palm Springs, California. At the time, the pair used their reality TV fame and cashed in on it for their benefit. Miona started a new hair extensions brand and started making a lot of money. She used social media reach and her knowledge of fashion and beauty to make herself successful. Similarly, Jibri used the show to promote his music. All thanks to the 90 Day Fiancé fame, the aspiring musician also sold his ripped pants for nearly $30k.




2022 was an excellent year for Miona and Jibri. The two achieved several milestones and proved themselves to be a power couple. Miona called her parents to the United States, and Jibri made amends with his mom. The pair was able to build a mini-empire and seemed stronger than ever. However, something changed in 2023 when Jibri flew to Thailand, leaving Miona in the United States. He started a monk-like lifestyle and dropped hints that he had split from Miona. Likewise, Miona began focusing on her career and showing how happy she was on social media.
