## SUMMARY 



  Paola and Russ Mayfield considered joining 90 Day: The Last Resort but ultimately decided against it.   The couple didn&#39;t want to air their dirty laundry on The Last Resort, as their problems weren&#39;t as interesting as the other couples who joined the new spin-off.   Paola and Russ have a stable and supportive marriage, lacking the drama and intense marital issues that make for compelling reality TV.

## Literature Review
Paola Mayfield reveals why she didn&#39;t return to the 90 Day Fiancé franchise despite experiencing marital issues with her husband, Russ Mayfield.




Paola Mayfield from 90 Day Fiancé revealed that she almost joined 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 with her husband, Russ Mayfield. The 36-year-old reality star is most popular for starring in 90 Day Fiancé season 1. She joined the series when it premiered in early 2014 and settled down with her conservative beau in Oklahoma. Paola and Russ faced numerous challenges over the years due to their differing mindsets. The Colombian woman wanted to make a name for herself, while the American man wasn’t enthusiastic about her wild ambitions. The couple separated multiple times over the last decade but eventually made things work.




Recently, Paola opened up in an interview with InTouch and revealed a big secret. She shared that she and her husband contemplated joining 90 Day: The Last Resort but eventually decided not to. The mom of one said, “I was supposed to be on The Last Resort, but it didn’t work.” Paola claimed that she was glad things didn’t work out, as she ultimately didn&#39;t want to air out her dirty laundry. She also claimed that her and Russ’ problems weren’t nearly as interesting and wild as other pairs, such as Asuelu Pulaa and Kalani Faagata. The 90 Day Fiancé season 1 star added, “I didn’t have enough for that to cover compared to what I’m seeing.”

 Paola &amp; Russ&#39; 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          




Paola didn’t reveal why she almost joined 90 Day: The Last Resort. However, her past struggles with Russ hint at their possible main issues. The couple would likely have joined the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off because of Paola’s new profession. In the past, she mostly did modeling gigs and had a risk-free job. However, Paola now works as a wrestler and wants to win championships. It may be that Russ isn’t too keen on watching his wife risk her life for money. Pro-wrestling is a dangerous profession, which may have been the subject of discussion if Paola and Russ had joined The Last Resort.


 

It’s great to see Paola isn’t sad about losing the reality TV gig. Previously, there was some suggestion that she wasn’t mature enough as a wife and a mother. However, Paola’s comments in this latest interview reveal that she has grown a lot over the years. She was thankful she didn’t share her and Russ’ marital problems on reality TV, as it wouldn’t have been good for their marriage. Most pairs who appeared on the show went through a lot of embarrassment and pain. Molly Hopkins and Kelly Brown broke up, and Asuelu and Kalani got divorced. If Russ and Paola had joined the new spin-off, it could’ve ruined their stable marriage.




Paola is also right about not wanting to join The Last Resort because of the lack of drama in her ongoing relationship with Russ. Cast members like Yara Zaya, Kalani, and others had big bombshell reveals on the show. They faced severe marital issues and truly wanted to seek therapy to decide the future of their relationships. In comparison, Paola and Russ have supported each other over the years. They’ve grown to become great parents and don’t face the kind of marital issues that make for great reality TV. If Paola and Russ had appeared on 90 Day: The Last Resort, they likely would&#39;ve been labeled the most boring pair of the season.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
