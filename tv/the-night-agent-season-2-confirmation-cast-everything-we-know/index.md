 The Night Agent Season 2 Story Details 
          

Netflix has also yet to confirm the exact story details of The Night Agent season 2, but it is known that it will become an anthology series. This means that the next entry, and any other potential future seasons, will focus on entirely new storylines and characters with some protagonists from the previous season making small appearances. 

Even the lead actor of The Night Agent season 1, Gabriel Basso is unsure about what the exact story details of season 2 will be. According to Basso, &#34;I know at some point the writers and Shawn [Ryan] are going to reach out to me to sort of hear my thoughts, and we&#39;re all going to collaborate. But I think they&#39;re trying to just map out the general sense of the show right now&#34; (via TV Line). However, regardless of what the exact story details of this newest entry will be, The Night Agent season 2 is hotly anticipated and will likely be watched by millions when released.
