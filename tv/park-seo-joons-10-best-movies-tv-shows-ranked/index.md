 Gyeongseong Creature Part 2’s Ending &amp; THAT Post-Credits Scene Explained 
Gyeongseong Creature’s ending includes two major cliffhangers, one of which changes everything about Tae-sang’s story and sets up season 2.













 








 10  The Marvels (2023) 
Prince Yan


 







  The Marvels 

 Release Date   November 10, 2023    Director   Nia DaCosta    Cast   Brie Larson , Teyonah Parris , Iman Vellani , Zawe Ashton , Gary Lewis , Park Seo-joon , Zenobia Shroff , Mohan Kapur , Saagar Shaikh , Samuel L. Jackson    Genres   Action , Adventure , Fantasy , Superhero    Studio(s)   Marvel    Where To Stream   Disney&#43;    




The Marvels, directed by Nia DaCosta, is a sequel to 2019&#39;s Captain Marvel and continues from the Ms. Marvel miniseries. Park Seo-joon plays Prince Yan, a relatively obscure character from Marvel Comics who hails from Aladna, a unique planet where every inhabitant speaks in rhyme. His performance was received generally favorably. However, Park Seo-joon’s The Marvels character only appears for around 3 minutes in the movie. His short screen time upset and disappointed fans as he was featured in the film&#39;s promotional content, suggesting he would play a larger role.
Streaming on Disney&#43;. 






 9  She Was Pretty 
Ji Sung-joon
        

She Was Pretty is a heartwarming romantic comedy K-drama. The story revolves around Kim Hye Jin (Hwang Jung-eum), who transforms from a school beauty into an ordinary-looking woman, and her past acquaintance Ji Sung-Joon (Park Seo Joon), who fails to recognize her due to her changed appearance. She Was Pretty was praised by viewers for its focus on the importance of self-love. However, the show is not without flaws. Seo-joon&#39;s character initially comes off as unreasonably mean, particularly towards the female lead, which some viewers find off-putting. Despite this, Seo Joon&#39;s heartfelt performance and the overall charm of the show make it an enjoyable watch.
Streaming on Netflix and Viki. 






 8  Dream (2023) 
Yoon Hong-dae
        

Park Seo-joon stars alongside K-pop star IU in Dream, a Netflix Korean drama. The feel-good sports drama follows Yoon Hong-dae (Park Seo-joon) as he is forced to train the local homeless soccer team, who have no experience with the game. Seo-joon&#39;s performance is a highlight in the movie, particularly his great on-screen chemistry with his character&#39;s love interest, the aspiring director played by IU (Lee So-min). Despite a star-studded cast, the film didn&#39;t meet expectations, with viewers and critics finding the storyline overly contrived. The movie tries too hard to tug at heartstrings but lacks the necessary grace and subtlety to do so effectively.
Streaming on Netflix. 






 7  Gyeongseong Creature 
Jang Tae-sang
        

 Gyeongseong Creature 

 Release Date   December 22, 2023    Cast   Park Seo-joon , Han So-hee , Soo Hyun Kim    Genres   Action , Horror , Thriller    Seasons   2    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




Gyeongseong Creature is a K-drama where season 1 takes place in 1945 Gyeongseong (the old name for Seoul), although season 2 will take place in the modern day. The show blends elements of historical mystery with monsters. Park Seo-joon’s character in Gyeongseong Creature, Jang Tae Sang, is a wealthy and influential pawnbroker with deep insights into the city&#39;s illegal activities. Park Seo-joon once again delivers an outstanding performance, showcasing his strong screen presence and having great chemistry with co-star Han So-hee. However, despite his compelling performance, some viewers weren&#39;t happy with the show&#39;s overall pacing and the quality of its CGI.
Streaming on Netflix. 






 6  Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth 
Moo Myung
        

Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth is a South Korean TV series starring Park Seo-joon, BTS&#39; V (Kim Tae-hyung), and SHINee&#39;s Choi Minho. The historical K-drama centers on a prestigious group of young men known as the Hwarang in the Silla Kingdom (57 BC–AD 935). Park Seo-joon&#39;s performance is a show highlight, masterfully showcasing his character&#39;s transformation from wanting revenge to becoming a skilled fighter. However, Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth struggled with uneven pacing, slowing down in the middle episodes and dragging on.
Streaming on Netflix and Viki. 






 5  Kill Me, Heal Me 
Oh Ri-on
        

Kill Me, Heal Me is a Korean drama centered around Cha Do-Hyun (Ji Sung), an heir struggling with multiple personality disorder. The story follows Do-Hyun as he struggles to hide his condition with the help of Oh Ri-Jin (Hwang Jung-eum), a psychiatric resident, but Oh Ri-jin&#39;s brother Oh Ri-on (Park Seo-joon), a writer, becomes suspicious and is determined to uncover Do-Hyun&#39;s secret. The show brilliantly explores the complexities of Do-Hyun&#39;s condition and its impact on his life, and Park Seo-joon&#39;s acting skills shine through as the protective brother.
Streaming on Viki. 






 4  Midnight Runners (2017) 
Ki-joon
        

Midnight Runners is a 2017 South Korean action-comedy film starring Park Seo-joon as Ki-joon and Kang Ha-neul as Hee-Yeol, two students at the Korean National Police University who witnesses a young woman&#39;s kidnapping. Although the film initially seems like a buddy cop comedy, it takes a darker turn when a kidnapping becomes the central plot. Seo-joon and Ha-neul have excellent chemistry in the movie, bouncing off each other incredibly well in the more comedic scenes. The film became one of the highest-grossing movies of that year in South Korea, and Park Seo-joon won the Best New Actor Award at the 54th Grand Bell Awards for his performance.
Streaming on Viki and Amazon Prime Video. 






 3  What&#39;s Wrong with Secretary Kim (2018) 
Lee Young Joon


 







 What&#39;s Wrong With Secretary Kim? (2018) 

 Release Date   June 6, 2018    Cast   Park Seo-joon , Park Min-young , Lee Tae-hwan , Kim Beyong-ok , Baek Eun-hye , Heo Sun-mi , Jo Deok-hyun    Seasons   1    Creator(s)   Jung Kyung-yoon , Park Joon-hwa    




What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim is a light-hearted romantic comedy and one of the steamiest K-dramas of recent years. The story follows vice-chairman Lee Young-joon (Park Seo-joon), who is determined to make his competent secretary Kim Mi-so (Park Min-young) stay, even after she announces her resignation. Park Seo-joon delivers a wonderful performance, skillfully portraying Young Joon’s transition from a self-centered boss to a character showing genuine growth and depth. Despite the show containing some romance clichés, Park Seo-joon and Park Min-young share great on-screen chemistry that radiates throughout the series.
Streaming on Viki. 






 2  Itaewon Class 
Sae-roi
        

Itaewon Class is commonly referred to as being one of the best K-dramas ever, and Park Seo-joon&#39;s performance is a real highlight. In the show, Park Seo-joon portrays Park Sae-roi, a man who seeks revenge against a major food business tycoon responsible for his father&#39;s death. Following a prison sentence for attempting to kill the tycoon&#39;s son, Sae-roi is released and chooses to honor his father by opening &#39;DanBam,&#39; a pub in Seoul&#39;s Itaewon district. Park Seo-joon&#39;s ability to depict Sae-roi&#39;s inner turmoil, unwavering determination, and gradual transformation into a savvy business leader is extraordinary.
Streaming on Netflix. 






 1  Fight For My Way 
Dong Man


 







Fight For My Way is a charming K-Drama that masterfully blends friendship, romance, family, and ambition. Park Seo Joon shines as Dong Man, an adorably dim former Taekwondo athlete turned ordinary worker, battling his past and striving for success. The show, with its relatable characters and slice-of-life feel, is like comfort food - cozy and satisfying. Its realistic portrayal of everyday struggles and the sparky chemistry between the leads make it a super engaging watch. Park Seo-joon won several awards for his exceptional performance, including &#39;Best Couple&#39; with co-star Kim Ji-won and the &#39;Outstanding Actor Award&#39; at the 13th Seoul International Awards.
