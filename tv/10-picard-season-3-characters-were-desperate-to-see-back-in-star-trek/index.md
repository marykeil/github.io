## Literature Review
Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s ending sets up a continuation that needs to happen to continue the stories of these fan-favorite characters.




Star Trek: Picard season 3 was a resounding success, and while the series nicely ended the story of the Star Trek: The Next Generation crew, there are some characters we desperately want to see again. Picard season 3 brought the TNG icons back together for one final adventure aboard the rebuilt USS Enterprise-D. Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew saved the Federation from a Changeling/Borg takeover, with help from some returning friends and some new faces. After the dust cleared from the climactic final battle, Picard season 3 hinted at more adventures to come, with the introduction of the newly rechristened USS Enterprise-G.
Despite the perfect setup, nothing has been said about the long-rumored Picard spin-off, Star Trek: Legacy. Showrunner Terry Matalas, Patrick Stewart, and many others have expressed interest in returning for another Star Trek project, and the interest from fans for Star Trek: Legacy is certainly there. The returning TNG actors were better than ever in Star Trek: Picard and the season proved that they have more stories to tell. Star Trek has had success with revisiting old characters and telling prequel stories, but Star Trek: Legacy, or a show like it, would allow the franchise to move into the future.
            
 
 12 Biggest Picard Season 3 Questions Star Trek Legacy Can Answer 
Star Trek: Picard season 3 wrapped up most of the seriesâ€™ storylines, but there are still a few questions that could be answered in a Legacy spinoff.













 








 10  Jonathan Frakes &amp; Marina Sirtis as Captain William Riker &amp; Counselor Deanna Troi 
The Star Trek power couple.


 







Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes were wonderful in Star Trek: Picard season 3. With Deanna and Will&#39;s relationship on the mend, they ended the season preparing for a much-needed vacation with their daughter, Kestra (Lulu Wilson). Although their main story has been largely concluded, they could still be involved in a future Star Trek project. Riker seems primed for a promotion, meaning he could take on the role of the Admiral who oversees the adventures of a new show&#39;s main characters. For example, if Star Trek: Legacy were to take on the story of Captain Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) and the USS Enterprise-G, Riker could be the Admiral back at Starfleet Headquarters who provides Seven with her missions.
Though Kestra only appeared in one episode of Star Trek: Picard season 1, Lulu Wilson was great in the role, and it would be fun to see her story continue as well. 






 9  LeVar Burton as Commodore Geordi La Forge 
The former Enterprise Engineer turned father.
        

With his rank of Commodore and his position as Head Curator of the Starfleet Museum, Geordi La Forge is in a great spot to appear in future Star Trek projects. Of the original Star Trek: The Next Generation crew members, Geordi was the most reluctant to defy Starfleet for his former captain, Admiral Picard. He was understandably worried for the safety of his daughters, Sidney (Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut) and Alandra (Mica Burton), but it was their urging that convinced him to join his former crew in their mission to save the Federation. Geordi seems like the type of father who would want to keep tabs on his children, so if Sidney and Alandra show up in a future Star Trek project, Geordi should also make an appearance.





 8  Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher 
The fighting doctor &amp; protective mother.
        

Gates McFadden&#39;s Dr. Beverly Crusher changed perhaps more than any other character since her time on TNG, and Star Trek should definitely explore more of her character. Every Star Trek show needs a doctor and Dr. Crusher is one of the best, whether she&#39;s serving as the Chief Medical Officer on a Starship or flying around the galaxy helping those in need. Even if Dr. Crusher remains head of Starfleet Medical, she could check in periodically with the main crew. Future appearances of Dr. Crusher could also allow the show to reveal more information about the twenty years of her life between Star Trek: Nemesis and Picard season 3.
Jean-Luc, Beverly, and their son Jack Crusher (Ed Speleers) ended Star Trek: Picard season 3 together, giving a future Star Trek show the opportunity to check in on the recently reunited family. 






 7  Brent Spiner as Data 
The android who finally became human.
        

Since his introduction in the pilot episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Brent Spiner&#39;s Data has had a roller coaster of a story arc. After a satisfying arc throughout TNG&#39;s seven seasons, the TNG movies introduced an emotion chip that turned Data&#39;s journey to be human into comedic relief. Picard season 3 finally gave Data the ending he deserves, with an upgraded synthetic body and the ability to experience organic emotions. While the scenes involving Data were great, Picard didn&#39;t have much time to dive into Data&#39;s new emotions and what they mean for him. An appearance in Star Trek: Legacy or another future Trek project would allow Data to continue his exploration of what it means to be human and give him the chance to meet his &#34;daughter,&#34; Soji (Isa Briones).





 6  John de Lancie as Q 
The trickster who can&#39;t leave a Picard alone.
        

John de Lancie&#39;s Q is always a welcome face in a Star Trek show, and the final scene of Star Trek: Picard season 3 provided him with the perfect opportunity for future appearances. Although Q believed that he was dying in Picard season 2, that doesn&#39;t prevent the character from continuing to be a thorn in the side of the Picard family. As a member of the Q Continuum, Q exists outside of time and possesses god-like powers, meaning he can appear when and wherever the story takes him. Because of his affection for Jean-Luc Picard, Q could even take on a protector role of sorts, helping Jack Crusher out of the many scrapes he will inevitably find himself in.





 5  Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut as Lt. Sidney La Forge &amp; Mica Burton as Ensign Alandra La Forge 
The fabulous La Forge sisters.
        

As the daughters of Geordi La Forge, Sidney and Alandra represent the future of Starfleet and their Star Trek story is only just beginning. The helmsman of the USS Titan-A, Sidney took on a larger role in Star Trek: Picard season 3 than her sister, but both La Forge women worked together to convince their father to join Admiral Picard. Sidney also began a flirtatious back-and-forth with Jack Crusher, hinting at a future romance between the pair. At the end of Star Trek: Picard season 3, Sidney remained a pilot on the USS Enterprise-G, and a potential spin-off could easily find a position on the ship for Alandra as well.





 4  Todd Stashwick as Liam Shaw 
The grumpy new captain.


 







Captain Liam Shaw became a breakout fan-favorite character in Star Trek: Picard season 3, thanks in part to Todd Stashwick&#39;s pitch-perfect delivery of all of Shaw&#39;s sarcastic quips. Despite Shaw&#39;s apparent death in Picard season 3, episode 9, &#34;Vox,&#34; both showrunner Terry Matalas and Stashwick himself have hinted that Shaw could return. With his interesting history with the Borg and the Battle of Wolf 359, there&#39;s so much about Shaw that could still be explored. From his introduction, Shaw was a very different kind of Starfleet captain, and he would be a welcome face on any new Trek show.

Todd Stashwick&#39;s Captain Shaw became a fan-favorite character during Star Trek: Picard season 3. Here are 10 reasons why Star Trek: Legacy needs him.









 3  Michelle Hurd as Commander Raffi Musiker 
The act first, questions later commander.
        

Commander Raffi Musiker was one of the most interesting and complex new characters to come out of Star Trek: Picard, and her story seems far from over. Michelle Hurd brought a compelling realness to the character, and Raffi has one of the best story arcs over Picard&#39;s three seasons. Now that Raffi has taken her place as Captain Seven&#39;s first officer on the Enterprise-G, she likely has many incredible adventures ahead of her. With her colorful past and work in Starfleet Intelligence, Raffi could provide a wealth of storylines for a new Trek show, and it would be fun to see her in the action-oriented role of first officer.





 2  Ed Speleers as Ensign Jack Crusher 
The son of two legends.
        

As the son of Jean-Luc Picard and Beverly Crusher, Jack has some big shoes to fill, and his Starfleet career is just getting started. Jack landed a spot on the bridge of the USS Enterprise-G as the Special Counselor to Captain Seven of Nine. It remains to be seen what this position entails, but it places Jack at the center of the action. In the final post-credits scene of Picard season 3, Q returns to tell Jack that his trial is only just beginning. With Jack&#39;s position on the Enterprise and Q&#39;s interest in him, Star Trek has set up some great storylines for Jack Crusher, and it would be a shame to let these stories go unfulfilled.





 1  Jeri Ryan as Captain Seven of Nine 
The former Borg drone turned Starfleet captain.


 







Star Trek: Picard season 3 ends with Seven of Nine finally in the captain&#39;s chair, and it would be unfortunate if viewers never get to see her command her own starship. Since her debut in Star Trek: Voyager season 4, Seven of Nine has had a wonderful and compelling story arc, as she went from a mistrusted former Borg drone to a respected Starfleet officer. Seven&#39;s story simply doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s at an end, and Jeri Ryan brings such great energy to the character, that it would be a shame for Star Trek to lose her. Whether the future of Star Trek lies in Star Trek: Legacy or some other yet-to-be-revealed project, Seven and the other characters on this list should have a place in that future.
Star Trek: Picard season 3 is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
