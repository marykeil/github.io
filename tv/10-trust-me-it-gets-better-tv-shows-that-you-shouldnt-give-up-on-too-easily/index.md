## Literature Review
Some TV shows can take a little while to get going. It can be tempting to give up on them, but sticking it out can be extremely rewarding.




Some of the best TV shows ever made require a little bit of patience, and their quality isn&#39;t immediately obvious from the beginning. Most people have probably heard the phrase &#34;trust me, it gets better&#34; when talking about shows that they struggle to get through. Giving up after a few episodes or even a whole season can be very tempting, but there are plenty of great shows which reward the patience of their audience. Very few shows manage to hit the ground running, but they still use their first episodes to set up important character details and plot points.
Some of these TV shows develop a better sense of themselves over time, so the quality can massively improve after a little while. Often, there is clearly a great idea at the heart of the show, but it takes time for the writers and actors to dial into how exactly to facilitate this idea. Other shows start slowly on purpose. They use pacing as a tool to manipulate their audience and create a sense of intrigue. Slow-burn shows can be extremely satisfying if audiences decide to stick with them after the first few episodes. With most great TV shows, it doesn&#39;t take too long for them to become addicting, but audiences sometimes need to endure a slow start.




 10  Mad Men (2007-2015) 
The plot eventually catches up to the infectious style of the 1960s setting


 Mad Men 
Mad Men is the award-winning show created by Matthew Wiener that stars Jon Hamm as Don Draper, a masterful ad man in the high-speed advertising world. Set between the 1960s and 70s; Mad Men explores this &#34;Golden Age&#34; of advertising, where everyone has something to sell, and those who don&#39;t score a quick win are out of the game. The series also examines the world from a few other character&#39;s perspectives, such as Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), a young woman who starts as a secretary for Don despite the difficulty for women to be taken seriously in business during this time, rises to the challenge to become an ad woman of her own.
 Release Date   July 19, 2007    Cast   Jon Hamm , Elisabeth Moss , Vincent Kartheiser , January Jones , Christina Hendricks , Bryan Batt , Aaron Staton , Rich Sommer    Main Genre   Drama    Genres   Drama    




Mad Men&#39;s sleek 1960s charm is usually enough to keep audiences interested for at least a few episodes, but its period quirks do a lot of the heavy lifting for the first season or so. It takes a little while to set up the plot lines which will run throughout the series, like Don’s secret past, Betty’s creeping ennui, and Peggy’s growing ambition. While the show does so, it often resembles a slice-of-life on Madison Avenue, with high-powered misogynist business executive luxuriating at boozy lunches on the company card. It’s still strangely watchable, but it doesn’t indicate how hilarious and gripping the show eventually becomes.





 9  BoJack Horseman (2014-2020) 
The show doesn&#39;t reveal its true depth right away




Once BoJack Horseman has time to explore its wacky characters a little deeper, the show gains a much heavier emotional resonance. 

BoJack Horseman has a quirky premise from the outset, but after the novelty of a depressed Hollywood horse starts to wear off, the show’s first season looks a lot like many other adult animations. Will Arnett is still pitch-perfect, and BoJack’s group of friends are each beautifully designed to antagonize him, but the show doesn’t begin to set itself apart from its peers until much later. Once BoJack Horseman has time to explore its wacky characters a little deeper, the show gains a much heavier emotional resonance. By the time BoJack Horseman’s avant-garde finale aired, it was barely recognizable in tone or quality.



 8  Severance (2022-) 
Deeply intoxicating if given a chance
        

It’s a unique sci-fi premise that comments on modern society’s unhealthy obsession with work, but the first episode doesn’t indicate just how deep the show’s exploration of this idea can go. 

Severance’s first episode introduces Mark, an office worker who has undergone a surgical procedure to sever his work self from his home self. It’s a unique sci-fi premise that comments on modern society’s unhealthy obsession with work, but the first episode doesn’t indicate just how deep the show’s exploration of this idea can go. Severance is a slow-burn show with elements of mystery woven into the narrative. It might take a couple of episodes for the show to sink its hooks into its audience, but it doesn’t let go. What seems like a quirky concept is just the tip of the iceberg.





 7  The Office (2005-2013) 
The American version needs time to get away from its British roots




For its first few episodes, The Office struggles to distinguish itself from the British version. Some of the jokes are lifted word-for-word from the British show starring Ricky Gervais and Martin Freeman, but they don’t sound natural in a different context. Once The Office figures out how to distinguish Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute, in particular, from their British counterparts, the show starts to forge its own identity. Even the lighting and the pacing change after a while, making the show look and feel more like an American sitcom. It began as a disappointing adaptation, but The Office thrived when it gained the confidence to ignore its source material.





 6  Adventure Time (2010-2018) 
Finn and Jake don&#39;t immediately stand out from the crowd
        

Adventure Time is often described as a children’s cartoon that can be enjoyed by adults, but looking at the show’s earlier seasons shows no trace of the deep and complex lore that adults find most appealing about the show. Adventure Time gradually reveals the dark secrets behind the fantastical land of Ooo, showing that the candy people and magical villains are all the byproduct of a nuclear apocalypse on Earth. The show’s horror elements start to creep in later on too. The spinoff, Fionna and Cake, is more mature than Adventure Time, underlining how the show’s audience expanded beyond just children.





 5  Breaking Bad (2008-2013) 
Walter and Jesse&#39;s dynamic takes a few episodes to develop
        

Breaking Bad’s pilot episode is a masterpiece in restricted storytelling. In just one episode, the show details how Walter’s tenuous family situation and his unsatisfying work life have all but crushed his spirit. A cancer diagnosis and a chance reunion with a former troublemaking student later, and Walt ends the episode clutching a gun in the desert, with his mobile meth lab behind him. This should be all the incentive needed to keep watching, but the next couple of episodes plod along without the same thrust or clarity of purpose. Many of Breaking Bad’s best episodes come much later in the show’s run.





 4  It&#39;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia (2005-) 
The first season doesn&#39;t indicate how great the show becomes
        

It’s Always Sunny received a massive boost in quality for its second season, and this is all down to the addition of Danny DeVito. The show’s first season was still unusual in the landscape of TV sitcoms, but it needed refining. DeVito is not just a comedic powerhouse, but his character brings out the best in the other characters. Dennis and Dee have their useless father present as a constant reminder of their ridiculous upbringing, and Charlie has become much funnier too, thanks to his strange relationship with Frank. It’s Always Sunny season 17 is coming, and it’s hard to imagine the show could have lasted so long without Frank.





 3  Game Of Thrones (2011-2019) 
Westeros can be a little confusing at first




Game of Thrones drops its audience into the world of Westeros without much of an introduction for any of the major players involved. The first episode seems like a normal day in the life of an expansive fantasy realm. It can be disorienting at first, especially with the unusual vernacular and some important worldbuilding elements which don’t get much explicit explanation. Getting to grips with the show’s setting and its characters is part of the joy of the first season, although the show doesn’t truly hit its stride until much later, once the characters and the stakes have had enough time to be established naturally.





 2  Twin Peaks (1990-1991) 
David Lynch uses pacing to toy with his audience





Lynch knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning, and he manipulates the pace of the show to lull his audience into making their own comfortable assumptions. 

David Lynch’s surrealist masterpiece Twin Peaks takes a couple of episodes before it starts to reveal its supernatural elements and its most eccentric characters. The show appears at first to be a fairly standard crime drama, with an FBI agent investigating the brutal murder of a homecoming queen in a small town. Of course, Lynch knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning, and he manipulates the pace of the show to lull his audience into making their own comfortable assumptions. When Lynch turns these assumptions upside-down, his magic trick is revealed. The show’s unconventional storytelling makes Twin Peaks one of the most influential shows of all time.





 1  The Wire (2002-2008) 
An exquisitely detailed slow-burn
        

Despite the show’s framing as a crime drama, it isn’t the kind of propulsive, action-heavy thrill-ride that audiences have come to expect from the genre. 

The Wire is frequently lauded as one of the greatest TV shows of all time, but its slow, methodical approach doesn’t immediately captivate its audience. Despite the show’s framing as a crime drama, it isn’t the kind of propulsive, action-heavy thrill-ride that audiences have come to expect from the genre. The dialogue and the pacing offer a more naturalistic approach, but this makes the impact of the show’s big moments stand out even more. The first few episodes of each season let things simmer, but it always builds to an explosive ending. Seasons 3 and 4 are usually considered the best.
