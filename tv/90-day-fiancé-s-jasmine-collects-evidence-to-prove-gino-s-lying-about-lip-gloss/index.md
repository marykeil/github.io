## Literature Review
Jasmine Pineda plays detective to prove the lip gloss she found in Gino Palazzolo&#39;s car in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 did not belong to her.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda has proof that Gino Palazzolo is lying about the lip gloss and has indeed cheated on her with another woman. They are currently starring in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Jasmine used to be a teacher in Panama. She met Gino, an automotive engineer, online. They were together for a few months when Gino proposed to her. Jasmine could never get herself to trust Gino when they were in a long-distance relationship. She always asked him to send reports. He had to share his location and photos of where he was. Jasmine always had her suspicions about Gino.




Jasmine found a lip gloss tube in Gino&#39;s car underneath her seat in a recent episode and accused him of cheating on her. Some fans suspected it was Jasmine&#39;s own lip gloss she&#39;d dropped to make false accusations about Gino. However, Jasmine is now trying to clear her name and just claimed that she&#39;s got evidence in her favor.

          

Jasmine shared a poll on her Instagram Stories to figure out who fans thought the lip gloss belonged to. Most of Jasmine&#39;s fans voted for &#34;Gino&#39;s ex&#34; and &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter, he&#39;s guilty anyways.&#34; A few of Jasmine&#39;s fans even believed it belonged to a “potential secret lover,” and some thought it was “Gino’s secret lover aka sugar baby’s.” Jasmine wrote, &#34;The lipstick is absolutely not mine!!!&#34;

 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Jasmine Pineda Proves Lip Gloss Is Not Hers 
          

Jasmine tried to explain why the lip gloss couldn&#39;t have belonged to her. Jasmine uses makeup that is vegan and cruelty-free. The product that Jasmine found in Gino&#39;s car wasn&#39;t. She also said it was a color that she didn&#39;t like wearing. Jasmine claimed she checked which brand the lip gloss belonged to and the lab in which it was made. &#34;It is fresh,&#34; she added. When Jasmine asked Gino about the lip gloss, he claimed it could have belonged to one of his co-workers. Gino told Jasmine he often hung out with his office colleagues and one of them could have left it in his car.





 

Moreover, Gino claimed his truck was more than 6.5 years old, and he generally never bothered to clean under the passenger seat. He suggested the lip gloss could have been lying in his vehicle for a long time. Gino&#39;s statement came across as absurd. However, it was also a believable comment because of how messy his house was. Jasmine even got an allergic reaction because of the dust in Gino&#39;s house. Jasmine, on the other hand, found out that lip gloss is not &#34;old.&#34; She added, &#34;I have all the evidence and reports,&#34; in conclusion.

Jasmine has reason to believe that Gino has indeed cheated on her with a mystery woman. The next episode of 90 Day Fiancé also has Jasmine finding out that Gino threw a secret bachelor party while she was in Panama. Gino&#39;s sister-in-law, Michelle, told Jasmine everything about it. Michelle said Gino went to a strip club for his bachelor party. This revelation has further cemented Jasmine&#39;s suspicions about Gino. She is about to confront Gino about it and might just end up leaving him to go back to Panama.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
