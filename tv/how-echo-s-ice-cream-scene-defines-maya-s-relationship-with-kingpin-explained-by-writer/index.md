## Literature Review

Exclusive: Echo writer and executive producer Amy Rardin discusses how the ice cream man scene defines Maya&#39;s complex relationship with Wilson Fisk.




Echo executive producer and writer Amy Rardin explained why Wilson Fisk is such an interesting character, pointing to his complicated relationship with Maya as one of her favorite parts of the series. Fisk has always been a character steeped in violence who pulls those he loves into his world. Part of what is so intriguing about his relationship with Maya is how he shaped her, especially her view of violence, which began with a very specific moment from her childhood.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Echo, Rardin discussed Maya&#39;s relationship with Wilson Fisk. She points to the formative moment when Maya learns of the violence of Fisk beating the ice cream man, who was cruel to her. Rardin explained why exploring Maya and recognizing that while Fisk loves her, he also manipulates her is what makes Fisk such an interesting character. Check out Raridn&#39;s full quote below:


Amy Rardin: Oh, that was one of my favorite parts of the show; getting to explore this relationship. In the room, we kept imagining in our heads what it was like to be raised by this man.
I think the scene with the ice cream man informs everything that you need to know about how she was raised by this person. Children are watching, and they see how the adults act. I think that was really interesting to me; to show the story of a woman who realizes this man who was looming so large in her life loved her, in his own twisted way, but was manipulating her. And for her to be able to get out from under his thumb I think is very empowering - and for her to hope that he&#39;ll be able to get out of under his own thumb, and unfortunately, he can&#39;t.
But I think that there is a basis of weird love there, and I think that&#39;s what makes Fisk a really interesting character, because he does have the capacity to love, he just loves in a twisted, messed-up way.






 Where Do Echo &amp; Kingpin Go After The Finale? 
         

The MCU seems to be setting up Wilson Fisk as the major player in street-level crime, making him a major villain for many potential heroes. Clint Barton showed genuine concern when his involvement was revealed, but Echo showed a new side of the crime lord in his relationship with Maya. Wilson Fisk will appear in Daredevil: Born Again as the devil of Hell&#39;s Kitchen&#39;s main foe, but anything before that remains a mystery.

                  Does The MCU&#39;s Wilson Fisk Know Matt Murdock Is Daredevil?   Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil is back in the MCU and so is his nemesis, Wilson Fisk, but will Kingpin know Daredevil&#39;s identity in Born Again?   

The final moments of Echo seem to be setting up Wilson Fisk as a potential mayoral candidate, maybe even winning the election. This could make him an even more dangerous adversary that will bring together all the street-level heroes, especially if Matt Murdock first tries to take him down through legal means in Daredevil: Born Again. This could also be a way to pull Maya back into the fray because of her knowledge and connection to Fisk.






Maya could be the ace up Daredevil&#39;s sleeve to try and take down Fisk, not only because of her deep personal knowledge of the criminal but also because she has shown an ability to tap into a soft spot he holds for her.




Echo set up an interesting future for Fisk that will no doubt be explored in Daredevil: Born Again and beyond. However, Echo also brought out a side of Fisk that is often hidden and shows the violent cycle that he has continued not only with himself but in how he raised Maya as well.
