## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Theresa Nist chose a beautiful dress to wear to her and Gerry Turner&#39;s rehearsal dinner before their Golden Wedding.




The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist are getting married on January 4, and the beautiful dress that Theresa wore to their rehearsal dinner has been revealed. Gerry and Theresa fell in love during The Golden Bachelor, and felt an instant connection. From Gerry giving Theresa a cupcake on premiere night, which was her 70th birthday, to their first one-on-one date in which they danced with a flash mob to Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believin&#39;,&#34; they shared many wonderful memories. The most meaningful and important moments were when they got engaged on The Golden Bachelor season finale, and then announced that they&#39;d be getting married as soon as possible.




In an Instagram post, The Golden Bachelor star Gerry shared some photographs from his and Theresa&#39;s rehearsal dinner.

          

Theresa wore a sleeveless silver and gold metallic sequined dress with colorful accents on the bottom. She paired the dress with gold high heels and a mauve faux fur stole to keep her warm. Gerry wore a pink button-down shirt with a maroon jacket, jeans, and black sneakers. The outdoor rehearsal dinner was attended by Gerry and Theresa&#39;s family members. The centerpieces included flowers with candles, atop tables with white and silver flowered tablecloths.

 Theresa Nist Celebrates Daughterâ€™s Birthday On Same Day As Wedding 
          

In a separate Instagram post, Theresa wished her daughter, Jen, a happy birthday. Jen&#39;s birthday is the same day as The Golden Wedding. Theresa wrote, &#34;Happy birthday to my beautiful, strong, kind, supportive, loving, super smart, and overall wonderful and amazing daughter, and my best friend, Jennifer Ann!! I could not dream of a better daughter. I love you with all my heart!!! I hope you have the best birthday ever!!!!&#34;


 

Theresa looked gorgeous at her Golden Wedding rehearsal dinner. The pictures that Gerry shared of him and Theresa with their families were joyous, and they previewed their upcoming wedding, which is certain to be spectacular. All of Theresa&#39;s fellow Golden Bachelor contestants were invited to the wedding, and several of them have already confirmed their attendance. Runner-up Leslie Fhima will be there, along with Kathy Swarts, who&#39;ll be a &#34;Gold Carpet&#34; correspondent alongside The Bachelorette season 20 star Charity Lawson, interviewing the guests as they arrive, and Susan Noles, who&#39;ll officiate the ceremony.




Theresa has given all of the credit for the wedding planning to her daughter, Jen, whom she&#39;s described as a lifesaver during this time. She&#39;s said that Jen loves Gerry, so she&#39;s happy to share her birthday with what will become their wedding anniversary. Theresa and Jen have a very loving mother-daughter relationship, which was evident on The Golden Bachelor. Jen is a supportive daughter, who put her heart and soul into planning the wedding of Theresa and Gerry&#39;s dreams. The Golden Wedding is going to be one of the greatest reality television moments.

The Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding airs January 4 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
