## Literature Review
Bachelor in Paradise season 9 contestant Rachel Recchia self-eliminated from the show, but didn&#39;t give anyone her rose. Here&#39;s why she should have.




Bachelor in Paradise season 9 contestant Rachel Recchia decided to self-eliminate from the show without handing out her rose to anyone at the rose ceremony, but she should&#39;ve given it out before she left. Rachel got her start when she was the runner-up alongside Gabby Windey on Clayton Echard&#39;s Bachelor season. They then made history together when they starred in the first-ever dual Bachelorette season. During the season finale, Rachel got engaged to Tino Franco, but they broke up when Tino kissed another woman during a rough patch in their relationship.




During Rachel&#39;s time on Bachelor in Paradise season 9, she made a few connections, but none of them lasted. Now she has self-eliminated from the competition without giving out her rose at the rose ceremony. However, there are reasons why she should&#39;ve given her rose to one of the two remaining men, Brayden Bowers or Taylor Pegg, who were then eliminated.

Rachel first started dating Sean McLaughlin, but their relationship ended when Sean offended her by saying that she liked him more than he liked her. Rachel then had a fantastic one-on-one date with Brayden, but he went on a date with Becca Serrano directly after it. Rachel was disappointed and confused by this, but Tanner Courtad offered her his rose at the rose ceremony. Tanner was upset when Rachel then went on a date with Jordan Vandergriff when he arrived on the beach and asked her to go with him. She reconnected with Jordan after eliminating him on her first Bachelorette one-on-one date.




However, Tanner and Rachel later decided that they wanted to give their relationship a try. Sadly, Rachel was devastated when Tanner insulted her at the Paradise Comedy Roast. She later told Jordan that there was no one she&#39;d rather give her rose to than him. However, Jordan admitted to some of the other contestants that he didn&#39;t know if his relationship with Rachel was anything more than a friendship. Jordan decided to pursue Mercedes Northup instead because she&#39;d just broken up with Tyler Norris. Also, Tanner was suddenly &#34;all-in&#34; on Jess Girod after she and Blake Moynes broke up.

At the rose ceremony, Rachel self-eliminated after Mercedes gave her rose to Jordan and Jess gave hers to Tanner, leaving Rachel with only Brayden and Taylor as her choices. She tearfully informed host Jesse Palmer that she wanted to leave because she&#39;d told herself that she&#39;d go when she knew that it was time. Jesse announced that Rachel&#39;s rose was &#34;forfeited.&#34; Therefore, Brayden and Taylor were eliminated from Bachelor in Paradise season 9.

 Taylor Pegg Could Have Stayed Longer 
Taylor Was Eliminated By Charity Lawson On Night One Of The Bachelorette Season 20
          

Bachelor in Paradise season 9 contestant Taylor could have stayed longer if Rachel had given him her rose. He arrived very late on the beach with Jordan. Jordan received a date card, but Taylor didn&#39;t. Unlike many other new arrivals on the beach, Taylor never had the chance to go on a one-on-one date. His opening segment during the &#34;Almost Paradise&#34; theme song even makes a joke of this by having him open an envelope, only to find that it was filled with sand.

Although Rachel didn&#39;t have a romantic connection with Taylor, she could&#39;ve given him her rose before she left the show so that he would&#39;ve had a second chance at love. This is especially true since Charity eliminated him on night one of her season, so he never had a chance on that show either. He deserved more time.

Although Brayden left Rachel for Becca, Becca suddenly self-eliminated before the rose ceremony. Fortunately for him, the men were handing out the roses that week, so Brayden gave his rose to Olivia Lewis who&#39;d been left by John Henry Spurlock for Kat Izzo. Brayden had already been dumped by Kat for Tanner, so he knew how it felt to be left without a connection after being excited about someone.

Even though Brayden made some mistakes, he has a good heart, and seemed genuine about finding love. Although Rachel didn&#39;t owe him anything, she could&#39;ve given him the rose if she was leaving anyway. However, Rachel and Brayden seem to have become close friends because they were sitting together at Charity&#39;s &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; episode. Rachel could&#39;ve given Brayden her rose to allow him to stay in Paradise and try to make a new connection.




It&#39;s understandable that Rachel wanted to self-eliminate from Bachelor in Paradise season 9 after everything she went through. It simply didn&#39;t work out for her. However, leaving without giving out her rose meant that both Brayden and Taylor were sent home. Rachel could&#39;ve given one of them her rose before she left to allow them to explore a possible connection before Paradise ended. Still, Rachel should be given some grace because she made the best decision for her in that moment.

The Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale airs Thursday, December 7 at 8 p.m. on ABC.
