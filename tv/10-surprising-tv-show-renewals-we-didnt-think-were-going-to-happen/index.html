  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Popular TV shows including Friends, Friday Night Lights, and Galavant were saved from cancellation by fans or just managed to survive low ratings.</p>
<p>Throughout TV history, audiences and showrunners have believed a show was finished, only for it be unexpectedly renewed. In some cases, fan communities rallied to save a show, relentlessly campaigning via social media or (before the internet) handwritten letters to the studio. Fans of Star Trek and Friday Night Lights succeeded in convincing the same studio to revive their shows, 40 years apart.
On the other hand, the game of TV show cancellations and renewals is also affected by corporate discussions and plain luck. Writers do their best to work with studio executives to end the show at the right time. However, there are some cases where a show should not have been renewed. With shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Once Upon a Time, the story was finished when the show was given another season. The following seasons were of decidedly poorer quality.</p>
<p>10  Galavant (2015-2016)
Galavant is considered lucky to have gotten a second season.</p>
<p>ABC took a risk by producing Galavant, a comedy-musical about a knight abandoned by his one true love for an evil king, with songs composed by Alan Menken. It received poor ratings during season 1 and many believed it would be cancelled. Following its surprise renewal, the Galavant season 2 premiere was titled &ldquo;A New Season aka Suck It Cancellation Bear.&rdquo; Galavant was cancelled after season 2 and the fan campaign to save the show was unsuccessful. The Galavant cast subsequently produced a music video lip-syncing and dancing to Justin Timberlake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Stop the Feeling&rdquo; to thank the fans for their efforts (via Entertainment Weekly).</p>
<p>9  Lucifer (2016-2021)
Lucifer was saved by fans and Netflix.</p>
<p>Lucifer</p>
<p>Release Date   January 25, 2016    Cast   Tom Ellis , Kevin Rankin , Lesley-Ann Brandt , Rachael Harris , D.B. Woodside , Kevin Alejandro , Lauren German , Scarlett Estevez    Genres   Fantasy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   6    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Story By   Tom Kapinos</p>
<p>The fantasy TV show Lucifer is based on the DC Comics character created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, and Mike Dringenberg. The show follows the devil himself, who abandons ruling Hell and moves to Los Angeles to open a nightclub and work with the LAPD. Lucifer was cancelled after three seasons on Fox, but was picked up by Netflix for another three seasons.
When it looked as though Lucifer was coming to an end, droves of fans participated in the #SaveLucifer campaign, encouraged by show co-creator Joe Henderson commenting that the story was not over: “We created a season finale with a huge cliffhanger so that there was no way Fox could cancel us. Instead, we’re going to frustrate the hell out of you fans. I’m so sorry for that” (via Entertainment Weekly).</p>
<p>10 Times Fans Saved TV Shows From Being Canceled
The cancelation of some TV shows has been so surprising and undeserved that fans joined forces and successfully saved their favorite shows.</p>
<p>8  Buffy The Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)
Buffy&rsquo;s death is an indicator that the show was supposed to end.</p>
<p>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</p>
<p>Release Date   March 10, 1997    Cast   Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters    Genres   Action , Comedy , Drama , Horror , Supernatural    Seasons   7    Story By   joss whedon    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney+</p>
<p>Low ratings led Joss Whedon to believe that season 5 would be the last for Buffy Summers (via Vulture). Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 5&rsquo;s ending gives Buffy a heroic sacrificial death, seemingly bringing her story to an end. However, the show was moved from WB to UPN and continued for another two seasons. Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 6 is divisive, primarily because of Buffy having an abusive relationship with Spike. Problematic storylines have led people to argue that Buffy the Vampire Slayer would have been better off ending after season 5.</p>
<p>7  Once Upon A Time (2011-2018)
Once Upon a Time carried on longer than it should have.</p>
<p>Once Upon A Time</p>
<p>Release Date   October 3, 2011    Cast   Ginnifer Goodwin , josh dallas , Lana Parrilla , Robert Carlyle , Jennifer Morrison , Jared Gilmore    Genres   Romance , Fantasy , Adventure    Seasons   7    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Story By   adam horowitz</p>
<p>Despite the showrunners believing they would be cancelled after season 1 (via Variety), ABC&rsquo;s Once Upon a Time lasted for seven seasons. While ABC eagerly picked up the failed Once Upon a Time in Wonderland spinoff in 2013, they turned down Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis&rsquo; proposed Epic spinoff in 2021, demonstrating a loss of interest. The main show&rsquo;s introduction of characters from classic literature and modern Disney movies, including Elsa, Anna, Dr. Jekyll, and Mr. Hyde, indicated that the writers were running out of fairy tales to use. Season 7 even introduces a plot element that allows new versions of already established characters such as Cinderella to appear.</p>
<p>6  Friday Night Lights (2006-2011)
Friday Night Lights was renewed because of an intense fan campaign.</p>
<p>Friday Night Lights</p>
<p>Release Date   October 3, 2006    Cast   Taylor Kitsch , Jesse Plemons , Kyle Chandler , Connie Britton    Genres   Sports    Seasons   5    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , Hulu , Apple TV+    Story By   Peter Berg</p>
<p>Friday Night Lights, inspired by H.G. Bissinger&rsquo;s nonfiction novel Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, follows the trials and tribulations of a high school football team in a fictional town in rural Texas. Low ratings put the show in danger of cancellation due to low ratings after season 2. Fans rallied, some of whom sent NBC’s Entertainment director Ben Silverman broken light bulbs with the words “Light On” written on the side (via Vulture). NBC subsequently struck a deal with DirecTV to co-produce three more seasons of Friday Night Lights, and the show ended after season 5.</p>
<p>5  Parks And Recreation (2006-2015)
The showrunners believed Parks &amp; Rec would be cancelled several times.</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation</p>
<p>Release Date   April 9, 2009    Cast   Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&rsquo;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe    Seasons   7    Story By   Michael Schur, Michael offerman    Streaming Service(s)   fuboTV , Peacock    Genres   Sitcom , Comedy , Mockumentary</p>
<p>Creator Michael Shur wrote several seasons of Parks and Recreation believing it would be the show&rsquo;s last (via Entertainment Weekly). Parks &amp; Rec struggled with low ratings and often being compared to The Office in its early days. The writers believing that they needed to end the show on a high note led to some of its biggest moments appearing earlier than they might have otherwise, including Andy and April&rsquo;s wedding and Leslie and Ben&rsquo;s wedding. Yet Parks &amp; Rec managed to pull through several times before the show finally concluded with season 7.</p>
<p>4  Star Trek: The Original Series (1966-1969)
The influential sci-fi TV series was saved from cancellation by fans.</p>
<p>Star Trek: The Next Generation</p>
<p>Release Date   September 28, 1987    Cast   Patrick Stewart , Marina Sirtis , Brent Spiner , Jonathan Frakes , LeVar Burton , Wil Wheaton    Seasons   7    Story By   Gene Roddenberry    Streaming Service(s)   Amazon Prime Video    Genres    Sci-Fi , Superhero , Drama , Action</p>
<p>Gene Roddenberry kicked off one of the most famous sci-fi franchises in history with Star Trek: The Original Series, following the adventures of the original Enterprise crew. The show was cancelled after only two seasons, causing fans to write letters to NBC executives arguing for the show&rsquo;s renewal (via Vox). They were successful and Stark Trek got one more season. While Star Trek probably still would have influenced sci-fi movies and TV shows with only two seasons, it is remarkable that fans get to enjoy the third season.</p>
<p>3  Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013-2021)
Brooklyn Nine-Nine was also saved by a social media campaign.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</p>
<p>Release Date   September 17, 2013    Cast   Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio    Seasons   8    Story By   Michael Schur    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , Peacock    Genres   Comedy , Crime</p>
<p>Schur&rsquo;s other popular comedy series Brooklyn Nine-Nine focuses on a team of detectives of the fictional 99th Precinct of the NYPD. The show was cancelled after five seasons at Fox but was picked up by NBC following the fans&rsquo; #SaveBrooklyn99 campaign. Hulu and Netflix also appeared to be interested in the show at different points, but both decided not to pursue it (via Deadline). Brooklyn Nine-Nine continued for three more years for a total of eight seasons – Schur seems to be consistently lucky at avoiding cancellation.</p>
<p>2  Family Guy (1999-Present)
Family Guy was brought back two years after being cancelled.</p>
<p>Family Guy</p>
<p>Release Date   January 31, 1999    Cast   Seth MacFarlane , Alex Borstein , Seth Green , Lacey Chabert , Mila Kunis , Mike Henry , Patrick Warburton    Seasons   21    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu    Genres   Animation , Comedy    Showrunner   Seth MacFarlane</p>
<p>The long-running animated TV show Family Guy, following the now-iconic Griffin family, was cancelled twice. The first time was after the end of season 2, but Fox ordered an additional 13 episodes shortly after. It was then cancelled &ldquo;for good&rdquo; after season 3. However, Family Guy remained incredibly popular and its DVD sales were extremely profitable, leading to the series&rsquo; revival two years later. It is astounding that Family Guy comprises more than 20 seasons today when it had such a rocky start.</p>
<p>10 TV Shows That Were Shockingly Canceled After Being Renewed
From GLOW to A League Of Their Own and The Peripheral, some TV shows were shockingly canceled despite having been renewed for a new season.</p>
<p>1  Friends (1994-2004)
The Friends showrunners thought both season 8 and 9 were the end.</p>
<p>Friends</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 1994    Cast   Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer    Seasons   10    Story By   Marta Kauffman    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Sitcom    Showrunner   Marta Kauffman    Where To Watch   Max</p>
<p>As Friends started to wind down, the writers were taking things one season at a time. According to Friends co-creator David Crane (via radiotimes.com),
&ldquo;When we were doing the eighth season, we were told, &lsquo;This is the end.&rsquo; And then they negotiated another season, so we’re in for nine. &ldquo;We were told at a certain point on nine that &lsquo;This is absolutely the last season&rsquo;. And then a week later, they came back and went, &lsquo;Well…&rsquo; And so we got to the 10th season and said, &lsquo;Let’s be really clear: we can’t keep not knowing where we’re going.&rsquo; So we knew, definitively, it was the last one.&rdquo;
An unexpected renewal might be a welcome surprise. However, in the case of the Friends writers, they wanted to know when the show would end, so they could properly wrap up all the storylines. Fans and showrunners alike will fight to save their favorite series – but should also say so when it is time to end things.</p>
