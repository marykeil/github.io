## Literature Review
Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies explains why returning to the series for its next Christmas special was a priority for his coming back.




Doctor Who showrunner Russell T. Davies has revealed why it was important to him that he come back to the series for its latest Christmas special. The episode, titled &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; is the first special to air on the holiday since 2017. It is also the first full episode for Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor, now with Davies in charge of the series.




Speaking on Doctor Who: Unleashed, Davies explained why it was important for him to come back as showrunner during Doctor Who season 14&#39;s Christmas special. He revealed how he believes the series benefits from the holiday specials, saying they fit the show because of how fun their stories end up being. Check out what Davies had to say below:


This was kind of like number one on my shopping list – Christmas Day. I literally went to the BBC saying, “Back on Christmas Day, thank you very much. Let’s have this.” I just think it suits Doctor Who. I think the stories are more fun. Any story with tinsel in it is better than a story without tinsel in it.



 How Does The Christmas Special Set Up Doctor Who Season 14? 
          

Despite appearing at the end of Doctor Who&#39;s 60th anniversary specials, the Fifteenth Doctor doesn&#39;t truly get a chance to shine until the latest Christmas special. The new episode showed him as a free spirit, though also protective of those he cares about. The special also introduced his companion, Ruby Sunday, who he saved as a baby, killing the Goblin King in the process.




In addition to setting up season 14&#39;s major heroes, the special introduced the mysterious character Mrs. Flood, a woman who knows about the Doctor and the TARDIS. She breaks the fourth wall at the end of the special, hinting at her importance as the season progresses. While it&#39;s unclear who she is just yet, the Christmas special indicates more about her will be revealed throughout the Fifteenth Doctor&#39;s run.

With the basis of the series now set up alongside a new mystery, Doctor Who season 14 is shaping up to be a unique introduction for Gatwa&#39;s Doctor. While it&#39;s unclear what his next adventures will bring, they will likely follow the same spirit as the Christmas special. This means there will never be a dull moment between the Doctor and Ruby on their many travels across time and space.



Doctor Who season 14 properly begins in May 2023, and will run for 8 episodes.
