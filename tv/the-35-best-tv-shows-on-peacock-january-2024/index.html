  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Peacock, NBCUniversal&rsquo;s streaming platform, is growing its library of exclusive content. Here are some of the best TV series the service has to offer.</p>
<p>One of many newcomers to the streaming scene, NBCUniversal&rsquo;s Peacock has already established itself as a major force in the industry after launching in 2020. The streaming platform contains an impressive selection of Universal properties, rivaling other brand-exclusive streaming content such as the many originals of rivals Netflix, Disney+, and Max. As such, the best TV shows on Peacock rank among the most sought-after series, especially when it comes to comedies (although Peacock has many great shows across multiple genres, including dramas, mysteries, and sci-fi).
Peacock has two tiers of payment: the first level is Premium, which gives subscribers access to the full Peacock library but still contains ads. In order to get an ad-free experience, subscribers must pay for Peacock Premium Plus, a model that resembles Hulu&rsquo;s tiered plan. The service has already become the only place to watch classic shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation, and though well-known titles like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and Superstore are available on other platforms, newly aired episodes of NBC shows will premiere on Peacock the day after their cable debut. All this means that Peacock has a lot of quality shows to offer TV fans, making sorting the best from the rest no easy task. Here are the best TV shows currently available on Peacock.
For more TV streaming recommendations, be sure to check out the best TV shows on Paramount+ and the best TV shows on Netflix.</p>
<p>New On Peacock: All 91 Movies &amp; TV Shows Arriving In January
NBC Universal&rsquo;s streaming service Peacock offers a wide variety of movies, TV shows, and even live events, with much more arriving every month.</p>
<p>Best Comedy TV Shows On Peacock
Bupkis (2023-Present)</p>
<p>Bupkis</p>
<p>Release Date   May 4, 2023    Cast   Pete Davidson , Edie Falco , Joe Pesci , Philip Ettinger , Ray Romano , Steve Buscemi    Seasons   1</p>
<p>In the same vein as Larry David&rsquo;s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Bupkis is a fictional account of Pete Davidson&rsquo;s life, and it chronicles the young comedian moving back to his Staten Island home while building his comedy career and dealing with family tragedy. While critics have pointed out that Davidson playing himself isn&rsquo;t entirely original (he also starred in another semi-autobiographical work, 2020&rsquo;s The King of Staten Island), his chemistry with the stellar supporting cast makes Bupkis worth a watch.

Scrubs (2001-2010)</p>
<p>Scrubs</p>
<p>Release Date   October 1, 2001    Cast   John C. McGinley , Robert Maschio , Donald Faison , Christa Miller , Neil Flynn , Judy Reyes , Aloma Wright , Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Sam Lloyd , Ken Jenkins    Seasons   9</p>
<p>Most medical shows tend to be intense dramas like Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy or Chicago Med, but sitcom Scrubs finds humor in its hospital setting. Dr. John Michael &ldquo;J.D.&rdquo; Dorian (Zach Braff) begins the series as a new intern at Sacred Heart Hospital, and most episodes center around his wacky day-to-day interactions with his co-workers and patients.
What sets Scrubs apart from other workplace sitcoms is the recurring device of J.D.&rsquo;s daydreams, adding an almost surreal type of comedy to the already hilarious show. Scrubs&rsquo; high quality attracted a number of A-list actor guest-stars, from Brendan Fraser to Colin Farrell, and whether a famous face pops up or not, this medical sitcom is definitely worth a watch.</p>

Modern Family (2009 - 2020)</p>
<p>Modern Family</p>
<p>Release Date   September 23, 2009    Seasons   11</p>
<p>A classic example of the mockumentary, Modern Family follows a large dysfunctional family as its members navigate every stage of life. The audience gets to watch the kids grow up, understand sibling banter, and see heart-to-heart talks between parents and children of all generations that are always full of heart and humor. The show successfully navigates the delicate balance between multiple competing storylines and characters, giving everyone the chance to enjoy the spotlight. Its 22 Emmy wins (and 85 nominations) are a testament to the series&rsquo; success and status as a modern comedy classic.
Watch On Peacock
The Office (2005 - 2013)</p>
<p>The Office</p>
<p>Release Date   March 24, 2005    Cast   Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski    Seasons   9</p>
<p>In an unequivocal display of intent, NBCUniversal withheld the exclusive streaming rights to The Office once they expired on Netflix. Now, one of Netflix&rsquo;s most-watched television shows ever is only available to watch on Peacock – a major draw for potential subscribers. The streaming service heavily advertised its acquirement for good reason.
Over 15 years after its debut, The Office is still ingrained in pop culture for widely popularizing the single-camera, mockumentary style that influenced later sitcoms, such as Modern Family. Many of the most successful modern comedy series owes a debt to The Office, underlining its status as one of the best TV shows on Peacock.

Superstore (2015 - 2021)</p>
<p>Superstore</p>
<p>Release Date   November 30, 2015    Cast   Ben Feldman , Nichole Sakura , Colton Dunn , Nico Santos , America Ferrera , Mark McKinney , Lauren Ash , Kaliko Kauahi    Seasons   6</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever worked in retail or shopped in a store can appreciate Superstore, as it’s a rare workplace comedy where even the most exaggerated storylines feel true to life. On the surface, each of the characters seems to fall into two-dimensional comedic stereotypes, yet it soon becomes clear that both the protagonists and the series as a whole are much more nuanced than they appear.
Offering thoughtful explorations of different relationships that define the workplace – both romantic and friendly – Superstore is an extremely relatable show from start to finish. It might not be exclusive to Peacock, but it’s definitely one of the best casts of sitcom characters the streamer has to offer.

<p>The 30 Best Movies On Peacock (January 2024)
Peacock has a wide variety of movies available to stream, with popular, award-winning, and genre-defining films in any genre a cinephile could want.</p>
<p>Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist (2020 - 2021)</p>
<p>Zoey&rsquo;s Extraordinary Playlist</p>
<p>Release Date   January 7, 2020    Cast   Mary Steenburgen , John Clarence Stewart , Jane Levy , Skylar Astin , Michael Thomas Grant , Alex Newell , Peter Gallagher , Alice Lee , Andrew Leeds , Kapil Talwalkar    Seasons   2</p>
<p>An inventive and quirky comedy, Zoey&rsquo;s Extraordinary Playlist is an extremely original take on the musical. The series&rsquo; titular character, played by Jane Levy, begins to hear people’s innermost thoughts and emotions, but not by reading their minds. Instead, Zoey&rsquo;s insights manifest as though she were participating in a bizarre psychosomatic musical performance.
It’s a unique premise for a show, and other series that have used similar ideas have only followed the concept for occasional standalone episodes. Here, it’s a lasting conceit that made the cancelation of the show truly heartbreaking for the audience – making its availability on Peacock a welcome relief.

New Girl (2011-2018)</p>
<p>New Girl</p>
<p>Cast   Zooey Deschanel , Max Greenfield , Hannah Simone , Damon Wayans Jr. , Lamorne Morris , Jake Johnson    Seasons   7    Writers   Elizabeth Meriwether</p>
<p>A bona fide comedy hit that only grew in confidence and creative scope with each season, New Girl was one of the most popular sitcoms on television when it was originally on the air. Deschanel stars as a young woman who moves in with three guys she finds on the internet after her boyfriend cheats on her.
Though the characters in New Girl are all in their 30s over the course of the sitcom, the show is ultimately about growing up as they all enter serious relationships, have kids, and play many rowdy games of True American. New Girl earned five Primetime Emmy nominations and five Golden Globe nominations during its run and remains wildly popular years after its finale.

30 Rock (2006 - 2013)</p>
<p>30 Rock</p>
<p>Release Date   October 11, 2006    Cast   Tina Fey , Alec Baldwin , Tracy Morgan , Jane Krakowski , Jack McBrayer , Scott Adsit , Judah Friedlander , Katrina Bowden , Keith Powell , Lonny Ross    Genres   Comedy , Satire    Seasons   7</p>
<p>A uniquely chaotic look at the behind-the-scenes dramas that plague TV production, 30 Rock is a unique and hilarious comedy classic. Loosely based on the real-life world of SNL, 30 Rock follows a fictional show&rsquo;s stars and producers as they juggle massive egos and misadventures from the other side of the camera. One of the best TV shows about making a TV show,
30 Rock is a loving lampoon of the SNL institution, with the real experience of key players like Tina Fey only adding to the authenticity. With a standout cast that includes Jane Krakowski, Tracy Morgan, and Alec Baldwin, 30 Rock is rightly considered a classic

Parks And Recreation (2009 - 2015)</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation</p>
<p>Release Date   April 9, 2009    Cast   Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&rsquo;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Exclusively available on Peacock, Parks and Recreation built on the success of The Office before establishing itself as a comedy great in its own right. Following the fictional employees of the Parks Department in rural Indiana, the series is extremely rewatchable thanks to its comforting, easygoing humor. Parks and Rec brims with optimism, its characters growing into supportive and empathetic people while they work within the confines of local government bureaucracy. Beloved for its sweetly silly sense of humor, Parks and Rec provides some welcome light relief in what can be a cynical TV landscape.

<p>All 62 Movies &amp; TV Shows Leaving Peacock This Month
The NBC/Universal affiliated streaming service Peacock features a revolving door of great shows and movies. Here&rsquo;s everything leaving January 2024.</p>
<p>Saturday Night Live (1975 - )</p>
<p>Saturday Night Live</p>
<p>Release Date   October 11, 1975    Cast   Leslie Jones , Aidy Bryant , Kyle Mooney , Alex Moffat , Kate McKinnon , Beck Bennett , Kenan Thompson , Colin Jost , Mikey Day , Cecily Strong , Michael Che , Pete Davidson , Melissa Villaseñor    Genres   Music , Comedy    Seasons   48</p>
<p>As is to be expected, given its improvisational premise, Saturday Night Live has had its ups and downs throughout its 46-year history. However, what&rsquo;s beyond doubt is that the show&rsquo;s highs rank among the most influential comedy ever produced.
The fact that the entire show is available on Peacock means that fans can see everything from Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s original &ldquo;Mister Robinson&rsquo;s Neighborhood&rdquo; sketches to Mike Meyers&rsquo; &ldquo;Wayne&rsquo;s World&rdquo; skits to the original 1975 cast that included Dan Akroyd, John Belushi, and Chevy Chase. While SNL hasn&rsquo;t always hit the mark, it remains a tentpole for American comedy that has shaped the genre for decades.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013 - 2021)
Brooklyn Nine-Nine</p>
<p>Release Date   September 17, 2013    Cast   Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio    Seasons   8</p>
<p>A sitcom instead of a police procedural, Brooklyn Nine-Nine goes a long way in making TV detectives more than two-dimensional grizzled puzzle solvers. Here, the characters are allowed to be as vibrant and eccentric as they would be in other workplace comedies – the difference being that the workplace just happens to be a police station. The show also has some great central relationship storylines, Halloween heists, and some of the best cold opens in television history. Its availability on Peacock is a great incentive to subscribe to the platform.

Based On A True Story (2023-Present)</p>
<p>Based on a True Story</p>
<p>Release Date   June 8, 2023    Cast   Kaley Cuoco , Chris Messina , Tom Bateman , Liana Liberato , Natalia Dyer , Priscilla Quintana    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Part thriller, part hilariously dark black comedy, Based on a True Story&rsquo;s unique premise takes a subversive look at the true crime craze that&rsquo;s dominated the past decade. Cuoco and Messina play a married couple who come up with an idea for a true-crime podcast that will see them unmask a dangerous serial killer. Although its concept is gruesome, Based on a True Story is frequently hilarious, drawing great comedy from its farcical premise. Following in the footsteps of hit shows such as Only Murders In The Building, Based on a True Story is a welcome addition to an ever-popular genre.

The Continental: From The World Of John Wick (2023-Present)</p>
<p>The Continental</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 2023    Cast   Jessica Allain , Colin Woodell , Hubert Point-Du Jour , Nhung Kate , Ben Robson , Mel Gibson , Mishel Prada , Jeremy Bobb , Peter Greene , Ayomide Adegun    Seasons   1</p>
<p>What started off as a low-budget action movie evolved into one of cinema&rsquo;s biggest franchises, as John Wick has achieved staggering success. While the film series thus far has centered around Keanu Reeves&rsquo; dog-loving hitman, The Continental: From the World of John Wick is the origin story of the eponymous hotel, which is a safe haven for assassins as no &ldquo;work&rdquo; is permitted on its grounds.
Taking place in 1970s New York, The Continental incorporates real-life events into its story as the young Winston Scott (Colin Woodell) rises to power. While The Continental doesn&rsquo;t meet the level of John Wick&rsquo;s gun-fu magic, newcomers will still enjoy the extended action sequences while established fans will appreciate the franchise&rsquo;s expanded world-building.

<p>Perhaps one of the most watchable legal dramas released in recent years, Suits&rsquo; sharp script and colorful cast of characters have made it a smash hit. The show follows Mike Ross, a legal associate who talks his way into the profession by making use of his photographic memory. He is then taken under the wing of self-proclaimed &ldquo;best closer in the city&rdquo; Harvey Specter, with the show chronicling the pair&rsquo;s adventures. Boasting slick writing and a flair for unexpected drama, Suits remains popular four years after its finale.

<p>Does Peacock Have Live TV? Here&rsquo;s Everything You Need To Know
Peacock has countless on-demand movies and TV shows available to watch. But does the streaming app also have live TV? Let&rsquo;s dive in and find out.</p>
<p>Vikings (2013-2020)</p>
<p>Vikings</p>
<p>Release Date   March 3, 2013    Cast   Travis Fimmel , Katheryn Winnick , Gustaf Skarsgård , Jessalyn Gilsig , Clive Standen , George Blagden    Seasons   6</p>
<p>While Game of Thrones may be the most popular medieval show of the 2010s, if not ever, Vikings holds its own. Premiering in 2013, Vikings tells the story of Norse warrior Ragnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel), who goes from farmer to King of the Vikings. Like Game of Thrones, Vikings is known for its graphic violence, though it never feels gratuitous, as these scenes always serve the story. Vikings is also based on real events, so history buffs in particular will get so much more out of it than just an entertaining show.

One Chicago Franchise (2012-)</p>
<p>One Chicago</p>
<p>First TV Show   Chicago Fire    Cast   Jesse Spencer , Taylor Kinney , Monica Raymund , Jason Beghe , Jon Seda , Sophia Bush , Jesse Lee Soffer , Nick Gehlfuss , Yaya DaCosta , Torrey DeVitto , Rachel DiPillo , Philip Winchester , Joelle Carter , Monica Barbaro , Carl Weathers , Yuri Sardarov    TV Show(s)   Chicago Fire , Chicago P.D. , Chicago Med , Chicago Justice    Created by   Derek Haas , Michael Brandt</p>
<p>A trilogy of shows that takes a close look at life on the frontline of the Windy City&rsquo;s emergency services, the Chicago franchise is an ambitious, multi-series story. Starting with Chicago Fire in 2012 before expanding to Chicago PD and Chicago Med, each series is a procedural in a particular department, following the lives of the people who work there and the cases they take on.
The shows all intersect with each other, sharing characters and arcs across the wider narrative. As a result, these first-responder dramas offer a uniquely comprehensive look at the field and are an incredibly immersive experience for the viewer.

Yellowstone (2018-Present)</p>
<p>Yellowstone</p>
<p>Release Date   June 20, 2018    Cast   Finn Little , Brecken Merrill , Gil Birmingham , Denim Richards , Ian Bohen , Danny Huston , Kelly Reilly , Forrie J. Smith , Cole Hauser , Kelsey Asbille , Wes Bentley , Jefferson White , Kevin Costner , Luke Grimes , Ryan Bingham    Seasons   4</p>
<p>This sleeper-hit Western drama about a family of ranchers who face encroaching forces seeking to take over their property has proven to be the perfect showcase for creator Taylor Sheridan. The premiere episode was the most-watched debut for any series on the Paramount Network, including under its former Spike name, and in 2018 Yellowstone was the most-watched scripted show on basic cable.
Sheridan, critically acclaimed writer of the thrillers Sicario and Hell or High Water, and John Linson of Sons of Anarchy fame are both no strangers to the Western genre, yet it is in Yellowstone where the pair&rsquo;s gritty sensibilities and eye for compelling character development are given the greatest opportunity to shine.

The Law &amp; Order Franchise (Various)</p>
<p>One of the most popular and long-running cop procedural media franchises, Law &amp; Order has a chunk of its most prominent material available to watch on Peacock. This includes the last eight seasons of the original Law &amp; Order&rsquo;s 20-season run, the past 21 seasons of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, and all 10 seasons of Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent.
Famous for its gritty, uncompromising view of police work, the franchise has become such an enduring part of pop culture that many more contemporary police procedurals still fail to escape its shadow.

<p>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air might have been a family sitcom in the ‘90s, but Peacock has successfully reimagined the Will Smith show as a drama for the modern day. In it, Will (Banks) is still sent to live with his uncle’s family when he gets into trouble – much like the original show – but the storylines are more serious with fewer moments of levity. Incorporating elements of crime drama that weren’t in the original, Bel-Air has become one of Peacock’s most-watched original shows for its updated spin on some much-loved source material.

<p>15 Best Documentaries On Peacock
Peacock is a fantastic place for streaming documentaries - and these are some of the most influential, that everyone should see.</p>
<p>A Friend Of The Family (2022)</p>
<p>A Friend of the Family</p>
<p>Release Date   October 6, 2022    Cast   Jake Lacy , Anna Paquin , Colin Hanks , Mckenna Grace , Maggie Sonnier , Lio Tipton    Genres   Biography , Drama , Crime    Seasons   1</p>
<p>The truth is stranger — and more disturbing — than fiction in A Friend of the Family. Based on real events, the Peacock miniseries tells the shocking tale of the charismatic Robert Berchtold (Jake Lacy) and his unhealthy obsession with the daughter of his friends and neighbors, Jan Broberg (Hendrix Yancey and Mckenna Grace). This obsession leads to Berchtold kidnapping and assaulting Jan multiple times throughout the 1970s.
Lacy has built a career out of playing &ldquo;nice guy&rdquo; roles, and in A Friend of the Family, he presents a twisted take on that persona, using his natural charms to show how someone like Berchtold was able to get away with his crimes for so long. Between this miniseries and his character in The White Lotus, Lacy shows how dangerous privilege can be when given to the wrong people. Not every viewer will be able to stomach A Friend of the Family, but those who can will find a fascinating character study.

Heartland (2007-Present)</p>

<p>Release Date   October 14, 2007    Cast   Amber Marshall , Michelle Morgan , Shaun Johnston , Chris Potter , Kerry James , Gabriel Hogan , Aidan Moreno , Jessica Steen    Seasons   17</p>
<p>Long-running Canadian drama Heartland could be described as a lower-stakes version of Yellowstone, as the show is also named after the titular family ranch, though this series takes place in Alberta. It centers on the Fleming family, specifically sisters Amy and Lou, as they deal with the day-to-day challenges of ranch life while healing old familial wounds and growing closer. Heartland has 17 seasons to its name (14 are available on Peacock), which speaks to the enduring love that fans have for this wholesome, family show. Those looking to vicariously live out their Western dreams without the violence of Yellowstone will get a lot of out Heartland.

<p>One of Peacock&rsquo;s newest additions to its original programming, Dr. Death is a bone-chilling twist on the true-crime format that subs in medical professionals in place of law enforcement. Joshua Jackson stars as Dr. Christopher Duntsch, a twisted neurosurgeon who goes on a malpractice rampage in the halls of the hospitals that are inattentive and neglectful enough to employ him. The show is based on the critically acclaimed podcast of the same name and deftly depicts the malignant incompetency of both Duntsch and medical-legal bureaucracy.

<p>Release Date   November 16, 2004    Cast   Olivia Wilde , Jesse Spencer , Lisa Edelstein    Genres   Drama    Seasons   8</p>
<p>A vehicle for Hugh Laurie&rsquo;s powerhouse performance in the title role, House is a gripping mystery-of-the-week thriller revolving around seemingly impossible medical cases. When patients present symptoms that don’t make sense to other doctors, House and his team track down exactly what illness is causing it, even if they have to go through all the belongings in the person’s house to figure it out.
House himself is cantankerous and even outright mean, yet his brilliant mind and acerbic wit make him a charismatic antihero. While the show is arguably much more cynical than many other medical dramas, House is often blackly funny and successfully stands out from the crowd.

<p>Best Sci-Fi TV Shows On Peacock</p>
<p>Heroes (2006-2010)</p>
<p>Heroes</p>
<p>Release Date   September 25, 2006    Cast   Hayden Panettiere , Santiago Cabrera , Jack Coleman , Tawny Cypress , Noah Gray-Cabey , Greg Grunberg , Masi Oka , Adrian Pasdar , Milo Ventimiglia , Zachary Quinto    Seasons   4</p>
<p>“Save the cheerleader, save the world,” has become Heroes&rsquo;s most enduring contribution to pop culture, yet the show made many more significant contributions to sci-fi television than this single line. The first season of the series remains one of the best and most intriguing debuts in decades, expertly blending multiple storylines and setting up a potentially thrilling saga.
A Writers Guild of America strike in the middle of season 2 famously meant the creative team had to tie up loose ends quicker than they liked, and the decisions made there impacted the remainder of the series. Despite that, Heroes&rsquo; central concept, of an event around the world causing sudden manifestations of superpowers, made for a great jumping-off point for the show and one of the great &ldquo;what could have been&rdquo; series in television.

Mrs. Davis (2023-)</p>
<p>Mrs. Davis</p>
<p>Release Date   April 20, 2023    Cast   Betty Gilpin , Jake McDorman , Margo Martindale , Andy McQueen , Ben Chaplin , David Arquette , Elizabeth Marvel , Chris Diamantopoulos    Seasons   1</p>
<p>A satirical look at the age-old debate between science and religion, Mrs. Davis is a gleefully entertaining sci-fi comedy. Gilpin stars as Sister Simone, a nun on a one-woman mission to battle artificial intelligence. Despite its singularly bizarre premise, Mrs. Davis never descends into total chaos. Instead, the show pushes its ridiculous comedy to the limit, keeping its characters relatable throughout. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the show boasts an impressive 91% on Rotten Tomatoes, making it one of the best TV shows on Peacock.

The Vampire Diaries (2009-2017)</p>
<p>The Vampire Diaries</p>
<p>Cast   Nina Dobrev , Ian Somerhalder , Steven R. McQueen , Paul Wesley , Kat Graham , Michael Trevino , Michael Malarkey , Zach Roerig , Candice King , Matthew Davis    Seasons   8    Writers   Julie Plec , Kevin Williamson , L.J. Smith</p>
<p>Teen romance meets the supernatural in The Vampire Diaries. The show centers on Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), an orphaned teenage girl living in Mythic Falls, Virginia, who finds herself the object of vampire brothers Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon Salvatore&rsquo;s (Ian Somerhalder) affection. While the central love triangle was an engrossing storyline, The Vampire Diaries also shines with its supporting characters, be they Elena&rsquo;s high school friends or memorable wicked villains. The series was so popular that it spawned two spinoffs, The Originals and Legacies, that are both worth watching, though they don&rsquo;t quite capture the magic of the original.</p>

<p>Merlin</p>
<p>Release Date   September 20, 2008    Cast   Colin Morgan , Bradley James , Katie McGrath , Anthony Head , Richard Wilson , John Hurt , Nathaniel Parker    Seasons   5</p>
<p>This new twist on the legend of King Arthur places the focus on Merlin (Mogan) instead of the legendary monarch. The show follows Merlin’s training as he disobeys an edict from Camelot, learning about medicine and magic despite such practices being outlawed. Merlin also follows Morgana’s (McGrath) turn to become an antagonist for Arthur, though she certainly doesn’t begin her story that way. A fascinating take on a well-known legend, Merlin was essential Saturday night viewing during its initial run.

Set after the end of the Second World War, the series sees the women use their code-breaking skills to solve a series of gruesome murders.

Monk (2002-2009)</p>
<p>Monk</p>
<p>Release Date   July 12, 2002    Cast   Tony Shalhoub    Seasons   8</p>
<p>A gently comedic mystery show revolving Tony Shalhoub&rsquo;s eccentric detective, Monk is perhaps underappreciated for a show that ran for eight seasons. The series follows Adrian Monk (Shalhoub), who used to be on the San Francisco police force until his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder got in the way of his career. The series sees him as a consultant for the force as he goes to treatment for his OCD. While he’s busy putting the puzzle pieces together for murder cases on a weekly basis, he also tries to take steps toward managing his OCD with the help of his assistant, as well as working on his wife’s unsolved murder case.
Over the course of its run, Monk won eight Primetime Emmys and Shalhoub was consistently nominated for the Screen Actor’s Guild’s Best Actor. Funny, moving, and genuinely intriguing, Monk is one of the best TV shows on Peacock.

Poker Face (2023-Present)</p>
<p>Poker Face</p>
<p>Release Date   January 26, 2023    Cast   Natasha Lyonne , Adrien Brody , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Stephanie Hsu , David Castaneda , Benjamin Bratt    Seasons   1</p>
<p>A modern mystery series that&rsquo;s the perfect conduit for creator Rian Johnson&rsquo;s signature style of storytelling, Poker Face is one of the best original shows to debut on Peacock. Natasha Lyonne stars as Charlie, a woman who can always tell when others are lying – a unique skill that gets her into trouble, but it also means that she’s able to see through the lies people feed her to unravel mysteries other people can’t. Lyonne’s performance drives the show just as it did in her previous series, Russian Doll. Coupled with Knives Out creator Johnson&rsquo;s clear passion for the genre, Poker Face makes the most of its clever central conceit.

Murder, She Wrote (1984 - 1996)</p>
<p>Murder, She Wrote</p>
<p>Release Date   January 1, 1984    Cast   Angela Lansbury    Seasons   12</p>
<p>Like Columbo, the quotable Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) is considered one of the best TV detectives of all time. Whereas Columbo’s movie-length mysteries were a touch harder-edged, Mrs. Fletcher&rsquo;s were considered “cozy” murder mysteries thanks to her living in a small New England town and writing murder mysteries about her experiences.
There’s no profanity, no gore, and rarely foul language, and yet Murder, She Wrote somehow manages to be a warm and fuzzy series that makes the audience feel good while they watch a woman solve murders. Lansbury was nominated for 10 Golden Globes (winning four) and 12 Emmys during the run of the show.

Psych (2006 - 2014)</p>
<p>Psych</p>
<p>Release Date   July 7, 2006    Cast   Dule Hill , Kirsten Nelson , Corbin Bernsen , James Roday , Maggie Lawson , Anne Dudek , Timothy Omundson    Seasons   8</p>
<p>This cult comedy series about Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his best friend Gus solving crimes together was one of Peacock&rsquo;s first major acquirements upon the service&rsquo;s launch. Psych centers around Spencer, a detective with a near-super-powered photographic memory who uses his gift to convince people that he is actually psychic.
Creator Steve Franks has brought his characters back to television screens in movie form. Psych 2: Lassie Come Home was available to watch on Peacock&rsquo;s launch day and was undoubtedly a major incentive for those who followed the show to subscribe. A third film, giving Gus (Dulé Hill) the spotlight, also premiered on Peacock, yet it is the original series that set the standard.

<p>Release Date   October 28, 2011    Cast   David Giuntoli , Russell Hornsby , Silas Weir Mitchell    Seasons   6</p>
<p>A blend of police procedural, fantasy drama, and full-blown horror, Grimm takes classic fairytale inspiration and reinterprets the source material into something completely new. The show follows homicide detective Nicholas Burkhardt, who discovers that he is part of a long-line of monster-hunting Grimms, destined to maintain the balance between humanity and a range of mythological creatures. With a complex and enthralling mythology, Grimm is an often-scary fantasy monster series that&rsquo;s perfect for fans of the likes of Supernatural.

<p>Release Date   October 12, 2021    Cast   Zackary Arthur , Brad Dourif , Alyvia Alyn Lind , Teo Briones , Björgvin Arnarson , Alex Vincent , Jennifer Tilly , Christine Elise , Billy Boyd    Seasons   3</p>
<p>While it can be difficult to execute an effective horror concept on television, Chucky benefits from drawing on the mythology of the much-loved Child&rsquo;s Play series. The show features cast members from the original movies as well as new faces to tell a whole new story that also connects with existing lore. Chucky is a great love letter to fans of the renowned murderous children’s toy, but even those who haven’t seen every Child&rsquo;s Play movie in the franchise can watch the show without being completely lost. This delicate balancing act makes the Chucky TV series reimagining one of the best shows available on Peacock.
