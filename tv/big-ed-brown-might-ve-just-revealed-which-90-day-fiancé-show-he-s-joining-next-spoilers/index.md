## Literature Review
Amid breakup rumors with Liz Woods, Big Ed Brown unintentionally reveals which 90 Day Fiancé franchise spin-off he&#39;s going to appear in next.




WARNING! This article contains spoilers for 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? Season 8!




Big Ed Brown from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise seemingly confirmed his appearance in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 8. The controversial reality star last appeared on 90 Day: The Last Resort with Liz Woods. The couple revealed their relationship issues in the therapy-oriented spin-off, suggesting they would be better off without each other. However, Ed worked on his immature behavior and proved to Liz that he could be a great partner to her. Eventually, Ed and Liz left the resort as an engaged couple while briefly discussing their plans to move to Arkansas.

Recently, Ed went live on his Instagram and answered some of his fans’ questions. He discussed many things about himself, including his potential return. While replying to one of the social media users who asked, “What’s the new show called?” Ed claimed he and Liz would return to TV very soon.


 




He said that the show will air sometime in March 2024, but he “can’t tell” the fans the exact name yet. Since 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 8 is the only spin-off premiering in March 2024, he’s likely talking about that show.

Ed also shared about his experiences since moving to Arkansas but didn’t reveal his current relationship status with Liz. When a social media user asked if he was “married yet,” Ed swerved away from the question. He said, “You gotta watch the show,” implying that 90 Day Fiancé viewers will get the answer in the upcoming spin-off. Later in his Instagram Live session, Ed flirted with a female fan and told her, “I gotta leave because I don’t want to fall in love with you.” He then admitted that Liz “wouldn’t like that at all,” hinting he was still with her.

Ed has leaked his potential return to the 90 Day Fiancé franchise without realizing it. He probably underestimated the fans and thought they didn’t know the complete schedule of forthcoming shows. In 2024, viewers will see many 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs, two of which are already confirmed. There’s 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, which premieres on January 4. Soon after that, there’s Happily Ever After? season 8, which begins airing March 17. Since the latter is the only spin-off coming in March, that&#39;s likely the only show Ed can join.

In March 2024, Ed will seemingly return to the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. However, it won&#39;t be his first time on the spin-off. Previously, Ed was in Happily Ever After? season 7 with Liz. At the time, he was navigating his post-engagement issues with her. If the latest rumors are true and Ed married Liz after 90 Day: The Last Resort, he’s likely returning to the spin-off in March to share his post-wedding journey. Ed and Liz are in different facets of their lives and aren’t compatible. Their upcoming appearance may be the last time they appear in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
