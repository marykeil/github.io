# Dragon Ball s 10 Biggest Missed Opportunities


## SUMMARY 


 The original Dragon Ball had many opportunities to make Akira Toriyama&#39;s original series even better than it ended up being, but many story beats ended up being pushed to the side. 
 Many moments from early on in the series could have created a unique set of challenges for Goku as the series progressed, like him being unable to fight properly on an empty stomach, but was ultimately forgotten about. 
 Many key points in Goku and Bulma&#39;s friendship should have been developed more deeply, like her initially lying to him, and his adventures in trying to discover where she lives.

## Literature Review
Dragon Ball is iconic but there are actually many missed opportunities that could have made the series so much better than it already is.




Akira Toriyama&#39;s overall contribution to shonen can never be overstated, and Dragon Ball is the example every mangaka follows since it has either invented or popularized now well-established tropes and formulas in manga.
Most fans prefer the second part of the story, Dragon Ball Z,to the original series because it dialed down the humor and put more of an emphasis on fighting, but the classic Dragon Ball had plenty of great moments and storylines. Unfortunately, there were also many missed opportunities that, if given the proper development and time, could have made the original series leagues better.









 








 10  Dr. Slump &#34;Crossover&#34; Needs Closure 
A silly spin-off incorporating Toriyama&#39;s other work needed to be more developed
        

The inclusion of the Norimaki family from Akira Toriyama&#39;s Dr. Slump series in Dragon Ball&#39;s General Blue saga is probably one of the most complicated tie-in crossovers to ever randomly happen. Goku wouldn&#39;t have been able to continue looking for the Dragon Balls if Turbo didn&#39;t effortlessly fix Bulma&#39;s Dragon Ball with his telekinetic powers. More importantly, Goku would have most assuredly been killed if Arale hadn&#39;t been beaten up Blue. Although completely ridiculous and even unwarranted, the Norimaki family&#39;s overall importance to the plot demanded that Toriyama came back to them at least once in the manga. Failing to give this story a satisfying conclusion just made their involvement odder and out of place than they already were. Luckily, Dragon Ball Super later indirectly honored Dr. Slump.





 9  West City Could Have Been Its Own Epic Adventure 
Goku&#39;s search for Bulma&#39;s house should have been much more interesting
        

Most of Goku&#39;s travels during the overarching Red Ribbon Army saga felt like random wanderings. The most obvious of them occurs in chapter 68 when Goku is searching for where Bulma lives. He first wins money in a street fight and then almost gets mugged. Both of these incidents feel much too similar. Although the mugging was likely Toriyama&#39;s way of showing how crime-ridden city life can be, a much more complex scenario could have actually involved the police officer he meets in the manga arresting him for obtaining illegal money from the street fight.





 8  Dragon Ball Falsely Foreshadowed Capsule Corp Would Get Infiltrated 
An interesting story arc that never happened
        

In the very next chapter, Goku finally arrives at Capsule Corp just as the Red Ribbon Army begins discussing how Goku must have some sophisticated tech with him to track the Dragon Balls. This juxtaposition created the opportunity for the Red Ribbon Army to head for Capsule Corp and take Dr. Brief and his wife as hostages who aren&#39;t physically capable people. Instead, General Blue captures some of the most capable characters at the time on Roshi&#39;s island: a powerful martial artist and a woman who becomes a psychopath who&#39;s proficient in gunplay whenever she sneezes.





 7  Goku&#39;s &#34;I&#39;m Hungry&#34; Weakness 
His silly weakness early-on could have presented an interesting, ongoing challenge
        

Although Goku has some weaknesses and loses a few battles in Dragon Ball, he&#39;s still just too capable of a fighter, which minimizes the stakes of any battle he&#39;s involved in. Dragon Ball chapter 8 introduced a phenomenon that could have been a major weakness that plagued him throughout the series. When battling Yamcha for the first time, Goku complains about being too hungry and gets beaten up as a result. In fact, Goku would have lost if Yamcha didn&#39;t see Bulma a moment later and run away. The only other time when food (besides the Senzu Beans) helps Goku occurs much later, in chapter 136, but Goku had just been defeated by the Great Demon King Piccolo and was now facing off against one of Piccolo&#39;s minions.





 6  Another Aspect of the Nimbus Cloud Debate 
The cloud&#39;s to-the-point rules aren&#39;t so clear after all
        

One of the more appealing aspects of Dragon Ball that could have been more than it ended up being includes who exactly can ride the Nimbus Cloud. The only problem is that it only yields a binary answer. A character either is or isn&#39;t pure-hearted enough. The series presented an early opportunity for more possibilities when Goku could still carry those who weren&#39;t pure of heart while astride the Nimbus Cloud. But Goku could seemingly carry anyone, not just people that fit in the guidelines. Then, in chapter 104, Goku is hit by Spike the Devil Man&#39;s Devilmite Beam, which can kill a target who has negative thoughts. Of course, many readers assumed that Goku&#39;s ability to ride the Nimbus Cloud automatically made him immune. But Fortuneteller Baba, who was aware of Spike&#39;s Devilmite Beam, saw Goku riding the Nimbus Cloud beforehand and yet still came to the conclusion that the beam could kill Goku. This inconsistency is unfortunately, never explained.





 5  Dragon Ball Should&#39;ve Delved Into the Consequences of Destroying the Moon 
While the series touches on the aftermath, it deserved more
        

Many fans rightly complain that Dragon Ball doesn&#39;t present any consequences for Master Roshi destroying the moon to prevent Goku from transforming into a Great Ape. That said, Dragon Ball did explore one fall out that came as a result of Roshi&#39;s rather hastened actions, but it was so insignificant that it&#39;s understandable why most people forget about it. During one of the Strongest-Under-The-Heavens tournaments, Roshi battles against Man-Wolf, who has a major beef with him because – thanks to the moon getting destroyed – he&#39;s stuck in his wolf form and can&#39;t become a human. While a fun little story, the ramifications of Roshi destroying the moon shouldn&#39;t have been relegated to one minor match.





 4  The Best Dragon Ball Villains Got Totally Disrespected 
Promising antagonists should&#39;ve been given more love
        

The original Dragon Ball series had a villain problem. Complete jokes like Pilaf unfortunately persist, while the rest who were actually dastardly died too early – General Blue and Staff Officer Black – or defected to the good guys – Piccolo and Tien. Then, there are those like Mercenary Tao and Master Shen who have just been straight up disrespected despite their horrific deeds. Mercenary Tao murdered a child&#39;s father in front of him and Master Shen attempted to kill his former disciples once they went out on their own. And yet, their deaths were relegated to a guide called Dragon Ball Forever. It might have been published by Shueisha, but even the specifics of their deaths couldn&#39;t have been more disrespectfully ambiguous. Moreover, Mercenary Tao became a cyborg. He could have been a product of the Red Ribbon Army, but, alas, he&#39;s just a regular cyborg.





 3  Goku Almost Had To Pick Who To Resurrect 
Goku&#39;s do-gooder personality could have been more directly challenged
        

Dragon Ball unnecessarily circumvented a major conflict that could have provided further insight into Goku&#39;s relationship with Grandpa Gohan. Goku&#39;s final search for the Dragon Balls in the original series was spurred on by the death of Upa&#39;s father, whereby Goku promised to bring him back to life – which eventually culminated in a massive plot hole in DBZ. Things get complicated when Goku gets to see Gohan for one day. The conversation inevitably turns to resurrection in chapter 108 when Upa realizes that Goku could revive his grandpa even though he promised to bring his dad Bora back to life. But Gohan, of course, eliminates any and all potential conflict when he says that he would rather remain dead.





 2  Goku and Bulma Could Have Had A Major Falling Out 
Dragon Ball had the opportunity to flesh out the pair&#39;s relationship
        

When Goku was still a kid, his relationship with Bulma was undoubtedly his most important for a while and carried the most weight should something go awry. She was the first person he saw and interacted with after Grandpa Gohan died years earlier, so if she were ever to ever trick him, the betrayal would understandably have had a lasting impression on the small lad. Sadly, one of the first things she ever told him was a lie, and her deceit involved Goku&#39;s beloved four-star Dragon Ball. And yet, Goku just happened to forget her lie. Bulma implied that if Goku gave her the four-star Dragon Ball, she would be able to return it to him after she made her wish. But Goku doesn&#39;t remember this important little detail once Oolong makes Dragon Ball&#39;s most inappropriate wish, and Bulma doesn&#39;t act surprised when all the Dragon Balls disperse across the planet.





 1  Goku Experienced What It Was Like To Have A Mother 
Goku&#39;s complex backstory with his parents could have been explored ore thoroughly
        

Although Goku had his Grandpa Gohan, he didn&#39;t have a father or mother growing up. In fact, he didn&#39;t learn about his biological parents, Bardock and Gine, until recently in Dragon Ball Super. But in Dragon Ball chapter 57, he&#39;s cared for by a girl&#39;s mother at Jingle Village. She fusses over Goku so much that she even tells him directly that she doesn&#39;t mean to mother him, but she obviously can&#39;t help herself. It would have been powerful if Goku got closer to her or, at least, conveyed more of how he appreciated her mothering. Since Goku is destined to find more about Gine in Dragon Ball Super at some point, Super could have capitalized on Goku&#39;s relationship with that mother from Jingle Village in Dragon Ball once he inevitably gets more flashbacks of his parents, especially Gina.
