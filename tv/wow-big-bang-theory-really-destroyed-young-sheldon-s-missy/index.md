## Literature Review
Missy&#39;s appearance in Young Sheldon season 6 episode 2 highlights just how much The Big Bang Theory really destroyed Sheldon&#39;s twin sister. 




Young Sheldon season 6, and its Missy (Raegan Revord) storyline showcases just how much The Big Bang Theory has destroyed Sheldon&#39;s sister. After Mary (Laurie Metcalf), Sheldon&#39;s (Jim Parsons) twin sister, Missy, is the second Cooper to appear on The Big Bang Theory, visiting the socially inept genius in Pasadena. Despite her limited involvement in TBBT, her cameos effectively established her as a character. However, the later seasons of Young Sheldon make it increasingly difficult to believe that the Missy played by Reagan Revord grew up to be the Missy Big Bang Theory showed.




Instead of focusing its storytelling on Sheldon, Young Sheldon diversifies its storytelling and also gives ample focus on the rest of the Cooper family. That includes Sheldon&#39;s sister Missy, who has become a fan-favorite in the series. While Missy isn&#39;t as academically gifted as her twin brother, she excels in other life aspects. She is witty, charming, and social. She&#39;s also emotionally mature for her age, and as Young Sheldon has gone on it&#39;s become harder and harder to see the rebellious yet outgoing young Missy as someone who would become the Laurie Metcalf Missy Big Bang Theory introduced.

                  8 Ways Young Sheldon Changes How You See Missy In The Big Bang Theory   Despite her limited involvement, Missy became a fan-favorite in Big Bang Theory, but Young Sheldon is changing the way she&#39;s perceived in the sitcom.

Although Sheldon is the genius in the family, Young Sheldon season 6, episode 2 floats the idea that Missy is intellectually gifted as well. To land a part-time job at the local comic book store, Missy impresses the manager by recalling Sheldon&#39;s explanation about the X-Men, word per word. This means that Sheldon&#39;s sister also has great memory retention, like her brother. Between this innate skill and her ingenuity, not to mention her great social skills, it&#39;s difficult to imagine she ends up being the least successful Cooper sibling as established in the Missy The Big Bang Theory storylines.

Missy only appeared twice on Big Bang Theory; first in season 1, and then a whole decade later in season 11, in time for Sheldon&#39;s wedding to Amy (Mayim Bialik). In her final cameo, it is revealed that Sheldon&#39;s sister is on the brink of separation from her husband, hence why she is unhappy about being accidentally pregnant with their second child. Thanks to older Sheldon&#39;s narration on Young Sheldon, it has been revealed that ultimately, Missy found her happiness as she eventually gets re-married and ends up having more kids.




Older Sheldon doesn&#39;t get into specifics about his sister&#39;s fate, although there are theories that she may end up with Raj (Kunal Nayyar) after the pair reconnected during Sheldon and Amy&#39;s wedding. Young Sheldon season 5 sidelines Missy, relegating her to a supporting character rather than giving her a compelling arc. That changes in season 6, especially as she and Sheldon are now both teens, opening up a lot of narrative opportunities for her character. So, even if Young Sheldon can&#39;t change the Missy Big Bang Theory fate, Sheldon&#39;s sister could have a great run in the prequel spin-off.

                  Young Sheldon Makes Missyâ€™s Big Bang Theory Debut Much More Heartbreaking   Missy has become a problematic child in Young Sheldon season 6, but it also makes her The Big Bang Theory debut so much more heartbreaking.

In Young Sheldon season 6, the show improves Missy&#39;s storyline, as Shelton&#39;s sister enjoys an improved role. However, this also backs up the argument that Big Bang Theory messed up when revealing what Missy was like in the future. After barely appearing in season 6, she was back as a full-time character in the sixth season. A lot of what makes her great in the season is that Missy becomes more aware of what her family is going through, and she specifically realizes how others view them, even if Sheldon doesn&#39;t see it himself.

However, there are a few moments in the season that might explain why Missy never appears to be very smart, or a very good character at all in Big Bang Theory. This is the season where Sheldon and Missy begin to squabble more, and it is clear throughout that she doesn&#39;t want Sheldon at home anymore. She is starting to rebel and knows he is going to be there to stop her, and she also begins to feel neglected by her mother all season long, often feeling Sheldon is always the prized child.




In season 6, Missy works hard to convince Sheldon to never give up hope and accept his admission to the summer program in Germany. However, it isn&#39;t because she is being a good sister. Instead, Missy just wants Sheldon gone. It has become the norm that Sheldon&#39;s sister has much better social skills than him, and she uses them to manipulate him and make him do what she wants him to do - even without him even knowing it. Young Sheldon has shown that it is possible Missy was never as dumb as Big Bang Theory made her appear, and has been playing Sheldon all along.
