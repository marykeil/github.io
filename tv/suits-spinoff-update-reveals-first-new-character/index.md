# Suits Spinoff Update Reveals First New Character

A new report reveals that the spinoff will be set at an L.A. entertainment law firm with a lead character named Erica, who will share some similarities to Megan Markle&#39;s Rachel Zane.

## Literature Review

A new update has arrived for the announced L.A.-based Suits spinoff, and it includes some exciting details about the show’s female lead character.




Suits&#39; spinoff show gets an exciting update, with new details revealed about a new lead character. First airing in 2011, Suits ran for 9 popular seasons, following a group of talented lawyers in New York City. The show, which came to an end in 2019, experienced a massive surge in popularity last summer on streaming, leading to the announcement that a spinoff show is officially in the works.




Now, Hollywood journalist Matthew Belloni reveals more details about the Suits spinoff show in his Puck newsletter. He shares that the spinoff will be set at an entertainment law firm in L.A. and that it&#39;s soon set to start the casting process at NBC. Belloni provides a bio for the show&#39;s lead, Erica, who is described as &#34;30s, Black, SoCal native, and Harvard law alum. She’s jockeying to be made Head of Entertainment. She’s great at closing clients but struggles elsewhere. Smarter than everyone.&#34; Intriguingly, he notes that this new character shares some similarities to Megan Markle&#39;s Rachel Zane.

  


 What To Expect From The Suits Spinoff Show 
Will It Be As Popular As The Original?
          




The Suits spinoff show was first reported back in October, with original series creator Aaron Korsh serving as the creative force behind the new NBCUniversal series. No talent is attached just yet and few details have revealed about the story, but being set at an L.A.-based entertainment law firm could make for an interesting change of pace.



The first 8 seasons of Suits are available to watch on Netflix, but Peacock is the only platform that offers all 9 seasons to stream.




One of the reasons why Suits was so popular, both during its initial run and last year on streaming, is due to its tone. The show excels because it&#39;s light and easy to watch; the stakes aren&#39;t generally life or death, and it features an array of talented actors playing compelling characters. The cast of Suits includes actors like Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Markle, Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman, Gina Tores, and Wendell Piece, among others.




In order to succeed, the L.A. spinoff will need to once again assemble an array of great actors to play interesting characters. It&#39;s possible that a member of the Suits cast or two will reprise their role for the spinoff, and this could be a great way to recapture some of the original show&#39;s magic, but it&#39;s not yet clear if this will happen. While early details are promising, audiences still have quite a while to wait before the Suits spinoff show makes it way to air.



Patrick J. Adams recently revealed that he would be open to reprising his role as Mike Ross in the spinoff.
