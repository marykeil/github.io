Sam discusses his neglected childhood and how it affected his teeth but confirms he does have bottom teeth.   Sam opens up about his past drug addiction and how it impacted his relationships and career but is now working towards a better future with his fiancée Citra.  





Sam Wilson revealed the painful story behind his dental problems, which fans have been noticing during 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Sam is a 30-year-old man from Cameron, Missouri. He met Citra, 26, on a dating app when she messaged him to ask about his &#34;baby face.&#34; Sam didn&#39;t show interest in dating the Indonesian woman at first but soon was attracted to her physical features. He dated her online for two years and then flew to her country to propose to her. The 90 Day Fiancé season 10 star had a condition before Sam could marry her. She wanted him to convert to her Islamic religion.




Meanwhile, Sam&#39;s unique facial features on 90 Day Fiancé have results in a lot of curiosity about whether they has something to do with Sam&#39;s past drug addiction.


 

However, in his latest Instagram post, Sam decided to tell viewers his &#34;story&#34; so they will think before they speak. &#34;Long story short my family didn’t have the best upbringing,&#34; he explained. Sam&#39;s parents kept fighting a lot. He wrote that while he loved his parents and knew they did the best they could, he was neglected as a child. &#34;My teeth being one of them,&#34; he added. &#34;And yes I have bottom teeth,&#34; Sam confirmed in his caption.

Sam wrote that he had inherited his jawline from his dad&#39;s side. &#34;All of his family have the same jaws because we have part of Irish,&#34; he continued. Sam said that he appreciates all the fans who have his back and who support his relationship with Citra. He feels he&#39;s really lucky to have a beautiful woman like her by his side. Sam also tried explaining that the long filming hours gave him a lot of stress, so that is also one reason why he usually looks &#34;bad in scenes.&#34; Sam told his critics to reach out to any other 90 Day Fiancé cast member to confirm his claims.

Meanwhile, Sam also posted several photos from his childhood as fans seem to be taking an interest in how he looked before he got addicted to pain medicine. Sam became addicted to opiates at 15 years old. He stayed addicted for over eight years. At 22, Sam decided to become clean, but the past 10 years weren&#39;t free from relapses. He had become a cold and mean person when he was on drugs. He could not keep healthy relationships or commit to jobs he wanted to excel at. Sam has to work double shifts as an Amazon dockworker now to earn money, and sleeps in his car to save time on commuting.




Sam&#39;s fiancée, Citra, landed in America in the most recent 90 Day Fiancé episode. Citra&#39;s dad, a police officer, was also going to join her in the U.S. to carry out Sam&#39;s conversion and attend the wedding. Sam has yet to tell Citra&#39;s dad about the possibility of him facing jail time in the future for missing the deadline to complete a diversion program after he was arrested for carrying Suboxone without a prescription. He has made bad choices in his life, but he is working on being a better man for Citra and their future together after 90 Day Fiancé.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
