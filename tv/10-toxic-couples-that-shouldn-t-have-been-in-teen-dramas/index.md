## Literature Review
Considering they&#39;re designed for impressionable audiences, these 10 teen dramas shouldn&#39;t have featured these incredibly toxic couples. 




Despite having impressionable audiences, a number of teenage dramas have chosen to include very toxic relationships that serve as terrible examples for viewers. Given that being a teenager often comes with dating for the first time, it’s natural for relationships to be a bit more volatile than adult ones. Teen dramas, though, take this to a whole other level and display relationships that are toxic and should not be seen as normal. Many times, these relationships are not even called out for being unhealthy within the shows, which can give younger audiences the wrong idea about what relationships are supposed to look like.
Unfortunately, there is a very large amount of teenage dramas that choose to include toxic relationships. These relationships draw audiences in, as they wait to see whether or not they become “endgame”. Regardless of whether or not they are entertaining, it is important to acknowledge that shows marketed towards more impressionable viewers have a certain level of responsibility to portray healthy behaviors or at least call out unhealthy ones. Though there is no shortage of toxic teenage relationships on television, there are ones that manage to stand out as being undeniably awful.
            
 
 10 TV Show Relationships That Are Just Plain Weird (And Weirdly Problematic) 
Sometimes entertainment can veer into unconventional and problematic territory, and these 10 TV show couples serve as proof of that. 













 








 10  Dan &amp; Serena From Gossip Girl 


 







Dan and Serena were an on-and-off couple for nearly the entirety of Gossip Girl. The two were each other’s first loves and ultimately got married, but their relationship was toxic from the beginning. Dan was never able to accept Serena’s past and resented her for her privilege, while Serena consistently displayed negative behaviors like being dishonest and manipulative. Dan was also reporting terrible things about Serena for the entirety of their relationship, subjecting her to unimaginable public ridicule. While their journey from high school sweethearts to married adults is sweet, the toxicity of their relationship simply cannot be overlooked.





 9  Aria &amp; Ezra From Pretty Little Liars 


 







Despite being a show designed for teenage audiences, Pretty Little Liars displays an extremely problematic and toxic relationship for many seasons. Aria and Ezra’s relationship is one of the most inappropriate in teen drama history, as Aria is a high school student and Ezra is her teacher. What makes their situation even worse is that no one around them seems to take much issue with the fact that this is an illegal situation that could have incredibly serious consequences. Furthermore, Ezra was writing a true crime novel about Aria’s experiences without her being aware of it which ends another layer of manipulation to the dynamic.





 8  Brandon &amp; Callie From The Fosters 
        

Brandon and Callie became a beloved couple on The Fosters, with many viewers rooting for them to get together. Their relationship was strange and toxic, however, considering the two are foster siblings. They lived in the same house, shared parents and siblings, and knew that their relationship was forbidden by the state and could jeopardize Callie’s ability to be adopted into the family. Trying to navigate the family dynamics of being in a relationship proved to be too much, though, and luckily, the couple did not last.





 7  Jughead &amp; Betty From Riverdale 


 







The two were overly dependent on each other and being better off separately. 

Like Brandon and Callie, Jughead and Betty’s relationship was a fan-favorite on Riverdale. Despite audience approval, however, their relationship is quite unhealthy. Their social lives are incredibly intertwined, which makes it difficult for either of them to escape the drama. This made it hard for either one to grow as an individual or together as a couple. They led to the two being overly dependent on each other and being better off separately.





 6  Justin &amp; Jessica From 13 Reasons Why 
        

13 Reasons Why has been called out for being problematic in a number of different ways, one of which includes its portrayal of Justin and Jessica’s relationship. Jessica is sexually assaulted by Bryce, Justin’s best friend. Justin had the ability to stop the assault from happening but did not. In fact, he convinces Jessica it never happened and threatens to hurt someone who finds out the truth about the incident. Justin’s behavior would not be acceptable under any circumstances, but the fact that he protected someone who hurt the person he was in a serious relationship with is completely unforgivable. This relationship sets a horrific example for the show’s teenage viewers and should not have been included.





 5  Finn &amp; Quinn From Glee 
        

Glee definitely is not a show audiences should be turning to for examples of healthy relationships. One of the biggest examples of this is Quinn and Finn. Their relationship was filled with lies, betrayal, and infidelity. For example, Quinn cheated on Finn with Puck and became pregnant. Instead of coming clean about her mistake, Quinn decided to convince Finn that the baby was his. Given that the show is one targeted at teenage audiences, this should not have been a storyline as it gives the wrong idea to impressionable viewers.





 4  Damon &amp; Elena From The Vampire Diaries 


 







Damon consistently disrespected Elena’s choices and tried to make decisions for her, undermining her autonomy. 

Though Damon and Elena had undeniable chemistry on The Vampire Diaries, their relationship was incredibly toxic. Damon consistently disrespected Elena’s choices and tried to make decisions for her, undermining her autonomy. Damon also hurt the people closest to Elena and even went so far as to break her brother’s neck. All in all, Damon was a terrible partner and did not respect that Elena was her own person who deserved respect even if she didn’t choose to be with him.





 3  Spencer &amp; Olivia From All American 
        

Spencer and Olivia’s relationship in All American definitely has some redeeming qualities but has many toxic ones as well. Spencer cheats on Olivia’s best friend with her, for example, which creates a whole lot of drama within their friend group. When Olivia was drinking and got into a car accident, she asked Spencer to sit in the driver’s seat before the police arrived so she would not get arrested, which demonstrated a lack of consideration for Spencer and his future. Spencer also continuously sacrifices parts of himself to be a part of the Baker family, while Olivia does things like take on opportunities that could jeopardize Spencer’s future.





 2  Jackson &amp; Lydia From Teen Wolf 
        

Jackson and Lydia’s relationship in Teen Wolf went beyond just toxic and was straight-up abusive. Jackson took out his insecurities on Lydia in the form of misguided anger. He was constantly yelling and disrespecting her. He set a terrible example of how a partner should behave to teenage audiences, which is very unfortunate.





 1  Brooke &amp; Felix From One Tree Hill 
        

Felix is one of the strongest examples of a terrible partner on television. He was very mean-spirited and was constantly dishonest. He had a massive ego and demonstrated homophobic behavior throughout the show. He also initially wanted to sleep with Brooke, rather than actually wanting a relationship with her. Brooke deserved much more respect and a better boyfriend overall.
