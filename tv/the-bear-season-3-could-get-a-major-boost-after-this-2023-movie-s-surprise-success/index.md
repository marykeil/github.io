## Literature Review
One 2023 movie&#39;s impressive box office numbers and critical ratings can play a crucial role in increasing interest surrounding The Bear season 3.




Following one 2023 movie&#39;s surprising critical and commercial success, The Bear season 3 will likely get a major boost. Long after the premiere of its second season, The Bear is gaining some traction all over again by making waves at award functions. At the 2024 Golden Globes, it not only won the Best Television Series in the Musical or Comedy category but also got its leading stars, Ayo Edebiri and Jeremy Allen White, their first Golden Globe wins.




The Bear&#39;s success at the Golden Globes alone will be instrumental to driving more attention towards its third season. However, along with that, one of 2023&#39;s best biopic dramas will further fuel the hype surrounding The Bear season 3, potentially making it the show&#39;s most anticipated and talked-about installment to date. While only time will tell how The Bear season 3 will perform, the 2023 movie has seemingly paved the way for its success.

                  The Bear Season 3 Returning To Its Roots Promises The Show&#39;s Best Outing Yet   The Bear&#39;s new update not only confirms that season 3 will return to the show&#39;s roots but also establishes how it could be the series&#39; best outing.    


 The Bear Season 3 May See More Interest After Jeremy Allen White&#39;s Role In The Iron Claw 
         

Before starring as the main character, Carmy Berzatto, in The Bear, Jeremy Allen White was primarily known for playing Lip Gallagher in Shameless and other roles in relatively obscure indie movies like The Rental, Movie 43, and Afterschool. However, after The Bear, the actor&#39;s career took a new turn, and his fame grew from strength to strength, making him a household name. The Bear season 2&#39;s wide success further reinstated him as a prominent star, proving he had the range and versatility to portray complex and multi-layered characters. As the anticipation for The Bear season 3 grows, another role has proven Jeremy Allen White&#39;s acting prowess.




Jeremy Allen White plays Kerry Von Erich in The Iron Claw, the fourth-born son of the Von Erich wrestling family. Although Zac Efron takes the spotlight in The Iron Claw with his deeply moving portrayal of Kevin Von Erich, White, too, does an incredible job at making audiences empathize with his character. Since The Iron Claw is Jeremy Allen White&#39;s first big movie role, it could play a crucial role in increasing audience interest surrounding The Bear season 3. His spectacular performance in The Iron Claw could encourage more viewers to watch The Bear&#39;s first two seasons, which, in turn, will get season 3 more eyes.



 A Boost From The Iron Claw Would Make The Bear Even Bigger &amp; Better 
         

With its near-perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes, The Bear has clearly been one of the most commended and well-received shows in recent times. However, despite its critical acclaim, The Bear is not yet as mainstream as other renowned dramas. Considering how The Iron Claw has surpassed the $20 million milestone at the box office, a rare feat for R-rated movies, it is undoubtedly doing well in theaters. After watching Jeremy Allen White in the film, many viewers would be curious to know how he showcases his talent in other roles, which would again boost The Bear&#39;s overall viewership. Not to mention, Jeremy Allen White may also get other award nods — if not wins — for his performance in The Iron Claw, making him and The Bear season 3 an even bigger deal.




             The Bear Set in a Chicago sandwich shop, The Bear follows Carmy Berzatto, a young professionally trained chef who returns to take over his family business after the unexpected death of his brother. At odds with many of the shop&#39;s employees due to his culinary training, Carmy struggles to maintain order and keep the shop from failing entirely. Jeremy Allen White stars as Carmy alongside Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Ayo Edebiri.   Release Date   June 23, 2022    Cast   Jeremy Allen White , Ebon Moss-Bachrach , Ayo Edebiri , Lionel Boyce , Liza Colón-Zayas , Abby Elliott , Oliver Platt    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   2    Story By   Christopher Storer    Writers   Christopher Storer    Network   FX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43;    Directors   Christopher Storer    Showrunner   Christopher Storer
