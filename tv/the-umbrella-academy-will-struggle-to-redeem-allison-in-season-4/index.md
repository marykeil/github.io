# The Umbrella Academy Will Struggle To Redeem Allison In Season 4


## SUMMARY 



  Allison&#39;s actions in The Umbrella Academy season 3 are dark and despicable, making it difficult for viewers to forgive her.   The series will likely attempt to redeem Allison before the end, but whether fans will accept it is questionable.   While Allison may have potential as a villain, her previous character development and close relationships with her siblings suggest she won&#39;t remain a villain in season 4.

## Literature Review
The Umbrella Academy season 4 will likely attempt to redeem Allison Hargreeves, but her despicable behavior in season 3 will make that a hard sell.




Allison Hargreeves takes a turn for the worse in The Umbrella Academy season 3, and season 4 will struggle to redeem her before the Netflix series is through. After losing her daughter and husband in The Umbrella Academy season 3&#39;s new timeline, Allison lets anger consume her. She turns on her siblings and even strikes a deal with Reginald, trading everyone else&#39;s happiness for her own at the end of The Umbrella Academy season 3.




While Allison does reunite with her husband and daughter in The Umbrella Academy&#39;s newest timeline, it&#39;s hard to see her feeling guilt-free about what she&#39;s done to her siblings. Allison has a lot of potential as a villain, but her heartwarming relationship with Viktor and her closeness with characters like Luther proves that she cares deeply for the rest of the Hargreeves family. As such, it&#39;s unlikely she&#39;ll remain a villain through the Netflix series&#39; final season. However, after her most recent transgressions, viewers may have a hard time forgiving her.



The Umbrella Academy seasons 1-3 are streaming on Netflix.

The Netflix Series Probably Won&#39;t Leave Her A Villain
          




Although The Umbrella Academy turns Allison into a villain in season 3, the series will likely try to redeem her before its ending. The Umbrella Academy doesn&#39;t paint any of the Hargreeves siblings as completely black and white, and it&#39;s given Allison too many redeeming qualities to keep her the series&#39; villain permanently. While Allison has certainly gone astray, she&#39;ll probably be given a redemption arc of sorts in The Umbrella Academy season 4. Whether this will go over well with fans of the show is another story.

Allison goes to a pretty dark place in The Umbrella Academy season 3, and while her pain is understandable, her actions take things too far. It&#39;s not just the fact that she betrays her siblings at the end, though that turn of events is the cherry on top of an already bad season. While one could argue that helping Reginald reset the universe is good for the Hargreeves — even if Allison lies to make it happen — her actions leading up to that point are still despicable. Even if her manipulation pays off, her treatment of her siblings will make any redemption in season 4 feel like too little, too late.






 Umbrella Academy Season 3 Undersold How Dark Allison&#39;s Actions Were 
Allison Hargreeves Needs To Take A Long, Hard Look In The Mirror
          

Allison&#39;s actions throughout The Umbrella Academy season 3 are incredibly dark, and the Netflix series actually undersells them. Allison killing Viktor&#39;s troubled friend, turning her back on Viktor, and attempting to sexually assault Luther are among the worst things the Umbrella Academy character does in the most recent episodes. And while Allison claims that she didn&#39;t know Reginald would kill Luther and Klaus to achieve his ends, her willingness to work with her adoptive father still brings about those outcomes. It&#39;s fortunate that the pair are able to come back, but Allison still unknowingly puts them in danger.

                  Umbrella Academy Season 4 Clue May Confirm An Allison Theory   Allison’s fate at the end of season 3 was unclear, but the title for episode 1 of season 4 may indicate that she’s alive and has a lot to lose.    




What makes Allison&#39;s dark shift even worse is that she doesn&#39;t appear to feel any remorse. This may change when she has time to process what she&#39;s done, but she only seems to double down on her selfish, sometimes cruel behavior throughout season 3. She plows forward without considering anyone else, and it makes her one of the most unlikable characters by the time the credits roll. This will make it harder for The Umbrella Academy season 4 to get viewers back on her side, especially if it continues to gloss over her actions instead of having her reflect on what she&#39;s doing wrong.



 Allison As An Outright Villain Doesn&#39;t Work Either 
The Umbrella Academy Has Shown Her Redeeming Qualities
         

While Allison&#39;s actions in The Umbrella Academy season 3 are probably too dark to reverse with a short redemption arc in season 4, her character also doesn&#39;t work as an outright villain. The first two seasons of The Umbrella Academy showcase her better qualities, depicting her as one of the more compassionate Hargreeves siblings. Although her actions are often selfish, it&#39;s clear she has a good heart underneath it all. The events of season 3 may harden Allison, but getting her family back will likely bring out her old self — and potentially force her to take a long, hard look in the mirror.




Only time will tell if The Umbrella Academy season 4 can successfully redeem Allison, but doing so won&#39;t be easy. After everything she&#39;s done, a single season may not be enough to get Allison back in audiences&#39; — and her siblings&#39; — good graces. The fact that The Umbrella Academy season 4 has so much other ground to cover before wrapping the story will make this even harder. After all, the show can&#39;t dedicate that much time to Allison&#39;s character arc. It needs to give the rest of the Hargreeves proper endings too, as well as bring the main storyline full circle.
