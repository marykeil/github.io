## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Christine Brown may be in her villain era, but she&#39;s doing things more intentionally than ever after her split from Kody Brown.




Sister Wives Christine Brown happily shared during the final installment of Sister Wives: One On One that she’s in her villain era, and many are wondering what exactly that means for the bubbly star. Throughout Sister Wives season 18, the end of Christine’s marriage to Kody continued to cause issues throughout the rest of the family. While Christine was settling into her life in Salt Lake City, Utah with Truely and the rest of her local children, Kody’s marriages to Janelle Brown and Meri Brown were crumbling. After 30 years together, Kody’s relationships with Janelle and Meri ended as he tried to work through his grief about his divorce.
While Christine has been at peace with her decision to leave the Brown family, Kody wasn’t able to process her choice easily. Instead, he chose to take out his feelings on everyone else in his life. Christine, instead, worked on herself as she moved into the next phase of her life. Christine and her family adjusted to her single life, but she quickly got to a point where she wanted to start dating again. She met David Woolley, who opened her eyes to how love could feel, and the pair began dating. Christine’s independence led her into her villain era.

She Chose To Start A New Life In Utah
        

While Christine’s choice to be independent of the family wasn’t a surprise for Sister Wives viewers, it was a major shock to the Brown family. Christine’s decision to leave came after years of issues between her and Kody, resulting in her feeling neglected and isolated from the rest of the family. She shared that leaving Flagstaff was the healthiest decision, explaining during an episode of Sister Wives season 18 that every time she’s come back to the city since moving away, she’s had to ready herself mentally to be in a difficult headspace again. Christine’s decision felt selfish to Kody, but was the best choice for her at the time.





 7  Christine &amp; Kody&#39;s Divorce Got Messy When She Stopped Hiding Her Truth 
She&#39;s Being Honest About Their Marriage


 







While Kody and Christine were trying to be amicable at first, their relationship shifted when she stopped trying to hide the way she was actually feeling from her ex. Christine explained during Sister Wives season 18 episode 18 that she was used to having to keep herself in check around Kody, hiding the way she was genuinely feeling in order to preserve the peace between them. When the pair separated, Christine began to be more open with her feelings despite the fact that they may be negative. Christine’s choice to be honest led to Kody’s feelings taking another hit, which made her seem even more villainous than she had before.





 6  Christine Refused To Let Kody &amp; Robyn Control The Narrative 
She Wanted Her Story To Be Her Own
        

Throughout her divorce from Kody, Christine stayed quiet while Robyn and Kody were vocalizing their feelings to the press as much as possible. When Robyn and Kody started to publicly control the narrative surrounding Christine’s decisions, vilifying her whenever possible, she decided to speak up and let her side of the story be known. Christine didn’t want to let Robyn and Kody control the narrative surrounding her split from Kody, as it wasn’t just Kody’s story to tell. While Robyn’s always been controlling, Christine knew that she wasn’t going to leave the perception of her marriage’s end in her ex-husband and ex-sister wife’s hands.





 5  Christine Was Up Front About Her Feelings With Her Kids 
She Didn&#39;t Want To Hide How She Felt
        

While there were things throughout her marriage that she didn’t want to share about Kody with her children, Christine decided once her relationship with Kody ended, she didn’t need to stay quiet about what she’d dealt with. In Sister Wives season 18 episode 13, Christine was talking to a group of her children and mentioned that Kody didn’t find her physically attractive, which the children already seemed to know. She explained that she never wanted her kids to hear that she was in a relationship with someone who wasn’t attracted to her, but when the truth came out, she felt better that they’d heard it despite making Kody look bad.





 4  Christine Didn&#39;t Try To Save Kody&#39;s Image On Sister Wives 
She Shared The Realities Of Being Married To The Patriarch


 







Christine has always seemed honest and open during her time on Sister Wives, which is why it was surprising when she revealed she’d been holding back for Kody’s sake over the years. After her divorce, Christine explained that she was always holding a bit of herself back in order to make Kody feel better about himself and his position. After separating from Kody, Christine no longer cared to hold parts of herself back. She began to share the realities of living in a plural marriage with Kody, explaining that she was no longer interested in preserving his image just for the sake of keeping him happy.





 3  Christine Improved Her Relationship With Janelle At The Right Time 
She &#34;Stole&#34; Janelle From Kody, According To Him
        

Christine’s relationship with Janelle has changed tremendously since she left the family, and its been for the better. While Janelle stayed with Kody after Christine left for nearly a year, she continued to talk to Christine about their difficult relationship. Janelle having someone to confide in as her relationship with Kody crumbled was helpful, and having it be someone as close as Christine was an added bonus. While Christine was trying to help Janelle through a difficult time, Kody took their close relationship to mean that Christine stole Janelle from him, ignoring the fact that he had a massive hand in ruining their relationship.





 2  Christine&#39;s Sharing Her Love Story With David Unabashedly 
She&#39;s Told The World She&#39;s Never Been In Love Like This

Christine was honest about her relationship, sharing that she wasn’t sure she was even going to start dating again but took the plunge and quickly met David. Prior to their November 2023 wedding, Christine and David shared that they were happily together and navigating anything that came their way as a unit, something Christine was clear she’s never experienced in her time with Kody and her ex sister wives.





 1  Christine&#39;s Living Her Life As Loudly As Possible 
She&#39;s Happy And She Wants Everyone To Know
        

After spending years of making herself small to allow Kody to feel large, Christine has been able to share her truest self with the world after her split from her ex-husband. She’s fallen in love and has been able to ensure that Sister Wives viewers understand her side of the story, along with Kody’s.
