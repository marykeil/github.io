# Rap Sh!t Season 3 Cancelation &amp; Everything We Know


## SUMMARY 



  Rap Sh!t has been canceled by HBO after only two seasons.   Season 3 would likely have seen both Aida Osman and KaMillion return as Shawna and Mia, the main leads of the series.   So far, no other streamer or network has stepped in to renew season 3 of Rap Sh!t.

## Literature Review

After two successful seasons on the air, the possibility for a third season of Rap Sh!t has never been higher, but HBO has canceled the series.




Rap Sh!t has already enjoyed two successful seasons so far, but has pulled the plug on season 3. Created by Issa Rae (Insecure), Rap Sh!t tells the story of two young rappers from Miami who struggle to break into the cutthroat music business while maintaining their fragile social lives. Season 2 of the series upped the ante even more and presented even more drama that practically leaped off the screen.




Rap Sh!t was a critical success in its first season, which led to an immediate renewal for the second season, which eventually aired one year later. Though the release of season 2 was temporarily delayed by the Hollywood strikes, the season did eventually air in late 2023 and somehow managed to improve on what was presented in season 1. With the show gaining momentum at a critical moment, the possibility of Rap Sh!t season 3 seemed high, but HBO has opted not to continue the story.

 Rap Sh!t Season 3 Is Canceled 
          

Just a month after the show&#39;s second season garnered an impressive response from critics, HBO canceled Rap Sh!t before a third season could be made. The cancelation comes as a wave of original comedies have gotten the ax as the premium cable network struggles to find a streaming identity. Dramas like The Last of Us and House of the Dragon have flourished, while comedies like Our Flag Means Death and now Rap Sh!t have been left to the wayside. 






 Rap Sh!t Season 3 Cast 
          

The conclusion of Rap Sh!t season 2 offered a clue about the cast of the potential third season, and both Aida Osman and KaMillion would have returned as Shawna and Mia. The duo has led the show throughout its two years on the air, and it was their bond that was the heart of the series. Jonica Booth would also likely have returned as Chastity, and season 3 could have given her a chance to deal with her betrayal at the hands of Shawna and Mia.

Other likely returns included:

 Actor  Rap Sh!t Role   RJ Cyler  Lamont   Daniel Augustin  Maurice   Devon Terrell  Cliff Lewis   Jaboukie Young-White  Francois   Jacob Romero Gibson  Lord AK   Kyle Bary  Courtney Taylor   








 Rap Sh!t Season 3 Story 
          

If season 1 showcased Shawna and Mia&#39;s attempts to crack into the music business, season 2 was the duo&#39;s first big roadblock, and it forced them to make tough decisions. Season 3 of Rap Sh!t would have likely seen the two reach new heights of success, but their decision to work with Francois also meant they burned bridges with their long-time friend Chastity. Perhaps Chastity could have become the next great Rap Sh!t villain as she turned against her former friends and sabotaged their rise to fame.



 Will Rap Sh!t Get Renewed Elsewhere? 
          

The fate of Rap Sh!t after its cancelation at HBO is not nearly as certain as it would have been in the past. In the modern age of streaming, shows are canceled and renewed by different networks and streamers all the time. Notable series like The Killing and Minx were axed by their original networks before finding a home somewhere else. Despite that, it is unclear if Rap Sh!t can continue somewhere else, and so far, no one has stepped up to save it from cancelation.
