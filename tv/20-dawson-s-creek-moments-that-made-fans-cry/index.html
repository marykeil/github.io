  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Dawson&rsquo;s Creek was packed with dramatic moments that made the audience cry, though it also had more lighthearted moments that brought out happy tears.</p>
<p>Dawson’s Creek left viewers with a couple of valuable life lessons, but in the process, it also made them cry many times, mostly out of sadness. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the peak of teen drama TV series, and one of the most popular and successful ones was Dawson’s Creek. Created by Kevin Williamson, Dawson’s Creek ran from 1998 to 2003 for a total of six seasons, all of them packed with drama, romance, and a couple of tragedies, but also some heartwarming moments that left viewers with some interesting life lessons.
Dawson’s Creek followed Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek), a 15-year-old and aspiring filmmaker living in the small town of Capeside, Massachusetts. His best friend, Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) has feelings for him, but their dynamic, along with that with Dawson’s other best friend, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), shifts with the arrival of Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams). Together, Dawson and his friends go through the many ups and downs of being teenagers and into their young adult years, while also dealing with many obstacles and tragedies. Dawson’s Creek had a big dose of drama and made its audience cry many times, though it also had some moments that brought out happy tears.</p>
<p>20  Jen Sits By Her Grandfather’s Bed In His Last Moments
Dawson’s Creek season 1, episode 13, “Decisions”</p>
<p>Dawson’s Creek wasted no time in making its audience cry. When Jen arrives in Capeside, she moves in with her grandmother and her grandfather, who is battling an illness. Grandpa Ryan passes away at the end of season 1, and Jen stays with him during his final moments, sitting by his bed. Little did viewers know at the time that the death of Grandpa Ryan was only the beginning of many tough moments for Jen.</p>
<p>19  Pacey Breaks Down To His Passed Out Father
Dawson’s Creek season 2, episode 12, “Uncharted Waters”</p>
<p>Pacey came from an abusive home, which led him to make many bad decisions during his teenage years. Pacey’s father was neglectful and dealt with alcohol abuse disorder, which contributed to them not having a good relationship. In season 2, Pacey and Dawson go on a father-son trip, which Pacey’s father, John (John Finn), uses to tell his son how useless he is. John gets drunk and Pacey carries him home, and as he’s passed out on the beach, Pacey goes on to give himself the father-and-son talk he desperately needed but was never going to have. Pacey completely breaks down, asking John why he gave up on him and telling him he was supposed to love him.</p>

<p>16  Abby’s Death
Dawson’s Creek season 2, episode 18, “A Perfect Wedding”</p>
<p>Abby Morgan (Monica Keena) wasn’t the most popular character in Dawson’s Creek, but that doesn’t make her death less shocking or tragic.

Abby trips and hits her head, and then falls into the ocean and drowns. At her funeral, Jen calls out the hypocrisy of everyone in Capeside mourning Abby’s death, as they never cared about her nor were they her friends.</p>
<p>15  Pacey Tries To Help Andie
Dawson’s Creek season 2, episode 20, “Reunited”</p>
<p>Andie not only dealt with the death of her brother Tim and the effect it had on her family, but she also dealt with mental health issues.

Dawson then convinces Joey to help the police arrest her father, and though the plan succeeds, she tells Dawson she will never forgive him for forcing her decision.
