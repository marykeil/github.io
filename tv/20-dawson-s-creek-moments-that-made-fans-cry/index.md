## Literature Review
Dawson&#39;s Creek was packed with dramatic moments that made the audience cry, though it also had more lighthearted moments that brought out happy tears.




Dawson’s Creek left viewers with a couple of valuable life lessons, but in the process, it also made them cry many times, mostly out of sadness. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the peak of teen drama TV series, and one of the most popular and successful ones was Dawson’s Creek. Created by Kevin Williamson, Dawson’s Creek ran from 1998 to 2003 for a total of six seasons, all of them packed with drama, romance, and a couple of tragedies, but also some heartwarming moments that left viewers with some interesting life lessons.
Dawson’s Creek followed Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek), a 15-year-old and aspiring filmmaker living in the small town of Capeside, Massachusetts. His best friend, Joey Potter (Katie Holmes) has feelings for him, but their dynamic, along with that with Dawson’s other best friend, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), shifts with the arrival of Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams). Together, Dawson and his friends go through the many ups and downs of being teenagers and into their young adult years, while also dealing with many obstacles and tragedies. Dawson’s Creek had a big dose of drama and made its audience cry many times, though it also had some moments that brought out happy tears.
