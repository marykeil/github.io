## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda opens up about the shocking inspiration behind her latest hair makeover in a hilarious new Instagram update.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda revealed which iconic character from Shrek inspired her latest stunning makeover. Jasmine is a 36-year-old former teacher from Panama, currently living in the U.S. with her partner Gino Palazzolo, 53. Jasmine and Gino met on a dating app over three years ago and have been through several ups and downs in their relationship since then. Jasmine&#39;s insecurities about herself made her suspicious about Gino&#39;s loyalty towards her. Meanwhile, Gino wondered if Jasmine was using him for his money and marrying him for a Green Card. Jasmine recently accused Gino of cheating on her after she found a tube of lip gloss in his car.




The latest episode of 90 Day Fiancé season 10 showed Jasmine getting into a loud argument with Gino and crying about wanting to return to Panama. However, Jasmine is keeping things light and humorous on social media to entertain her followers (as shared by Mothermurder88 on Reddit).


 

Jasmine was known for her long and flowing hair on Before the 90 Days. She revealed the hair wasn&#39;t real, and she was wearing wigs and extensions to help cope with her alarming hair loss. However, Jasmine took off her extensions before coming to America as it was proving to be a costly affair. She now wears her natural hair with pride and her new hairstyle is seemingly inspired by Lord Farquaad himself.

 Jasmine Pineda&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Storyline Explained 
          

Jasmine shared side-by-side photos of herself and the Shrek antagonist to prove her point. &#34;The inspiration for my look with the bangs was Lord Farquaad,&#34; Jasmine explained. However, fans didn&#39;t agree with Jasmine. They didn&#39;t want to act mean towards her and cause anguish. While they appreciated Jasmine poking fun at herself, they told her that she looked nothing like Lord Farquaad with her sassy new hair. Someone commented, &#34;No, it’s like Uma Thurman in pulp fiction! Love it!&#34; Another fan added, &#34;He didn’t have bangs. Lol. And, you look nothing like that.&#34;

Jasmine and the lip gloss she found underneath her seat in Gino&#39;s car isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s causing the couple stress in their storyline during 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Jasmine kept her butt implants a secret from him because she used her wedding dress allowance to get them. Gino has been particularly upset due to Jasmine&#39;s carelessness, especially since he quit his job and is running low on finances. What Gino doesn&#39;t know is that Jasmine took additional money from her ex-boyfriend, Dane, to get the cosmetic procedure.




Meanwhile, Jasmine has been worried about whether she will ever be able to get her two sons to America now that Gino is unemployed. Jasmine is also being mistreated by Gino&#39;s family, who look down upon her for belonging to a different nationality. They believe Jasmine is only interested in using Gino for his money, especially after she refused to sign a prenup. Jasmine still managing to laugh while dealing with these difficult situations on 90 Day Fiancé is what her followers truly appreciate.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
