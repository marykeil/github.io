## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Kim Plath may have just started dating her boyfriend Ken Palmer, but he may have changed her life already.




Welcome To Plathville season 5 has shown the budding romance between Kim Plath and Ken Palmer, whom she began dating after her divorce, but could Kim be making a huge change for Ken so quickly? Kim&#39;s relationship with Ken has been interesting, as the timeline of events surrounding their first meeting and the beginning of their relationship is fuzzy for some viewers. Ken was introduced in Welcome To Plathville season 5 and has been a part of Kim&#39;s divorced life, but things are already getting serious between the mother of 9 and her new boyfriend. While Kim&#39;s children aren&#39;t all on board with Ken, she may not care.




In a clip from an upcoming Welcome To Plathville episode from ET Online, Kim and Ken talk about the very real possibility of her moving in with him. Ken, who Kim has described as a gentle, sweet man, approaches the idea of Kim moving in diplomatically. &#34;You know I have spare bedrooms and you&#39;re more than welcome to move into one of those,&#34; Ken explained calmly before continuing, &#34;And I...could help you out financially until you get back on your feet.&#34; While Kim didn&#39;t give an answer, she did reveal how happy she was to have Ken.


 Kim Plath Admits Relationship Is Moving “Quickly” 
          

While Kim seemed excited at the prospect of living with Ken, she made it clear that she couldn&#39;t just consider herself in the decision. &#34;I don&#39;t want to answer quickly. I guess I just need to consider the children,&#34; Kim explained to Ken, who nodded understandingly. &#34;I wasn&#39;t really expecting this to happen so quickly,&#34; Kim explained directly to the cameras in an interview. &#34;But I kind of want to be a little bit level headed and think things through, and just consider it from the children&#39;s perspective.&#34; While she&#39;s right to consider things from the perspective of her kids, it&#39;s surprising to hear from Kim considering her past.





 

Kim&#39;s relationship with Ken has moved quickly, as the pair went from strangers to a relationship within just a few months. The couple have exchanged &#34;I love you&#39;s&#34; and is talking about moving in together in less than a year, which may not be an issue, but it&#39;s a lot coming from Kim, who&#39;s freshly out of a marriage. While Kim and Barry Plath don&#39;t even appear to be legally divorced yet, Kim&#39;s already making potential plans to move in with Ken and bringing her children into the picture. She may not believe it&#39;s too much too fast, but it seems like it from the outside.

While Kim and Ken may be moving quickly, they seem tremendously happy together. Kim&#39;s marriage to Barry, especially by the end of Welcome to Plathville season 4, was difficult to watch as the couple had very little affection towards each other, especially from Kim&#39;s perspective. While Barry was hoping to make things work, Kim was ready to move on. With someone she cares about as much as Ken in the picture, Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Kim may be ready to change her life.
