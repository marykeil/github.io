## Literature Review

In Rick and Michonne&#39;s Walking Dead spinoff, The Ones Who Live, there&#39;s the opportunity to address one forgotten character&#39;s fate in the franchise.




With Rick and Michonne&#39;s spinoff, The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, comes the chance to explore new angles and address unanswered questions, including one forgotten character&#39;s fate. Navigating The Walking Dead timeline can amplify certain questions, such as Heath&#39;s disappearance in season 7 of the parent show or Negan&#39;s family&#39;s absence in The Walking Dead: Dead City. But one of the biggest untapped areas of the franchise overall is the Civic Republic Military.




The CRM was first introduced in the main show, then was referenced and included a character from the organization in Fear The Walking Dead. Finally, audiences got their first real glimpse at some of the inner workings in The Walking Dead: World Beyond. Teases from World Beyond - like the yellow CRM gas or Major General Beale as the main villain - will be addressed, as shown in The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live trailer. However, one character in particular needs to be included and could even play an important role in Rick&#39;s story.



The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live premieres February 25, 2024, on AMC and AMC&#43;.




                  10 Most Exciting Things To Expect From Rick &amp; Michonne&#39;s Walking Dead Show, The Ones Who Live   With The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live releasing in February 2024, there are exciting expectations audiences have of the Rick and Michonne spinoff.   





 Silas From World Beyond Could Help Expose The CRM In The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live 
          

Silas was first introduced as a resident of the Campus Colony after being sent there for committing violent crimes in Omaha. He later became a Civic Republic (CR) culling facility worker. Most notably, by the end of The Walking Dead: World Beyond, Silas became a CRM soldier with a plan to infiltrate and expose the military&#39;s nefarious plans to the CR government.

Because his story is left at this in The Walking Dead: World Beyond, it&#39;s certainly plausible that he could make a return in The Ones Who Live, which is so heavily focused on the CRM. Setting up a major plan to overthrow the CRM, one of The Walking Dead&#39;s most powerful survivor groups, only to never follow up would be a disservice to Silas&#39; character and that story arc. Moreover, Silas&#39; covert mission aligns with any potential undercover plans Rick might have to gain influence and strategically find Michonne or retry his escape.






 How Silas Could Be A Threat To The CRM In The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live 
          

How Silas gained his position at the CRM was through Jadis, who is now a CRM warrant officer. Even after trying to leave with Huck&#39;s husband, Dennis, Jadis saw potential in Silas and started him on military training as her &#34;special project.&#34; Although Silas&#39; Walking Dead future was hinted in the World Beyond finale, a turn to villainy isn&#39;t guaranteed. Whether Jadis believes he has the potential to ruthlessly do what needs to be done for the CRM to achieve its goals doesn&#39;t change his proven instances of disobedience in the name of justice and helping those he cares about.

Since Dennis encouraged Silas to remember that he&#39;s not like the CRM, even if he stays with them to survive, Silas could become a threat to the organization. By using Jadis&#39; belief in what he could become for the CRM and their mission, Silas could potentially gain deeper infiltration into the finer details of the CRM&#39;s sinister plans involving Project V, which could help thwart them. Plus, Jadis aimed her gun downward in the spinoff&#39;s trailer while looking somewhat sad, which could mean Silas&#39; plans could fail, and she reluctantly put him down to preserve the CRM&#39;s secrets.




                  Rick Grimes Spinoff Trailer Confirms His CRM Role Is Way Bigger Than The Walking Dead&#39;s Finale Revealed   The trailer for Rick Grimes&#39; Walking Dead spinoff, The Ones Who Live, confirms that his role within the CRM is even bigger than first anticipated.   



 How Rick Could Benefit From Silasâ€™ Help In The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live 
         

Because The Walking Dead: World Beyond season 1 was set around season 10 and 11 of the main show, Rick being taken to the CRM in season 9 put him there before Silas. Moreover, World Beyond season 2 suggested Jadis hadn&#39;t dealt with Rick in a while since she referred to him as the &#34;ticket&#34; to get into the CR &#34;six years ago.&#34; This suggests Silas&#39; connection to Jadis could be in Rick&#39;s favor in present-day if Silas interacts with him, which is likely since Rick CRM roles include culling facility worker and soldier or pilot.




Additionally, because Silas&#39; goal is bigger than escaping the CRM, his covert approach to gaining useful information to expose the CRM to the CR could benefit Rick&#39;s mission to find Michonne. For instance, Silas may have found intel about Rick&#39;s family while on a mission as a soldier, or he may have been in contact with someone who knows Rick&#39;s family or seen Alexandria. Whether or not Silas dies, his CRM story is worth addressing as there&#39;s potential for his and Rick&#39;s stories to coincide and work towards each of their goals in The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live.
