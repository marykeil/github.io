## Literature Review
Daniele Gates has recovered from the hurt Yohan Geronimo had caused her on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. She looks beautiful in her latest photoshoot.




Daniele Gates from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way is glowing after splitting from her husband, Yohan Geronimo. The couple debuted in 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise season 2 to document their love story. Despite the 10-year age gap, Daniele and Yohan seemed compatible and in love. However, things changed dramatically when they appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4. During the season, Daniele revealed that she decided to move to the Dominican Republic instead of inviting Yohan to the United States to live with her.




Daniele explained that living in New York City is expensive, so it would be better for her and Yohan to start their new married life in the Dominican Republic. Since Yohan wanted to move to the U.S. to earn money, so he could provide for his family, he started harboring resentment toward his wife. Towards the end of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, Yohan became frustrated with their marital issues and moved out of Daniele&#39;s house, even asking for a divorce.

After Yohan moved out of Daniele&#39;s house, she received messages from a woman who claimed to be in a relationship with Yohan for two years. While talking to the cameras, Daniele said the woman had shared every detail of her affair with Yohan, from their meet-ups to intimate photos. The 90 Day Fiancé franchise star added, &#34;She had sex with him for all these years, and she knew he was married.&#34; 




During 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All, Daniele made a new shocking claim that Yohan had cheated on her. She claims he cheated with about 50-60 women throughout their relationship. While Yohan says he never cheated on his wife, she appeared to have all the evidence to prove he did.



 Daniele Gates&#39; New Makeover Is Stunning 

 

Despite experiencing one of her biggest heartbreaks in 2023, Daniele posted a recap of the year on Instagram. She posted pictures wearing a black and white bikini and sporting straight hair while holding a mango. She captioned, &#34;2023, a recap. 2024: My turn.&#34; Daniele looked happier than ever in the beach photos, suggesting that she had healed from the hurt Yohan had caused her.

 Why Daniele Gates&#39; Photos Are Special 
          

Daniele&#39;s latest makeover is different from her regular photos on Instagram. Her beach pictures with the mangoes are particularly noteworthy because they signify one of her wishes. During the last season, Daniele&#39;s friends seemed concerned about her finances. She told her friends not to worry about her because she could eat mangoes and teach a yoga class on the beach. Yohan and Daniele don&#39;t seem to be together in 2023, but at least the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 cast member got to live one of her dreams and share it with her followers on social media.
