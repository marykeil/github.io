## Literature Review
Meet the confirmed cast of 90 Day Fiancé spin-off 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 and discover their past and current storylines before the premiere.




The full cast for 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 has finally been revealed and here’s everything to know about the cast members, including their past and their storylines in the 2024 edition. 90 Day: The Single Life season 1 brought back some of the franchise’s most popular stars in February 2021. These stars joined the show while coming to terms with the end of their former 90 Day Fiancé relationships and were ready to experience being single and looking for love. Big Ed Brown, Daniele Mullins Jbali, and Colt Johnson attempted to let go of their past baggage and navigated the world of first dates and online dating.




The show has had three successful seasons since its launch and has become one of the most anticipated spin-offs over the last two years. Fans are always wondering if their favorite newly single reality TV star will be joining the show in the next season. TLC confirmed season 4 of the spin-off earlier this month and announced that 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 will premiere on Monday, January 1, 2024. The USP of the season is that it’s all about firsts. It will feature first dates, first loves, and first kisses. There will be an island romance straight out of a fantasy novel and relationship ultimatums.

 John McManus 
          

When Thaís Ramone moved to the U.S. on her K-1 visa to get married to Patrick Mendes, she discovered she had to share their house with Patrick’s brother John. Thaís was not a fan of the living arrangement, and she had more than a few altercations with John. John was protective of his brother and apprehensive about Thaís’ intentions. She was cold with John and didn’t like his party-boy attitude, but things changed after Thaís and Patrick got married. Thaís and Patrick seem to be getting along well and fans who wanted to see more of John were more than happy when he was cast in Pillow Talk.




However, there are more reasons for John’s fans to celebrate now that he’s been announced as one of the seven cast members of 90 Day: The Single Life. According to ET, this is the first time that the 40-year-old John’s love life will be chronicled on TV. John will be trying to find a romance for himself after being inspired by his brother’s successful marriage. John will be connecting with a woman in Texas, but a relationship with her comes with three conditions. The woman wants a marriage, and a baby, and insists that John should move to be near her which could sour his relationship with his brother.



 Debbie Aguero 
          

The artsy and free-spirited Debbie was introduced in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. The Sugar Hill resident was dating a Moroccan man named Oussama Berber who was 43 years younger than her. Debbie dreamed of moving to Morocco to get married to Oussama the poet, but once she went there she found out Oussama wanted to come to the U.S. and was most probably using her. In September 2023, Debbie revealed that Oussama now asked to marry her and said that he asked her to come to Morocco and live with him. However, Debbie was no longer interested in Oussama. She wanted him to find a nice girl.




Debbie, 68, now wants to date someone closer to her age. However, she lies about her age and says she’s 10 years younger than she is to her date. Debbie has been bending the truth but also has more things to worry about before starting a new relationship. The men who want to date Debbie will have to be assessed by her police officer, son Julian B Lin, first.



 Tyray Mollett 
          

Tyray had one of the most unfortunate 90 Day Fiancé storylines in Before the 90 Days season 6. Tyray had been in a relationship with a woman named Carmella from Barbados who was a man named Christian who was scamming Tyray for money and mocking him by asking him to send his nudes. Tyray from California has not given up hope after being catfished. He is giving love another shot and taking help from his brothers. Tyray is stepping outside his comfort zone by meeting women in real life and not online, although the woman of his dreams is Hillary Clinton.






 Veronica Rodriguez 

 

Veronica was introduced as Tim’s ex-turned-best friend on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 3. The 90 Day Fiancé twosome were engaged and together for seven years, even though the last two years were tough. They managed to stay friends despite the rough times and Veronica and Tim became inseparable. Their close bond was a major reason why Tim’s then-girlfriend Jeniffer Tarazona often fought with him. However, Tim and Veronica maintained they would never get back together as a couple. After dating two men named Grant Glaser and Justin Foster unsuccessfully, Veronica started hooking up with Kim Menzies’ son, Jamal.

Jamal was certain he didn’t want to be committed to Veronica, 37, at 27, but Veronica seemed to be wanting something more. Things have changed in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 as things are getting serious between Veronica and Jamal. However, they have something to worry about and that is Tim’s ever-looming presence.






 Tim Malcolm 
          

Tim was a side character in Veronica’s storyline in season 3. Veronica had decided not to let Tim interfere in her private matters with Justin. She soon realized her mistake when Justin broke up with her. However, Tim has a strong opinion about Veronica dating Jamal, especially because Jamal has exhibited playboy tendencies. Tim made his dislike for Jamal obvious in the last Tell All and will be getting into an argument with Jamal in season 4. At the same time, Tim has his own story to tell this time around after his split with Colombian girlfriend Linda Ramirez, as he puts himself back out there and looks for love again.



 Chantel Everett 
         




Chantel married Pedro Jimeno on 90DF season 4, six years ago. The couple were madly in love with each other but started growing apart when they got their spin-off, The Family Chantel. Pedro filed for divorce from Chantel in 2022, and they finally walked away from each other in The Family Chantel season 5 as she accepted her future wouldn’t be with Pedro. Now that Chantel has moved on, the 32-year-old is officially single and ready to mingle. Chantel will be taking a girl&#39;s trip to Greece on the show where she is going to let herself loose and find out if she’s open to falling in love again.



 Natalie Mordovtseva 
         

Lastly, joining the 90 Day: The Single Life cast list is Natalie from Ukraine, who moved to the U.S. in 2019 to marry Mike Youngquist. Natalie and Mike’s marriage lasted for less than a year, and she left Sequim to settle in Florida. Natalie met Los Angeles-based modeling agency CEO Josh Weinstein there, but he refused to call her his girlfriend since Natalie was still married to Mike legally. Natalie wanted to move to California herself to start a new career in acting and modeling and to be close to Josh. However, things are not going to go her way in this season either.
