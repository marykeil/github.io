## Literature Review
New details about the milestone Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 premiere reveal the real reason Kelli Giddish is returning as Amanda Rollins. 




Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 premiere details reveal why Kelli Giddish is returning as Amanda Rollins. The Mariska Hargitay-led police procedural is entering its milestone year with a delayed premiere because of the dual Hollywood strikes. Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 will premiere on January 18 and consist of 13 episodes, making for a shorter run than normal.




As previously confirmed, Giddish will reprise her role as Rollins in the Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 premiere. Unlike her return in the latest crossover finale with Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime, her latest appearance on the show comes in much better circumstances, per TVLine&#39;s official synopsis from NBC. Read the full brief below:


“Tunnel Blind” — As the squad celebrates the birth of Rollins and Carisi’s child, another child goes missing in broad daylight.

After more than a decade on the NBC police procedural, Giddish wrapped up her series regular stint on Law &amp; Order: SVU in December 2022. Her exit came unexpectedly, causing scrutiny. Neither Wolf Entertainment nor NBC has provided an official reason for her departure, and it doesn&#39;t seem as though Giddish decided to leave. There were rumors that she was forced out of Law &amp; Order: SVU, but no concrete indication that was the case. Nonetheless, the issue has been drowned out by the fact that she continues to return.




In light of Giddish&#39;s upcoming Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 appearance, it remains to be seen if her regular visits can turn into her reclaiming her series regular role. The long-running show is not new to rotating cast members, with only Hargitay and Ice-T appearing in all of its seasons. That being said, Manhattan&#39;s SVU has been undermanned for quite a while now. Molly Burnett&#39;s departure in Law &amp; Order: SVU&#39;s finale crossover with Organized Crime makes this issue worse and increases the chances of Giddish just returning.

Law &amp; Order: SVU, much like many ensemble shows, thrives on its cast chemistry. It took a while for the show to find Rollins&#39; identity, but once it did, she immediately became a fan favorite. It seems there is really nothing stopping Giddish from coming back, and considering the show&#39;s current status, it may be best to just reinstate her as a regular cast member.



Law &amp; Order: SVU season 25 premieres on Thursday, January 18.
