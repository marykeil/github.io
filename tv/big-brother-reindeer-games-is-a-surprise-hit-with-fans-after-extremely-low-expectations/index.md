## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games wasn&#39;t something fans were interested in at first, but after extremely low expectations, it&#39;s been surprisingly popular.




Big Brother Reindeer Games went into its inaugural season with fans expectations sitting at an all-time low, and many have been pleasantly surprised by the way the series has panned out. After Big Brother 25 was criticized by fans of the series who were hoping to see a more equitable and dynamic season, the expectations for Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 were low. Advertised as being competition-heavy and lacking a social element of the game that many enjoy, fans assumed that BB Reindeer Games was going to be dominated by competitive threats. Most believed that the series would be another steamroll, much like the end of BB 25.




Much to fans&#39; surprise, the new Big Brother Reindeer Games has been one of the most interesting reality TV competitions to come from BB in years. According to fans like u/thereal237 on Reddit, “These first two episodes are amazing television! The competitions are fair so far and the players are playing hard by going after big threats right off the bat! It really feels like it’s anyone’s game.” Others chimed in to agree, like u/allthenviousfeelings who explained, “its the sum of the wildly entertaining cast, faster pace, and lower stakes that makes this so much more light-hearted, fun, and exciting.”

 Will Reindeer Games Help Improve Big Brother’s Image Among Fans? 
          




While there is a buzz surrounding Big Brother Reindeer Games, many are hopeful that the producers behind the original Big Brother will take notice about why fans are enjoying the new series. “I think we all can agree that the comps being overall more equitable (no way Britt’s team wins that comp h2h in traditional BB) is awesome to see,” u/BBSecretAlliance shared on Reddit. Others chimed in as well, sharing their excitement about a BB series having equitable competitions. “A mix of a good cast, a fast pace, equitable comps, and the first boots ending up being pretty favorable that has made this so surprisingly enjoyable so far,” u/YouLikeDadJokes shared.


 

It&#39;s possible that Big Brother Reindeer Games could be helpful in rehabilitating Big Brother’s image, which has been tarnished among fans after years of competition inequity. While the social gameplay and diverse casting has been fascinating in the most recent years of Big Brother, the number of inequitable BB competitions has led to predictable gameplay and evictions, along with uninteresting power structures staying in place throughout the game. As Big Brother Reindeer Games puts forth some of the most equitable competitions BB fans have seen in years, it will be interesting to see if Big Brother can take cues from the spin-off series.




While Big Brother Reindeer Games still has half of its short season left to air, the reviews fans have been giving the series are surprisingly positive for a BB spin-off series. With dynamic casting, equitable competitions, and a fun level of social strategy, it’s clear that fans are enjoying the product of Big Brother Reindeer Games far more than they’ve enjoyed the seasons in the last few years. As fans consistently ask for a return to “old” Big Brother, it’s possible that Big Brother Reindeer Games has proven that future seasons can be just as fun and dynamic as the favorites of BB fans past.
