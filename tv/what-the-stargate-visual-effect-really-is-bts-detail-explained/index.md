# What The Stargate Visual Effect Really Is (BTS Detail Explained)


## SUMMARY 



  Stargate&#39;s &#34;kawoosh&#34; visual effect was created using an air cannon and water, making it difficult to replicate.   A Stargate reboot should use the same visual effect instead of CGI to retain the franchise&#39;s loyal fan base.   Recreating the effect would be risky due to the unpredictability of water variables.

## Literature Review
One behind-the-scenes detail reveals how the visual effects team created the iconic Stargate &#34;kawoosh&#34; that has appeared in every franchise addition.




Stargate&#39;s unstable vortex visual effect, nicknamed the &#34;kawoosh,&#34; was created in a unique way behind the scenes. In 1994, the original Stargate movie came out, starting a vast franchise that includes three movies, four TV series, and one web series. This transmedia franchise is popular 29 years after the debut film due to Stargate’s powerful villains, strong world-building, and unique premise.




Five years after the last addition to the franchise, Stargate needs a reboot, ideally made by Amazon Prime. Like Star Trek and Doctor Who, the Stargate franchise is thematically relevant and appealing to modern audiences. Additionally, there is so much to explore within the world of Stargate, making a potential reboot fresh instead of stale. On top of that, a production team already has the prime visual effect, the “kawoosh,” to tie the movie into the rest of the franchise.

                  Where To Watch Stargate Online   There&#39;s nothing quite like binge-watching Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, and Stargate Universe, and a few streaming platforms have them available.     


 The Stargate&#39;s Visual Effect Is Created By An Air Cannon 
          

According to the 1994 documentary The Making of Stargate the visual effects team from the Stargate movie created the “kawoosh” by suspending an air cannon – a device that uses compressed air to launch a transportation device – one inch above the surface of the water. The team fired off the air, causing the water to propel outward in the memorable manner seen in the Stargate film.




Due to the difficulty of creating this effect, the film only ever shows the “kawoosh” from a single angle. However, the team responsible for Stargate SG-1 took on the challenge of recording this visual from multiple angles. According to the VFX Supervisor, John Gajdexki, they struggled to get the air pressure right but eventually figured it out through trial and error (via The Companion). They did this so perfectly that the imagery became representative of the sci-fi show.



 Any Future Stargate Reboot Should Use The Same Visual Effect (Not CGI) 
          

Because Stargate is a sci-fi show with a cult classic following, anyone rebooting it takes an inherent risk. One way to ensure franchise fans invest in a new show is by keeping the same &#34;kawoosh&#34; visual from the Stargate movies and TV shows. Though CGI can create incredibly lifelike effects, this visual is so iconic that any change would immediately be noticeable. Because of how they created the visual, it would be incredibly challenging to replicate the water movement, texture, shadows, and lights. It&#39;d be better to use the already existing effect that the VFX team painstakingly created for Stargate SG-1.




Theoretically, they could also try to make the effect again using another air cannon and tank of water. Even recreating the effect would be risky, though, because there&#39;s no guarantee that the water would look the same if any variables (e.g., volume, air pressure, dew point) changed. On top of the practicality, using the old &#34;kawoosh&#34; would show deep reverence for the previous Stargate shows.
