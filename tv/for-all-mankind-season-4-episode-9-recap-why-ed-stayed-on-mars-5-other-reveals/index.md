## Literature Review

Summary
 Sergei&#39;s return puts Margo&#39;s life in serious danger and could lead to an international incident. 
 The risky deal with North Korea exposes the plan to steal Goldilocks and jeopardizes Miles&#39; freedom. 
 Sergei&#39;s death, likely ordered by Irina, leaves Margo more isolated and vulnerable than ever before. 


As the Goldilocks heist risks triggering an international incident on Mars, the life of Margo Madison (Wren Schmidt) is placed in serious jeopardy in For All Mankind season 4, episode 9, &#34;Brazil.&#34; The penultimate episode of For All Mankind season 4 picks up a month after the end of episode 8, with Samantha Massey (Tyner Rushing) struggling to replace the discriminator aboard Ranger 2. The asteroid heist masterminded by Dev Ayesa (Edi Gathegi) and Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman) lives or dies on the discriminator being replaced, and they&#39;re quickly running out of time.
While Massey eventually succeeds in replacing the discriminator, it&#39;s only the start of the problems with Dev&#39;s asteroid heist in For All Mankind. A risky deal between Miles Dale (Toby Kebbell), Ed and Lee Jung-Gil (C.S. Lee) to piggyback on the North Korean security cameras sets in motion a fatal chain of events. The deal with the North Koreans also exposes the plan to steal Goldilocks to NASA and Roscosmos, putting Miles&#39; freedom in serious jeopardy. As For All Mankind season 4, episode 9 comes to a shocking conclusion it sets the stage for a nail-biting climax that could change everything for the M-7 nations.
            
 
 &#34;Ocean’s 11 In Space&#34;: For All Mankind Season 4 Finale&#39;s Asteroid Heist Teased By Ed Star 
For All Mankind star Joel Kinnaman teases the season 4 finale&#39;s upcoming asteroid heist, comparing the mission to Ocean&#39;s 11 - but in space.













 








 6  Lee Takes Desperate Action To Hide The Goldilocks Heist From North Korea 
Could his actions cause an international incident?


 







When the North Koreans discover that a NASA communications device has been installed in their sector, they raise their concerns about espionage with Danielle Poole (Krys Marshall). After investigating the device&#39;s serial number, Danielle discovers the vast amount of communications technology stolen to build the covert ops center in one of Happy Valley&#39;s sublevels. While NASA and Roscosmos still don&#39;t know which For All Mankind characters are plotting to hijack the Goldilocks capture mission, the North Korean commander embarks on his own investigation. Following Miles on CCTV, he eventually uncovers the ops center, before being attacked by fellow North Korean, Lee.
As Lee and Commander Cho struggle, the Helios workers come out to check on the commotion. Amidst the struggle, Commander Cho attacks Gerardo, choking the Helios worker until Lee regains his strength and saves the man. Unfortunately, Lee is forced to choke out his commander, leaving him unconscious, or possibly worse, on the floor outside the covert ops center. Given the increased security, it will be nigh on impossible to make Commander Cho disappear, leaving Lee and the Helios workers with a huge dilemma in the For All Mankind season 4 finale.





 5  Sergei Is Murdered By An Unknown Assassin 
Was Sergei&#39;s death ordered by Irina?


 







After their emotional reunion in the last episode, Margo and Sergei Nikulov (Piotr Adamczyk) make tentative plans for their future in For All Mankind season 4, episode 9. Sergei promises that they could get jobs working for the Brazilian space program, along with international protection. Tragically, Margo and Sergei&#39;s dreams of building Brazil into a formidable space nation will remain just that, after the episode&#39;s brutal climax. As Margo and Sergei enjoy hamburgers in their respective hotel rooms, an unknown assailant puts a bullet in the side of Sergei&#39;s head, killing him.
Sergei&#39;s death had likely been ordered by Irina Morozova (Svetlana Efremova), his former KGB handler and new director of Roscosmos. Sergei revealed in For All Mankind season 4, episode 8 that it was Irina who had engineered the situation that resulted in Margo&#39;s defection to the Soviet Union. It would make sense, therefore, for Irina to block Margo&#39;s only means of escape by having Sergei killed. Sergei&#39;s death is staged as a suicide, but it&#39;s highly unlikely that Margo will believe this, given the plans that they had made together. With her strongest ally now dead, Margo is more isolated than ever ahead of the For All Mankind season 4 finale.





 4  Aleida Continues To Help Margo And Sergei 
Is her family now in danger?
        

After a month of passing notes between Margo and Sergei, Aleida Rosales (Coral Peña) facilitates an in-person meeting between the two at her home. Discussing the intricacies of the asteroid capture mission over dinner with Aleida&#39;s family while a KGB agent waits outside is incredibly risky. Given that Sergei is murdered in the closing moments of For All Mankind season 4, episode 9, it doesn&#39;t bode well for Aleida and her family in the finale. While Aleida&#39;s status as an American citizen should protect her from direct action from the KGB, there could be more insidious reprisals for her facilitating a meeting between America&#39;s greatest traitor, Margo Madison, and Soviet defector Sergei Nikulov.





 3  Kelly Is Suspicious Of Ed And Dev&#39;s  ness 
She doesn&#39;t understand why the former enemies are working together.


 







The North Koreans aren&#39;t the only ones who are harboring suspicions about what&#39;s going on in Happy Valley. Kelly Baldwin (Cynthy Wu) is suspicious about how close Ed and Dev have become in the past month and confronts the Helios founder about it. When Dev abruptly leaves a briefing about her potentially successful search for life on Mars, Kelly directly asks him about the change in Dev&#39;s relationship with her father. Dev explains that Ed&#39;s expertise is invaluable during the asteroid capture mission, despite Ed being removed from the mission by Danielle before Kelly&#39;s arrival. Kelly isn&#39;t satisfied by this explanation, and later confronts Ed about his working relationship with Dev, leading to revelations about why her father stayed on Mars.





 2  Ed Finally Reveals Why He Stayed On Mars 
He didn&#39;t want to end up in a nursing home on Earth.
        

What&#39;s wrong with Ed Baldwin has been one of the big questions of For All Mankind season 4. In episode 9, &#34;Brazil&#34;, Ed finally reveals why he stayed on Mars in an emotional heart-to-heart with Kelly. He confirms what many have suspected, that he stayed on Mars because he knew that he would never be able to return due to his advancing years. Describing to Kelly how Gordo&#39;s father&#39;s physical and mental health declined until he no longer resembled the tough military man, explains why Ed had refused to accept retirement. Telling his daughter that returning to Earth would see him sent to a nursing home, Ed Baldwin has remained on Mars to build an enduring legacy.
Happy Valley represents the future of humankind among the stars, and Ed harbors the hope that his grandson, Alex, and his children can make a life there. It&#39;s why Ed has staunchly refused to let the Goldilocks asteroid go to Earth because he knows that it will guarantee that the M-7 nations will stop funding Happy Valley. This chimes with what Sergei says to Margo and Aleida earlier in the episode when he claims that the Soviet Union will use the asteroid to line their pockets rather than fund the next phase of space exploration. Despite his questionable methods, Ed has good intentions, and now that he and Kelly are on the same page, he can hopefully begin to build his legacy.





 1  Miles Is Arrested And Tortured By US And Soviet Intelligence 
Will he expose the Goldilocks heist to the authorities?
        

Toby Kebbell&#39;s Miles Dale becomes the lead suspect in the theft of the communications equipment, thanks to his role in Happy Valley&#39;s black market. When Danielle informs NASA director Eli Hobson (Daniel Stern) about the theft, he and Irina authorize the use of the CIA and KGB intelligence assets stationed in Happy Valley. Mike Bishop (Billy Lush) and Timur Avilov are the US and Soviet intelligence assets, respectively, and Danielle tasks them with getting to the bottom of who is plotting to steal Goldilocks. Mike and Timur lure Miles to a locked room, where they interrogate him about the missing communications tech and his role in the heist.
However, it quickly becomes clear that Mike is using Miles as a scapegoat for the Helios strike earlier in For All Mankind season 4. Calling the strikers &#34;terrorists&#34;, Mike metes out brutal revenge for the horrific death of Nick Jennings. It&#39;s clear during the interrogation that nobody suspects the involvement of Ed and Dev, and are instead putting the blame squarely on the embittered strikers. As Miles is strapped to a chair at the end of For All Mankind season 4, episode 9, it will be interesting to see if the opportunistic working-class hero turns on his more privileged co-conspirators for his self-preservation, or protects their anonymity for the future of Mars.
For All Mankind&#39;s season 4 finale streams on AppleTV&#43; on January 12th.
