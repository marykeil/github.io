## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Natalie Mordovtseva&#39;s dreams have been crushed by Josh Weinstein despite her moving all the way to L.A. to be with him.




Things aren’t going well between Natalie Mordovtseva and Josh Weinstein in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 after he lets her know he’s not ready to support her financially in the relationship. Natalie, 39, came to the U.S. on a K-1 visa to marry Mike Youngquist in 2019. She had previously admitted that she was not in love with Mike and left the marriage within eight months to move to Florida, where she met Josh. Natalie expected Josh, the CEO of a modeling agency in Los Angeles, to help her with her modeling and acting dreams. Natalie relocated to California to be close to him.




However, Josh is not showing Natalie signs of being interested in her, as revealed in a preview for The Single Life season 4, episode 2, courtesy of People. Natalie and Josh are apartment hunting in Los Angeles and are looking at a one-bedroom apartment where Natalie could live with her mom. “I feel okay about this place, I realize this area is good. And my first thought, can I afford for the money I have?” Natalie asks. She’d have to pay $2,150 in rent, and Natalie is not able to pay for it. She turns to Josh to ask him if he could be her guarantor, but he’s not ready.

 Natalie &amp; Josh&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          




Natalie knows that rent in L.A. is “crazy expensive,” even for a simple, modest place compared to Florida, where she previously lived. Natalie didn’t even have credit. Meanwhile, Josh tells her, “I’d have to see about that.” Natalie asks him, “If we really find something for [a] different price, something suitable, wouldn’t you help us?” However, Josh tells her he isn’t sure and can’t do it “right now.” He adds, “Where we’re at, that we’re ready to have joint anything.” Josh lets Natalie know that he first wants to feel “secure” in their relationship.


 

When 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Natalie met Josh, she realized he was a “wild animal who’s waiting to jump” compared to Mike, a “mama’s boy.” Natalie did not approve of Josh being a father of two with two different women. Her attraction to Josh was too much for her to let him get away. However, Natalie was also very jealous, considering Josh was surrounded by beautiful women at his job. Natalie had wasted four years with Mike, and she also longed to get married again and have a baby. Meanwhile, Josh wanted her to know that he had to spend time with his kids and couldn’t be with Natalie all the time.




Natalie briefly considered going back to Mike when he helped her mom escape her country amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Natalie said she was confused about whether she wanted to be with Mike or date Josh during 90 Day: The Single Life season 3. Josh didn’t want to be with a woman who was still married, but he is still with Natalie in The Single Life season 4. Even if he’s not ready to help her with money, he continues to date her. It remains to be seen if Josh will eventually give in to her demands and pay for her new home while helping her get a stable job.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
