Summary

  Chae-ok&#39;s death is revealed to be a misdirection, with the final scene showing her brought back to life by her mother&#39;s powers. The detective may now become a monster herself.   The post-credits scene in Gyeongseong Creature episode 10 takes the show over 60 years into the future, setting up a second season in modern-day Seoul and introducing a character played by Park Seo-joon who may or not be Tae-sang.   Tae-sang&#39;s unchanged appearance in the modern-day raises questions about his possible transformation or special powers, possibly acquired through the contaminated water from episode 7. Lady Maeda&#39;s survival and her connection with Chae-ok&#39;s mother are also left open-ended.  







Gyeongseong Creature season 1’s finale has multiple cliffhangers, including a post-credits scene that changes everything about the stories of Chae-ok and Tae-sang. The newest Netflix Korean drama was split into two parts, with the first ending after Chae-ok and most of the hospital prisoners escaped. Gyeongseong Creature Part 2 picked up right from where episode 7 left off, and it ended with the Ongseong Hospital&#39;s destruction ahead of the end of the Japanese colonial rule over Korea in August 1945.

Gyeongseong Creature Part 2 confirmed that Lady Maeda was behind it all. Not only did she provide the Ongseong Hospital and the military with the funds they needed to conduct the experiments, but she also picked test subjects for them. Lady Maeda got Myeong-ja sent to the hospital, just like she arranged for Chae-ok’s mother to be captured and turned into a test subject years ago. Gyeongseong Creature season 1 ends with Chae-ok and Tae-sang fighting dozens of Lady Maeda’s henchmen, with Chae-ok seemingly dying from her wounds. Tae-sang finally used his money to help the revolution, and a surprising time skip brought the period K-drama show to the modern world.

 Did Chae-ok Die In Gyeongseong Creature? 
         

Gyeongseong Creature episode 10’s ending reveals that Chae-ok did not die, or at least that she died but has now been brought back to life. The episode initially strongly suggested that Chae-ok had died after she was injured by both Lady Maeda’s henchmen and the monster. Chae-ok, who was already hurt and bleeding from the fight, put herself between her mother and Tae-sang to prevent the monster from killing him. As a result, Chae-ok’s mother, who could somewhat recognize her daughter but could barely control her own actions, ended up attacking Chae-ok. Considering the amount of lethal wounds she had, it was unreasonable to believe Chae-ok could have survived.




However, Gyeongseong Creature season 1’s finale ends with Chae-ok at the bottom of what seems to be a lake as she is healed or resurrected by her mother. There are a lot of mysteries surrounding the monster originating from the Najin, meaning that it is not too far-fetched to assume the creature can use its powers to heal people. Chae-ok’s mother may have transferred her energy or life essence to her daughter, thus bringing Han Soo-hee’s character back to life. The problem is that this process also involved the Najin organism going from the creature to Chae-ok, meaning the detective may become a monster now.



 Gyeongseong Creature’s Post-Credits Scene Explained 
          

Gyeongseong Creature episode 10 includes a post-credits featuring a massive plot twist that changes everything about the show, including the possibility of a second season. Although the episode itself included a brief time jump to show what a post-Japanese surrender Gyeongseong looked like, the post-credits scene flashes forward to decades into the future. Key events in Korea’s history were shown on television, in color, including scenes from the 2000s. In order words, Gyeongseong Creature’s post-credits scene takes place more than 60 years later. A modern Gyeongseong, now South Korea’s capital Seoul, is shown from the window as a man played by Park Seo-joon appears.




Park Seo-joon’s character is referred to as “Ho-jae” rather than Tae-sang, but the way the scene plays out suggests that is the same character audiences have been following since episode 1. Gyeongseong Creature’s time jump cliffhanger is game-changing for the show, and it sets up a completely different season 2 set in modern-day Seoul. Multi-generation stories are nothing new in K-drama shows, but a TV series flashforwarding to more than 60 years into the future at the end of season 1 is very surprising. Considering Kato was alive by the end of the episode, the Najin experiments might have continued for decades.



 How Is Tae-sang Still Alive Decades Later? 
          

The biggest question surrounding Gyeongseong Creature’s finale is how Tae-sang can be alive and look the same so many decades later. Naturally, the possibility that Park Seo-joon is playing an entirely different character who is related to Tae-sang and thus look like him cannot be ruled out. Ho-jae can be the grandson of Tae-sang, and Gyeongseong Creature season 2 could be about a new generation of the family facing new monsters. However, given that a scar on the neck of the character was shown, this may very well be Tae-sang. This would mean Tae-sang now has some kind of special powers.

Gyeongseong Creature Part 2 never revealed who drank the glass of water, as Myeong-ja was already infected and would transform regardless. If Tae-sang drank the contaminated water he may have acquired the abilities of the creature without fully transforming. In order words, Tae-sang would now be immortal. Even if Tae-sang did not drink it, something could still have happened in the following months that ended with him getting infected. Either way, the scar around the neck suggests a transformation or surgery, which would explain why Tae-sang looks the same in modern-day Seoul as he did in 1945.



 How Did Lady Maeda Survive? 
          




Lady Maeda did not die in Gyeongseong Creature’s finale, a surprising outcome considering she was right in front of the bomb when it exploded. Although this could be just a plot convenience – the famous “plot armor,” – Lady Maeda might have been rescued and treated by Kato. Lieutenant Kato is fascinated with the possibilities of the human organism, which means he might have used his skills and equipment to save Lady Maeda’s life. Additionally, Kato may have used the Najin to prevent her from dying, thus giving Maeda powers in the process. The glass of water next to her could be a symbolical way of showing she is now infected too.



 What Happened To Myeong-ja’s Baby 
          

Kato performed surgery on Myeong-ja, who gave birth to a child before she died. Given that Myeong-ja was slowly turning into a monster by the time she gave birth, it is safe to say the child inherited the genetic material associated with the Najin. Kato now has the child, and they could be the first of many new test subjects in his twisted research about the Najin. Whether a grown-up version of that child will appear in a potential Gyeongseong Creature season 2 remains to be seen. Assuming infected people and monsters do not age normally, Myeong-ja’s child could be an important character in the modern-day setting.






 How Gyeongseong Creature Season 1’s Finale Sets Up Season 2 
          

Gyeongseong Creature season 1’s finale included two major cliffhangers that make season 2 very likely. As of the writing of this article, Gyeongseong Creature season 2 has not been confirmed. However, from a story perspective, season 1’s ending asks for a sequel. There is now a 60-year gap between episode 10’s ending and the post-credits scene for Gyeongseong Creature to address, and not having a follow-up to such a massive cliffhanger would be disappointing. Having Gyeongseong Creature season 2 set in modern-day Seoul after the first season’s period piece story would be a very innovative way to continue the show.

Even without considering Gyeongseong Creature episode 10’s post-credits scene, the show left a lot of questions unanswered. It is still unclear when and how Chae-ok was brought back to life, as Tae-sang was holding her dead body in his arms in front of the monster. Tae-sang seemed very sad at the end of season 1, meaning he most likely did not know Chae-ok was alive. The immediate consequences of Lady Maeda’s return, the birth of Myeong-ja’s baby, and how Maeda is tied to Chaeo-ok’s mother are also points that need to be addressed in Gyeongseong Creature season 2. Lastly, whether Chae-ok is also alive during the present day remains to be seen.






Gyeongseong Creature is streaming on Netflix.
