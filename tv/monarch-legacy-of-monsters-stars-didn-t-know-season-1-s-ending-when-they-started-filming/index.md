## Literature Review
Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters&#39; biggest stars didn&#39;t actually know how season 1 was going to end until partway through the filming process.




When they first started filming, even the cast of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters didn&#39;t know where the show was going. The sixth installment of Legendary&#39;s Monsterverse, Monarch focuses on the human reaction to the kaiju attack in 2014&#39;s Godzilla. A band of humans come together to connect with Monarch, a group that investigates kaiju. Across the 10-episode season 1, they encounter multiple Titans, including Godzilla himself.




The future of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters remains clouded. For the actors, that&#39;s nothing new. In an interview with Yahoo News, Anna Sawai (Cate Randa) explained that the collaborative production environment meant that the actors were often left to unravel the plot themselves. Check out her quote below:


Sawai: We were consistently having meetings, sitting down and talking about where the character should go. I think it&#39;s amazing because I&#39;m pretty used to her getting a script, knowing how it was going to end going into the first day of shooting, but this one they told me, &#34;We want to get to know the actors and we want to bring the characters to life through them.&#34; So I didn&#39;t know how the story was going to progress and it was just amazing to see that they were so willing to talk about it with us.


In a separate interview with The Wrap, Wyatt Russell (Lee Shaw) was asked about why Lee looked young at an &#34;advanced age&#34;, and incidentally agreed with Sawai. He explained that they never actually knew where each episode was going.





Russell: The explanation was that the difficulty was not knowing what was going to happen. I could say almost everything I’ve done, except maybe one other television show, I’ve known what the end of the show is. This was like not only do we not know what the end of the show is, we don’t know what episode six is. And so you’re like, “Okay, we have to drive the vehicle somewhere. Where are we driving the vehicle?” Because I can’t be left out in the cold going like…



 Will There Be A Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Season 2? 
          

Because the show&#39;s structure was split between the past and present, season 1 had an odd timeline that left even the actors confused at times. With the Monarch cast and crew never quite knowing how the show would end until they had already filmed it, every episode was as surprising for viewers as it was for the cast. If there is a season 2, the collaborative environment would likely continue, given its success in developing season 1. The question, however, is whether there will ever be a season 2.




Monarch: Legacy of Monsters season 1 just ended, meaning that ratings numbers are still coming in for AppleTV&#43;. Because of that, it will take some time to get word on whether a follow-up season is on the way. Developing a season 2 could be difficult since audiences will likely expect more monsters in a season 2. Putting together well-rendered Titans on a TV-level budget is always a challenge, and though season 1 successfully managed it, they did focus more on the human drama than monster battles. If the series is regarded as profitable by AppleTV&#43;, however, season 2 is not out of the realm of possibility.



The MonsterVerse movies and shows include Godzilla (2014), Kong: Skull Island (2017), Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), Skull Island (2023), Monarch: Legacy of Monsters (2023), and the yet-to-be-released Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024)




Monarch is inherently tied to the MonsterVerse. That connection means that AppleTV&#43; can use the show as a means of drawing loyal Godzilla viewers to the platform by tying into Legendary&#39;s projects. With Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire releasing domestically on March 29, Apple may elect to see if the release brings new viewers for the show. If ratings continue to rise, a season 2 is likely. Regardless, the cast of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters will need to be involved in shaping any future seasons.
