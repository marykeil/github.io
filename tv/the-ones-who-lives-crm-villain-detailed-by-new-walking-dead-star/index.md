## Literature Review
The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live star Terry O&#39;Quinn reveals new details about his villain, Major General Beale, and his role in the CRM.




The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live star Terry O&#39;Quinn has revealed more details about his villain character, Major General Beale, and his role in the CRM. The character was first hinted at in a previous zombie spinoff, World Beyond, where it was implied he held a key leadership position within the group.




Speaking with Entertainment Weekly ahead of The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live&#39;s release, O&#39;Quinn revealed key details about Beale and his role in the upcoming spinoff. The actor explained how his pre-apocalypse experience in war makes him a key component of the CRM, with thousands of soldiers under his command. Check out what O&#39;Quinn had to say below:


He is the leader of the Civic Republic military and it operates pretty independently of the Civic Republic government. So he doesn&#39;t really have to deal with them very much. And he&#39;s held in high esteem. He&#39;s kind of a hero. He has a long military history. He served two terms in Vietnam and went to officer training school. And he&#39;s had to make some decisions in terms of who lives and who dies and how to deal with the mass of walking dead.
He has a big army, but he has about 2,000 of his front liners. They&#39;re his elite corps and they do most of the work, be it dirty or not dirty. He makes decisions based on what he thinks will help his community survive. And it&#39;s completely that he&#39;s trying to make sure that this city survives, so he makes some tough decisions.






 How Major General Beale Poses A Threat To Rick &amp; Michonne 
          

During The Walking Dead series finale ending, it was revealed Rick hasn&#39;t come home yet because he is currently being held captive by the CRM. The new spinoff will see Michonne trying to rescue him, with the massive group of survivors being portrayed as the series&#39; antagonists. This means Beale will be a new villain for the duo to contend with, no doubt posing a key threat to the escape mission.

Given the number of soldiers O&#39;Quinn confirmed are at his disposal, the Major General could easily utilize an insurmountable force to keep the show&#39;s heroes from leaving. His reasoning would likely be to keep outside survivors from knowing the CRM exists, a group motivation previously established in Fear the Walking Dead. Rick and Michonne&#39;s lives will be in danger if they try to run, possibly cornering them into fighting back.




Beale is just one of many exciting expectations for The Ones Who Live, which will also feature the return of Pollyanna McIntosh as Jadis. Perhaps the Major General&#39;s story will tie together with hers, given the pair are both part of the CRM. With a six-episode season on its way, it remains to be seen just how large a threat the new villain is going to be to the series&#39; major survivors.



The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live begins on AMC and AMC&#43; February 25, 2024.
