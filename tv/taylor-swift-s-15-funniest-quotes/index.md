## Literature Review
Swift is known for her sparkling wit and sense of humor which is on display during her red carpet appearances, interviews, concerts, and documentaries




Funny Taylor Swift quotes aren&#39;t always the first thing people think of when talking about her, but Swifties can attest to her being hilarious. Swift is best known not just for being a hitmaker, but for being the only female solo artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year three times. These Grammys are for Fearless in 2009, 1989 in 2015, and Folklore in 2020. It&#39;s not just Swift&#39;s music that&#39;s behind the passion of her fans though, as her endearing personality is also part of the winning formula that turns listeners into Swifties — as the funniest Taylor Swift quotes show.




Whether she&#39;s making documentaries like Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, or just hanging out on the red carpet, Swift&#39;s sparkling wit shines through. Even when Taylor Swift isn&#39;t singing on the mic during her live tours, there&#39;s never a dull moment for audiences. Not content with already being a songwriting genius in several genres and having the voice of an angel, Swift consistently finds opportunities to give standup comics a run for their money. It&#39;s great because, apart from being funny, her jokes and one-liners can also sometimes give Swifties more insight into her mindset and creative process.

                  Every Taylor Swift Movie, Ranked According To Rotten Tomatoes   When she&#39;s not busy being the biggest pop star in the world, Taylor Swift can be found at your local cinema in feature-length films.

Taylor Swift To Ellen DeGeneres
         




A mastermind in the business of Easter Eggs, Taylor Swift unwittingly got pulled into a whole franchise by mere chance. The time that she was releasing her album Reputation coincided with the release period of Avengers: Endgame, and audiences made a hilarious connection between the Marvel movie and the songstress. During her Ellen interview, Swift discussed how she was hailed as the next vanquisher of Thanos because she had a new song called &#34;End Game.&#34; She quipped about letting people down again because she was not the superhero people thought she was.

From The Taylor Swift &#39;Folklore&#39; Documentary
          




Swifties get to delve into the true meaning of each Folklore song in the documentary Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. As usual, Swift&#39;s funny side made an appearance when she discussed &#34;Seven&#34; with her co-writers and producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner. She misses the way kids are allowed to scream, stomp, and throw tantrums because she feels like doing that even more as an adult (but she isn&#39;t allowed to). Her childlike side came through, showing her perspective on rules and societal expectations. Not only is it funny, but it&#39;s also one of the most relatable Taylor Swift quotes.

On The Tonight Show, she giggled her way through the interview as she told Jimmy Fallon that if she had to throw a bash for the writers of &#34;Lover,&#34; she would be the only person in the room since she usually writes by herself.

She believed that sea urchins could fatally impale her to the extent of losing her limbs, and this ridiculous thought came through amusingly.
