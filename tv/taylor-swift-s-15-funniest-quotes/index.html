  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Taylor Swift hilariously jokes about being hailed as a superhero and letting people down for not defeating Thanos with her song &ldquo;End Game.&rdquo;   Swift&rsquo;s funny side shines through as she discusses her desire to throw tantrums like kids and her relatable perspective on rules and societal expectations.   Swift&rsquo;s amusing remarks about being the sole songwriter in her music and her sarcastic take on paparazzi capture her witty and lighthearted personality.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Swift is known for her sparkling wit and sense of humor which is on display during her red carpet appearances, interviews, concerts, and documentaries</p>
<p>Funny Taylor Swift quotes aren&rsquo;t always the first thing people think of when talking about her, but Swifties can attest to her being hilarious. Swift is best known not just for being a hitmaker, but for being the only female solo artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year three times. These Grammys are for Fearless in 2009, 1989 in 2015, and Folklore in 2020. It&rsquo;s not just Swift&rsquo;s music that&rsquo;s behind the passion of her fans though, as her endearing personality is also part of the winning formula that turns listeners into Swifties — as the funniest Taylor Swift quotes show.</p>
<p>Whether she&rsquo;s making documentaries like Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, or just hanging out on the red carpet, Swift&rsquo;s sparkling wit shines through. Even when Taylor Swift isn&rsquo;t singing on the mic during her live tours, there&rsquo;s never a dull moment for audiences. Not content with already being a songwriting genius in several genres and having the voice of an angel, Swift consistently finds opportunities to give standup comics a run for their money. It&rsquo;s great because, apart from being funny, her jokes and one-liners can also sometimes give Swifties more insight into her mindset and creative process.</p>
<pre><code>              Every Taylor Swift Movie, Ranked According To Rotten Tomatoes   When she's not busy being the biggest pop star in the world, Taylor Swift can be found at your local cinema in feature-length films.

<p>“They Were Like Oh My God She’s Going To Defeat Thanos. I Let Everyone Down… Again!”
Taylor Swift To Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>A mastermind in the business of Easter Eggs, Taylor Swift unwittingly got pulled into a whole franchise by mere chance. The time that she was releasing her album Reputation coincided with the release period of Avengers: Endgame, and audiences made a hilarious connection between the Marvel movie and the songstress. During her Ellen interview, Swift discussed how she was hailed as the next vanquisher of Thanos because she had a new song called &ldquo;End Game.&rdquo; She quipped about letting people down again because she was not the superhero people thought she was.</p>
<p>“When I See A Kid Throwing A Massive Tantrum In A Grocery Store, Part Of Me Is Like &lsquo;Man I Feel You.&rsquo;”
From The Taylor Swift &lsquo;Folklore&rsquo; Documentary</p>
<p>Swifties get to delve into the true meaning of each Folklore song in the documentary Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. As usual, Swift&rsquo;s funny side made an appearance when she discussed &ldquo;Seven&rdquo; with her co-writers and producers Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner. She misses the way kids are allowed to scream, stomp, and throw tantrums because she feels like doing that even more as an adult (but she isn&rsquo;t allowed to). Her childlike side came through, showing her perspective on rules and societal expectations. Not only is it funny, but it&rsquo;s also one of the most relatable Taylor Swift quotes.</p>
<p>“I Find It Funny Thinking About If I Were To Have A Party For All The Songwriters On That Song&quot;
On The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah Because It Would Just Be Me.”</p>
<p>As audiences hear more of Taylor Swift&rsquo;s rerecorded songs, it becomes clearer that she is pretty much a one-woman show. Her producers are fantastic, but she takes great pride in the fact that she writes almost all her songs solo — and has an amusing way of expressing her songwriting skills. On The Tonight Show, she giggled her way through the interview as she told Jimmy Fallon that if she had to throw a bash for the writers of &ldquo;Lover,&rdquo; she would be the only person in the room since she usually writes by herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I Don’t Like Sea Urchins.”
Taylor Swift Talking To Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>“You Could Lose Your Hand, You Could Lose Your Foot. You Could Lose Your Hand Getting It Off Your Foot!</p>
<p>Everyone has irrational fears, but Taylor Swift&rsquo;s rant about how terrified she was of sea urchins made audiences roar with laughter. She believed that sea urchins could fatally impale her to the extent of losing her limbs, and this ridiculous thought came through amusingly. Even as Ellen DeGeneres tried to explain to her how the creatures could be dangerous, but not to the point of losing her arms and legs, Taylor remained adamant about her fear and dislike of the sea animals. This is one of those funny Taylor Swift quotes that shows how seriously she takes many of her fears.</p>
<p>“This Is A Song About A Guy Who Made The Choice To Cheat On Me, And Probably Shouldn’t Have Because I Write Songs!”
Taylor Swift In Concert</p>
<p>Like many other singer-songwriters, Taylor Swift has written about her past loves, break-ups, and more. She also owns her desire to write about her romantic liaisons cleverly, by asserting in her concerts that her love interests will be written about whether they like it or not. She loves sharing anecdotes about her life, and her storytelling is flawless and funny. Swifties got to hear a bit about her life on one of her earlier tours with her usual funny flair. In terms of funny Taylor Swift quotes about her exes, this one is harsh, but it&rsquo;s also a fair warning to her future lovers.</p>
<p>“I’m Not Asleep. My Mind Is Alive!”
Taylor Swift In A Video Her Mother Released</p>
<p>In a twist of events, Taylor Swift&rsquo;s mother decided to prank her by releasing a private but extremely comical video of her post-Lasik surgery, to Jimmy Fallon. The talk show host then aired this to the entire world, in which an extremely loopy Taylor cried over bananas not having heads. She then lay down on her bed to eat a banana, and when her mother cautioned her against sleeping, she famously proclaimed, &ldquo;My mind is alive!&rdquo; For gifting viewers with the joy of a loopy Taylor exclaiming nonsense, this is one of those Taylor Swift quotes that will live on in infamy.</p>

<p>“So He Calls Me Up And He’s Like &lsquo;I Still Love You&rsquo;”
Taylor Swift At The Grammys</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I’m Like &lsquo;I’m Sorry, I’m Busy Opening Up The Grammys And We Are Never Getting Back Together. Like Ever.&rsquo;”</p>
<p>Speaking of funny Taylor Swift quotes, here&rsquo;s a blistering one that at least one person will never, ever forget. The three-time Album Of The Year Grammy winner loves making bold statements, and her fans love her for it. Like other people, she&rsquo;s had her fair share of woes in the romance department, but her way of combating these things is to be her lighthearted self, on the world stage at the Grammys. She altered her famous song to include the fact that while her ex stayed confused and oscillated between hot and cold in their relationship, she chose to move on and perform at music&rsquo;s biggest night.</p>
<p>“Happy National Snake Day! My Favorite Day Of The Year!”
Taylor Swift In Concert</p>
<p>After feuding with Kim Kardashian over allegedly giving her permission to use a lyric in a song (via BBC), Swift went into hiding from the internet backlash. However, when she returned, she was stronger than ever. The snake was something that she had been bullied with, but she reclaimed it as her own and made it her icon for Reputation. In Swiftian fashion, she kept one of her tour dates on National Snake Day, and proudly claimed that it was her favorite day of the year as she sang her famous comeback song &ldquo;Look What You Made Me Do.&rdquo; Now, Kim and her daughter dance to Taylor Swift music.</p>
<p>“Passive Aggressive? Petty? Why Did She Do That? What…&rdquo;
Taylor Swift In A BBC 1 Interview</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Is She Greeting Us? Who Is She Greeting? She Greeted Us Too Soon. She Greeted Us Too Late! She Greeted Us With A Weird Undertone…”</p>
<p>In a moment of total spontaneity, Taylor Swift shot off this quote in a BBC 1 interview when the interviewer spoke about how her saying a simple &ldquo;hello&rdquo; can make waves in the whole world. Swift funnily imitated her haters, who would question even her tiny hello on Twitter. Even though her delivery was hilarious and on point, she accurately spoke about how women in general are perceived in the media and scrutinized for the smallest actions in a big way. It&rsquo;s one of the funniest Taylor Swift quotes, but it&rsquo;s also packed with real wisdom from the worldly star.</p>

<p>“We Will Breathe In, Breathe Through, Breathe Deep, And Breathe Out.&rdquo;
Taylor Swift In Her NYU Commencement Speech</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Am A Doctor Now, So I Know How Breathing Works”</p>
<p>One of Taylor Swift&rsquo;s biggest achievements to date has been her Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts bestowed on her by NYU. Although some might have expected that music and global icon Taylor Swift would give a serious commencement address after she had been awarded such an honor (via CBS News), fans were more than delighted when she decided to go with a humorous approach. She was very proud of being a Doctor but managed to make light of even this massive feat by joking about breathing through the tough stuff. Even during her sage commencement speech, she managed to be funny and relatable to the thousands of students around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Look Up And There&rsquo;s Four Paparazzi At The Gate. Snap, snap, snappin&rsquo;. Cutest outfit ever.&rdquo;
Taylor Swift In A Promo Shoot For Speak Now</p>
<p>Swifties couldn&rsquo;t agree more that Taylor Swift wore the &ldquo;cutest outfit ever&rdquo; when she sported an oversized red basketball jersey to promote the vinyl release of Speak Now (Taylor&rsquo;s Version) on Target. However, in this behind-the-scenes peek at the shoot for the promo, Swift sarcastically complained about being spotted by paparazzi while wearing an unflattering ensemble that&rsquo;s several sizes too large. The presence of paparazzi is a constant issue for celebrities like Swift, and this is one of the funny Taylor Swift quotes for showing how she approaches it with humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Out Of My House!&rdquo;
Taylor Swift In The &ldquo;Look What You Made Me Do&rdquo; Video</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate you! Get out of my house!&rdquo; screams Taylor during the making of the music video for &ldquo;Look What You Made Me Do.&rdquo; It gets better when Taylor Swift explains it in the behind-the-scenes video, saying that she&rsquo;s &ldquo;not sure where that came from. I have no experience with home invasion. But you know, you just gotta follow the muse.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s one of the greatest Taylor Swift quotes not just for giving viewers a small peek at her creative process, but also because of how she said it with so much rage and conviction, even though she revealed it was just a random quip she snatched from thin air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This One Even Comes With A Phone, So He Can Break Up With Other Girls&rdquo;
Taylor Swift On MySpace</p>
<p>The youngest Swifties might not remember the time Taylor Swift posted a video of herself on her MySpace account, holding a Joe Jonas doll and making some astute observations to go with the quotes. However, Millennial Swifties remember this moment all too well. To be fair, Swift has since admitted on a memorable Ellen guest appearance that calling out Joe Jonas for breaking up with her in a 25-second phone call in 2008 was &ldquo;too much.&rdquo; With respect to Joe, this is just one of those funny Taylor Swift quotes that will forever live on in infamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Guys, It&rsquo;s Dibbles!&rdquo;
Taylor Swift To Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>In one of her many Ellen interviews, Taylor Swift explains how her cat has two names. &ldquo;In the house, it&rsquo;s Dibbles, because it suits her personality more. She&rsquo;s like a scrappy little cat, so, her name is like, Olivia. But it&rsquo;s like, her personality&rsquo;s more like, &lsquo;Hey guys, it&rsquo;s Dibbles!&rdquo; The best part is how Swift switches her voice to sound like a silly character while doing her impression of Dibbles, also known as Olivia. A short but sweet look into Taylor&rsquo;s relationship with her cat at home, this funny bit is also one of the most adorable Taylor Swift quotes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Think For Me, Um&hellip;&rdquo;
A Line Used In Countless Taylor Swift Interviews</p>
<p>Out of all the funny Taylor Swift quotes, this one is the most repeated, not just by Swifties, but by Taylor herself. Even when she tried, Swift could never really shake off saying &ldquo;I think for me, um,&rdquo; before she goes into almost any explanation. Whether in interviews, onstage, or behind-the-scenes footage, she&rsquo;s bound to drop this line. Swifties continue to tease her about it, but it&rsquo;s all good fun, and Swift herself has since given up on fixing something that isn&rsquo;t broken. The phrase has become somewhat of a trademark for the star, and it&rsquo;s these little quirks that remind people that Taylor Swift is still human, after all.</p>
