## SUMMARY 



  Fans are hoping for a second chance season of Big Brother with past houseguests instead of a season featuring BB legends.   Some legendary players, like Janelle Pierzina and Dan Gheesling, have expressed that they likely won&#39;t return to the game.   A second chance season would allow houseguests to improve on their game strategies and level the playing field for all contestants.

## Literature Review
Big Brother&#39;s upcoming winter season was alleged to be legends, but should be a season of second chances for veterans to return to the house.




Big Brother 25 is coming to an end, but there are already rumblings about what to expect from the upcoming winter season of the series and some are hoping to see a second chance for some past houseguests. While many have anticipated the winter season of Big Brother won’t be another season of Celebrity Big Brother, some are hopeful to see a cast of BB legends return to the series for another shot at the grand prize. While an all-winners season of Big Brother was the original prediction for the winter season, Julie Chen Moonves recently explained that the series would be taking a different route without confirming anything major.




As viewers have noticed, the series has been moving away from inviting past houseguests back to compete again on Big Brother. For years in the 2010’s, there were seasons upon seasons of Big Brother where players who had fallen short of the final prize made their way back to the BB house for another chance. Some, like Big Brother 18’s Nicole Franzel, came back and won the game while others, like BB 19’s Paul Abrahamian, didn’t. With many players hoping to get another shot at the game, some are hopeful to see a season of second chances instead of legends.


 Some Big Brother Legends Have Said They Won&#39;t Return To The Game 
          

Although some legends would be excited to return to the BB house for another chance at the grand prize, others have shared that they’re not interested in playing the game again. Players who many viewers feel a legends season would be incomplete without, like Janelle Pierzina and Dan Gheesling, have shared that their time to play Big Brother has more than likely passed. While a legends season with the likes of Rachel Reilly would be great to see, if many of the desired legends are missing from the season, a game of second chances may prove to bring in a more interesting group of houseguests.






 Some Of The Best BB Games Have Come From Second Chance Players 

 

Although it wouldn’t necessarily rule out winners, a second chance season of Big Brother would invite back houseguests who are interested in trying the tough game again. After getting some experience under their belt, Big Brother houseguests tend to come back into the game with a better perception of what’s happening in the house. Typically, returning houseguests have more game sense, which allows them to improve on their strategy overall. Giving all the houseguests this kind of advantage would be an interesting twist in the game, as they’d all come in on an even playing field at the start of the season.



 Many Big Brother Veterans Deserve Another Shot At The Game 
         




With only one winner each season, there are dozens of Big Brother veterans who have played phenomenal games and never seen the final 2 chairs. With houseguests like BB 24’s Michael Bruner and BB 23’s Hannah Chaddha playing phenomenal games and falling short, it would be interesting to bring a mix of early boots and longer-term players back to try again. There are many veterans who would love another shot in the house, and viewers would be excited to see an element of the game that Big Brother has never explored before. A cast made up of second chance players who aren’t necessarily All-Stars would be fascinating.
