# Fool Me Once s Most Confusing Character Mystery Has Nothing To Do With The Murders


## SUMMARY 



  The biggest mystery in Netflix&#39;s Fool Me Once has nothing to do with the murders, but centers around a supporting character who is still alive.   Shane, Maya&#39;s best friend, starts exhibiting suspicious behavior halfway through the series, stalking her and putting a tracker on her car, but the show doesn&#39;t explain why.   Shane&#39;s character arc lacked sufficient screen time and development, leaving viewers with unanswered questions about his actions and motives.

## Literature Review
While there were numerous mysteries surrounding the murders in Netflix&#39;s Fool Me Once, the most confusing mystery surrounds a secondary character.




The most confusing character mystery in Netflix’s series Fool Me Once has nothing to do with the murders. Adapted from the eponymous Harlan Coben novel, Fool Me Once includes numerous mysteries that push the plot forward. The primary question is whether Joe is alive or dead. If he’s dead, this adds a bunch of questions, including how he showed up on the nanny cam and who killed him. On top of this, the series establishes that the same gun killed Joe and Claire, creating a mystery about who would have access to the weapon and motive to kill both of them – a mislead since they were killed by different people.




Moreover, there’s the mystery of why Tommy Dark disappeared, which eventually turns into a question about who killed him and placed him in a freezer. Fool Me Once also reveals two more murders which are being covered up by the Burkett family. With all the people getting killed in this miniseries, it would make sense that the biggest and most confusing questions would revolve around one or more deaths. Surprisingly, the most confusing mystery has nothing to do with any of the multiple murders, centering on a supporting character in Fool Me Once who’s very much alive.

                  10 Best TV Shows Like Fool Me Once   Though Fool Me Once won&#39;t get a second season on Netflix, multiple other dramas and thrillers exist that offer a similar storyline and themes.    


 What Was Up With Shane&#39;s Suspicious Behavior In Fool Me Once? 
          




In Fool Me Once, Shane is the best friend of Maya, whom she met while they were both in the Army. He supports her and her daughter, Lily, as she investigates the mysteries surrounding Claire’s and Joe’s deaths. However, halfway through the series, he starts stalking her. He shows up wherever she goes, puts a tracker on her car, and becomes controlling of her behavior. The series never bothers to explain why he’s acting so suspiciously.

The writers might’ve wanted him to be a red herring, drawing the mystery of the murders out longer. This would explain his confusing behavior that escalates throughout the ending of Fool Me Once. He could&#39;ve just been a concerned friend who was worried about her being killed after both her husband and sister were murdered. Alternatively, Shane might’ve started suspecting that Maya knew more about Claire and Joe’s murders than she was letting on since she was the person who asked him to test the bullets against each other. In this case, it makes sense that he starts spying on her and asking her harder questions.

 Shane&#39;s Confusing Character Arc Needed More Screen Time In Fool Me Once 
          



Without more context, it seems deeply concerning that he’s violating her privacy and boundaries.




Shane doesn’t get enough screen time or character development to say definitively why he was acting so strangely. It’s clear that he’s close with Maya, but Fool Me Once never explains what role he plays in her life. Without more context, it seems deeply concerning that he’s violating her privacy and boundaries. It could be normal – based on their relationship – for him to show up at her house without warning late at night or get upset when she withholds things from him. Unfortunately, Fool Me Once won’t be getting a second season, leaving audiences with more questions than answers when it comes to Shane.
