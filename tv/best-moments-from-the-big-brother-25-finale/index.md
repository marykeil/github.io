## Literature Review
The BB 25 finale was filled with excitement, including announcing the winner, America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest, and a new show from the BB universe.




Big Brother 25 came to an exciting conclusion during the finale, and there are many memorable moments that stand out. To celebrate its milestone season, Big Brother 25 was a record-breaking 100 days long. It featured many twists and turns that were accidentally unleashed by legends Danielle Reyes, Britney Haynes, and Frankie Grande through the Time Laser. Four multiverses--the BB Comic-Verse, Humili-Verse, Scary-Verse, and Scramble-Verse--took over the game. Also, Survivor legend Cirie Fields was revealed as the 17th houseguest, secretly playing alongside her son, Jared Fields.
Hosted by Julie Chen Moonves, the Big Brother 25 finale had some highly anticipated moments. The jury members--Cameron Hardin, Cory Wurtenberger, Blue Kim, America Lopez, Cirie Fields, and Felicia Cannon--had a discussion with Big Brother 2 winner and icon Dr. Will Kirby, in which they debated the merits of the Final 3--Jag Bains, Matt Klotz, and Bowie Jane. Two showmances, Matt and Reilly Smedley, and Jared and Blue Kim, had their long-awaited reunions. Here are ten more of the best moments of the Big Brother 25 finale.

 10  Matt Klotz Wins Part 1 Of The Final HOH Competition 
Matt Klotz Won 1 HOH &amp; 2 Power of Veto Competitions During Big Brother 25
        

The Big Brother 25 finale began with Bowie, Matt, and Jag competing in Part 1 of the final HOH competition, which was brought to them by all four of the multiverses. They started out swinging on a disc above a thought bubble from the BB Comic-Verse, which hit them into a wall from the Scary-Verse. They were then dipped in fake scrambled eggs from the Scramble-Verse and covered in hair from the Humili-Verse. They were also soaked in freezing cold rain.
After a while, the Final 3 had to move down to sit on the thought bubble. Bowie began to struggle and fell first. When Jag began to feel as though as he would fall, he suggested that he and Matt play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, to determine who&#39;d win. His reasoning was that it didn&#39;t matter because they had each other&#39;s backs because of their Minutemen alliance. Matt won Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Jag purposely fell after 2 hours 56 minutes of hanging on, making Matt the winner of Part 1.





 9  Jag Bains Wins Part 2 Of The Final HOH Competition 
Jag Bains Won 3 HOH &amp; 7 Power Of Veto Competitions During Big Brother 25
        

In Part 2 of the final HOH competition, Jag and Bowie faced off. The game required them to sort the names of the Big Brother 25 competitions by ziplining and retrieving them two at a time. They then had to place them in chronological order in each of the four Big Brother 25 universes. When all of their portals were correct, they had to hit their buttons.
Jag played first and was shocked by how difficult this game was for him. He said that he studied the names, dates, and winners of the competitions, but he didn&#39;t study which multiverse they originated from. Bowie had the same problem. As they awaited the announcement of the winner, Jag was convinced that he lost because he said that it was his worst performance in any competition. However, Jag won Part 2 of the final HOH competition with a time of 1 hour 2 minutes 56 seconds. Bowie&#39;s time was 1 hour 30 minutes 2 seconds.
            
 
 100 Days Is Too Long For Big Brother (That Format Needs To Change) 
Big Brother is 100 days, making it the longest season ever. Here&#39;s why the reality series should stick to a shorter timeline in the future.









 8  Jag Wins Part 3 Of The Final HOH Competition 
Jag Bains&#39; Third HOH Competition Win
        

Part 3 of the final HOH competition played out live on the Big Brother 25 finale. Matt and Jag went head-to-head. The premise of the game was that, to make up for opening the BB multiverse, Meow Meow Enterprises sent each of the jurors their own universe where it was all about them. In order to win, Matt and Jag had to prove how well they knew their former housemates by listening to three statements from them and determining which one was false.
Both Matt and Jag got all six questions right, so they had to have a tiebreaker. The question was, &#34;Rounded to the nearest minute how many minutes was the &#39;When Universes Collide&#39; HOH Part 1 competition from the official start to when Jag hit the water making Matt the winner?&#34; The answer was 176 minutes. Matt guessed 140 minutes, while Jag guessed 163, so Jag became the final HOH of the season. This was his 10th win, which meant that he broke Janelle Pierzina and Michael Bruner&#39;s record of nine single-season wins.





 7  Jag Chooses Matt To Sit Next To Him In The Final 2 
Jag Stayed True To The Minutemen Alliance With Matt


 







When it came time for Jag to choose who&#39;d sit next to him in the Final 2 chairs, Jag stayed loyal to Matt. He said that Matt answered his prayers by saving him with the Power of Invincibility in week 4, and didn&#39;t turn his back on him then. He shared that it would feel wrong if he turned his back on Matt now. Jag added that he had to do what he thought was right, and he hoped that his family, Sikh community, and Bowie would be proud. The Minutemen, Jag and Matt, then became the Final 2 houseguests of the season.





 6  Jag Says His Hands Are Covered In The Jury’s Blood 
Jag Was Responsible For The Eviction Of Every Jury Member


 







After the jury interrogated Jag and Matt, and Jag declared that he was the true leader between him and Matt, Jag made a fiery final plea to the jury. He told them, &#34;My hands are covered in your blood. I am the most dominant, masterful, and strategic player in this house. I don&#39;t only deserve to win, I have earned this victory.&#34; He then explained how he&#39;d methodically planned each of the jurors&#39; evictions. It was a shocking moment from the usually docile Jag, and demonstrated how badly he wanted to win.

Julie then welcomed back the Big Brother 25 pre-jury members--Kirsten Elwin, Reilly, Hisam Goueli, Red Utley, Izzy Gleicher, Jared, and Mecole Hayes--to reveal some secrets about the houseguests. They&#39;d been watching Big Brother 25 from the comfort of their own homes. Hisam shared that he was surprised to learn that Mecole was a political consultant because she&#39;d told everyone that she was a teacher. He said that they would&#39;ve been the Final 2 if they&#39;d worked together sooner.
Bowie also revealed her secret that she&#39;s not just a DJ, but also a criminal trial attorney, who specializes in money laundering and tax fraud. Felicia revealed that Cameron had guessed that Bowie was an attorney just a few days ago. Felicia also declared that they knew that Bowie wasn&#39;t 35, as she&#39;d told the houseguests, and asked her how old she really was. Bowie replied that she&#39;s 45years old, but lied about her age because she knew her fellow houseguests would be younger. Julie said that 45 has never looked more youthful.





 4  Cirie &amp; Jared Fields Reveal They’re Mother &amp; Son 
Only Izzy &amp; Blue Knew Cirie &amp; Jared&#39;s Secret


One of the most highly anticipated moments of the Big Brother 25 finale was the jury finally finding out that Cirie and Jared were mother and son. Julie asked Matt to guess who might be related. He guessed showmance Cory and America, which caused uproarious laughter from everyone. Matt then said that he didn’t think it through, and he didn’t know. Jared then said, &#34;I know who is related. I was playing this game with my mother.&#34; Julie asked Jared&#39;s mom to identify herself, and Cirie raised her hand. They hugged, while Blue stood up and applauded. In a hilarious segment, the pre-jurors&#39; reactions to hearing the secret were shown.
Felicia laughed as she shouted, &#34;No wonder I couldn’t break through that!&#34; Cory marveled, &#34;I voted out Jared and thought I could work with Cirie.&#34; Cirie and Jared&#39;s close ally, Izzy, admitted to everyone that she knew they were related on night one. She recognized Jared&#39;s face from social media before they even entered the house because she&#39;s a fan of Cirie. Jared confessed that the other person who knew was his showmance Blue because she was the one and only person he could trust besides Izzy. Cirie seemed annoyed by this because they had an agreement that they wouldn&#39;t tell anyone. She told Jared they&#39;d talk after the show.

 3  Jag Bains Wins Big Brother 25 
Jag Makes History As The First Sikh Winner Of Big Brother


The time finally came for the Big Brother 25 jury members to cast their votes for the winner. Julie revealed that Cirie and Felicia voted for Matt, while Cameron, Cory, America, Blue, and Bowie voted for Jag. This meant that Jag won Big Brother 25 by a vote of 5-2, and became the first Sikh winner of the show. He&#39;s also the first winner to previously have been unanimously evicted during the game. Jag gushed that he felt on top of the world, saying that it was the greatest experience of his life. He took home the $750,000 grand prize, while Matt won $75,000 as the runner-up. Matt was the first deaf person ever to play Big Brother.

Julie also announced that Cameron won America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest, which was chosen by Big Brother fans. The Top 3 fan vote-getters, in no particular order, were Cirie, Matt, and Cameron. Cameron teared up when his name was announced. He said, &#34;Thank you so, so much. I am speechless. Thank you so much.&#34; As America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest, Cameron is the recipient of $50,000.





 1  Julie Chen Moonves Announces Big Brother Reindeer Games 
Big Brother Reindeer Games Premieres December 11


What could be better than an exciting Big Brother finale? An announcement that more Big Brother is just around the corner! At the very end of the show, Julie announced that she was receiving another transmission. Danielle, Britney, and Frankie returned to the Big Brother house to fix it with the Time Laser by closing the multiverse. However, they suddenly changed into Christmas outfits, while an Advent calendar with 9 boxes appeared on the Memory Wall.
Julie then announced Big Brother Reindeer Games, a new game with a new set of rules from the BB universe. In the game, legendary Big Brother players will return to compete to be the last one standing in six action-packed holiday-themed episodes. Big Brother favorites Jordan Lloyd, Derek Xiao, and Tiffany Mitchell will make special appearances as Santa&#39;s elves. Julie also revealed that one of the Big Brother 25 houseguests would be invited to compete. Big Brother Reindeer Games premieres on December 11 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.
The Big Brother 25 finale was exciting to watch, and was a true reflection of the season as a whole. No one would have expected that Jag would win the whole show when he was unanimously evicted in week 4. However, Matt&#39;s use of the Power of Invincibility kept him in the game, and they then shared a bond that couldn&#39;t be broken. Cameron&#39;s win for America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest was well-deserved, and he&#39;s certain to compete in a future season of the show, perhaps Reindeer Games. Big Brother 25 was the perfect way to celebrate the beloved reality competition show&#39;s milestone season.
