## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Liz Woods has been boldly showing off her alleged new boyfriend on social media while Big Ed Brown insists they are still together.




Liz Woods could be on 90 Day: The Single Life again, considering she&#39;s been showing off a possible romance with a new man on her social media as rumors of her split with Big Ed Brown persist. Liz is a 30-year-old woman from San Diego where she worked as a waitress manager at a restaurant. Big Ed was one of Liz&#39;s frequent customers who asked her out after his breakup with Filipina woman Rose Vega. Big Ed and Liz went through ups and downs over the years while fighting about issues stemming from insecurity and trust. They broke up 13 times, sometimes even on camera, but the latest breakup rumors have been cause for celebration online.




The speculations started after Liz and Big Ed reportedly got married in August 2023 in Arkansas. What makes matters complicated is that Liz is now hanging out with someone entirely new.

          

Liz was never seen with a wedding ring and there were no documents to prove that the couple had married. Meanwhile, they had bought a house together in Arkansas and Liz has been spending all her time in San Diego. She celebrated New Year&#39;s Day with a mystery man. Liz posted an Instagram Story showing her sitting in the passenger seat of a car holding hands with someone. Liz captioned her photo, &#34;Ringing in the new year.&#34;

 How Has Liz Woods Changed Since Allegedly Leaving Big Ed? 
          

Liz, as usual, did not tag any profile to reveal the person&#39;s identity. She&#39;s possibly choosing to keep things private because of contractual obligations. Liz is all set to star in 90 Day Diaries season 5, which will reveal what happened between her and Big Ed after they left the Florida Keys resort on 90 Day: The Last Resort. Meanwhile, Big Ed has suggested that they also appear in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 8. Regardless, Big Ed has been insisting that he and Liz are still together. However, he does mention that Liz has been away from home most of the time.


 




Liz has been posting about her dates with an unknown man since the last few months. Soft-launching her possible new boyfriend came as a surprise to those who had read about her wedding ceremony with Big Ed in August. There have been a lot of discussions online about how tired and empty Liz looked when she was with Big Ed. Big Ed seemed to suck the life out of the younger woman. Interestingly, Liz has been all smiles in her latest photos. It also looks like she&#39;s lost a considerable amount of weight since fans last saw her on 90 Day: The Last Resort.

It has also been a year since the show was filmed. A lot can happen in a year and it does suggest that Liz and Big Ed broke up for the 14th time, which might be the last time. If Liz is truly happy with her new boyfriend, it could mean that she never goes back to Big Ed like she used to on 90 Day: The Single Life. She&#39;s certainly thriving in her life, and it&#39;ll be interesting to find out what happens next to her now that she&#39;s supposedly not with Big Ed.






90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
