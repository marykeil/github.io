  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Many divorces have rocked the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. However, there are still several marriages that are going strong.</p>
<p>As one of the best reality TV shows, 90 Day Fiancé has introduced dozens of couples since it first premiered in 2014, but not all duos have stuck together. Many 90 Day Fiancé franchise couples have split up, especially in the past few years, as the COVID-19 pandemic strains many relationships. At the same time, viewers saw some of these breakups coming, and some shocked fans. However, there is a surprising number of couples who worked things out. As 90 Day Fiancé season 10 unfolds, it&rsquo;s time to revisit those still married in 2024.</p>
<p>The 90 Day Fiancé franchise has featured many couples in different stages of relationships. The popular spin-off show 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days depicts international couples before they become engaged and often meet for the first time. Meanwhile, 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way shows American couples who travel abroad to explore their international romances in a reversal of the franchise&rsquo;s original premise. While several famous couples continued airing their relationships on 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? other cast members have disappeared from the public eye, leaving viewers wondering if they worked things out. Many of the 90 Day Fiancé couples from earlier seasons are still together, even though many thought they would divorce.</p>
