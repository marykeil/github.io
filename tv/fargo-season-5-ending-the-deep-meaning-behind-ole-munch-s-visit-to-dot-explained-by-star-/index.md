## Literature Review

Sam Spruell, who played Ole Munch in Fargo Season 5, explains the deep meaning behind his character&#39;s visit to Dot in the final episode.




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for Fargo season 5 finale!Fargo has always had some strange elements, but Ole Munch (Sam Spruell) is one of the most bizarre. The show is based on the 1996 movie and follows various mysteries in the Midwest. Each season exhibits a different focus. Taking place in 2019, season 5 tells the story of Dot Lyon&#39;s conflict with Roy Tillman. Along the way, the situation spirals as the sin-eater Ole Munch gets involved.




Fargo season 5 ends with Ole Munch meeting with Dot and sharing a meal with her. They share a long talk about forgiveness and debts, and then the season ends, as the show prepares to move to another setting for a prospective season 6. In an interview with TV Insider, Spruell went into depth about why his character met with Dot and the real meaning behind the sin-eater&#39;s role.


“I think he probably did what he does. He sets her free, then just leaves, and he doesn’t think about it. And then suddenly there is a kind of itch on the inside of his skull — that is a direct quote from Noah Hawley — where something is [bothering] him. It’s a debt unpaid and the issue of whether debts always need to be paid is something that is a quandary that he must wrestle with... It’s also asking us maybe to think about what debts we do let go [of]. Without being too pretentious or political, if a private company takes your money, but fails, quite often we will give more public money to keep that company going. When it comes to a smaller individual who’s destitute through debt, we seem to arrive at quite a hard attitude and view of that person’s demise at their own hands. I think it’s just asking you to think about that state of affairs. I really began to understand the character with the sin-eating scene. Once I understood the repercussions of that, I really started to get who he was. And then these themes Fargo is very good at of emancipation versus entrapment that are [timeless]. If your creator says he’s lived for 500 years, well then you just go with it and you try and think about what 500 years of living in sin means for you as a person. I’ve found it’s quite a heavy role in which you are also asked to try and find a bit of humor as well. So I felt like it was a privilege to play this guy. And there was one point where we were worried that we might not have time to film this speech. It’s very important. And I remember I said, ‘I have to say these lines,’ [they] feel so important to the show and this part, and to everything we are trying to say, because of deep understanding of humanity and how cruel it can be and how entitled it can be and how tough it can be. I think it’s funny. It is nice when things end with an act of hope. And so I would like to think that just that gesture, just her offer, and his acceptance of her offer breaks the cycle, and he’s set free to live a life that can accept love.”






 The Purpose Of Ole Munch 
          

Debt is a running theme in Fargo. Witt gave his life to repay his debt to Dot, because she had previously saved him from an early death. Lorraine uses debt to convince prisoners to torment Roy to force Roy to repay his debt to society after he tormented Dot and killed Witt and his father-in-law. The presence of a sin-eater, however, only complicates that theme. Because sin-eaters are mythological creatures who absorb sin by ritualistically consuming food, Ole Munch is embroiled in themes of debt.



Ole Munch was once a regular human being before being cursed with immortality as a sin-eater.




After all, a sin-eater frees a soul of their Earthly burdens. By taking on their flaws, Ole Munch is also owed a debt, considering the horror that he experiences. By haunting Dot, Ole Munch is attempting to settle those debts and that of his lost partner by taking revenge on Dot. It&#39;s a strange and fantastical element to include in a fairly realistic show, but it settles both Dot&#39;s debts and the themes of the show. By appearing, Ole Munch can close all remaining plot threads and explain the purpose behind the themes.




                  All 5 Fargo Seasons &amp; Movie, Ranked Worst To Best   Fargo is synonymous with quality, with all five seasons and the movie being beloved, so here is every Fargo story ranked from worst to best.   

Forgiveness is also a theme that Ole Munch exemplifies. His appearance in the final scene allows Dot to teach him the meaning behind forgiveness. Many forms of debt can be forgiven, and so it is a natural fit for that theme. Ole Munch&#39;s appearance at Dot&#39;s house allows him to learn about the concept of forgiveness, which allows the sin-eater to realize that his long future can be a much more peaceful one. If Ole Munch appears in Fargo&#39;s future, it will be interesting to the long-term implications.
