 Violett Beane &amp; Lauren Patten Talk Death And Other Details 
         




Screen Rant: When you first got the script for Death and Other Details, what stood out to you?


Violett Beane: I actually just saw an email that I sent shortly after getting the job to Mike and Heidi, the show creators. I had written, &#34;I&#39;m so excited to play Imogene. She&#39;s the most messy and relatable character I&#39;ve read in years,&#34; and I stand by that. Still, to this day, I feel like she doesn&#39;t know what is going on, but that&#39;s how we all are, especially in our mid to late 20s. We have no idea what we&#39;re doing. That, for me, stood out. I was just like, &#34;This is somebody that I want to bring to life.&#34;
Lauren Patten: Mike and Heidi created such a lavish, beautiful world. Visually, the show is really pristine and gorgeous, but all of the characters are very messy and going through it and have secrets. I think that&#39;s a nice contrast and very cool in the writing. It&#39;s not like the characters are perfect and pristine and unrelatable. You&#39;re just watching something very beautiful with all of these people just struggling through.





Right from the get-go, we learn that Imogene experienced very intense trauma in her childhood. Can you talk a bit about how that has shaped her into the woman she is when we see her in the present day?


Violett Beane: When we meet Imogene, she&#39;s definitely lost. She&#39;s somebody who needs to see something to believe it. Her mom&#39;s murder is something that has never been solved and that&#39;s just going to weigh on her. The way that you see it develop over the season is that any person that goes through any sort of childhood trauma sort of builds up these walls that are very easy to access and very difficult to break down.
There are a handful of of relationships with lovers or people that come back into her life, such as Rufus, and friendships where you see these walls constantly going up and coming down. I think that that&#39;s another level of relatability. Even if a parent didn&#39;t die when you were a child, everybody went through something and I think you see that throughout all of these characters, but that&#39;s definitely sort of her driving force.





This is a murder mystery, it’s all about looking for clues. Without spoiling, did you have any predictions when you were first reading the scripts, and how close were you to guessing the ending correctly?


Lauren Patten: I feel like the script goes through so many twists and turns, so before I found out, I had truly no idea. [Laughs] I don&#39;t even know how to really guess because it just winds its way, and at some point, you think it&#39;s everybody. I feel like I was not the most skilled detective with it because I was definitely pretty blown away by it.
Violett Beane: I remember you coming in every week with a new theory though. I do remember this. They weren&#39;t full-fledged by any means. You had no evidence to back it up. But I remember you being like, &#34;Oh, it was this person. Oh, it was this person,&#34; and I was like, &#34;What? Where did you come up with this?&#34;
Lauren Patten: But not accurate.
Violett Beane: No, never accurate.





Did you get a chance to talk with the actors who played the younger version of your characters and discuss what similarities and differences they would have during these life stages?


Violett Beane: Yeah, really sweet. You&#39;re blown away every time you work with a child actor because you&#39;re just like, &#34;You seem more mature than me. You seem like you&#39;ve lived longer, you&#39;ve worked more, you know the ins and outs of this, and so it was really fun. Towards the end of the season, I have so many scenes with younger me, and it was really special to be able to do that.
