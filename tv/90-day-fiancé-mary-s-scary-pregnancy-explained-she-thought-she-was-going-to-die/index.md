## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Mary Demasu-ay and Brandan DeNuccio welcomed baby Midnight in August 2023. Mary didn&#39;t have an easy delivery.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Mary Demasu-ay experienced a scary delivery and was certain that she was going to pass away, leaving their baby behind with Brandan DeNuccio. Mary is a 23-year-old from the Philippines who started dating Brandan from Oregon after meeting him on a dating app. Brandan and Mary were together for two years before he moved to her country in season 5. The jealous and insecure Mary became a franchise villain because she wanted to be on a 24/7 video call with Brandan. However, Mary got her share of sympathy after she became pregnant, and Brandan, 23, got cold feet.




Mary and Brandan had welcomed their baby daughter Midnight barely a month before they filmed the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell All. Midnight was born in August 2023, which confirmed that the reunion was filmed sometime in September 2023. Brandan did not join the rest of the American cast members in New York because he had just had a baby with Mary and had to help her take care of the newborn. Brandan and Mary used the platform to reveal several photos of their little angel who looks exactly like Brandan’s mini-me. However, the pregnancy wasn’t a smooth sailing affair for Mary.

 Mary Recalls Nuchal Cord Experience 
          

90 Day Fiancé host Shaun Robinson was told that there were some “tense” moments during Mary’s delivery. She asked the couple to tell them more about what happened. Mary said that the umbilical cord was around the baby’s neck. Brandan explained that the cord was wrapped around Midnight’s neck three times. According to the National Institutes of Health, the Nuchal cord occurs when the umbilical cord becomes wrapped around the fetal neck 360 degrees. Nuchal cords occur in about 10–29% of fetuses and the incidence increases with advancing gestation age. Brandan further added that Mary had a low-lying placenta, which further complicated matters.




Mary said the condition known as placenta previa, which according to Cleveland Clinic, happens when a placenta blocks all or part of a baby’s exit from the vagina while also causing vaginal bleeding during the second half of pregnancy. People with placenta previa typically need a C-section delivery.



 Mary Left A Note For Brandan In Case She Died 
          

Mary had to undergo a C-section during which she stayed awake. Mary said her “oxygen was lost” and she had to be routinely administered oxygen. When asked what Brandan was doing to support Mary during the situation, he revealed that Mary had left a note for him on the phone to tell him to take care of Midnight in case anything happened to her. The note said, “I’m so scared to do this c section tomorrow. If I die please take good care of midnightt love her as much or more than you love me.” Mary also asked Brandan to take good care of her grandmother Lola.




Mary asked Brandan to look after him. She wrote, “If ever I die just find love you deserve and be happy always.” Mary called Brandan her perfect husband. She referred to herself as Brandan’s “CLINGY OVERTHINKER” wife while signing off from the note. Brandan assured Mary that she had nothing to worry about because she was going to be treated by trained professionals.



 Mary Says She&#39;s &#39;Still Recovering&#39; 

 

Brandan told Mary that there was light at the end of the tunnel while instilling some hope in her. Mary revealed that she was feeling “good” now but hadn’t fully healed yet. She said she was feeling better but was still “recovering.” She said, “It still hurt but feel better.” The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple revealed that Midnight’s personality is just like Brandan’s. However, Mary did have complaints about Brandan not helping her out with the baby. Even though Mary was still not a 100 percent fit, Brandan was lashing out at Mary if she disturbed him while playing his video game, so he could take care of the baby.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
