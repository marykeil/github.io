## Literature Review
Kyle Viljoen puts the spotlight on a Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 viewer for sending him death threats and calling him a derogatory word.




Kyle Viljoen from Below Deck Mediterranean slammed a problematic viewer after receiving homophobic comments on social media. Thirty-one-year-old South African stew Kyle has made back-to-back appearances on the Bravo show. He fell and injured his ankle during Below Deck Med season 7 and became the first yachtie to leave the series within three episodes as it was affecting his performance. Kyle&#39;s return during Below Deck Med season 8 caused a lot of drama after he was accused of being a bully and a troublemaker. He proved them right as he became one of the most notorious workers of Captain Sandy Yawn’s crew. Kyle came close to being fired.




Captain Sandy warned Kyle about his bullying, screaming, and lack of respect in the workplace, and he has now learned how to tackle the bullies who send him horrible messages on Instagram. A person named Jason wrote to Kyle saying, &#34;You are so f****** disgusting, I literally can&#39;t wait for something bad to happen to you or you drop f****** dead! It will be the most gratifying day to everybody&#39;s life! Karma f** f****** fa****.&#34; Kyle exposed the person by sharing a screenshot of their DM on his Instagram Stories and tagging them. He then wrote, &#34;You are a diplorable [sic] human being, my days of wishing such repulsive behavior well, are far gone.&#34;

Kyle told his followers that such messages are sent to people across the world all the time and that many children and teens have to deal with them on social media. &#34;Protect your loved ones and check in on your community!&#34; he added. As a side note, he also told the person that the hateful slur they used didn&#39;t hurt him anymore. &#34;I claimed the words that once was used against me to make me feel less than!&#34; Kyle continued in his message to his bully. It appears the person has deleted their Instagram account after being called out by the reality star.





 

Kyle and Natalya Scudder had a great professional relationship in Below Deck Med season 7, but their friendship went up in flames in the current season. Natalya chose to leave the boat after a nasty fight with Kyle that was caught on camera following a drunken crew night out. Captain Sandy warned Kyle that she would never bring him back as a chief stew because of what happened. Kyle later took to his Instagram Stories to confess that he wished he had quit back then. He said he was not in the right head space and was financially broke, so he chose money over his mental health.

Kyle has mentioned that what happened has given him yachting PTSD to this day. It’s been a year since Kyle filmed Below Deck Mediterranean and a lot of things have changed in real time since then. Kyle and Natalya ended their conflict and made amends in their friendship. The newer episodes are now showing the aftermath of Natalya’s mid-season exit and, as expected, there’s more drama in store on the Mustique thanks to Kyle.
