# The Doctor Who Christmas Special Was Secretly A Soft Reboot For The Show Ahead Of Season 14


## SUMMARY 



  The Doctor Who Christmas special marks a reboot of the show, just like its 2005 revival, providing a jumping-on point for new or returning fans.   The similarities between Rose and Ruby, the companions of the Ninth and Fifteenth Doctors, include their age, hair color, names starting with the same letter, and both characters lacking a father figure.   Both the Ninth and Fifteenth Doctors have experienced unique forms of regeneration, deviating from the norm in Doctor Who, which adds to their individuality and the overall lore of the show.

## Literature Review
&#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; is a good point for new Doctor Who fans to join the show, and there are parallels to the first revival episode.




The Doctor Who Christmas special, &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; wasn&#39;t just Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s full debut as the Fifteenth Doctor, but it also quietly rebooted the show. Doctor Who&#39;s longevity means it has been through several eras, with breaks varying in length. When it returned in 2005 with &#34;Rose,&#34; the show had been off the air for 16 years, with only Paul McGann&#39;s 1996 Doctor Who TV movie to break up the franchise&#39;s dry spell. When the BBC resurrected Doctor Who with Christopher Eccleston, several key hallmarks separated the show from its classic era. Gatwa&#39;s first Doctor Who episode shared a number of signifiers that also marked Eccleston&#39;s debut.




Russell T. Davies was the man responsible for bringing back Doctor Who in 2005. Although the show had a new feel when it returned, the canon of the original run remained relevant. Now that Davies has returned as the showrunner for Doctor Who season 14, he seems to be applying the same techniques he used the first time around. As with the 2005 revival, the 2023 Christmas special isn&#39;t a hard reset of the Doctor Who universe but marks the presence of a jumping-on point for new or returning fans. As a result, the Ninth and Fifteenth Doctors have very similar starting points.

                  Doctor Who: Every Doctor &amp; Who Played Them (In Chronological Order)   Doctor Who has been played by a crop of fantastic actors going back several decades, and each version has been both unique and memorable.    


 Both Rose Tyler And Ruby Sunday Are 19 Years Old During Their Doctor Who Debuts 
The companions of the Ninth and Fifteenth Doctors are also similar in other ways
         




The parallels between &#34;Rose&#34; and &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; begin with each Doctor&#39;s respective companion. Both characters are 19 years old during their debut appearances, giving them a similar level of life experience and view of the world. The age of Billie Piper&#39;s Rose Tyler and Millie Gibson&#39;s Ruby Sunday isn&#39;t the only thing the two women share. Aside from both having blonde hair, each companion has a first name that begins with the same letter, and both names refer to colors. Not only that, but the color that&#39;s implied by the name of both Rose and Ruby is red.

If their names, ages, and hair colors aren&#39;t enough to make it seem like Rose and Ruby are cut from the same cloth, neither character has a father figure in their lives. However, their reasons for this do differ. Rose&#39;s father in the main Doctor Who universe died when she was young, only being shown in the past and in a parallel world. Ruby has been raised by her adoptive mother, unaware of the identity of her biological parents - a facet of Ruby&#39;s backstory that may be explored further during her time on the show.




                  10 Modern Doctor Who Episodes Everyone Has Already Forgotten About   While there have been plenty of brilliant Doctor Who adventures since the show&#39;s 2005 reboot, there are some episodes that have been lost to time.    

Although certain Doctor Who companions, such as Martha Jones, do leave their families behind, many of them travel guilt-free with the Doctor. Ruby and Rose both fall into the category of choosing to go with the Time Lord rather than stay with their loved ones. In Rose&#39;s case, she leaves her mother and boyfriend in London to travel through time with the Ninth Doctor. Ruby does something very similar, with the difference being that it&#39;s her adoptive mother and grandmother to whom she bids farewell.



 The Doctor Has Just Departed From An Unusual Form Of Regeneration 
It&#39;s not often that regeneration deviates from the norm in Doctor Who
          

The concept of regeneration is a huge part of Doctor Who lore, and new information about the process keeps being added to the canon. While most Doctors will regenerate in the traditional way, some experience a unique form of transformation. Nine and Fifteen are among the group who are born from a more unconventional form of regeneration. For Nine, his previous form was the War Doctor, a version of the Time Lord responsible for ending the conflict between his people and the Daleks.




In a short released by the BBC prior to the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who, Paul McGann&#39;s Eighth Doctor is shown to have chosen the attributes of his next form as he became John Hurt&#39;s War Doctor. Regeneration is supposed to be a random process, with the Doctor not having any control over what their next body will look like or how their personality will change. So, although the Ninth Doctor himself may be the result of regeneration as it&#39;s commonly understood, in &#34;Rose,&#34; he has only recently changed from his custom form.



Both versions of the Time Lord continued to exist as autonomous entities.




In &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor has also only just experienced a new form of regeneration. Doctor Who&#39;s shocking bi-generation twist meant that the introduction of the Fifteenth Doctor did not mean the end of David Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor. Instead, both versions of the Time Lord continued to exist as autonomous entities. As a result, Fifteen&#39;s origin is just as unusual as Nine&#39;s.




One of the main differences between the beginnings of Eccleston&#39;s and Gatwa&#39;s respective reins as the Doctor is that the War Doctor&#39;s regeneration into Nine is never completely shown. The start of the process is implied during &#34;The Day of the Doctor,&#34; but Eccleston&#39;s lack of involvement in the Doctor Who 50th-anniversary celebrations meant that he wasn&#39;t available to document the on-screen transition between John Hurt and himself. Gatwa&#39;s emergence during his bi-generation scene with David Tennant is available for all to see.



The introduction of the War Doctor in 2013 disrupted the numbering convention of the various iterations of the Doctor. So, although the War Doctor is technically the ninth version of the Time Lord, Christopher Eccleston retained the title of the Ninth Doctor.






 Nine And Fifteen Are Alone In The Universe In Their First Episodes Of Doctor Who 
Both Doctors are processing big events
          




It&#39;s not uncommon for a Doctor to start in their new body without a companion, but it&#39;s not often that they also have to adapt so soon after such life-changing events. Both &#34;Rose&#34; and &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; feature a version of the Doctor who is quietly processing recent trauma. For the Ninth Doctor, he believes he&#39;s just been responsible for the slaughter of not only the Daleks but also the rest of the Time Lords. Despite being in the form of the War Doctor during the horrific act, the mental wound is likely still fresh during the early episodes of the 2005 Doctor Who revival.

                  Doctor Who: Why Every Companion Actor Left The Show   Since its premiere in 1963, many actors have starred in Doctor Who as the Time Lord&#39;s traveling companion, but not many lasted too long on the show.    

Similarly, Fifteen is still processing the events of what happened during his recent regenerations. Before his brief stint as the Fourteenth Doctor, the Thirteenth version saw half of the universe being destroyed due to the Flux. In addition, the Doctor&#39;s entire identity and backstory were revealed to have been altered in season 12, episode 10, &#34;The Timeless Children.&#34; Although the Doctor&#39;s conversation with the Toymaker in the Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials revealed the villain was responsible for changing the Time Lord&#39;s past, those events have only just happened from Fifteen&#39;s perspective. As a result, he&#39;s likely in a similar psychological state as Nine was during his first Doctor Who appearance.






The classic run of Doctor Who can be streamed on Tubi, and the 2005 revival era is on Max. The 50th-anniversary specials and all subsequent episodes of Doctor Who will be available on Disney&#43;.
