## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge may have been a smash success, but the series was plagued with issues due to the show&#39;s editing style, which ruined it.




Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 may have been an overnight success for Netflix, but the show’s editing has ruined many organic moments on the series, favoring fabricated moments over genuine ones. While the competitors on Squid Game: The Challenge all had to work through the competition in order to even appear on the series, the show limited their stories in a way that showed they cared less about the players than the game overall. With challenges that tested the players mentally and physically, Squid Game: The Challenge was a difficult feat for finalists who came into the competition to win the largest prize in Netflix history, $4.56 million.
Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 is based off the South Korean sensation, Squid Game. The series aired in 2021 to critical acclaim, raking in Netflix subscriptions and winning awards in the subsequent year. As the production team behind the reality TV competition version of the series developed their own Squid Game style show, many elements had to be changed for the betterment of the game. Still, competitors flocked to the reality TV series to try their hand at the difficult game, hopeful they would be able to beat the other 455 competitors in order to be the one left standing.

 8  Players Were Difficult To Invest In Due To Their Minor Appearances 
Finalists Like Mai, Player 287, Weren&#39;t Featured Until The End Of The Season
        

Although many of the players had moments where they were featured throughout the season, the majority of key players weren’t actually shown as individuals until the very end of the show. Players who were focused on in the moment on Squid Game: The Challenge either had pivotal roles in helping to win or lose a challenge or were likely to be eliminated soon after they were shown and explored. This made it difficult to connect to the stories of the players who actually made it in the competition. Of the three players who made the finals, only Mai, player 287, was featured in earlier episodes.





 7  Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s First Competition Was Edited To Ignore Issues 
Players Complained Of Freezing Temperatures &amp; Injuries
        

The players first competed in Squid Game: The Challenge’s version of Red Light, Green Light when they got into the competition. Those who had watched Squid Game were familiar with the challenge, as were those who knew of the schoolyard game. Still, the players weren’t ready for Squid Game: The Challenge’s version of the game, which included a 7-hour waiting period in a freezing cold studio prior to the competition filming. The game, which reportedly took roughly 8 hours to film, left some players injured. Despite the compelling stories that seemed to come from the challenge, the series decided to focus on the relationships between competitors rather than the challenge.





 6  Players Say Only Parts Of The Games &amp; Tests Were Shown 
The Edit Left Out Key Moments Of The Competition


 







While editing is a key part of any good reality TV show, the editing on Squid Game: The Challenge seemed to leave out incredibly critical moments of the series, sometimes making things harder to follow. Many of the players involved in later competitions, like Glass Bridge, were upset by the way the series edited the competition as they claim Squid Game: The Challenge left out some key moments of the decision-making process. Series villain Ashley Tolbert spoke out against Squid Game: The Challenge’s edit, explaining that her reputation was tarnished after Glass Bridge, which made viewers turn on her when they didn’t have all the information.





 5  Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Editing Style Left Viewers Confused 
The Show Was Made To Seem More Fantastical Than Real
        

Although the editing on Squid Game: The Challenge sometimes leaned into the more cinematic space, it left some viewers confused about the style of series they were watching. The reality TV competition aspects of the show, including the games themselves and confessional interviews, were clear. The edit, however, took some liberties surrounding the transitional effects and choices in music used to make the show seem more like it’s source material. Squid Game: The Challenge is much different than the original Squid Game, and making it function like its predecessor was confusing for some viewers, making it more difficult to follow.





 4  Players True Motivations &amp; Thoughts Weren&#39;t Shown 
Some Squid Game: The Challenge Contestants Were Portrayed Unfairly


While there were interview segments filmed, potentially frequently throughout the two-week filming period for Squid Game: The Challenge, the interviews were used more sporadically than they should’ve been. Getting into the headspace of the competitors was an important aspect of the game, and while some player interviews were shown leading up to their eliminations, most weren’t. Losing out on the interviews that could’ve helped viewers to understand the motivations behind decisions made it difficult to root for Squid Game: The Challenge players who may have been making bold moves.





 3  Squid Game: The Challenge Chose Their Narrative 
They Focused On The Story They Wanted To, Rather Than The Real One
        

Rather than paying attention to the story that was unfolding on Squid Game: The Challenge, the editors and production team behind the series chose a narrative and decided to stick to it. Despite the fact that there were stories happening before their eyes, the production team followed narratives that they’d likely built prior to the series, like the bond between mother and son with LeAnn Wilcox Plutnicki and Trey Plutnicki. Focusing on stories that led to dead ends rather than paying attention to the dynamics forming in the game was a mistake for Squid Game: The Challenge, which could’ve portrayed a nuanced, layered story.





 2  Players Injuries Were Left Unexplored On The Series 
Squid Game: The Challenge Didn&#39;t Focus On Player&#39;s Hardships


 







While it wasn’t always clear that players were injured because they’d sometimes be eliminated, the fact that injuries weren’t a focal point on Squid Game: The Challenge was a detriment to the series as a whole. The players who were injured during Red Light, Green Light were pushed to the wayside in favor of other stories, and their issues only came up when discussing the show after the fact. Rather than leaning into the element of underdogs in the game, Squid Game: The Challenge decided to ignore the fact that there was an underlying plot on the series that wasn’t of their making.





 1  Squid Game: The Challenge Was Looking For Success Rather Than Quality 
The Edit Proves The Show Was Hoping To Go Viral
        

Despite the fact that Squid Game: The Challenge was always going to be successful for Netflix, the series tried to push the envelope in order to develop its own level of success rather than riding the wave. With Squid Game as popular as it was, the reality TV version was always going to be a hit even if the show didn’t follow a narrative or wasn’t fully satisfying to viewers. The production team knew they, more than likely, had a hit on their hands, but instead of letting the stories on Squid Game: The Challenge unfold naturally, they attempted to build a formulaic successful series instead of an innovative one.
