## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Kimberly Rochelle shocks fans with an update about TJ Goswami after hinting at a divorce during the Tell-All.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Tejaswi Goswami, aka TJ, is currently in the U.S. with his American wife Kimberly Rochelle. Kimberly, 30, from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, was inclined towards spirituality just like TJ, which helped them connect on a spiritual social media group. Kimberly claimed she was a clairvoyant and her spirit guides had already revealed her soulmate in her dreams without showing his face. Kimberly realized it was TJ when he messaged her online. Kimberly stayed in India for a year when she got engaged to TJ. She later moved to Jaipur for good on The Other Way but clashed with TJ and his family before and after their marriage.




Kimberly was back in America for the Tell-All and made it clear she had no intention of going back, which could be the reason why TJ joined Kimberly in her country.


 

TJ and Kimberly announced the news to their Instagram followers with a collaborative post and an Instagram Live they did from an airport. “You think you know a person until they leave you on the dust on an airplane but he sure is cute though,” Kimberly wrote in her caption. She shared several photos and videos of them taking a flight after TJ landed in the U.S.

In one clip, Kimberly explained that “touristy” TJ took her bag, stepped over it, and dodged through the crowd to leave her behind. Meanwhile, Kimberly also recorded TJ saying that his card was declined at Starbucks, where he was waiting in line for a cappuccino, and a lady standing behind him paid for his drink. “That’s a real Santa,” said TJ. “Welcome to the US, TJ! Good luck, guys, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be easier here,” a fan told Kimberly in the comments section. “U both are my favorite couple. Love from india,” wrote an Indian 90 Day Fiancé viewer.

    

Kimberly and TJ confirmed they were still together during the Tell-All. Kimberly said she was still living in the apartment above TJ’s house during Part 1 of the reunion. However, she changed her decision once she finished filming. Kimberly confessed, “At this point I don’t know if I can count on TJ in my plans for the future.” She revealed that she was not going to go back to India. Kimberly added that she planned on staying in America for at least four months. She said she still loved TJ but wanted to make a decision that would benefit herself.




Kimberly made it look like she had bought a one-way ticket to America and had said goodbye to TJ forever. Kimberly has been in America since September 2023 when the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell-All was filmed. In November 2023, she claimed she wasn’t happy in India and complained about Indian people having body odor. It seems TJ tried to save his marriage by deciding to move to the U.S. instead of getting Kimberly back to live with his family. However, it’s also likely that TJ is just visiting the U.S. for the holidays and Kimberly might accompany him when he comes back to India again.
