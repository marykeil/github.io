## Literature Review
Since his departure from The Walking Dead, Andrew Lincoln has confirmed he will star in a Rick Grimes TV show. Here&#39;s all we know about the series.




The Rick Grimes The Walking Dead spinoff, titled The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, is on the way from AMC â€” and the third character-focused series after Daryl Dixon and Dead City, and is easily the most long-awaited. After Andrew Lincoln&#39;s Walking Dead exit in season 9, it was announced he would return for a Rick Grimes movie, possibly several. However, The Walking Dead movie was scrapped in favor of a spinoff miniseries. The show that would eventually become The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Lived would focus on Rick and Michonne after the events of The Walking Dead season 11, finally explaining the mysteries of the CRM once and for all.




Of all the TWD spinoffs it&#39;s The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live that appears most connected to the overarching narratives of the main show. While Michonne and the other residents of Alexandria always hoped that Rick Grimes survived the bridge explosion in The Walking Dead season 9, Andrew Lincoln didn&#39;t return until The Walking Dead series finale. Michonne is seen out on her own still in search of Rick, who is also seen being prompted to surrender by a CRM helicopter over a loudspeaker. This set up The Walking Dead movie-turned-series, which will see Rick and Michonne reunite, likely in a battle with the CRM.

 The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live Story - What Is The Rick And Michonne Spinoff About? 
          

The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live has been described as an epic love story between Rick and Michonne. The synopsis promises a major reunion between the two while they once again find themselves surrounded by danger and enemies beyond the ever-present walkers. Teases of the CRM fighting a war against the dead which drags Rick and Michonne into it make it clear who the villains of the story will be.





 

The Walking Dead finale also seems to reveal that he has already escaped CRM only to be recaptured. This confirms that whatever new life he was brought to when he was flown away has not been to his liking. The helicopter pilot who speaks to Rick over the loudspeaker in Rick&#39;s final scene of The Walking Dead finale also hints at another human villain on the horizon as the pilot reminds Rick, &#34;It&#39;s like he told you, there&#39;s no escape for the living.&#34; Who &#34;he&#34; is remains to be seen.



 The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live Trailer 
          

After several interesting teasers, the first full trailer for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live was released in January 2024, and it certainly adds more hype to the anticipated spinoff. Rich and Michonne are both shown on their parallel journeys as Rick is engaged with the CRM while Michonne heads north to find him. The military might of the CRM is on full display as it becomes clear that the series is about so much more than Rick and Michonne&#39;s love. It is also about the future of the zombie-infested world, and the power vacuum caused by the collapse of society.

 Why The Rick Grimes Movies Are Now A Show 


 
In 2018, after Andrew Lincoln&#39;s exit from the show, AMC announced that there were plans to make The Walking Dead movie trilogy centered on Rick Grimes. After little to no news surrounding the Rick Grimes movie release, it was revealed at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con that the movie trilogy would now be a six-part miniseries focusing on Rick and Michonne. The Walking Dead series finale set up the Rick Grimes show by revealing that Michonne is on the hunt for her lost love, though it&#39;s yet unclear how the two will be reunited.




Changing the Walking Dead movie into a show was the right call by AMC, as the landscape of the entertainment industry has changed drastically. Between streaming services reaching the height of their popularity and the COVID-19 pandemic wiping out theatrical releases, the way people consume media has shifted immensely over the last few years. In addition, a miniseries format allows The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live to properly explore Rick&#39;s journey after season 9 without the time constraints given by feature films. Though many fans were expecting a Rick Grimes movie, a show is the better choice.
