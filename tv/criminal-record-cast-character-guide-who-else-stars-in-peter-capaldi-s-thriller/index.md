## Literature Review
Peter Capaldi is the face of the Apple TV&#43; crime thriller series Criminal Record – who else is in the cast aside from Capaldi as Daniel Hegarty?




Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Criminal Record features a talented cast that includes a handful of familiar faces due to their previous notable roles in other television shows and movies. The British crime thriller series was created by Paul Rutman, and its first season contains eight episodes, with the first two episodes released on January 10, 2024. The show will then move to weekly drops until the finale, which is scheduled to premiere on February 21. Criminal Record revolves around two detectives with completely contrasting agendas, and since their methods significantly differ, they have conflicting opinions regarding a man&#39;s innocence in a murder case.




The cast of Criminal Record on Apple TV&#43; includes Peter Capaldi as Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Hegarty, Cush Jumbo as Detective Sergeant June Lenker, Zoë Wanamaker as Maureen, Charlie Creed-Miles as Detective Sergeant Tony Gilfoyle, Cathy Tyson as Doris Mathis, Stephen Campbell Moore as Leo Hanratty, Shaun Dooley as Detective Sergeant Kim Cardwell, and many other supporting actors. Most of the characters in the thriller series either work in law enforcement or are criminals or victims, and many of the actors can be recognized from their previous works.


 Peter Capaldi As Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Hegarty 
         

Peter Capaldi stars as Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Hegarty, one of the investigators at the center of the story in Criminal Record, and is one of the executive producers. Hegarty is a well-connected veteran in the world of law enforcement, and he led the murder case against Errol Mathis in the Apple TV&#43; series. Before Criminal Record, Capaldi&#39;s most remarkable role was as the 12th incarnation of the Doctor in Doctor Who. He starred in the science fiction series for three seasons before handing the reins to Jodie Whittaker, the first woman to play the Doctor. Capaldi&#39;s other credits include The Thick of It, Paddington, Christoper Robin, and The Suicide Squad.

 Cush Jumbo As Detective Sergeant June Lenker 
          

Cush Jumbo, also an executive producer, portrays the other central character in Criminal Record — Detective Sergeant June Lenker. June is a relatively new detective, so she is ambitious and looking to prove herself, meaning that she immediately butts heads with DCI Hegarty. June believes Errol Mathis is innocent and pushes back when Hegarty is confident they have solved the case. Aside from the Apple TV&#43; crime thriller show, Jumbo has starred in the Doctor Who spinoff, Torchwood, Vera, The Good Wife, and The Good Fight. The actress is also known for her roles in the theater productions of Julius Caesar and Hamlet.






 Zoë Wanamaker As Maureen

Wanamaker is known for her roles in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, My Week with Marilyn, Prime Suspect, Love Hurts, My Family, and Shadow and Bone. Similar to her onscreen daughter, Wanamaker also has a long and prestigious theater career, having won two Olivier awards (for Once in a Lifetime and Electra) and four Tony Award nominations.

Gilfoyle was a police officer who worked with Hegarty on the investigation into Adelaide Burrowes&#39;s murder that led to Errol Mathis&#39;s arrest. Before appearing in the crime thriller series, Creed-Miles starred in numerous films and television shows, and some of his most notable credits are Let Him Have It, London Kills Me, The Fifth Element, Essex Boys, King Arthur, Wild Bill, Romans, Five Days, Peaky Blinders, and World on Fire.



 Cathy Tyson As Doris Mathis

Viewers might recognize the English actress from her appearances in movies and series such as Mona Lisa, The Serpent and the Rainbow, Priest, and Band of Gold. Most recently, Tyson won the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2022 for her role as Polly in the British drama made-for-television film Help, which chronicles the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.






 Stephen Campbell Moore As Leo Hanratty 
          

Leo Hanratty, played by Stephen Campbell Moore, is Detective Sergeant June Lenker&#39;s husband in the 2024 crime thriller television show. Leo is a psychiatrist who tries to empathize with his wife&#39;s complex feelings over Errol Mathis&#39;s arrest and conviction but ultimately fails to validate them when June mentions racism. Aside from starring in Criminal Record, Moore has appeared in The History Boys, Season of the Witch, Burnt, Downton Abbey, Ben Hur, War of the Worlds, and One. The actor is also set to portray Major Marvin &#34;Red&#34; Bowman in another Apple TV&#43; drama, Masters of the Air.



 Shaun Dooley As Detective Sergeant Kim Cardwell 
          




Shaun Dooley stars as Detective Sergeant Kim Cardwell in Criminal Record on Apple TV&#43;. Cardwell previously worked alongside his former colleagues, Daniel Hegarty and Tony Gilfoyle, on the case of Adelaide Burrowes&#39;s murder. The detective&#39;s comments (aka microaggressions) in the series only further prove that systemic racism exists in law enforcement, as June tries to prove. Viewers might recognize Dooley from his appearances in Misfits, The White Queen, Broadchurch, Doctor Who, The Witcher, It&#39;s A Sin, Black Mirror, and Saltburn. Additionally, the actor is voicing the character of Freca in The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.
