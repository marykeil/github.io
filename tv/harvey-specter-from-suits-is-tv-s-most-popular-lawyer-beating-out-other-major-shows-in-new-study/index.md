## Literature Review

A new study finds that Harvey Specter from Suits is television&#39;s most popular lawyer, beating out others, including Better Call Saul&#39;s Saul Goodman.




A new study has found Gabriel Macht’s Harvey Specter from Suits is television’s most popular lawyer. Created in 2011 by Aaron Korsh for the USA Network, the witty legal drama most recently experienced an unexpected and record-breaking resurgence on Netflix throughout the latter half of 2023. Rising to the top of the Nielsen viewership charts four years after the last season aired, Suits would remain in the top slot for an impressive 12-week streak.




A new study conducted by injury lawyers Bader Scott has revealed that Suits’ Harvey Specter is the most popular television lawyer with an average of 137,551 monthly Google searches conducted for the character throughout 2023. Analyzing 70 popular TV lawyers and judges, Macht’s character beat out other popular fictional lawyers, including Breaking Bad’s and Better Call Saul’s Saul Goodman and Daredevil’s Matt Murdock. Other Suits characters, Louis Litt and Jessica Pearson, also appeared in third and ninth place in the list of the Top 10 most popular TV lawyers.

 Will Gabriel Macht’s Harvey Specter Appear In The New Suits Spinoff? 
          

Following the unexpected streaming resurgence of the original series, a new Suits spinoff show was officially announced in October 2023 with Korsh returning as showrunner. Marking the second spinoff after the short-lived Pearson show that followed Gina Torres’ character Jessica Pearson to Chicago, the new Suits show will see the franchise move its focus from New York to Los Angeles. According to Beatrice Springborn, president of Universal International Studios, the new show will also have “the same energy and good looking people that the original did.”

                  Where Was Suits Filmed? The Show&#39;s Filming Locations Explained   While the TV series Suits depicted the streets of Manhattan, the actual filming location brought a unique blend of effectiveness and versatility.   




While it is likely that the new show will introduce a whole new office full of fast-talking lawyers, given the overwhelming popularity of the original series and its characters, viewers may see several familiar faces return but only for a token cameo appearance. While Mike Ross actor Patrick J. Adams has recently intimated that he would “be ready to suit up again” if called upon, Macht has taken a break from acting since Suits ended in 2019.

Nonetheless, Macht also enjoyed a recent Suits reunion with his former co-stars at this year’s Golden Globes Awards. When he was questioned on the event’s red carpet by Hello! Magazine about a possible return, he admitted he did not know if he would be involved but suggested that “there is always a phone line or a number – and I always pick up the phone.” However, given Macht was 2023’s most popular television lawyer, Korsch may very well be tempted to make that call and lure the actor back onto viewers’ screens.
