## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist are ready for their live TV wedding on January 4, and their shocking officiant has been revealed.




The Golden Bachelor&#39;s golden couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist will be getting married live during their January 4 on-screen nuptials, and the officiant for the ceremony may be a shock to viewers of the popular series. Gerry and Theresa were engaged during The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale, where he chose to propose to her over his runner-up Leslie Fhima. While many women were vying for Gerry&#39;s heart during the season, the women weren&#39;t just competing for his love; they were forming bonds with one another in the process. After making life-long friends during The Golden Bachelor, Gerry and Theresa chose to include their cast in the wedding.




According to an interview the excited couple did with Glamour, The Golden Bachelor contestant Susan Noles will officiate Gerry and Theresa&#39;s upcoming wedding.


 

&#34;The happy couple came up with the idea because we became so close during the show,” Susan explained cheerfully. “Gerry’s my buddy and now Teresa is my girlfriend, so why not? I never asked them why, to tell you the truth. But I’m really glad they did.&#34; While Susan may not have asked, Gerry and Theresa&#39;s choice doesn&#39;t need much explanation, as The Golden Bachelorette contender Susan is a fan-favorite.


 Susan Noles Hope She Doesn&#39;t Stumble Over Her Words During Wedding 
          




Susan, whom Gerry eliminated prior to the hometown dates during The Golden Bachelor season 1, is a professional wedding officiant by trade, but she&#39;s still worried she&#39;s not entirely prepared for the pressures of doing her job on live TV. &#34;I hope I don’t stumble over words during the ceremony, but you freeze sometimes when you’re in front of so many people,&#34; Susan admitted, before sharing that she was touched by the request. &#34;The opportunity to do this is so special,&#34; she explained, &#34;because of the bond between the three of us. And I love doing it for people that I care about.”

While officiating a wedding for her ex-boyfriend and close friend on live TV is a first for Susan, she&#39;s a professional who has a personal stake in Gerry and Theresa&#39;s relationship. Although she&#39;ll definitely be feeling nervous about the live element to the wedding, Susan couldn&#39;t be more excited to be a part of something so special. After watching Theresa and Gerry fall in love before her eyes, Susan shared that she&#39;s excited to be officiating for a couple she feels she knows. The ability to speak from the heart will be exciting for The Golden Bachelor star and will surely bring an element of familiarity to the wedding.




While Susan may not have been the most obvious pick to officiate Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding, the fact that she&#39;ll be a part of their special day means a lot to her after being a part of their love story from the beginning. As a professional wedding officiant, Susan will be showing off her skills while adding an element of genuine emotion to the ceremony in highlighting her personal knowledge of Gerry and Theresa&#39;s relationship. While The Golden Bachelor was an event all on its own, Susan will be sure to make Gerry and Theresa&#39;s live TV wedding an even bigger deal than the series itself.

The Golden Wedding airs Thursday, January 4, 2024, at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
