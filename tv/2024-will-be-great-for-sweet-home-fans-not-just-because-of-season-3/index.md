## Literature Review
Sweet Home season 3 premiers in 2024, but that’s not the only reason why fans of the show’s cast should be excited for the rest of the year.




Sweet Home season 3 is coming out in 2024, but this is not the only reason why fans of the show’s cast should be excited. It took three years after the show&#39;s debut for Sweet Home season 2 to be released. Fortunately, the wait for season 3 will not be nearly as long. Sweet Home season 2’s ending included a title card confirming the show will return in 2024, which makes sense considering it was renewed for two new seasons in June 2022.




Sweet Home season 2’s cast saw the return of some of the show’s original characters, but it also introduced a lot of new names. The series includes many up-and-coming and established stars, including but not limited to Song Kang and Go Min-si. Most of the Sweet Home actors already have exciting new projects coming up, but two of them will be in a massive show that may premiere in 2024 as well.


 Two Sweet Home Actors Will Be In Squid Game Season 2 
         

Park Gyu-young and Lee Jin-uk, who play Ji-su and Sang Wook in Sweet Home, respectively, have both joined the cast of Squid Game. While Squid Game season 2’s release date has yet to be announced, the second chapter of Netflix’s pop culture phenomenon is expected to be released in late 2024. Squid Game was renewed for season 2 in June 2022, a few months after the first season took the world by storm. Regardless of when Squid Game will return, it is safe to say at least a trailer for season 2 will premiere in 2024, offering a first look at the show’s new cast and characters.





 

Lee Jin-uk’s and Park Gyu-young’s Squid Game characters remain to be revealed, but Netflix has described the new cast additions as “new players.” Assuming Squid Game season 2 does release in late 2024, fans of Sweet Home will get to see two of the series’ most important actors shine in one of Netflix’s biggest shows of all time, probably just a few months after the monster drama returns for season 3. Unfortunately, Park Gyu-young’s Ji-su died in Sweet Home season 2 and might not appear in season 3. Interestingly, Lee Jin-uk is essentially playing three characters after season 1 – Sang-won, posing as Ui-myeong, using Sang-wook’s body.



 What Squid Game Season 2 Can Learn From Sweet Home Season 2 
          




One of the most exciting things about Squide Game season 2 is how the show will handle its new cast, as most of the original characters were dead by the end of season 1. Even though important names, such as Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun and Lee Byung-hun’s Front Man, are returning, Squid Game will have to make audiences care about the new characters as much as they did for the previous 456 players. Squid Game could have been a standalone series just fine, but the show’s unprecedented success on Netflix meant that a second season was inevitable. This is exactly the challenge Sweet Home faced.



Squid Game will have to find the correct balance between sticking to the formula and doing something new.




Sweet Home is based on a webtoon, yet most of the source material was covered in season 1. The monster drama could have ended with just one season, and it would still have been a satisfying conclusion to the story. However, after Sweet Home quickly became a hit, the show was renewed for two additional seasons. The only way to continue the story was to reinvent the series, which is why there were so many new characters in Sweet Home season 2. Not everything about Sweet Home’s newest season worked, and Squid Game will have to find the correct balance between sticking to the formula and doing something new.
