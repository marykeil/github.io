<p>Gazelle’s Premiere Episode Clue
Gazelle Has A Connection To Mickey Rourke</p>
<p>During The Masked Singer season 10 premiere, Gazelle shared a clue about herself, stating, &ldquo;Are you ready to guess who I am? If you can remember the A-list celebrity that donned this mask in season 4, that&rsquo;s your first clue to my identity.&rdquo; The mask she was referring to was Mickey Rourke&rsquo;s Gremlin, which revealed that she had an association with the actor.</p>
<p>Gazelle’s First Performance &amp; Clues
&ldquo;Uninvited&rdquo; by Alanis Morissette</p>
<p>Gazelle stunned everyone with her spectacular first performance of Alanis Morissette&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uninvited.&rdquo; When she came out on stage, Jenny commented that she was &ldquo;very petite,&rdquo; and Robin agreed that she was &ldquo;dainty.&rdquo; Gazelle began her clue package saying, &ldquo;Like a gazelle, I&rsquo;ve always leapt headfirst into opportunities to be on stage.&rdquo; She was seen walking in the woods in between a silver trailer and a sign that read, &ldquo;Auditions Today!&rdquo; Gazelle continued, &ldquo;After seeing a Broadway show at six years old, I knew that I wanted to perform for a living.&rdquo; She looked at a sign that said, &ldquo;Hello Doll! Starring Gazelle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazelle went on to say, &ldquo;When I was just a teenager, I took a huge chance, and performed in a national talent competition. But I crashed and burned. It was super bad, and made me almost swear off singing for good.&rdquo; Gazelle was shown performing cheerleading moves, while a fake Gazelle wearing a Hawaiian shirt with palm trees shook its head no, and boos were heard in the background. Blue and white cheerleading pom poms were also in the scene.</p>
<p>Gazelle then said, &ldquo;But music was always my first love.&rdquo; Gazelle paused to look at three statues of bulldogs that seemed to point her in the right direction. She added, &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m ready to prove to myself that I can get up there again and give it my all. There&rsquo;s so much beauty in conquering your fears. And it really helps if you can face them behind a gorgeous Gazelle mask.&rdquo; At the end of the clip, Gazelle made it to the top of a mountain.</p>
<p>After Gazelle&rsquo;s performance, David Spade, host of Snake Oil, brought out a clue. It was a record that said, &ldquo;Movie Soundtrack.&rdquo; Gazelle explained, &ldquo;Well, not only do I act in movies, I also sing in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s NFL Night Performance &amp; Clues
&ldquo;The One That Got Away&rdquo; by Katy Perry</p>
<p>During NFL Night, Gazelle performed a beautiful, emotional, and slowed-down rendition of Katy Perry&rsquo;s &ldquo;The One That Got Away.&rdquo; During the performance, Gazelle removed her cloak, revealing more of her body type. Gazelle shared, &ldquo;Last week, was such a redemptive experience. Now I am ready to tackle the competition because I&rsquo;m feeling right at home here on this stage.&rdquo; As she said this, she was shown being walked out onto a football field without her costume on, where she appeared to be singing.</p>
<p>Gazelle went on to say, &ldquo;There were a lot of times I didn&rsquo;t know if there was a place for me in the entertainment industry. At just eight years old, I was pressured to change my name to blend in more with the herd.&rdquo; A photograph of a young gazelle wearing a pink shirt with white flowers and a Hawaiian lei was shown. Gazelle continued, &ldquo;Casting directors couldn&rsquo;t figure out where I fit because of my unique look.&rdquo; Sand then blew across the screen to transition to the next scene. A wooden sign that read, &ldquo;Threat Level: 3&rdquo; was then shown, as Robin commented that Gazelle must be a triple threat.</p>
<p>A test with a grade of &lsquo;A&rsquo; displayed on a well was then revealed, as Gazelle said, &ldquo;I wondered if I could ever truly be myself and pursue my greatest passions.&rdquo; Gazelle continued, &ldquo;Fortunately, the world is changing, and there are more opportunities every day.&rdquo; A blue surfboard was then seen. Gazelle concluded with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of my heritage, and proud to continue to blaze a trail for little girls who look like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Gazelle&rsquo;s performance, NFL player Antonio Gates brought out a clue to her identity. It was a football with the word &ldquo;Villain&rdquo; written on it. Gazelle explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not actually a villain, but I can play the part. Gazelle&rsquo;s got range.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s 2000s Night Performance &amp; Clues
&ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; by Britney Spears</p>
<p>On The Masked Singer season 10&rsquo;s 2000s Night, Gazelle sang an awesome version of &ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; by Britney Spears and did a dance routine in the middle of the performance. Gazelle began her clue package by gushing about why she loves her Gazelle mask so much. She shared, &ldquo;I love this costume. I have to tell you, the first time I saw it, I started crying.&rdquo; A clip of Gazelle seeing her costume for the first time was then shown, with her saying it was &ldquo;so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazelle explained, &ldquo;Deer are really meaningful to me because they are a symbol of someone I loved and lost.&rdquo; Gazelle shared, &ldquo;It happened just a few weeks before my wedding. One of the most important people in the world to my husband and I passed away unexpectedly.&rdquo; An animated mouse and a bouquet of flowers were then shown. Robin commented that the mouse indicated that Gazelle had to be a Disney star. Next, a screen with Gazelle&rsquo;s clue package was shown on a dresser that also had a picture of her and a male Gazelle. Silver balloons that said &ldquo;Masked Singer 10&rdquo; were above it.</p>
<p>Gazelle continued, &ldquo;We somehow carried on with the wedding, but it was all a blur. Except during our vows, when suddenly rain started pouring down on us.&rdquo; A dog tag that read &ldquo;Masked Singer Season 10 Private Identity&rdquo; was then shown. Gazelle went on to say, &ldquo;It was magical. We knew then that our loved one was there with us.&rdquo; Gazelle was shown standing in a rainstorm. Gazelle concluded, &ldquo;When I put on the Gazelle mask, I carry his adventurous spirit with me, and I know he&rsquo;s a part of my secret to success here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Gazelle&rsquo;s performance, Kate Flannery, who played Meredith Palmer on The Office brought out another clue, which was a DVD with the title &ldquo;Gazellez Love Story&rdquo; with the line, &ldquo;Gazelle&rsquo;s big feature film debut&rdquo; on the cover. Gazelle explained, &ldquo;The 2000s are a special time for me because it was when I had my film debut.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s Disco Night (Group A Finals) Performances &amp; Clues
&ldquo;On the Radio&rdquo; by Donna Summer, &ldquo;I Will Survive&rdquo; by Gloria Gaynor</p>
<p>During The Masked Singer Group A finals, which took place on Disco Night, Gazelle sang and danced to a thrilling version of &ldquo;On the Radio&rdquo; by Donna Summer. She began her clue package by saying, &ldquo;Making it to the Group A finals feels incredible. I&rsquo;m one step closer to the finale, and I&rsquo;m not going to stop here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked what kind of kid she was growing up, Gazelle replied, &ldquo;I was truly a hammy, performative kid. Every night I would wear a different costume, stand at the top of our stairs, and put on a show for my family.&rdquo; At that point, Gazelle picked up an envelope with an American flag stamp that said, &ldquo;A Letter to:&rdquo; with three hand-drawn red hearts. Ken, Nick, and Robin&rsquo;s faces were in the hearts.</p>
<p>Gazelle continued, &ldquo;But I was definitely the black sheep. My parents were athletes. My sister was always focused on academics. Despite being so different from them, they&rsquo;ve always shown me nothing but support.&rdquo; Gazelle then picked up a magnifying glass and looked at the word, &ldquo;MYSTERY.&rdquo; She concluded by saying, &ldquo;My parents made a lot of sacrifices for me. They uprooted their entire lives, just so I could live my dreams, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be here without them. So, tonight, this performance is a thank you for their unconditional love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Gazelle&rsquo;s performance, another clue was revealed, which was the panelist that she was connected to. The clue was a model of an island with a sign that said, &ldquo;Island Vibes.&rdquo; Gazelle explained, &ldquo;Hey, Nicole. Just like you, I too hold the islands close to my heart.&rdquo; Later in the episode, Gazelle went head-to-head with Cow in the Battle Royale when they both sang &ldquo;I Will Survive&rdquo; by Gloria Gaynor. Cow won the battle, but Ken couldn&rsquo;t bear to see Gazelle be eliminated, so he saved her with the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell, and they both made it to the season finale.</p>

<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s Holiday Sing-A-Long Performance &amp; Clues
&ldquo;Underneath the Tree&rdquo; by Kelly Clarkson</p>
<p>During The Masked Singer Holiday Sing-A-Long, Gazelle sang a joyous rendition of &ldquo;Underneath the Tree&rdquo; by Kelly Clarkson. She reviewed her Group A journey to the season finale. During the &ldquo;Mask on the Street&rdquo; segment, she revealed that, for her favorite genre of music, she loves any type of musical theater. When asked what era of music she grew up in, she said, &ldquo;The 90s, baby!&rdquo; while shaking her hips.The Masked Singer then revealed another clue about Gazelle&rsquo;s true identity. It was an umbrella. She explained, &ldquo;Thank you, thank you, thank you! This clue is dear to my heart, and with this umbrella, I guess you could call me a RAIN deer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazelle then said that, one time, she asked her husband to do a 45-second dance for her to his favorite Christmas song, and he chose &ldquo;Underneath the Tree&rdquo; by Kelly Clarkson. Now, every time they hear it, they laugh because it brings them back to that funny family memory. Gazelle then sang her own version of the song.</p>
<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s The Masked Singer Season 10 Finale Performances &amp; Clues
&ldquo;Chasing Cars&rdquo; by Snow Patrol</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 10 finale opened with the four finalists&ndash;Gazelle, Cow, Donut, and Sea Queen&ndash;performing together for the first time. They sang an exciting version of &ldquo;What I Like About You&rdquo; by The Romantics. Gazelle later sang a beautifully emotional version of &ldquo;Chasing Cars&rdquo; by Snow Patrol.</p>
<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s Masked Singer season 10 finale night package looked back on her journey on the show. She began by saying, &ldquo;I would be surprised if anyone in Masked Singer history was more suited to their costume than I am to the Gazelle. I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that deer are really meaningful to me because of my loved one that I lost. But what I didn&rsquo;t say is that I actually have a deer tattoo for that person, with flowers growing out of the antlers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazelle continued, &ldquo;So, when I saw the sketch of the Gazelle, that looked so much like my tattoo, I broke down shaking and sobbing. It just felt like fate. Now, having gotten to be in the Gazelle mask for a while, I can definitely say that she feels like this alter ego of me that I&rsquo;ve been craving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazelle added, &ldquo;When I put her on, all my insecurities and fears are gone. I was given a second chance to keep this mask on, and I&rsquo;m not going to waste it. Becoming the Gazelle has really helped me come into my inner goddess. And, while this may be our last night together, the power she&rsquo;s given me is a feeling I&rsquo;ll never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gazelle’s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists
None Of The Panelists Guessed Gazelle Correctly</p>
<p>After Gazelle&rsquo;s first Masked Singer season 10 performance, the panelists had some interesting guesses for her identity, including some actresses who are also singers. Jenny thought Gazelle might be Riverdale actress Camila Mendes, while Robin guessed that she was Lucy Hale. Nicole theorized that Vanessa Hudgens might be under Gazelle&rsquo;s mask. Although many fans on social media have been guessing that Gazelle is Carrie Underwood, the clue about her crashing and burning during a national talent competition seems to have ruled her out, since Carrie won American Idol season 4.</p>
<p>During NFL Night, Jenny used the villain clue to guess Gossip Girl&rsquo;s Leighton Meester. However, Ken thought that Gazelle might be Constance Wu. He got choked up when he made the guess because Constance is a dear friend of his, and Gazelle&rsquo;s voice moved him. Nicole thought that, because Gazelle spoke about not fitting in with the herd and had a surfboard and Hawaiian shirt clues, she might be Auliʻi Cravalho, the voice of Moana in Disney&rsquo;s animated feature film, Moana.</p>
<p>On 2000s Night, Robin thought that the clues pointed toward Mandy Moore, but he wasn&rsquo;t hearing her vocal tone. Nicole pointed out that Gazelle having a husband eliminated a lot of their past guesses. She guessed that Gazelle might be Hilary Duff, while Jenny wondered if she was Ashley Tisdale.</p>
<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s Disco Night clue about the islands again made Nicole think about Auliʻi Cravalho and Vanessa Hudgens. However, neither of them are married, so Nicole was stumped. Robin thought of Hawaiian superstars such as Maggie Q, while Ken stuck with his guess of Constance Wu. The final guesses before Ken saved Gazelle from her unmasking were Maggie Q (Robin), Constance Wu (Ken), and Vanessa Hudgens (Nicole). However, Jenny was on the right track with her guess of Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell.</p>
<p>On The Masked Singer season 10 finale, the panelists offered their final guesses for Gazelle. They included Ashley Tisdale (Robin and Jenny), Constance Wu (Ken), and Gina Rodriguez (Nicole). However, none of the panelists guessed Gazelle correctly.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Gazelle&rsquo;s Identity Is Revealed
Gazelle Is Janel Parrish</p>
<p>Although The Masked Singer panelists had some great guesses, Gazelle was actually actress and singer Janel Parrish. Janel was born in Kāne&rsquo;ohe, Honolulu, Hawaii, which explained the many Hawaii clues. Her parents are former bodybuilders, and her mother worked in a Honolulu health club, which explained them being athletes. Janel began her acting career when she appeared as Young Cosette in the national touring company of Les Misérables, and later played the role on Broadway for two months. When Janel was 14, she appeared on Star Search, which explained the national talent competition clue. She later starred in several Disney Channel shows and films, which connected to the mouse.</p>
<p>Janel made her film debut in 2007, playing Jade in Bratz. The title of the movie, Gazellez Love Story, from Gazelle&rsquo;s DVD clue was a play on the spelling of Bratz. The Holiday Sing-A-Long umbrella clue refers to Janel&rsquo;s 2007 single from the Bratz movie, &ldquo;Rainy Day.&rdquo; She made a music video for the song as well. The three dogs could refer to the movie Triple Dog, in which Janel appeared in 2010.</p>
<p>Janel later played villain Mona Vanderwaal on the mystery teen drama Pretty Little Liars from 2010-2017, for which she won four Choice TV - Villain awards at the Teen Choice Awards, which explained the villain references. It also explained the grade of &ldquo;A&rdquo; on the test paper because Mona&rsquo;s alias was &ldquo;A.&rdquo; She also sent letters during the series, like the one with Ken, Nick, and Robin&rsquo;s faces. Janel also played Mona in the 2019 spin-off, Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists. In 2018, she starred in Tiger alongside Mickey Rourke, who was in her premiere night clue.</p>
<p>Tragically, in 2018, two weeks before her wedding to her husband, chemical engineer Chris Long, Janel&rsquo;s father-in-law, Herbert &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; Long, was killed by a drunk driver at the age of 74, while riding his motorcycle. Janel has shared that, during their vows, when Chris spoke about his father, rain started to pour on them. This story matches the one from Gazelle&rsquo;s 2000s Night clue package.</p>
<p>The dog tag referenced the fact that Buck was the son of a military officer and served in the U.S. Navy. Janel has many tattoos, but the one she referred to is on the nape of her neck. It&rsquo;s a deer, also known as a buck, in honor of her father-in-law. She and her husband got matching buck tattoos in October 2018 as a tribute to him.</p>
<p>As The Masked Singer season 10&rsquo;s Gazelle, Janel had so many dazzling performances. Janel raced to the top of the competition as Gazelle, impressing everyone with her stellar vocals. Her voice was pure and conveyed all of her emotions. Janel was one of the best singers the show has ever had. When she was unmasked, she again sang &ldquo;On the Radio,&rdquo; in a triumphant moment. Janel set the bar high for future performances on The Masked Singer.</p>
