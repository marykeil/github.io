Ken, Nick, and Robin&#39;s faces were in the hearts.

Gazelle continued, &#34;But I was definitely the black sheep. My parents were athletes. My sister was always focused on academics.

They sang an exciting version of &#34;What I Like About You&#34; by The Romantics. Gazelle later sang a beautifully emotional version of &#34;Chasing Cars&#34; by Snow Patrol. 

Gazelle&#39;s Masked Singer season 10 finale night package looked back on her journey on the show. She began by saying, &#34;I would be surprised if anyone in Masked Singer history was more suited to their costume than I am to the Gazelle. I&#39;ve mentioned before that deer are really meaningful to me because of my loved one that I lost. But what I didn&#39;t say is that I actually have a deer tattoo for that person, with flowers growing out of the antlers.&#34;




Gazelle continued, &#34;So, when I saw the sketch of the Gazelle, that looked so much like my tattoo, I broke down shaking and sobbing. It just felt like fate.

 Gazelle’s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists 
None Of The Panelists Guessed Gazelle Correctly
         

After Gazelle&#39;s first Masked Singer season 10 performance, the panelists had some interesting guesses for her identity, including some actresses who are also singers. Jenny thought Gazelle might be Riverdale actress Camila Mendes, while Robin guessed that she was Lucy Hale. Nicole theorized that Vanessa Hudgens might be under Gazelle&#39;s mask. Although many fans on social media have been guessing that Gazelle is Carrie Underwood, the clue about her crashing and burning during a national talent competition seems to have ruled her out, since Carrie won American Idol season 4.




During NFL Night, Jenny used the villain clue to guess Gossip Girl&#39;s Leighton Meester. However, Ken thought that Gazelle might be Constance Wu. He got choked up when he made the guess because Constance is a dear friend of his, and Gazelle&#39;s voice moved him. Nicole thought that, because Gazelle spoke about not fitting in with the herd and had a surfboard and Hawaiian shirt clues, she might be Auliʻi Cravalho, the voice of Moana in Disney&#39;s animated feature film, Moana.

On 2000s Night, Robin thought that the clues pointed toward Mandy Moore, but he wasn&#39;t hearing her vocal tone. Nicole pointed out that Gazelle having a husband eliminated a lot of their past guesses. She guessed that Gazelle might be Hilary Duff, while Jenny wondered if she was Ashley Tisdale.

Gazelle&#39;s Disco Night clue about the islands again made Nicole think about Auliʻi Cravalho and Vanessa Hudgens. However, neither of them are married, so Nicole was stumped. Robin thought of Hawaiian superstars such as Maggie Q, while Ken stuck with his guess of Constance Wu. The final guesses before Ken saved Gazelle from her unmasking were Maggie Q (Robin), Constance Wu (Ken), and Vanessa Hudgens (Nicole). However, Jenny was on the right track with her guess of Pretty Little Liars star Shay Mitchell.




On The Masked Singer season 10 finale, the panelists offered their final guesses for Gazelle. They included Ashley Tisdale (Robin and Jenny), Constance Wu (Ken), and Gina Rodriguez (Nicole). However, none of the panelists guessed Gazelle correctly.

                  The Masked Singer: Sea Queen Identity &amp; Clues   The Masked Singer season 10 featured 16 mystery celebrities competing for the Golden Mask trophy. Here&#39;s how the clues revealed Sea Queen&#39;s identity.    



 Gazelle&#39;s Identity Is Revealed 
Gazelle Is Janel Parrish

 

Although The Masked Singer panelists had some great guesses, Gazelle was actually actress and singer Janel Parrish. Janel was born in Kāne&#39;ohe, Honolulu, Hawaii, which explained the many Hawaii clues. Her parents are former bodybuilders, and her mother worked in a Honolulu health club, which explained them being athletes. Janel began her acting career when she appeared as Young Cosette in the national touring company of Les Misérables, and later played the role on Broadway for two months. When Janel was 14, she appeared on Star Search, which explained the national talent competition clue. She later starred in several Disney Channel shows and films, which connected to the mouse.




Janel made her film debut in 2007, playing Jade in Bratz. The title of the movie, Gazellez Love Story, from Gazelle&#39;s DVD clue was a play on the spelling of Bratz. The Holiday Sing-A-Long umbrella clue refers to Janel&#39;s 2007 single from the Bratz movie, &#34;Rainy Day.&#34; She made a music video for the song as well. The three dogs could refer to the movie Triple Dog, in which Janel appeared in 2010.

Janel later played villain Mona Vanderwaal on the mystery teen drama Pretty Little Liars from 2010-2017, for which she won four Choice TV - Villain awards at the Teen Choice Awards, which explained the villain references. It also explained the grade of &#34;A&#34; on the test paper because Mona&#39;s alias was &#34;A.&#34; She also sent letters during the series, like the one with Ken, Nick, and Robin&#39;s faces. Janel also played Mona in the 2019 spin-off, Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists. In 2018, she starred in Tiger alongside Mickey Rourke, who was in her premiere night clue.




Tragically, in 2018, two weeks before her wedding to her husband, chemical engineer Chris Long, Janel&#39;s father-in-law, Herbert &#34;Buck&#34; Long, was killed by a drunk driver at the age of 74, while riding his motorcycle. Janel has shared that, during their vows, when Chris spoke about his father, rain started to pour on them. This story matches the one from Gazelle&#39;s 2000s Night clue package.

The dog tag referenced the fact that Buck was the son of a military officer and served in the U.S. Navy. Janel has many tattoos, but the one she referred to is on the nape of her neck. It&#39;s a deer, also known as a buck, in honor of her father-in-law. She and her husband got matching buck tattoos in October 2018 as a tribute to him.

As The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Gazelle, Janel had so many dazzling performances. Janel raced to the top of the competition as Gazelle, impressing everyone with her stellar vocals. Her voice was pure and conveyed all of her emotions. Janel was one of the best singers the show has ever had. When she was unmasked, she again sang &#34;On the Radio,&#34; in a triumphant moment. Janel set the bar high for future performances on The Masked Singer.
