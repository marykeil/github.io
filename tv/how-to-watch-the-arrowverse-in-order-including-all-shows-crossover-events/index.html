  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Arrowverse made its mark as a sprawling, ambitious franchise of DC superhero shows and remains popular years after its launch.</p>
<p>The hub of connected DC TV shows dubbed the Arrowverse spans eight main series and two web series - here&rsquo;s how to watch the Arrowverse from start to finish. Beginning humbly with its first live-action series, Arrow, in 2012, it eventually spawned a small empire of superhero media that is often compared to its contemporary big-screen projects in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The Arrowverse remains popular over a decade after its launch and is known for recurring characters across its shared series&rsquo; and its numerous crossover events.</p>
<p>Following Arrow&rsquo;s launch was The Flash, the longest running Arrowverse show. The first Arrowverse crossover event between the two snowballed as more heroes and shows joined the roster of this television-only DC universe. The Arrowverse is best watched in release order as necessitated by the constant additions of new shows and characters, along with the concurrent crossover events. Here&rsquo;s every show in the Arrowverse from the very first season of Arrow to the last ever of The Flash.</p>
