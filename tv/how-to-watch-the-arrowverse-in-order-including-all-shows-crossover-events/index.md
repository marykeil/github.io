# How To Watch The Arrowverse In Order Including All Shows &amp; Crossover Events


## SUMMARY 



  The Arrowverse spans multiple TV shows and web series, starting with Arrow in 2012 and continuing to expand over the years.   The Arrowverse is best watched in release order due to the constant additions of new shows and characters, as well as the crossover events.   The last major Arrowverse event is the five-episode event that starts off The Flash season 8, called Armageddon, though it&#39;s not a true crossover.

## Literature Review

The Arrowverse made its mark as a sprawling, ambitious franchise of DC superhero shows and remains popular years after its launch.




The hub of connected DC TV shows dubbed the Arrowverse spans eight main series and two web series - here&#39;s how to watch the Arrowverse from start to finish. Beginning humbly with its first live-action series, Arrow, in 2012, it eventually spawned a small empire of superhero media that is often compared to its contemporary big-screen projects in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The Arrowverse remains popular over a decade after its launch and is known for recurring characters across its shared series&#39; and its numerous crossover events.




Following Arrow&#39;s launch was The Flash, the longest running Arrowverse show. The first Arrowverse crossover event between the two snowballed as more heroes and shows joined the roster of this television-only DC universe. The Arrowverse is best watched in release order as necessitated by the constant additions of new shows and characters, along with the concurrent crossover events. Here&#39;s every show in the Arrowverse from the very first season of Arrow to the last ever of The Flash.
