## Literature Review
The early Rotten Tomatoes score for True Detective season 4 has arrived, and the latest iteration of the hit crime drama sets a new series record.




True Detective season 4, subtitled Night Country, has debuted on Rotten Tomatoes and set a new record for the series. After season 1 made waves upon its release in 2014, the show, which is created by Nic Pizzolatto, would return for two subsequent seasons in 2015 and 2019, each following different detectives on new casea. Now, True Detective: Night Country is set to take the action to Alaska, following two detectives as they investigate the disappearance of six men from a research station.




Ahead of True Detective: Night Country&#39;s premiere later this month, Rotten Tomatoes reveals that the season has debuted with a 100% score with 13 reviews, making it the highest-scoring season so far.


 

As of this writing, the show remains at 100% but now with 19 reviews, though the score is likely to fluctuate as more reviews are added. Season 1, widely considered the show&#39;s best, was the previous record-holder at 91%. Check out a chart comparing the different seasons&#39; scores below:

                  True Detective Season 3 Ending Explained: Why The Finale Was Perfect   True Detective season 3&#39;s finale has proven divisive, going for thematic closure over mystery. Here&#39;s why it was a brilliant end to the show.    


 What Critics Are Saying About True Detective: Night Country 
          

After the critically-acclaimed season 1, True Detective&#39;s reviews have been mixed to say the least. While season 3 arguably got the show back on track after a poorly-received season 2, it&#39;s generally considered to still fall short of the series&#39; debut, which starred Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. The True Detective: Night Country cast features Jodie Foster and Kali Reis taking center stage in a new Alaskan mystery, and the two leads are seemingly part of a larger return to form for the series.






Night Country is the first True Detective season not to be penned by creator Pizzolatto, with Issa LÃ³pez taking on writing, directing, and showrunning duties.




Benji Wilson of The Telegraph, for example, calls the new season &#34;spectacular, terrifying and unforgettable&#34; in his review. In addition to heaping praise upon both Foster and Reis, Collider&#39;s review from Carly Lane draws attention to the compelling mystery at the center of the story, writing that the show &#34;knows how to walk the line between the inexplicable and the obvious, irresistibly dangling each possible narrative thread in front of us to tug on.&#34;

In addition to praise regarding the storytelling and performances, True Detective: Night Country is seemingly also the most unsettling season thus far, with Caryn James of the BBC writing that the show gets &#34;really creepy, in a good way.&#34; While THR&#39;s review from Daniel Fienberg also points out the show&#39;s many strengths, the reviewer does express some disappointment at the season&#39;s reduced episode count (season 4 has 6 instead of 8 episodes), which he says hampers certain story points.






True Detective: Night Country premieres on HBO on January 14, 2024.
