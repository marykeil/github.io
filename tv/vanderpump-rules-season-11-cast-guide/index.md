## Literature Review
After the dramatic events of season 10, Vanderpump Rules will return for season 11, with an ensemble of the old cast members and some new twists. 




Vanderpump Rules season 11 will return to the screens featuring most of the same cast members. Vanderpump Rules season 10 ended its run as one of the most-watched reality TV shows of 2023 after featuring the reality TV scandal of the year, quickly termed &#34;Scandoval,” following Tom Sandoval&#39;s affair with Raquel Leviss, who was in a long-term relationship with one of Raquel&#39;s closest friends Ariana Madix. After the dramatic revelations of Vanderpump Rules season 10 three-part reunion series, the show dominated headlines for months due to the fallout of some of the cast members.




Unsurprisingly, Bravo confirmed that Vanderpump Rules had been renewed for another season in May 2023, and the network has since revealed the new season will premiere on January 30, 2024. However, while most of the cast members are expected to return, Raquel will not appear in Vanderpump Rules season 11. Nonetheless, there is much drama to unpack, judging by the recently released extended preview of the upcoming season.

 Ariana Madix 
         

After nine years of dating Sandoval, Ariana ended Vanderpump Rules season 10 heartbroken and at the center of a scandal after it was revealed that Tom had been having an affair with Ariana&#39;s close friend and Vanderpump Rules co-star Raquel. The shocking revelation dubbed &#34;Scandoval&#34; rocked the Vanderpump Rules fandom. Still, nine months after the revelation, Ariana has starred on Dancing With The Stars and is reportedly in a new relationship with Daniel Wai.




However, Ariana will return for Vanderpump Rules season 11, as she was pictured filming the show in June (via Glamour). Unsurprisingly, reports stated that Ariana refused to film with Tom as the two are still not even on talking terms. Nonetheless, Vanderpump Rules season 11 will provide a better picture of their split and current relationship.



 Katie Maloney 
          

Katie Maloney was named among the Vanderpump Rules cast returning for season 11. Katie&#39;s Vanderpump Rules season 10 appearance documented the aftermath of her divorce from Tom Schwartz after six years of marriage and 12 years together overall. Despite her emotional struggles filming Vanderpump Rules season 10, the time still served as a period of growth for Katie, and she ended the season looking forward to opening her sandwich shop with Ariana.




However, Katie&#39;s problems with ex-husband Schwartz aren&#39;t over, as she lost her cool after Tom revealed he once kissed co-star Scheana Shay in the Vanderpump Rules season 11 trailer. Shockingly, the trailer also teases a love triangle between Katie, Tom, and a mystery woman they were both filmed kissing. Katie&#39;s relationship with Schwartz will be taking another turn in Vanderpump Rules season 11.



 Scheana Shay 

 

Scheana is another Vanderpump Rules veteran returning for season 11. Scheana got married to husband Brock Davies during Vanderpump Rules Season 10 and eventually looked to have had her issues with Raquel a bit settled when Raquel dropped the restraining order she filed against Scheana. However, Scheana might find herself facing a lot of heat in the new season, judging by some of the clips shown in the Vanderpump Rules season 11 trailer. Scheana&#39;s friendship with Katie might be on shaky ground, especially after Schwartz&#39;s revelation that they kissed. Also, the trailer teases a tense argument between Scheana and Sandoval after she tries to call him out for cheating.






 Tom Sandoval 
         

Sandoval&#39;s cheating admission made him the de facto villain of Vanderpump Rules season 10. However, Tom will be returning in Vanderpump Rules season 11, where fans will see him deal with the effects of all his cheating revelations and his subsequent split from Ariana. According to some moments from the Vanderpump Rules season 11 trailer, Tom will face a lot of heat from his co-stars about his cheating. His actions have also divided the cast members, as some can&#39;t decide whether to keep their friendship with him. Nonetheless, the aftermath of the scandal has seen Tom trying to better himself, and he&#39;s also been reportedly spotted with a mystery woman, per Bravo.



 Tom Schwartz 
          




On the back of his divorce from Katie, which already made him persona non grata on the show, Schwartz&#39;s appeal within the Vanderpump Rules fanbase suffered another hit when it became clear he knew about Scandoval way earlier than anyone. He still tried to lie about it during the season 10 reunion. Still, Schwartz signed up for another season and will return alongside his co-stars in Vanderpump Rules season 11.

However, judging by the sneak peek into the new season, Schwartz&#39;s troubles aren&#39;t over, as he was shown confessing to Lala Kent that he kissed Scheana while he was apparently still married to Katie. Schwartz&#39;s confessions will reopen old wounds with Katie and result in a tense discussion between Scheana and her husband, Brock. Surprisingly, that seems to be the least of Schwartz&#39;s worries, as he&#39;ll reportedly find himself in a love triangle involving his ex-wife, Katie, in the new season.



 Lisa Vanderpump 

 




Despite being the person the show is named after, Lisa Vanderpump is no longer one of the show&#39;s main characters. However, her occasional appearance in the series often makes her the needed authority figure on the show. During the Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion, Lisa earned many plaudits for criticizing Raquel and calling her out for how she betrayed Ariana. However, Lisa also clashed with some cast members for defending Sandoval. Still, Lisa has been announced as one of the returning cast members of Vanderpump Rules season 11.



 DJ James Kennedy 

 

While the Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion already had what it takes to make it iconic due to the Scandoval controversy, DJ James Kennedy&#39;s antics provided additional entertainment throughout the season. First, he called out Sandoval&#39;s crocodile tears about his affair with Raquel before the two almost came to blows soon after. James was once engaged to Raquel and felt betrayed by Tom&#39;s actions.




Besides facing a couple of hiccups due to his drinking problem, which he has tried to keep in check, James is one of the most popular cast members of Vanderpump Rules. Since first appearing on the show in 2015, James&#39; humor and short temper have created some memorable moments on the show. James will also return for Vanderpump Rules season 11.



 Lala Kent 
          

Since joining the show in 2015, Lala Kent has become one of Vanderpump Rules&#39; rising stars. However, like everyone, Vanderpump Rules season 10 events made Lisa feel gross and shocked. Still, she didn&#39;t hold back during the Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion as she boldly called out Sandoval and Raquel for their betrayal. Nonetheless, Lala will return for Vanderpump Rules season 11, and it looks like she&#39;ll be at the center of a major controversy after Schwartz was recorded confessing to her about kissing Schaena.






 Brock Davies (Friend Of) 
          

Brock&#39;s wedding ceremony to Scheana was one of the highlights of Vanderpump Rules season 10. Although Brock has appeared on the show only sparingly in the previous seasons, his role will become quite prevalent in Vanderpump Rules season 11. The revelation that Scheana might have cheated on him by kissing Schwartz looks to be one of the major storylines of the new season.



 Ally Lewber (Friend Of) 
          

Ally Lewber joined the Vanderpump Rules season 10 as James&#39; girlfriend. Ally faced many questions about their relationship during the Vanderpump Rules season 10 reunion, including her opinion on James&#39; decision to start drinking again. Since the season finale of Vanderpump Rules season 10, Ally and James&#39; relationship has progressed quite well, and she will return for Vanderpump Rules season 11.






Vanderpump Rules is returning on January 30, 2024 at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
