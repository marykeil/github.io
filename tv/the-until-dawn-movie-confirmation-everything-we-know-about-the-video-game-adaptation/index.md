## Literature Review

The acclaimed horror video game Until Dawn is being adapted into a movie, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the new project.




The widely acclaimed horror video game Until Dawn is being adapted for the big screen, and there are already several updates concerning the next hit gaming adaptation. Released in 2015 and developed by Supermassive Games, Until Dawn draws heavy inspiration from horror movies of the past and follows a group of young people who are tormented by evil forces while staying in a remote cabin. The game was specifically designed to terrify the player, and it was made with a cinematic edge, including recognizable actors in the main roles.




While the gameplay itself was rather light, Until Dawn scored points for its brilliant story, well-written script, and the performances of stars like Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, and Peter Stormare. Follow-ups were developed, and a spiritual successor, The Quarry, was released in 2022, which scored equally high marks from gaming critics and fans alike. Naturally, with such a cinematic game, it only makes sense that Hollywood would want to adapt Until Dawn into a feature film. 


 The Until Dawn Movie Is Confirmed 
          

Nearly 10 years after the game&#39;s debut, it has officially been announced that Until Dawn will be adapted into a film by the studio Screen Gems. While little is known about the project at this juncture, a writer and director are already attached, which seems to suggest the project is in good hands. Director David F. Sandberg will helm the project while screenwriter Gary Dauberman has handled the adaptation. Screen Gems aims to deliver an R-rated project that will do justice to the original game&#39;s story which was written by Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick. 






 Who Is Making The Until Dawn Movie? 
          

While Screen Gems is producing the film, the most exciting news about the project so far is that director David F. Sandberg will helm the new movie. Sandberg initially wowed with his low-budget horror film Lights Out in 2016, and moved on to bigger projects like Annabelle: Creation and the box-office smash Shazam! for the DCEU. Besides his experience with horror, Sandberg is also no stranger to big-budget projects, which makes him a more well-rounded director than most horror mavens. 

Likewise, the script is partially penned by Gary Dauberman, who is responsible for the most recent draft after it was initially written by Blair Butler. Dauberman has penned a slew of films in the Conjuring universe, including The Nun, Annabelle, and its sequel Creation, where he worked alongside Sandberg. This familiarity between the screenwriter and director is a good sign for the Until Dawn movie as the duo have found great success together in the past. 






 The Until Dawn Movie Story 
          

Nothing has been revealed about the story of the upcoming movie, but it can be assumed that it will follow the plot of the game in some way. The idea is rather simple, with a group of young people staying in a remote cabin where they are tormented by a deadly force that resembles the stuff of nightmares. The biggest challenge that the film will face is finding a way to incorporate the game&#39;s butterfly effect narrative. 

Unlike other games that lock the player on a designated story track, Until Dawn allowed the player to make choices that radically affected the outcome. Whether it was character deaths, branching storylines, or even different endings, Until Dawn the movie will need to select the best aspects of the game&#39;s myriad of choices. On the flip side, the movie could simply create its own narrative that uses the basic framework of the game.
