## Literature Review
Big Ed Brown could try his best to transform his bad image, but his controversial past would never get him praise from 90 Day Fiancé viewers.




Big Ed Brown from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise has ruined his image with his actions. The 58-year-old man debuted on the reality TV series in 2020, where he surprised viewers with his unusual love story and strange lifestyle choices. He became part of various viral moments on the show, from his cringeworthy romance with Rose Vega to the segment where he applied mayonnaise to his hair. Ed’s bizarre bathing scene at Rose’s home is still one of the most-watched moments in the history of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise, garnering over 11 million views on YouTube.




Ed treated Rose poorly, which resulted in their split. The Philippine native got so angry that she went off on Ed and dumped him. Soon after, the San Diego native joined 90 Day: The Single Life, where he began dating Liz Woods. His second relationship also didn’t go well, leading to over 11 breakups in the span of a few months. Most recently, Ed and Liz entered 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 to give their relationship a final chance. Somehow, they made the most progress and continued their relationship.

 Big Ed Goes After Much Younger Women 
         

On the surface, Ed’s journey on the 90 Day Fiancé franchise seems usual. However, the devil is in the details. Ed’s actions and behavior make him one of the most controversial castmates in the franchise. Over the years, it has been noticed that the former photographer has a repulsive ideology regarding dating. He’s known for only craving intimacy with youthful women and pursuing party girls. Ed, who’s 58, previously explained that he likes to “capture what I missed out on” by dating women decades younger than him. However, there is some suggestion that it’s wrong of him to desire women so much younger.






 Big Ed Humiliated Rose Vega 
         

Ed tarnished his image the moment he appeared in the series. His behavior toward his former girlfriend, Rose, was horrible and proved he was a monster. The reality star lured the 20-something-year-old into his trap with empty promises. He made her feel like he was serious about being her partner and a possible father to her son but then humiliated her with his demands. Ed asked Rose for an STD test and then doubled down by calling her unattractive. He asked her to shave her legs during their first meeting, showing that his intentions were purely physical.

Ed disrespected Rose in various ways. He gave her a bikini so she could be eye candy for him but then gifted her a toothbrush because he felt her breath wasn&#39;t “pretty.” From his reaction to Rose’s old house to his lack of concern for her emotions, Ed made it clear that he could care less about her or her struggles. If he had shown some decency, he could’ve won fans over. However, he continued being a terrible human by making fun of Rose even after their breakup.






 Big Ed Is A Narcissist 
         

It seems that Ed only cares about himself in his relationships. He mistreated his current partner, Liz, numerous times in front of the cameras. The couple split nearly a dozen times before they eventually made it work, even reportedly getting married earlier this year. In 2021, Liz took to social media to take a shot at Ed, implying that he’s a narcissist. Ed has proved himself to be self-centered by asking his partners to do unreasonable things for him. He told Rose to shave and asked Liz to lose weight, not realizing the hypocrisy.

 Big Ed Verbally Abused Liz Woods 

 




Ed is a verbal abuser, and his behavior toward Liz shows that. He picked many fights with his fiancée on-screen that were outlandish. In 2022, Ed claimed that Liz was a lesbian because she seemed close to one of her female friends. He turned the whole situation into a big argument on the occasion of their engagement party. Ed claimed Liz was fat, stated that she was a liar, and also told her that she makes a “fool out of herself” when she’s drunk.

Ed has been mean to Liz off-screen as well. In 2021, a call recording surfaced online where Ed verbally abused his girlfriend for dropping a co-worker at home. He said (via 90daycouple), “I don’t give a f**k Liz, you’re f**ked up…F**k you dude, you’re f****d up.” Liz heartbreakingly told Ed not to speak to her like that, but he amped it up further. He said, “Liz, you’re f**king stupid,” and claimed that she wasn’t well in the head for asking him if she could drop the co-worker drama.






 Big Ed Never Responded To Assault Allegations 
          

Ed has destroyed his social media image by being part of off-screen scandals. From selling fart jars to delving into controversial NFTs, he has left no stone unturned in angering fans. He has purposely made people mad at him by acting insensitive online. In 2020, Ed was allegedly involved in a big sexual harassment scandal when a TikToker accused him of assaulting her. She said that Ed put her in an armlock and pushed her down. She implied that Ed was a predator, but he didn’t respond to the allegations.

Sometime later, more unverified details about Ed’s alleged sexual assault and misconduct surfaced online. The accuser talked to Daily Soap Dish and alleged that Ed had abused her verbally and over texts. She said, “I ended up in the hospital from an incident that happened with him,” adding that she had gone through a lot of health issues afterward. The woman alleged the incident had happened to her four years ago, at the time the assault had surfaced. However, she couldn’t heal herself from it. So far, Ed&#39;s denial to address the allegations further makes him look guilty.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
