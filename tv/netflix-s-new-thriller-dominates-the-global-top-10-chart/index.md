## Literature Review
A new mystery thriller dominates Netflix&#39;s Global Top 10 in its first week, beating out other, more high-profile dramas for the No. 1 spot.




A new thriller is dominating the Netflix Top 10 in its first week. After the well-received adaptation of Harlan Coben&#39;s Shelter for Prime Video late last year, the author debuted Fool Me Once for Netflix to kick off 2024. In its first week, the twisty eight-episode thriller has already impressed subscribers.




Netflix has shared its Global Top 10, revealing that Fool Me Once was the most-watched show for the week of January 1 to January 7. Since its arrival on the first day of the new year, the mystery thriller garnered 37,100,000 views and was watched for 238,200,000 hours. It beat out other Netflix Originals globally, such as The Brothers Sun and My Life with the Walter Boys.



A view, per Netflix, is calculated as the total hours viewed divided by the total runtime.





 What To Know About Fool Me Once 
          

The story of Fool Me Once centers on Maya (Michelle Keegan), who is doing her best to process the brutal murder of her husband Joe (Richard Armitage). However, when Maya installs a nanny cam, she’s shocked to discover something that seems almost impossible to believe. Her husband is very much alive and well. A detective leads the investigation, but he has secrets of his own.




Along with Keegan and Armitage, who are known respectively for their roles in Coronation Street and Hannibal, the Fool Me Once cast also includes Adeel Akhtar, Emmett J. Scanlan, Dino Fetscher, and Absolutely Fabulous star Joanna Lumley. Behind the camera, the thriller was created by Danny Brocklehurst, while David Moore and Nimer Rashed directed the episodes.

Fool Me Once is not the first collaboration between Coben, who executive produces the show, and Netflix. Other television adaptations of Coben’s novels include The Stranger, Safe, and Stay  . All three can be found on Netflix and could likely get a bit of a boost from the buzzy thriller that&#39;s already garnered headlines.
