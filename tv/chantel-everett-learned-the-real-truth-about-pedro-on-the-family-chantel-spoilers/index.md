## Literature Review
Chantel Everett once ignored the advice of Obed, but she is now accepting the nasty truth about her ex, Pedro Jimeno, on The Family Chantel season 5.




The Family Chantel season 5 finally spilled some juicy secrets about Pedro Jimeno as Chantel Everett turned to their once mutual friend, Obed Corporan, to confirm that her ex had deceived her in a shocking way. Longtime fans of the hit reality TV show likely remember that Obed was a mutual friend of Chantel and Pedro and his family. Obed warned Chantel years ago on 90 Day Fiancé that Pedro was a user and that his family was looking for an American wife for him to scam. However, Chantel took until The Family Chantel season 5 to finally believe the shocking truth Obed told her.




Chantel and Pedro were once a 90 Day Fiancé franchise golden couple who genuinely seemed like they cared about each other. However, Pedro initially had a major beef with Chantel’s family. Chantel’s parents, Thomas and Karen Everett, accused Pedro at first of using Chantel to “harvest the American dollar.” Meanwhile, Obed tried to warn Chantel in the Dominican Republic that Pedro and his family were trying to use her. However, a persistent Chantel insisted on moving forward with the marriage. Now, seven years later, Chantel has reunited with Obed to spill secrets about Pedro.


 Does Chantel Think Pedro Used Her? 

 

Chantel Everett might be all smiles online, but she told Obed on The Family Chantel season 5 that Pedro “100% used me for a green card” and that she now believed everything Obed said about her ex. She shared that Pedro had been cheating on her the whole time and was likely fooling around with his real estate boss for months, as well as his sister Nicole Jimeno’s best friend Coraima Morla. Obed even told Chantel that one time when they were out in the DR, Pedro’s family insulted Chantel and called her ugly and mocked her. Due to this, Obed tried to warn Chantel off from Pedro, who didn’t defend her to his family and friends.

Whether Pedro cheated with Corinna has been an ongoing theme for years on the hit reality TV show. Obed confirmed to Chantel on The Family Chantel season 5 that Pedro had indeed cheated on Chantel with Coraima and lied about his past with Coraima. Obed shared that Pedro and Coraima had been hooking up since high school and dated on and off. Chantel called the information “the confirmation that I never wanted.” She shared that Pedro had tried to gaslight her for years when he denied having been intimate with Coraima, which led to Chantel being devastated when the truth was confirmed.

The Family Chantel season 5 has been difficult for Chantel, who has been forced to confront harsh truths about her former marriage as she struggles to get over Pedro. Chantel found out from Obed that Pedro hadn&#39;t likely written his proposal to her either, as he had poured heartfelt words to her when they became engaged that she now realized were likely scripted. Chantel ultimately found out that her marriage and relationship had been a lie from the start. The Family Chantel star was reduced to tears as she speculated that she was “nothing” to her ex during the dramatic episode.
