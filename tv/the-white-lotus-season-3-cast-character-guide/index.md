## Literature Review
The White Lotus season 3 is poised to be the acclaimed HBO series&#39; biggest season yet, with several big-name actors added to its ensemble cast.




The White Lotus season 3 cast will include six newcomers and at least one confirmed returning character from season 1. The acclaimed HBO series is set to begin production in Thailand in February 2024 with an anticipated release sometime in 2025. Specific filming locations include Bangkok, Koh Samui, and Phuket, which are all major tourist locations in Thailand. Departing from its season 1 location in Hawaii and season 2 location in Sicily, Italy, The White Lotus season 3 is poised to be the celebrated series&#39; biggest season yet.




As an anthology series, each season of The White Lotus features a mostly new cast with a few, or even just one, returning cast members. After the unexpected fate of Jennifer Coolidge&#39;s iconic Tanya McQuoid character at the end of season 2, there was uncertainty surrounding whether the fan-favorite character would be returning for season 3 in Thailand. Even if creator Mike White doesn&#39;t surprise fans with a Tanya resurrection, The White Lotus season 3 already has several outstanding new cast members to get excited about. According to Deadline, the hotel guests will include &#34;a patriarch, a female corporate executive, an actress, a couple of mothers, including a country club wife, a misfit and a yogi.&#34;
