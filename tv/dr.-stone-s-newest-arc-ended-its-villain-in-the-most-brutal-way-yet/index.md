# Dr. Stone s Newest Arc Ended Its Villain in the Most Brutal Way Yet


## SUMMARY 


 

                        Senku defeats Ibara in a brutal battle over the Medusa artifact in the Dr. Stone: New World finale, turning him to stone as the villain did to others on the island.
            

                        Despite being petrified, Ibara may still be conscious due to his intelligence and cunning, making his fate quite cruel.
            

                        Ibara&#39;s future looks bleak as his crimes and dangerous nature make it unlikely for him to be revived anytime soon, potentially remaining trapped for hundreds or thousands of years.
