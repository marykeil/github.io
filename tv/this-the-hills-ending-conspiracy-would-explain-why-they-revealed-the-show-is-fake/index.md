## Literature Review
The Hills may have ended in 2010, but left many fans floored to find out the show wasn&#39;t real. Stars Kristin, Heidi, and Spencer unpack the ending.




The Hills may not have included Kristin Cavallari for the entirety of the series, but having been a major part of the end of the series, she has some major feelings about a fan theory surrounding the series. Kristin, who joined Heidi Pratt and Spencer Pratt on the MTV reality series after Lauren Conrad’s departure, has revisited the reality TV space post Laguna Beach and The Hills. First, with her own series Very Cavallari, then on her successful podcast Back To The Beach with ex-boyfriend and co-star from Laguna Beach Stephen Colletti. Kristin has remained a presence in the entertainment industry post-reality TV, always staying authentic and honest.




While The Hills was originally meant to revolve around Lauren, Heidi, and their friendship as they moved to Los Angeles as young twenty-somethings, the series pivoted when Heidi and Spencer’s relationship became a threat to her friendship with Lauren. The relationships that played on the MTV reality series were, at times, over-dramatic and fabricated for the cameras, but they kept the audience entertained throughout the series six-season run. After Lauren left the show during The Hills season 5, Kristin took over as the lead for the final seasons of the series, stirring up drama of her own.

 Spencer Pratt Believes The Hills Production Wanted To Avoid A Lawsuit 

 




In an episode of Kristin’s podcast, Let’s Be Honest, Spencer and Heidi joined in the conversation to discuss their time on The Hills. While talking about the reality behind reality TV, Spencer explained, “If you believe what you hear on reality TV, you believe in Santa Claus.” He shared his own conspiracy theory about the ending of The Hills, where the cameras pulled back from a shot of Brody Jenner watching Kristin drive away from him to reveal they were on a studio lot the entire time.

“Obviously, they lied to everybody,” Spencer shared, “I think ‘cause…somebody was going to sue, and to get out of the lawsuit they shot that alternate ending that showed like, ‘no, this was fake’ with Brody. I think that was to protect – that’s my conspiracy theory – I think it was to make it so you could never sue…because they said it was all fake.” Spencer’s conspiracy, which Kristin felt made sense, was that the ending of The Hills was purposefully made for viewers to understand that the majority of the show had been staged in order to avoid any legal issues they could be facing.






 Was The Hills Actually Fake? 
          

While there were aspects to The Hills that were real and based in reality, the majority of the series has been proven to be scripted, or at the very least fabricated by producers. Story points were crafted for the cast members, pushing them into dramatic situations where they’d fight and talk about one another behind their backs. For Lauren, Spencer, Heidi, and the rest of the cast, the drama did ultimately impact their real lives, but the majority of the problems were crafted up by the producers who created the show and handled the narrative.

With The Hills and The Hills: New Beginnings both having ended, the shows are both primary examples of the way that reality TV can function without being tremendously real. Kristin, who appeared on Laguna Beach long before she was a part of The Hills, helped to set the tone for a more scripted space on reality TV along with Spencer and Heidi, who pushed the limits of what could be done with the genre. Though they may not be on The Hills anymore, the stars have their own thoughts and feelings surrounding the state of reality TV and how it came to be what it is now.
