  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Screen Rant interviews Kristian Ventura about his theories for School Spirits season 2 and the cast&rsquo;s eagerness to return to the set.</p>
<p>Warning: SPOILERS for the season 1 finale of School Spirits.School Spirits was renewed for a second season shortly after the finale dropped on Paramount+. The supernatural mystery is yet to resume filming, but a late 2024 premiere remains possible. While viewers spent the entire season under the impression that Maddie was murdered, Episode 8 reveals that her body has been possessed by Janet, who was thought to have crossed over to the other side.</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura plays Simon Elroy, Maddie&rsquo;s best friend and the only living person able to communicate with her in the afterlife. Ventura has worked on several projects and is most well-known for films such as Gray Matter and Grimcutty. The rest of the main cast includes Peyton List (Cobra Kai), Spencer MacPherson, Kiara Pichardo, Rainbow Wedell, Sarah Yarkin, Nick Pugliese, and Milo Manheim.</p>

<p>Screen Rant interviewed Kristian Ventura about the finale&rsquo;s major twist, his theories for season 2, and the cast&rsquo;s eagerness to return to set.</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura Talks School Spirits Season 1</p>
<p>Screen Rant: Congratulations on season 2! I can&rsquo;t imagine you not getting renewed after that cliffhanger.</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: It&rsquo;s so rare for people to come back and return after a TV show. There are more pilots than season 2&rsquo;s. We always text each other saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss you in Vancouver. Our friendship is going to get so much deeper.&rdquo; We all really miss each other. It&rsquo;ll be good to be back.</p>
<p>So you haven&rsquo;t started filming the new season?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: We have not. We will likely start in a few months. Maybe June.</p>
<p>Do you have any scripts, or are you just as in the dark as the rest of us?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I&rsquo;m in the dark. What I know about Simon, at least, is very little, except that in the next season, he thinks he&rsquo;s insane. He&rsquo;s going to have to mute that voice inside his head that&rsquo;s Maddie&rsquo;s ghost and say to himself that she isn&rsquo;t real. That&rsquo;s what I know, but what I hope for is a lot of Janet. I really want to know more about Janet and Mr. Martin—the whole ghost world, the sciences of it, and what the parameters are of the ghosts&rsquo; existence. I don&rsquo;t exactly hate Janet. I kind of want to understand a little bit more about when she was alive and who she is.</p>
<p>Were any of you close to guessing the Janet twist or did it come as a complete shock?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: Everyone flipped out. We were so inaccurate with our guesses. I thought it was Nicole. When I received the pilot it originally said, in Nicole&rsquo;s first scene, &ldquo;Nicole walks up to Simon and Mattie. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re having a party?&rsquo;&rdquo; But then right before we shot, the writers had this revision where it said, &ldquo;Nicole walks in a little tired. &lsquo;Are we throwing a party?&rsquo;&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;Why did they add this &rsquo;tired&rsquo; note? Killer! Why did they add that detail?&rdquo; We know later why she was tired, but everyone thought it was someone else. No one could guess Janet.</p>
<p>What were your thoughts on Mr. Martin? Were you ever suspicious of him?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I am a little bit distrustful of selfless characters. You have this adult in a high school who&rsquo;s basically helping children with their trauma and improve their internal lives. I always thought, &ldquo;Why? Are people that good?&rdquo; You could argue that Simon is selfish in himself, because, yes, he&rsquo;s helping Maddie, but he does it because he loves her and wants to be around her for as long as he can. What does Mr. Martin get out of it? I don&rsquo;t know. I wanted to know his intentions.</p>
<p>Simon now thinks he&rsquo;s been hallucinating Maddie. How was filming that final scene, given all the emotions he&rsquo;s experiencing?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I think what helped was having filmed with Peyton for three months and that being our last week together. You kind of, in a way, involuntarily, care about and love the person. Peyton and I aren&rsquo;t going to Disneyland every Saturday and building some kind of bond. What we do is we hit our marks, and we look at each other, and we decide, &ldquo;You want to go there?&rdquo; and then she goes, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo; And we go there, and then you film the last scene. There&rsquo;s this trust that cannot really be shattered by anything because you &ldquo;went there,&rdquo; and you keep going there. It&rsquo;s a love that builds that is exclusive, I think, to actors.</p>
<p>What do you think his reaction will be when he finds out that Maddie isn&rsquo;t dead?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I don&rsquo;t know! Poor Simon! I think that he&rsquo;s going to race to find out how she can be alive. The whole irony of him is that, as he helps her throughout the season, the less time he has with her because she would crossover. I think he&rsquo;s going to try to figure out how to transfer the bodies, so he can hug her again.</p>
<p>Without Maddie there to be the glue, what are your thoughts on Simon and Nicole&rsquo;s relationship?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I feel like friends need to argue. I was told by someone that it&rsquo;s the kind of friends that will slip away, inevitably, that don&rsquo;t really care for each other, that never voice their disputes. There&rsquo;s something about arguments that isn&rsquo;t actually toxic, but builds a connection. There was so much distrust between Simon and Nicole throughout the season because of the bootprint and the money that they needed to argue and they did.
I think their bond is going to be incredibly strong because the greatest friendships that I&rsquo;ve had, at least in my limited life, were ones that had to build over big problems. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is fake friends don&rsquo;t argue. The real ones stick through it and there&rsquo;s a loyalty. The bigger the problems, the bigger the friendship, because human beings are really hard to get along with. You might think they killed your best friend, in this case. It&rsquo;s like living together. It&rsquo;s hard. I can imagine that it&rsquo;s going to be exponentially deeper, and now that he knows that she isn&rsquo;t some psychotic murderer, she might just be his second best friend.</p>
<p>I heard that you had some fun behind-the-scenes stories. What was the craziest moment on set during season 1?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: All my crazy stuff are my auditions. The audition for School Spirits was so long and hard. When we were filming in Vancouver, the embarrassment would come from acting in front of the background actors because Peyton isn&rsquo;t there, and it looks like I&rsquo;m an idiot. I&rsquo;m just trying things, and you look so awful. There&rsquo;s that. Anytime a new director would come into a new episode and see me trying things, they didn&rsquo;t really expect how I work, because I just want to offer them so many different variations of what can be delivered.
When I had looked at Nicole in the computer lab, and I reached out my leg like a horse and I kicked it and I held her, our director, Hannah Macpherson goes, &ldquo;[Whispering] Hey, come here. The kick thing? Don&rsquo;t do that. Don&rsquo;t do the kick.&rdquo; She was a bit taken aback. The audition for School Spirits started a little cliché. When I first got the email from my manager, I actually got a feeling. Everyone talks about feelings, but every time I get an audition, I go, &ldquo;Confirming receipt. Thanks, John,&rdquo; my manager, but this one I go, &ldquo;Hm. There&rsquo;s something here.&rdquo; I read the pilot that Nate and Megan wrote, and then I read the audition sides that they gave, and they were asking for lighthearted scenes. I guess they wanted to gauge how good of a friend he is.
But what I ended up doing was was sending them the scene where he sits down with Ms. Fields and says how much he misses his soulmate. You can&rsquo;t gauge a friendship by the high, jolly times when things are going well. You want to see how good he is as a friend? Why don&rsquo;t we go into the darkness of their relationship when he doesn&rsquo;t have her? It was kind of a risk because I didn&rsquo;t want to overstep my role as the auditioner, but during the three rounds of auditioning after that, they made that scene the official audition sides. Everyone was now doing the Ms. Field scenes, so I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ve got to do something more for the next round.&rdquo;
Simon&rsquo;s packet officially became this darker version of the character. In order to secure comfort, and going into the third and fourth rounds before flying over to New York and meeting Peyton, I wanted to do all the scenes in real time in the locations where they take place in the script. For example, if Maddie and Simon have a scene in the auto shop, I would go over and walk down to UCLA to the neurochemistry biosciences building, and go down to the basement and rehearse all the scenes there by myself. If he had a scene where he was speaking to her on his earphones, and it&rsquo;s under a tree outside, I would go in front of Powell Library and rest against a tree trunk and deliver the lines there.
It was summer, so there weren&rsquo;t a lot of people to think that I was insane. There were families with their kids, but I didn&rsquo;t care. I wanted it so bad. So that&rsquo;s what I was doing. I think it&rsquo;s important because you could have any kind of dialogue in a café or in the middle of space, but they have to be different because of the environmental factors of the scene. That&rsquo;s what I was going for with that callback—these environmental impulses that I received from doing it on the location.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked about this before, but you&rsquo;ve mentioned that you feel Maddie and Simon have a special love for one another. Do you think there could be more than friendship in store for them?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I think what it is right now is a person with the most brilliant mind analyzing their love. It&rsquo;s a little in this grey zone. My answer is more theoretical and more intuitive, and it is that we all want to marry our best friend. I just want to make sure I&rsquo;m not hoping for it, and I&rsquo;m just trying to understand their own love, but I think it&rsquo;s a twin flame. When you have a person who is there for you when the rest of the world isn&rsquo;t, the light at the end of the tunnel your whole life, you cannot help but want to choose them every day afterward. &ldquo;I want you forever, all the time. Every day, every morning, every lunch. I love you.&rdquo;
What is that love? I don&rsquo;t know. I think it&rsquo;s exclusive to those people who grew up together. It&rsquo;s definitely not, &ldquo;Oh, you suddenly got attractive senior year. You&rsquo;re kind of hot. Want to go to prom?&rdquo; Thank God it&rsquo;s not that kind of show. It&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Oh my God, you&rsquo;re dead, and now I can&rsquo;t live, and if there&rsquo;s ever a chance that you could live again, I&rsquo;m not going to live without you.&rdquo; Whatever that is. I think that that&rsquo;s what I want, personally. If there was a ghost world it make things so much more dramatic and better. I don&rsquo;t know. What is that? I&rsquo;m not really sure.</p>
<p>Are there any particular storylines that you would like to see for Simon in season 2?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I would love for his relationship with Xavier to develop only because he&rsquo;s the soldier in arms that could go into battle with Simon. You just feel more comfortable sometimes as a teenager being with another teenage boy and solving things together. Of course, he did cheat on Maddie, his best friend, so he&rsquo;ll always have a little bit of shade, but I do want them to go on more adventures. I think they make a good duo.</p>
<p>Do you have any other theories about where the show might go from here?</p>
<p>Kristian Ventura: I want to say that Simon will be able to shut down the ghost of Maddie and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m insane. You&rsquo;re not here. I need to find you. You&rsquo;re alive. I saw a photo of you. You&rsquo;re not real,&rdquo; but as much as I think that he will have that courage, there&rsquo;s something a little bit stronger than someone&rsquo;s sanity. I think it&rsquo;s a need for love. My theory is that he will, in his own head, self-sabotage himself and be weak and believe that she&rsquo;s real anyway. I think that he will surrender and fall.
Even though he can&rsquo;t touch her, the image of Maddie is so strong that I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll make it two episodes. I think he&rsquo;s just going to be like, &ldquo;I want your ghost. I want to be insane.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t we do that to our exes or whatever? We just want a part of them. We want to look at old photos. We want to hear their voice and play their audio messages. I think he&rsquo;s just going to have to surrender to his own weakness that we&rsquo;re all prone to because no one is Superman.</p>
