# Every Game Of Thrones Actor In Benioff &amp; Weiss  3 Body Problem


## SUMMARY 


 Game of Thrones creators Benioff and Weiss are bringing their talents to Netflix&#39;s 3 Body Problem, which features several GoT actors in its cast. 
 The series, based on Liu Cixin&#39;s trilogy, explores the impact of decisions in 1960s China on modern-day scientists facing an otherworldly threat. 
 The show&#39;s trailer and teasers provide little information, leaving fans cautiously optimistic about how Benioff and Weiss will adapt the sci-fi/fantasy/drama genre.

## Literature Review
Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss&#39; new show, 3 Body Problem, is coming, and the series is set to reunite several GOT stars.




Written and produced by Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Netflix&#39;s upcoming series, 3 Body Problem, also features several Game of Thrones actors in its cast. Based on the Remembrance of Earth&#39;s Past trilogy by Liu Cixin, the series will explore how decisions in 1960s China affect scientists in the modern day and connect to a fight between humanity and an otherworldly threat. A trailer and a couple of teasers have been released for the show, but Netflix and the show&#39;s cast have been careful to reveal little about the show.
After their venture into fantasy with GoT, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how Benioff and Weiss interpret and adapt Cixin&#39;s novels into a sci-fi/fantasy/drama TV series. The three GoT actors are set to portray seemingly prominent characters in 3 Body Problem. Considering this reunion between GoT creators and actors, perhaps the series will have a similar feel that will make GoT fans cautiously optimistic about 3 Body Problem, or maybe this show will be an entirely new project for the creators, actors, and audience members alike.
            
 
 Netflix&#39;s 3 Body Problem: Release Date, Cast, Story, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know 
What is Netflix&#39;s The Three-Body Problem, and when will it release? Here&#39;s everything we know about David Benioff and D.B. Weiss&#39; upcoming TV series.




3 Body Problem is set to premiere on Netflix on March 21, 2024. 










 








 3  John Bradley 
He&#39;ll portray Jack Rooney in 3 Body Problem.


 







Where You Know John Bradley From: Bradley is known most recently for his roles as Samwell Tarly in Game of Thrones, Colin in Marry Me, K.C. Houseman in Moonfall, and Ricky Rollins in American Satan. He also portrayed Gordon Ramsay, Quint, and Eric in Robot Chicken season 10, episode 6, and he provided the voice for apprentice Marten Webb in the World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth video game. Bradley also appeared in the first two episodes of Shameless season 10.
Who John Bradley Played In Game of Thrones: Bradley&#39;s first major television role was as Tarly in GoT. He was a member of the Night&#39;s Watch and one of Jon Snow&#39;s best friends. He later joined the Citadel and became a maester, which allowed him to discover many important truths that shaped the conclusion of the show, such as the key to killing the white walkers and hints about Snow&#39;s true parentage. Tarly was one of the few GoT characters whose story had a happy ending. He and Gilly fell in love, and he became the Grand Maester to King Bran Stark.
Who John Bradley Plays In 3 Body Problem: He&#39;s set to star as Jack Rooney, an original character created for the show. Not much about Rooney is revealed in the 3 Body Problem trailer or teaser, but an exclusive clip shows him entering the &#34;Three Body&#34; VR game and being stunned by how lifelike it is before he&#39;s told he wasn&#39;t &#34;invited&#34; and is violently attacked. How far Rooney will ultimately make it in the game and what kind of impact he will have on the story of 3 Body Problem has yet to be seen.





 2  Liam Cunningham 
He&#39;s set to play the mysterious and potentially dangerous Thomas Wade.
        

Where You Know Liam Cunningham From: Cunnigham is best known for his roles as Davos Seaworth in Game of Thrones, Solon in Clash of the Titans, Father Dominic Moran in Hunger, and Dan in The Wind the Shakes the Barley. He played Captain Elliot in The Last Voyage of the Demeter and Jepson Belgrave in Impact Winter. The veteran actor also provided his voice as Balthromar in Rick and Morty and The Pupa in Solar Opposites.
Who Liam Cunningham Played In Game of Thrones: Cunningham&#39;s Seaworth was a smuggler-turned-nobleman who was a loyal bannerman to Stannis Baratheon in Game of Thrones. As punishment for his past thievery, Baratheon cut the fingertips off of Seaworth&#39;s left hand, but he stood beside Baratheon in his quest for the Iron Throne. After Stannis&#39; death, Seaworth allied himself with Snow. He was one of the few main characters who survived by the end of the series and who got a pretty happy ending. Like Tarly, he also ended up becoming a member of King Bran&#39;s Small Council as the Master of Ships.
Who Liam Cunningham Plays In 3 Body Problem: He&#39;ll play Thomas Wade, a character who first appears in the final &#34;Remembrance of Earth&#39;s Past&#34; novel, Death&#39;s End. The 3 Body Problem trailer and teaser reveal little about Wade, except for showing him standing in front of a large group of people, seemingly in a position of power. Cunningham has remained similarly tight-lipped about his character, except for his revelation that Wade doesn&#39;t have a strong moral compass and that he&#39;s involved in quantum entanglement, theoretical physics, and the intelligence community (via Variety). Viewers will have to wait and see just what Wade is up to and what his intentions are.
            
 
 Are The 3 Body Problem Books Finished? How Worried You Should Be About Game Of Thrones Creators&#39; New Show 
Soon-to-be viewers are wondering if the 3 Body Problem books are finished, especially given the Game of Thrones creators&#39; mixed track record...









 1  Jonathan Pryce 
He&#39;ll star as Mike Evans in 3 Body Problem.
        

Where You Know Jonathan Pryce From: Pryce portrayed Joe Castleman in The Wife, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio and Pope Francis in The Two Popes, Elliot Carver in Tomorrow Never Dies, and James Lingk in Glengarry Glen Ross. He also played David Cartwright in Slow Horses and Prince Phillip in The Crown. In Game of Thrones, Pryce would be known for his portrayal of the High Sparrow.
Who Jonathan Pryce Played In Game of Thrones: The High Sparrow was a prominent character throughout Game of Thrones seasons 5 and 6. He was the leader of the Faith of the Seven, a major religion in Westeros, who served as a voice for the common people in opposition to the nobility. His power only increased after Cersei Lannister funded the Faith Militant, a military organization within the Faith of the Seven. Pryce&#39;s character used this power to seize a lot of control over the nobility within King&#39;s Landing, converting some of them and imprisoning others. He was killed when Lannister blew up the Great Sept of Baelor.
Who Jonathan Pryce Plays In 3 Body Problem: Pryce will portray Mike Evans, a character described as &#34;a passionate environmentalist turned billionaire oil tycoon&#34; (via Tudum by Netflix). Like Wade, Evans is also a character from the novels the 3 Body Problem series is based on. Being a wealthy man with strong views, Evans will likely play a crucial role in the conflict to come in the series. Audiences will need to wait until the series premieres to discover what decisions Evans will make and whether he&#39;s a friend or foe.
