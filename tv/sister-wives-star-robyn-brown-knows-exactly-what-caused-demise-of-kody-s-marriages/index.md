The COVID-19 pandemic also negatively impacted the marriages within the Brown family, causing tension and disagreements, leading to the breakdown of unity.

## Literature Review
Sister Wives’ Robyn Brown explains two major reasons behind Kody Brown’s split from his first three wives Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown.




Robyn Brown from Sister Wives claimed the events after Las Vegas caused Kody Brown’s three divorces. Robyn married the polygamous man in 2010. At the time, Kody had a decent relationship with his first three wives--Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown--and wanted to expand his family. Unfortunately, the family dynamic changed when Robyn became the fourth wife. Robyn became Kody’s priority, which pushed the other sister wives to feel left out and alone. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Meri, Janelle, and Christine became visibly tired of polygamy. They divorced Kody over the course of the last three years.




Recently, Robyn opened up about what she thinks caused Kody to lose his three wives. She said (via People), “I think it started with when we were in Las Vegas,” implying that Meri, Janelle and Christine were part of the problem. The now-monogamous woman claimed that Kody’s former wives started looking after their adult kids “instead of focusing on their relationship with Kody.” She stated that the Brown family matriarchs stopped caring about their marriages and commitments as sister wives. Robyn added that things didn’t remain the same once they got “separated geographically.”

During the interview, Robyn admitted that the COVID-19 pandemic was also part of the problem. She claimed it was a “perfect storm” that destroyed the Brown family from the inside. The mom of five added, “We weren’t as united, and everybody [was] disagreeing.” Robyn alleged that the pandemic lockdown brought a lot of tension into the household, which led to fights. She stated that things got to a point where everyone became too independent to care about others. She added, “I’ve heard them all talk about, ‘well, I don’t know if I want this anymore.’”





 

Robyn’s comments about the shift in Kody, Christine, Meri, and Janelle’s relationship dynamic make sense. The polygamous family lived nearly 30 years with each other and evolved over time. Kody found love in Robyn, who became his ideal wife compared to his other three partners. At the same time, Meri, Janelle, and Christine became more independent and realized things they preferred more than their marriages. Their breakups were inevitable due to their drastically changed personalities. Neither of them was the same person from when they tied the knot in the early &#39;90s.

Still, it seems Robyn wasn’t fully honest in the interview. She blamed everyone else but herself for Kody’s three divorces. Over the years, Robyn has caused division in the Brown family. She manipulated Kody with her tears and made herself look like the victim. The Sister Wives cast member doesn’t realize how Kody and her chemistry made Meri, Christine, and Janelle feel. She never cared about the others or tried to ease their jealousy. If Robyn wanted, she could’ve helped save the plural marriages. However, her lack of action makes it seem like her goal was always to embrace monogamy.
