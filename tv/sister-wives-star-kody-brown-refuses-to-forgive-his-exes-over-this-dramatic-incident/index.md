# Sister Wives Star Kody Brown Refuses To Forgive His Exes Over This Dramatic Incident


## SUMMARY 



  Kody&#39;s three other wives were jealous of Robyn and felt neglected when he paid extra attention to her.   Kody&#39;s decision to pick Robyn&#39;s wedding dress without involving his other wives was seen as disrespectful and insensitive.   The jealousy and favoritism between the wives ultimately led to the dissolution of Kody&#39;s marriages with Christine, Meri, and Janelle.

## Literature Review
Kody Brown from Sister Wives may be living a happy life with Robyn Brown, but he still holds a grudge against his exes because of one incident.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown still isn’t over Christine, Meri, and Janelle Brown’s jealous behavior toward Robyn Brown in season 1. The polygamous man has faced many challenges in his four relationships over the last ten years. However, the jealousy between his four wives has been his biggest issue yet. Since Kody married his fourth partner, Robyn, other Sister Wives have been jealous of her. While Christine was envious of Robyn because Kody paid extra attention to her, Janelle and Meri didn’t like that he stopped visiting them as often. Between 2021 and 2023, the three ladies walked away from the plural marriage and divorced Kody.




People recently posted an exclusive preview of Sister Wives Look Back: How It Started special. The clip showed all main cast members reacting to an incident from a decade ago, where Kody admitted that he picked Robyn’s wedding dress. In the old episode, the Brown family patriarch seemed happy about shopping with Robyn, while Meri, Janelle, and Christine were jealous that he didn’t do the same for them. The preview clip then cut to present-day reactions, where Kody admitted he hadn’t forgiven his now-ex-wives. He said, “that’s a really hard one, that’s a place like, I don’t even think I’ve forgiven.”

 Kody Brown’s Favoritism Toward Robyn In Undeniable 
          

The preview then showcased the Sister Wives’ reaction to the old incident as they shared their present-day views. Christine revealed, “that was the day when I realized, um, He is way more in love with Robyn than he was with me when we go married.” The mom of six said it was a hard day for her seeing Kody’s favoritism to Robyn. The clip then showed Janelle’s reaction, who claimed that it was a “d**k move” for Kody to pick his fourth wife’s dress when he didn’t do the same for her, Christine and Meri. She said, “maybe that was the beginning of some sort of favoritism.”




Christine and Janelle are right to think that Kody wasn’t respectful to them when he aided Robyn in picking up her wedding dress. They had been with him for nearly two decades before he married his fourth wife. Therefore, they deserved to be included or intimated in advance. The way Kody dropped the bombshell about the wedding dress was uncalled for and insensitive. He should’ve cared for his other wives and their feelings instead of turning the whole revelation into a moment for reality TV. He could’ve acted more maturely.

Still, there was nothing wrong with Kody and Robyn picking a wedding dress for their special day. They had all the right to choose the perfect look for their wedding and make it memorable. The only thing that wasn’t right was Kody’s actions. Robyn isn’t to blame for not including Christine, Meri, and Janelle because she hadn’t become a part of their family then. However, Kody deserves criticism for not including his other three wives or telling them about his decision to pick Robyn’s dress. If the polygamous man had been a bit more considerate about things instead of brewing jealousy between the Sister Wives, he’d still be married to his first three wives.






Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.
