## Literature Review
From cryptic social posts to subtle gestures, Teen Mom star Kailyn Lowry might be hinting at a future with long-term boyfriend Elijah Scott.




Teen Mom alum Kailyn Lowry, who&#39;s been in a relationship with Elijah Scott since April 2022, dropped hints suggesting a potential walk down the aisle. Following a shaky split from ex-Chris Lopez, Elijah entered the scene as a pivotal figure. Historically guarded about personal affairs, Kailyn has offered glimpses into her bond with Elijah, a departure from her usual privacy. While details remain scarce, a look into their dynamic, as well as the news Kailyn is pregnant with twins, has stirred speculation about a possible marriage or engagement. Kailyn&#39;s followers also seem excited about this evolution of her vulnerability, which they aren&#39;t used to witnessing.




Kailyn navigated her relationships cautiously during her tenure with Teen Mom. Initially rising to fame through her pregnancy with Jo Rivera, followed by her union with Javi Marroquin, Kailyn deliberately shielded her romance with Lopez from the camera lens. Despite briefly discussing her relationship with Elijah on her Barely Famous podcast in June 2022, she maintained a tight lid on intimate details. Kailyn, however, surprised followers by revealing the birth of her fifth child in late 2022 and subsequent twin pregnancy. Kailyn&#39;s romance and parenthood journey with Elijah has unveiled a new, serene side to her, leaving followers wondering if (and how soon) an engagement is in the cards.


 Elijah Wants Marriage But Kailyn&#39;s Hesitant 
          

In November 2023, Kailyn revealed to People that she&#39;s not in a &#34;rush&#34; to walk down the aisle a second time. Kailyn acknowledged Elijah&#39;s eagerness for engagement but expressed hesitance due to her previous marital missteps. &#34;He&#39;s been pushing for it, but I&#39;ve already kind of done marriage once, and I f---ed it up royally. So I&#39;m a little hesitant.&#34; Having leaped into parenthood, she emphasized a desire to savor milestones at a steady pace. Confident in their bond, she praised Elijah as a devoted family man, distinct from her past partners. &#34;I think we have time. If we&#39;re meant to be together, then we don&#39;t need to rush into it tomorrow.&#34;






 Kailyn Teased Engagement Rumors
