## Literature Review

Just after the Pauly Shore-starring Richard Simmons biopic The Court Jester is announced, Simmons denounces the film for not consulting him.




Richard Simmons voices his displeasure about his upcoming biopics, claiming that the production team did not consult him. The short film The Court Jester was recently announced, which will follow a segment of the life of famed fitness guru Simmons as he prepares for an appearance on the Ellen show. A feature-length biopic from Warner Bros. and the Wolper Organization has also been announced. In both films, Simmons will be played by infamous 1990s comedian Pauly Shore.




As per Variety, Simmons now disavows the biopic films since the team did not consult him in the process. In a statement released on Facebook, Simmons explained that he had “never given [his] permission for the movie.” He stated that he no longer has a publicist or manager and “just tr[ies] to live a quiet life.” Check out the full quote from Simmons below:


Hi Everybody! You may have heard they may be doing a movie about me with Pauly Shore. I have never given my permission for this movie. So don’t believe everything you read. I no longer have a manager, and I no longer have a publicist. I just try to live a quiet life and be peaceful. Thank you for all your love and support.


The Wolper Organization, who is co-producing the feature film on Simmons, responded to the fitness guru’s statement as well:


While we would love to have [Simmons] involved, we respect his desire to privacy and plan to produce a movie that honors him, celebrates him and tells a dramatic story.
We know he is deeply private and we would never want to invade that, however he is an amazing person that changed millions of peoples’ lives, and the effect he has had on the world needs to be recognized.






 Pauly Shore’s Richard Simmons Movies Explained 
          

Shore made a name for himself in the 1990s, where he performed standup comedy and featured in several films, including Encino Man and Bio-Dome. Even as Shore&#39;s film career has slowed down in the last two decades, some have long been wanting the comedian to come back to acting to play one particular role: Simmons. Many people have noted Shore’s physical likeness to Simmons as well as his ability to play such an effervescent and idiosyncratic character.



The Court Jester will play at Sundance on January 19 and 22 at 9pm MST.




Shore’s debut as Simmons is finally approaching, as he is set to star in the short film The Court Jester. Directed by Jake Lewis, the short film will premiere at Sundance first on January 19 and then play again on January 22. This will be the first time Shore has played Simmons after much pushing, but it will likely not be the last. Unrelated to The Court Jester itself, Warner Bros. and the Wolper Organization announced the development of a feature-length Simmons biopic, which will also star Shore.




                  10 Best Comedians Of All Time, According To Reddit   From Robin Williams to Richard Pryor, some major comedians don&#39;t get their due respect on Reddit threads. But these equally-talented comics soar.   

Unfortunately, it seems that Simmons did not give his blessing to either film. While he does not specifically call out The Court Jester in his post, it became clear that Simmons never approved of any film with Shore playing him, thus damning The Court Jester as well. Some may have gotten what they wanted with Shore finally playing Simmons, but that seems to have come at the expense of the subject of the movie.
