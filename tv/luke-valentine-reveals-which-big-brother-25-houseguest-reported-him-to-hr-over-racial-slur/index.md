# Luke Valentine Reveals Which Big Brother 25 Houseguest Reported Him To HR Over Racial Slur


## SUMMARY 



  Luke Valentine claims that another houseguest, Cory Wurtenberger, was responsible for his removal from Big Brother 25.   Luke seems to be avoiding taking responsibility for his actions and instead blames Cory for reporting him to HR.   Regardless of the circumstances, Luke&#39;s use of a racial slur was inappropriate and reflects negatively on his character.

## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s ejected houseguest Luke Valentine shares on Instagram Live that one of his fellow houseguests was the cause of his removal.




Big Brother season 25’s ejected houseguest Luke Valentine may have used a racial slur in the house, but he claims that another houseguest was the catalyst for his removal from the game. While Luke was ejected from the house for breaking the code of conduct, which is laid out in an elaborate, detailed fashion to the Big Brother 25 houseguests before the game begins, he doesn’t believe his removal was entirely due to his actions. For long-time viewers, it’s understood that breaking the code of conduct in such a transgressive way leads directly to expulsion from the game.




Luke explained that even though he did use a racial slur towards houseguest of color Jared Fields, he feels it was actually Big Brother 25 juror Cory Wurtenberger who caused him to be removed from the game. “Cory was the one who reported me to HR, Cory was the snitch,” Luke shared in videos shared by Twitter user @kpk12357. Rather than owning up to the fact that he used a racial slur and got himself removed from the game, Luke seems to believe that because Cory mentioned his use of the slur to production, they felt the need to take action.


 

It hasn&#39;t been confirmed if Cory did mention Luke’s breach of the code of conduct to production, but he was asked about it after the fact in the Diary Room. Luke says Jared, who also broke the Big Brother code of conduct, wasn’t punished because “he wasn’t caught breaking [rules]” and had no complaints against him.

While Luke seems to be moving on with his life, it’s clear that he still isn’t taking any accountability for his actions, despite admitting he was &#34;heartbroken&#34; over being removed. Unfortunately, blaming Cory rather than owning up to his behavior is in character for Luke, who has been trying to feign innocence. Luke does not seem to grasp that even if his transgression hadn’t been broadcast on the Big Brother 25 live feeds for all to see, the production team has access to footage of everything happening in the house at all times. Even if Cory hadn’t brought it up, the use of the word would’ve been caught on camera anyway.

While Luke’s removal from the game may have been due to a mix of factors, they all had to do with the fact that he chose to use demeaning, inappropriate, racially insensitive language. Regardless of the code of conduct, racial slurs are never appropriate and the fact that Luke felt comfortable enough to use the word at all makes his character crystal clear. Although he’s been given the opportunity to do better, Luke has chosen to minimize his behavior. Cory has spoken out against hate speech, sexism, and ageism throughout the season and had nothing to do with Luke’s self-destructive behavior.

With Big Brother 25 coming to a close, it&#39;ll be interesting to see what the houseguests&#39; lives outside the confines of the Big Brother house are. For those who have chosen to continue to follow Luke and engage with him throughout the season, he will likely try to capitalize on the finale despite being purposely left out. Luke’s fellow Big Brother 25 houseguests will likely continue to ignore his presence, as his time on the show was short and tinged with drama. Though Luke is convinced he didn’t get himself kicked off the show, the rest of the cast knows it was his fault.




The Big Brother season 25 finale airs Thursday, November 9 at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
