  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine featured a wide range of guest stars, including Pete Davidson, Adam Sandler, and John C. McGinley, who each brought their own comedic talents to the show.
The show was initially canceled by Fox but was picked up by NBC, allowing for three more seasons and the opportunity for more guest stars to make memorable appearances.
Some of the best episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine included guest stars who added a fresh dynamic to the show, showcasing the versatility of the main cast and contributing to the overall comedy.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine had a huge number of accomplished actors make guest appearances during its eight seasons, and some were better than others.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine had some big names as guest stars in the show during its eight-year run, with each role being tailored to the actors&rsquo; strengths. Despite already having a large, diverse cast, the show was always willing to bring in familiar faces to contribute to the comedy. While some of the guest stars had previous connections to the Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast, this wasn&rsquo;t always necessarily the case. A handful of the best visiting actors also returned for Brooklyn Nine-Nine&rsquo;s ending.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine ended after eight seasons, surviving a very brief spell of cancelation after season 5 in 2018. Fox&rsquo;s loss was NBC&rsquo;s gain, with the latter immediately picking up the show and producing three more seasons before it concluded in 2021. Following the renewal of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the guest actors continued to appear, and remained as consistent in quality as they did with the show&rsquo;s stint on Fox. Many of the best episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine included stars who weren&rsquo;t usually present in the show.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine Cast - Where Are They Now?
Since the show ended in 2021, the Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast has continued their careers, starring in everything from blockbusters to animated shows.</p>
<p>15  Pete Davidson
Davidson played an unruly youth who derailed Amy Santiago&rsquo;s presentation</p>
<p>As well as being a platform for established stars, Brooklyn Nine-Nine also served as a vehicle for at least one up-and-comer. During his brief appearance in season 1, episode 3, &ldquo;The Slump,&rdquo; Pete Davidson&rsquo;s Brooklyn Nine-Nine character starts a misguided debate about racism among his peers during a talk by Amy. The episode first aired in 2013, meaning Davidson&rsquo;s appearance on the sitcom predates his Saturday Night Live debut by a year.
Pete Davidson&rsquo;s character on Brooklyn Nine-Nine was called Steve.</p>
<p>14  Adam Sandler
He played himself and heckled Jake Peralta</p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s sting operation is almost ruined by Adam Sandler in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 1, episode 15, &ldquo;Operation: Broken Feather.&rdquo; Stepping into the shoes of a fictionalized and particularly abrasive version of himself, Sandler belittles Peralta&rsquo;s auctioneering skills as well as defending his own unexpected presence at the event. Better known for his film career, the actor rarely appears in TV shows, but working with Andy Samberg in the 2012 movie That&rsquo;s My Boy, may have made Adam Sandler&rsquo;s Brooklyn Nine-Nine cameo possible.</p>
<p>13  John C. McGinley
McGinley&rsquo;s Frank O&rsquo;Sullivan is the head of the police union</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 8 brought sitcom royalty on board as they cast John C. Ginley as one of the final installment&rsquo;s main villains. Most known for his role as Dr. Perry Cox in Scrubs, McGinley&rsquo;s character in Brooklyn Nine-Nine doesn&rsquo;t exactly play against type, but he definitely exaggerates the negative qualities that he gave to Dr. Cox. In the role of head of the police union, McGinley portrays Frank O&rsquo;Sullivan as just as stubborn and arrogant as his Scrubs counterpart.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine: The 10 Best Characters Introduced After Season 1
Brooklyn Nine-Nine always featured great characters and some of the best actually made their debut after the show&rsquo;s inaugural season.</p>
<p>12  J.K. Simmons
Frank Dillman was the best detective that Captain Holt ever knew</p>
<p>Simmons straddles the world of movies and TV, making appearances on both the big and small screen. Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 7, episode 9, &ldquo;Dillman,&rdquo; allowed the actor to pad his resume even further. As former detective Frank Dillman, Simmons brings his signature brand of authority to the world of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, only this time with a comic twist.
J.K. Simmons is best known for portraying J. Jonah Jameson in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy.</p>
<p>11  Bill Hader
Hader&rsquo;s Captain Dozerman had a brief spell in charge of the precinct</p>
<p>Following Captain Holt&rsquo;s promotion, the Nine-Nine needed a new leader. For a while, there was a revolving door of commanding officers. One of these new captains was Seth Dozerman, played by Saturday Night Live&rsquo;s Bill Hader. Dozerman&rsquo;s authoritarian regime didn&rsquo;t go down well with the detectives, and his anger ended up being his end as he suffered a heart attack while reprimanding Jake and Amy for their office romance.
Bill Hader&rsquo;s sole appearance in Brooklyn Nine-Nine took place in season 3, episode 1, &ldquo;New Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>10  Eva Longoria
Her character dates Jake Peralta in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 2</p>
<p>Eva Longoria plays Jake&rsquo;s defense attorney girlfriend in four episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 2. The pair, while well-matched on a personal level, have competing interests throughout their courtship due to their jobs. Brooklyn Nine-Nine was one of the first of Eva Longoria&rsquo;s projects after Desperate Housewives, where she starred as Gabrielle Solis for eight seasons. She had one of the longest runs as a guest star on Brooklyn Nine-Nine.</p>
<p>9  Zooey Deschanel
The character of Jess Day crossed over from New Girl</p>
<p>Zooey Deschanel was starring in her show at the same time as the police sitcom was on the air. As a result, New Girl and Brooklyn Nine-Nine crossed over in 2016, with Deschanel&rsquo;s character making a cameo appearance in Andy Samberg&rsquo;s show. The exchange in Jess&rsquo; car is brief and frantic during a high-speed pursuit, but it&rsquo;s one of the more memorable guest appearances due to the wider ramifications of a shared sitcom world.</p>
<p>8  Chris Parnell
Parnell played a former lawyer who blamed his downfall on Jake</p>
<p>Yet another member of the Saturday Night Live cast joined Brooklyn Nine-Nine in season 2, with Chris Parnell playing the role of Geoffrey Hoytsman in a pair of episodes. Hoytsman holds Jake hostage in season 2, episode 19, &ldquo;Sabotage,&rdquo; as revenge for Parnell&rsquo;s character losing his job due to Jake arresting him for drug use during his previous appearance on the show. The fallen lawyer&rsquo;s mini-arc is as amusing as it is tragic, and Parnell plays the part well. Chris Parnell&rsquo;s voice is probably most recognizable as Ricky and Morty&rsquo;s Jerry Smith, but he also had a recurring role as Dr. Leo Spaceman in all seven seasons of 30 Rock.</p>
<p>7  Lin-Manuel Miranda
Amy Santiago&rsquo;s brother is played by a Broadway star</p>
<p>Perhaps most famous as the award-winning composer of properties such as Hamilton and Encanto, Lin-Manuel Miranda&rsquo;s cameo in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 6, episode 9, &ldquo;The Golden Child,&rdquo; added to his acting credits. The episode provides some insight into Amy&rsquo;s childhood, showing her struggles as she grew up with a brother who set a very high standard for the rest of the Santiago siblings. Miranda gives a compelling performance in his role as David Santiago, playing the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; son.</p>
<p>6  Kathryn Hahn
Hahn&rsquo;s portrayal of Charles Boyle&rsquo;s ex-wife does her character&rsquo;s poor reputation justice</p>
<p>Boyle mentions his ex-wife Eleanor Horstweil numerous times throughout Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but she isn&rsquo;t shown on-screen until Kathryn Hahn brings her to life in season 3, episode 11, &ldquo;Hostage Situation.&rdquo; Hahn&rsquo;s performance shows exactly what earned Eleanor her nickname of &ldquo;The Destroyer of Worlds.&rdquo; The former Mrs. Boyle bursts onto the scene from Charles&rsquo; past and tries to derail his future by withholding his sperm. For such a brief appearance, Hahn&rsquo;s character leaves her mark on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, with her actions leading to Charles adopting Nickolaj.
Kathryn Hahn rose further into prominence after starring as Agatha Harkness in 2021&rsquo;s Wandavision, a role that earned her the spin-off show, Agatha: Darkhold Diaries.</p>
<p>5  Ed Helms
The Office star played an obnoxious USPIS agent</p>
<p>Believing himself to be above the NYPD, Jack Donger is far from a capable investigator. However, it doesn&rsquo;t stop him giving it a try during his big break in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 2, episode 8, &ldquo;USPIS.&rdquo; Donger proves to be a very hard man to work with in the episode, and is at times more interested in the glory of the position he holds rather than the case at hand. Ed Helms, on the other hand, does a good job, and shades of his performance as Andy Bernard in The Office show through at times.</p>
<p>4  Tim Meadows
Jake Peralta&rsquo;s cannibal cellmate was played by another star of Saturday Night Live</p>
<p>During Jake&rsquo;s unjust spell in prison, he becomes associated with an unusually friendly cannibal called Caleb John Gosche. Caleb, played by Tim Meadows, pops up four times in the show. Following his two episodes in Brooklyn Nine-Nine season 5, he also returns for an appearance in season 6 and one in season 8. Meadows&rsquo; character goes through phases of being able to control his taste for human flesh. He has the ability to make the strangely hilarious switch from placid to aggressively trying to sink his teeth into the forbidden meat at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>3  Fred Armisen
The character of Mlepnos is never really explained (which makes him funnier)</p>
<p>Armisen&rsquo;s appearances as Mleopnos in Brooklyn Nine-Nine are very sporadic, with him showing up in the most unusual of places. While his cameos never last all that long, the intrigue surrounding the character grows every time he returns to the show. Mlepnos&rsquo; entire backstory seems to be somewhat of a fabrication, with the details he offers upon each meeting with Jake changing every time. Eventually, Armisen&rsquo;s character starts pretending to have never met Jake, going as far as claiming that his name is actually Jerry.
Fred Armisen is a comedian, but also something of a journeyman actor. As well as Brooklyn Nine-Nine, he&rsquo;s had guest spots in sitcoms such as Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock, and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.</p>
<p>2  Nick Offerman
The Parks &amp; Recreation star steps into the shoes of Captain Holt&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend</p>
<p>Captain Holt is married to Kevin for the duration of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but Nick Offerman&rsquo;s guest appearance allows the show to explore Holt&rsquo;s romantic history. In season 3, episode 8, &ldquo;Ava,&rdquo; the ending of Frederick and Holt&rsquo;s relationship comes back to haunt the precinct, as Frederick refuses to help with the delivery of Terry&rsquo;s daughter until Holt apologizes. The apology in question is regarding the captain of the Nine-Nine&rsquo;s unceremonious disposal of his former lover&rsquo;s antique duck from when they were dating, which is very on-brand for Raymond Holt.</p>
<p>1  Craig Robinson
The Pontiac Bandit&rsquo;s episodes became a hallmark of each season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine</p>
<p>Craig Robinson&rsquo;s guest roles as Doug Judy (A.K.A The Pontiac Bandit) happened at least once per season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. As a result, Robinson&rsquo;s character could be fleshed out much more than many other stars from outside the main cast. The most rewarding part of Judy&rsquo;s arc is the unexpected friendship that blossoms between him and Jake Peralta, a companionship that runs so deep that it threatens Boyle. Doug Judy&rsquo;s Brooklyn Nine-Nine send-off may not have taken the same approach as the rest of his episodes, but Craig Robinson&rsquo;s multiple cameos are remembered as some of the best Brooklyn Nine-Nine episodes.
All 8 seasons of Brooklyn Nine-Nine are available to stream on Peacock.</p>
