## Literature Review
My Hero Academia&#39;s sixth season contained one of the series&#39; greatest story arcs to date, and now fans can finally own it for themselves.




My Hero Academia&#39;s sixth season was highly anticipated by fans in 2022, as it was set to adapt one of the most popular and acclaimed arcs in the series to date, the Paranormal Liberation War. Fans were blown away by how well the anime managed to capture the mood of the apocalyptic arc, and the stage was set for many more exciting stories that still lie ahead.




My Hero Academia has been one of the most popular anime series in recent years, and the quality of its sixth season is just further proof that it&#39;s deserving of its fame. Part 1 of Season 6 is finally hitting shelves now, about a year after the episodes originally aired. The combined Blu-Ray/DVD release, which features episodes 114 through 126, as well as a two-part OVA and special features, currently has an MSRP of $69.98, but thrifty fans are likely to find a good deal if they spend some time looking around (It&#39;s currently marked down to $52.49 on Crunchyroll&#39;s own web shop, for example).

          

Part 1 covers the entirety of the Paranormal Liberation War arc, making it a must-have for dedicated fans. The release&#39;s presentation and features are a bit run-of-the-mill, but having the OVA really adds more value to the release.





 The Paranormal Liberation War is My Hero Academia At Its Best 
          

My Hero Academia may be in its sixth season, but the first half covers what is arguably the greatest run of episodes the series has seen to date, making it an easy decision for fans as to whether this particular Blu-ray set is worth it. The animation is overall phenomenal, and these episodes are absolutely packed with action and high stakes, as both My Hero Academia&#39;s villains and heroes die over the course of the battle. The series&#39; themes and ideals are put to the test, with major reveals that rock some characters to their core. It embodies everything that fans love about My Hero Academia, and sets the stage well for the back half of the season.

                  My Hero Academia Season 7: Story, Characters, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   Everything there is to know about My Hero Academia&#39;s seventh season, including the upcoming story, new characters, and more.    






 My Hero Academia&#39;s Blu-ray Release Could Use More Special Features 
          

As far as the actual release itself is concerned, it&#39;s pretty typical of what fans can expect from a first-time home video release. Aside from the season 6 episodes themselves, the discs also contain a two-part OVA, &#34;Make It! Do-or-Die Survival Training!&#34;, which is set during season 4 of the anime. The OVAs have been available to stream before, but this is the first time they&#39;ve been available in Blu-ray form outside of Japan. The story of the OVA is relatively light-hearted, and makes for a good palate cleanser after the intensity of season 6.

When it comes to other special features, however, that&#39;s where the Blu-ray release is lacking. Special features include promo videos, and textless versions of the Season 6, part 1 opening and ending sequences. The promo videos are Japanese TV commercials from before season 6&#39;s release, which are kind of interesting to watch after the fact to see what was withheld for spoilers and what was teased for those in the know, but in total it only amounts to a few minutes of extra content. Fans would surely welcome other features, like commentary tracks from English voice actors, which the international distribution should be able to accommodate. Still, My Hero Academia season 6 part 1 happens to contain such amazing episodes that it&#39;s worth it for fans to pick up, regardless of special features.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
