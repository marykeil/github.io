## Literature Review
A forgotten installment in The Walking Dead franchise solved a major mystery stemming from the central plot of Fear the Walking Dead season 6.




A forgotten series in The Walking Dead universe resolved a major mystery from Fear the Walking Dead season 6. The sixth season of the spinoff explored a new threat in the form of a nuclear bomb. Up against a serial killer turned cult leader named Teddy, the group had to contend with the possibility of a nuclear explosion wiping out part of Texas.




Going in this direction allowed for the show to play with the lore, considering that it paved the way for the show to create a nuclear apocalypse setting for season 7. It defined season 6 as well and provided the show with opportunities to dive not only into the background of principal characters like John Dorie, but also answered questions about other events happening outside Fear the Walking Dead’s main cast. The introduction of Teddy’s cult and the nuclear submarine shed highlighted a surprising consequence of the zombie virus outbreak. But in the process of revealing this information, the series also raised a new mystery, one that was later answered in another spinoff.

The center of Fear the Walking Dead season 6’s plot, the U.S.S. Pennsylvania was the subject of several questions. Quite a lot wasn’t known about it, such as the circumstances that led to the outbreak spreading onboard, how it was beached, and how Riley ended up the key. The mystery wasn’t covered within the story of season 6, but was covered thoroughly in an easily-overlooked spinoff. Released on AMC&#43; in 2022 (when season 7 was airing), Fear the Walking Dead: Dead in the Water was a web series comprised of six episodes that focused on the U.S.S. Pennsylvania crew (including Riley). It showed what happened to the crew and culminated in only a few survivors getting away.




In Fear the Walking Dead, there were zombies whose uniforms named them “Voss” and “Garza.” Both were featured in Dead in the Water, which showed exactly how they died. Apparently, the U.S.S. Pennsylvania crew went down one by one as a chain reaction started by one of their own dying from an appendicitis during the start of the outbreak. This whittled them down to just a handful of survivors. Walter wound up with one of the launch keys when they escaped, which also explains why he had it in his possession when Emile the bounty hunter found him in the Fear the Walking Dead season 6 premiere.



 Fear The Walking Dead&#39;s Spinoff Still Didn&#39;t Answer 1 Question 
          

Dead in the Water succeeded in clearing up the many mysteries stemming from the U.S.S. Pennsylvania’s role in Fear the Walking Dead’s story, but did leave one stone unturned. Curiously, season 6’s exploration of the sub showed some of the zombies in handcuffs. This was taken as odd, especially since there wouldn’t normally be prisoners aboard a submarine. At no point in the webisodes’ story was this detail acknowledged. The rest of the picture, on the other hand, stands fully revealed in Dead in the Water. Because of the additional spinoff, the franchise has a well-fleshed-out backstory for a massive part of Fear the Walking Dead’s mythos.
