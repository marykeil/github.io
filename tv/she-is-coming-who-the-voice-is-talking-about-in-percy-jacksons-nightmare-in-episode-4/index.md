## Literature Review
In Percy Jackson&#39;s nightmare in episode 4, the voice warns that someone is coming. This is an ominous hint to a very powerful future character.




Warning: This article contains spoilers for Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 4 and the Percy Jackson books.




In a nightmare at the beginning of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4, Percy hears a voice warning that someone is coming. The Percy Jackson series has already subtly hinted at future events from Rick Riordan&#39;s Percy Jackson book series, seen in Kronos&#39; communication with Percy. With Riordan and the Percy Jackson and the Olympians cast so dedicated to a faithful adaptation, all pieces of information or subtle Easter eggs are undoubtedly intentional for future episodes and seasons.

In episode 4, for instance, Grover shares the story of Pan and his own desire to find him, despite how every satyr who&#39;s tried has not returned. This sets up Grover&#39;s quest to carry this out, which he embarks on at the end of the first book, Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. Episode 4 also expands on Thalia again and how she made Annabeth earn her trust and care. But Percy&#39;s nightmare sets up a key character&#39;s introduction that is a major part of the franchise&#39;s lore overall.

 Percy Jackson Episode 4&#39;s Teases Suggest Kronos Warned Young Percy About Gaia 
          

The voice Percy hears in his nightmare, which he doesn&#39;t know is Kronos&#39; yet, says &#34;A forbidden child attracts attention. A forbidden hero, well, they attract doom. She is coming.&#34; This immediately suggests that Percy&#39;s heroism will result in much worse destruction than he&#39;s been experiencing with the monsters seeking him so far. Given that Echidna is episode 4&#39;s main antagonist, it&#39;s an easy assumption that the voice was referring to her. However, given the context of Riordan&#39;s books and Echidna&#39;s short-lived threat to Percy, it&#39;s unlikely.




Echidna is a worthy opponent since she&#39;s known as the mother of monsters. Yet, even Echidna alludes to Gaia when she mentions her lineage and suggests a distant relation to Percy. Gaia is the primordial goddess of the Earth, from whom the Titans, like Kronos, were born. This would make Gaia Percy&#39;s great-grandmother, as Kronos is Poseidon&#39;s father. Therefore, in young Percy&#39;s nightmare, it&#39;s plausible that Kronos was warning him about a future threat, since Gaia could impact his overall story because of her immense power.



 Why The Voice Would Warn About Gaia (&amp; When She Could Appear In Percy Jackson&#39;s Show) 
          

In mythology and Riordan&#39;s Percy Jackson books, Gaia has extremely formidable abilities that draw power from the Earth itself. She can heal, create sentient life forms (including monsters), and utilize earth manipulation as she is the embodiment of the Earth. Given that she also has awareness of what goes on anywhere on Earth, her omniscience makes her a challenging threat. Unfortunately for Percy, he is one of the demigods she&#39;s most opposed to since he plays a major role in defeating her son Kronos.




However, her first major input in the book series is in The Battle of Labyrinth, which is the fourth book, where she heals Poseidon&#39;s son, Antaeus, in the Labyrinth&#39;s arena as he fights Percy. With that being said, she might make an appearance in the season 1 finale very briefly, since the finale is based on the book chapter where a giant scorpion stings Percy. Gaia notoriously sent a giant scorpion to sting her son Orion. If she makes an early appearance in Percy&#39;s disorientated state, it could link back to Kronos&#39; warning and plant seeds for her appearance in any potential future seasons of Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
