Summary

  Doctor Who is embracing the controversial Timeless Child storyline, as seen in &#34;The Timeless Children.&#34;   Both Ruby and the Doctor are foundlings, creating a strong parallel between their origins and building comparisons.   Ruby&#39;s mysterious backstory will continue to be a focal point in season 14, hinting at more exploration of her origins beyond what has been shown.  







The new era of Doctor Who is pushing the show forward, and it&#39;s not afraid to embrace the controversial Timeless Child storyline. The Timeless Child, introduced by Chris Chibnall during his time in the showrunner&#39;s chair, was rejected by much of the fanbase following its reveal in 2020. The story began during season 12, episode 10, &#34;The Timeless Children.&#34; However, Russell T. Davies seems to be a fan of the plot twist, and has already addressed it numerous times since his recent return as showrunner.

The Timeless Child completely changed the Doctor&#39;s backstory, making them a foundling who was abandoned on Gallifrey rather being native to the planet. In addition, the Master also revealed to the Doctor that the show&#39;s titular character had many regenerations prior to William Hartnell&#39;s First Doctor that they don&#39;t remember. Although the latter half of the reveal would be difficult to achieve with a human character, the new companion for Doctor Who season 14 would seem to be following the same framework as the Doctor&#39;s foundling origin.




                  How Doctor Who Showrunner RTD Developed Ruby Sunday&#39;s Foundling Backstory   Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies reveals the surprising source of inspiration behind newest companion Ruby Sunday&#39;s backstory as a foundling.    


 Doctor Who Is Doubling Down On The Timeless Child Ahead Of Season 14 
The controversial storyline is being thrust into the spotlight
          

A Doctor&#39;s companion often shares a feeling of loneliness with the Doctor, and this is often at least part of the reason the pair end up traveling together. However, Ruby Sunday would seem to have something else in common with the Doctor instead. Although she is not lonely and has a loving family, Ruby and the Doctor are both foundlings. During a discussion regarding Ruby&#39;s adoption in the Doctor Who 2023 Christmas special, &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor also volunteers the information that he too is &#34;adopted.&#34;




The brief exchange confirms that Doctor Who is not only acknowledging the existence of the Timeless Child story, but bringing it to the foreground. By highlighting the Timeless Child, it&#39;s a sign that the twist will play a sizable role in the coming season or seasons of Doctor Who. Russell T. Davies is adept at planting narrative seeds that only bloom much later, so this seemingly benign conversation will likely become something much more important down the line.



 Ruby Sunday&#39;s Origin Parallels The Timeless Child 
Ruby and the Doctor have similar origins
         

While the backstories of the Doctor and Millie Gibson&#39;s Ruby Sunday may not be a direct comparison, there are some glaring similarities that are impossible to ignore. For example, both Ruby and the Doctor were abandoned during their early years and are unsure of how far they are from their true home. Another similarity is that they were taken in and raised by those nearby as one of their own. Having two Timeless Children traveling together in the TARDIS is a nice parallel, as it helps continue to build the comparisons between Ruby and the Doctor.




Taking the same origin template from the Doctor and applying it to Ruby is a clever move by Russell T. Davies. Doing so allows the Doctor to travel with a companion who stands the chance of understanding him better than any of Ruby&#39;s predecessors ever have. In addition, the knowledge of being a foundling is still fairly new to the Doctor, whereas Ruby has lived with the knowledge of her origins for her whole life and can offer him guidance and support.



 Russell T Davies Has Hinted Ruby&#39;s Origin Is An Ongoing Mystery 
The backstory of Ruby Sunday is currently shrouded in mystery
          

The returning Doctor Who showrunner has revealed that Ruby&#39;s mysterious backstory will continue to be a focal point throughout season 14. However, he has also stated that Ruby&#39;s origins will be explored beyond what has already been shown in &#34;The Church on Ruby Road.&#34; Ruby is clearly not an ordinary companion, as her history has just as much to offer Doctor Who&#39;s narrative as her future does.




                  Who Is Ruby&#39;s Mother In Doctor Who? 7 Biggest Theories After The Christmas Special   Doctor Who has introduced Millie Gibson as the Doctor&#39;s new companion, Ruby Sunday, and set up a thrilling mystery - who is her mother..?    

During Davies&#39; first stint as Doctor Who showrunner, the Doctor had a number of companions. This was partly due due to the final four specials with David Tennant&#39;s Tenth Doctor just after season 4, where the show took on a companion-of-the-week format. However, for the majority of Davies&#39; initial spell in charge, the Doctor traveled with either Rose Tyler or Donna Noble. Both women went on to have enrapturing arcs, but all of their adventures lay ahead of them at the time. Ruby has the advantage of also having a rich history to delve into.



 The Goblins Thrived On Coincidence In Doctor Who&#39;s 2023 Christmas Special 
The meeting of Ruby and the Doctor proved irresistible to Doctor Who&#39;s Goblins
          




The villains in &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; take the form of fairly traditional-looking Goblins. The small creatures are attracted to chance, bad luck, and coincidence. For the duration of the episode, the Goblins always seem to be in the vicinity of Ruby, causing her to make mistakes and to make her more appealing to their race. While the arrival of Ruby&#39;s foster sister on the same day as her own birthday would certainly fuel the Goblins&#39; desire for happenstance, her run-in with the Doctor would have the same impact.

The Doctor and Ruby having such similar backstories could have contributed to the Goblins&#39; desire to travel back in time and attempt to abduct and eat Ruby as a baby. While the idea of a single foundling may not have been too appealing to the Goblins in Doctor Who, the fact that two people from different worlds would share such parallel origins is likely to have added to their appetite.



 Ruby&#39;s DNA Couldn&#39;t Be Found By Davina&#39;s TV Show 
The event made Ruby even more similar to the Doctor
          




&#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; opens up with Ruby being interviewed by British TV show host, Davina McCall. In an attempt to find her birth parents, Ruby has seemingly applied to TV show that can aid her in her quest to track down her true lineage. However, Davina calls Ruby later in the episode to tell her that their search has been completely unsuccessful. Although the Doctor may have once had information regarding their parentage, the Timeless Child reveal has altered their history, meaning both the Doctor and Ruby are enduring the same battle.

Although Davina states that failure was always a possibility, Ruby is distressed and confused that no match was found anywhere. The lack of scientific clues regarding Ruby&#39;s ancestry only adds to the comparisons between her and the Doctor in terms of them both being foundlings. As a result, it could be argued that the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS now has two inhabitants that fit the moniker of the Timeless Child. Despite being one of the least popular storylines in Doctor Who history, the twist that emerged from &#34;The Timeless Children&#34; seems to be continuing to thrive rather than languishing in obscurity.






The Doctor Who 2023 Christmas special, &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; is available to stream now on Disney&#43;.
