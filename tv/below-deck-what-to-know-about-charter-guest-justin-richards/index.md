## Literature Review
Justin Richards appeared as a charter guest on Below Deck season 9. Here&#39;s everything to know about the luxury real estate agent.




Justin Richards joined the My Seanna superyacht as a charter guest on Below Deck season 9, but there&#39;s plenty more to know about him. Unfortunately, Justin wasn&#39;t received well on Below Deck, which is widely considered one of the best reality TV shows. Not only did he come off as obnoxious due to his drunken antics, but also for how he spoke to his colleague, Terri, another guest on the boat. It&#39;s safe to say Justin did not make the best first impression on the crew. As fans await Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to catch up with the former charter guest.




Toward the end of the episode, Justin got into a screaming match with Terri, which worried the crew. At one point, Chief Stew Heather Chase had to break up the two to avoid anything more serious. The rest of the crew sneakily gathered around to watch the commotion, with First Officer Eddie Lucas stepping in to block Terri from getting close to Justin. However, the episode was left on a cliffhanger, with questions regarding how the verbal altercation between Justin and Terri ultimately ended.

For more than a decade, Justin and his team have built a leading business practice that has guided property buyers and sellers across Bellevue, Washington, through the home buying and selling process. Besides his success as a real estate agent, Justin is also a member of the Agent Leadership Council.






 Justin Has A Daughter 
          

Besides working hard in the real estate industry, Justin has a loving family at home that he is proud of. Justin is the father of his beautiful daughter Sydney Michelle, who he calls the &#34;light of his life.&#34; There is no mention of a significant other, so it is safe to assume that Justin is single. In his free time, Justin enjoys traveling and likes all kinds of fast vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and planes, and he even trains new real estate professionals on how to start their careers successfully. However, it&#39;s difficult to ascertain his current situation, as his social media has gone dark.

On Below Deck, Justin came on the boat with several colleagues, including Michael Durham. So far, Justin has gotten drunk often and was rude to his colleagues. He even left the dinner table to enjoy his meal alone. While Justin and his colleagues weren&#39;t the best guests on Below Deck, they have become one of the more entertaining groups on the show.
