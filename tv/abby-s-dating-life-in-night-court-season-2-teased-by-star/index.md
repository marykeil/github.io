## Literature Review
Night Court star Melissa Rauch reveals the storylines that can be expected from a newly single Abby Stone in upcoming season 2 episodes.




Night Court star Melissa Rauch has shared an update about the future romantic life of her character Abby Stone. Abby is the lead of the sitcom revival, a follow-up to the long-running show of the same name, which lasted for nine seasons between 1984 and 1992. The daughter of the original character Harry Stone (who was played by the late Harry Anderson), Abby is a night shift judge at the Manhattan Criminal Court who broke up with her fiancé Rand (Pete Holmes) at the end of season 1.




AwardsRadar recently conducted an interview with Rauch ahead of the official premiere of Night Court season 2 (after kicking off with a Christmas special in December 2023). When asked what to expect from Abby&#39;s single life, she detailed some of the storylines that viewers will be able to see play out throughout the season. This includes &#34;a double date with her and Olivia&#34; and Abby&#39;s &#34;first online dating profile.&#34; The star says, &#34;I think there’s a lot of fun to be had in seeing... this side of Abby.&#34; Check out her full quote, as well as the video interview, below:


I think she’s gonna be trying to see what the city has to offer, going on some first dates… There’s an episode [we’re] working on now that’s a double date with her and Olivia [the assistant D.A. played by India de Beaufort], which is… a lot of fun to play. And really, her realizing that she hasn’t been in the dating world for quite some time and just putting herself out there and what that looks like, even her trying to create her first online dating profile and what that looks like. I think there’s a lot of fun to be had in seeing this version and this side of Abby.






 


 Night Court Season 2 Is Going To Look Very Different 
          

It is not altogether uncommon for a sitcom character to experience a major breakup that leads to a big change in their lifestyle. However, one thing that will make this particular change different is the fact that she no longer has a possible partner to fall back on in the main Night Court cast. Although Abby&#39;s clerk Neil (Kapil Talwalkar) nursed an unrequited crush on her, it was announced in late 2023 that Talwalkar would not be reprising the role in season 2.



Although Talwalkar&#39;s exit was not yet announced when it premiered, the star did not appear in the Night Court Christmas special.







One reason that was cited for the departure of Neil was the fact that the producers of the show wanted to focus on more of a revolving door of wacky characters, like the original sitcom. Talwalkar&#39;s absence will indeed allow the show to lean in on that approach. In addition to having new characters come through her courtroom, one-off guest stars could also be given the opportunity to appear as potential romantic interests for Abby.

With both of these factors in play at once, the upcoming season of the Night Court revival could look very different. It remains to be seen how audiences respond to such a major change. However, as Rauch reveals, there are already quite a few storylines in place exploring Abby&#39;s romantic future, so the show is clearly embracing the exploration of her new romantic status.
