## Literature Review
Succession may have ended after the fourth season last year, but Paul Giamatti stars in another high-finance, antihero show that can take its place.




After Succession&#39;s dominant run through the recent Golden Globe awards, another Golden Globe winner, Paul Giamatti, may be able to provide the perfect replacement for those missing the HBO smash hit. Succession ended last year after its fourth season, and it&#39;s getting a lot of buzz during awards season. With the show back in the news, it has renewed fans&#39; interest and left them searching for any other suitable replacements that can fill the Logan Roy-sized hole in their prestige television watching.




Paul Giamatti, fresh off his win for Best Male Actor - Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy for The Holdovers, actually starred in a show that could serve as the perfect Succession replacement. In fact, all seven seasons of this show are available to stream right now for those needing their fix of dysnfunctional, rich New York City upper crust. Succession proved to be a show that was wildly popular despite never having a single character with many redeeming qualities, and Giamatti fits that mold alongside his co-stars in their hit Showtime series.


 Paul Giamatti&#39;s Billions Is A Perfect Replacement For Succession Fans 
          

For seven seasons, Paul Giamatti starred in Billions as Charles &#34;Chuck&#34; Rhoades, a U.S. Attorney in the New York District who later is elected Attorney General of the state. Rhoades&#39; focus throughout the series centers around taking on Bobby &#34;Axe&#34; Axelrod (played by Damian Lewis), a hedge fund manager who seeks to gain as much wealth and power as he can in the world of high-class New York City. The power struggle between these two and their closest confidants mirrors the internal riffs between the Roy family in Succession as they try to angle for their father&#39;s good favor and control of his company.






All seven seasons of Billions are available for streaming on the Paramount&#43; service.




In the show, Rhoades&#39; wife Wendy (Maggie Siff) is also employed at various points as an in-house coach and psychologist for Axelrod&#39;s hedge fund. The intrigue and almost incestuous nature of Wendy trying to play both sides mirrors the dark family dynamics of Succession and the underhanded ways in which all characters on both shows use to gain power and leverage. Like Succession and many other prestige television shows of the last 25 years, the cast of Billions is built around the idea of antiheroes; characters that are unscrupulous and under-handed, even if their underlying intentions are good.



 What Billions Has In Common With Succession 
          




While Billions may not have the piercing family dynamics and backstabbing that a show like Succession was famous for, there are still plenty of similarities and parallels between the two shows. Both take place among the world of the mega-rich in New York City; essentially the top 1% of the 1%. Succession was known for showcasing a taste of what life was like for billionaires, with exotic scenes on yachts in the Mediterranean or Italian weddings or mansions in the Hamptons. That same level of high society is portrayed all throughout Billions as it follows billionaire Bobby Axelrod and the underhanded dealings he often works in to build his fortune.

Those less-than-savory practices, changing alliances, and betrayed power brokers that make up the essence of Billions were also a large part of what made Succession so successful for HBO. Instead of a hard-headed, ruthless U.S. Attorney trying to take down Axelrod&#39;s hedge fund empire, Succession was based around a family rotting and plotting from the inside as each member wanted to position themselves for control of the WayStar Royco empire once the patriarch Logan Roy was no longer alive. With similar themes, commentary about the ultra-rich, and dark humor, the seven seasons of Billions can be the perfect replacement for anyone missing Succession.






There are reports that Showtime plans to build a Billions universe, including shows called Millions and Trillions.




             Billions Billions is a drama series created for Showtime that follows hedge fund manager Bobby Axelrod&#39;s quest to accumulate power and wealth, often leading him to utilize unscrupulous tactics. The one man standing in his way is U.S. Attorney Chuck Rhoades - who will do what it takes to ensure Axelrod is brought to justice. The series is based on several real-world cases featuring dramatizations and embellishments for entertainment purposes.  Cast   Maggie Siff , Toby Leonard Moore , Frank Harts , Malin Akerman , Paul Giamatti , Melissa Joyce , David Costabile , Damian Lewis , Daniel K. Isaac    Streaming Service(s)   Apple TV&#43; , Amazon Prime Video
