## Literature Review
Christine Brown from Sister Wives doesn’t tell Kody Brown about her wedding to David Woolley. He ends up learning about the big day from someone else.




Sister Wives star Kody Brown revealed that he would’ve had no idea about Christine Brown’s wedding if it hadn’t been for his sister. The Brown family patriarch was once in a stable polygamous relationship with all four of his wives. However, things changed when Kody began preferring Robyn Brown over everyone else, making his other partners jealous. Christine was the first of Kody’s wives to quit the polygamous relationship. She divorced him in 2021 and began focusing on her happiness. In 2023, Christine found David Woolley, her soulmate. She married him merely a year later.




Recently, ET posted a preview of Sister Wives: Christine &amp; David’s Wedding. It featured Kody talking about Christine’s wedding to David and how he learned about it in the first place.


 

The Sister Wives star said, “I saw a wedding announcement at my sister’s house,” stating that it was how he learned about his former wife’s marriage. Kody also claimed that the whole scenario just made him curious. He added, “It was kind of curious to me that some of my family had been invited to the wedding.”

The preview clip also showed Kody sharing his feelings for Christine’s new relationship and her marriage. He said, “I’m really fine. I’m resolved with it.” Robyn added her two cents and claimed she was also happy for Christine and David. She said, “That’s what we want.” Kody then claimed that Christine had told their children that he and Robyn were soulmates, so she’d find her own. He added, “She’s found her soulmate, and so I’m happy for her for that fact.” Kody concluded his statement by admitting he was initially angry at Christine but has since become happy for her.

Kody’s revelation that he learned about Christine’s wedding from her sister isn’t too shocking. He was previously Christine’s husband. Therefore, it makes sense that Christine didn’t tell him about her special day and only invited those close to her. It would’ve been extremely awkward for Christine to ask Kody to attend her wedding, especially since they didn’t break up on a good note. It would’ve also been impossible for Kody to listen to Christine at the time, as he was previously very angry at her for leaving him.




Whether Kody and Robyn liked it or not, Christine has shown that she made the right choice by marrying David. In recent months, the 51-year-old Utah native has shared many moments on social media showing her happiness and contentment with her new husband. She has shared photos celebrating holidays with him and traveling around. It doesn’t seem like Christine misses being with Kody anymore. The Sister Wives star took the right step by listening to her heart and getting serious with David, as he still respects and loves her.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
