  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Family Chantel&rsquo;s Lidia Morel is one tough cookie. She made Chantel Everett&rsquo;s life very hard. Lidia was in the wrong and she should apologize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinary is just what you&rsquo;re used to. This may not seem ordinary to you right now, but after a time it will. This will become ordinary.&rdquo; - Aunt Lydia, The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</p>
<p>The Family Chantel&rsquo;s Lidia Morel made Chantel Everett&rsquo;s life a living hell, just like The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo;s Aunt Lydia, who was willing to tie up, whip and tase women who didn&rsquo;t follow her Draconian rules. Lidia is one of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise&rsquo;s most obvious villains. There isn&rsquo;t a lot of softness in her personality, and for her cruel treatment of Chantel alone, she deserves the monster label. For years, the sadistic Lidia seemed to delight in hurting her daughter-in-law, whose only &ldquo;crime&rdquo; was loving her son, Pedro Jimeno.
When Chantel started dating Pedro, she was ecstatic. To her, he was the perfect man. Deeply idealistic, Chantel put Pedro on a pedestal. For a while, it seemed like things could work - the duo appeared to be in tune. They were seemingly very much in love. Just as The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale showed empowered women with fulfilling lives and loving partners being stripped of everything that they valued, The Family Chantel showed Chantel being emotionally abused by her mother-in-law, who did all that she could to ruin Chantel&rsquo;s life.

<p>8  Chantel Everett Could Never Please Lidia Morel
Lidia Morel&rsquo;s A Cold &amp; Calculating Woman</p>
<p>As per the Hulu clip shown above, The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo;s Aunt Lydia made a group of women follow rules that basically put them back in the Dark Ages. These unlucky females were forced to try and bear the children of commanders. However, the handmaids weren&rsquo;t their wives. Under the guise of a mentor and confidante, Aunt Lydia would try to meet her goal, which was presenting healthy babies to higher-ups whose wives couldn&rsquo;t conceive. Beneath the surface, Aunt Lydia was pure poison. She was willing to choose violence in order to punish rule-breakers.
Like Aunt Lydia, Lidia tried to sugarcoat her personality.
“People say that I have a strong personality, that I’m an evil woman and a meddler in my kids’ life. But I think they don’t understand me.”</p>
<p>However, she made no real effort to connect with her daughter-in-law, and Chantel&rsquo;s not a bad person. While Lidia lacks Aunt Lydia&rsquo;s flimsy facade, she shares her appetite for destruction. When crossed, Lidia is a nightmare. She would never give Chantel her approval, no matter how hard the young woman tried to please her. Any attempts to ingratiate herself with Lidia were doomed to fail. This disturbing dynamic led to some terrible fights. By withholding affection, Lidia set the stage for all the drama that unfolded onscreen.</p>
<p>7  Lidia&rsquo;s Romantic History Made Her Bitter
The Same Thing Happened To Aunt Lydia</p>
<p>Maybe Lidia didn&rsquo;t want Chantel to enjoy romantic happiness because she never really had that herself. Instead, she had a secret family with a married man. Yes, the father of Lidia&rsquo;s children, Pedro and The Family Chantel&rsquo;s Nicole Jimeno, was married to someone else the entire time. This sort of The Jerry Springer Show scenario doesn&rsquo;t exactly scream, &ldquo;true love.&rdquo;
The married man wouldn&rsquo;t leave his wife for Lidia, and this might have made Lidia feel angry or ashamed, or both. While children are always miracles, Lidia&rsquo;s made some bad decisions. She hurt another woman. She deprived Pedro and Nicole of a normal upbringing. Of course, the man she shares children with did that too.
In this 90DF monster&rsquo;s defense, she needed the money and supplies that Pedro Jimeno Sr. used to bring her. He would load his car with things they needed and then deliver them. He used to see his kids, but when they were still young, those visits stopped. That left Lidia with all the parenting. Lidia&rsquo;s reportedly a divorce attorney, so she does have the capacity to earn money. However, as people who watch the show are surely aware of, money is a big deal for her. It is everything to Lidia.
She also cited DR culture as a reason why what she did was okay. It&rsquo;s true that it may be more accepted there. Nonetheless, it was a choice that was, in many ways, selfish. The outcome of that decision was years of single parenthood. While raising a child alone can be wonderful, rather than something to complain about, it&rsquo;s hard work.
As Lidia tried to move on by appearing on 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise, she was destined to experience more heartache. Lidia, who&rsquo;s now 56, split with Scott Wern, who&rsquo;d appeared on the spin-off with her, after some major-league drama. They reportedly had &ldquo;vengeance sex&rdquo; before calling it quits for good, as per InTouch Weekly. It was easy to question her motives when she appeared on Love In Paradise, as she and Scott really had nothing in common. It&rsquo;s quite possible that Lidia was on the show for financial reasons.
Aunt Lydia didn&rsquo;t take romantic rejection well. After a relationship went awry, she flew into a rage and smashed a mirror. These harsh women blame the world for their problems, and both would strongly benefit from self-reflection. However, that kind of inner life may be alien to them. They skirt along the surface of things instead. They get a lot of pleasure from hurting others, although there&rsquo;s always the chance that Lidia really is &ldquo;misunderstood.&rdquo; Based on the things that have played out onscreen, she&rsquo;s not a nice person.</p>
<p>6  Lidia Morel Failed Pedro &amp; Chantel
Aunt Lydia Failed Her &ldquo;Girls&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a person&rsquo;s child is old enough to get into a relationship, they need a little support, rather than the kind of parental disapproval that negatively impacts their love life. In this respect, Lidia could not deliver. She didn&rsquo;t help Pedro and Chantel. In fact, she and her daughter Nicole ganged up on their son&rsquo;s bride, seemingly considering Chantel one of the most unappealing human beings on the planet.
Similarly, Aunt Lydia failed her &ldquo;girls,&rdquo; as she referred to them onscreen. At first, she tried to gain their trust, but soon enough, as is the tyrant&rsquo;s way, she held on to her power by instilling fear in the handmaids. Any weak spot would be exploited. Her ability to find their psychological pressure points was uncanny.
No, Lidia doesn&rsquo;t use a cattle prod to get her point across, like Aunt Lydia does, but her words are her weapons. So is her silence. Aunt Lydia took a handmaid&rsquo;s eye, while Lidia was content to rob her daughter-in-law of peace of mind.</p>
<p>5  Perceived Disloyalty May Trigger Lidia (&amp; Aunt Lydia)
The Two Females Treat Women Badly</p>
<p>Everyone gets triggered by something, except for ice-cold beings like Lidia and Aunt Lydia. They are mostly impervious to the emotional levers that other people push and pull. As they are so callous, they may wear &ldquo;armor&rdquo; so they don&rsquo;t get hurt. In other words, they may push down any traces of empathy that exist, rather than allowing themselves to really feel other people&rsquo;s pain.
When Pedro got serious with Chantel, Lidia may have felt like he was abandoning her. That might have triggered her on some level, sparking the horrible behavior that she displayed on The Family Chantel. Perhaps she felt like Pedro&rsquo;s heart wasn&rsquo;t big enough. She may have believed that he couldn&rsquo;t love Chantel and love her too. What&rsquo;s disturbing is the fact that Pedro may have planned to leave Chantel all along. If so, he&rsquo;s really following in his mother&rsquo;s footsteps. That&rsquo;s a move straight from her own playbook.
Lidia didn&rsquo;t even feel bad about what she did to Pedro and Nicole&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s wife. What could hurt Lidia? Maybe some perceived disloyalty. Another way to wound her is to threaten her financial well-being. She&rsquo;s someone who&rsquo;s always been very interested in Pedro&rsquo;s bank account. When he was with Chantel, that was her money too. So, Lidia&rsquo;s desire to get money from the young couple didn&rsquo;t help them to stay together either.
A parent&rsquo;s supposed to give rather than taking. Somehow, Lidia missed this lesson. She taught her kids to look out for number one, and that&rsquo;s why the whole family is considered evil. They are not warm and fuzzy people.</p>
<p>4  Lidia &amp; Aunt Lydia May Use Brainwashing To Manipulate Others
Was Nicole Jimeno Brainwashed Into Hating Chantel?</p>
<p>At the dinner party from hell, as per 90 Day Fiancé at YouTube, Nicole and Pedro joined the Everetts for a shared meal that no one enjoyed. The food was &ldquo;muy bueno&rdquo; as per a perhaps insincere Nicole, but the chit-chat was excruciating. Karen clearly didn&rsquo;t trust Pedro&rsquo;s sister (with good reason). Nicole swept in like a Disney villain, and wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place if cast as a &ldquo;baddie&rdquo; in The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale. It&rsquo;s possible that Nicole would really love putting handmaids in their place.
Children learn from their parents, and there&rsquo;s almost no doubt whatsoever that Nicole learned to hate Chantel from her mother. If Nicole had a different parent, she might be a different person. It seems like Lidia brought out the worst in her daughter, or perhaps their narcissism has some genetic basis. For whatever reason, Nicole is incredibly arrogant. She loves torturing Nicole by putting her friend Coraima Morla close to Pedro, whom Coraima flirts with. Now that Chantel and Pedro are divorced, she may actually miss hassling her sister-in-law. Sometimes, it seems like a game.</p>
<p>3  Lidia &amp; Aunt Lydia Are Into Scare Tactics
Did Lidia Morel Try To Frighten Chantel?</p>
<p>Aunt Lydia will stage a fake hanging to put the fear of God into her handmaids. Lidia will act like the mother-in-law equivalent of a horror movie psycho in order to throw Chantel off balance. Although mother-in-law problems are more or less universal, Lidia is next-level vile. She has never given Chantel respect and love. She has never been polite. Lidia and her daughter are into dirty looks, eye-rolling and death stares. These intimidation tactics ramp up the campy drama onscreen, but they are a sign of insecurity. Would truly confident women act this way? Probably not.
Under the lacquered veneer that is Lidia and Nicole&rsquo;s brash self-confidence, there may be vulnerability. If there is, they&rsquo;re not going to let it show. If there isn&rsquo;t vulnerability, they&rsquo;re bad to the bone. Both females have seriously hurt Chantel - for years, she had in-laws who were enemies.</p>
<p>2  Lidia And Aunt Lydia Are Very Poor Role Models
They Have Both Gone To The Dark Side</p>
<p>Chantel was crushed when Pedro left. She was devastated. Now, on Instagram, Chantel&rsquo;s bravely moving forward, and possibly passive-aggressively posing with another man. Who can blame her? After the hazing she endured from Lidia and Nicole, she deserves to do whatever it takes to feel better. To add insult to injury, she surely realizes that Lidia&rsquo;s gloating over her divorce. Of course, Nicole is too. These women take pleasure from her pain, and there&rsquo;s a lot that Chantel needs to forget.</p>
<p>1  Lidia Turned Pedro Into A Monster
Aunt Lydia Would Approve</p>
<p>Pedro changed so much, morphing into an Aunt Lydia-esque form. Instead of the super-smooth dream man, he became the stuff of nightmares. It&rsquo;s like he flicked a switch in his mind, shutting off the part of him that cared about Chantel. Since he got so cold, it&rsquo;s likely that his love was fake all along, or at least much less strong than he pretended it was.
He says he used to love her. He uttered those words this season. However, he also said, &ldquo;Thanks God&rdquo; while talking about the fact that they were finally legally divorced. They&rsquo;ve had mutual restraining orders and all sorts of messiness. The problem with Pedro is that he seems perfectly happy offscreen, at Instagram, while Chantel&rsquo;s pain is still visible under the surface, if one looks closely enough. This makes him seem as monstrous as his mom.
Sure, people change, but Pedro&rsquo;s frostiness was, well, chilling.</p>
<p>Where could that kind of coldness come from? It&rsquo;s safe to say that The Family Chantel season 5 star Pedro is the apple that didn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree.
