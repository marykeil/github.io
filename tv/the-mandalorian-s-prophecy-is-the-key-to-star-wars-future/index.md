## Literature Review
The Mandalorian&#39;s prophecy of the Mand&#39;alor has massive implications for the future of Star Wars, and it could impact The Mandalorian movie.




An ancient Mandalorian prophecy, introduced in The Book of Boba Fett, is key to the future of The Mandalorian and the entire Star Wars galaxy. Star Wars isn&#39;t really a science-fiction franchise; rather, it&#39;s more science-fantasy. As such, themes of prophecy have come up quite a few times - most notably the Chosen One prophecy about Anakin Skywalker.




Prophecy and visions of the future have a disturbing history in Star Wars. The Chosen One prophecy led to the downfall and salvation of the Jedi, while Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas&#39; visions of the Clone Wars led to his commissioning the very clone army that would wipe the Jedi out. Anakin Skywalker&#39;s visions of Padmé&#39;s death became a self-fulfilling prophecy. All these examples mean viewers would be wise to take another prophecy very seriously - this one initially associated with Din Djarin and Grogu. After all, there hasn&#39;t been a single example of a prophecy having no impact on Star Wars as a whole.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    


 The Mandalorian Prophecy Explained 
         




In The Book of Boba Fett episoe 5, the Armorer reveals an ancient Mandalorian prophecy that holds hope for Mandalore. &#34;The songs of eons past foretold of the Mythosaur rising up to herald a new age of Mandalore,&#34; she recalls. The prophecy states that a new leader - the Mand&#39;alor - will rise and unite Mandalore. This great warrior will ride the Mythosaur into battle, heralding the new Age of the Mythosaur.

The prophecy appears to be linked to the Living Waters of Mandalore, a term that - like many aspects of Mandalorian lore - is influenced by the Hebrew Bible. It iis taken directly from Jeremiah 2:13 and 17:13, where God likens Himself to living waters. Further, Zechariah also prophesied that living water would flow throughout Israel and rejuvenate the barren desert. This suggests that the barren Mandalore, which, like Jerusalem, sits atop an aquifer, will flow with the Living Waters in this new age.



 The Mythosaur Hints The Prophecy Will Come True 
         




There is a literary principle called Chekhov&#39;s gun which states that all elements in a story must have a purpose. For example, if a writer puts a gun in a room, the gun has to go off by the end of the story. Think of the Mandalorian prophecy as the Chekhov&#39;s gun of this story, as proven when Bo-Katan sees a Mythosaur in the Living Waters in The Mandalorian season 3. Supporting this, Bo-Katan has just been added to Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes - and this confirms Bo-Katan&#39;s new role as the Mand&#39;alor.

At the end of The Mandalorian season 3, the Mandalorians officially took back their homeworld from the Imperial remnant. They were able to bathe in the Living Waters and light the Great Forge for the first time in years. They did this as both a symbol of hope, a return to the Way, and a demonstration of their commitment to restore their ravaged world. This is another indication that the prophecy will come true. Mandalore is beginning a new chapter. With the return of the Mythosaur, the declaration of Bo-Katan as the Mand&#39;alor, and a return to the old ways, the prophecy appears to have already been set in motion.




                  The Mandalorian Purge &amp; Night of 1000 Tears Was Worse Than We Thought   Star Wars finally reveals the Mandalorian Purge committed by the Empire known as the Night of 1000 Tears, and it&#39;s far more tragic than we thought.    



 The Prophecy Has Massive Implications For Mandalorians 
          

One question that remains is how the prophecy came to be. After all, visions of the future are not common occurrences for most people in the Star Wars universe. The only people known to have such visions are those with a strong connection to the Force. This suggests that there could be more Force-sensitives - or even a Force-sensitive bloodline - on Mandalore. This would be interesting because, up until now, it has appeared that Mandalorians are not usually Force-sensitive. If Force-sensitives really did give this prophecy, they may be more prevalent and possibly revered than previously thought. This would change Mandalorian lore.




Another alternative is that Tarre Vizsla gave the prophecy himself. While Sabine Wren is now a Jedi, this came through intense training and perseverance. Huyang, the Jedi Architect Droid, pointed out that Sabine wouldn&#39;t have been accepted into the Jedi Order as her natural aptitude with the Force was too low. Given that very few Mandalorians are confirmed to have become Jedi, likely, Sabine isn&#39;t unique and, even if more Mandalorians have some connection to the Force, it&#39;s a weak one. Since Tarre Vizsla was famous for being a Mandalorian Jedi and inspired much of their religion and mythology, it&#39;s entirely possible that he was the one who had the prophecy.

It will be interesting to see the prophecy fulfilled. Since The Mandalorian movie is set to be a culmination of several shows, including the one it&#39;s named after, the prophecy could be a key plot point. While The Mandalorian season 3 set up the prophecy to be a major part of season 4, it could still be featured in the movie. After all, an important part of the prophecy was the Mand&#39;alor riding a Mythosaur in battle. With the clans united, it&#39;s possible that the foretold battle could be with the Imperial remnant led by Grand Admiral Thrawn.






The Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney&#43;.




             The Mandalorian The Mandalorian is set after the Empire&#39;s fall and before the First Order&#39;s emergence in the ever-growing Star Wars universe. The series follows the travails of a lone gunfighter named Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic. Acting as the first live-action Star Wars series, The Mandalorian has become incredibly popular on Disney&#43;, partly due to Mando’s relationship with Grogu, which the internet dubbed “Baby Yoda” upon his introduction in season 1.
