## Literature Review
Kody Brown&#39;s exes have been indirect about their dislike for Robyn Brown on Sister Wives, but here are some of the worst things they&#39;ve said.




Sister Wives season 18 explores the dynamic between Kody Brown&#39;s exes and Robyn Brown, but Janelle Brown, Meri Brown, and Christine Brown have been sharing their dislike for Robyn for years. While they&#39;re usually indirect, their words bite and Robyn knows precisely who they&#39;re talking about. Robyn may be a master manipulator, but Kody&#39;s ex-wives have seen right through Robyn&#39;s lies from the beginning. Robyn and Kody caused the family&#39;s downfall, a revelation that isn&#39;t lost on Kody&#39;s exes.
Robyn and Kody spiritually married in 2010, around when Sister Wives premiered. Unfortunately, introducing a fourth wife crumbled Kody&#39;s connections with Meri, Janelle, and Christine. While the devolvement of their marriages happened slowly over the next decade, Kody&#39;s first three wives left him within a year, beginning in 2021. During their separations, Meri, Christine, and Janelle said things about Robyn that indicated trouble in paradise. Here are the eight worst.









 








 11  &#34;I felt like I was replaced. I felt like I was the one who was pushed out, and she was the one who came in and took over.&#34; 
Meri Brown, Sister Wives Season 7


 












 10   
Meri&#39;s statement about feeling replaced by Robyn Brown stemmed from a significant shift in Kody&#39;s attention and affection towards Robyn. As Robyn&#39;s role became more prominent, Meri felt marginalized and emotionally neglected. This led to a deep sense of insecurity and inadequacy.
In an episode from Sister Wives season 7, Meri confessed her feelings in a confessional interview. She expressed that Robyn had &#34;taken over&#34; her position in Kody&#39;s life, leaving her feeling like she was &#34;the one who was pushed out.&#34; While not a direct takedown of Robyn, Meri said she blamed Robyn for the breakdown of her marriage early on.





 9  &#34;When Robyn came into the family, it was a different dynamic. It was like she was the only one who had Kody&#39;s attention. It was like, &#39;Oh, he&#39;s always with Robyn.&#39;&#34; 
Janelle Brown, Sister Wives Season 12


 







On Sister Wives season 12, Janelle said, &#34;When Robyn came into the family, it was a different dynamic. It was like she was the only one who had Kody&#39;s attention. It was like, &#39;Oh, he&#39;s always with Robyn.&#39;&#34; This quote has been interpreted as Janelle&#39;s jealousy of Robyn&#39;s relationship with Kody. While neither party has addressed these comments, it&#39;s clear Janelle is attempting to make Robyn look bad by saying that she is manipulative and trying to pit the other wives against each other. Whether this is true or not, this was the outcome.





 8  &#34;Robyn has always been Kody&#39;s favorite.&#34; 
Christine Brown, Sister Wives Season 17


 







Christine is the least likely to mince words when talking about Robyn, especially now that she&#39;s remarried to David Woolley. Before leaving Kody, Christine began saying more pointed things about his newest wife. In season 17, Christine shared in a confessional interview that she felt like a &#34;third wheel&#34; in her marriage to Kody and that she believed he had a &#34;favorite wife.&#34; She specifically mentioned Robyn as the wife she thought Kody favored.





 7  &#34;I felt like I was the last wife on the totem pole.&#34; 
Meri Brown, Sister Wives Season 17
        

While Christine is the most likely wife to attack Robyn directly, Meri is the least likely. However, it&#39;s likely this quote references Robyn as the favorite wife. Before she officially left Kody, Meri shared in Sister Wives season 17 how she felt she was not getting the same level of attention and affection as Kody&#39;s other wives, especially Robyn. She said, &#34;I felt like I was the last wife on the totem pole. Like I was the least important. And that was really hurtful.&#34;





 6  &#34;I don&#39;t feel like Robyn has been fully transparent.&#34; 
Janelle Brown, Sister Wives Season 5
        






 5   
The other wives began to suspect that Robyn was manipulating Kody early on, and Janelle&#39;s quote from Sister Wives season 5 is proof. In the season 5 reunion, Janelle addressed Kody&#39;s newest wife, saying, &#34;I don&#39;t feel like Robyn has been fully transparent.&#34; While not a terrible thing to say, Janelle is less likely to say something pointedly nasty to Robyn, especially early in her marriage to Kody. It indicated that trouble was afoot, and the wives weren&#39;t blind to Robyn&#39;s manipulative nature.





 4  &#34;I felt like I was being made to feel like I didn&#39;t belong.&#34; 
Christine Brown, Sister Wives Season 15
        






 3   
Christine, who has always been the most outspoken against Robyn and, later, Kody, made a heartbreaking confession in Sister Wives season 15. She said, &#34;I felt like I was being made to feel like I didn&#39;t belong,&#34; adding that she had never felt like a &#34;queen wife or queen mom&#34; in the family. Christine also said she felt like she was &#34;the basement wife&#34; and that &#34;nobody even likes me.&#34;
Christine&#39;s comments came after she conversed with Robyn about how she felt about her role in the family. Robyn reassured Christine that she didn&#39;t hate her, but Christine said that she still had doubts about her place in the family. While she reassured her, Christine was right to put Robyn on blast.





 2  &#34;I felt like she was using Kody&#39;s emotions against him.&#34; 
Christine Brown, Sister Wives Season 18
        

As she headed toward divorce from Kody, Christine&#39;s comments about Robyn only got more pointed. In the Sister Wives season 18 episode, Christine discusses her concerns about Kody&#39;s relationship with Robyn. Christine believes Robyn is manipulative and uses Kody&#39;s emotions to get what she wants. Christine says she feels &#34;like she&#39;s just trying to control everything&#34; and is &#34;playing on Kody&#39;s emotions.&#34; It&#39;s a nuanced and biting critique of Robyn&#39;s behavior.





 1  &#34;If Robyn approached me and wanted to be friends, I would&#39;ve not been friends still because I couldn&#39;t trust her.&#34; 
Christine Brown, Sister Wives Season 18
        

In perhaps the nastiest quote, Christine lets her true feelings for Robyn shine. Christine said this in a confessional in Sister Wives. She talked about her relationship with Robyn Brown, whom she had repeatedly called out for being manipulative and controlling. Christine said that even if Robyn had approached her and wanted to be friends, she still wouldn&#39;t have been able to trust her, adding that Robyn had a history of being dishonest and untrustworthy, and that she didn&#39;t believe that Robyn had changed.
Sister Wives season 18 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on TLC. 

               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States.
