# Russell T Davies Reveals The One Scene Disney Requested For Doctor Whos Seasonal Special


## SUMMARY 



  The Christmas special episode of Doctor Who, &#34;The Church on Ruby Road,&#34; included a scene that was specifically requested by Disney to feature Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Doctor earlier.   Disney&#39;s involvement with Doctor Who, including the exclusive streaming rights on Disney&#43;, has already brought an increased budget for the show&#39;s production, allowing for enhancements in sets and visual effects.   While Disney&#39;s creative control over Doctor Who is not extensively clear, they do offer some notes on the show, as evidenced by their request to feature the Doctor earlier in the Christmas special.

## Literature Review
The recent Doctor Who seasonal special featured a scene Disney suggested, according to Russell T Davies, and it made for a positive change.




Current Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies reveals the one scene Disney requested in the recently released seasonal special. Following the release of three episodes to mark and celebrate the Doctor Who 60th anniversary, a new Christmas special was recently released, titled &#34;The Church on Ruby Road.&#34; This special episode featured Fifteenth Doctor Ncuti Gatwa’s main debut after he made a cameo in the third anniversary episode, and he was also joined by Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday, the Doctor’s new companion.




Speaking recently about &#34;The Church on Ruby Road&#34; for Doctor Who: Video Commentaries, the showrunner revealed one of the first scenes in the Christmas special was one that Disney specifically requested to be included. It involved featuring Gatwa&#39;s Doctor far sooner. Read his full quote below:


This was the very last scene to be added. I’ll tell you why – because Disney always test a first episode, and they tested this and people wanted to see the Doctor earlier, as simple as that. They came back with that note, and I was like, “Well, actually, okay. Who doesn’t want to see Ncuti earlier?”



 How Will Disney Influence Doctor Who’s Production? 
          

Despite being one of the longest-running and most popular shows in the world, Doctor Who has been fairly difficult for people outside the UK to access. The show was broadcast by the BBC for UK audiences while it bounced through various streaming platforms in the United States without ever really setting in one place. This, however, changed recently when Disney&#43; struck a deal with Doctor Who, acquiring the exclusive rights to stream future episodes of the show internationally.




While the public is not privy to all the details of this mega deal, one thing that’s for sure is that Disney&#43; joining forces with the BBC would most likely bring a different dimension to the long-running Doctor Who. One of the major changes that’s already evident is Disney bringing in an increased budget, making it possible for the creative team to enhance their sets and visual effects.

  1:48                       Doctor Who Confirms Major Change To 60-Year Tradition After Disney Deal (&amp; It&#39;s Great)   After making a deal with Disney, Doctor Who&#39;s 60th-anniversary special confirms a major change to tradition that will positively impact the series.    

What is less clear is how much creative control Disney has over Doctor Who. From an outside perspective, it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s much. The series remains primarily a BBC production, and Davies&#39; recent tenure has already introduced elements that Disney is famously wary of approaching, such as LGBTQ characters. However, as Davies&#39; above comments confirm, Disney is able to offer some notes on the show, so perhaps the studio&#39;s creative input on things such as the upcoming Doctor Who season 14 is minimal, but not nonexistent.
