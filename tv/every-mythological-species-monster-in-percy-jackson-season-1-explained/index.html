  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Percy Jackson and the Olympians includes many monsters, creatures, species, and races from the world of Greek mythology in its opening season.</p>
<p>Summary
Percy Jackson and the Olympians faithfully adapts the Greek mythology-based creatures and monsters from the original book series, bringing them to life in a fantastic world-building style.
This includes the presence of recognizable creatures like Pegasus, Automatons, Furies, Minotaur, Satyrs, Centaurs, and Wood Nymphs, among others.
As the series progresses, more creatures and monsters from Greek mythology will be introduced, staying true to the beloved book series by Rick Riordan.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson and the Olympians features a plethora of monsters and creatures from Greek mythology, aiding the Disney+ show in its fantastic world-building. The comparisons between the likes of Harry Potter and Percy Jackson have always been prevalent, largely due to the fantastical worlds created in both book series. With Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the world introduced in the first Percy Jackson book - The Lightning Thief - comes to life in style.
Not only does Percy Jackson and the Olympians&rsquo; cast of characters perfectly translate the characters from the original book, but the look, style, and tone of the series allow for a faithful adaptation of the Greek-infused world. One major way in which this is done is through the creatures and monsters involved in the show, from Percy Jackson&rsquo;s pantheon of Greek gods to the mythology-based monsters found throughout the Disney+ adaptation. As the series goes on, the list of monsters and creatures from Greek mythology will only grow as Percy Jackson and the Olympians adapts more elements of Rick Riordan&rsquo;s beloved book series.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson Show Reviews Are In
Critics share their thoughts on the Disney+ show Percy Jackson and the Olympians one week ahead of its premiere on the streaming service.</p>
<p>16  The Pegasus
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 - “I Accidentally Vaporise My Pre-Algebra Teacher”</p>
<p>The first hint for both the titular character and the audience that the world of Percy Jackson involves the creatures of Greek mythology is provided by the spotting of a Pegasus. During the opening of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1, Percy recounts the times throughout his childhood when he spotted hints that he was a half-blood. The first of these is when Percy is fairly young and is lured to the roof of his school by a mysterious creature. The creature can be spotted across the street on an adjacent roof: a black, winged horse.
This creature is a Pegasus, perhaps one of the most recognizable creatures from Greek mythology. While Greek myths have naturally changed over the years, the common origin of the Pegasus is that it was a creature sired by Poseidon, the god of the sea, and Medusa. In original Greek mythology, the Pegasus was a singular being, though Percy Jackson and the Olympians makes the creature its own race, from the Pegasus&rsquo; out in the wild to the ones kept at Camp Half-Blood for use by demigods.</p>
<p>15  A Rhino Automaton
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 - “I Accidentally Vaporise My Pre-Algebra Teacher”</p>
<p>Another of the creatures Percy spots at a young age in Percy Jackson and the Olympians is an automaton. In Greek mythology, Automatons were automated beings crafted out of stone, wood, or metal that could perform set tasks for the gods or other creators. Gods like Hephaestus or inventors like Daedalus were two of the mythological beings said to have created Automatons, with this type of creature being adapted into the Percy Jackson books.
Given the incredible fidelity Percy Jackson and the Olympians shows to its source material, the Automatons make an appearance in the show too. Shortly after spotting the Pegasus in episode 1, another time in Percy&rsquo;s childhood is shown. Percy is sitting in class, staring out the window at a giant, mechanical rhino trudging down a bustling New York street. The Mist - the magical veil that separates the mythological and human worlds - soon makes Percy think it is a garbage truck, but the Automatons are real and will return in a future role that is vital to subsequent Percy Jackson and the Olympians stories.</p>
<p>14  The Fury - Alecto
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 - “I Accidentally Vaporise My Pre-Algebra Teacher”</p>
<p>While Percy&rsquo;s encounters with Pegasus and Automatons are shown in a montage, the first true monster Percy faces is one of the most powerful in Greek mythology - a Fury. In Greek mythology, three Furies worked to punish humanity for various sins such as murder. Percy Jackson and the Olympians takes this concept and makes the Furies enforcers of the Underworld, the realm in which bad people are sent to undergo eternal damnation after death. In Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1, Percy encounters one of the three Furies - Alecto.
Alecto is initially disguised as Mrs. Dodds, Percy&rsquo;s pre-algebra teacher. After Percy unwittingly showcases his demigod powers by using water to push a school bully into a fountain, Alecto reveals herself. Mrs. Dodds grows the leathery wings and bird-like features of a Fury, asking Percy where a specific object is that is unknown to Percy or the audience. Percy instinctively destroys her using a sword given to him by Mr. Brunner before passing out, waking to think the attack was a dream. The Furies remain a constant threat throughout Percy Jackson’s five books, meaning the same for Disney’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians.</p>
<p>13  The Minotaur
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 - “I Accidentally Vaporise My Pre-Algebra Teacher”</p>
<p>Another of the more powerful monsters encountered by Percy early in his journey is the Minotaur. The Minotaur is sent to attack Percy after the truth about his half-blood nature is revealed to him. As he, his mother Sally, and his friend Grover are traveling to Camp Half-Blood, their car is attacked by the Minotaur before the creature sends Percy&rsquo;s mother to the Underworld. Overcome by rage, Percy uses his sword to chop off the Minotaur&rsquo;s horn before using the appendage to kill the monster.
In Greek mythology, the Minotaur was said to be a monster that was half man and half bull. While his body was distinctly human, the Minotaur had the head of a bull down to the studded snout and curling horns. The creature was the guardian of the Labrinth in Greek myth, dwelling at the center of the giant maze before being killed by the hero Theseus. As the second monster of note Percy defeats in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the Minotaur continues to play a role in the book series as will likely be the same for the Disney adaptation.</p>
<p>12  Satyrs
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 - “I Accidentally Vaporise My Pre-Algebra Teacher”</p>
<p>Like the Pegasus, Satyrs are some of the more benevolent creatures of Greek mythology in Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The first Satyr seen is actually Grover, Percy&rsquo;s best friend. In the world of Percy Jackson, younger Satyrs work as Protectors meaning they go out into the human world to scout for potential half-bloods. Upon half-bloods finding out their true nature, Protectors are tasked with escorting these children to Camp Half-Blood for safeguarding and training. As such, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 reveals that Grover is Percy&rsquo;s Protector.
Satyrs have a unique design in Greek mythology as they are half man and half goat. While Greek myth goes back and forth on whether they had goat or human legs, Satyrs have always been depicted with goat horns and tails. Percy Jackson and the Olympians shows Satyrs as having goat legs, while their top half is human besides the horns at the top of their heads. Satyrs are rarely depicted with any grace in Greek mythology, often shown to be lovers of ribald humor and being a detriment to ancient Greek society.
Percy Jackson and the Olympians changes this, making Satyrs one of the more important creatures in the fantastical world. From their role as Protectors to ulterior motives as Searchers as revealed in Percy Jackson episode 4, Satyrs are incredibly vital to the survival of half-bloods and the upkeep of nature in modern America. This is spearheaded in Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Grover, one of the three main characters of the series.</p>
<p>11  Centaurs
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2 - “I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom”</p>
<p>Like Satyrs and Minotaurs, Centaurs are Greek mythological creatures that represent a human-animal hybrid. Centaurs are half human and half horse, depicted as having the torso and head of a man with the body and legs of a horse. Centaurs were primarily depicted as being as wild as natural horses in Greek mythology, roaming the lands in herds. However, one Centaur in Greek myth was depicted as much more calm, stoic, and helpful than his brethren: Chiron.
In Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Chrion is the first Centaur encountered by Percy and is none other than Mr. Brunner, his Latin teacher from Yancy Academy. Chiron takes inspiration from the Greek figure of the same name, acting as a mentor to the heroes of Camp Half-Blood. Just as the Chiron from real-world Greek myth helped to train famous ancient heroes like Achilles and Jason, Percy Jackson&rsquo;s Chiron supports those at Camp Half-Blood and molds them into heroes capable of traversing the dangerous world of Greek gods and monsters alone.</p>
<p>10  Dionysus - The Greek God Of Wine &amp; Festivities
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2 - “I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom”</p>
<p>One of the other sentient mythological species found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians are the titular gods themselves. The first god introduced in the show is Mr. D/Dionysus, the director of Camp Half-Blood. Dionysus was punished by Zeus at some point between ancient times and the events of Percy Jackson, sentenced to begrudgingly run Camp Half-Blood while being banned from drinking alcohol. Dionysus does not play a major role in Percy Jackson episodes 1 and 2 but will continue to be a presence going forward.</p>
<p>9  Wood Nymph/Dryad
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2 - “I Become Supreme Lord of the Bathroom”</p>
<p>Upon Percy&rsquo;s arrival at Camp Half-Blood, several other creatures from the world of Percy Jackson and the Olympians are shown. One of these is a Wood Nymph, also known as a Dryad. A Dryad is encountered by Grover at Camp Half-Blood as the Satyr convenes with the Cloven Council. In Greek mythology, Nymphs are minor nature deities who represent specific aspects of nature. Concerning Dryads, this type of Nymph represents the spirit of trees. Oftentimes Dryads were depicted as being tied to the life force of a specific tree inhabiting sacred groves of the gods, such as Percy Jackson and the Olympians&rsquo; Cloven Council.</p>
<p>8  Medusa - One Of The Three Ancient Greek Gorgons
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, &ldquo;We Visit the Garden Gnome Emporium&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the ancient Greek monsters introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3 is Medusa. Medusa is a Gorgon, a woman who was cursed by Athena to have snakes for hair that turn people to stone if they look upon her. Percy Jackson episode 3 explains that this was a cruel stroke of injustice from the gods, as Medusa was selfishly used by Poseidon. Athena punished Medusa for Poseidon&rsquo;s cruel ways, making the latter a more sympathetic character than many first thought. Medusa was killed by Percy after she began to view the latter as similar to his father, wishing to take vengeance on the god of the sea.</p>
<p>5 Changes Percy Jackson Episode 3 Makes To Medusa&rsquo;s Book Story &amp; Real Myth
Percy Jackson episode 3 makes a handful of changes to Medusa’s story from both the original Lightning Thief book and the real Greek myths.</p>
<p>7  Hermes - The Greek God Of Travelers &amp; Messengers
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, &ldquo;We Visit the Garden Gnome Emporium&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, the second Greek god of the series is introduced: Hermes. Hermes is played by Lin-Manuel Miranda and is the father of Luke Castellan, shown delivering the head of Medusa to Mount Olympus after Percy mailed it to the gods as an act of both tribute and defiance. Hermes&rsquo; role is only brief, yet his lackey nature is highlighted as he is a glorified postman for the Olympian gods. Hermes will appear more as Percy Jackson and the Olympians continues, as will several other Greek gods, monsters, and creatures.
Based on pre-released material, Hermes is expected to appear in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6, &ldquo;We Take a Zebra to Vegas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6  Echidna - The Mother Of Monsters
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4, &ldquo;I Plunge to My Death&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the lady reveals herself to be much more sinister in nature, with Echidna wanting to test one of her children against the demigods Percy and Annabeth and their Satyr companion Grover.</p>
<p>One of the primary antagonists of Percy Jackson episode 4 is Echidna. In Greek mythology, Echidna is known as the mother of some of the most dangerous monsters in history after siring them with her husband Typhon, another fearsome beast. The character of Echidna in Percy Jackson appears as a seemingly normal lady played by Suzanne Cryer. However, the lady reveals herself to be much more sinister in nature, with Echidna wanting to test one of her children against the demigods Percy and Annabeth and their Satyr companion Grover. As of the end of Percy Jackson episode 4, Echidna’s fate is left unknown, as is that of her monstrous child.</p>
<p>5  The Chimera
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4, &ldquo;I Plunge to My Death&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monstrous child of Echidna who also serves as an antagonist in Percy Jackson episode 4 is the Chimera. In ancient Greek mythology, the Chimera was a hybrid between a lion, a goat, and a dragon. The front legs and head of the Chimera were a lion, while the back legs and tail resembled a goat and dragon respectively. In the original myth, the Chimera was said to sprout a goat head from the lion&rsquo;s neck, making the creature incredibly horrific to look at.
In Percy Jackson episode 4, the Chimera&rsquo;s appearance is simplified somewhat. The Chimera still has the front half of a lion and the back half of a goat with a dragon&rsquo;s tail though it is without the goat&rsquo;s head sprouting from its neck. Instead, the Chimera in Percy Jackson and the Olympians has goat horns atop its head. The creature stalks Annabeth, Percy, and Grover to the top of the St. Louis Gateway Arch before forcing Percy to fall into the Mississippi River below, leaving its fate uncertain.</p>
<p>4  Water Nymph/Nereid
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4, &ldquo;I Plunge to My Death&rdquo; Just as the Dryads from Percy Jackson episode 2 were minor goddesses of nature, Percy Jackson episode 4 introduces Nereids/water Nymphs, minor ocean goddesses. After Percy falls from the St. Louis Arch, the water from the river below rushes up to protect him. Percy awakens beneath the river only to be encountered by a Nereid who explains she is one of Poseidon&rsquo;s messengers. The Nereid calms Percy, allowing him to unlock his ability to breathe underwater, before telling him that his father does care for him and setting the stage for future water-based meetings in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1&rsquo;s remaining episodes.</p>
<p>3  The Three Fates
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5, &ldquo;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 includes the Fates of Greek mythology. In the original book, the Fates are spotted by Percy after his initial fight with Alecto at the museum field trip where they snip a line of thread, indicating the death of an important demigod. In Percy Jackson episode 5, however, the Fates are spotted by Annabeth after the battle with the Chimera at the St. Louis Gateway Arch. The Fates snip a line of yarn while looking at Annabeth in the Disney+ series, serving the same purpose as the book and foreshadowing death on the horizon.</p>
<p>2  Ares - The Greek God Of War
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5, &ldquo;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers&rdquo;</p>
<p>Percy Jackson episode 5 introduces Ares to the show, the titular god in &ldquo;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers.&rdquo; Ares appears as Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are hitchhiking outside of St. Louis and offers them help with their quest in return for an errand. After completing this errand, that being finding Ares&rsquo; shield, the god of war gives the trio supplies and sends them on their way to Las Vegas where Hermes can aid them further. Ares will continue to play a part in Percy Jackson season 1, as well as future seasons of the show should they be greenlit.
The positive updates from Rick Riordan make it likely that Percy Jackson season 2 will be confirmed soon in which Ares&rsquo; impact will be felt as Clarisse La Rue, the god of war&rsquo;s daughter, will have a larger role.</p>
<p>1  Hephaestus - The Greek God Of Fire &amp; Smithing
First seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5, &ldquo;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ares is not the only god introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 as Hephaestus makes a brief cameo. Hephaestus is revealed as the one who has taken Ares&rsquo; shield due to the god of war&rsquo;s affair with Aphrodite, Hephaestus&rsquo; wife and the goddess of love. Hephaestus appears when Percy is trapped in the golden throne and Annabeth recovers the shield, taking pity on her after she states she wishes to be better than the backstabbing, deceitful gods like Percy. Hephaestus states he will put in a good word with Athena, Annabeth&rsquo;s mother, promising big things for Percy Jackson and the Olympians &rsquo; remaining episodes.
New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians release every Tuesday on Disney+.</p>
