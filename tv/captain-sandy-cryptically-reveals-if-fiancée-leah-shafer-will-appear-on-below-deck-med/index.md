The boat captain and her partner have already picked out a wedding date for February of next year. February holds a special meaning for Captain Sandy since it’s also her birthday month.

Captain Sandy, 58, met Leah, 50 on Facebook in 2018. A gospel singer and aesthetician from Denver, Colorado, Leah had reached out to Captain Sandy as she was a fan of the show. She had sent the reality TV star a sweet message which said, “I came across your show, congratulations, many blessings.” The two decided to meet in person in Los Angeles after exchanging a few messages, and Captain Sandy knew Leah was the one the first time they hugged. The dreamy proposal took place on an island somewhere in the Mediterranean. Captain Sandy took Leah on a boat ride and took her to a beautiful cove for a small date.
