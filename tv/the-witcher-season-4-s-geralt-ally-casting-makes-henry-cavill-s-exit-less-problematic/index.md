Summary

  Laurence Fishburne&#39;s addition as the character Regis brings star power and hope for The Witcher&#39;s future.

Netflix&#39;s The Witcher has had a rocky recent history with the announcement that star Henry Cavill would leave his role as Geralt of Rivia, but a new addition to the cast could soften the blow of his departure. The show is an adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s series of novels, but The Witcher made considerable changes to the characters in the books. The Witcher losing its lead is worrying, but a new star actor being added to the cast makes the future look hopeful.

Geralt made many friends and allies throughout his adventures, and one of his most powerful connections was with Regis, the higher vampire. Laurence Fishburne will play Regis in The Witcher season 4, a move that adds a beloved character and much-needed star power to the show. The Witcher season 3 was a low point for the series, but Fishburne&#39;s addition could add the breath of fresh air the show desperately needs.

                  The Witcher Season 4: New Geralt, Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   The Witcher Season 4 has some major casting changes, but most of the actors will be returning for the next entry in Geralt of Rivia&#39;s story.    





 Laurence Fishburne&#39;s Regis Makes Henry Cavill&#39;s Witcher Exit Easier To Take 
          

Cavill&#39;s depiction of Geralt was one of the highlights of The Witcher, and his departure from the show will be felt in season 4. However, Fishburne&#39;s rendition of Regis is sure to be stellar, and he could redeem the next season with his vampire portrayal. The character of Regis in Sapkowski&#39;s novels is extremely intelligent, with a strong base of knowledge in a wide variety of fields and a centuries-long life in which to study them. Fishburne is a great pick to depict Regis&#39; refined and studious demeanor. Regis is also a recovering addict, as drinking blood has an intoxicating effect on him, and Fishburne has the acting skills required to show the nuances of his self-control. Fishburne&#39;s role on the show could be able to fill the void left by Geralt&#39;s recasting.






 What Regis In Netflix&#39;s The Witcher Means For Season 4&#39;s Story 
          

The Witcher season 3 finale left Ciri on a dangerous cliffhanger after her time in the Korath desert and the introduction of the Rats. Season 4 will likely see Geralt on a new mission to reunite with her, though the path to finding her will not be easy. Regis could serve as the key to finding Ciri, as his wealth of obscure knowledge and vampire abilities will surely come in handy. Vilgefortz will also return in the new season, and a deadly confrontation seems likely, given he killed Regis in the books. While there is no guarantee that Fishburne&#39;s character will follow the same storyline, Regis is sure to be an integral player in the coming conflicts.

The Witcher faced several problems after the announcement of Henry Cavill leaving the role of Geralt. Laurence Fishburne&#39;s casting as the vampire Regis is a promising development for season 4, and it could give fans hope for a quality improvement. How the show handles Geralt&#39;s recasting and the details of Regis&#39; story remain to be seen, but it is a positive addition at a crucial moment for the series.
