## Literature Review
Selling Sunset season 7 saw the Oppenheim Group agents struggling in the difficult real estate market, especially with Los Angeles&#39; new Mansion Tax.




Selling Sunset season 7 may have had some jaw-dropping luxury real estate on display, but the Oppenheim Group agents explained that the new Los Angeles Mansion tax has been making selling even more difficult than usual. Throughout the run of Selling Sunset, the real estate has always taken a backseat to the drama between the agents at the O Group, but it&#39;s always been incredibly present on the series. From walk-throughs at incredible properties with listing agents to brokers&#39; opens that invite some of the most elite agents into a beautiful home, the agents of Selling Sunset have always been open about the expensive spaces they work hard to sell.




While selling real estate anywhere can be difficult in a tough market, selling luxury real estate in Los Angeles is particularly difficult. During Selling Sunset season 7, the O Group agents began to feel the impact of the economic situation in the US. The strain on their sales in the last year has been palpable for the agents at the Oppenheim Group. During the most recent season, the agents struggled to sell their properties. While the agents were doing their best to sell as much as they could, the Los Angeles Mansion Tax made things tricky to navigate successfully.


 What Is A Mansion Tax Anyway? (Selling Sunset Agents Are Worried About It) 
          

The Mansion Tax that&#39;s making waves on Selling Sunset season 7, also known as Measure ULA, passed in November 2022. According to Dwell, &#34;applies a transfer tax on properties over $5 million in the city of Los Angeles&#34; meaning that &#34;properties going to be sold over $5 million are going to have an additional 4 percent tax, and anything over $10 million is now $5.25 million additional tax.&#34; The Oppenheim Group agents had valid reasons to worry about the tax, as it required them to shuffle around their sales in a way that was tricky for the agents and sellers, navigating a new law that changed everything about their finances.






 Will The Mansion Tax End Selling Sunset? 

 

Although the Mansion Tax has been a difficult strain on the real estate industry in Los Angeles, it has impacted the agents at the Oppenheim Group more publicly than others. While the Selling Sunset season 7 cast kept the Mansion Tax in mind, it cropped up several times throughout the season as something they needed to consider. Making deals more difficult, the agents had to consider several factors before deciding where they could price real estate, and how to communicate the issues in pricing to clients. Despite the Mansion Tax making things difficult, the real estate industry taking a hit won&#39;t end Selling Sunset on its own.



 Is The Mansion Tax Fair? 
          




While the Mansion Tax may be difficult for the agents of Selling Sunset to work around, it&#39;s fair for the community at large. With so many pricey homes in Los Angeles, the Mansion Tax provides a way for wealthy homeowners to have to pay their fair share. In purchasing homes that are tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, those who are eligible to have to pay the Mansion Tax may not be happy about it. To those who the tax will benefit in the long run, the tax is worth the trouble for Selling Sunset&#39;s agents and the rest of Los Angeles real estate to have to deal with.
