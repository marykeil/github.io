# The Witcher s 10 Most Important Book Characters Still Missing From The Show


## SUMMARY 


 The Witcher season 4 could benefit from the introduction of important characters like Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, a powerful vampire ally to Geralt. 
 Stefan Skellen and Vattier de Rideaux are two complex villains from the book series that should be included in The Witcher season 4 to add depth to the antagonists. 
 The inclusion of characters like Leo Bonhart, Avallac&#39;h, Zoltan Chivay, Esterad Thyssen, Assire Var Anahid, Isengrim Faoiltiarna, and Schirru would enhance the overall story and offer interesting dynamics in The Witcher TV series.

## Literature Review
Netflix&#39;s The Witcher has introduced a fair number of characters from Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s novels, but 10 major figures remain conspicuously absent.




The Witcher has introduced a lot of important characters from Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s novel series, but 10 huge characters are still missing from the Netflix show&#39;s continuity. The Witcher remains one of Netflix&#39;s biggest fantasy series, despite falling upon hard times recently. The show has been lambasted for changes made to the source material, but by the end of The Witcher season 3, its level of fidelity has been ramped up in certain areas.
While it still may not be exactly what fans of The Witcher book series had hoped for, the show has certainly shown more interest in following the main beats of the novels&#39; story. It has also done well to add a steady stream of new book characters to each season, providing some hope that The Witcher season 4 will adapt more of Sapkowski&#39;s beloved characters. Of these missing characters, 10 stand out as the most important or intriguing figures from the books that should be included before the series concludes.
            
 
 Netflix&#39;s The Witcher Cast &amp; Character Guide 
Netflix&#39;s fantasy series The Witcher stars Henry Cavill as a skilled monster slayer. Here&#39;s our guide to the show&#39;s cast and characters.













 








 10  Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy — Higher Vampire 
Ally to Geralt
        

Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, better known as Regis, is one of the most intelligent and powerful characters in the entire Witcher series. The Witcher season 4 will face some challenges, but the introduction of such a great character could help alleviate some of the pressure on this floundering franchise. Regis is a higher vampire, making him nearly immortal and capable of incredible feats of speed and strength. He is also over 400 years old and probably the most knowledgeable character in the series. Though he is passive by nature, Regis is a force to be reckoned with when roused.





 9  Stefan Skellen — Imperial Coroner 
Member of the Imperial Secret Service


 







Often referred to as Tawny Owl, Stefan Skellen is a Nilfgaardian coroner and a high ranking member of the Imperial Secret Service. Skellen is one of the most nuanced villains The Witcher has to offer, making it critical for season four to include him. Indeed, it&#39;s likely he will appear in The Witcher season 4 because he is tasked with finding Ciri around this time in the book series. As fans will find out, however, Stefan Skellen has his own plans for the Child of the Elder Blood, and he may not be as trustworthy as Imperator Emhyr believes.





 8  Vattier De Rideaux — Viscount Of Eiddon 
Nilfgaardian Spymaster and Head of Military Intelligence
        

Vattier de Rideaux is another layered villain from the book series with a chance to become one of the best characters in The Witcher. Rideaux is the Head of Military Intelligence for Nilfgaard and one of Imperator Emhyr&#39;s most trusted advisors. Rideaux is intelligent and ruthless, and he is an integral part of Emhyr&#39;s war with the northern kingdoms. He also runs a massive network of spies, perhaps even larger than that of Sigismund Dijkstra, Redania&#39;s spymaster. If introduced to the show, Rideaux could provide much-needed depth to the current roster of Nilfgaardian antagonists.





 7  Leo Bonhart — Bounty Hunter 
One of the greatest swordsmen alive


 







Leo Bonhart is one of the most terrifying villains in The Witcher universe, and he is extremely likely to appear in season 4. Bonhart is an uncanny swordsman, which he proves by displaying the three witcher medallions he took from the corpses of his victims. Anyone powerful enough to overcome the mutated strength and speed of a witcher is not to be trifled with. Sword-skill aside, Bonhart is also cruel and utterly sadistic, as Ciri will soon find out. The Witcher season 4 is expected to include at least part of Ciri&#39;s captivity at his hands, thereby introducing the terrible force that is Leo Bonhart.





 6  Avallac&#39;h — Elven Mage 
Capable of interdimensional travel in the books


 







While Avallac&#39;h has been introduced in The Witcher&#39;s prequel miniseries, Blood Origin, he has yet to make an appearance in the main series. Avallac&#39;h plays a massive role in the book series, but with the story changes made by the show, it&#39;s difficult to know how closely his role will mirror the books. Even so, his introduction in the prequel all but confirms that he will be part of the main series. It&#39;s also safe to assume that he will be a vastly different character in the main series, considering roughly 1,200 years have passed since his appearance in Blood Origin.





 5  Zoltan Chivay — Dwarven Soldier 
Ally to Geralt and Ciri
        

Zoltan Chivay is a dwarf from the mountains of Mahakam, and he becomes a loyal companion to Geralt when they meet on the road by chance. Though they only travel together for a time, Zoltan and Geralt develop a strong mutual respect, which results in Zoltan gifting Geralt his sihil — an incredibly sharp and durable dwarven sword made in the forges of Mahakam. Unfortunately, Zoltan has yet to appear in The Witcher, but there is still hope that Geralt and his companions will run into him during their hunt for Ciri.





 4  Esterad Thyssen — King Of Kovir And Poviss 
One of the most respected and powerful monarchs of the north
        

Esterad Thyssen is the King of Kovir and Poviss, and though his time on-page is limited in Sapkowski&#39;s novels, he certainly leaves his mark, both on the reader and the story. Thyssen is a shrewd and respectable man with far more honor and dignity than the typical northern king. Though Kovir mostly stays out of the war with Nilfgaard, Thyssen cleverly provides financial support to the northern cause without Nilfgaard finding out. He is a uniquely likable character, worthy of an expanded role in the TV series should it opt to include him.





 3  Assire Var Anahid — Nilfgaardian Mage 
Founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses
        

One of the most influential mages yet to be introduced in The Witcher is Assire var Anahid. Assire is a notably powerful sorceress, and she is a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Though she is bound to Nilfgaard and obeys Emhyr, her participation in the secretive Lodge proves that she is willing to work with her adversaries for the greater good. Assire&#39;s role in the novels is critical, though it is relatively subtle, so it would be easy for the show to replace her with a preexisting character. As things stand, it seems entirely possible that Fringilla will end up usurping Assire&#39;s most crucial contributions to the story.

 2  Isengrim Faoiltiarna — Scoia&#39;tael 
Later promoted to Colonel in the Nilfgaardian Army
        

Isengrim Faoiltiarna, also known as the Iron Wolf, is an influential member of the Scoia&#39;tael and an ally of Emhyr var Emreis. Isengrim is responsible for planning the coup on Thanned, and though The Witcher did not include him in its adaptation of the coup, it&#39;s still possible Isengrim will appear in future seasons of the show. He remains a relevant character far beyond the events on Thanned, eventually rising to a position of command in the Nilfgaardian Army. He is one of the most dangerous villains in the books, so it would be beneficial to The Witcher if he were added to the cast.





 1  Schirrú — Assassin 
Servant to Vilgefortz
        

Schirrú is a half-elf assassin in the employ of Vilgefortz, and though he has not yet appeared in The Witcher, the death of Rience in season 3 opens the door for his arrival. Schirrú could easily be used to replace Rience as Vilgefortz&#39;s most prominent agent, taking on the grimy tasks that Vilgefortz deems below him. Schirrú is by no means an essential character, but with both Rience and Lydia van Bredevoort dying in season 3, someone will have to fill in as Vilgefortz&#39;s main henchman.
