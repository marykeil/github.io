## Literature Review
The Traitors UK season 2 recently began, but the reality series is already looking for devious, diabolical players to participate in season 3.




The Traitors UK season 2 may just be getting started, but host Claudie Winkleman is already hopeful that the next season of the series will have an interesting cast, urging fans to apply. With The Traitors UK being one of the most successful reality TV competition series of 2023, there were likely a lot of fans who wanted to be able to compete themselves. While some of The Traitors UK season 2 cast members were massive fans of the series, others were a bit more casual about their enjoyment of the show. With a group of fans playing the game, there’s even more strategy at play.




In a post from Studio Lambert, The Traitors UK’s production company, host Claudia shared that casting for The Traitors UK season 3 is now open. “Will you take #TheTraitors oath? Apply for The Traitors Series Three [here],” the post explained before providing a link, along with a video of Claudia.


 

“Well, good evening,” Claudia said in the video, seemingly speaking directly to one of the next traitors. “You stand before the Traitors’ Turret. Before I give you this cloak, I need you to take the Traitors’ oath. Ready?” After sharing the oath, Claudia wryly explained, “You are now officially a Traitor. Happy murdering.” The deadline for the application to appear in The Traitors UK season 3 cast is February 11, 2024.





 The Traitors UK Season 2 Explained 
          

While The Traitors UK season 2 hasn’t been on for long, it has been full of twists and turns. As the game began, the brand-new team of traitors was selected and were tasked with selecting a fourth traitor to join their group. After Paul Gorton, Ash Bibi, and Harry Clark were chosen as the initial traitors, they discussed the potential options on who they could bring into the turret with them. Ultimately, they chose to bring Miles Asteri into their group, making him the fourth traitor before they chose who their first victim would be. The group murdered Aubrey Emerson, effectively ending his time on The Traitors UK season 2.

After Aubrey’s murder, the group reconvened and worked through a challenge, then went to the first round table, where they knew they would have to banish the person the group concluded was a traitor, whether they were right or wrong. At the intense round table discussion, the group worked through several different scenarios about who they were comfortable banishing. While The Traitors UK season 2 has been a fun ride thus far, the faithful have yet to catch one of the traitors. During the first banishment, they got rid of Sonja Clarke, who was an incredibly intelligent faithful. The group was shocked to find out Kyra Johnson was the second victim.




With The Traitors UK season 2 off to an exciting start, the option to appear in The Traitors UK season 3 could be a life-changing decision. With the casting process moving forward, it’s clear that another season of the deceptive series will be produced and host Claudia should be part of the series moving forward. While there’s not much information yet about a potential Traitors UK season 3, those who are interested in trying their hand at the game should be sure to apply.

The Traitors UK season 2 airs Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 9 p.m. UK time on BBC One.
