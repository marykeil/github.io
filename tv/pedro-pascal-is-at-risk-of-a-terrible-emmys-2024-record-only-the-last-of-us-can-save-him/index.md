## Literature Review
Pedro Pascal&#39;s Emmy nominations haven&#39;t gone to plan so far, but his role as Joel Miler in The Last For Us could be the salvation he&#39;s looking for.




Pedro Pascal has been enjoying an especially active patch in his acting career of late, but his role as Joel Miller in The Last of Us represents a bigger lifeline than expected. Despite his numerous recent roles, Pascal has yet to be awarded an Emmy in any category. However, his hopes of winning remain alive due to filling a vital role as part of The Last of Us cast.




Pascal first rose to prominence due to his role as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones season 4 in 2014. Since then, he&#39;s gone on to star in equally prominent franchises, such as the Star Wars spinoff show, The Mandalorian. Pascal&#39;s distinctive voice has also led to narration work, providing a voice-over for the 2022 documentary series, Patagonia. For all of his recent successes, Pedro Pascal&#39;s role as Joel in The Last of Us is his last chance to avoid missing out at the Emmys 2024.

                  The 10 Best Pedro Pascal Movies And TV Shows Ranked   Since Game of Thrones, Pedro Pascal movies and TV shows have been at the forefront of popular culture; here is the best of the talented actor&#39;s roles.    


 Pedro Pascal Has Already Lost In 2/3 Emmys 2024 Categories 
There&#39;s still a chance Pascal could win an Emmy for The Last of Us
          

Pascal started the year with three chances of winning an Emmy, but two of those chances have already passed him by. Pedro Pascal hasn&#39;t had major award success, but the actor received two Creative Arts Emmy Awards nominations last year. Although The Last of Us as a show received the most nominations, none of them were specifically for Pascal. Instead, he was put forward for &#34;Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series&#34; for hosting Saturday Night Live.




Additionally, Pascal received a nomination in the category of &#34;Outstanding Narrator&#34; for his work on Patagonia. Both awards went to figures other than Pascal. Ted Lasso&#39;s Sam Richardson snagged the &#34;Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series&#34; award, and Barack Obama earned the Emmy for &#34;Outstanding Narrator&#34; for his involvement in Working: What We Do All Day.



 Will Pedro Pascal Win An Emmy For The Last Of Us? 
His victory is not a sure thing
         

Pascal&#39;s chances of winning an Emmy in 2024 are not completely gone, as the Prime Time Emmys still present him with the chance of victory. The ceremony, set to start on January 15, could end with Pascal&#39;s first Emmy. Nominated for &#34;Actor in a Drama Series,&#34; The Last of Us&#39; co-lead has been recognized for his stellar performance as Joel Miller. However, Pascal is up against some stiff competition in the category.




                  Every Pedro Pascal Movie Ranked   Pedro Pascal is mostly known for his small-screen roles in some of the biggest TV franchises, but his movie career is also full of excellent credits.    

As well as going up against Better Caul Saul&#39;s Bob Odenkirk, Pascal is also competing with Jeff Bridges for his work in The Old Man, and a total of four members from the Succession season 4 cast. While Pascal&#39;s performance in The Last of Us is undeniably impressive, the crowded category reduces his chance of a runaway victory. As such, Pedro Pascal stands a chance of missing out on all three of the awards for which he was nominated, unless The Last of Us can prevent a trio of defeats.



The Last of Us season 1 is available to stream on Max. The Last of Us season 2 has been confirmed, but there is currently no official release date.




  The Last Of Us   Release Date   January 15, 2023    Cast   Pedro Pascal , Bella Ramsey , Gabriel Luna , Anna Torv , Merle Dandridge , Nick Offerman , Jeffrey Pierce    Genres   Drama , Horror , Adventure    Seasons   1
