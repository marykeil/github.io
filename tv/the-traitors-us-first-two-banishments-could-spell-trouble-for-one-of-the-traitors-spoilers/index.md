Summary

  On The Traitors US season 2, the faithfuls were wrong about Peppermint and Maks Chmerkovskiy being traitors, and now they&#39;re shifting their focus. They could potentially banish Dan Gheesling.   Deontay Wilder, who mistakenly banished Maks, will likely stay quiet or switch his focus to Dan in the next round table.   Larsa Pippen and MJ Javid suspect Dan as a traitor and might take the lead in accusing him, as the faithfuls are determined not to make the same mistake again.  







The Traitors US season 2 has already had two banishments, and the events that unfolded as a result of them could expose Dan Gheesling as one of the traitors. On the premiere episode, host Alan Cumming chose Dan and Phaedra Parks to be the first two traitors. They then recruited Parvati Shallow, completing their trio. They&#39;ve already shockingly murdered Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio and Marcus Jordan, leaving the remaining 16 faithfuls scrambling to figure out who they are. Throughout The Traitors US season 2 so far, the faithfuls have had two banishments, and they were wrong both times.

At the first Traitors US season 2 round table, they banished Peppermint, who&#39;d had a confrontation with Trishelle Canatella that some of the contestants found suspicious. The second banishment was Maks Chmerkovskiy, who was eliminated from the competition after his friend, Deontay Wilder, pointed out what he thought was Maks&#39; suspicious behavior after Marcus&#39; murder. However, both Peppermint and Maks were faithfuls. At the second round table, Larsa Pippen and MJ Javid voted Dan as a traitor, and, if he&#39;s not careful, they could turn everyone against him at the next round table. Dan could be in trouble at the next banishment for the following reasons.

 The Faithfuls Were Wrong About Peppermint &amp; Maks Chmerkovskiy Being Traitors 

 

Because the faithfuls were wrong about Peppermint and Maks being traitors, they&#39;re beginning to realize that they&#39;re focusing on the wrong things at the banishments. They are ready to shift their focus, and this could be a big problem for Dan. While Phaedra and Parvati&#39;s names have never been mentioned at the round table discussions, Dan is now on Larsa and MJ&#39;s radar. If nothing changes, they&#39;ll most certainly vote to banish him again, and now others might vote with them in order to make a new start in the game.




Larsa and MJ have now spoken publicly about how they think Dan&#39;s quiet personality is actually a mask hiding his murderous identity as a traitor. They won&#39;t want to make the mistake of banishing another faithful at the next round table. With their strong personalities, they could now take the lead and convince everyone else to banish Dan. Larsa wants revenge for the murder of her boyfriend Marcus, so, if she truly suspects Dan is a traitor, she could now continue to push her theory and persuade people to vote with her.



 Deontay Wilder Will Most Likely Take A Step Back Because He&#39;s Upset About Mistakenly Banishing Two Faithfuls 
          

Deontay Wilder was devastated and crying after he led the charge against Maks at the last round table and was later proven wrong when Maks revealed that he was actually a faithful. He spoke about how Maks changed from the first time he met him. He added that Maks&#39; reaction to Marcus&#39; murder seemed fake to him, and he thought it was bad acting, as though he already knew that Marcus wouldn&#39;t be coming down to breakfast. Of course, he was completely wrong about his theory. Deontay also declared that he thought that Dan was a faithful, and that his quiet personality shouldn&#39;t be confused with being a traitor.




Deontay called out Maks for talking too much and giving off &#34;nervous energy.&#34; He then told the group that the faithfuls had to open up their hearts because if they didn&#39;t know what to do, they&#39;d be sheep and follow the herd. He warned them that then they&#39;d make mistakes, and go back to their rooms feeling bad like they did the last time with Peppermint. Deontay stated, &#34;At some point in time, you gotta be a leader, and not a follower.&#34; Larsa then spoke up and said that she thought that Dan was a traitor, and that Maks wasn&#39;t a gamer like him. However, the damage was already done by Deontay.

Even Janelle Pierzina, who has a strong mind of her own and would never do something that she didn&#39;t believe in, admitted that Deontay was so convincing that she listened to him, and he changed her mind to vote for Maks. After Peppermint&#39;s banishment, Deontay was very upset that he was part of what Maks had called the &#34;herd mentality&#34; against her. However, his forceful speech was instrumental in banishing Maks at the next round table.




Because Deontay was so upset after he convinced people to eliminate Maks from the game, he&#39;ll most likely stay quiet at the next round table to avoid being wrong again. He also might switch his focus to Dan to take a completely different route in the game. Deontay also said that he didn&#39;t know how much longer he could go on playing The Traitors US.

 Larsa Pippen &amp; MJ Javid Suspect Dan Gheesling &amp; Might Take The Lead Now 
         

If Deontay and others such as Sandra Diaz-Twine, who also persuaded people to vote for Maks, take a step back, this will leave the floor open for players such as Larsa and MJ to take center stage at the next round table. They&#39;re suspicious of Dan, so this could spell trouble for him if they haven&#39;t shifted their focus to a different one of their fellow contestants. The faithfuls didn&#39;t follow Larsa and MJ&#39;s lead the first time they accused Dan, but, since the faithfuls have been wrong twice already, they might be ready to change their strategy, as Larsa and MJ have encouraged them to do.






 The Faithfuls Are Determined Not To Be Wrong Again 

 

After banishing two of their own, the faithfuls are determined not to make the same mistake again. In The Traitors US season 2 episode 3, Alan announced a new twist for the traitors, which was a murder in plain sight. This meant that Dan, Parvati, and Phaedra had to work together to retrieve a poisoned chalice from the library. The first faithful to drink from the cup would be murdered with a slow-acting poison. As Dan and Parvati worked together to get the chalice, Parvati pointed out that everyone was walking around the castle on high alert.

Although it&#39;s just a theory as of now, it&#39;s easy to imagine that perhaps someone such as Larsa or MJ was watching Dan&#39;s every move after the round table banishment. Dan is on their radar, and they don&#39;t want to eliminate another one of their own allies by mistakenly banishing a faithful again. The Traitors US episode 4 will reveal not only who gets murdered, but if anyone was suspicious of the traitors, especially Dan, during the dastardly deed. Dan must watch his back if he wants to survive the next banishment.




During The Traitors US season 2 so far, Dan has been very strategic when it comes to the murders. However, his social game is lacking, which has raised some red flags about him. After the faithfuls were wrong about Peppermint and Maks and banished them from the game, they won&#39;t want to make that mistake again. Therefore, they might go after Dan. The fallout from the first two banishments, combined with the murder in plain sigh,t could be the end of Dan&#39;s game. However, like his Big Brother funeral, in which he turned the tables when his eviction seemed inevitable, Dan could come up with another genius strategy and continue his reign as a traitor.



The Traitors US is available to stream on Peacock.
