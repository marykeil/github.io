## Literature Review
Jonathan Majors&#39; first TV interview since being found guilty of assault and being dropped by Marvel is set to air on ABC News next week.




Jonathan Majors&#39; first TV interview since his guilty verdict and Marvel firing is set to air next week. In the middle of Majors&#39; meteoric rise, which included a role as Kang the Conqueror in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, the actor was arrested for assaulting his ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari. Majors has since been found guilty by a Manhattan jury of two misdemeanor counts of reckless assault and harassment, and was swiftly dropped by Marvel from his recurring role as Kang.




Now, Majors&#39; first TV interview since his guilty verdict and firing from the MCU is set to air next week. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the interview with Linsey Davis will debut on Good Morning America on January 8, with additional segments featured on GMA3, and an extended version of the interview airing on ABC News Live Prime. IMPACT x Nightline will also present a half-hour special with more unaired segments on January 11, exclusively on Hulu.

                  Seriously, Why Can’t The MCU Just Drop Kang Now?   Rather than recasting Kang after Jonathan Majors’ exit from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the franchise could simply end the Conqueror&#39;s storyline.    


 Can The Jonathan Majors Interview Reverse The Fallout? 
          

Majors currently faces up to one year in jail as he awaits his sentencing hearing on February 6. However, according to the actor&#39;s attorneys, he is unlikely to serve prison time and is planning to appeal the use of private text messages during the trial. Nevertheless, the damage has already been done to his career and reputation. Shortly after his arrest, Majors was dropped by his management and PR company. He&#39;s also been dropped from several projects, such as the movie The Man in My Basement, and ad campaigns for the Texas Rangers and U.S. Army.






Majors was also dropped from an untitled Otis Redding biopic that he was attached to.




Marvel was the last, and the most high-profile employer to cut ties with Majors. His ousting from Marvel possibly puts his acting career at risk, since such a major opportunity is no longer available to him. Majors&#39; interview with the Disney-owned ABC News is also notable since he could use the opportunity to criticize the Disney-owned Marvel franchise for firing him. What, if any, positive impact the interview could have on Jonathan Majors&#39; irreparably damaged career and reputation remains to be seen.
