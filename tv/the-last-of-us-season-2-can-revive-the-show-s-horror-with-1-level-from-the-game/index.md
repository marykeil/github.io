Summary

  The horror elements in HBO&#39;s The Last of Us were lost in season 1, but a level from The Last of Us Part II can bring back the fear factor.   Abby&#39;s journey through the Ground Zero segment in The Last of Us Part II is one of the scariest moments in the game and could be the show&#39;s scariest moment yet.   Including the Rat King in the TV show would amplify the horror elements and fix the franchise&#39;s zombie problem in season 2.  







Although HBO&#39;s The Last of Us did a remarkable job in terms of drama, it quickly lost its horror elements which one level from The Last of Us Part II can revive. While the franchise&#39;s greatest strength is its character development and drama, horror is still a big part of the games and should get more focus within the show. The Last of Us season 1 finale set up season 2 perfectly, but it also reinforced how much of the game&#39;s horror had been lost. Zombies became more secondary to the story elements, resulting in humans becoming the biggest threat.

Joel killing the fireflies in The Last of Us season 1&#39;s finale emphasized this, and while the sinister nature of other survivors is an important theme in the franchise, the infected are also crucial. It is hard to implement game mechanics into the show, but the earliest encounter with a clicker showcased how strong Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey&#39;s performances were. These zombies strike fear into the characters, providing an uneasy feeling for the audience, while indicating horror holds heavy importance in The Last of Us. However, one level from TLOU Part II can revive the franchise&#39;s fear factor.





 The Ground Zero Segment Could Be The Last Of Us TV Show’s Scariest Moment Yet

The Last of Us Part II&#39;s Ground Zero segment is one of the most terrifying segments in the game and adapting this to the TV show would be its scariest moment yet. When Abby stumbles upon Ground Zero, the atmosphere of the game changes and tensions instantly rise. Much of her journey in the game has a lonely feel, but entering the dark, isolated environment of Ground Zero is a step up. Inside the facility, there are horrific sights, including blood, decayed corpses, and several deadly zombies, which all create a disturbing setting that would be perfect for the show.

The area is so chilling that The Last of Us season 2 could focus the episode around Abby&#39;s journey through it, which would help build her character while reigniting the show&#39;s horror. Abby is arguably one of the toughest characters in the franchise, but even she becomes horrified by what has become of the former hospital. Going through all this to find medical equipment for her friend will help show the kind of character she is, while also gripping viewers. The threats and gore that lay within Ground Zero will make for great TV, especially the area&#39;s final surprise.




                  You&#39;re Not Prepared For The Last Of Us&#39; Most Horrifying Zombie   The Last of Us episode 2 introduced Clickers and teased the arrival of Bloaters, but neither compare to the most horrifying zombie form to come.   



 How The Rat King Can Amplify The Last Of Us’ Horror Elements

Despite Ground Zero feeling like a never-ending nightmare, Abby has one last memorable encounter before her escape in the form of the Rat King. This mutated zombie is the most powerful one so far in the franchise and is easily the most disturbing enemy in the game, which is also the perfect way to amplify the HBO show&#39;s horror. The Rat King consists of multiple infected being combined into one organism to create The Last of Us&#39; most resilient zombie. Not only is its appearance a surprise, but Abby&#39;s attempt to survive it is a desperate one.




Including the Rat King could help fix The Last of Us&#39; zombie problem in season 2, as having a truly disturbing creature would at least make the zombie aspect of the franchise meaningful, even if season 2 doesn&#39;t include more infected. Abby trying to fight, outrun, and hide from this boss-like zombie is one of the best parts of the second game and would be an entertaining yet terrifying addition to the TV show. The Rat King is the defining factor of Ground Zero and would emphasize that there are still horror aspects in The Last of Us series.

              The Last Of Us  DramaHorrorAdventure Based on the critically acclaimed video game The Last of Us developed by Naughty Dog, the story of the TV series takes place twenty years after a parasitic fungal infection wreaks havoc across the world that turns humans into zombie-like creatures. Joel (Pedro Pascal) agrees to smuggle a 14-year-old girl named Ellie (Bella Ramsey) out of a quarantine zone, only to discover she may be the key to discovering a cure. The Last of Us TV series is a collaborative effort between one of the original creators, Neil Druckmann, and the creator of the award-winning HBO series Chernobyl.
