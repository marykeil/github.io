## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way’s Sumit Singh no longer looks stressed. He has achieved a major glow-up after undergoing a youthful transformation.




Sumit Singh from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way has achieved a praiseworthy post-marriage glow-up in 2023. The 35-year-old Indian man first appeared on the franchise in 2019. He pursued California woman, Jenny Slatten, whom he had originally catfished on Facebook. Sumit seemed unlikable in the first season, as he didn’t respect Jenny. He took advantage of her kindness and kept her waiting to marry him for years. Sumit let his family insult Jenny for nearly three seasons before he secretly married her. The Indian 90 Day Fiancé franchise star dropped the bombshell on his family in a later season.




While Sumit’s journey with Jenny didn’t start on a good note, he reinvented his image and became an ideal husband for her. In the last two years, Sumit ensured Jenny felt supported by him. He traveled with her all across India and let her be free. He also gave her the love and care she craved for nearly ten years. In August 2023, Sumit and Jenny celebrated their second anniversary. They seemed hopeful about their future and more youthful than ever. The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple had aged backwards since their marriage.

 How Sumit Looked Stressed Before 2023 

 

Sumit has been looking great lately. However, there was a time when he didn’t look so young. In 2021, Sumit went through a lot amid his secret marriage with Jenny and family issues. As a result, he started not to care for himself as much. Some old photos show that Sumit almost stopped grooming his beard and let it grow free. He also stopped dyeing his hair, which made him look more mature than he was. Sumit also looked unhappy in most of his pictures with Jenny.
