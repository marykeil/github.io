# 12 Biggest Characters Still Missing From The Wheel Of Time After Season 2


## SUMMARY 


 Season 3 of The Wheel of Time is expected to introduce several important characters from Robert Jordan&#39;s novels, including Queen Morgase, Elaida, and Galad. 
 The absence of these characters in the show&#39;s first two seasons is noticeable, but their appearances in the upcoming season are highly anticipated. 
 Other significant characters, such as Gawyn, Cadsuane, Rhuarc, and Rahvin, are also likely to make their debut in Season 3, further expanding the world of The Wheel of Time.

## Literature Review
The Wheel of Time has introduced a plethora of characters from Robert Jordan&#39;s book series, but 12 major characters are still missing after season 2.




The Wheel of Time has already introduced a lot of important characters from Robert Jordan&#39;s novel series of the same name, but 12 major characters remain on the sidelines after the show&#39;s first two seasons. With such an enormous series to adapt, it&#39;s unsurprising that not every important character has made it into the show after two seasons. Even so, after The Wheel of Time season 2&#39;s ending, there are several conspicuous character absences.
The Wheel of Time season 3 is expected to adapt the fourth of Jordan&#39;s novels, The Shadow Rising, but many of the arcs and characters from the previous book, The Dragon Reborn, were left out of season 2. The Wheel of Time season 2 was expected to cover books two and three, but with its main focus being placed on book 2, The Great Hunt, many characters ended up being excluded. While several of these minor figures are unlikely to ever appear, there are 12 major characters who need to appear soon in The Wheel of Time.
            
 
 Wheel Of Time Cast &amp; Character Guide 
Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time could be the next big fantasy series - here&#39;s a breakdown of the sprawling cast of characters in the expansive saga.













 








 12  Morgase Of House Trakand — Queen Of Andor 
Mother of Elayne and Gawyn Trakand


 







Though there are some Wheel of Time characters who may never appear after season 2, Queen Morgase of House Trakand is surely not one of them. Queen Morgase first appears in Jordan&#39;s first Wheel of Time novel, The Eye of the World, and though she is mostly absent from the next book, she begins to take on a more expanded role in book three, The Dragon Reborn. This book was supposedly incorporated into The Wheel of Time season 2, though the majority of its story — including Morgase&#39;s role — ended up being cut. That being said, Morgase is mentioned several times in season 2, so she&#39;s certain to debut soon.





 11  Elaida do Avriny a&#39;Rhoihan — Aes Sedai Of The Red Ajah 
Advisor to the Queen of Andor
        

Elaida do Avriny a&#39;Rhoihan is an Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah who, like Morgase, appears in the first Wheel of Time novel. She becomes a particularly important character in book four, The Shadow Rising — the book The Wheel of Time season 3 is adapting — making it intriguing to see whether she will finally be brought into the show. Elaida&#39;s most important book story could be given to another Aes Sedai, but she is so important to Jordan&#39;s novels that there&#39;s a good chance she appears in The Wheel of Time season 3.





 10  Galadedrid Of House Damodred — Prince Of Andor 
Half-brother to Gawyn and Elayne Trakand
        

Galadedrid of House Damodred, better known as Galad, is the stepson of Queen Morgase and the half-brother of Gawyn and Elayne Trakand. Though The Wheel of Time season 3 might skip a whole book, it&#39;s hard to imagine Galad being cut from the show. His story sprawls across Jordan&#39;s novel series, intersecting with Perrin, Nynaeve, and many others&#39; arcs along the way. He ultimately rises high in his chosen role in the world and comports himself heroically at The Last Battle, so fans can expect to see him in the show very soon.





 9  Gawyn Of House Trakand — Prince Of Andor 
Son of Queen Morgase and brother to Elayne
        

Another important character who has been left out of The Wheel of Time thus far is Gawyn of House Trakand, son of Queen Morgase and brother to Elayne. Gawyn is in one of the major romances to expect in The Wheel of Time, and his overall role in the story is probably too important for him to be left out. Gawyn is one of the finest swordsman in the land, and though he is young and brash, he is also a skilled commander. Expect Gawyn to make his debut in The Wheel of Time season 3, especially after his name was briefly mentioned in season 2.





 8  Cadsuane Melaidhrin — Aes Sedai Of The Green Ajah 
One of the most powerful Aes Sedai in centuries
        

Cadsuane Melaidhrin is one of the most powerful Aes Sedai seen in centuries until Nynaeve and Egwene arrive at the White Tower, and she is one of the most influential characters in Jordan&#39;s novel series. Cadsuane is nearly 300 years old in the main series, and she is one of the sternest and wisest characters in the saga. She plays integral roles in several key events throughout the series, and though she is not scheduled to appear yet based on the book series, the show could easily decide to introduce her early since she is such a popular character.





 7  Rhuarc — Clan Chief Of The Taardad Aiel 
One of Rand&#39;s strongest allies among the Aiel


 







Rhuarc is the clan chief of the Taardad Aiel and one of the most important members of the Aiel in The Wheel of Time. He becomes one of Rand&#39;s closest allies and supporters among the Aiel, and the influence of his fierce reputation paired with the strength of his clan are invaluable to Rand&#39;s efforts to unite the Aiel. Rhuarc is one of the first Aiel to accept Rand as the Car&#39;a&#39;carn — the Aiel&#39;s name for the Dragon — and with Rand expected to journey to the Aiel Waste in The Wheel of Time season 3, it&#39;s likely Rhuarc will finally make his debut then.





 6  Rahvin — Forsaken Member 
Disguises himself as Lord Gaebril


 







Rahvin is one of the most powerful channelers ever and a member of the dreaded Forsaken. According to the books, he should have appeared in The Wheel of Time season 2, working under the alias of Lord Gaebril as he manipulates Queen Morgase with the One Power. If this storyline is included in the show, then Rahvin/Gaebril&#39;s debut should align with Queen Morgase&#39;s. Therefore, it&#39;s likely he will appear in The Wheel of Time season 3. However, it should be noted that several Forsaken members are expected to be cut from the show, and it&#39;s still possible that Rahvin ends up being one of them.





 5  Pedron Niall — Lord Captain Commander Of The Children Of The Light 
Leader of the White Cloaks
        

Pedron Niall, the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light, is one of the most intriguing and nuanced villains in The Wheel of Time. He first appears in the third book&#39;s prologue, making him late for his debut in the show&#39;s continuity. It&#39;s possible he could be cut from the show and Eamon Valda could remain the main antagonist from this faction, but Niall is such a fascinating character that it would feel like a real disservice to the source material to exclude him. With that in mind, he is another likely candidate to appear in The Wheel of Time season 3.





 4  Zarine/Faile Bashere — Cousin To The Queen Of Saldea 
Daughter of Captain Davram Bashere
        

Zarine Bashere, known almost exclusively as Faile, is another character from Jordan&#39;s third novel, The Dragon Reborn, who was left out of The Wheel of Time season 2. While many of the elements of The Dragon Reborn that were cut from season 2 are likely to remain absent from the show, Faile&#39;s appearance is bound to happen. Faile and Perrin become inseparable as the story continues, and it&#39;s unlikely the show will cut one of the most successful relationships from the books. Her father, Davram Bashere, is also one of the four Great Captains on the continent, making their story nigh on indispensable.

Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time season 3 has a valuable opportunity to include eight missing storylines from the show&#39;s first two seasons.









 3  Gaul — Of The Shaarad Aiel 
Leader of the Stone Dogs
        

Gaul, a member of the Shaarad clan of the Aiel, first appears when Perrin rescues him from a cage in The Dragon Reborn. This storyline was adapted in The Wheel of Time season 2, but the show opted to use Aviendha in the role rather than Gaul. Many more Aiel are expected to appear in season 3, so it&#39;s possible Gaul will make an appearance some time soon. In the books, he is a nearly constant companion to Perrin, and since they make such a great team, the hope is that he will be introduced in The Wheel of Time season 3.





 2  Gareth Bryne — Captain General Of The Queen&#39;s Guard Of Andor 
Considered one of the four &#34;Great Captains&#34; of the land
        

Another major character yet to appear in The Wheel of Time is Gareth Bryne, the Captain General of the Queen&#39;s Guard of Andor. Bryne is a faithful servant and a fine soldier, considered to be one of the greatest military commanders of the age. He appears in the first Wheel of Time novel, but does not take on a major role until later in the series. However, The Wheel of Time is approaching that point in the series as it ventures into book four, making it likely Bryne will appear in the show soon.





 1  Juilin Sandar — Thief-Catcher 
Comes from the city of Tear
        

Juilin Sandar is one of those characters from Jordan&#39;s novels who first appears in a minor role, only to pop up again and again until, suddenly, he is one of the most prominent characters in the series. Juilin might never approach main character status, but he becomes a valuable companion to Nynaeve and Elayne as they hunt members of the Black Ajah. With Nynaeve and Elayne&#39;s hunt expected to make up the majority of their Wheel of Time season 3 arcs, it seems likely Juilin will appear in the upcoming season.
