Exclusive: Brennan Lee Mulligan teases the start of Fantasy High Junior Year and explains why this world stays present in the minds of Dimension 20.


Summary

  Dimension 20 returns to the world of Fantasy High because it is beloved by viewers and the cast.   The Bad Kids&#39; adventures as teenage heroes and high school students provide new storylines and themes for each season.   Fantasy High is the cornerstone of Dimension 20 and will continue to be one of the most important pillars of the series.  





Brennan Lee Mulligan explained why Dimension 20 continues to return to the world of Fantasy High and teased more adventures for the Bad Kids. In 2018, Dimension 20 launched the first season of Fantasy High, and the second season followed only a year later. Between Fantasy High Sophomore Year and Junior Year, Dimension 20 has expanded the world of Spyer with two side quests, The Seven and Pirates of Leviathan, making it the most fleshed out of all the stories in Dimension 20&#39;s pantheon.




During an interview with Screen Rant for Dimension 20: Burrow&#39;s End, Mulligan also discussed Fantasy High Junior Year. He shared why they continue to return to the world of Fantasy High, including the massive cliffhanger in season 2. Mulligan teased the continued adventures of the Bad Kids, both in high school and as teenage heroes.


Brennan Lee Mulligan: It&#39;s different for every one. Fantasy High obviously stays present in our minds, because it stays present in the minds of our viewers...Sophomore Year, we did because it felt like a really fun continuation and we wanted to see the Bad Kids on the adventure....
For Fantasy High, where we left it, we left it on a cliffhanger. We left it on the Night Yorb exploding out of Riz&#39;s chest, which is a little bit of a joke, but there does always feel like something where they&#39;re still teenage heroes. They&#39;re still going through high school. There&#39;s still lots of things, new things to come up. So I think that there is not a one size fits all approach. Sometimes a story just starts telling you that it&#39;s not over yet.






 How Dimension 20 Continues To Build Out The World Of Fantasy High 
         

Fantasy High is not the only season that Dimension 20 has returned to. Unsleeping City continued with a second season, and Calorum, the world of A Crown of Candy, grew with the prequel, The Ravening War. However, Spyre is the most revisited, with characters and settings introduced in the first two seasons of Fantasy High spawning their own stories.

                  Brennan Lee Mulligan Reveals Which Dimension 20 Seasons He Wants Animated   Exclusive: Brennan Lee Mulligan reveals which two seasons of Dimension 20 he thinks would work especially well in the animation format and why.    

The Seven follows the seven maidens, who become an adventuring party in their own right after surviving Kalvaxus, while Pirates of Leviathan is set in the floating pirate city that the Bad Kids visited in the second season. Part of the return is nostalgia, as Mulligan points out, with fans continuously sharing their love for this world. However, another aspect is the dense world that he has built with the Bad Kids and their adventures.






Fantasy High is able to explore new storylines and themes each season because the Bad Kids have such different origins as well as their continued growth.




Setting the core of this story in a high school allows the world of Fantasy High to evolve and grow with the characters, thus opening the doors to new storylines and characters. Fantasy High is what launched Dimension 20 and will likely continue to be one of the most important pillars of the series.
