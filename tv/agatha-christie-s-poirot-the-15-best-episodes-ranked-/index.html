<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The very best episodes of Agatha Christies Poirot - arguably the very best adaptation of her world-famous beloved Belgian detective.</p>
<p>The best episodes of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot show why the Belgian detective is up there with Sherlock Holmes on the list of the most famous fictional sleuths ever portrayed on screen. Born from the mind of Agatha Christie, the best-selling fiction author of all time, Hercule Poirot has been interpreted on the big and small screens for decades. From 1989 to 2013, Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot entertained fans of the ingenious detective with one of the most riveting versions of the character to date. Though the series ended in 2013, it&rsquo;s still considered the definitive adaptation — and the best Poirot episodes demonstrate why.
The titular detective in Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot is played by David Suchet, whose performance is often regarded as the best version of Poirot ever brought to the screen. The British actor took on the role in the show Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot, playing it for a total of 24 years over the course of 13 series and 70 episodes — and the number of fascinating characters and talented Poirot guest stars is just as large. While every installment was memorable and honored the source material, the best Poirot episodes stand out as prime examples of why the definitive version of Poirot remained on screens for almost a decade and a half.

<p>Every Major Actor Who Played Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Hercule Poirot, Ranked
With Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot in 50 stories or more, it&rsquo;s not surprising that there have been numerous adaptations. But which portrayal is the best?</p>
<p>15  Elephants Can Remember
Season 13, Episode 1</p>
<p>One of the most beloved recurring characters was Zoë Wanamaker&rsquo;s Ariadne Oliver, the witty and messy writer who mirrored Agatha Christie herself to a certain degree. In one of the best Poirot episodes, Ariadne takes on her own case with the assistance of Poirot.
In the meantime, Poirot is also busy with his own case involving a murder at a psychiatric facility. When it becomes clear the two cases are connected, Poirot must stop yet another killing and explain how two suspicious cases, that took place decades apart, could have anything to do with each other. The threads that tie together do so in a fascinating manner, giving both Oliver and Poirot great moments in the case.</p>
<p>14  The Labours of Hercules
Season 13, Episode 4</p>
<p>Series 13&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Labours of Hercules&rdquo; is adapted from a compilation of a series of short stories published by Agatha Christie. Despite this being one of the best Poirot episodes, the plot is somewhat muddied by how much the episode tries to pack in. However, where this at times caused the episode to struggle, it was also ultimately why it was among the most memorable.
It is an episode that takes place in a hotel in the Swiss Alpes where Poirot finds himself surrounded by a series of mysterious crimes that do not seem to add up, at least not at first. As events weave together, audiences start to learn alongside the detective, furthering their appreciation for him and investment in the show.</p>
<p>13  Dumb Witness
Season 6, Episode 4</p>
<p>In the final episode of Series 6, Poirot receives a letter from a woman who thinks she is in danger of being murdered. Believing it is a matter of her will, Poirot attempts to convince her to change it, only to discover that she has died mysteriously. Poirot investigates her death, suspecting foul play. While the episode stands out among the dozens in the show overall, its pacing prevents it from ranking higher among the best Poirot episodes.
&ldquo;Dumb Witness&rdquo; is a fitting conclusion to the sixth series, including a fascinating mystery with several people who have motives. It features many of the more common aspects of a Poirot mystery, but that does not make it any less exciting. This 1996 episode can still grip viewers 25 years later, and it remains a textbook example of why the staples and tropes of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot are partly why it&rsquo;s so beloved.</p>
<p>Agatha Christie: Every Licensed TV Series Based On Her Work, Ranked According To IMDb
Agatha Christie&rsquo;s mystery novels gave birth to incredible TV series, from Poirot to Miss Marple, and more. We&rsquo;re ranking all of them!</p>
<p>12  The Chocolate Box
Season 5, Episode 6</p>
<p>By the time audiences meet Poirot in Christie&rsquo;s books and the show, he is a Belgian refugee in England who had a prolific career as a member of the police force in his home country and reached global fame due to his impressive abilities. It is also an episode that reveals certain aspects of Poirot&rsquo;s past that shine an interesting light on him as a character, including a woman who loved him.
&ldquo;The Chocolate Box&quot;is a welcome change as it walks audiences through one of Poirot&rsquo;s cases when he was still working for the Belgian police. It is a case that almost confused Poirot himself, and it offers fans more insight into the character&rsquo;s past and how he came to be the renowned figure he is today. Poirot is such a fascinating character, any episode that delves deeper into his personality is worthwhile.</p>
<p>11  Dead Man&rsquo;s Folly
Season 13, Episode 3</p>
<p>In “Dead Man&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; Hercule Poirot is asked to attend a fête by his friend Ariadne Oliver, who has been asked to orchestrate a fake murder hunt for the festivities and feels on edge about the people in attendance. It all seems to be a game until the fake victim actually gets murdered. Other people disappear and die as well, creating a terrifying atmosphere among the festivities that were initially presented to be lighthearted.
The episode feels like a change of pace for the series as it doesn&rsquo;t contain the elaborate art deco aesthetic that was praised in earlier seasons. However, this juxtaposition makes the episode all the more interesting, and it includes Zoë Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver, who has appeared in several other episodes and is a welcome addition. Though one of the final episodes of the show, &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo; demonstrates that the program did not slow down and featured some fascinating storylines.</p>
<p>10  After The Funeral
Season 10, Episode 3</p>
<p>&ldquo;After The Funeral&rdquo; marked the third episode of Series 10 and featured a young Michael Fassbender in one of the main roles. This was one of those episodes that leaves audiences wondering how they managed to completely miss the twist and leaves them in awe of the incredible acting and phenomenal writing, mirroring movies like Knives Out.
In the installment, when people begin to drop dead within a problematic family, it seems like everyone is a suspect. Murder among a large family where the loved ones are prime suspects has been used in many murder mystery stories and always provides the fascinating question of how someone could kill their own family. This is the question that drives the narrative and leads to a conclusion that not even the smartest among audience members could possibly have guessed.</p>
<p>The Best Adaptations Of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Work, According To Rotten Tomatoes
It&rsquo;s likely that no one has sold more mystery novels than Agatha Christie. Rotten Tomatoes ranks the best movie adaptations of her books, here.</p>
<p>9  Hercule Poirot&rsquo;s Christmas
Season 6, Episode 1</p>
<p>One of the best Poirot episodes came with the series 6 premiere, &ldquo;Hercule Poirot&rsquo;s Christmas&rdquo;. Hercule Poirot receives a strange invitation to spend Christmas in the mansion of an old, rich man who suspects he is in danger and that someone in the family has it out for him. It offers a nice cozy murder mystery with a holiday twist, even if the episode doesn&rsquo;t stay particularly true to the Agatha Christie novel.
Manipulation, diamonds, long-lost children, and fake personas: There is a little bit of everything in this exciting episode that sees Poirot investigating the murder of the old man and the disappearance of some very valuable diamonds. As many scenarios do, it all comes down to the detective&rsquo;s brilliant mind, which is portrayed wonderfully by David Suchet, giving further evidence why he is one of the best actors who played Agatha&rsquo;s Christie&rsquo;s Hercule Poirot.</p>
<p>8  Five Little Pigs
Season 9, Episode 1</p>
<p>The great thing about Agatha Christie&rsquo;s Poirot was that it wasn&rsquo;t afraid to try and adapt Christie&rsquo;s unique way of storytelling into television, succeeding in spectacular fashion. &ldquo;Five Little Pigs&rdquo; was a perfect example of that. Cementing itself as one of the best interpretations of Christie&rsquo;s work, the episode also offers something slightly new in its storytelling as it finds Poirot taking on a cold case.
The story is told in a series of flashbacks as witnesses recount the days leading up to a tragic event that culminated in the death of two people, and Poirot uses his powers of deduction alone to solve a decades-old crime. The environment of both eras is exceptionally well done, conveying a sense that it actually takes place at an earlier time and increasing immersion.</p>
<p>7  Curtain: Poirot&rsquo;s Last Case
Season 13, Episode 5</p>
<p>The hardest episode to watch also happens to be the very last. &ldquo;Curtain: Poirot&rsquo;s Last Case&rdquo; quite literally sees Poirot solving his last case and, ultimately, dying after many decades of crime-solving. Agatha Christie had originally written the story of &ldquo;Curtain&rdquo; in the 1940s during World War II. The author feared for her safety and wished for her detective to have a fitting end lest something happen to her, so she had the story sealed away in a bank vault for more than 30 years.
As the planned end for Poirot, there is no surprise that it&rsquo;s the most heart-wrenching and engaging of all his stories. David Suchet was so emotional by the time he finished filming Poirot&rsquo;s death that he cried. While certainly emotional, the episode is a triumph as Poirot got the goodbye he deserved.</p>
<p>15 British Murder Mysteries You Need To Watch
Distinctly British shows sometimes don&rsquo;t translate to other audiences, but here are some British murder mystery series that deserve a watch.</p>
<p>6  The ABC Murders
Season 4, Episode 1</p>
<p>Much like &ldquo;Five Little Pigs,&rdquo; Series 4&rsquo;s &ldquo;The ABC Murders&rdquo; takes on a different perspective by having a serial killer interact directly with Poirot and taunt him throughout the whole episode. It is the first time audiences witness Poirot dealing with a serial murderer, and it is interesting to see how he deals with the pressure of knowing there is always going to be a new victim unless he finds the killer.
This scenario grips audiences, and the story was also made into the 2018 miniseries The ABC Murders. There is something special about the first episode of the fourth series of Poirot, though, and it continues to be a classic. Deviations from the Agatha Christie novel in the adaptation were the main complaints surrounding the episode, but it still was a smoother installment than &ldquo;Hercule Poirot&rsquo;s Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5  Death On The Nile
Season 9, Episode 3</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death on the Nile&rdquo; is the third episode of Series 9 focuses on newly-wedded couple Simon Doyle and Linnet Ridgeway on their honeymoon. Linnet asks Poirot to dissuade Simon&rsquo;s ex, who feels abandoned, from following them around everywhere, but Poirot fails to persuade her. When Linnet is murdered while on their honeymoon cruise down the Nile River, Poirot must investigate every suspicious passenger on the cruise who has something to hide.
This episode shines through its excellent costuming and set design, showcasing the beauty of Egypt and the Pyramids while telling a dramatic story of heartbreak and murder.The Death on the Nile story has been adapted on more than one occasion, with the 1978 film being one of the best adaptations of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s work. The Poirot episode also does the tale justice, though, including some excellent performances with a young Emily Blunt as Linnet Ridgeway.</p>
<p>4  Evil Under The Sun
Season 8, Episode 1</p>
<p>Certainly one of the best Poirot episodes, &ldquo;Evil Under the Sun&rdquo; opens up series 8 with a beachside murder mystery. The episode itself has also been made into a 1982 feature film starring none other than the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith. In the series 8 premiere, Poirot suffers a heart attack and is forced to stay at the Sandy Cove Hotel for some rest and relaxation, which is of course, short-lived.
A mysterious love triangle sits at the heart of &ldquo;Evil Under the Sun,&rdquo; as the beautiful Arlena Stuart vies for the attention of one married man Patrick Redfern, much to the chagrin of her own neglected husband. When she ends up being found strangled on the beach, Poirot is on the case. While the revelation of the murderer seems easy to guess at first glance, nothing is ever as it seems and the clever twist is why &ldquo;Evil Under the Sun&rdquo; is one of the best Poirot episodes.</p>
<p>25 Best Agatha Christie Movie Adaptations Ranked
Agatha Christie created iconic characters like Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, and more. Her novels made for great movie adaptations - here are the best!</p>
<p>3  Hallowe&rsquo;en Party
Season 12, Episode 2</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallowe&rsquo;en Party&rdquo; takes its name from the Christie novel whereas the story was also recently adapted for the big screen in Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s A Haunting in Venice. Fan favorite Ariadne Oliver makes another appearance as she attends a child&rsquo;s Halloween party in a secluded manor. When Joyce Reynolds boasts that she once witnessed a murder, she is later found drowned in a bobbing-for-apples tub.
This leads Ariadne to contact Hercule Poirot, who is quickly on the case. Connecting Joyce Reynolds&rsquo; murder to that of other mysterious crimes in the town, Poirot uncovers something that is truly chilling, and worthy of a Halloween special. This is one of the best Poirot episodes due to its rewatchability. Upon watching it again, clues that were hidden in plain sight can be spotted, and there&rsquo;s something new discovered with each screening.</p>
<p>2  Murder On The Orient Express
Season 12, Episode 3</p>
<p>One of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s most popular works, Murder on the Orient Express has been adapted on several occasions. In 2010, Poirot had its turn at the tale, which sees a businessman murdered and all passengers seemingly having no motive. Easily one of the best Poirot episodes, the series did an outstanding job of honoring Agatha Christie&rsquo;s original work and it features a much darker tone than other retellings.
Having played the character for 11 full series at this point, David Suchet brilliantly embraces the role of the detective, taking the audience through his mental processes and filling the scenes with suspense and incredible revelations throughout &ldquo;Murder on the Orient Express.&rdquo; It is a familiar tale, but Poirot executes it wonderfully, putting the hour-and-a-half episode on par with many of the best mystery movies. It also features a strong ensemble, including Jessica Chastain, David Morrissey, and Toby Jones.</p>
<p>1  Peril At End House
Season 2, Episode 1</p>
<p>As a famous and relatively wealthy detective, Poirot often travels around England and the world, touching upon several interesting backdrops against which horrible crimes take place. &ldquo;Peril At End House&rdquo; is easily one of the best Poirot episodes and one of the more faithful adaptations of Agatha Christie&rsquo;s extensive body of work. This early Poirot episode has one of the strongest endings, with a poignant breakdown during its final moments.
This second series episode features Poirot and fan-favorites Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon (played by Pauline Moran), and Inspector Japp in an interesting situation. The Belgian detective is staying at a Cornish resort where he meets a young heiress who seems to be in danger. From there on, everything unravels in amazing Agatha Christie&rsquo;sPoirotfashion, filled with mystery, tension, and revelations that make the show as well-regarded as it is.</p>
