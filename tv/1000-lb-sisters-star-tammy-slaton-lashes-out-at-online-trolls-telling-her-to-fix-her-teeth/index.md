## Literature Review
1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton is not going to let her critics rain on her parade. She&#39;s lashing out at a TikTok troll who made fun of her teeth.




1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton slammed her critics for making fun of her teeth while she’s on a transformative journey and healing herself after the sudden death of her husband. Tammy, a 36-year-old woman from Dixon, became the leading lady of the reality TV show along with her sister Amy Slaton in 2020. Tammy was popular as a YouTuber and documented her weight-loss journey, which didn’t go according to plan. She experienced multiple health crises due to her weight and lifestyle. Tammy entered rehab in Ohio, where she met her husband, Caleb Willingham. Caleb unexpectedly died in June 2023 a few months after their wedding.




Tammy posted a TikTok video responding to a follower who criticized her teeth by leaving an awful comment on her page.


 

“Fix them teeth,” the person told 1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton. She replied to them “With all due respect, I wish people like you would stop commenting c*** like this.” Tammy told the person that reading such messages was not helping her confidence. She said she was trying to keep her “confidence boosted,” but seeing comments about her teeth or her chin was not helping. The person had commented on a post of Tammy dancing. She admitted that she couldn’t dance, but she was trying to cheer herself up by doing it anyway.

 Tammy Slaton Refuses To Let Critics &#34;Ruin My Day&#34; 
          

Furthermore, Tammy said that getting her teeth fixed was going to require funds that she didn’t have. “Getting my teeth fixed cost money I don’t have right now,” Tammy confessed. She said she had to calm herself down before replying to the person because she really wanted to “go off” on the person. She wanted to tell them that if they had a “true problem” with her teeth, they could have paid for the treatment themselves. Tammy used the incident to encourage her fans to spread a message of love and not hate.

“We should be lifting up each other,” Tammy said. She thought it was sad that the person was hiding behind a picture and a fake username to attack her online. She knew it was a “hate comment” and that it didn’t mean what they were saying was right. She asked the critic why they couldn’t appreciate the work she was putting in. “Why can’t you just appreciate that I’m still alive?” Tammy asked. She admitted that she has flaws, but that’s what makes her human. Tammy informed the troll that they were not going to let them or anybody else “ruin” her day. She signed off by saying, “I do hope that you have an amazing day.&#34;




Tammy underwent bariatric surgery in July 2022. She was over 725 pounds at her heaviest and lost over 440 pounds, which helped her get rid of her walker and wheelchair. Tammy doesn’t have to use oxygen now and her gleefully dancing in the video is proof of it. While Tammy celebrates her small victories, some people want to drag her down by telling her she’s still not good enough in their eyes. However, Tammy has learned how to correctly deal with the negativity on social media while she motivates her fans to become better human beings and live well.



1000-Lb Sisters airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
