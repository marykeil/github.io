## Literature Review
Bridgerton season 3 may focus on Colin and Penelope, but the newly recast Francesca can easily give them a run for their money.



Based on Julia Quinn&#39;s Romancing Mister Bridgerton, Bridgerton season 3 is set to spin the romance wheel once more with Colin and Penelope at the center of it, but Colin&#39;s sister, Francesca, may incidentally become the real star of the season. While it is unclear whether the upcoming chapter follows the book timeline closely or takes liberties with the canon, it seems that Francesca Bridgerton might be playing a more prominent role in season 3 than she ever has before. The character, played by Ruby Stokes in the first two seasons, will be portrayed by Hannah Dodd in season 3, and the change of actress may be a sign that Francesca will come out of the shadows at last.
Bridgerton season 3&#39;s May release date is still a little while away, but it is safe to say that the anticipation keeps growing. The plot will revolve around Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington, as they find their way back into each other&#39;s lives and eventually fall deeply in love. According to the official synopsis for season 3, the story will be quite different from the novel — there might not even be a decade-long time jump, which is essential not only for Colin and Penelope&#39;s relationship beginnings but also for Eloise and Francesca&#39;s respective stories. However, if the timeline is preserved, Francesca is well on her way to stealing a bit of the limelight from the main couple.
            

 10 Wildest Bridgerton Season 3 Theories That Could Actually Happen 
Bridgerton season 3 is nearing its release, and theories about what will transpire during Colin and Penelope&#39;s story are getting creative.




 7  Francesca&#39;s Debut In The London Ton 
Francesca is out in society in Bridgerton season 3



All 8 Bridgerton siblings vary in age greatly, but Eloise and Francesca are a mere year apart. Eloise is 18 years old in season 2 when she makes her debut in society, so it won&#39;t be surprising if Francesca follows suit at exactly the same age in Bridgerton season 3. One of the promo images for the upcoming chapter, which seemingly brings Francesca into the focus of the story at last, makes this turn of events even more probable. Colin and Penelope have always been entertaining to watch, but Francesca joining the London ton might bring a brand new energy to Bridgerton in season 3.




 6  Francesca&#39;s First Love Story With John 
Francesca &amp; John Stirling get married in Bridgerton season 3
        

In Romancing Mister Bridgerton, Colin makes the infamous comment about never marrying Penelope in 1817. In When He Was Wicked, Francesca marries her first husband, the Earl of Kilmartin, in 1818. Considering that Bridgerton season 2 has altered the timeline to introduce Colin&#39;s hurtful remark as early as 1814 and season 3 might see Francesca come out in society, it is entirely possible that Francesca&#39;s first courtship and love story will be shown in the background of season 3. It could be exciting if she met the dashing John Stirling at a ball in her very first season, and he got the screen time he deserved before he had to meet his canonical yet heartbreaking fate.



 5  Francesca&#39;s Friendship With Michael

One of the key elements of Francesca&#39;s story is that her second husband, Michael Stirling, had been in her life for years before they got together. Michael falls in love with Francesca the second he lays eyes on her, but she is head over heels for John, his cousin, and the two are engaged to be married at the time, much to Michael&#39;s disappointment. Still, it doesn&#39;t stop him from befriending the oblivious Francesca. If John is introduced in Bridgerton season 3, Michael will have to make his entrance into Francesca&#39;s life as well, and their beautiful, though one-sided, friendship might blossom in the upcoming chapter, leaving very little viewer attention to Colin and Penelope&#39;s budding romance.



 4  Francesca &amp; Eloise&#39;s Relationship 
Eloise is Francesca&#39;s closest confidante



Francesca and Eloise are said to be close friends in the novels, and although there are glimpses of their connection in Bridgerton season 1, this duo&#39;s strong sisterly bond is yet to be seen in full action in the series. Eloise and Francesca are the closest in age, so naturally, they have more in common with each other than with their other siblings. Even when Francesca marries John and moves to Scotland, Eloise frequently writes to her sister, sharing her own exploits and asking about Francesca&#39;s married life. Seeing as Francesca might finally come out of her shell in Bridgerton season 3, it would be fitting if she and Eloise shared a few heartwarming moments on-screen.




 3  Francesca&#39;s Miscarriage &amp; Grief 
Losing John &amp; her baby takes a toll on Francesca
        

In When He Was Wicked, Francesca&#39;s first husband, John, tragically dies in 1820, followed by her losing their baby quickly after, and the darkest years in Francesca&#39;s life begin. Again, if Bridgerton season 3 features the book time jump at least to some extent and chooses to tell part of Francesca&#39;s tale in line with Colin&#39;s, it might get to the point of John&#39;s death and Francesca&#39;s miscarriage. While it would be devastating to watch, this plotline, which is essential to Francesca&#39;s backstory and her future motivations, would add raw realism to the show and showcase this Bridgerton as a layered dramatic character.



 2  Francesca As A Wise Advisor To Colin &amp; Eloise 
Francesca becomes the Daphne of Bridgerton season 3
        

Francesca has been largely missing from the first two seasons of the show, but all of that could change. Daphne&#39;s Bridgerton exit could make room for Francesca in season 3 — since her debut in season 1, Daphne has been an advisor to her siblings, and she has felt even more comfortable in this role as a married woman in season 2. Francesca could now take her sister&#39;s place and shine her wisdom on her loved ones. When Francesca starts a family with John, she may gain more authority in the eyes of her siblings, and both Colin and Eloise may end up coming to Francesca with the matters of the heart.



 1  Francesca &amp; Michael&#39;s Romantic Beginnings 
Francesca &amp; Michael grow closer and heal together
        

In Julia Quinn&#39;s novels, a lot happens in 1824 — Colin and Penelope get married, Eloise and Philip Crane are wed, and Francesca and Michael tie the knot after their shared four-year-long grieving period for John. Should Bridgerton stick to the original book timeline or accelerate it to include Francesca&#39;s first love story in season 3, the first sparks between Francesca and Michael could be seen flying as soon as the finale. However, that would also mean that Benedict and Sophie&#39;s tale might continue to be unceremoniously shelved and Bridgerton&#39;s biggest reveal might be dragged out for another season or two.
