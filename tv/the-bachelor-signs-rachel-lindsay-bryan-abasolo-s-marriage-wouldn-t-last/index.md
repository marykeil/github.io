## Literature Review
The Bachelor Nation stars Rachel Lindsay &amp; Bryan Abasolo recently announced their split. However, their eventual separation was always expected. 




The Bachelor Nation stars Rachel Lindsay and Bryan Abasolo recently announced their divorce, but there were always signs the marriage wouldn&#39;t last. Rachel first appeared on The Bachelor season 21 before being announced as the lead for The Bachelorette season 13. With 31 suitors to choose from, Rachel ended the season with her final two contestants, Bryan and Peter Kraus, but she eventually chose Bryan.




However, on Tuesday, January 2, Bryan filed for divorce from Rachel after more than 4 years of marriage. In the divorce statement, Bryan noted that the couple both agreed to make the difficult decision to part ways and start anew. Still, the divorce announcement didn&#39;t come as a surprise because there were obvious signs the marriage wouldn&#39;t last.

 Rachel Seemingly Gravitated Towards Her Runner-Up On The Bachelorette 
          

When Rachel announced Bryan as her final pick, the decision disappointed and shocked many Bachelor Nation fans who were rooting for runner-up Peter. For significant parts of the season, Rachel looked in love with Peter more than almost all the contestants on The Bachelorette season 13. Meanwhile, Peter was also a fan favorite from the moment he appeared on the show. Peter and Rachel&#39;s chemistry, personality, goals, and love for a family made them the perfect match and made Peter the first choice of most people to win Rachel&#39;s heart.




However, when it became clear Rachel had chosen Bryan over Peter, the decision left many Bachelor Nation fans feeling deflated. After weeks of watching Rachel sift through 31 suitors to arrive at her final two, watching Rachel accept Bryan&#39;s engagement ring didn&#39;t feel as good as it should. The couple ended the season with most believing their eventual split was only a matter of when, not if, it would ever happen.



 Rachel &amp; Bryan Rarely Took Photos Together 
         

After The Bachelorette season 13 finale in 2017, Rachel and Bryan would tie the knot two years later in a marriage ceremony in Cancun. In an interview afterward, Rachel revealed they partied till two in the morning, and Bryan even had to leave in hotel slippers because he had blisters on his feet, per USA Today. However, despite their seemingly happy marriage, Rachel and Bryan rarely took pictures together or posted about one another on social media. Although it looked like they wanted to be private about their marriage, they both have individual Instagram accounts, and it felt weird they only occasionally appeared together in most of their pictures.






 Rachel Recently Said She &amp; Bryan Live Different Lives 

 

On December 21, 2023, weeks before Bryan filed for divorce from Rachel, she appeared on Nick Viall&#39;s &#34;The Viall Files&#34; podcast to seemingly hint that things were not going great in their marriage. On the podcast, Rachel admitted that she and her husband lived totally different lives due to their careers and were often on separate pages. As a couple, Rachel, a TV host and podcaster, and Bryan, a chiropractor, couldn&#39;t make time for one another to do things they enjoy together (via People).

Nonetheless, Rachel revealed she accepted it for the well-being of their relationship. Rachel further revealed she and Bryan were working on trying to have a kid, but it&#39;s been a little bit of a struggle, too. Despite Rachel&#39;s hopeful statement about her marriage, it was clear there was trouble in paradise for The Bachelor Nation stars, and their divorce announcement just weeks after wasn&#39;t surprising.
