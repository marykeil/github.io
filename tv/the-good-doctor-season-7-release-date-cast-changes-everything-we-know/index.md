## Literature Review
The ABC medical drama The Good Doctor is returning for season 7, but the latest news sees release delays, cast changes, and more. Here&#39;s what&#39;s known.




ABC&#39;s hit medical drama series The Good Doctor has been renewed for a seventh season, and the latest news is positive after months of delay. The Good Doctor follows a young autistic surgeon with savant syndrome named Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) as he rises up the ranks in his medical career and attempts to foster a successful personal and social life. Due to his diagnosis, Shaun can come off as callous and has a few idiosyncrasies, but he befriends several other doctors and residents during his residency at the San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital who help him along the way.




As with many medical dramas such as Grey&#39;s Anatomy or ER, The Good Doctor has experienced its fair share of tragic main character deaths and exits. The narrative has pushed past the boundaries of the inner workings of the hospital itself and into Shaun&#39;s personal life, including his marriage to Lea (Paige Spara) in The Good Doctor season 5 and the birth of their child in season 6. However, the show is an ensemble effort, seeing intriguing plot threads for all of its characters. Audiences are eagerly awaiting The Good Doctor season 7 after season 6 ended with some major cliffhangers.

Though the Hollywood strikes forced The Good Doctor to miss its usual fall release time, season 7 of the series will nevertheless begin airing on February 20th, 2024. The Good Doctor joins a slew of other hit ABC series that were delayed beyond the fall season and into early 2024.






The Good Doctor was delayed due to the SAG/AFTRA strike which was resolved on November 9th, 2023.






 The Good Doctor Season 7 Cast 
          

Probably the most shocking The Good Doctor season 7 news has to do with multiple character exits occurring on the eve of the newest episodes. It has been confirmed that Danny actor Brandon Larracuente will be leaving The Good Doctor after season 6. Other Good Doctor cast changes are less clear, but it seems highly likely that Hill Harper won&#39;t be in season 7, because the actor has opted to run for Senate. On a more positive note, Freddie Highmore will be back as Dr. Shaun Murphy and he will be joined by a slew of returning actors, including:




 Actor  The Good Doctor Character   Richard Schiff  Dr. Aaron Glassman   Will Yun Lee  Dr. Alex Park   Chuku Modu  Dr. Jared Kalu   Will Yun Lee  Dr. Alex Park   Fiona Gubelmann  Dr. Morgan Reznick   Christina Chang  Dr. Audrey Lim   Paige Spara  Lea Dilallo-Murphy   Noah Galvin  Dr. Asher Wolke   Bria Henderson  Dr. Jordan Allen   



                  The Good Doctor: Where Else You&#39;ve Seen The Cast   The Good Doctor remains one of ABC&#39;s most popular shows, but many cast members will be recognizable from other movies and TV series.    






 The Good Doctor Is Ending After Season 7 
          

Even as the new season gets closer and closer, ABC has officially confirmed that The Good Doctor will end after season 7. Though sad, the news isn&#39;t necessarily surprising considering the important life events that Shaun has tackled in recent years. While a strong conclusion is still expected from the final season, Shaun and his contemporaries have grown enough over the show&#39;s near-decade on the air to leave on a satisfactory note. 



 The Good Doctor Season 7 Story Details 
          

The Good Doctor season 6 ended with several big cliffhangers that should be addressed early in season 7. Viewers should see Lea and Shaun bringing their newborn home, while Shaun inevitably questions Glassman&#39;s reasons for not being present at the birth. San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital will also be dealing with the aftermath of two major losses: Dr. Perez, who has left to receive support for recovery from opioid addiction, and Dr. Andrews, who chose his love for nurse Villanueva over being president of the board.




It seems as though the major plot threads that The Good Doctor will follow will be Shaun transitioning into the role of a father and how the new president will change San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. Both of these events will shake up Shaun&#39;s life considerably, as he isn&#39;t the best when it comes to facing change and transition. All in all, The Good Doctor season 7 is shaping up to be one of the most dramatic yet.
