# How 3 Iconic Action Stars Lost Out On Starring In The Simpsons


## SUMMARY 



  The Simpsons was a global phenomenon during its Golden Age, attracting A-list actors for guest appearances.   Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, and Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down a cameo on The Simpsons during its peak.   The missed opportunity on The Simpsons could have helped the action stars transition into comedy roles.

## Literature Review
Three of the biggest Hollywood action stars of the &#39;80s almost appeared in the same classic episode of The Simpsons, so why did all three drop out?




While many A-list actors would kill for a cameo on The Simpsons even now, three of Hollywood’s biggest action stars missed out on this opportunity at the height of the show’s Golden Age. The Simpsons is still a big deal. In its 35th season, the series commands an audience of millions, has aired more episodes than any other American prime-time scripted series, and has firmly secured a place in television history. However, it is sometimes hard to clarify just how huge The Simpsons once was. At the height of the show’s success, The Simpsons was a global pop culture phenomenon.




The Simpsons was huge in its early seasons and, as the show’s so-called Golden Age began around season 3, its critical acclaim and mainstream fame only grew. Before The Simpsons hit its many milestones, the series could book almost any guest star under the sun. The show still brings in famous faces regularly but, around this time, the likes of Dustin Hoffman, Ringo Starr, Danny DeVito, and Michael Jackson all lined up for cameos on The Simpsons. As such, it was not too surprising when The Simpsons season 5, episode 10, “$pringfield (or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)” was written with A-list stars in mind.


 Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, &amp; Arnold Schwarzenegger Turned Down An Appearance On The Simpsons 
The &#39;80s action stars could all have appeared in the same episode.
          

Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were supposed to appear together in this season 5 outing wherein Mr. Burns opens a casino and causes chaos for the eponymous family as a result. The Simpsons co-creator Matt Groening was told that if the series included Planet Hollywood in a plot, the three stars would appear to promote their restaurant chain. Planet Hollywood was subsequently written into a subplot for the episode, only for the show to be told that Willis, Stallone, and Schwarzenegger were too busy to appear. In what might have been a subtle jab at the stars, the episode’s eventual guest star played a self-deprecating role.




Legendary singer Robert Goulet appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in the episode. Tricked into performing at Bart’s illegal casino, Goulet was fooled into taking the gig when Nelson claimed that he spoke with Goulet’s agent. Episode writer Bill Oakley noted that Goulet was a rare guest star who was willing to make fun of himself during his appearance, offering the series more opportunities for gags. Ironically, this meant that although the episode was a rare instance of The Simpsons getting rejected by celebrities, the outing ended up being a standout fan favorite that could have effectively showcased Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis.



 The Simpsons &#34;$pringfield&#34; Episode Was A Missed Opportunity For The Stars 
The Simpsons could have boosted their careers in one big way.
          

The trio of action movie stars didn’t need much in the way of career assistance in the early ‘90s. Thanks to Die Hard, Willis was a superstar, while Stallone and Schwarzenegger had their roles in the Rambo, Rocky, Conan The Barbarian, and Terminator franchises to keep them busy. However, all three actors struggled with big-screen comedy roles. Schwarzenegger’s self-aware parody movie Last Action Hero was a flop, Stallone’s Stop!… Or My Mom Will Shoot was infamously bad, and even Willis’s Hudson Hawk proved the Moonlighting star couldn’t meld action and broad comedy. As such, The Simpsons episode that the trio rejected might have helped them transition into blockbuster comedy roles sooner.
