## Literature Review
Robyn Brown became the center of attention in the Sister Wives family as Kody Brown stopped treating his wives equally after he fell for her.




Kody Brown and Robyn Brown&#39;s romantic connection led to the downfall of the famous plural family and, in turn, of Sister Wives. Kody’s polygamist family started with him marrying Meri Brown in 1990 and then starting a spiritual union with Janelle Brown three years later. In 1994, Christine Brown entered the family, and everyone lived together with their 13 kids until Robyn entered the picture with her three kids. The duo courted throughout season 1, and Kody legally married Robyn by divorcing Meri in 2014 to adopt her children.




Christine didn’t exactly approve of Kody’s union. Robyn and Kody’s close relationship is one of the main reasons Christine decided to part ways with Kody. Robyn tried to talk with Janelle and Meri about how they would slowly disappear as a family, but Janelle walked out of the conversation and Kody&#39;s marriage. Robyn didn’t like being punished and blamed by people saying she was Kody’s favorite spouse. Meanwhile, Meri confirmed her split with Kody in a joint statement, leaving him and Robyn monogamous.

 Kody Wasn&#39;t Compatible With His Other Three Wives 

 




Kody opened up about his relationship with his first three wives, Meri, Janelle, and Christine, during the Sister Wives: One-on-One special. He revealed there was no love lost between them because he never had real feelings for them. Kody explained that the “experience” required him to have more than one wife. So, when Kody got into polygamy, he got married three times, blindly. He claimed he was “so anxious” to be living by the principle of plural marriage that he wasn’t “vetting” who he was marrying. He didn’t check his compatibility with any of his former wives, taking all the blame for the breakups. 

Now, Kody believes that if one is to marry, they should be married for “eternity” (as shared by E! News.) He told Sister Wives Tell All host Sukanya Krishnan, “You should start out in love,” boldly. Kody thought it was acceptable for him to be able to make up the “difference” in the case of all three wives. Kody noted that the gospel talks about loving each other, but he never “suffered in a fit of passion” in his relationships. Kody claims he had blinders on when going into his first three marriages.






 Kody Married Robyn Because He Loved Her 
         

Kody said that things were different with Robyn because he fell in love with her. Kody claimed he was choosing to be in a “Covenant of Love” with Meri, Janelle, and Christine. According to Kody, meeting Robyn gave him the kind of safety and vulnerability he had never experienced in his life. He wept with joy upon meeting her and didn’t stop for months. Kody expressed hurt at watching Christine and Janelle “trash talking” about him for two years on Sister Wives. He deciphered that they were talking poorly about him because he was guilty of not being in love.

Kody admitted that he did feel guilty because he wasn&#39;t in love with them. He believed they wanted to make him feel small, so they could feel okay while criticizing him on TV. Kody said that even though he wasn’t in love, he was loving toward them. Sometimes, he would also feel like he was in love because of the games he played, claiming this was him making an effort. Kody doesn’t find himself accountable for the “emotion” of not being there all the time. Meanwhile, Robyn said she did not know Kody only had feelings for her until “recently.”




                  Sister Wives Season 18: When Is The Finale &amp; How Many Episodes Are Left?   Sister Wives season 18 is one of the most dramatic seasons of the series thus far, but how many episodes are left until the finale?    

Robyn wondered if history was being rewritten when Kody confessed his love for her alone. She said she tried her best to not let her fellow Sister Wives go through something that was painful for them, even though Kody expressed his true love for her. Christine recalled the moment she realized Kody was only in love with Robyn was one of her first moments of heartbreak. She was sitting at the edge of her bed and watching a really giddy Kody getting ready to go on a date with Robyn. She realized it was at that point that everything was going to change.



 Janelle Disagrees; Believes Kody Has Simply Changed 
          




Janelle believes she loved Kody as much as she could. According to her, they were “much more in love” as the years went by. She didn’t think getting married young was an issue, but Janelle believes they failed to navigate through their relationship as they grew older. To Janelle, it was a very functional marriage. She does think that as both of them changed and Kody grew a stronger connection with Robyn. She finds it unfair to judge their growing years from that perspective because she knows Kody wasn’t the same person back then.

At the same time, Christine thinks Kody feels betrayed by her friendship with Janelle after she left him. She wants him to know what jealousy looks like. He wishes for him to see how hard it is when two people have a bond. “Janelle and I have an awesome bond and maybe he’s jealous about that bond,” Christine said. He thinks Kody is jealous that they co-parented. This change in dynamic “sucks” for Kody because now, he can finally see what being a sister wife is like. She knows that Janelle picked her over Kody because she can talk to her and knows that Christine will work things out with her.




Janelle and Christine have had their share of fights and disagreements, but in the end, they manage to work them out. “This is what it’s been like for 26 years. ‘Take off your blinders and look and see what it’s like for us,’” was Christine’s message to Kody.



 Kody Prioritized His Connection With Robyn, Says Meri 
          

Sister Wives star Meri is happy that Kody has found happiness with Robyn. “I think everybody should have that,” she added. While Meri says Kody has a “soul connection” with Robyn, she thinks he shouldn’t have prioritized that bond and put it ahead of the entire family. She knows that he’s happy with her, and he speaks about it quite often. Meri thinks it was unfortunate that the whole family had to “go by the wayside” to know Robyn was Kody’s favorite. She thinks Kody was capable of showing love and care for many people because of his large family, but he wasn’t doing it for reasons only known to him.






Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
