## Literature Review
Hannah Ferrier was the chief stew on Below Deck Mediterranean for the first five seasons. However, some seasons were more entertaining than others. 




Hannah Ferrier was a staple on Below Deck Mediterranean and has given the fans five amazing seasons; however, some are more entertaining than others. The series began with Hannah as the chief stew, and she stayed in that role for five seasons. She was beloved on the show for her witty comebacks and love-hate relationship with Capitan Sandy Yawn. The pair always seemed to be at odds with each other, which made every season captivating to watch. Besides her feud with Sandy, Hannah was known for stirring the pot but also being a great leader for the interior team.
However, Hannah&#39;s time on Below Deck Med was cut short in the middle of season 5. Hannah was fired by Captain Sandy after she found out through Bosun Malia White that Hannah had unregistered Valium and a vape pen on board. This allegedly went against maritime law, so Sandy was forced to fire Hannah from the season. Hannah&#39;s firing caused an uproar among Below Deck fans and Bravo viewers in general. No one thought her firing was fair, which caused a lot of backlash against both Malia and Captain Sandy. Hannah hasn&#39;t returned to the show since, but she did have a baby and got married after her final season of Below Deck Med aired.

 1  Below Deck Med Season 5 


 







Hannah&#39;s most entertaining season had to be her final season. Below Deck Med season 5 was Hannah&#39;s toughest, but she was able to entertain the audience. During her final season, Hannah was fired by Captain Sandy mid-way through the season for having unregistered prescription drugs on board. However, before Hannah&#39;s time on board was cut short, she had a few moments during the season that will always be remembered. At the beginning, Hannah wasn&#39;t too happy that she was reunited with Budgsy Drake, who she first worked with on Below Deck Med season 2.
Hannah made it clear to the audience that she didn&#39;t like Budgsy, and it was amusing to watch her witty comebacks in her confessionals. Hannah also developed a close relationship with Chef Hindrigo &#34;Kiko&#34; Lorran, who was also fired from the season. Their friendship became one of the best parts of the season early on. Later, when Malia snitched on Hannah after Hannah wouldn&#39;t switch cabins to make room for her chef boyfriend, Tom Checketts, Hannah&#39;s exit scene was one to remember. She walked off the boat while Sandy chased her, trying to talk to her, but Hannah didn&#39;t have any of it. Hannah left the series on a good note, entertainment-wise.





 2  Below Deck Med Season 4 
        

The second most entertaining season with Hannah was Below Deck Med season 4. The reason why this season was Hannah&#39;s second most entertaining was her distain for Chef Mila Kolomeitseva. While Mila was only on the season for the first five episodes, Hannah quickly developed an annoyance for her. Hannah could tell that Mila was not the chef she portrayed herself to be and made several hilarious side comments to her coworkers and in her confessionals.
Another reason why this season was one of Hannah&#39;s better seasons was the close friendships she developed with her stews. Below Deck Med season 4 introduced Aesha Scott, who&#39;s now the chief stew on Below Deck Down Under, and Anastasia Surmava, who Hannah is still friends with today. The three ladies had so much fun working together on board that the viewers could feel the comradery on screen. Since they were so close, they were all able to confide in each other, which made for some funny commentary. It was one of the first seasons where Hannah truly got along with her team.

 3  Below Deck Med Season 3 
        

Hannah is the reason why Below Deck Med season 3 was so entertaining. This season included Hannah&#39;s first ever on-screen boatmance with Bosun Conrad Empson. The two had an immediate connection; however, they were both constantly getting in trouble whenever they would interact on board. Captain Sandy would often complain about Conrad not doing his job properly because Hannah was a distraction to him.
This caused Conrad to distance himself from Hannah, which she didn&#39;t like. After distancing himself from her, Hannah developed anxiety as she didn&#39;t feel supported by the one person she thought she could trust on board. Hannah even had to take a day off to get over her bout with anxiety. Hannah&#39;s relationship with Conrad is what made Below Deck Med season 3 such an exciting and entertaining season.





 4  Below Deck Med Season 1 
        

Below Deck Med season 1 was an entertaining season for many reasons. Firstly, it was the first spin-off from the Below Deck franchise, and secondly, it was the introduction of Hannah as chief stew and a cast member. Viewers quickly fell in love with Hannah during this season as they saw her quick wit and headstrong personality.
During the season, Hannah tried to get a boatmance going with Chef Ben Robinson, who had appeared as the chef on the original Below Deck series. While nothing romantic ever blossomed between them, the two had a great working relationship and friendship that the fans enjoyed. While Below Deck Med season 1 wasn&#39;t Hannah&#39;s most entertaining season, viewers did catch a glimpse into what Hannah would bring to the show for another four seasons, and she did not disappoint.





 5  Below Deck Med Season 2 
        

Below Deck Med season 2 was an entertaining season overall, it was Hannah&#39;s least entertaining season. One of the main reasons why it&#39;s so entertaining is the love triangle between Malia, Chef Adam Glick, and Bosun Wes Walton. It became the center of the season, and Hannah was kind of left to the side. However, Hannah did what she always does to make a season entertaining, and that was with her witty commentary. Hannah wasn&#39;t afraid to give her thoughts on the situation, and everything she said was always spot on. This was likely the catalyst for Hannah&#39;s future firing in Below Deck Med season 5.
Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
