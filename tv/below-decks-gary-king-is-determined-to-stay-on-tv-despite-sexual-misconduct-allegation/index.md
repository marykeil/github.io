## Literature Review
Below Deck Sailing Yacht&#39;s Gary King may be staying on the Bravo series after sexual misconduct allegations were lodged against him earlier this year.




Below Deck Sailing Yacht’s Gary King may not be interested in answering to the sexual misconduct allegations that have been lodged against him, but fans are asking for his side of the story as he makes plans to return to Bravo’s screens. While Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 5 has already filmed with Gary involved, many were calling for his removal from the series after a detailed account of sexual misconduct was published by reputable news sources earlier in 2023. Gary, who’s been part of the crew since Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 2, was quick to deny any wrongdoing, but hasn’t truly answered to the allegations outside social media.




In a recent Instagram post, Gary shared a photo of himself from a trip to South Africa, captioning the picture, “Happy Sunday everyone :)” before replying to several of the comments addressing the allegations against him. With many fans discussing the allegations in his comments section, Gary replied to a comment that mentioned “a lot of accusations that have yet to be proven” to explain the situation before sharing, “I always remember that there are 2 sides to every story.”


 

In response, Gary shared, “clearly not in this day and age, everyone [believes] everything you see, no research nothing, quite sad to be honest.” Making it clear that he doesn’t like the fact that he’s being villainized, he feels without any base to the accusations, Gary’s response makes it obvious that he doesn’t feel he’s done anything wrong.





 Below Deck’s Gary King Lashes Out At Court Of Public Opinion 
          

While Gary isn’t issuing a public statement about the allegations, he’s discussing it often in his Instagram comments. In reply to @laurasartcorner250’s comment, “If it’s true you won’t be back on below deck, I’m not even sure I will be able to watch it,” Gary said, “well let’s just hope it’s not true then.” While the comments he’s posting aren’t always serious, it’s clear that Gary doesn’t have any problem speaking out against the people who don’t believe him. He even shared he’ll “definitely be trying to stay on…tv” despite the drama. Though it’s not clear if the sexual misconduct allegations are true, he has several fans in his corner.





 

Gary has been a fixture on Below Deck Sailing Yacht since season 2, when he was introduced as Captain Glenn Shephard’s First Officer. With years of yachting experience, Gary was helpful aboard the superyacht and his playboy ways were often played off as a joke on the series. During Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 4, however, fans were vocally questioning Gary’s behavior as he bounced between women and displayed some questionable behavior. After being removed from the BravoCon lineup in response to the sexual misconduct allegations, Gary’s reputation may be tarnished with the network despite the fact that he’ll be returning for Below Deck Sailing Yacht season 5.

Although Gary may not be answering to the allegations directly, he’s speaking up in a manner that makes it obvious he feels innocent. While it’s unclear what will happen moving forward regarding the allegations and other issues Gary’s faced, like his estranged relationship with Colin Macrae and Daisy Kelliher, fans will get an update on Gary during the upcoming season of Below Deck Sailing Yacht. Though it’s possible the allegations weren’t true, the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle of Gary’s story and the accusations themselves.
