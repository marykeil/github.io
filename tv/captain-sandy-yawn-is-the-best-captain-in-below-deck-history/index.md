## Literature Review
Captain Sandy Yawn made a few controversial choices over the years, but she&#39;s still among the most respected captains in the Below Deck franchise.




Captain Sandy Yawn from Below Deck Mediterranean has proved she’s an excellent Below Deck captain through her actions in the last seven years. The 59-year-old reality star debuted on the Bravo show in 2017. She replaced the former Below Deck Medcaptain, Mark Howard, and stunned many viewers with her exceptional management skills. Unlike the strict Captain Lee Rosbach from Below Deck, whom fans had grown accustomed to seeing, Captain Sandy gave a unique spin to the show. She brought dominant female energy, making the spin-off stand out.




Captain Sandy hails from Florida and grew up close to the ocean. She finished her earlier education at Brandon High School and acquired her maritime degree soon after. Captain Sandy dealt with many substance addiction issues in her early adulthood. However, she overcame them with sheer dedication and kept thriving at her job to become a Captain. In 2023, Sandy completed seven successful years on Below Deck Med and celebrated a life milestone. She got engaged to her partner, Leah Shafer, and announced the big news on Instagram in September 2023.

 Captain Sandy Has An Excellent Work Ethic 
          




As of 2023, Bravo has launched five successful Below Deck spin-offs with over five excellent captains. However, no one appears to be on the level of Captain Sandy, as she’s a perfect example of what work ethic and dedication look like. Sandy has helped countless crew members through her calm demeanor and inspiring attitude over the years. She doesn’t just work hard but also pushes her crew to excellence. Since 2017, many cast members like Hayley De Sola Pinto from Below Deck have revealed how Captain Sandy’s harshness has helped them become better workers and people.

Captain Sandy’s work ethic has always been a topic of discussion. In 2019, she opened up about it in an interview and revealed the real reason behind her work-centric mindset. She said (via Bravo), “my childhood was one of work, that’s why my work ethic is so strong.”  Sandy claimed she grew up in extreme conditions after her parents divorced. According to Sandy, she almost grew up like a “child slave.”






She had to feed seven horses, 42 dogs, and many farm animals around her six-acre land. She had to walk miles to get to her bus stop, go to school, and then work even harder after returning.






 Sandy Is The First &amp; Only Female Below Deck Captain 
         

Sandy stands out because she’s the only female captain in the Below Deck franchise. While it may not mean much to some, the sole fact that she’s a captain in the yachting industry proves she’s way better than most. According to Volygroup.com, the yachting industry is predominantly full of males. In comparison, only 17% of females are board directors, 4% are chief officers, and 2% are yacht captains. Captain Sandy’s hard-boiled career as a yacht captain for many years is a testament to her skills and prowess.






 Captain Sandy Successfully Overcame Alcohol Addiction 

 

A good leader always has a great backstory, and Captain Sandy is no different. She had a tough past and learned from her mistakes. When Sandy was very young, she became addicted to alcohol, which turned her life upside down. Not only did her addiction hurt her career, but it almost cost Sandy her life. She had to go to jail, overcome accidents, go through bankruptcy, and survive a heart attack and cancer. Sandy only made it because she overcame her addiction.

Captains like Lee, Kerry Titheradge, Jason Chambers, and more have been through tough situations. However, Captain Sandy has built her career after reaching the lowest of lows. In 2023, Captain Sandy celebrated a big achievement when she completed 34 years of sobriety. She used her milestones to encourage people and shared a motivational statement on X (formerly Twitter). She wrote, “I tried for yrs to stay clean &amp; sober. On August 29th 1989 something shifted inside of me,” adding that she now feels worthy.






 Captain Sandy Managed Chaotic Crew Members 
         

While all Below Deck spin-offs are drama-filled, Captain Sandy’s Below Deck Med is the most chaotic. She always gets the wildest crew members capable of sinking any ship. However, she doesn’t let anyone ruin her work and always steers the yacht to its appropriate destination. Over the years, Sandy has handled a lot of chaos but always produces a memorable charter. In 2023, she proved her excellence when Sandy replaced a hurt Captain Lee in Below Deck season 10. Despite not knowing the crew, she completed the season with confidence and only fired two crew members.

Captain Sandy’s last two seasons on Below Deck Med have also been chaotic. In season 7, she had to fix the issues between Kyle Viljoen, Natalya Scudder, and her former chief stew, Natasha Webb. In season 8, she managed the drama between Tumi Mhlongo and Natalya while improving Max Salvador’s rude attitude. Captain Sandy even broke her wrist while trying to help out with the deck team. However, the injury didn’t stop her from maintaining control of her boat, ensuring full communication, and assuring that things never went south.






 Captain Sandy Dealt With The Wildest Charter Requests 
          

Captain Sandy is the greatest because she has executed the craziest charters in Below Deck history. One of her worst charters happened during Below Deck Med season 3 when a group of women complained about everything. Those ladies tested Captain Sandy’s patience and mocked her every effort. According to Cheat Sheet, Captain Sandy talked to some fans in 2020 and revealed another crazy charter request. She shared that some guests once pointed to a map and asked her to take the yacht there. She said the place was “800 miles” in the wrong direction. The Below Deck captain didn’t feel pressured to abide by her guests’ requests.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
