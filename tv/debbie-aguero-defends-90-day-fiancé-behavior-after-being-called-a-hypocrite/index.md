## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé fans aren&#39;t happy with Debbie Aguero being a hypocrite on 90 Day: The Single Life while she&#39;s dating men her own age after Oussama.




Debbie Aguero revealed the major reason why she didn’t use her real age on dating apps in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. Debbie is a 67-year-old woman from Sugar Hill, Georgia. She was in a long-distance relationship with 24-year-old Oussama Berber during 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4. She had met Oussama when he was barely 20, and she was getting over her last divorce. Debbie wanted to move to Morocco and get married to Oussama despite their age gap. She did travel to his country but realized that Oussama was the one wanting a Green Card.




Debbie became a part of 90 Day: The Single Life after splitting from Oussama and looking for her next husband on dating apps, where she lied about being 10 years younger. Debbie posted an Instagram reel in which she advised her followers to be “open and upfront” with people to counter getting “mixed signals.”


 

She said that “we as adults need to be mindful that we’re not cruelly gossiping or starting bad feelings between people” without being critical or using words to bully others. Debbie wanted to spread the message of being “who we really are” with her followers, but someone told her, “Upfront means telling your real age Miss Debbie.”

 Debbie Aguero&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Dating Journey Explained 
          

Debbie told the fan that her intention was not to hurt anyone. “I immediately told him my real age and apologized,” she added. Debbie revealed that she couldn’t find a date when she put her “real age.” A different comment read, “Then you should have told the truth about your age!” Debbie admitted that she is not perfect, but she never intended to hurt anyone. “I see people deliberately become bullys to the broken. I am not a bully,” she added. Fans are reacting to Debbie’s antics in the latest episode of 90 Day: The Single Life. Debbie had vowed to never date younger men again after Oussama.

She went for a dancing date night and got paired with a man named Gabriel. However, the man, even though he was close to Debbie in age, was more interested in the younger woman dancing near them. She was reminded of her ex-husband and his wandering eye. Debbie decided to use dating apps next, where she met a man named Russ. They started chatting on text messages, and Russ wanted to take Debbie out on a mini-golf date. Debbie was excited about her date night but was scared because she’d told 60-year-old Russ her age was 57 and not 67.




Thankfully, for Debbie, Russ didn’t mind. He was appreciative of Debbie telling him the truth. She did make him feel awkward later by telling him about her relationship with Oussama, who was 43 years younger than her. Russ didn’t know what to do in the TMI situation, but he did show interest in meeting Debbie for a second date on 90 Day: The Single Life. Debbie did the right thing by telling Russ about her real age immediately, even though she feared being judged. It&#39;ll be exciting to find out whether Debbie manages to get into a full-fledged relationship with this man.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
