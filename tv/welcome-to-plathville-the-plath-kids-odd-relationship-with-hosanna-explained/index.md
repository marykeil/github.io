## Literature Review
There&#39;s not a lot of information about Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Hosanna Plath. Here&#39;s some potential reasons why.




Welcome to Plathville viewers have found Hosanna Plath&#39;s relationship with her family odd and strained, and their dynamic is still a mystery. The eldest Plath child is a gifted musician who doesn&#39;t participate in the family drama. However, why she&#39;s not involved at all has been questioned. As Welcome to Plathville season 6 begins development, it&#39;s time to revisit Hosanna&#39;s role in the Plath family.




Even though Welcome to Plathville fans haven&#39;t seen much of Hosanna, she left home when she was 21 and moved to Ohio to marry a fellow musician, Timothy Nobel. Welcome to Plathville viewers learned during season 1 that Kim and Barry fully supported their union. In fact, the entire family attended their wedding. Hosanna plays multiple instruments and travels around the country with her husband, performing gospel music. The couple welcomed their first child in 2022, another reason why curiosity surrounding Hosanna has experienced an uptick.

 Micah And Moriah Plath Aren&#39;t   To Hosanna 

 




Welcome to Plathville&#39;s Micah and Moriah Plath don&#39;t often speak with their older sister. Hosanna is presumably the only child of Barry and Kim who has continued to live a conservative lifestyle. In the last few years, Hosanna&#39;s older siblings have seen her only a handful of times, and fans find their sibling relationship strange. Moriah surprised fans by telling Us Weekly that it would be a &#34;hassle&#34; to stay in touch with Hosanna. Fans took to the comment section, with one noting that the family is &#34;so arm&#39;s length. It&#39;s sad.&#34;



 Hosanna Doesn&#39;t Want The Spotlight Of Welcome To Plathville 
          

There is a theory that Hosanna sought early marriage as a release from the strict lifestyle Kim and Barry forced upon their kids, as seen in Welcome to Plathville. Kim and Barry asked a lot of their older children. During Welcome to Plathville season 3, 16-year-old Lydia Plath was expected to cook, clean, and teach the little girls. As the oldest offspring, Hosanna could have been expected to do even more than her younger sister. The family members are not close, and their discomfort with one another can be seen during their musical performances.




Hosanna lives 870 miles away from her Welcome to Plathville family, and that 12-hour drive seems too much for any family members to take on. It is clear that Hosanna values her privacy and doesn&#39;t want her new life to be linked with her old one. Her distance may save her marriage, as the Plath family may have orchestrated Olivia and Ethan Plath&#39;s divorce. Hosanna and Timothy are happy to continue without the Plath family drama.
