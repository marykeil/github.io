However, the expert praises the film for accurately portraying the movement of the bow in slow motion, giving it a score of 8/10.

## Literature Review

An archery expert watches the Amazon scene from Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, explaining how realistic or not it is and rating the DC movie.




The Amazon scene from Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League gets analyzed by an archery expert. Among the many characters in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League are several Amazons who try to keep one of the Mother Boxes safe on Themyscira. DC&#39;s Amazons are fierce warriors, but it turns out that the movie might not be the most realistic when it comes to the depiction of one of their skills.




Insider has shared a video of traditional archery expert Jim Kent, aka Grizzly Jim, breaking down the Amazon scene from Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League.


 

According to the archery expert, a few details from the DC movie&#39;s Amazon scene are not realistic, such as the weight of the Mother Box on an arrow and how a character catches an arrow. However, Grizzly Jim did say that he thought 2021&#39;s Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League got the &#34;movement of the bow completely right&#34; with its use of slow motion. That helped the movie get an 8/10 score from the archery expert. Check out the full quote below:


That would be very heavy, and that would create a lot of weight on the arrow, so the arrow would probably just flop in front of her. And also, she&#39;s got to shoot it over her hand. But the thing I really like about that little section there is the way the bow moves.
Now, if you do happen to film a bow in slow motion, they are like a wet noodle. They are wobbling all over the place. It&#39;s fascinating to see when you see something like that in slow motion. And they&#39;ve got the movement of the bow completely right. That is exactly what a bow would do.
There are people out there that have claimed to catch arrows. When I have seen it done, it&#39;s kind of more stunts where the arrow isn&#39;t traveling particularly hard, isn&#39;t traveling particularly fast, and you sort of grab it out of the air. I&#39;ve seen it done like that. But in a true situation with a true bow, at a realistic poundage, I think you&#39;d struggle, unless it was at a very long distance, and you could sort of track it and whatnot. I mean, don&#39;t do it, because you&#39;re essentially shooting an arrow at someone, which is stupid, so don&#39;t ever do that.
I mean, they&#39;re dealing with some kind of fantasy elements there, but we&#39;ll give that one an eight, I think.
8/10





                  Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League: All Endings, Cliffhangers &amp; Setup Explained   Zack Snyde&#39;rs Justice League is a big 4-hour movie with multiple endings, cliffhangers, and set-up for films canceled years ago. Here&#39;s what it means.   


 Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League Has A Perfect Explanation For Its Inaccuracies 
          

While the archery expert gave the movie a good score at the end of his review, some inaccuracies from the Amazon scene were pointed out. Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League might not be fully realistic with its depiction of the Amazons&#39; bow and arrow skills, but that is not to the movie&#39;s detriment. Like Jim mentioned, the Justice League film has fantasy elements, and they impact the scene in question.

While the expert&#39;s comments are true to how archery works in real life, Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League does not need to play by those rules. The scene is all about the Amazons of Themyscira. Like Wonder Woman, the rest of the Amazons possess incredible physical abilities that are far above those of a regular human.




Any inaccuracies pointed out when comparing humans&#39; archery skills to those of the Amazons from Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League then would not make much sense. With the Amazons capable of performing super-human feats, it is easy to see how they could be able to catch arrows flying at high speeds or craft arrows that can withstand great weights. At the end of the day, the Amazon scene from Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League might only be partially based in reality, but it looks great and fits with the rules of the DC world.



Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League is available on Max.
