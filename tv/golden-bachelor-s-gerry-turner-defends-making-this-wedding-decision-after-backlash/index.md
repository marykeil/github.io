## Literature Review
Ahead of their wedding, The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist discuss the songs that could be played during the ceremony.




Gerry Turner from The Golden Bachelor unapologetically picked pop music for his wedding playlist, despite the criticism. The 72-year-old retired restaurateur made history in 2023 when he starred as the main lead of The Golden Bachelor season 1. He met 22 different women and aimed to find his true love. Gerry dated plenty of women on the show but eventually liked two. He adored fitness instructor Leslie Fhima and enjoyed his time with financial services professional Theresa Nist. After a long final two weeks, Gerry picked Theresa as his ideal partner. The two will tie the knot in January 2024.




In mid-December 2023, Gerry shared the type of music he had picked for his wedding with Theresa. He posted a photo of a handwritten note with a complete list of his favorite songs. Unfortunately, not everyone found his taste in music a good fit for the wedding. Some even claimed that Gerry’s playlist was terrible as it was full of modern pop music and didn’t include any classic hits. Recently, Gerry responded to his critics and revealed he didn’t care about their opinions. He said (via EW), “I’m not sure I need to defend anything,” adding that his list has his personal music preferences.

Gerry and Theresa also shared what songs they had picked for the wedding. Theresa shared, “I have to have Van Morrison,” hinting that she loves the legendary singer-songwriter from the &#39;60s. She also shared that Gerry would likely pick Pink, also known as Alecia Beth Moore Hart. However, Gerry surprised her by stating that it was a great pick but not a deal-breaker. He said, “I’m going to show up and marry the love of my life, and I haven’t found a deal-breaker yet.” The Golden Bachelor star then claimed he’s fully against offensive songs such as “I like big butts and I cannot lie.” He claimed it was a “big, fat no,” and Theresa agreed.


 

Like most of The Bachelor leads, Gerry has put his heart and soul into his marriage. While it isn’t his first rodeo, he seems excited about tying the knot with Theresa, as she’s the love of his life. Gerry also had a great connection with Leslie on The Golden Bachelor. He pursued her for a long time but eventually dumped her in the final two weeks. Gerry’s sudden flip blindsided Leslie as she truly cared for him. The fitness trainer has since claimed she has lost respect for The Golden Bachelor star and hasn’t fully recovered from the heartbreak.




Gerry is a better fit for Theresa than he ever was for Leslie. He had a more than eight-year age gap with Leslie. He didn’t look very impressed with her work life and nature. In comparison, Gerry only has a two-year age difference with Theresa. He liked how she seemed down-to-earth and didn’t show off on her social media. Gerry likely picked Theresa because she appeared to be a family woman. At his age, he probably wanted a woman like Theresa, who could match where he&#39;s at in his life now.



The Golden Bachelor Wedding airs Thursday, January 4, 2024, at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
