## SUMMARY 



  Brayden Bowers proposed to Christina Mandrell before The Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding, but he didn&#39;t steal the spotlight from Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist.   Brayden asked Gerry and Theresa for their blessing before proposing, so the backlash is unwarranted.

## Literature Review
Brayden Bowers is facing some backlash for proposing to Christina Mandrell at the Golden Bachelor wedding, but he didn&#39;t do anything wrong.




Brayden Bowers is facing some backlash after proposing to Christina Mandrell before The Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding, but he didn&#39;t steal the spotlight from the happy couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist. Brayden and Christina met online after he finished filming Bachelor in Paradise season 9. He returned home without a love connection, and eventually met up with Christina at a Tenacious D concert in Nashville. They&#39;ve been together ever since. Brayden&#39;s also developed a sweet bond with Christina&#39;s seven-year-old daughter, Blakely. During The Golden Bachelor pre-wedding festivities, Brayden and Christina made an appearance on the Gold Carpet together. After their interview, Brayden got down on one knee and proposed to Christina, who happily said yes.




During the proposal, Brayden told Christina that she made him feel that he can be unapologetically himself, and he had no doubts that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. Brayden added, &#34;And like Gerry said, it&#39;s like, you know, we have such little time. And Theresa ... I mean, they&#39;re the biggest inspiration. But I know that I want to spend the rest of my days with you.&#34; Although it was a beautiful moment, some viewers felt that Brayden stole the spotlight from Gerry and Theresa, but he didn&#39;t.

 Brayden Bowers Asked Gerry Turner &amp; Theresa Nist If His Proposal Was Okay With Them 

 




After Brayden and Christina got engaged, host Jesse Palmer revealed that Brayden had asked Gerry and Theresa for their blessing to propose. They said yes, and the rest is history. The backlash would be understandable if Brayden took the couple by surprise, but the fact that he asked them ahead of time, and they agreed, makes it fine that he proposed before their wedding. It was, after all, a television show during which many surprises should&#39;ve been expected by viewers.



 Brayden Proposed To Christina On The Gold Carpet Before The Wedding 

 

It&#39;s not as though Brayden stood up during or after Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding ceremony to ask Christina to marry him. The Gold Carpet was the perfect time for him to propose because it was before the wedding ceremony began. The amount of airtime devoted to Brayden and Christina was minimal compared to that of Gerry and Theresa, as it should&#39;ve been. Also, it was very sweet for Brayden to mention Gerry and Theresa and how inspiring they were to him during his proposal speech.






 Brayden &amp; Christina Werenâ€™t The Focus For The Rest Of The Night 
          

Brayden and Christina got engaged, and then faded to the background, allowing Gerry and Theresa to take center stage on the show. However, they weren&#39;t the only ones who were featured during the event. The Golden Bachelor contestant Natascha Hardee made an inspiring speech on the Gold Carpet, encouraging everyone to chase their dreams. In addition, Charity Lawson and Dotun Olubeko made the announcement that they&#39;ll be getting married in the fall of 2025. Brayden and Christina had their moment, which was relatively short in the two-hour event, and then they respectfully and graciously gave the spotlight to others, especially Gerry and Theresa.

It seems that, because Brayden and Christina were considered villains by some viewers on their Bachelorette and Bachelor seasons, that people will try to find fault with everything they do. If a fan favorite couple got engaged during The Golden Bachelor wedding, people would most likely be cheering for them. Bachelor Nation needs to accept that, since their seasons, Brayden and Christina have learned from their mistakes and matured. Brayden&#39;s proposal to Christina at the Golden Wedding was motivated by nothing but love, and he did nothing wrong by getting engaged to her at the event. They&#39;re wished all the best as they move forward with this next chapter of their lives.
