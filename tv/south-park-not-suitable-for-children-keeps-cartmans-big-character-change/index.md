Summary

  South Park (Not Suitable for Children) shows that Cartman is slowly becoming a better person.   In earlier seasons, Cartman was more of a villain, but in recent seasons and specials, he has shown glimpses of genuine heroism.   While Cartman&#39;s actions in the special were morally questionable, they demonstrated the potential for growth and could lead to interesting developments.  







While it is unlikely that Eric Cartman will ever become a full-blown good guy, the feature-length special South Park (Not Suitable for Children) proves that the long-running animated comedy’s antihero is getting better. South Park’s Cartman has been through numerous incarnations. When South Park first began in 1997, he was a crude and thoughtless character who often spouted bigoted views. However, in the show’s first three seasons, Cartman was only a little more vulgar and uncouth than his young friends, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny. When South Park season 4 began to embrace more socially conscious stories, Cartman became more unambiguously villainous.

While South Park season 27 might change this, seasons 4-26 frequently embraced Cartman’s status as an amoral monster. This was codified in the infamous season 5, episode 4, “Scott Tenorman Must Die,” wherein Cartman engineered a horrific public fate for his immature bully that includes eating his own parents, and delighted in the trauma he heaped on the title character. However, South Park season 26 started to turn his arc around, as the show began to treat Cartman as a less antagonistic figure. In earlier South Park seasons and specials, Cartman was an outright villain. However, in season 26 and 2023’s two feature-length specials, he&#39;s a somewhat heroic presence despite himself.




                  South Park Not Suitable For Children: 10 Best Jokes &amp; Quotes   The latest South Park special, South Park (Not Suitable for Children), is full of hilarious jokes that definitely aren&#39;t suitable for children.    


 South Park (Not Suitable For Children) Redeems Cartman 
Cartman Shows Genuine Empathy For Another Child
          

The ending of South Park (Not Suitable for Children) proved that, after a few instances in season 26, Cartman is still treating people slightly better. Not Suitable for Children’s uneven story sees Randy Marsh set up an OnlyFans account, while the children of South Park clamored to access a new energy drink. For most of the special’s runtime, Cartman goes out of his way to exclude and alienate kids who don’t drink this popular sports drink, Cred. However, in Not Suitable for Children’s ending, Cartman covers for his classmate, Clyde, and helps his socially challenged acquaintance fit in by providing him with this all-important beverage.




Of course, even Cartman’s sweetest actions are morally questionable. Cartman helps Clyde feel at home in school, but he only does so by leaving out other children who don&#39;t have Cred. While South Park hints at Cartman’s potential goodness in earlier seasons, these moments are always tempered by the show’s trademark cynicism. In the world of South Park, any good deed is marred by at least some self-interest, and Cartman’s decision to help Clyde blend in is partially motivated by his own desire to uphold the school’s social hierarchy. Cartman even admits that his Cred obsession is designed to exclude other children.



 Cartman’s Changes Can Help South Park Season 27 
Character Changes Have Redeemed Middling Arcs And Keep The Show Fresh
         

Cartman helps the unhinged Cupid Ye in South Park’s season 26 premiere, and he buries his beef with Kathleen Kennedy in 2023’s first full-length special, Joining the Panderverse. These surprising twists elevate two of the show’s otherwise middling outings, meaning this trend could be good for season 27. If, instead of just looking out for himself, Cartman becomes a more caring character in season 27, South Park can surprise even long-time viewers and keep its formula feeling fresh. South Park (Not Suitable for Children) pulls this off with Cartman’s unlikely kindness.
