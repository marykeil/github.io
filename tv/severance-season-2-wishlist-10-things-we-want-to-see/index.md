## Literature Review

Severance season 1 was an exciting introduction to what turned out to be a thrilling show. Severance season 2 should build on season 1â€™s narrative.






With Severance season 1 ending on a cliffhanger, some things should happen in season 2 of the show to shed more light on the mystery. After a successful season 1, Apple TV&#43; confirmed Severance season 2 will be renewed before the season 1 finale premiered in 2022. Severance season 2 was confirmed for 2023 but faced delays in production due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Now that the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strikes are over, director and producer Ben Stiller took to social media to announce that the second season of the exciting workplace thriller is currently in production.
Severance season 1 was one of Apple TV&#43;&#39;s most successful shows. The Severance season 1 ending was the perfect climax to a mysterious show that left several storylines that the second season of the series needs to explore. There are various intriguing theories that Severance season 2 can delve into that have the possibility of answering the questions that arose from season 1&#39;s ending.









 








 10  Gemma&#39;s Presence At Lumon Should Be Explained 
Gemma Is Still Alive
        

After Gemma&#39;s death, Mark was in a grief that was so deep that he decided to go through with the severance procedure to deal with losing her. However, it turns out that Gemma is still alive and is working as the Wellness counselor at Lumon Industries under the pseudonym, Ms. Casey. Gemma&#39;s appearance at Lumon is one of the biggest mysteries in the show. Severance season 2 should unveil the mystery of how Gemma ended up as part-timer at Lumon. Gemma could be the key to discovering why Ms. Cobel keeps such a close eye on Mark.





 9  The Purpose Of Lumon Should Be Revealed 
Lumon Industries Is A Mystery
        

Lumon is a mysterious company filled with secretive departments. Another interesting mystery in Severance is what happens at Lumon and what the company really does. It&#39;s not known whether it&#39;s there to fulfill Kier&#39;s goals or if there is a more nefarious reason for Lumon&#39;s existence. The employees in the MDR department toil away at their computers sorting out numbers, but the point of their work is still unknown. Other departments in the company, such as the Optics &amp; Design department and the Disposal &amp; Reclamation are also mysteries that Severance season 2 could shed more light on.





 8  Mr. Milchick Should Be Given A Backstory 
Mr. Milchick Is An Intriguing Character
        

Severance season 1 gave audiences a glimpse into the outside lives of some of Lumon&#39;s employees. However, Mr. Milchick, who is one of the most compelling characters in the series, does not have a backstory. Not much is known about him except that he is a loyal employee of Lumon who is determined to keep the company running. Severance season 2 should delve into the life of Mr. Milchick&#39;s life and unravel what his true motivations are. Mr. Milchick is an interesting and a seemingly multilayered character whose backstory could add more intrigue to an already captivating show.





 7  The Innies Should Use The Knowledge Of Their Outies Lives 
The Innies Could Have Their Memories Erased
        

The MDR innies are now armed with the knowledge of their outies&#39; lives. Some secrets, like why Irvin had a list of Lumon employees and Helly R. being an Eagan were intriguing discoveries. Severance season 2 should explore what the innies will do with this knowledge and whether they will be punished for breaking one of Lumon&#39;s most sacred laws. Helly R.&#39;s secret is particularly intriguing because she&#39;s an Eagan. Will she tell the other outies what she knows, or will she keep the information to herself in fear of them hating her? Alternatively, there&#39;s a chance that the innies might have their memories erased.





 6  Irvin And Burt Should Meet Again 
Irvin And Burt&#39;s Outies Might Know Each Other
        

It was clear from their first interaction that Irvin and Burt had a strong connection. However, Irvin retired before the two could develop a proper relationship. When Irvin&#39;s innie had a chance to glimpse into his outie&#39;s life, he discovered Burt&#39;s name on the list of Lumon employees and drove out to meet him before the connection with his outie was cut off. Severance season 2 should explore whether Irvin and Burt had a relationship before they were severed. Burt and Irvin deserve a chance to know each other better (if they don&#39;t already), especially since their relationship was short-lived.





 5  New Characters Should Be Introduced 
More People Might Have Gone Through The Severance Procedure
        

The severance procedure was portrayed as being limited to the people who worked at Lumon only. However, Devon&#39;s interaction with Gabby Arterta, Senator Arteta&#39;s wife who is an advocate for the severance procedure, showed that even people who do not work at Lumon can be severed. There is a need for the second season of the show to delve into whether other people have also done the severance procedure and why Lumon seems intent on keeping it a secret.





 4  The Revolving Should Be Explained 
Jame Eagan&#39;s Plan Should Be Revealed


 







The severance procedure revolutionized science and some people underwent the procedure with the assumption that it would make their lives better without fully understanding what the procedure could take away from them. When Helly R. was occupying Helena Eagan&#39;s body, she had an interesting encounter with Jame Eagan where he mentioned a revolving. Seeing that Jame Eagan has the demeanor of an evil scientist who has no qualms about pushing boundaries, Severance season 2 can delve more into what a revolving is and what exactly it entails.





 3  Ms. Cobel Should Have A Backstory 
Ms. Cobel&#39;s Motivations Should Be Revealed


 







Ms. Cobel had been a looming presence at Lumon who&#39;s motivations are not always clear. Ms. Cobel is one of the smartest characters in the show who is always one step ahead of the employees at Lumon. However, audiences do not have a clear idea of who she really is or her backstory. She seems to be overly involved in Mark&#39;s life, going as far as moving next door to him and pretending to be a lactating expert to get close to his sister. Ms.Cobel probably has one of the best backstories, and it would be an injustice to her character if it isn&#39;t explored in Severance season 2.





 2  The Board&#39;s Secret Identity Should Be Revealed 
The Board&#39;s Intentions Should Be Unveiled
        

The board members of Lumon have been in the background making decisions that affect the company using Natalie as their mouthpiece. The Board members were silent during their meetings with Ms. Cobel which made them even more intriguing. Various theories have emerged about who is part of The Board and why they are so determined to keep their identity a secret. Season 2 of Severance could shed light on who is part of The Board and what their motivations are in order to keep the show from stagnating.





 1  The Innies Should Discover More About Their Outies 
The Innies&#39; And Outies&#39; Lives Should Intersect Again


 







The innies working in the Microdata Refinement department at Lumon figured out a way to be present in their outies&#39; lives. When Mark, Burt, and Irvin ventured into their outies&#39; lives, they discovered things about themselves that created more mysteries than they solved. Seeing that the Severance season 1 finale ended before the MDR employees had a chance to find out why they had strange connections to Lumon, Severance season 2 should provide the opportunity for them to find out more. However, seeing as they were caught during the operation, it will be interesting to see how the innies can enter the outies&#39; lives again.
