## Literature Review
Following the climactic season 1 finale of Tim Burton&#39;s Wednesday, here&#39;s everything we know about season 2 of Netflix&#39;s Addams Family show.




The first season of Jenna Ortega and Tim Burton&#39;s reimagining of Wednesday Addams was a runaway success for Netflix, and Wednesday season 2 news has been coming in steadily ever since. Directed by Tim Burton, Wednesday’s first season follows Wednesday Addams as she’s sent to Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for supernatural “outcasts.” Season 1 primarily consists of the title character learning to adjust to her new school while solving a murder mystery that impacted her parents 30 years ago. 




Wednesday Addams may have already solved season 1’s main mystery by exposing Tyler as the Hyde monster and Ms. Thornhill, A.K.A. Laurel Gates, as the vengeful outcast killer, but there’s still more story to tell. As such, it’s more than likely that Wednesday will discover more Addams Family secrets and investigate her new stalker in another season. Here is all the news regarding Wednesday season 2.

 The Latest Wednesday Season 2 News 
          

After being delayed due to the Hollywood strikes the latest news on the Addams Family spinoffs sees Wednesday season 2 finally establish a production start date. Hampered by shooting delays, the long-awaited second season is expected to begin shooting in April 2024 as the production shifts from Romania to Ireland. In the same announcement, Netflix made it clear that Wednesday was a top priority along with the fifth and final season of Stranger Things. 






The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023. 






 Wednesday Season 2 is Confirmed 
          

Naturally, because Wednesday was such a smashing success for Netflix in its first season, the streamer wasted no time in announcing a second. However, the January 2023 reveal of Wednesday season 2 came before the eventual Hollywood strikes which put many productions on hold for the better part of the year. With the strikes out of the way, the show is expected to go into production in April 2024, though no release date has been revealed.



 Wednesday Season 2 Cast 
          




Wednesday season 1’s main cast will likely return for season 2, including the familiar faces that helped make it so popular in the first place. Naturally, Jenna Ortega is expected to return as Wednesday and Netflix has all but confirmed that fact by renewing the show for more episodes. Since they are expected to play a much larger role in season 2, the rest of the Addams Family is also expected to reprise their roles, including an undisclosed addition to the clan which fans haven&#39;t met yet. 

A full list of cast and characters that are due to return includes:

 Actor  Wednesday Role   Emma Myers  Enid   Percy Hynes White  Xavier   Joy Sunday  Bianca   Moosa Mostafa  Eugene   Catherine Zeta-Jones  Morticia Addams   Luis Guzmán  Gomez Addams   Isaac Ordonez  Pugsley Addams   Fred Armisen  Uncle Fester   George Burcea  Lurch   








 Wednesday Season 2 Story Details 
          

In Wednesday’s season 1 ending, Wednesday returned home for summer break only to receive threatening texts. The texts include images of Wednesday speaking to Tyler in the coffee shop and Xavier giving her a new phone, with Wednesday surmising that she now has her own nefarious stalker. Wednesday’s season 1 finale thus sets up a mysterious foe for the title character in season 2, suggesting Joseph Crackstone&#39;s plan to eradicate outcasts isn’t entirely over.

The final sequence of season 1 reveals Tyler can still turn into a Hyde, which hints he’ll come back for revenge in Wednesday season 2. The first season teased a potential romance between Wednesday Addams and Xavier Thorpe, which could finally come to fruition in Wednesday season 2.
