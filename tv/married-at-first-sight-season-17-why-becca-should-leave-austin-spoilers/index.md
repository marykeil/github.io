## Literature Review
Becca and Austin were Married At First Sight season 17&#39;s best couple. However, what Austin said to Becca was wrong and is a relationship red flag.




With Married At First Sight season 17 more than halfway done, Becca and Austin have run into some relationship trouble, and Becca should leave. Becca and Austin were the season&#39;s best couple. They have a similar sense of humor, which leads to great banter and a lot of laughs between them. While the couple had lots of positive moments, they had several serious issues, including their different views on religion and intimacy.




Becca and Austin&#39;s problems should have been obvious from the start when they refused to talk about serious subjects. Though this led to less initial conflict, it kept the pair from getting to know each other deeply and kept their relationship on a surface level. They also have different religious backgrounds, which could be a difficult challenge. Nonetheless, their biggest hurdle has been the fact that Becca wants to be intimate right away, while Austin wants to take it slow.

 Austin Thinks Becca Will &#34;Go To Hell&#34; 
          

One of Austin and Becca&#39;s biggest issues is their religious differences. Becca is Jewish but agnostic, while Austin is a devoted Christian. During the last episode, they ran into trouble when Austin told Becca that he would still be able to love her in this life, even if she ended up going to hell. When she and the experts questioned him further, he revealed that he grew up believing that non-believers would go to hell. Becca cannot stay with some very religious who believes she&#39;s going to hell.






 Austin And Becca&#39;s Other Issues 
          

As bad as their religious differences may seem, Becca and Austin&#39;s sex life is another reason they are a MAFS season 17 couple that should break up. Though the two are very affectionate with each other, they haven&#39;t progressed as quickly sexually as Becca would like because of Austin&#39;s resistance. If Becca can&#39;t get her needs met and Austin feels too pressured, this Married At First Sight relationship is doomed.



 Becca And Austin Said I Love You To Each Other 
          

Despite their various issues, Becca and Austin are the only couple from Married At First Sight season 17 who have said &#34;I love you&#34; to each other. Austin said it accidentally to Becca while groggily falling asleep. Becca understood that he wasn&#39;t professing his love for her, so she responded in an easy-going way by laughing and saying it back. This is a perfect example of how sweet and easy-going Becca is and why she can do better than Austin.
