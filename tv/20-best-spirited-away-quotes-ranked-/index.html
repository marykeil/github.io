  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From characters like Chihiro, Lin, and Haku, the best Spirited Away quotes reveal more about the Studio Ghibli movie&rsquo;s themes and message.</p>
<p>A spell-binding tale with themes of identity and the blurred lines between good and evil, Spirited Away is an entrancing adventure full of mystery and memorable Spirited Away quotes. The Oscar-winning masterpiece by director and animator Hayao Miyazaki follows a young girl named Chihiro, who is in the process of moving to a new town with her parents. They stumble into a mysterious Spirit Realm, where Chihiro gets separated from her parents. Chihiro adapts to this unfamiliar place while trying to reunite with her family.
The movie explores themes of growing up, memory, and consumerism, and these ideas are reflected in the dialogue. Spirited Away contains a fair few bizarre Studio Ghibli creatures based on folklore meant to indoctrinate Chihiro, rebranded Sen, into Yubaba&rsquo;s strange and mystical prison. Her two biggest companions become the river spirit Haku and bathhouse worker Lin. While the narrative zeroes on in Chihiro&rsquo;s experiences and arc, attention is paid to side characters and their memorable or wise Spirited Away quotes.</p>
<p>How Spirited Away Changed Animation Forever
Spirited Away is Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s most successful movie and one of the best Hayao Miyazaki movies, introducing elements that changed animation forever.</p>
<p>Watch Spirited Away on Netflix</p>
<p>20  &ldquo;I Finally Get A Bouquet And It&rsquo;s A Goodbye Present. That&rsquo;s Depressing.”
Chihiro</p>
<p>One of the best Spirited Away quotes serves as the perfect introduction to Chihiro&rsquo;s wise character before she enters the Spirit Realm. Chihiro starts Spirited Away feeling dejected. She has to move away from the life that she knows, which includes her friends, and though she has a beautiful gift from them, it only serves to remind her of her current situation. This highlights the loneliness and unexpected humor within Chihiro. It shows her childish response to the kind gesture, establishing the point from which she will grow throughout the movie.</p>
<p>19  “I&rsquo;ve Gotta Get Out Of This Place. Someday I’m Getting On That Train.”
Lin</p>
<p>On the surface, one of the best Spirited Away quotes from Lin could voice her desire to escape her current life in the bathhouse. It also serves a greater purpose. It&rsquo;s suggested that Lin has worked at the bathhouse for a long time, and she is skilled at her job. Because of this, the quote implies that Lin doesn’t necessarily want to escape the physical space of the bathhouse, but rather that she desires to build her own life. Additionally, this desire to leave gives Lin and Chihiro a common goal, allowing them to grow closer to one another.</p>
<p>18  “Come On! Quit Eating! Let’s Get Out Of Here!”
Chihiro</p>
<p>This marked the initial downfall of Chihiro&rsquo;s parents. It not only suggests Chihiro instinctively knew the food her parents were eating was not meant for them, but also serves as a way to show she is fundamentally different from her mother and father. Furthermore, there is something about this line children can connect with; a lack of parental understanding. Parents often don’t heed the warnings of their children. Ignoring Chihiro&rsquo;s plea soon proves to be a big mistake, as her parents&rsquo; greed leads to them being transformed into pigs.</p>
<p>17  “If You Make Sen Cry I Won’t Like You Anymore.”
Boh</p>
<p>Despite the initial distrust and prejudice Chihiro (Sen) experienced from the bathhouse staff and residents, there are individuals there who learn to look past their expectations and see Chihiro as the individual that she is. This quote comes from one of the most unlikely sources. Spoken by the baby Boh to his mother Yubaba, it also shows how much he has grown as a person from Chihiro&rsquo;s friendship. Boh defies his mother&rsquo;s expectations by siding with Chihiro, and by asserting his own will on behalf of someone else, rather than for selfish reasons.</p>
<p>16  &ldquo;The Radish Spirit!&rdquo;
Lin</p>
<p>This exclamation references one of the best spirits from Spirited Away, the Radish Spirit. It illustrates the exuberance of the characters in the film and the uniqueness of the characters Miyazaki creates. While most spirits are not the main characters in the movie, they do a great deal to flesh out the Spirit Realm. Some are resented by staff, some are benevolent, some come purely to test the staff, and some have darker motives. The Radish Spirit would later become an ally to Chihiro, and Lin&rsquo;s greeting of him shows that she doesn&rsquo;t fear him.</p>
<p>15  &ldquo;Quit Whining. It&rsquo;s Fun To Move To A New Place, It&rsquo;s An Adventure.&rdquo;
Yūko</p>
<p>Studio Ghibli characters are not known for being meek. Viewers only meet Chihiro&rsquo;s mother for a few brief scenes, but even in this short time, a clear dynamic is established between the parents and their daughter. Chihiro starts the movie as a demanding, upset child. Her parents have no patience for her behavior, not considering their big move from her point of view, and urge her to see the change as an opportunity. At the same time, this line hints at the huge adventure to come, though it&rsquo;s not the sort that Chihiro&rsquo;s mother imagined.</p>
<p>14  &ldquo;So, Your Name’s Chihiro? What A Pretty Name! And It Belongs To Me Now.&rdquo;
Yubaba</p>
<p>This Spirited Away quote comes from the antagonistic owner of the bathhouse, the witch Yubaba. It explains the premise of the film and how she keeps others under her control. After Lin leads Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch admits she took an oath to give anyone work who asks for it. However, this job comes with a catch. When Yubaba presents Chihiro with a contract, she quickly renames her Sen, declaring her old name belongs to her. Haku explains that taking away her name in Spirited Away and making her forget is how Yubaba traps people.</p>
<p>13  &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Need Any Help, This Place Is Full Of Soot.&rdquo;
Kamajī</p>
<p>When Chihiro arrives in the Spirit Realm, she is told by Haku to go to the boiler man and ask him for work. When she finally finds him, he curtly remarks he has all the help that he needs. The audience is then introduced to the soot sprites (also known as Susuwatari), soot creatures that look like small fluff balls with big eyes, and who previously featured in My Neighbor Totoro. One of the best non-human Studio Ghibli characters, they capture the whimsy of the Spirit Realm, showing that not everything in the place is scary.</p>
<p>12  &ldquo;Play With Me Or I’ll Break Your Arm.&rdquo;
Boh</p>
<p>Boh is Yubaba&rsquo;s giant baby son who she keeps locked away. Like the other Spirited Away side characters, Boh gets his own arc, and his current state of mind is easily guessed when, upon meeting Chihiro, he threatens her. When Chihiro first encounters Yubaba&rsquo;s monstrous offspring under a sea of blankets, he suggests that she should play with him, or else he&rsquo;ll break her arm. This quote is a stark representation of how much Boh grows in Spirited Away, from a shut-in antagonist to a loyal ally.</p>
<p>How Spirited Away Kept Hayao Miyazaki Out Of Retirement
Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki planned to retire in the late &rsquo;90s but decided to come back to directing for Spirited Away in 2001.</p>
<p>11  &ldquo;Thank The Boiler Man, You Idiot.&rdquo;
Lin</p>
<p>Soon after meeting Kamajī the boiler man, one of Spirited Away&rsquo;s characters with mythological origins, Chihiro meets Lin, the bathhouse worker. Initially, Lin gives Chihiro a hard time, insulting her intelligence and seeming displeased she will have to help her find a job. While it&rsquo;s a harsh introduction, it is similar to Kamajī&rsquo;s first words to Chihiro. Only a few minutes after he speaks these words, the boiler man protects her by claiming she is his granddaughter. This parallel points to the fact that Lin will soon become a friend to Chihiro.</p>
<p>10  &ldquo;We Don&rsquo;t Want Her. She&rsquo;ll Stink The Whole Place Up.&rdquo;
The Bathhouse Workers</p>
<p>Once Chihiro enters the Spirit Realm, she finds herself out of her depth. Although she gets her way into a contract to stay on and work, it doesn&rsquo;t do her much good when she comes face to face with her fellow workers, most of whom deliver some harsh quotes to her. Nobody wants to take Chihiro on as a co-worker, citing her foul human &ldquo;smell&rdquo; as the reason. This prejudice adds to Chihiro&rsquo;s feelings of isolation in the story but also motivates her to prove her worth as a hard worker so that the group will accept her.</p>
<p>9  &ldquo;This Is A High-Class Place I’m Running Here!&rdquo;
Yubaba</p>
<p>Yubaba has very few Spirited Away quotes that elicit laughter, but this is certainly one of them. While Yubaba explains the finer points of Chihiro&rsquo;s new job, she proudly declares she&rsquo;s running a high-class establishment and Chihiro should behave herself. The bathhouse can hardly be considered &ldquo;high-class.&rdquo; The establishment is also run by people who have been stripped of their identity. Regardless, it says a lot about Yubaba&rsquo;s character and points out the differences between her and her sister Zeniba.</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;I Promise I&rsquo;ll Get You Out Of Here&hellip;Just Don&rsquo;t Get Any Fatter Or They&rsquo;ll Eat You!&rdquo;
Chihiro</p>
<p>Spirited Away sees Chihiro learning to be independent. She landed in this sticky situation as a result of her parents&rsquo; greed. One of the best Spirited Away quotes refers to the fact that they refuse to stop eating at a sacred buffet intended for spirits, and, as punishment, are turned into pigs. The teachers in this tale are not the parents. Indeed, as is the case in many of Miyazaki&rsquo;s films, the parents are just as flawed as the children. In a way, this acts as an equalizer and sets up Chihiro as the protagonist - a complex individual.</p>
<p>7  &ldquo;No-Face, If You Even Put One Scratch On That Girl, You’re In Big Trouble.&rdquo;
Lin</p>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s clear about Lin is that she fears little. After Chihiro has made the journey from co-worker to ally in Lin&rsquo;s eyes, she takes Chihiro to the station to see Zeniba, but Chihiro wants to invite No-Face along. Lin vehemently protests this, as No-Face has only recently regurgitated all the food and workers he&rsquo;s eaten. The quote showcases just how much Lin has grown to care for Chihiro and her safety throughout Spirited Away, while she was initially annoyed and reluctant to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>6  &ldquo;If You Completely Forget&hellip;You&rsquo;ll Never Find Your Way Home.&rdquo;
Haku</p>
<p>Haku gives Chihiro a piece of paper with her name on it. Yubaba took Chihiro&rsquo;s name, decreeing that she would now be known as Sen, in doing so gaining control of her and preventing her from returning to her old life. Haku has forgotten his true name and doesn&rsquo;t want the same thing to happen to Chihiro. This quote illustrates one of several instances where Haku helps Chihiro, and also speaks to the mutability of identity, and how holding on to the identity that one prefers is not always a given but takes conscious effort.</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Believe You Pulled It Off! You&rsquo;re Such A Dope, I Was Really Worried.&rdquo;
Lin</p>
<p>Lin cares more for Chihiro than she originally intended to, leading to some of Lin&rsquo;s most heartwarming Spirited Away quotes. This is the case with many of Spirited Away&rsquo;s characters, showing that beyond assumptions and prejudice, real connections can be formed. Initially, Lin seems like a hardened worker with only her own interest in mind, but as the movie progresses, she is a kind person hoping to find a way to better her life. Lin&rsquo;s blunt treatment of Chihiro comes from a place of care, even if her words can seem thoughtless.</p>
<p>4  &ldquo;I Remember You Falling Into My River, And I Remember Your Little Pink Shoe.&rdquo;
Haku</p>
<p>One of the biggest triumphs in Spirited Away is that Chihiro keeps hold of her identity, and Haku regains his. Haku reclaims his identity of the Kohaku River spirit and affirms Chihiro&rsquo;s story that he remembers when she fell into the river to retrieve her little pink shoe. The fact that Haku saved her life many years prior and the love between Chihiro and Haku is one of the sweeter elements of the movie. No one expected that while trying to help Chihiro keep her identity, Haku would rediscover his.</p>
<p>3  &ldquo;Welcome The Rich Man, He&rsquo;s Hard For You To Miss; His Butt Keeps Getting Bigger, So There&rsquo;s Plenty There To Kiss!&rdquo;
Aniyaku</p>
<p>No-Face first appears as a mysterious spirit offering gold to the bathhouse workers. No-Face puts their greediness and selfishness on display. The staff try to please No-Face to earn as much gold as they can from him. No-Face, on the other hand, consumes everything around him but is never satisfied. He tries desperately to please Chihiro, implying that No-Face&rsquo;s initial gluttony is a symptom of loneliness. Ultimately, the character has a happy ending, finding a quiet life that suits his true nature with the witch Zeniba in the countryside.</p>
<p>2  &ldquo;Staying In This Room Is What Will Make You Sick!&rdquo;
Chihiro</p>
<p>Chihiro has surprisingly one of the wisest Spirited Away quotes when she confronts Boh over his captivity. Boh is convinced if he goes outside he will be exposed to deadly germs. He tells Chihiro not to touch him, declaring she will make him sick. This quote is Chihiro&rsquo;s reply, which signals a turning point in her growth as a character. The quote contrasts with the Chihiro that audiences were first introduced to. She learned exposure helps one grow, and she recognizes that Boh is being harmed, not protected, by being so coddled.</p>
<p>1  “Once You&rsquo;ve Met Someone You Never Really Forget Them. It Just Takes A While For Your Memories To Return.”
Zeniba</p>
<p>Spirited Away has ultimately a bittersweet ending. While Chihiro and her parents experience life-changing events in the Spirit Realm, they leave without retaining memories of them. Chihiro forgets those who helped her get there. However, one of the best Spirited Away quotes suggests these memories could return. Zeniba says this line to Chihiro, and it&rsquo;s relevant not only concerning the movie&rsquo;s conclusion but also about the lost memories and names of the bathhouse workers. It summarizes the movie&rsquo;s themes poignantly and simply.
