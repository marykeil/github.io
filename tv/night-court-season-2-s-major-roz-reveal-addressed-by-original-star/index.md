Summary

  Marsha Warfield appreciates that the Night Court revival casually reveals that her character, Roz, is gay.   The season 2 premiere of Night Court focuses on Roz&#39;s love life, with her suspecting her partner of cheating. However, it turns out to be a surprise for her, leading to a positive resolution.

Night Court star Marsha Warfield discusses season 2&#39;s Roz reveal. NBC&#39;s revival of the popular 1980s sitcom ended season 1 with Warfield reprising her role as Rosalind &#34;Roz&#34; Russell from the original Night Court. The recent season 2 premiere builds on that, highlighting Roz&#39;s reunion with John Larroquette&#39;s Dan Fielding and revealing details about Roz&#39;s love life.

In comments to TheWrap, Warfield opened up about joining the Night Court season 2 cast for the first episode and talked about how the show casually mentions that Roz is engaged to a woman. The reveal comes when Roz and Dan talk about her arrest for some rowdy behavior at a bachelorette party. In the quote below, Warfield talks about how she appreciates that the revival doesn&#39;t make a big deal of the fact that Roz is gay:


I’m grateful they made Roz gay and the way they handled it. Me getting thrown in jail is pretty big fanfare, but that’s not why she got thrown in jail. The fact of her engagement being to a woman was just a fact, the story doesn’t turn on that … I’m grateful that they care about the character enough to handle it that well.






 How Roz&#39;s Love Life Affects the Night Court Season 2 Premiere 
          

Roz&#39;s relationship with Loretta (Indira G. Wilson) isn&#39;t perfect, as Roz is worried that the woman she loves is cheating on her. She enlists Dan to help her uncover the truth, which leads them to appear before Judge Abby Stone (Melissa Rauch) after they take their sleuthing a little too far. Roz, much like Dan himself, is a bit annoyed by Abby&#39;s sunny demeanor.

In the end, however, it turns out that Loretta isn&#39;t cheating. She&#39;s instead planned a surprise for Roz. The experience helps Dan realize that he doesn&#39;t want to be alone. By the conclusion of the episode, written by showrunner Dan Rubin, with Pamela Fryman directing, Dan agrees to go back to being a public defender rather than remain a judge in Louisiana. This shows Roz&#39;s continued impact on Dan. 




                  When The Night Court Season 2 Finale Is &amp; How Many Episodes Are Left   Both fans of the original sitcom and revival newcomers alike are wondering when the Night Court season 2 finale is — and how many episodes remain.    

Warfield has said that she&#39;s open to returning to Night Court. Roz invites Dan to her wedding, which makes future appearances possible. In her first full episode in the revival, it&#39;s noteworthy that Roz&#39;s love life is an important plot point without the gender of her partner becoming a big deal in and of itself. As Warfield mentions, it&#39;s just a fact and a relationship that has its positives and negatives like any other.



Night Court season 2 airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC and streams the next day on Peacock.
