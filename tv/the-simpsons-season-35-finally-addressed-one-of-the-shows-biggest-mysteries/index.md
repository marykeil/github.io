Summary

  The Simpsons season 35 episode 2 hints at the possibility of characters aging, opening the door to more canonical aging.   While it is unlikely that the characters will start to age consistently or permanently, the episode shows that the series could age up its cast.   The Simpsons can excel at telling simple stories of family life when it acknowledges realities like children growing up.  





While The Simpsons season 35 didn’t necessarily commit to changing one of the show’s strangest patterns, episode 2 did at least address the mystery of the characters who never age. Since it first aired in 1989, the main characters of The Simpsons have remained the same age - with Maggie now a decades-old baby, and Bart and Lisa permanently stuck in elementary school. This is because The Simpsons has a so-called “Elastic canon.” This means that any given character’s backstory, age, country of origin, or name can change without warning solely for the sake of a gag. This is great for writers coming up with one-off jokes but can spell trouble for viewers trying to make sense of the show’s universe. 




While The Simpsons season 35 did not quite put a stop to this approach, the best episode of the season so far did address one major mystery that this narrative style causes. Viewers can understandably end up a little confused about the age of the titular family - especially when time-specific episodes, cultural references, and flash-forwards all contradict each other. However, The Simpsons season 35, episode 2, “A Mid-Childhood Night&#39;s Dream,” acknowledged this in a story that saw Marge face her empty nest syndrome.

                  The Simpsons: Bart&#39;s 15 Best Prank Calls To Moe&#39;s Tavern, Ranked   One of the best running gags in The Simpsons are Bart&#39;s prank calls to Moe&#39;s Tavern. But which are the best Bart Simpson prank call names of all time?    


 The Simpsons Addressed Bart’s Unchanging Age 
Bart Is Finally Leaving Fourth Grade 
         




 In “A Mid-Childhood Night&#39;s Dream&#34;, Bart’s teacher Rayshelle Peyton called a meeting about Bart entering the fifth grade, talking to Homer and Marge about how this is the next step to growing up. This sent Marge into a panic, a night of uncharacteristically heavy drinking, and a subsequent fear spiral about her son’s childhood ending (helped in no small part by her drunken consumption of bad hot dogs). The storyline is the central one of the episode, with no real secondary plotline to be found. This emphasis means that, according to the episode’s storyline, Bart will finally grow at least one year older in season 35. 

This would be tricky since The Simpsons would need to set the birth dates of the show’s main characters in stone for them to age. The Simpsons season 34 mocked this very idea with a playful scene where Homer nodded to the camera while trying to remember whether he was born in the ‘60s or the ’80s. Since The Simpsons doesn’t need to switch to an entirely serialized storytelling style, the characters could still at least have a few birthdays here and there- and not just the same one - like Bart and his repeated 10th birthdays.






 How Old Are The Simpsons? 
There Are No Set Birthdates, But Ages Are Roughly Consistent
          

As established, actual birthdates for the Simpsons family are not consistent - and timelines are also frequently changing. For example, various episodes of The Simpsons depict Marge and Homer attending high school in either the early 1970s or the late 1990s. In addition, Bart and Lisa were both young children during episodes that were canonically set in the 1990s, but later episodes depicted their teenage, unwed, childless parents attending high school in 1999. Throughout its 35 seasons, The Simpsons has simply used whichever timelines and dates would suit the current episode and storyline, trusting the audience to accept this. 

 The Simpson&#39;s Generally Accepted Canon Ages     Homer  38   Marge  36   Bart  10   Lisa  8   Maggie  1   






The patriarch of the family has one of the more confusing ages, though - as Homer is usually considered to be 38, but has ranged from being 33 up to 40. His age tends to change more often than those of the rest of the family, too - Bart and Lisa are very consistently stuck in their respective grades (except for &#34;Bart vs. Lisa vs. the Third Grade&#34; an episode where Lisa was moved up, and Bart was held back, leaving them in the same grade!), and Maggie remains the baby at a year old. 



 The Simpsons Season 35 May Change One Of Its Oldest Rules 
Characters Could Start Aging For More Than One Episode
         

It seems unlikely that the characters of The Simpsons would start to age after so many decades in stasis. However, the fact that the entire plot of “A Mid-Childhood Night&#39;s Dream” revolved around Bart getting older proved it is possible that the series could finally start to age up its cast, particularly when the episode was one of the show’s most poignant outings in years. In answering the mystery regarding whether the characters can grow older, The Simpsons has opened the door to more canonical aging.




This may also be a good thing for the show, as it would allow it to stay fresh, and start to tell different stories, as everyone begins to enter new stages of life - although likely at a much slower rate than they would in real time. Despite all of the show’s flights of fancy and its many Treehouse of Horror Halloween specials, The Simpsons remains great at telling simple stories of family life when the show does acknowledge realities like children growing up.

             The Simpsons The Simpsons is a long-running animated TV series created by Matt Groening that satirically follows a working-class family in the misfit city of Springfield. Homer, a bit of a schmoe who works at a nuclear power plant, is the provider for his family, while his wife, Marge, tries to keep sanity and reason in the house to the best of her ability. Bart is a born troublemaker, and Lisa is his super-intelligent sister who finds herself surrounded by people who can&#39;t understand her. Finally, Maggie is the mysterious baby who acts as a deus ex machina when the series calls for it. The show puts the family in several wild situations while constantly tackling socio-political and pop-culture topics set within their world, providing an often sharp critique of the subjects covered in each episode. This series first premiered in 1989 and has been a staple of Fox&#39;s programming schedule ever since.
