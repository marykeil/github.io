## Literature Review
One of the sweetest Superman and Lois Lane moments in Smallville is recreated by their actors, Tom Welling and Erica Durance, in a new DC photo.




Smallville stars Tom Welling and Erica Durance give life once again to one of their lovely Superman and Lois Lane moments from the DC TV show almost 15 years later. One of the most prominent Superman live-action TV shows is and always will be Smallville, which told Clark Kent&#39;s origin story before he became the Man of Steel. Had it not been for Smallville&#39;s massive success on The WB (before it became The CW,) something like the Arrowverse would most likely not exist today.




Since Welling and Durance are some of the most beloved actors to have played Superman and Lois in live-action, it is always a treat when they both attend fan conventions. As Welling and Durance were both attending the Creation Nashville event recently, Smallville fan Flannel_Coisfans shared a photo op of them where they had the two DC stars recreate Lois and Clark&#39;s dance from the 200th episode as they reconnected massively in the milestone installment.


 

Smallville&#39;s 200th episode, titled &#34;Homecoming,&#34; aired on October 15, 2010, and became one of the most prominent installments of the final season as it got Clark closer to his Superman destiny. It was also in this episode that Lois and Clark finally confessed their love to one another, leading to the soon-to-be-Man of Steel to levitate, hinting that he would soon start to be able to fly.




                  10 Smallville Moments That Prove Tom Welling Was The Perfect Superman   Tom Welling might have only become Superman in Smallville&#39;s series finale, but several moments from the series show he was the perfect Man of Steel.    


 Will A Smallville Revival OR Reunion Ever Actually Happen? 
         

Given Smallville&#39;s major popularity to this day, as new audience members are finding the show through home media release or on streaming, the question of whether the show will ever make a comeback still hangs in the air for many. As the TV industry doesn&#39;t shy away from revivals, sequel shows, or reunion series, Smallville is the kind of property that would benefit from getting another run. Crucially, when Smallville ended in 2011 with Clark officially being Superman, it left the door open to explore the next stage of his life.




Even the Crisis on Infinite Earths cameos in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover showed that there is more story to tell with these versions of Superman and Lois. Whether it would be exploring Lois and Clark as parents, expanding more on Smallville&#39;s Justice League, or doing a direct adaptation of the season 11 tie-in comic, Smallville is the ideal DC Elseworlds property to give some kind of revival, even if as a limited event series. In fact, prior to the 2023 Hollywood strikes, Welling was working on a Smallville animated revival with Lex Luthor actor Michael Rosenbaum, even though it&#39;s unclear if that project is still active.



Despite their Earth being destroyed in Crisis on Infinite Earths, Arrowverse producers have confirmed that the Smallville universe was restored in the new multiverse.




While DC Studios and Warner Bros. Discovery will obviously be prioritizing setting up their new DC Universe, Smallville would be an Elseworlds property that could draw in more eyes with an already established fanbase. The studios are definitely aware that Smallville has a major following, and it would be a shame if they didn&#39;t tap in to that crowd. Hopefully, whether it is in the immediate or distant future, Smallville will get resurrected in some capacity and continue the story of Welling&#39;s Superman.
