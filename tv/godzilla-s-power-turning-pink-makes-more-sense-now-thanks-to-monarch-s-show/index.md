Summary

  Godzilla&#39;s power changing colors from blue to pink in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is explained in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9.   The Hollow Earth energy source sought by APEX in Godzilla vs. Kong is confirmed to be blue, but there are other colors and forms of energy, including pink, in the Hollow Earth.   Godzilla&#39;s transformation in Godzilla x Kong may happen as a response to a loss in a fight, and he could absorb the energy required for the transformation in the Hollow Earth.  







Godzilla&#39;s power changing colors from blue to pink in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire makes more sense after Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9. Though it&#39;s not always the case, blue is usually the color of Godzilla&#39;s atomic power. Apart from his brief turn as Burning Godzilla in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, that&#39;s also been true of the Monsterverse&#39;s take on the kaiju. Interestingly, though, the next movie is poised to head in a completely different direction.

The Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire trailer has confirmed that Godzilla will adopt a brand-new color in his next big-screen outing. For the first time ever, Godzilla&#39;s atomic breath and dorsal fin glow will be pink. Apparently, he&#39;ll be going through some sort of metamorphosis in the movie that will explain the new look. The process was seemingly teased in the footage. As for what will trigger it and where this strange new power will come from, that remains open to speculation. There were no hints of what could be behind it in previous Monsterverse movies, but Monarch: Legacy of Monsters may be another matter.





 Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters Confirms Hollow Earth Has Blue &amp; Pink Energy 
          

In Godzilla vs. Kong, the mysterious Hollow Earth energy source sought by APEX was confirmed to be blue in color. That made sense, considering that Godzilla, whose origins are rooted in the Hollow Earth, boasts blue atomic breath. But based on scenes in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, there are other colors and forms of energy in the Hollow Earth. Curiously, pink was the color of the lightning flashes shown in the episode after May woke up in the Hollow Earth. They appeared again during the flashbacks to Lee Shaw&#39;s Hollow Earth experience in 1962.

With blue thought to be the primary color of the energy in the Hollow Earth, there were questions about how Godzilla could obtain pink power from evolving. Hollow Earth being the place where it would happen was always likely, considering that it is the original Titan home and a major part of the sequel. That said, his new design wasn&#39;t clearly connected to the Hollow Earth. However, the prominence of the pink color in episode 9 has indicated otherwise. From the looks of things, the Hollow Earth does indeed boast the tools needed for Godzilla to undergo his forthcoming transformation in Godzilla x Kong.






 Why Does Godzilla Transform In Godzilla X Kong? 
          

Of course, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters&#39; reveal that the blue energy source isn&#39;t the only type of power that exists in the Monsterverse doesn&#39;t completely solve the mystery of Godzilla&#39;s new form. Why he has to evolve in the first place has yet to be explained. One possibility is that it happens as a response to Godzilla&#39;s loss to Mechagodzilla (or an upcoming defeat at the hands of Godzilla x Kong&#39;s Skar King). Losing a fight may mean to him that he isn&#39;t strong enough. Whether that&#39;s the reason or its something else entirely, Godzilla could head deep into the Hollow Earth and absorb the energy required to transform.
