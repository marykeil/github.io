# Young Sheldon Season 7 Is Finally Fixing Missy After Wasting Her For 5 Years


## SUMMARY 



  Young Sheldon season 7 is finally giving Missy the character development she deserves after being overlooked for five years.   The spinoff has failed to fully capitalize on Missy&#39;s growing popularity, but season 7 is addressing this by expanding her role.   Missy&#39;s redemption arc and increased responsibilities in the family provide a compelling storyline, but with only 14 episodes, it remains to be seen if her arc will be fully redeemed.

## Literature Review
New details about Young Sheldon season 7 hint that The Big Bang Theory prequel is finally fixing Missy after wasting her for half a decade. 




After five years of wasting the character, Young Sheldon season 7 is finally fixing Missy. Despite only appearing in The Big Bang Theory twice, the only Cooper daughter was still able to make an impression with her witty comebacks and social capabilities, which were very different from Sheldon. Young Sheldon is benefiting from that brief but effective set-up, with Missy becoming an integral part of the prequel. Still, the spinoff has failed to fully capitalize on the character&#39;s growing popularity. This is so disappointing, especially since it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to give Mary and George&#39;s daughter a compelling arc.




When Young Sheldon was initially pitched, it was supposed to be the origins story of The Big Bang Theory&#39;s most popular character. Over time, however, it has diversified its storytelling, focusing more on Sheldon and the rest of the Cooper family. Everybody has gotten their respective storylines, with Sheldon&#39;s pursuit of higher learning, George&#39;s work struggles and Mary&#39;s faith issues, Meemaw&#39;s dating life and subsequent business venture, as well as Georgie&#39;s young family life with Mandy. Missy has gotten some storylines, but they aren&#39;t as extensive or interesting compared to the rest of the clan.

                  New Big Bang Theory Spinoff Will Break A Record That Young Sheldon Continued For 5 Years   Chuck Lorre&#39;s next The Big Bang Theory spinoff is expected to break a record that Young Sheldon continued when the nerd-centric sitcom ended in 2019.    


 Missy Gets An Expanded Role In Young Sheldon Season 7 
          




Young Sheldon season 6 introduced Missy&#39;s rebellious storyline — seemingly a reflection of how the character had been sidelined by The Big Bang Theory prequel&#39;s storytelling for at least five years. Feeling left out while Sheldon hogged all the attention, Missy started to misbehave, frustrated at being ignored after always being there for her family members. Admittedly, the series could have found better ways to utilize Missy in season 6, but it was better than being disregarded again. Come Young Sheldon season 7, however, it seems like Missy will finally be able to fully realize her potential, thanks to an expanded role.

Per the Young Sheldon season 7 premiere, &#34;Half a Wiener Schnitzel and Underwear in a Tree,&#34; synopsis, the family comedy will deal with the aftermath of the latest Medford tornado, which passed by the Texas town in the season 6 finale. In light of Mary&#39;s absence, Missy will step up and be the lady of the house as the remaining Coopers navigate their new set-up in light of Meemaw&#39;s house being destroyed. Giving Missy a purpose not only addresses criticisms of her not being fully utilized, but it also helps in terms of her redemption arc. Now, she has something to keep her busy, preventing her from further rebelling.






 Can Young Sheldon Season 7 Full Redeem Missy? 
          

In the Young Sheldon season 6 finale, Missy finally came to her senses and apologized for misbehaving throughout the year. She promised George that she would shape up — something that the season 7 premiere is setting up to do. That being said, whether Young Sheldon can properly redeem her at this point is questionable. Instead of the usual 22 episodes, The Big Bang Theory spinoff&#39;s final season will only have 14, and considering the sheer number of lingering storylines that it needs to tackle, Missy&#39;s personal arc may be one of the plots that would need to be dropped.

             Young Sheldon A spinoff of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon follows the youth and coming-of-age of Sheldon Cooper during his childhood in Texas as he pursues science and academia. The show also follows his parents, siblings, and Mee-Maw, painting a picture of the world where Sheldon grew up.
