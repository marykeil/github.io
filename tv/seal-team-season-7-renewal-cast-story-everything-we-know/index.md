## Literature Review
The long-running action series SEAL Team is concluding after season 7, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the final adventure.




The long-running action series SEAL Team is ending after season 7, and there are already many exciting updates about the show&#39;s last outing. Debuting in 2018, the series follows the elite Navy SEALs squad as they use their special skill set on many secret missions around the globe. Like most procedurals, SEAL Team finds a balance between the individual missions the team embarks on while also exploring the unique strain it puts on the team members and their families.




The fate of SEAL Team season 7 was in limbo for quite a while following the conclusion of season 6, and it has already taken an odd path to return to the air for the final time. Proving the popularity of the ongoing series, SEAL Team even survived a change of platform when it jumped from CBS to Paramount&#43; beginning with the second half of season 5. Amid all of those ups and downs, SEAL Team is riding off into the sunset after season 7, but that hasn&#39;t diminished the excitement around the upcoming episodes.

 SEAL Team Season 7 Latest News 
          

While updates have been coming slowly regarding the show&#39;s final season, the latest news sees series star David Boreanaz offer a filming update for SEAL Team season 7. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer star has played the lead role of Jason Hayes since season 1, and he shared on social media his acknowledgment of the show&#39;s last hurrah. Though a release date hasn&#39;t been established yet, the show&#39;s filming progress is a good sign that it might return sometime in 2024.





 



 SEAL Team Season 7 Is Confirmed 
          

The fate of SEAL Team season 7 was uncertain after the conclusion of season 6, especially with the announcement that the story would continue in a standalone movie. However, SEAL Team season 7 was confirmed in early 2023, several months after the sixth season concluded. The delay was unusual considering the popularity of the show, and the franchise was in limbo with a movie and TV show to consider. Then, SEAL Team season 7 was significantly delayed due to the WGA and SAG/AFTRA strikes of 2023. Nevertheless, more episodes are coming soon.






The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.






 SEAL Team Season 7 Cast 
          

Though no official cast list has been provided for SEAL Team season 7, it isn&#39;t hard to sus out who will be returning for the final episodes. Serving as producer and star, David Boreanaz will return as Jason Hayes, and he has a lot of emotional baggage to work out after the shocking ending of season 6. Boreanaz is likely to be joined by the usual roster of characters both on the team and in civilian life, except for Max Theriot&#39;s Clay Spenser who died in season 6.

Two new characters have been added to the season, with Beau Knapp stepping in as Chief Special Warfare Operator Drew Franklin, and Dylan Walsh as Captain Walch, a newly appointed commanding officer who is rigid but also has political aspirations.




The rest of the new and returning cast is expected to include:

 Actor  SEAL Team Role   Neil Brown Jr.  Raymond &#34;Ray&#34; Perry   Jessica ParÃ©  Amanda &#34;Mandy&#34; Ellis   AJ Buckley  Percival &#34;Sonny&#34; Quinn   Toni Trucks  Lisa Davis   Judd Lormand  Eric Blackburn   Raffi Barsoumian  Omar Hamza   





 SEAL Team Season 7 Story 
          

Though nothing has been officially revealed about SEAL Team season 7&#39;s story, there are threads from the last season that will need to be addressed. The death of Max Theriot&#39;s Clay Spenser was a shocking moment that will likely have sweeping emotional consequences in the final season, and may even factor into the story&#39;s overall conclusion. Also, the introduction of Captain Walch might spur conflict within the team itself that could threaten to tear the tight-knit group apart even in their darkest hour.






 SEAL Team Season 7 Is The Final Season 
          

SEAL Team season 7 is confirmed, but its arrival was also part of a major shakeup within the franchise. Not only is season 7 the final outing, but the announcement also saw the cancelation of the SEAL Team movie. It&#39;s unclear if the movie was meant to supplant the final season, but the timing is hard to chalk up to coincidence. Without the movie in the works anymore, SEAL Team season 7 will most likely offer a conclusive ending to the popular show, and possibly close the door to any more stories in the future.

               SEAL Team   Cast:   David Boreanaz, Max Thieriot, Neil Brown Jr.    Release Date:   2017-09-27    Seasons:   6    Genres:   Action    Network:   CBS, Paramount    Streaming Service(s):   Paramount&#43;, Apple TV&#43;, Prime Video    Directors:   Jason Cabell
