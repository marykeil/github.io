## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 cast member Rob Warne is accusing Sophie Sierra of being &#34;bougie&#34; and bickering when all she wanted from him was a duvet. 




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne is facing the heat for making a big deal out of Sophie Sierra asking him to buy a duvet for their home. Sophie is a 23-year-old British woman who works as a social media influencer and fashion content creator, while Rob, 32, is an aspiring actor and model. Sophie grew up in a wealthy household but became independent at a young age to start earning her own income. Meanwhile, Rob seemed to be facing financial difficulties and could only afford an apartment with no bathroom. Rob didn&#39;t appreciate Sophie asking him for an indoor bathroom and now has ridiculed her duvet request.




During 90 Day Fiancé, episode 11, Rob lashed out at Sophie for being &#34;negative&#34; first thing in the market and accused her of always &#34;needing something&#34; as pointed out by Reddit user u/RealityGays.


 

Fans who watched the episode on Sunday night didn&#39;t miss the chance to sound off about Rob&#39;s difficult behavior in the post comments. Redditor rach_rdh wrote, &#34;This man is like that super sh**** experience of the boyfriend you had in high school lol like the one you look back on now that your older and go YIKES!&#34;

 Sophie Wanted A Duvet &amp; Rob Called Her &#34;Bougie&#34; 
Meanwhile, u/kyliving67 questioned why Rob can&#39;t have a place with a bathroom, a kitchen separate from a bedroom, and a TV room instead of just a corner in his house when he&#39;s a decade older than Sophie and should have the &#34;basic decency&#34; to make his fiancé feel comfortable in a new country. &#34;He&#39;s so whiny and immature and just subpar in every way imaginable smh,&#34; posted StrangeMood315. Rob was in a &#34;horrible mood&#34; and woke up with an attitude just because Sophie asked him for a duvet. She did not sleep well.




Sophie was willing to live with Rob in the apartment but was asking him to do the bare minimum which Rob wasn&#39;t agreeing to do. Rob wasn&#39;t okay with changing the way he lived to accommodate Sophie&#39;s preferences. She asked him how her asking about a duvet was her being negative. &#34;I live here too,&#34; Sophie reminded Rob, and he told her that she could buy one herself. Sophie said that most people had a duvet at home. Rob claimed he was bothered by Sophie asking for a duvet because, according to him, what she wanted was a new house.

In reality, 90 Day Fiancé star Rob was upset because the first thing he heard in the morning was &#34;Buy me something.&#34; He claimed Sophie did not know what a duvet was because he already had three duvets at home. Sophie is tired of living in a small room with two people and a Pitbull. Moreover, Sophie also has to hear taunts from Rob about how she&#39;s too &#34;bougie&#34; for someone who doesn&#39;t have any money of her own. It&#39;s easy to see that Rob expects Sophie to get money from her family to fund her lifestyle, since he doesn&#39;t feel the need to buy anything for his future wife.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
