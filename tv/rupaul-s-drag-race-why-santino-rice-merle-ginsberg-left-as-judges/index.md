# RuPaul s Drag Race Why Santino Rice &amp; Merle Ginsberg Left As Judges


## SUMMARY 



  Merle Ginsburg and Santino Rice were temporary judges on RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race in the early seasons, bringing fashion expertise to the panel.   Merle&#39;s absence became a running joke on the show, while Santino left due to the show&#39;s shift towards drag culture, which wasn&#39;t his area of expertise.   Both judges played a vital role in launching the show, but their departure was a result of the show&#39;s evolution and their own career paths.

## Literature Review
Original judges Santino Rice and Merle Ginsberg left RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race over the years. Find out the reasons why each of them left the show.




RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race has aired 15 seasons, but the judging panel hasn&#39;t always looked the same, and Santino Rice and Merle Ginsburg had reasons to leave before the current seasons. Over the years, different guest judges go on to join the judging panel and give their points of view. However, there is always a core group of judges that Mama Ru refers to as &#34;family.&#34; As one of the most anticipated reality TV shows, there&#39;s always buzz surrounding RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race.




When RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race season 1 premiered on Logo, Merle Ginsberg and Santino Rice used to be the fellow main judges along with RuPaul. Because Drag Race was sort of a mash-up of Project Runway and America&#39;s Next Top Model, it made sense to have fashion-focused judges such as Merle and Santino on the panel. Merle had an established career as a fashion writer, while Santino was best known for competing on Project Runway. And yet, the judging panel changed significantly as the years went by.


 Merle and Santino Were Both Temporary Judges On RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race 
          

RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race season 3 added Michelle Visage as a main judge. This was by design, as Michelle was initially supposed to be a main judge on the show but was stuck in a highly complex contract that she could not get out of with a radio show. As such, Merle was always a temporary judge until Michelle could join. Meanwhile, Santino disappeared after season 6. The show was undergoing some transformation, and Santino lacked plenty of fashion knowledge but lacked drag wisdom.






 Merle&#39;s Disappearance Became A RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race Joke 
          

Merle&#39;s disappearance became a long-running joke on RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race, with an episode even parodying the events that led to Michelle joining the show. The season 7 episode &#34;Ru Hollywood Stories&#34; parodied fake explanations for how Michelle Visage sabotaged Merle out of her job. There is no bad blood between the two judges, and Merle is still working in fashion as a writer.

On the other hand, Santino never really spoke about why he left the show. As time went on, however, the show became less about fashion and more about drag culture and presenting drag excellence, which wasn&#39;t Santino&#39;s area of expertise. Since he left, he has focused on his veganism, 100-day fasting (which is excessive and unsafe), and questioning modern medicine. Santino has even taken a stance against the COVID-19 vaccine and is proudly anti-vax. It&#39;s probably best he isn&#39;t peddling his dangerous views in the spotlight anymore.




Santino and Merle helped launch RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race when it first started. Their personalities brought great perspectives to the judge&#39;s panel, and the show blossomed into the mega-blockbuster it is today. However, they&#39;re unlikely to return to the hit reality TV series and have moved on with their careers. There&#39;s no bad blood between anyone, and their departure is only due to the evolution of RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race and their careers.
