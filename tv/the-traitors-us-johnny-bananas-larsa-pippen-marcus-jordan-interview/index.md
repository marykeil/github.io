## Literature Review
The Traitors US season 2 cast members Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio, Larsa Pippen, and Marcus Jordan share about their experiences exclusively with us.




The Traitors US season 2 welcomed cast members Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio, Larsa Pippen, and Marcus Jordan and the trio sat down with us at Screen Rant to discuss their time on the series. After a successful first season for The Traitors US, the second iteration has been exciting to gear up for with an all-star cast of reality TV legends making their way to host Alan Cumming&#39;s castle in the Scottish highlands. The Traitors US season 2 invited a group of 21 reality TV and entertainment personalities into the game, changing things up after the first season featured a mix of reality TV stars and average citizens playing together.




With the different caliber of players joining The Traitors US season 2 cast, the stakes were higher from the very beginning of the competition. The series took the opportunity in the season premiere to introduce the traitors, a mixture of competition legends Dan Gheesling, of Big Brother fame, and Parvati Shallow from Survivor, as well as Bravo star Phaedra Parks, who moved from The Real Housewives Of Atlanta to Married To Medicine in recent years. With the traitors selected, the rest of the cast would play the game as the faithfuls, tasked with sniffing out the traitors before they get murdered.

With Dan, Phaedra, and Parvati working together to keep themselves anonymous in the group of faithful, the rest of the cast was left to try and figure out where the power truly sat in the game. For Johnny Bananas, who has been appearing with varying success on The Challenge for the last 20 years, his time on the series felt certain when he wasn&#39;t named a traitor. For The Real Housewives Of Miami star Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan, they knew coming into the game in a long-term relationship would already place a major target on them, but both were hopeful they could prove their worth in the game.




Screen Rant: Larsa &amp; Marcus, you came into the game together. In what ways did that impact the way you came into the game and how you played?


Larsa Pippen: I think us coming in as a couple, and the first couple, I think a lot of people were intimidated and I think we automatically had a target on our back. I feel like a lot of people thought we were going to unite and not go against each other, but we really had a conversation where we said, “hey, we’re going to play The Traitors the right way and we’re going into this as individuals,” like, “I love you, but if I have to murder you, I’ll make it up to you or vice versa.”
Marcus Jordan: Exactly.
Larsa Pippen: I think people really thought because we were a couple we weren’t going to go against each other, and we had this whole conversation before we even got to Scotland where we said, we’re here individually. I’m so excited to be playing this game with you, but at the same time, it’s an individual game. So I think a lot of people didn’t get that.
Marcus Jordan: We definitely had a target on our back, for sure.





Screen Rant: That’s a great mindset to take into the game, though.


Larsa Pippen: Yeah, you know – I kind of said, if you make it to the very end I’ll be happy for you, if I make it to the very end, like…we’re there to have fun and enjoy the experience.
Marcus Jordan: It’s like, Bananas, you on the other hand didn’t come in with a significant other, you came in with a big old target on your back.


Screen Rant: I mean, you did come in with C.T. [from The Challenge] – it’s a little different, but you had somebody.


Johnny Bananas: Did we, though? This is the thing we were trying to work through early on – when you spend as much time as C.T. and I have competing against each other, no matter what’s said, you’re like “do I actually trust what’s coming out of your mouth?” We’ve been on TV going back and forth now for 18 years, never once have we pointed our swords in the same direction. So we’re both sitting here like, are we actually doing this, are we really good? So, yes we came in together, and the only thing that’s keeping us both on the same page is like, we almost need to be with each other. We almost needed to align, and needed to protect each other because nobody else is. That was the one thing that kind of kept us on the same page, but again – C.T. and I have very different ways we play the game.
Obviously, he’s much better at keeping it calm, cool, and collected, lurking in the shadows, kind of playing a much more quiet, calm game. I can’t do that. It’s not even like an option, it’s like – I don’t have an inside voice. I’ve got one level and it’s loud – and that’s just kind of how I am when I’m on TV as well. But I knew coming in, even if I was able to dial it back and tone it down and I’m able to play this quiet game where I’m in the shadows and not talking, it wasn’t going to make a difference because that wasn’t going to change what I brought into the game with me – and that’s my track record in the past of winning competition shows. I think I was given a little more credit than I deserved, I think I was perceived a much bigger threat than I was. I had no idea what was going on, I had no clue who was a traitor and who wasn’t – dude, Larsa was way more dialed into what was going on than I was. I was just sitting around trying to make good TV and **** with Alan. I hadn’t even gotten an opportunity to play the game before I was gone.
Marcus Jordan: It happens.





Screen Rant: Obviously there was a little lack of trust with C.T., but if you could’ve come into this show with anyone from The Challenge, who would it have been?


Johnny Bananas: I think Wes [Bergman] would’ve been a great ally as well, I think besides C.T., I think Wes is totally cut out for this type of gameplay. I think he would’ve been a great choice.
Marcus Jordan: I’ve got my own suspicions about C.T., I can’t wait to see what happens.


Screen Rant: Last question for you guys. If you could do this season over, would you want to be a traitor or a faithful coming into it?


Johnny Bananas: Traitor, all day.
Marcus Jordan: We all came there wanting to be traitors – it was a letdown [not to be one].
Larsa Pippen: By the way, Alan should’ve did a better job recruiting the traitors.
Johnny Bananas: Yeah.
Larsa Pippen: I don’t think their team was all good. The three of us right here should’ve been the traitors.
Johnny Bananas: It would’ve been so good – no one ever would’ve expected it. No, here’s the thing – I had to be a traitor, because if I wasn’t, that was my only shot at survival. Because I can’t murder myself, so…
Marcus Jordan: We came in with a target on our back as a couple, so – hopefully there’s an all-stars and they invite us back.
Johnny Bananas: I came in with a target on my back, you guys came in with a target on your back, then they decided to put the three of us in an SUV together and make us all become best friends – so production set us up. And like they said about the traitors – god, could you have at least picked one person with an iota of a personality or entertainment [value]? I think if they had at least picked one traitor that had entertainment value, they wouldn’t have been so quick to murder us because they would’ve been like, oh, no, I actually like this person, they’re actually providing something to the show.





Screen Rant: Well, they did give you the beautiful gift of this friendship.


Johnny Bananas: Yes, and that’s – you know what? That’s worth more than the win.
Larsa Pippen: I will say our strategy was to go in and not be so social, not talk – just kind of stay under the radar. If I had to re-do it again, I would just shut the **** up.
Marcus Jordan: Definitely – we came in too hot! We came in too hot.
Larsa Pippen: I would just not be as vocal.
Johnny Bananas: Yeah, but it’s easier said than done – it’s always easier to go, “oh, I should’ve done this,” but Larsa, people like me and you, we don’t have that ability. We can say all we want, “I’m gonna go in and [keep quiet],” but once you get involved, once you get heated –
Marcus Jordan: Once the missions start…
Johnny Bananas: Exactly, once you get heated, it’s like – I’m very good at expressing my emotions, not bottling them up, so I wouldn’t even have [the option to keep quiet].
