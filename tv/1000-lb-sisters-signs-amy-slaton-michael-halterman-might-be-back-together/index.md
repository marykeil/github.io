## Literature Review
Amy Slaton and Michael Halterman finalized their divorce some months ago. However, recent TikTok posts by Amy hint at changes in their relationship. 




Recent social media posts by 1000-lb Sisters star Amy Slaton-Halterman hint she might be back with ex-husband Michael Halterman. Amy and Micheal have been the subjects of many news publications since the couple announced their divorce on March 13, 2023, after nearly four years of marriage. Amy and Michael&#39;s separation also occurred almost a year after they welcomed their second son, Glenn Allen Halterman.




1000-Lb Sisters season 5, which premiered on December 12, 2023, also documents the end of the couple&#39;s marriage and their many court meetings. Nonetheless, 2023 ended with Amy and Michael finalizing their divorce in October after six months of a custody battle over their sons. Amy also looked to be gradually moving on when she revealed she was dating again and subsequently showed off her new boyfriend, Tony Rodgers, on her social media. However, the relationship dynamics between Amy and Michael might have changed just days into the new year.

 Amy Shared TikTok Videos With Michael In 2024 

 




For 1000-Lb Sisters fans, the year couldn&#39;t have started with any more intrigue after Amy started sharing TikTok posts with her ex-husband Michael. One post that caught fans&#39; attention was a video montage of the couple&#39;s images with their kids over the years. The post tagged &#34;Random pt1 go down memory lane with me&#34; showed several pictures of Amy and Micheal looking very happy together at different stages of their marriage. Amy&#39;s decision to start the year off with a post of herself with Michael despite their messy divorce was quite surprising, and it also raised questions about the current state of their relationship.



 Amy Hasn&#39;t Been Posting About Her New Boyfriend 
          

After the trials Amy faced in 2023, it doesn&#39;t look like 2024 will be offering the 1000-lb Sisters star any break. At the backend of 2023, Amy couldn&#39;t stop showing off her new Tony, who looked to be getting along quite well with her kids. However, posts about Tony soon dried up on Amy&#39;s social media, and it wasn&#39;t surprising when she announced Tony had dumped her on New Year&#39;s Eve. Amy reportedly explained that Tony dumped her for &#34;a homeless b*tch,&#34; per TV ShowAce. Conveniently, Amy&#39;s TikTok posts with Michael were after Tony had reportedly dumped her, which slightly hints at a potential reunion between the two.






 Are Amy &amp; Michael Just Being Civil For Their Family? 
         

While several meanings can be read into Amy&#39;s posts with Michael, a reconciliation might still be out of the cards for the former couple. Despite what the TikTok post might&#39;ve suggested, neither Amy nor Michael has come out to say anything about them getting back together. Although Amy and Michael are divorced, the duo are still parents to sons Gage and Glenn, and their civility towards each other might be an attempt to co-parent the kids effectively. It is pretty evident that both Amy and Michael will struggle to care for their kids individually, and maintaining a united front will undoubtedly be good for the welfare of the 1000-lb Sisters stars&#39; kids.
