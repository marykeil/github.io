## Literature Review
Unpacking the facts behind Denise Richards&#39; perplexing feud with Erika Jayne at Kyle Richards&#39; weed dinner on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.




In the latest episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 13, devotees were baffled as former cast member Denise Richards made a return, sparking a heated exchange with Erika Jayne. Nearly four years after her departure, Denise joined the glamorous clique for a seemingly innocent dinner at Kyle Richards&#39; Encino home. Anticipation for a harmonious reunion quickly turned explosive when the attention turned to an uncomfortable interaction between Denise and Erika. Fans were left scratching their heads, wrestling with the hasty animosity between them, leaving everyone to ponder: What exactly sparked this intense confrontation?




Upon initially meeting, Denise found Erika to be sweet and lovely. However, behind the scenes, a different narrative unfolded. Erika consistently threw shade at Denise during the RHOBH season 10 green room interviews and even in the presence of other castmates when Denise was absent. Tensions escalated after Denise called out the group of ladies for inappropriate conversations in front of her children. In a snide remark, Erika suggested Denise&#39;s children might have already experienced threesomes. Observers condemned Erika for her inappropriate comment, sparking backlash - and until late, Denise carried resentment.


 Erika Felt Frustrated with Denise&#39;s Husband 
          

Erika and Denise hit a rough patch after she expressed frustration over Denise&#39;s husband, Aaron Phypers, getting involved in their issues, People reported. Erika cited differences in communication styles between men and women, saying, &#34;It&#39;s hard when husbands get involved because it adds another layer.&#34; Denise acknowledged her husband&#39;s possible misstep and apologized, clarifying his intentions weren&#39;t to cause harm. She expressed her desire to mend things and hinted at her husband&#39;s willingness to address the situation. Erika proposed moving past the conflict, emphasizing her separation of feelings toward Denise from opinions shaped by Aaron. Erika also accentuated her willingness to reconcile and not let external factors dictate their relationship.






 Denise Called Erika a &#34;Cold-Hearted B****&#34; 
          

After RHOBH season 10, Brandi Glanville alleged that Denise referred to Erika using a derogatory term, People reported. Fast-forward to RHOBH season 13, episode 7, during Kyle&#39;s cannabis-infused dinner party, Denise expressed missing her time with the ladies during a chat. However, the evening took a turn when Denise confronted Erika, recalling their initial amicable friendship followed by a shift in their relationship. Denise questioned what might have caused this change, leaving Erika puzzled. Denise refused to articulate an answer, telling Erika repeatedly to &#34;watch the show&#34; and revisit the conversation. Erika (and Kyle&#39;s guests) sought clarification from Denise but never received a straightforward response.

 Denise Accepted Erika&#39;s Apology at Kyle&#39;s Dinner 

 

The next day, Denise arranged a lunch meetup with Garcelle Beauvais, Sutton Stracke, and Crystal Kung-Minkoff to clarify her stance. She aimed to prompt Erika to acknowledge and apologize for the threesome incident. During their conversation, Denise expressed her desire for Erika&#39;s acknowledgment and apology without explicitly stating the reason behind her grievance. Despite the ambiguity, Erika took responsibility for her actions, apologizing to Denise - later admitting that she didn&#39;t understand why she was doing so. &#34;OK, Denise, I apologize to you,&#34; Erika said, to which Denise replied, &#34;Thank you.&#34; Yet, the unresolved tension leaves a lingering question of what might unfold when these two cross paths again.



The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
