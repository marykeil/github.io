## Literature Review

Smallville stars Tom Welling and Michael Rosenbaum discuss why Erica Durance&#39;s Lois Lane introduction scene in season 4 is so effective.




Smallville star Tom Welling discusses Erica Durance&#39;s Lois Lane introduction in the DC show with Lex Luthor actor Michael Rosenbaum. Smallville&#39;s unpopular season 4 is a key point in Clark Kent&#39;s journey, as he begins college, explores his Kryptonian heritage, and meets Lois Lane. Despite having several years&#39; worth of romance with Kristin Kreuk&#39;s Lana Lang, Welling&#39;s Clark Kent eventually finds his true love in Lois, as every version of Superman seems fated to do.




During an episode of the Talk Ville podcast, Smallville co-stars Tom Welling and Michael Rosenbaum reminisce about Lois Lane&#39;s debut scene. Welling highlights how effective her first appearance is, saying:


&#34;What I really liked about this is, look at the introduction of Lois Lane&#39;s character. You know... I mean, you learned so much about her in that car. She&#39;s on the phone, she&#39;s trying not to smoke that cigarette... Like, by the time - you don&#39;t even know who she is, no one knows who she is until she meets Clark and then he asks who she is. I mean we know. I thought it was really cool. I thought Erica made a splash. She really became someone who should be there.&#34;


                  Where Are The Smallville Cast Now, 23 Years Later   Smallville boasted an impressive ensemble cast, filled with actors who are still very prominent in the contemporary entertainment industry.

Tom Welling also goes on to say that he felt the same way about &#34;Jensen&#34;, referring to Jason Teague actor Jensen Ackles, who also made his Smallville debut in season 4. Both Erica Durance&#39;s Lois Lane and Jensen Ackles&#39; Jason Teague became important characters in Smallville since the moment they were introduced, with both of them allowing Clark Kent and Lana Lang to begin to take separate ways in life. Lois helps Clark investigate Chloe Sullivan&#39;s alleged death, and Jason Teague develops a relationship with Lana while working alongside his mother to find the Kryptonian stones of knowledge.

Jensen Ackles&#39; talent didn&#39;t go unnoticed by the studio, either. Ackles was the runner-up for Smallville&#39;s Clark Kent casting, and creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar didn&#39;t hesitate to cast him as Jason Teague. Jensen Ackles was a recurring actor throughout Smallville season 4, but his new starring role in Supernatural under the same studio took up his full availability. Having proved his skills in Smallville, all Jensen Ackles needed to become a star was the lead rlefole in a WB series. Soon enough, Ackles&#39; portrayal of Dean Winchester in Supernatural had earned him widespread praise.






Supernatural eventually surpassed Smallville in length. Smallville&#39;s 10 seasons aired from 2001 to 2011, while Supernatural&#39;s 15 seasons aired from 2005 to 2020.




Erica Durance and Jensen Ackles made an impression in and out of Smallville, as Tom Welling accurately predicted. While Ackles&#39; Jason Teague role was limited to one season before the actor departed Smallville in order to join the immensely popular Supernatural, Erica Durance&#39;s Lois Lane only became a bigger character as the show advanced. Six seasons after her introduction, Lois Lane and Clark Kent were engaged, which the Arrowverse&#39;s Crisis on Infinite Earths confirmed to lead to a long and happy marriage.
