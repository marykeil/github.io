Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 ends on a major Poseidon-based cliffhanger that is a massive departure from the book series, though one that works for the better. Throughout Percy Jackson and the Olympians thus far, several changes to the books have been made, although most have been minor alterations to better translate the source material to a new medium. Be it small tweaks in the show&#39;s timeline, better foreshadowing of future events, or further development of the show&#39;s characters, the book changes of the Percy Jackson show have been utilized masterfully.

Despite most changes from the original book being minor, Percy Jackson episode 6&#39;s biggest story reveal marks the most dramatic difference yet. At the end of Percy Jackson episode 6, Percy talks once again with the Nereid who appeared to him in the Mississippi River in episode 4. Under the sea at Santa Monica, Percy Jackson is given Poseidon&#39;s Pearls, magical items that will help him escape the Underworld. While speaking with the Nereid though, a bombshell reveal is dropped on Percy and the audience which changes the Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief book in a near-perfect way.




                  9 Magical Items &amp; Their Powers In Percy Jackson Explained   Percy Jackson and the Olympians includes a vast selection of ancient Greek magical items, each with their own unique abilities, powers, and owners.   


 Percy Jackson Missing The Summer Solstice Deadline Is New For The Show 
          

The major reveal in question is that Percy has missed the summer solstice deadline to find Zeus&#39; master bolt as of the end of Percy Jackson episode 6. In the episode, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover spend time in the Lotus Hotel and Casino. This establishment is a modern front for the lair of the Lotus Eaters, a group of Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek mythological creatures who use the fumes of the Lotus fruit to keep customers in a state of blissful ignorance forever.

This leads to the reveal that Percy and his companions were in Las Vegas for days rather than minutes, thus missing the deadline by which they needed to return Zeus’ master bolt. In the original book, however, Percy emerges from the Lotus Hotel a day before the solstice meaning he still has time to finish his quest. This is not the case in Percy Jackson and the Olympians which reveals that Percy&#39;s delay caused Poseidon to prepare for war against his brother Zeus, a war that could destroy both the mortal and magical worlds.






 Why Percy Missing The Deadline Is Such A Good Change 
          

While Percy missing the deadline is much more drastic and significant than the book, the change is actually a perfect one. The first reason as to why this is the case is because the reveal adds a subconscious feeling of weight, stakes, and tension to the final two episodes. Audiences will have it in their minds that Percy is quickly running out of time, making the search for Zeus&#39; master bolt all the more pressing.

Secondly, the change is better for Percy&#39;s character arc. Initially, Percy Jackson and the Olympians made it clear that Percy only accepted the quest to save his mother. However, this has changed somewhat over the course of Percy Jackson season 1 with aiding his dad becoming just as important to him as saving Sally. Even though the deadline has been missed, Percy&#39;s dedication to the quest shone through as he committed to seeing it finished. This proves Percy&#39;s bravery, courage, and moral compass in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, all thanks to the major deadline change from the source material.
