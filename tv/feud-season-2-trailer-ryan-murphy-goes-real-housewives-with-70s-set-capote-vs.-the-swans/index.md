## Literature Review
FX Networks unveils the first official full-length trailer for Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, which is season 2 of Ryan Murphy&#39;s anthology show.




The first trailer for Feud: Capote vs. The Swans has arrived. The show is the second season of the Ryan Murphy co-created anthology show Feud, which premiered on FX in 2017 with a season exploring the animosity between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, particularly focusing on their time making the movie What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. The new season revolves around writer Truman Capote (Tom Hollander) and his relationship with a cadre of New York socialites, featuring a cast that also includes Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chloë Sevigny, Calista Flockhart, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, and the late Treat Williams.




FX Networks has now unleashed the first official full-length trailer for Feud season 2. Check it out below:


 

The trailer opens with a line teasing that the world of New York high society is filled with “sex, money, and endless adventure.” However, that ideal quickly falls apart as the trailer, which bills the titular Swans as the “original Housewives,” devolves into a barrage of gossip, betrayal, adultery, and more, all dutifully cataloged by Capote.


 Feud Season 2 Will Bring The Drama 
          

This trailer is an expansion on the original Feud season 2 teaser, which was seemingly modeled after a Real Housewives intro. While the comparison might seem engineered to tie in with a popular media property, it is nevertheless entirely apt. The women in Capote&#39;s orbit lived lives full of chaos and interpersonal drama, and his attempts to turn that drama into a novel, which was first published as a series of chapters in various periodicals in 1975, ripped the fabric of his social life apart, landing him in hot water and leading to his banishment from high society.






Capote&#39;s unfinished novel, titled Answered Prayers, was eventually published posthumously in 1986.




The housewives at the center of Feud are quite literally real, and the cast that has been assembled to bring them to life seems perfectly poised to capture the darker side of the opulence of high society. Between them, the main female cast has been nominated for four Oscars and four Emmys. Watts is the most Oscar-nominated of the bunch, with a pair of nods for her work in 2003&#39;s 21 Grams and 2012&#39;s The Impossible.

They will also be joined by Murphy stalwart Jessica Lange, who previously portrayed Joan Crawford on season 1 of the show in addition to various American Horror Story roles. With such a cast and premise, Feud: Capote vs. the Swans promises to bring the high-stakes drama of Real Housewives to prestige television. As it has been translated to the 1970s instead of the modern era, the show will reveal the fact that the glitz and glamor of socialites has always been rife with drama.
