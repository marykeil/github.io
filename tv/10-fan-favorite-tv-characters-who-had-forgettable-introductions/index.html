Characters like Felicity in
Arrow

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Some fan-favorite characters, including Janice, Brittany, and Fonzie, were initially intended to be side characters and had forgettable introductions.</p>
<p>Some fan-favorite characters from popular TV shows have remarkably forgettable introductions, where they are first acknowledged with a casual comment or are simply seen standing in the background. Showrunners have been known to turn characters who were intended to only appear once into longer arcs due to their popularity. However, even some of these characters had memorable first episodes that made them popular.
What is more interesting is when a character who wasn&rsquo;t even intended to be important in the episode they were in becomes a fan-favorite. Some actors were only there by circumstance, or their characters represent a cliché of the setting that is not meant to be developed further. However, through the talent of the actors playing these characters and a little bit of luck, some of the best characters in TV history were created.</p>
<p>10 Gunther (Friends)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 2, &ldquo;The One With The Sonogram At The End&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friends<br>
Comedy
Drama
Sitcom</p>
<p>Friends is the popular sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, released back in 1994 and ran for ten seasons. The show follows a group of six twentysomethings through their lives in New York City and their time spent between their two apartments and their local coffee shop. The show features the group navigating tricky relationships with one another and comical misadventures.</p>
<p>Release Date  September 22, 1994   Cast Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer   Seasons  10   Where To Watch  Max</p>
<p>Gunther is first seen working at Central Perk in the second episode of Friends, but he does not say his first line until the 33rd episode, &ldquo;The One with Phoebe&rsquo;s Dad.&rdquo; He is seen in the background many times before he speaks. Gunther&rsquo;s character slowly grows through more interactions with the main cast. He is one of the most iconic parts of Friends, known for the running gags of his crush on Rachel and his blunt remarks. Yet few people can remember seeing him for the first time, or when his feelings for Rachel became clear.</p>
<p>9 Jeremy (Phineas And Ferb)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 1, &ldquo;Rollercoaster/Candace Loses Her Head&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeremy is introduced as one of the trope-reliant set pieces of Phineas and Ferb as Candace&rsquo;s long-standing crush. He first appears in the second half of the series&rsquo; first episode, working at the giftshop when the Flynn-Fletcher family visits Mount Rushmore for Candace&rsquo;s birthday. He appears in the next episode as well, fulfilling the similar role of prompting Candace to act smitten. From his clichéd beginnings, Jeremy is developed into a complete character. He turns out to be a caring friend and boyfriend and always participates in Candace and her brothers&rsquo; adventures.</p>
<p>8 Brittany (Glee)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 2, &ldquo;Showmance&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glee<br>
Comedy
Drama
Musical</p>
<p>In order to escape the stressful reality of high school, a group of misfits decides to join William McKinley’s glee club. Fox’s Glee was created by Ian Brennan, Brad Falchuk, and Ryan Murphy, with Leah Michele, Jane Lynch, and Matthew Morrison leading the cast. The series ran for six seasons between 2009 and 2015 and won six Primetime Emmys.</p>
<p>Release Date  May 19, 2009   Cast  Dianna Agron , Chris Colfer , Jessalyn Gilsig , Jane Lynch , Jayma Mays , Kevin McHale , Lea Michele , Cory Monteith , Matthew Morrison , Amber Riley   Seasons  6   Streaming Service(s) Hulu</p>
<p>Heather Morris first became a part of Glee as a dance instructor. She was then cast as Brittany, one of the cheerleaders, known as the Cheerios. Brittany first appears during the awkward Celibacy Club meeting in the second episode. She then comes with Quinn and Santana to audition for the Glee Club, and the three perform “I Say a Little Prayer” together. At first glance, Brittany appears to be just another cheerleader character, with most of the focus on Quinn and Santana. However, Brittany became a fan-favorite character for her unexpected kindness and the ironic full name of Brittany S. Pierce.</p>
<p>10 TV Characters Who Were Far More Complex Than We First Thought<br>
In any TV show, there are layered characters, but not every one of them makes that impression right away — Barney from How I Met Your Mother didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>7 Bernadette (The Big Bang Theory)
First Episode: Season 3, Episode 5, &ldquo;The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory<br>
Romance
Comedy</p>
<p>The Big Bang Theory first premiered on CBS in 2007 and became one of its era&rsquo;s most popular and longest-lasting network sitcoms. Running for 12 seasons, The Big Bang Theory focuses on a group of self-proclaimed nerds, Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon (Jim Parsons), Howard (Simon Helberg), and Raj (Kunal Nayyar), who form an unlikely friendship with their new neighbor Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The series became a ratings giant and took home multiple Emmys. The Big Bang Theory was so successful that it ended up spawning a spinoff titled Young Sheldon, which has also become one of CBS’ most popular sitcoms.</p>
<p>Release Date  September 24, 2007   Cast  Kaley Cuoco , Johnny Galecki , Jim Parsons , Melissa Rauch , Mayim Bialik , Kunal Nayyar , Simon Helberg   Seasons  12   Network CBS</p>
<p>Bernadette and Amy are notably the regulars of The Big Bang Theory who were added to the original main cast of five characters. While Amy is introduced with some fanfare, Bernadette&rsquo;s first appearance flies under the radar. Early in season 3, Leonard convinces Penny to find a friend for Howard, and she arranges for him to have a date with Bernadette. Their first date goes well, and Bernadette appears a few more times in season 3. However, they break up off-screen, proving that the writers never thought of her as a long-term character who needed a crazy sitcom introduction.</p>
<p>6 Eddison (Game Of Thrones)
First Episode: Season 2, Episode 1, &ldquo;The North Remembers&rdquo;</p>
<p>Game Of Thrones<br>
Drama
Action
Adventure</p>
<p>Created by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, Game of Thrones is a TV series based on the book “A Song of Ice of Fire” by George R. R. Martin. It tells the story of the ongoing battle between the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros - as they fight for control of the coveted Iron Throne. Friction between the houses leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the far north. Amidst the war, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night&rsquo;s Watch, led by House Stark&rsquo;s Jon Snow, is the first to encounter icy horrors that threaten all realms of men. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and quickly became one of the biggest event series in the &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; of TV. Winner of 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international fan base.</p>
<p>Release Date  April 11, 2011   Cast Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage   Seasons  8   Streaming Service(s) HBO Max</p>
<p>The Night&rsquo;s Watchman Eddison Tollet has a quick introduction in the Game of Thrones season 2 premiere, apparently having traveled with Jon and Sam from Castle Black and walking forward to tell them about Craster&rsquo;s Keep. The scene treats him like he has been there all along, and the audience&rsquo;s instinct is that he is a background character who is only being used for exposition. However, Eddison quickly gained more attention with his morbid, deadpan remarks. Eddison ends up becoming a member of Jon Snow&rsquo;s core group, also including Sam and Tormund Giantsbane.</p>
<p>5 Felicity (Arrow)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 3, &ldquo;Lone Gunman&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrow<br>
Superhero
Drama
Action
Mystery
Crime</p>
<p>After five years of being presumed dead, billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) is discovered alive on a remote island in the Pacific. Upon returning to his hometown, Starling City, Oliver beings to make amends for the selfish man that he once was. With a renewed sense of life, Oliver plays the role of a self-indulgent socialite during the day while secretly taking on those who corrupt the city at night. After running for eight seasons on The CW, Arrow ended in 2020.</p>
<p>Release Date  January 10, 2013   Cast  colin donnell , Paul Blackthorne , Willa Holland , Susanna Thompson , Katie Cassidy , David Ramsey , Stephen Amell   Seasons  8   Network The CW</p>
<p>Felicity is nonchalantly introduced when Oliver goes to her for help retrieving information from a destroyed laptop. Her role in the first episode does not go beyond this, and it was intended to be the character&rsquo;s only appearance on Arrow. However, Felicity was instantly popular, and she was brought back and eventually became a regular. She became a fan-favorite character as the show&rsquo;s resident tech genius and eventually Oliver&rsquo;s partner. Emily Bett Rickards went on to also appear as Felicity in The Flash and Supergirl.</p>
<p>4 Fonzie (Happy Days)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 1, &ldquo;All the Way&rdquo;</p>
<p>The famous Arthur &ldquo;Fonzie&rdquo; Fonzarelli doesn&rsquo;t even speak in his first few scenes of Happy Days. Fonzie was intended to be a side character who occasionally shows up for a joke — usually at the expense of another character with his downplayed reactions — but he became immensely popular. This led to Fonzie being upgraded to regular status, and essentially becoming the protagonist when Ron Howard left the show. In fact, the character became so popular that the network wanted to change the show to Fonzie&rsquo;s Happy Days. Henry Winkler opposed this, not wanting to completely overshadow his co-stars.</p>
<p>3 Luke (Gilmore Girls)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 1, &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke was originally intended to be a woman named Daisy, and even after the character became Luke, never more than the gruff diner owner, hence his casual introduction in the Pilot episode of Gilmore Girls. Show creator Amy Sherman-Paladino revealed (via Entertainment Weekly) that Luke&rsquo;s role in the pilot was so small that changing his gender was too simple: [The network] came to me and said we need another guy, so I literally just took a character and changed the name, didn’t even change any of the dialogue because I’m that lazy.” However, Luke became a regular character over time due to the chemistry between Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson.</p>
<p>2 Frasier (Cheers)
First Episode: Season 3, Episode 1, &ldquo;Rebound: Part 1&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frasier was first introduced as a love interest for Diane in Cheers, with no indication that he would become one of the most famous TV characters of all time. In his first appearance, Frasier sits quietly next to Cliff at the bar for several minutes before introducing himself to Sam, as the others are trying to convince Sam to see a psychiatrist. His first scene is mostly used to emphasize the tension between Sam and Diane after their breakup. However, Frasier became a popular recurring character, then a regular, then the star of his own show.</p>
<p>12 TV Characters Who Became Way Bigger Than They Were Supposed To<br>
Sometimes a one-off character, like Klaus from The Vampire Diaries, surprises everyone with their potential and gets a bigger role on the show.</p>
<p>1 Janice (Friends)
First Episode: Season 1, Episode 5, &ldquo;The One With The East German Laundry Detergent&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Janice is introduced, she gives the impression of being a one-time joke. Chandler and Phoebe are both on a mission to break up with their partners, Phoebe doing much better with her boyfriend than Chandler does with Janice. The writers bring Janice back a couple of times in season 1 and seem to have realized that they had a winning formula with Janice showing up unexpectedly, which became one of Friends&rsquo; best running gags. TV shows can last a long time and are comparatively more flexible than movies, allowing characters who begin as extras to become beloved stars.</p>
