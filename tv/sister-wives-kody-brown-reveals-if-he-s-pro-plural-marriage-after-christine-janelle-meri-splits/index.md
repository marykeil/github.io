## Literature Review
Sister Wives’ Kody Brown explains his true feelings about polygamy after falling into a monogamous marriage with his fourth wife, Robyn Brown.




After being monogamous for two years, Kody Brown from Sister Wives shares if he still believes in plural marriage. The 54-year-old Wyoming resident had been a polygamous man for more than 30 years. He married Meri Brown in 1990 and didn’t wait long before welcoming Janelle Brown and Christine Brown into his family. Unfortunately, things dramatically changed for Kody in 2021 when Christine left him searching for a more loving and fulfilled life. Janelle and Meri also followed suit. Unwillingly, Kody became a monogamous man and remained married to his fourth wife, Robyn Brown.




Recently, Kody reflected on his life and talked to People about his feelings. He said, “I don’t advise people [to] marry and go over three wives,” adding that he’s no longer an advocate for polygamy due to his failed relationships. Kody then explained if he was pro-plural marriage after his breakups with Christine, Janelle, and Meri. He said, “Now I’m 55 and I have all the experience and zero answers.” Kody claimed he had all the answers when he was 25 but no longer has much to say. He indirectly told everyone not to try plural marriage.

 Kody Brown Admits He&#39;s Not Interested In Another Wife 
          




Kody isn’t just warning others about trying polygamy but has also implemented the same in his life. The Brown family patriarch is no longer interested in plural marriages or polygamy. Instead, he’s happier with monogamy. In the Sister Wives: One on One special, Kody explained that he isn’t adding another wife to his family, even if it fills the void Christine, Janelle, and Meri left in his life. He said, “Now I know better,” adding that he wouldn’t waste another woman’s time since he now knows he wouldn’t love her as much as Robyn.


 

Kody’s current feelings about polygamy aren’t surprising. He once advocated for plural marriage and felt it was the ultimate way of living. He only cared about expanding his family without thinking of any repercussions. However, his recent breakups made him come to a realization. He felt hurt and learned his lesson. Kody doesn’t want to go through the same problems again. He isn’t looking for revenge and doesn&#39;t intend to expand his family. He just wants to build a perfect nest and live happily ever after with Robyn.




Kody’s lack of interest in finding another wife may also be due to Robyn. A few years ago, Kody had all he ever wanted. He had a huge family, dozens of kids, and four wives who loved him. However, three of them left him due to jealousy and other reasons. Now Kody only has Robyn. If he marries someone else, he may risk losing Robyn and endanger his chances of ever finding a partner. The Sister Wives cast member could fear being single or losing a perfect partner like Robyn forever.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
