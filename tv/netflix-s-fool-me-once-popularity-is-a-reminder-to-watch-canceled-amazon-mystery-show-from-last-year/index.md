## Literature Review
After watching Fool Me Once, one of the most popular Netflix series of the new year, one Amazon Harlan Corben series is the perfect follow-up.




The breakout popularity of the Netflix series Fool Me Once makes one Amazon series&#39; cancelation even more questionable. Since premiering on the streaming giant on January 1, 2024, the limited series, which is based on a book written by Harlan Coben, has maintained a top spot on Netflix&#39;s Top television shows in the United States list. Coben is an esteemed mystery and thriller novelist with nine original works having been adapted into Netflix series including The Stranger, Stay  , Safe, The Woods, The Innocent, Hold Tight, and Gone for Good.




Fool Me Once follows Maya Stern (Michelle Keegan) as she attends the funeral of her murdered husband only to believe she sees him days later on her toddler&#39;s nanny cam. This incident causes a wild turn of events that leads Maya and lead Detective Sami Kierce (Adeel Akhtar) down a dark road of secrets, lies, and potentially connected murders. The thrilling series, adapted by creator Daniel Brocklehurst, takes place over the course of eight episodes, all available to stream now exclusively on Netflix.

 Amazon&#39;s 2023 Show Shelter Is Another Harlan Coben Book Adaptation To Watch After Fool Me Once 
          

For fans who can&#39;t get enough of Fool Me Once, the Amazon series Shelter is a great follow-up watch because they are both based on thrilling mystery novels written by Harlan Coben. Shelter follows a similar premise to Fool Me Once in which the main character, Mickey Bolitar (Jaden Michael), starts to believe that his father, whom Mickey thought to be dead for years, is actually alive. Like Maya in Fool Me Once, Mickey must work to uncover the truth about who is living and who is dead while also maintaining his sanity.




Shelter, based on Corben&#39;s 2011 young adult novel of the same name, starred a mostly young and diverse cast with Michael in the lead role. The series also featured Constance Zimmer (House of Cards, BoJack Horseman)as Mickey&#39;s &#34;annoying&#34; aunt. The series opened up to mostly positive ratings, which makes Amazon&#39;s decision to cancel the show after one season somewhat odd, especially considering that Mickey&#39;s story extended over the course of three books including Seconds Away and Found.

Fortunately for fans of Fool Me Once, there are many other Harlan Corben adaptations available to stream now.
