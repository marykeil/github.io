## Literature Review
Solar Opposites season 5 is coming and here is everything known about it, including recent news, the cast, and the possible story.




Solar Opposites season 5 news is starting to arrive since the fourth season hit Hulu and left fans wondering what could happen next after the surprise ending. Lampooning the classic sitcom format, the animated hit follows a family of aliens who must seek refuge in middle America and find that they clash with Earth culture. Proving to be a success from the outset, the zany cartoon humor drew in fans of shows like Rick and Morty, but Solar Opposites blazes it own humorous trail as well.




However, fans might be wondering what the Solar Opposites season 5 story could possibly be about. The fourth season ended with an event that made it look like the entire series was finished, and the story was over. However, while that is how it looked, the show is coming back and Korvo and his family will remain a part of the story. The fourth season changed the premise of Solar Opposites, and that could lead to more changes in Solar Opposites season 5, including giving more screen time to side stories like The Wall and seeing the family in an entirely different environment.

 Most Recent Solar Opposites Season 5 News 
         

The most recent Solar Opposites season 5 news comes from supervising producer Sydney Ryan as she spoke to Screen Rant about season 4. The fourth season survived the controversy of Justin Roiland&#39;s termination, and the recasting caused by his departure from the animated series. Now, all eyes are looking ahead to Solar Opposites season 5. Ryan spoke about season 4&#39;s deft handling of the Roiland recasting when she said:





&#34;The only real writing change to the season was the addition of the Cold Open in the premiere episode to explain the voice change in the world of the show. You can actually tell that the scene right after the opening credits was the original Cold Open, but it still works great. [Chuckles] The voice change didn’t really require any changes to the Korvo stories this year, so it didn’t necessitate any rewrites.&#34;


Ryan also delivered a little bit of Solar Opposites season 5 news, making sure to reaffirm that season 4 isn&#39;t the end. With Solar Opposites season 5 already confirmed, Ryan said, &#34;The season 4 finale has bigger changes than we’ve ever seen before. I can’t reveal much about Season 5, but we’re already deep in production, and we have some really funny stories that fans are going to love.&#34;



 Solar Opposites Season 5 Is Confirmed 
          




While there were plenty of obstacles in the way of Solar Opposites season 4, including co-creator Justin Roiland&#39;s termination, Solar Opposites season 5 has already been confirmed. This confirmation happened long before Roiland ended up getting fired, but Hulu seems happy with the show. On top of that, supervising producer Sydney Ryan said that they are already &#34;deep in production&#34; on that next season. 



 Solar Opposites Season 5 Cast 
          

The biggest change to the Solar Opposites season 4 cast was Dan Stevens (Legion) replacing Justin Roiland as Korvo. He will stick around for Solar Opposites season 5 along with the rest of the main cast. Stevens will be joined by stalwart cast member Thomas Middleditch as Terry and Sean Giambrone as Yumyulack. 

Other expected returns include: 




 Actor  Solar Opposites Role   Mary Mack  Jesse Wearsprada   Sagan McMahan  The Pupa   Tiffany Haddish  Aisha   Christina Hendricks  Cherie   Sterling K. Brown  Halk Hogam   





 Solar Opposites Season 5 Story 
          

There are no clues about what the Solar Opposites season 5 story could look like. That is because Solar Opposites season 4 ended on what seemed to be a conclusive note. The big reveal at the end of the fourth season saw the Solar Opposites become human, and they mostly gave up on their desire to leave Earth. They even decided to forget about their original mission. However, they left Earth and took residence on a new planet, putting Earth behind them.




Though The Wall became a major fixture in season 4, season 5 will still most likely focus on the original family since producer Sydney Ryan confirmed they would be back. This could also play into the role of the Silvercops, who got a lot more screen time in season 4 as well. With the Silvercops and The Wall, there is a lot of fun to mine, but eventually. Solar Opposites season 5 will see the return of Korvo, Terry, Yumyulack, Jesse, and Pupa.
