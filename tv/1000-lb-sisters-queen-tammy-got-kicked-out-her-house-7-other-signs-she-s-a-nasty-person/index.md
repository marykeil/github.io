## Literature Review

1000-Lb Sisters star Tammy Slaton went to the dark side long ago, hurting the people who love her the most. Can she ever change her evil ways?




1000-lb Sisters season 5 is on the horizon (the new installment premiered on December 12) and &#34;monster&#34; Tammy Slaton&#39;s sure to wreak havoc onscreen. Like Godzilla razing the landscape, Tammy crushes anyone who gets in her way. Thanks to a dramatic weight-loss transformation, the cantankerous diva is a whole new woman on the outside. However, inside, Tammy may be roiling.
Tammy has an attitude. Thanks to her arrogance, which admittedly makes for amusing television, she&#39;s &#34;Queen Tammy.&#34; In real life, she&#39;s living with the reality of losing her ex, Caleb Willingham, who sadly passed away when he was only 40 years old. Since they split shortly before his death, she may be dealing with a lot of emotions. The stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. As she comes to terms with the fact that Caleb is gone, she could lash out. Her temper tantrums are explosive.

 8  Amanda Halterman Kicked Tammy Slaton Out Of Her Kentucky Home 
Amanda Halterman Couldn&#39;t Take It Anymore
        

Tammy was up to her old tricks at Amanda&#39;s Kentucky house, but the &#34;Queen&#34; went too far. The fights never stopped, and chances are good that Tammy initiated every single clash. Amanda must have longed for peace and quiet. After Tammy got the boot, her brother Chris Combs took her in. As per a source that talked to U.S. Sun, Amanda and Tammy are not a good combination:
&#34;They fight like cats and dogs.&#34; 

What&#39;s really shocking is the fact that Tammy got into a fight with Amanda during Caleb&#39;s funeral service. If that&#39;s true, and the information comes from the same &#34;insider&#34; who talked to U.S. Sun, that&#39;s incredibly inappropriate. Did Tammy start the fight with Amanda at Caleb&#39;s funeral? If so, what a terrible decision. Maybe her grief made her act out, but another scenario is that Tammy wasn&#39;t so grief-stricken. There&#39;s no way to prove that Tammy was past her grief at that event, but she had broken up with Caleb before he died, and maybe she just stopped feeling any love for him when that happened.
Tammy&#39;s so angry and &#34;out there&#34; that it&#39;s sometimes hard to know exactly what she&#39;s thinking. She seems like an awful human being, but what&#39;s really inside? If Tammy was grief-stricken at the funeral and got mad at Amanda over nothing, that would make sense. The other explanation, which is that she wasn&#39;t that heartbroken, and was all about Tammy at the funeral, is much more monstrous. Hopefully, that wasn&#39;t the case. Getting into a petty squabble at someone&#39;s funeral seems very cold-hearted.
Tammy reportedly left Caleb because he wasn&#39;t taking care of himself. They were supposed to be on a health journey together. What happened to Caleb is really very sad. At the wedding, he was sweet, romantic and hopeful. Unlike Tammy&#39;s exes, he actually seemed to love her. When he saw Tammy in her white dress, it seemed like all of his dreams had finally come true. Yes, it may be true that Caleb stopped following a strict diet and exercising, but that didn&#39;t make him a bad person.
Caleb is gone now. He&#39;s not here to tell his side of the story, but those who have dealt with Tammy in the past know that getting along with her isn&#39;t easy. Hopefully, she was kind to him before their marriage fell apart.





 7  Tammy Slaton Got &#34;Meaner Through The Years&#34; 
Tammy Slaton Hurts The People Who Love Her The Most


In the TLC clip shown above, Tammy called her long-suffering sister Amy &#34;lazy&#34; because she wanted to hire a home care nurse. Amy tried to stay calm, but some bitterness crept in. She said that Tammy would call her &#34;fifty times&#34; when she wanted food. At Reddit, 1000-lb Sisters fans don&#39;t hold back when they talk about Tammy, who acts like a spoiled brat. Tammy&#39;s antics make some fans angry. One Redditor, Over_Beat_7518, wasn&#39;t exactly doling out the praise. They really unloaded, saying:
&#34;Tammy is literally the worst human Iâ€™ve ever seen.&#34; 

While that may be too extreme, Tammy&#39;s not a gentle soul. Some people who are overweight don&#39;t feel confident, but Tammy loves herself, not that she shouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s refreshing to see a person who&#39;s obese loving themselves onscreen. When Tammy plays the diva, she&#39;s actually showing the world that people can love themselves whether they&#39;re big, small or somewhere in between. She undoubtedly has underlying psychological issues, but lots of thin people do too.
The fact that Tammy&#39;s a monster isn&#39;t about how many pounds she weighs. Ultimately, Tammy&#39;s a monster because she&#39;s mean. 

Life as a morbidly obese person isn&#39;t easy and Tammy&#39;s talked about that in the past. Now, she&#39;s had weight-loss surgery, but for years, she needed to function in a world that seems designed for thinner people. That&#39;s going to trigger a lot of frustration and rage. However, Tammy still needs to take responsibility for how she treats people. She picks on the people who love her. They are the only ones who are going to put up with her. They are the ones she should be the kindest to.
Before she wanted to hire a home care nurse, Amy was at Tammy&#39;s beck and call. She helped her sister all the time. When Amy became more independent, Tammy didn&#39;t like it. She was losing the person who ran her errands.





 6  Tammy Slaton Resents Amy Slaton, Who Stole Her Spotlight 
Tammy Slaton Wants To Be Number One


Life was very tough for the Slaton girls while they were growing up. They were extremely poor and their mother was often out of the home, trying to make ends meet. When their mom was around, she wasn&#39;t necessarily the most loving person. She&#39;s been very dismissive of her daughters and their goals. Sometimes, she seems as mean as Tammy.
The fact that the girls endured poverty together doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re always best friends. As women, Tammy and Amy fight, and Tammy went low after her wedding, accusing her sister of pretending to be drunk in order to get attention. The wedding had some strange vibes, as seen above, via a clip from TLC at YouTube.
Amy and Tammy used to eat junk food as children because they had to fend for themselves. The wrong food was cheap and easy to find. This led to weight gain that eventually put their lives at risk. Also, they were emotional eaters - the siblings gorged on carb-laden meals and sugary snacks because something was missing in their lives. They weren&#39;t being loved and cared for. That wasn&#39;t their fault - at that age, they didn&#39;t know any better.
Now, they&#39;re bringing their issues into adulthood. Amy didn&#39;t look happy at Tammy&#39;s wedding, and perhaps she stood out too much because she opted for purple hair with an orange dress. This creative look stole the spotlight from her sister. However, Amy, who swigged from a bottle of non-alcoholic wine during the event, but seemed inebriated, may simply have been worried about her sister. Tammy really rushed into marriage. She moved too fast and the marriage ended quickly. Maybe Amy snuck out of the &#34;dry&#34; event to sip on something a little stronger. She may not have been acting out her tipsiness.
Tammy&#39;s too quick to judge her sister. Onscreen, Amy doesn&#39;t seem like a bad person at all. She seems like someone who can love other people. She dreamed of being a mom, and she was strong enough to qualify for weight-loss surgery. Part of the reason she wanted the operation was, so it would be easier and safer for her to conceive. Amy adores her children. If Tammy was kinder to the sister who&#39;s bent over backwards for her, she wouldn&#39;t seem like such a monster.





 5  Tammy Slaton Is Too Dependent On Other People (Including Amy Slaton) 
Tammy Slaton Needs To Stand On Her Own Two Feet


 







Amy has issues and flaws, but she&#39;s inspiring too. She&#39;s trying to improve her life. Amy&#39;s showing some strength and becoming more empowered. Meanwhile, Tammy&#39;s still dependent. Hopefully, her bariatric surgery will give her the tools to become more like her sister.
In past seasons, Tammy was very dependent. Perhaps she really was lazy, but it&#39;s more likely that her weight gain was simply out of control, making normal life impossible. Her hunger, rooted in psychological problems, was an addiction. So, she wanted food constantly, but the damage she&#39;d done to her body meant that going out to get it was a big problem. She needed other people to do that for her, and maybe she wished she could be more independent. She might be so bristly with others because it touches a nerve when she has to ask for help. No one likes to be that helpless.
Nonetheless, she had everyone running around for her, taking care of her business. She wasn&#39;t particularly grateful either. In fact, she verbally abused her helpers. Tammy&#39;s got a lot of growing up to do. She&#39;s very immature, and maybe fame&#39;s gone to her head.





 4  Tammy Slaton Keeps Risking Her Health 
Is Tammy Slaton Headed For Disaster?


 







Addiction is a beast, and it can bring a person to their knees. Tammy&#39;s into overeating, but it&#39;s more of a compulsion than a guilty pleasure. Also, she&#39;s been known to smoke and drink. She&#39;s been known to bail out on the strict diet plans she&#39;s supposed to follow. She was even spotted at Wal-Mart, vaping while using an oxygen tank. Obviously, this stuff is very troubling. Her weaknesses may catch up to her - hopefully, they will not.
The problem is that weight loss surgery isn&#39;t the ultimate cure for emotional eating. It&#39;s a way to lose a lot of weight quickly, but keeping it off requires discipline. There are rules that bariatric surgery patients need to follow after their operations, or they will regain weight. Of course, when people backslide and the pounds pile on, it takes a psychological toll. It feels like such a failure. Surgery is anything but fun, and having it to get a specific result, and then finding oneself back at point A, is like a &#34;snakes and ladders&#34; nightmare.
Tammy needs to be strong to keep her weight-loss results intact. However, her track record is poor. Tammy&#39;s party energy leads her astray. Also, she&#39;s seriously addicted to eating. These deep-seated issues are so difficult to overcome. Can Tammy defeat the demons within and stop being a monster? Sure, she can. People have done harder things. However, it&#39;s still a very tough challenge.





 3  Tammy Slaton Was The Queen Of &#34;Bad Romance&#34; 
Tammy Slaton Dated &#34;Feeders&#34;
        

Tammy used to get involved with guys who were very bad influences. She&#39;s pansexual but Tammy&#39;s known for dating &#34;feeders.&#34; That means that they prefer women who are on the curvier side. In fact, they encourage their partners to eat a lot in order to fit their type. Obviously, a &#34;feeder&#34; love interest isn&#39;t a good choice for someone who&#39;s morbidly obese.
One example is Jacob, who was definitely a feeder. He short-circuited Tammy&#39;s weight-loss goals by sending the message that eating more would make her more desirable. If he really loved her, he wouldn&#39;t encourage overeating, as consuming too much food could actually lead to her death. Also, the motives of her exes, except Caleb, who seemed sincere, are easy to question.
These guys could be clout chasers who wanted to date a famous woman in order to improve their lives. When Tammy met Caleb, it seemed like real love might be possible for her. However, that wasn&#39;t meant to be. While a lot of people joke about Tammy, who&#39;s ultimately responsible for her poor romantic choices, her problems are very serious. Anyone who takes advantage of someone this vulnerable, no matter how monstrous they seem on the surface, should be ashamed.





 2  Tammy Slaton Is A Drama Queen 
Does Tammy Slaton Thrive On Conflict?


Tammy&#39;s all about high-drama poses. She&#39;s looking remarkably different these days, thanks to an operation that may have been life-saving. Above, in Tammy&#39;s Instagram post, she&#39;s rocking a black leather jacket and smoldering for the camera. Tammy&#39;s all about theater online, delivering the kind of histrionics that keep followers hooked. Sure, some of the comments are disgusting, but it&#39;s all attention, and attention is what this reality TV show monster craves. However, courting attention at all costs may not be good for her.





 1  Tammy Slaton Never Says She&#39;s Sorry 
Tammy Slaton Should Apologize To The People She&#39;s Hurt


In the poignant photo shown above, via Tammy&#39;s Instagram, the sisters who are so often at war take a break from the chaos. They&#39;re close together and seem to be in tune. This quiet and tranquil moment was unusual. For Tammy, moments like this are few and far between. That&#39;s because she never really says she&#39;s sorry. If she opened her heart and apologized for all she&#39;s done wrong, she might be a happier person. As 1000-lb Sisters season 5 unfolds, viewers will be able to see if losing weight changed Tammy for the better.
