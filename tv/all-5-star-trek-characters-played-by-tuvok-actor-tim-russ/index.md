Tim Russ, who played Tuvok on Star Trek: Voyager, appeared as 5 different characters in 4 Star Trek series and the feature film Star Trek Generations.




Tim Russ has played 5 different characters in the Star Trek franchise. Russ was a devoted Trekkie before landing the life-changing lead role of Lieutenant Tuvok in Star Trek: Voyager. Since the series ended in 2001, Russ has remained active in Star Trek fandom; in addition to writing extended universe content, Tim also provided voice acting for various games and even directed two fan productions. While Russ is forever synonymous with Tuvok, he played 3 other Star Trek roles before he was cast as the USS Voyager&#39;s Vulcan Security Chief, and Russ made a surprise appearance in Star Trek: Picard season 3.
A long-time fan of Star Trek, Tim Russ tried for several years to land a role in the franchise. Russ was considered for Geordi LaForge in Star Trek: The Next Generation but ultimately lost the part to Reading Rainbow host LeVar Burton. Not one to give up on a dream, Russ continued to audition for parts in the franchise and won a few guest roles before being cast in Star Trek: Voyager. Russ has the distinction of appearing in four Star Trek TV series as well as the feature film Star Trek Generations. As a result, Tim appeared onscreen with four different Star Trek captains as well as a Captain-to-be, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Here are all 5 roles Tim Russ played in the Star Trek franchise.
            
 
 Star Trek Should Admit Voyagerâ€™s Tuvok Is As Great As Spock 
Spock is often thought of as Star Trek&#39;s greatest Vulcan, but Voyager&#39;s Tuvok has had just as impressive a life and career as Spock did.













 








 Devor 
Star Trek: The Next Generation Season 6, Episode 18 - &#34;Starship Mine&#34;
        

Tim Russ&#39;s Star Trek debut was as Devor in the Star Trek: The Next Generation season 6 episode &#34;Starship Mine.&#34; When the USS Enterprise-D docks at the Starfleet Arkaria Base for a baryon sweep and to give the crew shore leave, mercenaries posing as the station&#39;s crew board the Galaxy Class starship to steal trilithium resin from the warp core. Trilithium is a highly-volatile substance that can be used by terrorists to manufacture explosives. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) returns to the Enterprise to grab a saddle and finds himself against the marauders. Devor is the first mercenary that Picard encounters. After extracting information from him, Picard leaves Devor unconscious in the sickbay where he is later killed by the baryon sweep.
Star Trek: The Next Generation executive producer Rick Berman was known for keeping tabs on actors who impressed him, and Berman kept Tim Russ &#34;on file&#34; until the role of Tuvok in Star Trek: Voyager came along. 






 T&#39;Kar 
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Season 2, Episode 4 - &#34;Invasive Procedures&#34;
        

Tim Russ returned to portray another mercenary as the Klingon T&#39;Kar in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 2 episode &#34;Invasive Procedures.&#34; In a DS9 outing that has striking parallels to the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Russ previously appeared in, the Deep Space Nine space station is evacuated due to an impending plasma storm and is being operated by a skeleton crew. T&#39;Kar leads a team of mercenaries hired by unjoined Trill Verad (John Glover) to help steal the Dax symbiont from Lt. Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell).





 USS Enterprise-B Lieutenant 
Star Trek Generations
        

Tim Russ&#39; only (canonical) Star Trek movie appearance so far is in Star Trek: Generations. Russ appeared in Star Trek Generations&#39; prologue, set in 2293, as a Lieutenant stationed on the bridge of the newly-launched USS Enterprise-B. Russ&#39; Lieutenant works alongside Captain John Harriman (Alan Ruck), and special guests from the previous Starship Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Scotty (James Doohan), and Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), when the Enterprise-B encounters the temporal energy ribbon known as the Nexus.
Although he didn&#39;t appear in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, the Star Trek: Voyager episode &#34;Flashback&#34; retconned Ensign Tuvok as a bridge officer serving aboard the USS Excelsior commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) in 2293. 






 Lieutenant Tuvok 
Star Trek: Voyager Seasons 1-7


 







Tim Russ&#39;s dedication to Star Trek eventually earned him a main cast role in Star Trek: Voyager as Lt. Tuvok. Russ played the Vulcan for seven seasons, and Tuvok was the focus of several memorable Voyager episodes where Russ had the opportunity to fully develop his character. Russ has remained a dedicated Trekker in the 20 years since Voyager ended, even reprising the role for the fan-made production Star Trek: Of Gods and Men. The first Black Vulcan in Star Trek, Tim Russ&#39; performances turned Tuvok into one of Star Trek&#39;s greatest Vulcan characters, rivaling Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) himself.
Star Trek: Lower Decks season 3&#39;s premiere showed Commander Tuvok working as part of Starfleet Security after the USS Voyager returned to Earth, although Tim Russ didn&#39;t voice Tuvok in his brief cameo. 






 Changeling Tuvok 
Star Trek: Picard Season 3, Episode 7 - &#34;Dominion&#34;


 







Tim Russ bought Tuvok back in Star Trek: Picard season 3, but in a surprise move, Russ&#39; first appearance as Tuvok since Star Trek: Voyager was as a Changeling impersonating the Vulcan. The Changeling Tuvok posed as the genuine article when Commander Seven of Nine contacted him to help the USS Titan-A in Star Trek: Picard season 3, episode 7 - &#34;Dominion.&#34; However, Seven quickly determined the person she was speaking with wasn&#39;t her old friend from the USS Voyager, who claimed to have kidnapped and replaced the real Tuvok. In Star Trek: Picard&#39;s series finale, &#34;The Last Generation,&#34; Tim Russ plays the genuine Captain Tuvok, who promoted Seven of Nine to Captain at the request of the late Captain Liam Shaw (Todd Stashwick). Star Trek would certainly welcome Tim Russ returning as Tuvok once more or playing yet another character in the franchise.
Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, and Star Trek: Picard are available to stream on Paramount&#43;. Star Trek Generations is available to stream on Max.
