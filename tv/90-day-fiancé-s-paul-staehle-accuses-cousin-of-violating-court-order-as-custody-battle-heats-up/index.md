## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé alum Paul Staehle reveals that his cousin has custody of his sons Pierre and Ethan and makes a major accusation against her.




Former 90 Day Fiancé cast member Paul Staehle claimed that his cousin, who has custody of his and Karine Martins&#39; two sons, has forbidden the family from seeing or having any contact with the kids. The couple was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 1 when Paul went to Brazil to meet his online girlfriend Karine in person. Paul and Karine&#39;s age, cultural, and language differences created a messy relationship storyline that involved cheating allegations and alleged abuse. In December 2021, Karine and Paul split after a video showed Karine allegedly harming him in front of their son.




Karine and Paul lost custody of their children after the incident, and, according to InTouch, Paul is now talking about the intense legal battle he&#39;s in with his cousin to gain custody of Pierre and Ethan.

          

Paul used Instagram to talk about how neither his mom Mary nor he and Karine decorated their houses this year because they were not able to spend their holiday with their children. Paul claimed it was “entirely because of the situation of my cousin not allowing any biological family seeing Ethan or Pierre.&#34; Paul alleged that his cousin is not allowing him to see his kids, even though they have court orders to do so.

&#34;All this after my cousin testified she would never infringe on biological family having a relationship with them and many other lies Karine lawyer caught her in under oath on the stand,&#34; Paul added in his Instagram Story. He claimed that Karine did every single required court-ordered task by the CPS, but his cousin &#34;banned&#34; Karine and his mom from all visitation and contact with Pierre and Ethan during Christmas. According to Paul, his son Pierre &#34;absolutely hates&#34; living with Paul&#39;s cousin. Paul claimed Pierre cried at the end of visitations because he did not want to live with Paul&#39;s cousin.


 




Paul said he has enough evidence that his cousin violated court orders, which will help him get the kids back. &#34;We have to wait until sheriff serves my cousin the lawsuit unfortunately that will also not be until after courts reopen,&#34; he added. Paul believes that judges do not like it when someone restricts visitation rights, especially court-ordered ones, and hopes that his cousin will be &#34;found in contempt and jailed when courts reopen.” Paul is hopeful that he will finally have his mom or Karine secure custody of the kids after his never-ending court battle. He appears to have a photo of the original court order allowing his parents to have visitation rights.

Paul and Karine ended up losing their kids to CPS because of the toxic nature of their relationship. He said they were back together in April 2023 so they could gain custody. However, Paul claimed he and Karine were just friends after a photo of them together at Disneyland circulated online in October 2023. Paul claimed to have been dating an indigenous woman from the Amazon region. Meanwhile, Karine has also been trying to earn money to help with the custody battle by offering holiday advertising on her Instagram account.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
