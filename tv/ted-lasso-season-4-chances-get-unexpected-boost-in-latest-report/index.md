## Literature Review
Ted Lasso season 4 gets an unexpected and positive update, with sources sharing some surprising news about one of the show’s lead stars.




Ted Lasso season 4 gets an unexpected and positive update. It has been almost a year since the third installment of Ted Lasso debuted, providing closure for the popular Apple TV&#43; sports comedy. But even though the season 3 finale easily doubles as a series finale, complete with a montage of all the various characters and their futures, there hasn&#39;t been anything official regarding whether the Emmy-winning show is over. The cast and Apple TV&#43; itself has fueled speculation, appearing to occasionally tease spinoffs.




During the January 5th edition of The Hollywood Reporter&#39;s TV&#39;s Top 5 podcast, West Coast TV Editor Lesley Goldberg briefly addressed Ted Lasso season 4 while previewing the 2024 slate of Apple TV&#43;. Goldberg mentions that, according to her sources, lead actor Jason Sudeikis “desperately misses” playing the titular Ted. The full quote is below:


So obviously, the finale set up a couple of different possible spinoffs. They&#39;ve been mum about what&#39;s going on there. I&#39;ve you know, heard through sources that Jason Sudeikis desperately misses that character. So, who knows if they&#39;re going to find a way to bring him back with another a fourth season of Ted Lasso or if they&#39;re going to do another spinoff.



 Could Ted Lasso Become A Supporting Character? 
          

As mentioned on the podcast, Ted Lasso sets up several spinoffs. The most obvious is to continue the story of AFC Richmond, without Sudeikis in the lead role. Another possibility is a spinoff that would be focused on a women&#39;s soccer team, with the leads being Keeley (Juno Temple) and Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham). Alternatively, there could be a prequel focused on Roy Kent (Brett Goldstein).




Another element that adds to the Ted Lasso season 4 confusion is Sudeikis himself. At times, he&#39;s mentioned that Ted&#39;s arc is over and that the spotlight can turn to the overall ensemble. The latest update suggests that Sudeikis could perhaps return in guest roles without necessarily having to be the ostensible focus of the series.

                  Ted Lasso Season 3 Ending Explained: What&#39;s Next For AFC Richmond   Ted Lasso&#39;s season 3 ending wraps up the main story but still leaves room for more. Here&#39;s where it leaves each character and what the future holds.    

Apple TV&#43; is on a hot streak, relative to where it&#39;s been previously. That&#39;s thanks to shows like Slow Horses, For All Mankind, and The Morning Show. Even with that increased viability, Ted Lasso remains the streamer&#39;s biggest and most recognizable title. It could be the case that it might still return, with the on-screen involvement of Sudeikis.
