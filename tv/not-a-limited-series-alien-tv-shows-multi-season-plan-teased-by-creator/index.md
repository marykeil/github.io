## Literature Review

Noah Hawley teases the grand scope of his upcoming Alien TV series, hinting at how the show could explore many years of the Xenomorph horrors.




Alien TV series showrunner Noah Hawley opens up about his hopes for the prequel series&#39; longevity, teasing a plan that consists of multiple seasons. The Fargo and Legion showrunner will helm the franchise&#39;s first attempt at a television format in a prequel story set on Earth thirty years before the events of the 1979 movie. The series stars Sydney Chandler, Alex Lawther, Samuel Blenkin, Essie Davis, Adarsh Gourav, Kit Young, and Timothy Olyphant as a party consisting of soldiers, CEOs, and synthetic beings.




As Hawley prepares to continue filming on his Alien prequel TV series following a pause, the showrunner revealed to Collider his visions for a long-term plan. Unlike previous IP projects including Legion, Hawley entered production knowing that FX hoped to make Alien a multi-season show, allowing him to create an ever-escalating narrative year by year that evolved naturally while still leaving room to be adjusted between his envisioned endpoint, rather than being beholden to a strict plan or story bible. Check out Hawley&#39;s full explanation below:


With Legion, I had what felt like a three-act structure to it that I didn&#39;t know if that would be three seasons or five seasons, or whatever it was, but I sort of knew what a beginning, middle, and end was. And here, similarly, I knew that their desire was for a recurring series, not a limited series, and I had an idea that I was excited about, that I could see the escalation of it from one year to another. That&#39;s where we ended up not pitching them having a bible or pitching them blow-by-blow, but saying, “Big picture: this is the first movement, this is the second movement, and we&#39;re ultimately going here.”






 Where Does The Alien TV Series Fit In The Franchise&#39;s Timeline 
          

While details about Hawley&#39;s Alien series remain under tight wraps, several details and quotes can help create a clearer picture of what his Alien series will focus on. The showrunnner has stated that his series will be a return to the franchise&#39;s earlier mythology and aesthetics as opposed to Prometheus&#39; Engineer origins and higher-tech expeditions. However, the series will also see a drastic turn in terms of the franchise&#39;s on-screen history by bringing the Xenomorph threat to Earth, a first for the series outside its Alien VS Predator crossovers.

                  Alien Movies In Order (Release &amp; Chronological)   From Ridley Scott&#39;s Alien to the sci-fi franchise&#39;s prequel series beginning with Prometheus, here&#39;s how to watch the Alien movies in order.   




With this and the previously revealed thirty-year gap between the series and Alien, the television series is set to take place between 2092 and 2122, the year of the Nostromo incident. With Prometheus and Alien: Covenant being set long before and presumably resulting in their casts being classified as lost following the latter&#39;s ending, the Alien TV series could catalog Wayland-Yutani&#39;s first recorded encounter with a Xenomorph. Each season could build on the company&#39;s obsession and developing understanding, leading to them tracking the signal that the Nostromo would pick up on LV-426 in the show&#39;s final seasons.

Hawley hopes to return to the simpler mythology of Alien, as such, it can be assumed his series will be an original tale outside any previously released expanded media. However, while Hawley does have the freedom to create his own story, it is clear that no matter how many seasons, he does have a vague, somewhat solid endpoint for where he wishes to end things. However, with FX offering him the freedom to develop his story in whatever way he sees fit, audiences will be hopeful that Alien&#39;s TV expansion will be a perfectly paced horror epic.






While no release window has been given, the Alien TV series is expected to air on FX on Hulu.
