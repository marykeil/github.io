# Star Trek s First LGBTQ&#43; Romance Almost Happened In TNG Season 2


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: The Next Generation almost featured an LGBTQ&#43; couple in Season 2, showing the franchise&#39;s commitment to diversity and addressing social issues ahead of its time.   The episode &#34;The Outcast&#34; in Season 7 dealt with gender and sexuality, but didn&#39;t go as far as it could have, reflecting a gradual progression towards inclusivity in the Star Trek series.   Star Trek: Deep Space Nine took a step further by featuring a same-sex kiss between Jadzia and Lenara in the episode &#34;Rejoined,&#34; but showrunner Ira Steven Behr wishes they had pushed boundaries even more.

## Literature Review
Gene Roddenberry pushed for an LGBTQ&#43; couple to be included in an early episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.




Star Trek: The Next Generation season 2 almost featured an episode depicting an LGBTQ&#43; couple among the crew of the USS Enterprise-D. Since its inception, Star Trek has always been ahead of its time, commenting on relevant social issues and celebrating diversity. Following the crew of the USS Enterprise-D, led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), TNG took on its fair share of social topics over the course of its seven seasons. Despite this, neither Star Trek: The Original Series nor TNG ever depicted any explicitly queer characters among their Enterprise crews.




Star Trek: The Next Generation did tackle issues of gender and sexuality in TNG season 7, episode 17, &#34;The Outcast,&#34; but the episode ended in tragedy and didn&#39;t go as far as it could have. Still, it represented a step in the right direction, and nearly every Star Trek series has been more diverse and inclusive than the last. It wasn&#39;t until Star Trek: Discovery and Dr. Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz) and Commander Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp) that a committed queer couple appeared among the main characters. If it had been up to Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, however, the franchise&#39;s first queer couple may have appeared much sooner.

                  Star Trek: A Queer History Of The Franchise   While the Star Trek franchise has only added explicitly LGBTQ&#43; characters in the last 4-5 years, it has had ties to queer themes from the beginning.    


 Gene Roddenberry Wanted To Include An LGBTQ&#43; Couple In TNG Season 2 
          




Star Trek: The Next Generation got off to a rough start with a somewhat chaotic writers&#39; room resulting in an inconsistent first season. By the end of season 1, TNG had begun to find its footing, but the WGA Writers Strike of 1988 derailed production yet again. As the writer&#39;s room continued to shift and the producers looked for scripts, program consultant David Gerrold pitched a script called &#34;Blood and Fire.&#34; Not only did the story feature a gay couple among the Enterprise crew members, but it also commented on the AIDS crisis.



David Gerrold wrote the iconic TOS episode, &#34;The Trouble With Tribbles,&#34; which remains one of the most well-known and beloved Star Trek episodes of all time.




According to Star Trek: The Next Generation: The Continuing Mission, Gene Roddenberry and David Gerrold were attending a Star Trek convention when a group of LGBTQ&#43; Trek fans asked if queer identities would ever be represented on TNG. Despite some push-back from others on the production staff, Roddenberry insisted and Gerrold pitched his &#34;Blood and Fire&#34; story. At first, Gerrold was told that the script would be produced, but Paramount Studios apparently feared the topic might be too mature for younger audience members. Despite going through rewrites, the episode was never made and Gerrold departed the show soon after.






 Star Trek: DS9&#39;s Dax Had An LGBTQ&#43; Relationship 
         

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine would go a step further than TNG by putting one of their main characters in a brief queer relationship. In DS9 season 4, episode 6, &#34;Rejoined,&#34; joined Trill Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) encounters the wife of one of her previous hosts. As a Trill, Jadzia is host to the Dax symbiote, who has had many male and female hosts before Jadzia. When Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson) visits Deep Space 9, she and Jadzia rekindle their romance, leading to Star Trek&#39;s first same-sex kiss. However, Trill society forbids hosts from continuing romances from their past lives, so Jadzia and Lenara&#39;s relationship ends before it truly begins.

&#34;Rejoined&#34; does not focus on the fact that Jadzia and Lenara are women, painting them as just two people who still have feelings for one another. While this was a big step forward at the time, DS9 showrunner Ira Steven Behr wishes they had gone further. In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine documentary, What We Left Behind, Behr discusses &#34;Rejoined,&#34; saying: &#34;One episode in seven years, we could have done better. Trust me. We should have done better.&#34; In hindsight, maybe there were times when Star Trek could have pushed more boundaries, but the franchise has always been, and continues to be, a celebration of &#34;infinite diversity in infinite combinations.&#34;






Star Trek: The Next Generation &amp; Star Trek: Deep Space Nine are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
