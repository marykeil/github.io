## Literature Review
Most contestants on Survivor are younger people, but on occasion, older contestants show up. Despite having an age disadvantage, they do their best.




Survivor has featured many kinds of players over the years, and here are the ten oldest. Given the intense nature of the reality competition series, type A personalities and those in peak physical condition tend to thrive the best in Survivor. However, this hasn&#39;t discouraged older people from competing. Often seen as underdogs, a few prove everyone wrong by reaching the final stages. As Survivor season 45 wraps up, it&#39;s time to revisit the oldest players.
Typically, most contestants on the show fall within the 18 to 40 age bracket. Younger contestants have an added advantage because they can always return for later seasons and have another go without feeling the strain. However, this rarely happens with older contestants, and cast members over 40 rarely emerge as victors, even though some remain fan-favorite contestants. Let&#39;s revisit the ten oldest Survivor contestants, some of whom become the oldest Survivor winners.









 








 1  Rudy Boesch 
Age On Survivor: 72 and 75
        



 







        


 Survivor 

 Release Date   May 31, 2000    Cast   Jeff Probst    Seasons   44    Network   CBS    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Netflix    




Boesch holds the record for the oldest-ever castaway to compete. He participated in the first season (Borneo), where he had one of the best-ever Survivor bromances with Richard Hatch. He then beat his record when he appeared in Survivor: All-Stars at 75.
As a former NAVY seal, Rudy efficiently performed the tasks. However, his combat experience was sometimes a disadvantage, as he belittled other contestants and refused to form alliances. The Final Immunity Challenge would be the end of his run. His third-place finish was impressive, but he could have done better, given his skills. Unfortunately, Rudy passed away in 2019 at the age of 91 after a long battle with Alzheimer&#39;s.





 2  Joe Del Campo 
Age On Survivor: 71





 3   
At 71, former FBI agent Joe Del Campo became the oldest contestant to compete on Survivor: Kaôh Rōng. Despite his advanced age, Joe displayed remarkable physical stamina and strategic prowess, forming early alliances and demonstrating his ability to think independently. Joe&#39;s strategy on Survivor: Kaôh Rōng was adequate, but his Survivor journey was cut short when he was medically evacuated on Day 34 after overindulging in a reward feast. He ended the game in fifth place.





 4  Jimmy Johnson 
Age On Survivor: 67
        

Jimmy Johnson, a renowned NFL coach with two Super Bowl victories, joined the cast of Survivor: Nicaragua. With his competitive spirit and strategic mind, Johnson sought to bring his coaching skills to the game. Despite his initial enthusiasm, Johnson struggled to adapt to the harsh conditions, particularly the lack of sleep and constant hunger. His physical and mental fatigue took a toll, and he ultimately found himself voted out of the game on the eighth day.





 5  Tarzan Smith 
Age On Survivor: 64


Gregory &#34;Tarzan&#34; Smith, a retired electrician, appeared on Survivor: One World, the 24th season of the popular reality show. With his eccentric personality, Tarzan quickly became a memorable character. Despite his strategic missteps and lack of social awareness, Tarzan survived until Day 36, placing sixth overall.





 6  B.B. Andersen 
Age On Survivor: 64
        

B.B. Andersen, a real estate developer from Kansas City, Missouri, was a memorable castaway on Survivor: Borneo. Despite his age of 63, B.B. was a strong physical competitor and a charismatic personality. However, his blunt and outspoken nature caused friction within his tribe, leading to his elimination in the second episode. He passed away at the age of 77 in 2013.





 7  Dan Lembo 
Age On Survivor: 63
        

Dan Lembo, a 63-year-old retired firefighter and police officer, was a well-liked contestant on Survivor: Nicaragua. Despite his age, Dan did surprisingly well in the game. His warm personality and genuine kindness earned him the respect and admiration of his fellow castaways. Dan&#39;s strategic prowess and ability to build strong alliances proved valuable assets. His journey ended on Day 37 when he was voted out, but his legacy as a genuine and likable contestant lives on among Survivor fans. Unfortunately, Dan passed away in 2022 at the age of 75.





 8  Sonja Christopher 
Age On Survivor: 63
        

Sonja Christopher marked her place in Survivor history as the first contestant eliminated from the inaugural season, Survivor: Borneo. Despite her early exit, Sonja left a lasting impression on the show, becoming the first openly lesbian contestant and a charismatic and relatable figure. She was 63 years old when she competed on the show.





 9  Jim Lynch 
Age On Survivor: 63


 







Jim Lynch joined Survivor: Guatemala in 2005. Known for his determination and strong work ethic, Lynch faced the challenges of the harsh Guatemalan jungle with a resilient spirit. However, his physical endurance was tested during the first challenge, a 15-mile trek through the jungle, which resulted in a torn bicep muscle. Despite his injuries, Lynch continued to compete but became a vulnerable target. Lynch was voted out of the game during the first tribal council.





 10  Mike Borassi 
Age On Survivor: 62
        

Mike was the oldest contestant in season 19 (Samoa), and despite having been a football coach for most of his life, age caught up with him when he needed to rely on his body. After taking hits during the Immunity Challenge, Mike had what could be considered one of the scariest moments in Survivor when he developed low blood pressure and had to be pulled from the show.
It was a sad end for a determined contestant seeking to prove that age was no reason to write him off. Mike&#39;s fellow contestants did admit that he was pushing himself too far, something even audiences could see. His exit was even sadder, considering he had tried to participate in previous seasons but hadn&#39;t been chosen.





 11  Gillian Larson 
Age On Survivor: 61


 







Season 17 (Gabon) contestant Gillian Larson was one of the nicest people ever to appear on Survivor. Still, she was voted out in the second Tribal Council because her teammates felt she wasn&#39;t helpful. They even described her as &#34;dead weight.&#34; Gillian proved that being nice in a competition like this doesn&#39;t help. All it takes is being fit, strategic, and ruthless. Gillian&#39;s struggle to catch her breath during the challenges foreshadowed her eventual elimination on Survivor.
