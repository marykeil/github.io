<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Over its 14 seasons, there have been many The Real Housewives Of New York City cast members, but only a few of them are actually memorable.</p>
<p>Since The Real Housewives of New York City began in 2008, several memorable cast members have emerged that fans still talk about to this day. The inception of RHONY began in March 2008 and is the second installment in The Real Housewives franchise following The Real Housewives of Orange County. It quickly became a fan favorite as the women of New York City were much more quirky and hilarious compared to the other Housewives spin-offs. Many of the women from RHONY also were full-time cast members for ten seasons or more, including Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, and Luann de Lesseps.
Despite having a fabulous cast of women year after year, RHONY season 13 was full of controversy on and off-screen, so Bravo did a huge overhaul of the cast. Every single cast member from season 13 was fired, and a whole new cast was brought on for RHONY season 14. The new cast includes Sai De Silva, Ubah Hassan, Erin Dana Lichy, Jenna Lyons, Jessel Taank, and Brynn Whitfield. While the new RHONY cast had a mixed bag of positive and negative views from fans, none of the ladies have been around long enough to be as memorable as the old-school RHONY cast members.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>12  Eboni K. Williams<br>
RHONY Season 13</p>
<p>When Eboni K. Williams was first announced as a cast member for RHONY season 13, fans were excited about her. Eboni was the first Black woman to join the series as a full-time cast member, making history on RHONY. Despite being the first Black woman to join RHONY, Eboni simply didn&rsquo;t bring enough to the show. Even though Eboni wasn&rsquo;t super captivating, she is still a memorable housewife.</p>
<p>11  Kristen Taekman
RHONY Seasons 6-7</p>
<p>Kristen Taekman joined the cast for RHONY season 6 and stayed a cast member until season 7. Similar to Eboni, Kristen wasn&rsquo;t the most captivating housewife in terms of drama or even personality. However, her married life with her husband, Josh Taekman, was interesting to watch.
The couple was going through what seemed like a rough patch, but it looks like Kristen and Josh have worked on their marriage as they&rsquo;re still together. Kristen also has the icon RHONY tagline, &ldquo;I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but I’m pretty,&rdquo; which has gone down as one of the funniest Housewives taglines. Kristen is now starring in The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: RHONY Legacy.</p>
<p>10  Aviva Drescher
RHONY Seasons 5-6</p>
<p>When Aviva Drescher joined RHONY season 5, she was a part of the first reboot that included Heather Thomson and Carole Radziwill. At first, Aviva seemed like the typical waspy New Yorker, but as her time on the show progressed, it seemed she was just as kooky as the rest of the ladies. Aviva&rsquo;s most memorable moment on the show was during RHONY season 6 when she took off her prosthetic leg and threw it across the room while in public with the cast. RHONY fans still talk about this moment, and Aviva to this day.</p>
<p>Real Housewives: The Best Seasons Of RHONY, Ranked
The Real Housewives of New York City remains popular, and these are the seasons with the most dramatic and compelling episodes.</p>
<p>9  Leah McSweeney
RHONY Season 12-13</p>
<p>As a friend of Tinsley Mortimer&rsquo;s, Leah McSweeney was introduced to the cast and was immediately a hit with the fans. While some of the women (like Ramona) were unsure about Leah and her free spirit, Leah was able to form a bond with the women quickly. During season 12, Leah revealed she had recently started drinking again after being sober for nine years, which created a few memorable drunken moments. However, after season 13, Leah, like the rest of the cast, didn&rsquo;t return.</p>
<p>8  Heather Thomson
RHONY Seasons 5-7</p>
<p>Heather Thomson joined the RHONY cast during season 5 and remained a cast member until season 7. She made several guest appearances after that and was even was a friend of the cast during RHONY season 13, which Heather now regrets. What made Heather so memorable was her classic &ldquo;holla&rdquo; saying and her hilarious side comments during her confessionals. Also, her friendship with Carole Radziwill was always a nice change of pace from the usual RHONY antics.</p>
<p>7  Carole Radziwill
RHONY Seasons 5-10</p>
<p>Carole was the normal one of the bunch during her time on RHONY seasons 5-10. She immediately developed a friendship with Heather and later began a close friendship with Bethenny Frankel until Carole and Bethenny&rsquo;s massive feud during season 10. What makes Carole so memorable is her cool girl attitude and how she doesn&rsquo;t care what any of the ladies think of her. Even her romance with Chef Adam, whom she met at Luann&rsquo;s house, caused quite a stir, especially for Luann. For someone who tried to stay out of the drama, many of the women had a bone to pick with Carole.</p>
<p>6  Kelly Killoren Bensimon
RHONY Seasons 2-4</p>
<p>Kelly Killoren Bensimon made quite a splash when she first joined RHONY during season 2. Kelly was newly divorced and raising her two young daughters. Despite her seemingly ordinary life, something was off with Kelly during her time on the show. Kelly got a bad reputation when she and the ladies took a trip to the Virgin Islands, and she had her meltdown; Kelly even coined the term &ldquo;Scary Island,&rdquo; which fans now refer to when talking about that epsiode.</p>
<p>The Real Housewives Of New York City Season 15 - Latest News, Cast &amp; Everything We Know
The Real Housewives Of New York City season 14 is coming to an end soon. Here is everything to know about season 15&rsquo;s exciting cast and more.</p>
<p>5  Ramona Singer
RHONY Season 1-13</p>
<p>Ramona is the longest-running RHONY cast member, as she has been a part of the show since its inception. Ramona is one of the most memorable cast members because of her quirky personality and her attitude towards those she deems below her. She is constantly forgetting people&rsquo;s names, making off-color comments, and is kind of a snob. However, Ramona is unapologetically herself, which fans have either grown to love or hate.</p>
<p>4  Sonja Morgan
RHONY Season 3-13</p>
<p>Sonja Morgan joined the cast of RHONY season 3 and was an instant hit with the fans and the cast members. When she joined the show, Sonja had been divorced from her ex-husband, John Morgan, for a few years and was getting back into NYC society. Sonja is memorable for the many questionable comments she has made over the years, such as partying with &ldquo;John John Kennedy and Madonna.&rdquo; Her quirky one-liners are what makes Sonja a top-tier RHONY cast member.</p>
<p>3  Luann de Lesseps
RHONY Season 1-13</p>
<p>Luann&rsquo;s another memorable RHONY cast member who managed to stay on the show for 13 seasons. Other than her short stint as a friend of during season 6, Luann was an OG, just like Ramona. What makes Luann so memorable is her iconic singing career on the show, her marriage to Tom D’Agostino, and her classic lines such as, &ldquo;be cool, don&rsquo;t be all like uncool.&rdquo; Overall, Luann has brought a lot during her time on RHONY.</p>
<p>2  Bethenny Frankel
RHONY Seasons 1-3, 7-11</p>
<p>Before Bethenny called for a union for reality stars, which has been called a &ldquo;reality reckoning,&rdquo; she was one of the most beloved RHONY cast members. Fans watched as Bethenny fell in and out of love with Jason Hoppy and also welcomed her daughter, Bryn. Bethenny also was never afraid to call out any of her cast members or go up against them, making her another memorable RHONY star.</p>
<p>1  Dorinda Medley
RHONY Season 7-12</p>
<p>One of the most iconic The Real Housewives of New York City ladies is, without a doubt, Dorinda Medley. She came into the show during season 7, alongside the return of Bethenny, and Dorinda was still the showstopper. Dorinda is memorable for her hilarious inspirational quotes and her drunk outburst. While Dorinda wasn&rsquo;t perfect, she did always try to make it nice.
