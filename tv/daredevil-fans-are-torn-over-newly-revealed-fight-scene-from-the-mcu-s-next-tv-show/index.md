## Literature Review
Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil is back for another MCU adventure; however, fans are divided over a new clip of Daredevil fighting in Marvel&#39;s next series.




Daredevil fans are divided about a new fight clip featuring the hero in the upcoming Echo series. While Alaqua Cox&#39;s Maya Lopez leads the cast of Echo, the series will feature the returns of Netflix Daredevil stars Charlie Cox and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio as Daredevil and Kingpin, respectively. Following Daredevil&#39;s more acrobatic fighting style in Disney&#43;&#39;s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the character seems to be going for a mixed fighting style between his latest Marvel Cinematic Universe appearance and his original series in the Echo.




A preview of Marvel‘s Echo (via @DDevilUpdates/Twitter) was shown during a broadcast on Sky Sports, revealing a good look at Daredevil fighting Echo in the MCU series.


 

The latest update from Echo finds Maya fighting Daredevil, who is sporting his original red suit, in a warehouse. The fight scene is closer in tone to the fights of the Daredevil Netflix series than the rest of the MCU, though there are some differences.

                  The MCU&#39;s First 2024 Release Reviews Are Massive For Daredevil&#39;s Return   Early rave reviews for Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming spinoff series spell good news for Phase 5&#39;s Charlie Cox-led Daredevil: Born Again on Disney&#43;.    


 Why The Echo Vs Daredevil Clip Has Fans Divided 
          




Echo is not exactly repeating the action of the original Daredevil series in the eyes of some fans, and that has led to a mixed reception to the new Daredevil fight scene. The main criticism related to the new Daredevil and Echo fight clip is that the action feels weightless, with the characters&#39; punches and kicks not looking real, as well as the fight being slow. The fight has been compared to a dance — in a negative way — by some fans.


 

@MrHumpty_ is one of the Marvel fans who think the Daredevil and Echo fight looks slow.


 




@Waldrada hopes the clip is from an Echo rehearsal, as they think it looks awful.


 

@Thethiccart jokes that the Daredevil and Echo fight looks like a turn-based game.

While some Marvel fans are less than thrilled about the new Echo fight scene, others believe the MCU is taking Daredevil in the right direction. The Echo and Daredevil fight has been positively compared to the action of the original Netflix Daredevil series by some fans who believe the upcoming MCU TV show is the closest Marvel Studios has gotten to that level of grittiness. The new fight clip has also been deemed as intense, with praise for not having many cuts, which lets the action breathe.


 




@ChrisSinclairrr says they will subscribe to Disney&#43; again for Echo.


 

@LachesisHD enjoyed the new Daredevil fight clip, saying, &#34;We keep on WINNING.&#34;


 

@theminuteman99 thinks Daredevil fans are in for a good ride in Echo.

The truth of the matter is that both sides have good arguments. Echo&#39;s first trailer showed it was a Daredevil follow-up in terms of its violence and dark themes, with the new fight clip confirming that the series is going for a similar action style to that of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil. However, the Echo and Daredevil fight scene does have multiple moments where the characters seem to be slowing down to wait for the other to finish their part of the fight choreography, breaking the immersion. It remains to be seen if the fight will be tweaked before Echo&#39;s approaching release date.








Echo releases all of its 5 episodes on January 9.
