## Literature Review
Sister Wives patriarch, Kody Brown, has a big family for whom to provide. What have his jobs been over the years?




Kody Brown of Sister Wives seems to be a jack of all trades, but it&#39;s not always clear what he does for a living. The patriarch has been in the limelight for over ten years, but he was still a husband to four women before the cameras started rolling. Now, with some fame under his belt, there are questions about his career outside reality TV. As the drama on Sister Wives season 18 unfolds, it&#39;s time to explore Kody&#39;s past jobs.




The father of 18 has always been coy about his line of work but allegedly once worked in marketing and advertising. Janelle Brown once worked in accounting and was the primary breadwinner in the polygamous family. Both Kody and Janelle told the cameras that they kept their polygamous life private to protect their employment. Janelle revealed more about her life before Kody, including employment, but Kody remains a bit of a mystery. Kody and Janelle were the only two who really brought in a paycheck for the entire family to live off, but Janelle left Kody alongside Meri Brown and Christine Brown. As the years passed, Kody seemed to drift in and out of work, but what does he currently do?

 : Sister Wives: Why Fans Question What Kody Does For A Living


 Kody Brown Was A Firearms Salesman 
          




Before Sister Wives, Kody seemed to drift from job to job. Up until 2004, Kody was the president of Das Hundhaus Firearms and Accessories. He then saw the potential he could make through Sister Wives, and in 2010, he founded Brown Family Entertainment. Kody kept his job as a firearms salesman, but it&#39;s unknown whether he stuck with the career as the seasons continued. In recent years, Kody was spotted at a gun show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The annual town gun show is a big deal in that town since there are over 4,000 tables, and the show takes place on 11 acres of land. While this could indicate he&#39;s still working in the industry, he could also have moved toward guns as a hobby.



 Kody Creates Cameos To Support The Brown Family 
Kody also has gone down the usual route of a reality TV star and makes money off his fame. The 54-year-old set up a Cameo, gifting videos to fans willing to pay. Kody currently charges $149 for personal videos and keeps his career as a gun salesman on the down low to avoid media scrutiny due to the political climate. He likely relies on influencing the network and his wives to support his dwindling family.




The backlash against Kody&#39;s job was quick. It&#39;s challenging to support the patriarch since gun control has become a significant topic in the United States. However, he was already an unpopular cast member, so it probably doesn&#39;t impact his standing. The Sister Wives star continues to polarize fans and his family alike, so much so that he only has one wife left, Robyn Brown. At least he doesn&#39;t need to bring in as much income.
