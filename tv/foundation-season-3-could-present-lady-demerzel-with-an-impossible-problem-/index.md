# Foundation Season 3 Could Present Lady Demerzel With An Impossible Problem 


## SUMMARY 



  Lady Demerzel&#39;s possession of the Prime Radiant gives her the ability to understand Hari Seldon&#39;s predictions, confirming their truth and setting the stage for Foundation season 3.   Demerzel&#39;s programming, which includes an undying allegiance to the Genetic Dynasty and the Empire, presents a dilemma as she must decide between preserving the Dynasty or taking steps to shorten the coming darkness.   If Demerzel is unable to make a decision, the power could shift back to the Cleons, potentially granting them true control and leading to more conflict in Foundation season 3.

## Literature Review

Foundation season 3 could lead to Lady Demerzel having to make a decision with no right answer, if she can even make it in the first place.




Lady Demerzel is one of the most intriguing Foundation characters, and her very nature could lead to her being frozen by indecision in season 3. Demerzel has become a progressively larger part of the Foundation cast since her appearance in the very first episode. Throughout the first two installments, she has served the Genetic Dynasty, ensuring it doesn&#39;t fall victim to Hari Seldon and his acolytes. However, Foundation season 3 will be a huge turning point in the war between Empire and the Foundation, and Demerzel will be at the very heart of the storm.




Artificial life isn&#39;t especially commonplace within the Foundation universe, with Hari Seldon&#39;s hologram and Lady Demerzel being the only two synthetic characters. Of the two figures, Demerzel has the most compelling origin. As the last robot in existence, Demerzel is thousands of years old and bound by her programming, as well as also remaining sentient. Her logic will battle with her emotions in Foundation season 3, and it&#39;s unclear if there&#39;ll be a winner.

                  10 Burning Questions Foundation Season 3 Needs To Answer   With Foundation season 3 now confirmed, the third installment of Apple&#39;s space opera needs to answer certain questions the show has already raised.   


 Lady Demerzel Will Know Hari Seldon&#39;s Predictions Are True If She Can Read The Prime Radiant 
Psychohistory will reveal the truth to Demerzel
          

The ending of Foundation season 2 left the story on a huge cliffhanger. Not only is Demerzel revealed to be Empire&#39;s true leader, the only heir that Cleon I intended to rule, but she&#39;s also in possession of Hari Seldon&#39;s mysterious psychohistory talisman. The fact that Lady Demerzel has the Prime Radiant means that she will not only be able to eventually comprehend Seldon&#39;s predictions for the galaxy&#39;s coming darkness, but she will also know that he was telling the truth all along.




Although Demerzel admits she is unable to interpret the information in the Prime Radiant during the Foundation season 2 finale, she also states she will be able to before long. Her robot intelligence all but guarantees that she will indeed be able to make sense of the complex equations within the Prime Radiant by the time Foundation season 3 begins. Foundation&#39;s time jump between seasons 2 and 3 will be huge, meaning Demerzel has plenty of time to examine Seldon&#39;s work and ratify his projections.



Lady Demerzel is played by Finnish actor Laura Birn in Foundation.






 Lady Demerzel&#39;s Programming Presents An Impossible Problem In Foundation Season 3 
She may be left unable to make a decision due to her Prime Radiant revelation
          

Making sense of Hari Seldon&#39;s psychohistory calculations is only part of the battle for Lady Demerzel. Once she comprehends the relevance of her enemy&#39;s work, she has to take action in one way or another. The issue with this is that Cleon I altered Demerzel&#39;s programming to create an undying allegiance to Foundation&#39;s Genetic Dynasty as well as Empire at large. The coming darkness that Seldon&#39;s work predicts is set to be indiscriminate, and will affect the entire galaxy for thousands of years - this includes Demerzel&#39;s Empire.




On the other hand, Seldon suggested very early on in the show&#39;s run that dissolving the Genetic Dynasty would shorten the terrifying spell that&#39;s to come. Although he believes that nothing can stop it altogether, this one step can reduce the galaxy&#39;s suffering. Demerzel is well aware of Seldon&#39;s suggestion to end the Dynasty, but even if she were to agree with it, the programming given to her by Cleon I would prevent her from doing so.

                  8 Foundation Characters, Ranked By How Powerful They Will Be In Season 3   The struggle for power is shared by many characters in Foundation. From Hari Seldon to Lady Demerzel, however, the type of power they hold varies.   

Equally, the goal of Seldon&#39;s Foundation is to shorten the centuries of suffering for everyone, so Demerzel&#39;s same programming would also prevent her from destroying Seldon&#39;s forces. Doing so would do the same amount of harm to Empire as letting the Foundation continue to flourish. The loop of logic will be a difficult battle for Demerzel to fight and one that could be impossible to overcome.






 Foundation Season 3&#39;s Dilemma Could Force The Power Back Into The Hands Of The Genetic Dynasty 
The Cleons could gain true control for the first time
         

If Demerzel becomes incapacitated by her inability to decide on a course of action, this could mean her power is taken from her. The reveal at the end of Foundation season 2 showed that Demerzel was Empire&#39;s only real ruler, with the clones of Cleon I taking only token roles in the running of the galaxy. However, if Lady Demerzel&#39;s only two options go against her programming, the Cleons in season 3 may be Empire&#39;s only hope.

Although Foundation season 1&#39;s Brother Day immediately rejected the idea of ending the Genetic Dynasty, it remains the only viable move that will prevent further bloodshed. The Cleons are vain and very headstrong, and they will not see this as an acceptable option. Therefore, the Dynasty regaining its power is still likely to achieve very little, which means Foundation season 3 will feature more conflict.






The first two seasons of Foundation are streaming now on AppleTV&#43;. Although Foundation season 3 has been confirmed, there is currently no release date set.
