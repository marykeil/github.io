## Literature Review
The Golen Bachelor&#39;s Edith Aguirre was hoping to find someone to spend her time with at the wedding, &amp; she seemed to find more than she bargained for.




The Golden Bachelor’s Edith Aguirre was part of Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist’s Golden Wedding, and may have even found someone special of her own on the reception’s dance floor. After a season of watching Gerry and Theresa fall hopelessly in love, the couple were finally married in a beautiful ceremony in front of friends, family, and Bachelor Nation. The live TV wedding special invited many Bachelor Nation alumni along with the cast of The Golden Bachelor season 1 to take part in the festivities. Among the guests were the majority of the women who hoped to win Gerry’s heart, including fan favorite Edith who was looking for love.




According to Entertainment Weekly, Edith shared she “hoped to find her own love connection at the wedding,” of her two close friends. “I’m ready to date, so I’m going to look for somebody tonight,” Edith gushed. “Even if I don’t find someone, I’m taking the waiter or the bartender. I don’t care! I have to get somebody tonight.” 


 

While Edith may have been joking, she was spotted by EW reporter Kristen Baldwin, who shared a video of the gorgeous Golden Bachelor contestant dancing with Shyllon Melatti. Shyllon, an exotic dancer who had been featured during Theresa’s pre-filmed bachelorette party, was happily on the dancefloor with the cast of The Golden Bachelor season 1.

 Edith’s Golden Bachelor Journey Explained 
          

Edith was hopeful that she’d be able to find love with Gerry during her time on The Golden Bachelor, and after exiting the limo and making an incredible first impression, things were looking up. The Downey, California native is a 61-year-old retiree who loves spending time with her family, especially her children and grandchildren. Sharing common values with Gerry, Edith felt that she would be a great fit for the Golden Bachelor lead and the pair did seem to hit it off in the first days of the process. Unfortunately for Edith, things were progressing further with other women, and she was eliminated during week 3 of The Golden Bachelor.


 




While Edith’s Golden Bachelor journey may not have been everything she hoped, she made some incredible relationships during her time on the series. Aside from getting along wonderfully with Gerry, Edith made lasting relationships with the women on the series who all seem to be kind to one another and supportive of their lives outside of reality TV. After showing off her dance moves at Gerry &amp; Theresa’s wedding with Shyllon, Edith was seen dancing in a group of women from The Golden Bachelor who were all happy to be celebrating the love they’d seen grow right before their eyes.

Edith may not have found the love of her life during Gerry &amp; Theresa’s wedding, but she was able to have an incredible time with people she loves and respects. Although she shared she would find someone at the wedding event, it was clear that Edith was merely speaking with a sense of humor, and was excited to share the night with people she adores. After dancing with Shyllon, Edith’s evening with The Golden Bachelor cast was likely the cherry on top of a wonderful season together.
