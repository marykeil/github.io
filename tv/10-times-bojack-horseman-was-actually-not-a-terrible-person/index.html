  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Bojack proves he&rsquo;s not a monster by saving a wedding, returning a baby seahorse, and supporting Todd&rsquo;s asexuality.
The show never held back on consequences for Bojack&rsquo;s actions, but he showed internal growth throughout.
Bojack&rsquo;s moments of redemption prove he&rsquo;s capable of doing good, even though he was held accountable for his bad deeds.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Though Bojack suffered consequences for his bad actions, he proved multiple times throughout the show&rsquo;s run that he was capable of good.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of Bojack Horseman, despite Bojack doing multiple bad deeds, there were times when he showed he wasn&rsquo;t a horrible person. These moments were few and far between, but Bojack proved that he wasn&rsquo;t a monster. To be clear, there were several times when he tried to act noble to appease his ego, like when he apologized to Herb Kazzazz in Bojack Horseman&rsquo;s turning point, but there were other times when Bojack truly tried and succeeded at being a good person.
Bojack Horseman is considered one of the best Netflix animated shows ever made because it never held back when Bojack suffered consequences for his actions. In fact, he was considered the worst character in Bojack Horsemanbecause of how self-destructive and selfish he could be, but he had his fair share of noble deeds. While Bojack would pay the piper for what he had done, Bojack had shown some internal growth as a person throughout the show.</p>
<p>10  Fixes An Engagement He Almost Broke
Season 3, Episode 5, &ldquo;Love And/Or Marriage&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bojack unintentionally makes a bride reconsider her upcoming marriage to her wife-to-be after his cliché speech about love completing people. To save the wedding, Bojack comforts her by telling her that she should settle while finding someone she&rsquo;s attached to, or she&rsquo;ll risk becoming lonelier and more miserable as she ages, which features one of Bojack Horseman&rsquo;s saddest quotes. While the speech makes Bojack realize how alone he truly is, his words save the wedding. Bojack could have said Tenishia&rsquo;s cold feet weren&rsquo;t his problem since she chose to have second thoughts, but Bojack was willing to bum himself out to save a marriage.</p>
<p>9  Returning A Baby Seahorse To His Father
Season 3, Episode 4, &ldquo;Fish Out Of Water&rdquo;</p>
<p>While doing a tour for Secretariat during the Pacific Ocean Film Festival, Bojack suddenly finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place when he&rsquo;s left alone with a baby seahorse underwater with no idea where he is. From there on out, Bojack does everything in his power to help and protect the baby seahorse in his efforts to return him to his dad while not being able to speak. Bojack ultimately succeeds in the mostly dialogue-less episode, but in one of the sadder twists, he realizes he felt nothing inside when it was all over. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t rewarded for his good deed, Bojack did something he knew was right.

<p>8  Wants To Do Kelsey&rsquo;s New Movie After Getting Her Fired
Season 3, Episode 8, &ldquo;Old Acquaintance&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bojack had always felt guilty for inadvertently getting Kelsey Jannings fired when all they wanted to do was make the dream Secretariat movie they wanted. Bojack gets his chance when he lets Kelsey know that he&rsquo;s onboard for her new movie Jelle Belle, a movie that will feel real, as she put it. While it doesn&rsquo;t end well, Bojack, for once, does more than say he is sorry. He actually earnestly tries to make amends with someone he unintentionally wronged. Even though their time working together was brief, Bojack felt a strong enough connection that he jumped at the first chance to work with her again.</p>
<p>7  Supports Todd&rsquo;s Asexuality
Season 4, Episode 3, &ldquo;Hooray! Todd Episode!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bojack is among the first people whom Todd confides in regarding his asexuality. Desperately wanting to make amends with Todd, Bojack lets Todd know that it&rsquo;s okay for him to be asexual. While Todd lets Bojack know that he still hurt him, he reveals how good it feels to be open about being asexual after Bojack&rsquo;s encouragement. Even though the two weren&rsquo;t on the best terms, Bojack&rsquo;s support helps Todd pursue his sexual orientation. This would not be the last time Bojack would help Todd out in his dating game.</p>
<p>6  Tells Hollyhock Her Inner Negative Thoughts Will Go Away
Season 4, Episode 6, &ldquo;Stupid Piece of S***&rdquo;</p>
<p>After spending the day dwelling in self-hatred thoughts, Bojack hears from Hollyhock that she, too, has a voice in her head that tells her negative things in one of Bojack Horseman&rsquo;s saddest moments. When she asks if those thoughts go away as she ages, Bojack assures her that they do. Sure, it&rsquo;s based on a lie, but Bojack does this because he doesn&rsquo;t want what he thought was his daughter to not end up like him.</p>
<p>5  Tells Todd How Much He Means To Him
Season 2, Episode 12, &ldquo;Out to Sea&rdquo;</p>

When she tells him what she&rsquo;s done, he decides to do the show despite not knowing anything about it. Princess Carolyn has a laundry list of how often she stuck her neck out for Bojack. Bojack returning the favor for once showed he truly cared about her. After doing so, he even encourages her to pursue being a mother, as he knows firsthand how good of a mom she would be.</p>

<p>2  Finding Hollyhock&rsquo;s Mother
Season 4, Episode 12, &ldquo;What Time Is It Right Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big mystery in season 4 was discovering who Hollyhock&rsquo;s mom was. It was revealed in the previous episode that Hollyhock was, in fact, not Bojack&rsquo;s daughter, but his half-sister. When Bojack finally gets a clue about who her mother is, not only does Bojack figure out his half-sister&rsquo;s real parentage, but he also gets her mother&rsquo;s contact info so that Hollyhock will get in touch. Above all else though, Bojack doesn&rsquo;t even want to take credit for it, as he just wants Hollyhock to get closure. His actions can be attributed to Hollyhock being happy, like any big brother would.</p>
<p>1  Choosing To Comfort His Senile Mother In Their Last Moment
Season 4, Episode 11, &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s Arrow&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bojack had long-standing and understandable contempt for his abusive mother, Beatice. In fact, when he found out she wasn&rsquo;t going to live much longer due to her Alzheimer&rsquo;s, he originally planned to cuss her out the first moment she snapped out of her Alzheimer&rsquo;s, even if it was for a brief moment. When Bojack finally gets his shot when Beatrice terrifyingly asks him what&rsquo;s happening, he makes up a fake setting to comfort her in one of Bojack Horseman&rsquo;s saddest episode endings. Despite the fact that Beatrice inflicted more damage on Bojack than anyone, he decides to make one of his final moments with his mother a peaceful one.
Bojack realized over time that being a good person requires effort, which wasn&rsquo;t exactly for him to do, but he was at times willing to do it. In the end, the bad deeds Bojack outweighed the good, but the amount of good Bojack did prove he wasn&rsquo;t beyond redemption. Even though Bojack was rightfully held accountable for his actions in Bojack Horseman, he showed that he was clearly capable of doing good when given the chance.
Bojack Horseman can be streamed on Netflix.</p>
