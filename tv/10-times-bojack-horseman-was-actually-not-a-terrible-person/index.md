## Literature Review
Though Bojack suffered consequences for his bad actions, he proved multiple times throughout the show&#39;s run that he was capable of good.




Throughout the course of Bojack Horseman, despite Bojack doing multiple bad deeds, there were times when he showed he wasn&#39;t a horrible person. These moments were few and far between, but Bojack proved that he wasn&#39;t a monster. To be clear, there were several times when he tried to act noble to appease his ego, like when he apologized to Herb Kazzazz in Bojack Horseman&#39;s turning point, but there were other times when Bojack truly tried and succeeded at being a good person.
Bojack Horseman is considered one of the best Netflix animated shows ever made because it never held back when Bojack suffered consequences for his actions. In fact, he was considered the worst character in Bojack Horsemanbecause of how self-destructive and selfish he could be, but he had his fair share of noble deeds. While Bojack would pay the piper for what he had done, Bojack had shown some internal growth as a person throughout the show.

While the speech makes Bojack realize how alone he truly is, his words save the wedding.

Even though he wasn&#39;t rewarded for his good deed, Bojack did something he knew was right.
