## Literature Review

Society of the Snow offers a devastating depiction of the Miracle in the Andes, and the movie&#39;s timeline covers all the tragedy&#39;s major events.

Unlike earlier movies about the same catastrophe, Netflix’s Society of the Snow depicts the tragic timeline of the infamous Uruguayan plane crash with unerring accuracy. Society of the Snow is a 2023 survival movie directed by J.A. Bayona. The movie tells the story of the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crash and its survivors and their struggle to escape the Andes with their lives. In October 1972, this flight crashed into an isolated mountain range outside Chile. Many of the 45 crew members and passengers were killed instantly and many more soon succumbed to injuries, freezing temperatures, and inhospitable terrain.

However, 16 survivors made it out of the ordeal alive. While 2023’s Society of the Snow changes some elements of their stories, the movie’s depiction of the tragic events is still incredibly true to life. Bayona spoke directly to the surviving members of the Old Christians Club rugby union team who were among the survivors, and he relied on firsthand accounts to ensure the movie’s timeline was as faithful as possible. The group’s ordeal lasted 72 days in total, but it can be somewhat tricky to work out the order of events.





 The Plane Crashes In The Andes – Day 1 
The original crash kills five people
          

Society of the Snow’s plane crash initially claims the lives of five victims. Francisco Nicola, the team’s doctor, and his wife Esther Horta Pérez de Nicola are among the dead, as is the plane’s pilot, Julio Cesar Ferradas. This makes the plight of the survivors significantly worse, depriving them of medical expertise and flying experience. However, as Society of the Snow’s ending proves, there was never any chance of the survivors using the plane to contact the outside world. Their only hope for survival involved trekking the perilous distance between the desolate mountaintop and the neighboring nation of Chile.



 Five More People Die From Injuries – Day 2 
Five further crash survivors die on the second day
          




While the crash itself immediately claims the lives of five people, a further five die from exposure, existing injuries, and exhaustion the next day. These include the plane’s co-pilot, Dante Héctor Lagurara, as well as Felipe Maquirriain, ”Panchito&#34; Abal, and Julio Martínez-Lamas. This takes a toll on the group, who are still hoping for a swift rescue at this stage. It is some time before the survivors brave a trek to the top of the mountain they are stranded on and discover that they are nowhere near as close to Chile, and civilization, as they thought.



 Nando&#39;s Sister Susanna Parrado Dies – Day 9 
The loss of Nando’s sister marks a turning point
          

Nine days after the crash, Nando Parrado’s sister Susanna dies from a combination of injuries sustained during the crash and exhaustion. This tragedy leads numerous survivors to reconsider their plight, with a handful of them consenting to having their remains consumed in the event of their death. Society of the Snow removed some heartbreaking details from the true story that came to be known as the &#34;Miracle in the Andes,&#34; but Susanna’s death and its aftermath are still among the movie’s most moving moments. The group struggles to find a way out of their plight in the days that follow.






 Those Who Fell Out Of The Plane Are Found Dead – Day 12 
A search for batteries leads to a horrific revelation
          

Numerous survivors search for the tail of the plane, hoping to find batteries that would make the radio work. Instead, they make a heartbreaking discovery. Numerous dead bodies are found frozen in the snow, including the remains of Gaston Costemalle, Ramon Martinez, Ovidio Ramirez, Alexis Hounie, Guido Magri, and Daniel Shaw. None of those found dead were older than thirty, and the youngest was only twenty years old.



 The Avalanche Kills 8 More People – Day 17 
A deluge of snow suffocates numerous survivors
         

Seventeen days after the crash, an avalanche pushes thousands of pounds of snow into the fuselage where the survivors are living, claiming eight more lives. Among those killed are Liliana Methol and Marcelo Perez, the team’s captain and their de facto leader. The survivors had apologized to Marcelo earlier when they were forced to resort to cannibalism after Susanna’s death, and his loss is a crushing blow to their morale. The survivors also lose Diego Storm, Carlos Roque, Daniel Maspons, Enrique Platero, Juan Carlos Menendez, and Gustavo “Coco” Nicolich.






 The Survivors Learn The Rescue Mission Has Ended — Day 58 
The rescue mission’s dwindling efforts are heard via a radio broadcast
          

As the number of Society of the Snow’s survivors falls, the group loses hope of any potential rescue. This is only worsened when, 58 days after the crash, they hear a radio broadcast that announces rescue efforts are wrapping up, having been deemed unsuccessful. While this initially seems like another bleak blow for the dwindling number of survivors, it later becomes a major impetus for some of them to eventually risk a treacherous hike toward civilization.



 Numa Turcatti Dies — Day 60 
The movie’s narrator passes away shortly before the expedition leaves
          

Society of the Snow’s narrator, Numa Turcatti, dies after 60 days in the wilderness, owing partially to his decision to eat less than others. While many of the survivors are forced to subsist on human remains, Numa dies peacefully and gives his life to his friends, tacitly allowing them to consume his remains to survive. After this tragedy, Roberto Canessa, Nando Parrado, and Antonio “Tintin” Vizintín leave the camp in an attempt to reach Chile and find help.






 Nando, Tintin, and Roberto Leave — Day 60 
Three survivors trek toward Chile, but one returns early in the journey
          

After the death of Society of the Snow’s narrator Numa, three survivors begin the dangerous, exhausting hike toward Chile. However, it quickly becomes clear that this undertaking is even more intense than they imagined. Upon arriving at the mountaintop, the three survivors reconsider their plan and, due to limited rations, send one member of the party back to the wreckage. Tintin climbs back down the mountainside as Nando and Roberto forge on ahead.



 Nando and Roberto Reach Civilization — Day 69 
The two exhausted survivors meet a Chilean farmer by a river
          

After Tintin returns to the camp, the survivors continue to eke out a bleak, brutal existence for the following nine days. Nando and Roberto scarcely fare any better, almost succumbing to death numerous times during their lengthy hike. However, the pair eventually reach a riverside where they see animal life and, soon after, a rancher who spots them. After throwing him a note explaining their plight, the two survivors are finally given a warm bed and a hot meal as the rancher alerts the authorities.






 The Survivors Hear About Nando and Roberto’s Success— Day 71 
The radio brings news of the group’s impending rescue
          

The survivors of Society of the Snow learn of Nando and Roberto’s success via a radio broadcast 71 days after the crash and 11 days after Numa’s death. They celebrate as they await rescue, and it is here that Bayona’s movie makes one of its rare digressions from reality. The rescue helicopter arrives later on Day 71 and the survivors are finally rescued after over two months in the wilderness, but the real-life helicopter only took half of Society of the Snow’s survivors off the mountain before returning the next day for the others and the rescue workers aiding them.
