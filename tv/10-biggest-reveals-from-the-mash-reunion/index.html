<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The special MASH reunion is a definitive look back at the groundbreaking series featuring several reveals about its production and storylines.</p>
<p>The MASH reunion included several big reveals about the inner workings of making the series, including how some of its biggest elements came to be. When CBS greenlit the project in the early &rsquo;70s, it was already the second adaptation of Richard Hooker&rsquo;s book — MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors. The success of Robert Altman&rsquo;s film was a double-edged sword for the war show, but it eventually proved that the story was so much better with a longer storytelling format. 40 years since it ended in 1983 with the highest-rated TV episode, &ldquo;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen,&rdquo; MASH remains at the forefront of pop culture, and somehow, eternally relevant.
Due to its cultural impact, not to mention broadcasting success, there have been several MASH reunions since it ended in 1983. In 2002, there was also a Fox special that celebrated the show&rsquo;s 30th anniversary. The 4077 base camp was recreated, and the majority of the cast came together for a fun get-together. More recently, there was another MASH reunion five years ago, albeit unofficially, as cast members appeared for a special episode of Alan Alda&rsquo;s podcast, Clear+Vivid. The latest one had a different format from its predecessors, but it still featured several new reveals about the beloved war comedy drama.</p>
<p>All 11 Seasons Of MASH, Ranked
MASH is one of the most groundbreaking shows ever. While it maintained its quality throughout its run, some of its seasons were better than others.</p>
<p>10  The MASH Pilot Was Written In Just Two Days
CBS&rsquo; MASH pilot was written by Larry Gelbart.</p>
<p>MASH had some kinks it had to work on when it debuted in 1972. However, what was clear from the get-go was the chemistry of its cast. Aside from assembling a great ensemble, another reason why it was so obvious was through the story of the pilot. Written by Larry Gelbart, who eventually wrote and produced more episodes, the premiere simply titled &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; was written in just two days. Gelbart himself said this in archival footage featured in the new MASH reunion.</p>
<p>9  MASH Season 1’s Poor Rating Was Because Of Its Timeslot
MASH originally aired on Sundays at 8 pm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to think of MASH as a ratings failure, but it was that throughout the entirety of its freshman year. At the end of its first season, it was at the bottom of the ranking at the 51st slot. Despite receiving rave reviews from critics, not to mention having some brand recognition due to the successful movie that preceded it, MASH couldn&rsquo;t find its audience. Ultimately, things changed when it changed timeslots from having heavy competition at 8 pm on Sundays to 8:30 on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Every MASH Character Who Didn’t Return For The Sequel Show (&amp; Why)
After MASH ended in 1983, CBS launched its sequel series, AfterMASH, but several notable 4077 characters didn&rsquo;t return for the short-lived project.</p>
<p>8  Alan Alda Was In Prison When He Got The MASH Script
The Hawkeye actor was in a prison in Iowa working on a movie.</p>
<p>While MASH was an ensemble, its true lead was arguably Alan Alda&rsquo;s Captain Benjamin &ldquo;Hawkeye&rdquo; Pierce. The actor not only became the face of the series, but he also expanded his creative impact on the series by directing, writing, and even producing the CBS medical comedy-drama. The way he came across the project was nothing short of odd, however, as he received the script for MASH while he was in prison in Iowa. He wasn&rsquo;t incarcerated, he was just there filming a movie.</p>
<p>7  Loretta Swit Had To Fight For Hot Lips’ MASH Arc
Hot Lips eventually became Margaret Houlihan.</p>
<p>As the only main female character in MASH, Loretta Swit&rsquo;s Margaret went through an extensive personal arc in the series, mainly in terms of her love life. After her affair with Frank Burns, she got married and divorced. Despite her flaws, it&rsquo;s difficult to find fault in her commitment to her sworn responsibility as a military nurse. Over time, she became more than just a love interest and nurse, she became a fully fleshed-out character — something that Swit had to fight her way throughout the show. She wanted to outgrow Margaret&rsquo;s Hot Lips persona, and at the end of MASH, she did.</p>
<p>6  Klinger’s MASH Cross-Dressing Was Divisive
Jamie Farr&rsquo;s Klinger stopped wearing dresses in MASH season 8.</p>
<p>Played by Jamie Farr, Klinger was introduced a few episodes after MASH premiered. He was best known for cross-dressing during the first several years of the series as a way to convince the army to give him a Section 8, which would deem him unfit to serve in the military. Writer and producer Burt Metcalfe revealed that he thought that the bit went for far too long than it needed to. Meanwhile, Radar actor Gary Burghoff straight-up confessed that he hated the whole schtick.</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;Sometimes You Hear The Bullet&rdquo; Changed MASH Forever
MASH&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sometimes You Hear The Bullet&rdquo; was its first dramedy.</p>
<p>MASH was pitched as a sitcom, but calling it that feels inaccurate and misleading now. When the show premiered, however, it leaned into the silliness and hilarity of the 4077 personnel, spearheaded by Hawkeye and Trapper John McIntyre. It was a gradual shift to find the delicate balance between comedy and drama, considering that its backdrop was a horrible war. That being said, it all started with MASH season 1, episode 17, &ldquo;Sometimes You Hear the Bullet,&rdquo; where Hawkeye&rsquo;s friend from back home dies on his operating table. It was the first time the show killed an important character, and it motivated them to be bolder in their storytelling.</p>
<p>MASH&rsquo;s New Reunion Is An Important Reminder Of What The Show&rsquo;s Best Seasons Were
Several members of the 4077 will re-assemble for a special MASH reunion, which will function as an effective reminder of its best years.</p>
<p>4  McLean Stevenson’s MASH Exit Was Due To External Factors
Stevenson had regrets about leaving MASH.</p>
<p>Henry Blake&rsquo;s death is arguably the most shocking MASH plot twist, but his demise came on the heels of McLean Stevenson&rsquo;s decision to leave the series. Executive producer Gene Reynolds recalled in the MASH reunion special that there were people around him that some people were convincing him that he could have his own show based on the success of MASH. In Stevenson&rsquo;s archival footage, he admitted that he got carried away by those whispers, failing to realize that people loved Blake but didn&rsquo;t care much about the actor playing it.</p>
<p>3  Harry Morgan Previously Played A Different MASH Character
Morgan was previously mentally unbalanced Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele in MASH.</p>
<p>As ineffective as he was as the 4077&rsquo;s commanding officer, it was still a tall order to replace Blake. Somehow, however, MASH was able to do it when it brought in Harry Morgan&rsquo;s Sherm Potter. What makes this casting more impressive is the fact that Morgan already played a different role in the show just a couple of years earlier in mentally unbalanced Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele. Considering how different the characters were, it&rsquo;s easy to forget this double casting. For what it&rsquo;s worth, he played both brilliantly, but he fit Potter so much better.</p>
<p>2  Gary Burghoff’s MASH Exit Was Less Dramatic
Burghoff was the only actor who both appeared in the show and the film.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of rumors about the real reason Burghoff left MASH as Radar. For starters, he was the last major original cast member to leave the series, and he was the only actor who both starred in the CBS war comedy-drama and Altman&rsquo;s film in 1970. However, the actor cleared things up in the new Fox special, and it wasn&rsquo;t as dramatic as reported. According to him, his contract simply expired, and he didn&rsquo;t re-negotiate because he was stepping back from everything to deal with some personal issues. He did get to re-do some of the scenes in his farewell episodes to get it right.</p>
<p>MASH: Trapper Actually Said Goodbye To Hawkeye (You Just Missed It)
Trapper&rsquo;s unexpected departure from the 4077 left Hawkeye distraught, but Wayne Rogers&rsquo; characters actually bade his Swamp-mate in MASH.</p>
<p>1  One Of MASH’s Best Episodes Was Improvised
&ldquo;The Interview&rdquo; was Gelbart&rsquo;s final episode in MASH.</p>
<p>MASH had so many great episodes. It did have a weekly format, but from time to time, it ventured out creatively to do something groundbreaking. One of, if not its greatest episode, however, happened to be the final outing that Gelbart directed and wrote — the MASH season 3 finale, &ldquo;The Interview.&rdquo; Apparently, it was largely improvised, with the cast given a set of questions and being asked to answer them like their characters. There were some changes, but the majority of their responses were retained. It was a risky move that paid off big time.</p>
<p>M<em>A</em>S<em>H
Originally adapted from the 1970 film of the same name, M</em>A<em>S</em>H encompasses comedy, drama, and everything in between as it follows the lives of army doctors stationed in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.</p>
