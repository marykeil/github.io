## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner feels some regret as he works through making his final decision, wondering if he made a mistake taking the lead.




The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner is close to making his final decision, but he&#39;s worried that the level of heartbreak he&#39;s going to deliver to one of his finalists is cause for regret surrounding his entire experience. Gerry tragically lost his wife Toni in 2017 and has been working his way through a phenomenal group of women to find the second love of his life. The first lead of the Bachelor Nation spin-off, Gerry has taken the franchise by storm with his charismatic nature and his open, honest communication about his journey. While he may be ready to make his choice, Gerry seems to be struggling with his emotions.




In a preview from The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale from ET, Gerry explains that he has mixed emotions about his final decision after knowing what he needs to do post-Fantasy Suite dates. &#34;I&#39;m going to propose to the woman that I love,&#34; Gerry explains before revealing, &#34;[but I] took a really good person and broke their heart.&#34; While Gerry is looking ahead, he regrets the experience of having to hurt someone so deeply. &#34;Had I known this would be how much pain I would cause someone, I would&#39;ve never taken the first step in this journey,&#34; Gerry shares, clearly pained.


 Will Gerry Turner Regret His Final Golden Bachelor Decision? 
          

Gerry may be ready to start the next chapter of his life with either Theresa Nist or Leslie Fhima, but he understands that in doing so, he&#39;ll have to hurt whoever he doesn&#39;t choose. This is the name of the game in Bachelor Nation, but having formed such genuine connections with both women, it&#39;s not a surprise that he doesn&#39;t want to hurt anybody. In the preview, Gerry explains, &#34;The only time I&#39;ve ever felt worse in my whole life is when my wife passed away, and this is [a close second].&#34; Bringing someone so much pain may be tough, but Gerry will ultimately make the best decision he can.





 

While Gerry mentions feeling he made a mistake in the preview, it doesn&#39;t seem to be about his final decision as much as he&#39;s not at peace with the pain he has to cause. Gerry, who&#39;s been one of the most emotionally vulnerable leads Bachelor Nation has ever seen, explained that he regrets the fact that he has to cause someone so much hurt, but his final decision will be empowering. It feels clear that Gerry will make the right decision for himself and his future, and even if that means breaking someone&#39;s heart, the endgame will be worth it for Gerry and his final rose recipient.
