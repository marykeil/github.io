## Literature Review
The Game of Thrones franchise is only getting bigger and a House of the Dragon prequel entitled Nine Voyages is another GoT project on the horizon.




The Game of Thrones franchise is only getting bigger with the announcement of a House of the Dragon prequel series entitled Nine Voyages. Based on the epic fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, House of the Dragon follows the Targaryen clan as they are locked in a brutal power struggle centuries before the events of Game of Thrones. The spinoff series has proven to be another big hit for HBO, and the network has begun developing a cavalcade of other GoT TV shows, including a prequel to House of the Dragon that will follow a young Corlys Velaryon.




The original Game of Thrones series went off the air in 2019 after ruling the TV landscape for the better part of a decade and scoring dozens of awards and accolades. Not long afterward, House of the Dragon premiered, proving that fans were eager for more high-fantasy action. A slew of Game of Thrones spinoff shows and prequels were announced, but some projects have fallen to the wayside while others have moved forward. Now, a Velaryon prequel called Nine Voyages is taking the next step toward reaching the airwaves.


 Nine Voyages Latest News 
          

Breaking away from the pack of other Game of Thrones spinoff shows, the latest news regarding the House of the Dragon prequel is that Nine Voyages will now be an animated series. Author George R.R. Martin has spoken candidly about the Velaryon spinoff, and the legendary fantasy scribe took to his personal website to reveal that the show will no longer be a live-action project. &#34;Budgetary constraints would likely have made a live action version prohibitively expensive&#34; Martin explained, conceding that the show&#39;s concept is better suited for animation.




Revealing even more about the long-gestating idea, Martin provided another update on the animated spinoff when he explained that Nine Voyages was about to take the &#34;next step&#34; in its production journey. Once again on his website, Martin explained that though Nine Voyages hasn&#39;t been officially green-lit by HBO, the development is moving along swimmingly and might very soon be a fully realized project.



 Nine Voyages Is Confirmed 
          

Striking while the iron was hot, HBO announced a host of Game of Thrones spinoffs and sequel series, and though some have been scrapped, others like Nine Voyages are making progress. Nine Voyages is confirmed, though it hasn&#39;t been officially green-lit by the network. This isn&#39;t particularly surprising, since HBO will probably wait until the development is completed before it decides to put it on the production schedule. That being said, it might be a long while before Corlys Velaryon sets sail.






 How Nine Voyages Connects To House Of The Dragon 
          

Essentially, Nine Voyages will serve as a prequel to House of the Dragon which is itself a prequel to Game of Thrones. The series will take place a few decades before the events of House of the Dragon, and will flesh out Corlys Velaryon&#39;s character as he becomes the legendary Sea Snake. Most importantly, it will also provide a crucial backstory on the Velaryon family itself, while also exploring other corners of Westeros and Essos.

 Nine Voyages Story 
          

Though details haven&#39;t been revealed, the basic framework of Nine Voyages will be Corlys Velaryon&#39;s nine adventures aboard the ship Sea Snake which made him such a legendary figure. Since it takes place years before House of the Dragon, it follows a much younger and less experienced Corlys, and will likely go a long way in explaining his past as well as his family&#39;s history. It is unclear how the titular voyages will be chronicled in Nine Voyages, but they will probably span a length of years and show off unexplored corners of the Game of Thrones universe.
