## Literature Review
RHOBH alum Taylor Armstrong suffered a tragic loss while on the show. She is now enjoying life with her husband, John H. Bluher, and daughter Kennedy.




The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum Taylor Armstrong had a chaotic life before she met her now-husband, John H. Bluher. Taylor was one of the original cast members of RHOBH and was only on for a short time. However, during her three seasons, Taylor experienced many dramatic events that RHOBH fans still discuss today. During her time on the show, Taylor admitted she was being physically abused, only to suffer the tragic loss of her first husband, Russell Armstrong. Now that RHOBH season 13 is airing, it&#39;s time to revisit an iconic alum.




It seemed as if Taylor&#39;s life with Russell and her daughter, Kennedy Armstrong, was perfect. However, it was soon revealed that Russell was physically and emotionally abusive towards Taylor and had even dislocated her jaw at one time. In 2011, Taylor filed for divorce from Russell, and tragically, months later, he committed suicide. After Russell’s death, Taylor was hit with lawsuits from Russell’s previous financial dealings. The RHOBH star sought financial and legal advice from John, a successful lawyer, and after working closely together, the two eventually fell in love.
