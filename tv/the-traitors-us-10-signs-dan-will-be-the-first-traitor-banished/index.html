  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Dan Gheesling is a legendary reality TV player known for his strategic gameplay on Big Brother 10 and 14.
His fellow cast members on The Traitors US season 2 are aware of his previous strategies, which may work against him.
Dan&rsquo;s lack of a poker face and his difficulty forming new relationships may make him an easy target for elimination on The Traitors US.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Traitors US season 2&rsquo;s Dan Gheesling was meant to be a Traitor but is his time in the game coming to an end early? Many believe he&rsquo;ll be banished.</p>
<p>The Traitors US season 2 marks the return of Big Brother’s Dan Gheesling, who’s playing the game after a ten-year absence from reality TV, but many believe he’ll be the first traitor banished from the game. Dan’s time on Big Brother was nothing short of legendary. His first time on the game during Big Brother 10 was a milestone season for the series, where the game reverted to its most basic form. In a season of very few twists, Dan was able to provide the entertainment and strategy as he swept through the house and played some of the most interesting game moves the show had ever seen.
Dan won his first season of Big Brother, then took a few years away before returning for Big Brother 14. Dan’s role in the early weeks of BB 14 wasn’t to play, but to coach newbies on how to best navigate the game. Dan and the rest of his coaches, including The Traitors US season 2 co-star Janelle Pierzina, chose to reset the game after the first few weeks which allowed them to play rather than coach. Dan made it to the final 2, taking second place. While Dan’s incredibly strategic, some believe he won’t last on The Traitors US.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>10  Dan’s A Reality TV Legend
The Cast Is Aware He’s Played Strategy Games To Win Before</p>
<p>Although he’s been retired for over a decade, Dan is a true reality TV legend. Having played Big Brother during its golden era on BB 10 and BB 14, Dan was able to navigate some of the most complicated gameplay that the series has ever seen. From playing a game of replacement nominee roulette during BB 10 that sent the rest of the house into chaos to hosting his own Big Brother funeral during BB 14, Dan’s familiar with having to play tremendously hard to win the game. This will work to his disadvantage during his time on The Traitors US, as his fellow cast members know his strategies.</p>
<p>9  Dan’s Too Aware Of His Surroundings
He Knows The People He’s Playing With To A Fault</p>
<p>With a cast full of reality TV legends, Dan’s been able to play the game with people he’s known from his own experiences on screen and ones he’s met in the past. Despite only having played with one The Traitors US season 2 cast member before, Dan’s connections in the game were clear upon his arrival to the castle. He’s already been lumped with the other strategy game players, something he’s aware of as he works to keep his identity as a Traitor under wraps. Unfortunately, the fact that Dan’s hyperaware of the people in the game is a detriment to him, as he’ll easily come across as more suspicious.</p>
<p>8  Dan Doesn’t Have The Poker Face To Win
He Thinks He Knows How To Tell A Great Lie</p>
<p>While Dan’s been able to mask the way he’s feeling in the past, his poker face isn’t what it used to be. Dan has worked hard during past seasons of Big Brother to remain stoic in sensitive moments, or not to react to big drama. The Traitors US is a whole different kind of beast that requires a level of precision Dan isn’t used to anymore. After years away from strategy games, Dan’s clearly found it tougher to simply blend in and lie to the faces of the people he’s trying to pull one over on.</p>
<p>7  Dan’s Getting Sniffed Out By Others
He’s Been Called Out As A Potential Traitor</p>
<p>Although Dan’s been working overtime to ensure his name is cleared by the rest of The Traitors US season 2 cast, he’s already getting sussed out by others. While there have been other names that have been called out during the round tables, Dan’s name has also been thrown out for several people who have felt he’s too quiet and calculating. Though he’s done his best to defend his actions, Dan has been called out as a potential Traitor more than once, and it will likely continue happening.</p>
<p>6  Dan’s Able To Align With People He Knows Already
He Has Former Allies In The Game, Which Could Hurt Him</p>
<p>With Dan coming into the game with one of the biggest targets on his back from the beginning, the fact that he has former allies in the cast may not be something that helps him in the long run. While Dan will be able to use his connection with Janelle to some advantage, it’s possible that the fact that he has her on his side could make him look suspect, depending on her positioning in the house. While Dan’s forged relationships with other people, it’ll be difficult for them to look past the successes he’s had in his career enough to think he’s not deceiving them.</p>
<p>5  Dan’s Having Trouble Connections With The Rest Of The Traitors US Cast
He Hasn’t Been Able To Develop New Relationships</p>
<p>Though he’s trying to make connections with other people in the game, Dan’s been having a hard time developing relationships with people he didn’t know before The Traitors US season 2. With his allies backing him up, Dan’s been able to move through the game unscathed, but as things heat up on The Traitors US season 2, it won’t be as easy for him to continue on undetected. As Dan hasn’t been able to bond as closely with some of his fellow cast members, it’s more likely that he’ll be discovered as a Traitor by someone who’s not close to him.</p>
<p>4  Dan’s Been Struggling To Talk Himself Out Of Tough Situations
He Has A Track Record For Escaping Rough Times</p>
<p>Although Dan typically has a knack for being able to talk his way out of any situation, his words are failing him on The Traitors US season 2. With Dan’s ability to use his words to keep him safe, his time on Big Brother was fascinating to watch as he was agile enough to be able to go from tremendously in danger to entirely safe in a matter of moments. During his time on The Traitors US, Dan’s words haven’t been as strong. It’s been clear that he’s been struggling to talk his way out of things that would’ve been a breeze for him a decade ago.</p>
<p>3  Dan Came Out Of Retirement To Play The Traitors
He’s Been Away From Reality TV For A Long Time</p>
<p>Playing Big Brother 14 and coming in second was exciting for Dan, but he was stung by a bitter jury who didn’t choose him to win the game because of the personal issues they had with him during the game. Even though Dan said he wouldn’t be returning to reality TV, he chose to come onto The Traitors US for the opportunity to play a game he really enjoyed following during the first season. Dan’s strategic gameplay has changed over time, and the fact that he’s been away from reality TV for so long means things have changed without him, making it more difficult for his strategies to truly work.</p>
<p>2  Dan’s Looking To Prove He Can Still Win
He’s Going To Come Off Way Too Obvious</p>
<p>While Dan’s rejected reality TV in the last decade, he’s still been doing his best to engage with his viewers and keep his following. Dan’s abilities have always been strong, and the fact that he chose to come back for an intriguing series was something that made his viewers excited. Unfortunately, the fact that Dan is on the hunt to win on The Traitors US season 2 is far too obvious to the other players he’s up against. His drive to win, while something he shares with his fellow competitors, could be the thing that gets him banished from the game.</p>
<p>1  Dan’s Unable To Sway People’s Opinions
He’s Working Too Hard To Keep Himself In The Game</p>
<p>In the past, Dan’s been able to persuade people to think the way he’s thought or do what he wants them to do. He was skilled at the art of persuasion and manipulation on Big Brother, but moving into The Traitors US, things have changed. Dan’s abilities to sway people’s opinions have begun to come off desperate on The Traitors US, and it’s too obvious that he’s working too hard to keep himself safe in the game. While his opponents may not realize just why he’s working as hard as he is to keep himself safe, Dan’s time on The Traitors US could end because he’s pushing hard.</p>
