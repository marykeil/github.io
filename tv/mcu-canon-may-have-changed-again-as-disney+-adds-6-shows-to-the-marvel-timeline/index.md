## Literature Review
The Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline on Disney&#43; is finally acknowledging the original Marvel TV era as six TV shows join the lineup on the streamer.




Disney&#43; is attempting to clear up the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon by adding a total of six Marvel TV shows to the timeline. With Disney&#43; releasing multiple Marvel Studios shows in recent history, the original Marvel TV division has been under a closer spotlight than ever as the predecessor to the Disney&#43; roster. However, with the lack of crossovers between the original Marvel shows and the MCU&#39;s movies, many have questioned how Marvel&#39;s TV properties fit into the MCU, and which - if any - could still be considered fully part of the larger franchise&#39;s canon.




Interestingly, it appears someone is having a change of heart when it comes to some of the Marvel TV shows before the Disney&#43; era. With the release of the Echo TV show on Disney&#43; (via Phase Zero), the streaming platform came with an update for the MCU timeline.


 

When Disney&#43; users go on to the Marvel tab on the streaming service, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, and The Punisher are included in the MCU slate. This comes shortly after Disney&#43; and Marvel Studios released an Echo trailer that included footage from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil TV show. It should be noted that the official MCU timeline book does not include any of the Marvel Netflix shows.

 When Daredevil &amp; The Defenders Happen In The Disney&#43; MCU Timeline 
         

While Marvel Studios and/or Kevin Feige still need to officially confirm the shows in canon, Disney&#43; has a particularly interesting order of where each series fits into the franchise. With Daredevil and Jessica Jones paired up after the Guardians of the Galaxy movies right before Avengers: Age of Ultron, that makes them part of Phase 2. Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and The Defenders are placed right after Ant-Man - which ended Phase 2 - but still count as part of that era of the timeline, since Phase 3 officially started with Captain America: Civil War. The only Marvel Netflix show that is considered part of MCU Phase 3 is The Punisher, as it is set right after Spider-Man: Homecoming.



In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant, Marvel Studios producer Brad Winderbaum revealed he personally considers Netflix&#39;s Daredevil to be in The Sacred Timeline.







What remains to be seen now is whether Marvel TV shows like Runaways, Cloak &amp; Dagger, and Agents of SHIELD will join the MCU timeline, though these series may not see a similar update since they don&#39;t directly tie in to the current MCU storylines in the way that Daredevil inherently does. However, it&#39;s likely this new development has inspired hope for those who&#39;d like to see their favorite show officially acknowledged, as Disney&#43; is clearly ready to acknowledge that shows produced by the Marvel TV division may be, in one way or another, part of the larger MCU canon.
