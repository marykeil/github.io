## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 cast member Sam Wilson looks so different in his photos from when he was a teenager. Sam&#39;s face has changed dramatically.




90 Day Fiancé star Sam Wilson looks very different in his throwback photos which reveal whether he had his signature “baby face” back when he was a teenager. Sam, 30, is from Cameron, Missouri, and is engaged to Citra, 26, from Indonesia in season 10. Citra was the one who came across Sam’s profile on a dating app first, and she decided to message him about his “baby face” look. Citra found it difficult to believe that Sam was really 26 years old. Citra and Sam started talking and soon developed an attraction to each other. Two years had passed when Sam went to Bogor and proposed to Citra.




Sam and Citra are about to get married in season 10 after her father, Herman, arrives in the States to carry out Sam’s conversion to Islam. While Sam and Citra’s storyline is interesting, fans are also intrigued about the way Sam looks on TV. Citra herself has commented about Sam having a small face. However, some viewers believe Sam is missing his bottom teeth. There have been comments about how Sam looks, both 15 years old and 32 years old at the same time. Then there is speculation that Sam’s drug addiction is the root cause behind his dramatic transformation.

 90 Day Fiancé Fans Discover Sam&#39;s Teenage Photos 

 

Reddit user u/Kewchie-Lord567 found old pictures of Sam which revealed what he looked like over a decade ago. They said they discovered the pictures on Facebook and were from 2009 to 2012. Sam would have been around 14 or 15 years old in the first photo. He smiled sweetly for the camera and had short, dark hair. He wore a dark brown t-shirt with what looked like a hoodie. The second photo showed Sam a couple of years later as he looked grown up in his purple plaid button-down shirt. “He definitely lost his bottom teeth, or most of them,” wrote sansfards.




90 Day Fiancé fans such as Bubbly-Ad1346 noticed that Sam did not have a “naturally weak chin” by judging his old photos. “After seeing these pics it definitely reassures me that he’s def got dentures or lost a good majority of his bottom teeth,” wrote EquivalentPickle6575. As per viewers, Sam’s teenage pictures seem to suggest that he’s facing dental problems as a grown-up. However, as fans keep making assumptions about his appearance, Sam is trying to show that he’s not bothered by what they say about him.



 Sam Has A Past He&#39;s Kept Hidden From Citra 
          

Sam posted a recent selfie on Instagram captioned, “I look the way i look.” Sam kept his lips pursed for the photo. He tried not to show his teeth and didn&#39;t flash a smile for the camera. Sam is choosing not to talk about any medical issues that fans suspect he has. What he did reveal on season 10 was his past opiate addiction. Sam became clean when he was 22, although he did have multiple relapses in the past decade or so. Moreover, Sam started seeing a doctor and began taking a drug called Suboxone, which is a brand name for the drug buprenorphine.




SAMSHA mentions buprenorphine is the first medication to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) and has to be prescribed or dispensed in physician offices. Sam was on a work trip when he was pulled over. Police found Suboxone on him which he was carrying without prescription. Sam was arrested and put into a diversion program. He had to correct his behavior or get a criminal record. Sam missed the deadline to complete the diversion program and was facing jail time when Citra moved to the U.S. The 90 Day Fiancé star did not tell Citra about it before she moved to America because he feared she would change her mind.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
