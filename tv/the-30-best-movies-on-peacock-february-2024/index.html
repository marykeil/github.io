<p>How Peacock Compares To Netflix, HBO Max &amp; Disney+
NBC Universal&rsquo;s new streaming service Peacock is out, and we&rsquo;re taking a look at how it compares to competitors Netflix, HBO Max, and Disney+.</p>
<p>Best Drama Movies On Peacock
The Boondock Saints (1999)</p>
<p>The Boondock Saints<br>
Action
Thriller</p>
<p>Release Date    January 22, 1999     Cast    Willem Dafoe , Sean Patrick Flanery , Norman Reedus , David Della Rocco , Billy Connolly     Runtime    108 minutes</p>
<p>Despite poor reviews upon release, underground hit The Boondock Saints became a defining 90s cult classic. The movie stars Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus as fraternal twins who turn to vigilantism in order to protect their predominantly Irish Boston neighborhood. Boondock Saints was a box office failure when the studio only gave it a bare minimum theatrical release, but the movie found huge success on home video and remains popular over two decades later.

The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)</p>
<p>The Wolf of Wall Street</p>
<p>Release Date    December 25, 2013     Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Margot Robbie , Leonardo DiCaprio , Jonah Hill , Kyle Chandler     Runtime    3hours</p>
<p>With an ensemble cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Margo Robbie, Jonah Hill, and Matthew McConaughey, the 2013 Martin Scorsese drama The Wolf of Wall Street is widely regarded as one of the best movies released in the 2010s. DiCaprio&rsquo;s performance as real-life stockbroker Jordan Belfort won him a Golden Globe.
Despite winning far fewer awards than it was nominated for, The Wolf of Wall Street is a truly inimitable drama with plenty of comedic elements, and the true story it&rsquo;s based on almost defies belief. The movie is included on many critics&rsquo; Top 10 lists, with the American Film Institute ranking it as among the best released in 2013, and the UK&rsquo;s BBC placing it in the 100 greatest films of the 21st Century (via BBC).
Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)</p>
<p>Glengarry Glen Ross</p>
<p>Release Date    October 2, 1992     Director    James Foley     Cast    Al Pacino , Jack Lemmon , Alec Baldwin , Ed Harris , Alan Arkin , Kevin Spacey , Jonathan Pryce     Runtime    100 Minutes</p>
<p>Based on David Mamet&rsquo;s 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name and boasts one of the most stacked casts ever assembled. Glengarry Glen Ross proves that a movie doesn&rsquo;t need a huge budget and massive explosions in order to be dramatic, and is instead built around breakneck dialogue and powerhouse performances.
The movie follows the fortunes of a team of real estate salesmen put under immense pressure after they are informed that they have one week to outsell their coworkers, or else they will be fired. What follows is a cutthroat corporate fight to the death, replete with gloriously inventive profanity and more backstabbing than the average Game of Thrones episode, all resulting in one of the &rsquo;90s best movies.

The Passion Of The Christ (2004)</p>
<p>The Passion of the Christ</p>
<p>Release Date    March 15, 2004     Director    Mel Gibson     Cast    Jim Caviezel , Monica Bellucci , Maia Morgenstern     Runtime    127minutes</p>
<p>Controversial and gripping in equal measure, Mel Gibson&rsquo;s The Passion of the Christ is an undeniably powerful piece of work. The self-financed movie documents the final days and execution of Jesus Christ as laid out in the Bible. The film made over $612 million at the box office (via Box Office Mojo), making it the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. The Passion of the Christ also secured three Oscar nominations at the Academy Awards, despite its graphic violence and extreme scenes of torture.

Monster (2003)</p>
<p>Monster (2003)</p>
<p>Release Date    December 24, 2003     Director    Patty Jenkins     Cast    Charlize Theron , Christina Ricci , Bruce Dern , Lee Tergesen , Annie Corley     Runtime    109 Minutes</p>
<p>Although director Patty Jenkins would go on to best-known for her superhero hit Wonder Woman, her 2003 crime biopic Monster probably remains her most powerful effort to date. The movie follows the life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), a sex worker who killed seven of her male clients in two years.
2003&rsquo;s Monster charts her relationship with another woman, Selby Wall (Christian Ricci), and shows how her tragic life perhaps turned her into a cold-blooded killer. Both Theron and Ricci received praise for their performances, with Theron winning the Oscar, Golden Globe, and SAG Awards for her transformation into Aileen for the movie.

Highlander (1986)</p>
<p>Highlander</p>
<p>Director    Russell Mulcahy     Cast    Christopher Lambert , Roxanne Hart , Clancy Brown , Sean Connery , Beatie Edney , Alan North     Runtime    116 minutes</p>
<p>The original Highlander kickstarted a popular franchise that never reached the heights of its first installment. In Highlander, Connor MacLeod is an immortal being in a world where a secret war rages to determine who will be the last fighter standing. It is up to Connor to make sure that evil immortals never have the chance to claim true immortality, bringing him into battle with the murderous Kurgan (Clancy Brown). Highlander is a cult classic and spawned several sequels and even a TV series based in the same world with a different immortal MacLeod.

<p>Best Comedy Movies On Peacock
Strays (2023)</p>
<p>Strays</p>
<p>Release Date    June 9, 2023     Director    Josh Greenbaum     Cast    Will Ferrell , Jamie Foxx , Will Forte , Isla Fisher , Randall Park , Josh Gad , Brett Gelman , Rob Riggle , Jamie Demetriou , Sofia Vergara</p>
<p>Like Ted and Sausage Party, Strays may look like a movie for kids, but it certainly is not. It&rsquo;s a raunchy, crude comedy about a Border Terrier named Reggie (voiced by Will Ferrell) who is abandoned by his owner Doug (Will Forte). Officially on his own, Reggie befriends a group of stray dogs who teach him street smarts and agree to accompany him on his quest for revenge against Doug. While it was a box office bomb, what makes Strays so successful is that it knows exactly the kind of comedy it is. However, amidst the filth and foul language is a surprising amount of heart that makes it worth a watch — without the kids.

Happy Gilmore (1996)</p>
<p>Happy Gilmore</p>
<p>Release Date    February 16, 1996     Director    Dennis Dugan     Cast    Adam Sandler , Christopher McDonald , Julie Bowen , Frances Bay , Carl Weathers , Allen Covert     Runtime    92 minutes</p>
<p>Few names in comedy are as widely recognized as Adam Sandler, and one of the highlights of his career, 1996&rsquo;s Happy Gilmore, is one of the funniest movies currently available to stream on Peacock. Happy Gilmore stars Sandler as the titular Happy, a former ice hockey player with significant anger issues. After his NHL dreams are brought to a close, Happy tries his hand at a new sport — golf.
While the powerful slap shot from his hockey days makes him an outstanding golfer, Happy also finds his temperament on the rink doesn&rsquo;t translate well to the green at all. While Happy Gilmore didn&rsquo;t win over critics on release, it resonated with audiences and continues to do so, remaining arguably one of the best Adam Sandler movies of the 1990s.
Frank (2014)</p>
<p>2014 indie comedy Frank stars Michael Fassbender in the lead role, though this isn&rsquo;t immediately clear since he wears a large papier-mache mask over his head throughout the entire movie. The mask itself is styled after Frank Sidebottom, the character created by the late UK musician and comedian Chris Sievey. Frank was directed by Lenny Abrahamson and sees Fassbender&rsquo;s Frank guiding young musician Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), at least at first.
It soon becomes clear to Jon that Frank is the one who may need help and guidance, and it&rsquo;s here that the story of Frank really takes shape as it deals with themes of mental health and creative frustration. A heartwarming film throughout that nevertheless delivers on the abstract and surreal laughs, Frank is one of the strongest and most cerebral comedy movies currently available on Peacock.
The Trotsky (2009)</p>
<p>There are many movies that gain much more acclaim and renown years (and even decades) after their initial release thanks to streaming, and such is the case with 2009&rsquo;s The Trotsky, which has enjoyed a renaissance of popularity as one of the best available comedy movies on Peacock. The Trotsky stars Jay Baruchel, best known for voicing Hiccup in How to Train Your Dragon, as Leon Bronstein, a highschooler who believes himself to be the reincarnation of Soviet leader Leon Trotsky.
The Trotsky was a box office flop when it released, grossing far less than its production budget despite being received well by critics. However, the movie has found a fresh audience on Peacock, with many subscribers now citing it as one of the funniest currently available on the platform. This is partially unsurprising though, as the central themes of rebellion, dissatisfaction with the established order, and overbearing authority may resonate much more strongly with viewers in the 2020s.
Hearts Beat Loud (2018)</p>
<p>Hearts Beat Loud</p>
<p>Release Date   2018-06-08    Director   Brett Haley    Cast   Kiersey Clemons, Sasha Lane, Toni Collette, Ted Danson, Nick Offerman, Blythe Danner    Rating   PG-13</p>
<p>Starring Nick Offerman of Parks and Recreation and The Last Of Us fame, the 2018 musical comedy Hearts Beat Loud focuses on a record store owner and father who overcomes the loss of his wife by aiming for viral music success with his daughter. Understandably with such a premise, Hearts Beat Loud delivers just as strongly on the emotional moments as it does the humor, with Brett Haley and Marc Basch&rsquo;s script being incredibly heartfelt throughout. For Peacock subscribers seeking a grounded comedy with an incredibly current premise and wholesome message, Hearts Beat Loud is guaranteed to deliver.</p>
<p>Best Romance Movies On Peacock
Emma (2020)</p>
<p>Emma</p>
<p>Release Date    February 21, 2020     Director    Autumn de Wilde     Cast    Bill Nighy , Gemma Whelan , Rupert Graves , Mia Goth , Amber Anderson , Tanya Reynolds , Callum Turner , Chloe Pirrie , Josh O&rsquo;Connor , Anya Taylor-Joy , Johnny Flynn , Miranda Hart , Suzy Bloom     Runtime    124minutes</p>
<p>Among the best romance movies on Peacock is one of the best Jane Austen adaptations of the last several years — the 2020 version of Emma starring Anya Taylor-Joy as the titular Emma Woodhouse. One of the most stylish and visually distinctive takes on the classic tale so far, Emma boasts an incredible case alongside Taylor-Joy that also includes Mia Goth and Bill Nighy. While the story will doubtless be familiar to many viewers, Jane Austen is regarded as one of the best romance authors of all time for a reason, and like every other version, 2020&rsquo;s Emma showcases exactly why.
Meet Cute (2022)</p>
<p>Meet Cute</p>
<p>Release Date    September 21, 2022     Director    Alex Lehmann     Cast    Kaley Cuoco , Pete Davidson , Deborah S. Craig , Sierra Fisk     Runtime    89 minutes</p>
<p>A Peacock original rom-com, Meet Cute asks what would you do if you could create the perfect romantic partner? The movie follows Sheila (Kaley Cuoco), a woman who meets the shy Gary (Pete Davidson) at a bar. The two have a romantic date on the town, but there&rsquo;s a twist: Sheila has been using time travel to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s past wounds and traumas and mold him into her ideal man.
With the likes of Palm Springs and the forever-classic Groundhog Dog, time travel rom-coms are becoming a popular genre, and though Meet Cute will likely never achieve icon status, it poses some interesting questions about pain, healing, and ethics, and how they relate to love. Cuoco and Davidson are both charming actors, and their easy chemistry makes the movie feel like it passes by in no time at all.

Sliding Doors (1998)</p>
<p>Sliding Doors (1998)</p>
<p>Release Date    April 24, 1998     Director    Peter Howitt     Cast    gwyneth paltrow , John Hannah , John Lynch , Jeanne Tripplehorn</p>
<p>A classic &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; story, Sliding Doors uses an unconventional narrative to explore the romantic possibilities determined by its lead character&rsquo;s success or failure in boarding a train. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Helen, a PR officer fired from her job who faces two divergent paths in life. In one universe, she manages to catch a train home and finds new luck in love. In another, she misses her train and continues to be beset by bad luck. However, it soon becomes clear that all is not as straightforward as it seems. Praised for its complex storytelling and chemistry between its two leads, Sliding Doors is a classic romantic comedy that hits all the right notes.

<p>Release Date    August 18, 2006     Director    Neil Burger     Cast    Edward Norton , Paul Giamatti , Jessica Biel , Rufus Sewell , Eddie Marsan , Jake Wood     Runtime    109 Minutes</p>
<p>Due to its subject, The Illusionist has drawn a lot of comparisons with Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s The Prestige, which was released the same year. However, while Nolan&rsquo;s movie is a complex and intellectual puzzle box, The Illusionist has a much more romantic sensibility. Following Nolan&rsquo;s Eisenheim and his ill-fated love affair with a woman deemed far above his social standing. Both a gripping mystery and heartfelt romance, The Illusionist was unfairly overlooked by many on release and remains one of the best romance movies on Peacock.

Megamind (2010)</p>
<p>Megamind</p>
<p>Release Date    November 11, 2010     Director    Tom McGrath     Cast    Will Ferrell , Ben Stiller , Brad Pitt , Jonah Hill     Runtime    96minutes</p>
<p>2010&rsquo;s Megamind isn&rsquo;t the most widely known Dreamworks movie, but it has an incredibly loyal fanbase both thanks to the many memes it&rsquo;s spawned and Will Ferrel&rsquo;s performance as the titular villain. Megamind is an animated superhero-movie spoof aimed at young audiences, though it never leans too far into its parody elements.
Instead, Megamind is a hilarious and incredibly solid story about a supervillain who suffers an existential crisis after defeating his nemesis (Metro Man, played by Brad Pitt), once and for all. Ferell and Pitt are joined by Jonah Hill, Ben Stiller, David Cross, and Tina Fey, with Tom McGrath&rsquo;s direction ensuring that Megamind is currently one of the funniest family movies available to stream on Peacock.
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Shrek</p>
<p>Release Date    May 18, 2001     Director    Vicky Jenson , Andrew Adamson     Cast    Cameron Diaz , Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , John Lithgow     Runtime    90 minutes</p>
<p>For a film that was famously a punishment project for animators (via New York Post), Shrek somehow manages to both lampoon and honor its fairytale source material. The movie, much like the rest of the Shrek franchise, follows the titular ogre (Mike Myers) as he sets out on a quest to rescue the cursed and imprisoned Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) for the tyrannical Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).
While there are a lot of great non-Disney fairytale adaptations, Shrek has managed to stand out by mocking their most frustrating tropes and rejecting the idea that goodness and beauty must be connected. Other than being one of the best movies on Peacock, Shrek also has the distinction of winning the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

The Harry Potter Franchise (2001-2011)</p>

<p>One of the most culturally significant series ever released, the Harry Potter saga remains a defining story for multiple generations. Following the adventures of an orphaned boy wizard and his friends as they battle against the dangerous dark lord Voldemort, the films are a broadly faithful retelling of J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s seminal novels. Spanning over a decade, the eight films represent an ambitious feat of contiguous storytelling, maintaining an impressive cast across almost all the entries. As popular today as it was when first released, the Harry Potter franchise is a hugely immersive and enjoyable journey.

Nope (2022)</p>
<p>Nope<br>
Written and directed by Jordan Peele, Nope follows the owners of a family-run Hollywood horse ranch whose lives are changed by extraterrestrial phenomena. Siblings Otis (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald (Keke Palmer) scramble to understand events that seem to defy all explanation, even as their neighbor (Steven Yeun) tries to turn the strange occurrences into a alien tourist attraction.</p>
<p>Release Date    July 22, 2022     Director    Jordan Peele     Cast    Steven Yeun , Michael Wincott , Daniel Kaluuya , Brandon Perea , Keke Palmer , Barbie Ferreira     Runtime    131 minutes</p>
<p>Jordan Peele has established himself as one of the most prominent directors in the horror genre, and 2022&rsquo;s Nope is now available on Peacock so subscribers can find out why. Starring Daniel Kaluuya, who previously worked with Peele in 2017&rsquo;s Get Out, Nope flips the classic alien invasion sci-fi premise on its head to create one of the most terrifying movies of the last five years. Kaluuya is joined in the cast by Keke Palmer and The Walking Dead star Steven Yuen. The American Film Institute named Nope as one of their films of the year for 2022.
The Black Phone (2022)</p>
<p>The Black Phone</p>
<p>Release Date    June 24, 2022     Director    Scott Derrickson     Cast    Ethan Hawke , Mason Thames , Brady Hepner , James Ransone , Jordan Isaiah White , Jeremy Davies , Jacob Moran , Madeleine McGraw     Runtime    102 minutes</p>
<p>Ethan Hawke almost turned down the role of The Grabber in The Black Phone, as he didn&rsquo;t want to play a villain, so it&rsquo;s a good thing the script was so strong, as Hawke changed his mind and delivered one of the most terrifying movie killers in recent horror movie history. The movie centers on Finney (Mason Thames), a bullied teen who is kidnapped by the Grabber but can get help from his captor&rsquo;s past victims via the use of a supernatural phone.
Along with Hawke&rsquo;s chilling performance, the movie builds its terror with atmosphere and doesn&rsquo;t rely on jump scares. Horror fans among Peacock subscribers will want to dial into The Black Phone​​​​​​, as it&rsquo;s one of the most chilling released in the last decade.

They/Them (2022)</p>
<p>They/Them</p>
<p>Release Date    August 5, 2022     Director    John Logan     Cast    Monique Kim , Carrie Preston , Anna Lore , Cooper Koch , Kevin Bacon , Austin Crute , Quei Tann , Anna Chlumsky , Darwin del Fabro , Theo Germaine     Runtime    90 minutes</p>
<p>Peacock and Blumhouse Productions come together for They/Them (pronounced &ldquo;they slash them&rdquo;), an unforgettable slasher-horror. It follows a group of LGBTQ+ teens at a conversion camp who find themselves stalked by a masked killer. The slasher genre has a disturbing, problematic history of killing off sexually active and minority characters, so it&rsquo;s refreshing to see a movie like They/Them side with the marginalized leads. The story itself may be by-the-numbers, but They/Them makes a bold statement about who the real monsters are — and it&rsquo;s not the killer in the mask.

Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil (2010)</p>
<p>Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil</p>
<p>Release Date    September 30, 2011     Director    Eli Craig     Cast    Tyler Labine , Katrina Bowden , Alan Tudyk , Chelan Simmons , Jesse Moss     Runtime    89 minutes</p>
<p>Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is far from the scariest horror movie on Peacock, but it sure is one of the funniest — and smartest, as it has a lot to stay about the genre. The titular main character (Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk) are a couple of good-natured hillbilly friends who want to enjoy a simple fishing trip together when a group of teenagers mistakenly perceive them as deranged killers. From there, the misunderstandings and the bodies continue to pile up with hilarious results. By flipping the &ldquo;backwoods hillbilly killer&rdquo; horror trope on its head, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil delivers a lot of laughs — and a surprisingly poignant message.

<p>Ti West directed two of the most critically acclaimed horror movies of 2022 with X and its prequel Pearl. However, he had shown his immense talent 13 years earlier when he directed the cult-favorite horror movie The House of the Devil. The movie is a typical horror tale about a girl at a house in a remote location who finds herself hunted by a Satanic cult. However, while this is a story that has been told before, West delivers it in a style that&rsquo;s both a throwback to 80s horror classic while still maintaining contemporary relevance.

<p>A 21st-century indie classic, Richard Kelly came out swinging with his directorial debut. Donnie Darko is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller that centers around the eponymous teenager (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, upon avoiding a bizarre accident while sleep-walking, begins to see visions of a man in a rabbit costume, who manipulates Donnie into committing a series of increasingly violent acts. The movie gained a cult following, and Donnie Darko&rsquo;s ending and timeline are still being analyzed and debated to this day. Cinephiles looking for films that inspire discussion will get a lot out of Donnie Darko.

The Invisible Man (2020)</p>
<p>The Invisible Man</p>
<p>Release Date    February 28, 2020     Director    Leigh Whannell     Cast    Zara Michaels , Storm Reid , Sam Smith , Oliver Jackson-Cohen , Anthony Brandon Wong , Aldis Hodge , Amali Golden , Harriet Dyer , Bianca Pomponio , Elisabeth Moss , Benedict Hardie     Runtime    124 minutes</p>
<p>Several classic Universal Monster movies were reimagined with varying success in the 2000s, but the best of them is undoubtedly The Invisible Man. Directed by Leigh Whannell (Saw) and produced by Blumhouse, Elisabeth Moss stars as Cecilia, a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. After she escapes from her partner&rsquo;s home and hides out, she learns he took his own life and left her $5 million. However, it soon transpires that he hasn&rsquo;t died at all, and has instead created a way to turn invisible and torment her once more. The movie made $144 million on a $7 million budget (via Box Office Mojo) and was universally acclaimed, winning multiple year-end awards.

<p>All Invisible Man Movies, Ranked Worst To Best
There are many Invisible Man adaptations that expand on the classic character, but here’s a ranking of how they all stack up against one another.</p>
<p>Train To Busan (2016)</p>
<p>Train to Busan</p>
<p>Release Date    July 1, 2016     Director    Yeon Sang-ho     Cast    Gong Yoo     Runtime    118minutes</p>
<p>While zombie movies had started to fall out of favor by 2016, the South Korean horror movie Train to Busan brought something new to the oversaturated genre, revitalizing interest in the walking dead. What helped this movie achieve success was the focus on a father and his daughter at the outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, and their fight for survival together, as well as the movie&rsquo;s innovative setting of a speeding train. The movie won several awards and received almost universal acclaim after its release. It also spawned a franchise, with an animated prequel, a standalone sequel, and an American remake in development.

Night Of The Living Dead (1968)</p>
<p>Night of the Living Dead</p>
<p>Release Date    October 4, 1968     Director    George A. Romero     Cast    Judith O&rsquo;Dea , Kyra Schon , Duane Jones , Marilyn Eastman , Karl Hardman     Runtime    96 minutes</p>
<p>George Romero changed everything about the zombie genre with his 1968 movie Night of the Living Dead. Before this seminal hit, the zombie genre was mostly rooted in misunderstood Haitian voodoo rituals. However, Romero created a new lore of the dead rising from their graves and feeding on the living with this movie, at a stroke creating the modern zombie genre. The movie was also groundbreaking for bringing a Black hero to the lead in a horror movie. Sadly for Romero, he failed in his copyrighting of the movie, immediately bringing it into the public domain following release.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)</p>
<p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</p>
<p>Release Date    October 11, 1974     Director    Tobe Hooper     Cast    Marilyn Burns , Edwin Neal , Jim Siedow , Gunnar Hansen , Paul A. Partain     Runtime    83 minutes</p>
<p>One of the most iconic and unsettling horror movies ever made, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a raw and terrifying peek behind the mask of madness. Filmed on a shoestring, the film takes typical slasher tropes like traveling teenagers, isolated houses, and a power tool-wielding villain to new extremes, pushing boundaries like few films before or since. The heat of the overbearing Texas sun emanates through the screen, contributing to the film&rsquo;s tense and suffocating atmosphere. Gunnar Hansen&rsquo;s Leatherface is one of the scariest antagonists ever conceived, and the movie&rsquo;s central story of a family of cannibals hunting innocent passersby remains truly terrifying nearly five decades after release.

Freaky (2020)</p>
<p>Freaky</p>
<p>Release Date    November 13, 2020     Cast    Misha Osherovich , Vince Vaughn , Celeste O&rsquo;Connor , Kathryn Newton , Uriah Shelton , Dana Drori , Alan Ruck , Katie Finneran     Runtime    101 minutes</p>
<p>The 2020 body-swap movie Freaky is one of the best horrors available to stream on Peacock right now. Directed by Christopher Landon, the creative mind behind Happy Death Day, Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton star in Freaky as a serial killer and his would-be victim. However, just as Newton&rsquo;s Millie is about to be killed by Vaughn&rsquo;s deranged Blissfield Butcher, the two switch bodies. What follows is a horror comedy that&rsquo;s just as hilarious as it is gruesome, with Vaughn&rsquo;s performance as a teenage girl trapped in the body of a middle-aged man being especially noteworthy.
American Psycho (2000)</p>
<p>American Psycho</p>
<p>Release Date    April 13, 2000     Director    Mary Harron     Cast    Jared Leto , Reese Witherspoon , Chloe Sevigny , Willem Dafoe , Justin Theroux , Christian Bale     Runtime    101 minutes</p>
<p>Although Bret Easton Ellis&rsquo; original shocking novel was widely considered unfilmable (largely due to its gruesome contents), Mary Harron&rsquo;s American Psycho is an important reminder that some challenges are simply a matter of imagination. Like the book, the movie follows yuppie Patrick Bateman as he juggles his Wall Street banking job with his murderous predilections. Bleakly funny and a damning indictment on consumerism and the superficial nature of the American corporate system, American Psycho might lack some of the novel&rsquo;s shock value, but it is nevertheless a surprisingly successful adaptation and one of the best horror movies on Peacock.
