<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazollo have reportedly split in 2024. However, fans could tell it was going to happen from a mile away.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé couple Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda have reportedly split, and it was a breakup that had been a long time coming. Jasmine, 36, starred in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5 with Gino, 53, when they were going to meet for the first time in person. Jasmine and Gino had been talking online, but Gino was already dreaming of getting engaged to Jasmine and having a baby with her. The Panamanian woman came across as a giant red flag thanks to Jasmine&rsquo;s suspicious nature and gold-digger tendencies. Meanwhile, Gino was manipulating her and was sharing Jasmine’s nudes with an ex to spite them.
Jasmine and Gino’s relationship had its ups and downs in the three years that they were together before her move to America. Jasmine had almost broken up with him on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 after an explosive argument when Gino refused to pay for her expensive apartment. Jasmine even told Gino that she’d cheated on him with her ex and had video evidence to prove it. Still, Jasmine and Gino had got back together ahead of 90 Day Fiancé season 10, in which they’re going to get married, and, most likely, split after the wedding.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  Gino &amp; Jasmine Met On A Sugar Baby/Sugar Daddy Platform
Gino &amp; Jasmine&rsquo;s Meet-Cute Story Was Sketchy</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé couple Gino and Jasmine had never told fans the real platform where they had met during the interviews at the start of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Gino was quizzed by host Shaun Robinson about how they met. She’d asked the couple, “So what site did you and Jasmine meet on?” Gino looked like he wanted to keep the truth a secret from everyone watching, but Jasmine replied, “I don’t like lying.” Gino finally admitted, “All right, so we met on, believe it or not, a sugar baby site.” Jasmine explained that it was her best friend’s idea to create her profile on the site.
Jasmine claimed her friend suggested putting her ad on the website, so Jasmine could date “internationally.” Jasmine claimed she had no idea that her friend had actually put her name on the sugar baby site. She added that she had “no idea” what the website was even about. What’s interesting is that Jasmine was livid at Gino for having paid women to go on dates when she was arguing with him over the DMs she’d received from his ex. “I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not a sugar baby. I prefer to have three, four, five, six, seven jobs,” Jasmine had told Gino back then.</p>
<p>7  Jasmine Expected Gino To Spend On Her Lavishly
Jasmine Likes To Live A Life Of Luxury</p>
<p>It was easy to see that Jasmine and Gino’s 90 Day Fiancé relationship was built on a lie. Even though Jasmine had used the sugar baby website to find Gino and also wanted him to pay her rent and bills, she denied being a sugar baby. She’d called Gino “depressing” and accused him of taking advantage of women who needed money. Jasmine herself had made Gino pay for a $2500 four-day island vacation because she didn’t like the toothbrush he’d given her for Christmas. Jasmine was also very angry when she learned that Gino had quit his job before she came to the U.S.</p>
<p>6  Jasmine Resented Gino For Making Her Lose Her Job
Jasmine Blames Gino For Getting Fired From School</p>
<p>Jasmine expected Gino to give her a life of luxury in America, but with him not having a job, she might not have seen him having a place in the future life she dreamed of. When Gino began his 90 Day Fiancé journey, he’d said Jasmine had quit her job herself, but she later told her Instagram followers that she was fired when the nude photos that Gino had sent his ex somehow reached her employers. Jasmine told her ex-boyfriend Dane that the information was “spread among schools and I was like banned from teaching.” Jasmine filmed a confessional where she said losing her job was a big blow for her.
Jasmine then had to rely on Gino for money more than before. Given that Jasmine was not going to live a frugal life, and Gino was miserly, Jasmine may have missed her old times when she was apparently making $3000 a month from teaching. Jasmine may have always blamed Gino for the sorry state she was in. She had to borrow money from Dane for her butt implants. If Jasmine had a job, she could have paid for the surgery herself and not used her wedding dress allowance given by Gino or taken a loan from her ex.</p>
<p>5  Jasmine Couldn&rsquo;t Stop Thinking About Her Ex-Boyfriend
Jasmine Is Very   To Australian Man Dane</p>
<p>Moreover, Jasmine may have felt guilty about asking Dane for money since she seemed to have pent-up feelings for the Australian man. Jasmine never failed to taunt Gino using Dane’s name during their arguments. She tried to make Gino jealous by telling him Dane was the best man she had ever been with. In a recent episode, Jasmine described her idea of a perfect man and said that Dane was just her type, but she’d started to look beyond physical appearances and hence, had started to value Gino more. However, it was easy to see that Dane was always on Jasmine’s mind, irrespective of her relationship status with Gino.</p>
<p>4  Gino Had A Secret Bachelor Party Without Telling Jasmine
Gino Went To A Strip Club</p>
<p>Being aware of the extreme jealousy Jasmine displayed in the past, Gino started keeping more and more secrets from the Panamanian woman. Gino had already risked it all by telling Jasmine the lip gloss in his car belonged to a coworker, and she’d somehow decided to let it go. However, Gino’s cousin Dana’s wife Michelle told Jasmine about the bachelor party Gino had before Jasmine came to America. Jasmine was feeling guilty about being mad at Gino for the lip gloss, but Jasmine now knew she should have trusted her instincts.
Gino had not only had a boy’s night out with his cousin but had gone to a strip club where he performed indecent acts with the female dancers. Gino tried to dismiss Jasmine when she asked him what he’d done at the strip club. However, the camera doesn’t lie, and Gino was filmed in the act. Jasmine might have watched the clips while filming the season’s Tell All and decided she’d had enough of Gino and his lies.</p>
<p>3  Gino Prioritized His Family Over His Partner&rsquo;s Needs
Jasmine Was Not Gino&rsquo;s Number One</p>
<p>Jasmine wanted to live like a queen while she was waiting for her K-1 visa to be approved and this meant she wanted to keep living in the same fancy apartment complex as her ex. Gino wanted to get Jasmine a cheaper apartment, but she accused him of not prioritizing her in his life when he could have easily afforded the rent. Gino had been supporting Jasmine financially for two and a half years, but Jasmine also wanted to be Gino’s number one priority. Gino said she and his family held equal priority but Jasmine, who wanted to come first, called Gino’s family “trash” and said he was an “idiot.”</p>
<p>2  Gino Could Have Had An Affair Behind Jasmine&rsquo;s Back
Gino Never Explained The Lip Gloss&rsquo; Origins</p>
<p>The lip gloss in 90 Day Fiancé star Gino’s car might have belonged to a co-worker, but Gino never got a chance to explain how it may have reached there. Gino was hanging out with his female coworkers after work and driving them around if his claims were to be believed. However, Gino was likely involved with someone else while Jasmine was yet to arrive in the U.S. Jasmine might have found out the truth behind the lip gloss which she claimed was new, and suggested it was left there by a woman who recently became Gino’s passenger princess.</p>
<p>1  Gino Didn&rsquo;t Support Jasmine&rsquo;s Big American Dream
Gino Is Not Traveling With Jasmine</p>
<p>Jasmine had dreams of moving to Florida after coming to the U.S. because it reminded her of Panama thanks to its warm temperatures. Jasmine wished to start a career as a real estate agent and had no interest in teaching again. However, Jasmine is now busy preparing to launch a vegan protein product for which she attends meetings in New York City. Gino was not accompanying Jasmine, and that could have been a reason behind their supposed split. Jasmine and Gino’s 90 Day Fiancé season 10 storyline could end with them getting married, but the Tell All will reveal the truth about their relationship after the wedding.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
