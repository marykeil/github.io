## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&#39;s Yohan Geronimo expects sympathy from his co-stars after Daniele Gates &#34;defamed&#34; him on a &#34;sanky panky&#34; Facebook page.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Yohan Geronimo is facing the wrath of his fellow cast members after Daniele Gates revealed how he scammed her during the Tell-All. Daniele, 43, and Yohan, 32, had been dating for five months when they got married in the Dominican Republic. Yohan was looking for an American wife who could spend lavishly on him and take him to the U.S. so he could work there and make money. Daniele was looking for love, and Yohan&#39;s good looks and height were a bonus. Daniele planned on retiring from her hectic teaching job in New York City and settling down in the DR with her husband.




However, once Yohan realized he wasn&#39;t going to get money from Daniele, he started looking for other women who could support him. As revealed in a preview clip of The Other Way season 5 Tell-All Part 2, courtesy of ET, Daniele found out about a &#34;sanky panky&#34; page on Facebook. Their fellow cast members are now reacting to the whole situation.


 

She posted a photo of Yohan with a warning to women from Europe, Argentina, and Canada whom Yohan could potentially scam. Daniele felt guilty for being petty about her spur-of-the-moment decision to post it, and Yohan felt Daniele had defamed him by doing it. Shockingly, Daniele revealed that more women reached out to her after the post saying they had been talking to Yohan. &#34;My opinion is [this is]...scamming,&#34; exclaimed Tim Malcolm.

&#34;He&#39;s not only a scammer, but he&#39;s a liar also, like d***,&#34; said Andrei Castravet. Daniele, meanwhile, apologized for her strategy, which was effective but petty. Holly Weeks felt like Daniele did it to reassure herself that she was with the wrong man because Yohan had kept gaslighting her. Daniele agreed with her fellow cast members, saying Yohan was scamming and cheating on her while adding that what Yohan did was also &#34;sociopathic.&#34; She revealed that Yohan was going around telling all these women that he loved them.

Yohan and Daniele got married two years ago in November 2021. What Daniele didn&#39;t know was that Yohan had been sleeping with a woman a month before the wedding. Yohan was in a relationship with the woman who messaged Daniele about it once Yohan split with Daniele. The woman had been giving money to Yohan and his family. She even visited the apartment that Yohan was living in with Daniele. The woman had DM&#39;ed Daniele to find out when she was divorcing Yohan so she could marry him next. She also wanted to move into the same apartment with Yohan. The woman also sent Daniele naughty photos that Yohan had been sending her.

Daniele searched through Yohan&#39;s computer to discover six more women had been in touch with him over the Internet. He had messaged them to ask for money and was sending them his inappropriate content. Daniele confirmed that she was separated from Yohan during the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell-All. Daniele and Yohan are still married legally, so there&#39;s always a chance that she forgives him and goes back to him like she did during The Other Way season 4. Hopefully, Daniele is not wearing her rose-tinted glasses anymore and doesn&#39;t give Yohan yet another chance.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
