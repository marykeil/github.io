  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Despite the fame of Jedi falling to the dark side, there have been surprisingly few that have actually made this transformation in Star Wars canon.
Official Sith greatly outnumber fallen Jedi due to the Rule of Two, but iconic characters like Darth Sidious and Darth Maul make up for the lack of fallen Jedi.
The list of fallen Jedi includes characters like Barriss Offee, Quinlan Vos, and Anakin Skywalker, who famously turned to the dark side and became the infamous Sith Lord, Darth Vader.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The dark side of the Force has been notorious for drawing in some of the franchise&rsquo;s most loyal Jedi. Here is every Jedi who gave in to the dark side.</p>
<p>Although Jedi are usually known for their allegiance to the light and their trust in the Force, one of the most famous Star Wars tropes is the Jedi&rsquo;s fall to the dark side. There have been many Jedi who have fallen over the years, but despite the fame of such a drastic turn, there are surprisingly few that have actually made this transformation in Star Wars canon. Compared to over a hundred canon Jedi, only a handful have given in to the ways of the Sith.
Because of the Rule of Two, it is unsurprising that so many official Sith exist. However, with such great characters embodying the dark side, including Darth Sidious and Darth Maul, it is surprising that there have not been more fallen Jedi added to this Sith-aligned roster. Below is the list of every single Jedi that has fallen to the dark side, including those who eventually managed to pull themselves back to the light side of the Force.</p>
<p>30 Most Powerful Jedi In Star Wars, Officially Ranked Weakest To Strongest
Fans have followed a lot of Jedi through the expansive Star Wars universe but which among them can be considered the strongest?</p>
<p>17  Arath Tarrex
Dooku: Jedi Lost</p>
<p>Appearing solely in the novel Dooku: Jedi Lost, one time initiate Arath Tarrex was a corrupt gambler that often butted heads with Count Dooku during their time at the Jedi Temple. Not only was he passed over for the Initiate Trials, ensuring he had to wait another year for the chance to become a Padawan, but he was eventually exposed by Dooku for his part in causing negotiations to crumble between the Plinovian and Solodo species. He would eventually be taken to the Chamber of Judgement to be tried for his actions.</p>
<p>16  Pong Krell
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</p>
<p>General Pong Krell was an important figure during the Clone Wars, leading armies of clones during the campaign on the planet Umbara. After receiving a vision of both the Jedi and the Republic&rsquo;s bleak future at the hands of the Sith, he sought out Count Dooku. He would eventually become Dooku&rsquo;s apprentice in the ways of the dark side, something that would not be discovered until he took command of and attempted to murder the members of the 501st Legion, operating as their commanding officer on Anakin Skywalker&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>Every Star Wars TV Show Ranked From Worst To Best
The first Star Wars TV show released back in the 1980s - so how do they all compare, from live-action to animation, from Clone Wars to Ahsoka?</p>
<p>15  Radaki
Dooku: Jedi Lost</p>
<p>Originally turning away from the Jedi due to his belief that Jedi should be able to keep in touch with their families and accrue wealth, Radaki, later known as Darth Krall, was a Sith Lord that lived a thousand years before the rise of the Empire, closer to the time of the High Republic Era. He waged war in the Battle of Wasted Years, a battle in which he would eventually win. Darth Krall would eventually appear in visions to the Jedi Knight Keeve Trennis, tormenting her inside the root mind of the Drengir.</p>
<p>14  Quinlan Vos
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</p>
<p>First making an appearance in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode &ldquo;Hunt for Ziro,&rdquo; Quinlan Vos&rsquo; story would be further fleshed out in the novel Star Wars: Dark Disciple. In this novel, he teams up with the former dark side assassin Asajj Ventress, learning the ways of the dark side in the hopes of assassinating Count Dooku under the orders of the Jedi Council. He is eventually captured and manipulated by the Sith.
During this time, the power of the dark side eventually proves to be too alluring and Quinlan becomes an apprentice of Count Dooku. It is only because of his love for Asajj that he manages to bring himself back to the light. Quinlan holds her as she dies in his arms, heeding her plea for him to resist the dark side&rsquo;s pull.

<p>13  Dagan Gera
Jedi: Survivor</p>
<p>A man out of time, Dagan Gera was a High Republic Era Jedi Knight who was preserved in a bacta tank until the early days of the Empire. He was obsessed with the hidden planet Tanalorr, a planet that he believed could become a safe place for the Jedi to learn and train. This obsession eventually led him to the dark side, feeling betrayed by the Jedi who gave up on the planet.</p>
<p>12  Bode Akuna
Jedi: Survivor</p>
<p>Despite being a Padawan at the time of the Great Jedi Purge, Bode Akuna survived and went into hiding as a mercenary. He eventually settled down and started a family with his wife, only for his wife to be killed by Inquisitors and his daughter Kata Akuna to be taken by the Empire. After cutting a deal with the Empire for the safety of his daughter, he became the Chief Supervisor within the Imperial Security Bureau. He was tasked with befriending and eventually betraying Cal Kestis, the Jedi who would end his life.</p>
<p>11  Taron Malicos
Jedi: Fallen Order</p>
<p>Once Order 66 was issued and the clones began to slaughter the Jedi, Taron Malicos escaped to the planet Dathomir. He was captured by the Nightbrothers, and it was during his confinement that he began to fall to the dark side. Taron began manipulating the Nightbrothers, killing them until he eventually became the leader of their clan. Upon meeting Cal Kestis, Taron Malicos attempted to turn him to the dark side of the Force. This resulted in a duel that led to his death, buried beneath the rubble of the Tomb of Kujet at the hands of the Nightsister Merrin.</p>
<p>10  Barriss Offee
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</p>
<p>Learning as a Padawan alongside Ahsoka Tano, Barriss Offee began to slip to the dark side once she started to believe that the Jedi were straying from the ideals they were meant to represent. She was an extremist in this regard, not only becoming the mastermind behind a bombing on the Jedi Temple, but also arranging for Ahsoka Tano to take the blame for it. She was eventually caught by Anakin Skywalker and taken to trial to be judged for her actions.</p>
<p>9  Reva Sevander
Obi-Wan Kenobi</p>
<p>Also known as the Third Sister and a member of the Inquisitorious, Reva Sevander was a child during the time of the Great Jedi Purge. Despite watching Anakin Skywalker slaughter the other Initiates that she grew up with, she joined his side as an Inquisitor, all as a means of one day exacting revenge upon him. After making an attempt on Darth Vader&rsquo;s life, she was left for dead, later attempting to take revenge on his son Luke Skywalker for the evils committed against her. Her inability to do so, and Obi-Wan Kenobi&rsquo;s words, brought her back to the light.</p>
<p>8  Trilla Suduri
Jedi: Fallen Order</p>
<p>Once the Padawan of Jedi Master Cere Junda, Trilla Suduri fell to the dark side and became the Second Sister with Darth Vader&rsquo;s Inquisitorious. She was a fervent member of the Inquisitorious, turning to the dark side after being abandoned by her master in Cere&rsquo;s attempt to save Trilla and the other younglings. They were discovered in the end, subjecting Trilla to the torture that turned her to the dark side. She eventually joined the hunt for Cal Kestis, where she would duel with him several times before being executed by Darth Vader and begging for Cal to avenge the fallen with her final breath.</p>
<p>7  Grand Inquisitor
Obi-Wan Kenobi</p>
<p>Operating as the leader of the Inquisitorious, the Grand Inquisitor was once a Jedi Temple Guard. In his role as an Inquisitor, he was tasked with hunting any Force-sensitive individuals who were left in the galaxy after the Great Jedi Purge. The Grand Inquisitor would lead the others in this hunt, either convincing these Force-sensitive people to join the Empire or killing them if they would not comply. He would eventually die in battle against Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, only for Darth Vader to hold his spirit hostage on the planet Tempes.</p>
<p>6  The Inquisitorious
Star Wars Rebels</p>
<p>There are many remaining members of the Inquisitorious, most of whom have backstories shrouded in mystery. Characters such as Marrok or the unnamed Inquisitor from Tales of the Jedi have very little known about them at all, while others such as the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister serve mostly as roadblocks for series protagonists. Even more have been solely relegated to comic appearances, existing only in the Star Wars: Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith comic series.</p>
<p>Star Wars: All 14 Inquisitors In Canon Explained
Star Wars&rsquo; Inquisitors were Darth Vader&rsquo;s elite death squad of Jedi-killing dark side users. Who were these Imperial agents and what were their fates?</p>
<p>5  Asajj Ventress
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</p>
<p>Not a traditional Jedi by any means, Asajj Ventress was born to a clan of Nightsisters and saved by Jedi Knight Ky Narek after being stolen away by pirates. She was then raised by him in the Jedi Order, but fell to the dark side once he was killed and quickly sought revenge for his death. Asajj then became one of Count Dooku&rsquo;s many apprentices before being tossed aside and left to die during the Battle of Sullust. She would eventually turn away from the dark side and take up a life of bounty hunting, before aiding Quinlan Vos with his attempt on Count Dooku&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>4  Ben Solo
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</p>
<p>Born to Leia Organa and Han Solo after the fall of the Empire, Ben Solo was targeted by the phantom of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious in much the same way that his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker, had been targeted so many years before. He was trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force, but when Luke saw the darkness growing within him, he attempted to end Ben&rsquo;s life. This incident caused Ben to destroy the temple and kill the other students that were under Luke&rsquo;s care. He took up the name Kylo Ren, serving the First Order under Darth Sidious&rsquo; control.</p>
<p>3  Baylan Skoll
Ahsoka</p>
<p>Though little is known about his past with the Jedi Order, Baylan Skoll was once a general in the Clone Wars. He was well enough acquainted with Anakin Skywalker to learn of his apprentice Ahsoka Tano, and eventually escaped the Great Jedi Purge and became a mercenary. Though Baylan never became a true Sith, he did lose his faith after the Jedi Order was destroyed and was willing to work with Morgan Elsbeth and Grand Admiral Thrawn, believing that their cruel methods would eventually bring about a better galaxy.</p>
<p>2  Count Dooku
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones</p>
<p>Trained in the ways of the Jedi by Master Yoda, Dooku willingly left the Jedi Order after his political idealism began to pave the way for doubt in both the Galactic Senate and the Jedi Order itself. After reclaiming his title of Count of Serenno, he was taken by Darth Sidious as an apprentice, dubbed Darth Tyrannus as a Dark Lord of the Sith. He would lead the Separatist Droid Army and help to bring about the Clone Wars, and in death, he was used as a pawn by Darth Sidious to lure Anakin Skywalker to the dark side.</p>
<p>1  Anakin Skywalker
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith</p>
<p>Anakin Skywalker is perhaps the most famous example in the entire Star Wars franchise of a Jedi succumbing to the ways of the Sith. Once considered the Chosen One that would lead the Force to balance, he eventually became the man who would single-handedly dismantle the Jedi Order. After slaughtering countless Jedi, his transformation was completed after his battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi left him permanently disfigured, causing him to don Star Wars&rsquo; infamous black suit of the Sith Lord, Darth Vader.</p>
