## Literature Review

The trailer for Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime season 4 episode 2 reveals Dean Norris as Elliot Stabler&#39;s (Christopher Meloni) older brother Randall.




Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime has offered its first look at Stabler&#39;s elder brother. Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) is the lead character of the Law &amp; Order spinoff, which kicked off in 2021, a decade after the character ended his 12-season stint on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, where he originated. This season promises to explore the character even further, including the first appearance of Dean Norris as Elliot&#39;s estranged real estate agent brother Randall Stabler.




NBC has now unveiled a new teaser for Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime season 4 episode 2, titled &#34;Deliver Us From Evil.&#34; Check it out below:


 

The teaser includes clips of Sergeant Ayanna Bell (Danielle Moné Truitt) discovering that Stabler has a brother and Randall getting into Stabler&#39;s car, asking, &#34;You glad to see me?&#34; TV Insider also recently spoke to OC star Truitt about the new addition, at which point she teased that audiences will see &#34;if [Stabler&#39;s] brothers collide with his work life.&#34; Read her full quote below:



These first few episodes, [his brothers are] just being introduced. We’ll see as the episodes go on, if the worlds collide, if his brothers collide with his work life. I hope it does. I hope we get to play with them as well. I’m sure Bell will end up having some kind of conversation with Stabler about the fact that he has brothers. Hopefully it’ll come up and they’ll be able to have that discussion and see what he’s feeling about it.







 How Long Will Randall Stabler Stay on Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime? 
          

Elliot Stabler&#39;s siblings have never been a major fixture of the Law &amp; Order universe. However, Organized Crime season 4 seems prepared to change that as it finishes tying up loose threads from the three-part Law &amp; Order crossover finale that aired in 2023. In addition to featuring Norris as Randall, the show is already preparing to bring on Michael Trotter as his and Elliot&#39;s youngest brother Joe Stabler Jr.



Organized Crime season 4 was delayed by several months and will feature a shortened 13-episode order following the dual 2023 Hollywood strikes.




It remains to be seen how many episodes will feature one or both brothers, and how long either will remain on the show. However, it seems that they will both likely recur over multiple episodes this season. Organized Crime has taken a different tack from the usual Law &amp; Order format, favoring serialized ongoing storylines over episodic cases, so this intrusion of Stabler&#39;s personal life will likely lead to a major arc that at least lasts through the end of the season.




It&#39;s possible that Randall could stick around for further seasons of Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime too, especially considering Dean Norris&#39; penchant for long-running television roles. ​​​​​​​In addition to being a major part of the Breaking Bad cast for 61 episodes, he starred in 35 episodes of United States of Al, 40 episodes of Claws, 39 episodes of Under the Dome, and more. If asked, it seems possible that he would keep reprising his new role in future seasons, especially if Randall becomes a much more important fixture in Elliot&#39;s life over the course of this season.
