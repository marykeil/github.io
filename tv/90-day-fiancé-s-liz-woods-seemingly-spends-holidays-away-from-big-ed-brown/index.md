## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Liz Woods is seemingly enjoying her single life after a possible split with Big Ed Brown, who she reportedly married in August.




90 Day: The Last Resort star Liz Woods has not been with her alleged husband Big Ed Brown over the holidays. Liz, 30, and Big Ed, 58, have a 28-year age gap between them. They met while Liz was working at a restaurant in San Diego called Encontro, where Big Ed was a regular visitor. Big Ed asked Liz out, and she said yes, which caused a lot of confusion. Liz chose to get engaged to Big Ed, despite him treating her poorly. It was not surprising to find out that Big Ed and Liz have broken up 13 times since they began dating.




90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 was able to help them sort through their differences, but it appears Liz and Big Ed could be having issues again, as they were not seen together during the holidays (as shared by Redditor Shinygemz).


 

Liz and Big Ed had moved to Arkansas before their supposed wedding in August 2023. There were reports of them buying a house together, and their wedding seemingly took place in the Holland Barn Venue in Bentonville, Arkansas. However, Liz&#39;s current Instagram Stories reveal that she&#39;s currently back in San Diego. Liz shared photos showing her spending time with her daughter Ryleigh at Whaley House and later attending a baby shower with her family at San Diego Brewing Co.

Big Ed may have wanted things to work out with his new partner, but Liz’s new Instagram Stories and posts show all the signs that she and Big Ed have split up. She’s been having not-so-secret date nights with a man who’s not Big Ed. The man’s hands don’t resemble Big Ed’s hands at all, even if Liz does crop his face out. She’s been having cocktails with the man and going on art dates, while also consciously avoiding posting anything about her supposed husband. It seems Liz might have finally exited the toxic relationship.

Liz also looks much different now, with a healthier physique and a smile on her face in the pictures. Meanwhile, Big Ed has been spending time with his friends. Lately, he’s been posting photos of himself holding another woman’s arms. However, Big Ed has claimed that he and Liz are still together, but he could be afraid to tell the truth for now because he’s been bound by contracts.




Big Ed and Liz are supposed to star in the upcoming 90 Day Diaries season 5. It could answer all questions fans have about their possible split, but Big Ed has also hinted at his appearance in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 8. Big Ed, despite the criticism he gets, has become an essential part of the franchise and won&#39;t part ways with the show despite his splits and breakups. Even if Liz might no longer be in his life, Big Ed could return with a new, younger partner to date who will eventually appear in a future season of 90 Day: The Last Resort with the San Diego man.



90 Day Diaries season 5 premieres Monday, January 8, 2024, at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
