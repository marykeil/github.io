## Literature Review
CBS releases a new Young Sheldon season 7 teaser, and it hypes up an odd pairing, which may be a big indication of what&#39;s to come in its final year.




The latest Young Sheldon season 7 teaser hypes up an odd pairing for the show&#39;s final year. Sheldon&#39;s time in Texas is coming to an end, forcing Young Sheldon to also wrap up despite its current popularity. As CBS gears up for its premier comedy to return on the air after an extended hiatus due to the dual Hollywood strikes, it&#39;s also slowly rolling out marketing materials to drive up interest in Young Sheldon, especially in light of its recent surge on Netflix.




Whether the shortened Young Sheldon season 7 can deliver a satisfying finale is still uncertain, but a new teaser for the series suggests that it will focus on an odd pairing in its final episodes. Check out the clip (via @TuSubMedia) below:


 

The clip doesn&#39;t give any narrative specifics. Instead, it highlights the pairing of Sheldon and Dr. Linkletter, and although they have paired up for educational purposes before, it&#39;s peculiar that there may be an increased focus on them in Young Sheldon season 7.


 Young Sheldon Season 7 Needs To Fix Sheldon 
          

Coming into Young Sheldon season 7, there are already multiple ongoing plotlines that need to be resolved for a satisfying finale. George and Mandy&#39;s romance, Missy&#39;s redemption arc, and George&#39;s potential death are among those narratives. That being said, since the writers insist on sticking with the prequel&#39;s original premise, its priority needs to be making sure that Sheldon is back at the center of its storytelling. For the past few seasons, Young Sheldon has struggled to make Sheldon relevant, with the rest of his family having more compelling arcs.






Young Sheldon season 7 will only have 14 episodes compared to its usual 22.




Since Young Sheldon season 7 will coincide with Sheldon&#39;s final year at East Texas Tech, it&#39;s safe to say that he will continue to spend time with Dr. Linkletter. However, it&#39;s more important to highlight Sheldon&#39;s relationship with Dr. Sturgis â€” his real mentor and the first educator who inspired him to pursue theoretical physics. Considering how vital Dr. Sturgis&#39; impact on Sheldon will be, per The Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon needs to ensure that he gets his due, especially since the main series largely ignored him.

                  New Big Bang Theory Spinoff Will Break A Record That Young Sheldon Continued For 5 Years   Chuck Lorre&#39;s next The Big Bang Theory spinoff is expected to break a record that Young Sheldon continued when the nerd-centric sitcom ended in 2019.    




Whether Young Sheldon will be able to fix Sheldon&#39;s arc remains to be seen. Within the spinoff, here are other more interesting lingering storylines that also need to be resolved. Regardless, however, it&#39;s safe to say that the prequel will transition him into the life he will live in Pasadena, California, where he will live until the events of The Big Bang Theory.
