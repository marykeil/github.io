## Literature Review
The upcoming Star Wars show The Acolyte will take the franchise into the grand High Republic era, but what mysteries await in the Jedi’s golden age?




Star Wars: The Acolyte is one of the most intriguing Lucasfilm TV projects on the horizon. As the Disney&#43; platform is increasingly being used to explore new stories taking place in the franchise, The Acolyte will go further back in the timeline than any other live-action Star Wars project. The series will center on the rise of the Sith powers in the galaxy in the waning days of Star Wars&#39; High Republic era. With showrunner Leslye Heyland (Russian Doll) at the helm and a cast that includes Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae and Dafne Keen, The Acolyte is shaping up to be the most exciting upcoming Star Wars TV show.




The Acolyte was originally announced in 2020 alongside continuations of Lucasfilm&#39;s TV world like Ahsoka. However, it became clear that The Acolyte would stand apart from other Star Wars Disney&#43; series&#39; as, instead of focusing on heroes Obi-Wan Kenobi and Din Djarin, it would focus on the rise of the Sith. The Acolyte&#39;s cast of characters will tell a story that explores a point in the Star Wars timeline centuries before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. From the announcements at Star Wars Celebration 2023 to the fact that the show finished shooting in June of that year, plenty of news has been revealed about The Acolyte.


 The Acolyte: Latest News 
The Acolyte has had a wealth of news revealed throughout 2022 and 2023.
          

With filming now having wrapped for The Acolyte Disney&#43; series, there have been several interesting reveals that shed new light on some aspects of the series. Unfortunately, The Acolyte also gained attention in 2023 due to a legal dispute. Former The Acolyte producer Karyn McCarthy is taking Lucasfilm to court over a contractual debate (via THR). While this largely did not impact production on The Acolyte, it is still not a positive development for Lucasfilm or Star Wars.




Aside from this drawback, set photos from filming have shown several of the main cast members. The behind-the-scenes images, released in December 2022, give a feel for The Acolyte&#39;s High Republic setting. Despite the Sith featuring heavily in the show, The Acolyte&#39;s set photos mostly reveal what appear to be Jedi characters, such as cast members Lee Jung-jae and Dean-Charles Chapman, in traditional Jedi robes. The photos also give a first look at Dafne Keen&#39;s alien character who appeared to be a warrior, as well as the first Wookie Jedi appearing in the live-action Star Wars universe.

Star Wars Celebration 2023 offered many reveals for those in attendance at Lucasfilm&#39;s Showcase panel. Star Wars&#39; The Acolyte had footage revealed, with Screen Rant breaking down all the reveals. The trailer&#39;s opening scene showed multiple Jedi being trained in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Lee Jung-jae&#39;s character was one of these teachers, as was Carrie Anne Moss&#39;, the latter of whom was training Amandla Stenberg&#39;s Padawan. Some later action sequences showed Sith assassins attempting to kill a group of Jedi. The ending of the trailer showed around 10 Jedi simultaneously igniting their lightsabers with the voice-over “This is about power and who is allowed to use it”.




                  Star Wars: The Acolyte Trailer Description From Celebration: So Many Jedi   Lucasfilm gave attendees at Star Wars Celebration an exclusive look at Leslye Headland&#39;s The Acolyte - here&#39;s a full description of the footage.    



 The Acolyte Release Date 
When will The Acolyte be released on Disney&#43;?
          

With Star Wars: The Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, Star Wars: Visions, and Ahsoka comprising 2023&#39;s Star Wars TV releases, The Acolyte was never expected for a 2023 release date. This was confirmed at Star Wars Celebration 2023 when Kathleen Kennedy confirmed a release of 2024 for the High Republic show. Given filming wrapped in June 2023, the show will likely spend around a year in post-production which fits with Lucasfilm&#39;s most recent announcement about The Acolyte&#39;s release date. In December 2023, Lucasfilm reiterated that The Acolyte - along with Skeleton Crew, Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3, and Tales of the Jedi season 2 - would be released in 2024.





 



 The Acolyte Cast 
Which cast members will appear in The Acolyte as the High Republic&#39;s Jedi Order?
          

The majority of The Acolyte Disney&#43; series cast has been announced with a few recognizable characters in the mix. While certain known characters who could appear - such as Yoda who is alive during the High Republic - would be huge internet-breaking moments, these cameos will likely be kept a surprise. However, there is a solid cast in place with Amandla Stenberg leading The Acolyte in a Star Wars role that was written for her with some other lesser-known character from the High Republic books set to appear.

Lee Jung-jae and Dean-Charles Chapman will play Jedi Knights as proven by The Acolyte&#39;s set photos with Chapman donning the traditional padawan braid in the trailer released at Star Wars Celebration 2023. Dafne Keen&#39;s character is more interesting, confirmed by Keen to be an alien warrior who is part of the Jedi Order. At SWCE 2023, Keen stated she could not say much more which hints at a potentially darker story for the alien Jedi. Other cast members include Jodie Turner-Smith and Manny Jacinto in undisclosed roles alongside Charlie Barnett and Carrie-Anne Moss as Jedi warriors.






Vernestra Rwoh, commonly known as Vern, is a Jedi Knight prodigy and one of the fan-favorite characters from the High Republic&#39;s multimedia stories.




Concerning the aforementioned character who is known from the High Republic books and comics, Rebecca Henderson will portray Vernestra Rwoh. Vernestra Rwoh, commonly known as Vern, is a Jedi Knight prodigy and one of the fan-favorite characters from the High Republic&#39;s multimedia stories. Given Vern&#39;s confirmed appearance at Star Wars Celebration 2023, it could be the case that other book characters appear come The Acolyte&#39;s 2024 release date.

                  Star Wars: The Acolyte Cast &amp; Character Guide   Here&#39;s everything we know about The Acolyte&#39;s cast and the characters they will be portraying in Star Wars&#39; most mysterious project yet.    

In terms of recognizable characters from the movies who could show up in the series, there are not many who would fit the timeline. However, a left-field inclusion could be Palpatine as the series will reportedly touch on how a Sith infiltrated the senate (although it would need to explain how he&#39;s able to use The Force to prevent his aging and would require rewriting the Star Wars canon considerably). More likely, The Acolyte could introduce Darth Plagueis, Palpatine&#39;s master, for the first time in a live-action Star Wars project. Plagueis’ age lines up more with The Acolyte’s setting and would be a surprising yet exciting inclusion.




Concerning the characters more inclined toward the light side of the Force, there are a few Jedi Masters who could appear in The Acolyte. The first is Yoda, who still served as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order during the time of the High Republic. Similarly, three other Jedi who appeared in The Phantom Menace were around during the High Republic: Yaddle, Yarael Poof, and Oppo Rancisis. All four of these characters could appear in The Acolyte given their journey across the Star Wars timeline.



 The Acolyte Story Details 
The Acoylte&#39;s story will be set during a vital, consequential part of Star Wars&#39; High Republic timeline.
          

Concerning the show&#39;s story, The Acolyte will be during the end of the High Republic era, two centuries before The Phantom Menace. It has been described as a mystery thriller that will focus on a Jedi and their Padawan student as they investigate shadowy secrets and emerging dark-side powers. The Acolyte is also said to be drawing on the video games and novels of the franchise, allowing the expanded Star Wars universe to influence the storytelling. Interestingly, Leslye Headland also specifically pointed to The Phantom Menace as an influence as well as dubbing the series an intriguing hybrid of Frozen and Kill Bill.




While the Jedi will be featured in the series heavily as the heroes, the series will also be told from the Sith perspective, thus offering an interesting new insight into the villains of the Star Wars universe. The Sith have largely been viewed simply as the embodiment of evil in the franchise yet this series will examine them as the underdogs looking to infiltrate the Jedi. 2022&#39;s Tales of the Jedi focused several episodes on Count Dooku and his fall into the dark side. This offered a small glimpse into the reality of the Sith and other dark force users, with The Acolyte set to expand this into live-action.



 The Acolyte&#39;s High Republic Era Explained 
What is the High Republic era and why is it so exciting?
         

The High Republic era was the height of power for the Galactic Republic and an intriguing setting for The Acolyte Disney&#43; series. The Jedi were much more active during this time than at the end of the Jedi Order seen in the prequel trilogy. The galaxy was not settled and people were still exploring and expanding into the dangerous Outer Rim. The backdrop of this series will be vastly different from the movies. The whereabouts and actions of the Sith are as yet unknown in the High Republic era, although they are likely to be lurking in the background of The Acolyte’s mysteries.




The novels and comics focus on different enemies, such as the High Republic&#39;s greatest villains the Nihil - Outer Rim marauders who became a major threat to the Republic. The Acolyte&#39;s promised return to prosperity via the High Republic will be a drastic change from how fans have previously seen the Jedi and their allies and enemies. This shift to the golden age of the Jedi could redefine the Jedi and the Force from the version moviegoers know. A High Republic series will be unlike any movie or series that came before it, meaning The Acolyte will bring fresh stories and perspectives to a galaxy far, far away.
