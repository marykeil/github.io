## Literature Review
Sister Wives cast member Christine Brown teases the first interaction her new husband, David Woolley, had with her ex-husband, Kody Brown.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown shared that her new husband David Woolley’s first meeting with Kody Brown was unexpectedly hilarious. Throughout the run of Sister Wives season 18, viewers have gotten the chance to see Christine independent of Kody, living her life as a single woman. Though she’s spoken about dating, things kicked into high gear after Sister Wives season 18 finished filming. Christine was initially using a matchmaker to try and meet someone but met David online in late 2022 and quickly made a connection. After a whirlwind romance, Christine and David decided to get married in October 2023, with their families in tow.




In a recent interview with ET, Christine shared that David has met Kody several times, but their first meeting was the most interesting. “You’ll see it in the One-on-One, it’s hilarious. I’ll let you watch the One-on-One for that one ’cause then you’ll see how Kody feels,” Christine shared, continuing, “David’s always a gentleman. He’s always going to be kind and good.” While Christine isn’t sure how Kody felt about meeting David, she shared that the pair will “be kind in each other’s presence.” While Kody may not be happy about Christine moving on, he’s been respectful, according to her.

 Christine &amp; Kody Brown&#39;s Sister Wives Relationship Explained 
          




Christine and Kody’s relationship has been tumultuous throughout the run of Sister Wives, and even before the show began. After meeting when Christine was just 18 years old, she asked Kody if she could join his family in 1993. Kody, who was already married to Meri Brown and Janelle Brown at the time, agreed and married Christine in 1994. Both explained they didn’t have a traditional courtship before getting married, making blending Christine into his family more interesting. After six children and over 20 years together, Christine and Kody’s problems began to boil to the surface.


 

The lack of interest in any marriage that wasn’t to Robyn Brown began to come into focus after Kody married Robyn in 2014. Whether it was abandoning his schedule for seeing all of his wives during the week, telling Christine he was no longer physically attracted to her, or the abandonment issues that came from Kody’s courtship with Robyn interfering with Christine’s pregnancy, there was a litany of problems surrounding the couple. When Christine tried to speak to Kody about their issues or suggested counseling, he didn’t seem receptive. She chose to leave Kody in 2021, moving from Arizona to Utah in the months after.




Christine’s marriage to David, albeit fast, seems to have a far more solid foundation than her marriage to Kody. As an adult who’s been in a relationship for over 20 years, Christine knows what she wants out of life moving forward. Her relationship with David has been a breath of fresh air for Christine, who has been waiting to find a safe place to land. While her husband, David, respects her past relationship and shows his respect to Kody when they interact, it’ll be exciting to hear about their first encounters in future episodes of Sister Wives.

Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
