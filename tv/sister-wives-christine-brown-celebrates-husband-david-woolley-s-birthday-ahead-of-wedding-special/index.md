## Literature Review
Christine Brown is madly in love with her new husband, David Woolley. She celebrates his birthday by posting special moments with him on social media.




Christine Brown celebrated David Woolley’s birthday a few weeks before her Sister Wives wedding special airs. The 51-year-old Utah native was in a one-sided relationship with her former husband, Kody Brown. She cared for him but couldn’t stay with him because he didn’t reciprocate. In 2021, Christine left Kody and started dating new men. Soon, she found David, whom she dated and married within a year. The mom of six celebrated her big wedding in October 2023, surrounded by all the people she loves, including Sister Wives season 18 star Janelle Brown.




Recently, Christine took to Instagram to share some loving words for her new husband. She said, “Happy birthday David, husband of mine. I love you!” Christine posted photos of the special moments she shared with her beau in recent months. One such picture showed her hugging him passionately, while another featured them relishing family time with relatives.


 

Christine also wrote that 2023 had been an “incredible year” for her. She claimed, “I’m so excited for all our wonderful memories we will be making together. You’ve blessed my life!”


 What To Expect From Christine &amp; David&#39;s Wedding Special 
          




Since Christine has been one of the lead stars of Sister Wives, TLC has given her two special episodes to showcase her wedding day. The episodes will likely feature the complete story of Christine and David’s meet-up and their fairytale wedding. Sister Wives’ wedding special may also focus on Christine’s feelings after her breakup with Kody. She was in a polygamous relationship with the Brown family patriarch for 30 years. Therefore, it’ll be interesting to see how she feels about getting into a new monogamous relationship with David.

It’s heartwarming to see Christine talk so sweetly about her new husband. Over the last three decades, she had struggled greatly in her relationship with Kody. She craved love, attention, and romance, but the Brown family patriarch didn’t give her anything. He only focused on his fourth wife, Robyn Brown, and left the rest of his wives high and dry. Kody would’ve broken up with Christine, Janelle, and Meri since he knew he didn’t love them. However, he stayed with them for his own selfish needs. Thankfully, Christine realized her worth before it was too late.




Christine’s marriage with David isn’t just another relationship but the most significant milestone of her life. She’s finally with the man of her dreams, her soulmate. The future is bright for her and her new husband, as they share a lot in common. They have big families, similar experiences, and so much more to communicate with each other. Christine and David’s forthcoming wedding special is highly anticipated. According to TLC, their wedding will be split into two fun-packed episodes, airing January 7 and 14, 2024.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
