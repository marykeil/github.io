<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Some TV shows have so much hidden meaning, multifaceted characters, and engaging narratives, that they become even better the second time around.</p>
<p>There are plenty of great TV shows out there that become even better the second time viewers watch them. Due to the nature of serialized storytelling and the complex and intricate possibilities of the modern television landscape, there are many shows out there that audiences would do themselves a disservice if they did not rewatch some of them from time to time. While it can be hard to find the time for a rewatch when there are so many new shows to catch up on, there are several that will actually provide a better viewing experience the second time around.
One major reason a show can become even better on rewatch is when it has been expertly crafted by the actors, directors, and writers, and featured so much foreshadowing or hidden details that viewers begin to spot things they did not notice the first time. Other times, the characters in a show are just so well-developed that to go back to the beginning and see how they changed from season to season can be a rewarding experience in and of itself. There are plenty of reasons that TV shows become even better the second time audiences watch them.</p>
<p>10  Dark (2017 – 2020)
Dark had such a complex time-travel story that it can be fully enjoyed with the power of hindsight the second time around</p>
<p>Dark</p>
<p>Release Date   December 1, 2017    Cast   Tamar Pelzig , Louis Hofmann , Moritz Jahn , Stephan Kampwirth , Christian Hutcherson , Karoline Eichhorn , Andreas Pietschmann , Maja Schöne , Deborah Kaufmann , Oliver Masucci , Jordis Triebel , Peter Benedict    Genres   Mystery , Drama , Crime    Seasons   3</p>
<p>The intricate time travel series Dark was a complex and gripping drama that kept viewers on the edge of their seats for the entirety of its three-season run. Featuring multiple timelines and intricately linked character relationships, Dark was a multifaceted journey that rewarded intense attention to detail and did not underestimate the audience’s intelligence when it came to following dense and intricate storytelling. As such, Dark became an even more insightful series with the power of hindsight, as once viewers were aware of the full timeline of the show, they can go back and enjoy the high level of foreshadowing, character development, and hidden details that were easy to miss.</p>
<p>9  Community (2009 -2015)
Community had an attention to detail and self-referential nature that meant there was so much to enjoy the second time around</p>
<p>Community</p>
<p>Release Date   September 17, 2009    Cast   Ken Jeong , Chevy Chase , Joel McHale , Jim Rash , Gillian Jacobs , Alison Brie , Yvette Nicole Brown , Donald Glover , Danny Pudi    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   6</p>
<p>While Dan Harmon’s sitcom Community had a season that was cursed from the start that audiences may want to skip the second time around, it was still a deeply rewarding series to rewatch. Community featured beloved characters, hilarious meta-comedy, and so many Community small details audiences may have missed, such as the Beetlejuice cameo that took three seasons to pay off, that it was well worth spending a few more semesters with the students at Greendale Community College. It was not just the attention to detail but the uniqueness with which Community utilized self-referential humor that made it so great upon rewatch.</p>
<p>8  The Good Place (2016 – 2020)
The Good Place had so much more to notice once all its twists and turns had been revealed the second time around</p>
<p>The Good Place</p>
<p>Release Date   September 19, 2016    Cast   Kristen Bell , William Jackson Harper , Jameela Jamil , D&rsquo;Arcy Carden , Manny Jacinto , Ted Danson    Genres   Comedy , Fantasy    Seasons   4</p>
<p>The Good Place was a sitcom with a twist, all the main characters were dead and living in the afterlife. Telling the story of characters who believe they have entered a Heaven-like utopia, The Good Place became an even better show once the twist that they are in the Bad Place was revealed as part of a unique torture experiment concocted by the demon Michael, played by Ted Danson. The Good Place, especially its first season, had much more to offer on rewatch as audiences could pick up on all the subtle clues towards its big twist, and notice all the ways that The Good Place was not so good after all.</p>
<p>7  Twin Peaks (1990 – 1991 and 2017)
Twin Peaks was chock-full of so much mystery and symbolism it is even better the second time around</p>
<p>Twin Peaks</p>
<p>Release Date   May 23, 1990    Cast   Russ Tamblyn , Sheryl Lee , Kimmy Robertson , Dana Ashbrook , Grace Zabriskie , Everett McGill , Ernie Hudson , Mädchen Amick , Ray Wise , Kyle MacLachlan    Genres   Mystery , Drama , Crime    Seasons   3</p>
<p>The mystery series Twin Peaks was so influential many of today’s biggest shows would not exist without it. In the years after its first two seasons, Twin Peaks developed a cult following who would rewatch and analyze all the surreal detail and dreamlike atmosphere of the series created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. The third season, subtitled The Return, was released 25 years after the second and was especially rewarding on rewatch as audiences were no longer anticipating the reappearance of Special Agent Dale Cooper, who did not return until 16 episodes into the 18-episode season, and can instead enjoy Kyle Maclachlan’s unique performance as Dougie Jones.</p>
<p>6  The Wire (2002 – 2008)
The Wire is a perfectly crafted social commentary that feels so much more layered the second time around</p>
<p>The Wire</p>
<p>Release Date   June 2, 2002    Cast   Lance Reddick , Michael B. Jordan , Idris Elba , Dominic West , Wood Harris    Genres   Drama    Seasons   5</p>
<p>David Simon’s crime drama The Wire was such a dense and layered piece of political and social commentary that there was so much for viewers to enjoy upon rewatch. As an ensemble series with so many moving parts and characters, during the second viewing of The Wire audiences firmly understood the character’s motivations and relationships with one another and could then focus on the incredible writing and attention to detail within the show. With outstanding acting and writing, there were so many scenes in The Wire that are basically perfect that viewers did themselves a disservice if they didn’t rewatch it at least once.</p>
<p>5  Westworld (2016 – 2022)
Westworld had so much detail to pick up on that it became a much more rewarding viewing experience the second time around</p>
<p>Westworld</p>
<p>Release Date   October 2, 2016    Cast   Anthony Hopkins , Evan Rachel Wood , Shannon Woodward , Ed Harris , James Marsden , Jimmi Simpson , Jeffrey Wright , Tessa Thompson , Thandie Newton , Rodrigo Santoro    Genres    Sci-Fi , Thriller , Western    Seasons   4</p>
<p>The epic timeline twist that was revealed at the end of the first season made this an exciting series to rewatch.</p>
<p>The mind-bending dystopian Western series Westworld sent viewers on a wild ride through a technologically advanced amusement park that had plenty to say about artificial intelligence, the darkest consequences of entertainment, and society’s relationship with technology. The epic timeline twist that was revealed at the end of the first season made this an exciting series to rewatch. There were just so many details and hidden Easter eggs to pick on that rewatching Westworld became much better on rewatch as viewers were so long trying to figure out where the story was going, but could instead enjoy how it was being told.</p>
<p>4  The Sopranos (1999 – 2007)
The Sopranos was full of incredibly written three-dimensional characters who can be fully appreciated the second time around</p>
<p>The Sopranos</p>
<p>Release Date   January 10, 1999    Cast   James Gandolfini , Lorraine Bracco , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Dominic Chianese , Steven Van Zandt , Tony Sirico , Robert Iler , Jamie-Lynn Sigler    Genres   Crime , Drama    Seasons   6</p>
<p>The Sopranos was one of the most acclaimed series of all time and stands as a watershed moment for kickstarting the golden age of prestige television. The Sopranos mixed its psychological probing into Italian mobster Tony Soprano, the struggles of balancing family life with leading a crime organization, and evading threats to his life as others hope to take his place as leader of the mob, in a series that was both gripping and hilarious. On rewatch audiences can truly appreciate how great the characters in The Sopranos were and pick up so much more subtext and subtleties than on the initial viewing.</p>
<p>3  Mad Men (2007 – 2015)
Mad Men had such amazing character development that watching them grow and develop is even better the second time around</p>
<p>Mad Men</p>
<p>Release Date   July 19, 2007    Cast   Jon Hamm , Elisabeth Moss , Vincent Kartheiser , January Jones , Christina Hendricks , Bryan Batt , Aaron Staton , Rich Sommer    Genres   Drama    Seasons   7</p>
<p>Mad Men became an even more nuanced study of secrets, stolen identity, and human nature on rewatch.</p>
<p>Mad Men was a compulsively watchable series that expertly showcased the rapidly changing society of the 1960s through the lens of a Madison Avenue advertising agency. As a show full of countless multi-layered characters and boasting incredible attention to detail, Mad Men became an even more nuanced study of secrets, stolen identity, and human nature on rewatch. After having already spent seven seasons with the characters of Mad Men, there was so much to gain by going back to the beginning and rewatching the stories of characters like Don and Betty Draper, Peggy Olsen, and Pete Campbell with the power of hindsight.</p>
<p>2  BoJack Horseman (2014 – 2020)
BoJack Horseman had such a high level of emotional weight that there was still so much to take the second time around</p>
<p>BoJack Horseman</p>
<p>Release Date   August 22, 2014    Cast   Amy Sedaris , Will Arnett , Alison Brie , Aaron Paul , Paul F. Tompkins    Genres   Drama , Animation , Comedy    Seasons   6</p>
<p>BoJack Horseman was a devesting character study that humanized an alcoholic, narcissistic, and troubled talking horse to the point that BoJack became one of the most interesting and nuanced characters on television. Watching BoJack Horseman for the first time was full of hilarious and heartbreaking moments, but on rewatch the psychological character study and emotional depth of the series could truly be appreciated. BoJack’s struggle towards self-acceptance and desire to maintain relevance in a world that’s passing him by, paired with his deeply troubled childhood trauma, meant there was still so much to unpack on rewatch.</p>
<p>1  Better Call Saul (2015 – 2022)
Better Call Saul was no longer living in the shadow of Breaking Bad the second time around</p>
<p>Better Call Saul</p>
<p>Release Date   February 8, 2015    Cast   Bob Odenkirk , Rhea Seehorn , Jonathan Banks , Patrick Fabian , Michael Mando , Giancarlo Esposito    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   6</p>
<p>The Breaking Bad prequel series Better Call Saul just might be better than its predecessor on rewatch. Watching Better Call Saul for the first time, it&rsquo;s normal to always be looking for clues and connections to the person Jimmy McGill becomes in Breaking Bad. However, when rewatching the series with full knowledge of the character arc of Saul Goodman, Better Call Saul can be fully enjoyed for its incredibly strong writing, slow pace with impeccable payoffs, and subtly nuanced character relationships between brothers, partners, and work colleagues.</p>
