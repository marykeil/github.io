## Literature Review
Based on the scattered references to him in Star Wars, it’s no stretch to say that Tarre Vizsla may be the most legendary Mandalorian of all time.




While characters like Boba Fett and Din Djarin may be some of the most iconic Mandalorians in Star Wars, the franchise has yet to really cover Tarre Vizsla, the most legendary Mandalorian in history. What little has been revealed of Tarre mostly comes from reference in some of Star Wars’ animated projects, such as Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and Star Wars Forces of Destiny. Based on the handful of secondhand accounts of Tarre scattered throughout the franchise, much can be gleaned about what kind of person Tarre was, as well as why he is revered across the galaxy.




Tarre Vizsla had the honor of achieving what many who follow Star Wars dream of; he managed to become both Mandalorian and Jedi. Despite both religions often being at odds with one another, Tarre managed to reconcile both halves of his heritage into one whole. He excelled as a Jedi and a Mandalorian with such spirit that he earned the respect of both religions, ultimately turning him into a figure of reverence.

                  Every Star Wars Character That Has Wielded The Darksaber   The Darksaber is a fabled Mandalorian weapon in Star Wars mythology, but the blade has been wielded by a wide variety of different characters.    


 Tarre Vizsla Was The First Mandalorian Jedi, Born Over 1,000 Years Ago 
          

According to Star Wars: Timelines by Kristin Baver, Jason Fry, Cole Horton, Amy Richau, and Clayton Sandell, Tarre Vizsla joined the Jedi Order as a child around 1,050 BBY. He lived and died over a millennium before the Skywalker Saga, and yet his impact on the Star Wars universe has been indelible. Not much else about his childhood has been revealed, but it&#39;s likely that both the Jedi Order and the Mandalorians watched his career with great interest. Being the first ever Mandalorian Jedi, Tarre likely had some lofty expectations to meet, and there may have been many who expected him to fail in marrying his two halves.






 Tarre Vizsla Lived During A Time Of Change For The Galaxy 
          

Given Tarre’s timeline, he actually lived during one of the most crucial times in the Star Wars galaxy. In 1,032 BBY, the Sith Brotherhood was finally defeated by the Jedi Order and the Republic, marking the supposed end of the Sith Empire. Because Tarre was a child in 1,050 BBY, he would likely have been twenty years old during the destruction of the Sith. Furthermore, he grew up as a Jedi during a time of great change, as the Order was wrapping up a millennia-long war against the Sith and ushering in a new era of peace.

It’s not out of the question to say that Tarre Vizsla may actually have fought in the end of the Jedi-Sith War, as he would have either been a Padawan or a Jedi Knight at the time. It’s possible Tarre was influential or even crucial in the destruction of the Sith Empire, earning him the respect of the Jedi Order. In any case, Tarre attained the rank of Jedi Knight within the Order, but then returned to his people some point afterward.






 Tarre Vizsla Did Not Follow The Same Mandalorian Creed As Din Djarin 
          

While Din Djarin and the Children of the Watch practiced the ancient Way of the Mandalore, Tarre Vizsla did not hold to the same Creed. In Forces of Destiny season 2, episode 11, Sabine Wren and Tristan Wren visit an Argonath-esque statue of Tarre Vizsla and liberate it from Imperial control. And while Tarre’s statue wears an ancient Mandalorian helmet, his visage is missing a T-visor, exposing his face.

While unlikely, it is possible that the Way of the Mandalore evolved in the millennium between Tarre and Din, meaning Tarre may have followed an archaic form of the Creed that did not involve hiding one’s face from the world. In other words, Tarre may still have kept his visorless helmet on at all times. Regardless, it’s clear enough that Tarre followed the Mandalorian Creed of his time enough to earn him the respect of almost every Mandalorian. So while he did not follow the same helmet rule as Din Djarin, he was a true Mandalorian nonetheless.






 Tarre Vizsla Forged The Darksaber 
          

          

          

          

          




During his time as a Jedi, Tarre forged the legendary Darksaber. Because he used pure Mandalorian beskar in the design of the Darksaber, it became one of a kind. Unlike traditional lightsabers which glowed with the color of the kyber crystal inside them, the Darksaber was a black blade with white crackling edges. Despite its uniqueness, it was still merely a lightsaber. Nevertheless, as Tarre became more legendary, so too did his blade. As Moff Gideon explains almost one thousand years after the Darksaber’s creation, the Darksaber itself doesn’t have power, but the story surrounding it does.

                  All 7 Darksaber Rules In Star Wars Explained   The Darksaber, the black lightsaber that served as the legendary blade of Mandalorian leadership, has many complex rules surrounding it.    



 Tarre Vizsla United The Clans Of Mandalore 
          




When Fenn Rau explained the history of the Darksaber to Kanan Jarrus in Rebels season 3, episode 15, he detailed how Tarre united the scattered Clans of Mandalore. This likely occurred after Tarre had become a Jedi Knight, seeing as his Darksaber became the symbol of union for Mandalorians for centuries to come. Tarre earned the title of Mand’alor, and led his planet for the remainder of his life.



 The Jedi Honored Tarre Vizsla Too 
          

While it’s obvious that Mandalorians hold Tarre in the utmost respect, few people talk about how the Jedi honored Tarre Vizsla as well. After all, after Tarre passed, the Jedi Order kept his Darksaber in the Jedi Temple. It’s possible they merely wished to study it, or keep it as an important piece of lightsaber history, given how unique it was. But it’s more likely that Tarre’s renown in the Jedi-Sith War earned him a spot in the annals of Jedi history. To this end, the Order kept the Darksaber—likely as a historical decoration in the Temple—in honor of Tarre’s work as a Jedi.




                  Star Wars Cursed The Mandalorians With The Darksaber   Moff Gideon’s destruction of the Darksaber in The Mandalorian season 3 finale was the best thing for Mandalore, and the Mandalorians should thank him.    



 House Vizsla Stole The Darksaber From The Jedi 
          

Despite the Jedi showing Tarre honor by decorating their Tempe with his Darksaber, the Mandalorians felt it wrong to let it sit and collect dust. Pre Vizsla, a descendant of Tarre, explains in The Clone Wars season 2, episode 12 that his ancestors stole the Darksaber from the Jedi Temple long ago. As if it were a battle of who could honor Tarre more, the rest of House Vizsla eventually snuck into the Jedi Temple and stole the Darksaber in what was probably a daring heist.



Jon Favreau both voices Pre Vizsla in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and plays Paz Vizsla in The Mandalorian.







Despite being dead for over one thousand years, Tarre lives on in the memory of Mandalorians to come. Though his statue on Mandalore was obliterated in the Night of a Thousand Tears and his Darksaber destroyed by the hand of Moff Gideon, Bo-Katan Kryze carries on his legacy by leading the united Clans of Mandalore by the end of The Mandalorian season 3. Furthermore, Ragnar Vizsla continues to carry the Vizsla name proudly, and given how Star Wars continues to move backward and forward in its timeline, Tarre Vizsla may one day be covered in live-action or animation.
