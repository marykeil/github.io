## Literature Review

Academy Award-winning Everything Everywhere All At Once revitalized Yeoh&#39;s career by doing one thing Netflix&#39;s The Brothers Sun continues to do.




Netflix&#39;s series The Brothers Sun sees Michelle Yeoh as Eileen &#34;Mama&#34; Sun, and continues a great trend that 2022&#39;s Everything Everywhere All At Once started. The martial arts dark comedy centers around a Taiwanese family living in California, and the danger surrounding the true nature of the family&#39;s criminal history, thus blending traditional martial arts with modern comedic sensibilities in a way rarely seen. In addition to the show&#39;s interesting premise, the positive reception of The Brothers Sun suggests that the new series will continue to grow, thus continuing Yeoh&#39;s recent trend even further.




Everything Everywhere All At Once&#39;s Academy Award wins made an impactful statement that original concepts for movies can still thrive in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Disney-dominated cinematic climate that exists today, but it also suggests that its star might be positioned to repeat a popular trend that the late 1990s and early 2000s saw her do twice before. Additionally, with hints at The Brothers Sun season 2 happening, there&#39;s a strong chance that Yeoh&#39;s best trend will continue to gain momentum in the coming years in both film and TV.

                  The Brothers Sun Ending Explained   Netflix&#39;s martial arts-comedy series The Brothers Sun has a fast-paced ending with multiple plot twists to keep audiences guessing.

While Everything Everywhere All At Once centers more around the dramatic aspects associated with families and includes multiverses as a way to further express its themes, the film&#39;s similarities to The Brothers Sun lie in both projects&#39; effective blend of the complexities associated with traditional family values, and the cultural clash that comes with younger generations butting heads with older generations. In Everything Everywhere All At Once, Yeoh&#39;s Evelyn Wang&#39;s central conflict centered around her trying to keep her family together after the reveal of Joy&#39;s homosexuality threatens to break apart the less understanding members of the Wang family.

In The Brothers Sun, Yeoh&#39;s Eileen &#34;Mama&#34; Sun functions in a similar capacity by withholding the crucial information of the Sun family&#39;s reputation as the most renowned and ruthless Taiwanese triad from her youngest son, Bruce, to provide him with a normal life in California. Once her oldest son, Charles, returns after a failed attempt on the patriarch&#39;s life, Bruce&#39;s life gets uprooted, and Yeoh once again fights tooth and nail to keep her family together. While the premises on display in both projects are similar, their execution and tone differentiate them while still solidifying Yeoh as one of Hollywood&#39;s best actors working today.

Since Yeoh&#39;s Academy Award win for her work in Everything Everywhere All At Once, Yeoh has maintained her momentum by starring in diverse projects, such as Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, A Haunting in Venice, and The Brothers Sun. This renewed interest in Yeoh&#39;s career resembles the similar success seen throughout 1990s Hong Kong cinema after her performance alongside Jackie Chan in Police Story 3: Super Cop, and again in the 2000s after her work as Yu Shu Lien in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. With appearances in Avatar 3 and Avatar 4, Yeoh&#39;s best trend continues courtesy of The Brothers Sun.
