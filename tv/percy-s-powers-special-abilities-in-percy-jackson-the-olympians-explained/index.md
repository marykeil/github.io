Summary

  Percy Jackson has hydrokinetic abilities, allowing him to manipulate water and use it for various purposes.   Along with his control over water, Percy also possesses the power of atmokinesis, enabling him to influence the weather to a limited extent.   Percy&#39;s dreams are potent and allow him to see events from the past, present, and future, as well as communicate with ancient beings and gods.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians follows the journey of the demigod Percy Jackson, who has a range of powers and abilities due to his father being Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. The Disney&#43; show is based on the book series by Rick Riordan, with the Percy Jackson and the Olympians cast starring Walker Scobell as the titular protagonist. At the start of the series, Percy is a troubled 12-year-old boy who learns he is a demigod after he accidentally summons water from a fountain during a class field trip.

Shortly after Percy discovers he&#39;s the son of Poseidon, Zeus accuses him of stealing his Master Bolt for his father, sending Percy on a quest to the Underworld in order to catch the thief who has stolen the weapon to clear his name. While facing off against numerous monsters and Greek mythological species in Percy Jackson season 1, Percy&#39;s powers grow and he discovers the reason for some strange occurrences when he was younger. In addition to being a &#34;forbidden child,&#34; Percy&#39;s special water-related abilities make him one of the most powerful demigods, with his powers in the TV series drawing heavily from the source material.





 Hydrokinesis 
Percy can manipulate water
         

As the offspring of Poseidon, Percy has control over great volumes of water, with the demigod eventually having the ability to lift 10,000 gallons of water. His hydrokinetic abilities allow him to dry himself, create oxygen bubbles for people who cannot breathe underwater, shape water into various forms, and even intensify its tension to create a shield or walk on its surface. By summoning water through the &#34;force of the ocean&#34; within him, Percy can manipulate not only water but also extend his influence to control poisons and other liquids to an extent.

Percy also experiences water empowerment, granting him superhuman clarity, strength, speed, agility, and endurance. This is seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 2 as Percy fights back more effectively against Clarisse when they are near the water and snaps her electric spear with ease. However, this ability only lasts for a limited amount of time unless he is completely submerged in water.




In the book series, Percy also utilizes water for geokinesis, which allows him to alter the surrounding earth, although he does not possess the same earthshaking abilities as his father. Furthermore, Percy has vitakinesis with water, allowing him limited control over the healing process. This ability is also seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 2 when his cuts heal after Annabeth Chase pushes him into the water. Notably, Percy also has water immunity, so he will not be affected by any amount of water pressure, and will not get wet if submerged underwater unless he chooses to be.



 Atmokinesis 
Percy can influence the weather
          

The books reveal that Percy possesses limited control over the weather, enabling him to conjure storms and small hurricanes. However, wielding this power is incredibly draining. While manipulating hurricanes, Percy also has some control over the wind, allowing him to generate powerful gusts. Within these hurricanes, he occasionally generates sparks of lightning, though this ability is not as potent as that of a child of Zeus and is more of a byproduct of his storm-manipulating abilities.






 Dreams 
He can see into others&#39; dreams
          

Like other demigods, Percy experiences dreams that show him events spanning the past, present, and future. Thanks to his mighty father, these visions are more potent than his peers. This is seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 when Percy hears the voice of a man in his nightmares. Percy can also glimpse into the dreams of other demigods, such as Luke and Hercules, and even witness divine visions, including those involving gods like Hades. Additionally, his dreams allow him to see into the minds of ancient beings like Kronos, proving to be an extremely powerful ability.



 Zoolingualism 
Percy is able to communicate with animals
          




Percy has the ability of zoolingualism, allowing him to communicate with his father&#39;s subjects, who he has divine authority over. He can speak normally and telepathically to these subjects, as well as speak to Posideonâ€™s other children underwater. Percy can understand and talk to marine animals, who also treat him with lordly respect as the son of their lord. Additionally, as Percy&#39;s father is Poseidon, the son of horses, he can speak with equestrian creatures as well. He uses this ability to speak with his companion Blackjack, a black Pegasus, whom he meets in the second book, The Sea of Monsters.



 Watercraft Manipulation 
He has an immediate connection with watercrafts
          

Percy has a connection with any ship he boards and can even operate it telekinetically, which is likely to be utilized in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5&#39;s water park scene. He can command a ship&#39;s rigging and sails, release dock ties, weigh the anchor, and unfurl the sails. This unique ability extends to perfect bearings, granting Percy the knowledge of the exact coordinates needed for navigation across the sea. His innate understanding of sailing further enhances his expertise, enabling him to instinctively know which ropes to hoist, sails to raise, and which direction to steer, even gauging the ship&#39;s speed.






 Curse Of Achilles 
This power lasts about a year in the books
          

In the fifth book in the series, The Last Olympian, Percy gains a power and a curse after he bathes in the River Styx. Upon his impending battle with Kronos, Percy takes the Curse of Achilles to help Olympus. This curse gives its bearer near-invulnerability, enhancing their strength, speed, agility, reflexes, endurance, and fighting skills. Additionally, it makes the person less susceptible to fatigue while using immense power. However, the curse&#39;s inherent vulnerability lies in the chosen weak spot, causing immediate death with even the slightest injury to that area. In the books, Percy lives with this curse for almost a year.



 ADHD 
Percy&#39;s attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is based on his battle instincts
         




Percy has ADHD, which is a result of his instinct for self-preservation. While this gets him in trouble with his teachers, as he is unable to sit still in the classroom, it becomes essential during combat. ADHD enhances his battle reflexes, enabling him to stay alert at all times, notice small changes, and let his mind wander to find solutions to problems.



 Dyslexia 
Percy&#39;s mind is hardwired for Ancient Greek, not English
          

Percy has dyslexia, which causes him to struggle in school as he cannot read English as well as his peers. This dyslexia is actually due to his brain&#39;s natural ability to understand Ancient Greek instead of English, which allows him to understand the meaning of Greek names and phrases. His dyslexia is seen in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 1 when Percy looks at his worksheet in the museum, and sees the English words on the page move.






 Superhuman Abilities 
Percy possesses super strength, superhuman reflexes, and superhuman agility
          

Being the son of a god gives Percy natural superhuman abilities. His durability surpasses that of typical humans and even some demigods, as his father is one of the big three. This durability helps him withstand powerful blows. Percy also has superhuman strength, which permits him to knock out other demigods with one hit, and even rip out a Minotaur&#39;s horn. Percy possesses superhuman reflexes, which are shown in the third book, The Titan&#39;s Curse, where he can deflect a bullet that is traveling 1,700 miles per hour. He also has superhuman agility, as evidenced by the moment where he jumps onto the Minotaur&#39;s neck in Percy Jackson and the Olympians.



 Aquatic Breathing 
Percy can breathe underwater
         




As he discovers at the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4, Percy is able to breathe underwater. His mother, Sally Jackson, made him take swim lessons as a child and ensure his comfort in the water, but it wasn&#39;t until he fell from hundreds of feet into the Mississippi River that he learned he could breathe underwater. Encouraged by a Nereid sent by Poseidon, Percy survives by breathing calmly when his foot keeps him trapped underwater. While there isn&#39;t too much more water standing in the way of his quest to the Underworld after this experience, this power will continue to come in handy in Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; future.
