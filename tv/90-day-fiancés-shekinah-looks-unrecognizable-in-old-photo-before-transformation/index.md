## Literature Review
Shekinah Garner looks so different in one of her old &amp; unseen pictures. 90 Day Fiancé fans are stunned to see how much she’s changed over the years.




Social media users are shocked to see how different Shekinah Garner from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way looks in one of her old pictures posted by a social media user. Shekinah recently debuted in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise with her Turkey-based boyfriend, Sarper Güven. Sarper and Shekinah may be two of the good-looking cast members of the season, but their relationship is full of red flags. In 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, Sarper showed his toxic side by discussing Shekinah’s weight and demanded she not weigh over 128 pounds or have a muscular body.




Just like Sarper, Shekinah seems obsessed with her physical appearance. Her throwback pictures show that she has undergone various cosmetic treatments to achieve her current look. A Redditor, Loud_Carpenter8141, recently posted one of Shekinah’s old photos with the title, “Shekinah before the fillers and botched surgeries.”


 

Since Shekinah now has bigger lips, a sharp jawline, and enhanced cheekbones, it was difficult for other Redditors to recognize her in the throwback photo. A Reddit user said, “my brain can’t comprehend that that’s the same person. Like I don’t see it.” Another Redditor commented, “there’s no resemblance at all!”

 Are Shekinah &amp; Sarper Still Together? 
          




Sarper and Shekinah had several arguments in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5. Sarper demanded Shekinah to bear his child and insulted her when she refused to obey his request. He disrespected her by saying it would only take him two days to forget her if she broke up with him and returned to the United States. Despite the toxicity in their relationship, Sarper and Shekinah claim they’re a perfect couple. During the latest 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All, the new franchise pair declared they’re still committed to each other.

Over the years, Shekinah has opted for two facelifts, neck lifts, a brow lift, an upper blepharoplasty, Botox, and lip injections, to enhance her facial features, which is why she looks unrecognizable in her old photo. Social media users aren’t wrong to discuss how much the new reality star has changed in the past few years. Since Shekinah was previously featured on another dating reality TV show, The Millionaire Matchmaker, it seems that she likes being in front of the camera. She probably wants to keep experimenting with her appearance to achieve her perfect version and show off her finest self on national TV.




Shekinah seems to keep trying to enhance her looks due to low self-esteem. It doesn’t help that Sarper also wants her to be under 128 pounds and dress femininely. Besides, it’s also possible that Shekinah keeps trying cosmetic procedures to look her best as an aesthetician. Shekinah probably thinks she needs to undergo different surgeries to come off as an expert aesthetician and lure more clients to her clinic in Los Angeles. Hopefully, the new 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star knows she has always been naturally beautiful.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
