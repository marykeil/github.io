## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Big Ed Brown confirms a long-time rumor about his relationship with Liz Woods as fans suspect the Last Resort couple has split.




90 Day: The Last Resort star Big Ed Brown is revealing his current relationship status with Liz Woods as rumors of their split continue to swirl online. Big Ed, 56, is a former photographer from San Diego who achieved worldwide fame for starring in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4 with Rose Vega. When Rose decided she&#39;d had enough of Big Ed, he began dating another younger single mom named Liz in the U.S. itself. Big Ed and Liz have broken up 13 times since fans first saw them together on 90 Day: The Single Life season 1.




While couples therapy on 90 Day: The Last Resort worked its magic on Big Ed and Liz, and they left the resort ready for their upcoming August 2023 wedding, there were speculations that they never married and split before they married.


 

Big Ed did an Instagram Live (as shared by Monsters&amp;Critics) where he claimed that Liz and he are still together. Big Ed told his followers, &#34;Liz and I are still together, I&#39;m as happy as can be.&#34; Big Ed also told them about his latest career as a real estate agent. He revealed that he was able to close his first house.


 Is Big Ed Lying About Being Together With Liz? 
          




Big Ed suggested his new job might have created issues between him and Liz. He said that he lives with Liz in Northwest Arkansas, before adding that Liz is &#34;always working&#34; so she&#39;s never with him in Arkansas. Moreover, Big Ed confirmed that he got married to Liz as per long-time rumors. He said &#34;We got married here in Arkansas,&#34; which is what a leaked wedding website for the couple had revealed before being mysteriously deleted. Big Ed and Liz decided to move away from San Diego and settle in Arkansas, which was close to where his family lived. They reportedly bought a house together.

However, Liz&#39;s frequent appearances in San Diego have fans thinking she&#39;s back home. Liz was offered a promotion to the position of business partner at the restaurant where she had been working as a waitress manager. Liz had to turn down the offer to move out of the city and to be with Big Ed. She was mocked for making such an unwise decision for a man who refused to treat her well. Meanwhile, Liz has been frequently posting Instagram stories about her date nights with a man who doesn&#39;t look like Big Ed. Big Ed is likely either lying to fans or deciding to tell them bits and pieces of the truth to not give away any storyline spoilers since Big Ed and Liz star in 90 Day Diaries.




The 90 Day Fiancé spin-off will reveal the truth about Big Ed and Liz&#39;s relationship after they left 90 Day: The Last Resort. Viewers can expect to finally get some answers about Big Ed and Liz&#39;s marriage, such as whether they got married and who the mystery man in Liz&#39;s IG updates is. Liz has not been seen wearing a ring on her finger, which also hints at her split with Big Ed. Fans have always wished for Liz to move on from Big Ed and choose happiness. It&#39;s starting to look like Liz finally did what was expected of her, and Big Ed, as expected, is continuing to lie to fans.
