# Rick Grimes  Spinoff Will Struggle To Beat The Walking Dead Daryl Dixon s Greatest Strength


## SUMMARY 



  Bringing back Rick and Michonne creates a lot of excitement for The Ones Who Live, but it may struggle to introduce new, compelling characters like Daryl Dixon did.   Daryl Dixon excelled at introducing meaningful new characters that became crucial to the show&#39;s plot, while The Ones Who Live may focus more on elevating the protagonists rather than developing unique side characters.   The return of Jadis and potential reunions with main characters may overshadow new additions, making it difficult for The Ones Who Live to surpass Daryl Dixon in the character development department.

## Literature Review
The upcoming Rick Grimes spinoff creates plenty to get excited about, but The Ones Who Live will struggle to outperform Daryl Dixon in one key area.




The Ones Who Live will mark Rick Grimes&#39; official return to The Walking Dead franchise and while the spinoff has plenty going for it, it will struggle to beat Daryl Dixon&#39;s strongest attribute. Although he returned briefly in The Walking Dead&#39;s series finale, Andrew Lincoln has been gone from the franchise since November 2018. Rick Grimes&#39; Walking Dead exit came after Andrew Lincoln wanted to leave the show to spend more time with his family. With the main protagonist absent, it forced a big shift, especially as Michonne departed the series the following season. With both making their return, The Ones Who Live creates plenty to look forward to.




Bringing back two crucial characters gives Rick and Michonne&#39;s spinoff a lot of drawing power already. Dead City and Daryl Dixon created anticipation about seeing what was next for some of the franchise&#39;s main characters, but The Ones Who Live will showcase key figures who have been away for years. The show will also feature the CRM, one of the biggest villain groups in the entirety of The Walking Dead. All these advantages give The Ones Who Live a real chance at being the franchise&#39;s best spinoff yet, but there is one factor that it will almost certainly fail at in comparison to Daryl Dixon.


 Daryl Dixon Was Great At Introducing Meaningful New Characters 
          

One of Daryl Dixon&#39;s greatest qualities was its ability to introduce new, meaningful characters. Daryl Dixon received plenty of praise when the show came out, becoming the second Walking Dead spinoff to follow characters from the main show after its finale. The concept of Daryl in France may have sounded strange, but it led to a fresh new story with memorable characters. Laurent and Isabelle were the two biggest introductions, becoming crucial to Daryl&#39;s story. Laurent was the child Daryl was tasked with delivering across France, who was seen as a pivotal part of the new world. Isabelle offered a partial romance story for Daryl Dixon, although their feelings were never fully explored.




Both characters feel pivotal for the future of the franchise. Daryl Dixon also used its side characters well. Sylvie was a constant ally, traveling alongside Laurent and Daryl to offer support. Fallou and Azlan had fewer appearances but also proved valuable to Daryl and the show&#39;s overall plot. Even Quinn became an interesting character, starting as a supposed villain before managing to find redemption in the end. The character work in the show is strong and makes a bunch of new characters feel believable and important. This is where Daryl Dixon thrives compared to the Dead City spinoff and shows the benefits of developing characters outside the protagonists.

                        Rick Grimes&#39; Walking Dead Spinoff Sets Up The Return Of A Season 1 Villain   With Rick Grimes finally set to return to The Walking Dead, his spinoff presents the chance to bring back one of the show&#39;s earliest villains.    



 Why The Ones Who Live Will Struggle With New Characters 
          




Despite all the qualities The Ones Who Live brings to the table, the show will find difficulty making new, compelling characters. Given how long it has been since Rick and Michonne have been in The Walking Dead, the spinoff will almost certainly focus most of the story on the duo. Of course, they will each have supporting characters, but like Dead City, these characters will likely be used to elevate the protagonists rather than be overly unique and interesting in their own right. Focusing on new survivors while not deviating from Rick and Michonne would be tough and something The Ones Who Live will find difficult.

The return of Jadis also suggests she may be the main villain. This once again leaves less spotlight for new characters outside the CRM&#39;s leader. Major General Beale is expected to be in Rick&#39;s spinoff and could become a huge threat, but he may be the one exciting new addition with most other characters being forgettable, much like The Croat in Dead City. The inevitable reunion between Rick and Michonne in The Ones Who Live also sets up further reunions with the franchise&#39;s main characters. This could overshadow potential new additions and prove how difficult it will be for the spinoff to beat Daryl Dixon in this department.
