## Literature Review
Riley Diego split from Violet Tuyet in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. He is seemingly dating a surprising franchise co-star now.




Riley Diego seemingly has a new woman in his life after his split from Violet Tuyet, and it happens to be a 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days cast member. Riley is a 48-year-old man from Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, who starred in Before the 90 Days season 6. Riley had dealt with major heartbreak in his past where one girlfriend had cheated on him and another ghosted him. Riley met Vietnamese woman Violet on a dating app. They began a long-distance relationship, but Riley could never trust Violet. He didn&#39;t even say, &#34;I love you,&#34; to her. Riley and Violet eventually broke up at the end of the season.




However, Riley may have found someone else to say, &#34;I love you,&#34; to. According to Reddit user ExoticSurprise6188&#39;s post, captioned, &#34;Hot off the press,&#34; Riley might be romancing a fellow 90 Day Fiancé cast member.


 

Jamal Menzies was live on Instagram when Riley decided to join him through the comments section. Riley commented, &#34;Hey son,&#34; and Jamal pinned the comment to the top. When Jamal&#39;s Instagram Live was over, Riley commented, &#34;Bye my son&#34; and told Jamal that he would talk to him later. The fan who shared the screenshots added, &#34;It’s been confirmed by others on the live that Kim and Riley are together!&#34; They wished the new couple a lot of luck.

 Kim &amp; Riley&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Rumors Explained 
          

The fan hoped to see Kim Menzies and Riley back on 90 Day Fiancé soon. &#34;They probably bonded over old music and vinyl,&#34; wrote RoadtoBankrupt. Meanwhile, Goodbyecorona2021 added, &#34;Eww that guy is a creep. Then again he is an upgrade from Usman.&#34; 90 Day Fiancé fans have mixed feelings about this supposed new couple in the franchise. Riley and Kim first sparked dating rumors when the duo interacted on a live video call on Instagram. Riley had joined Kim&#39;s Instagram Live in October 2023 to have a flirty conversation.

It appeared that Kim and Riley may have been chatting off-camera. He said that he was going to San Diego to meet Kimberly later that month. A date night had also supposedly been planned. Riley&#39;s father had started referring to Kim as his daughter-in-law. Kim and Riley have both laughed at the rumors. Kim insisted they were just good friends and nothing more. Meanwhile, her ex Usman &#34;Sojaboy&#34; Umar may have found the rumors to be untrue. Kim and Riley happened to really meet in person in early November as they celebrated co-star Tyray Mollett&#39;s birthday together.




Several photos of the couple spending time together were posted online. Kim continued to post laughing emojis on posts about her and Riley. However, now it looks like things are getting serious between Kim and her co-star. 90 Day Fiancé has paired single cast members before. Kim has been gone from TLC ever since her breakup with Usman on Happily Ever After? Perhaps Kim and Riley could be cast in the next season of 90 Day: The Single Life. Riley did not have success on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, but his second chance at a reality TV romance might just be successful.
