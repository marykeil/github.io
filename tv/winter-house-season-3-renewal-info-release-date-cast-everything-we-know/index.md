## Literature Review
Winter House season 3 premiered on Bravo in October 2023. Here&#39;s everything to know about the latest season including release date and cast.




Now that Summer House season 7 is over, Bravo is geared up for Winter House season 3 and all its chilly drama, and last season introduced some new faces and some OGs. The slopes were hardly used, but the drama in the house, thanks to quick-forming relationships, heated up. The new season premiered in October 2023, and here&#39;s everything viewers need to know about the current season.




When Winter House premiered in October 2021, no one knew what to expect from the spinoff. The series merged two of Bravo&#39;s most beloved shows, Summer House and Southern Charm, with faces from both series. When growing up, the mini-mansion was set in Stowe, Vermont, Kyle Cooke&#39;s winter playground. Its premise was the same: have fantastic house parties, enjoy a few local bars, hit the slopes, and stir up major drama. The newest season showcases Amanda Batula and Kyle&#39;s marriage, Sam Feher and Kory Keefer&#39;s budding relationship, and may be missing one seriously activated Lindsay Hubbard.


 Winter House Season 3 News 

 

The big news of Winter House ahead of the premiere was that Kory, dating Jessica Stocker during the last season, started to fall for Summer House newcomer Sam. Winter House season 2 showed Jessica becoming clingy, as gym owner Kory didn&#39;t put up much of a fight. However, the Winter House season 3 teaser posted by Queens of Bravo revealed Amanda&#39;s return and Danielle Olivera&#39;s introduction. The cast was seen playing football out in the snow, with someone launching a pass to Amanda, inevitably hitting her and having a Marcia Brady moment.






 When Was Winter House Season 3 Confirmed? 
          

Not to Bravo viewers&#39; surprise, Winter House season 3 was renewed when the network shared a clip following the final reunion episode of Summer House season 7. It wasn&#39;t an extended teaser, but long enough to show that this season would be packed with fun and games. The currently airing installment was filmed last winter.
