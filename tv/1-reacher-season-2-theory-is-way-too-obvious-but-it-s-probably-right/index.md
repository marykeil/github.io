# 1 Reacher Season 2 Theory Is Way Too Obvious (But It s Probably Right)


## SUMMARY 



Reacher Season 2 puts Jack Reacher at the center of a life-threatening conspiracy targeting his former Army unit.   David O&#39;Donnell, a member of Reacher&#39;s former unit, is a suspicious character with the potential for hidden motives.   Despite evidence pointing towards O&#39;Donnell, it would be a letdown if he turned out to be the main villain, as it would be yet another rehash of a tired action-movie trope.

## Literature Review
With Jack Reacher&#39;s sophomore outing nearing an end, one popular Reacher season 2 fan theory is way too obvious — but it&#39;s also probably right.

Spoilers are ahead for Reacher season 2, episodes 1–5.



With Jack Reacher&#39;s sophomore outing nearing an end, one popular Reacher season 2 fan theory is way too obvious — but it&#39;s also probably right. Based on Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck and Trouble, Reacher season 2 put its titular character at the center of a conspiracy that&#39;s targeting his former hand-picked Army unit. A drifter in his post-military days, Reacher (Alan Ritchson) has been wandering around since the first season&#39;s Margrave, Georgia-set counterfeiting case. When Reacher&#39;s fellow former military police officer Frances Neagley (Maria Sten) sends him a distress code, Jack learns that one of their old pals, Calvin Franz (Luke Bilyk), was murdered.

Tossed out of a helicopter that was flying high above the Catskills, Franz&#39;s death wasn&#39;t an accident. In fact, Neagley and Reacher believe it&#39;s just the first in what will become a series of murders targeting the former members of Reacher&#39;s 110th Special Investigations Unit. Unlike Reacher season 1&#39;s small-town drama, the show&#39;s sophomore outing makes things much more personal by putting Reacher at the center of a life-threatening conspiracy. Plus, season 2 confirms that, unlike his buddies, Jack Reacher is stuck in the past. As Reacher reassembles his old crew, a hard-to-stomach suggestion lingers: the unit might&#39;ve been betrayed by one of their own.



Reacher Season 2&#39;s David O&#39;Donnell Might Be Dirty 
          

In addition to Jack Reacher, who hand-picked his 110th comrades, and Neagley, the fabled special investigations unit featured the late Major Calvin Franz, who idolized Reacher; the often-sarcastic David O&#39;Donnell (Shaun Sipos); Karla Dixon (Serinda Swan), a numbers-loving ex-MP; the music-loving late Tony Swan (Shannon Kook), who later worked for defense contractor New Age; arms specialist Stan Lowrey (Dean McKenzie); and also-murdered buddies Jorge Sanchez (Andres Collantes) and Manuel Orozco (Edsson Morales). Of all these characters (very few of whom are still alive by Reacher season 2, episode 5), O&#39;Donnell stands out — and not in a good way.

David O&#39;Donnell is often the first member of the reassembled 110th to point fingers. In a murder-mystery story, a character who&#39;s quick to blame others often has something to hide. However, viewers have also pointed out other glaring moments from Reacher&#39;s sophomore season that hint at O&#39;Donnell being dirty. For starters, when Reacher first introduces O&#39;Donnell, he&#39;s in Reacher and Neagley&#39;s overturned hotel room, and claims it was ransacked before he arrived. Later, O&#39;Donnell shares that he and his family were having an &#34;unplugged weekend&#34; when Franz was murdered, which seems incredibly convenient. Even the very fact that he locates the rest of the 110th is suspect.



 Evidence Pointing Toward O&#39;Donnell Could Be Purposefully Misleading 
     

There&#39;s no doubt that Reacher season 2 has changed O&#39;Donnell for the better. Instead of making him a Reacher-lite character, O&#39;Donnell is something of a foil for the &#34;Big Guy.&#34; While Jack Reacher can&#39;t let go of his military backstory and has taken to an unsettled, untraceable drifter lifestyle, O&#39;Donnell is married with kids. The ex-MP might dabble in Washington D.C. blackmail, but, otherwise, is shown to be the typical family man Reacher decided to forego becoming. But making O&#39;Donnell a family man is convenient shorthand for making him less suspicious — perhaps too convenient. If O&#39;Donnell was the one behind the murders, it&#39;d feel too obvious.




Aside from the blackmail of it all, O&#39;Donnell could be working for New Age, if only for a steady paycheck. If he&#39;s involved in black-market arms deals, his lucrative-yet-illegal side hustles would certainly foot the bills for his family of five. While it seems like another character from the past is Reacher season 2&#39;s prime suspect, there&#39;s a slim chance that O&#39;Donnell was also involved in the past timeline&#39;s contraband case — or maybe he learned from it. At this point, the clues pointing to O&#39;Donnell could just as easily be sloppy writing or red herrings. He&#39;s changed from the books, but not necessarily for the worse.



 Reacher Season 2&#39;s O&#39;Donnell Being A Villain Would Be A Huge Letdown 
          

There are other oddities in the early episodes of Reacher season 2 that point to O&#39;Donnell being a questionable character. For starters, he gives one of his children the number for his burner phone. More often than not, his dialogue is reminiscent of speaking in code: before the biker gang fights the 110th, O&#39;Donnell says, &#34;hands are for helping not for hurting&#34; — something one Reddit user aptly suggests sounds like code for &#34;no guns.&#34; Maybe when O&#39;Donnell tells his family that he&#39;s going after &#34;some bad guys,&#34; he&#39;s referring to the 110th. Of course, the burner phone incident and stilted dialogue could boil down to careless writing.

With Lee Child being involved with the making of the Amazon Prime Video series, it would be a shame if Reacher&#39;s plot diverged from the book only to fall into an obvious reveal. The series deserves a better twist, and having virtually any member of Reacher&#39;s hand-picked 110th Special Investigations Unit turn on the titular character wouldn&#39;t be satisfying. Jack Reacher has hammered home the fact that he doesn&#39;t believe anyone he hand-selected is capable of betraying the team; it would undermine Reacher&#39;s always-right intuition and sense of self. While that&#39;s intriguing from a character perspective, it&#39;s also a tired action-movie trope that Reacher should avoid.



Reacher season 2 is based on Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck and Trouble — the 11th novel in his Jack Reacher series.



O&#39;Donnell Can Betray Jack Reacher&#39;s 110th Without Being Involved In Franz&#39;s Death 
          

As the investigation uncovers more truths about New Age, Little Wing, and the murders of various ex-MP officers, the 110th&#39;s real traitor in Reacher season 2 seems more and more like it&#39;ll be Hortense Fields (Josh Blacker). From the character&#39;s shoehorned introduction in episode 3 to Fields&#39; awkward appearances in subsequent flashbacks about the 110th&#39;s early days, Hortense seems like a prime suspect. If he isn&#39;t involved, Fields&#39; appearances are just bizarre set dressing. Since Fields was never actually part of the 110th, the Hortense Fields twist would also avoid the tired trope of Jack Reacher being betrayed by a member of his own hand-picked team.

That said, even if Hortense Fields is the character from Reacher&#39;s past who&#39;s involved in the fatal conspiracy against the 110th, that doesn&#39;t completely absolve O&#39;Donnell. If Reacher season 2 wants to implicate O&#39;Donnell in a way that doesn&#39;t completely compromise his character, it&#39;s possible he&#39;s been set up to sell out the 110th — his former family — to protect his wife and children. In that sense, O&#39;Donnell might not have been directly involved in the murders. That kind of twist even aligns with David O&#39;Donnell&#39;s current career in political blackmail, and furthers Reacher&#39;s point about the dangers of settling down in a corrupt system.
