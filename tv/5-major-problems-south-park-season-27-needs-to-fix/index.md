## Literature Review
South Park season 27 is likely to arrive in February 2024, but the comedy has to solve numerous recurring issues in this highly anticipated return.




While South Park season 27 is sure to command a sizable audience, the ever-popular satirical series needs to fix a lot of major issues in this upcoming outing. South Park’s release schedule changed in 2021 when the show’s co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker signed a historic $900 million deal. This saw the duo promise to produce six seasons and 14 feature-length specials of the series in the coming years. Since then, South Park has released two six-episode seasons between February and March 2022 and 2023, and four specials later in those years. 2024’s specials were October’s Joining the Panderverse and December’s Not Suitable for Children.
Judging by this relatively consistent schedule, South Park season 27 should begin airing in February 2024. However, the show will need to use this brief season to address numerous recurring issues. The brevity of these six-episode seasons means that most South Park outings replicate the same problems as their predecessors since the show rarely has time to change its approach. Seasons 25 and 26 both ran into the same issues as did the specials released in 2022 and 2023. While all of these South Park offerings had their moments, season 27 is still overdue a re-evaluation of the show’s creative approach.



 5  South Park’s Lack of Holiday Episodes 
South Park’s new schedule means the show has no Halloween or Christmas episodes



Since South Park’s seasons now air between February and March, the show never has an opportunity to release any new holiday specials. This wouldn’t be a major issue for a lot of sitcoms, but South Park’s best holiday offerings are among the show’s greatest outings. One South Park Christmas episode hinted at Kenny’s true identity years before the show finally revealed this twist, while another featured Cartman taking on a heroic role for the first time. Christmas offers the relentlessly profane South Park an inimitable chance to mock sentimental holiday specials, while Halloween allows the gruesome, gory show to return to its roots.
It is easy to forget that South Park began life as a parody of sci-fi and horror movies set in the titular small town. While the show shifted its focus to current events around season 4, seasons 1—3 featured a plethora of aliens, monsters, demons, and zombies. This gory mayhem remains central to South Park’s appeal, as even the show’s most thoughtful political commentary has moments of gross-out gore and bizarre villains like the killer cryptid ManBearPig. Despite this, South Park: Not Suitable for Children failed to capitalize on its December 20 release date, while Joining the Panderverse didn’t use its October 27 release to focus on Halloween.



 4  Mr. Garrison’s Unclear Role

In season 19, South Park played a risky game by using the show’s longstanding character Mr. Garrison as a stand-in for the controversial presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Outspoken and campy, Garrison voiced outrageous viewpoints that were clearly a parody of Trump’s divisive rhetoric. However, this storyline began to fall apart when Trump unexpectedly won the 2016 election. Midway through season 20, South Park had to decide whether Mr. Garrison was literally Donald Trump, an analog of Trump, or a separate character entirely. In true South Park fashion, the show never really clarified this in the years that followed, with Garrison only standing in for Trump sometimes.
As such, South Park season 27 must now explain whether Garrison is a full-time Trump parody or simply a foul-mouthed school teacher. To be fair to the show’s creators, South Park season 26 addressed Garrison’s weird role in episode 6, “Spring Break.” This season finale saw Garrison go on a romantic getaway with his partner, only for him to be tempted back into holding Republican presidential rallies once in South Carolina. This storyline depicted a Garrison who was caught between being a stand-in for Trump and a small-town teacher, but season 27 will have to choose one road or the other as the show continues.




 3  South Park’s Relationship With Serialization

One reason that Garrison’s story is so confusing is that South Park has a troubled relationship with serialization. The show wholeheartedly embraced this storytelling style in season 19 and gained critical acclaim in the process, with the outing’s 10 episodes forming a cohesive larger story. However, when season 20’s planned plot was upended by Trump’s victory, the finale was cheekily dubbed “The End of Serialization as We Know It.” Since then, the show has bounced between standalone storylines and interconnected multi-episode arcs without ever choosing one consistent storytelling style.



 2  Cartman’s Inconsistent Character Arc 
Cartman has been redeemed and re-villainized repeatedly



While South Park: Not Suitable for Children made Cartman a more heroic character than he usually is, this was just the latest in a string of stories that were not sure what to do with the character. Cartman has become less outwardly antagonistic in recent seasons and specials, burying his feud with Kathleen Kennedy in Joining the Panderverse and saving Cupid Ye in the season 26 premiere. While it would be interesting to see a more likable version of Cartman, his antics in episodes like season 26, episode 5, “DikinBaus Hot Dogs,” prove that this change is never consistent enough to stick.




 1  Randy Marsh’s Main Character Status 
Randy can’t continue to be South Park’s de facto lead character



The biggest issue that South Park must address in season 27 is the role of Stan’s father, Randy Marsh. In the early seasons of the series, Randy was a mild-mannered suburban dad and little more. Around season 24, outings like episode 3, “Medicinal Fried Chicken,” and episode 14, “Creme Fraiche,” turned him into a wackier, more outrageous figure. This eventually led to Randy becoming South Park’s unofficial fifth main character, with him playing a bigger role than his son Stan in specials like Joining the Panderverse and Not Suitable for Children. The problem with this approach is that making Randy South Park’s lead character betrays the show’s original premise.


South Park was intended to show the world through the eyes of children, to illustrate the absurdity of contemporary society. When South Park makes Randy its main character, the show becomes just another animated sitcom about a middle-aged father behaving badly. This is a well-worn trope that South Park doesn’t need to succeed. As such, season 27 should take its focus off Randy and re-center Kenny, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Butters. In doing so, the series should have more time to flesh out Cartman’s character arc and tell a more consistent serialized story. Thus, South Park season 27 could fix all its major issues at once.
