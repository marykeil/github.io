## Literature Review
M*A*S*H star Gary Burghoff looks back on what it was like to film Radar&#39;s exit, and why they had to reshoot it after it initially went wrong.




After the failure of Gary Burghoff&#39;s first attempt to shoot Radar&#39;s final scene in M*A*S*H, the show needed some major reshoots. Having begun in 1972, during the Vietnam War, the show followed an enormous cast of soldiers living in a military camp in South Korea. It ran until 1983 and was originally adapted from the 1970 movie of the same name. Burghoff stayed with the show until season 8, when he decided to retire from his role as Radar.




Having spent so many years as a member of the M*A*S*H* cast, Burghoff hoped for Radar&#39;s exit to be a truly touching moment. During the upcoming M*A*S*H: The Comedy That Changed Television special, Burghoff reveals that he initially portrayed Radar&#39;s goodbye as an emotional and tearful finale. The director tried to advise against it, but Burghoff insisted, and eventually realized that he made a mistake. Check out his quote below, via Entertainment Weekly:


&#34;I said to myself, what a wonderful moment, I can cry my eyes out and I can do this wonderful dramatic moment, I can just completely fall apart. And the director said, &#39;If I were you, I would fight the tears.&#39; And I said, &#39;No, no. Just let me do it, okay?&#39; The next day, in dailies, I look at the screen and it&#39;s awful. I mean, it is just terrible. The director was right, I was wrong... I said, &#39;Please can I do this again?&#39; And he said, &#39;Yes, you may.&#39;&#34;



 Radar&#39;s Final Scene Is Already Perfect 
          




Radar&#39;s final moments in M*A*S*H come in the wake of a series of hardships that eventually permit him to be discharged from the military entirely. After being trampled by mishap after mishap in camp, the death of his uncle and the declining health of his mother give him all the reasons that he needs to leave. His final episode, fittingly titled &#34;Good-Bye Radar: Part 2,&#34; is a tragic one, as Radar wanders around camp in a state of melancholy.

The surprise farewell party was meant to be a massive affair in camp, but Radar is left alone as the ensemble is forced to tend to newly arrived wounded soldiers. Instead of breaking down in tears, as Burghoff wanted, Radar instead displays courage and understanding as he considers everything that he leaves behind. He gives his goodbyes and leaves with just a few salutes. For an increasingly embittered Radar, it was the perfect way to leave the show without sacrificing the character&#39;s growth.

                  5 MASH Actors Who Left The Show (&amp; Why)   Several key MASH actors exited the show at the height of its popularity, with reasons ranging from fear of typecasting to creative differences.    




Because it ran for so many years, M*A*S*H was inevitably going to be forced to say goodbye to regulars, including Radar, Father Mulcahy, and even Trapper. Each exit gave the actors opportunities to move on with their careers, but it was always a bittersweet moment, as characters were forced to say goodbye to the camp. It can be tempting to make their exits into emotional and tearful farewells, but director Charles S. Dubin was right to recommend that Radar&#39;s exit from M*A*S*H not be too dramatic.



M*A*S*H is available for streaming on Hulu.
