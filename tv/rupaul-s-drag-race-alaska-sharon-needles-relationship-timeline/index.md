## Literature Review

RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race stars Alaska and Sharon Needles became a beloved series duo, and this relationship timeline maps out their highs and lows. 




VH1&#39;s ultra-successful reality competition show RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race introduced the world to many truly memorable queens and couples, and Sharon Needles and Alaska were notably lovable couples. As one of the best reality TV shows, Drag Race has proven to be one of TV&#39;s most endearing (and enduring). While the competition element certainly draws in viewers, another critical element that drives the series&#39; success is its stars, some of whom are very watchable.




Although each drag queen is only on for a season or two, half the fun of watching RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race follows the personal lives of stars like Sharon Needles and Alaska. The two queens met in Pittsburgh and soon began a Haus of Haunt noise band. Haus eventually shifted to a drag family known for a punk/spook aesthetic, which the world quickly fell in love with. When Sharon joined Drag Race season 4, Alaska did feel jealous. However, she had a choice. She could support her partner or leave.

 RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race&#39;s Alaska Supported Sharon 
Alaska supported Sharon and even showed up for the finale to watch her partner win. Alaska went on to join the cast of season 5 and became a runner-up before winning All-Stars 2. Despite being known as a RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race power couple, Alaska and Sharon announced their split in 2013. Although they broke up, they remain best friends. They&#39;ve explained that they are better apart than they are together. The relationship had two stars, and it was difficult for them to balance the attention with their personal lives. Despite their best efforts, it was time to quit and move on.






 RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race&#39;s Alaska Has Built A Successful Career 
          

After Alaska&#39;s All-Stars 2 win, she joined a drag super group called the AAA Girls, which included other Drag Race alums Willam (season 4) and Courtney Act (season 6). Alaska has also had a very successful music career and co-hosts a podcast with Willam called Race Chaser. Sharon Needles went on to focus on music. She has come out with several albums, including Taxidermy (2015), Battle Axe (2017), and an LP called Spoopy (2019).

Alaska and Sharon might not be together anymore, but they remain good friends and never speak ill of each other. Both queens have so much more to offer, and their journeys are unique. Super couples are nothing new in the entertainment world, and RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race will surely showcase more charismatic pairs in the future.






RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race airs on Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.
