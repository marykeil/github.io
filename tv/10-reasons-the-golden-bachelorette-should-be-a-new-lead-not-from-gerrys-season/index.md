## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelorette hasn&#39;t been officially announced, but if ABC goes ahead with the show, the lead shouldn&#39;t come from The Golden Bachelor.




Several of The Golden Bachelor contestants are frontrunners to be first-ever lead of The Golden Bachelorette, but there are several reasons why the star should actually be someone new. The Golden Bachelor featured 72-year-old Gerry Turner, a retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, searching for another chance at true love. His wife, Toni, tragically died six years ago after 43 wonderful years together. Gerry had his pick of 22 fabulous women aged 60 and older. After a beautiful journey on The Golden Bachelor, Gerry got engaged to Theresa Nist, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey. They will be married on January 4, 2024, in a live, televised wedding.
After the great success of The Golden Bachelor, there has been a lot of speculation that a Golden Bachelorette spin-off is in the works. ABC has even put out a casting call for the show. Many of Gerry&#39;s finalists, including Sandra Mason, Kathy Swarts, Susan Noles, Ellen Goltzer, third place finisher Faith Martin, and runner-up Leslie Fhima are frontrunners for the role, but it might be better if the Golden Bachelorette were someone completely new.

 10  The Golden Bachelorette Would Be More Exciting With A New Lead 
Most Bachelor Nation Shows Cast Former Contestants


 







For many seasons, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette leads have been cast-offs from previous seasons of the show. It&#39;s been a long time since Bachelor Nation has met someone entirely new. It would be a shame if The Golden Bachelorette followed this same predictable pattern. Although Gerry&#39;s women are truly fantastic, it would be more exciting to meet a completely new woman, recreating the experience of viewers meeting Gerry for the first time. An entirely new Golden Bachelorette lead could be exactly what the franchise needs to spice it up.





 9  The Golden Bachelorette Contestants Might Be Expecting A Specific Lead 
The Golden Bachelorette Men Might Want To See Certain Golden Bachelor Women
        

Like other Bachelor Nation shows, it&#39;s possible that the upcoming Golden Bachelorette contestants might be expecting a specific woman from The Golden Bachelor to be the lead of the new show. If a man expected to see one woman when he emerged from the limousine, and instead found someone else waiting for him, he might be disappointed. This will lead to heartache for everyone involved. With a new lead, there will be no competition between the lead and the other women who weren&#39;t chosen to star on The Golden Bachelorette. It would be a fresh start and much more fair to everyone involved.





 8  Fans Already Have Strong Opinions About The Golden Bachelor Contestants 
Bachelor Nation Can Be Brutal
        

The Golden Bachelor fans have already formed strong opinions about the women from Gerry&#39;s season, both good and bad. They see Leslie and Faith as scorned, yet strong, women who are heroes, and have bought into the show&#39;s portrayal of Kathy as a villain who tells it like it is. However, these personas were created by the show, and might not be entirely accurate. Once a Bachelor Nation contestant is cast in a certain light, it&#39;s very hard to change viewers&#39; minds. This can lead to disappointment in the heroes and resentment towards the villains. Having a new person as the Golden Bachelorette would prevent this from happening.





 7  The Pool Of Golden Bachelor Women Isn&#39;t Diverse Enough 
Bachelor Nation Needs More Diversity
        

Although The Golden Bachelor women are lovely, there isn&#39;t enough diversity among them. Many of them were of similar races and ethnicities, religions and body types. The Bachelor franchise has long been criticized for its lack of diversity. Bringing in an entirely new Golden Bachelorette would give the show the opportunity to perhaps cast a person with a background that&#39;s never been seen in the lead of a Bachelor franchise show before.
            
 
 The Golden Bachelor Runner-Up Leslie Fhima Should Be The Golden Bachelorette 
Leslie Fhima was Gerry Turner&#39;s runner-up on The Golden Bachelor. This charismatic and kind woman should be the first Golden Bachelorette.









 6  Many Of The Golden Bachelor Contestants Don&#39;t Want To Leave Their Families 
Several Golden Bachelor Contestants Weren&#39;t Willing To Uproot Their Lives


Throughout The Golden Bachelor, a recurring theme was the importance of family. Two of the women, Marina Perera and Joan Vassos, even left the show in order to attend to family matters. During Faith&#39;s hometown visit, she expressed that she&#39;d be unwilling to move away from her home in Benton City, Washington, because she wouldn&#39;t leave her family. Although it&#39;s admirable, respectable, and understandable that the women wouldn&#39;t want to relocate, they&#39;d have to have a very limited group of men if they starred on The Golden Bachelorette. The show should cast a woman who is willing to uproot her life for true love if necessary.





 5  It Might Appear That The Golden Bachelorette Is Not There For The Right Reasons 
The Golden Bachelorette Lead Could Appear To Be Chasing Clout
        

Questions of sincerity often arise on Bachelor Nation shows. Viewers speculate about whether contestants have joined the shows &#34;for the right reasons,&#34; or whether they&#39;re just chasing clout and social media followers. The Golden Bachelor women seemed to really have fallen in love with Gerry, but, if they take on the lead role of the Golden Bachelorette, they might appear to be insincere. Some might wonder if they only joined the show in the first place in order to become the first Golden Bachelorette. To avoid this, a new woman should be selected for the lead role.





 4  The Golden Bachelor Women Might Not Be Over Gerry Turner Yet 
Several Golden Bachelor Women Fell In Love With Gerry


 







If the Golden Bachelor women were as in love with Gerry as they said they were, then it&#39;s highly possible that they&#39;re not over him yet. Women such as Faith and Leslie had deep connections with him, and even exchanged &#34;I love yous&#34; with him. He met their families, and Leslie met his as well. On top of this, Gerry broke up with them, blindsiding them as he chose another woman.
Because of this, it might not be the best idea for one of the women to jump into another relationship, never mind over twenty new connections. Although time will have passed, and they might be over Gerry by then, it would probably be better to choose a woman who isn&#39;t fresh out of a relationship for the Golden Bachelorette.





 3  The Golden Bachelor Finalists Won&#39;t Want Another Emotional Roller Coaster 
The Golden Bachelor Women Have Been Through Enough
        

Because of the intensity of their feelings for Gerry, The Golden Bachelor finalists, particularly the last few, were very hurt when Gerry broke up with them. Gerry was also devastated, even telling host Jesse Palmer that the only time he felt worse in his life than when he broke up with Leslie was when his wife passed away. Knowing how hard it was for Gerry, and how difficult it was for them, the women might not want to go through another emotional roller coaster.
While breakups are never easy at any age, these older women have had their fair share of heartache in their lives, including divorces and the deaths of their husbands. They might not be as willing to go through more trauma as a younger woman would. They also might fear hurting their contestants the way that they were hurt when Gerry broke up with them.

 2  It Would Be Impossible To Choose Just One Golden Bachelor Finalist 
There Are So Many Golden Bachelor Fan Favorites


 







The Golden Bachelor had so many fan favorite contestants that it would be difficult for the producers to choose just one. Fans would inevitably be disappointed that their favorite wasn&#39;t chosen, which could lead to backlash for whichever woman they choose. It might be better and more fair to start fresh with a completely new woman with no existing fan base.





 1  The Golden Bachelorette Should Be A Celebrity 
The Golden Bachelorette Lead Should Be Someone Very Famous
        

Rather than choose from Gerry&#39;s Golden Bachelor finalists, the producers should invite a celebrity to be the first-ever Golden Bachelorette. It would be exciting to see an older woman with whom the audience is already familiar have another chance at true love. There has always been speculation that celebrities might be cast in Bachelor Nation shows, and The Golden Bachelorette would be a wonderful opportunity to try this idea.
The Golden Bachelorette appears to be right around the corner, and ABC has many options for its first-ever lead. However, it might be best if she didn&#39;t come from Gerry&#39;s season for many reasons. No matter who the show finally casts as its leading lady, the senior dating series is certain to be just as ground-breaking and compelling as The Golden Bachelor.
