## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner has faced some harsh allegations about his dating history after the season finale. Now he addresses those claims.




The Golden Bachelor leading man Gerry Turner is disputing allegations about his career and dating history after a bombshell report brought some damaging information to light. On The Golden Bachelor season finale, Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, got engaged to Theresa Nist, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey. They plan to get married on January 4, 2024, in a live, televised wedding. Gerry portrayed himself as a widower who hadn&#39;t dated anyone seriously since his wife passed away. However, an exposé, published by The Hollywood Reporter the day before the finale, told a very different story.




In a new article from The Hollywood Reporter, Gerry responded to the original allegations that, before The Golden Bachelor, he had a serious girlfriend, who was kept a secret, named &#34;Carolyn.&#34; He dated her for ten months, and then she lived with him in his home in Indiana for one year and nine months. She claimed that he&#39;d broken up with her because she&#39;d gained ten pounds before his high school reunion. In addition, although The Golden Bachelor referred to him as a retired restaurateur, he sold that business in 1985, and most recently worked as a handyman. Gerry explained that by saying that he retired at 55, and &#34;I was very happy giving back to the community.&#34; Gerry added, &#34;There’s just enough truth in [the article].&#34;

 Gerry Turner Doesn’t &#34;Have Time&#34; To Think About Golden Bachelor Allegations 
          




As for his dating life, Gerry explained, that he &#34;dated a number of women, but then it becomes an issue of how you define whether you’re in a relationship. [The relationship referenced in THR] really didn’t [last a few years].&#34; Gerry added that he hadn&#39;t really looked at the story’s accuracy, but considered it more &#34;in terms of timing, and how it really doesn’t fit with all of the positive things that are going on in my life right now. I mean, I’m sitting across from Theresa right now, and I look at her, and she’s the love of my life. And I really don’t have time to think about some of the other stuff.&#34;


 

It was disheartening to realize that The Golden Bachelor might&#39;ve painted Gerry as a bit more innocent in his dating history than he really was. However, the Bachelor franchise is notorious for creating characters out of real people&#39;s lives. Finding out that Gerry might have had a serious girlfriend before the show doesn&#39;t take away from the relationship that he has with Theresa. It also doesn&#39;t mean that he wasn&#39;t honest with the women. He could&#39;ve told them about his dating history, and it could&#39;ve been edited out in order to fit the narrative that the show wanted to tell.




There will always be someone who wants to tear down situations that appear to be great. The Golden Bachelor was an uplifting and inspiring show that made people believe that they could find love at any age, no matter how much heartache and tragedy they&#39;d been through. Even if Gerry&#39;s past isn&#39;t really exactly how it was portrayed on the show, he and the women, especially Theresa, still told a story of love and hope that will now become a real-life marriage. Gerry is right to ignore these allegations. After everything they&#39;ve been through, Gerry and Theresa deserve to be happy. They&#39;re wished all the best in this next chapter of their lives together.
