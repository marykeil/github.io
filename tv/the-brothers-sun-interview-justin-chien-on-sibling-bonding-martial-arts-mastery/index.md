Summary

  The Brothers Sun is an action-comedy series on Netflix, featuring Michelle Yeoh, Justin Chien, and Sam Song Li in the main roles.   The show follows the story of Charles Sun, a Taipei gangster, who travels to LA to protect his family after his father is injured.   The Brothers Sun combines martial arts action with a family drama storyline and comedic elements, creating a unique and entertaining viewing experience.  





Netflix&#39;s new action show The Brothers Sun arrives on January 4, created by Brad Falchuk (of Glee, American Horror Story, and Scream Queens fame) and Byron Wu. Though it is steeped in martial arts, depicting a growing war between Taiwanese triads, it is also at its heart a family drama with comedic elements. Noted action star Michelle Yeoh plays Eileen Sun, the matriarch of an intimidating triad who nevertheless lives a quiet life in LA with only one of her two sons.




After a mysterious assassin shoots her husband, her eldest son Charles (Justin Chien) travels to the U.S. to keep the rest of his family safe. This includes his younger brother Bruce (Sam Song Li), who has no idea about the family business, and who rarely sees Charles or their father. The strong ensemble cast of The Brothers Sun also includes Highdee Kuan, Joon Lee, Alice Hewkin, Jon Xue Zhang, Jenny Yang, and Madison Hu.

Screen Rant interviewed Justin Chien about his audition process for The Brothers Sun, his own background in martial arts before preparing for the show&#39;s action sequences, and developing his onscreen bond with costar Sam Song Li.


 Justin Chien Talks The Brothers Sun 
         




Screen Rant: The show is so much fun. What was that audition process like for you? And then when you found out that Michelle Yeoh was going to be your mom, what was that experience like?


Justin Chien: Totally. It was actually quite a long audition process. I think for me it was around seven or eight weeks. My first pre-read was in Taiwan. I remember reading the script and the size and the breakdown and immediately feeling like I knew who this was. I immediately, it was like, &#34;This is me. I know I can do this.&#34; So that gave me a lot of confidence and peace going into the audition process and the successive callbacks week after week were all at 6:00 in the morning. I&#39;d get up at 4:30, get a quick workout and shower, get into character, and do all of that. But fortunately, it worked out in terms of doing it over Zoom. And then I didn&#39;t hear anything in two weeks. I&#39;d already committed to shoot an indie feature in Taiwan at the time, and they asked me if I could come back to do an in-person audition.
And I told them, &#34;Look, I can&#39;t do that. I&#39;ve committed to this and I need to see it through.&#34; So they said, &#34;Okay, we&#39;ll wait.&#34; And I was like, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s a great sign.&#34; So after I wrapped, I flew back and I had a couple of days to get over jet lag, and the final audition was, I don&#39;t know, it was like a three-hour long mix and match with different actors, and I gave it everything I had. I left it all out there. And then a few days later, the Casting Director, Jenny Jue, she texted me, she&#39;s like, &#34;Can we talk?&#34; And in my mind I&#39;m like, &#34;What is there talk about? Just tell me I got it or not.&#34;
They start going, &#34;Thank you so much for being here. It was a really difficult decision, but ultimately we had to give the decision to Netflix and you got the part.&#34; And I was like, &#34;What?&#34; And I started crying because in that moment it felt like it wasn&#39;t all for nothing. When I found out that Michelle was even being rumored to be a part of the cast, I had just seen Everything, Everywhere, All At Once. And within the first five minutes, I was ugly crying. Because I was like, &#34;This woman might play my mom. How crazy is that?&#34; And when she joined, it was a dream come true.





The Brothers Sun are practically strangers when the series starts having spent so much time apart, but your chemistry is the foundation of the story. What&#39;s it like bouncing that ball back and forth with Sam and really getting closer over the course of the season?


Justin Chien: It was just so much fun. I mean, Sam is, I truly do see him as my little brother. I have two younger brothers in real life too, so I&#39;m very used to that dynamic. He&#39;s just so naturally funny. I look at him and sometimes I&#39;m just already entertained, but he&#39;s also so relentlessly positive and cheery, and that&#39;s something that I really admire about him. So the long days, long hours, it was easy with him because I knew that he was always going to have a good attitude and it was a lot of fun. So that chemistry definitely came, fortunately, came quite naturally for us.


The family setup for the Suns is very unique, and yet Charles seems like he feels like he knows exactly what his place is and what he&#39;s meant to be doing until he gets to the US. Can you talk about going from being a leader in your family to feeling out of place in the household?





Justin Chien: That&#39;s a wonderful question. I think Charles is a broken and tortured soul that deals with a lot of guilt. Charles blames himself for Bruce and Mama Sun leaving, and I think he remembers the young child-like moment and feels like it&#39;s his fault. Because he has this guilt, I think he&#39;s grown up thinking that the life that he has is all that he deserves, and he should be happy with it because he can still survive. He can make a living. He has a purpose to serve. I think he at times deals with a lot of self-loathing and self-hatred and sees himself as a bit of a monster. But at least he is a monster with a purpose to serve. And when he comes to the States, I think that&#39;s when he starts to realize that no matter what his past is, other people may judge him. Other people may decide that he is one thing or another, but if he can find it within himself to forgive himself, then maybe he can have a shot at having some semblance of a normal life.


          




The show is filled with martial arts, choreographed violence, and action sequences that you are a very large part of. How did you prepare for those scenes, and was there any aspect of it that was hardest for you?


Justin Chien: I have a background in Muay Thai and jiu-jitsu. I&#39;ve been doing Muay Thai for about 10 years, and jiu-jitsu for the last four, I just got my blue belt, but I was really lucky to be training under the tutelage of Justin Yu, Michael Lair and Eric Brown, who are all from the original John Wick films. I was lucky, I had a three-month stunt training period before we started production. And so in a week, it was a maximum of 10 or 11 sessions of stunt training, choreography, weapons training, and weightlifting to get my body ready for the role.
The most challenging part of it, apart from the sheer volume of some of the fights, I&#39;d say the thing that I picked up the most was the importance of precision, like every strike, the amount of flick involved, the breath behind it, the emotion behind it, all of that has to be dialed in addition to where my punch lands on a camera or if it&#39;s actually I&#39;m making contact, how pure that contact is. That&#39;s something that&#39;s different from real fighting that I&#39;ve learned is the importance of precision. Not that it&#39;s not important in real fighting as well, but more so in film fighting.





As a rom-com enthusiast, another dynamic that I was deeply invested in, wonderful, was Charles and Alexis, which was a whole rollercoaster of emotions. What&#39;s it like to kind of dive into this relationship that already has a backstory? We don&#39;t get to see it, but we know that they&#39;ve come from a past together that plays into every scene.


Justin Chien: That&#39;s a great question. I had a wonderful time working with Highdee Kuan. I knew that any day that she was on the call, it was going to be a good day. It&#39;s one of my favorite aspects of Charles&#39;s character because I think it represents the last time that he truly felt a sense of pure childlike joy. And I think he holds onto that memory.
I think I decided that Charles had kept tabs on Alexis, and part of him was hoping that somehow she would find him, because I think even though he might not think he deserves it, he yearns for a sense of romantic connection and love. And I think he did feel that when he was a kid with Alexis in Taipei. So it&#39;s one of the last beautiful memories that he has that I think he&#39;s always trying to hold on to.





Is there any aspect of this world you&#39;d like to see explored in season 2, if we get it, which I&#39;m sure we will?


Justin Chien: I would love to see more of Taipei. I grew up there. I think it would be amazing if we could shoot a couple of episodes there. Without spoiling too much, I&#39;d love to see certain relationships explored deeper. I&#39;d love to see more of Charles attempting to live a normal life because I think there&#39;s something really endearing and kind of funny about this guy trying to bake a cake or trying to do things that we take for granted as regular people. I think there&#39;s a lot of room for some really, really endearing and funny moments.
