# The Polar Express 2 Can No Longer Count On The Original Movie s Greatest Strength


## SUMMARY 



  The sequel to The Polar Express will face challenges as it can no longer rely on the original movie&#39;s biggest strength: animation.   The competition in the animated movie genre has significantly increased over the last two decades, making it difficult for The Polar Express 2 to stand out visually.   To surpass the flaws of the original film, The Polar Express 2 should focus on a more logical and realistic story while bringing back Tom Hanks for a stronger plot.

## Literature Review

The Polar Express is a classic Christmas film that was revolutionary during its era, but the sequel can no longer rely on its greatest strength.




Despite The Polar Express being a classic Christmas film, the planned sequel will have to get creative as it can&#39;t rely on the original movie&#39;s greatest strength. With The Polar Express 2 officially in development, the sequel will no longer be able to use the same qualities of 20 years ago to find success. The 2004 film sometimes causes division, as, despite being widely regarded as a classic Christmas movie, it does have some shortcomings. Thankfully, The Polar Express has some major qualities, like Tom Hanks&#39; stellar performances and a charming story, but its biggest strength is no longer reliable.




With 20 years passing since the original was released, the movie landscape has changed significantly and so have the standards of modern films. In 2004, the movie was huge, and The Polar Express held the IMAX box office record for five years until it was eventually beaten by James Cameron&#39;s Avatar. It was clearly a huge hit for a lot of reasons, and its impressive box office proves The Polar Express is a holiday classic that doesn&#39;t deserve the hate. Despite this, its divisive past does mean the sequel will face challenges, especially as its greatest quality won&#39;t hold up.


 The Polar Express 2 Can&#39;t Count On Animation To Succeed 
         

Animation was easily The Polar Express&#39; biggest strength, but it can no longer count on this for the sequel. Not everyone was a fan of the movie&#39;s animated style, as it has sometimes been labeled creepy. However, for its time, it was a truly unique style that offered something different to the competition. Disney Pixar was an established studio making huge films and DreamWorks Animation was on the rise in 2004, giving The Polar Express huge competition. While it may have been off-putting to some, the film&#39;s use of motion capture helped it stand out and become an animated classic.




While its interesting form of animation helped it 20 years ago, it will struggle to carry the movie this time around. The Polar Express&#39; animation has aged and will no longer be able to compete today. Given animation has evolved so much, The Polar Express 2 might become even more visually impressive than the first, but it will need far more than that to stand out, given the competition. Tom Hanks&#39; seven Polar Express characters were a memorable part of the original, and it is these strengths the sequel should focus on as opposed to relying on animation.



The Polar Express is available to watch on AMC Plus.






 The Christmas Sequel Faces Hefty Competition When It Comes To Animated Movies 
          




When it comes to animated films, the level has increased monumentally over the last two decades. While Pixar and DreamWorks were already doing well before The Polar Express&#39; release, they have become powerhouses in the animation game. Both have adopted their own styles and had great success over the years, with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish being a recent example of one of the big studios flexing their animated qualities. Anime has also made it onto the big screen in recent years, bringing these huge franchises to cinemas, and other studios are also nailing animated movies.

Two of the best animated movies of 2023 show how hefty the competition is in the genre. The Boy and the Heron, alongside Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, have proven how far animation has come, providing such different yet visually stunning experiences. Animated movies have thrived in 2023 alone and have proven to be diverse in their styles, indicating how tough it will be for The Polar Express 2 to thrive in that department. It may still have great animation, but the sequel will struggle to surpass these films visually and must find other ways to compete with the modern classics.




                  If The Polar Express 2 Doesn&#39;t Have Tom Hanks, We Don&#39;t Want It   The Polar Express 2 has been announced as being in development but without Tom Hanks&#39; involvement, the sequel might not be worth the hype.   



 How The Polar Express 2 Can Still Surpass The Original Film 
          

Beating the original film will be difficult, but The Polar Express 2 can still surpass it. While there is plenty to love about the movie, there are also several things that don&#39;t make sense in The Polar Express. It is never made clear how kids get the tickets to board the train, why they are so special, and the whole premise of letting children go on this journey in the first place doesn&#39;t seem very realistic, especially with how dangerous the trip becomes. It may have its charming moments, but The Polar Express also has a lot of flaws.




To surpass this, the story must be more logical and realistic. Assuming the sequel follows a similar premise, The Polar Express 2 should explain more details about the tickets as well as why the train journey is so safe that parents allow their kids to go on it without their supervision. It also must create suspense in new ways, rather than another chaotic train journey. Most importantly, The Polar Express sequel must bring back Tom Hanks and let him have the same freedom. Hanks was key to the film being so successful and could flourish with a stronger plot.
