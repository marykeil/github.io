## Literature Review
Big Brother&#39;s Nicole Franzel has been no stranger to drama and controversy. This is an overview of some of her most memorable scandals. 




The inaugural season of Big Brother Reindeer Games ended with Nicole Franzel-Arroyo being named the winner of the $100,000 cash prize. Nicole was the underdog to win the Big Brother holiday-themed spin-off, having won fewer challenges than most of the other contestants. She won only one Jingle Bell Brawl and one Santa&#39;s Showdown but went on to beat fellow finalist Taylor Hale for the grand prize. Big Brother powerhouses Frankie Grande and Xavier Prather also made it to the top four but were eliminated.




This was Nicole&#39;s fourth time competing on Big Brother and her second win. She first appeared on Big Brother 16 in 2014, then won Big Brother 18 in 2016, placed third on Big Brother 22: All Stars in 2020, and now on Big Brother Reindeer Games. Despite her many accomplishments in the Big Brother world, Nicole has been the subject of several scandals and controversies.

 Nicole&#39;s Longtime Feud With Britney Haynes 
          

Big Brother Reindeer Games rehashed a longtime feud between Nicole and Britney Haynes. Britney competed on Big Brother 12 and 14 before coming back for Big Brother Reindeer Games. Britney and Nicole&#39;s feud stemmed from their time on The Amazing Race season 31. Britney was competing with fellow BB alum Janelle Pierzina. Janelle was open about disliking Nicole, and this dislike carried over to Britney. When Britney won the first Big Brother Reindeer Games Naughty Or Nice challenge, Nicole was afraid to talk to Britney, convinced she was going to be her target. While Britney shared that she wasn&#39;t Nicole&#39;s biggest fan, she wasn&#39;t going to let it impact her game.






 Nicole Had TWO Showmances 
          

Nicole had a romantic relationship during Big Brother 16 and Big Brother 18. Nicole&#39;s season 16 showmance with Hayden Voss continued after the season was over, but by the time she came back for season 18, she was single again. Season 18 is where she met her future husband, Victor Arroyo. Their showmance didn&#39;t stop her from winning the game and the $500,000 grand prize. The two former house guests are now married and have a child together.



 Nicole Criticized For Mocking Contestant With Autism 
          

In 2020, a Big Brother controversy surfaced after live feeds showed several contestants making fun of Big Brother All-Stars house guest Ian Terry. Ian, who is on the autism spectrum, was discussed in &#34;secret&#34; by houseguests who mocked his self-soothing technique of rocking back and forth. Nicole Franzel, Memphis Garrett, Christmas Abbott, and Dani Briones were on the live feed chatting about how Ian&#39;s behavior makes them uncomfortable. Things got worse when Memphis used the term &#34;red rum&#34; to describe Ian in the house, a line from The Shining. Nicole has since apologized to Ian for her behavior.






 Nicole Accused Of Spying For CBS 
          

Before the premiere of ​​Big Brother: All Stars, Nicole found herself at the center of wild social media accusations of acting as a spy on behalf of CBS. The controversy started when Twitter user Dylan Andrews (whose account has since been deleted) accused Nicole of eavesdropping on various group chats to see if players were strategizing and forming pre-game alliances. The idea was that, in return for her espionage services, Nicole had received a guaranteed spot on Big Brother: All-Stars. Nicole was even blamed for fan favorites Dan Gheesling and Derrick Levasseur (winners of Big Brother 10 and Big Brother 16, respectively) not being in the cast.



 Janelle Pierzina Alleges Nicole Replaced Rachel Reilly On Big Brother Reindeer Games 
          




Janelle from Big Brother seasons 6,7, 14, and 21 claims that Nicole replaced her friend and fellow reality TV veteran Rachel Reilly on Big Brother Reindeer Games. Rachel, who appeared on Big Brother 12 and won Big Brother 13, has neither confirmed nor denied Janelle&#39;s claim about CBS &#34;ghosting&#34; her. Janelle, who has a longtime feud with Nicole, didn&#39;t address why she wasn&#39;t cast in Big Brother Reindeer Games. However, she did confirm she is still under contract with Peacock due to competing in The Traitor US season 2.



Big Brother Reindeer Games concluded on December 21.
