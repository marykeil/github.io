## Literature Review

Fans of Netflix&#39;s series Fool Me Once have plenty of similar content to look forward to, including adaptations of Harlan Coben&#39;s other work.




Netflix has upcoming content similar to their latest original series, Fool Me Once. The series is based on author Harlan Coben&#39;s novel of the same name and follows the investigation into two mysterious deaths. Following the success of Fool Me Once and other adaptations of his work - such as The Stranger, Stay  , and The Woods - Coben has extended his deal with Netflix.
As part of the deal, Coben will work with Netflix to adapt his other novels, including a possible multi-season show for his 11-book series, Myron Bolitar. While the upcoming shows in collaboration with Coben haven&#39;t been given a release date, a few select novels have been confirmed to be developed. In addition, a few of Netflix&#39;s releases for the remainder of the year include series outside of Coben&#39;s work but are still comparable in tone.
            
 
 Fool Me Once: 10 Biggest Plot Holes &amp; Headscratchers 
Despite solving its many mysteries all simultaneously once the last piece of the puzzle was offered by Maya, Fool Me Once has various plot holes.












 








 8  Myron Bolitar (TBD) 
A series planned for multiple seasons
        

Myron Bolitar is a thriller series made up of 11 books by Harlan Coben. The plan is to have the Myron Bolitar series expand over multiple seasons, unlike previous adaptations on Netflix that were put out as a limited series. The books follow the titular character, Myron, who&#39;s a former NBA basketball player turned sports agent and detective. In an interview with Deadline discussing the extended Netflix deal, Coben said the series is in early development, therefore no official release date has been specified (via Deadline).





 7  Griselda (2024) 
Crime drama about a real-life Colombian drug trader


 







Griselda, the upcoming Netflix miniseries, is comparable to Fool Me Once with its crime and thriller elements but differs due to its source material. Unlike Fool Me Once, Griselda is a dramatized version of real-life events involving a known Colombian drug trader, Griselda Blanco. The miniseries stars Sofía Vergara as Griselda and utilizes producers from a successful Netflix original, Narcos. The series is set for release on January 25 and early reviews from critics on Rotten Tomatoes are praising the series&#39; pacing and Vergara&#39;s performance.





 6  The Tourist (2022) 
A mystery about a man&#39;s previous life
        

The thriller series, The Tourist, will now be released on Netflix in February 2024 after having been originally released on Max in 2022. Similar to Fool Me Once, the main character, Elliot, is solving a puzzling mystery, but rather than it being about a loved one, it&#39;s about himself. The series follows Elliot, a man with amnesia who has to put the pieces of his identity together before getting killed. The series, with more levity and less suspense in comparison to Fool Me Once, still engages audiences and invites them to help solve the mystery.
Season 1 will be released on February 1, 2024, and Season 2 will be released on February 29.







 5  A Killer Paradox (2024) 
A man who discovers a gift to identify killers


 







Set for release on Netflix on February 9, A Killer Paradox is the newest K-Drama on Netflix. A Killer Paradox is a thriller that involves death and mystery, similar to Fool Me Once. The story is based on a webtoon about a man, Lee Tang, played by Choi Woo-shik, who accidentally kills another person, which leads to him being followed and investigated by a detective. However, the man he killed was a serial killer, which leads to Lee Tang discovering a supernatural ability about himself to identify bad people.





 4  1992 (TBD) 
Follows the mysterious murders with the same MO
        

In July 2023, Netflix announced a new series by Spanish director Álex de la Iglesia. Much like Fool Me Once, 1992&#39;s lead character, Amparo, searches for answers about her husband&#39;s mysterious death. The real-life Seville Expo of 1992 in Spain acts as a key component for much of the series&#39; fictional plot.
According to the synopsis, the burned murder victims are all found with a replica of the Seville Expo mascot, Curro, lying next to them. The series&#39; teaser poster features a hooded and terrifying version of the mascot, contrasting with the original symbol that&#39;s colorful and representative of hope. Despite a lack of release date, fans of suspenseful thrillers have a lot to look forward to considering De la Iglesia&#39;s previous work with dark elements.





 3  Run Away (TBD) 
A father does all it takes to protect his family
        

An adapted series based on Coben&#39;s 2019 novel was announced before his extended deal with Netflix. The story follows a girl, who&#39;d been missing for months, and her father who are suspected of murder. The announcement was made before the book was published and further details have yet to be revealed concerning the plot. However, if the series were to follow the original text in ways similar to Fool Me Once and other Coben adaptations, audiences should expect to be immersed in the suspenseful story, never fully sure of what misdirections are coming.

 2  Just One Look (TBD) 
A woman uncovers the truth about her husband
        

Just One Look is Coben&#39;s 2004 mystery novel that continues with his themes of suspense and investigation. The story follows Grace as she must search for her runaway husband while discovering the truth about their past. There&#39;s no confirmed release date, but following the premiere of Fool Me Once, Coben spoke with RadioTimes and gave insight on the series&#39; current state, confirming filming is taking place and the series is in the hands of Netflix Poland (via RadioTimes).





 1  Dead Boy Detectives (2024) 
A deceased duo investigating crime on Earth


 







Dead Boy Detectives is a lighthearted alternative to the other series mentioned. It contains similar elements of mystery and crime that are present in Fool Me Once, but it leans more in the comedic superhero genre. The series is based on DC Comics characters Charles Rowland and Edwin Payne. Together, the two avoid the afterlife and investigate supernatural crimes on Earth. While no specific release date has been announced yet, the series is expected to be out in April 2024.
