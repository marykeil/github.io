Summary

  Juno Temple explains the deeper meaning behind Fargo season 5, episode 8&#39;s ending.   The episode&#39;s ending, with Graves being killed and buried on Roy&#39;s property, indicates the importance of Dot fighting for her survival.   Dot realizes that without a strong fight, she may not make it out alive.  







Fargo star Juno Temple has explained the deeper meaning behind season 5, episode 8&#39;s ending, indicating its importance for Dot as the final episodes loom. The latest episode of the show sees Roy kill Danish Graves, hiding his body next to a windmill on his property. Dot helplessly watches this unfold, still a captive by the time the episode ends.

Speaking with Entertainment Weekly, Temple revealed the deeper meaning behind how Fargo season 5, episode 8 ended. The actor indicated that Graves&#39; death informs Dot that, if she doesn&#39;t try to escape, then she too may end up dead. Check out what Temple had to say below:


I think that realization there is ugly, but it&#39;s also important. It is the moment where she realizes that if she doesn&#39;t really, really fight with everything she&#39;s f***ing got, that she won&#39;t make it out. And that&#39;s not an option.



 How Will Fargo Season 5 End? 
          




With only two episodes left, it won’t be long before Dot’s story reaches its definitive conclusion. Now that she’s been captured by Roy and is trapped on his land, a final confrontation between the pair will happen soon. This will be especially potent because of the abuse she’s suffered because of him, something she may get justice for before the season ends.

Some key characters in Fargo like Linda Tillman are already deceased, but given Graves&#39; death, it seems the body count could grow higher still. If Dot wants to get the upper hand and escape, she may have to kill Roy to do so. However, with many men on his side, it&#39;s unclear just how high the number of new deaths will be as the final two episodes of the season approach.

                  Fargo Season 5 Soundtrack Guide - Every Song &amp; When It Plays   The Fargo season 5 soundtrack is full of great needle-drops. The fifth season of the FX crime drama features songs by Yes, Rush, and Marilyn Manson.    




Other characters&#39; stories, such as those of Gator, Witt, and Indira will no doubt intersect with Dot&#39;s attempted escape, tying the whole story up by the end. However, it&#39;s unclear if everyone will make it out of the story alive, with some surprising deaths easily possible in the future. With just two episodes remaining, it won&#39;t be long before Fargo provides answers and gives the season a memorable conclusion.



New episodes of Fargo season 5 air on FX Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET, and stream the next day on Hulu.
