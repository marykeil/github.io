Summary

  The Golden Bachelor&#39;s live wedding event was full of surprises, including a shocking proposal between Bachelor Nation sweethearts.   Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding event was filled with interviews by Bachelor Nation host Jesse Palmer and other franchise favorites, discussing their love and future.   Brayden and Christina surprised everyone by openly sharing their love story and getting engaged during the event, with Gerry and Theresa&#39;s blessing.  







The Golden Bachelor&#39;s live wedding event was chock full of surprises, including a shocking proposal between two Bachelor Nation sweethearts. While Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist got ready for their wedding event, guests arrived and were interviewed by Bachelor Nation host Jesse Palmer, former Bachelorette Charity Lawson, and Golden Bachelor favorite Kathy Swarts. The interviews, typically with Golden Bachelor cast members and other Bachelor Nation favorites, were mostly about Gerry and Theresa&#39;s love and what the future holds for the stars of the franchise until a recent couple took the podium with Jesse to talk about their blossoming relationship.

Bachelor Nation star Brayden Bowers and Christina Mandrell spoke openly about their newfound love, sharing the story of how they met and what their future holds before a shocking surprise. As they spoke about their future, Brayden got down on one knee and proposed to a shocked Christina, who enthusiastically accepted his proposal.


 




Tearfully, the couple shared a kiss in front of the large crowd of wedding guests and shared their excitement with a champagne toast. &#34;Is that why we got our nails done?!&#34; Christina asked in shock (via ShesAllBach), as Jesse explained that Gerry and Theresa had given the proposal their blessing.


 Everything We Know About Brayden &amp; Christina&#39;s Relationship 
          

While Brayden may not have been a favorite during his time on Charity&#39;s season of The Bachelorette, Christina watched from afar as he spent time on the initial series and Bachelor In Paradise, believing she felt a connection with Brayden before the pair ever met. Brayden shared during The Golden Bachelor wedding telecast that Christina initially sent him a DM, and the pair bonded over messages before they ever met in person. Christina explained that the pair first realized they were romantically interested in one another when they both realized they were huge fans of Tenacious D, and continued to bond from there.





 

Brayden and Christina&#39;s relationship may be new to Bachelor Nation, but the pair have been seeing one another since the summer of 2023 when Brayden finished filming Bachelor In Paradise season 9. The pair quickly decided they were interested in one another, and once Bachelor In Paradise season 9 finished airing, they shared several photos and videos of their newfound love. Brayden has even gotten to know Christina&#39;s daughter, Blakely, and shared on The Golden Bachelor live special that he will be making the move to live with Christina and her daughter in Tennessee in the coming weeks.

Although The Golden Bachelor wedding is all about Theresa and Gerry&#39;s marriage, the sweet surprise of Brayden and Christina&#39;s engagement was wonderfully exciting for Bachelor Nation. After a season of Bachelor In Paradise that was somewhat disappointing, seeing a couple who was happy and in love finding each other through Bachelor Nation is truly a happy ending. With The Golden Bachelor wedding providing some incredibly exciting content, not just from Gerry and Theresa but from the rest of Bachelor Nation, it was truly an incredible event.
