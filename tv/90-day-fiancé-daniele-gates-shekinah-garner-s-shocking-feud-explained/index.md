## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way stars Shekinah Garner and Daniele Gates are having a catfight on social media. The reasons behind it are extreme.





90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cast members Daniele Gates and Shekinah Garner have been a part of a major scandal since the season 5 Tell All. Daniele, a 43-year-old former teacher from New York, was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise season 2 with Yohan Geronimo before starring in two more seasons of TOW after they got married. Shekinah, an aesthetician from Los Angeles, is new to the franchise and went to Istanbul in season 5 to stay with her boyfriend Sarper Güven.




Daniele and Shekinah interacted for the first time during the reunion, but it appears trouble had been brewing between them before the Tell All was aired. Shekinah accused Daniele of allegedly trying to contact her boyfriend to stir up trouble. Daniele, meanwhile, lashed out at Shekinah for being insecure and launching a smear campaign against her. The women have been publicly calling each other out on Instagram, much to the confusion of viewers.

 What Happened Between Daniele &amp; Shekinah In The Tell All 

 

Viewers sensed there was some underlying tension between Daniele and Shekinah when Kenneth Niedermeier asked Shekinah if she had any opinions about her co-stars backstage before the 90 Day Fiancé Tell-All. Shekinah said that she’s said hello to Daniele and Daniele didn’t say hi back. She said that Daniele seems to be the kind of person who’s “superior to everyone” and better than the rest of the cast. Shekinah said that she wasn’t there to make friends, so she didn’t really care. “If she doesn’t like me, you know, that’s fine,” she added. Meanwhile, Shekinah played an audio message from Sarper where he was telling her how to behave during the Tell All.




Shekinah insisted that the message was “endearing” and not controlling, while he was telling her things like not to use dark lipstick or contour and to “sit straight” and avoid carbs. Daniele had some strong opinions about Sarper and Shekinah after listening to the message. She said they were two people with “really severe, like toxic traits” who decided to love each other because they both accepted each other’s toxic traits. In Part 3 of the Tell All, Daniele called out Shekinah for asking other women on set to be reflective when she had not reflected once. Daniele expected Shekinah to admit, “Yeah I f***** up” during her segment.



 Daniele Accused Shekinah Of Buying Instagram Bots To Insult Her 
          

After the Tell All, Daniele shared a live poll on Instagram asking fans about the moment Shekinah told the other cast members about Daniele ignoring her when she tried to say hello to her. “What do you think happened with Shekinah?” she asked her followers and gave them two options to choose from. “I ignored her bc I don’t fw pick me bitches” or “I didn’t hear her say hello.” Most fans believed it was the second option and voted accordingly. Daniele, meanwhile, decided to call out Shekinah in more IG stories later.




Daniele and Yohan’s drama during the Tell All was never-ending as she continued to fish out proof that he was cheating on her and Yohan kept denying it. In the end, Shaun Robinson asked all the cast members to raise their hands if they thought Yohan was a cheater. Shekinah did not raise hers. Daniele took to her stories again to talk about some Instagram accounts coming to her page and commenting things like she shouldn’t have attacked Shekinah. They told Daniele that she was jealous of Shekinah. Daniele visited their profiles and found out they were bot accounts. At first, Daniele thought it was a “network thing.”

She suspected someone was trying to create a fight between her and Shekinah for a new spinoff. Daniele said that when someone pays bots to tweet or comment certain things, it’s usually for a “campaign.” She then happened to see Shekinah responding to one of the bot comments. “Oh this b**** is paying bots,” Daniele said before sharing a screenshot of Shekinah replying to the comment with clapping hands emojis. The comment in question said that Daniele was “miserable” and using “witchcraft” to get what she wanted when Yohgan was “A REAL ONE.” The commentator had praised Shekinah and said Sarper was “HONEST” about his past.




Daniele wrote that after having done three seasons, she could say that “nothing good” had ever come out when a cast member supported the “harassment” of other cast members “ESPECIALLY with bots.” She asked her followers to not “move through” their world like Shekinah had. Daniele said she was someone who had a support system and Shekinah was jealous of her because she didn’t have one.



 Shekinah Said Daniele Secretly Messaged Her Boyfriend Sarper 
          

Shekinah responded to Daniele’s claims by posting her own side of the story. She said she wasn’t going to say anything but Daniele had “poked the tiger.” Shekinah claimed Daniele had messaged her boyfriend before the Tell All to tell him she was “sorry in advance” for anything she might say at the Tell All, but had sent Shekinah no messages at all. “And she calls ME a woman hater?” Shekinah asked. Moreover, Shekinah also claimed Daniele kept asking if there was “anyone with a penis” around who could have helped her with “this or that” while filming the reunion.




She claimed that the amount of times Daniele used the words “penis and vagina” was appalling. Shekinah called Daniele “complete trash” and declared that Daniele “belongs to the streets.”



 Shekinah Claimed Daniele Has A &#34;GIANT Ego.&#34; 
          

A fan reached out to Shekinah to ask her for her honest opinion about Daniele. Shekinah said that Daniele had a “GIANT ego” and was painfully insecure. She accused Daniele of totally lacking in self-awareness and added that while Daniele poses as some “self evolved guru,” she couldn’t be further from it. Shekinah accused Daniele of being a “complete fraud.” Shekinah also called out Daniele for what she said about Shekinah being angry about Daniele having a support system. Shekinah said Daniele knew nothing about her support system, so she didn’t have any right to comment on that. She wrote that she has an “INCREDIBLE” support system of friends and family.




Shekinah added that the people who Daniele thought were bots were “probably trolls.” She explained that she responded to the comment with the clapping hands from her alerts page. Shekinah maintained that she did not even know the comment was posted on Daniele’s account. “The meditating isn’t working, might want to try medicating, Danielle,” she wrote. The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star says she has a sixth sense for seeing right through people and their facades, hence was able to find out that Daniele was “being completely fake” at the Tell All.
