## Literature Review

Whether comedic, devastating, or underhanded, Succession&#39;s Shiv Roy is capable of anything, and this is shown in her best moments of the series. 




As one of the core Roy siblings on Succession, Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) has done her fair share of backstabbing and scheming, but that only contributes to her greatest moments on the show. Shiv is in a tough position as the only daughter of Logan Roy (Brian Cox), who consistently makes her fight for his approval and belittles her. However, despite the harsh treatment she receives, it&#39;s on par with Logan&#39;s treatment of everyone, and Shiv is never afraid to take after her father&#39;s cruelty.
The final season of Succession had many twists and turns for the Roy siblings&#39; path to take over their father&#39;s company, and all the while, Shiv was dealing with her contentious relationship with her husband, Tom (Matthew Macfadyen). Throughout the series, Shiv fights tooth and nail for her father&#39;s respect and shifts her alliances based on who is most likely to support her rise to the top. In her tenure portraying Shiv, Snook has proven herself to be an outstanding performer, up to the task of capturing the character&#39;s subtleties.
            
 
 Succession Ending Explained: Everything That Happened In Season 4 Episode 10 
The Succession season 4 finale is finally out, officially concluding the beloved HBO series. So, here is the ending of Succession explained.












 








 10  Falling Down The Stairs 
Season 4, Episode 4, &#34;Honeymoon States&#34;
        

Any sign of weakness in the Roy family is unforgivable, and falling down the stairs in front of all the major Waystar-Royco players would be considered too vulnerable. Even though her father had just died, Shiv was expected to be completely together and not show any cracks in her facade. This moment is deeply uncomfortable but also made hilarious by Snook&#39;s physicality in the scene. Many fans wondered if the fall was scripted because of how natural and excruciating it looked. However, the tumble was all part of the creator&#39;s plan, and Snook executed it perfectly.





 9  &#34;I&#39;m Shiv F----ing Roy&#34; 
Season 1, Episode 10, &#34;Nobody Is Ever Missing&#34;


 







Part of Shiv&#39;s charm and downfall is her overinflated sense of confidence and belief that she&#39;s always the smartest in the room. By the end of season 1, she had turned on Gil Eavis (Eric Bogosian), the politician she worked for, to curry favor with her dad. In the middle of her wedding, she reveals her scheme to her coworker and lover, Nate (Ashely Zukerman), telling him she can do whatever she wants and will get away with it because she&#39;s &#34;Shiv f----ing Roy.&#34; It&#39;s a second of great achievement for her before it all comes crashing down.
            
 
 Who Is Nate On Succession? Tom/Shiv History &amp; Why He&#39;s Important Now 
Here’s who Nate is in Succession, and why his return in Succession season 4, episode 7, “Tailgate Party” was so important for Tom, Shiv, and Kendall.








 8  Dancing At Kendall&#39;s Birthday 
Season 3, Episode 7, &#34;Too Much Birthday&#34;
        

Another example of Snook&#39;s stellar physical comedy came in season 3, at Kendall&#39;s (Jeremy Strong) birthday party. She and Roman (Kiernan Culkin) attend to stop Kendall from making a deal that would hurt the company, but along the way, the three siblings get into one of their biggest fights of the show. When Shiv finds out that she&#39;s been cut out of a deal between Roman and Logan to get Kendall to cash out of Waystar, she takes to the dance floor to let off some steam.
She&#39;s viciously mocked by her brothers, but her dancing is the perfect amount of awkwardness, and the best way to express what Shiv&#39;s going through at that moment. Even with Kendall out of the picture, her father still doesn&#39;t trust her or see her as a viable option to run the company. Additionally, she&#39;s fed up and disgusted with her marriage and needs to act out her frustration like any disgruntled child.





 7  Brawl With Roman 
Season 1, Episode 2, &#34;S... Show At The F... Factory&#34;
        

The entire series starts with the Roys being brought back together after Logan&#39;s hospitalization. In the second episode of the show, Shiv and Roman have it out and illustrate just how immature they both are. When Roman tries to get her to sign on to Logan&#39;s proposed change to his will that would decrease her power on the board, she refuses and things get ugly. In season 1, Shiv is not as involved in the political machinations of Waystar, but her refusal here indicates how much she secretly wants that power. 
Roman has always been able to push Shiv&#39;s buttons, and she gets so frustrated that she shoves him and the pair start to fight physically. Both Snook and Culkin do an excellent job performing the scene and making it appear as if they&#39;re two small children fighting over a toy. Though there are no winners in such a childish activity, it&#39;s clear that Shiv could&#39;ve taken him out if she wanted to.





 6  Getting Roman To Join Her And Kendall&#39;s Takeover 
Season 3, Episode 9, &#34;All The Bells Say&#34;


 







Before the other shoe drops in the finale of season 3 of Succession it seems for a moment that, for once, the Roy children are going to form a united front and take over the company together. They&#39;ve been estranged for a long time by the end of season 3, but through many revelations, they begin to realize that their father will never respect them, and all they have is each other. This is a hard pill for Shiv to swallow, but she asserts herself as an important player and is instrumental in getting Roman to turn on Logan. 





 5  Logan Telling Her She Could Be CEO 
Season 2, Episode 1, &#34;The Summer Palace&#34;
        

With Kendall&#39;s takeover crushed in the finale of season 1, Logan is looking for a new successor in season 2, and he looks to Shiv. It&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s not serious about what he says to her, and that he&#39;ll never keep his promises, but Shiv can&#39;t help but believe him. She tries to pretend that she isn&#39;t interested, but Logan can tell just how much she wants that power and approval. It&#39;s a masterful delivery from Snook, who can telegraph exactly what Shiv is thinking while simultaneously putting up the front that she&#39;s collected and in control.





 4  Realizing Tom Betrayed Her 
Season 3, Episode 9, &#34;All The Bells Say&#34;
        

There are many shocking moments in Succession season 3, but none more so than the moment when Shiv realizes she&#39;s been betrayed by Tom. After the Roy siblings plan their coup and take it to Logan to stop the Gojo deal, he reveals he&#39;s already one step ahead of them, and they&#39;ve been cut out of the business. Shiv and her brothers are floored with no idea who could&#39;ve leaked the information to Logan so quickly.
In the instant when Shiv sees that Tom has sided with Logan instead of her, it&#39;s a crushing blow. Her feelings in this scene set her on the course of the events of the rest of the series. Tom and Shiv have never had the smoothest or most loving relationship, but Shiv always assumed she was safe with him. This moment makes her realize that he has as much power to hurt her as her father, and she hates him for that.





 3  Refusing To Make Kendall CEO 
Season 4, Episode 10, &#34;With Open Eyes&#34;
        

Why Shiv voted against Kendall in the Succession finale seemed like a mystery when it first happened during the board meeting, but her move was brewing all along. The Roy siblings can&#39;t stand to see any of the others have the power, and therefore their father&#39;s approval, even if it comes at the cost of the family legacy. Even though her future is uncertain, and not what she wants, Shiv takes whatever control she has to stand up to Kendall and assert her last shred of dignity.





 2  Finding Out Logan Is Dead 
Season 4, Episode 3, &#34;Connor&#39;s Wedding&#34;


 







Logan dying within the first few episodes of season 4 was a shock to viewers as well as to the Roys. Shiv and her brothers are estranged from their father at this point and aren&#39;t with him when he dies. They say goodbye through the phone, trying to put their complicated relationships into words one last time. It&#39;s Shiv&#39;s words that stand out the most in the fantastic episode because of how quickly she unravels and reverts to the child she once was. It&#39;s a humanizing episode for all the siblings, but Shiv&#39;s last moments with her father are devastating.





 1  Fighting With Tom 
Season 4, Episode 8, &#34;Tailgate Party&#34;
        

In the wake of Logan&#39;s death in Succession, each sibling attempts to pick up the pieces of their lives. Shiv and Tom take up the mantle of Logan&#39;s traditional tailgate party, hosting it at their home on a night that quickly turns into a disaster. Neither has forgiven the other for all the awful things that have been done and said, which comes to a head when they have an explosive fight on the balcony outside the party. Snook and Macfadyen play off each other beautifully and easily, making the audience believe they mean every cutting word they say.
