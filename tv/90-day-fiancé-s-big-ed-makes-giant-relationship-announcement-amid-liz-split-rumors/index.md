Big Ed stopped himself before he could spill more details about his new love interest, but he did describe it as his “favorite moment.” He said that he was connecting with fans from countries such as Canada, Australia, and Germany, and was amazed at the “reach” of the international platform. The fifth edition of the annual Bigo Awards Gala was held in Las Vegas on January 16, 2024, when Big Ed made this shocking revelation.

Big Ed proposed to Liz for the “very last time.” They were going to get married in Arkansas in August 2023. He said he was lucky to have found a “beautiful catch” like Liz. He claimed she made him want to strive to be a better man. Liz was glad there had been effective growth in their communication and trust when they attended the retreat.
