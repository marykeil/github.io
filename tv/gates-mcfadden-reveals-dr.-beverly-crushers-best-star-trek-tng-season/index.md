# Gates McFadden Reveals Dr. Beverly Crushers Best Star Trek TNG Season


## SUMMARY 



  Gates McFadden believes her best season as Dr. Beverly Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation was the last season.   McFadden enjoyed directing the episode &#34;Genesis&#34; and thought the series finale, &#34;All Good Things,&#34; was great.   She liked the storyline of Crusher and Picard being married and divorced, and Star Trek: Picard season 3 delivered some of those stories in a new way.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s Dr. Beverly Crusher had one TNG season where she shined the most according to Gates McFadden.




Gates McFadden reveals which season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was the best for Dr. Beverly Crusher. One of the central characters of TNG, McFadden is beloved as the USS Enterprise-D&#39;s Chief Medical Officer. McFadden&#39;s early TNG tenure was tumultuous; the actress was fired from Star Trek: The Next Generation season 2 but came back for season 3. Since then, McFadden played Dr. Crusher in TNG seasons 3 to 7 and in the four Star Trek: The Next Generation feature films before Gates reprised Beverly in Star Trek: Picard season 3.




Gates McFadden hasn&#39;t always been pleased with how Star Trek: The Next Generation utilized Dr. Beverly Crusher, but the actress says her time on TNG ended &#34;on a positive note&#34; as Gates chooses which TNG season utilized Beverly best. In addition, McFadden got to direct an episode of TNG, and she enjoyed Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s series finale, &#34;All Good Things...&#34; Read McFadden&#39;s quote in the Star Trek oral history, &#34;The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years&#34; by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, below:


This last season was my best season, which was nice to end on a positive note. The high point was directing “Genesis,” but “All Good Things” was great. Jeri Taylor was always in agreement that we should do more with Crusher and Picard and pick up that thread. I liked that they were married and divorced. I thought I should have his fish in my ready room skewered or the Shakespeare text ripped in the settlement.





                  Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast &amp; Character Guide   Star Trek: The Next Generation has one of the most beloved cast of characters in all of science fiction. Here are the major characters of the classic.    


 Star Trek: Picard Season 3 Delivered The Best Dr. Beverly Crusher 
Picard did the Crusher storylines that TNG didn&#39;t.
         

Star Trek: Picard season 3 brought back Dr. Beverly Crusher after 21 years since Star Trek: Nemesis, and working with Picard season 3 showrunner Terry Matalas, Gates McFadden was able to bring the version of Beverly she always wanted to see to the screen. Just as McFadden enjoyed how Dr. Crusher and Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) were married and divorced in the alternate future of Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s series finale, Star Trek: Picard season 3 did its canonical version of it: Beverly never married Picard, but she secretly raised his son, Jack Crusher (Ed Speleers).




In addition, Gates McFadden and Terry Matalas revamped Dr. Crusher into a more resourceful, independent character who raised Jack in the dangerous and forgotten parts of the United Federation of Planets. The Beverly who returned in Star Trek: Picard season 3 remains an unmatched physician, but she also now knows her way around a starship&#39;s weapons systems and is formidable with a phaser. The aspects Gates McFadden most enjoyed about Dr. Beverly Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation season 7 were taken to the next level in Star Trek: Picard season 3. Hopefully, McFadden will be able to continue as the new and improved Dr. Crusher if Picard&#39;s proposed spinoff dubbed Star Trek: Legacy gets made.



Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Picard are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
