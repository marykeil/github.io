  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The couples of 90 Day Fiancé season 10 were looking for love outside of their countries. While they found it, some relationships had huge red flags.</p>
<p>Since its premiere in October 2023, several 90 Day Fiancé season 10 couples have exhibited massive red flags. The show introduced six new couples and one returning duo as they took a leap of faith to navigate the cultural differences and convince their family and friends that their partners are in for the long haul. This season&rsquo;s couples have had major problems ranging from personal conflicts to finances and communication issues.</p>
<p>As some 90 Day Fiancé season 10 couples planned their future, others faced difficulties in their relationships. Many couples questioned whether the journey was worth it, with some separating before the 90 days were over. On more than one occasion, every cast member on the show has presented their dark side as an individual or as a couple.</p>
<pre><code>              20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?   
</code></pre>
<p>Jasmine And Gino
Are Toxic Together</p>
<p>Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo made their TV debut on 90 Day Fiancé Before The 90 Days season 5, offering the viewers major drama. Gino, from Michigan native, met his Panamanian fiancé Jasmine in 2019 on a sugar baby dating site, and they seemed to hit it off at first before things went downhill. Jasmine and Gino&rsquo;s issues resulted from Jasmine&rsquo;s jealousy, but Gino also had a part to play in the drama. The couple once got into an explosive fight during their vacation after Jasmine learned Gino sent her nude pictures to his ex-girlfriend, which Jasmine later revealed cost her job.</p>
<p>Jasmine forgave Gino&rsquo;s indiscretions, but their problems continued after she arrived in the U.S. Their storyline in the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 has had many ups and downs. Jasmine found out Gino quit his job, a secret he&rsquo;d kept from her, which made Jasmine worry that her two children might never get a chance to join them in the U.S. The couple also had a heated argument after Gino found out that Jasmine spent over $10,000 on butt implants, money that was supposed to be for her wedding dress.</p>
<p>Jasmine and Gino have seemingly split. Their relationship has been on a downward spiral, as the couple couldn&rsquo;t sort out their differences. Despite these rumors, Jasmine embraced 2024 by setting goals for herself and has a new vegan brand. Gino recently shared sentimental photos of the two, and he might probably be hoping for another chance with Jasmine.</p>
<p>Nikki And Justin
Nikki Is Too Hot To Handle</p>
<p>Nikki Exotica and her Moldovan boyfriend, Igor Shutencov, AKA Justin, met 17 years ago on a Moldovan dating site. They dated and broke up, only to get back together decades later. Their relationship suffered many hardships, with one of their splits linked to Nikki&rsquo;s revelation that she is transgender, resulting in Justin leaving her. The couple have reunited and want to get married but faced many hurdles, including Justin&rsquo;s depression after their first split.</p>
<p>Nikki learned Justin hooked up with several women before their engagement. The 90 Day Fiancé cast member was heartbroken and indicated she wasn&rsquo;t ready to compromise after Justin defended his actions, claiming they weren&rsquo;t engaged. Nikki is a trans woman, and the couple struggled over intimacy issues. Justin stated he wasn&rsquo;t ready to get intimate with her yet and needed to connect with Nikki&rsquo;s soul first.</p>
<p>Nikki felt Justin wanted to buy time and even threatened to leave him, which would be the last time he would see her. She felt rejected by Justin, who expressed that their relationship was built beyond the physical aspect (Via 90 Day Fiancé). Justin and Nikki&rsquo;s relationship seems to have ended with Justin rubbing his happiness on Nikki&rsquo;s face on Instagram, leaving proof that he&rsquo;s single now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our relationship built not on the physical. It&rsquo;s more like a soul, like heart, like something, different vibes. And when we&rsquo;re talking physically, I need a little time with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashley And Manuel
Ashley Is Delusional</p>
<p>Ashley Michelle and Manuel Vëlez had been on and off again for over seven years before they decided to give their relationship a try on 90 Day Fiancé. The couple had problems from the start with Ashley&rsquo;s career in witchcraft, something she hid from Manuel. Ashley states she didn&rsquo;t want to reveal that part to Manuel as he came from a religious background. Manuel didn&rsquo;t tell his family he was relocating to the U.S. to marry Ashley, proving there were a lot of trust issues between them. They even fought when Ashley picked Manuel up from the airport, and their issues have only piled up.</p>
<p>There are many red flags in this 90 Day Fiancé couple, making it difficult to ignore how toxic their relationship is. Ashley has proven time and time again that her ability to read people and intuition isn&rsquo;t that great, and cannot see Manuel is in for the Green Card. Ashley and Manuel argued about finances, religion, children, and other important topics. Manuel showed controlling tendencies when he got mad that Ashley spent money on herself and her pets instead of sending it to his family. The couple argued and made up unconventionally, as shown recently in a 90 Day Fiancé episode.</p>
<p>Ashley and Manuel had a confrontation about money but ended up becoming intimate in a public bathroom, bringing up criticism from the viewers. Ashley is delusional for someone so spiritual, as she can&rsquo;t feel Manuel&rsquo;s energy is off. Ashley still made some memories with Manuel, like their visit to Niagara Falls, which was a big surprise for him. In a recent episode, Ashley seemed so insecure with Manuel that she held a joint bachelor/bachelorette party. Ashley and Manuel got married, but there are signs that their union won&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>Anali And Clayton
Clayton&rsquo;s Mom Is A Barrier</p>
<p>One of the biggest red flags in Clayton Clark and Anali Vallejos is Clayton&rsquo;s living situation. He lives with his mom, who lives in the closet, two chihuahuas and two guinea pigs, and Anali in a one-bedroom apartment. During a recent episode of 90 Day Fiancé, Brandi, Clayton&rsquo;s sister, dropped a bombshell on Anali during the bachelor party. She claimed Clayton and their mom, Violet, have always lived together, and that situation is bound to remain that way for a long time, even after the wedding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clayton and my mom have always lived together. It&rsquo;s actually, like, disturbing. Like, they will not leave each other&rsquo;s side. So, mark my words, check back in a year. They will still be living together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violet is the biggest setback to Anali and Clayton&rsquo;s relationship with Anali, expressing her doubts about whether she&rsquo;d get married. Notably, like Manuel, Anali hadn&rsquo;t told her dad about Clayton, casting more doubt on whether they would walk down the aisle. The couple&rsquo;s challenges have been based on the situations they found themselves in rather than personalities. Anali found it difficult to have intimate moments with Clayton&rsquo;s mom around, creating more issues between the couple.</p>
<p>Citra And Sam
Too Many Differences</p>
<p>Sam Wilson and Citra have been in the spotlight since 90 Day Fiancé season 10 started airing. Their problems involved long-distance and religious differences, as Sam had to convert to Islam if he wished to marry Citra. Sam&rsquo;s mom was against the conversion and stated she wouldn&rsquo;t be part of the ceremony if Sam converted. Citra hails from Indonesia and moved to the U.S. with her father.</p>
<p>Sam was worried if Citra&rsquo;s father would approve of their relationship due to Sam&rsquo;s secret criminal past. What Citra wasn&rsquo;t prepared for was the supposed jail time Sam was facing after he failed to appear for his court-ordered drug diversion program. Citra and Sam&rsquo;s parents doubted their nuptials, causing more uncertainties for them.</p>
<p>Devin And Nick
The Hurtful &ldquo;Piggy&rdquo; Comment</p>
<p>Devin Hoofman and Nick Ham might seem like the most unproblematic couple on 90 Day Fiancé season 10, but they aren&rsquo;t. Nick had made hurtful comments towards Devin due to her weight, calling her &ldquo;piggy&rdquo; in front of her family members (via 90 Day Fiancé). Devin&rsquo;s parents weren&rsquo;t thrilled by his phrase, to which Nick stated that in Korean culture, the &ldquo;piggy&rdquo; name was a compliment, and there was nothing mean-spirited behind the nickname. What was more heartbreaking and disturbing about the comment was seeing Devin break down while trying on the wedding dress, stating she didn&rsquo;t want her arms out, showing how much the statement affected her mental health.</p>
<p>Sophie And Rob
They Grew Up Differently</p>
<p>Rob Warne and Sophie Sierra connected on Instagram after she saw him on a page dedicated to mixed-race men before sliding into his DM&rsquo;s. Although their physical attraction was immediate, their different upbringing was a major issue. Rob comes from a humble background, whereas Sophie enjoys the finer things in life. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why Rob thought that Sophie asking for a duvet was &ldquo;bougie.&rdquo; Their social class wasn&rsquo;t the only problem, as Rob allegedly cheated on Sophie and has, over time, proved to be a walking red flag.</p>
<p>The couple hit a major roadblock after Sophie revealed she wasn&rsquo;t sure if she wanted kids, whereas Rob did. While still in a relationship with Rob, Sophie was also on a dating site and claimed she was looking for overseas friends. Later, Sophie told Rob she was bisexual, and he had mixed feelings about it, wondering how their relationship would end up.</p>
<p>In the recent episode, Sophie came out to her mom, who believes Sophie is confused about what she wants from her relationship with Rob. The 90 Day Fiancé couple handled tremendous issues throughout the season and seem to have broken up. However, there are some signs that Rob and Sophie might still be growing strong.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
