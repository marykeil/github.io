## Literature Review
2023 was a messy year for many couples in the extended 90 Day Fiancé franchise, as both staple couples and new pairs split with a lot of drama.




The 90 Day Fiancé franchise aired plenty of couples&#39; splits in 2023, but there were also many break-ups that were not shown to viewers during the different shows. This led to a number of 90 Day Fiancé franchise cast members breaking up quietly in 2023, while others parted ways with more drama. Meanwhile, some couples split and got back together, and other relationships are currently plagued with rumors.
90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Daysseason 6 and seasons 4 and 5 of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way saw numerous couples splitting on camera in 2023. These occurred with a lot of air time and on-screen vulnerability from the cast. Between the way things worked out on-screen and in subsequent Tell Alls, viewers got to get to the bottom of most of these breakups. However, other 90 Day Fiancé franchise break-ups occurred off-camera and weren’t as publicized to viewers.

 8  Molly Hopkins &amp; Kelly Brown 
        

90 Day: The Single Life couple Molly Hopkins and Kelly Brown split at the start of the year. This was a rather messy franchise breakup, as both Kelly and Molly blasted each other on social media. Kelly accused Molly’s daughter, Olivia Hopkins, of mistreating him, while he teamed up with Molly’s former best friend, Cynthia Decker, to call Molly out. Around this time, fans began to realize that Molly was a far more problematic franchise villain, as opposed to a beloved cast member. Molly and Kelly appeared on 90 Day: The Last Resort even though their split was announced months before the show aired.





 7  Kalani Faagata &amp; Asuelu Pulaa 
        

Franchise couple Kalani Faagata and Asuelu Pulaa are another 90 Day: The Last Resort pair who called it quits before the show aired. In fact, the couple was rumored to have split at the end of 2022, though they kept their fans guessing with cryptic Instagram posts. It was then revealed that Asuelu cheated on Kalani. Once she was given a “hall pass” to also step out on the marriage, she didn’t want to go back to her husband. Kalani is now happy with her younger boyfriend, Dallas Nuez.





 6  Ella Johnson &amp; Johnny Chao 


 







90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 5 couple Ella Johnson and Johnny Chao actually stayed together after their season even though Ella was revealed to have cheated on Johnny. As fans might remember, Johnny did not make it to the US due to strict COVID-19 regulations in his home country of China. This led to Ella cheating on him because she said she needed physical touch.
In the winter of 2023, the couple shared that they ended up breaking up due to how difficult their separation was. However, they told their followers in the summer of 2023 that Johnny had finally been able to go to the US and visit Ella. Therefore, exes Johnny and Ella might have rekindled something after all.





 5  Christian Allgood &amp; Cleo Corraine 
        

90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 6 newcomers Christian Allgood and Cleo Corraine surprisingly stayed together throughout their season and even affirmed that they wanted to be together at the Tell All. This was rather surprising, as Christian consistently made Cleo feel uncomfortable by hitting on other women. However, she stood by him. However, the duo split not long after the Tell All aired. Christian and Cleo shared that a long-distance relationship in the public eye was too hard. This led to the exes parting ways rather than working towards marriage. However, Christian and Cleo recently reconciled at the end of 2023.





 4  Lidia Morel &amp; Scott Wern 
        

Love in Paradise chaotic couple Lidia Morel and Scott Wern ended things for good during The Family Chantel season 5. Lidia and Scott had a messy and seemingly exaggerated relationship that got them both camera time. Pedro Jimeno made it clear that he loathed his mother’s boyfriend, which led to the two men getting into a physical fight on camera. Scott originally said he wanted to get with Lidia just to anger Pedro and his sister Nicole Jimeno. However, Lidia and Scott called things off by the end of the short-lived season.





 3  Jibri &amp; Miona Bell 
        

90 Day Fiancé season 9 couple Jibri and Miona Bell are rumored to be done for good after Miona went ahead and archived all of their photos. Before this, the duo enjoyed posting about their romance on social media. However, Miona has since bragged that she likes rich men after Jibri was clearly struggling with finances while living with his parents. It is unclear if Miona and Jibri are getting divorced, though they don’t currently seem to be together. Therefore, it is possible that Miona used Jibri after all to get to the United States and start a new life.





 2  Holly Weeks &amp; Wayne Cornish 


 







90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 couple Holly Weeks and Wayne Cornish had an unhealthy and unstable romance. At the recent Tell All, they agreed to make things work, even though they hadn’t seen each other for four months. Holly had left South Africa and returned to the United States after she made it clear she hated her new life. Meanwhile, Wayne said from the start that he would never live in the United States. However, after a tense discussion, they shared that they loved each other. It is currently unclear if Holly made good on her promise and returned to South Africa to make her marriage work.





 1  Big Ed Brown &amp; Liz Woods 


90 Day Fiancé franchise villain Big Ed Brown recently addressed divorce rumors and confirmed that he is still with Liz Woods. The couple, who most recently appeared on 90 Day: The Last Resort, have broken up around a dozen times already. After fans spotted Liz out with what seemed like other men and without a wedding ring, they rumored that she was now single. However, Big Ed said that he is still happily married. This is unfortunate, as many viewers want Liz to get away from the controlling older man and franchise villain who appears to make her perpetually miserable.
90 Day: The Single Life Premieres Monday, January 1, 2024, at 8 p.m. ET On TLC
