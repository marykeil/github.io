## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean&#39;s Captain Sandy refuses to let deck team member Max Salvador leave the yacht amid crew drama and his intention to leave. 




Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 cast member Max Salvador wants to quit the boat amid crew turmoil, but Captain Sandy Yawn is refusing to let him go. Max came onto Motoryacht Mustique during episode three after Luka Brunson stepped into the bosun role, and the deck team was down a member. Max, from France, got off to a rough start because of his language barrier and his work ethic not being up to his teammates&#39; standards. However, this season turned around after Luka and lead deckhand Lara Du Preez changed their critical managerial styles and started showering Max with praise, and his defiant attitude quickly turned into a hardworking one.




Unfortunately, the boat dynamics among the other crew members have not improved and have been affecting Max. Max runs into Sandy out on deck in a preview clip of next week&#39;s episode from Bravo TV. She pays him a compliment, saying, &#34;You&#39;re funny Max,&#34; after they had a morning hello exchange. Max appreciated the sentiment but brought up to Sandy that he wanted to leave the boat because he wasn&#39;t feeling like himself. A shocked Captain Sandy quips, &#34;What?&#34; before reiterating, &#34;You&#39;re going to leave?&#34; Max says he is. Captain Sandy responded by saying &#34;No&#34; with a disappointed and direct tone.


 Why Does Max Salvador Want To Quit Below Deck Med? 
          

Max brought up wanting to leave the boat to Captain Sandy because his mental health has been suffering due to all the drama among the crew. Max had gotten a verbal bashing from stew Kyle Viljoen for saying he was part of the LGBT&#43; community when he really meant he was an ally. On top of that, Max bore witness to Kyle coming for stew Natalya Scudder after she inserted herself into the argument. Kyle said nasty and below-the-belt things to Natalya, which ultimately caused her to leave the boat. The volatility of the entire situation really got under Max&#39;s skin, and he separated himself from the crew the following day when they were all off.




The drama seems to have deeply affected Max to the point where he feels like he can&#39;t even function on the boat anymore. It is a shame that his feelings have gotten to this point because he was becoming, if not already was, a beloved member of the crew since his castmates started to understand him better, and he was thriving in his role.

Captain Sandy and Max&#39;s talk happened fresh on the heels of Natalya leaving and Sandy having an uncomfortable talk with Kyle with an unknown outcome. Given all the drama that went down, it remains to be seen if Captain Sandy can convince Max to change his mind and remain on the boat. With four charters left, losing Max would be a detriment to the season and the spirit of the Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 yacht crew.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays on Bravo at 8 p.m. EST.
