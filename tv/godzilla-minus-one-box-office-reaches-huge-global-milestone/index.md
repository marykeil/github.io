## Literature Review

The Godzilla Minus One box office reaches a huge global milestone, continuing to set records as the biggest Japanese-language Godzilla ​​​​​​​movie.




The Godzilla Minus One box office reaches a huge global milestone. From Takashi Yamazaki, the latest film in the franchise produced by Toho Studios follows the emergence of the titular kaiju in postwar Japan, with the Godzilla Minus One cast including Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Sakura Ando, and Kuranosuke Sasaki. The film was released in Japan on November 3, and then on December 1 in North America, and has been a resounding box office success both domestically and internationally, becoming the biggest Godzilla movie in Toho Studios history.




Now, the Godzilla Minus One box office has reached a major global milestone. According to Collider, the movie has surpassed the $100 million mark worldwide. Godzilla Minus One also recently announced a rerelease in black and white, though it won&#39;t need it to top the $100 million threshold.

 Every Box Office Record Broken By Godzilla Minus One 
          

By reaching the $100 million mark worldwide, this will only add to the list of box office records broken by Godzilla Minus One. The previous weekend, the movie crossed the $50 million mark at the domestic box office (the first foreign-language film to do so since Bong Joon Ho&#39;s Parasite in 2019) and became the highest-grossing Japanese-language live-action film to ever be released in North America. It is also the fifth highest-grossing foreign-language release of all time domestically.




Godzilla Minus One had already overtaken Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth to become the sixth-biggest live-action foreign-language film of all time domestically. The movie also managed to make history with the most successful domestic debut for a Japanese live-action film, grossing $11.4 million and finishing third at the box office in its opening weekend. What makes Godzilla Minus One&#39;s box office success even more impressive is that it was made for only $15 million, but still manages to deliver terrific special effects.



Godzilla Minus One is playing in theaters.
