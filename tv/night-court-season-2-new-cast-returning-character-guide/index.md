## Literature Review
The Night Court season 2 cast sees the return of series leads Melissa Rauch and John Larroquette, as well as familiar faces from the original series.




The reboot of the classic sitcom Night Court is back for season 2, and the cast features returning actors like Melissa Rauch, as well as familiar faces from the original series like John Larroquette. Like its predecessor, the Night Court revival revolves around the hectic night shift at the Manhattan Criminal Court. Rauch stars in the Night Court reboot as Abby Stone, the daughter of the late Harry Stone (an iconic character from the original series), alongside Larroquette reprising his role as Dan Fielding and fresh faces like Lacretta and India de Beaufort playing new characters created specifically for the reboot.




The Night Court season 2 cast has seen some major changes from season 1. While most of the beloved characters in the main cast are back for the second season, Kapil Talwalkar is missing. In season 1, Talwalkar played Neil, a clerk with a crush on Abby. But in season 2, he’s nowhere to be seen. In his place, season 2 has brought back another fan-favorite icon from the original Night Court series. The season has also seen the arrival of high-profile guest stars like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Maria Bamford. The Night Court season 2 cast is full of great actors.

                  What Roz&#39;s Return Means For Night Court Reboot Season 2   Marsha Warfield returned as Roz Russell in the first season finale of the Night Court reboot, raising the question of what this means for Season 2.

Larroquette received four consecutive Emmy wins for the original series.
