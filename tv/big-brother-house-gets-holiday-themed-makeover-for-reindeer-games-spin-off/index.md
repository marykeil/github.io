Big Brother Reindeer Games, the holiday spin-off series from the Big Brother team, is bringing some holiday cheer and giving viewers a sneak peek into the newly decorated BB house. While Big Brother 25 was the longest season of the competition series to date, the brand-new holiday series Big Brother Reindeer Games will only run for a total of six episodes over two weeks in December. Inviting back competitors from past seasons to compete in the Reindeer Games, the series will see a group of fan-favorite players taking the chance to participate in several classic BB competitions along with some new creations from the Big Brother team.




In an exclusive, Big Brother Reindeer Games shared the newly decorated BB house, themed for the winter holidays and complete with some brand-new areas for the competitors to strategize. While the Big Brother Reindeer Games competitors won&#39;t live in the BB house for the duration of the competition, they&#39;ll still be able to access the house as they compete. According to ET Online, the Big Brother house &#34;has been entirely redesigned for the special, with the Head of Household bedroom remade into Santa&#39;s Office, and the house&#39;s spacious kitchen remade into Mrs. Claus&#39; Bakery&#34; along with several other new areas.

While the cast for Big Brother Reindeer Games has yet to be released, there&#39;s some new information about what&#39;s coming for the new series. According to ET Online, &#34;fans will be treated to special areas including The Candy Cane Forest, Santa&#39;s Village and Santa&#39;s Workshop&#34; while the competitions entertain. The series, comprised of six unique episodes, &#34;will feature three face-off challenges before a final &#34;Santa&#39;s Showdown&#34; that will determine who goes home.&#34; While the competitors from the cast haven&#39;t been named, the &#34;elves&#34; who will host competitions have been shared. BB 11 winner Jordan Lloyd along with BB 23&#39;s Tiffany Mitchell and Derek Xiao will be featured on the series.


 

Big Brother Reindeer Games isn&#39;t the first BB spin-off, but it&#39;s the first of its nature in many years. While Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother have similar foundations to their game, Big Brother Reindeer Games is changing the style and format of the game completely by removing the social element entirely. Though there will likely be some strategizing from the competitors, the majority of the game will be based on the competitions being played. The winner of Big Brother Reindeer Games will win a grand prize of $100,000 for their efforts, making the competition a lucrative one.




While Big Brother Reindeer Games is certain to feature some fan favorites, the cast is the one piece that fans are missing about the upcoming series. It was revealed during the Big Brother 25 finale that one of the cast members from the most recent season would be competing against past BB players for the grand prize. With several Big Brother Reindeer Games episodes to entertain fans during the busy holiday season, it&#39;ll be interesting to see who makes it onto the cast and who makes it through the competition.
