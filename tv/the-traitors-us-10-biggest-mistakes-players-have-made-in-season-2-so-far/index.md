# The Traitors US 10 Biggest Mistakes Players Have Made In Season 2 So Far


## SUMMARY 


 Larsa accused Parvati of being a traitor, which turned out to be true, but she was still faithful at the time. Larsa&#39;s accusation was loud and may have been premature. 
 Trishelle accused Peppermint without any basis, creating unnecessary enemies. Her accusation was blown out of proportion and caused division among the faithful. 
 Peppermint accidentally referred to herself as a traitor, leading to suspicion and her eventual elimination. The cast didn&#39;t give her a fair chance to defend herself.

## Literature Review
The Traitors US season 2 has dropped its first three episodes, but not every contestant is making smart moves. What are the biggest mistakes so far?




The Traitors US season 2 dropped, but players on one of the best reality TV shows have already made mistakes. Based on The Traitors UK, twenty celebrities from TV shows such as The Challenge, Survivor, and Big Brother gather in a game of deception and cunning. A hidden group of traitors lurks among the faithfuls, their mission to manipulate and eliminate the loyal members, all while vying for a cash prize.
Hosted by Alan Cumming, The Traitors US season 2 has plunged contestants into a world of suspicion, deception, and cutthroat strategizing. As each day unfolds, the lines between friend and foe blur, and alliances are forged and shattered with the blink of an eye. While the UK version casts ordinary people, familiar celebrities appear in the US version, adding a new layer of intrigue to the spinoff. However, some pretty intense mistakes are made, and alliances are forged and shattered in the first three episodes of The Traitors US season 2 cast.









 








 1  Larsa Immediately Accusing Parvati On The Traitors US 


 












 2   
Larsa Pippen came out the gate hot, immediately accusing Parvati Shallow of being a traitor. While this eventually became true, she was still faithful at the time of Larsa&#39;s accusations. It&#39;s a difficult balance to strike as faithful to accuse while also listening, and Larsa&#39;s voice might be a bit too loud-- until she became right about Dan.





 3  Trishelle Making An Enemy Of Peppermint On The Traitors US 


 












 4   
Trishelle Cannatella&#39;s accusation of Peppermint was entirely blown out of proportion, and creating enemies immediately isn&#39;t the best idea on The Traitors. She had relatively little to go off of, basically saying if Trishelle was eliminated, Peppermint was a traitor. There was no basis for this accusation, but she still managed to rally some troops around an undeserving faithful.





 5  Finding John&#39;s Reaction To Traitor Selection Suspicious 
        






 6   
When Alan tapped his initial two traitors, John Bercow allegedly was breathing irregularly. When confronted about it, he responded that he had asthma. However, in a subsequent challenge, he seemed to be able to run and didn&#39;t have an inhaler on him, which is bizarre for someone who may need that medical assistance at any moment. John was a distraction from the actual traitors and wasn&#39;t worth the faithfuls&#39; fixation.





 7  Peppermint Accidentally Saying She&#39;s A Traitor 
        

Peppermint didn&#39;t deserve the treatment she received from the cast. While her reaction to Trishelle&#39;s accusations was dramatic, she just wanted to defend herself. Unfortunately, the nail in the coffin was Peppermint, accidentally referring to herself as a traitor. She immediately backed up and retracted the statement, but it was too late since she was already suspicious. The faithful were set to eliminate an innocent contestant.





 8  Eliminating Peppermint On The Traitors US 
        






 9   
Eliminating Peppermint was a colossal mistake. She was popular, outspoken, and a good judge of character. There&#39;s a decent chance she could have figured out the traitors, and she was a solid faithful to eliminate. It was unwise for the fellow faithful to eradicate a strong player. While many other strong faithful like Larsa remain, she was a big win for the traitors.





 10  Dan Being Too Quiet On The Traitors 


 












 11   
Dan Gheesling is currently the weakest link of the traitors. At the same time, a fantastic player on Big Brother, Dan, is missing the mark on The Traitors US. Everyone noticed he was a little too quiet, never giving his genuine opinion. He&#39;s not accurately balancing offering information and listening to others, making him seem suspicious. Dan needs to switch up his gameplay if the traitors want to survive.





 12  Eliminating Marcus On The Traitors US 
        






 13   
Marcus Johnson was undoubtedly a strong player, but eliminating him may have been a bad idea because it activated Larsa&#39;s rage. Marcus&#39; elimination angered the housewives, who began a vendetta against the traitors. She already had suspicions regarding Dan, but she&#39;s on high alert to get retribution for Marcus&#39; elimination.





 14  Allowing Parvati To Poison A Chalice On The Traitors US 
        






 15   
Parvati is acting far too evident in her chalice poisoning. While Phaedra is wise to let the other two traitors do the dirty work and Dan is under suspicion, Parvati is acting super sketchy in her attempts to poison one of the chalices. While it&#39;s unclear how the challenge pans out, she may have been the worst choice, especially considering Sandra&#39;s watchful eye.





 16  Letting Dan Off The Hook On The Traitors US 
        

The faithfuls were so close to holding Dan accountable for his affiliation on The Traitors US season 2. While Dan has done little to remedy his suspicious nature, he wasn&#39;t voted out in the second round table. Larsa isn&#39;t likely to continue to let Dan off the hook, so he needs to switch up his gameplay in the next episodes of The Traitors US. 
The Traitors US airs new episodes on Thursdays on Peacock.
