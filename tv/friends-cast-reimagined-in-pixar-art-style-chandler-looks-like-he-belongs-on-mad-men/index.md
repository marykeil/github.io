## Literature Review
The Friends cast gets reimagined in Pixar&#39;s signature animation style, and the late Matthew Perry&#39;s Chandler Bing looks like he belongs on Mad Men.




The Friends cast gets reimagined in Pixar-style art, and Chandler Bing looks like he belongs on Mad Men. Aired from 1994 to 2004, the iconic sitcom famously follows the personal and professional lives of six friends – Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica (Courteney Cox), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), Chandler (Matthew Perry), and Ross (David Schwimmer) – living in New York City. Perry passed away this past October at the age of 54, and fans have recently been revisiting Friends on streaming in honor of the late actor.




Now, new art shared by friends_lover20 on Instagram reimagines the Friends cast in Pixar&#39;s signature animation style, and Chandler looks like he belongs instead in the acclaimed AMC advertising drama, Mad Men, bearing a striking resemblance to Don Draper (Jon Hamm). Check out the art below:


 

Ross, a PhD-carrying paleontologist, appears to be reimagined as a dinosaur doctor, and Joey, a food lover, is pictured with an elaborate meatball sandwich. Monica, a chef, is seen in full whites, while Chandler, who works as an executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large corporation, looks like he belongs on Madison Avenue, which is actually where he ends up in Friends season 9, becoming a junior copywriter at an advertising agency.

                  The 15 Best Episodes Of Friends Ever   The show spoils for choice, but from &#34;The One Where Everybody Finds Out&#34; to &#34;The Last One: Part Two,&#34; these Friends episodes are the best of all time.    





 Would Friends Work As A Pixar Movie? 
          

Friends, as hinted at by the art above, would translate rather seamlessly to a Pixar movie. The hypothetical project could retain the essence of the original characters and their relationships while only requiring some minor creative adjustments. The adaptation could maintain the quirks and humor that made Friends so beloved, though each animated character&#39;s traits would be exaggerated in line with Pixar&#39;s signature style, which would only add to the comedic effect and charm. The romantic storylines, especially Ross and Rachel&#39;s relationship, could be translated into endearing moments in animation and add to the overall emotional depth of the narrative.

Most importantly, Friends as a Pixar movie could maintain its core theme – the unbreakable bond between the characters. One aspect of the live-action Friends that would require the most adjustment is its setting. In Pixar&#39;s signature style, an animated New York City would be less true to life, and instead, become a delightful blend of realism and whimsy, while still capturing the spirit of the original sitcom. All in all, Friends as a Pixar movie would introduce a new level of visual creativity while maintaining its humor, charm, and emotional resonance.






Friends seasons 1-10 are streaming on Max.
