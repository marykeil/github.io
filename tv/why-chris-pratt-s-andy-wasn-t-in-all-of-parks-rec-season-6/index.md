# Why Chris Pratt s Andy Wasn t In All Of Parks &amp; Rec Season 6


## SUMMARY 



  Andy Dwyer&#39;s absence in Parks and Rec season 6 is due to Chris Pratt&#39;s commitment to filming Guardians of the Galaxy.   Parks and Rec cleverly explained Andy&#39;s absence by sending him to London with Ben and Leslie for a charity expansion.   Chris Pratt never intended to leave Parks and Rec, as he considered it his success story and was dedicated to the show.

## Literature Review
Chris Pratt stars in Parks and Rec as Andy Dwyer, the loveable goofball shoeshine. But he&#39;s gone for most of season 6; what happened to him?




Andy Dwyer, played by Chris Pratt in Parks and Rec, seemed to disappear for most of the hit mockumentary series sixth season. Filmed in the same documentary style as The Office, Parks and Rec manages to poke fun at small-town politics and government yet salute the people who participate in it simultaneously, and is widely considered one of the best sitcoms of all time. One of the many reasons for its success and acclaim is its talented cast of actors who are both loveable and incredibly funny. Every single member of the Parks Department of Pawnee, Indiana brings something to the comedy table.




Andy Dwyer is in the running for Parks and Rec&#39;s funniest character. Since his first appearance in the pilot episode, sitting on Anne Perkins&#39; (Rashida Jones) couch with two broken legs, to his final scene in the series, preparing for the birth of his second child, every moment with Andy is hilarious. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and though he may be a bit dim, Andy&#39;s an incredibly loyal friend to the Parks Department and a loving husband to April (Aubrey Plaza). There&#39;s rarely a reason he shouldn&#39;t be in an episode of the show, which makes it so strange when he disappears for much of season 6.

 Chris Pratt Was Busy Filming Guardians Of The Galaxy In Season 6 
          




In February 2013, halfway through Parks and Rec season 5, it was announced that Chris Pratt was cast as Peter Quill/Starlord in Guardians of the Galaxy (via Deadline). This announcement came as a surprise as more conventional leading men like Lee Pace, Joel Edgerton, Jack Huston, and Jim Sturgess were being considered for the role. For most audiences, Pratt was best known as the goofy, puppy-like Andy who was never particularly keen on keeping himself in &#34;superhero&#34; shape. However, previous roles in Zero Dark Thirty, Moneyball, and Wanted hinted that Pratt had more dramatic and physical chops than he let on in Parks and Rec.

Pratt&#39;s combination of comedic sensibility and physicality made him a perfect fit for Quill, whom James Gunn wrote as a swash-buckling bandit and loveable rogue. In fact, Pratt&#39;s acting combined with Gunn&#39;s writing style opened up a whole new tone for the MCU that is now commonplace in the franchise&#39;s films. Before Guardian of the Galaxy, MCU movies were distinctly darker, with the only humor coming from Joss Whedon-written quips and Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s Tony Stark. After Peter Quill, movies like Ant-Man and Thor: Ragnarok had the confidence to be as zany and fun as they liked.




Filming for Guardians of the Galaxy began in July 2013 and wrapped in October of the same year, via CBR. Unfortunately, these commitments meant Pratt was unavailable to film all of Parks and Rec season 6, which premiered in September 2013. Pratt joined a list of Parks and Rec alumni who appeared in the MCU, and that&#39;s why he is absent for a lot of season 6.



 Parks &amp; Rec Sent Andy To London To Explain His Absence 
          

In order to explain away Pratt&#39;s absence, the showrunners of Parks and Rec made a savvy move. Because Guardians of the Galaxy was filming in London, Micahel Schur and the crew flew to London to film the first two episodes of the season, properly titled &#34;London&#34; (via HuffPost). This allowed Parks and Rec to give a reason for Andy&#39;s disappearance later in the season and ensure that one of their star characters was present for the season premiere. In &#34;London&#34;, Andy travels abroad with Ben (Adam Scott) and Leslie (Amy Poehler) to help Ben expand his afterschool charity to England.




By the end of the episode, Andy has decided to stay in England to be Ben&#39;s &#34;man on the ground&#34;, running the charity, and consequentially, excusing himself from the show when it returned to America. Andy then only briefly reappears in episode 6, &#34;Filibuster&#34; and then goes back to England. Finally, in episode 10, &#34;Second Chunce&#34;, Andy returns from England for good, but the showrunners ensure Andy has jet lag, so he doesn&#39;t appear in many scenes. Pratt goes on to appear in every episode for the rest of the season.



Parks and Rec season 6 had more cast adjustments as Rashida Jones (Ann) and Rob Lowe (Chris Traeger) both left the series this season.






 Parks &amp; Rec Explained Andy&#39;s Weight Change By Saying He Gave Up Beer 
          




Like many actors who transformed their physique for MCU roles, Chris Pratt ended up losing a lot of weight for Guardians of the Galaxy. Andy frequently removes his shirt in Parks and Rec, so at some point people were going to notice his more toned appearance. Even with a shirt on, Andy looked slimmer in season 6 than he had previously. To cover this, Parks and Rec acknowledges it by having Ben ask how he lost all this weight. Andy&#39;s response is perfectly in character: &#34;I stopped drinking beer.&#34;

Ben, in disbelief, inquires how much beer Andy was drinking. Andy laughs and then trails off saying, &#34;Probably too much.&#34; It&#39;s a very funny way to point out a real-life change in the actor and also gives the audience some more information about the character. He truly must have been drinking a large amount of beer if simply stopping made him look like a stereotypical superhero.



 Chris Pratt Never Intended To Leave Parks &amp; Rec Before The Series Ended 
         




Despite skyrocketing into movie stardom with Guardians of the Galaxy, Chris Pratt never had any intention of leaving Parks and Rec before it finished. During the press tour for season 7, each member of the cast was asked why they stayed with the show through seven seasons and then Pratt was pointedly asked why he didn&#39;t leave despite being such a huge star. He said this to the Toronto Sun:


&#34;Oh, man, it&#39;s funny that you would ask that, because it never once occurred to me that I was ... I&#39;ve never even asked myself the question ... that was never a ... that would never happen ... I would never f---ing ever leave this show... It&#39;s not ... I wouldn&#39;t ... I don&#39;t care how much money someone would offer me or what I could be offered, I wouldn&#39;t abandon ship. There&#39;s no f---ing way.&#34;


To Pratt, playing Andy Dwyer in Parks and Rec was his success story, not starring in blockbuster movies. His loyalty and commitment to his projects have proven to be key assets for Pratt. He&#39;s been more than willing to appear in multiple MCU movies and Jurrasic World films.






 Chris Pratt Was Never Supposed To Be A Series Regular In The First Place 
          

Christ Pratt&#39;s success on Parks and Rec and then his branching out into being a movie star was not at all a guarantee at the start of the series. The showrunners did not even intend for Andy to stay on the show after season 1. Andy was supposed to be Ann&#39;s deadbeat boyfriend whom she would eventually get rid of and that would be it for the character. However, when Pratt came to set, Schur and his team realized what a talent they had on their hands. Schur tells Uproxx:


Definitely one of the most exciting people that we saw in the casting process was Chris Pratt... He was not supposed to be a series regular. But we just thought he was fantastic so we hired him for that role and started rewriting that character so he wasn’t such a bad guy. That was another example of changing the characters from what you initially conceived of them to try to take advantage of something good that fell in your lap.





There is something innately charming about Pratt that Schur saw instantaneously, which viewers quickly discovered as well. From his performance on Parks and Rec to his soaring movie career, Pratt has proven himself to be a quintessential player in whatever project he&#39;s involved in.
