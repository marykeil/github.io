## Literature Review
Michelle Yeoh&#39;s new action-comedy show on Netflix earns a Certified Fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes within a week of its streaming debut.




Michelle Yeoh&#39;s new Netflix project The Brothers Sun is already scoring big on Rotten Tomatoes. The show, which was co-created by Byron Wu and Glee&#39;s Brad Falchuk, stars Yeoh as Mama Sun, the protective mother of Bruce Sun (Sam Song Li), whose normal life in California is thrown into disarray when his older brother Charles (Justin Chien) comes to visit from Taipei. Bruce then finds out that their father is part of a powerful gangster family, and assassins may be on the way to target him and his mother.




Rotten Tomatoes has now calculated an official score for The Brothers Sun season 1. 25 different critics&#39; reviews have been aggregated to provide the show with a solidly Fresh score of 80%. That is enough reviews for the season to have been officially determined Certified Fresh, less than a week out from its streaming debut.


 The Brothers Sun Has Redeemed Michelle Yeoh’s Previous Netflix Flop 
          

This score shows that it was a good move to have Yeoh join the Brothers Sun cast. This also gives the star a reversal on her previous outing with the platform, as the Oscar-winning actor took a hit on Rotten Tomatoes with her other Netflix show, The Witcher: Blood Origin. That project, a prequel to the Henry Cavill fantasy show The Witcher, earned 28% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes with an even worse audience score of 13%.

Not only was The Witcher: Blood Origin a critical flop, it earned the star her only Rotten Tomatoes splat for a television show, as her other five scored titles all have Fresh averages, including Marco Polo, Star Trek: Discovery, and Strike Back: Origins. The Brothers Sun has made her future partnership with Netflix a viable option once more, but it has also potentially redeemed Yeoh’s streaming follow-up to Blood Origin, the Disney&#43; show American Born Chinese.






American Born Chinese reunited Yeoh with her Everything Everywhere All At Once co-stars Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu.




Although that graphic novel adaptation was also Certified Fresh, it was recently cancelled by Disney&#43; after just one season. At the time of writing, there is no guarantee that The Brothers Sun season 2 is going to be greenlit. However, if its strong Rotten Tomatoes score is paired with high viewership numbers, it could potentially expand into further seasons and give Yeoh her most prominent streaming success.
