## Literature Review
Sister Wives cast member Meri Brown is reacting to a shocking admission made by Kody Brown when he was about to marry his only remaining wife Robyn.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown is calling out her ex Kody Brown for lying about a major aspect of his polygamous marriages. Meri was with Kody for 32 years before their split in January 2023. Meri was Kody&#39;s first wife out of the four he eventually married. They wed in 1990 when Meri was 19 and Kody was 22. Meri&#39;s upbringing in a plural family made her feel more accepting of getting sister wives added to her marriage with Kody. However, their marriage was dysfunctional, and after 18 seasons of the reality TV show, Meri became aware of Kody&#39;s faults and chose to walk away from the relationship.




A preview clip from the upcoming Sister Wives Look Back: How It Started special shared by UsWeekly now has Meri revealing why her ex-husband is seemingly switching the “narrative” about how much he loved his ex-wives. Meri mentions that she doesn&#39;t know how to feel or what to think when she hears Kody saying, &#34;Oh, I’m so in love with all of my wives, and I’m also in love with Robyn.&#34; Meri seems to be reacting to a clip from one of Sister Wives&#39; earlier episodes when Kody was seen openly expressing his love for Meri, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, and Robyn Brown before legally marrying Robyn in 2014. &#34;So, were you lying then? Or are you lying now?” asks Meri.

Meri tells the cameras that she&#39;s observed how Kody has &#34;basically come out&#34; and said he never loved Christine in the past couple of years. Kody told Meri that he was trying to &#34;affirm&#34; that he loved her. He was only trying to do his &#34;duty.&#34; Meri further claimed, “I think that he did love each of us.&#34; She personally thinks that Kody is just trying to make it fit his &#34;narrative. To justify where he is now.” Meanwhile, Janelle too has something to share after watching Kody say that he “was choosing to love my wives” but wasn’t in love with them, during season 18 of Sister Wives.


 

&#34;The guy that I see in these early clips is who he was. I didn’t feel like I wasn’t loved,” Janelle admitted in the teaser. “I wouldn’t have married him if I didn’t think that he loved me,&#34; said Christine, in agreement with her friend Janelle. Christine thought he loved her, and he was in love with her at the beginning of our marriage. Christine believed Kody loved her even at the point when he was courting and dating Robyn. &#34;I felt like he loved me,&#34; she confessed. Christine announced her split with the Brown family patriarch in November 2021, ahead of Kody&#39;s breakup with Meri.




Christine is now married to David Woolley who she met on a dating app about a year ago. There&#39;s no chance that she will ever consider going back to Kody. Meri, who is single, is aware that Kody was willing to fake his love for her to do his &#34;duties&#34; as a husband. He claimed he hadn&#39;t felt romantic feelings towards Meri for many years, which might have been after he realized he was only attracted to Robyn. Kody and Meri were each other&#39;s first loves, but the love faded over time. He came to love the Sister Wives for what they did as a part of the roles they played in the polygamous household, but never really loved them as individuals.



Sister Wives Look Back: How It Started airs on TLC on Sunday, December 24, at 10 p.m. ET.
