## Literature Review
Following rumors in 2023, James Gunn confirms that one of Wonder Woman&#39;s most iconic villains is joining the DC Universe show Creature Commandos.




DC Studios boss James Gunn gives a new Creature Commandos update and confirms a major Wonder Woman villain will be featured in the DC Universe TV show. 2023 brought an end to the DCEU timeline, but as one franchise has concluded, Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s DC Universe is finally closer to starting. While Superman: Legacy is scheduled to be the inaugural DC Universe movie in 2025, Creature Commandos will be the first project from DC Studios to arrive in 2024.




Even though the Creature Commandos cast was revealed a year ago, no release date has been set yet beyond a late 2024 debut. However, a huge character from DC Comics will make their way into Gunn&#39;s animated show when it premieres this year on Max.

          

When asked by @dcugunn if Anya Chalotra is indeed set to play Circe in Creature Commandos, Gunn finally provided an update. Gunn, who wrote all the Creature Commandos episodes, confirmed her casting and added that &#34;there are other cool characters in the show played by other cool actors. But all of the series regulars were announced.&#34; This confirmation comes nearly five months after Chalotra&#39;s CV listed Creature Commandos. 

                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Farâ€¨   James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.    





 How Will Circe Fit Into The Creature Commandos TV Show? 
         

While Gunn has yet to reveal how Circe factors into Creature Commandos, it wouldn&#39;t be shocking if she ends up being one of the villains in the series, if not the main foe. With Circe essentially being a god, and therefore one of Wonder Woman&#39;s most dangerous villains, positioning her against the Creature Commandos team would set up a huge threat for them. There is also the potential that she is part of a larger villainous group that will take on the Creature Commandos.

Given that Gunn strongly suggested Chalotra&#39;s Circe is not a series regular, Creature Commandos is more than likely going to have other villains involved in some capacity. The bigger question, however, is whether Circe&#39;s presence will be able to give the audience an idea of what Wonder Woman&#39;s status is at this point in the franchise. Since the DC Universe will be dealing with heroes who are already established, it wouldn&#39;t be a big surprise if Diana and Circe have already been at war with each other many times.






Gunn has previously revealed that actors who voice characters in animation will also play them in live-action DC Universe projects.




Time will tell what the larger story of Creature Commandos is, as DC Studios has still been very limited in releasing plot details at this point. Nevertheless, with this being the first DC Universe animated show, it will be exciting to see how Creature Commandos weaves into the larger arc stretching across TV and film. Hopefully, it won&#39;t be much longer until the first Creature Commandos trailer is released, as well as when the show is actually premiering on Max.
