  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Despite Robyn Brown&rsquo;s love for Kody, the Sister Wives star often doesn&rsquo;t spare him from some harsh words throughout their years of marriage.</p>
<p>Despite Sister Wives star Robyn Brown&rsquo;s love for Kody Brown, she has said some harsh things to him on the show. Robyn became Kody&rsquo;s fourth wife when she married him and joined Meri Brown, Christine Brown, and Janelle Brown during Sister Wives season 1. However, almost ten years after their marriage, Robyn and Kody are in a monogamous marriage after the exit of the other wives. Kody&rsquo;s favoritism of Robyn made him gradually grow apart from his other wives, eventually leading to their exit.
Still, the recently concluded Sister Wives season 18 detailed the end of Kody&rsquo;s marriage and how it negatively impacted him and the family. However, despite Kody&rsquo;s claims that he only loved Robyn and how he looked forward to a monogamous marriage with her, Robyn has spoken about how she only wanted a polygamous family and her disappointment in the other wives leaving. While Kody has spoken about feeling safe with Robyn, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped Robyn from standing her ground and saying some harsh things to Kody.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;We have to stay out of issues between you and a wife&rdquo;
Robyn Refused To Pick A Side Between Kody &amp; Janelle</p>
<p>In one of the standout scenes from Sister Wives: Talk Back Part 1 special, Robyn and Kody were watching back a Sister Wives season 18 episode that featured Christine, Janelle, and Meri in a discussion when Kody suddenly referred to Janelle as a &ldquo;s<strong>t sister wife.&rdquo; Kody&rsquo;s comment shocked Robyn, who replied, &ldquo;Wait, wait, wait, whoa, stop. S</strong>t sister wife?&rdquo; Robyn then called out Kody for making the family&rsquo;s issues about sister wives instead of focusing on his own problems with his ex-wives.
Although Kody tried to walk back his comment by pointing out they once had a solid family unit before the wives walked and blamed Robyn and him for the family woes, the mother of five reiterated her stance and told her husband to stop blaming the wives. Still, when another clip showed a family conversation where Kody asked Meri and Robyn to comment on Janelle&rsquo;s behavior, Robyn explained to her husband that she couldn&rsquo;t interfere at that moment. According to Robyn, as a wife in a plural family, she couldn&rsquo;t pick a side between Janelle or Kody, noting, &ldquo;We have to stay out of issues between you and a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7  &ldquo;If I would have seen him show favoritism or not be fair, I would have really probably backed away from it really fast&rdquo;
Robyn Wouldn&rsquo;t Have Married Kody If She Knew He Favored Her</p>
<p>Sister Wives Look Back: How It Started special featured Robyn, Kody, and the other former wives reacting and reflecting on some emotional and dramatic moments from previous seasons and their time together as a family. During the episode, Christine, Meri, and Janelle commented on how Robyn&rsquo;s addition to the family and Kody&rsquo;s apparent favoritism towards her contributed to the family&rsquo;s disintegration. Christine explained that the wives were all equal in Kody&rsquo;s eyes before Robyn&rsquo;s addition.
Meri also questioned if Kody had been lying to the other wives since he claimed Robyn was the only wife he ever loved. However, while addressing Kody&rsquo;s favoritism towards her, Robyn explained she had seen the dangers of men favoring one or two wives in a relationship, and she wouldn&rsquo;t have married Kody if she knew he favored her, noting, &ldquo;If I would have seen him show favoritism, or not be fair, I would have really probably backed away from it really fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6  Robyn Brown Said Kody Brown Was In A &ldquo;Dark Place&rdquo;
Robyn Revealed How The Demise Of Kody&rsquo;s Marriages Negatively Affected Him</p>
<p>The exit of Christine, Janelle, and Meri from their marriage to Kody left him struggling for a long time. According to Robyn, Kody struggled with his self-image when his plural marriage fell apart in 14 months; he harbored a lot of frustration, anger, betrayal, and hurt. Robyn explained that the exit of the three wives also affected her relationship with Kody, who had adopted a self-sabotaging habit and almost placed their marriage at risk. Robyn remarked, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s just been in such a dark place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;Stop Pointing Fingers&rdquo; - Robyn Brown Calls Out Kody Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sh*t Sister Wife&rdquo;
Robyn Couldn&rsquo;t Stand Kody&rsquo;s Attempts To Avoid Taking Responsibility For Failed Marriages</p>
<p>During the Sister Wives Talk Back: Part 1 episode, Kody seemed to find something wrong with everything Janelle did while he and Robyn watched back a scene from Sister Wives season 18. In the scene, Janelle and Christine were talking about their Christmas plans, but as they watched, Kody kept commentating on how Janelle was trying to avoid having Christmas with Meri and Robyn by using the issues between Kody and her kids as an excuse. Kody also accused Janelle of trying to make him look bad and destroy his character within the family.
However, after a while, Robyn, who had sat in silence listening to Kody&rsquo;s whining, jumped to Janelle&rsquo;s defense. She told Kody to try and take some responsibility for his faults and stop blaming the sister wives. Robyn noted, &ldquo;You need to stop pointing fingers at sister wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4  &ldquo;Rewriting History&rdquo; - Robyn Brown Thinks Kody Brown&rsquo;s Changing The Narrative
Robyn Wasn&rsquo;t Sure Her Relationship With Kody Was As Special As He Claimed</p>
<p>During the Sister Wives: One-on-One special, Kody explained that his bond with Robyn was beyond what he felt with the other wives. According to Kody, he started feeling safe and vulnerable when he met Robyn, and he felt thrilled for months because he had been unsuccessfully trying to create the same feeling with the other wives.
However, addressing her connection with Kody, Robyn explained that she only felt their connection was unique once Kody started talking about it. Nonetheless, Robyn wondered if Kody was trying to &ldquo;rewrite their history&rdquo; since she did her best to only make the plural marriage work, which also involved suppressing or hiding any special connection she had with Kody.</p>
<p>3  Robyn Brown Doesn&rsquo;t Think Her Marriage With Kody Is &ldquo;Steady&rdquo;
Robyn Was Skeptical About The Future Of Her Marriage After Kody&rsquo;s Separations</p>
<p>After Kody&rsquo;s marriage to Christine and Janelle ended, Robyn spoke about her fears that the family was heading towards a monogamous marriage. At the time, Kody&rsquo;s marriage to Meri was also on the verge of ending, and Robyn spoke about how she leaned on Meri during the family&rsquo;s turmoil, and she feared the first wife might leave the family, too. According to Robyn, the exit of Christine and Janelle badly affected Kody, which also made him unpredictable, and she was scared for the future of their relationship. Robyn then declared, &ldquo;I feel very unsteady. In all reality, Kody is even being different. I don&rsquo;t feel very steady even with him.</p>
<p>2  Robyn Brown Had A &ldquo;Rotten&rdquo; Moment With Kody Brown After A Joke Fell Flat
Kody Didn&rsquo;t Find Robyn&rsquo;s Joke About Their Future Amusing</p>
<p>During the final part of the Sister Wives Talk Back special, Kody and Robyn played some clips from Sister Wives season 18. In one of the clips, while conversing with Meri, Robyn joked, &ldquo;You never know if Kody and I are going to stay together,&rdquo; which led to the two women erupting in laughter. After watching the clip, an unamused Kody sat emotionless on the couch while Robyn glanced at him nervously. She then acknowledged and apologized for making such a rotten joke. After the demise of three of his marriages, Kody wasn&rsquo;t happy with Robyn&rsquo;s ill-timed joke.</p>
<p>1  Robyn Brown Said Kody Brown Tried To &ldquo;Sabotage&rdquo; Their Marriage
Kody Tried To Destroy His Relationship With Robyn</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s separation from his first three wives was very hard for him and negatively impacted his family. According to Robyn, the separations took Kody to a dark place, which put their marriage at risk by trying to sabotage their relationship (via People). Robyn explained, &ldquo;There have been times he&rsquo;s tried to self-sabotage and sabotage us. I&rsquo;ve had to work hard not to let him.&rdquo; Robyn is Kody&rsquo;s only remaining wife, and she has had to pull Kody through a hellish period for the Sister Wives stars.</p>
