## Literature Review

CBS releases a new Young Sheldon season 7 trailer that looks back on the Big Bang Theory prequel&#39;s history while also teasing its final season. 




A new emotional Young Sheldon season 7 trailer looks back at the Big Bang Theory prequel while also looking forward to its final year. If the show tracks with the timeline established by The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon will wrap up his childhood and move to Pasadena, California after finishing college in season 7, which will be the CBS&#39; series last. Because Young Sheldon is coming to a close, the network has been steadily hyping up its February 15 premiere with a plethora of promos and teases.




The official Young Sheldon Instagram account now shares an emotional trailer that goes down memory lane for Sheldon and the Coopers&#39; arc in the prequel thus far, while also teasing what&#39;s to come. Watch it below:


 

The short clip highlights the highs and lows for the clan during the last six years of Young Sheldon. In the end, it features a couple of new scenes with Sheldon back in Texas, while also debuting a new family photo that includes Mandy and Baby Cece.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7: Release Date, Cast, Story, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   The wildly successful Big Bang Theory spinoff series Young Sheldon has followed the genius for six seasons, and here&#39;s what we know about season 7.   


 How Emotional Will Young Sheldon Season 7 Be? 
          




Unlike The Big Bang Theory, which was a multi-cam sitcom, CBS opted to change Young Sheldon&#39;s storytelling format to a single-cam series, allowing it to have a more serious tone when it wanted to. Its first few seasons leaned on comedy, however, with Sheldon maintaining his spot as the series&#39; headliner. That being said, it slowly transformed to become more of a family comedy-drama, with an increased focus on the rest of the Coopers. The variation of arcs also paved the way for it to tackle more serious storylines, including teenage pregnancy and marital woes.

Season 6 is the actualization of this slow shift in storytelling. However, considering the storylines that Young Sheldon season 7 will tackle, it&#39;s safe to say that the end of the Big Bang Theory prequel&#39;s run will be its most emotional. For starters, George&#39;s death is upcoming, and it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s something that the creative team can skip. Secondly, Sheldon moving out of Texas and living in California will also be a poignant moment for the family.




The shift to becoming more of a family comedy/drama has proven to be a welcome development for Young Sheldon. Season 6 posted series-high ratings, indicating that viewers are responding to a more serious and less silly prequel. Between that and Young Sheldon&#39;s recent success on Netflix, season 7 has the chance to be its biggest year ever.



Young Sheldon season 7 premieres on Thursday, February 15 on CBS.
