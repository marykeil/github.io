## Literature Review
Twisted Metal showrunner offers a detailed season 2 update, confirming new characters and comparing the deadly tournament to a popular Netflix show.




Twisted Metal showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith offers a detailed season 2 update about its characters and story teases. The ten-episode first installment, which was developed by Deadpool writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick alongside Smith, debuted on Peacock in July 2022. The series stars Anthony Mackie as John Doe, a generally upbeat delivery man living in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, suffering from amnesia. The show, which also stars Stephanie Beatriz, Thomas Haden Church, Neve Campbell, wrestler Samoa Joe (Joe Seanoa), and the voice of Will Arnett as Sweet Tooth, ended on a cliffhanger that looks to set up the deadly tournament seen in the video games.




In a recent interview with NBC Insider, Smith gave a progress update on Twisted Metal season 2 and mentioned that the writers&#39; room has started up. The showrunner also confirmed the introductions of Dollface, Axel, and Calypso and elaborated on the titular deadly contest that&#39;s been highly anticipated by followers of the video game. He also broke down how it compares to Cobra Kai — which Smith has also worked on. Read the full response below:


“The [writers&#39;] room has started. We have an amazing team of writers and we’re discussing the arc of the season and what the first episode might be, looking at the big picture. I’m really excited.”
“He’s my favorite and I’m excited to capture what the fans are excited about seeing, but also [answer the question of]: ‘How does he exist in the world we’ve set up?’ I think there’s just going to be a lot of fun with him — what kind of character he is in this world and how does he interact with people like Sweet Tooth? We have to get Axel right.”
“I’m excited for fans to see these characters come to life and see what makes them funny and what makes them heartbroken. I think it’s gonna be fun to dive into these people … We introduced a lot of these characters — Preacher, Bloody Mary, John, Quiet, Watts — it’s gonna be fun to put them all in a [single] place at the tournament and have them interact. I’m excited about seeing how does Preacher react to Bloody Mary? How does Grimm react to Sweet Tooth?’ There’s a lot of really fun, interconenctive character headspace stuff that I’m really excited to dive into. It feels like a new toy box.”
“Here’s what I’ll say. On Cobra Kai, there were very much tournament seasons and consequence seasons, and this is very much a tournament season. I want everything to feel like it’s tied to the tournament, even if we aren’t in the tournament yet. I am hopeful that it will surprise and delight those people who saw the finale of Episode 10 and was like, ‘I want to see more of that in a tournament setting.’ My goal is to capture that.”






 What To Know About Twisted Metal Season 2&#39;s Characters 
          

The character of Dollface was already introduced in the Twisted Metal season 1 finale. In the source material, Dollface is John Doe&#39;s sister, but in the Peacock adaptation, not much is revealed about the character. Dollface ambushes Quiet (played by Brooklyn Nine-Nine alum Beatriz) and asks for information about John Doe. The character is distinguished by a unique mask and her eye-catching attire.

Axel and Calypso were also among the Easter eggs sprinkled throughout Twisted Metal season 1. In the games, Axel is notable for the fact that he&#39;s psychically connected to his vehicle. In particular, he is part of the &#34;axel&#34; between the two wheels. The character, who has appeared in nearly every Twisted Metal game, will be part of the upcoming season&#39;s tournament.




                  Who Is Calypso? Twisted Metal Character Explained &amp; Why He Will Be So Important In Season 2   At the end of Twisted Metal season 1, there were hints of the video game&#39;s main antagonist Calypso, as he will make a significant impact in season 2.    

As for Calypso, he is the creator of the Twisted Metal contest. He can grant any wish the eventual winner desires, no matter what it is. However, that wish is often twisted and turned into a form of punishment. Raven (Campbell) doesn&#39;t seem to mind the potential risks, as she enlists John to be her driver in the deadly tournament. It adds up to a potentially gruesome second installment of the streaming success.



All episodes of Twisted Metal season 1 are available on Peacock.
