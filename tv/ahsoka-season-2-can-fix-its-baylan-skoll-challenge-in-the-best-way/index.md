# Ahsoka Season 2 Can Fix Its Baylan Skoll Challenge In The Best Way


## SUMMARY 



  Ahsoka season 2 may address the absence of Ray Stevenson&#39;s Baylan Skoll by having Shin Hati take over his quest.   The season 1 cliffhanger suggests that Baylan&#39;s apprentice, Shin, holds the key to Ahsoka season 2&#39;s biggest challenge by taking over his future narratives with the Mortis Gods.   Instead of recasting or using digital effects, having Shin continue Baylan&#39;s quest in season 2 would be a very fitting way to honor Ray Stevenson&#39;s legacy.

## Literature Review

Ahsoka season 2 has the perfect way to solve the challenge of continuing Baylan Skoll&#39;s story in the future of the live-action Star Wars show.




Ahsoka season 2 has the best way to solve its biggest challenge regarding the continuation of Baylan Skoll&#39;s story in Star Wars&#39; future. Having been beautifully portrayed in Ahsoka season 1, Baylan Skoll actor Ray Stevenson tragically passed away in May of 2023. Although a significant cliffhanger and exciting future for the new villain was teased, Star Wars doesn&#39;t necessarily need to worry about recasting or deepfaking, while still honoring Stevenson&#39;s character and the legacy he left behind.




In Ahsoka season 1, Baylan Skoll and his apprentice Shin Hati were hired by the Nightsister Morgan Elsbeth to help her find and rescue Grand Admiral Thrawn from his exile on the extragalactic world of Peridea. However, Baylan eventually reveals his true motives with his belief that a hidden power was calling to him on Peridea, one he hoped would help him break the galaxy&#39;s never-ending cycle of destruction and conflict between the light and dark. Although he abandoned his apprentice in search of this power, Shin herself may hold the answer to Ahsoka season 2&#39;s biggest challenge.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Ahsoka Season 2 Has A Major Gap To Fill Without Ray Stevenson&#39;s Baylan Skoll 
Baylan&#39;s Ending Holds The Biggest Teases For Star Wars&#39; Future
         




Believing that his apprentice was not ready for this higher calling, Baylan told Shin to join with Thrawn and to claim the power he offered, however temporary it might be. Leaving Shin, Baylan briefly dueled Ahsoka Tano before heading on his quest to find the source of this mysterious power. As a result, Ahsoka season 1 ends with Baylan Skoll standing on the massive statues of the Mortis Gods, the celestial Force beings who were once tethered to the balance of the Force itself and the Chosen One prophecy.

The statue of the Father in Ahsoka season 1 is featured pointing across an expansive valley to a distant mountain with what appeared to be a shining beacon, presumably the source of the power Baylan is seeking. As such, the implication is that Baylan is meant to continue his quest now that his destination is seemingly in sight. However, it&#39;s not yet known what Lucasfilm&#39;s plans are for Baylan in the wake of Ray Stevenson&#39;s passing. Considering how crucial this narrative will likely be for Ahsoka season 2, Lucasfilm needs to come up with a solution that makes sense.






 Shin Hati Could Take On Baylan Skoll&#39;s Season 2 Story 
The Student Follows In The Master&#39;s Footsteps
          

Rather than recasting or attempting to use digital effects as Lucasfilm has done in the past, the simplest answer may also be the best. Ivanna Sakhno&#39;s Shin Hati could easily be positioned to take over her master&#39;s quest in Ahsoka season 2.

Rather than joining with Thrawn as her master suggested, Shin instead chooses to stay on Peridea where it seems she was attempting to lead the region&#39;s clan of howler-riding bandits. However, perhaps she&#39;ll try tracking Baylan down in Ahsoka season 2 with the desire to prove her worth, only to find that Skoll&#39;s task has now fallen to her. To that end, it would certainly be a great way to honor both Ray Stevenson and Baylan&#39;s legacy with the student truly following in the footsteps of the master in the Star Wars galaxy.






Ahsoka season 2 is currently in development from Lucasfilm and Disney.
