## Literature Review

The Boys is full of memorable characters, many of them superheroes, but ten members from the cast would be perfect for Marvel and DC roles.




The Boys consists of an excellent cast and many of the actors already play superheroes, which makes some of them perfect for Marvel and DC roles. Marvel and DC&#39;s universes are very different from The Boys&#39;. With Marvel and DC, the heroes and villains tend to be obvious to the audience and the civilians in the universe, whereas this is less clear in The Boys. Many of the so-called supes are actually the show&#39;s biggest antagonists, Homelander being the prime example of this. On the surface, he seems like a hero, but in reality, he is the epitome of evil.
Even the show&#39;s protagonists have more morally gray areas than the typical Marvel or DC hero. This all makes The Boys compelling, and the actors do a fantastic job of making the characters feel believable. Their performances show not only how well they can act, but also how much they understand the superhero genre. The Boys therefore acts as the perfect experience to join other superhero franchises, with many of the show&#39;s main cast possessing the right qualities to join these universes and some Marvel and DC characters are the perfect fit for their acting styles.









 








 10  Claudia Doumit - Talia Al Ghul 
Claudia Doumit Plays Victoria Neuman In The Boys
        

Claudia Doumit&#39;s Victoria Neuman is a big problem in The Boys and is one of the most complex characters in the show. Doumit convincingly displays a powerful, untrustworthy politician whose goals are never fully clear. Not only does Doumit fit Talia al Ghul visually, but her qualities in The Boys fit the DC character&#39;s personality perfectly. Talia is a villain, yet often finds alliances with the likes of Batman due to her unknown goals. She is a master at manipulating and while she is not as evil as other villains, Talia has self-centered objectives, just like Doumit&#39;s Victoria Neuman.





 9  Chace Crawford - Green Lantern 
Chace Crawford Plays The Deep In The Boys
        

The most obvious connection to Chace Crawford&#39;s The Deep would be Aquaman, but the actor&#39;s characteristics are much more like Green Lantern. Even though the Deep has many bad attributes, Crawford still manages to garner some sympathy for such a cowardly character. Using this charm, Crawford could do justice to Hal Jordan&#39;s version of Green Lantern. In many ways, Jordan is the polar opposite of The Deep, yet Crawford could pull off both. Flipping some of The Deep&#39;s main traits would create a respectable Green Lantern and The Boys actor has the right skills to make it work.





 8  Tomer Capone - Nightcrawler 
Tomer Capone Plays Frenchie In The Boys
        

Frenchie is one of the most wholesome characters in The Boys, often acting as the rock of the group, not too dissimilar to Nightcrawler in the X-Men. Although he has a slightly unorthodox appearance, Nightcrawler is playful, energetic, and kind, proving to be an underrated Marvel character. He is much livelier than Tomer Capone&#39;s Frenchie, but in terms of defining characteristics and their roles in their respective groups, Frenchie and Nightcrawler are alike. With Capone&#39;s ability to make Frenchie both hilarious and heartwarming, he could do the same with Nightcrawler and create his own iconic look in the process.
            
 
 The MCU Will Finally Reveal Its Answer To The Boys In 2025 
The Boys is far too dark for the MCU, yet the lineup of Marvel movies in 2025 will include its own answer to the brutal team of anti-heroes.








 7  Jack Quaid - The Flash 
Jack Quaid Plays Hughie In The Boys
        

Jack Quaid&#39;s DC debut came in My Adventures With Superman, where he played one of the franchise&#39;s most iconic characters, Clark Kent. Quaid has also appeared in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse as a version of Peter Parker, meaning he has already played two of the most famous superheroes ever made. Despite this, The Flash would be his perfect hero role outside The Boys. Flash&#39;s best portrayals emphasize his sillier side, such as in Justice League (2001) where Barry Allen is way too overconfident, something Quaid would make hilarious.
A live-action version of The Flash that utilizes Quaid&#39;s awkward humor would be great. Hughie is one of the key members of the main group in The Boys, despite his nerdy and shy persona. This doesn&#39;t stop him from diving into situations he doesn&#39;t belong in to save the ones he loves. Bringing these qualities to The Flash could be one of the character&#39;s best adaptations to date. Quaid could still be at the end of most jokes like in The Boys, but while he may be a little cockier, he&#39;d still have those heroic instincts associated with The Flash.





 6  Laz Alonso - Blue Marvel 
Laz Alonso Plays Mother&#39;s Milk In The Boys
        

In terms of looks, build, and size, Laz Alonso seems tailor-made to play Blue Marvel. Given that strength is one of Blue Marvel&#39;s biggest powers, Alonso&#39;s physique would make him a believable fit for a live-action version of the superhero. Both MM and Blue Marvel have a history in the Marine Corps, with Alonso able to nail the toughness that comes with that background without overplaying it. Alonso&#39;s MM is also one of The Boys&#39; most moral characters, which would set him up nicely to play Blue Marvel, given he is a very by-the-book superhero.





 5  Anthony Starr - Green Goblin 
Anthony Starr Plays Homelander In The Boys
        

Anthony Starr&#39;s Homelander is an all-time great villain and proves he could nail Green Goblin. While Starr&#39;s Homelander performance shows how sadistic and evil he can be, it is also a sign that he can hide his true intentions. Green Goblin is a complex character since he is a supervillain and also a businessman outside the mask. Homelander has a mirror scene in The Boys imitating Green Goblin&#39;s Spider-Man scene, showing the similarities between the characters. Homelander&#39;s unhinged antics masked by his public persona are exactly what the next Green Goblin needs, and Starr would be an excellent candidate.





 4  Karen Fukuhara - Zatanna 
Karen Fukuhara Plays Kimiko In The Boys
        

Although Karen Fukuhara has already appeared in the DC universe as Katana, she would be a great fit to play Zatanna in the DC reboot. Katana explored the more silent and aggressive side of Fukuhara&#39;s The Boys character Kimiko. However, Fukuhara also brought out a softer side of Kimiko that is more in tune with Zatanna, and it would be great to see the actress&#39; more performative side. She has already shown she can play the more delicate aspects of Zatanna, and it would be fun to see her combine this with the character&#39;s magical elements.
            
 
 The Boys&#39; Supes: Who Would Win In A Fight Against The Justice League 
The Supes of Amazon Prime&#39;s The Boys are largely inspired by the Justice League, but they wouldn&#39;t all fare the same in a fight.








 3  Karl Urban - Wolverine 
Karl Urban Plays Billy Butcher In The Boys
        

Like Fukuhara, Urban has already played a superhero, although in this case Marvel, but Wolverine would be an exciting role for him. Hugh Jackman may be returning to play Wolverine, but the long-term future of this is unclear. With the multiversal saga the MCU is currently in, Karl Urban&#39;s grizzled Billy Butcher performance could be a good fit for a new Wolverine. Urban can play a more aggressive and closed-off character, as his portrayal of Billy Butcher shows. His sarcasm and confidence mask his loneliness and the single-minded nature of Butcher wouldn&#39;t be too far off Wolverine&#39;s mentality.





 2  Erin Moriarty - Dazzler 
Erin Moriarty Plays Starlight In The Boys
        

Despite rumors surrounding Taylor Swift playing Dazzler, the lack of confirmation means the MCU role is still open. Erin Moriarty has the right look to play Dazzler and, while Starlight is a shier character in comparison, Moriarty still has the credentials to pull off such a role. Moriarty&#39;s Starlight is driven, optimistic and a great role model for women, just like Dazzler. They may have different personalities, but both characters share similar traits in terms of what makes them heroes, and Moriarty getting the chance to play a more outspoken and fearless character would show her star power.





 1  Jensen Ackles - Batman 
Jensen Ackles Plays Soldier Boy In The Boys
        

Jensen Ackles is no stranger to playing Batman and deserves a shot at the part in a live-action outing. Jensen Ackles first played Batman in Batman: The Long Halloween and has voiced him in several projects since, but has never portrayed Batman on the big screen. His role as Soldier Boy in The Boys highlights that he could do the playboy role of Bruce Wayne well, while also being an intimidating vigilante. With DC needing a new Batman, someone with the experience of Ackles would be a logical choice, and it is a role the actor would thrive in.
