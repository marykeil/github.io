## Literature Review
A subtle detail in Steve&#39;s outfit on a set photo teases when Stranger Things season 5 can take place at the earliest, and it involves a time jump.




One subtle detail in a photo from the set of Stranger Things season 5 points to when the final season can be set, teasing a time jump. Stranger Things quickly won over the audience thanks to its combination of horror, fantasy, mystery, and references to the 1980s, and it’s now preparing for its fifth and final season. Stranger Things season 5 is already facing some major challenges, both in-universe and behind the scenes, thanks to the shocking events and reveals in season 4 and the delays this season had to go through due to the Hollywood 2023 strikes.




Stranger Things season 4 revealed more about the Upside Down and what Vecna’s (Jamie Campbell Bower) role in it is, and it had the most shocking ending the series has seen. The main characters once again split into groups to target different issues, all of them connected to the Upside Down. Unfortunately, they couldn’t defeat Vecna and they couldn’t save Max (Sadie Sink) on time, so Vecna’s plan to destroy Hawkins was fulfilled. The final scenes in Stranger Things season 4 saw the Upside Down taking over the human world, and while season 5 was expected to pick up right where season 4 began, a detail in Steve’s outfit in a set photo hints at that not being the case.

                  Stranger Things Cast Photo Teases The Main Party Getting A New Member In Season 5   Season 5 of Stranger Things is finally in production, and one new cast photo suggests one character will have a bigger role in the final episodes.    


 Steve&#39;s Nike Shoes In Stranger Things Season 5 Hints At A Time Jump To 1987 Or Later 
          




Stranger Things season 5 is officially in production, and to celebrate the occasion, series co-creator Ross Duffer shared some photos from the set. The first one shows Maya Hawke and Joe Keery in full-character outfits, and the third one is a close-up look at Keery/Steve’s shoes next to some snacks. While this might seem like an unimportant photo, the shoes are the biggest clue so far about when Stranger Things season 5 might be set. Season 1 of Stranger Things was set in 1983, season 2 in 1984, season 3 in 1985, and season 4 in 1986, but season 5 might break this tradition and make a time jump to 1987, at the earliest.


 

Steve’s shoes are the Nike Air Max, which were released on March 26, 1987. This means that Stranger Things season 5 will be set sometime after March 1987, as Steve wouldn’t have been able to get those shoes before that date. The production team of Stranger Things has been very careful with details like clothes, shoes, music, and movies so they fit each season’s time setting, so it’s unlikely that Steve wearing shoes that were released in 1987 is a mistake. It’s possible, however, that Stranger Things season 5 will be set after 1987, quite possibly 1988, as in another photo, a copy of the book Planing, Shaping, &amp; Slotting can be seen, and it looks like the 1988 edition.






 What Stranger Things&#39; Cast &amp; Creators Have Said About A Season 5 Time Jump 
          

A time jump in Stranger Things season 5 has been rumored since season 4 came to an end, and gained force after production went through various delays. A time jump seems like the best option for Stranger Things season 5 as its youngest cast members no longer look as young as they did at the end of season 4, and the Duffer Brothers had already considered this option. Speaking to TV Line in 2022, Ross Duffer said he was sure they would do a time jump, and hopefully, it won’t be a massive time jump that creates more plot holes and questions.
