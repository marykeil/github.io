## Literature Review
Jonny Holloway and Meg Corrick don&#39;t hold back as they discover the identities of the traitors currently competing in The Traitors UK season 2.




Jonny Holloway was recently banished on The Traitors UK season 2, but a big question lingering after his exit is whether he feels any sort of betrayal from Harry Clark. The two were able to bond while competing together on The Traitors UK because they both served in the miliary. As a result, they felt a &#34;brotherhood&#34; toward each other. Unfortunately, Harry (one of the traitors) didn&#39;t stick to that brotherhood and decided to publicly side with the rest of the players accusing him of being a traitor. He joined the majority and voted to banish Jonny on The Traitors UK. He got &#34;choked up&#34; because he knew he had betrayed his &#34;hero.&#34;




After his banishment, Jonny joined Meg Corrick, who was murdered in the same Traitors UK season 2 episode, and the cameras captured their reactions on The Traitors: Uncloacked after-show (and shared by @the_traitors_ on Twitter) when they found out who the traitors are. The first name they saw on a piece of paper was none other than Harry. Both Jonny and Meg had very shocked expressions, though the former admitted it was &#34;fair play.&#34;


 

Jonny had &#34;question marks&#34; about Harry, but he ended up ignoring those instincts &#34;because we were both in the Army.&#34; Meg noted how &#34;phenomenal&#34; Harry was in the trials and missions. To prove even more that he didn&#39;t hold any bad feelings against his fellow veteran, he added, &#34;He&#39;s been given a task and he&#39;s doing it.&#34;





 Jonny &amp; Meg Discover The Traitors&#39; Identities 
          

After getting over the shock about Harry, Meg then read aloud the next name, which was Miles Asteri. Both Jonny and Meg were once again completely surprised, and Jonny had a similar reaction to finding out about Harry&#39;s true identity in the game. Jonny &#34;didn&#39;t want it to be&#34; Miles, so he just pushed down any suspicions he may have had. Jonny observed that both Harry and Miles are playing the game in a very &#34;go with the flow&#34; manner, which has resulted in them being under the radar. Then Meg realized that those two traitors &#34;threw [fellow traitor Ash] under the bus&#34; last time by voting to banish her.

Finally, Meg was absolutely stunned to see Paul Gorton as the final name on the list of traitors. &#34;You&#39;re joking!&#34; she exclaimed. However, Jonny admitted he had his suspicions about Paul. Both eliminated players called Paul out, saying, &#34;What an actor.&#34; At the end of the day, despite her shock, Meg can&#39;t &#34;mock&#34; the traitors&#39; identities because of how well they&#39;ve been playing the game without being caught.

Jonny and Harry&#39;s bond due to their military backgrounds was great to see. No one would have blamed Jonny for feeling betrayed, so it was heartwarming to see that he didn&#39;t hold any grudges. Even Harry was extremely torn over the decision he made. At the end of the day, though, both players acknowledged that The Traitors UK is just a game, and sometimes they have to backstab each other in order to further their own ambitions.



The Traitors UK season 2 airs Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 9 p.m. UK time on BBC One.
