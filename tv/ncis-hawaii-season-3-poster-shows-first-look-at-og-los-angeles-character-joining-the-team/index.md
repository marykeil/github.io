## Literature Review
The first official poster for NCIS: Hawaii season 3 shows the return of Sam Hanna after he made an appearance in the final episode of season 2.




A new official poster for NCIS: Hawaii season 3 gives a first look at the return of an original NCIS: Los Angeles character. Hawaii is the fourth spin-off of the NCIS franchise and is set to return for its third season in February, a delayed start due to the writers and actors strikes of 2023. The series stars Vanessa Lachey, Alex Tarrant, Jason Antoon, Yasmine Al-Bustami, Noah Mills, and Tori Anderson. As NCIS: Los Angeles came to a close last spring, original cast member LL Cool J will reprise his role as Sam Hanna for a recurring part in Hawaii season 3.




As revealed by TVInsider, ahead of the NCIS: Hawaii season 3 premiere, CBS has released a poster that features familiar faces from the original main cast along with LL Cool J, teasing his prominent role within the show&#39;s new episodes.

          

The poster shows LL Cool J standing on the far right alongside other key members of the NCIS: Hawaii team: Antoon, Tarrant, Anderson, Al-Bustami, Mills, and Lachey.


 What To Expect From NCIS: Hawaii Season 3 
          

Typically, NCIS: Hawaii, along with the flagship series NCIS, would return for new episodes in the fall. However, due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, production for the new season was halted, causing an atypical delay. Following the resolution of the strike, CBS announced that NCIS: Hawaii season 3 will premiere on February 12. The show is also expected to return to a primetime Monday slot on CBS, airing directly after NCIS season 21.




Plot details for NCIS: Hawaii season 3 have confirmed that LL Cool J&#39;s Sam will help Agent Tennant and her team on their latest case. Whether this case will then stretch across multiple episodes, thus ensuring he sticks around, remains to be seen. What is clear, though, is that Sam will play a part in Tennant&#39;s initial arc as she returns to work, as Sam will be conducting her final interview.

Regarding the cast members of NCIS: Hawaii season 3, the show’s main cast members are all also expected to reprise their respective roles. While there’s been no official confirmation, it is possible that Julie White and Henry Ian Cusick, two important guest stars who made notable appearances in season 2, could also be returning for the new season. More details will undoubtedly be revealed as the series gets closer to its highly-anticipated return.
