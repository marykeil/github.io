## Literature Review
What is Netflix&#39;s The Three-Body Problem, and when will it release? Here&#39;s everything we know about David Benioff and D.B. Weiss&#39; upcoming TV series.




3 Body Problem looks set to be a new cosmic horror sci-fi hit for Netflix, and 3 Body Problem news is starting to trickle in ahead of the 2024 release date. The new sci-fi series, a collaboration between Netflix and Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, has been in the pipeline for a while, and the upcoming Netflix show is based on Liu Cixin&#39;s &#34;Remembrance of Earth&#39;s Past&#34; novels.




The creative team behind 3 Body Problem also means 3 Body Problem news has been long sought-after. Benioff and Weiss upset many Game of Thrones fans with the final season. However, since the 3 Body Problem story is completed in the books, their latest venture with Netflix can avoid the Game of Thrones ending issue — leaving showrunners Benioff and Weiss free to bring the best of their still-admirable tenure on GoT to 3 Body Problem. From the cast and release date to the story and trailer, here is all the recent 3 Body Problem news.


 The Latest 3 Body Problem News 
         

After a slew of clues have been revealed about the new show, the latest update finds a full trailer for 3 Body Problem released by Netflix. In its two-minute runtime, the creepy trailer eloquently sets up the main conflict of the series while also showing off the familiar faces of the cast. Despite being a lengthy teaser, the trailer doesn&#39;t give anything away and allows the overall mystery of the series to take center stage to drum up even more excitement for the Netflix adaptation.






 3 Body Problem Release Date 
          

Though initial reports had the show premiering in January 2024, the date was moved due to a host of factors in the industry during 2023, including the strikes. As such, 3 Body Problem will now premiere on March 21st, 2024. This sudden change in the release may explain why Netflix has opted to drop the trailer so early because it will stir up interest despite a two-month wait until the show&#39;s debut.



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.




 





 3 Body Problem Cast 
          




Netflix has revealed the 3 Body Problem cast, and it is packed with familiar faces from both movies and TV. This includes Benedict Wong as intelligence officer Da Shi, and Game of Thrones alum Liam Cunningham as Thomas Wade. Jess Hong will play Jin Cheng who might be Ye Wenjie from the novels, the first person to establish contact with the aliens.

A slew of other big names and characters have been revealed thus far, including:

 Actor  3 Body Problem Role   Jovan Adepo  Saul Durand   John Bradley  Jack Rooney   Rosalind Chao  Ye Wenjie   Eliza González  Auggie Salazar   Marlo Kelly  Tatiana   Jonathan Pryce  Mike Evans   Eve Ridley  Follower   Ben Schnetzer  Young Mike Evans   Alex Sharp  Will Downing   Sea Shimooka  Sophon   Zine Tseng  Young Ye Wenjie   Saamar Usmani  Raj Varma   








 3 Body Problem Story Details 
          

The 3 Body Problem story will cover the entirety of the &#34;Remembrance of Earth&#39;s Past&#34; trilogy. In the first novel, Earth awaits an attack from a three-body star system universe, while the second book, The Dark Forest, explores preparations for the inevitable war. The final novel, Death&#39;s End, incorporates various time jumps for a more expansive storyline. This takes place over decades, so expect a wide-spanning mystery in 3 Body Problem. The full 3 Body Problem timeline covers several centuries as humanity waits for the invasion to arrive, but focuses on specific points within this period.

What makes the 3 Body Problem story — and the Remembrance of Earth’s Past book trilogy — so popular is that this is not a typical alien invasion narrative. The invasion in 3 Body Problem isn&#39;t sudden — it&#39;s an inevitable doom, and humanity has an existential crisis trying to comprehend it. 3 Body Problem is also a bleak story that contains complex scientific theories while remaining fast-moving and entertaining. If Benioff and Weiss get this right, 3 Body Problem could be their next big hit after Game of Thrones.






 3 Body Problem Trailer 
          

After first releasing a teaser at their Tudum event, Netflix has finally dropped a full trailer for 3 Body Problem that is even bigger and creepier than before. The two-minute trailer not only introduces the characters but shows off the series&#39; tone of claustrophobic dread as the mystery is explained without things being revealed too much. The scope of the series is also on full display as the trailer makes it clear that 3 Body Problem is a globe-trotting, generation-spanning epic, unlike anything Netflix has produced before.
