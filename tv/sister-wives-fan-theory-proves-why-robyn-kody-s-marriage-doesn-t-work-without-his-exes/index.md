# Sister Wives Fan Theory Proves Why Robyn &amp; Kody s Marriage Doesn t Work Without His Exes


## SUMMARY 



  Kody and Robyn&#39;s relationship won&#39;t work without the other Sister Wives stars because they have nothing to discuss and Robyn isn&#39;t as special anymore.   Kody and Robyn have always lived within the framework of polygamy, so their marriage might struggle when faced with a monogamous dynamic.   Despite the challenges, there is hope for Kody and Robyn&#39;s marriage if they truly are soulmates, as they have already functioned as a monogamous couple within a plural marriage.

## Literature Review
Kody Brown may think he has found his soulmate in Robyn Brown, but Sister Wives viewers have figured out why their marriage won’t survive.




Many Sister Wives viewers have speculated about why Kody Brown and Robyn Brown’s relationship might fail without Janelle, Meri, and Christine Brown. The Brown family has undergone a major shift over the last three years. In early 2021, Christine packed her bags and divorced Kody because of a lack of respect and love. She moved on to find her soulmate, David Woolley, and married him in 2023. Similarly, Meri and Janelle realized their self-worth during Sister Wives season 18. The two ladies also left the Brown family patriarch, leaving him to be monogamous with his fourth wife, Robyn.




Recently, Redditor HedgehogSammich speculated about why Kody and Robyn’s one-on-one marriage won’t work after being in a polygamous relationship. Other Redditors theorized many reasons and concluded that Robyn and Kody’s marriage won&#39;t work because their dynamic had shifted.


 

Since Meri, Christine, and Janelle aren’t in the Brown family, Kody and Robyn have nothing to discuss anymore. They can’t gossip, discuss, and banter about the other women because they aren’t in their lives. Moreover, the exit of Kody’s former wives means Robyn isn’t his favorite. She’s his only wife and isn’t special like before. Also, as one Redditor put it, &#34;Without any other wives around Kody is now her sole problem. She can&#39;t foist him off or their problems off on someone else now.&#34;





 Robyn &amp; Kody Brown&#39;s Sister Wives Relationship Explained 
Kody and Robyn had a special relationship at the start. They fell in love in 2010 and tied the knot to expand their polygamous household. At the time, Robyn assumed the role of the youngest wife in the family, as Meri, Janelle, and Christine were all in their 40&#39;s. Kody enjoyed spending time with Robyn because he loved her traditional approach and craved her youthful aura. He had two kids with her and legally adopted her other two kids, Breanna Brown and Aurora Brown, from a previous relationship.

Fans have probably hit the bullseye about the potential future of Kody and Robyn. Sister Wives premiered over 13 years ago. At the time, Kody and Robyn tied the knot and built the framework of their marriage around polygamy. The two have never experienced each other out of that bubble. They’ve always been busy with the family drama and their TV show. Now Kody and Robyn will have to face their real selves. They no longer have Meri, Christine, and Janelle to worry about. They&#39;ll have to experience each other like normal couples, which may or may not end well.




Still, there is some hope for Kody and Robyn’s marriage. There’s a chance that they can pull off a monogamous relationship without any problems. Kody and Robyn have lived in a polygamous family for 13 years. However, Meri, Janelle, and Christine have revealed that Robyn is Kody’s soulmate. If that’s the case, the Brown family patriarch and his fourth wife have nothing to fear. They’ve lived like a monogamous couple, even in a plural marriage. Therefore, Kody’s divorces from the other sister wives technically don’t change anything.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
