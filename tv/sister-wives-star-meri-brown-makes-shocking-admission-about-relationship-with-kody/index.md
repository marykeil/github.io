## Literature Review
Sister Wives cast member Meri Brown looks back at the past three decades of her marriage to Kody Brown and reveals if she has any regrets.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown just made a surprising comment about her relationship with ex-husband Kody Brown. She was 19 years old when she met the 22-year-old Kody. Meri was raised in a polygamous family in Utah. She was introduced to Kody by his sister in October 1989, and they married in April 1990. Meri was open to living in a plural family with Kody due to her background. She knew Kody would eventually add another wife or two into the family. Kody divorced Meri in September 2014 to legally marry his fourth wife, Robyn. However, it wasn’t until years later that they ended their relationship for good.




Meri and Kody announced their breakup in a joint Instagram post in January 2023. In her recent interview with People, Meri said that despite the marriage ending, she would “do it all over again.” She believes there are “definitely” some things in the past three decades that she wishes she could have done differently. “Different conversations that I would’ve had,” she added. “But I mean, hindsight’s 20/20, right?” Meri continued, “You don’t know until you know.” There are a lot of things she claims she and Kody didn’t know. “All of us didn’t know 20 years ago, 30 years ago,” she added.

Meri thinks that her family and the life that she lived along with the experiences that she’s had all contributed to who she is now. “I can’t regret that at all,” the reality TV star admitted. Meri knows that she gave it 100 percent before announcing her split from Kody. She did everything that she would have done. “And if I would&#39;ve walked away any sooner, there would&#39;ve always been a question in my mind of did I do everything that I can do?” she wondered. However, Meri is very confident, knowing that she did everything in her power before ending things.


 

Meri&#39;s now at peace with the timing of the split and the way it played out. She accepts that she was surprised when her marriage ended. It was never something she saw happening to her marriage, especially when she married Kody 33 years ago. As she started building a family with Kody, the thought of it possibly ending in the future never crossed her mind. “You don’t know. You have no idea,” she confessed. Two years after her divorce, Meri became entangled in a catfish scandal. It strained her relationship with Kody until their December 2022 split. Meri had a six-month affair with someone named Sam Cooper.




Meri discovered that “Sam” was actually a woman named Jackie Overton. Kody called the incident a wake-up call for him and Meri. They tried couple’s therapy amid split rumors in 2019. Meri confirmed she and Kody ended their marriage during the Sister Wives: One-on-One Tell-All. Meri sparked romance rumors with a man known as JD Crawford after she posed with him for an Instagram selfie in August 2023. However, the Sister Wives star is not dating anyone right now and is focusing on growth and inner peace.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
