## Literature Review
Carla Gugino, who played Verna in The Fall of the House of Usher, admits there was one scene that she kept her from keeping her emotions in check.




There was one scene in The Fall of the House of Usher that made Carla Gugino emotional. Gugino plays Verna, the demon-like creature that agrees to a deal with Roderick and Madeline Usher that eventually claims the lives of every member of the House of Usher. Throughout the show, Verna regularly sits around in various forms, smiling and subtly tormenting the family members.




While Gugino elected to maintain an air of propriety and satisfaction throughout Verna&#39;s various murders, there was one killing that she couldn&#39;t help but show emotion for. In an interview with Collider, Gugino revealed that Lenore&#39;s death made her cry when she first read the script. While filming, she tried to keep it together, but she was forced to show emotions that she never intended to reveal. Check out Gugino&#39;s full quote below:


I think in a way Verna is executing her job, right? There’s, there’s no negotiating on her part. It’s like this deal was made, she is going to be a part of this deal. But I think that that for me, because I wept when I read that scene in the script, and it felt like for Verna, the key was the gift I can give you is for you to know that your decency, your big heart, your authenticity will have ramifications you will never know. So you’ve witnessed this family in the same way that the deal that they made with Verna is something that has horrible ramifications for a very long time. You are the opposite. And it just felt really important that I try my hardest to not have any emotion come out in that scene, and it just proved impossible. So thankfully, I was able not to sob.






 The Tragedy Of Lenore&#39;s Death 
         

Lenore was the one member of the House of Usher that was entirely innocent. While the others played with lives regularly and tormented innocent people in pursuit of wealth, Lenore was just an innocent trying her best to help those around her. The Fall of the House of Usher ending leaves Verna offering Lenore a peaceful and painless death, while reflecting on the difference that Lenore&#39;s life would make and the millions of lives that she would save.



The Fall of the House of Usher is based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe. Verna stands in for the bird from &#34;The Raven&#34;.




Despite being born into a family filled with cruelty, Lenore always tried to protect the lives of other people. Her actions would directly inspire Morelle to help save lives, rather than end them in the endless pursuit of wealth. The Lenore Foundation eventually helps countless people, but Lenore does not live to see it. Even Verna, who seemingly enjoyed bringing about the downfall of the Ushers, is emotional when she delivers Lenore&#39;s fate.




  2:01                       A 179-year-old Edgar Allan Poe Poem Reveals What Fall Of The House Of Usher&#39;s Verna Really Is   Netflix&#39;s The Fall of the House of Usher keeps Verna&#39;s identity a mystery but one hidden reference from an Edgar Allan Poe poem may have some answers.    

While Lenore&#39;s actions make the world a better place, Verna still regrets having to kill her. After all, Verna made her deal with two people who would gladly kill their entire family in the pursuit of wealth. She was well aware that she was targeting villainous people. In killing Lenore, she needed to take an innocent life, and her emotional response characterized her as a being with empathy. Verna may not have saved Lenore in The Fall of the House of Usher, but she helped to make her death worthwhile, and that made Gugino emotional.
