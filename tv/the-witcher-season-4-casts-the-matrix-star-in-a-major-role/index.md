## Literature Review
The Matrix star Laurence Fishburne has been cast in Netflix’s The Witcher season 4 as a major character from the books and video games.




The Witcher season 4 adds The Matrix star Laurence Fishburne to the cast in an important role. Based on the acclaimed book series by author Andrzej Sapkowski and the subsequent video games, the hit Netflix fantasy adaptation was first released in 2019, with Henry Cavill in the starring role of Geralt. The Witcher&#39;s cast is set to get some big updates in season 4, with Cavill departing as Geralt and Luke Hemsworth taking his place.




Now, as the wait continues for The Witcher season 4, Collider reports another big cast update in the form of Fishburne taking on the role of Regis. Fishburne is best known for playing Morpheus in The Matrix franchise and the Bowery King in the John Wick franchise. Regis, a major character in the books and video game franchise, is a 400-year-old higher vampire who serves as a barber-surgeon with a mysterious past.

  


 What To Expect From The Witcher Season 4 
          

Fishburne joins a number of familiar faces in season 4, with Anya Chalotra&#39;s Yennefer, Freya Allan&#39;s Ciri, and Joey Batey&#39;s Jaskier all returning. In terms of story, the new season is expected to pick up after The Witcher&#39;s season 3 finale, with Geralt on a mission to rescue Ciri. As in the books, he will be accompanied by his Hansa, which will seemingly include Regis, Jaskier, Milva (Meng’er Zhang), and Cahir (Eamon Farren), among others.




What remains to be seen, however, is whether season 4 can right the ship after season 3. After a series of popular and relatively well-received seasons, The Witcher season 3&#39;s reviews took a noticable dip, with viewers divided over how well the season tells its story and bids farewell to Cavill&#39;s take on the character (see the chart below comparing the seasons&#39; Rotten Tomatoes&#39; scores). Cavill was widely seen as one of the best parts of the show, and his absence could have a big impact on the series&#39; popularity. 

 Season  RT Critics Score  RT Audience Score   1  68%  89%   2  95%  55%   3  79%  19%   



With The Witcher season 4 reportedly set to start filming this month, a firm release date has still not been set, but it will likely premiere at some point in 2025. While not confirmed, the new season will probably feature 8 episodes, which would be in line with seasons 1 through 3. The Witcher season 4 will also not be serving as the show&#39;s last, with season 5 having already been announced.
