## Literature Review
Sister Wives pair Janelle and Kody Brown announced their separation in December 2022. Janelle is revealing what could have saved their marriage. 




Sister Wives star Janelle Brown is talking about the one thing that would have kept her married to Kody Brown. Sister Wives season 18 began exploring the relationship between Janelle and Kody as it reached the point of no return. Janelle and Kody were stepsiblings before they spiritually tied the knot in 1993. Kody’s father, Willian Winn Brown, and Janelle’s mother, Sheryl Brown, had been married for several years. Kody was married to his legal wife Meri Brown when he said, “I do,” to Janelle. Kody entered into a spiritual union with his third spouse, Christine Brown, a year later. Janelle and Kody welcomed their six children together.




In December 2022, Janelle revealed she and Kody had been separated for months. Janelle confirmed the news of her separation from Kody during the Sister Wives: One-on-One Tell-All special following season 17. Janelle became the second of Kody’s wives to leave him after Christine announced their split after spending more than 25 years together in November 2021. According to her and Christine’s joint interview with People, Janelle revealed that she would have stayed married to Kody if Christine had not split from him. “It was heartbreaking for me when Christine left because all of a sudden the family was this whole different identity,” Janelle said about Christine.

Janelle considered Christine to be a “big part” of what she perceived as the Brown family’s identity. Janelle revealed how her kids always gravitate towards Christine. They want her to be a part of their family’s biggest celebrations, including the holidays. Her decision to leave Kody meant that a “big heart” of Janelle’s family was being taken away. She stayed in the marriage for more than a year following Christine’s split because of her devotion to the family. Janelle felt like she should be loyal to the family that was remaining just out of obligation. “I think maybe if you hadn&#39;t have left, I might&#39;ve stuck it out,” Janelle told her sister wife.


 

Janelle’s and Kody’s relationship is standing on the brink of divorce in Sister Wives season 18. Janelle has yet to officially break up with Kody on the show. She is having a hard time accepting the nature of their relationship and hesitating while mentioning divorce. It’s quite likely that Kody and his wives would still have been together had he not added his fourth wife, Robyn Brown, into the mix. Robyn’s presence made Meri, Christine, and Janelle jealous, which eventually led to the slow demise of each of his relationships. Janelle was still the one who had the least problematic relationship with Kody.




Kody and Janelle both showed an interest in wanting to make things work on Sister Wives. Kody had already given up on Meri and had been unhappy with Christine starting to lose hope in polygamy. He wasn’t able to move on from Janelle. However, Janelle, who has now had a taste of freedom, is independent and not looking to get into any kind of relationship. She’s enjoying her single life and thriving as an Instagram influencer while she travels to exciting places. However, Janelle was with Kody for over 30 years, and it is going to take her a fair amount of time to heal and get over her past with the patriarch of the polygamous Brown family.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
