# Star Wars Hinted How Ahsoka s Lightsaber Droid Huyang Survived The Clone Wars... 7 Years Ago


## SUMMARY 



  Huyang, the droid from Star Wars: The Clone Wars, has survived Order 66 and could potentially help train a new generation of Jedi.   There is speculation that a research vessel from the Jedi Exploration Corps survived the purge and is located in the Unknown Regions.   Huyang could have been on this vessel and may encounter other Jedi survivors with Ahsoka in the future.

## Literature Review
A 7-year-old Star Wars detail could explain how Jedi architect droid Huyang survived Order 66 despite his important role as a lightsaber expert.




The Ahsoka Disney&#43; TV show brought back Huyang, a droid introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars - and it&#39;s already possible to deduce how he survived Order 66. Voiced by David Tennant, Huyang was an important figure in the Jedi Order, responsible for training Jedi younglings to build their first lightsabers. According to Star Wars: Timelines, Huyang is almost 25,000 years old, and has served the Jedi since shortly after their inception.




By the time of the Clone Wars, Huyang tended to accompany groups of Jedi younglings to the planet Ilum to collect kyber crystals as part of a sacred religion. Ahsoka has a record of at least 500 years&#39; worth of lightsaber construction, making him the perfect tutor. It was generally assumed that Huyang was targeted by Darth Vader and the clones during Order 66, but Ahsoka revealed this high-priority target - who could help train a new generation of Jedi - had survived.

 A Jedi Exploratory Corps Vessel May Have Survived Order 66 &amp; The Empire 
          

The Star Wars: Force &amp; Destiny sourcebook Savage Spirits revealed there was a branch of Jedi known as the Jedi Exploration Corps (or ExplorCorps). These focused on exploration and archaeological research, and were often out on the Outer Rim. Because they operated far away from the Jedi Temple, many didn&#39;t even know about the Clone Wars until well into the conflict. When word got out, many stayed away, thereby escaping Order 66. Despite this, many were still hunted down and killed by the Empire. However, according to Star Wars: Force and Destiny - Savage Spirits, there was a rumor that &#34;at least one of the ExplorCorps&#39; large research vessels survived the purge and is anchored in an unnamed system in the Unknown Regions.&#34;




                  Star Wars: The Clone Wars Episodes In Chronological Order (Correct Watch Order)   With Star Wars: The Clone Wars being released non-chronologically, you need the correct viewing order to make sense of its different plotlines.    



 Huyang Could Easily Have Been On This Vessel 
          

Because Huyang is a professor who traveled around training younglings and doing research, it is entirely possible that he could have been on this vessel. It would make complete sense for him to be with the ExplorCorps, training Jedi in the Outer Rim and beyond. This would explain how he survived even though he had highly valuable knowledge that could help rebuild the Jedi Order. Since he had a hand in training every Jedi youngling, he would have been well-known to the Empire through Darth Vader and a high-priority target, but he could have survived on this ship.




If Huyang was with the ExplorCorps, he and Ahsoka could run into more Jedi who survived the Jedi Purge. After all, he likely wasn&#39;t the ship&#39;s only survivor. Unless Huyang later took an escape pod or small ship to go off on his own and ran into Ahsoka that way, Ahsoka likely came across the vessel (or vice versa) and met those on board. Given the fact that Huyang is alone, it can be assumed that the rest of the Jedi Order members on the vessel either went into hiding or joined the Rebel Alliance in other squadrons. Either way, Ahsoka may feature some of these Jedi survivors.
