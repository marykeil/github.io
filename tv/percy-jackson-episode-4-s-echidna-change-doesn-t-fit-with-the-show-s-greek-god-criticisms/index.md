# Percy Jackson Episode 4 s Echidna Change Doesn t Fit With The Show s Greek God Criticisms


## SUMMARY 



  In the Percy Jackson series, Echidna&#39;s motives for attacking Percy are different from in the book, as she is pursuing him for her own personal gain rather than on the orders of Zeus.   The change in Echidna&#39;s motivations in the show makes less sense than in the book, as the series has consistently criticized the gods and their actions, so Zeus sending Echidna would have been fitting.   Having Echidna independently stalk Percy and Annabeth showcases her cleverness and highlights the cowardice and pettiness of the gods, who refuse to directly confront the demigods themselves.

## Literature Review
Percy Jackson and the Olympians introduced Echidna in episode 4, but her arrival brought with it a change from the books - a change that doesn&#39;t fit.





Summary

  In the Percy Jackson series, Echidna&#39;s motives for attacking Percy are different from in the book, as she is pursuing him for her own personal gain rather than on the orders of Zeus.   The change in Echidna&#39;s motivations in the show makes less sense than in the book, as the series has consistently criticized the gods and their actions, so Zeus sending Echidna would have been fitting.   Having Echidna independently stalk Percy and Annabeth showcases her cleverness and highlights the cowardice and pettiness of the gods, who refuse to directly confront the demigods themselves.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians is changing things up from the book in regard to Echidna, whose motivational changes don’t quite fit with the series’ Greek god criticisms. A faithful adaptation of Rick Riordan’s beloved novel finally landed on Disney&#43; (and Hulu), but while the new series carries the spirit of its source material, Echidna’s introduction in episode 4 isn’t entirely in line with her book counterpart.

In Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Echidna and her Chimera hunt Percy, Grover, and Annabelle while they’re on a train headed to the St. Louis Gateway Arch, an Athenian temple. Echidna tells Percy Jackson that she’s after them to help train the Chimera in sniffing out demigods. Echidna is the Mother of All Monsters, but her presence in the show’s fourth episode includes an alteration that, though minor, has a big enough effect on the story and her background. The live-action Echidna not only looks different from the book version, but her reasons for attacking are a bit more twisted and disparate than ever before.




                  Percy Jackson And The Olympians Season 2: Will It Happen? Everything We Know   Disney&#43;&#39;s take on Percy Jackson and The Olympians is already thrilling during its first season, but will there be more adventures in the future?    

  


 Percy Jackson Episode 4 Doesn&#39;t Reveal Echidna&#39;s Book Motive For Pursuing Percy 
          

While multiple mythological figures go after Percy, Grover, and Annabeth throughout the first four episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Echidna is chasing them for a very different reason. In the book, The Lightning Thief, Echidna goes after Percy because Zeus implores her to do so. In the show, Echidna is after Percy for her own personal gain and not because Zeus sent her on the job. Of course, episode 5 could reveal Zeus as the master planner behind Echidna’s actions, but the fact that Echidna actually criticized the gods and demigods suggests that she’s not aligned with them or even wishes to execute their nefarious plans.




Echidna’s reasons are solely her own, and she stalks Percy and Annabeth for the benefit of her own monstrous child. While Zeus and other gods are in conflict, Echidna likely realized their issues have nothing to do with her. What’s more, having her Chimera attack Percy, Grover, and Annabeth shows Echidna’s cleverness — the Mother of All Monsters is using the demigods’ quest, as well as them being out in the open, to her advantage.



 Zeus Sending Echidna After Percy Would Have Made Sense With The Show&#39;s Themes 
         

Despite Echidna doing her own thing in Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; episode 4, the change to her motivations actually makes less sense than in the book, especially as it pertains to the live-action’s themes. Percy Jackson and the Olympians has criticized the gods and the way they do things from the start, so Zeus sending Echidna to attack Percy would have made the utmost sense, considering how warped the gods have proven themselves to be. The trio fighting off Echidna and then sending her remains to Olympus the way they did with Medusa’s head would’ve been fitting.




This would have continued to show how ridiculous and awful the gods truly are, and how powerful a team the trio makes. The gods going after them underscores their cowardice, which has been pointed out a few times during the first few episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and Echidna being revealed as one of Zeus’ minions would have strengthened this argument. Echidna wouldn’t have been as independent of the gods, of course, but sending monsters after the trio is in concert with the likes of Zeus and Hades, who can’t be bothered to do anything directly despite being petty and angry.
