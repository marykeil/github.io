## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&#39;s Julio Moya is finally revealing why he didn&#39;t talk about Kirsten Schoemaker cheating on him on camera during season 5.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Julio Moya is finally telling fans why he kept Kirsten Schoemaker&#39;s &#34;affair&#34; a secret from the cameras on season 5. Julio is a reality TV star from Brentwood, New York. He is a world traveler but works as a DJ and a school safety officer for a living. Julio met Kirsten on Instagram and, after spending time together with her, decided he wanted to move to the Netherlands. He’d even filed his paperwork for it but had not told his mom. Julio broke up with Kirsten on FaceTime after telling her he needed to delay his move because of his family.




However, Julio claimed the real reason behind the split was trust issues during the Tell All Part 1 and is now revealing what happened between him and Kirsten on the 90 Day Fiancé Instagram page (as shared by u/8MCM1.)


 

Julio is now claiming that he found out Kirsten was cheating on him “right before filming” and they “chose not to talk about it.” Julio says he knew Kirsten would have to face “harsh” critics and found it difficult to handle the hate if she were to receive it. “I used 100 other reasons to not make the move and threw myself under the bus and she knew that,” wrote Julio in his shocking comment.

According to Julio, Kirsten decided to drag the situation after they broke up. He says he is finally speaking up with the “truth” and what really happened. Meanwhile, fans don’t agree with Julio’s claims, since his story doesn’t make sense at all. Redditor minivatreni wrote, “he has zero proof of her cheating apart from speculation.” Julio alleged that Kirsten had gone dress shopping when he was living in the Netherlands. She had a few photos from the shopping trip and one of them was a photo of a man. Julio said Kirsten told him, “Oh no, that’s that’s just a friend.”

He saw they were addressing each other as “Mami” and “Papi” in their messages. Kirsten mentioned that the man was a friend and nothing more. Julio claimed to have had a screen recording of the text exchange between Kirsten and the mystery man which Kirsten deleted from his phone. Meanwhile, the preview for the next episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way shows Kirsten claiming it was Julio who cheated on her and not the other way around. Julio going and defending himself on Instagram posts now suggests that he could be the one who’s to blame and is making Kirsten look like the bad guy on purpose.




Julio made a bad impression of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way fans when he suddenly decided he wanted time to come to the Netherlands but could never tell Kirsten when. As she wept while telling him she couldn’t wait forever for him to move, Julio laughed at her face. Kirsten felt insulted by Julio behaving in such a cheap way, and he’s gone out of his way to make her look like the villain on the Tell All as well. It’s easy to see that Julio is trying to find any way possible to save his already tarnished image.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
