Summary

  Percy Jackson episode 4 introduces new Greek mythological creatures such as the Echidna and Chimera, with the former teasing a major future villain.   Echidna makes a subtle mention of Gaia, hinting at a potential sequel series to Percy Jackson based on the Heroes of Olympus book series.   The teases at future villains, like Gaia and Kronos, are understated and add tension to the current story without overshadowing it.  







Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 hinted at a major villain for a sequel series, which could possibly mean 10 more seasons set in this universe. Aside from future teases, Percy Jackson episode 4 was packed with story reveals. The ending of Percy Jackson episode 3 left the titular character, Annabeth, and Grover continuing their quest to Los Angeles and the entrance to the Underworld, with episode 4 seeing the trio travel across the country on a train.

However, this train ride is quickly disturbed by the appearance of another pair of Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek mythological creatures. After encountering the Furies and Medusa in the episode prior, Percy Jackson episode 4 introduced the Chimera and the monster&#39;s mother, Echidna. During this confrontation and the ensuing chase, plenty of story reveals are divulged about the world of Percy Jackson, including Athena&#39;s judgment, Annabeth&#39;s backstory, and the tease of a future series that acts as a sequel to the original books by Rick Riordan.





 Percy Jackson Season 1 Is Already Setting Up The Heroes Of Olympus Sequel 
          

The tease found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 comes when Echidna mentions that her grandmother is also the great-grandmother of Percy. The character being referenced in this dialog is Gaia, the primordial goddess of the Earth, who serves as the primary villain of the Heroes of Olympus book series. After Percy Jackson&#39;s five books were released - the final one in 2009 - Rick Riordan began writing Heroes of Olympus as a sequel which also consisted of five books.

                  How Many Episodes Percy Jackson Season 1 Has Left &amp; When The Finale Is   Percy Jackson and the Olympians is already over halfway through season 1 on Disney&#43;, with only a few more outings to go before the finale.    

As such, the tease at Gaia found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4 could be hinting at nine more seasons with a 10th potentially being based on Percy Jackson and the Chalice of the Gods, a book released in 2023 set after Heroes of Olympus. While it remains likely that the four other Percy Jackson books will be adapted as Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; second, third, fourth, and fifth seasons, Echidna&#39;s line in episode 4 subtly sets up more stories to be told after that.






Future seasons of Percy Jackson and the Olympians are yet to be greenlit, though the promising updates from Rick Riordan and the high viewership numbers of season 1 make this likely.






 Percy Jacksonâ€™s Gaia Teases Match Season 1&#39;s Kronos Set-Up 
          

What makes the tease of Gaia found in Percy Jackson episode 4 that much better is that it matches the understated nature of Kronos&#39; set-up. While Gaia serves as the primary antagonist of Heroes of Olympus, Kronos is the central villain of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Thus far, the set-up of Kronos has been largely confined to dreams and smaller references that elevate the characters and story of Percy Jackson season 1 rather than overt, jarring foreshadowing.

The same can be said for Gaia, as the line from Echidna could easily be dubbed a throwaway reference to the interlinked relationships found in Greek mythology. The Gaia reference will only be caught by fans incredibly familiar with the Percy Jackson book universe, with the line serving as a way to add tension and stakes to the encounter with Echidna for those unaware of who Gaia is. As such, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4&#39;s teases at future villains remain suitably understated, so as to not take away from the story being told involving Percy, Annabeth, and Grover and their encounter with Echidna and the Chimera.




New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians release every Tuesday on Disney&#43;.
