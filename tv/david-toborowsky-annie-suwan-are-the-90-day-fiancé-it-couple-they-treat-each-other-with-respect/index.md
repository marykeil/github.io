## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé has introduced many couples in the past 10 years, but David Toborowsky and Annie Suwan are still one of the most iconic pairs.




David Toborowsky and Annie Suwan first debuted on 90 Day Fiancé in 2017, and they’re still one of the most loved couples in the franchise due to their modest personalities. Because David and Annie have a massive 24-year age difference, they didn’t seem compatible at first. David was called out for marrying a much younger woman and not being a good father to his own kids. Annie was also accused of getting hitched to an older man for ulterior motives. However, David and Annie have proved their critics wrong by showing their true love for each other.




In the past six years, the couple has shared many romantic moments on and off the screen that show that they understand and respect each other. Annie knows that David is over 55, and it would be a challenge for him to become a father in his old age. That’s why Annie has made peace with the possibility that she may never have children with David. At the same time, David loves Annie’s family in Thailand as much as he loves her. He was ready to take financial responsibility for his wife’s brother Jordan and cousin Amber if they came to the United States.

 David Doesn’t Talk Down To Annie 

 

There are many reasons David and Annie are admired by many 90 Day Fiancé fans. One of the reasons is how the American reality star talks to his Thailand-born wife. Recently, a Redditor Travellife84 shared how they found David’s behavior towards Annie “really lovely.” While watching 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk, the Redditor noticed how David explains “things to Annie that she doesn’t understand in such a non patronising way.” While viewers are used to watching the condescending tones of male stars like Colt Johnson and Bilal Hazziez towards their foreign partners, it’s refreshing to watch David’s humble attitude toward Annie. Perhaps his experience as an English teacher comes in handy when he explains things.






 David &amp; Annie Have Evolved As A Couple 
          

David and Annie have come a long way since their time on season 5. In the beginning, Annie expected David to give her parents a dowry, gold, and a water buffalo, equivalent to $23,000 to $25,000. David fulfilled his in-laws’ demands even though he didn’t have savings or a stable job. The couple started their married life in David&#39;s friend’s storage unit with almost no money. However, David and Annie have built wealth over the years. They run a successful online Thai clothing store and have bought two beach homes in Thailand. They also own a house in Arizona. David and Annie have become a thriving 90 Day Fiancé couple.



 Will David &amp; Annie Ever Return For Another 90 Day Fiancé Spin-off? 
          




Since David and Annie have a great sense of humor and excellent opinions about new couples, they are frequently featured on 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk. But they should return to 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? to share more details about their lives after marriage. However, David and Annie may not make a comeback as a lead couple because they’ve virtually no issues in their married life. Their social media pictures suggest they’re content, leaving little scope for drama that many 90 Day Fiancé viewers enjoy watching.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
