## Literature Review
A new rumor suggesting major character returns in Daredevil: Born Again is sparking joyous responses from Marvel fans in potentially fixing a mistake.




Following reports that the show would not feature two original characters, a new rumor suggests that Daredevil: Born Again is potentially fixing a major Marvel mistake. The Disney&#43; serves as a continuation of the Netflix Marvel Cinematic Universe title, picking up after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Hawkeye and Echo, in which Charlie Cox&#39;s Matt Murdock and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin returned to the franchise. Alongside Cox and D&#39;Onofrio, it has already been confirmed that Jon Bernthal&#39;s Punisher will be returning for Born Again, while Sandrine Holt has been set as a recast version of Fisk&#39;s wife, Vanessa, though various other Netflix character returns have remained unclear.




As production gears up to resume on the show, reporter Jeff Sneider took to Twitter with the rumor that Deborah Ann Woll&#39;s Karen Page and Elden Henson&#39;s Foggy Nelson would be returning for Daredevil: Born Again. In response to the rumors, MCU fans quickly flooded social media with celebratory responses to the characters&#39; returns, particularly after reports prior to the show&#39;s creative overhaul indicated that it would explain the duo had been killed offscreen in the years between the original Netflix Daredevil and the Disney&#43; title. Check out some of the reactions below:


 

User @MarvelIFacts celebrated by sharing a still of Karen, Foggy and Matt in the early office of Murdock &amp; Nelson, complete with their firm name on a piece of paper taped to the door.





 

@Kristina4109 shared a clip of a flashback with Matt and Foggy during their college years, expressing their joyous prancing as to how they would react if the rumor turns out to be true.


 

@TheWealthDad offered a breakdown of some of the biggest reasons why Born Again &#34;could be SPECIAL&#34;, including the confirmation of Jon Bernthal&#39;s Punisher returning, a writer from Bernthal&#39;s spinoff being hired as the showrunner following the creative overhaul and Loki directors Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson taking over the lead directorial duties.





 

@jonnyrubberman shared a GIF of Matt offering a subtle celebration in court for the show having &#34;the band back together&#34;.


 

@NickZednik praised Marvel head Kevin Feige for knowing &#34;when to read the room and listen to the fans&#34; by bringing the duo back for Born Again.


 




@MattsNetiPot acknowledged that while the casting is just a rumor until &#34;the trades confirm&#34; Karen and Foggy&#39;s return, the #SavedDaredevil movement has been key in keeping the hopes alive for the show to be revived properly.


 

@jellymelly1217 pondered whether Karen&#39;s return for the show alongside Bernthal&#39;s Punisher will result in a continuation of their romantic plotline from the Netflix Daredevil.


 

@ZapTV_Serie, on the other hand, expressed their desire for both Elodie Young&#39;s Elektra Nachios and Wilson Benthel&#39;s Bullseye to return for Born Again alongside Karen, Foggy and the other characters.





 

@CobraKaiNation also shared a GIF from the original show of Karen and Foggy drunkenly having fun together, feeling that fans of the show &#34;won&#34; after it was made MCU canon and the rumor of Foggy and Karen returning.


 Why Karen &amp; Foggy Are Vital For Daredevil: Born Again To Work 
         

While their castings haven&#39;t been officially confirmed by Marvel or Disney as of the time of writing, Karen and Foggy&#39;s potential return for Daredevil: Born Again would be yet another promising sign for the show&#39;s chance to recapture the success of Netflix&#39;s original. Across its three seasons, the duo served as important figures in Matt&#39;s overall growth on the show, both as a lawyer and as the titular vigilante. Foggy&#39;s reluctance to assist Matt was more than just a point of conflict for the lifelong friends, but actually pushed Cox&#39;s character to find better ways to serve justice than solely through brute force.




Karen, on the other hand, offered a more nuanced leg for Matt to stand on by challenging how he approaches his vigilante actions. Her defense of Bernthal&#39;s Punisher in Daredevil season 2 saw Cox&#39;s MCU hero forced to reckon with some of the moral complexities of his alter ego, namely how far he would go to put a stop to the criminals he fights. Upon realizing the hypocrisy of his desire to stop Frank Castle, Matt in turn ended up helping him uncover the government conspiracy he was made to be the scapegoat for and put him closer to the path of the antihero audiences know and love.

Though early plot details indicated that Daredevil: Born Again would see Matt and Wilson Fisk working together to best help the people of New York, the creative overhaul has made it unclear what the story will be for the Disney&#43; show, as well as how Karen and Foggy could fit in. That being said, considering how vital they were to much of the Netflix title&#39;s plot and how passionate the fanbase is to see the duo return, one can hope that Marvel confirms Woll and Hensen&#39;s castings and find a meaningful way to continue their arcs in Born Again.
