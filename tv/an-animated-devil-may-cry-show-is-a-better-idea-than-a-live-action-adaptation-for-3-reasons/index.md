# An Animated Devil May Cry Show Is A Better Idea Than A Live-Action Adaptation For 3 Reasons


## SUMMARY 



  The Devil May Cry animated series can capture the franchise&#39;s essence better than live-action adaptations due to its intense visuals and bombastic gameplay mechanics.   An animated adaptation allows the series to embrace the franchise&#39;s absurdly fun elements.   The success of other anime video game adaptations, such as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners and Castlevania, indicates a growing trend that an animated Devil May Cry show can be a game changer for video game adaptations on Netflix.

## Literature Review

The new Devil May Cry animated showâ€™s teaser looks promising, proving it was a better pick for the video game adaptation than a live-action series.




The trailer for Netflix&#39;s upcoming Devil May Cry animated series proves that adapting the beloved video game franchise to an animated format is a better way to reinterpret the iconic devil hunter&#39;s adventures than a live-action format. The series of fantasy action adventure Capcom video games, Devil May Cry, sees the half-human half-demon Dante embark on action-packed quests to defend Earth from constant demon threats while also discovering new revelations about his family&#39;s history. Even though many games are receiving live-action adaptations, Devil May Cry proves this is not always the best choice.




Dante&#39;s younger appearance in the trailer suggests that the new series will start with his early days as a demon hunter before aging him up and raising the stakes along the way. Despite the limited information available regarding the upcoming series&#39; store, a 2021 update on The Devil May Cry animated series confirmed it would feature Dante, Virgil, and Lady, thus lending further credence to its events taking place sometime during Dante&#39;s Awakening. Irrespective of the limited details, the teaser for the animated series already proves why animation is a better fit for the series than live-action.


 


 An Animated Devil May Cry Show Can Capture The Essence Of The Games More Effectively 
The Devil May Cry franchise is known for its intense visuals and bombastic gameplay.
         




Among many things, the Devil May Cry franchise is loved for its insane gameplay mechanics that see protagonist Dante perform incredible feats, such as running up walls, stopping time, and even using enemies as skateboards, all in the service of dishing out his signature brand of justice on the various demonic threats to Earth. As seen with the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise and HBO&#39;s The Last of Us TV series, live-action video game adaptations are getting considerably better, but Devil May Cry is simply too abstract for a live-action adaptation to do it justice.

Furthermore, the Devil May Cry franchise already suffered a considerable blow to its reputation back in 2003 with Devil May Cry 2&#39;s serious approach to storytelling that leaned more into realistic mechanics and storytelling than the more outrageous nature and aesthetics of most entries in the franchise. An animated adaptation of Devil May Cry not only leaves the door open for the series to lean more into the franchise&#39;s absurdly fun elements, but it also provides Netflix with a unique opportunity to improve on the efforts made by the 2007 limited Japanese anime.






 The Devil May Cry Animated Series Can Bring Back The Classic Voice Actors 
Dante&#39;s voice actor Rueben Langdon was the only original cast member in the 2007 anime
          

The 2007 Japanese limited series, Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, received mixed reviews. Dante&#39;s characterization was praised, but the writing and minimal fight scenes contributed to the series feeling more like a melodrama than a proper fantasy action-adventure series the video games are known for. Additionally, some characters, like Lady and Trish&#39;s roles were considerably reduced, thus paving the way for better characterizations in the Netflix Devil May Cry series. While Devil May Cry: The Animated Series only included Dante&#39;s voice actor Reuben Langdon, the new show can redeem this mistake.



Cyberpunk: Edgerunners won anime of the year in 2023, and that&#39;s largely because it was able to craft an engaging story that contributed to expanding the game&#39;s already dense lore.







Across five main titles in the Devil May Cry franchise, the voice acting remains some of the best in gaming history as it employs the services of some of the industry&#39;s best voice actors and film &amp; TV actors, each of whom offers something distinct and unique to their characters. While a live-action version of Devil May Cry would be in no short supply of quality actors to depict the events on the small screen, finding actors who can convincingly look and sound like the unique characters would prove to be particularly difficult, thus potentially ruining engagement for longtime fans.



 There&#39;s A Growing Trend Of Anime Video Game Adaptations 
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners won Crunchyroll&#39;s Anime of the Year in 2023.
          

Cyberpunk: Edgerunners won anime of the year in 2023, and that&#39;s largely because it was able to craft an engaging story that contributed to expanding the game&#39;s already dense lore. Additionally, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&#39; beautiful animation and quality voice-acting exposed viewers familiar with the Cyberpunk video games to different ways of interpreting the rich world and complex themes. The new Devil May Cry animated show could carry the momentum of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&#39; success, thus leading to other beloved video games receiving animated reworking of their characters and stories.




Furthermore, the recent success of Netflix&#39;s Castlevania shows also displays that video games, etc. can thrive in the world of animation if the proper care is applied to the well-established lore and characters that made the original franchise&#39;s successes to begin with. Devil May Cry is already a well-known and established IP, and an animated TV show devoted to crafting engaging stories, reinterpreting the characters in thoughtful ways, and respecting the source material that it&#39;s based on can be a game changer for video game adaptations.



Devil May Cry will be available on Netflix sometime in 2024.
