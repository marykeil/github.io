## Literature Review

The way a pilot sets the tone and introduces the characters matters in the long run, and some episodes, likes Supernatural&#39;s pilot, are exemplary.




A TV show pilot is the make-it-or-break-it moment for a new series, so it is vital for the first episode to both be a comprehensive story from start to finish and leave audiences and, most importantly, the network wanting more. While a pilot is allowed to be a draft of the future series when it comes to storylines and characters, it is even better if it ends up being the closest representation of the show. For instance, Scrubs&#39; pilot titled &#34;My First Day&#34; accurately set the scene for the medical comedy-drama.
Not every series is as lucky as Scrubs with their first episode, but that doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t find success later on. Parks and Recreation&#39;s pilot is its lowest-rated episode for a good reason, and yet the show ran for seven seasons and is still considered to be one of the funniest modern sitcoms to this day. Great first episodes often go underappreciated, so it is high time to give credit where it is due — from Supernatural and Game of Thrones to Community and Californication, there are quite a few shows that have absolutely outdone themselves with their pilots.

Some of the most iconic TV couples, like Barney and Robin, weren&#39;t in the showrunners&#39; original plan, but destiny and chemistry brought them together.












 








 10  &#34;Pilot&#34; 
Supernatural


 







  Supernatural  


  Cast    Jensen Ackles , Misha Collins , Jim Beaver , Jared Padalecki , Katie Cassidy , Lauren Cohan , Mark A. Sheppard , Mark Pellegrino , Alexander Calvert     Seasons    15    


Supernatural&#39;s &#34;Pilot&#34; is solely responsible for the continued popularity of the show that allowed it to stay on air for 15 years. It had everything — compelling leads, a fascinating mystery, and gruesome murders. Not only did the first episode hint at the bigger story arc without giving too much away, but it also made Sam and Dean tragic characters that were easy to empathize with. The pilot determined the initial dynamic between the Winchester brothers that would fuel the plot for a few seasons, and Jessica&#39;s death in the closing scene raised the stakes for the future episodes of Supernatural.





 9  &#34;Winter Is Coming&#34; 
Game of Thrones
        

  Game Of Thrones  


  Cast    Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage     Seasons    8    


Game of Thrones had viewers hooked from the first episode because it was a thrilling forbidden epic adventure from beginning to end. In the final scene, Bran discovered Jaime and Cersei&#39;s affair and paid a high price for it. As shocking as the twist was, it served its purpose by demonstrating what kind of show Game of Thrones strove to be. In addition, &#34;Winter Is Coming&#34; managed to effortlessly introduce all the major players who would shape the story up until Game of Thrones&#39; controversial ending. The pilot was a lot to take in, but it flawlessly set the stage.





 8  &#34;Pilot&#34; 
Californication
        

  Californication  


  Cast    David Duchovny , Madeleine Martin     Seasons    7    


With all its offensive language, the glorification of substance abuse, and straight-up pedophilia, Californication hasn&#39;t aged particularly well by today&#39;s standards. All that aside, &#34;Pilot&#34; did a great job of showcasing what the story would be about and how scandalous it would be. Hank Moody was never a good person, and he certainly wasn&#39;t a role model in the pilot, and yet the first episode, with a lot of help from David Duchovny, succeeded in making the struggling messed-up writer a somewhat likable character who was easy to root for.





 7  &#34;Chapter One: The Vanishing Of Will Byers&#34; 
Stranger Things
        

  Stranger Things  


  Cast    Finn Wolfhard , joe keery , Jamie Campbell Bower , Brett Gelman , Caleb McLaughlin , Maya Hawke , David Harbour , Matthew Modine , Priah Ferguson , Gaten Matarazzo , Winona Ryder , Charlie Heaton , Sadie Sink , Millie Bobby Brown , Joseph Quinn , Dacre Montgomery , Natalia Dyer , Noah Schnapp     Seasons    4    


Stranger Things had an amazing season 1 that started on a high note and ended on a higher one. &#34;Chapter One: The Vanishing of Will Byers&#34; expertly brought back the nostalgia for the 1980s, introduced the core crew of preteen detectives, including the mysterious Eleven, and even featured an unnerving plot twist in the form of Benny&#39;s murder. The Duffer brothers&#39; brilliant writing made the first episode truly outstanding — the drama thickened with every minute, the attack on Eleven&#39;s savior foreshadowed her horrific backstory, and Hawkins&#39; eerie atmosphere was established.





 6  &#34;Pilot&#34; 
Desperate Housewives


 







  Desperate Housewives  


  Cast    marcia cross , Felicity Huffman , Eva Longoria     Seasons    8    


Desperate Housewives&#39; &#34;Pilot&#34; defied all expectations from the start, as it began with a suicide. This was an uncommon move, but it paid off in a big way because the aftermath of Mary Alice&#39;s death allowed the show to keep the grave tone that suited it so well. The first episode cleverly showed off the residents of Wisteria Lane and hinted at each of the main characters&#39; struggles that they came to reevaluate in light of recent events. The series&#39; pilot set the standard quite high, but the show was able to keep up with it up until Desperate Housewives&#39; explosive ending.





 5  &#34;That &#39;70s Pilot&#34; 
That 70s Show
        

  That &#39;70s Show  


  Cast    Topher Grace , Laura Prepon , Mila Kunis , Ashton Kutcher , Wilmer Valderrama , Debra Jo Rupp , Kurtwood Smith , Danny Masterson     Seasons    8    


That &#39;70s Show may have run in the 2000s, but the 1970s atmosphere was present all throughout, and it started with the pilot. The episode itself wasn&#39;t particularly original, but it had all the key ingredients for success — Eric and Donna as a wholesome couple-to-be; Kelso, Hyde, and Jackie as the rest of the chaotic gang; Kitty and Red as the relatable married couple; and the Vista Kruiser as the signature element. In &#34;That &#39;70s Pilot,&#34; Eric and Donna shared their first kiss, and Kelso and Jackie their first almost-split, and both of these dynamics would prove to be long-standing.





 4  &#34;Pilot&#34; 
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
        

  Brooklyn Nine-Nine  


  Cast    Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio     Seasons    8    


Brooklyn Nine-Nine was famous for its lighthearted tone and fast-paced storytelling, and all the groundwork was laid in its pilot episode. Captain Raymond Holt took over the 99th Precinct, and the lives of the detectives changed overnight, with new dynamics emerging. The relationships that had been there before the start of the show and those that were formed in &#34;Pilot&#34; went on to become the driving force of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. What&#39;s more, the first episode was when Jake and Amy&#39;s relationship had a shake-up that would lead to their future romance.





 3  &#34;A Study In Pink&#34; 
Sherlock


 







  Sherlock  


  Cast    Martin Freeman , Benedict Cumberbatch , Rupert Graves     Seasons    4    


Sherlock&#39;s writing was exquisite from its first episode. &#34;A Study in Pink&#34; demonstrated everything there was to know about Britain&#39;s greatest detective, welcomed John Watson into his life, and even established a larger story arc with the mention of Moriarty at the very end. The pilot also laid the foundations of Sherlock&#39;s visual style and language, specifically the way Sherlock Holmes processed information and used his famous deduction techniques, which became the show&#39;s distinguishing feature. In its first episode, the series already separated itself from its source material while still staying respectful to it.





 2  &#34;My First Day&#34; 
Scrubs
        

  Scrubs  


  Cast    John C. McGinley , Robert Maschio , Donald Faison , Christa Miller , Neil Flynn , Judy Reyes , Aloma Wright , Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Sam Lloyd , Ken Jenkins     Seasons    9    


Scrubs&#39; first episode is arguably one of the best comedy pilots out there, and it was likely the reason the show gained the status of a cult classic. In just 20 minutes, &#34;My First Day&#34; set the scene at the main location, the Sacred Heart Hospital, gave an overview of the main characters, and even launched J.D. and the Janitor&#39;s legendary rivalry. Scrubs&#39; unique daydreaming sequences began with the pilot as well. Plus, the first episode established the type of humor that the series would later be praised for.





 1  &#34;Pilot&#34; 
Community
        

  Community  


  Cast    Ken Jeong , Chevy Chase , Joel McHale , Jim Rash , Gillian Jacobs , Alison Brie , Yvette Nicole Brown , Donald Glover , Danny Pudi     Seasons    6    


Community&#39;s &#34;Pilot&#34; wasn&#39;t as &#34;niche&#34; as the rest of the series — on the contrary, it eased viewers into the weirdness step by step. However, all the important parts were figured out then and there. The wonderfully diverse study group was formed, the show&#39;s meta humor took center stage, and the shenanigans began. Community was a silly series in the best sense of the word, as it didn&#39;t treat anything or anyone too seriously, which was both its unique hook and its biggest disadvantage — and Britta was its victim. The experimental storytelling trend started with the pilot.
