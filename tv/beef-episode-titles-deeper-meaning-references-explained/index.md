 10  The Birds Don’t Sing, They Screech in Pain 
Episode 1


 







“The trees are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don’t think they sing. They just screech in pain…” — Werner Herzog 

The title of Beef episode 1 &#34;The Birds Don&#39;t Sing, They Screech In Pain&#34; is directly inspired by this quote from renowned German filmmaker Werner Herzog. The quote was taken from Herzog&#39;s 1982 documentary Burden of Dreams which chronicled the challenging process of making his epic film Fitzcarraldo (1982). There are numerous references to crows throughout Beef but the quote and episode title have more to do with the internal misery and rage that get released through both Yeun&#39;s Danny Cho and Wong&#39;s Amy Lau onscreen.





 9  The Rapture Of Being Alive 
Episode 2
        

“I don’t think the meaning of life is what we’re seeking. I think it’s the experience of being alive… so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” — Joseph Campbell 

Beef episode 2&#39;s title “The Rapture of Being Alive” is a reference to a direct quote from famous author Joseph Campbell, who is best known for identifying the 12-step hero&#39;s journey mythic structure. In Beef episode 2, the layers of both Danny and Amy&#39;s lives begin to peel after their road rage encounter, which starts to make small cracks in their home and day-to-day lives. This reveals that both Danny and Amy are dissatisfied and are seeking to experience life in new ways, beginning with their back-and-forth feud.





 8  I Am Inhabited By A Cry 
Episode 3
        

“I am inhabited by a cry. Nightly it flaps out. Looking, with its hooks, for something to love.” — Sylvia Plath 

The title of Beef episode 3 &#34; I Am Inhabited By A Cry&#34; is a direct quote from acclaimed novelist and poet Sylvia Plath from her poem &#34;Elm&#34;. The lines above from Plath&#39;s &#34;Elm&#34; seem to carry some of the symbolism of both the first and second episode titles, combining the themes of birds with the sentiments of inner turmoil and existential longing. This alludes to how Danny and Amy are both feeling by Beef episode 3 as the audience has been exposed to each of their dark inner worlds and how they desperately wish to escape from them.





 7  Just Not All At The Same Time 
Episode 4
        

“You can have it all, just not all at the same time.” — Betty Friedan 

Beef episode 4&#39;s title &#34;Just Not All At The Same Time&#34; references a direct quote from prominent feminist activist and author Betty Friedan. Friedan made this statement during a conference within the context of responding to the question &#34;Can women have it all?&#34; In Beef episode 4, Amy is on stage at a Q&amp;A panel in Las Vegas, which notably goes terribly wrong once Danny shows up. Amy appears to have it all: the perfect house, husband, and profession, but Danny is there to remind her that she can&#39;t have it all.
            
 
 10 Most Shocking Moments in Beef 
Netflix&#39;s new dark dramedy, Beef, starring Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, has a gripping and twisted plot that includes some genuinely shocking moments.









 6  Such Inward Secret Creatures 
Episode 5
        

“We are such inward secret creatures, that inwardness the most amazing thing about us, even more amazing than our reason.” — Iris Murdoch 

The title of Beef episode 5 “Such Inward Secret Creatures” is a reference to Iris Murdoch&#39;s novel The Sea. The quote alludes to the notion that people are deeply secretive and concealing of who they really are, what they actually think, and what they truly want, choosing to keep all of these things tucked away inside. This is a theme that is consistent in just about every character in Beef, who all have fabricated external personas and self-serving ulterior motives, whether it be George&#39;s secret relationship or Naomi taking advantage of her friendship with Amy.





 5  We Draw A Magic Circle 
Episode 6
        

“We draw a magic circle and shut out everything that doesn’t agree with our secret games.” — Ingmar Bergman 

The philosophical points of Beef are again reflected in episode 6&#39;s title &#34;We Draw A Magic Circle&#34;. The title references a quote from another acclaimed filmmaker, this time the Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman (The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries). The quote above was taken from another one of Bergman&#39;s celebrated films, the deeply reflective Through A Glass Darkly (1961). In the context of Beef, it pertains to how the characters view themselves and their subsequent stubbornness and convictions living within their &#34;magic circles&#34;, holding onto denial rather than facing the truth of themselves.





 4  I Am a Cage 
Episode 7
        

“I am a cage, in search of a bird.” — Franz Kafka 

Beef episode 7 &#34;I Am A Cage&#34; references a quote from famous novelist Franz Kafka, who is known for his works such as The Trial and The Metamorphosis that exceptionally combine elements of realism and surrealism. Once again, the deeper meaning of Beef&#39;s titles refers to bird symbolism and the concepts of residential dissatisfaction and the longing for more in life. This line, taken from Kafka&#39;s Die Zürauer Aphorismen, highlights the feelings of being lost and devoid of substance in both Danny and Amy at this point in Beef, which is why Danny returns to church and Amy opens up emotionally to George.
            
 
 Did Paul Die In Beef? 
Danny thought Paul got shot by police in Beef episode 9, but a text from Paul&#39;s phone upended everything and hinted Paul could still be alive.









 3  The Drama Of Original Choice 
Episode 8
        

“The drama of original choice is that it goes on moment by moment for an entire lifetime, that it occurs without reason, before any reason, that freedom is there as if it were present only in the form of contingency.” — Simone de Beauvoir 

Beef episode 8 &#34;The Drama of Original Choice&#34; refers to the book The Ethics of Ambiguity by feminist author Simone de Beauvoir. The author&#39;s passage essentially arrives at the notion that people&#39;s lives and characters are ultimately a result of their free will and not some predetermined script set by an all-powerful God, which makes the truth of one&#39;s failures much more difficult to accept. It also alludes to the idea that many choices are made within the contexts of the past and environmental conditions, which for Amy and Danny, explains a lot as Beef episode 8 dives into their individual backstories.





 2  The Great Fabricator 
Episode 9
        

“Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be obtained only by someone who is detached.” — Simone Weil 

The title of Beef episode 9 &#34;The Great Fabricator&#34; references an idea articulated by the French philosopher and mystic Simone Weil, who spoke on the concept of attachment as a buffer from the truest form of reality. This aligns with general Buddhist ideals that denounce attachment to material things, societal expectations, and even the unenlightened in order to access a more spiritual and &#34;true&#34; understanding through detachment. This directly contrasts with the previous symbolism of the titles which profess a deep desire to become attached to something of value while also referencing the familial losses that both Danny and Amy experience in the episode.





 1  Figures of Light 
Episode 10
        

“One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.” ― C.G. Jung 

The Buddhist themes of dettachment hinted at in Beef episode 9&#39;s title take form in Beef episode 10 &#34;Figures Of Light&#34;. The title directly references a quote that renowned Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung stated in his Alchemical Studies Volume 13. Jung points to the idea that reconciling with oneself and finding peace requires activating and analyzing the dark source of the negativity from within rather than getting &#34;blinded by the light&#34; of hollow wishful thinking. Both Danny and Amy, trapped together in the desert in the Beef finale, have no choice but to face their demons head-on, which finally allows them the opportunity to grow as people and find lasting contentment.
