Summary

  Finally, after all the anticipation, the winner of The Golden Bachelor is revealed by Reality Steve: Gerry Turner gets engaged to Theresa Nist!   According to reliable sources, Gerry chooses Theresa out of his final two women, leaving Leslie Fhima behind on the show.   The secret is out! The Golden Bachelor&#39;s happily ever after lies with Theresa, as confirmed by Reality Steve&#39;s insider information. Engagement bells are ringing!  







After months of speculation, Reality Steve has finally revealed who wins The Golden Bachelor. Gerry Turner will leave the show engaged to one of his final two women, Leslie Fhima or Theresa Nist. After a week of overnight dates, Gerry left the dates unsure who he would get engaged to at the end. He&#39;s been very emotional about his impending final decision, making it almost seem like he&#39;ll leave the show alone. However, Reality Steve believes Gerry does leave the show engaged to this lucky woman.

Reality Steve revealed on his Instagram that, according to his sources, Gerry ends the show engaged to Theresa. &#34;It&#39;s taken a while, but I finally have been able to find out who Gerry chose...&#34; he wrote on one of the slides.


 

Following this slide, Steve confirms that Theresa is the one Gerry proposes to during the season finale, which airs on November 30, 2023. Viewers will have to wait over a week to find out if Steve&#39;s spoilers are true or not.

 Gerry Proposes During The Golden Bachelor Finale 
          

Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, fans of The Golden Bachelor will have to wait for Gerry to get down on one knee and propose to Theresa until later next week. Along with the final rose ceremony and a proposal, there will be the iconic After The Final Rose special where Gerry, and presumably Theresa, will talk to host Jesse Palmer about their new relationship post-show. Leslie will likely also be there to hash things out with Gerry, putting an end to their sweet romance on The Golden Bachelor.

Since the beginning of The Golden Bachelor, fans have been wondering who Gerry was going to propose and give his final rose to. Theresa was a front-runner from the start as she received Gerry&#39;s first one-on-one date of the season. The pair enjoyed a car ride in a vintage convertible and later spent some time at a 50s-inspired diner. It was pretty obvious that she could potentially win from the beginning.




During The Golden Bachelor finale, which will air on November 30, viewers will finally get to watch Gerry get engaged. He&#39;s been through a lot in the past few years after losing his wife and is ready to get his second chance at love. Gerry and Theresa seem like a great couple, so their relationship could really go the distance.



The Golden Bachelor finale air on November 30 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
