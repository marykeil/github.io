Summary

  Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s portrayal of Wilson Fisk in Echo showcases a more paternal and manipulative side of the character, exploring his relationship with Maya and the intense dynamics between them.

Picking up after the events of Hawkeye, Echo sees Maya Lopez on the run from Wilson Fisk&#39;s organization. To evade them, she returns to her hometown in Oklahoma. Maya will need to face her past while there, reconnecting with her roots and embracing the community she left behind.




Marion Dayre created Echo, with Sydney Freeland attached as an executive producer and director. The series will feature Vincent D&#39;Onofrio and Charlie Cox returning as fan favorites Wilson Fisk and Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil. Echo stars Alaqua Cox, Chaske Spencer, Tantoo Cardinal, Devery Jacobs, Zahn McClarnon, Cody Lightning, and Graham Greene.

                  Does The MCU&#39;s Wilson Fisk Know Matt Murdock Is Daredevil?   Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil is back in the MCU and so is his nemesis, Wilson Fisk, but will Kingpin know Daredevil&#39;s identity in Born Again?    

Screen Rant interviewed Vincent D’Onofrio about his role in Echo. He teased Wilson Fisk&#39;s place in the MCU and why he enjoys the more mature tone in Echo when playing the character. D’Onofrio also explained why it was important to show how deeply Fisk cares for certain people in the series and how that affects his relationship with Maya.


 Vincent D’Onofrio Talks Echo 
         




Screen Rant: Mr. D’Onofrio, you are amazing as an actor, and I love seeing you in this role as Wilson Fisk. We&#39;ve seen a different side of Fisk with Maya. He&#39;s more of a father figure, but very manipulative. Fisk has taught her violence, fear, and intimidation instead of love and respect. Can you talk about how their journey is explored throughout this season of Echo?


Vincent D’Onofrio: I think that he goes through a lot trying to get her back no matter what she&#39;s done to get away from him. And I think that it ends up to be a kind of very father-daughter trepidatious period for them, to say the least. And it gets very intense. It gets emotionally violent and physically violent.


This is the first time we see how great Wilson Fisk has power outside of New York. How far does his reach stretch?


Vincent D’Onofrio: Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s something that we&#39;re going to continue to deal with when it comes to Wilson Fisk in every way. Not just Echo, but in every way. So, I can&#39;t really answer that question.





Has your approach or understanding of the character of Wilson Fisk changed throughout your course of playing the character?


Vincent D’Onofrio: Well, I&#39;m an actor, so I have to service the story that&#39;s put in front of me. I have to do my best to make the story written work. And so there&#39;s a lot of different directions that when you&#39;re servicing a story that you go in from one series to another. I think that while I was doing Echo, I realized that there&#39;s a tone in Echo, a mature tone where I believed that my characters presented best in.
I felt like the reason why I recognized that is because while we were performing it, I realized that whether the audience had ever seen the original Daredevil or not, they&#39;re going to get that same feeling as they did in Daredevil when I first come on screen. They&#39;re going to feel uneasy about him, and I think Fisk works best in that kind of tone.


          




What are you excited to explore with Wilson Fisk carrying over from Echo to Daredevil: Born Again, and what have you learned about yourself through playing Wilson Fisk?


Vincent D’Onofrio: I&#39;m no different obviously than any other actor, than my friends and other actors and actresses out there. We fail, and we succeed, and we fail, and we succeed constantly in every performance. And it&#39;s just a learning process for me always. I&#39;m always evolving as an actor and sticking my neck as far as I can out there to try and do the best job I can. Sometimes I fail, sometimes I succeed. It&#39;s all the same to me. It&#39;s just this kind of constant evolution of stretching my abilities and trying to service the stories correctly. It&#39;s a constant, it never ends.


I was talking with Brad earlier about your character, Kingpin, and how he&#39;s almost this street-level version of Thanos where everything is kind of converging to this character. Which heroes would you like to see Wilson Fisk face off against in this pocket of the MCU?





Vincent D’Onofrio: All of them.


That&#39;s absolutely a great answer. What did you want to bring to Wilson Fisk on this season of Echo that wasn&#39;t on the page?


Vincent D’Onofrio: I wanted there to be an emotional life first. His connection to Maya. I wanted to remind people, if they had seen the original Daredevil, that he can care for people in a real way. And if they didn&#39;t see Daredevil before, that this character can care for people in a certain way. And so that was one important aspect because without that, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s as scary or as interesting.
