## Literature Review

Sister Wives Meri Brown may have left her marriage to Kody Brown behind, but her time in Utah just got much busier with the addition of her dog, Zona.




Sister Wives star Meri Brown may not be married to Kody Brown anymore, but her life is even fuller after her divorce now that she’s adopted her new pet dog, Zona. Meri’s life has changed tremendously since she was first introduced on Sister Wives in 2010. After being married to Kody for over 20 years, Meri, Janelle Brown, and Christine Brown chose to open up their family to public criticism when they chose to put their lives on reality TV. Meri and Kody’s relationship appeared stable in the early seasons of Sister Wives, but it became clear the couple were facing issues as the series got into its recent years.




Kody and Meri’s relationship began to get rocky after Meri’s catfishing scandal, when she was coerced into an emotional affair with a stranger and exposed. Though they tried to work through their problems, it became apparent very quickly that Kody was growing distant and uninterested in fixing things with Meri. Though it took her some years to understand there was no going back, Meri finally understood that her relationship was over by the end of Sister Wives season 18. She left Kody and his only remaining wife, Robyn Brown, behind to start a new life at her B&amp;B in Utah.
