## Literature Review
Jennice Ontiveros was the first female deckhand to appear on Below Deck season 2. The reality star has been keeping busy since leaving the Bravo show.




Jennice Ontiveros made history as the first female deckhand on Below Deck season 2, and there&#39;s curiosity surrounding what she&#39;s up to today. Even though Jennice only lasted one season, she was involved in a lot of the drama aboard superyacht Ohana, including a complicated boatmance with another crew member. The former yachtie had her share of struggles as the only woman working on deck and paved the way for future female deckhands on the series. In anticipation of Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to catch up with Jennice.




On Below Deck, Jennice was a kind and hardworking deckhand. She felt like an outcast as the only woman on the deck team due to her shorter height and inability to carry heavy items. When Jennice was helping the other male deckhands set up a water slide, she was frustrated because they didn&#39;t have enough crew members to complete the task. Jennice was also pursued romantically by Kelley Johnson. Since Jennice had a boyfriend then, she tried to avoid flirting with Kelley despite being tempted by his good looks and charming personality. After turning Kelley down many times, Jennice couldn&#39;t hide her feelings anymore and followed her heart.


 Jennice and Kelley&#39;s Relationship Fell Apart 
          

During a crew night out on Kelley&#39;s birthday, Jennice looked after Kelley while he was drunk and stayed in his cabin with him. Their relationship moved quickly afterward, and they were inseparable for the rest of the charter season. When the Below Deck reunion came around, Jennice and Kelley weren&#39;t on good terms and had a messy breakup.




Jennice wanted Kelley to move in with her when they returned to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but Kelley wasn&#39;t ready for that commitment. The deckhands were involved in a social media war, and Kelley allegedly wrote negative comments about Jennice online. Jennice also mentioned that Kelley called her &#34;ugly&#34; and didn&#39;t treat her respectfully when they were together.



 Jennice&#39;s Life Has Improved Since Kelley Breakup 

 

With all the Below Deck drama behind her, Jennice seems content after exiting reality TV. The former Bravo star left yachting and now works in the entertainment industry. Jennice is a narrator and does voiceover work for the documentary Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which streams on Hulu and Fox.

According to IMDb, she also has producer credits for the YouTube Original series Create Together and School of Chocolate on Netflix. Jennice describes herself as a &#34;recovering nomad&#34; on her Instagram bio but calls Los Angeles, California, her home base. The Below Deck star loves to travel and recently went to Iceland. Jennice visited many scenic places like the capital city of ReykjavÃ­k and the Blue Lagoon spa. Jennice&#39;s Instagram page shows no proof of her being in a romantic relationship, so she is most likely single.




Jennice is now living a less dramatic lifestyle after appearing on Below Deck, especially since she went through a complicated relationship on reality TV. Viewers will never forget Jennice and appreciate how she stood up for herself and set a positive example as a strong, independent woman. The beloved deckhand significantly impacted the show but is better off staying away from the Bravo cameras. Fans can watch this Below Deck fan-favorite deckhand through social media to see what exciting projects she dives into next.
