# First Young Sheldon Season 7 Premiere Image Confirms Missys New Role


## SUMMARY 



  Missy&#39;s new role in Young Sheldon&#39;s season 7 is part of her redemption arc after years of being sidelined and ignored.   Missy&#39;s rebellious behavior in season 6 was a reflection of the show&#39;s attempt to address past criticisms of her character&#39;s handling.   With the shorter run of season 7 and the impending death of George, Missy&#39;s redemption won&#39;t be easy, but she thrives when given responsibilities and steps up in times of crisis.

## Literature Review
CBS releases the first Young Sheldon season 7 premiere image and it shows Missy&#39;s new expanded role coming into the prequel&#39;s final year. 




The new Young Sheldon season 7 premiere image reveals Missy&#39;s new role in The Big Bang Theory prequel. George and Mary&#39;s only daughter was sidelined and ignored for years until she started misbehaving in season 6. Missy went to great lengths to ensure that she finally gets the attention of her family, but when Young Sheldon season 7 debuts, it seems like she will have an entirely new persona as part of her redemption arc.




CBS (via TV Line) releases the first image of the Young Sheldon season 7 premiere, &#34;Half a Wiener Schnitzel and Underwear in a Tree.&#34;

          

The image shows the remainder of the Cooper family in Medford in the aftermath of the tornado. Interestingly, Missy takes over Mary&#39;s spot at the dinner table.


 How Missy’s New Role Impacts Young Sheldon Season 7 
          

Feeling left out while Sheldon received most of the attention from their family, Missy started to act out — intentionally endangering herself. This got Mary and George to shift focus to her. However, painting her as a rebellious teen walked back years of her being the most emotionally mature member of Sheldon Cooper&#39;s family. 




                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Is Finally Fixing Missy After Wasting Her For 5 Years   New details about Young Sheldon season 7 hint that The Big Bang Theory prequel is finally fixing Missy after wasting her for half a decade.     

Coming into Young Sheldon&#39;s final season, giving Missy an expanded role could fully redeem the character. Missy thrives when she is given responsibilities. She steps up when she is asked to do so, and on the heels of the devastation brought by the Medford tornado, it makes sense that she takes charge. Hopefully, however, everyone appreciates the extra effort she puts into rebuilding their lives.



Young Sheldon season 7 will only have 14 episodes compared to its usual 22.




Sadly, with the impending death of George, Missy&#39;s redemption arc won&#39;t be easy. The only Cooper daughter has a special bond with her dad, and losing him will impact her story moving forward. Whether Young Sheldon shows that on screen is unsure, considering everything else happening with the Coopers.
