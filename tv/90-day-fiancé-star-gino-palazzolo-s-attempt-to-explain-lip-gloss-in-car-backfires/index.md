# 90 Day Fiancé Star Gino Palazzolo s Attempt To Explain Lip Gloss In Car Backfires


## SUMMARY 



  Gino Palazzolo&#39;s explanation for the lip gloss found in his car left 90 Day Fiancé fans confused rather than satisfied, with some wondering why he hasn&#39;t cleaned his truck in over six years.   Fans speculated that Gino&#39;s lack of cleanliness in his truck could be tied to the state of his house and toilet, which Jasmine complained about.   Jasmine&#39;s first few days in the U.S. hinted at potential challenges in her relationship with Gino, including concerns about financial stability and issues with Gino&#39;s family.

## Literature Review
Gino Palazzolo opens up about the lip gloss being discovered underhis car seat, but fans suspect the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 cast member is lying.




90 Day Fiancé fans are struggling to believe Gino Palazzolo after he revealed why Jasmine Pineda found a tube of lip gloss in his car. Gino is a 53-year-old man from Canton, Michigan, who has welcomed Jasmine, 36, from Panama City, into his house. Gino is all set to get married to Jasmine in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. The couple met over three years ago when he worked as an automotive engineer and Jasmine was working as an American literature teacher in Panama. She had once caught Gino texting her private photos to an ex-girlfriend, but she forgave him for it.




However, she might not be able to accept his apology after she discovered the lip gloss. Jasmine seems certain that Gino has cheated on her with whoever it belongs to. Gino took to Instagram after the episode aired to discuss the scene with his followers.


 

&#34;Happy Monday everyone! Pretty intense scene last night!&#34; he wrote in his caption. &#34;How do you think the lip gloss got under my passenger seat and how long do you think it’s been there?&#34; Gino asked his Instagram followers. He continued, &#34;My truck is 2015 MY so I had it 6.5 years before meeting jasmine FYI,&#34; before telling his fans to have a great day ahead. However, Gino&#39;s explanation left fans feeling confused rather than satisfied.

 Gino &amp; Jasine&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

One fan asked Gino, &#34;So in 6.5 years you never cleaned your truck?&#34; Gino told them that he doesn&#39;t recall cleaning under the passenger seat of his truck. &#34;Not something I normally do,&#34; he added. Meanwhile, some fans believed Gino could have gone six years without cleaning his truck because they saw the state of his house and toilet in a recent episode. Jasmine complained that Gino&#39;s house was smelling like garbage when she entered it for the first time. She even claimed that the dust in Gino&#39;s house gave her a severe allergic reaction. He kept telling her it was due to the almonds she ate.

Jasmine&#39;s first few days in the U.S. could predict what lies ahead for her and Gino. Jasmine found out Gino quit his job so he could spend more time with her. She grew worried about whether he would be able to afford to raise her two sons when she brings them to America. Meanwhile, Jasmine told Gino she spent her wedding dress allowance on getting butt implants. The news came as a shock to Gino, but there was nothing he could have done about it as the damage was already done.




Jasmine also didn&#39;t like the way Gino&#39;s family spoke to her when she met them for the first time. Jasmine was frustrated over his family&#39;s taunts when she discovered the lip gloss. Gino kept telling Jasmine it may have belonged to one of his co-workers, but that ended up triggering Jasmine more because it meant Gino had been spending time with other women when she was still in Panama.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
