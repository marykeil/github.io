  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Karine Martins&rsquo; behavior, including her controversial social media posts and custody battle, threatens her reputation and could lead to negative consequences.
Karine&rsquo;s volatile relationship with Paul Staehle showcased deeply disturbing issues, with both parties exhibiting problematic behavior and contributing to their toxic dynamic.
Karine&rsquo;s recent actions, such as changing her story about a new partner and starting a GoFundMe campaign, have further undermined her credibility and trustworthiness among 90 Day Fiancé fans.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé star Karine Martin is a controversial reality star. She&rsquo;s known for her wild temper and erratic behavior.  Is Karine a monster now?</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins isn&rsquo;t exactly a warm and fuzzy cast member - she&rsquo;s trouble with a capital &ldquo;T.&rdquo; Karine&rsquo;s in the franchise rogue&rsquo;s gallery along with some shady people, including Geoffrey Paschel. While she definitely isn&rsquo;t as bad as Geoffrey, who&rsquo;s in the slammer after being convicted of kidnapping and other serious charges, she&rsquo;s no angel. Thanks to Karine&rsquo;s turbulent relationship with Paul Staehle, custody issues and odd social media posts, she&rsquo;s notorious.
90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Staehle always had trouble getting along with Paul. They were one of the most mismatched franchise duos. The thing is, their problems were authentically disturbing. What was shown onscreen went way beyond campy drama. At times, Paul seemed mentally ill. He had very little control over himself. While he behaved badly, it was easy to feel sorry for him - he appeared to need help. Unfortunately, Karine seemed to make his problems worse. They were always at war. Since the pair were so toxic together, they were obviously doomed. Together or apart, Paul and Karine stand out for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Adds Sexy Pics During Custody Battle
Is 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Showing Too Much Skin?</p>
<p>If Karine keeps it up, she&rsquo;s going to kill the golden goose. She&rsquo;s always on the edge of being canceled. Lately, she&rsquo;s been leaning into a sexy image on Instagram. That&rsquo;s fine, but the problem is that she&rsquo;s doing it while she&rsquo;s fighting a custody battle. It all seems so inappropriate. In the post above, Karine smoldered in a blue bra top. She turned off her comments. Karine learned the hard way that letting her sexuality show leads to negative reactions. However, that doesn&rsquo;t stop her from doing it.
The post shown above isn&rsquo;t the raciest. In some of her photos, she shows a lot more skin. She flaunts her cleavage at a time when she should probably be focusing on other things. While it&rsquo;s great that she likes her body, it&rsquo;s just not a good PR strategy right now. Karine is playing the &ldquo;monster,&rdquo; and frankly, she seems to enjoy it. Maybe she&rsquo;s a natural villain.
90 Day Fiancé monsters like Geoffrey and Karine apparently glory in their own evil. They revel in being bad. Without these villains, the franchise would lack drama, but the worst of the worst walk a fine line. Sometimes, they cross that line. When they do, they may be excommunicated.</p>
<p>7  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Just Added A Strange IG Post About A Man
90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Keeps Changing Her Story</p>
<p>Karine recently alleged that she had a man who was her new baby daddy. However, in her latest Instagram post, she told her fans that none of that was actually true. This is the type of about-face that Karine&rsquo;s known for. Ironically, she captioned the post above with, &ldquo;no drama pls.&rdquo; She also seemed to throw shade at her ex Paul by saying that fans know where the drama in her life is coming from.
There&rsquo;s a lot going on here. She&rsquo;s concocting a story to get attention. Karine&rsquo;s dragging a man into the mess. Then, she&rsquo;s saying it&rsquo;s not true and also dissing Paul. Then, she&rsquo;s telling people not to bother the man that she initially portrayed as her new partner. She wants them to leave him alone because he&rsquo;s, &ldquo;kind.&rdquo;
So, what did Karine actually say about her new man who isn&rsquo;t really her new man? Well, she said she was expecting a baby with him. Fans wondered if Paul announced that on Karine&rsquo;s social media profile without telling her first. Later on, she said that she wasn&rsquo;t pregnant, adding that the man in question wasn&rsquo;t her partner.</p>
<p>6  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Accused Paul Of Abuse &amp; Then Recanted
90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Made Some Serious Allegations</p>
<p>Karine and Paul acted more like enemies than lovers. They were always at each other&rsquo;s throats. Some of their arguments erupted into physical altercations. Karine took out a restraining order against Paul in December 2021 due to an alleged domestic dispute, and the courts agreed that it was proper to keep that restraining order in force. It was upheld by the Commonwealth of Kentucky Court of Appeals.
Initially, there seemed to be a basis for her allegations against Paul. They&rsquo;re locked into a toxic dynamic. Perhaps each one was waiting for the other to change. Sometimes, staying in these types of fraught situations can be very dangerous.
Paul and Karine have both gone too far. In this instance, Paul seemed to be the aggressor due to the restraining order issue. However, Paul says that Karine mistreated him too, and proof supports that accusation. One of their physical disputes was captured on film, and it had the most severe repercussions - as a result, they lost custody of their sons, Ethan and Pierre Staehle. In this video, Karine was violent with Paul.
Both of these people are very flawed. Things have to be very serious for a couple to lose their children. Pierre and Ethan were placed in foster care. This was the price the pair paid due to their inability to control their tempers and deal with their problems in a mature way. They must live with the outcome and their kids have to pay the price too. That&rsquo;s very sad.</p>
<p>5  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Created A GoFundMe During Custody Battle
Should She Be Asking 90 Day Fiancé Fans For Money?</p>
<p>Karine&rsquo;s conduct&rsquo;s often questionable, and more eyebrows were raised when she started a GoFundMe. She wanted cash to &ldquo;get her kids back,&rdquo; and so far, she&rsquo;s collected $3858. In light of how big the fan base is for the franchise, that isn&rsquo;t a lot of money. This actually speaks to just how bad Karine&rsquo;s reputation is. With a more popular and less controversial cast member, a lot more money would probably be raised.
Fans may not trust Karine enough to line her pockets. There&rsquo;s no way to say for sure how that money would be spent. As with sketchy, unregistered charities, there could be questions about whether the money was being spent on lawyers or something else. Since Karine isn&rsquo;t the most trustworthy member of the franchise, it&rsquo;s not surprising that her GoFundMe campaign was underwhelming. However, Paul and Karine&rsquo;s poverty was always an issue - it was something that was a facet of their 90DF storylines. So, it makes sense that Karine needs money now.
In fact, it could be argued that Paul and Karine&rsquo;s financial situation made them vulnerable people who were exploited for ratings. While there&rsquo;s no proof of that, financial dynamics often play into the OG show and spin-offs. Paul and Karine are in the unique position of being famous people who don&rsquo;t seem to have a lot of money. That&rsquo;s not such a comfortable position to be in, and it makes the GoFundMe and other shadier money-making gambits seem more understandable.</p>
<p>4  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Posted About LIfe Insurance After Paul Disappeared
Was 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Jumping The Gun?</p>
<p>Karine can be so tone-deaf in terms of what she posts. She seems impulsive and doesn&rsquo;t appear to be very self-aware. When Paul went missing in Brazil, Karine did something that was truly shocking. The word &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; is overused, but her post was really a surprise. It was the last thing that most people would add to Instagram if they were in the same circumstances. Karine&rsquo;s post, as shown above, said:
Life insurance is a final way of telling your loved ones, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This crass post might have been a sign that the whole thing was just a publicity stunt. If it was just a way to drum up interest in Paul and Karine, possibly with a mind to making money or gaining clout (or both), then at least it makes sense. In the other possible scenario, she is someone who seems to be rubbing her greedy hands together and almost welcoming the prospect of profiting off the death of the father of her children. Maybe that&rsquo;s a misinterpretation, but it doesn&rsquo;t look good.</p>
<p>3  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins (&amp; Paul Staehle) Sold Paternity Tests At OnlyFans
Should 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Have Done This?</p>
<p>Karine talked about her new OnlyFans account in the video shown above, as per Amazmde at YouTube. However, she wanted to offer more than the usual scantily clad entertainment. Generally, reality stars who post on the platform don&rsquo;t go too far, although fired 90DF cast member Larissa Lima went further there and at CamSoda. Larissa&rsquo;s CamSoda hot oil show got her canned.
Karine wanted to post her son&rsquo;s paternity test result at OnlyFans. Really, this is another situation where Karine&rsquo;s tasteless display was just so offensive. Her son doesn&rsquo;t need to grow up and then read about what his parents did. That will hurt the adult child. Of course, Karine and Paul never stop to think. They go low and then deal with the consequences afterward. Their reckless approach leaves them scrambling as things don&rsquo;t always work out as well as they planned. They are all about opening Pandora&rsquo;s Box. They cause trouble and can&rsquo;t contain it.
A caring mother shouldn&rsquo;t put her kids&rsquo; paternity test online. It&rsquo;s turning an aspect of a personal relationship into a circus sideshow. It&rsquo;s incredibly tacky. Hopefully, she&rsquo;s lived and learned.</p>
<p>2  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Has Denied Being High &amp; Drunk
Was She Telling The Truth?</p>
<p>As per EZ Buzz at YouTube, Karine&rsquo;s ex leaked a picture of her where she was drinking beer while nursing. In the past, she&rsquo;s been called out for appearing to be drunk or high on social media. Addiction isn&rsquo;t a joke - it can ruin lives. So, she has every right to defend herself if other people make her seem like an addict. However, the leaked picture was quite damning. It looked like Karine was making a mistake that could possibly hurt her baby.
Since she puts herself out there, she has to deal with haters who judge her. That&rsquo;s just the way it is. Whether she was drunk or not, or guilty of bad parenting or not, she should be more careful about who she trusts. Paul wasn&rsquo;t the best person to trust and either was the ex who leaked the photo. These men aren&rsquo;t protecting her - they&rsquo;re throwing her to the wolves. She needs to learn to protect herself.</p>
<p>1  90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Lost Custody Of Her Two Sons
What DId 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Karine Martins Do?</p>
<p>Domestic disputes can have terrible ramifications. In this case, Karine and Paul&rsquo;s fight became the catalyst for a life change that no one wanted. Both lost custody of their children. Neither wanted that outcome. They have no one to blame but themselves as the altercation was caught on videotape. Sure, both lost it - after the incident, they were probably very sorry. However, they can&rsquo;t unring the bell. Out of everything that Karine&rsquo;s done, losing custody of her child was the worst. The two boys, Ethan and Pierre, are innocent, and they lost their parents.
Now, she talks a lot about trying to get the kids back. Paul has discussed that too. However, there are no clear signs that either will get their children back. The kids are in foster care and they were removed from Paul and Karine&rsquo;s care in June of 2022. It&rsquo;s been a while and nothing has really changed.
90 Day Fiancé star Karine must have her moments, as losing her children is so serious. It&rsquo;s wrenching as little kids love their parents so much and need them. Hopefully, there are brighter days ahead for Karine. While she&rsquo;s done monstrous thing, she is taking some positive steps. She&rsquo;s working at night at UPS, perhaps to show the courts that she has a stable career. The money that she makes will help her to have more agency over her life.
