## Literature Review
Brayden Bowers reveals he had a different plan for his proposal to Christina Mandrell, but decided to do it at the Golden Bachelor wedding instead.




The Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding of Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist was a spectacular event, and one of the most exciting moments before they tied the knot was Brayden Bowers&#39; proposal to Christina Mandrell, which he now reveals was completely different from how he planned it. Brayden and Christina&#39;s relationship was revealed during the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale. Brayden had appeared on the show, but didn&#39;t find love. After chatting a bit with Christina on Instagram after filming, he met up with her at a Tenacious D concert in Nashville. They&#39;ve since fallen in love, and he also shares a sweet bond with her seven-year-old daughter, Blakely. Brayden and Christina got engaged at the Golden Wedding.




In an interview with People, Brayden revealed that he was planning to ask Christina to marry him later this year. His first plan was to put the ring on a slice of pineapple pizza because they’d talked about wanting to make pineapple pizza in Italy. However, after he spoke to the Golden Bachelor producers, they all came up with the idea for him to propose with a Neil Lane ring during the live event. Brayden added, &#34;From the experiences we both had like we both came into this show just wanting love. We both had hard, challenging roads in different ways, and we were both, I feel like, misunderstood. And it&#39;s like two misunderstood people that understand each other.&#34;

 Brayden Bowers Wants To Set Good Example For Christina’s Daughter 
          




Brayden shared that he and Christina are moving in together in Nashville this week, and he had her daughter in mind when he proposed. He said, &#34;The thing is with her and her daughter, I wouldn&#39;t make a move out there if I wasn&#39;t sure that she&#39;s the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.&#34; Brayden added, &#34;I figured that we should make this proper and set the example too for Blakely and to show her the kind of love that she deserves as well. And so, it&#39;s the kind of love I want to give to her mom every single day.&#34;


 

Brayden and Christina were both polarizing contestants when they appeared in Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season and Zach Shallcross&#39; Bachelor season. They were each painted as villains at different points in the seasons because of their strong personalities and their feelings that their connections with the leads were stronger than anyone else&#39;s. However, Christina redeemed herself during &#34;The Women Tell All&#34; special when she promised to try to do better in the future rather than get defensive. Brayden also had a redemption story on Bachelor in Paradise season 9 when his repeated heartbreaks led to him being eliminated from the show. However, he proved that he was more than a loud contestant with dangling earrings.




Brayden&#39;s dedication to Christina&#39;s daughter is also very admirable. Their social media posts show that they have a fun, romantic, and supportive relationship. Their romance was a shocker at first, but it really does make sense. Brayden is right that they were two misunderstood people who came together and now feel seen and heard. Brayden did a wonderful job with the proposal at The Golden Bachelor wedding. Brayden and Christina are wished all the best as they move forward with this chapter of their lives together.
