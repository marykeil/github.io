## Literature Review
Despite widespread complaints and fan dissatisfaction, Boruto has become an essential piece of the saga that can make Naruto canon better.




It&#39;s hard to argue that Naruto isn&#39;t a ground-breaking, epic saga that stands out as one of the world&#39;s most iconic manga and anime franchises. Nevertheless, in a complicated story that ran as long as it did, there were more than a few creative choices that could have been done better. Fortunately, the creators have Boruto to fix its errors.




As stated in its title, Boruto details the journey of the next generation of shinobi, carrying on the legacy of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and their cohort of ninjas. As such, it&#39;s certainly developed its own rich lore and exceptional characters. Boruto stands on its own as vital content for anyone interested in understanding the Naruto universe.

          

However, the way that the story has developed – with more than a few characters from Naruto playing major roles and with ample links back to the original story, Boruto also provides its creators with the opportunity to add context to the original story, flesh out characters that were not properly showcased, and to correct mistakes that cropped up in hindsight. In other words, Boruto provides the perfect opportunity to retcon the original series for the better and improve the Naruto canon.





 Boruto Has Already Enriched The Naruto Story

The most obvious way Boruto improves Naruto is through all the new and interesting elements it brings into the canon. That is, Boruto makes Naruto better just by existing. For instance, Naruto&#39;s focus on training, practice, and water-fighting showcased Naruto and his friends&#39; growth as ninja warriors. Boruto, on the other hand, pulled back the curtain on their personal side, such as their family life or what it&#39;s like being ninja parents to ninja kids during a time of peace. This showcased their growth and development as people. In Boruto, they come away as more complete and multidimensional. They are more real and therefore more relatable.

In Boruto, fans also get to experience fuller interrelations between characters, such as a deepened relationship between Naruto and Sasuke. With both being parents and senior leaders in the village, their relationship has entered uncharted territories. Boruto also provides a plethora of valuable context for Naruto. For instance, there&#39;s all the information it introduces about the Otsutsuki clan. Despite the existential threat they posed in the original story, their depiction, through Kaguya&#39;s story, was underwhelming. Boruto resolves this by filling out the Otsutsuki backstory and unearthing why Earth and humanity are so important to them.






 Boruto Should Be Used To Fix Naruto&#39;s Errors 
Despite its controversial reception among fans, the series has its positives
          

Boruto&#39;s contribution to Naruto, however, goes beyond simply expanding and broadening the series&#39; lore. A more important function is how it can strengthen the story by enhancing and updating it for contemporary fans. This can be done is a number of ways, but perhaps the best way is simply as commentary from an elder character reflecting on their time in Naruto. The best example of this is Sasuke&#39;s comments to Boruto, in Two Blue Vortex Chaper #5, about how he remembers Naruto. The comment provides interesting and useful information about Naruto without upsetting the flow of the Boruto story.

As for areas for improvement – a few stand out as worthy of the effort. One of the biggest issues fans continuously cite as problematic with Naruto is its treatment of female characters. Naruto had a number of strong female characters, but their stories were consistently downplayed and sidelined to make room for Naruto, Sasuke, and other male characters. Boruto can correct this issue by providing &#34;after the fact&#34; tales of female characters such as Sakura and Hinata, performing important acts or assuming meaningful roles in situations that were not depicted in the manga or anime. Most creators don&#39;t have the opportunity that Boruto gives Naruto creator Kishimoto to make his story better. Hopefully, he&#39;ll use the remaining time of Boruto&#39;s publication to do all he can to make Naruto and Boruto even better than they already are.
