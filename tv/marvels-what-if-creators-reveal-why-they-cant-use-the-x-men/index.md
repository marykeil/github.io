## Literature Review
What If...? season 2 used many exciting Marvel characters; however, the X-Men were not present, and it turns out there is a key reason why.




Marvel&#39;s What If...? creators reveal why the Marvel Cinematic Universe animated series was not allowed to use the X-Men. With Marvel&#39;s What If...? season 3 on the horizon, new characters will be able to get an animated treatment. However, judging by the timeline of when the new season of the MCU TV series should be released, it will also be missing the X-Men due to a key reason.




Speaking to Comicbook.com, What If...? creators Bryan Andrews and A.C. Bradley explained why the animated series is missing the X-Men. According to Andrews, the X-Men &#34;were pretty much off the table.&#34; The reason for that is Marvel wants to first introduce live-action versions of the X-Men to the MCU before What If...? can get to play with the characters. Bradley added that the MCU&#39;s timeline, which affected the X-Men&#39;s possible role in What If...?, was also responsible for Sam Wilson&#39;s Captain America being absent. Check out the full X-Men quote below:


&#34;They were pretty much off the table. They&#39;re like, &#39;We got to do it first in live action, and then you get to do it.&#39; And we&#39;re like, &#39;Ah, man!&#39; We would&#39;ve loved to have played with all kinds of toys. But there&#39;s limitations.&#34;


                  What If...? Season 2 Cast &amp; Marvel Character Guide   What If...? season 2 premieres on December 22, 2023, on Disney&#43;, bringing new and returning voice actors to the animated worlds of the MCU&#39;s Phase 5.    





 When The MCU’s X-Men Could Debut 
The Multiverse&#39;s X-Men Are Already In The MCU
          

The X-Men are already in the MCU, sort of. Kelsey Grammar appeared as Beast in The Marvels after Teyonah Parris&#39; Monica Rambeau got trapped in another universe. Before that, Patrick Stewart played a variant of Charles Xavier in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. This year, Deadpool 3 will be the first MCU film in the mutant&#39;s franchise, bringing Deadpool, Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine, Colossus, and possibly several rumored X-Men characters to the MCU.

                  Predicting The Box Office Performance Of Every 2024 Marvel &amp; DC Movie   With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.    

Based on Marvel&#39;s plans for the multiverse X-Men from Fox&#39;s universe, it seems like the MCU&#39;s version of the mutants will take a little longer to arrive. The MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga is set to end with 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars. The movie could serve as the perfect send-off to Fox&#39;s X-Men, allowing fans to finally see requested team-ups, such as Jackman&#39;s Wolverine meeting Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man or the MCU&#39;s original Avengers.




After that, the road would be clear for the MCU&#39;s X-Men to come through. Marvel Studios would then be looking at a 2028 debut for the X-Men at the earliest — unless a few characters make a cameo at the end of Avengers: Secret Wars. That could happen as a way to tease the future of the MCU and the possible theme of Marvel&#39;s next saga, which is rumored to be all about the mutants. If Marvel&#39;s What If...? manages to continue releasing new seasons until then, the X-Men will be able to have fun multiverse scenarios in the series.
