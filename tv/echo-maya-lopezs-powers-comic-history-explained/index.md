## Literature Review
Maya Lopez a.k.a. Echo is a key street-level MCU character with a tragic past and several connections to major Marvel heroes and villains.




Alaqua Cox stars in Marvel&#39;s Echo as the titular character, Maya Lopez a.k.a. Echo, who&#39;s an anti-hero with a short but hectic story and an already developed MCU journey. Maya Lopez makes her MCU debut in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye as a secondary antagonist with a vendetta against the titular Avenger. After realizing that her real enemy was her childhood guardian all along, Maya Lopez redeems herself for her misplaced anger, and Hawkeye&#39;s season finale ending sets up Maya&#39;s own show, which delves into her new goals, her new abilities, and her indigenous heritage.




Marvel&#39;s Echo is a key release for the MCU due to its connections to Netflix&#39;s Marvel shows, which are integrated into MCU canon through characters like Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin and Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil, two important characters in Echo&#39;s story. It also paves the way for Disney&#43; shows like the MCU&#39;s upcoming Daredevil: Born Again and links the franchise&#39;s street-level stories to the wider universe through Echo&#39;s connections to characters like Clint Barton and Kate Bishop. And of course, the 5-episode-long Echo provides Maya Lopez with the chance to become an A-list Marvel character in the future by delving into her backstory and her present conflicts.


 Echo&#39;s Marvel Comics History Explained 
          

In Marvel Comics, Maya Lopez begins her journey as a vigilante years after witnessing her father&#39;s death at a young age. Wilson Fisk a.k.a. Kingpin takes care of Maya and blames Daredevil for her father&#39;s murder in order to hide the fact that he was the culprit. Maya grows up to be a talented artist and fighter, as her deafness allows her to develop a near-superhuman ability to replicate other people&#39;s skills by just looking at them play music, dance, or fight. Taking up the &#34;Echo&#34; moniker, Maya Lopez confronts Daredevil, but Matt Murdock reveals the truth to her, which motivates Maya to shoot Kingpin, temporarily blinding him.




                  Wait, How Is Kingpin Alive In Marvel&#39;s Echo Show?   After Hawkeye, where he&#39;s shot at point-blank range, Kingpin was assumed dead, so how can he come back for the upcoming Disney&#43; Marvel show Echo?    

Echo takes some time to process the events. In the meantime, she befriends Daredevil and joins the New Avengers as &#34;Ronin&#34;, a masked sword-wielding vigilante. After making a name for herself and helping the Avengers fight the Hand, a Skrull posing as Elektra kills Maya. However, the real Elektra resurrects Maya using the same magic the Hand once used on her, and Maya is able to continue her heroic journey as Echo, this time without her Ronin identity. Clint Barton then adopts the Ronin persona, and Echo goes on to become a full-fledged superhero, fighting villains like the Skrulls and wielding the Phoenix power by herself for a while.

Unlike many other Marvel characters, Maya Lopez&#39;s abilities are fully innate. Even before adopting the Echo moniker, Maya can understand spoken language by reading lips, and she&#39;s able to replicate other people&#39;s skills effortlessly. Her speed, agility, combat technique, and weapon-wielding skills are at their peak by the time she&#39;s old enough to fight, which allows her to go toe-to-toe with an experienced Daredevil. Echo is also in tune with nature and can occasionally communicate with spirits. However, Echo is an otherwise regular human being with no super strength or any other superhuman ability, and she&#39;s vulnerable to the kind of attacks that would kill any other person.

                  Marvel&#39;s Bloodiest Show Is Exactly What Daredevil&#39;s MCU Return Deserves To Be   Daredevil will appear in the upcoming Marvel streaming series Echo, and the show&#39;s trailer demonstrates that its perfect for Matt Murdock&#39;s return.

The MCU&#39;s Echo differs from her comic book counterpart in various aspects, including her powers. The extent of Echo&#39;s abilities in the MCU isn&#39;t limited to the skill-copying abilities Maya Lopez shares with Taskmaster in the source material, as Alaqua Cox&#39;s character also develops a stronger connection with her ancestors&#39; spirits, who grant her access to supernatural skills. While not as extravagant as Captain America&#39;s abilities, Echo&#39;s speed, strength, endurance, aim, and durability are enhanced, and she&#39;s also able to harness and weaponize vibrations. However, as evidenced by Hawkeye, Echo&#39;s mimicry abilities are barely developed in the MCU, given how she doesn&#39;t copy Clint Barton or Kate Bishop&#39;s sharpshooting abilities.



Taskmaster, Marvel&#39;s other skill-copying character, also went through drastic changes in the MCU with Black Widow&#39;s Antonia Dreykov replacing Tony Masters.









 Echo Comics Changes Explained 
          

Besides Echo&#39;s powers, the MCU also changes some details about Maya Lopez&#39;s backstory. Instead of blaming the murder of Maya&#39;s father on Daredevil, Kingpin blames Ronin in the MCU. At the time of William Lopez&#39;s death, Clint Barton had created the Ronin persona to blow off steam by killing criminals following Thanos&#39; Snap, and Wilson Fisk took advantage of Ronin&#39;s rampage to get rid of William Lopez by placing him on Ronin&#39;s crosshairs. A grown-up Maya Lopez then follows in her father&#39;s footsteps and becomes the MCU Tracksuit Mafia&#39;s commander under Kingpin&#39;s orders, whereas her comic book counterpart takes a long while to start fighting after witnessing her father&#39;s death as a child.

Marvel Studios changes Maya Lopez&#39;s roots, from her comic book counterpart&#39;s Blackfeet tribe background to Echo&#39;s MCU Choctaw heritage, which is better explored throughout each Echo episode. Alaqua Cox&#39;s Echo also meets and fights Daredevil only after finding out the truth about Kingpin and her father&#39;s death, and she doesn&#39;t create the Ronin suit or wear it at any point before Clint Barton burns it. Instead of jumping straight ahead into Avengers missions after rediscovering her purpose in life, the MCU&#39;s Echo remains a street-level fighter after the events of Hawkeye and Marvel&#39;s Echo.






 Echo&#39;s Role In The MCU Explained 
         

Marvel&#39;s Echo is the MCU&#39;s second grounded, street-level Disney&#43; show, released after Hawkeye introduced Maya Lopez and integrated Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin from Netflix&#39;s Marvel shows. With Hawkeye coming from saving the world alongside the Avengers and Daredevil coming from fighting alongside She-Hulk, Maya Lopez becomes the bridge between the MCU&#39;s larger-than-life stories and the MCU&#39;s street-level corner. Therefore, after the events of her own show, it&#39;s possible that heroes like Moon Knight, the Punisher, and Jessica Jones will cross paths with Alaqua Cox&#39;s Echo in more grounded stories than the MCU is accustomed to.



 Echo Is The MCU&#39;s First Deaf &amp; Indigenous Hero 
          




The MCU&#39;s Echo makes history not only as the first leading indigenous protagonist in a superhero series, but also as the second major deaf superhero after Eternals&#39; Makkari. Marvel&#39;s Echo is a big step forward in representation for deaf and indigenous people, and both Echo&#39;s skills and backstory provide a rich variety of possibilities for her character arc, her fight scenes, and her interactions with other Marvel characters. The MCU has the chance to dive deeper into these aspects of the character than the source material, as Echo&#39;s focus on Maya Lopez allows her indigenous roots to be developed to the fullest and the show&#39;s audiovisual medium provides new ways to depict her abilities.
