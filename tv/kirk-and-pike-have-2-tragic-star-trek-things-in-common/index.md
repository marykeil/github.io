## Literature Review
Star Trek legends Captain Pike and Captain Kirk had tough lives following their departure from the USS Enterprise. Is the beloved starship cursed?




Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) and Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) have two Star Trek tragedies in common. Kirk succeeded Pike as captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 in 2265 and became one of the most legendary Starfleet officers of all time. Both Kirk and Pike had differing styles of command, but they were both Starfleet legends who commanded the respect and loyalty of their respective Enterprise crews. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&#39; crossover episode revealed that Pike&#39;s birthday was a national holiday, while Starfleet officers still talk about Kirk&#39;s exploits long into the 25th century.




While Enterprise captains Kirk and Pike leave an extensive Starfleet legacy, they also have some tragedies in common. From what&#39;s known about Pike so far in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, he hasn&#39;t settled down or had a family. This appears to be backed up by the Star Trek: The Original Series episode &#34;The Menagerie&#34;. The same is true for both Captain Kirk and Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Further to that, both Pike and Kirk&#39;s fortunes drastically changed after handing over to their successors. Kirk&#39;s successor, Captain John Harriman (Alan Ruck) even played an unwitting role in the Starfleet legend&#39;s tragic fate.

                  Star Trek: How The Enterprise Got Its Worst Captain (Backstory Explained)   The USS Enterprise-B&#39;s Captain John Harriman debuted in Star Trek Generations but it was his only appearance and his backstory was never explained.    


 Star Trek&#39;s Kirk And Pike Suffered Tragedy After Leaving The USS Enterprise 
         




Tragically, Kirk&#39;s death in Star Trek Generations took place in the same year that the USS Enterprise-A was decommissioned. Although Kirk technically died on Veridian III in the 24th century, he was officially believed to have been killed while saving the USS Enterprise-B in 2293. There&#39;s something poetic, if brutal and tragic, about Kirk&#39;s life ending after he gave up the Enterprise. Although Kirk had tried living the quiet life between Star Trek: The Motion Picture and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, it didn&#39;t last long, and he was back in Enterprise&#39;s center seat. Sadly, the accident aboard the Enterprise-B meant that Kirk never got his second chance to pursue a life beyond Starfleet.

Similarly, Fleet Captain Pike suffered a tragic accident not long after he handed over the Enterprise to Kirk. In the year 2266, Pike sacrificed his life to save a group of Starfleet cadets from exposure to delta radiation. The delta radiation left Pike scarred and paralyzed, and the Fleet Captain remained a serving Starfleet officer in name only. Given Pike&#39;s tragic accident, and Kirk&#39;s &#34;death&#34; on the USS Enterprise-B, it&#39;s hard not to feel that the role of Enterprise captain is somewhat cursed.






 Kirk And Pike&#39;s Post-Enterprise Tragedies Had Similar Endings 
         

Kirk lived inside Star Trek Generations&#39; Nexus while he was presumed dead after the Enterprise-B incident. Inside the Nexus, Kirk could live out the retirement that he had previously denied himself. Kirk was reunited with both his beloved dog and his lost love, Antonia, on an idyllic ranch in Idaho. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) told Kirk that it was all an illusion, which ultimately convinced the Starfleet legend to return through the Nexus to help him defeat Dr. Tolian Soran (Malcolm McDowell). It was in defeating Soran that Kirk finally lost his life.

Interestingly, the way that Kirk lived out his final days was eerily similar to the experiences of Captain Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney/Jeffrey Hunter) in Star Trek: The Original Series&#39; &#34;The Menagerie.&#34; After disobeying Starfleet&#39;s orders, Lt. Commander Spock (Leonard Nimoy) hijacked the USS Enterprise to transport Fleet Captain Pike to Talos IV. Once relocated there, Pike would be able to live an illusory life free from his career-ending injuries. Like Star Trek&#39;s Nexus, Talos IV was a paradise where all Pike&#39;s fantasies were allowed to come true. It was in that paradise that Fleet Captain Pike would finally end his days, drawing tragic comparisons with the death of his Enterprise successor, Captain Kirk.




             Star Trek: The Original Series Star Trek: The Original Series follows the exploits of the crew of the USS Enterprise. On a five-year mission to explore uncharted space, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) must trust his crew - Spock (Leonard Nimoy), Dr. Leonard &#34;Bones&#34; McCoy (Forest DeKelley), Montgomery &#34;Scotty&#34; Scott (James Doohan), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Sulu (George Takei) - with his life. Facing previously undiscovered life forms and civilizations and representing humanity among the stars on behalf of Starfleet and the United Federation of Planets, the Enterprise regularly comes up against impossible odds and diplomatic dilemmas.  

              Star Trek: Strange New Worlds A spin-off of Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is a television series that takes place before the events of the original series and follows Captain Christopher Pike as he mans the helm of the U.S.S. Enterprise. The show focuses on this previous crew of the Enterprise as they explore the galaxy with returning characters from Discovery.
