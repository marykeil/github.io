## Literature Review
There is controversy around Ebraheem Al Samadi from Dubai Bling, with bad rumors, various feuds, and people disrespecting his wife at the center.  




Dubai Bling’s Ebraheem Al Samadi has been part of some huge scandals that prove he’s the king of controversies. The 36-year-old UAE resident made a name for himself when he was barely 14. He started his first business and explored his passion for sales, which helped him achieve his master’s degree in business administration. Ebraheem already had thousands of followers before he debuted on the reality TV series. However, featuring in Dubai Bling did help him become even more famous and showcase his unique personality to the world.




Ebraheem debuted on Dubai Bling in season 1 and instantly became the show’s villain. He stirred the pot between his co-stars, caused fights, and tried to create drama. The new reality TV star also didn’t hesitate before flaunting his wealth. He sent a helicopter to pick up his date and creatively promoted his flower business. His habit of gossiping and being hypocritical also became quite evident in later episodes. Ebraheem was also fairly controversial in Dubai Bling season 2. He was part of wild on-camera feuds and more drama with Zeina Khoury and Danya Mohammed.

Ebraheem has been part of many rumors since his debut on the Netflix show. One such rumor has been about his sexuality, as many people think he’s a closeted homosexual man. In December 2023, Ebraheem took to TikTok and clarified his position. He said he respected everyone for who they are but isn’t part of the gay community. The Dubai Bling star also shared his anger with people who’ve started the rumor. He said, “the moment that they are going to be pushing their agenda on me, that’s the time, they’ve crossed the line.”



 Dubai Bling’s Ebraheem Al Samadi’s Still Feuding With Zeina Khoury 
          

Ebraheem has fought with many people in the past. However, this rivalry with Zeina is one of his most notable. Ebraheem and Zeina started on a good note, sharing the same social circles. However, things changed when Ebraheem learned that Zeina disliked his friend Farhana Bodi and couldn’t keep his mouth shut. In the following episodes, Ebraheem and Zeina feuded because they no longer liked each other. Ebraheem despised that Zeina came to his workplace to confront him, and Zeina disliked that he tried to purchase her company. The two are likely still feuding, as they don’t appear on each other’s social media posts.






 Dubai Bling’s Ebraheem Al Samadi Thinks People Disrespect His Wife 

 

Ebraheem has been married three times in the past. While his earlier marriages didn’t work out, his latest one with a woman named Hamdah is going pretty well. Unlike women on Dubai Bling, Ebraheem’s wife isn’t into social media. Instead, she’s a very private person who only shares her time with her family and husband. In April 2023, Ebraheem posted a photo with his wife, who had covered her face with one of his iconic flowers. He shared that many people have been pushing him to show his wife’s face, which was “very disrespectful.” The Dubai Bling cast member added that his wife wishes to remain private.



Dubai Bling season 2 is available for streaming on Netflix.
