## Literature Review
Severance season 2 gets a direct update from director and producer Ben Stiller after Apple TV&#43; cryptically posted about the show on social media.




Severance director and executive producer Ben Stiller has offered a direct update on season 2 following teases made on social media by Apple TV&#43;. Since Monday, the streaming service has posted a video and an image from the sci-fi workplace drama, leading to speculation that season 2 is coming soon. Production on the next season began in October 2022, but was interrupted by the dual strikes days before filming was set to finish.




Now, Stiller has taken to Twitter himself to reveal that Severance season 2 is being worked on.


 

The comedian offered no other comments about the show, such as how far into production it is or when new episodes may come out. However, his update seems like a positive sign coupled with Apple TV&#43;&#39;s teasers.


 Will Severance Season 2 Come Out In 2024? 
          

Given the cryptic teases from Apple TV&#43; and Stiller confirming ongoing production, it&#39;s likely season 2 will arrive later this year. The cast of Severance will be returning to their roles as workers at Lumon Industries, dealing with the consequences of the outies escape in the season 1 finale. In addition, the building mystery surrounding the company will also continue to be developed, including what happened to Mark&#39;s wife.




The show has experienced some setbacks in production, however, dealing with both the writers and actors strikes that occurred throughout 2023. There were also reports in April that production delays were happening due to ballooning budget costs and fallout between its showrunners. However, it&#39;s unclear how much these alleged conflicts impacted production, and how they will be reflected in season 2.

Since Severance season 1 ended with the group&#39;s innies waking up following their outies taking over, there will now be many consequences outside of work driving the narrative forward. This could range from Mark investigating the whereabouts of his wife in the company to other members of the group trying to understand what happened. Stiller&#39;s update is a positive sign that season 2 will be coming soon, likely maintaining the same compelling nature as season 1.



Severance season 1 is currently streaming on Apple TV&#43;.
