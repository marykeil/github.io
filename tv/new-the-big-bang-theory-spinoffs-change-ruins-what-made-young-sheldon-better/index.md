# New The Big Bang Theory Spinoffs Change Ruins What Made Young Sheldon Better


## SUMMARY 



  CBS&#39; new spinoff of Young Sheldon, centered on Georgie and Mandy, will deviate from the original show&#39;s format by using a multi-cam set-up and bringing back the laugh track.   The absence of a laugh track in Young Sheldon allowed for more nuanced storytelling and the exploration of serious arcs, which may be lost in the spinoff.   The spinoff&#39;s shift to a multi-cam set-up with a laugh track may hinder its ability to effectively address serious topics, such as the aftermath of George&#39;s death and the eventual split of Georgie and Mandy.

## Literature Review

The Big Bang Theory&#39;s next spinoff starring Georgie and Mandy takes away one of the great things that makes Young Sheldon a better show. 




CBS&#39; next The Big Bang Theory spinoff removes one of the things that make Young Sheldon a much better show. After Sheldon ends his arc in Texas and moves to California for the rest of his adult life, the Coopers&#39; story will continue via a new show that centers on Georgie and Mandy. The new parents will navigate their role as mom and dad to Baby Cece, all while figuring out their own romance, which has been full of challenges, to say the least. Technically a Young Sheldon spinoff, but Georgie and Mandy&#39;s project will be vastly different.




For context, the new Georgie and Mandy show is different from the earlier announced The Big Bang Theory offshoot from Chuck Lorre that may or may not be on CBS. Nonetheless, considering that it already has an established premise that can be properly set up in Young Sheldon season 7, it&#39;s much easier to launch it in time for the 2024-2025 TV season. There are several plot lines that Georgie and Mandy&#39;s spinoff need to tackle based on the known canon. There&#39;s no guarantee it will get around them, but if it does, it will be in an altered environment.

                  Young Sheldonâ€™s New Spinoff Makes A 16-Year The Big Bang Theory Trend Worse   George and Mandy&#39;s in-development Young Sheldon spinoff will worsen a disappointing trend that The Big Bang Theory started 16 years ago.    


 Young Sheldon Doesn&#39;t Use A Laugh Track 
Unlike The Big Bang Theory, which was filmed in front of a live audience.
          




Young Sheldon started as an origins story for Sheldon. It has outgrown its premise since then, but that&#39;s primarily because its format allowed it to diversify its storytelling. Instead of being in a multi-cam setting, which means that a show is filmed inside a set, in front of a live audience, and with a laugh track, like The Big Bang Theory, it shifted to a single-camera set-up. The overall look and feel of Young Sheldon makes it easier to tackle quieter and even more serious arcs compared to its parent series, which was more of a traditional sitcom.

The Big Bang Theory was great for what it was. It did have emotional moments and tackled some serious issues, but it leaned more towards silly comedy. Young Sheldon, on the other hand, is more nuanced in its storytelling, and not having a laugh track is a huge component of that. Including canned laughter makes it tricky to fully delve into more serious moments, which the prequel has a lot of, especially after it started transforming more into a family show rather than just tackling Sheldon&#39;s day-to-day adventures as a boy genius in Texas.






 Georgie and Mandy&#39;s Spinoff Will Bring Back The Laugh Track 
Young Sheldon&#39;s new spinoff will revert to a multi-cam set-up.
          

Specific plot details are still uncertain about the upcoming CBS series. Aside from Montana Jordan and Emily Osment, no one else is confirmed to round up the Young Sheldon spinoff cast, although there are hopes that the remaining Cooper family will be part of the recurring cast, like Missy, Mary, and even Meemaw. Depending on Young Sheldon season 7&#39;s storytelling pace, it&#39;s possible that George is already dead by the time Georgie and Mandy&#39;s show starts.

Despite essentially being a continuation of Young Sheldon, Georgie and Mandy&#39;s new series will deviate from its format, and will follow The Big Bang Theory&#39;s multi-cam set-up instead. This means that it will film primarily inside a set, with a live audience, and interestingly, with a laugh track. According to reports, the new Young Sheldon spin-off&#39;s change is due to CBS&#39; cost-cutting efforts, since it will be cheaper to produce the series if it has an established set and does not have a lot of on-location scenes. The idea in itself, however, is quite odd.




                  Young Sheldon Season 7 Hints It&#39;s Fixing A Controversial The Big Bang Theory Crime   Young Sheldon season 7&#39;s trailer strongly suggests that it will fix a controversial crime against The Big Bang Theory&#39;s version of Sheldon Cooper.    



 Why Having A Laugh Track Doesn&#39;t Make Sense For Georgie and Mandy&#39;s Spinoff 
Georgie and Mandy&#39;s new show being a multi-cam series will be difficult to pull off.
          

Georgie and Mandy&#39;s story in Young Sheldon is not only the best original arc in the prequel, but it also deals with a lot more serious topics than Sheldon&#39;s weekly adventures. It puts unexpected pregnancy at the center of its storytelling, which creates so many poignant moments in The Big Bang Theory prequel. Continuing this tone in their show would be difficult, however, given the change in its storytelling format.

Potentially dealing with the aftermath of George&#39;s death will be tricky for the Mandy and Georgie-fronted series on CBS, considering the subject. It&#39;s safe to say that it will be a major factor in how the couple&#39;s lives will move forward, primarily because of Georgie&#39;s known sacrifices for his family on the heels of the Cooper patriarch&#39;s demise. It also hinders the series from properly tackling the couple&#39;s inevitable split, possibly towards the end of its run, as established in both Young Sheldon and The Big Bang Theory.
