# The Conners Cast Exit Means Season 6 Can No Longer Fix The Show s Biggest Roseanne Crime


## SUMMARY 



  The Conners&#39; latest character exit negatively impacts its connection to the original Roseanne series and its core message about family.   DJ&#39;s departure from The Conners means there is no compelling reason for him to return to the show&#39;s small town setting.   The exclusion of DJ betrays the central theme of the Roseanne franchise and wastes the potential for interesting storytelling with his character and family.

## Literature Review
The latest original cast departure ahead of The Conners season 6 means that it won&#39;t be able to fix its biggest crime against Roseanne. 




The Conners season 6&#39;s latest original character exit hints that it will never be able to fix its biggest crime against the original Roseanne series. Getting the sequel spin-off series was no easy task as it was born on the heels of Roseanne Barr&#39;s firing from the original revival. Despite that, The Conners thrived, especially in ratings, becoming ABC&#39;s premier comedy. Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t mean that it has been devoid of any issues. It has been particularly plagued with character departures — some had a greater impact than others, but this latest one has big implications for its legacy.




When Roseanne was revived in 2018, the idea was simply to bring her family back to the small screen to continue their story. By then, it had been 21 years since the sitcom&#39;s original run wrapped up, which meant that a lot had already happened to the clan, effectively becoming a point of intrigue for the new series. The revived Roseanne had all the hallmarks of its predecessors; it even retained the Conners&#39; home in Lanford. Most importantly, it brought back Dan and Roseanne&#39;s whole family, as well as Jackie. It made sense, knowing full well that Roseanne resonated because of its grounded storytelling about a relatable clan.

                  The Conners Season 6’s Most Important Plot Proves Why It Needs To End Already   The Conners only has one compelling arc left to tackle in season 6, which is further proof that it&#39;s time that the Roseanne spin-off finally ends.     


 Mary’s The Conners Exit Kills Any Chance Of DJ Coming Back 
          




Even after Barr&#39;s firing, The Conners maintained the show&#39;s main focus — the importance of family. Unfortunately, it has become progressively selective over which member to devote time to. By The Conners season 5, Michael Fishman was unexpectedly written out of the show as DJ — Dan and Roseanne&#39;s youngest, even though he had played the role since the original show. There hasn&#39;t been any clear reason for his exit. Still, despite his absence, there have been hopes that he will eventually return, especially since his daughter, Mary, supposedly lives part-time with her paternal grandfather. Moving forward in The Conners season 6, that will no longer be the case.

Jayden Rey has officially exited The Conners ahead of season 6. This effectively kills the chances of DJ returning to Lanford. While it remains his hometown, not having her daughter or any member of his own family in the small municipality doesn&#39;t give him any reason to come back any time soon. It doesn&#39;t seem like he has strong ties with his sisters or father to make an effort to go back home regularly. Sadly, without a proper appearance from DJ, it&#39;s difficult to re-establish his place in the Conner family.






 The Conners’ Treatment Of DJ Betrays The Core Message Of The Roseanne Franchise 
          

Given the predicament, the spin-off sequel can no longer make amends for sidelining and eventually discarding the youngest Conner kid, which contradicts the very core of the Roseanne franchise that family is everything. The original series highlighted Dan and Roseanne&#39;s dedication to their kids despite the difficulties brought on by their socioeconomic status. Excluding DJ from The Conners when he is one cheapens that core message. What makes this more frustrating is that DJ and his own family&#39;s dynamic had so much narrative potential that was just wasted.

             The Conners The Conners is a spinoff of Roseanne, a popular sitcom beginning in 1988 that starred John Goodman as Dan Conner and Roseanne Barr as Roseanne Conner. After the Roseanne revival was canceled in 2018, The Conners continued the storyline of the lovable middle-class family and their lives in the fictional town of Lanford, Illinois. The Emmy award-winning series brings back Dan’s children, Darlene, Becky, and DJ, played by Sara Gilbert, Alicia Goranson, and Michael Fishman, respectively.
