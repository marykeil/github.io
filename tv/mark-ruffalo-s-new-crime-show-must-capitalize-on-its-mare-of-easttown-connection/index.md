# Mark Ruffalo s New Crime Show Must Capitalize On Its Mare Of Easttown Connection


## SUMMARY 



  Mark Ruffalo&#39;s upcoming show, Task, will be set in the same universe as Mare of Easttown.   Task will feature Ruffalo as a complex FBI agent leading a kidnapping and murder investigation, similar to Kate Winslet&#39;s role in Mare of Easttown.   The connection between Task and Mare of Easttown should be emphasized and capitalized on, potentially through character crossovers or references to the original show.

## Literature Review

Mark Ruffalo is set to star in a new crime television show on HBO, and the upcoming miniseries has ties to Kate Winslet&#39;s Mare of Easttown.




Mare of Easttown ended in May 2021, but its legacy will reportedly live on in Mark Ruffalo&#39;s upcoming television series, Task, which must take advantage of its connection to the critically acclaimed show starring Kate Winslet. The 2021 crime drama limited series was created and written by Brad Ingelsby for HBO, and Ingelsby is also the mind behind Ruffalo&#39;s new show alongside Jeremiah Zagar. Following the success of Mare of Easttown, Ingelsby secured a three-year deal with HBO to create new projects for the premium cable network, leading to the development of Task, which doesn&#39;t have a premiere date yet.




Mare of Easttown consisted of seven episodes and chronicled Winslet&#39;s Detective Marianne &#34;Mare&#34; Sheehan&#39;s investigation into the murder of Erin McMenamin, a teenage single mother with an abusive father and horrible ex-boyfriend. Aside from trying to solve the troubling case, Mare dealt with another unsolved murder that had plagued her for over a year and many other problems in her personal life. The limited series took many twists and turns, and following its finale, the show received widespread acclaim and won multiple prestigious awards. Although the story seemed over, Ruffalo&#39;s Task could keep Mare of Easttown alive.


 Mark Ruffalo&#39;s Task Is In The &#34;Same Universe&#34; As Mare Of Easttown 
         

Not much is known about Mark Ruffalo&#39;s upcoming HBO television series other than sparse details about the actor&#39;s character and that it will be set in the same world as Mare of Easttown. During an interview with Deadline, Ruffalo explained that he will play an FBI agent who is &#34;complicated&#34; and &#34;badly damaged but fighting for good&#34; in Task. His character sounds as if he will be the counterpart of Kate Winslet&#39;s role in Mare of Easttown, as his FBI agent will be the head of a kidnapping and murder investigation. Perhaps Ruffalo&#39;s character will call Mare for help in solving the case.




The actor revealed that Task is in the &#34;same universe [as Mare of Easttown]. It&#39;s in Philly. At some point, those two might run into each other in the future â€” that&#39;s what they&#39;re saying. It&#39;s not set. Nothing&#39;s set.&#34; Ruffalo is notorious for accidentally spoiling aspects of his projects, so his tease that his character and Winslet&#39;s Mare will meet in Task could realistically come to fruition. However, only time will tell how Brad Ingelsby connects his two projects.



 Mark Ruffalo&#39;s New Show Shouldn&#39;t Gloss Over Its Connection To The HBO Hit 
          

Since Task&#39;s connection to Mare of Easttown is among the first news surrounding Mark Ruffalo&#39;s upcoming miniseries, it has to make the most out of that significant detail. It seems as though the early marketing surrounding Brad Ingelsby&#39;s next HBO television show will (and should) relate to the fact that it is set in the same universe and town as the critically acclaimed 2021 limited series starring Kate Winslet. Since Ruffalo has already teased that the two shows will be connected, audiences will expect to see concrete evidence of how Task relates to Mare of Easttown in the episodes.






Task will begin filming in March 2024.




It wouldn&#39;t make sense if the correlation between Ingelsby&#39;s two projects is glossed over when Task premieres. If they exist in the same universe, the filmmaker must take advantage of this aspect of the story. It would be a missed opportunity if the writers didn&#39;t capitalize on Mare of Easttown&#39;s success while crafting what could be HBO&#39;s next hit limited series.

 How Task Can Capitalize On Its Shared Universe With Mare Of Easttown 
          




Integrating significant features from the Kate Winslet limited series into Task would be a great way to keep the popular show alive without HBO having to greenlight Mare of Easttown season 2. Both Winslet and creator Brad Ingelsby have expressed that they are open to continuing the story, and the best way to do that is via Mark Ruffalo&#39;s upcoming miniseries. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways for Task to make the most out of its shared universe with the 2021 crime drama.

First and foremost, Winslet can reprise her role as Mare. Perhaps she can assist Ruffalo&#39;s FBI agent character in an episode or two, which would undoubtedly be the strongest way to capitalize on the connection between the two shows. Or, other actors from the original series besides Winslet can make cameos in the upcoming miniseries. Additionally, Task can name-drop characters from Mare of Easttown throughout the episodes, emphasizing to the audience that the stories exist in the same universe.



Mare of Easttown is available to stream on Max.
