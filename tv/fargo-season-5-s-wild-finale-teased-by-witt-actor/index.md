Witt Farr actor Lamorne Morris teases a wild finale for Fargo season 5. The pieces are in place for a dramatic last episode of what has been a memorable season 5 for Noah Hawley’s Coen Brothers-inspired series. Confrontation looms for Dot (Juno Temple), Roy (Jon Hamm), Lorraine (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Ole (Sam Spruell), Gator (Joe Keery) and Indira (Richa Moorjani) after the events of season 5, episode 9 “The Useless Hand.”

It remains to be seen how Fargo season 5 will wrap up its compelling story, but for his part, Witt actor Morris promises things will get wild, while teasing some awards-worthy performances by his co-stars. Check out what he said in the space below (via Variety):


I don’t want to spoil anything, but it might be the wildest. I can tell you, a lot of actors on this show deserve some awards. Juno Temple, Sam Spruell, Jon Hamm, Jennifer [Jason Leigh] — everybody on this show, when I watch it, I’m like, “These m-----------s are dope.” I would just tell the audience to watch out for great performances, and the story gets wild. It definitely gets crazy.






 Who Will Live And Who Will Die In Fargo Season 5, Episode 10 “Bisquik” 
          

Fargo season 5, episode 10&#39;s title’s callback to Dot furiously mixing Bisquick for daughter Scotty’s breakfast seems to point toward a happy reunion for the Lyon family, but it’s also possible that breakfast isn’t what Dot will actually be whipping up in the season finale. Dot is indeed on the loose at the Tillman Ranch after finding a surprise rescuer in Ole Munch, and given Mrs. Lyon’s resourcefulness, it could be something literally explosive she’s set to concoct.

As a rampaging Roy Tillman gathers his militia for a looming battle with the National Guard, Dot could find more unexpected allies, including a redemption-seeking Gator. Then there’s Morris’ Witt Farr, who feels himself to be in Dot’s debt after she saved his life at the filling station shootout earlier in the season. How all the season’s different character arcs will ultimately converge is yet to be seen, but violence is in store for everyone involved, and it’s entirely possible that not every character will survive the carnage to come.






Fargo’s season 5 finale airs on January 16 on FX.




For Fargo season 5 to kill off Dot would be a shocking move, so it seems likely she will live to rejoin her family, and share a moment with Wayne that calls back to the touching and hopeful final scene between Marge and Norm in the Coen Brothers’ original Fargo movie. Gator’s fate is much more up in the air, as is the fate of Witt, who may have to sacrifice himself in order to pay off his debt to Dot. Of all the show’s characters, the villainous Roy is the one whose death would be most satisfying. That’s why it’s possible Hawley will subvert expectations by letting the bad guy sheriff get away after what Morris has teased will be a wild finish to a wild season of TV.
