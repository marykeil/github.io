  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Kody Brown is using a martyr persona to deflect from the fact that he is the one responsible for the downfall of the Brown family.
Kody prioritized his relationship with Robyn over his other wives - this hurt his other spouses.
Kody&rsquo;s victim stance isn&rsquo;t justified, as he aggressively iced out his unloved spouses.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives star Kody Brown always feel sorry for himself. He acts like everyone&rsquo;s persecuted him. That isn&rsquo;t true at all. Kody is a bully.</p>
<p>Since his spiritual unions with Meri, Janelle and Christine Brown imploded, Sister Wives season 18 star Kody Brown&rsquo;s been wallowing in self-pity and feuding with Christine&rsquo;s new husband David Woolley - Kody&rsquo;s martyr shtick&rsquo;s so tired. To make himself look like a better person, Kody&rsquo;s playing the victim, but he&rsquo;s actually the one who brought the Brown family down. The fact that he tries to make himself look like he&rsquo;s hard done by says a lot about him. This is the man who pushed away a trio of wives because he just stopped trying. After neglecting three good women for years, Kody&rsquo;s playing his little violin.</p>
<p>Way back when, Kody was polygamy&rsquo;s poster boy. Steeped in the &ldquo;out there&rsquo; beliefs of an extreme Mormon sect, Kody believed that plural marriage was the holiest relationship model. However, unlike the Mormon martyr Joseph Smith, who was &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; (a Mormon term for &ldquo;joined with&rdquo;) with forty women, Kody hasn&rsquo;t been penalized for sharing his beliefs. Sure, he fled Utah in the dead of night, trying to avoid the legal repercussions of breaking polygamy laws, but Kody never got arrested. Now, he pretends that everyone&rsquo;s persecuting him for no good reason.</p>

<p>Sister Wives&rsquo; Kody Brown&rsquo;s Been Rewarded For Hurting Women
Aside From Fan Shade, Kody Brown&rsquo;s Benefited From Polygamy</p>
<p>Since he embraced plural marriage, Kody&rsquo;s been richly rewarded. In exchange for &ldquo;sealing&rdquo; with four women, he&rsquo;s gained fame and fortune. Now that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;unsealed&rdquo; from three females, he&rsquo;s finally able to focus on his &ldquo;queen,&rdquo; Robyn Brown. However, he acts like some &ldquo;Church of the Devil&rdquo; (a Mormon term for a religious organization that goes against Mormon beliefs) is targeting him and trying to ruin his life. Kody&rsquo;s paranoid, seeing enemies everywhere. As well, he&rsquo;s abandoned so many aspects of his spiritual beliefs. While he did so, Kody pretended that he was suffering more than the people around him.</p>
<p>In his plural marriages, Kody was the one inflicting pain. However, he tends to focus on his own emotional world, oblivious to the havoc that he&rsquo;s wreaked.</p>
<p>Will Kody get to the Mormon postmortal spirit world, &ldquo;paradise,&rdquo; after basically breaking his vows to Meri, Janelle and Christine? Maybe not. He wasn&rsquo;t supposed to neglect them like he did. Kody wasn&rsquo;t supposed to make one wife his soulmate and leave the others to fry. Paradise is only for those who remain faithful to Mormon beliefs until death.</p>
<p>While male dominance in the Mormon faith is a very real thing, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that making women feel lonely and sad is what God wants.</p>
<p>Mormons believe in an Eternal Progression which includes three stages: premortality, mortality and immortality. Sometimes, amid these beliefs, it seems like the rights and feelings of women are overlooked. In fact, Religionnews contributor Jana Riess believes that Mormon men are:</p>
<p>&ldquo;groomed not to listen to women&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sister Wives&rsquo; Kody Brown Never Really Listened To His Exes
Why Doesn&rsquo;t Kody Brown Realize That He&rsquo;s The Problem?</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s tried to make himself seem like a sympathetic figure. While doing so, he has attempted to cloak some low conduct. As he&rsquo;s played the martyr, just as Robyn does, Kody&rsquo;s conveniently forgotten about the damage that he&rsquo;s done. His exes didn&rsquo;t feel like they were heard - they lost their &ldquo;voices&rdquo; during their grueling spiritual unions with the uber-patriarch. However, Kody had no trouble listening to his dainty princess Robyn, who fulfills him on every level. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t give his other wives the same grace. Would a true martyr ignore the pain and suffering of three women while lavishing the fourth with affection, money and more? No.</p>
<p>When Kody mistreated Meri, Janelle and Christine and gave Robyn one hundred percent, he created a toxic dynamic. The bad blood that this decision generated is still circulating. Now, the exes take to Instagram to share their grievances - they also chat with reporters. His exes haven&rsquo;t forgiven him. Likewise, Kody hasn&rsquo;t forgiven them for leaving him.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s understandable that his unloved exes would want to vent, his own anger is baffling. These women bent over backwards to accommodate him. They did the housework, gave birth, cared for children, and let him be in charge. In return, they had to deal with a frosty, irritable and deceptive mate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Kody&rsquo;s exes who got a raw deal, not him. He doesn&rsquo;t want people to understand this painful truth.</p>
<p>In Sister Wives season 18, Kody told Janelle she didn&rsquo;t listen, but before that, she accused him of not listening to her. This seemed to trigger Kody. He became very defensive, pulling on his brown leather jacket and running for the hills. Kody said she didn&rsquo;t listen right before he fled. Since he got so angry, Janelle might have touched a nerve. On some level, Kody must understand how he&rsquo;s wronged Janelle and the other exes. There&rsquo;s no way that he filters all of that out. So, when he&rsquo;s confronted, he goes berserk. Sometimes, facing the truth is hard. In life, everyone has to face difficult truths. Some remain in denial while others learn from constructive criticism.</p>
<p>The issue is that Kody refuses to learn. Instead, he embraces a victim mentality that really doesn&rsquo;t fit him. He chose to put Robyn first. Kody enjoyed doing that. It hurt the other wives - that was clear to all. However, he tries to deflect. Kody never really wants to admit that falling in love with Robyn changed him. Because he only loved one wife, he pulled away from the others. He was mean to them. When he was cruel, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly martyrdom in action. The martyr is supposed to endure cruelty rather than doling it out.</p>
<p>How is Kody Brown A Victim? He Just Isn&rsquo;t
Kody Brown Engineered Everything That&rsquo;s Happening To Him</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s accused his exes of some bad things, including parental alienation. However, as the clip above shows (via TLC Australia at YouTube), all four Brown women have felt ignored by &ldquo;monster&rdquo; Kody. So, who&rsquo;s really the problem here? Obviously, it&rsquo;s him. He&rsquo;s the one common denominator running through all of this drama. He&rsquo;s connected to all four women. However, he doesn&rsquo;t want the world to know that he&rsquo;s the bad guy. He wants to dupe other people into believing that the villains are other people. He invests an extraordinary amount of energy into trying to convince the masses that he&rsquo;s a martyr.</p>
<p>Like a lion disguised as a sacrificial lamb, Kody cut down the herd but pretended that his wives rejected him. In actuality, he pushed them out very coldly. Had they stayed, they would have needed to accept his version of their new normal, which was his monogamy with Robyn within a plural marriage. The other wives would be iced out romantically, possibly for a lifetime.</p>
<p>The wives did what was logical and left - Kody engineered that outcome. He&rsquo;s not a sacrificial lamb - he had a goal and worked towards it. Robyn helped him. The goal was kept secret but still very obvious. To continue with the lion and lamb analogy, Kody&rsquo;s a predator rather than prey. If he was &ldquo;prey&rdquo; as he wants people to believe he is, then he wouldn&rsquo;t have treated three of his wives so poorly. He wouldn&rsquo;t have humiliated them over and over again. Those were acts of aggression.</p>
<p>Martyrs Are Peaceful Beings
Kody Brown Keeps Insulting His Exes</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s not exactly the Dalai Lama. He&rsquo;s not someone who believes in peace. Unlike the spiritual guru Ram Dass, who advised people to love everyone, Kody&rsquo;s extremely hateful, dissing the trio of women who bore his children and put up with his nonsense for decades. Martyrs are peaceful and Kody doesn&rsquo;t fit that profile. Over the past few years, he&rsquo;s gotten even more unpleasant and ornery. Even his face has changed, and not just because of the natural aging process. Kody&rsquo;s hardened - his eyes don&rsquo;t exactly have an innocent look. In the old days, he usually had a big smile on his face. He seemed optimistic - now, he&rsquo;s just so negative and miserable.</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s paid a price for having Robyn.He&rsquo;s traded three wives for the fourth. Sure, he technically stayed in the plural marriage for a long time, but his heart wasn&rsquo;t in it. Martyrs have great big hearts. When he plays the victim after making women cry and feel bad about themselves, it&rsquo;s very easy to scoff at him (or worse).</p>
<p>Did he have a great big heart when he told Christine he didn&rsquo;t want to sleep with her anymore? Was he showing his loving, martyr-like spirit when he had to be cajoled into giving Meri a tasty S&rsquo;Mores during a family BBQ? Was his inner beauty coming out when he told Janelle to resolve all his problems with their kids? He wasn&rsquo;t exactly self-sacrificing when he told Janelle to choose between him and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic. So many times, Kody&rsquo;s acted like a selfish oaf. He&rsquo;s crass, classless and not exactly a role model for Christianity.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, the Browns seemed to care less about religion. It&rsquo;s not just Kody who changed. As the years passed, the Browns may have realized that life is short - possibly, there&rsquo;s nothing else. Most people question &ldquo;eternity&rdquo; now and then, no matter how religious they are. Human beings are hard-wired to be curious about the journey after death, if there is one. So, perhaps some doubts about the afterlife crept in, acting on the Browns and influencing their decision-making.</p>
<p>So, Sister Wives was centered on religion and on normalizing polygamy - this goal wasn&rsquo;t achieved and Kody&rsquo;s selfish streak is the reason why. In fact, he singlehandedly (well, Robyn helped) proved that plural marriage is emotional torture for most of its participants. Who wants to live with that kind of jealousy and misery all the time? What could be worth that kind of chronic suffering? That&rsquo;s real martyrdom and Kody didn&rsquo;t experience that - it&rsquo;s Meri, Janelle and Christine who did. Kody was allowed to choose - he had the power to favor one wife and hurt the rest. This kind of patriarchal power is way out of date.</p>
<p>Kody Brown Needs To Wake Up
&ldquo;Woke Kody Brown&rdquo; Would Be A Nice Change</p>
<p>A lot of information about life is out there&hellip; modern life. There&rsquo;s really no excuse for Kody to be so backwards and old-fashioned. He can be a &ldquo;woke&rdquo; person. He can change his mindset about women, which led him to put one wife on a pedestal while mistreating the others. Kody thinks women should be just like Robyn - she&rsquo;s like his Snow White or something. He&rsquo;s Prince Charming. However, these two aren&rsquo;t really so enchanting. It&rsquo;s great that they&rsquo;re in love, but they should have bailed out of the plural marriage. Both of them knew what was up. They knew they were all about each other.</p>
<p>They stayed in it for selfish reasons. Kody probably wanted the money that came with being one of the world&rsquo;s most famous polygamists. He may find that being with just Robyn isn&rsquo;t exactly good for business. Fans got used to seeing the Brown family trying to work out problems while the cameras rolled. Now, the tension&rsquo;s been dialed down considerably. Watching Kody and Robyn bicker doesn&rsquo;t exactly sound like a good time. Also, the novelty element is being eliminated. It&rsquo;s polygamy that made Kody different. Without it, he becomes an ordinary man with typical problems. That isn&rsquo;t really so riveting. It&rsquo;s too mundane.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a martyr, but he&rsquo;s not totally evil either. He seems to be riddled with guilt, which is acting on him and making him very moody indeed. Kody may actually be ashamed of a lot of things he&rsquo;s done. He may worry about the financial ramifications of being a one-woman man. He&rsquo;s clearly got a lot on his mind. Embracing a truly peaceful mindset, which includes less looking back and brooding, will be extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>If Kody learns to live in the moment, he&rsquo;ll discover the secret of life. The future&rsquo;s never guaranteed, and he has a woman who loves him, a nice house&hellip;he has a lot. Only gratitude can save Sister Wives &ldquo;martyr&rdquo; Kody.</p>
