 Battlestar Galactica&#39;s Final Five Cylons were unnecessary characters and added little to the overall plot. 
 Starbuck faced unfair criticism due to misogyny, as her flaws were no different from other beloved characters.

## Literature Review
Battlestar Galactica&#39;s reboot is regaled as one of the best sci-fi series, but what harsh realities pop up when watching it 20 years later?




When rewatching Battlestar Galactica&#39;s reboot twenty years later, many harsh realities become apparent. Between 2004 and 2009, SyFy (then called Sci-Fi) aired the Battlestar Galactica reboot, exploring the lives of the humans who survived a war against aliens called Cylons. The crewmembers aboard the Galactica go searching for a mythical planet called Earth. This reboot is widely considered one of the most influential science fiction series and one of the best TV shows about space.
Battlestar Galactica maintains a large cult following due to the incredible storylines and characters. Many aspects of the show, like the political tension and realistic space battles, hold up over time. Unfortunately, not every part of Battlestar Galactica still has the same impact twenty years later. Some harsh realities come up about the series and fandom when looking back on it with fresh eyes.

 10  Battlestar Galactica&#39;s Final Five Weren&#39;t Really That Important 
The Final Five Were An Allegory Instead Of Characters


 







Battlestar Galactica season 4 centers on the Final Five Cylons, but the show never offers a compelling reason to invest in the characters. Rather than influencing the plot in a meaningful way, the Final Five mostly bicker with one another. Their primary purpose in the story – explaining the origin of the Cylons – isn’t all that necessary in retrospect. It seems like the writers of Battlestar Galactica created the Final Five because they wanted to explore the theme of artificial intelligence, but they never developed the characters past the point. While thematically functional, this makes them narratively useless.
            
 
 7 Biggest Problems With Battlestar Galactica&#39;s Final Five Cylon Twist 
The Final Five was the biggest swing taken by Battlestar Galactica&#39;s 2004 reboot, and the twist created a range of narrative and character problems.









 9  Much Of The Hate Against Starbuck Comes From Misogyny 
Starbuck Didn&#39;t Deserve All The Hate She Got
        

Starbuck is one of the most divisive characters of Battlestar Galactica, and a large part of the hate can be attributed to misogyny. Many viewers didn’t like that the series changed Starbuck from a man to a woman. She was criticized for her take-charge attitude, but men in the series were praised for leading. Starbuck was held to an unreasonably high standard and ripped apart whenever she showed insecurities or emotions.
That isn’t to say she’s a perfect character by any means. She can be judgmental, reckless, and morally ambiguous at times. Those aren’t necessarily good things. However, these kinds of flaws also appear in some of the most beloved Battlestar Galactica characters. The same level of criticism should be applied across the board.





 8  Battlestar Galactica’s Should Have Ended After Season 3 
Battlestar Galactica Season 4 Weakened The Series


 







While none of the seasons of Battlestar Galactica are without merit, the divisive ending wasn’t the only massive issue with season 4. At least half of the season felt like filler episodes with no connection to the overarching narrative. The tone drastically shifted from a compelling political sci-fi to a melodrama. The Final Five had little to no purpose. The story started weaving religiosity into the plot to the detriment of the series. With all the weaknesses in Battlestar Galactica season 4, the writers would’ve been better off ending the series after season 3. They could have wrapped up with Gaius Baltar’s trial, dropping the reveal about the Final Five.





 7  The Cylons NEVER Had A Plan During Battlestar Galactica 
The Opening Credits Of Battlestar Galactica Lied
        

The opening credits for Battlestar Galactica tout the idea that the Cylons had a secret plan they’re working towards. Despite this, co-creator Ronald D. Moore revealed during the Battlestar Galactica reunion panel at the 2017 ATX Television Festival that this was entirely false (via Los Angeles Times). The Cylons never had a plan other than to kill the humans that they deemed responsible for their human nature. This fact becomes abundantly clear when rewatching the series 20 years later. They never reveal an underlying motive for the Cylons’ behavior.
Battlestar Galactica was created by Glen A. Larson and Ronald D. Moore. 






 6  Anders And Starbuck Weren’t A Good Couple 
This Couple Didn&#39;t Seem To Like Each Other
        

There are very few good romantic pairings In Battlestar Galactica, but Anders and Starbuck are one of the worst. Anders and Starbuck have an adversarial relationship that only gets worse once they get together romantically. They didn’t have many sweet moments where they seemed to really appreciate and enjoy one another’s company. Additionally, the storyline set their relationship up as more of a filler because Starbuck was clearly in love with her ex-boyfriend, Lee.
Anders and Starbuck’s relationship only gets worse when compared to the other Starbuck pairing. The pair have a deep emotional bond that develops over time. Lee also doesn’t hesitate to accept Starbuck after her mysterious return. This deeper level of their relationship isn’t found with Anders and Starbuck.





 5  Battlestar Galactica Wasted Dr. Sherman Cottle 
Dr. Cottle Could&#39;ve Had A Better Character Arc
        

Dr. Sherman Cottle plays an important role in the plot of Battlestar Galactica, fixing up a character any time they get sick or injured. He has an unwavering commitment to upholding medical ethics. However, Battlestar Galactica’s reboot wastes Dr. Cottle by underdeveloping his character. They fail to explore the mental impact of his job, his motivations, or his personality. Sadly, upon rewatching the series, it seems that the writers viewed him as a narrative tool rather than a fleshed-out character.





 4  Six Killing A Baby Was Unnecessarily Cruel 
The Battlestar Galactica Miniseries Wasn&#39;t Clear About The Motive For The Murder
        

One of the most devastating deaths in Battlestar Galactica occurs when Six snaps the neck of a baby in the miniseries. During the 2017 ATX TV Festival, actress Tricia Helfer – who plays Caprica Six – explains that the murder was intended as a mercy killing and a display of empathy since Six knew the bombs were coming. However, Six didn’t display any remorse or emotional pain during the act or right afterward, making the mercy killing unclear. By not making the mercy killing clear within the narrative, the action seems ruthless and cruel.





 3  God Should Never Have Had A Role In Battlestar Galactica 
Theology Harmed The Narrative Of Battlestar Galactica Season 4
        

Fans of Battlestar Galactica generally reviled the religiosity and theology of season 4 when it first came out, but it’s so much worse when rewatching the series 20 years later. On top of changing the tone of the show, God became a deus ex machina – offering a contrived and implausible solution to an unsolvable problem. This takes away all the emotional buildup, the character-driven narrative, and the world-building throughout Battlestar Galactica. It would’ve been better to have an unhappy ending rather than making the rest of Battlestar Galactica obsolete.





 2  Starbuck Shouldn’t Have Survived Her Ship’s Explosion 
Starbuck Surviving Made No Sense In Battlestar Galactica
        

In Battlestar Galactica season 3, episode 17, &#34;Maelstrom,&#34; Starbuck gets into a conflict while pursuing a Cylon vessel. By the end of the sequence, her ship explodes, theoretically killing her. However, she and her ship appear undamaged only three episodes later. This makes no logical sense, and Ronald D. Moore’s explanation doesn’t help at all. He stated she can be whatever the audience wants her to be (via Discover Magazine), providing no clarity whether she’s alive, dead, an angel, a spirit, or a diety. The only benefit to her surviving the crash is the entertaining Battlestar Galactica Starbuck Cylon theory.





 1  Battlestar Galactica Probably Shouldn’t Get Another Reboot 
Another Reboot Would Struggle To Live Up To The 2004 Version


 







Many people are rewatching the original series 20 years later due to Peacock&#39;s Battlestar Galactica reboot in the works. No matter how much the audience loves the 2004 show, the series really shouldn’t get another reboot for two primary reasons. Firstly, the show provides a long-form allegory for 9/11 and the Global War On Terrorism. War is more relevant than ever with the horrifying conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine, but that creates a problem. Another Battlestar Galactica reboot would likely be thematically redundant and offer nothing new to the conversation, raising the question of why it’s necessary at all.
Secondly, part of the reason the series is considered a masterpiece is that Battlestar Galactica changed the sci-fi genre forever with its unique narrative approaches and realistic battles. Technology and filmmaking are progressing at an unprecedented rate, though, making it difficult for a new Battlestar Galactica reboot to achieve the same kind of status as a revolutionary TV series.
