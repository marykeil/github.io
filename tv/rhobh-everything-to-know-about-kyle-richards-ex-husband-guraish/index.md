## Literature Review

Guraish Aldjufrie is the ex-husband of RHOBH&#39;s Kyle Richards. Here is everything fans need to know about the real estate tycoon and father to Farrah.





Viewers met Kyle for the first time when she first appeared on RHOBH in 2010. She presents herself on the show as a fun-loving mother of four with a supportive and loving husband. Before joining RHOBH and meeting Mauricio, Kyle was previously in a relationship with Guraish. The two met at a Tina Turner concert, but Guraish didn&#39;t speak English. Guraish then asked Kyle on a date, and the rest was history. The couple fell in love and got married, and shortly after, they had Kyle&#39;s eldest daughter Farrah Aldjufrie. However, the pair divorced after two years of marriage. Kyle and Guraish are still close, with Kyle often talking about how wonderful her ex-husband is.

 Who is Kyle&#39;s Ex-Husband, Guraish Aldjufrie? 

 

According to BravoTV, Guraish is an Indonesian businessman of Dutch and Arabic descent. He currently resides in Bali, Thailand, working in land development and real estate, traveling to the U.S. to see his daughter and for business. Like Kyle&#39;s current husband, Guraish is very successful in real estate, running a successful company in Indonesia and the U.S. Coming from a wealthy Indonesian family, Guraish has grown his family&#39;s wealth through his business. His mother and father are also in real estate, paving the way for Guraish, whose daughter with Kyle, Farrah, is engaged, in their company. There is very little information in terms of Guraish&#39;s personal life as he is not on any social media platforms. He is described as a timid person and is always focused on his work.




In an episode from RHOBH season 12, Kyle opened up about the main reason behind her divorce from Guraish. She explained that the pair were madly in love; however, the stress of having a newborn and the lack of maturity put a strain on the marriage. Despite the divorce, Kyle explained that the pair remain good friends. They still care a lot for each other and always put their best foot forward for their daughter Farrah. Kyle even expressed how close Mauricio is with Guraish and how the two have even done business deals together. Kyle revealed in her ex-husband Guraish never got remarried, expressing her sadness about this as he is a great man. Guraish did appear in two episodes of RHOBH in 2011 to celebrate Farrah&#39;s college graduation. Other than that, Guraish has remained on the down-low.

With little information about Guraish, fans look to Kyle and Farrah for updates on the real estate tycoon. Even though Guraish likes to keep to himself, fans are eager to know how he is doing and what he has planned for the future in business and life. While the family is very close, it is nice that they still spend holidays together and are still friends after the divorce. Since Kyle, who RHOBH fans feel can be two-faced, has maintained a friendship with Guraish, many hope to see him appear on another The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills episode one day.
