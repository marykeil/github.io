# 10 Best Ghibli-Like Anime Series Every Miyazaki Fan Needs to Watch


## SUMMARY 


 Ghibli-like anime series are expanded and condensed into episodic TV formats, but replicating Miyazaki&#39;s traditional animation style is nearly impossible. 
 Many anime series share themes and elements with Ghibli films, such as nature, environmental awareness, and pre-adolescent innocence. 
 Though no TV series can fully replicate Ghibli&#39;s animation, efforts are made to create beautiful limited-style animation using techniques like &#34;Sakuga.&#34;

## Literature Review
Not many anime can hold a candle to the quality of Ghibli films, but these series are a much-watch for Miyazaki fans. 




The best Ghibli-like anime series carry with them the grandeur of a Miyazaki film, but are expanded and then condensed into an episodic TV medium. However, this is an impossible task because of Miyazaki’s preference towards the traditional animation style called “manga eiga,” “eiga” meaning movie in Japanese, and the phrase referring to the level of detail in each frame of animation resembling the panels of manga in motion. Prominent anime scholar Thomas Lamarre works extensively with this concept.
Although Ghibli films utilize the full animation style of the manga eiga in contrast to the limited animation style that dates back to Tezuka Osamu and Astro Boy, there are distinct features of Ghibli structures and narratives that carry over to many anime series. Some themes common in Ghibli films are nature, environmental awareness, pre-adolescent innocence, and more. In terms of animation, although no series fully replicates what Ghibli does, there are still efforts made towards making limited-style animation as beautiful as possible, evident in techniques such as “Sakuga,” which describes a moment of elevated animation quality during an important scene.

 10  Kotaro Lives Alone Is the Epitome of Innocence 
Based on the manga by Tsuruma Mami


 







Kotaro Lives Alone is an emotional freight train that sounds its horn through the dead of night, encapsulating innocent moments of hardship that question human morality. The series follows Kotaro, who is four years old, and like the title explains, he lives by himself. First abused and then having escaped, Kotaro rapidly matures, but no level of maturity is able to wipe away the innocence of somebody that young. Eventually, Kotaro’s neighbors find out about him and take it upon themselves to make sure he feels safe and welcome. Kotaro’s character is reminiscent of those in the Ghibli film, Grave of the Fireflies, which was directed by Miyazaki’s co-founder, Takahata Isao.

 9  Fruits Basket Weaves a Ghibli-esque Fantasy 
Based on the manga by Takaya Natsuki


 







Fruits Basket is a touching shojo anime that first had an adaptation in 2001 and then a remastering in 2019 that saw explosive popularity.

However, it turns out her campsite is in the esteemed Souma estate’s backyard.

 8  Chihayafuru Is a Beautiful Rendering of Narrative and Character 
Based on the manga Suetsugu Yuki
        

Although the anime Chihayafuru does not exactly share abundant themes with Ghibli films, the similarity appears in its narrative structure and character focus. Chihayafuru follows Chihaya Ayase, an air-headed beauty who cares for nothing but the sport of Karuta, a traditional Japanese card game similar to Concentration. The anime weaves a cohesive and exhilarating story of both personal development and the fostering of relationships. Alongside the hardships that arise in a typical sports anime, the story of Chihayafuru is further elevated with its poetic features and heavy internal character focus, qualities resembling those of many of Miyazaki’s films.

 7  Barakamon Has Children, Calligraphy, and Countrysides 
Based on the web manga by Yoshino Satsuki
        

The story of Barakamon quietly condenses many features of Miyazaki’s films, from cute innocent children to beautiful countryside nature. The anime follows a head-strong protagonist named Handa Seishuu, who is a talented calligrapher. He moves to the remote Goto Islands by command of his father after he assaulted a veteran calligrapher who criticized his work. Seishuu meets the island residents, and they welcome him into their small community much more warmly than he expected. Not only does the scenery of Barakamon resemble those of Ghibli films, but the character Naru, a small and energetic girl who Seishuu meets, is similar to characters like Markl from Howl’s Moving Castle or Setsuko from Grave of the Fireflies.

 6  The Ancient Magus’ Bride Boasts a Magical Cast 
Based on the manga by Yamazaki Kore
        

Ancient Magus’ Bride is not a typical fantasy anime, nor is it one that flips the genre on its head, but it’s a slow, sparkling romance that revels in the beauty and serenity of nature and its magic. The story follows Hatori Chise, a human girl who is sold at an auction to Elias Ainsworth, a magus whose head resembles a deer’s skull. The most surprising part of the story is that Chise willingly gave up her freedom and entered into the auction hall herself. Lucky for her, Elias’ kind nature guides her through a magical world very much akin to those built by Miyazaki and his peers.

Based on the light novel by Akatsuki Kana and Takase Akiko


 







Violet Evergarden is an exquisitely crafted anime with the animation of Kyoto Animation’s best artists, and a story that will hold the hearts of all literary enthusiasts.

By the end of the war, she lost both her arms and the only person who cared for her, Major Gilbert Bougainvillea. Devoid of her purpose, Violet attempts to reckon with her place in a peaceful society and eventually takes up the work of an “auto memory doll,” a ghostwriter of sorts. This beautiful story and its stunning animation are as close to Ghibli’s quality as it can get.

Based on the manga by Umino Chica
        

Aside from the riveting story of March Comes In Like a Lion, this anime features some of the best and most frequent displays of animation prowess available in modern anime.

With such frequent use of detailed animation, the series resembles the movement of many Ghibli films, and even its character-focused narrative is consistent with that of many of Miyazaki’s works.

 1  Lupin III Is Graced By the Hand of Miyazaki 
Based on the manga by Monkey Punch
        

Lupin III is an anime of heists, schemes, and rowdy sophistication, but most importantly, its creation witnessed the direct participation of Miyazaki Hayao. The anime first aired in 1971, predating the founding of Studio Ghibli by 14 years. This series is a rare instance of Miyazaki’s masterful insight prior to his rise to hegemonic fame. Lupin III follows protagonist Arsène Lupin III, who is the grandson of world-famous thief Arsène Lupin, as he steals his way across criminal circles, the ICPO, and the world. When searching for TV series similar to Ghibli films, there is no better choice than Lupin III because it was created by the same hands that built Ghibli.
