## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé fans discovered Nikki Exotika&#39;s photo from when she used to be a man named Jason Torres. Jason bears a strong resemblance to Justin.




90 Day Fiancé fans are discovering how shockingly similar season 10 star Justin AKA Igor looks to Nikki Sanders from when she was a teenage boy. Justin is a 36-year-old man from Chişinău, Moldova. Justin met Nikki, 47, 17 years ago in his country. Nikki was there to meet her then-boyfriend, a Russian man who had been deported to Moldova. Nikki found out that her boyfriend was cheating on her with someone else, and she decided to look for a new lover there. Nikki met Justin on a friendship website. Justin was just 20 years old at the time, while Nikki was 30.




Nikki and Justin dated for two years before they got engaged and she brought him to the U.S. However, just two weeks after his arrival, Nikki accidentally told Justin she was a trans woman and left him traumatized. A 90 Day Fiancé fan on Reddit called u/ginnydyer_ has now shared a photo from when Nikki was a man named Jason Torres.


 

hey added the picture of Nikki before her gender reassignment surgery next to a photo of Justin from 2023. They asked their fellow reality TV show viewers, &#34;Is it just me or does Justin slightly resemble Nikki as a teen?&#34; The post has over 700 upvotes showing fans do see the resemblance between teenage boy Nikki and her now fiancé Justin.

 Is 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Nikki Overly Obsessed With Herself? 
          

&#34;Apparently she&#39;s attracted to the way she used to look, despite having changed everything,&#34; wrote user spkrinsb in the comments. &#34;Oh wow! That&#39;s a crazy resemblance and then for her to go after him there has to be some kind of subconscious reason,&#34; commented Libra_lady_88. Fans noticed how even their hair is styled in the same way in both photos. They called Nikki a narcissist for being in love with herself and hence choosing to date Justin. The resemblance between Nikki as a boy and Justin was too &#34;freaky&#34; for a few fans to accept. It appears to be crazier than the story of how Nikki and Justin met, split, and reunited almost two decades later to get back into a relationship.

Justin went back home when he came to know that the woman he was getting married to once used to be male. He took a lot of years to try to understand the complexities of Nikki&#39;s gender identity but remained in touch with her nevertheless. Nikki and Justin dated other people over the years. However, they were single when Nikki suggested they should give their relationship another chance. They got engaged during an exotic vacation in Mexico and Nikki applied for Justin&#39;s K-1 visa once again. Nikki also started supporting Justin financially. In the back of her head, she kept wondering if Justin was indeed a changed man.




The current episodes of 90 Day Fiancé season 10 show Nikki visiting Justin in Moldova ahead of his K-1 visa approval. Nikki has been demanding intimacy from Justin, but he has been showing reluctance. Nikki is yet to meet Justin&#39;s family to find out if they accept her now knowing about her past. Nikki stands out in Justin&#39;s country because of her unique appearance, her clothes, and her makeup, which makes Justin uncomfortable while taking her out to public places. Still, Nikki and Justin have a strong relationship that might just end in happily ever after once Justin moves to New Jersey all over again.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
