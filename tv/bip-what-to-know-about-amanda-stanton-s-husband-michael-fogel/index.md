## Literature Review
Bachelor in Paradise alum Amanda Stanton found the one. Here are some fascinating facts about her husband, Michael Fogel.




While Amanda Stanton didn&#39;t find love on Bachelor in Paradise, she later discovered her husband, Michael Fogel. The Bachelor franchise introduced Amanda in 2016 when she competed for Ben Higgins&#39; heart on The Bachelor. Since then, the mom of two has had her fair share of relationships, including a brief engagement to former The Bachelorette winner Josh Murray. Amanda gave Michael her final rose, as the BIP alum said yes to his proposal and married him in September 2022. Their lives have only grown more intertwined since.




Amanda, originally from Mission Viejo, CA, had known Michael for years when they started dating in 2020, after Amanda starred in The Bachelor (and in Paradise), looking for love. In addition to her reality TV career, Amanda has two daughters, Kinsley and Charlie, from her marriage to Nick Buonfiglio. She was a fan favorite, and it was thrilling when she found Michael. ​​​​​However, he was a relative newcomer to the reality TV sphere. Who is Amanda&#39;s husband, Michael?


 Michael Fogel&#39;s Background 

 

Michael, 33, was born on March 12, 1990. While he keeps a relatively low profile, it is known that he hails from New York, where most of his family still resides, including his younger sister, Halle. After studying at Loyola Marymount University in California and graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree, Michael decided to move to the West Coast. He resides in Beverly Hills and works in the Los Angeles area, where he remains close to Amanda and her two girls.






 Michael Fogel&#39;s Job 
          

Michael has a finance and commercial real estate background and has bounced around since 2016, working at four different real estate companies. Since December 2020, according to Michael&#39;s LinkedIn, he&#39;s been working as a mortgage originator for a commercial property mortgage lender. Before that job, Michael worked as a director for a real estate company. He held that job from May 2019 to November 2020. Amanda&#39;s husband worked as a director in the North American office of a global real estate provider, from January 2017 to May 2019. He now seems solid in his career in CMBS Originations at LMF Commercial.



 Michael Fogel Dated The Bachelor&#39;s Corinne Olympios 
          




As for Michael&#39;s personal life, his relationship with Amanda isn&#39;t his first romance with a reality TV star. Michael previously dated Farrah Aldjufrie (the eldest daughter of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Kyle Richards) from 2016 to 2017. He then briefly dated Bachelor alum Corinne Olympios in December 2017. Michael&#39;s relationship with Corinne caused some drama, even though they both stated that they were never in a serious relationship, as Corinne expressed distaste over her ex&#39;s relationship with Amanda. She further expanded upon these thoughts publicly.

In early 2021, Corinne shared her thoughts about Amanda and Michael while chatting on the &#34;Here For The Right Reasons&#34; podcast. She also spoke about her friendship with Amanda, whom she met during season 4. She shared that while they would be there for each other when needed, Amanda&#39;s relationship with Michael didn&#39;t sit well with her about their friendship. She also described the situation as feeling uncomfortable, as she wouldn&#39;t look twice at any of her friends&#39; boyfriends. While she expressed her thoughts on Amanda and Michael, relationships can be messy, and the two seem happy now, even if the path to getting there was less than perfect.






 Amanda &amp; Michael Are Having A Baby 

 

While Michael and Amanda most likely met through Corinne, they didn&#39;t get together until November 2020, almost three years after Corinne and Michael&#39;s relationship. The couple didn&#39;t go public with their romance until Valentine&#39;s Day in 2021. Since then, the pair have been going strong, with Amanda gushing over her favorite things about Michael and often sharing pictures of herself with him and her daughters, Kinsley and Charlie. It&#39;s clear he has incorporated the girls into his life and considers them family.

The two married in September 2022 and adopted a new dog, Moose, in late 2022. Happily, Amanda is pregnant with her and Michael&#39;s baby, due in January 2024. Amanda is lucky to have found Michael after her journey on Bachelor in Paradise, and hopefully, there will be many happy moments for the couple.
