While Saltburn contains several highly-discussed sequences, the candle comes from the notorious bathtub scene. In this scene, Oliver catches a glimpse of Felix bathing whilst engaging in self-pleasure. The scene then cuts to after Felix’s bath wherein, as the water has drained away, Oliver sneaks into the bathtub and begins lapping up the liquidy remnants around the tub drain.




This scene gained such notoriety that multiple sellers began marketing Jacob Elordi bathwater candles online. Now, Saltburn fans can find Elordi-inspired candles on popular sites like Amazon and Etsy. Elordi’s co-star Keoghan has publicly referenced the candles, once joking that they were sold out because he had already bought ten of them.
