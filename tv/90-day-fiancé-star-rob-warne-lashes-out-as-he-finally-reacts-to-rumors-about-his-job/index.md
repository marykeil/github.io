## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne&#39;s current job is a mystery to many. He finally reveals whether he really works at a car repair shop in Texas.




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne slammed blog posts claiming that he works at a car repair shop in Austin. Rob, a 32-year-old Los Angeles resident, began dating social media influencer Sophie Sierra, 23, after she approached him on Instagram. Rob and Sophie decided to get engaged so she could come to America on a K-1 visa. However, Sophie, who had grown up rich, had a lot of expectations from Rob, whose apartment didn’t have a bathroom in it. Sophie also said that Rob did odd jobs “here and there,” as Rob spoke about being a model and actor on screen.




Rob was rumored to have found a job at Cap’s Service and Repair in Austin, Texas, in 2023, but he’s now claiming that he never worked there. Rob filmed a video from his car to show the repair shop from the outside and exclaimed, “This is so funny. This place right here, everyone online thought that I work at this place.” Rob revealed that he doesn’t work there and it’s not his job. He explained that he had just seen a “cool car” outside and had posted about it, making his followers think that it was his job. “It’s not!” Rob laughed. “People gotta chill on the speculations. It’s crazy,” he wrote.

Rob shared another Instagram Story, where he said that he feels a lot of people are really wanting him to “s*** on” himself. He said that between his car, his apartment, and his finances, everything that he did had a “purpose.” Rob explained that the car he was using on 90 Day Fiancé was the perfect car for Los Angeles. He said that he liked the car, and it was the “perfect car” for that kind of city. Rob admitted that the apartment was “s****y” but he doesn’t live there anymore. He added that his old apartment in Los Angeles served a purpose.


 

Rob has a pit bull, and he had to quickly find a place that could accommodate the pet. He revealed that he had a week to find an apartment when that one had become available. “It is what it is,” Rob added. According to Rob, his finances have only gotten better and will continue to get better. He added that he had watched his storyline on the show and was already working on himself and his attitude. He was receptive to criticism and being on 90 Day Fiancé had given him more “perspective to do better.” Rob wanted to be his true, authentic self on 90 Day Fiancé, which is why he didn’t walk into the jewelry store and ask for a $10,000 ring.




Rob likes staying true to himself. He’s not interested in faking it for anyone. Rob doesn’t think he is that kind of person. He asked his critics to respect his choices, and if they don&#39;t, he suggested they could go find someone else to look at and judge. Rob is not trying to reveal anything new about his life after 90 Day Fiancé apart from the fact that he’s moved into a new apartment. Sophie has also been seen filming content in the same house, which confirms that Rob and Sophie lived together after the show, despite Rob’s many red flags.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
