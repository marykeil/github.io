## Literature Review

TV shows centred on anti-heroes have grown in popularity in recent years, and with these new protags taking centre stage, its time to rank the best.




TV shows revolve around the lead character who often comes off as heroic, good and morally justified, but some shows blur the lines as they follow an anti-hero instead, which can result in incredibly satisfying arcs. Modern movies and shows have taken more time to explore the anti-hero and engage with their motivations and the obscure moral questions associated with them. Instead of having cut and dry, good and bad, anti-heroes can make stories feel more authentic by exploring the complex choices of their leads.
An anti-hero isn&#39;t inherently good or bad, they possess attributes of both and can make questionable choices, but when they are a lead on a TV series, there is almost always something to connect with in their character. Life is more complicated than simple black and white, and watching an antagonistic protagonist go through their journey can feel authentic and deliver emotionally engaging stories. Whether the anti-hero is a cold-blooded killer like Dexter Morgan, or incredibly focused on self-preservation like Shiv Roy, there are redeeming, and even endearing qualities to engage viewers.









 








 15  Jack Bauer 
24
        

24 is a unique series which sees Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), an anti-terrorist agent, taking down threats to the security of the United States as he employs any measures necessary. The series pushes the limits of what a hero is allowed to do, as Bauer willingly tortures and brutally destroys security threats in a way that is uncomfortable, but his motivations are clearly coming from his commitment to protecting his home. Bauer is an anti-hero, which may cause divided opinions, but that may well be the point of an anti-hero.





 14  Jackson &#34;Jax&#34; Teller 
Sons Of Anarchy


 







Jax (Charlie Hunnam) is set to inherit the leadership of the Sons of Anarchy motorcycle club, but he finds himself conflicted between the violent and illegal business the club operates and his young family&#39;s needs and safety. While Jax initially starts out as the Vice President of the club, getting his hands dirty along the way, he wants to create a better future for his child than the one that he inherited. Jax&#39;s inner conflict is pivotal to the story and while he participates in illegal activities, his struggles are made apparent in a dramatic and engaging way throughout.

Charlie Hunnam&#39;s character Jax Teller could return for a new Sons of Anarchy project despite his character&#39;s definite ending in the original series. 








 13  Elizabeth Jennings 
The Americans
        

The Americans is a compelling crime drama series following an unassuming typical American family, who are actually deep undercover agents working for the KGB. Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) and her family are completely believable and charming as they befriend neighbors and their community, but at night, they go about their secret business which takes them down seedier, more mysterious paths. The show and the performance of these double agents is compelling as it frames the story from a side that is less often displayed, which in turn poses questions about humanity, trust, and loyalty.





 12  Zuko 
The Last Airbender
        

Prince Zuko is the incoming leader of the Fire Nation, and following his family&#39;s domination of the other nations, he is expected to continue their legacy and maintain control over any insurgents. Zuko is just a teenage boy in The Last Airbender, but the weight of the world is placed on his shoulders with no love afforded him by his father. However, thanks to the loving, compassionate influence of his Uncle Iroh, he grows to make his own choices and eventually turns his back on his father&#39;s cruel plans, choosing instead to forge his own path.





 11  Nancy Botwin 
Weeds
        

Weeds is a complex and thought-provoking series that explores the journey of a young widow trying to provide for her family through desperate measures. Early in the series, sympathy for Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker) remains high as she attempts to care for her family by selling marijuana. As the show progresses though, her motives become more blurry and questionable as the work she does begins to negatively impact her family. The series continuously raises questions about motives, love, neglect, and morality, which makes this an incredible anti-hero story.





 10  Saul Goodman 
Better Call Saul


 







When Jimmy McGill was a young boy working at his father&#39;s store, he developed a talent for conning and scams. As he grew up, his talents matured, and he moved from creating minor scams to larger illegal work, with many of his clientele coming from a similar background. Practicing law as Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), there is something magnetic about the character. He may be crooked, but he is also always ready to get involved in the issues that concern friends, and he has the right connections to get the job done.

 9  Gregory House 
House
        

Doctor Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) is the head of the diagnostics team at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. He is a brilliant doctor capable of quickly and accurately diagnosing most common issues that people may experience, and he has moved on to focusing his attention on the harder to crack cases. While House indulges a pill addiction, lacks human warmth, and enjoys putting his team through rigorous training that often sees them fail, people can&#39;t help but marvel at his genius. He can be a pain, but he&#39;s a pain that is worth keeping around for his usefulness.





 8  Vic Mackey 
The Shield
        

Vic Mackey is a corrupt cop running a crooked LAPD unit, and in The Shield&#39;s very first episode, he proves just how far gone he is when he smashes a person of interests face into an iron stove, burning and scarring them permanently. While the show creates tension around the possibility of Mackey and his unit getting caught, the story unbelievably manages to ensure viewers are still rooting for him and his team despite their unjust actions. The show is a rollercoaster, but Mackey is an anti-hero to be taken seriously.





 7  Martin &#34;Marty&#34; Byrde 
Ozark
        

Jason Bateman stars, and frequently directs, on the incredibly tense crime drama, Ozark. Bateman plays Marty Byrde, who gets in deep with drug bosses to work off the debts of his partner. Throughout the series, Marty manages to convert a small little town into a massive drug ring which becomes a major hub of operations. The series sees Marty drag his entire family into business and shady dealings throughout, but Bateman is also easy to empathize with and creates a connection with viewers that garners sympathy, even when it isn&#39;t always deserved.





 6  Dexter Morgan 
Dexter


 







Dexter is one of the bloodstain analysts on the force, which is a fact that is likely aided by his in-depth personal experience with murdering people. While Dexter works for the police department, he also has a compulsion to kill people. He manages to keep control of his lust for blood by periodically stalking a criminal who escaped justice in the courts, and then methodically and expertly killing them, before covering his tracks and disposing of the body. Dexter is trying his best, but his addiction puts him at risk of being caught and imprisoned.

 5  Siobhan &#34;Shiv&#34; Roy 
Succession
        

The Roy family is full of terrible people, with each character striking a critical balance between loathsome and profoundly interesting. However, Shiv (Sarah Snook) is potentially the one that deserves the most recognition for her part as an anti-heroic figure. She desperately wants to be given the same respect as her male peers, and she knows how to tactfully play games and get her way. Shiv is also willing to do anything to get what she wants and will leave anything that could hold her back behind. Despite this, it&#39;s easy to recognize the pain and humanity that she possesses.





 4  Don Draper 
Mad Men
        

Jon Hamm delivers an outstanding performance in Mad Men as a high profile ad exec in 1960s New York. Playing the role of Don Draper, Jon Hamm perfectly captures the duality of a character who has no moral qualms about cheating on every partner he has and selfishly indulging his every whim. However, as the show progresses, Don&#39;s human side comes into focus as he stands up for those he cares about and actively strives to be loyal to trusted clients. Draper is complex, like any good anti-hero protagonist should be, and he just narrowly misses out on the top three.





 3  Omar Little 
The Wire
        

Many of the supposed &#34;criminals&#34; in The Wire deserve recognition for their status as anti-heroes, but Omar Little (Michael Kenneth Williams) is the best representation of this archetype in the series. Omar may be a gun-toting, drug-slinging criminal, but as The Wire illustrates, not all criminals have the luxury of choosing this way of life, and some are forced into it through difficult circumstances. Omar brings his grandmother to church, holds a strict moral code and never harms innocent people, but he is also capable of unleashing fury on those that threaten him and his community.





 2  Walter White 
Breaking Bad
        

Walter White (Bryan Cranston) starts life on Breaking Bad as a humble chemistry teacher with a terminal diagnosis, but over the course of the show, he transforms into the drug lord, Heisenberg. While trying to desperately secure his family&#39;s future and protect those he loves, he becomes obsessed with securing more and more wealth, and endangers the lives of many others, including his own family. The transformation of the character and his good intentions slowly being buried beneath his greed and lust for power make him one of the most interesting anti-heroes of all time.
            
 
 10 Breaking Bad Scenes That Hit Different After Better Call Saul 
After watching Jimmy McGill&#39;s transformation in Saul Goodman in Better Call Saul so many scenes from Breaking Bad just end up hitting differently.








 1  Tony Soprano 
The Sopranos


 







James Gandolfini stars in The Sopranos as the boss of the New Jersey mafia. The Sopranos was one of the first shows that ever followed the &#34;villain&#34; as the protagonist. Tony Soprano frequently lays down a beating on those who cross his crew, and manages to go back home and balance his life of crime and violence with an orderly home. It&#39;s always clear that he is a villain and a criminal, but he also shows his human side frequently, with the entire series being told through Tony having a conversation with his therapist.
