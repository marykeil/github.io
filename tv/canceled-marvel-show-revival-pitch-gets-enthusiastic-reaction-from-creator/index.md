## Literature Review
Calls for a canceled Marvel show to be revived have been addressed by a creator who would likely be heavily involved in the production.




Calls for a Heroes for Hire show in the MCU to be revived have been addressed by Cheo Hodari Coker, the showrunner and writer of Netflix&#39;s Luke Cage. Recently, the MCU timeline has included Netflix&#39;s Defenders saga when listed on Disney&#43;, reigniting the debate over whether the Netflix-produced shows are canon to Marvel Studios&#39; franchise. This came after Echo moved Daredevil&#39;s canon status ever closer by supporting the backstory of Wilson Fisk and Daredevil in the MCU show.




Naturally, calls for other Netflix shows to be revived have been prevalent given these developments, including the canceled Heroes for Hire which was heavily rumored to be in production by Netflix. The desire to see such a show revived has received an enthusiastic update from Luke Cage&#39;s showrunner, Cheo Hodari Coker via X/Twitter. When asked about the potentiality of a Heroes for Hire show, Coker replied: &#34;I could write it in my sleep.&#34; This update is incredibly exciting for fans of Luke Cage and Iron Fist as it proves Coker&#39;s passion for uniting the two as the Heroes for Hire would make him the perfect choice to revive the show in the MCU.

 How Iron Fist Can Be Improved For His MCU Reintroduction 
          

Unfortunately, arguably the biggest factor working against an MCU Heroes for Hire show is the negative reaction received by Finn Jones&#39; Danny Rand/Iron Fist on Netflix. That said, many would agree that the issues that plagued Iron Fist were not due to Finn Jones himself, but instead the writing of the show by Scott Buck who was eventually replaced as showrunner for season 2. Therefore, it remains the case that Iron Fist as a character could be improved for an MCU reintroduction via Heroes for Hire.

Interestingly, the main way to improve Netflix&#39;s depiction of Iron Fist comes from Coker himself. When asked how to remove Danny Rand&#39;s problems on X/Twitter, Coker stated: &#34;Simple fix. You can&#39;t focus your Chi unless you&#39;re centered and balanced. Lose the angst and Danny makes a lot more sense.&#34; This was proven to be a simple enough rectification when Rand appeared in Luke Cage season 2, episode 10. Coker put his fix to the test for this episode as Danny appeared as a much more easygoing character, thus improving the depiction on Netflix and leading to calls for Heroes for Hire which evidently remain prevalent in the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
