## Literature Review
The Witcher is known for its attention to detail, from its costuming to its character design, and many cosplays capture that element of the show.




The Witcher is a lush fantasy series that pays plenty of attention to detail, and that can be seen most clearly in the show&#39;s costuming and character design — elements many impressive cosplays have captured over the years. An adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski&#39;s Witcher books, the Netflix show follows Geralt of Rivia on his journey to find, train, and protect Princess Cirilla of Cintra. This brings both characters closer to their destiny, a theme that&#39;s prominent throughout The Witcher&#39;s story.
The characters are the best part of The Witcher, and while Netflix makes changes to the iterations that appear in the books and games, it still does a good job depicting them on-screen. Some cosplays rival The Witcher characters&#39; Netflix looks, demonstrating the cosplayers&#39; dedication to bringing the likes of Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer to life. The best cosplays from the Continent will no doubt get fans excited for The Witcher season 4, even with Geralt&#39;s recasting.









 








 20  A Brooding Geralt 
This Cosplay Captures The Look Almost As Well As Henry Cavill


Geralt is a broody character in The Witcher books and games, and Henry Cavill showcases that aspect of his personality well. So does cosplayer @woodsmokeandwords, whose take on Geralt is made complete by their serious expression and bloody face. These are details that define Geralt&#39;s on-screen appearance, and the hair and costume are well-crafted enough to immediately identify the character. This look could give Cavill&#39;s Geralt a run for his money. Hopefully, Liam Hemsworth gets this Geralt mannerism right as well.





 19  A Confident Yennefer 
The Aretuza Ball Dress Is Iconic


The results of Yennefer&#39;s transformation in The Witcher season 1 are revealed at the Aretuza ball, and the black dress and mask she wears to make her entrance are absolutely iconic. Yennefer even meets Geralt in this get-up, so it&#39;s an important look for her character. Cosplayer @whoisjillea replicates the outfit well, capturing Yennefer&#39;s intimidating new confidence. This look rivals its on-screen counterpart, enough so that it would make Yennefer proud.





 18  The Girl In The Woods 
An Early Ciri Look


The Witcher season 1 finds Princess Ciri on the run, a journey that takes her through the woods in a hooded cloak that barely hides who she really is. @shersten.the.golden&#39;s cosplay masterfully captures the look of Freya Allen&#39;s earliest scenes, with a gorgeous blue cloak and blonde curls that identify the look as uniquely Ciri&#39;s. This cosplay rivals Netflix&#39;s portrayal of the character with its attention to detail, which is clearest in the subtle cut on the cosplayer&#39;s cheek.





 17  Toss A Coin To This Cosplay 
This Jaskier Cosplay Sings


Jaskier has become a fan-favorite character thanks to The Witcher, and @cassbeecosplay&#39;s take on the bard is truly worth tossing a coin over. The red jacket allows this cosplay to capture Joey Batey&#39;s on-screen persona, and the addition of elements like the black hat give this its own flare. Additionally, the cosplayer&#39;s pose and lute elicit memories of Jaskier singing throughout the series. One look at this will get &#34;Toss a Coin to Your Witcher&#34; stuck in anyone&#39;s head.





 16  Yennefer &amp; Ciri Bonding 
A Witcher Cosplay That Depicts Their Found-Family Bond


Yennefer and Ciri&#39;s relationship is one of the most important bonds in The Witcher, and this cosplay from @lenedoes and @stellarcosplay encapsulates their love for one another. Featuring Yennefer&#39;s gorgeous embroidered coat and Ciri&#39;s signature boots and braid, this take on the characters does an impressive job of capturing both their appearances and relationship. The pair&#39;s pose conveys their comfort with one another, with Yennefer playing with Ciri&#39;s hair as they sit together.





 15  Ciri&#39;s Flight Through The Woods 
A Performance That Recreates The Witcher


Ciri and Geralt spend much of The Witcher season 2 on the go, and @princesskeilee&#39;s Ciri cosplay captures that element of the series nicely. The cosplayer&#39;s outfit is accurate to Ciri&#39;s look in season 2, utilizing the tunics, leather boots, and furs she wears so often. @princesskeilee&#39;s performance — which sees Ciri running through the woods and screaming — also rivals the character&#39;s on-screen portrayal with its accuracy.





 14  Yennefer&#39;s Embroidered Coat 


Yennefer&#39;s embroidered coats are a popular cosplay item, and @lauracalandtphoto recreates this look with an outfit that&#39;s just as stunning as what appears in The Witcher itself. The long black coat gives this Yennefer cosplay an elegant look, which is made even better by the intricate designs. The choker and hair complete the cosplay, giving Anya Chalotra&#39;s character a run for her money.





 13  It&#39;s All In The Eyes 
A Geralt Cosplay Attentive To Details


Geralt&#39;s black leather armor is just as popular among cosplayers as Yennefer&#39;s embroidered coats, and Jahara Jayde wears it well — perhaps as well as Cavill himself. The sword position and relaxed posture capture Geralt&#39;s stoic personality while still conveying his combat skills. And the yellow Witcher eyes complete the cosplayer&#39;s costume, highlighting the attention to detail.





 12  Yennefer&#39;s Purple Eyes 
This Cosplay Gets A Yennefer Detail


Jahara Jayde&#39;s detailed The Witcher cosplays don&#39;t stop at Geralt; the cosplayer brings Yennefer to life with the same attention. This cosplay captures Yennefer&#39;s canonically purple eyes more impressively than The Witcher show. Additionally, the dress and hair both replicate Yennefer&#39;s look well, clearly articulating the character&#39;s features.





 11  This Tissaia Cosplay Has What It Takes 


Tissaia is a powerful sorceress in The Witcher, but Yennefer&#39;s mentor isn&#39;t often the focus of cosplays. That makes @neal.rylatt&#39;s Tissaia cosplay that much more exciting, and it recreates the character&#39;s appearance with impressive accuracy. From the intricately made green dress to the tied-back hairstyle, this look screams Tissaia, especially compared to the Netflix version of the character.





 10  The Triss Look The Show Doesn&#39;t Capture 
This Cosplay Does The Witcher Character Justice


The Triss Merigold introduced in Netflix&#39;s The Witcher is totally different from the one seen in the games, and the series completely tones down her style and character design. Fortunately, cosplayers are committed to doing the original look justice, and @natsumi_cosplay offers a stunning take on the character. The gold and green dress is the highlight of the outfit, with its detailed design standing out. However, the red hair and fiery book do a solid job of portraying what Triss should look like on-screen.





 9  A Father/Son Duo Take On Geralt &amp; Vesemir 


Vesemir is a massively important part of Geralt&#39;s journey, and this father/son cosplay from @theprincedeguzman speaks to the deep relationship between the two Witchers. It gets their looks right, highlighting the fact that both characters are warriors through their armor and swords. However, this cosplay also encapsulates the emotional bond Vesemir and Geralt share, which resembles that of a father and child.





 8  Vesemir In His Prime 
This Cosplay Pulls From Nightmare Of The Wolf


Netflix&#39;s The Witcher introduces Vesemir as an older Witcher. However, @stylouz_cosplay&#39;s take on the character brings fans back to Vesemir&#39;s prime. It draws inspiration from Netflix&#39;s animated spinoff The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf to capture his look. The end result is so impressive that it may prompt demands for a live-action Vesemir prequel — or at least flashbacks to the character&#39;s youth in the main show.





 7  A Colorful Bard Cosplay 
Capturing Jaskier&#39;s Personality


Jaskier has a colorful personality in The Witcher show, and @vitaliy_joiner&#39;s cosplay of the character captures that with a bright blue and purple tunic. The cosplay doesn&#39;t forget Jaskier&#39;s lute, and it places him in the woods, where he travels with Geralt in the show&#39;s first season. This look also makes sure to get the small details right, from Jaskier&#39;s hair to his blue eyes.





 6  A Cosplay Ready For Combat 
Capturing Geralt&#39;s Fighting Spirit


Geralt is an excellent fighter, and Cavill&#39;s best swordfights throughout The Witcher prove it. @cosplay.kaiser highlights Geralt&#39;s fighting spirit with their take on the character, which sees the Witcher taking a fighting stance. The cosplay includes major elements of Geralt&#39;s character, like his leather armor, bright blonde hair, and gorgeous sword. It also captures the smaller details, like the yellow Witcher eyes.





 5  Ciri&#39;s Game Look Shows What She&#39;ll Become 
The Netflix Show Should Keep It


@joanwolfie&#39;s Ciri cosplay takes on the Witcher character&#39;s game look from The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, something that has yet to show up in the Netflix show. This cosplay rivals the series because it gives Ciri a look that showcases what a strong fighter she becomes. The leather and sword are nice touches that highlight Geralt&#39;s influence on Ciri. Hopefully, The Witcher will get Ciri to this point in the near future — and give her the look to go with it.





 4  Geralt&#39;s Black Armor Stikes Again 
This Cosplay Is Breathtakingly Accurate


Geralt&#39;s black armor is a popular choice for cosplayers, and @rav.props&#39; take on this costume is breathtakingly accurate. The cosplayer captures everything from Geralt&#39;s hair to his flaming sword, proving that small details can make or break a costume. The black leather armor also bears a striking resemblance to the outfit from the Netflix show, seriously rivaling The Witcher&#39;s take on its iconic lead.





 3  Yennefer At Sodden Hill 
Stitching &amp; Blood Make This A Winner


Yennefer takes an impressive stand at the Battle of Sodden Hill, and @jedimanda recreates her look from The Witcher season 1. The stitching on Yennefer&#39;s dress is so intricate that it rivals Chalotra&#39;s actual costume. The bloodied face is also a nice touch, reminding fans of the toll Yennefer&#39;s immense display of power took on her body.





 2  A Romantic Yennefer &amp; Geralt 
A Cosplay That Gets Their Game Looks &amp; Dynamic Right


Geralt and Yennefer are attracted to one another in The Witcher games and show, and @christieannefit and @santanaandersono2 recreate their dynamic well in their games-accurate cosplay. The fact that their looks utilize the game designs makes this cosplay shine, rivaling Netflix&#39;s take on these characters. It also leaves fans wanting more of Geralt and Yennefer&#39;s relationship — something season 4 will, hopefully, deliver on.





 1  A Game-Accurate Geralt 
The Witcher Should Take Notes For Liam Hemsworth


Geralt bears a slightly different appearance in The Witcher games, one the Netflix show could attempt to capture with Liam Hemsworth taking over the role. @maul_cosplay sets the bar high for a games-accurate Geralt look, bringing the character&#39;s beard and scarred face to life with amazing accuracy. There&#39;s no word on how Netflix plans to deal with the transition from Cavill to Hemsworth, but it could use a time jump and present the games&#39; older-looking Geralt in The Witcher season 4.
