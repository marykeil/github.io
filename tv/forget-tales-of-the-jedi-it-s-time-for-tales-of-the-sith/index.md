# Forget Tales Of The Jedi, It s Time For Tales Of The Sith


## SUMMARY 



  Tales of the Sith could expand the Star Wars franchise by exploring compelling Sith backstories, just as Tales of the Jedi did for Count Dooku.   The franchise has primarily focused on Jedi perspectives, but Tales of the Sith could reveal the Sith&#39;s role in galactic history and delve into their exploits before the Skywalker Saga.   This potential animated series could showcase major Sith figures like Palpatine, Darth Maul, and even resurrect beloved characters from the Knights of the Old Republic video games.

## Literature Review
Almost all the Star Wars movies and tv shows are about the Jedi, so why hasn’t the franchise moved on to tell a story centered on the Sith?




With Tales of the Jedi, Star Wars showed the road less traveled by exploring unique stories outside the main Skywalker Saga, but a show like Tales of the Sith could broaden the franchise even further. Thanks to the massive success of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, series such as The Bad Batch and Tales of the Jedi continue to thrive. But while Tales of the Jedi season 2 and The Bad Batch season 3 are both expected to release on Disney&#43; this year, some can’t help but wonder where Lucasfilm will take its animation department next.




Despite only being six episodes long, Tales of the Jedi managed to fill in the gaps of several lacking parts in the franchise. And while the three episodes centered on Ahsoka were stunningly animated, many consider Count Dooku’s fall to the dark side to be the highlight of the series. Dooku’s episodes help the audience empathize with his plight, as he continually feels cast aside by the Jedi Order he faithfully serves. His ambition ultimately gets the better of him. And in a way, his episodes ultimately spell out the tale of him joining the Sith.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    


 Star Wars Has Always Been Told From The Jedi Point Of View 
         




As the “good guys” of the Star Wars universe, the franchise has almost exclusively focused on stories told from the Jedi point of view. The original trilogy focuses on Luke, the prequel trilogy focuses on Anakin, and the sequel trilogy focuses on Rey. Even most of Disney’s tv series like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka concern themselves with Jedi. However, Tales of the Jedi proved that the franchise can take a well-known Sith—like Dooku—and reinvigorate them by giving them a compelling backstory. Nevertheless, the series can only focus on Jedi characters; it is shackled to its own title.



 Tales Of The Sith Could Reveal The Sith&#39;s Role In Galactic History 
          

It’s time for Star Wars to branch away from stories about the Jedi and give narrative to other groups in the galaxy. While Star Wars’ upcoming The Acolyte series promises to bring a Sith-led story to live-action, a series like Tales of the Sith could delve even deeper into the dark side through animation. Just as Tales of the Jedi filled in some of the gaps in the overarching story by traveling back before the movies, Tales of the Sith could also explore the Sith Empire’s exploits long before their demise in the Skywalker Saga.




For example, Tales of the Sith could show Palpatine’s training under Darth Plagueis, as well as how Palpatine gained his power in the Senate. Alternatively, it could show Darth Maul’s early years on Dathomir before being recruited by Palpatine. And because Tales of the Sith wouldn’t be bound to the Skywalker Saga, it could even go back and resurrect many of the franchise’s most famous Sith from the Knights of the Old Republic video games, like Darth Revan, Darth Bane, Darth Vitiate, or Darth Malgus. In any case, seeing Star Wars from the perspective of a Sith could open the door to a previously unexplored side of the franchise.
