Summary

  Gyeongseong Creature season 1 explores portions of the true story of Unit 731 during World War II and its impact on Korea.   The Netflix K-drama references important historical moments and showcases Korean creators&#39; perspectives on the generational trauma that comes from Japan&#39;s colonial rule over the country.   Gyeongseong Creature combines aspects of the true story of Unit 731 with fictional elements, including zombie-like creatures.  




Despite the fantastical nature of Gyeongseong Creature, which includes zombies and monsters, the series discusses real-life events – including the true story of Unit 731. Gyeongseong Creature makes the most of its 1945 setting, offering a series that addresses generational trauma and the impact of the Japanese rule over Korea. From the independence movement to the atrocities committed against locals, Gyeongseong Creature season 1 shows the final months of World War II from the perspective of the people of Gyeongseong.

Gyeongseong Creature episode 10’s ending credits scene took place in 2024. However, the majority of the season was set in 1945, just a few weeks before the end of the war. Even though the Netflix Korean show does not directly reference many real-life figures, it recreates important historical moments and offers the perspective of Korean artists on one of the saddest, most horrifying events of the 20th century.




                  Gyeongseong Creature Season 2&#39;s Announcement Confirms It Will Be A Completely Different Show   Gyeongseong Creature season 2 has been officially announced by Netflix, but the historical K-drama will be very different once it returns.    


 The True Story Of Gyeongseong Creature’s Unit 731 
          

Japan had an extensive program of biological warfare during World War II, and the most infamous example is that of Unit 731. Established in 1936 on a building complex near Harbin in Manchuria, Unit 731, or Ishii Unit, was secretly used for human experimentation and the development of biological weapons. It could hold 600 prisoners and welcome 3000 personnel at a time (Camb Q Healthc Ethics. 2014 Apr.) While the number of people who were killed during the experiments cannot be accurately stated due to the lack of documents, all estimates account for thousands of people who were experimented on and killed inside Unit 731 from 1936 to 1945 (The New York Times).






Sheldon H. Harris&#39; Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932-45 and the American Cover-Up estimates the number of Chinese victims from the Japanese Army&#39;s biological warfare is in the hundreds of thousands range.




The operation was led by Surgeon General Shiro Ishii, who had been tasked in 1932 with leading the Army Epidemic Prevention Research Laboratory. Human experimentation conducted inside Unit 731 included infecting prisoners with various pathogenies, such as cholera, plague, and anthrax. Prisoners would be exposed to extreme conditions and other inhumanities, including the performing of dissection on alive human beings without the use of any form of anesthesia (Atlantis Press). Unit 731’s place in Japan’s World War II strategy went beyond in-door experiments and also included field tests, especially in China. Multiple disease outbreaks in Chinese cities were started through plague bombs.

Gyeongseong Creature episode 1 begins with Japanese soldiers burning documents and executing the remaining prisoners, a recreation of the destruction of the Unit 731 buildings with the use of dynamite in August 1945. The lack of documents, as well as the fact many of the names behind Unit 731 walked out free at the end of the war and even returned to public duties, makes it difficult to estimate how many people were killed in total. Most victims were Chinese, Mongolians, and Koreans, and the atrocities committed against them during that time forever impacted their respective countries. This is reflected in pieces of art and fiction, including the South Korean production Gyeongseong Creature.






 Gyeongseong Creature Combines Unit 731’s True Story With Fictional Elements 
         

Gyeongseong Creature combines the true story of Unit 731 and the atrocities it committed with fantasy elements like monsters and zombies. These fantasy elements, especially the creation of a monster through the use of a mysterious parasite, metaphorically discuss how the real monsters in any true story of horrors are humans and not fictional creatures. The “creature” referenced in Gyeongseong Creature’s title was actually a victim – a prisoner from Unit 731 that had been experimented on and had now become a giant monster. Chae-ok and her father, two of the show’s main characters, came from Manchuria to Gyeongseong and knew about Unit 731.

The trauma with which Chae-ok and her father discuss what is happening in Gyeongseong adds another layer of depth to the show. However, apart from the opening sequence, Gyeongseong Creature does not feature Unit 731’s main buildings in Manchuria. Instead, most of the show takes place in the fictional district of Bonjeong in Gyeongseong and the also fictional Ongseong Hospital. Despite the fictional additions, the show recreates some of the experiments conducted by the real Unit 731 in very disturbing scenes – such as when Sachimoto has to watch the dissection of someone who was still alive and was given no anesthesia.




                  Lady Maeda’s Plan &amp; Fate In Gyeongseong Creature Explained   Gyeongseong Creature’s Lady Maeda, played by Claudia Kim, was revealed to be way more powerful and dangerous than anyone could have imagined.    

Everything about the titular creature in Gyeongseong Creature symbolizes the true story of Unit 731 and all the horrors committed against Koreans, Chinese, Mongolians, and others – starting from its identity. Chae-ok’s mother, Seong-min, was from Manchuria and had been a prisoner of the Japanese Army for 10 years by the time she was infected with the “Najin.” Regardless of the fantasy aspects of a zombie-like virus, the fact the creature she turns into attacks others by liberating anthrax on the air is an allegory to the pathogens used on Unit 731’s prisoners.


 




Gyeongseong Creature also incorporates the Korean independence movement through the character of Jun-taek. At first, Tae-sang was not interested in joining his friend in the fight to liberate Korea from Japanese colonial rule, but after witnessing the horrors that were happening inside the Ongseong Hospital, he changed his mind. Gyeongseong Creature season 1 ends with the main characters destroying the Ongseong Hospital from within, followed by the end of the Japanese occupation in the aftermath of the war. Gyeongseong Creature season 2 will take place in 2024 Seoul, which will allow the show to address the consequences – or lack of – those involved with Unit 731 faced.
