Some cast members are aware that their relationships are transactional, but others are more naive.   Gullible cast members can end up heartbroken and financially depleted, after believing every word they hear.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé stars aren&rsquo;t always on the level. Some are users who take everything they can from their partners. Other give way too much.</p>

<p>When 90 Day Fiancé stars take a chance on love, anything can happen - some are taken for rides while others do the using. Relationships involving predators and their prey may implode or continue. However, over time, it&rsquo;s obvious to everyone (including the &ldquo;halves&rdquo; of those partnerships) that the power imbalances are toxic. When they&rsquo;re faced with the cold, hard realities of their relationships, the sweet dreams of naive and romantic 90 Day Fiancé cast members die. Whether they stay or go, they must accept the truth.</p>

<li>Sweet Dreams, Eurythmics</li>
</ul>
<p>Some 90 Day Fiancé cast members travel the world and find love along the way. Others connect with international partners online. No matter how they meet love interests, they take risks. Certain cast members know that their relationships are transactional. Some want to buy their partners - and there are cast members who are more than willing to be bought. However, it&rsquo;s not always so black and white. Sometimes, gullible cast members believe every single word that they hear. They end up heartbroken, with depleted bank accounts.</p>

<p>Liz Woods Broke Big Ed Brown&rsquo;s Heart (User)
What Was Liz Woods After, Anyway?</p>
<p>Liz Woods, a young and attractive woman with a restaurant industry job, seemingly fell in love with older man Big Ed Brown. He carries a few extra pounds and has Klippel-Feil syndrome - that disorder makes his neck look very short. At a glance, the couple wasn&rsquo;t a perfect match, and in fact, they were doomed. However, before it all fell apart, Liz kept toying with Big Ed. Instead of dumping him the first time he misbehaved, she kept dragging the relationship out.</p>
<p>Even when Big Ed was verbally abusive during a phone call, Liz let him remain in her life. What was the young woman after? Probably fame.</p>
<p>How many times does a couple have to break up before the truth about a relationship is understood? Apparently, eleven times. That&rsquo;s how long it took for this troubled romance to finally die. When it did end, Liz was shady. Instead of being respectful and telling the world that she and Big Ed were done, she coyly posted a photo of a mystery man tying her shoelace. While the man&rsquo;s face was concealed, it obviously wasn&rsquo;t Big Ed.</p>
<p>Since Liz ended things with zero finesse, it&rsquo;s more than likely that she never really loved Big Ed at all. Once again, the perennial romantic Big Ed was duped by a younger woman. He&rsquo;s such a terrible partner that, by now, he should realize that people might use him. However, that kind of self-awareness eludes him. He needs to date someone his own age. Not that dating someone younger is wrong - it&rsquo;s just not working for him. Also, Liz needs to leave him alone because this dynamic is unhealthy.</p>
<pre><code>          90 Day Fiance  Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods are franchise regulars. They are now exes, but tried to work things out on the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, 90 Day: The Single Life.

<p>Daniele Gates Was The Perfect &ldquo;Mark&rdquo; (Got Used)
Yohan Geronimo Saw Dollar Signs</p>
<p>When she decided to throw away her job and part of her pension for a young and handsome &ldquo;sanky panky,&rdquo; Daniele Gates wasn&rsquo;t thinking straight. Maybe her libido was leading her astray. Also, she had island dreams, often fantasizing about fleeing New York City forever. She wanted a cheaper and slower lifestyle in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>While the age gap between Daniele and Yohan wasn&rsquo;t major (around 10 years), their goals were in opposition. He wanted the 90DF brass ring - a Green Card. He was all about accessing the American Dream. However, she wanted to move to his country rather than bringing him to the USA.</p>
<p>When she decided to move to DR, it didn&rsquo;t bode well for them. She clearly didn&rsquo;t understand what was really happening in her relationship. He wanted to be bought, and she wasn&rsquo;t offering enough for his body and time. She was supposed to provide an American home and cold, hard cash. If she did, he&rsquo;d fake love. This was the true dynamic here. Now, Yohan can roam, looking for a partner who understands what he wants. Daniele must pick up the pieces, but losing someone who doesn&rsquo;t care isn&rsquo;t really a loss. It just feels that way for a while.</p>
<p>She may have known the score but decided to do what she wanted anyway. These relationships can be more complicated than they seem. However, in any case, she let the man with the dollar sign down. He passive-aggressively paid her back by cheating on her for two full years. Now, she&rsquo;s back in the city she wanted to leave forever, bloody but unbowed. She&rsquo;s learned powerful lessons about lust, love and reality.</p>
<p>Anfisa Arkhipchenko Had Money On Her Mind (User)
Anfisa Arkhipchenko Also Had An Explosive Temper</p>
<p>Anfisa&rsquo;s changed. She&rsquo;s evolved as a person, casting aside her gold digger label. Now, she relies on herself instead of men. Anfisa&rsquo;s earned a degree and she&rsquo;s a successful fitness model. She&rsquo;s even participated in fitness competitions. However, back in the day, the fiery 90 Day Fiancé cast member was like a human cash register. As seen in the clip above, via TLC at YouTube, Anfisa always had money on her mind.</p>
<p>Some franchise gold diggers try to hide what they are. They pretend that they aren&rsquo;t trying to exploit their partners. Anfisa stands out because she was so openly looking for a sugar daddy. Bold and selfish, she saw no need to put on an act. However, Jorge was no angel. He was into Anfisa for her looks, and his drug-related offenses landed him in prison. When he ended up behind bars, unable to provide for his glamorous partner, their relationship bit the dust.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good that it did, as Jorge decided to change his life. He lost 128 pounds, and his shocking jailbird transformation is one of the most dramatic weight-loss makeovers in 90DF history. After he gained his freedom, he found a nice woman, Rhoda Blua, and settled down. They&rsquo;re parents now.</p>
<p>Anfisa and Jorge were a bad match. Neither was really in it for love, but Anfisa was more mercenary than her partner. She also had a terrible temper which she made absolutely no effort to control. She&rsquo;d fly into a rage over almost anything, including a red makeup bag. Together, these two were sketchy and shady. Separately, both seem like good people. So, breakups can be the catalyst for personal growth. Being apart can be a blessing.</p>
<p>Chantel Everett Trusted Pedro Too Much (Got Used)
Pedro Jimeno Used His Looks &amp; Charm To Deceive Chantel Everett</p>
<p>Chantel Everett&rsquo;s heartbreak is real. She&rsquo;s trying to move on, but she&rsquo;ll always be psychologically scarred by what Pedro did to her. She fell head over heels in love with the Dominican Republic native, who seemed like a dream man. He was too good to be true. Since Chantel&rsquo;s such a glamorous woman, their romance seemed real. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be interested in the American woman, whose curves he compared to the shape of a guitar? Unfortunately, Pedro may have always planned to use and then dump Chantel. She&rsquo;s faced some hard truths since their relationship ended.</p>
<p>Chantel&rsquo;s story is one of the most wrenching in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise because she believed in her man the most. To love someone completely, trust is necessary. To take the leap of faith that&rsquo;s required is difficult. A person has to be vulnerable. They must put themselves in an emotional place where they can be badly hurt. Some people can&rsquo;t go that far for love.</p>
<p>Chantel gave a hundred percent, and hopefully, she was truly happy sometimes, as her marriage ended in such a painful way. At least she knows that she loved Pedro with all of her heart. Because she did, there&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of. Chantel did what a person in love should do.</p>
<p>Did Pedro do the same? No, definitely not. Like his coldblooded sister Nicole Jimeno and mother Lydia Morel, he was more consumed with the desire to move up in the world than anything else. However, for years, he skillfully played the role of a devoted partner. When Pedro revealed his true self during the breakup, Chantel unraveled emotionally. She showcased the kind of pain that&rsquo;s so real and raw that other people can feel it too.</p>
<p>Chantel deserves a good partner. She isn&rsquo;t perfect, but Chantel isn&rsquo;t a cheater or a liar or a bad person. Hopefully, she&rsquo;ll make some effort to date against her type. Another man who&rsquo;s smooth, slick and charming is probably what she wants, but it&rsquo;s the last thing she needs.</p>
<pre><code>          The Family Chantel  After their 90 Day Fiancé stint, Pedro and Chantel Jimeno scored a new gig. They were offered their own show, The Family Chantel. This spin-off showed their evolution as a couple in the public eye. It also shone a light on their painful and messy divorce.

<p>Colt Johnson Played Jess Caroline (User)
Jess Caroline Threw A Shoe At Cheater Colt Johnson</p>
<p>Some 90DF users don&rsquo;t do it for money. They have murkier motivations. There was really no good reason for Colt Johnson to get involved with the Brazilian redhead Jess Caroline if he wasn&rsquo;t in love with her. It would have been so easy to stay away. However, he plunged into a relationship that he didn&rsquo;t really care about, with a woman who wasn&rsquo;t really his type. She&rsquo;s a ginger, and he likes brunettes like the notorious villain Larissa Lima and his current wife, Vanessa Guerra.</p>
<p>So, what did &ldquo;Coltee&rdquo; do? Well, he cheated on the redhead with a brunette. Before his infidelity was revealed, Colt pretended to be a loving boyfriend. That&rsquo;s why Jess Caroline went berserk when she found out the truth. She hurled one of her shoes at a major-league 90DF heel. Colt&rsquo;s known for being unfaithful. The woman he cheated on Jess with was Vanessa. She&rsquo;s the one he really loved.</p>
<p>Luckily, Colt&rsquo;s now with the right woman. He shows just how low someone will sink when they aren&rsquo;t with their ideal match. Instead of getting real and cutting the cord, Colt played Jess. Now, he can live an honest life. Hopefully, he won&rsquo;t go back to his old ways.</p>
<p>Clearly, the &ldquo;sweet dreams&rdquo; of 90 Day Fiancé cast members can be destroyed by uncaring and predatory partners. The worst users seem to delight in draining the life-force out of their victims. It&rsquo;s almost like they&rsquo;re sucking their blood. Emotional vampires can do a lot of damage, but it&rsquo;s possible to survive the horrors that they inflict. Sometimes, people come out stronger. They walk through the fire and make it to the other side. Their feelings burn through them and burn away.</p>
<p>In other scenarios, such as with Chantel, the pain lasts for a long time. The more love a person feels, the longer it takes. There are genuine love stories in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. However, they are few and far between. Being followed by a camera crew adds another layer of complication to their relationships. Afterward, they&rsquo;re still under scrutiny.</p>
<p>Some 90 Day Fiancé franchise cast members seem masochistic. They may, perhaps unconsciously, seek out sadistic partners who will hurt them. This dynamic might bleed into their sex lives. It&rsquo;s possible that they&rsquo;re trying to resolve childhood trauma through their relationships. For example, a 90DF star may not have gotten the love they needed as a child. Perhaps a parent was cold, always withholding affection. Perhaps love was conditional - rules needed to be followed to get any love at all. Maybe living out the same dynamic with partners allows some people to move past that deep-seated trauma.</p>
<p>Likewise, sadistic partners may work through problems by controlling their partners. However, they&rsquo;re more likely to create new issues. Exerting that kind of control over another human being rarely ends well. At some point, the abused person, however masochistic they are, can&rsquo;t take it anymore. They begin to rebel. They may change their mind, turning against their mate emotionally. Relationships are fraught with peril, and when a user is in the mix, looking for control, the odds of things working out are very low.</p>
<p>There are so many different types of people in the world, and as the Eurythmics song goes, &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s looking for something.&rdquo; Some want to get used, while others want to use. Sometimes, the using is so severe that it&rsquo;s bona fide abuse. It&rsquo;s a fine line between love and hate - however, in many of these 90 Day Fiancé relationships, only one person loves.</p>
<pre><code>          90 Day Fiance  The 90 Day Fiancé franchise showcases some villains who are all about self-interest. Some of the most famous 90DF &quot;baddies&quot; include Larissa Lima, Geoffrey Paschel, Paul Staehle and Karine Martins.
