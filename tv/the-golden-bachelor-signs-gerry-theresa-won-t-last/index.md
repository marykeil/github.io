## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor wedding is coming up on January 4, 2024, but there are already signs that Gerry and Theresa can&#39;t make the marriage work.




The inaugural season of The Golden Bachelor ended with Gerry Turner getting down on one knee and proposing to Theresa Nist, but the pair may not last. Gerry, the widower, and retired restaurateur, hit it off with multiple women during the season, eliminating all but Theresa and Leslie Fhima. Though Gerry told both of the final women that he loved them, he ultimately gave his final rose to Theresa and sent Leslie home heartbroken and in tears.




Gerry and Theresa wasted no time planning their big wedding. Immediately after the finale, host Jesse Palmer revealed that ABC was sending the couple on an all-expenses paid trip to Italy. Then Gerry and Theresa announced they&#39;d be getting married in just a few short weeks. The dream wedding will air on national television on January 4, 2024, in a highly anticipated airing. However, signs on and off camera point to the notion Gerry and Theresa may not be right for each other.

 Gerry Lied About Singleness 
          

Gerry misled contestants and audiences into believing that he&#39;d been single since the 2017 death of his wife. However, shortly after proposing to Theresa, it was revealed that the 72-year-old Gerry had dated several women during that time. In fact, he had a long-term relationship with a woman who even lived with him for a short time. The father of two also claimed his professional status as “retired restaurateur”, but records show that his most recent jobs were in maintenance work. Considering the multiple examples of dishonesty, it&#39;s only logical to wonder what else Gerry is lying about and if the lies will come between him and his soon-to-be-wife.






 Gerry &amp; Theresa are Astrologically Incompatible 
          

The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry was born on August 7, 1951, making his astrological sign a Leo. Leo men are said to be hard-working, intelligent, creative, self-confident, and attention-hungry. The Lion is also a natural leader; others often look to them for advice and solutions. If things progress to marriage, Leo men make loyal, supportive husbands and loving fathers, as is evident in what viewers know about Gerry&#39;s relationship with his children and his late wife. 70-year-old Theresa was born on August 4, 1953, is also a Leo. Leo women are said to be a mixture of sweetness and spice. Female Leos are creative, passionate, generous, cheerful, and love to laugh.

Two Leos make for a highly intense love match with the potential for enormous passion. Leo is a strong, fiery sign who enjoys everything in life to the fullest, including love. Leos are proud with strong egos and want to be the center of the world, which is likely why they both opted to televise their wedding. They want everyone&#39;s full attention, and that includes their partners. Leos are stubborn, self-centered, and arrogant. Two Leos are said to be incompatible because they are too much alike, which could create conflict between Gerry and Theresa if they&#39;re not careful.






 Gerry &amp; Theresa Have Different lifestyles 
          

Gerry&#39;s claim to be a “retired restaurateur” is based on the fact that he once owned a diner which he sold decades ago. Since retiring, he has occasionally worked maintenance jobs as a handyman. On the other hand, Theresa may be marrying a retiree, but the career-driven woman still works as a financial services professional. Theresa works for TFS Financial Services as a senior complication and operations liaison, according to the wealth management company’s website. She is passionate about trading stocks and has an estimated net worth of between $500,000 and $1 million.

Theresa wasn&#39;t always a trader. She taught herself to invest in the stock market and used this knowledge to make money in the market before landing her high-paying job at TFS. With Gerry being mostly retired and Theresa working a high-pressure job that requires many hours, they live totally different lifestyles. This will be a challenge in their marriage going forward.






 Gerry and Theresa Are Financially Incompatible 
          

Planning a wedding can be stressful, especially a wedding airing on national television. On December 25, RadarOnline received reports from a tipster that Theresa and Gerry were struggling to manage pre-wedding stress. According to a source close to the couple, the main point of contention is allegedly that Theresa wants Gerry to sign a prenup. “He’s offended that she doesn’t trust him. They’re bickering all the time now — unless the cameras are on.” 

The insider went on, “She wants to stick it out, though her friends think it’s for the wrong reasons.” The reports also claimed that Theresa’s friends were encouraging her to reconsider the union, considering Gerry&#39;s multiple lies and the fact that she hasn&#39;t known him for very long. Despite her own concerns and these alleged warnings from friends, Theresa is reportedly going ahead with the televised wedding plans.






 Gerry Loves Another Woman 
          

The first season of The Golden Bachelor may have ended happily for Gerry and Theresa, but for Leslie Fhima, it ended with a broken heart. The show&#39;s final moments were hard to watch. Gerry told both women that he loved them and even told Leslie that she was &#34;the one.&#34; If Gerry was being honest with both women, he would be in love with both of them. Being in love with two different women, as Gerry seems to be, is a bad way to start a life together.

For her part, Leslie seems to feel that Gerry led her on, and she was still upset about it long after the final rose. Leslie grew close to Theresa during the filming of the show, and the two have stayed on good terms. On the other hand, Leslie and Gerry aren&#39;t on speaking terms as she clearly felt as if she was led on by Gerry until the final moments. In an interview on the podcast Bachelor Happy Hour, Leslie struggled to say whether she can even respect Gerry. She obviously continues to harbor negative feelings towards him and isn&#39;t over what happened between them on The Golden Bachelor.






The Golden Bachelor Wedding will air on January 4, 2024, on ABC.
