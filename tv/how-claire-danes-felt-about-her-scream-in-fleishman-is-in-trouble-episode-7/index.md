Summary

Episode 7 of Fleishman Is in Trouble brings a powerful screaming scene that showcases Rachel&#39;s vulnerability and trauma.


  Rachel&#39;s postpartum depression stems from an assault by her doctor during labor, which Toby failed to fully comprehend.   Claire Danes, who portrays Rachel, found the screaming scene cathartic and drew on her own personal experience.  






Fleishman Is in Trouble episode 7 turned the miniseries on its head thanks to a memorable screaming scene involving Rachel Fleishman (Claire Danes). The 2022 Hulu series was created and directed by Taffy Brodesser-Akner, and Fleishman Is in Trouble based on her novel of the same name. It centers on Toby Fleishman (Jesse Eisenberg) a hepatology doctor new to dating apps following his divorce from Rachel. Toby discovers he is much more eligible as a 41-year-old than he was in his twenties, but just when he thought he was about to enjoy a summer full of wild dates and casual sex, Rachel disappears, leaving Toby alone with their two children.

The show cuts back and forth between present day and flashbacks to Toby and Rachel&#39;s increasingly unhappy marriage, with the first six episodes largely shown from Toby&#39;s perspective. At the beginning of his relationship with Rachel, she is warm and her passionate. But everything changes after the birth of their first child when Rachel slips into postpartum depression. She alleviates this by hurling herself into her work as a theater agent at the expense, according to Toby of her home life. Fleishman Is in Trouble paints Toby as a dedicated father doctor whose world has been turned upside down by the selfish Rachel — that is, until episode 7.

 Claire Danes Thought Her Fleishman Is In Trouble Episode 7 Scream Was &#34;Insane Catharsis&#34; 
          

Fleishman Is in Trouble episode 7, &#34;Me Time&#34;, finally shows events from Rachel&#39;s perspective. The reason for her severe postpartum depression was that while in labor, she was assaulted by her doctor, who broke her water without her consent — an incident Toby only heard about and failed to grasp the severity of. In addition to her work, Rachel eventually finds solace in an affair with a friend&#39;s husband, Sam Rothberg (Josh Stamberg). Following Rachel&#39;s divorce, Sam convinces her to accompany him on a wellness retreat, and it&#39;s there that everything changes for her.

Rachel undergoes a primal therapy treatment in which she is instructed to release her pain by screaming. Self-conscious at first, Rachel lets out a few half-hearted attempts, but upon encouragement from her therapist, she lets out a guttural, heart-smashing scream as she attempts to expel the trauma from her body. It is the most intense scene in Fleishman Is in Trouble, and shows Rachel at her most vulnerable and raw. The talented Claire Danes agreed on the powerfulness of the scene, and told THR:



&#34;The scream I really enjoyed. The scream I didn’t have much anxiety about because when do you get to do that? That’s like, not a thing. (Laughs.) That’s not one of those scenes you’re going to compare to another version. I just love the baldness of it. I love how it’s set up, too. That she’s completely resistant; she’s kind of giggling nervously. She’s working real hard to evade and avoid it. And then it allows for this kind of insane catharsis.&#34;






 Danes Had A Unique Reference Point For The Fleishman Is In Trouble Scream 
          

While her Fleishman Is in Trouble character Rachel had little experience in unleashing her rage, the same can&#39;t be said for Claire Danes. In the same Hollywood Reporter interview, she confessed to having screamed at an obnoxious man while attending a party in her early twenties. Danes divulged:



&#34;I remember one time when I was in my early 20s — this is a bizarre story — but I was playing some parlor game at Gaby Hoffmann’s house, she’s a dear friend, and one of her college friends was being kind of annoying. He was just being disruptive for the sake of it. And something happened where I just stared at him and screamed. I didn’t protest. It was just this animalistic scream. And once it was happening, I was like, &#39;Oh, I think I just have to commit to this.&#39; It was bizarre; it was so inappropriate and I don’t know why that happened, but it did. I think it probably helped me with this because I amazingly had a reference point for it.&#34;




This puts Danes and Rachel at opposite ends of the same coin, where the actress screamed based on her own human instincts while her Fleishman Is in Trouble character needed coaxing to let go. And while Rachel&#39;s need to scream came from a far darker, more traumatic place, both were war cries against those who made the women feel like they couldn&#39;t take up space.
