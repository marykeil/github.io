## Literature Review
With the Arrowverse coming to its end in 2024, the first major update on Superman &amp; Lois season 4 finally emerges after several months.




Superman &amp; Lois season 4 gets closer to finally happening as Lois Lane herself shares a big update about the final season of the DC TV show. While The Flash season 9 was the end of the Earth-Prime side of the Arrowverse, the franchise is officially ending in 2024 with Superman &amp; Lois season 4. Superman &amp; Lois will be the last DC TV show on The CW, which has been the home of DC superhero series since 2006 with Smallville.




At the time of this article&#39;s publication, The CW has yet to announce an air date for Superman &amp; Lois season 4. However, following the end of the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes in 2023, Superman &amp; Lois season 4 is officially getting ready to start filming as Elizabeth Tulloch shared the title page for the final season premiere on Instagram.

          

Titled &#34;The End &amp; The Beginning,&#34; the Superman &amp; Lois season 4 premiere was written by the showrunners Todd Helbing and Brent Fletcher. &#34;The End &amp; The Beginning&#34; will be directed by returning Superman &amp; Lois director Gregory Smith.

                  Superman &amp; Lois Cast Guide: Every New &amp; Returning Arrowverse Character   Superman &amp; Lois is the latest Arrowverse series to join The CW and this is every new and returning character that will be part of the DC TV cast.    





 What We Know About Superman &amp; Lois Season 4 
         

While Superman &amp; Lois season 4 is happening, there will be significant changes taking place as the show goes into its final season. One of the conditions for Superman &amp; Lois to get renewed was a major trimming of the budget, which affected both the cast and their episode order. For the first time since Arrow season 8, Superman &amp; Lois will only have 10 episodes for its final season, as the previous seasons had between 13-15 installments.

Michael Cudlitz, who debuted as Lex Luthor at the end of Superman &amp; Lois season 3, will be back, this time as a series regular. However, seven established series regulars will not be back in full capacity, as WolÃ© Parks (John Henry Irons/Steel), Tayler Buck (Natalie Irons), Emmanuelle Chriqui (Lana Lang), Dylan Walsh (Sam Lane), Erik Valdez (Kyle Cushing), Inde Navarrette (Sarah Cortez), and Sofia Hasmik (Chrissy Beppo) were affected by the budget cuts. Some of them will, however, appear in a handful of episodes during the final season.




In terms of storylines, the Superman &amp; Lois season 4 premiere will pick up right where the season 3 finale left off as Clark was in the midst of his battle with Doomsday. Whether or not other Arrowverse players will have any role in Superman &amp; Lois season 4 remains to be seen for now. Hopefully, as Superman &amp; Lois season 4 starts filming this week, The CW will start making announcements for the final season in terms of what viewers can look forward to in the Arrowverse&#39;s final show.
