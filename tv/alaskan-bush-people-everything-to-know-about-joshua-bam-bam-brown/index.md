## Literature Review
Alaskan Bush People&#39;s Joshua &#34;Bam Bam&#34; Brown has been through a lot in his life during the show, including a whirlwind romance and legal issues. 




Alaskan Bush People&#39;s Joshua &#34;Bam Bam&#34; Brown is quite an interesting person, so it&#39;s no surprise that there is curiosity surrounding his life outside the show. As one of the stars of Alaskan Bush People, Joshua is the second-oldest brother of seven siblings. He has been called the cutest of the brothers, as well as the most educated.




The family shot to fame thanks to the popularity of Alaskan Bush People on the Discovery Channel. The Brown family had been living in the bush their entire lives thanks to their parents, Billy and Ami Brown, who wanted to pursue a life off the grid. Even with Billy Brown passing away in 2021 after suffering a fatal seizure, the majority of the family now resides on top of a mountain in Washington state.


 Joshua Brown Dated A Producer On Alaskan Bush People 
          

The most pensive of the gang, Joshua originally left Alaskan Bush People for a relationship with a field producer back in 2017, during the earlier seasons of the show. Even though there were rumors that the relationship did not work out, The Sun reported that Joshua&#39;s long-term relationship with Allison Kagan is still going strong as of 2020, but it&#39;s unknown if they&#39;re still together. Back during the earlier episodes, Joshua told the cameras that he had fallen in love with a “city girl.” Once their relationship became more serious, Joshua returned to the farm and the show in 2019. Sadly for Joshua, his family hadn&#39;t welcomed his girlfriend even though they had all known her longer than any of his brother’s wives.






 Joshua Brown&#39;s Legal Issues &amp; Job 
          

The family found themselves in hot water with the government for lying on permanent fund dividend applications. Both Joshua and Billy pled guilty to one count of second-degree unsworn falsification, which was a misdemeanor. Joshua was also involved in a fatal car crash, but he wasn&#39;t at fault and isn&#39;t expected to face charges. As for his career, Joshua grew up most of his life on the family’s fishing boat and is known as the family expert when it comes to being out on the water. However, he&#39;s currently focused on his photography career.

In recent years, Joshua has become a nicer person. Most of his siblings found him to be an aggressive know-it-all and hard to work with. However, the second eldest has tried his best at listening better and is now putting his relationships first. Hopefully, one day Allison will appear on Alaskan Bush People, so the viewers can get a more in-depth look into her and Joshua&#39;s relationship if they&#39;re still together.
