## Literature Review
Ahead of its much-anticipated season 7 premiere, CBS releases a Young Sheldon season 6 recap video hinting what storylines will be focused on. 




A brand new Young Sheldon season 6 recap video teases season 7 storylines. In about a month, Sheldon and his family will be back for the last time as the Coopers say goodbye at the end of their upcoming year on the small screen. Burdened by the sheer number of storylines that need to be tackled with significantly fewer episodes left, there is nervous anticipation about what Young Sheldon season 7 may look like.




While CBS has yet to release any new footage for Young Sheldon season 7, a season 6 recap video (via TV Promos) hints at some of the arcs that the final year will focus on. Check out the clip below:


 

The video mainly focuses on the Young Sheldon season 6 finale events, which revolved around Sheldon&#39;s move to Germany for the summer. However, there&#39;s also some attention to Mandy and Georgie&#39;s arc, including the birth of Baby Cece.


 What The Young Sheldon Season 6 Recap Reveals About Season 7? 
          

Sheldon and the Cooper family went through so many challenges and changes in Young Sheldon season 6. After years of slowly transitioning to become a true family comedy/drama, it finally achieved its ensemble status with an increased focus on the rest of the clan instead of just tackling Sheldon&#39;s personal arc, which mostly felt flat and out of place. Coming into its final season, Young Sheldon needs to make up for that lapse while maintaining all the other lingering storylines.




Given its shortened final year, it makes sense that Young Sheldon season 7 will focus on the Cooper family. As hinted by the recap video, there likely won&#39;t be any unnecessary ancillary characters to take up screen time from its protagonists. That&#39;s disappointing for Paige, whose arc has been left in limbo following her and Missy&#39;s daring joyride in Young Sheldon season 6. Interestingly, however, the clip above features Pastor Rob, which may indicate that he will again return before The Big Bang Theory prequel wraps up.

                  Young Sheldon Season 7&#39;s Finale Was Already Revealed 6 Years Ago   Young Sheldon will end when Sheldon moves out of the Cooper household and to California â€” something that was already similarly revealed back in 2018.    

Whether Young Sheldon can deliver a satisfying send-off, given season 7&#39;s shortened run is currently uncertain. However, it will boil down to the writers&#39; discernment of which arcs need to be central and which ones need to be cast aside. Aside from transitioning Sheldon to his future life in California, it&#39;s also imperative that the spin-off gives the rest of the family their deserved swan songs.
