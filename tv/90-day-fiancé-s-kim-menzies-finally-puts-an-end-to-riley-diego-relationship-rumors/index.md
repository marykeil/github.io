Kimberly told the fan that she is just “good friends” with Riley and “that’s all we will ever be.” One fan said they spotted Kim and Riley on the Pillow Talk episode for 90 Day: The Single Life and “thought y’all [were] a couple now.” The fan agreed that friendship was, however, “a great foundation.” Kim replied, “Friendship is all we will be.” She said it was “hard” to find good friends nowadays. When someone else asked Kim why she was choosing to be just friends with Riley when their chemistry was “undeniable,” Riley was the one who replied, “Because that[&#39;s] what works for us and what we both want.”

Riley also decided to address his relationship speculation with Kim on his own Instagram page. He posted a meme featuring American Dad characters Francine and Roger. Riley wrote that people were telling him, “Y’all should be more than friends.” However, he felt like unbothered Roger in the clip. He wrote that he appreciates the “friendship” that he has.

There was speculation that the woman in Riley’s photo was Kim, but even then, Riley and Kim both maintained that it wasn’t her, and they were just good friends.
