Summary

  Reacher season 2 episode 6 delivers a sad ending, hinting at a darker finale for the series.   The death of Russo in episode 6 is the saddest moment in the show so far, as the character was developed and had a heroic journey.   The deaths of certain characters in previous episodes were not as impactful because they were not given much screen time, but Russo&#39;s death had emotional weight.  







Reacher season 2, episode 6, &#34;New York&#39;s Finest&#34; delivers one of the saddest moments in the series, which seemingly teases a darker finale. In its initial moments, &#34;New York&#39;s Finest&#34; begins on an optimistic note, where Reacher, Neagley, Karla, and David find some new clues leading to Marlo Burns. Tracking Marlo proves immensely beneficial because it assures Reacher and his team that Swan was trying to stop Langston and not team up with him.

However, even though Reacher, Neagley, Karla, and David make some leaps in their investigation in episode 6, it all ends on a tragic note. While Reacher season 2, episode 6&#39;s sad ending alone is heartbreaking, it&#39;s hard not to wonder if the season will only get darker as it progresses. Although the show&#39;s tone may entirely change in episode 7, episode 6&#39;s grim conclusion seems like a setup for a more intense and somber finale.

                  Reacher Season 2&#39;s Biggest Death Proves Amazon&#39;s Teased Spinoff Would Be Perfect   Reacher season 2, episode 6 features the biggest death of the year thus far, and it further proves that the proposed Amazon spinoff would work.     





 Russo&#39;s Death Is Reacher&#39;s Saddest Moment Yet In Amazon&#39;s TV Show 
         

Amazon&#39;s Reacher has had a fair share of sad moments in its first two seasons. For instance, Reacher&#39;s final goodbye to Roscoe in season 1&#39;s closing scenes before he leaves Margrave is bittersweet, signifying the end of a relationship that made him reconsider his lifestyle choices. Season 2&#39;s opening moments also had tragic scenes where Reacher and Neagley had to visit Franz&#39;s wife and child after his death to learn more about what he was involved in. However, like the original Lee Child books, Amazon&#39;s Reacher never truly embraced a poignant tone until season 2, episode 6&#39;s final moments marked the end of Russo&#39;s journey.


 




After initially making viewers suspicious about Russo and his motivations, Reacher season 2&#39;s episode 6 portrayed him as a hero who put his life on the line to save Marlo&#39;s young daughter&#39;s life. Although other characters, like Reacher&#39;s older brother and former team members, died in the series, their deaths did not happen on-screen. Flashbacks revealed these characters&#39; roles in Reacher&#39;s life, but the Amazon show did not actively invest time into developing them, making their deaths less impactful. However, Reacher took its time to make Russo grow on audiences before killing him, which made his death the saddest moment of the show.

 Russo&#39;s Death Sets Up A Much Darker Finale For Reacher Season 2 
         

Russo&#39;s death proves that Amazon&#39;s Reacher is willing to deviate from the source to make its storyline more emotional than the original Lee Child novels. This could mean Russo&#39;s demise was a mere setup for an even darker finale for Reacher season 2. The show has been emphasizing a little too much on how David has a family and how he has more to lose than the other surviving members of Reacher&#39;s 110th Special Investigations Unit.

Dixon, too, proved her blind loyalty to Reacher in episode 6 by assuring him that she would kill Swan for him if necessary. By portraying how both characters are deeply connected to Reacher and risking everything by joining his team, Reacher season 2 might be setting the stage for an emotionally charged conclusion where, like Russo, one of them could die.
