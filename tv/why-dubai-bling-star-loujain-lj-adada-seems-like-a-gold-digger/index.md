# Why Dubai Bling Star Loujain  LJ  Adada Seems Like A Gold Digger


## SUMMARY 



  Loujain &#34;LJ&#34; Adada, star of Dubai Bling, has faced speculation about being a gold digger due to her previous marriage to Saudi Arabian businessman Walid Juffali, who was significantly older and wealthier than her.   Loujain has clarified that she loved Walid for who he was and not for his money, but her lifestyle suggests she may have received a substantial inheritance from his fortune.   Despite the controversy surrounding her previous marriage, Loujain is a hardworking and ambitious individual, focused on growing her successful career and hoping to find love again.

## Literature Review
While Loujain &#39;LJ&#39; Adada&#39;s extravagant lifestyle on Dubai Bling is impressive, details of her former marriage definitely trigger some questions.




Loujain &#34;LJ&#34; Adada made a strong impression when Dubai Bling premiered in October 2022, and it&#39;s time to talk about why she may be a gold digger. While it&#39;s easy to appreciate her strong personality and great fashion sense, the new Netflix star often seems like someone who married for money. Loujain, who was raised in Lebanon, moved to Dubai in 2021. On Dubai Bling, she was introduced as a hardworking model, television host, and mother. As one of the best reality TV shows, it&#39;s no wonder Dubai Bling has returned for season 2.




While Loujain&#39;s family troubles and failed attempts at dating were intriguing, more interest surrounded Loujain&#39;s previous marriage. Loujain and her late husband, Saudi Arabian businessman Walid Juffali, married in an extravagant ceremony that cost millions of dollars. The beauty married Walid in 2012, when she was just 25 and he was 60. In addition to their 35-year age difference, Loujain was Walid&#39;s third wife. At the time, Walid was still married to his second wife, Christina Estrada.


 Loujain &#34;LJ&#34; Adada&#39;s Husband Passed Away In 2016 

 

Although Loujain has been called a gold digger since she married, the Dubai Bling star has clarified that she loved Walid. Loujain further explained on Dubai Bling that while her husband&#39;s billion-dollar empire was a plus, it wasn&#39;t why she married him. Unfortunately, Walid, who&#39;d had cancer, passed away in 2016, shortly after their second child was born. Since then, Loujain has regularly posted photos and memories of Walid online. She shared pictures from their wedding on the sixth anniversary of his passing.






 Loujain &#34;LJ&#34; Adada Is Believed To Be Wealthy 

 

According to Women&#39;s Health, Walid had a net worth of approximately $9.2 billion when he died, and while his fortune was split between Loujain and his ex-wives, the Dubai Bling star likely received a hefty inheritance. Although Loujain&#39;s net worth isn&#39;t known, she seems to live a luxurious lifestyle, just like Dubai Bling cast member Ebraheem Al Samadi. While the late Bling Empire star Anna Shay may have been the richest cast member, Loujain appears wealthy. Her lifestyle could be funded through money from Walid&#39;s former empire, modeling opportunities, and social media posts.

Although several Dubai Bling stars, including DJ Bliss and Safa Siddiqui, have spouses, Loujain&#39;s previous marriage has been at the forefront of viewers&#39; minds due to its exciting circumstances. While it&#39;s easy to think that Dubai Bling star Loujain married for money, due to Walid&#39;s massive fortune and their significant age difference, Loujain is entrepreneurial and expanding her successful career. Loujain was shown trying to dip her toes back into the dating pool on Dubai Bling, like Kevin Kreider from Bling Empire. Although the endeavors didn&#39;t work out, hopefully, she will find love again.






Dubai Bling is available for streaming on Netflix.
