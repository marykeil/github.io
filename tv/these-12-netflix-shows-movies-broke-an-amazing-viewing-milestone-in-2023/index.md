## Literature Review
Netflix has become a true giant in the entertainment industry, and its report proved some of its movies and TV shows performed extremely well.




2023 was a year filled with hit shows and movies for Netflix, and 12 of them broke an impressive viewing milestone. Netflix initially began as a streaming service, but over the years, it has created a name for itself as a production and distribution company, which resulted in critically acclaimed TV series like 2016&#39;s Stranger Things and The Crown as well as big Academy Award-winning films like 2018&#39;s Roma, 2020&#39;s Mank, and 2019&#39;s Mariage Story. Although Netflix found itself in the middle of a controversy after stopping account-sharing in 2023, the streaming service had some major wins when it comes to returning series, new shows, and movies.
In December 2023, Netflix offered unprecedented access to the performance metrics of its streaming with its first-ever engagement report called What We Watched. The report covered more than 18,000 titles, both original and licensed, and it gave access to the total viewership between January and June 2023. Although it doesn&#39;t paint the full picture of what Netflix considers a success, it&#39;s a start that gives producers and shareholders more visibility into how the streaming service is doing. Based on Netflix&#39;s details, it&#39;s now possible to calculate how many hours some shows and movies have been viewed each day since their release, and the results are astounding.

That means The Night Agent season 1 was watched for over 8.2 million hours every day over 99 days between March 23 and June 30.





 11  Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story: Season 1 
May 4, 2023

Bridgerton was already a success for Netflix, which is why it approved a prequel spinoff following some of the characters from the hit historical romance. Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Series follows Queen Charlotte&#39;s life, both in the present of Bridgerton, and her past, leading to her wedding to King George. The spinoff had stunning reviews, with a rating of 95% from the critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and the numbers confirm its success. Netflix&#39;s report reveals the spinoff was viewed for 503 million hours, which means 8.7 million hours daily over 57 days since its release date on May 4, 2023, and the end of the Netflix report on June 30.





 10  Ginny &amp; Georgia: Season 2 
January 5, 2023

Ginny &amp; Georgia season 2 continued the story of teenage Ginny and her mom, Georgia.

Ginny &amp; Georgia season 2 was filled with shocking moments, and it premiered on Netflix on January 5. Season 2 was watched for a total of 665.1 million hours, becoming Netflix&#39;s second most-viewed show after The Night Agent. Breaking those numbers down, Ginny &amp; Georgia was watched daily for a total of 3.75 million hours. In addition, season 1 wasn&#39;t that far off, bringing 302.1 million hours viewed in the first half of 2023, despite premiering in 2021.

December 30, 2022
        

The Glory is a Netflix Korean drama that follows a young woman, Moon Dong-eun, who, after being bullied into dropping out of school, decides to get revenge decades later, now with an elaborate scheme to make her abusers pay for their crimes. The Netflix report reveals that the show, which premiered on December 30, 2022, was watched for a total of 622.8 million hours and became the third series of 2023. That means The Glory was watched for 3.4 million hours daily, an amazing feat for a series that received little promo overseas.





 8  You: Season 4 
February 9 and March 9, 2023
        

 You

Joe Goldberg might have overstayed his welcome, but season 4 proved You was still successful despite its obvious drop in quality. You season 4 sent the charming serial killer to London, UK, where he pretended to be a teacher and had a murder mystery vibe as Joe dealt with the &#34;Eat the Rich&#34; killer. The show was divided into two parts, as it premiered on February 9 and March 9, 2023. Although Netflix doesn&#39;t reveal the numbers for both, You season 4 was watched for a total of 440.6 million hours. That means, since the release of Part 2, You was watched for a total of 3.9 million hours a day.

Besides being the most-viewed movie on the platform in the first half of 2023, it was also the 14th most-viewed title overall, with a total of 249.9 million hourly views. That translates into 5.1 million hours viewed daily, which is huge for Jennifer Lopez, who will star in another Netflix movie, Atlas.
