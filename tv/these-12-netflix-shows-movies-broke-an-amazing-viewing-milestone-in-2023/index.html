  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Netflix released its first-ever engagement report called &ldquo;What We Watched&rdquo; in December 2023, providing data on total viewership of over 18,000 titles from January to June. This report offers more visibility into the streaming service&rsquo;s performance.
&ldquo;The Night Agent&rdquo; was Netflix&rsquo;s biggest show during this period, with a total of 812.1 million viewing hours, averaging over 8.2 million hours daily between March and June.
Shows like &ldquo;Ginny &amp; Georgia&rdquo; season 2 and &ldquo;The Glory&rdquo; were also successful, with 665.1 million hours and 622.8 million hours viewed respectively.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Netflix has become a true giant in the entertainment industry, and its report proved some of its movies and TV shows performed extremely well.</p>
<p>2023 was a year filled with hit shows and movies for Netflix, and 12 of them broke an impressive viewing milestone. Netflix initially began as a streaming service, but over the years, it has created a name for itself as a production and distribution company, which resulted in critically acclaimed TV series like 2016&rsquo;s Stranger Things and The Crown as well as big Academy Award-winning films like 2018&rsquo;s Roma, 2020&rsquo;s Mank, and 2019&rsquo;s Mariage Story. Although Netflix found itself in the middle of a controversy after stopping account-sharing in 2023, the streaming service had some major wins when it comes to returning series, new shows, and movies.
In December 2023, Netflix offered unprecedented access to the performance metrics of its streaming with its first-ever engagement report called What We Watched. The report covered more than 18,000 titles, both original and licensed, and it gave access to the total viewership between January and June 2023. Although it doesn&rsquo;t paint the full picture of what Netflix considers a success, it&rsquo;s a start that gives producers and shareholders more visibility into how the streaming service is doing. Based on Netflix&rsquo;s details, it&rsquo;s now possible to calculate how many hours some shows and movies have been viewed each day since their release, and the results are astounding.</p>
<p>Netflix Is Finally Pulling Back The Curtain - But The Streaming Service Is Still Hiding More Than You Think
Netflix&rsquo;s first-half 2023 Engagement Report sets a new precedent for the streaming giant&rsquo;s level of data transparency without offering much context.</p>
<p>12  The Night Agent: Season 1
March 23, 2023</p>
<p>The Night Agent</p>
<p>Release Date   March 23, 2023    Cast   Gabriel Basso , Luciane Buchanan , Hong Chau , Sarah Desjardins , Fola Evans-Akingbola , Eve Harlow , Enrique Murciano , Phoenix Raei , DB Woodside    Genres   Action , Drama , Thriller    Seasons   1</p>
<p>The Night Agent follows FBI agent Peter Sutherland, who guards the Night Action phone and discovers a deadly conspiracy at the White House. The show is an adaptation of Matthew Quirk&rsquo;s novel of the same name, created by Shawn Ryan, and starring Gabriel Basso as the lead character. The show was a massive success, because, aside from its good reviews, as it holds a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix&rsquo;s report revealed it was watched by an astonishing total of 812.1 million viewing hours, becoming Netflix&rsquo;s biggest show of 2023. That means The Night Agent season 1 was watched for over 8.2 million hours every day over 99 days between March 23 and June 30.</p>
<p>11  Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story: Season 1
May 4, 2023</p>
<p>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</p>
<p>Release Date   May 4, 2023    Cast   India Amarteifio , Adjoa Andoh , Michelle Fairley , Ruth Gemmell , Golda Rosheuvel , Corey Mylchreest    Genres   Biography , Drama , History    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Bridgerton was already a success for Netflix, which is why it approved a prequel spinoff following some of the characters from the hit historical romance. Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Series follows Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s life, both in the present of Bridgerton, and her past, leading to her wedding to King George. The spinoff had stunning reviews, with a rating of 95% from the critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and the numbers confirm its success. Netflix&rsquo;s report reveals the spinoff was viewed for 503 million hours, which means 8.7 million hours daily over 57 days since its release date on May 4, 2023, and the end of the Netflix report on June 30.</p>
<p>10  Ginny &amp; Georgia: Season 2
January 5, 2023</p>
<p>Ginny and Georgia</p>
<p>Release Date   February 24, 2021    Cast   Felix Mallard , Brianne Howey , Mason Temple , Scott Porter , Jennifer Robertson , Raymond Ablack , Diesel La Torraca , Sara Waisglass , Antonia Gentry    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Ginny &amp; Georgia season 2 continued the story of teenage Ginny and her mom, Georgia. It further explored Georgia&rsquo;s past, as well as Ginny&rsquo;s dealing with the truth about her mom being a murderer. Ginny &amp; Georgia season 2 was filled with shocking moments, and it premiered on Netflix on January 5. Season 2 was watched for a total of 665.1 million hours, becoming Netflix&rsquo;s second most-viewed show after The Night Agent. Breaking those numbers down, Ginny &amp; Georgia was watched daily for a total of 3.75 million hours. In addition, season 1 wasn&rsquo;t that far off, bringing 302.1 million hours viewed in the first half of 2023, despite premiering in 2021.</p>
<p>9  The Glory: Season 1
December 30, 2022</p>
<p>The Glory is a Netflix Korean drama that follows a young woman, Moon Dong-eun, who, after being bullied into dropping out of school, decides to get revenge decades later, now with an elaborate scheme to make her abusers pay for their crimes. The Netflix report reveals that the show, which premiered on December 30, 2022, was watched for a total of 622.8 million hours and became the third series of 2023. That means The Glory was watched for 3.4 million hours daily, an amazing feat for a series that received little promo overseas.</p>
<p>8  You: Season 4
February 9 and March 9, 2023</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Release Date   September 9, 2018    Cast   Elizabeth Lail , Michaela McManus , Ambyr Childers , Victoria Pedretti , Luca Padovan , Scott Speedman , Travis Van Winkle , Penn Badgley , Jenna Ortega , Shay Mitchell    Genres   Drama , Crime    Seasons   4</p>
<p>Joe Goldberg might have overstayed his welcome, but season 4 proved You was still successful despite its obvious drop in quality. You season 4 sent the charming serial killer to London, UK, where he pretended to be a teacher and had a murder mystery vibe as Joe dealt with the &ldquo;Eat the Rich&rdquo; killer. The show was divided into two parts, as it premiered on February 9 and March 9, 2023. Although Netflix doesn&rsquo;t reveal the numbers for both, You season 4 was watched for a total of 440.6 million hours. That means, since the release of Part 2, You was watched for a total of 3.9 million hours a day.</p>
<p>Netflix Data Reveals Reese Witherspoon&rsquo;s 2023 Rom-Com Was A Success (But Its Reviews Don&rsquo;t Show That)
Netflix&rsquo;s data from its engagement report shows that Reese Witherspoon&rsquo;s 2023 rom-com was actually a streaming success, despite its poor reviews.</p>
<p>7  Outer Banks: Season 3
February 23, 2023</p>
<p>Outer Banks</p>
<p>Release Date   April 15, 2020    Cast   Jonathan Daviss , Charles Esten , Madison Bailey , Austin North , Madelyn Cline , Rudy Pankow , Chase Stokes , Drew Starkey    Genres   Drama , Crime , Action    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Outer Banks season 3 started with the Pogues as they washed ashore on a deserted island. The characters have been through a lot throughout the show&rsquo;s three seasons, and season 3 wasn&rsquo;t easy on them, either, as they got caught up in another race for a treasure that made them run for their lives. Outer Banks season 3 premiered on February 23, 2023, and was a huge hit, with a total of 402.5 million viewing hours. That means a total of 3.14 million daily views during that window, which shows why Netflix rushed to renew Outer Banks for season 4.</p>
<p>6  Wednesday: Season 1
November 23, 2022</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Release Date   November 16, 2022    Cast   Jenna Ortega , Catherine Zeta-Jones , Luis Guzman , Gwendoline Christie , Riki Lindhome , Jamie McShane , Christina Ricci , Hunter Doohan , Emma Myers , Joy Sunday    Genres   Comedy , Fantasy , Supernatural    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Netflix&rsquo;s spinoff from the beloved Addams Family, Wednesday, was a major success, and the numbers prove it. Wednesday broke Netflix&rsquo;s viewership record, inspired so many Halloween outfits, and dance recreations, and represented a newfound love for the Addams Family, leading to Netflix renewing it for season 2. The show follows the titular character to a new school called Nevermore Academy, where weird murders start happening. The show premiered on November 23, 2022, and, throughout the first half of 2023, was Netflix&rsquo;s fourth show with 507.7 million viewed hours, which means 2.3 million daily views.

<p>Netflix Report Shows Why Sci-Fi Series Was Divisively Canceled After 1 Season (Despite Its Good Reviews)
Netflix&rsquo;s engagement report gives an explanation for the cancellation of this gone-too-soon sci-fi series, despite bringing in good reviews.</p>
<p>5  FUBAR: Season 1
May 25, 2023</p>
<p>FUBAR</p>
<p>Release Date   May 5, 2023    Cast   Arnold Schwarzenegger , Monica Barbaro , Jay Baruchel , Aparna Brielle , Andy Buckley , Fortune Feimster , Barbara Eve Harris , Gabriel Luna    Genres   Action , Adventure    Seasons   1</p>
<p>FUBAR follows a CIA operative on the verge of retirement, bringing Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first leading role in a live-action television series, where he plays Luke Brunner. The show didn&rsquo;t receive the best reviews, with a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but it did make viewers curious. FUBAR was watched for a total of 266.2 million hours, which means almost 7.4 million hours daily since its premiere on May 25, a huge feat for Netflix that showcases Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s ability to reinvent himself as an actor.</p>
<p>4  La Reina Del Sur: Season 3
December 30, 2022</p>
<p>La Reina del Sur</p>
<p>Release Date   February-00-00    Distributor   Telemundo</p>
<p>The Kate del Castillo-led show La Reina del Sur follows Teresa Mendoza, a woman who became the leader of a drug cartel. Season 3 has Teresa escape from prison after four years of her 85-year sentence, and received widespread critical acclaim. Its popularity was proven by the numbers, too, because, although it&rsquo;s not available globally, La Reina del Sur season 3 was watched for 429.6 million hours, which means a little over 2.3 million hours throughout those 183 days.</p>
<p>3  The Mother
May 12, 2023</p>
<p>The Jennifer Lopez-led thriller The Mother was Netflix&rsquo;s biggest movie in the first half of 2023. The thriller stars Lopez as a skilled assassin who does everything in her power to protect her daughter, including giving her up for the first years of her life as she goes into hiding and plots against two huge criminals. Besides being the most-viewed movie on the platform in the first half of 2023, it was also the 14th most-viewed title overall, with a total of 249.9 million hourly views. That translates into 5.1 million hours viewed daily, which is huge for Jennifer Lopez, who will star in another Netflix movie, Atlas.</p>
<p>Netflix&rsquo;s Biggest Movie Of 2023 Isn&rsquo;t What You&rsquo;d Expect (&amp; It&rsquo;s Huge For An Upcoming Release)
Netflix has revealed its biggest movie of 2023, and not only is the title a surprise, but it&rsquo;s good news for one of the streamer&rsquo;s 2024 releases.</p>
<p>2  Extraction 2
June 16, 2023</p>
<p>Extraction 2&ndash;</p>
<p>Release Date   June 16, 2023    Director   Sam Hargrave    Cast   Chris Hemsworth , Golshifteh Farahani , Daniel Bernhardt , Tinatin Dalakishvili , Sinead Phelps , Jenn Kirk    Genres   Action , Thriller</p>
<p>The highly-anticipated sequel to Netflix&rsquo;s original movie, Extraction, premiered on June 16, 2023. Extraction 2 brought Chris Hemsworth back as Tyler Rake, although the first movie ended with him seemingly dying. With a lot of action and explosions, Rake sets out on a new dangerous mission, which succeeds in bringing a lot of viewers to the movie. The film had a total of 201.8 million hours viewed, which translates to the biggest daily hours on the list: 14.4 million a day since its premiere. Given the fact that Extraction 2 only had 2 weeks to count, it might lead to it becoming Netflix&rsquo;s biggest film of 2023.</p>
<p>1  Fake Profile: Season 1
May 31, 2023</p>
<p>Fake Profile</p>
<p>Release Date   May 31, 2023    Cast   Carolina Miranda , Rodolfo Salas , Lincoln Palomeque , Manuela González    Genres   Drama , Romance , Thriller    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Fake Profile is a Colombian television series about Camila, who enters her dream relationship after meeting the perfect guy on a dating app. However, things aren&rsquo;t what they seem, and the series involves a lot of drama, twists, and steamy moments. Fake Profile will continue with season 2 because it became an instant hit. Although, just like La Reina del Sur, Fake Profile is not available globally, it has been watched on Netflix for a total of 206.5 million hours since its premiere on May 31, 2023, which translates into an astounding 6.88 million hours every day since its premiere on May 31, 2023.
