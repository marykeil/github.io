## Literature Review
Southern Charm season 9 is coming to a close very soon, meaning Southern Charm season 10 is about to begin. Here&#39;s everything to know so far.




Southern Charm season 9 will be coming to an end very soon, meaning Southern Charm season 10 isn&#39;t very far away. The Bravo series made waves in early 2014 when season 1 of the popular reality series aired. It started with a few current cast members, such as Craig Conover, Shep Rose, and Whitney Sudler-Smith, as well as Kathryn Dennis, Thomas Ravenel, Cameran Eubanks, and Jenna King. The cast has completely changed for the most part since the first season and has focused more on the women of the series rather than the men; it&#39;s also created spin-offs such as Southern Hospitality.




Southern Charm season 9 currently stars Craig, Shep, Austen Kroll, Olivia Flowers, Taylor Ann Green, Madison LeCroy, Leva Bonaparte, Venita Aspen, and newcomers Rod Razavi, Rodrigo Reyes, and Jarrett &#34;JT&#34; Thomas. The season&#39;s major storylines are the break-ups of Shep and Taylor and Olivia and Austen. Both couples ended around the same time, and some of them began leaning on each other, especially Taylor and Austen. Rumors of Taylor and Austen&#39;s hook-up began to swirl, and both Taylor and Austen admitted they kissed. This has greatly affected Taylor and Olivia&#39;s friendship, and it&#39;s unclear if the two will ever be friends again.

 Southern Charm Season 10 Latest News 
          




So far, there is no news regarding if and when Southern Charm season 10 will return. However, the show has been doing well since its inception in 2014, so it&#39;s safe to say that the series will likely be back for another season. So far, Southern Charm season 9 has been doing well in terms of ratings, according to TV Deets. The lowest ratings they had were for episode 5, which was 514,000 viewers, and their season-high was for episode 7, which was 702,000 viewers. The viewership is pretty high for a Bravo show, so it seems more than likely that Southern Charm season 10 will return in 2024.



 Southern Charm Season 10 Potential Release Window 
          

The time that Southern Charm airs has been all over the place since the beginning. Season 1 and Season 2 aired in March, while seasons 3 to 6 aired sometime between April and May. Season 7 aired in October, season 8 in June, with the most recent season airing in September. The last three seasons have aired during the second half of the year, so it&#39;s very likely that fans won&#39;t see Southern Charm season 10 until the fall of 2024. Since Southern Charm season 9 is still airing, and no reunion has been filmed, filming for next season likely won&#39;t start until 2024.






 Southern Charm Season 10 Potential Cast 
         

The cast for Southern Charm season 10 has yet to be confirmed. However, the cast chemistry on Southern Charm season 9 has been so great, that it wouldn&#39;t be shocking if the whole cast returned. The cast did go through a bit of a shake-up before season 9 after they announced Kathryn&#39;s departure from Southern Charm. This came as a shock to fans, but her exit allowed for new people to join.

Southern Charm season 9 introduced Rod, Rodrigo, and JT. So far, all three guys have made a splash on the show in their own way, so it&#39;s likely they will all be returning. Madison also returned as a full-time cast member this year and will likely return as a full-timer once again.

Despite Kathryn&#39;s shocking exit, it seems there may be hope for her return. During the Southern Charm panel at BravoCon 2023 (via Deadline), Craig revealed that he and Shep filmed with her for season 9; however, the scene never aired. Craig even said he hopes Kathryn will return to the show one day. &#34;We would love for her to come back. I think the door is always open. I think she’s working on herself and has a lot of work that she has to do before she comes back but I hope she’s doing well,&#34; he said, adding, &#34;Our goal is for next year that she comes back and gets to see you guys.&#34;






 Has Southern Charm Season 10 Been Filmed? 
          

Since Southern Charm season 9 has yet to film its reunion, Southern Charm season 10 likely hasn&#39;t started filming. For the past few years, Southern Charm has been filmed earlier in the year, usually starting sometime between January and February and ending a few months later, in March or April. The timeline is evident through Southern Charm season 7, which was filmed right before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, in a preview for next week&#39;s episodes, Shep mentioned a Page Six article that was about Taylor and Austen&#39;s hook-up. The article was published in March 2023, when the cast was on their cast trip to Jamaica, which usually takes place closer to the end of filming.



Southern Charm airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
