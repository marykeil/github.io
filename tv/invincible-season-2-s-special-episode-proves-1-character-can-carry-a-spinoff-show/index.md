## Literature Review

With how successful Invincible has been so far, spinoffs seem inevitable and season 2&#39;s special episode proves one character can carry their own show.




Invincible has proven to be a hit show for Amazon, which could lead to potential spinoffs, and season 2&#39;s special episode has already indicated one character can carry a spinoff show. The second season of Invincible is currently on a midseason break, but after such a long wait between seasons, the show looks determined to deliver more content. Robert Kirkman announced the wait for Invincible season 3&#39;s release will be far shorter than the previous gap between seasons. In addition, the series also released a special episode during the build-up to season 2, giving fans more Invincible.




Although season 2 provided a very strong start, Invincible&#39;s midseason break has arguably been too long with no official return date announced. The lack of content may begin to concern viewers, but the announcement of spinoffs would help appease fans. Sometimes, spinoff shows can be a bad thing, especially for a show like Invincible which has only produced 13 episodes. However, there are plenty of Invincible characters that deserve a spinoff and with how big the show&#39;s universe is, there are almost endless options. While there are several candidates, one character has already proved they could easily carry a spinoff.


 Invincible Season 2&#39;s Atom Eve Special Proves She Can Carry Her Own Spinoff Show 
         

Atom Eve&#39;s Invincible special ahead of season 2 is proof she can carry her own show. Invincible: Atom Eve focused on the character&#39;s origin story by exploring how she got her powers, how it changed her relationships, and outlining the difficulties of becoming a hero. The episode was just under an hour, making it the longest in the series so far, and this sort of dedication to the character shows how valuable she is to the franchise. Developing Atom Eve&#39;s story through this special was the perfect way to give extra context that the show couldn&#39;t provide otherwise.




Invincible has already teased a potential Allen the Alien spinoff through his extensive screen time in season 2, episode 3. However, Atom Eve&#39;s special highlighted that she could demand the audience&#39;s attention for nearly a full hour. No other character has been given this level of trust outside the protagonist, Mark Grayson. Invincible: Atom Eve received positive reviews and was a great experiment to see how fans would react to another character leading an episode. With her more emotional and intriguing story, Atom Eve is the right choice for a proper spinoff since she has plenty of stories to tell.



Invincible season 2 is set to return to Amazon Prime Video in early 2024.






 The Invincible Comics Make An Atom Eve Spinoff Unlikely 
          




An Atom Eve spinoff may be a fun idea, but it is far less likely due to the comics. She is a major character in the show, being a member of Teen Team before branching off to become an independent hero. Throughout season 2, she has had a solo arc that has been distant from most other characters. However, if the show continues following the comics, Atom Eve&#39;s future story will be heavily intertwined with Mark&#39;s, making a spinoff more difficult. Although they are only friends in the series, Mark and Eve grow a much deeper connection in the comics.

Mark and Atom Eve get together in the Invincible comics, forming a relationship, and they even go on to have a child. It may be a while before their relationship blossoms on the TV show, but it seems likely the two will eventually fall for one other. This would make Eve a much more significant part of the series despite her already pivotal role, but it would also make a spinoff unlikely. Being with Mark would give Eve a central story and make a spinoff unnecessary, yet there is still one way Invincible could make an Atom Eve show work.




                  Invincible Cleverly Hinted At The Atom Eve Special Before Season 2 Even Started   Invincible masterfully hid the Atom Eve special through one of its old teasers that, even now, could be pretty easy to miss on a rewatch.   



 There Is 1 Way An Atom Eve Series Could Work (&amp; Season 2 Set It Up) 
          

Season 2 has already set up the one way an Atom Eve series could still work while following the comics. Invincible&#39;s multiverse was introduced in the second season and revealed that there are different versions of the main characters. While it was already clear there were numerous planets and other species in Invincible&#39;s TV series, the fact that there are other dimensions makes Eve&#39;s spinoff possible. Invincible season 2&#39;s multiverse changes the show&#39;s dynamic by introducing an evil Mark Grayson who sides with Omni-Man. While this sets up the season&#39;s villain, it also introduces another version of Atom Eve.




The Eve shown in one of the series&#39; other dimensions has a much more dark and tragic fate as the evil version of Mark paralyzes his dimension&#39;s Atom Eve in Invincible season 2. Although this sinister moment is used to set up more bleak timelines, it proves an Atom Eve spinoff could still be interesting and offer something different from the main show. Whether a spinoff opted to focus on that version of Eve&#39;s story before Mark&#39;s betrayal or followed another version of the character completely, Invincible does still have ways they could make an Atom Eve spinoff show work.
