## Literature Review
Ahsoka Tano actress Rosario Dawson has revealed the true meaning behind Ahsoka&#39;s transformation into Ahsoka the White, as seen in the Ahsoka series.




Rosario Dawson has confirmed that in Star Wars&#39; Disney&#43; TV show Ahsoka, Anakin Skywalker&#39;s former Padawan Ahsoka Tano completes her journey to become Ahsoka the White, a true Jedi, through Anakin&#39;s final lesson and training in the World Between Worlds. Ahsoka was introduced as Anakin&#39;s Padawan in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie, and her character arc continued in The Clone Wars series; however, in season 5, Ahsoka leaves the Jedi Order after being falsely accused of a crime she didn&#39;t commit, rejecting the path of a Jedi.




After Anakin falls to the dark side and becomes Darth Vader, helping to obliterate the Jedi Order under Order 66, Ahsoka goes into hiding, as Master Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi do. Although she continues to use the Force and lightsabers, when she re-emerges in the animated TV show Star Wars Rebels, she is adamant that she is not a Jedi. She affirms this in Ahsoka until Anakin appears in the World Between Worlds to teach her one last lesson, but what exactly that lesson has wrought for Ahsoka remains a mystery - until now.

                  Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know   Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project.    


 Lucasfilm Insisted Ahsoka Still Wasn&#39;t A Jedi In The Mandalorian Era - Yet 
          




Even after Rebels, Ahsoka is decidedly not a Jedi. In both The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett, although she ferries Grogu on his way to Luke Skywalker and clearly remains Jedi-adjacent, she herself is not a part of Luke&#39;s Jedi Temple, and she continues to drift in and out of these stories. With the Jedi Order being gone and her former master being long dead, it seemed that Ahsoka&#39;s training was unlikely to be completed, and it wasn&#39;t clear whether she was even open to that. She seemed wary of Grogu and his attachments in The Mandalorian, for example, and that same hesitancy likely persisted with all Jedi.



 Ahsoka&#39;s Transformation Is Her &#34;Graduation&#34; 
         

Despite that past and likely hesitancy, Ahsoka does complete her Jedi training in Ahsoka when she enters the World Between Worlds and engages with her former master, Anakin Skywalker. During this trial, she is confronted with her past during the Clone Wars and the difficult truth that Anakin Skywalker did effectively &#39;die,&#39; becoming Darth Vader, a Sith, and turning to the dark side. Her trial requires that she learns Anakin&#39;s final lesson: live or die. Ahsoka had been navigating her life without the passion and optimism she exhibited throughout The Clone Wars; at the beginning of Ahsoka, she seems lifeless and discouraged.




Rosario Dawson, who plays live-action Ahsoka, confirmed that by the end of her time in the World Between Worlds, Ahsoka has &#39;graduated,&#39; finally becoming a true Jedi, completing her training, and becoming Ahsoka the White. With this change, Ahsoka has overcome some of her most difficult obstacles, both in terms of being a Jedi and in terms of her larger character arc. She no longer harbors guilt over leaving the Jedi Order, which she believed contributed to Anakin&#39;s fall to the dark side, and she has come to accept the events that transpired. As Ahsoka&#39;s story continues to unfold, she will embrace her future as Ahsoka the White.



Ahsoka&#39;s transformation is heavily inspired by Gandalf the Grey&#39;s, as they both transform into their most freeing and powerful forms after surviving certain death.






 Ahsoka Has Finally Dealt With Her Past, &amp; Is Ready To Be A True Jedi Knight 
          




Throughout Rebels, The Mandalorian, and The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, although a brilliant warrior, compassionate friend, and powerful Force-user, was truly not ready to be a Jedi. She represented many of the qualities of a Jedi, including being a peacekeeper, particularly in her exploits in the Ahsoka novel, and she fought valiantly alongside the Rebels to overthrow the Empire, but her baggage from the Clone Wars left her unprepared for this transition. In particular, she remained deeply affected by Anakin&#39;s turn to the dark side, and she needed closure, in addition to the formal completion of her Padawan training, to be ready.

Now that Ahsoka is a true Jedi, her story will become that much more exciting in upcoming Star Wars projects. Although Ahsoka season 2 is rumored and not yet confirmed, the end of the Ahsoka season 1 finale certainly seemed to signal that additional seasons are coming, perhaps with Hayden Christensen once again reprising his role as Anakin Skywalker. In addition, the upcoming Mandalorian movie opens up the opportunity for Ahsoka the White to return. Given this meaningful, significant turn in her characterization, her Jedi story as started in Ahsoka should be fleshed out and continued, particularly since Star Wars has yet to confirm how her story ends.
