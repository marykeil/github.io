Disney&#43; boasts an impressive list of shows, augmenting its emphasis on Marvel and Star Wars, and this includes network favorites from the past. Disney&#43; subscribers can watch a number of both new and classic live-action shows, 1990s Saturday morning cartoons, and more. Here are some of the best TV shows on Disney&#43;.

 Best Animated Series On Disney&#43; 
The Simpsons (1989 - Present)


 







 The Simpsons 

 Release Date   December 17, 1989    Cast   Tress MacNeille , Julie Kavner , Harry Shearer , Pamela Hayden , Nancy Cartwright , Hank Azaria , Dan Castellaneta , Yeardley Smith    Genres   Animation , Comedy    Seasons   35    




Thanks to the widely publicized Fox-Disney deal, Disney&#43; has access to the longest-running American sitcom ever: The Simpsons, which has over 30 seasons available to stream on the platform. The legendary series got its start as part of The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, and it has since become one of the longest-running primetime scripted shows in television history.
It is perhaps the most well-known of the best Disney&#43; TV shows, with over 700 Simpsons episodes streaming for fans to watch from the beginning, or simply to revisit the show&#39;s many highlights. The Simpsons season 34 arrived on the platform in 2023, making 2024 the perfect time and Disney&#43; the perfect streaming service for returning fans of the show to catch up on what&#39;s been happening most recently in Springfield.

Gravity Falls (2012 - 2016)
        

 Gravity Falls 

 Release Date   June 15, 2012    Cast   Jason Ritter , Kristen Schaal    Genres   Animation , Comedy    Seasons   2    




Premiering on Disney Channel in 2012, Gravity Falls told the story of twins dropped off in the titular Oregonian town for summer vacation. Once there with their great uncle, Stan, they realize there is more to Gravity Falls, and plenty of nightmare fuel, than anyone could have expected.
Expertly blending mystery and comedy, Gravity Falls lasted for two seasons and 40 episodes, finishing up its run on Disney XD before getting added to Disney&#43; for new fans to discover. Both seasons of the show have a 100% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, highlighting its quality. While Gravity Falls ending after season 2 caused chagrin among some viewers, the dual chapters of this charming animated show wrapping up neatly also make it perfect for binge-watching.

The Owl House (2020-2023)
        

Such was the sense of anticipation around The Owl House when it debuted on The Disney Channel in 2020 that it was renewed for a second season before the first even arrived. While only lasted for three seasons before ending, the show remains a great example of what the best Disney&#43; animated shows can accomplish.
Promoting inclusivity, The Owl House features a cast full of strong characters, including an LGBTQ&#43; couple in the lead roles. The show focuses on a teenage girl who finds a portal to the Demon Realm, where she befriends the Owl Lady and sets out to become a witch in her own right. It won the Peabody Award for Children&#39;s &amp; Youth Programming, emphasizing its quality storytelling as well as positive message.

 Best Marvel Series On Disney&#43; 
Marvel Studio&#39;s What If...? (2021-Present)
        

 What If...? 

 Release Date   August 11, 2021    Cast   Samuel L. Jackson , Stanley Tucci , Michael Douglas , Sean Gunn , Mark Ruffalo , Karen Gillan , Tom Hiddleston , Jeffrey Wright , Michael B. Jordan , Toby Jones , Sebastian Stan , Paul Rudd , David Dastmalchian , Natalie Portman , Josh Brolin , Dominic Cooper , Jeff Goldblum , Hayley Atwell , Djimon Hounsou , Chadwick Boseman , Taika Waititi , Chris Hemsworth , Neil McDonaugh , Jeremy Renner , Michael Rooker    Genres   Superhero , Animation , Action , Adventure    Seasons   2    




Though MCU fatigue may have set in, What If...? is always a fun show for any Marvel fan. The animated anthology series centers on the Watcher (Jeffrey Wright), an omnipotent being who sees everything that happens across Marvel&#39;s multiverse. He narrates the show, which explores how major events in the MCU played out differently through various universes.
Each episode poses fun questions like, &#34;What If... Doctor Strange Lost His Heart Instead of His Hands?&#34; and &#34;What If... Thor Were An Only Child?&#34;. As the cinematic franchise gets more and more confusing, What If...? is a fun diversion where fans can still spend time with their favorite superheroes. Season 2 of What It...? arrived in stages throughout December 2023, making January 2024 the perfect time to catch up with one of the best Marvel TV shows on Disney&#43;.

She-Hulk: Attorney At Law (2022 - Present)


 







  She-Hulk: Attorney at Law 

 Release Date   August 17, 2022    Cast   Ginger Gonzaga , Jon Bass , Josh Segarra , Tatiana Maslany , Tim Roth , Renee Elise Goldsberry , Anais Almonte , Mark Ruffalo , Benedict Wong , Jameela Jamil    Genres   Comedy , Action , Adventure    Seasons   1    




Pushing boundaries in terms of both form and content, She-Hulk brings something refreshingly new to the slate of MCU offerings on Disney&#43;. For one thing, it has a significantly more comedic tone and demonstrates what happens to a character who doesn’t necessarily want to live the Avenger life. Tatiana Maslany stars as the titular character, whose desire to do her job is in direct conflict with the condition passed to her by her cousin Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). The show&#39;s regular fourth-wall breaks, colorful cast of characters, and infectious humor all help it stand apart from some of its more straight-laced superhero peers.
            
 
 She-Hulk Ending Explained (In Detail) 
She-Hulk’s season finale ended the show in a completely unique, over-the-top, meta way that makes it different from every Disney&#43; finale of the past.

Ms. Marvel (2022 - Present)
        

 Ms. Marvel 

 Release Date   June 8, 2022    Cast   Matt Lintz , Laith Naki , Rish Shah , Nimra Bucha , Iman Vellani , Yasmeen Fletcher , Saagar Shaikh , Travina Springer , Zenobia Shroff , Mohan Kapur , Aramis Knight , Azher Usman    Genres   Adventure , Comedy , Action    Seasons   1    




Ms. Marvel was one of the most anticipated new series on Disney&#43; before it premiered in 2022. The series, adapted from the comic book series of the same name, follows Kamala Khan, a huge superhero fan and young Pakistani woman growing up in New Jersey, as she discovers she has superpowers. Ms. Marvel blends a somewhat typical superhero origin story with often-ignored storylines about growing up as a child of immigrants in modern America. The series is the winner of a 2022 Golden Tomato from Rotten Tomatoes for Best Superhero Series, beating out many more established shows that were eligible.

WandaVision (2021)


 







 WandaVision 

 Release Date   January 15, 2021    Cast   Paul Bettany , Elizabeth Olsen , Kathryn Hahn , Teyonah Parris , Randall Park , Kat Dennings , Debra Jo Rupp , Evan Peters    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Action , Superhero    Seasons   1    




After a decade of dominance at the box office, the MCU could have easily played it safe with its Disney&#43; shows. However, it created the template for a more daring and innovative television offering with WandaVision, and the approach has paid off in spades. The first episodes paid homage to a different era of sitcoms while telling the Scarlet Witch&#39;s story after she resurrected her husband Vision and became a mother.
It was quirky, cryptic, and set the stage for the next era of the MCU. This bold storytelling continued in shows like Werewolf by Night and She-Hulk, two of the best MCU releases of 2022, yet it wouldn&#39;t have been possible without WandaVision&#39;s success.
            
 
 WandaVision Ending Explained: Biggest Reveals &amp; MCU Future Setup 
The long-awaited WandaVision finale delivers huge reveals and plenty of future MCU setup. Here&#39;s everything that happens in the dramatic ending.




Watch On Disney&#43;
Loki (2021-)
        

 Loki 

 Release Date   June 11, 2021    Cast   Tom Hiddleston , Richard E. Grant , Erika Coleman , Gugu Mbatha-Raw , Sophia Di Martino , Owen Wilson , Wunmi Mosaku , Sasha Lane    Genres   Adventure , Action , Fantasy , Superhero    Seasons   2    




It&#39;s telling that, despite being predated by hits like WandaVision and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, it was Loki that really kick-started the Disney&#43; post-Endgame MCU. Establishing the lore around the Multiverse, the series follows a variant of the original antihero, breaking off from the timeline when he stole an Infinity Stone.
The series went on to introduce the world to the man who ended up known as Kang — the next big bad of the entire MCU. While not as critically acclaimed as the 2022 series Ms. Marvel (98% on Rotten Tomatoes compared to Loki&#39;s 92%), it remains one of the most important shows to watch when following the franchise and one of the most enjoyable shows on Disney&#43; to date. Loki season 2 also arrived last year, so January 2024 is one of the best times for Disney&#43; subscribers who haven&#39;t yet seen the Marvel show to jump on board.
Watch On Disney&#43;
Jessica Jones (2015 - 2019)
        

 Marvel&#39;s Jessica Jones 

 Release Date   November 20, 2015    Cast   Krysten Ritter , David Tennant , Mike Colter , Rachael Taylor , wil traval , Erin Moriarty , Eka Darville , Carrie-Anne Moss , J.R. Ramirez , Terry Chen , Leah Gibson , Janet McTeer , Benjamin Walker , Sarita Choudhury , Jeremy Bobb    Genres   Superhero , Crime    Seasons   3    




Originally produced as part of Netflix’s Marvel slate, Jessica Jones moved over to Disney&#43; after Marvel’s contracts with Netflix expired. The series examines exactly what happens to someone with superpowers when trauma and circumstance prevent them from being the superhero others might expect them to be.
Jessica is rough around the edges, a hard drinker, and someone who doesn’t have time for the petty squabbles of other people. Haunted by her history with David Tennant&#39;s ghoulish Killgrave, Jones is one of Marvel&#39;s most compelling heroes, and the show as a whole one of its most emotionally engaging and complex offerings.

X-Men: The Animated Series (1992 - 1997)
        

X-Men: The Animated Series is easily one of the most influential superhero cartoons ever made and easily ranks among the best Disney&#43; shows in any genre. Lauded to this day, the series is largely what drove the popularity of Marvel&#39;s Merry Mutants in the 1990s, and its take on characters like Cyclops, Rogue, Gambit, Rogue, and Wolverine had a huge impact on how these comic book heroes are remembered today. X-Men had everything that a show of its kind needed: likable characters, tension, humor, and a heavy dose of action. The show maintains a massive fanbase and the MCU is rebooting it on Disney&#43; with the new title, X-Men &#39;97.

 Best Kids&#39; Series On Disney&#43; 
Bluey (2018 - Present)
        

 Bluey 

 Release Date   September 30, 2018    Cast   David McCormack , Melanie Zanetti , Ninthe van Schie , Brad Elliott , Myf Warhurst , Meg Washington , Dan Brumm    Genres   Family , Animation    Network   ABC    




The breakout star of recent pre-school programming, Bluey is a smash-hit Australian series beloved by parents and kids around the world. Following the titular puppy Bluey, the show delivers valuable life lessons about acceptance and curiosity in an energetic and heartwarming way. Bluey has won a string of awards for its writing and accurate representation of family life – albeit through the lens of an anthropomorphic dog family. With three seasons available on Disney&#43;, it&#39;s a great introduction to the exciting and imaginative possibilities of TV.

Hannah Montana (2006 - 2011)
        

A family sitcom and a musical series about growing up, Hannah Montana gives the audience the “best of both worlds”, as its theme song suggests. The series became part of the cultural zeitgeist and catapulted star Miley Cyrus to international fame. Hannah Montana manages to combine the typical family sitcom storylines about growing up with the very real pressures of growing up in front of the entire world as a pop star. Every season of its run received an Outstanding Children’s Program nomination from the Primetime Emmy Awards, and Disney released a theatrical movie for the series before its final season aired.
Watch On Disney&#43;
Wizards Of Waverly Place (2007 - 2012)
        

Wizards Of Waverly Place follows the somewhat typical Disney Channel blueprint of rebellious kids engaging in adventures away from the watchful eyes of their parents. The primary point of difference is that the three kids are training to be the family wizard. Not only did the series prove popular enough to get its own Disney Channel original movie, but it also earned two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children&#39;s Program for two of its seasons. Selena Gomez and the series were also consistently nominated for NAACP Awards during the run of the show for its highlighting of Latin American culture alongside the fictional wizard lore.

That’s So Raven (2003 - 2007)
        

 that&#39;s so raven 

 Release Date   January 17, 2003    Cast   Raven-Symone , Kyle Massey    Genres   Sitcom    Seasons   4    




 Family drama, teenage hijinks, and psychic phenomena combine to create the uniquely chaotic That’s So Raven. Protagonist Raven discovers she has psychic visions as a teenager, and though she tries to use them to her advantage, she almost always interprets them incorrectly. The series was the first Disney Channel original show to make it to 100 episodes, and earned both a spinoff (Cory in the House) and a revival series (Raven’s Home). That’s So Raven was twice nominated for the Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Children&#39;s Program and won several NAACP Image awards.

Lizzie McGuire (2001 - 2004)
        

 Lizzie McGuire 

 Release Date   January 12, 2001    Cast   Hilary Duff , Lalaine , jake thomas , Hallie Todd , Robert Carradine    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   1    




 The family sitcom that made Hilary Duff a star, Lizzie McGuire broke ground for the Disney Channel in a number of small but significant ways. Storylines like Lizzie wanting her mom to help her buy her first bra provided a realistic depiction of teenage girlhood in the early 2000s, while the use of a cartoon Lizzie proved the show wasn&#39;t beyond using innovative storytelling devices.
The show got a big-screen movie release and almost took the cast to high school before contract negotiations fell through. A revival series was planned for Hulu as well before creative differences saw streaming executives put the project on hold – much to the disappointment of fans.

 Best Star Wars Series On Disney&#43; 
Ahsoka (2023 - Present)
        

 Ahsoka 

 Release Date   August 23, 2023    Cast   Rosario Dawson , Natasha Liu Bordizzo , Hayden Christensen , Eman Esfandi , Ivanna Sakhno , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Ray Stevenson , Genevieve O&#39;Reilly , Lars Mikkelsen , Diana Lee Inosanto    Genres   Action , Drama ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   1    




 Serving as a continuation of the acclaimed animated series Star Wars Rebels, Ahsoka finally brings one of the franchise&#39;s most popular small-screen characters to the fore. Set after Ezra Bridger&#39;s heroic sacrifice in the Rebels finale, Ahsoka sees the titular Jedi fighting against a new threat to the galaxy in the aftermath of the Empire&#39;s defeat. With several characters reprising their Rebels roles, audiences could be forgiven for assuming that Ahsoka is a misguided attempt to recapture the earlier series&#39; magic. However, with a gripping story of its own and fascinating additions to Star Wars lore, Ahsoka is already a worthy addition to the franchise early in its first season.

The Mandalorian (2019 - Present)


 







 The Mandalorian 

 Release Date   November 12, 2019    Cast   Werner Herzog , Emily Swallow , Pedro Pascal , Nick Nolte , Omid Abtahi , Gina Carano , Carl Weathers , Giancarlo Esposito    Genres   Fantasy ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   3    




 For a long time seen as one of the best Disney&#43; TV shows in any genre, The Mandalorian represents a radical and welcome addition to Star Wars canon. Starring Pedro Pascal as an armored bounty hunter, the ongoing series cleverly expanded Star Wars&#39; famously fraught universe, expertly blending new and existing characters in an understated and celebrated narrative.
Tonally closer to a Western than some of the saga&#39;s more bombastic entries, The Mandalorian is a perfect blend between spectacle and story, with iconic moments like Luke Skywalker&#39;s return and Grogu&#39;s infinitely memeable &#34;Baby Yoda&#34; persona cementing it in franchise folklore.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 - 2020)
        

 Star Wars: The Clone Wars 

 Release Date   October 3, 2008    Cast   Matt Lanter , james arnold taylor , Ashley Eckstein , Dee Bradley Baker , Matthew Wood , Tom Kane , Catherine Taber , Terrence Carson , Corey Burton , Nika Futterman , Katee Sackhoff , Sam Witwer    Genres   Animation ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   7    




 Originally designed to fill in the gap between Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Cartoon Network&#39;s Star Wars: The Clone Wars is now regarded as one of the best arcs in the entire Star Wars story. The series, which used a unique 3D animation style, allowed viewers to get to know the various members of the Jedi Order, including characters who didn&#39;t receive much screen time in the prequels.
Through five seasons on Cartoon Network, The Clone Wars featured top-notch storytelling, and its additions to the Star Wars lore are still recognized today in other installments. In 2020, Disney&#43; became the exclusive home of a brand-new season of The Clone Wars, which upped the budget and made for a suitably epic finale.

Andor (2022 - Present)


 







 Andor 

 Release Date   September 21, 2022    Cast   Genevieve O&#39;Reilly , Adria Arjona , Diego Luna , Kyle Soller , Alan Tudyk , Stellan Skarsgård , Denise Gough , Forrest Whittaker    Genres   Adventure , Drama , Action ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   1    




 Unlike anything else in the wider franchise, Andor is living proof that all the lightsaber duels and pod races are no substitute for exceptional storytelling. Starring Diego Luna, reprising his role from the much-lauded Rogue One, Andor is a tense, deliberately-paced political thriller that explores the consequences and course of rebellion from the upper echelons of politics to violent insurrection on the street. After years of sub-par, seemingly unnecessary additions to the larger Star Wars story, Andor served as a welcome reminder that it&#39;s still more than worthwhile exploring a galaxy far, far away.

Star Wars Rebels (2014-2018)
        

 Star Wars Rebels 

 Cast   David Oyelowo , Steve Blum , Freddie Prinze Jr. , Tiya Sircar , Vanessa Marshall , Jason Isaacs , Taylor Gray    Genres   Animation , Adventure , Action    Seasons   4    




 Although somewhat overshadowed by the popularity of The Clone Wars upon release, Star Wars Rebels has cemented itself as one of the most important and most entertaining installments in the entire Star Wars canon. Following the rebellious crew of the Ghost, the show chronicles some of the first serious acts of resistance against the fascistic Empire. With a lovable cast, crucial additions to Star Wars lore, and one of the most dastardly villains in the whole franchise, Rebels proved more than a match for The Clone Wars – even surpassing the saga&#39;s other animated property in the eyes of many viewers.

 Best Comedy Series On Disney&#43; 
Goosebumps (2023)


 







 Goosebumps (2023) 

 Release Date   October 13, 2023    Cast   Justin Long , Ana Yi Puig , Miles McKenna , Will Price , Zack Morris , Isa Briones , Rachael Harris , Rob Huebel    Genres   Comedy , Horror    Seasons   1    




 R.L. Stine&#39;s Goosebumps was a popular series of horror novels for children, and it&#39;s proven to be a bountiful well for movie and TV adaptations, with a Goosebumps TV series in the &#39;90s and two Hollywood films starring Jack Black in the 2010s. Now, Goosebumps is coming to streaming with another TV series.
Unlike the original show that premiered in 1995, the rebooted Goosebumps for Disney&#43; is not an anthology. It&#39;s a serialized story that follows five high school students who investigate a 30-year-old murder of a local teen while uncovering secrets about their own parents along the way. Though it&#39;s billed as a comedy, the 2023 Goosebumps series looks to lean into the horror a little more than the movies. However, there are plenty of Gen-Z quips to be had, so Goosebumps may be the perfect show for younger viewers to watch with their older siblings, or even parents, who have already read the books.

Black-ish (2014 - 2022)


 







 Black-ish 

 Release Date   September 24, 2014    Cast   Anthony Anderson , Marsai Martin    Genres   Sitcom    Seasons   8    




 Though it often follows a typical sitcom blueprint, Black-ish stands apart for showcasing storylines that are unique to the Black American experience. Anderson’s Dre starts off the series wanting his family to assimilate less into White suburban society and embrace their ethnic roots, and the series both maintains that narrative while highlighting representation throughout.
It also explores dramatic subjects like deaths, postpartum depression, and more, expertly balancing comedy with drama. Over the course of its run, Black-ish earned more than two dozen Primetime Emmy nominations and more than 50 NAACP Award nominations, highlighting its importance.

 Originally a cornerstone of ABC&#39;s successful TGIF programming block, Boy Meets World remains a highly influential and affecting comedy. The show follows main character Cory and his family as he navigates the transition from his teenage years to adulthood. The series was a ratings success through all seven seasons, and the move to Disney&#43; is welcome news both for old fans and new audiences. Boy Meets World was also a contemporary critical success, with the cast receiving several Young Artist Awards. There was even a spin-off that arrived 14 years after the show ended called Girl Meets World, which had Cory and Topanga as parents.

Created by visionary Jim Henson, The Muppet Show is an endlessly inventive musical extravaganza. Led by the iconic Kermit the Frog, Henson&#39;s hilarious and heartfelt show saw a wealth of human celebrities like Mark Hamill and Steve Martin interact with the eccentric puppets. With memorable members like Fozzie Bear and Miss Piggy, the show was a success and led to several movies. Not only did Disney&#43; provide a home for the original The Muppets, but it also rebooted the franchise with Muppets Now in 2020.

One of the best series available on Disney&#43; right now began in December 2023 — Disney&#39;s second adaptation of the acclaimed Percy Jackson novels by Rick Riordan. After a less-than-stellar attempt at bringing the characters to life in a series of movies in 2010 and 2013, Disney has rebooted Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians again in 2023 but this time as a TV show. The series is ongoing throughout January and has already received solidly positive reviews, with the adaptation&#39;s faithfulness to the source material compared to the movies being especially noteworthy.

 Based on the graphic novel by Gene Luen Yang, American Born Chinese brings Chinese gods into the modern day, exploring often-ignored aspects of Chinese mythology in the process. The story follows Jin Wang as he seeks to improve his social status in high school, but finds his attempts halted by a new student. The new student is actually the son of someone Jin believed was only a myth - the Monkey King.
When the two team up, Jin has to suddenly deal with ancient gods in his life as well as the trials of high school. American Born Chinese has been hailed by critics as one of the best new TV shows on Disney&#43;, exploring themes of identity and acceptance alongside some great martial arts sequences.

 Inspired by and set in the same universe as the hit movie Love, Simon, Love, Victor is another acclaimed Hulu series that has made its way to Disney&#43;. Starring Michael Cimino as the titular character, the teen drama tackles the trials of tribulations of teenage love, mixing often hilarious comedy with the melodramatic tragedy that often defines early relationships. Also offering a nuanced discussion of sexuality, Love, Victor was a smash critical hit on release. The second season earned a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, giving Disney&#43; yet another can&#39;t-miss show.

Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials &amp; Doctor Who Holiday Special: The Church On Ruby Road (2023)
        

 Doctor Who 

 Release Date   November 23, 1963    Cast   Jenna Coleman , Jodie Whittaker , Alex Kingston , David Tennant , Matt Smith , Peter Capaldi    Genres   Adventure , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi    




 Doctor Who first premiered on November 23, 1963, and in 2023, the iconic BBC sci-fi show celebrates its 60th anniversary with three specials — The Star Beast, Wild Blue Yonder, and The Giggle — available to watch internationally on Disney&#43;. The specials see Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant making his debut as the Fourteenth Doctor, and in The Star Beast, he&#39;s reunited with Catherine Tate, who reprises her role as companion Donna Noble. Wild Blue Yonder sees the Fourteenth Doctor and Donna adventuring in the TARDIS to try to save the universe, while The Giggle finds the Doctor facing off against the villainous Toymaker, played by Neil Patrick Harris in his Doctor Who debut.
With its whimsical yet thrilling sense of adventure, there&#39;s a reason why Doctor Who holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-running sci-fi series in the world. While it keeps things fresh by casting different doctors, Doctor Who struck gold with Tennant, and it&#39;s a delight seeing him back.
On Christmas Day, Disney&#43; hosted the first official Doctor Who holiday special since 2017, The Church on Ruby Road. The Christmas special stars Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor in his first full-length episode, and he stars opposite Millie Gibson as his companion, Ruby Sunday.

Covering the making of the group&#39;s album Let It Be, the series focuses on the differences and tensions within the group, exploring how conflict and individuality can ultimately lead to great art.
