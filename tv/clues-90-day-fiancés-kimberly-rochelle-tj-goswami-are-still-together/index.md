## Literature Review
It seems that Kimberly Rochelle and TJ Goswami somehow made their marriage work despite showcasing several quarrels on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way.




Kimberly Rochelle and Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami are likely together after filming 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. The transformation coach and the Indian man had great chemistry initially. They shared matching spiritual beliefs and personality traits that helped them build a relationship despite the red flags. Unfortunately, things drastically changed after they decided to get serious. When Kimberly flew to India to settle with TJ, she discovered that TJ and his family had very different expectations. They wanted her to adapt to Indian culture and follow the traditions after becoming part of the Goswami household.




Kimberly was flabbergasted by the lifestyle change after landing in India. She felt that TJ and his family didn’t love her for who she was and hoped to change her into a new person. Halfway through her journey, the American woman got sick and tired of daily arguments with her beau and his brother. She began contemplating her future and eventually decided to give her relationship a chance and marry TJ. Recently, Kimberly had another major fight with TJ after he told her to go back to the United States.

 Kimberly Wears A Traditional Indian Anklet On Thanksgiving 

 

There is some suggestion that Kimberly and TJ split up after marriage since they aren’t geographically together. However, they’ve shared some clues on social media that hint their relationship is still going strong. Recently, Kimberly posted a video celebrating an unconventional Thanksgiving. She wore Indian makeup and a traditional anklet on the occasion. If the American reality star had broken up with TJ, she would’ve probably left Indian culture in her past. However, the fact that she tried to incorporate some of TJ’s culture into the American holiday hints that her relationship is still intact.

 Kimberly Keeps Sharing Happy Moments With TJ 

 

Kimberly and TJ had their differences in the past. Their on-screen compatibility declined aggressively over the episodes, making it look like they weren’t a good fit. However, the couple is very compatible, and this shows from their social media posts. Over the weeks, Kimberly has shared some of her warmest moments with her husband on social media. She has talked about him positively and expressed her feelings for him. In October, Kimberly posted nearly a dozen photos of her husband. She wrote, “when he asks you to take a picture of him.”

Kimberly has also been sharing behind-the-scenes stories with 90 Day Fiancé fans and opening up more. She has been discussing moments not captured by the cameras and her real feelings about her relationship with TJ. In early November 2023, the Alabama native talked about her allergy during one of the Indian customs. She revealed that she wasn’t comfortable wearing gold jewelry but decided to “roll with it” because the special day wasn’t just about herself. She added, “your wedding, after all, isn’t just about you, it’s about everyone else too.”

 Kimberly Responds To Comments About TJ 
         

Most 90 Day Fiancé franchise cast members who split up after marriage humiliate their ex-partners on social media. One example is Chantel Everett, who has been calling out Pedro Jimeno since he asked her for divorce in 2022. In comparison, Kimberly has responded to fan comments and expressed her love for her Indian husband. If she had ended her relationship with TJ, she would’ve simply ignored fans’ concerns or taken a shot at him. However, despite their on-screen differences, she has only been saying nice things about him and acting like she still cares for him.

During the Halloween season, Kimberly posted pictures of TJ on her Instagram profile, where her followers complimented her relationship. A social media user wrote, “you guys are a good match,” stating the couple is excellently compatible. Another follower commented, “he has a contagious smile.” Kimberly responded to her followers by thanking them. She added, “awe, thank you so much,” implying that she’s still with TJ. If she had ended her marriage with the Indian man, she wouldn’t have acknowledged any positive comment. Instead, she would probably have never posted about TJ in the first place.






 Kimberly Dismisses New Dating Rumors 
         

Kimberly and TJ have been part of various rumors over the months. One of their latest rumors emerged in mid-November 2023 when Kimberly posted a photo from the airport. She captioned it, “I am commmiiinnnngggg toooo youuuuuu,” hinting that she was flying to someone special. As expected, fans assumed the worst and asked her if she was dating someone new. A social media user even wrote, “I heard that you were in a relationship with someone.” However, Kimberly didn’t let the rumors spread any further. She replied to the curious fan and said, “no.”

Kimberly didn’t have the best time during her wedding with TJ. Apart from tricky customs and traditions, she had to deal with mental exhaustion that took a toll on her mood. To make matters worse, she suffered from stomach issues right before her big day. She soiled her pants in the morning, completely ruining her mood for the day. During the wedding episode, Kimberly was visibly sad and uncomfortable. However, she has since softened up about it. She still has her wedding pictures on social media and claims she went home with a smile.

Like Kimberly, TJ also enjoyed his wedding day. He has pictures of various cultural and traditional ceremonies on social media, where he looks really happy. TJ’s top three pinned posts on Instagram are his wedding photos with Kimberly. One of the photos is from the Haldi ceremony, where loved ones cover a bride and groom in turmeric. Another picture is from the couple’s Roka, a tradition akin to engagement. On Instagram, TJ also has his wedding portrait with his 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way co-star, Kimberly.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
