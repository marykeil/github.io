## Literature Review
Netflix has a vast catalog of original and classic anime, with many being perfect for a weekend-long binging spree.




The popular streaming service Netflix has some of the best anime that fans can binge-watch right now. Since the popularity of streaming took off, binge-watching has become the ideal way for most fans to watch a new show. Rather than having to wait for weeks just to watch a new episode, viewers have found it far more convenient to sit down in their own time and watch every episode over a short period of time.
Netflix has become the best place to do this as they ultimately started the trend. By releasing all new episodes at once for the majority of their original programming, this started a movement that changed the face of watching television forever. Anime is no different in this regard. While Netflix has begun following a simulcast method of weekly episodes for certain series, including their must-watch hit A Happy Marriage, their library of anime is so vast that there are plenty of options for fans to binge.









 








 10  Pokémon Concierge Provides a Chill Experience For Beginners 
Estimated Binge Time: 1 Hour and 12 Minutes
        

The latest addition to Netflix&#39;s anime library, Pokémon Concierge was ultimately a cozy way to end the 2023 anime season. Its appealing art style mixed with relaxing themes make it impossible not to binge all four episodes at once, making the series its own little mini-movie. Concierge is also a great gateway show for people wanting to try binge-watching for the first time, since it&#39;s not only short but provides an easy watching experience. The series has been so popular among fans that many have begun calling for more episodes following a disappointingly short episode count that has begun to make waves.

This second attempt at bringing his stories to life in the form of anime, and while the show is an imperfect mixed bag due to it being an anthology, there are so many stories that are adapted here that it&#39;s impossible not to find one that speaks to a viewer. From creepy hanging balloons to headless mannequins, Junji Ito Maniac is the perfect watch for binge-watchers wanting something spooky on their list that improves upon the disappointing Junji Ito Collection anime with better animation and scarier stories.

 6  Death Note is a Must-See Classic 
Estimated Binge Time: 14 Hours and 11 Minutes


 







Despite becoming a series so popular that it has been joked about constantly, Death Note is a remarkable series that every anime fan should see at least once in their lives. The show follows Light Yagami as he comes across a book called the Death Note. He quickly learns from the Shinigami Ryuk that whoever&#39;s name he writes in the book will die of a heart attack unless otherwise specified. This leads to an engaging thriller as Light is playing cat-and-mouse with the authorities as he tries to model the world into his idea of a utopia. Death Note proved immensely popular with fans as it adapted the well-received shonen series of the same name. Even with its intimidatingly large binge time, it&#39;s well worth the time invested.

 4  Aggretsuko Adds Incredible Depth To Adorable Sanrio Characters 
Estimated Binge Time: 14 Hours and 56 Minutes
        

It&#39;s a bit jarring to fans when they realize that Aggretsuko and its focus on real-world adult themes came from the same company that created the Hello Kitty franchise. Yet, it stands tall as one of the best anime Netflix has ever created. This series spotlights Retsuko, a red panda working a 9-5 accounting job that vents her frustrations through her passion for karaoke Death Metal. The adorable designs of Aggretsuko&#39;s characters do a great job pulling audiences in to what could be a fun little comedy, yet the writing stands out with some of the best character work fans will see in an anime. Not every character choice hits, as seen through season 4&#39;s handling of Haida, but regardless, Aggretsuko is a must-watch for anime fans with its five seasons and has one of the best anime Christmas specials ever providing tons of content for their next binge.

 1  Scott Pilgrim Takes Off Defies Expectations 
Estimated Binge Time: 3 Hours and 40 Minutes
        

Rounding things out is a series that no one expected, yet, it delivered something more than profound. Scott Pilgrim Takes Off was hyped up by Netflix as a more faithful adaptation of the books by Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley. However, following a shocking twist at the end of the first episode, it became its own thing that expanded on the lore of the Scott Pilgrim series and explored its side characters more in-depth. It&#39;s something that most fans weren&#39;t expecting when they heard that an anime about Scott Pilgrim was being made, but at the same time, it delivered on so much more that it became something the fanbase needed. At a brisk eight episode runtime, this is a must-watch for bingers that also happen to be fans of Scott Pilgrim, making it one of the best Netflix anime to binge-watch of all time.
