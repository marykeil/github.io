# 10 K-Drama Couples Who Shouldn t Have Ended Up Together


## SUMMARY 


 K-dramas often sell an idealized version of love, but some couples are brought together for the sake of a romantic narrative, even if their relationship dynamics are unrealistic or toxic. 
 Some K-drama couples, such as Geum Jan-di and Goo Jun-pyo in Boys Over Flowers, feel rushed and unearned, with little character development or compatibility. 
 While K-dramas like It&#39;s Okay to Not Be Okay tackle complicated relationships, some couples, like Moon Gang-tae and Ko Moon-Young, have dynamics that aren&#39;t sustainable in the long run and lack the necessary support for their individual needs.

## Literature Review
K-dramas are known for their romances with happy endings. However, just because a couple ended up together doesn&#39;t mean that they should have.




The majority of K-drama couples end up getting together, but some of them shouldn&#39;t have been with each other in the first place. Overall, K-dramas have evolved its storytelling by tackling a wide array of genres. Some are period shows, which tackle Korean history all the way back to the dynasties. Others are fantastical, with elements that deal with magic and other superpowers. Then, there are grounded stories that explore human narratives that are relatable for the much-broader audience. Regardless of the genre that a K-drama falls into, almost all of them have some kind of romantic plot line, with love stories typically becoming the primary appeal of these shows.
Romantic K-dramas tend to sell the idealized version of love. Couples get past socio-economic and personality differences simply because they like each other. Admittedly, this makes for great feel-good watches, which is a big part of why K-dramas have become really popular around the globe in recent years. That being said, sometimes, even couples who don&#39;t have any chance of sustaining a healthy relationship are brought together just for the sake of delivering a romantic narrative. Their dynamics are just too unrealistic to work, or their actual situations are way too difficult to overcome. Regardless, there&#39;s a strong argument that they shouldn&#39;t have ended together.
            
 
 10 Most Chilling &amp; Menacing Villains in K-Drama Thrillers 
There are several great K-drama thrillers, many of which are defined by amazing villains that steal the show every time they’re on screen.













 








 10  Han Ji-eun and Lee Yeong-Jae in Full House 
Song Hye-gyo and Bi


 







Using forced proximity as the catalyst to their love story, Full House features aspiring writer, Han Ji-Eun having to live with South Korean actor, Lee Young Jae, who bought her house after her best friends sold it behind her back. Not having anywhere else to stay in, she agrees to partake in a fake marriage to preserve his public image. The banter between the lead couple is fun to watch, but over time, it just becomes clear that they are simply not meant to be together. Their bickering no longer becomes cute and is downright mean and toxic.
The way Young-jae treats Ji-eun, especially at the start of Full House, is full-on despicable. Not only does he make her a stay-in house help, but he also insults her intellect at every turn. He doesn&#39;t realize that he likes her until she starts to set some boundaries and get closer to another possible romantic interest. Ji-eun and Young-jae are cute, but their relationship is very problematic.





 9  Geum Jan-di and Goo Jun-pyo in Boys Over Flowers 
Goo Hye-sun and Lee Min-ho
        

Based on the Japanese manga series, Hana Yori Dango, South Korea&#39;s Boys Over Flowers is the third live-action adaptation of the story. It has several romantic tropes including rich male, poor female, and enemies to lovers, which help in the narrative&#39;s overall appeal. However, what makes the Taiwanese&#39;s take on the story via Meteor Garden work is that it actually shows the couple&#39;s character development. Meanwhile, Goo Jun-pyo and Geum Jan-di&#39;s story feels rushed and unearned. It&#39;s difficult to imagine that the strong-willed Jan-di is suddenly willing to go to great lengths to be with someone who remains focused on what he wants.





 8  Yoo Na-bi and Park Jae-eon in Nevertheless 
Han So-hee and Park Jae-eon
        

2021&#39;s Nevertheless follows player Park Jae-eon and heartbroken art student Yoo Na-bi as they begin a tumultuous, friends-with-benefits set-up. The no-strings-attached dynamic starts as fun for both parties, but over time, things become complicated once feelings are hurt. Jae-eon continuously, and seemingly even intentionally hurts Na-bi by entertaining other people. This makes it worse when Na-bi chooses to ignore the red flags even though she has just gotten out of another abusive relationship. As a way to deliver a traditional romantic ending, Nevertheless rushes Jae-on&#39;s redemption arc, which Na-bi falls for. However, it&#39;s difficult to believe that their relationship will last.

Korean storytelling has been gaining more prominence and Screen Rant lists down all the quintessential Korean dramas that every fan needs to watch.









 7  Shin Ha-ri and Kang Tae-moo in Business Proposal 
Kim Se-jeong and Ahn Hyo-seop
        

Kang Tae-moo and Shin Ha-rin from Business Proposal have a great meet-cute. While the show is a good watch and the couple have so many great moments together, their circumstances are just too difficult to ensure a long and happy relationship. The class and money differences between both of them are huge, and these could lead to many more misunderstandings moving forward. The excitement of their relationship came from the show&#39;s actual storytelling, but beyond that, there may not be that much of a future for them.





 6  Ko Moon-Young &amp; Moon Gang-Tae in It&#39;s Okay to Not Be Okay 
Seo Yea-ji and Kim Soo-hyun


 







It&#39;s Okay to Not Be Okay tackles a more complicated relationship in the hopes of proving that love can be helpful in one&#39;s healing journey. Caregiver Moon Gang-tae, who has experienced a traumatic childhood experience meets a popular children&#39;s book author with antisocial personality disorder, Ko Moon-Young, and subsequently starts a romance, albeit a rocky one. While they have proven to have intense feelings for each other, their dynamic isn&#39;t sustainable for a long-term relationship. As a show that deals with mental health, It&#39;s Okay to Not Be Okay doesn&#39;t really get the couple the collective and individual help they need to stay together.





 5  Cha Eun-sang and Kim Tan in The Heirs 
Park Sin-hye and Lee Min-ho
        

In The Heirs Kim Tan has a chance meeting with Cha Eun-sang while both are in the United States and the pair falls in love. However, in the typical case of a rich male coupling with a poor female, Kim Tan is forced to choose between his family and their money and his love for Eun-sang. The K-drama was released in 2013 when there was much praise for controlling and manipulative rich boyfriends who mask their toxic traits as love. Kim Tan and Eun-sang end up being together, but she&#39;s only setting herself up for more heartbreak by staying with him.





 4  Eun Tae-hee and Kwon Si-hyeon in Tempted 
Moon Ga-young and Woo Do-hwan
        

Similar to other K-dramas that feature a rich male lead, Tempted&#39;s Kwon Si-hyeon has the hallmark of a spoiled chaebol. He targets Eun Tae-hee, who has grown skeptical of love after witnessing the fall of her parents&#39; marriage. While Si-hyeon&#39;s attempt to make her fall in love with him starts as a game, he eventually falls in love with her. Despite his feelings, however, there&#39;s no significant change in his characteristics that will ensure that Tae-hee will not end up being hurt in their relationship. It&#39;s also doubtful that they can withstand the pressure from his family when they try to separate them.





 3  Kang Mo-yeon and Yoo Si-jin in Descendants of the Sun 
Song Hye-gyo and Song Joong-gi


 







There is no doubt that Kang Mo-yeon and Yoo Si-jin are hopelessly in love with each other in Descendants of the Sun. Amid a lot of trials and tribulations, they have remained steadfast in their commitment to each other. However, Mo-yeon and Si-jin&#39;s problem lies with their respective jobs. Both work in immensely stressful industries, with Si-jin having to regularly risk his life. Regardless of how much they love each other, it isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility that life ultimately catches up with them. Otherwise, they might just end up resenting each other because of their often frustrating circumstance.

Korean dramas tackle a wide variety of topics, and not all of them end with a happy send-off. Some of them wrap up in heartbreaking fashion. 









 2  Jo Yi-seo and Park Sae-ro-yi in Itaewon Class 
Kim Da-mi and Park Seo-joon Itaewon Class, released in 2020, isn&#39;t exactly a romance series, but as with many K-dramas, there&#39;s a love story embedded in its narrative. Despite having a history with Oh Soo-ah, The Marvels star, Park Seo-joon&#39;s Park Sae-ro-yi ends up with Jo Yi-seo — a divisive storytelling decision for a couple of reasons. Primarily, the issue is how one-sided their romance is, with Yi-seo seemingly the only one who is committed to the relationship. Perhaps if the show is able to develop their dynamic further, it will inspire more confidence in the possibility of them. As it is, however, it&#39;s difficult to buy into their love.





 1  Kang Cheol and Oh Yeon-joo in W 
Han Hyo-joo and Lee Jong-sun
        

In W, Kang Cheol and Oh Yeon-joo are faced with a unique set-up, which makes sustaining a long-term relationship more difficult. The super-rich male lead, Kang Cheol exists in the webtoon W and crosses paths with Yeon-Joo, who is a surgeon in the real world. Kang Cheol inhabits the fictional universe that Yeon-Joo&#39;s father, Oh Seong-moo created. Ultimately, Kang Cheol is able to find his way into the real world, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that he and Yeon-joo exist in different K-drama universes.
