## Literature Review
When they aren&#39;t pulling each other for chats, Love Island contestants play games and complete challenges. Here are some of the best.




Love Island has included a variety of challenges over the years, but some are better than others. In each of the franchise&#39;s many iterations, the infamous baby bird relay race never fails to appear in the challenge lineup despite always being ridiculously gross, and the food challenges are also complex to watch. As one of the best reality TV shows, it&#39;s no surprise Love Island UK season 11 will return sooner rather than later.
Barring some recurring challenges, Love Island provides friendly competition in the villa as much as in other scenes in the show. After all, the best challenges will help stir the pot and create even more juicy drama. What are some of the most enjoyable Love Island challenges?









 








 1  Themed Challenges 
Love Island


 







Though not every season features all of the same challenges, viewers can all but guarantee islanders will be asked to participate in a themed obstacle course. Some seasons even do multiple variations of this challenge. For example, Love Island USA season 3 had the Babewatch Challenge and All Lubed Up. The fun of this challenge is seeing the islanders attempt to be sexy while obstacle-coursing. It&#39;s even more fun to see who the islanders choose to plant a wet one on at the end, a choice that can be the equivalent of pieing someone off.





 2  Kissing Booth Challenge 
Love Island


 







With a show like Love Island, viewers are tuning in almost every night to follow along with the budding chemistry between islanders. Challenges like the Kissing Booth Challenge are one way to put that chemistry to the test. Of course, the Kissing Booth Challenge also opens the door for the most chaotic contestants on Love Island to test the waters outside of their current couples. Love Island USA season 3&#39;s Kissing Booth Challenge offered viewers a sneak peek at the Cashay-Trina-Cinco love triangle. It depicted too many slo-mo camera angles of Shannon&#39;s aggressive makeout tactics.





 3  Truth Or Dare 
Love Island


 







Truth or Dare is a classic party game in and out of the villa. Sometimes, the islanders start a game of Truth or Dare without the producers&#39; prompting. In contrast, other seasons of islanders have participated in a couple of rounds as part of a formal challenge. Truth or Dare typically takes place in the earlier episodes and serves as an ice breaker because nothing breaks the ice quite like being dared to make out with other people the islanders have only met.





 4  Rank Bank 
Love Island
        

Rank Bank and its various iterations are more than just an ego booster for the islanders. This challenge deals devastating blows in equal measure as the islanders face to face with how they would rank each other versus how the public ranked them. Any game that includes the public&#39;s opinion is sure to be hilarious, with confessional cutaways quite common as the islanders reflect on how they ranked or, more likely, didn&#39;t rank among their fellow islanders.





 5  Dunk In Love 
Love Island
        

Love Island Australia season 2 dubbed this classic challenge Dunk in Love, while the USA season 3 played it as Mr. &amp; Mrs. Whether this challenge includes gimmicks like water tanks or not, the goal is to uncover what the couples know about their partners. This game can determine which Love Island couples stay together and which break up. While even the strongest couples don&#39;t always earn scores of 100%, viewers enjoy seeing the islanders squirm under the scrutiny of their partners.





 6  Snog, Marry, Pie 
Love Island
        

The funniest moments on Love Island tend to include romantic and non-romantic moments, with the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge dishing out hilarious moments in both camps. This challenge is typically a drama starter, depending on how the pies are thrown and whose feelings are involved. This challenge is unique in that it helps to reveal how the islanders feel about their friends&#39; partners. For example, Love Island USA season 3 saw Cinco and Will face much of the girls&#39; wrath, consequently receiving the most pies to the face.





 7  Hearts On Fire 
Love Island
        

The Love Island producers get a kick out of seeing who can raise the heart rates of the other islanders. They especially enjoy when islanders not in a couple together can excite each other, although this challenge is all in good fun and almost never throws a wrench into the state of the couplings. Variations of this challenge have included strip teases aplenty, which are both fun and awkward to watch. Typically, islanders step out one by one in kitschy costumes and attempt dance moves often above their skill sets.





 8  Raunchy Races 
Love Island
        

Almost every season of Love Island includes the Raunchy Races, a competition between the islanders in the main villa and those in Casa Amor. Nearly every time, an islander or two can be heard asking a fellow islander afterward if they think their partner kissed another person in the opposing villa. While most of the kisses shared between islanders during the Raunchy Races amount to nothing, the competition is the producers&#39; way of exacerbating feelings of insecurity and ill will between those in the villa and those in Casa Amor.





 9  License To Swill 
Love Island
        

Though this challenge has appeared with various names throughout the Love Island franchise, it remains the same: Almost everyone gets a cup of liquid thrown into their face. The rules are simple. An islander reads a quote by someone in the villa. They then throw a liquid glass onto the person they think said the quote. Typically, the most likable contestants on Love Island have nothing to fear since their fellow islanders tend to be sorry about drenching them. On the other hand, the sneakiest, muggiest islanders can count on a faceful and zero remorse from anyone.





 10  The Twitter Challenge 
Love Island
        

Texts islanders never want to receive while in the villa have to include the one that reads, &#34;It&#39;s time to find out what the public really thinks.&#34; This is the Islanders Read Mean Tweets challenge, and it&#39;s always a doozy. Before this challenge, islanders must go with their gut on whether to trust those around them. Sometimes, the islanders trust the wrong people, leading the public to take matters into their own hands and tweet things that rock the villa. Most notably, the mean tweet challenge placed Love Island USA season 2&#39;s Johnny back under the microscope after he misled Cely in his Casa Amor recap.
