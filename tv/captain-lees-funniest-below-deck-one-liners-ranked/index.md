## Literature Review
Captian Lee’s famous one-liners have become a staple on Below Deck. Take a look at some of his best!




Below Deck star Captain Lee Rosbach may be one of the most central figures on the show, but there&#39;s typically more investment in the drama between the lower-level crew than in the Captain. As the yachties take to the seas, the Captain has the more difficult job of keeping the yacht on course while ensuring the guests are happy and the crew is working diligently. Though Captain Lee has a job that he takes incredibly seriously, there is typically humor in how he speaks to his crew. As Captain Lee isn&#39;t returning for Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to revisit his best one-liners.
As captain of a superyacht, the ability to be available to both guests and crew is imperative. Over the years, Lee has talked about some health struggles he’s been dealing with that make it difficult for him to physically continue his job. In 2023, Captain Lee announced he’d be leaving Below Deck. Captain Lee will take his leave as the crew continues its journey with the St. David. Despite not appearing as a Below Deck season 11 cast member, his best lines will live in Bravo reruns.









 








 1  “We screwed the pooch so many times we should have a litter of puppies running around.” 
Below Deck Season 3


 







One of Captain Lee’s most famous phrases, “We screwed the pooch,” has taken on many iterations throughout the show. This version, which he came up with during Below Deck season 3 aboard the luxury yacht Eros, was delivered directly to former Chief Stew Kate Chastain. Lee and Kate were discussing the plan for Charter season, and Lee was brutally honest about the crew having messed up in the past. Kate was used to Lee’s antics and simply nodded with the Captain.





 2  “Life is like a sh*t sandwich. The more bread you have, the more sh*t you have to eat.” 
Below Deck Season 6


 







Lee gave this advice on the Below Deck after the show, but it&#39;s still one of his funniest one-liners. The Captain was discussing the events of Below Deck season 6 when My Seanna sailed outside the Caribbean for the first time. The Captain had more on his plate than usual when handling new crew and dealing with a route he hadn’t sailed My Seanna on before. As the season continued, things became more difficult for Lee, and ultimately, he had to fire Bosun Chandler Brooks, so it isn’t surprising that he was a bit negative. Lee was able to make light of the situation during the after-show, which led to this hilarious philosophy.





 3  “I’m madder than a pissed-on chicken.” 
Below Deck Season 4


 







Captain Lee coined this one-liner aboard My Valor during Below Deck season 4 after the crew had a poor docking. When he first delivered this gem, he was furious at the entirety of the crew for their incompetency in getting the yacht docked appropriately, especially considering that a lousy docking can cost a ton of repairs and tarnish Lee’s reputation as Captain. It wasn&#39;t surprising the crew was in shambles, especially with memorable deckhand Nico Scholly aboard the ship. Since its inception, Lee has used the phrase liberally.

 4  “It really wrinkles my a**.” 
Below Deck Season 7
While Captain Lee coined this particular phrase on Below Deck season 7, it has been thrown around in various iterations since the beginning of the series. Every time he uses it, it all comes down to getting angry about things that shouldn’t be happening on board in the first place. Using the same intonation as saying something “grinds their gears,” Lee has made the phrase iconic.





 5  “If you start crying again, I’m gonna have to go get you some cheese to go with that wine you’ve been spouting.” 
Below Deck Season 1
        

Early in the run of the franchise, Captain Lee was cited as an “old school Captain,” which, to many crewmembers, meant he had his specific terminology and phrases. Still, the crew aboard Below Deck season 1’s vessel, Honor, were shocked to hear how extensive Lee’s phrases were. This retort to the crew, which Lee said with a sharp, serious tone, was met with raucous laughter from the deckhands. A little less filtered than he is now, in the early seasons of Below Deck, Captain Lee was known to have a dry sense of humor and the language of a sailor, which he&#39;s illustrated several times throughout the series.





 6  “I’m gonna eat someone’s a** for dinner!” 
Below Deck Season 8
        

This Below Deck season 8 gem came on the heels of the crew getting an already angry Captain Lee even angrier. While Lee said the line with the intention of sounding threatening, viewers couldn’t help but pick up on the cultural connotation of Lee’s phrasing. Lee, who was making his way up to the deck to yell at the crew, was asked if he’d like something for dinner. He barked this phrase out at a stunned crew member, who left in the dust to chat with his deckhands. As is his specialty, Captain Lee diverted attention from the drama and delivered another hilarious one-liner in the heat of the moment.
