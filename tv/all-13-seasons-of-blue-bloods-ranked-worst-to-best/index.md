## Literature Review
Blue Bloods has seen plenty of police drama, heartache, and family issues over its 13 seasons, but some seasons are ranked better than others. 




Blue Bloods is one of those shows that can leave audiences hanging on the edge of their seats, but some of the show&#39;s seasons rank higher than others. The show premiered in 2010 to rave reviews and has won 4 awards, including several Prism Awards. The show follows a multi-generational family of cops and lawyers as they solve cases and go through family drama. With Frank Reagan heading the family as a commissioner in New York City, he oversees his family&#39;s welfare as well as the welfare of the hundreds of police officers under his wing.
Blue Bloods is ending after 14 seasons, so audiences can expect more drama from the Reagan family before the show ends officially. With more Reagan family dinners to come, audiences have a lot to look forward to. There hopefully will be plenty of room for finishing up story arcs and giving well-loved characters the ending they deserve. Here are the Blue Bloods seasons ranked worst to best.









 








 13  Season 12 
Danny gets targeted again


 







Like many police procedural shows on television, Blue Bloods season 12 recycled plotlines from previous episodes, making it stale and repetitive. Once again, Danny Reagan finds himself as the target of a gang he&#39;s investigating. While this might have worked in earlier seasons of the show, season 12 desperately needed new cases and a fresh outlook to make it work. As a result, the show did not deliver and left audiences reaching to turn off their TVs. With no new surprises, deaths, or even new family members to introduce, season 12 showed the show&#39;s inability to connect to its audience.





 12  Season 7 
Religion and social issues as Danny takes the stand
        

Religious and social issues have long been a part of police shows and, if delivered correctly, it can have a great impact on audiences. Season 7 of Blue Bloods showed how the police could have dealt with social issues, but instead, the season falls flat and is less than memorable with overused plot devices. Other than Danny having to testify in court over his involvement in a shooting, the season held no surprises or shocking drama that hadn&#39;t been done before. Overall, it is a tame and safe season, which left audiences deeming season 7 to be disappointing and ordinary.





 11  Season 9 
Eddie and Jamie finally get married
        

After many years of &#34;will-they-won&#39;t-they&#34;, Eddie and Jamie finally tie the knot in season 9 of Blue Bloods. While it pleased fans of the couple, the season as a whole was a bit of a letdown, other than the plot of Danny investigating his wife&#39;s death. Without any form of balance in individual storylines that occur throughout the show, season 9 feels rushed and impatient to skip straight ahead to the wedding. Season 9 also focuses on family pressure as Eddie learns the hard way what it is like to be a Reagan before her wedding, something that has been done before in previous seasons.





 10  Season 13 
Blue Bloods turns political
        

The latest season of Blue Bloods focused primarily on politics and Erin&#39;s run for District Attorney, which left the stuff that audiences liked in the earlier seasons in the dust. While the season was made post-COVID, politics have made an impact on the show this season and the creative decisions behind the plotlines. Erin&#39;s run for District Attorney eventually ends with her deciding not to run anymore, which makes the storyline pointless and completely disregards everything that Erin has worked for.





 9  Season 11 
Frank (almost) loses his job again
        

Season 11 of Blue Bloods came out with only 16 episodes, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in 2020. Once again, Frank&#39;s job is on the line when a new mayor takes over, leaving nothing new to be shared with fans and leaving a stale impression to the season. Frank&#39;s job has been at risk before whenever a mayor takes over, but this becomes a repetitive storyline and doesn&#39;t give anything new to the show. While the COVID lockdown left new challenges in terms of filming for many television shows, the only saving grace for season 11 is that it did incorporate some elements of that year into the show.





 8  Season 10 
Nicky grows up and moves out
        

As the Reagan family aged during the show, season 10 put that into perspective. Nicky Reagan was a child when the show began in 2010 and seeing her take on an adult role showed how much she had grown up in season 10. The season also introduces new challenges for old-school Frank as he adjusts to being a commissioner in the 21st century, with issues ranging from police brutality to sexual assault. While the season focuses heavily on issues that current cops deal with, it gives it a realness that can be relatable to the audience.





 7  Season 8 
Coping with losing Linda
        

While Jamie and Eddie finally get engaged in season 8, it also saw Danny lose the love of his life in a helicopter crash before season 8 comes out. Linda Reagan was the voice of reason in her marriage with Danny and the mother of their two sons. After she dies in a helicopter crash between seasons 7 and 8, Danny learns how to be a single parent and a grieving spouse while coping with a dangerous job that nearly kills him. Season 8 offered a perspective on how hard it can be to be a police officer and a single parent, making it one of its best seasons.
            
 
 Blue Bloods: One Quote From Each Main Character That Goes Against Their Personality 
The main Blue Bloods characters are usually consistent and true to themselves. Here, however, are some quotes that go against their personalities.









 6  Season 4 
Plenty of excitement and new cases
        

Season 4 has plenty of excitement under its belt with lots of new cases, murders, and family drama to even things out. From Jamie being assigned a new partner in season 4, episode 1, &#34;Unwritten Rules&#34; to Frank going up against a judge&#39;s ruling, there is no rest for the Reagans as they continue to solve crime and deal with family issues. Season 4 is one of the best seasons and brings to light the idea of separating work life and family life, making it one of the stronger seasons of the show.





 5  Season 3 
Detective Baez becomes Danny&#39;s partner
        

Season 3 introduces Detective Maria Baez, who becomes Danny&#39;s new partner after her previous assignment is disbanded. This season focuses heavily on the effects of drug use on families and how damaging it can be. Gang violence is, once again, a prominent issue in season 3, as it shows how easily innocent people can get caught in the crossfire during gunfights. As mentioned previously, Season 3 is a powerful reminder of the harmful effects of gang violence and how drugs can destroy relationships, making it one of the best seasons of Blue Bloods and the most impactful.





 4  Season 2 
Family drama


 







While season 1 focused on meeting the Reagan family, season 2 delved more deeply into the family dynamic and the perks of being a police officer. From Henry Reagan having a heart attack before Thanksgiving to Jamie being put under house arrest by his father, there is no shortage of family drama for the Reagans. Season 2 shows that even if you are part of a family that has connections to law enforcement, there should be no special treatment. This made season 2 very strong and, once again, relatable to anyone who has generations of family in law enforcement.





 3  Season 5 
The family is in danger
        

One of the scariest seasons of Blue Bloods, season 5 does not shy away from the dangers of being a police officer. Danny undergoes the scariest test of his marriage when Linda is shot in season 5, episode 22, &#34;The Art of War&#34; and the whole family rallies around him. For audiences who go back and watch the show from the beginning, it can be difficult to see Linda in danger, knowing that she will die. Because of the Reagans&#39; prominence in the police force and beyond, season 5 highlights how dangerous this involvement can be for their families, an issue that is raised again in season 6.





 2  Season 6 
Erin&#39;s life as a single parent
        

Being a single parent can be challenging, which is what season 6 focuses on. With plenty of new cases, drama, and family dinners, season 6 of Blue Bloods focuses on Erin&#39;s role as a single parent raising her rebellious teenage daughter Nicky. Erin&#39;s career as an attorney has seen her in tough spots before, but when Nicky is kidnapped and held hostage by a serial killer, she and the rest of the family go to great lengths to find her. Season 6 also showed Erin&#39;s vulnerable side, giving the season a humanized edge and a relatable one for anyone who might be raising a teenager as a single parent.





 1  Season 1 
Meeting the family
        

The first season of Blue Bloods introduces the Reagan family as audiences learn more about their personal lives and their work lives. The first season explains how law enforcement among family members works, even showing the sadder side of it when talking about the death of Joe Reagan. From rooting out dirty cops to Danny solving the kidnapping of a teenager, there are plenty of intense moments followed by family love. Season 1 really shows the importance of family and is a powerful starter to the show&#39;s run, establishing the family&#39;s trust and love for one another.
