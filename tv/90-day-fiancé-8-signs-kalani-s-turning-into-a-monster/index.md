## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Kalani Faagata wants fans to give her sympathy because Asuelu cheated on her but she also cheated on him with Dallas Nuez.




90 Day Fiancé star Kalani Faagata is deserving of sympathy but is also to blame for the demise of her relationship with Asuelu Pulaa. The California-based Kalani started her reality TV career with 90 Day Fiancé season 6 when she welcomed Asuelu from Samoa to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. While Kalani gave birth to two babies with Asuelu within a short period, his immaturity made her look at him as her third child and not an equal partner. Kalani tried to get a divorce from Asuelu, but her family pressure made the situation complicated. She wanted her kids to have a father and continued to stay in the miserable marriage.
However, once Kalani got a way out of the marriage with Asuelu, there was no looking back. She began a relationship with a man named Dallas Nuez while she was still married to Asuelu. Kalani and Asuelu split during 90 Day: The Last Resort and she made her new relationship with Dallas Instagram official. Kalani is being celebrated for choosing her happiness over Asuelu. However, Kalani’s villainous ways got overshadowed in the process.

 5  Kalani Considers “Monster” Angela Deem Her   Friend 


Drama queen Angela was once considered an entertainer, but it didn’t take her long to become a franchise villain. The no-filter Angela has gotten into feuds on the show and in real life with the most innocent of cast members. Her physical fights with her friends eventually get forgotten when she apologizes to the cast member, but fans never forget Angela’s controversial actions, which make her look truly dangerous. However, things do start looking toxic when Angela befriends a cast member and similarities between them start to surface. Kalani and Angela got drunk and bonded over their cheating husbands on 90 Day: The Last Resort.
Kalani revealed she’d gone out with Angela before. She saw a “lot of similarities” between herself and Angela. She thought they both had “big hearts” and they took care of people around them. Meanwhile, Kalani also praised Angela on her Instagram by calling her one of her “favorite humans.” When Angela is one of the most disliked cast members of the franchise and fans have even created petitions for Angela to be fired and banned from appearing on more shows, Kalani saying she was “thankful to be her friend” said a lot about how Kalani is as a person.





 4  Kalani Treated Asuelu Badly On 90 Day Fiancé 
        

Kalani has been accused of gaslighting Asuelu in the past. There was a scene between the couple in 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 6 where she manipulated a romantic conversation between them about intimacy. Asuelu love’s language is food, and it’s how he expresses himself when it comes to romance. However, Kalani shut down Asuelu by telling him, “My brother brings me food.” She shut down Asuelu’s feelings and started crying to make herself look like the victim. She made it look as if Asuelu’s feelings were not valid. Kalani was slammed by fans for dismissing Asuelu’s efforts.
It&#39;s when fans started noticing that Kalani always wanted to come across as the righteous, perfect partner who was dealing with the partner who was always wrong. Kalani played the victim the entire time she was with Asuelu on multiple shows, and when she needed sympathy, she started with the waterworks. Kalani often spoke sarcastically to Asuelu, knowing he couldn’t understand the taunts due to their language barrier. To Kalani, her feelings were more valid than Asuelu&#39;s, and it was the same even on 90 Day: The Last Resort.





 3  Kalani Didn’t Tell Asuelu She Was Dating Her Hall Pass 
        

Kalani and Asuelu arrive at 90 Day: The Last Resort as a couple with a dark secret and issues that perhaps could never be resolved because of Kalani’s involvement with another man. Asuelu had already taken the blame for their dying marriage on himself when he started to reveal why he decided to opt for couple’s therapy with Kalani. Asuelu said he wanted to work on himself. He accepted what he did was bad and that the reason they were there was because of him. Kalani spoke about Asuelu cheating on her by kissing a mystery woman in Samoa and getting a yeast infection on his tongue.
She said Asuelu gave her a hall pass to go and kiss some other man to make things even, but he trusted her not to go ahead with it. Kalani told Asuelu that she kissed a man she met on social media. However, it was on 90 Day: The Last Resort, in front of all the cast members and therapists that Kalani revealed she’d done more than just kissing. She “waited for therapy” to tell Asuelu that things between her and the other man escalated further to oral sex and then, after that, it escalated into actual sex. Asuelu was devastated by Kalani’s revelation.





 2  Kalani Kept Seeing Dallas Behind Asuelu’s Back 
        

Kalani had told Asuelu that she’d broken up with Dallas. However, he stayed quiet when he noticed her texting him secretly, thinking Asuelu couldn’t tell. Asuelu maintained that he never kept in touch with the people he cheated on her with. “I didn’t know Kalani had sex with him,” said Asuelu, who became worried about how serious things between his wife and the other man were at that point. Kalani claimed she’d made a “real connection” with Dallas. She said she lacked a connection like that in her marriage. After Kalani and Asuelu spilled their guts in the first session, she promised him that she was going to block Dallas.
Kalani said she unblocked him when she supposedly saw Asuelu deleting some messages she thought were from other women from his phone. Kalani not only unblocked Dallas but also made plans to meet him. Dallas flew to where Kalani was filming 90 Day: The Last Resort. She left the resort to meet him and ended up spending the night with Dallas. Asuelu tried looking for his wife the next day only for her to lie to him about where she was and who she was with. Kalani came to the resort to work on their marriage for the sake of their kids but ended up cheating on Asuelu herself.





 1  Kalani Gave Asuelu False Hope By Coming To The Last Resort 
        

Asuelu broke down in tears when Kalani called an emergency session to tell Asuelu that she hooked up with Dallas when he came to see her. She said she had to fight to get “even an ounce” of kindness, affection, and love out of Asuelu when she didn’t have to do the same thing with Dallas. She acknowledged Asuelu was trying hard, but it was “too late” now. Asuelu told the cameras, “I feel like I do my best and I&#39;m trying, and it failed.” The Samoan man still had hope that he and Kalani could get back together someday. However, Kalani had already made up her mind to divorce him and divorce him quickly.
90 Day Fiancé star Kalani hoped for Asuelu to “deal with everything” so he could move on just like she had with Dallas. Rebounds and relationships that start as affairs have lesser chances of lasting and the same can be predicted about Kalani’s relationship with Dallas. Kalani has been seeking validation in her relationships, and it’s something that’s tied to her feeling of self-worth. Kalani should have given herself time to heal from her broken marriage instead of deciding to jump into another serious relationship. Kalani’s poor choices have almost always landed her in trouble, and her decision to date Dallas isn’t getting her any sympathy either from 90 Day Fiancé fans.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
