## Literature Review
With many personalities in a very small space, drama is around every corner on Below Deck, even with the crew.






This article contains moments from Below Deck&#39;s franchise that include sensitive topics based on abuse, homophobia, and bullying.







Personalities aboard the super yachts on Below Deck make for a fun watch, but sometimes, personalities are less than favorable, even among crew members. While some terrible guests have been on Below Deck, crew members aren&#39;t exempt from destructive behavior. Sometimes, it was just as tricky for cast members to call out fellow crew members as for unruly guests.

Living in close quarters with people with whom one works is not accessible, and these crew members work around the clock to give guests the best vacation of their lives. But poor work ethic, lying on resumes, and just plain bad attitudes from one person can make the job a living hell for the entire crew, and being unable to go home and away from that person can be a severe emotional and mental drain. In anticipation of Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to revisit some of the worst crew members.


 Tom Pearson 
Below Deck Sailing Yacht - Season 3
          




Tom Pearson&#39;s time on the Parsifal III was not an easy one from the get-go. Immature and irresponsible, he tried too hard to convince everyone that he was ready for the yachting life when he was anything but. His drinking only heightened the problem as he would get mean and belligerent, especially toward Ashley Marti and Gary King.

The final straw that caused Captain Glenn to fire Tom was the night he was on anchor watch. During his shift, the winds unexpectedly picked up to over 30 knots and caused the anchor to start dragging. Instead of getting the deck crew up right away, he dragged his feet until they got up after hearing the anchor scraping on the bottom of the sea. While he did own up to his mistake, it was too little too late. The crew, especially Glenn, had lost trust in him.



 Heather Chase 
Below Deck - Season 9
          




Heather Chase started season 9 off strong. She was a fantastic chief stew, no-nonsense, and a great team player. After excellent chief stews like Kate Chastain and Hannah Ferrier, fans were impressed by Hannah’s leadership. However, Heather’s good-girl image ended when she used a racially insensitive word toward her co-worker, Rayna Lindsey. While the two women spoke about the incident afterward, they never went back to normal. Because of this, Chase apologized for her actions repeatedly, but she’s viewed as one of the worst crew members.



 Mila Kolomeitseva 
Below Deck Mediterranean - Season 4
          

Mila&#39;s resume was impressive, and she could have been one of Below Deck&#39;s best chefs. She was a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef with an Instagram page filled with delicious-looking dishes, so Captain Sandy and Hannah Ferrier had high hopes for the charter season. However, it soon became evident that Mila had no clue what she was doing in the galley and created meals that looked worse than any fast food.




The lousy situation turned even worse when it was revealed just how vile of a person Mila was. During a night out, she revealed that she was homophobic, which is awkward considering Captain Sandy is an openly gay woman. Mila was fired in episode 5, and whether she lied on that impressive resume remains open.



 Leon Walker 
Below Deck - Season 3
          

Accidents happen, but it is the response to them that matters. After an oven caught fire in the galley, Leon claimed that the pans stored there caused the fire. The stove was greasy. Instead of admitting he screwed up, he blamed one of the best chief stews on Below Deck, Kate Chastain, and lied to Captain Lee that she was intoxicated when she was supposed to be heating a pizza for the guests.

After admitting to not seeing Kate drink, he doubled down on the lie by saying he saw her other nights in the act of deflection. He was rightfully fired for his actions but was allowed to finish the charter. Leon refused and bailed that day.






 Lara Flumiani 
Below Deck Mediterranean - Season 5
          

One of the worst second stews, Lara Flumiani, quit after three episodes. She didn&#39;t get along with Hannah or most of the crew. Nothing Hannah tried made the situation better. Captain Sandy attempted to intervene but to no avail, as Lara gave off what was called &#34;f--- you energy,&#34; laughing at severe matters and infuriating the captain.

Things escalated so much that Lara left at midnight and returned the following day before the first charter to inform Captain Sandy, who promptly retrieved her items. This relieved many of the crew, happy to see her off the boat. Working on a super yacht is hard, but having a good team improves the experience. Without Lara, the season she was finished was more potent than if she&#39;d stayed. There were horrible guests on Below Deck, but Lara was worse.






 Trevor Walker 
Below Deck - Season 4
          

Socially inept and full of himself, Trevor quickly lost the respect of his crew members for his abrasive behavior during the first charter when he made disparaging remarks towards others.

Worse, Trevor started the season as a senior deckhand and was demoted to deckhand. When the demotion didn&#39;t get through to him, he was fired in the fourth episode after he got too drunk, mocked the Marines, and called his crew members disparaging names. Ultimately, Trevor was simply inept on the job, which is why Trevor is one of the worst deckhands in the Below Deck franchise.



 Magda Ziomek 
Below Deck Down Under - Season 1
          




Magda had difficulty being apart from her boyfriend and constantly texted him throughout the charters. She vacillated between smiling and being angry over something her boyfriend had texted or done that day. It interfered with her work, which she wasn&#39;t good at anyway. Captain Jason had to step in after he was told that Magda used more of the data plan than the rest of the crew combined. Eventually, her work ethic and skills weren&#39;t up to par, and Aesha Scott let her go with two charters left in the season.



 Andrew Sturby 
Below Deck - Season 2
          

Andrew showcased why it&#39;s important to never lie on a resume. This may seem like a relatively harmless offense, but it could have significant consequences. Andrew claimed to be an experienced deckhand. It didn&#39;t take long for that lie to surface as he made rookie mistake after rookie mistake. He confessed that his entire resume was fabricated.




Andrew was fired, and because of this incident, the Below Deck casting team now checks all the references that each crew member must have, according to Cheat Sheet. While the season 2 crew was lucky that no limbs were lost during Andrew&#39;s time on the boat, oversights like that could mean deaths in the future.



 Jennifer Howell 
Below Deck - Season 5
          

As the rest of the crew was working hard, Jennifer slept in and did not take orders from Kate Chastain very well, claiming she was out to get her. Even more annoying was how Jennifer reacted when Kate gave her instructions. Her eye rolls were disrespectful, and her comments were unnecessary.

Many crew members wanted her off the boat, but that day did not come. The appearance-obsessed stew could see the end of the season no better than she boarded. She was another one who needed to control her behavior, and her horrible half-apologies didn&#39;t smooth anything over as she repeated the behavior the first chance she got.






 Ryan McKeown 
Below Deck Down Under - Season 1
          

From the beginning, Ryan had an attitude toward Aesha Scott and would barely communicate with her. When things went wrong, he took no accountability. Hostile, rude, arrogant, and delusional, Ryan couldn&#39;t fathom being questioned about anything and, at times, wholly disregarded guest requests that he considered beneath him. He decided what the guests were eating and when and didn&#39;t care about anything anyone said, then claimed that only Aesha complained.

Captain Jason eventually fired him, but Ryan didn&#39;t leave quietly or gracefully. He loudly expressed his anger about the captain&#39;s decision to the point Captain Jason had to set a time limit on his departure.



 Lexi Wilson 
Below Deck Mediterranean - Season 6
          




Lexi got into several drunken altercations that ended in nothing but more drama. Demotion didn&#39;t correct her behavior, and when she was finally fired, the rest of the crew felt apparent relief.

Dismissing others, calling other women names, bragging about her money, and physically assaulting Lloyd, attacking multiple crew members, Lexi&#39;s attitude and behavior were atrocious from beginning to end. Lexi was one of the worst crew members, but the season of Below Deck Med was one of the best.
