  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives’ Kody Brown feels helpless after getting dumped by Christine, Janelle, and Meri. He’s brushing off the hurt by making false statements.</p>
<p>Kody Brown from Sister Wives claims he never loved Christine, Janelle, and Meri Brown, but some clues suggest he is lying about it. The 54-year-old once had great relationships with his first three wives. He was a proud polygamist who only cared about growing his family. Unfortunately, something changed when Kody married his fourth wife, Robyn Brown, and began focusing all his energy on her. He stopped visiting his other wives, making them jealous, sad, and heartbroken. Christine, Meri, and Janelle gave Kody countless chances to treat them like he treated Robyn. However, he never did.</p>
<p>When COVID-19 hit, Kody became more distant toward three wives. He only spent his time with Robyn, which pushed the other Sister Wives to reevaluate their marriages. In 2020, Christine Brown dumped Kody. After she left him, Janelle and Meri followed suit in the next few months. As expected, Kody wasn&rsquo;t happy about it at all. He grew angry and irritated about his situation. He even claimed he never loved Christine, Meri, and Janelle Brown.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Kody Lies To Hurt His Wives For Leaving Him</p>
<p>Kody has boldly said that he only ever loved Robyn. However, it seems that he’s lying because of the circumstances. One reason Kody could be saying that he never loved his first three wives is to hurt them. The Brown family patriarch was very emotional when Christine left him, especially now that she&rsquo;s remarried to David Woolley. He was also pretty upset when Janelle decided to leave their marriage. Now, Kody is feeling the same pain his other wives felt for years when he abandoned them for Robyn. He’s likely saying he never loved them to hurt them back.</p>
<p>Kody Is In Denial To Soothe His Ego</p>
<p>Kody is a selfish man with a fragile ego. He used Meri, Janelle, and Christine for nearly 30 years but only thought of himself. Every decision he made was to satisfy his needs, including his marriage to Robyn. Kody married his fourth wife because he wanted a young, good-looking woman who could still give him children. He was blinded by his obsession with growing his family and never cared for anyone else’s feelings. Kody’s recent divorces have hurt his ego because he didn’t get what he wanted as usual. He’s saying he never loved his ex-wives to satisfy his ego.</p>
<p>Kody Wants To Appease Robyn</p>
<p>Another reason why Kody may have lied about never loving his first three wives is to make Robyn feel special. In 2020, Kody had four wives and felt like a king. He was fearless and confident, but things have changed significantly in the last three years. Kody no longer has a huge family or numerous wives. Instead, he’s in a monogamous relationship with Robyn, his only remaining partner. Now, he can no longer feel as secure as before and is trying everything to avoid ruining his only marriage.</p>
<p>Kody badmouths his former partners or claims he only loved Robyn to save his last remaining relationship. He worries that Robyn could leave him like his other wives and doesn’t want to be a single man. By claiming that he never loved Meri, Janelle, and Christine, Kody is trying to make himself look like Robyn’s soulmate. The Sister Wives cast member wants Robyn to feel secure, happy, and content with him. He wants to make her feel special, even if it means breaking his ex-wives’ hearts by claiming he never loved them.</p>
<p>Kody Wants To Rewrite The Past &amp; Embrace Monogamy</p>
<p>Kody is smart and knows how to make the best of any situation. There are plenty of examples that prove that he did care for Christine, Meri, and Janelle. Incidents such as the way he treated Christine during her pregnancy and his emotional dates with Janelle show that he did have a lot of feelings for them. However, Kody is claiming that he didn’t love them to rewrite the past in his favor. Kody knows that three divorces don’t look good on paper and doesn’t want to feel like a failure.</p>
<p>By telling everyone that he was never in love with Janelle, Meri, and Christine, Kody wants to make it seem like the past didn’t matter. Now, he wants to rebrand himself as a monogamous man. If Kody admits that he shared a real bond with his ex-wives, he’d have to admit that he messed up with polygamy. However, he doesn’t want to do it or face the truth. Kody&rsquo;s pretending that he only ever loved Robyn, which helps him feel more confident about his new monogamous life.</p>
<p>Kody Wants To Feel Superior By Rejecting His Other Wives</p>
<p>Kody may simply be rejecting his ex-wives to feel superior. Over the last ten years, viewers have seen how the Sister Wives star portrays himself as the most important part of the Brown family. In 2020, he made rules for each of his wives and demanded they follow them. Before that, he tried to control them and his kids. Kody doesn’t like to lose, nor does he appreciate being rejected.</p>
<p>Kody nearly lost it when Janelle didn’t obey his unreasonable COVID-19 rules and when Christine left him to find happiness.</p>
<p>Kody doesn’t want his ex-wives to feel superior, nor does he want them to feel like they’ve hurt him too. Kody rejects Meri, Janelle, and Christine to show they don’t matter. He’s trying to maintain the same superior attitude he always had over the last 30 years of his married life. Kody may also be doing it to make Robyn feel like he’s &ldquo;the man.&rdquo; The Sister Wives cast member may be indirectly trying to convey to her that he was and is the alpha of the family.</p>
