<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Star Wars Rebels features an amazing cast of live-action and voice-acting all-stars, each who bring an added edge to Star Wars.</p>
<p>Star Wars Rebels&rsquo; voice cast brought to life one of the first Star Wars projects released by Disney, telling the compelling story of a found family in the midst of the Empire&rsquo;s reign. Introducing characters who will continue to impact upcoming Star Wars TV shows, Rebels’ Ghost crew transitioned from low-level nuisances on the planet of Lothal to full-blown rebels that were integral in the Empire’s defeat. If the story was not interesting enough, the show’s cast features some seasoned voice actors including the return of iconic actors from Star Wars: The Clone Wars’ timeline.
Through these actors and other elements, Star Wars Rebels does an excellent job of bridging the gap between The Clone Wars and the live-action original trilogy. Characters from both eras make appearances, though usually in guest spots, such as Lando Calrissian and Ben Kenobi. The ending of Rebels has proven crucial to the galaxy’s future, from impacting stories of upcoming Star Wars movies in the New Republic era to the characters of the show continuing their live-action journey in Ahsoka season 2’s story. With Rebels’ importance in mind, here is the ultimate guide to the show’s voice cast.</p>
<p>Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know<br>
Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&rsquo;s everything we know about the project.</p>
<p>14 Taylor Gray as Ezra Bridger
Star Wars Rebels&rsquo; lovable scoundrel-turned-Jedi Padawan.</p>
<p>For four years, Taylor Gray portrayed the Jedi Padawan Ezra Bridger and helped shape him into a character whose whereabouts have been at the forefront of fans&rsquo; minds. Gray was a child actor before joining the Rebels cast, playing Bucket on Bucket and Skinner’s Epic Adventures on Nickelodeon. He also had guest spots on shows like Numb3rs and The Mentalist. Despite playing Ezra in Rebels, Gray has not done much acting after the show’s ending, appearing in other Star Wars projects like Forces of Destiny and serving as a guest host of a panel at Star Wars Celebration 2017.
While Ezra made the jump to live-action Star Wars in Ahsoka, Gray did not. Instead, Eman Esfandi took over as the live-action version of Ezra Bridger. Esfandi perfectly honored Gary’s performance from Star Wars Rebels, counting among the very best of live-action interpretations of Rebels’ characters. It is unclear if Gray will appear again in animation as Ezra, but with other projects like Tales of the Jedi season 2 in development, the possibility of both Gray and his Jedi character returning is likely.</p>
<p>13 Freddie Prinze Jr. as Kanan Jarrus
Ezra&rsquo;s Jedi Master, a former Padawan of the prequel trilogy&rsquo;s Jedi Order.</p>
<p>A well-known actor, Freddie Prinze Jr. lent his voice to Jedi Knight Kanan Jarrus throughout Rebels and has made vocal cameos in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the first episode of The Bad Batch. Known for his acting in the 1990s and early 2000s, Prinze Jr. had major roles in films like She’s All That and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Prinze would also go on to star alongside his wife, Sarah Michelle Gellar, in the live-action Scooby-Doo movies.
In television, Prinze Jr. had the main role in the short-lived Freddie, but also had stints on shows like 24, Friends, and Bones. While it’s unclear if Kanan or Prinze Jr. will ever appear in live-action, it seems unlikely. While disappointing, showrunner Dave Filoni may be able to get Prinze Jr. to reprise the role one more time if it is truly meaningful for the characters closest to Kanan from Rebels. Whether that be in the World Between Worlds, a flashback, or as a Force ghost, Kanan Jarrus will hopefully return despite his death in Rebels season 4.
Kanan Jarrus is the only member of the Ghost crew not to have appeared in live-action Star Wars as of Ahsoka season 1&rsquo;s ending.</p>
<p>12 Vanessa Marshall as Hera Syndulla
Pilot of the Ghost and leader of Star Wars Rebels&rsquo; Phoenix Squadron.</p>
<p>Vanessa Marshall is a seasoned voice actor who has been active since the 1990s and played roles in multiple Star Wars projects. While best known for voicing Hera Syndulla in Rebels, she also voiced Rook Kast in The Clone Wars and multiple parts in the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic. Marshall also had roles such as Mary Jane Watson in the animated The Spectacular Spider-Man. Marshall returned to the role of Hera in 2021 for a two-episode arc in The Bad Batch, where she played a younger version of the character.</p>
<p>11 Steve Blum as Garazeb “Zeb” Orrelios
The Lasat warrior of Phoenix Squadron.</p>
<p>An accomplished voice actor, Steve Blum has been lending his voice to different shows, movies, and video games since the early 1990s. Blum has done work across multiple genres, including many performances in anime titles. In television, Blum portrayed one of the main antagonists, Smytus, on My Life as a Teenage Robot, and Amon in The Legend of Korra.
Blum reprised his role as former Lasat Honor Guard Zeb Orrelios in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 5. The cameo came as a surprise to many and has led to speculation that Zeb could appear in future seasons of The Mandalorian or even The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Star Wars movie, especially since Din Djarin is now working with the New Republic to help secure the Outer Rim. Within Star Wars, Blum has lent his voice to other minor characters in shows like The Bad Batch and Visions, as well as video games like Star Wars: The Force Unleashed.</p>
<p>Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie<br>
The Mandalorian&rsquo;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&rsquo;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.</p>
<p>10 Tiya Sircar as Sabine Wren
The Mandalorian warrior who joined the Ghost crew at a young age.</p>
<p>Tiya Sircar may best be known as the voice of the Mandalorian artist and weapons specialist Sabine Wren, but she has also found success acting in live-action. Sircar played “The Real Eleanor”/Vicky on NBC’s The Good Place for all four seasons in a recurring role. Additionally, she has had minor recurring roles on shows like The Vampire Diaries, Greek, and The Suite Life On Deck. Most recently, Sircar appeared in 2023’s AppleTV+ film Ghosted, which starred Chris Evans and Ana de Armas.
Despite her excellent voice portrayal in Rebels, Sircar did not return to voice Sabine in the Ahsoka series, with Natasha Lui Bordizzo taking over the role. That said, Sircar returned to Star Wars for Forces of Destiny. This animated series gave the voice actor another chance to bring the Mandalorian to life before Bordizzo took over for Ahsoka and any other upcoming Star Wars projects in Star Wars&rsquo; New Republic timeline.</p>
<p>9 Dave Filoni as C1-10P/Chopper
The lovable albeit cranky droid of Hera Syndulla, and loyal companion to the Ghost crew.</p>
<p>Filoni is credited as the creator of beloved Star Wars characters like Ahsoka Tano and clone Captain Rex, as well as multiple Star Wars shows like Rebels, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka. Filoni has acted as creator, writer, producer, and director across the various Star Wars projects after being mentored by George Lucas himself on The Clone Wars. Filoni is not one to do much acting, but he had a cameo in The Mandalorian season 2 as Trapper Wolf, a role he reprised for season 3.
However, throughout the entirety of Rebels, Filoni lends his voice to the droid with questionable morals, C1-10P, better known as Chopper. In all of the credits for Rebels, Chopper’s voice actor was listed as “As Himself.” For the series finale credits, it was revealed that Dave Filoni had been the voice of the droid throughout the show&rsquo;s run. Chopper also appeared in Ahsoka, once again voiced by Filoni.</p>
<p>8 Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka Tano
Anakin Skywalker&rsquo;s Padawan was brought to life for years by Eckstein.</p>
<p>Filoni created Ahsoka Tano to be Anakin Skywalker’s Padawan during The Clone Wars, but since then, the character has grown into a fan-favorite. In animation, Ahsoka is voiced by Ashley Eckstein and has been since 2008, with Eckstein reprising the role recently in Tales of the Jedi for three episodes focused on the Togruta Jedi. While Eckstein did not have quite as large of a role in Rebels, she was integral in connecting The Clone Wars with the show. Ahsoka appeared for the first time in the Rebels season 1 finale, revealing herself to be Fulcrum, Hera’s rebel informant.
Despite her tenure as Ahsoka, Eckstein was recast for live-action, with Rosario Dawson taking on the role. Eckstein has been massively supportive of Dawson and her portrayal, as she loves Ahsoka and wants what is best for the character. Within Star Wars, Eckstein has also done the audiobook recording for EK Johnston’s Ahsoka novel.</p>
<p>7 Dee Bradley Baker as Captain Rex and Other Clones</p>
<p>Compared to The Clone Wars, Dee Bradley Baker had significantly fewer characters to voice in Rebels. By the time Rebels took place, many of the clones had died or had been forced to retire, meaning that when Ahsoka Tano sent the Ghost crew to meet her old friend, there were only three clones Baker had to reprise. Captain Rex served the largest role, but Commander Wolfe and Gregor were also seen in Rebels.
Baker has had steady work as a voice actor for decades. Baker has voiced characters like Perry the Platypus from Phineas and Ferb, and will likely reprise the role for the show’s upcoming 40-episode revival on Disney+. Currently, Baker is voicing five of the six main characters in Star Wars: The Bad Batch, all of whom are mutant clones, allowing Baker freedom in shaping their voices to their personalities. While The Bad Batch season 3&rsquo;s story will end the show, it hopefully will not be the last audiences have heard of Dee Bradley Baker as the clones.</p>
<p>6 David Oyelowo as Agent Alexsandr Kallus
The ISB Agent who opposed the Rebels had a well-known film actor voicing him.</p>
<p>A highly accomplished film actor, David Oyelowo has played iconic roles including the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 2014 film Selma; the role got Oyelowo a Golden Globe nomination. That same year, he was also nominated for another Golden Globe for his performance as Peter Snowden in Nightingale. Within Star Wars, Oyelowo voiced former ISB Agent Alexsandr Kallus for 28 episodes of Star Wars Rebels. Initially starting as one of the main antagonists, Kallus would later become a rebel spy before properly defecting and joining the Rebellion.</p>
<p>5 Lars Mikkelsen as Grand Admiral Thrawn
Mikkelsen brought major gravitas to the main antagonist of Star Wars Rebels.</p>
<p>The older brother to other Star Wars alum Mads Mikkelsen, Lars provided the voice to Imperial master strategist, Star Wars’ Grand Admiral Thrawn. Mikkelsen has had recurring roles on House of Cards, Sherlock, and The Witcher. In 2023, Mikkelsen reprised his role as Thrawn in Ahsoka season 1, and will likely continue to do so in future Star Wars movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>4 Jason Isaacs as The Grand Inquisitor
Star Wars Rebels&rsquo; season 1 featured the Grand Inquisitor, voiced by a legendary actor.</p>
<p>An accomplished actor in live-action, Jason Isaacs is best known for playing Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series. In Star Wars Isaacs played the Rebels season 1 antagonist, the Grand Inquisitor. Isaacs brought grandeur and a menacing edge to the character, making him a refreshing villain for the franchise. To much disappointment, Isaacs did not return to play the character in live-action. For Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rupert Friend took over the role which many agreed was somewhat of a miscast. Regardless, Isaacs&rsquo; work in the role of Rebels&rsquo; Grand Inquisitor remains as compelling as ever.</p>
<p>3 Sam Witwer as Darth Maul and Emperor Palpatine
Two Sith Lords received a mainstay voice actor in Star Wars Rebels.</p>
<p>Best known for live-action roles in shows like Supergirl, Smallville, and Battlestar Galactica, Sam Witwer is a mainstay when it comes to Star Wars voice acting. First appearing in the now-Legends video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed as Starkiller, Darth Vader’s apprentice and personal assassin, Witwer has gone on to play other iconic Star Wars characters.
In Rebels, Witwer reprised his role as Darth Maul, who formed a dark bond with Ezra Bridger. Additionally, Witwer portrayed Emperor Palpatine in Rebels season 2, though the part has since been redubbed by Ian McDiarmid. Witwer has continued to make live-action cameos in shows like Andor, so it likely will not be long until the Star Wars alum appears again.</p>
<p>2 Katee Sackhoff as Bo-Katan Kryze
The Heiress of Mandalore is brought to riveting life by Katee Sackhoff.</p>
<p>Katee Sackhoff is best known for being the first voice actor to make the jump along with her character from animation to live-action in Star Wars. Bo-Katan Kryze first appeared as a member of Death Watch in The Clone Wars, but in Rebels was given the Darksaber by Sabine Wren to help Mandalorians unite under one leader. Most recently, Sackhoff reprised her role as Bo-Katan in live-action, being a main character in The Mandalorian season 3. Outside of Star Wars, Sackhoff starred in Battlestar Galactica and had recurring roles on shows like 24 and The Flash.</p>
