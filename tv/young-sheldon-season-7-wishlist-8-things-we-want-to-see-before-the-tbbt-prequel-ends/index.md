## Literature Review
Young Sheldon season 7 will wrap up Sheldon and the Coopers&#39; story in Texas, and several things need to happen to ensure a satisfying finale.




Several things should happen in Young Sheldon season 7 for a satisfying send-off for Sheldon and the rest of the Coopers. The Big Bang Theory prequel is wrapping up its run when it returns from its extended hiatus due to the dual Hollywood strikes of 2023. While it started as supplementary viewing for its parent series, diversifying its storytelling helped it find its own identity. While it broke away from The Big Bang Theory and focused on its own stories, it worked effectively. Young Sheldon season 6 was the culmination of years transitioning to become a proper family comedy, and it just so happens that it also posted show-high ratings.
Despite its continued popularity, Young Sheldon needs to end because of The Big Bang Theory canon. Admittedly, there are still so many plots that the show could explore if it were to continue, especially after it veered away from just being Sheldon&#39;s origins. Unfortunately, its creatives maintain that it is primarily about the boy genius, and since his time in Medford is coming to an end, the show should as well. This leaves a string of things that should happen before it fully bows out. Whether these are actually tackled is uncertain, but they&#39;re all integral in terms of Young Sheldon&#39;s own narrative and The Big Bang Theory universe&#39;s canon.
            
 
 What Georgie &amp; Mandy&#39;s Spinoff Means For Young Sheldon Season 7 
Georgie and Mandy&#39;s The Big Bang Theory spinoff will have some ramifications on how the Coopers&#39; final story unfolds in Young Sheldon season 7. 













 








 8  A Proper Ending To Paige&#39;s Story 
Paige needs to make a final return.
        

Despite not being a main cast member, Young Sheldon has been able to craft a compelling personal arc for Paige — Sheldon&#39;s fellow child prodigy who started struggling after her parents&#39; divorce. Season 6 brought her back a couple of times, significantly moving her story forward. Still, her fate is in limbo, and with The Big Bang Theory never even mentioning her, it&#39;s up to the prequel to craft a proper ending for her. Sadly, there hasn&#39;t been any indication that she will finally go back to a straight path, hinting that things will eventually end badly for her. Regardless of her upcoming fate, Young Sheldon mustn&#39;t leave it hanging.





 7  Georgie and Mandy&#39;s Wedding 
Georgie and Mandy&#39;s romance is the best original Young Sheldon arc.


 







Per The Big Bang Theory, Mandy and Georgie&#39;s relationship isn&#39;t meant to last. Still, that doesn&#39;t mean that Young Sheldon shouldn&#39;t endeavor to give them the best ending possible. The pair&#39;s romance is one of, if not the best original arc in the prequel, and it would be a massive disappointment if there&#39;s no major payoff to their unexpected but sweet romance. The Young Sheldon season 6 finale saw them finally getting engaged, with their season 7 story expectedly going to be about the preparations leading to the event. However, the offshoot should go all the way and show them tying the knot, leading to their upcoming spinoff.





 6  A Final Sheldon and Dr. Sturgis Team-Up 
Dr. Sturgis is Sheldon&#39;s first true mentor.
        

Young Sheldon season 7 will coincide with Sheldon&#39;s final year at East Texas Tech, but more than any academic pursuits, it&#39;s more important to see him work closely with Dr. Sturgis again. Despite being the boy genius&#39; real mentor, The Big Bang Theory did not feature or even reference the eccentric professor. Considering how vital Dr. Sturgis&#39; impact on Sheldon will be, Young Sheldon needs to make up for that crime by ensuring that he gets his due.





 5  Georgie&#39;s Entrepreneurial Beginnings 
Young Sheldon previously hinted at Georgie&#39;s penchant for tires.
        

The Big Bang Theory brought Georgie in much later than other members of the Cooper clan. Despite his limited appearance, pertinent information about his life was revealed, including eventually becoming a successful business owner. Young Sheldon season 6 glossed over Georgie&#39;s entrepreneurial skills, but before it ends, the spinoff needs to at least lay the foundation for Dr. Tire — something that his in-development offshoot can further delve into. Mandy&#39;s parents owning a tire shop could pave the way for that, making it much easier for Young Sheldon to do this before it ends.
            
 
 Young Sheldon Season 7 Just Needs This 1 Returning Character To Fix Georgie &amp; Mandy&#39;s Story 
Before Georgie and Mandy&#39;s planned wedding, Young Sheldon season 7 needs to bring back one important character from the past to properly wrap it up. 









 4  Missy Fully Redeeming Herself 
Young Sheldon season 6 set up Missy&#39;s redemption.


 







For years, Missy proved that she was the best Cooper family member. She was kind, witty, and funny, not to mention emotionally and socially capable. Young Sheldon season 6 introduced her rebellious storyline, however. Prompting her misbehavior was long feeling ignored by her parents. The near-death experience during the Medford tornado seemed to have shaken her enough to promise redemption — something that she will stay true to, per the Young Sheldon season 7 premiere synopsis. However, the spinoff needs to properly develop her personal arc, otherwise, they risk further ruining the character.





 3  George&#39;s Tragic Death 
It&#39;s almost time for George&#39;s unexpected demise.
        

Sheldon lost his father long before the events of The Big Bang Theory, and it was one of the most awaited plots in Young Sheldon when the prequel was announced. While it&#39;s unlikely that the family comedy will tackle George&#39;s established cheating scandal, the timeline still allows, if not mandates, it to deal with George&#39;s death. The specifics of his demise are still uncertain, although the fallout from it has been well established. Since its creatives insist on keeping in line with The Big Bang Theory canon, it&#39;s imperative that Young Sheldon address the incident since it changed the trajectory of the Coopers&#39; future.





 2  Sheldon&#39;s Move To Pasadena, California 
Sheldon is about to graduate college at East Texas Tech.
        

According to Young Sheldon co-creator Chuck Lorre, the series will tackle Sheldon&#39;s story until he is 15 years old. For context, Sheldon started his post-graduate studies at Caltech when he was 14 years old. This means that the prequel&#39;s final season will go beyond his years in Medford, Texas, and into his earliest days in Pasadena, California. Aside from a few flashbacks that revealed how he became friends with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, The Big Bang Theory never really showed how it was for Sheldon when he first moved to Pasadena. Now, Young Sheldon has the opportunity to do so and it should.





 1  The Cast Of Big Bang Theory Reuniting On-Screen 
Young Sheldon needs to have a full-circle moment with The Big Bang Theory.
        

When The Big Bang Theory ended in 2019, Young Sheldon came up with an organic but touching tribute to its parent show. Now that the prequel is wrapping up five years after its parent series capped off its 12-year run, a reunion of the Pasadena gang to help Sheldon finish his narration would be one of the best ways to cap the franchise&#39;s almost two decades on the network. A couple of Sheldon&#39;s adult friends have been on Young Sheldon before, but while having a complete reunion is ideal, getting Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki to return as Penny and Leonard would suffice.
        


 Young Sheldon
