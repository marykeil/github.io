## Literature Review

Avatar: The Last Airbender showrunner Albert Kim explains how Princess Azula&#39;s role has been adjusted for Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation.




Avatar: The Last Airbender showrunner Albert Kim addresses Princess Azula&#39;s (Elizabeth Yu) expanded role in the live-action adaptation. The upcoming Netflix show is an adaptation of the beloved Nickelodeon animated series that aired for three seasons from 2005 to 2009. In Avatar: The Last Airbender, two Southern Water Tribe siblings stumble across an Air Nomad child frozen in the ice who awakens and reveals himself to be the Avatar, a bender who can bring peace to the world in the wake of the Fire Nation&#39;s violent conquest.




When speaking to SFX Magazine (via GamesRadar&#43;) about Avatar: The Last Airbender&#39;s live-action adaptation, Kim addressed the decision to tie the character of Princess Azula into the events of season 1. With the character having an earlier debut, the showrunner stated he had the benefit of using what would later be revealed to create a more fleshed-out story that could set her up for taking on a major antagonistic role in later seasons. Check out Kim&#39;s response below:


&#34;We play to that. We know how big a character Azula becomes in the series, so we had the benefit of hindsight in fleshing out her character and being able to tell a story with her in it in season 1.&#34;



 Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender Could Feature A New Fire Nation Side Story 
          

While Azula was seen in season 1 of the animated series, it wasn&#39;t until season 2 that she would be fully characterized as she takes on the mission of recovering brother Zuko (Dallas Liu) and Iroh (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee). As such, Azula&#39;s season 1 appearance was limited to a flashback of Zuko being dishonored and scarred by their father, Fire Lord Ozai (Daniel Dae Kim), in an Agni Kai duel and the moment she received her mission. However, the cast and the trailer for Avatar: The Last Airbender hint at an expanded Fire Nation story.




                  3 Relationships The Live-Action Avatar Show Needs (That The Last Airbender Series Ignored)   Netflix’s live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender has the chance to revisit some of the show’s most beloved characters and make them even better.   

Alongside Azula and Ozai, Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender cast Momona Tamada and Thalia Tran as Ty Lee and Mai, Azula&#39;s companions in her mission. While Azula and Ozai were limited to cameos and brief scenes in season 1, Ty Lee and Mai didn&#39;t appear until season 2&#39;s &#34;Return to Omashu.&#34; Therefore, the live-action series may expand Zuko&#39;s flashback to fully characterize his relationships at home or feature a side-narrative set within the Fire Nation as they observe the prince&#39;s hunt for the Avatar. This would lay the groundwork for Aang&#39;s (Gordon Cormier) later travels.

While Avatar: The Last Airbender is a beloved story, its live-action adaptation has the opportunity to introduce Aang&#39;s tale to an all-new generation. Azula&#39;s incorporation into earlier events can help establish the world and dynamics of the Four Nations and those who live there to newcomers. While it may represent a deviation from the source material, Azula&#39;s new story could please existing audiences who wish to see more of the fan-favorite character explored on screen.






Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender will debut on the streaming service on February 22, 2024.
