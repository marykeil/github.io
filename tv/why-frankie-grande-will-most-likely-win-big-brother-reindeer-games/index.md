## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games contestant Frankie Grande has dominated the competitions so far. Here&#39;s why he&#39;ll most likely win the whole game.




Big Brother Reindeer Games contestant Frankie Grande has dominated the competitions so far, and he&#39;ll most likely win the whole game. Frankie, a 40-year-old actor from Los Angeles, California, placed 5th on Big Brother 16. He was a competition beast, winning five Head of Household and three Power of Veto competitions. If one includes his one Battle of the Block win, Frankie was tied with Janelle Pierzina and Michael Bruner for the most single-season wins with nine, a record that wasn&#39;t broken until Jag Bains won ten competitions during Big Brother 25.




During Big Brother Reindeer Games, Frankie was thrilled to see that his fellow Big Brother 16 competitors, Cody Calafiore and Nicole Franzel were playing the game with him. They quickly formed an alliance, but Frankie was careful to maintain his relationships with the other players--Britney Haynes, Cameron Hardin, Danielle Reyes, Josh Martinez, Taylor Hale, and Xavier Prather--as well. So far in Big Brother Reindeer Games, he has once again been excelling in competitions. Here&#39;s why Frankie will most likely win the whole game.

 Frankie Grande Is A Competition Beast 

 




Frankie is a fierce competitor, who went down in Big Brother history when he single-handedly won the Battle of the Block competition that his partner, Caleb Reynolds, tried to throw in order to evict Frankie. Frankie worked alone to emerge victorious against his fellow competitors, Donny Thompson and Zach Rance. It was a triumphant moment that proved that, even if Frankie had no allies in the game, he could always rely on himself to win.

So far during Big Brother Reindeer Games, Frankie won the first Jingle Bell Brawl. He also emerged victorious in the next two consecutive Santa Showdowns. During Big Brother Reindeer Games episode 3, Santa&#39;s Showdown was an elimination challenge. The contestants had to retrieve an ornament from a hamster wheel maze, using their bodies to move it through the maze. The first contestant would have five minutes and thirty seconds to complete the task. If they succeeded, they&#39;d then choose the next competitor, who would have one minute less to meet the challenge.




Because Nicole won the Jingle Bell Brawl, she had earned safety, and Frankie quickly convinced her to let him compete first. Although he had five minutes and thirty seconds, Frankie finished the task in two minutes and 49 seconds. He once again proved that he&#39;s not only physically strong, but incredibly smart.



 Frankie Grande Plays A Perfect Social Game 

 

Frankie appears to be everyone&#39;s friend on Big Brother Reindeer Games, but it&#39;s really all a part of his perfect social game strategy. Whenever anyone wins a competition, Frankie is the first person to congratulate them, giving them big bear hugs, and telling them how great they are. Now that his number one ally, Cody, is gone, Frankie will gravitate toward whichever houseguest has the power. Nicole was his best friend when she won the Jingle Bell Brawl, along with the power to let Frankie go first in Santa&#39;s Showdown. He&#39;ll be certain to befriend the next person in power as well, although there&#39;s a good chance that he&#39;ll earn all the power himself.






 Frankie Grande Is Strategic &amp; Not Emotional 

 

Part of the reason that Frankie is so successful in Big Brother Reindeer Games is because he plays with his head, rather than his heart. During Santa&#39;s Showdown, Frankie chose Xavier to compete after him. He figured that if Xavier didn&#39;t come back, he&#39;d get the credit for eliminating a strong player. However, if Xavier was successful, he&#39;d keep himself in Xavier&#39;s good graces, since those who played second would have a better chance of completing the challenge. He&#39;d then even offer to work with him. Xavier even admitted in his confessional that he was confused about whether Frankie was trying to help him or hurt him.

Throughout Big Brother Reindeer Games, Frankie has kept a cool head, and left his emotions out of his decisions in order to put himself in the best position moving forward. He is everyone&#39;s best friend, but he&#39;s really manipulating them emotionally. It&#39;s cutthroat gameplay, but it just might earn Frankie the $100,000 Big Brother Reindeer Games grand prize.
