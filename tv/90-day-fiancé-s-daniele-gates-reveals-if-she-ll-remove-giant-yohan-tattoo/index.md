## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Daniele Gates has a huge tattoo of Yohan Geronimo&#39;s name on her arm, which she hasn&#39;t removed despite their split.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Daniele Gates talked about the huge tattoo with Yohan Geronimo&#39;s name she has on her arm after a recent episode aired their split. Daniele is a 43-year-old woman from New York who found love while she was vacationing in the Dominican Republic. Daniele got married to 32-year-old Yohan five months later. He wanted to move to the U.S., but she left her NYC job and moved to La Romana, thus crushing her husband&#39;s big dreams. Yohan expected Daniele to pay his bills and take care of his expenses. He lashed out at her when she asked him to contribute to their rent.




In a fit of rage, Daniele ordered Yohan out of the apartment. Since Daniele and Yohan may have decided to end their marriage after the fight, there&#39;s been a lot of speculation over how Daniele will deal with his name that&#39;s been tattooed on her left arm.

          

Daniele shared a picture of the tattoo on her Instagram Story. It showed Yohan&#39;s first name written in cursive. The text extends from Daniele&#39;s inner arm to her wrist. Daniele added a caption saying she would never get the tattoo removed. She wrote, &#34;Sorry, guys – I actually think this is one of my prettier tattoos.&#34; Daniele added that the tattoo is not going &#34;anywhere.&#34;

 Daniele &amp; Yohan&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Daniele&#39;s Instagram Story could have hinted at her split with Yohan not being permanent. She may have decided to stay with him and fix things. All Yohan wanted when he married Daniele was to go to the U.S. He wished to find a job in America and make money to send his family. Daniele told Yohan she would apply for his spousal visa, but she didn&#39;t. He was shocked and upset when he found out what she had done. However, Daniele also wasn&#39;t fully certain about Yohan&#39;s intentions. There have been instances on 90 Day Fiancé where international partners have come to America and had affairs with other women.


 




Daniele could be insecure about her age and might be worried about Yohan leaving her for someone else. Besides, Yohan wanted a baby of his own, and Daniele&#39;s age was getting in the way of her getting pregnant. Daniele was running low on finances as she tried to set up her online yoga class business. Yohan lost his personal trainer and dance instructor jobs. He launched a meat business that also failed to work. Yohan started depending on Daniele for everything. He did get a job as a debt collector but didn&#39;t wish to spend the money on paying rent. Daniele asked Yohan to give her 75,000 pesos, though.

Daniele was furious when Yohan refused to split the expenses with her. She failed to realize that Yohan wanted her to spend lavishly on him and not the other way around. He called his life a horror story because he was getting nothing out of marrying an American woman. Yohan and Daniele&#39;s current relationship status is a mystery. It is also not known whether the couple now lives in the DR or the U.S. However, Daniele refusing to get rid of the ink with Yohan&#39;s name does suggest she could still be married to the man.






90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
