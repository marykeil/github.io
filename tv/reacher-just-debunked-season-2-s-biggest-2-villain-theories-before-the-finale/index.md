David O&#39;Donnell and Hortense Fields have been ruled out as secret villains, lacking evidence and connection to the investigations.

## Literature Review
In its penultimate episode, Reacher season 2 has effectively debunked all the biggest villain theories, setting up what may be a disappointing finale.





Summary

  Reacher season 2 has debunked all major villain theories, leaving no doubt about the main foe.   David O&#39;Donnell and Hortense Fields have been ruled out as secret villains, lacking evidence and connection to the investigations.   The lack of set-up for a compelling finale twist in Reacher season 2 is disappointing, with the focus now on Jack&#39;s revenge plan.  







Reacher season 2 has only one episode left, but it has already debunked all its major villain theories ahead of its finale. Jack Reacher&#39;s latest mission is already coming to an end, but unlike his case in Margrave, Georgia, his current endeavor, which involves the fate of his 110th Special Investigations Unit from his days in the military, its culmination is shaping up to be less compelling. More than two years since he helped Roscoe Conklin and Oscar Finlay take down the Kliners and their illegal operations, Jack finds himself recruited by Frances Neagley into a peculiar case, delving into the mysterious deaths of their fellow Special Investigators.

So far, Jack&#39;s main foe in Reacher season 2 is Shane Langston of New Age. Per Marlo Burns&#39; confession, the former police-turned-executive has been illegally selling weapons. AM, on the other hand, is functioning as the middleman between Langston and his buyers. The Nick Santora-created show is adapting Lee Child&#39;s 11th book from the series, but it takes some creative liberties to keep audiences hooked, making it difficult to predict how the show&#39;s sophomore year will end. That being said, considering everything that happens in Reacher season 2, episode 7, &#34;The Man Goes Through,&#34; and everything else before that, all of its biggest villain theories have now been squashed.




                  Amazon&#39;s Reacher Season 2 Is Beating S1 &amp; Tom Cruise&#39;s Movies In 1 Key Way   Despite having a few episodes left, Reacher season 2 has already beaten both its Amazon prequel and Tom Cruise&#39;s films in one particular aspect.     


 Reacher Season 2, Episode 7 Proves David O&#39;Donnell Is Not A Secret Villain 
O&#39;Donnell has been ruled out from the list of possible 110th traitors.
          

The 110th Special Investigations Unit is questioned in Reacher season 2 when Tony Swan became a suspected co-conspirator in New Age Technology, which led to the deaths of Calvin Franz, Manuel Orozco, and Jorge Sanchez. While the show piled on Swan, however, David O&#39;Donnell&#39;s actions started becoming questionable. He was quick to pass judgment on Swan while the rest of the team needed more time to process his potential betrayal. O&#39;Donnell also has the motive to partner with a corrupt corporation like New Age, considering that he has a growing family that he needs to support.




Before Jack, Neagley, and Karla Dixon even notice how suspicious O&#39;Donnell is acting, Reacher season 2 already rules him out as a traitor. After Guy Russo&#39;s emotional death in Reacher season 2, episode 6, &#34;New York&#39;s Finest,&#34; the squad splits up, leading to Dixon and O&#39;Donnell being captured by Langston. If O&#39;Donnell was dirty, it wouldn&#39;t make sense that he would be badly beaten. If anything, the theorized secret partnership should have already been revealed by now, since there&#39;s no reason to hide it anymore. This would clear the finale up for the fallout from that supposed betrayal, ensuring an even-paced resolution to all the mysteries in Reacher season 2.



 Reacher Season 2, Episode 7 Also Proves Hortense Fields Is Not A Secret Villain 
Hortense remains absent in Reacher season 2&#39;s present-day timeline.
          

Another potential secret villain in Reacher season 2 is Hortense Fields — the 110th Special Investigations Unit&#39;s old military supervisor. So far, the character has only been seen through flashbacks, but the show&#39;s penultimate episode offers additional context as to the kind of relationship he had with Jack and his team. As it turns out, they had a falling out towards the end after the Special Investigators disobeyed orders for them to turn a blind eye to the illegal drug operations in the military and cover up Operation Kite. This could have been additional proof that he is somehow linked to New Age and Langston.




That being said, aside from their final time working together in the military, there isn&#39;t any other concrete connection between Hortense and what&#39;s happening to the Special Investigators. At this point in the series, there should have been more clues to back up this idea, if Reacher season 2 is indeed setting him up as the narrative&#39;s secret villain. Unfortunately, not only is there no mounting evidence against him, but it&#39;s also too late in the series to start building him up as a master manipulator in cahoots with Langston without the reveal feeling rushed and unearned.

                  Reacher Season 3&#39;s Story Tease Fixes Season 2&#39;s Biggest Problem   Long before it premieres on Amazon, Reacher season 3&#39;s story tease will be able to address the biggest problem that is currently plaguing season 2.     



 Reacher Already Solved Season 2&#39;s Other Big Mystery 
Marlo Burns vindicated Swan.
          




The question about Swan&#39;s true identity is a great overall mystery for Reacher season 2. It forced Jack to reassess what he knows about the true bond of the 110th Special Investigations Unit, which he personally assembled. It also created conflict within the remaining team, with O&#39;Donnell becoming more convinced that Swan was to blame for the deaths of their other friends. Instead of leaning on it, however, the Amazon Prime Video series didn&#39;t wait until its final episode to resolve the mystery surrounding how Swan really fit into the picture.

Despite the increasing evidence incriminating Swan, Marlo Burns confessed the truth about the illegal operations in New Age, confirming that Swan is innocent in all of this. Instead, he was the one to blow the whistle on the anomaly, so he brought his fellow Special Investigators to further look into the matter. This led to their deaths once Langston discovered his secret was on the verge of being revealed. It&#39;s great that Jack and his team are finally relieved that their former teammate didn&#39;t betray them, but the way it was revealed was anti-climactic.






 Reacher Season 2 Has Failed To Set Up Any Big Finale Twists 
All that is left is for Jack to execute his revenge plan.
         

All things considered, Reacher season 2 hasn&#39;t set up any compelling finale twist. At this point, it has laid out all of its narrative cards on the table, and the only thing that has yet to happen is the actual revenge plot of Jack and his team. Considering the fact that Reacher season 3 is already in production, it&#39;s safe to say that the good guys will prevail — not that there have been any doubts about that given how popular the Amazon Prime Video series has been. Still, it&#39;s disappointing that there are no other significant mysteries that need to be resolved in the upcoming Reacher season 2 finale.

Even if there&#39;s a last-minute plot twist saved for the Reacher season 2 finale, the lack of setup from preceding episodes would likely result in it falling flat and unearned. For some reason, even if both seasons of the action-adventure series have the same number of episodes, it feels like not much has happened during its sophomore year compared to its predecessor. Until now, neither Jack nor anyone else in his team had even come face to face with AM, who&#39;s more menacing and capable compared to a more stereotypical evil corporate executive like Langston.






Reacher season 2 drops new episodes every Friday on Amazon Prime Video.
