## Literature Review
Jeremy Renner shares a behind-the-scenes image from the set of Mayor of Kingstown season 3, his first time back since his 2023 snowplow accident.




Mayor of Kingstown star Jeremy Renner has shared a behind-the-scenes image from the set of season 3. The show stars Renner as Mike McLusky, an important figure in the fictional town of Kingstown, Michigan, where the prison business creates a unique set of political circumstances that must be navigated. On January 1, 2023, just two weeks before the premiere of season 2, Renner was seriously injured in a snowplow accident, and although he has made a swift recovery in the proceeding year, the upcoming season 3 of the show is set to be his return to on-set acting.




On his official Instagram account, Renner shared a photo from his first day on the set of Mayor of Kingstown season 3. Check it out below:


 

The photo shows a dressed-up Renner sharing a tight smile while on set for the Paramount&#43; show, which was co-created by Taylor Sheridan and Hugh Dillon. The caption states that the star is &#34;nervous&#34; but hopes that he can &#34;ACTUALLY pull this off for our production and more importantly the fans.&#34;


 When Will Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Premiere? 
          

With production on the new season commencing now, this means that it will still be some time before season 3 premieres on Paramount&#43;. The show has already set a precedent for long hiatuses, as the gap between the Mayor of Kingstown season 1 finale and season 2 premiere was already slightly over a year. However, a wait of longer than a year is more or less inevitable, as the season 2 finale aired on March 19, 2023, and the new season will not be ready by then.




Typically, filming for previous seasons took place over the span of several months. As Renner expressed in his post, there is also some uncertainty that the star will be able to wrap production on his usual schedule as he is still in recovery while rejoining the Mayor of Kingstown cast. However, even if accommodations for his recovery don&#39;t impact the production timeline, and it follows the example of previous seasons, it seems unlikely that season 3 will finish production until at least May.



Production of Mayor of Kingstown season 1 took place between mid-May and early October in 2021, lasting nearly four months.




However, Mayor of Kingstown streaming premieres have typically come reasonably quickly after the season wrapped, perhaps due to their weekly release schedule allowing for additional post-production time on later episodes. So once season 3 is wrapped, it may only be between one and three months before the premiere episode debuts on Paramount&#43;. If that were to be the case, the new season may arrive as soon as late June or July.
