## Literature Review
Chicago Fire showrunner Andrea Newman teases that a new firefighter will be joining the Truck 81 team in the upcoming season 12 and bring trouble.




Chicago Fire&#39;s Truck 81 will be getting a shakeup in the new season of the One Chicago franchise show, which follows the Chicago Fire Department&#39;s fictional Firehouse 51. One of the major teams at the center of the show is Truck Company 81, which is commanded by Lieutenant Stella Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo) and has featured two dozen firefighters who have come and gone over the years. The most recent departure from the team was the short-lived floater Paul Muncell (Max Stewart), who was transferred to O&#39;Hare midway through season 11.




As part of the regular TVLine piece &#34;Matt&#39;s Inside Line,&#34; showrunner Andrea Newman followed up on a question about whether Chicago Fire season 12 will see another firefighter join Truck 81. Newman teases that there will indeed be a new firefighter joining the team, though &#34;not for the reasons anyone thinks.&#34; For better or for worse, &#34;the newbie will be trouble with a capital T.&#34; Read Newman&#39;s full quote below:


There will be a new firefighter joining Truck 81, but not for the reasons anyone thinks. Of course, the newbie will be trouble with a capital T — but is it the good kind or the bad kind? We’ll find out….



 Who Will Be Joining Truck 81 In Chicago Fire? 
          

At the time of writing, it is unknown exactly what troublesome new character will be joining the Truck 81 crew after the jam-packed Chicago Fire season 11 finale. As it currently stands, the team still includes Lieutenant Kidd, engineer Randall McHolland (Christian Stolte), and firefighters Blake Gallo (Alberto Rosende) and Sam Carver (Jake Lockett). However, Gallo is only slated to make an appearance in one episode of season 12 before departing the show.






Stolte is the longest-running cast member on the Truck 81 team, having appeared on the show for more than 200 episodes.




While new blood for Truck 81 is necessary, Newman likewise hasn&#39;t seen fit to confirm the actor who will be joining the team. However, it has already been confirmed that the Chicago Fire cast will be growing in season 12 after some recent shakeups, including two major departures and the return of Taylor Kinney as Severide. It&#39;s entirely possible that the already announced newcomer, How to Get Away with Murder&#39;s Rome Flynn, will play the character in question.

                  Every One Chicago Actor Leaving In 2024 (&amp; 1 Who Is Returning)   When the One Chicago shows – Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, and Chicago Med – return in 2024, the cast of each NBC series will look a little different.    

Flynn is set to play a new character named Jake Gibson on Chicago Fire season 12, an ex-boxer with a &#34;dark past.&#34; This character description would indeed seem to match Newman&#39;s tease of trouble. The character is also set to join season 12 in its second episode with a recurring role that could potentially expand, implying that he could be joining once Gallo officially makes his exit.
