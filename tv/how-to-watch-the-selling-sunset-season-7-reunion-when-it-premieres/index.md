## Literature Review
Selling Sunset&#39;s highly-anticipated season 7 reunion premieres soon. Get the details on when and where to watch the explosive reunion episode.




Selling Sunset season 7 was such a wild ride that Netflix decided to air a reunion episode. Seasons 6 and 7 of the hit reality TV series were renewed simultaneously, and the seasons felt like two installments of the same story. With all the drama in Selling Sunset season 7, it&#39;s only suitable for the stars of the Oppenheim Group to hash it out for their millions of ravenous viewers. When is the Selling Sunset season 7 reunion?




Selling Sunset season 7 was so jam-packed with drama that it&#39;s almost difficult to keep up with the different feuds and blowouts. Chelsea Lazkani and Bre Tiesi&#39;s fiery relationship reached a new pinnacle via the introduction of Playboy model turned real estate agent Cassandra Dawn. Additionally, Chrishell Stause couldn&#39;t catch a break between her awkward lunch with Jason Oppenheim&#39;s girlfriend, Marie-Lou, and her ongoing feud with Nicole Young. Amanza Smith got too involved by trying to remain neutral, and Jason and Brett Oppenheim even argued about expenses. All in all, it will be challenging to cover all the drama in one reunion episode.


 How Can Fans Watch The Selling Sunset Season 7 Reunion? 
          

The Selling Sunset season 7 reunion will stream on Wednesday, November 15, at 9 p.m. ET. Unlike the disastrous attempt at a live Love Is Blind reunion, the Selling Sunset reunion was pre-recorded. The ladies of the O Group dropped that there would be a reunion after the entire season&#39;s episodes aired on November 3. The advent of a reunion is a relief since there is so much drama for the ladies to air after two jam-packed seasons.






 What To Expect From The Selling Sunset Season 7 Reunion 
          

Queer Eye&#39;s Tan France will host what is expected to be an explosive reunion. Every major player from the season, excluding Cassandra Dawn, was seen in the trailer. Based on previews, Marie-Lou looks to have her chance to clear the air with Chrishell, who is putting out multiple fires at once. Jason may be forced to choose between his ex and colleague and his girlfriend. Chelsea and Bre will hash it out, and Emma is seen being shocked for the entirety of the reunion.

Selling Sunset season 7 was one of the most explosive yet. Even without former cast members such as Davina Potratz, Heather Rae El Moussa, and Christine Quinn, the show continues to bring drama every season. Whether the reunion makes relationships on Selling Sunset better or worse remains to be seen, but the interactions will undoubtedly lead to more than one onscreen blowout.






The Selling Sunset season 7 reunion on Netflix will air on Wednesday, November 15, at 9 p.m. ET.
