The poisoning of Winnie raises the stakes and makes the investigation personal for Oliver, who suspects Sting but later discovers he wasn&#39;t the one responsible.

## Literature Review
Only Murders in the Building usually wraps up its whodunit storylines, but one mystery was left hanging: what happened to Oliver&#39;s dog Winnie?




This article contains spoilers for Only Murders in the Building season 1.




Only Murders in the Building is usually very meticulous about wrapping up its whodunit storylines, but the show left one mystery thread hanging: what happened to Oliver’s dog Winnie? Only Murders in the Building stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as a trio of true-crime podcasters who keep ironically finding themselves wrapped up in murder cases that affect people they know. Martin plays Charles-Haden Savage, the semi-retired star of an old detective show from the ‘90s, Short plays Oliver Putnam, an ambitious but down-on-his-luck Broadway director, and Gomez plays Mabel Mora, an aspiring artist and amateur sleuth.

Since it premiered in 2021, Only Murders in the Building has been a big hit on the Hulu streaming service. Now, in an attempt to attract new viewers to the series, Disney is airing its first season on ABC (much like Viacom did with its Paramount&#43; hit Yellowstone on CBS). The first batch of episodes airing on ABC ends with a shocking cliffhanger involving Oliver’s adorable bulldog, Winnie. While most of the cliffhangers in Only Murders in the Building eventually get paid off in a later episode, the Winnie cliffhanger in season 1 remains unresolved. However, there are enough clues to piece it together.

 What Happened To Winnie The Dog In Only Murders In The Building

Winnie is Oliver’s beloved pet bulldog, who has lived with him since long before the series started. Oliver likes to pamper Winnie and, rather than walking her on a leash, he pushes her around in a stroller like a baby. In season 1, episode 3, “How Well Do You Know Your Neighbors?,” while Charles, Oliver, and Mabel are trying to figure out who murdered Tim Kono, Oliver finds a threatening note pinned to the door of his apartment. And not only that; Winnie has been poisoned, and Oliver assumes it must have been the same person who left the note and killed Tim.

The cliffhanger at the end of episode 3 made it seem like Winnie would die in the next episode, but thankfully, that didn’t happen. At the beginning of season 1, episode 4, “The Sting,” it’s revealed that, fortunately, Winnie did not die from the poisoning. After Winnie was poisoned, Oliver managed to get her to his son Will, who is a vet, in time to save her. Will treated Winnie for the poisoning and she recovered shortly thereafter. Oliver&#39;s son Will fulfilled his duties as a vet and took care of her as she recovered from the poison. Oliver was, of course, massively relieved that his beloved bulldog pulled through.

The poisoning was still an important plot point, because it raised the stakes and made the investigation personal. Just before finding the note on his door, Oliver saw Sting in the elevator and suspected that he might be responsible for Tim’s murder. All throughout episode 4, Oliver was certain that it was Sting who had poisoned his dog, and he enlisted Charles and Mabel’s help to find solid evidence that Sting had both poisoned Winnie and killed Tim. It turned out Sting was Tim’s former stockbroker, and they did have a heated disagreement, but he wasn’t the one who killed him.






 Only Murders In The Building Never Reveals Who Poisoned Winnie The Dog 
It&#39;s one of the show&#39;s few unresolved mysteries
          

While the mystery of Tim Kono’s death was solved by the end of Only Murders in the Building season 1, the mystery of who poisoned Winnie the dog remained unsolved. Jan was a poisoner, but she seemed more likely to poison a fellow human being than an innocent dog. Teddy Dimas often used threats to make a point, so he might have left the note on Oliver’s door, but there’s no evidence that he’s cold-hearted enough to poison a dog. Detective Daniel Kreps is certainly suspicious, but the series’ timeline doesn’t line up to place Kreps as the culprit in the poisoning.

At the end of Only Murders in the Building season 1, Mabel refers to some “loose ends” left up in the air. This was likely a self-aware reference to the fact that the identity of Winnie’s poisoner – and whoever left the menacing notes on Oliver and Jan’s apartment doors – remained unresolved. The writers may have left some loose ends and unanswered questions because Charles, Oliver, and Mabel have only just started their podcast and didn’t have much investigative experience yet. It makes sense that, in their very first murder investigation, they wouldn’t manage to tie up every single loose end.
