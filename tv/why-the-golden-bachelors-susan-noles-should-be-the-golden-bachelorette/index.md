## Literature Review
Golden Bachelor contestant Susan Noles didn&#39;t find love with Gerry Turner, but she should get a second chance as the star of The Golden Bachelorette.




The Golden Bachelor contestant and fan favorite Susan Noles didn&#39;t find love with leading man Gerry Turner, but she deserves a second chance and should be the first leading lady of The Golden Bachelorette. Susan is a 66-year-old wedding officiant from Aston, Pennsylvania. She also had a longtime career as a hair and makeup artist. In addition, Susan has a company, Nuptials by Noles, which offers unique modern or traditional wedding ceremonies. Susan&#39;s ex-husband is retired MLB player, Dickie Noles. Together they share three children and six grandchildren.




Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Susan and Gerry had a connection. At the episode 4 cocktail party before the rose ceremony, Gerry even gave Susan a piece of rose quartz. He explained that empathy and strength are attributed to that type of stone, and he felt that Susan has both of those qualities. They reminded him so much of his late wife, Toni. They then shared a passionate kiss. Although they had a bit of a romantic spark, Susan and Gerry&#39;s relationship was more of a great friendship, and he eventually eliminated her. Now Susan should be the first Golden Bachelorette for the following reasons.

 Susan Has A Kind Heart 

 

Susan has one of the biggest hearts of all of the Golden Bachelor contestants. She was a true friend to all of the women, doing their hair and makeup for their dates. She also was genuinely upset when one of them was eliminated or had to leave for personal reasons. Having empathy for others is an important quality for the leads of dating shows because they have to be able to relate to so many different types of people. Susan&#39;s kindness and genuine personality would make her the ideal Golden Bachelorette.






 Susan Is Hilarious 

 

The Golden Bachelorette would have to be an entertaining show, and Susan is the perfect person to take the lead. Susan is absolutely hilarious, and created some of the funniest moments on the show. During The Golden Bachelor &#34;The Women Tell All&#34; special, she proved that she doesn&#39;t take herself too seriously when the episode devoted an entire segment to the mystery of what caused her to have bad gas. She was even shown laughing while telling Gerry about her problem, which made him laugh heartily. Susan&#39;s ability to laugh at herself and have genuine fun are two qualities that would help her navigate the sometimes serious world of Bachelor Nation shows.



 Susan Wasn’t In Love With Gerry Turner 

 




Although Susan and Gerry clearly love and respect each other as friends, Susan didn&#39;t fall in love with Gerry. This is important because the lead of a follow-up show, such as The Golden Bachelorette, shouldn&#39;t still be thinking about her ex when she takes on that role. What Susan gained from The Golden Bachelor was the knowledge that she was able to open herself up to someone to try to find love again. However, since she didn&#39;t find that love with Gerry, she doesn&#39;t come with any previous baggage.



 Susan Is Open To Finding Love Again 

 

Susan has proven that she&#39;s open to finding love again. She would jump into her role as The Golden Bachelorette with gusto, embracing the opportunity to meet the next great love of her life. She didn&#39;t seem to have the same sorts of guards up as some of the other women, and was therefore easy for everyone to get to know. This is an essential quality for the leads of dating shows because they have to be willing to make themselves vulnerable. Susan has proven that she&#39;s ready to take that leap.




                  Why The Golden Bachelor’s Gerry Turner Should Choose Theresa Nist   Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry chose Leslie for one of his Final 2 women, and is torn between Theresa and Faith. Here&#39;s why he should choose Theresa.    

From Susan&#39;s karate demonstration at the Golden Bachelor talent show to her cooking, she has proven to be a multi-faceted woman who would be the ideal lead of her own show. She&#39;s beautiful, kind, funny, and open to finding love. If ABC decides to move forward with The Golden Bachelorette, Susan would be the perfect leading lady.

The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.
