## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Daniele Gates has &#34;multiple positions open&#34; for her next &#34;life partner.&#34; One needs to share a reference letter from their ex to apply.




Daniele Gates has opened a position for a &#34;life partner&#34; after her split from Yohan Geronimo was confirmed at the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell-All. Daniele, 43, first starred on 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise when she was getting married to the fit and tall personal trainer Yohan, whom she&#39;d met on a trip to the Dominican Republic. Daniele had told Yohan they would live together in America after their wedding. Still, she left her teaching job to move to the DR. Daniele began her journey as a holistic wellness coach and organized retreats to earn a living. Yohan, meanwhile, hit on her clients.




After declaring she was going to divorce Yohan for having physical relations with some of her clients, apart from the 50-plus mistresses he had, during the reunion, Daniele shared a confusing post on Instagram.


 

Daniele wrote, &#34;Applications are now being accepted for the role of a &#39;life partner&#39; in the LiveYinsa collective. Multiple positions available.&#34; Daniele then mentioned that she was looking for someone over the age of 35 to be her life partner and someone who&#39;s been in a &#34;meaningful relationship&#34; that has lasted for more than five years. Daniele asked interested people to submit a cover letter, a resume, and a reference letter from their ex.

Reddit user EnvironmentalEmu8089 reposted Daniele&#39;s advertisement for others to see, where fans expressed their confusion at the post. &#34;What in the world is she doing? Looking for a poly relationship??? Starting a sex cult? Trying to find a boyfriend/girlfriend but treating it as a business proposition!?&#34; asked Msjwayne, while Yogabbagabba2341 wrote, &#34;She’s trying to be clever, but yeah, the multiple positions open part caught my eye.&#34; BettieNuggs wanted to know if Daniele is a &#34;reverse sanky panky,&#34; and Pomsky_party commented, &#34;Wait did she watch Escaping Twin Flames last night?&#34; In a nutshell, Daniele left a lot of fans confused with the nature of her post.

Daniele tried to convince her followers that she wasn&#39;t playing a prank on them by writing, &#34;You think I’m kidding.&#34; Daniele will have her &#34;virtual assistant&#34; vet the applications she receives. It&#39;s quite likely that Daniele doesn&#39;t wish to have another failed relationship in her life. Her husband Yohan felt betrayed by her when she didn&#39;t fulfill her promise to take him to the U.S. Moreover, Daniele expected him to contribute to the household expenses while he was looking for a sugar mama, which was why he married an American woman. Yohan kept his options open on the side because he had also been seeing a woman a month before he married Daniele.




Yohan contacted multiple other women on social media and told them that he was single and going through a divorce. One such woman named Memori was invited to the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell-All, but Yohan claimed he didn&#39;t have any memory of her. Daniele&#39;s next best option to find a life partner may have been to join 90 Day: The Single Life, but for now, she seems to be interested in conducting a Bachelorette-style event for herself where she will choose who she wants to date and marry next based on how impressive their resumes are.
