## Literature Review
Robyn Brown is the last wife standing on Sister Wives. Here&#39;s why she and Kody Brown will choose to remain monogamous.




Robyn Brown is the last wife standing on Sister Wives, and there are many reasons to believe she and Kody Brown will remain monogamous. Kody and Robyn&#39;s relationship arguably led to the downfall of his relationships with Christine Brown, Meri Brown, and Janelle Brown, all of whom have left Kody. While Robyn only joined the family in 2010, Meri and Kody tied the knot in 1990, with Christine and Janelle following behind in 1993 and 1994. The introduction of Robyn coincided with their stardom on a reality TV show, and disaster followed.




Despite the introduction of Robyn causing trouble in the Brown family, Robyn blames Kody for their family issues. Nevertheless, after over a year of drama surrounding Christine, Janelle, and Meri leaving their plural marriage, it&#39;s becoming more likely that Kody and Robyn will embrace monogamy rather than introduce a new wife to their fragile marriage. While Robyn and Kody&#39;s marriage might not work without polygamy, introducing new wives might be an even worse idea. With every passing day, the likelihood of monogamy grows stronger.

According to People, Kody has given up on polygamy and is ready to commit to monogamy. Kody openly declared during the Sister Wives: One-On-One episode that he &#34;wouldn&#39;t be interested&#34; in introducing a new wife to his relationship with Robyn, even if she were the one to recruit her. &#34;I would have to tell that woman I will never love you as much as I love her. Now I know better,&#34; the Brown family patriarch remarked. Kody hasn&#39;t been straightforward with his thoughts on monogamy moving forward until now, making his statement extraordinarily significant. While there was speculation throughout Sister Wives season 18 that Kody wouldn&#39;t want to embark on a journey of finding more wives again, he didn&#39;t outright say it until late December 2023.

However, Robyn had different thoughts in the Sister Wives: One-On-One episode. Robyn expressed insecurity surrounding her ability to find happiness with Kody after Meri, Christine, and Janelle chose to leave him, saying, &#34;It&#39;s weird. To be loving and respectful to Kody, I want to say yes, but I just don&#39;t know how this works exactly,&#34; concluding, &#34;It&#39;s weird. I feel like it&#39;s disrespectful.&#34; Additionally, Robyn requested her former sister wives grant her their blessing off-camera to remain monogamous, which she has yet to receive.






 Robyn Essentially Tricked Kody Into Monogamy 
Isn&#39;t Robyn Just Getting What She Wanted?
         

Robyn&#39;s apprehension toward monogamy is fascinating, considering she basically tricked Kody into a monogamous relationship, leading to the erosion of his marriages with Janelle, Meri, and Christine. Kody stated in the past that he never intended to abandon polygamy and that he entered into a monogamous relationship with Robyn out of love and a desire to provide a stable home for her and her three children. He has also expressed frustration with the label of being tricked into monogamy, stating that he was an active participant in the decision to make their relationship exclusive, and he didn&#39;t choose for three of his four wives to leave him.

However, the shift from polygamy to monogamy happened over the years and could be viewed as unintentional. Many factors caused the increasing emotional distance between Kody and his other wives. As Kody&#39;s relationship with Robyn grew stronger, he spent less time with his other wives, leading to resentment and conflict, reaching a fever pitch during the COVID-19 pandemic. Robyn&#39;s assertion that she would only agree to marry Kody if he were to adopt her three children from her previous marriage legally forced Kody and Meri to divorce legally, which was also viewed as an early tipping point. This decision further complicated the dynamics within the family and made it more challenging to maintain a plural marriage.






 Janelle Believes Kody And Robyn Will Remain Monogamous 
Robyn Might Be In Denial, But Janelle Isn&#39;t
         

In Sister Wives: One-On-One, Janelle expressed that Kody and Robyn will likely remain monogamous long-term. When asked by host Sukanya Krishnan if Kody would take another wife, Janelle seemed dubious. &#34;He&#39;s now talking increasingly about, &#39;As we move forward into monogamy.&#39; So, I think that&#39;s where he&#39;s headed,&#34; Janelle answered. She continued by saying, &#34;I do not foresee it. If I did, I&#39;ll bet you $1,000 right now and you come find me. If he does, I will give you $1,000.&#34; This was a strong assertion from Kody&#39;s former wife, considering his inability to commit to an answer.

Despite Janelle&#39;s assertions, Robyn seemed unsure during the One-On-One questioning. Robyn has acknowledged that she initially agreed to a plural marriage but later came to control Kody in a way that made it seem she desired monogamy. She has also expressed some regret about how things have turned out, stating that she feels &#34;trapped&#34; into a monogamist relationship that she never truly desired, despite being a contributing factor in driving out Kody&#39;s other wives.






 Bringing In Another Wife After All The TV Drama Would Be Difficult 
Who Would Want To Join The Brown Family?
          

Logistically, the Brown family has simply become too famous to bring in another sister wife. When Kody married Meri, Christine, and Janelle in the 1990s, the family strove to keep their polygamous lifestyle hidden. Robyn was introduced to the family around the time Sister Wives began to develop, and ultimately, their fame and Robyn&#39;s desire to control Kody and assert herself as the primary wife ruined the Brown family dynamic.

Even if Kody wanted to bring another wife into the family, she would have to agree to constant surveillance from the network and production, putting her entire courtship with Kody on display. Additionally, it would be difficult to filter through women who were simply interested in becoming Kody&#39;s next wife because of reality TV clout rather than a genuine interest in the polygamist lifestyle.






 Kody Put His Foot Down With Robyn 
Kody Always Has The Final Say
          

While Robyn has expressed reticence towards Kody&#39;s move to monogamy, she will always defer to Kody in the end. Kody is the patriarch of the Brown family, and Robyn listens to him in the end. Additionally, Kody and Robyn&#39;s love for each other seems genuinely strong, and she wouldn&#39;t leave him just because he refused to take another wife. In fact, Kody might love Robyn more than he ever loved his other wives, which is why he wants to focus only on her and her children. While this is a terrible situation for his children with Meri, Christine, and Janelle, it&#39;s ultimately the situation Robyn sought throughout 18 seasons of Sister Wives. With Kody&#39;s love for Robyn, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to bring in another wife, which he acknowledged. Kody will unlikely take on another wife, thus ending his decades-long foray into plural marriage.
