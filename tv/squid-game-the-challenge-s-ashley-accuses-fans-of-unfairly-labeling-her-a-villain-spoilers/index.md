## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Ashley is being called out for her behavior during the Glass Bridge game. See how she responds to being labeled a villain.




Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Ashley Tolbert, player 278, received backlash for the way she handled herself in the Glass Bridge game, but she’s speaking out about her portrayal on the show and the reception of her behavior. During one of the most high-stakes games of Squid Game: The Challenge season 1, Ashley chose to put her game before the rest of the group’s, despite saying she’d be a team player. When Mai Whelan, player 287, called her out for her behavior, she was slammed by her fellow contestants, but the cast’s perception of Mai, Ashley, and the situation at large didn&#39;t go over well online.




In an interview with EW, Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s Ashley Tolbert spoke about her villain status and the way she’s being perceived by fans watching the show. When asked about how she felt when Mai targeted her for her actions during Glass Bridge, Ashley explained that she initially thought Mai nominating her was a joke. “I understand her perspective,” Ashley shared, explaining that Mai’s actions may not have seemed serious to her, but “[the viewers aren&#39;t] upset with Mai. Why am I the villain, but I&#39;m essentially playing the game the same way that other people have been playing the game?”

Ashley’s decisions on Squid Game: The Challenge have been highly debated, so she explained her detailed thought process throughout Glass Bridge to EW. While the game wasn’t exactly what viewers saw on Squid Game: The Challenge, the sentiment that Ashley chose not to go with the group’s decision was similar. She explained, “Somebody has to be the villain, and it lands on me for not taking an extra jump...I stand by it—I would do it again. I made it across the bridge and I used what I had to get what I want.” Ashley shared the harsh truth, that Squid Game: The Challenge “wasn&#39;t a team effort.” 





 

While Ashley may not have done the most compassionate thing during Glass Bridge, she was looking out for herself in the way most other Squid Game: The Challenge players were doing as well. Though it appeared on-screen that the majority of players had chosen to try and work together, there were apparently several who didn’t like the idea of potentially giving up their game so everyone had a fairer chance at making it through the challenge. Though Ashley was portrayed as a villain, her decision to play the game selfishly wasn’t villainous. She was advocating for herself, and while it wasn’t respected, it was a strategic game move.

Despite the vitriol surrounding Ashley’s decisions on Glass Bridge, her time on Squid Game: The Challenge ultimately came to an end during Circle Of Trust. The player may not have won the $4.56 million grand prize, but she came away from Squid Game: The Challenge with a newfound understanding of herself from a player’s perspective. Keeping herself alive in the competition for nearly the entire time, Squid Game: The Challenge tested Ashley in more ways than one.

The Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 finale streams Wednesday, December 6 on Netflix.
