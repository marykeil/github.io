## Literature Review
Sister Wives star Christine Brown reveals the unexpected pair of his and hers shoes that she and David Woolley wore for their wedding rehearsal.




Sister Wives star Christine Brown and David Woolley’s choice of footwear for their rehearsal dinner was very unexpected. Christine, 51, used to be polygamist reality TV star Kody Brown’s third wife. Christine and Kody were in a plural marriage since their spiritual union in March 1994, but they never made it legal. Kody and Christine welcomed six kids together and split after 25 years. She met David online in October 2022 and in person two months later. By Valentine’s Day 2023, Christine was showing off her new boyfriend to the world. She admitted she was already looking at wedding dresses within a month of meeting him.




It&#39;s not known whether Christine was also looking at the shoes she and David would wear to their rehearsal dinner.


 

A rehearsal dinner is a pre-wedding event that traditionally takes place the night before the big day. Christine decided to keep things comfy for the occasion while also surprising her future husband. Christine revealed “For our wedding rehearsal dinner, we surprised David by wearing crocs. He LOVES crocs!” She wrote that they “truly decorated” the pair for David and called it an “awesome surprise.” Christine showed photos of her white pair of classic clogs and a matching black pair for David.

Both Christine and David’s shoes were decorated with a variety of Jibbitz charms, which could have signified the things that were their personal favorites. Christine had a Minnie Mouse pumpkin charm, a set of Disney villains showing Ursula and Maleficent, along with a blingy rhinestone chain. David’s pair was studded with several famous pop culture characters, such as Groot, ET, Yoda, and Rocket Raccoon. Christine told her followers they could visit the link in her bio to find similar fashions and “other things we found that made our day magical!” Someone in Christine’s comments section wrote, “Who wouldn’t love a guy who loves Crocs?”


 




Meanwhile, Christine also posted photos to show what happened “behind the scenes” at her bridal party before the wedding day. Christine thanked Eliza Schmidt for doing her wedding makeup. She said she felt “so beautiful” on her special day thanks to the glam. The photos showed Christine’s wedding preparations going in full swing following the release of her wedding special episode with David. Some of David’s daughters also attended the party with Christine. One of David’s daughters, Raegan, has also called Christine “bossy,” but it looks like they all get along very well together.

David is a business owner from Utah. He was previously married to Margaret Lucille Sulin Woolley. They were together for 20 years. David has eight children and 10 grandchildren. David and Christine said, “I do,” on October 7, 2023, in Moab, Utah. Christine had invited her close female friends over for some pampering on the morning of her wedding rehearsal. Her daughters, David’s daughters, Janelle Brown, and others got facials, and Christine got a hair and makeup trial. The wedding rehearsal for the Sister Wives star followed with their families in attendance, and Christine’s daughter Aspyn Thompson oversaw making sure everything ran smoothly for the occasion.
