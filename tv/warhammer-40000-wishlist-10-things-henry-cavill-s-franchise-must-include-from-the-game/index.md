## Literature Review
Henry Cavill&#39;s Warhammer 40,000 is confirmed and in development. As exciting as the news is, there are certain things the adaptation must include.




With Henry Cavill attached as a producer on the upcoming Warhammer 40,000 live-action adaptation, there are a handful of things audiences familiar with the source material can expect when it eventually comes to fruition. Based on the Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) of the same name, Warhammer 40,000 is a universally known series that sees its players engage in tense battles as space marines in a dystopian wasteland. While viewers have seen live-action RPG adaptations before with 2016&#39;s Warcraft and the more recent Halo TV series, Warhammer 40,000 is sure to set itself apart by bringing the series&#39; compelling and rich lore to life.
Another reason Warhammer 40,000 has the potential to be a successful adaptation of its source material is the fact that Henry Cavill is a huge fan of the Warhammer 40,000 series, and his roles as a producer as well as its star strongly suggest he&#39;ll do everything in his power to make the adaptation as faithful to its source material as possible. With Warhammer 40,000 in development since late 2022, it seems as though the adaptation is being handled carefully, thus ensuring audiences that Amazon Studios is more concerned about quality over quantity when adding new titles to their library. Nevertheless, there are a handful of things Warhammer 40,000 needs to include.
            
 
 How Will Henry Cavill&#39;s Warhammer 40,000 Franchise Actually Work? 
As fascinating as a Warhammer live-action franchise, with Henry Cavill as its lead, may sound on paper, it is hard not to wonder how it will work.













 








 10  Impressive Special Effects 
Warhammer 40,000 is filled with unique and engaging locations that will require a good budget to depict accurately
        

Warhammer 40,000&#39;s video games boast impressive visuals to aid in telling the franchise&#39;s complex stories, thus its live-action adaptation would require a similar, if not better, attention to detail to rival its source material. While the Warhammer 40,000 franchise doesn&#39;t have a typical protagonist like other franchises in its genre, it does feature a plethora of stunning locations and otherworldly characters, so the Warhammer 40,000 live-action TV series would need a strong effects budget to accurately depict its source material&#39;s landscapes. Additionally, the budget would need to be distributed to the action sequences to properly depict the impact that the horrors of war has on its many unique characters.





 9  Warhammer 40,000 Needs To Maintain The Franchise&#39;s Engaging Action 
Warhammer 40,000&#39;s action is just as engaging as its themes and plot twists
        

As seen throughout the Warhammer 40,000 video games, the franchise thrives on its intense and compelling action scenes. Whether it be a Space Marine utilizing a chainsaw against a plethora of foes or the Armies of Chaos using their vast range of weapons to eliminate their foes, Warhammer 40,000&#39;s adaptation must include convincing fight scenes. Aside from the excitement one experiences from watching a well-choreographed fight scene, a great one can enhance a story&#39;s themes by literally showing warring factions fight for what they believe in. With Cavill&#39;s commitment to accuracy and his action scenes in The Witcher, Warhammer 40,000&#39;s action should be one of its greatest strengths.





 8  The Xenos 
The Xenos are the alien factions in Warhammer 40,000 and push the storylines in interesting directions
        

Among one of Warhammer 40,000&#39;s more interesting elements is the franchise&#39;s unique handling of different races or factions as seen throughout the various Warhammer media. In simplest terms, the Xenos refer to any non-human alien species, and the Aeldari or Eldar, Drukhair or Dark Eldar, T&#39;au Empire, Tyranids, Space Orks, Necrons, and the Leagues of Votann comprise the large faction. The Xenos are renowned for their high intelligence, advancements in technology, and allegiance to themselves, thus making them among one of Warhammer 40,000&#39;s strongest factions. Additionally, the ongoing war against the Xenos is one of the best ways the Warhammer show can highlight its central themes and dark setting.





 7  The Imperium of Man 
Great way to introduce the various factions in Warhammer 40,000


 







The Imperium of Man&#39;s inclusion in Warhammer 40,000 is essential, as the faction is arguably the one most suited for getting casual audiences on board with the franchise&#39;s expansive lore. The Adeptus Astartes (better known as Space Marines), Adeptus Custodes, Astra Militarum of the Imperial Guard, Adepta Sororita or Sisters of Battle, Adeptis Mechanicus, Imperial Knights, and the Inquisition make up the Imperium of Man. The Imperium of Man is currently the largest and most powerful political entity in the galaxy, and their goal of preserving mankind through the treacherous dystopia provides a strong basis for audiences to follow early on in Warhammer 40,000.





 6  The Armies of Chaos 
The Armies of Chaos are the greatest threat to the Imperium of Man
        

The Armies of Chaos are perhaps one of the most intimidating factions in the Warhammer franchise, consisting of the Chaos Space Marines and the Chaos Knights, and they serve as the primary force of antagonism against the Imperium of Man. Furthermore, the Armies of Chaos have Chaos Gods&#39;s Khorne, the god of war and murder, Nurgle, the god of plague and decay, Slaanesh, the god of hedonism and pleasure, and Tzeentch, the god of change and magic, have the most power in the faction. The Armies of Chaos have an unquenchable thirst for power and destruction, thus making their appearance in Warhammer 40,000 tantamount to excellent, long-lasting conflict.

 5  The Pre-Heresey Era 
Arguably the best way to start the show since it sets up many key characters and plot points
        

Since the Warhammer franchise debuted in 1987 and is constantly receiving updates, expansions, etc., a great challenge lies in Amazon Studios selecting a time period to depict the live-action adaptation&#39;s events. However, the Pre-Heresey era could be a great place to start as it would depict the creation of the Primarchs, that is, the twenty genetically-engineered transhuman sons of the Emperor of Mankind. From here, the Warhammer 40,000 adaptation could depict the various Primarchs&#39; personalities, and it could establish the lore, setting, and mechanics of the show. The downside is that it occurs well before Warhammer 40,000&#39;s events, but it could leave room for Amazon Studios to reinterpret things.





 4  The Horus Heresey Era 
The Horus Heresey Era is arguably the most well-known era in Warhammer 40,000
        

Arguably the most iconic era in the Warhammer franchise, the Horus Heresey era largely consists of the civil war between Horus and the Emperor. In it, Horus and his army wipe out billions of people on his bloodthirsty quest to overthrow the Emperor of Mankind and take his place as the supreme ruler. While the Horus Heresey era has already seen plenty of book adaptations, its familiar subject and good vs. evil-esque themes can work well for casual and long-supporting viewers. Furthermore, the Horus Heresey era lasts a while, so this would provide Amazon Studios with plenty of material to cover while introuding new themes and characters along the way.





 3  Ciaphas Cain 
Ciaphas Cain would allow the writers to take some liberties with the source material in interesting ways


 







Although it&#39;s tough to argue the Warhammer franchise boasts any straightforward heroes, Ciaphas Cain is arguably the closest thing to a hero the Warhammer franchise has. Ciaphas is depicted as a strong, handsome, and personable commissar of the Officio Prefectus whose bravery and skill earned him the distinction of being one of the most notable heroes of the Imperium of Man. Although formidable on the battlefield, Ciaphas&#39; discipline and incredible social acumen provide glimpses of what the best of humanity can be in a series rife with bleak themes and ruthless characters. Ciaphas&#39; inclusion in Warhammer 40,000 could enhance the action while displaying the complexity of the series&#39; lore.





 2  The Emperor of Mankind 
His inclusion would help establish the show&#39;s lore
        

Also known as the God-Emperor, the Emperor of Mankind is the monarch of the Imperium of Man and is the predetermined guardian and god of humanity. Given the nature of his role, Warhammer&#39;s version of humanity spawned from the Emperor of Mankind, and his role as a psyker, that is, an incredibly wise and intelligent being, makes him responsible for the lives of all of his creations. Among his key decisions is his decision to sacrifice his immortality at the climax of the Horus Heresey to preserve mankind. Warhammer 40,000 would need to depict him properly as much of the lore&#39;s conflict stems from factions wanting to take his place.





 1  Grim Dark Lore Depicted Properly 
Grim Dark&#39;s bleak and atmospheric tone can be big innovations in live-action adaptations


 







The Warhammer franchise is known for its reputation for depicting bleak and hopeless themes to demonstrate the nature of evil. Although some characters like Ciaphas and the Emperor of Mankind have more altruistic traits than others, the series ultimately thrives on depicting the depths anyone can go to in order to accomplish a mission or goal. If Warhammer 40,000 maintains the franchise&#39;s dark tone, it can set itself apart from more optimistic war stories. Although Warhammer 40,000 is still in development, Cavill&#39;s behind the scenes role suggests that the Warhammer 40,000 TV series will be as faithful to the source material as possible.
