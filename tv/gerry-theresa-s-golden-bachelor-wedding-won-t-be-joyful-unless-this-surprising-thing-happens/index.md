## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist are keeping their fingers crossed for a major surprise during the much-awaited televised wedding.




Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist from The Golden Bachelor are praying for a miracle to happen at their wedding. Gerry was selected as the first-ever Golden Bachelor in July 2023. He went on to meet and mingle with 22 women, who all vied for the attention of the 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana. Theresa, 70, and Leslie Fhima, 64, made it to the finale. Gerry had said, &#34;I love you,&#34; to both women, but he needed to know who was going to be his next wife. In the end, Gerry made his final decision and proposed to Theresa in Costa Rica during the finale.




Gerry and fiancée Theresa will soon be husband and wife on The Golden Wedding on ABC, and the couple told People what they are expecting from the ceremony. &#34;Both of us are looking forward to some of the element of surprise,” Gerry told the publication. They didn&#39;t get too involved and didn&#39;t overplan because they thought there wouldn&#39;t have been as much joy for them. &#34;We trust our children and their good judgment,&#34; Gerry added. He and Theresa have full faith in the things that their kids have done in the past, which reinforced their humor, their judgment, and their sensitivity to Gerry and Theresa&#39;s situation.

 Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry Turner Refuses to Reveal Honeymoon Details 
          




Gerry has given them “free rein.” He’s looking forward to when he and Theresa will see things unfold. “I think that&#39;ll be the greatest fun,” he added. Meanwhile, Theresa revealed that she’s even told her 6-year-old grandson Henry, “Say whatever you want.” Meanwhile, Gerry and Theresa have also revealed some secrets about their wedding ceremony. “Very elegant but not stuffy” is how Gerry described the wedding, which is about to take place in Southern California. Theresa added that she’s picked “all pale colors of pinks and peaches.” Golden flowers are being used as accents, which will give the venue a “very light and airy look.”


 

However, Gerry and Theresa are not yet ready to reveal where they’re heading for their honeymoon. They might be taking a mini-moon. “But I don’t want to let that out,” Gerry added. He believes that once the location is revealed, people will be “looking for that” and asking them questions about it. He wants a little bit of anonymity and is waiting for things to “settle down.” Until then, Gerry and Theresa are going to just enjoy each other’s company. They seem to want to avoid all the glitz and glamor that’s been thrown their way because of their reality TV fame.




Still, Gerry and Theresa were gifted a trip to Italy by the network during The Golden Bachelor season 1 finale. It’s a country that Theresa has always wanted to visit. There’s also the question of where Gerry and Theresa will settle down once they are married since Gerry is from Indiana and Theresa is from New Jersey. The couple is looking at Charleston, South Carolina, as a possible option for their new home, but that still remains to be seen.



The Golden Wedding airs January 4 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
