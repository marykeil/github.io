# The Last Of Us Will Ruin Its Best Episode If It Follows Through With 1 Idea Teased By Star


## SUMMARY 



  The Last of Us should not pursue a spin-off idea teased by one of its stars as it would ruin the show&#39;s best episode.   The show&#39;s success lies in its tangential, character-driven stories, like the stand-alone episode 3, which should not be expanded upon.   The episode &#34;Long, Long Time&#34; is a perfect example of self-contained storytelling that captures both the collapse of society and a beautiful love story.

## Literature Review
The Last of Us will ruin its best season 1 episode if it follows through with a spin-off idea teased by one of its stars. Sometimes, less is more.




The Last of Us will ruin its best season 1 episode if it follows through with a spin-off idea that was recently teased by one of its stars. While shows have leaned into blockbuster-level storytelling, sometimes less is more. That&#39;s certainly the case with HBO&#39;s The Last of Us. Based on the video game franchise of the same name, the show unfolds 20 years into a society-toppling pandemic caused by a fungal infection that turns hosts in zombie-like creatures. The narrative centers on Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened survivor tasked with escorting immune teenager Ellie (Bella Ramsey) to a facility located across the Infected-riddled country.




While most of The Last of Us season 1&#39;s nine episodes follow Joel, Ellie, and the present-set storyline, a handful of chapters deviate from the main narrative. One such episode, &#34;Left Behind,&#34; chronicles a life-altering moment in Ellie&#39;s life. However, the series&#39; standout is episode 3, &#34;Long, Long Time,&#34; which hard-cuts away from the beginning of Joel and Ellie&#39;s journey to tell a remarkable queer love story that spans the outbreak&#39;s first 20 years. The Last of Us&#39; 2024 Emmy wins prove that these tangential, character-driven stories are essential to the show&#39;s success, though that doesn&#39;t mean the standalone episode 3 needs to be expanded upon.

                  The Last of Us Episode 3&#39;s Most Sensitive Decision Explained   Director Peter Hoar explains why The Last of Us episode 3 made one especially sensitive choice at the end of Bill and Frank’s moving story.    


 The Last Of Us Episode 3, &#34;Long, Long Time,&#34; Is Perfect Self-Contained Storytelling 
          




In The Last of Us season 1, episode 3, &#34;Long, Long Time,&#34; Nick Offerman plays Bill, an incredibly prepared survivalist who turns his small, Massachusetts town into a post-apocalyptic sanctuary. Ready to live out his days alone, Bill is deeply skeptical of Frank (Murray Bartlett), a stranger who turns up one day. As Frank gradually breaks down the survivalist&#39;s walls, Bill, who&#39;s never allowed himself to fall in love, is drawn to Frank. Full of quiet, delicate moments of humanity, &#34;Long, Long Time&#34; stands in stark contrast to the series&#39; other episodes. Moreover, it illustrates society&#39;s collapse alongside Bill and Frank&#39;s love story, making for an achingly beautiful chapter.

After winning the Outstanding Guest Actor In A Drama Series category at the Creative Arts Emmys, Offerman discussed a possible Bill and Frank spinoff. &#34;I think we pitched a whole miniseries of a prequel of their lives before they met each other,&#34; the actor said. &#34;We&#39;re not short on ideas.&#34; Given that Offerman took home TV&#39;s most prestigious trophy for his TLOU role, it&#39;s not surprising that he and his co-star would want to return to the franchise. But it&#39;s better for the episode&#39;s legacy, and The Last of Us on the whole, for Bill and Frank&#39;s story to remain a one-off example of perfectly self-contained storytelling.






 Revisiting Bill &amp; Frank Would Undercut TLOU Season 1, Episode 3&#39;s Story 
          

In part, &#34;Long, Long Time&#34; thrives because it prizes economy — a rare trait in the age of three-hour movies. That careful restraint pairs well with the characters and the show&#39;s larger themes. While Bill and Frank&#39;s two-decade love story runs parallel to society&#39;s initial collapse, there&#39;s hope in it. Despite everything, the survivors find pockets of happiness with each other. Adding more to their story, be it a prequel or a spinoff, would undercut the episode&#39;s poignant narrative and effective structure. Even if viewers want more Bill and Frank, their episode of The Last of Us endures because it&#39;s winnowed down to snapshots of lives well-lived.
