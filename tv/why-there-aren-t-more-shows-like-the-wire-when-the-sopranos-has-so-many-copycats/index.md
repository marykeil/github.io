# Why There Aren t More Shows Like The Wire (When The Sopranos Has So Many Copycats)


## SUMMARY 



  The Wire&#39;s exploration of complex themes like corruption, the prison industrial complex, and inner-city communities, along with its talented cast, make it one of the best ensemble TV shows of all time.   Despite its retroactive praise, The Wire&#39;s lack of attention during its original airing has contributed to its relative obscurity compared to shows like The Sopranos.   The Wire&#39;s lack of a likable protagonist, bleak tone, and shifting perspectives make it a challenging watch, but its critical success has solidified its status as one of the best TV shows ever.

## Literature Review

Despite The Wire&#39;s compelling writing, complex characters, and dense themes, it isn&#39;t as famous as other shows like The Sopranos or True Detective.




Despite HBO&#39;s The Wire&#39;s masterful handling of its complex themes, there are no shows like it on television, despite other contemporaries like The Sopranos having generated several copycat series. Its exploration of thorny topics like the prison industrial complex&#39;s impact on society, corruption in law enforcement and politics, and authentic depictions of inner-city communities coupled with its brilliant cast make The Wire one of the best ensemble TV shows of all time. While The Wire and The Sopranos have both left an indelible impression on TV, The Wire is often left out of the conversation when matters of prestige TV arise, thus leading to the well-written show&#39;s obscurity.




Although there are plenty of shows that wouldn&#39;t exist without The Sopranos&#39; influence, The Wire&#39;s handling of its themes, strong performances from its entire cast, and engaging storytelling are the exact same reasons why The Sopranos has gone on to attain its legendary status over the years. While The Wire enjoys a lot of retroactive praise, the lack of attention to it during its original airing has contributed to the show&#39;s relative obscurity compared to other shows with similar subjects. As unfortunate as it is, there are a few possible explanations regarding The Wire&#39;s lack of critical and worldwide recognition.

                  1 Harsh Truth Settles The Breaking Bad Vs. The Wire Debate   One of TV&#39;s hottest debates pits HBO&#39;s The Wire against AMC&#39;s Breaking Bad. Both celebrated TV shows made history, but one is the clear winner.   


 There Are Lots Of Shows Like The Sopranos 
The Sopranos&#39; success and influence inspired many crime dramas like Breaking Bad and Mad Men.
          




Running on air from 1999 to 2007, The Sopranos centers around the titular Sopranos family, a notorious Italian mob family, and its patriarch&#39;s struggles balancing his personal life with his criminal activities. In addition to its unique approach to the crime drama genre, The Sopranos features many great character actors, quotes, and episodes that not only emphasize the best qualities of gangster movies and TV shows, but expose its audience to a different way of interpreting the psyche of its many damaged individuals. Combined with its strategically placed violence, The Sopranos&#39; influence is far-reaching and felt to this day.

As such, other critical darlings like Breaking Bad and, to a lesser extent, Better Call Saul, Mad Men, and Boardwalk Empire (the latter two being shows created by The Sopranos writers Matthew Weiner and Terence Winter respectively) tackle similar subjects regarding criminology in a unique and engaging way. Breaking Bad depicts a man struggling to balance his distinct personal life and his criminal life, similar to Tony Soprano, and Boardwalk Empire also emphasizes the importance of family through its tragic characters. Perhaps because The Sopranos is more accessible when compared to The Wire explains its greater familiarity among general audiences.






 The Wire Is A Lot Harder To Mimic Than The Sopranos 
The Wire&#39;s absence of a protagonist and deep examination of real-world issues makes it too complex.
         

The Wire&#39;s lack of popularity can be chalked up to a few things that it emphasizes. The Wire&#39;s emphasis on subjects like corruption in politics and law enforcement, thus leading to the overall degradation of society, character actors mostly consisting of people of color, lack of a likable protagonist to identify with, and shifting focuses/perspectives each season make the show a challenging watch for audiences looking for something fairly straightforward to invest their time and energy into. Furthermore, The Wire is decidedly bleak in both its tone and atmosphere, thus leaving its audience with very little reprieve regarding its subjects.

While audiences of today are much more open-minded about the content they consume, preferring shows with complex characters and thought-provoking themes, things were much different during The Wire&#39;s original airing. Although The Wire is considered ahead of its time by critics and general audiences of today, its low ratings perpetually kept it in the shadows of other shows that handled similar subjects and even featured some of the same actors. However, with HBO&#39;s recent critical successes like Game of Thrones and True Detective, history has vindicated The Wire&#39;s status as one of the best TV shows of all time.






 What Shows Are Actually Similar To The Wire 
Oz, The Shield, and True Detective also tackle similar subjects in a uniquely artistic way.
          

Despite The Wire&#39;s distinct approach to handling its subjects of crime, corruption, law, and order, there are a handful of shows that viewers can also watch that come close to delivering a similar viewing experience as the underrated HBO crime drama. HBO&#39;s Oz is a notable example as it specifically examines the prison industrial complex in the United States as well as the rampant corruption that impacts the lives of its inmates. Additionally, many actors, such as Seth Gilliam, J. D. Williams, and Lance Reddick appear in both shows, thus providing a vague sense of familiarity between them.

The Shield and True Detective share even greater similarities with The Wire as they specifically examine the impact that rampant corruption can have on society and individuals on both sides of the law. Whereas The Shield takes more of a procedural approach to its storytelling, it still successfully demonstrates the moral decay of society when arbiters of justice fail in their responsibilities. True Detective highlights the impact that complex cases can have on their lawmen, similar to The Wire&#39;s Jimmy McNulty. While The Wire truly is a unique show, The Shield and True Detective share many thematic qualities with it.




   The Wire  Drama     Release Date    June 2, 2002     Cast    Lance Reddick , Michael B. Jordan , Idris Elba , Dominic West , Wood Harris     Seasons    5
