## Literature Review
Mike and Harvey actors, Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht, are set to reunite on TV for the first time since Suits&#39; breakout year on streaming. 




Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht, who played Mike and Harvey in Suits, are set for their very first TV reunion after the show&#39;s breakout on streaming. The legal drama follows New York&#39;s supposed best closers at Pearson, Hardman as they deal with various professional and personal challenges. Despite being an ensemble, Suits&#39; true leads were Mike and Harvey, whose chance meeting kicked off the events of the USA Network original.




Variety reports that Adams and Macht will be presenting at the 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, January 7. This will mark their first on-screen reunion since Suits&#39; unexpected resurgence on Netflix, resulting in breaking various streaming records. The article claims that other cast members were invited to present as well, but no confirmation if any of them will be attending the Hollywood event.



The 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards will air on CBS and will stream on Paramount&#43; with Showtime at 8 PM ET. 





 Could Adams &amp; Machtâ€™s Reunion Result In New Suits Spin-off Announcement? 
          

Adams &amp; Macht will reunite as presenters at the Golden Globes, but it&#39;s safe to say that they will be asked about what they know of the currently in-development new Suits show. Series creator Aaron Korsh is currently spearheading the efforts to crack the story, but there is no official word yet on what it will be or how it will impact the established canon of the main show. Nevertheless, it&#39;s confirmed to be neither a spin-off nor a prequel. Instead, it will introduce an entirely new slate of lawyers.




Since the new project will exist in the same reality that Suits is in, there will be interest in any kind of connection its events will have with Mike and Harvey. For instance, Suits ended with the mentor and mentee reuniting in Seattle after they both decided it was time to leave the cut-throat New York scene for a more meaningful endeavor with their respective loved ones in the Pacific Northwest. Assuming that the ending holds up, it isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility that the pair find their way to the new firm that will center that expansion series.

                  Suits&#39; 4-Year-Old Cancelled Spinoff Exposes Biggest Problem With New Show   A brand new Suits series is in development, but its 4-year-old failed spin-off exposes why the endeavor will have difficulty succeeding.    

Whatever the case may be, seeing Adams and Macht on screen again years after Suits ended will be a treat for those who enjoyed the show. It is expected that there will be some of their signature Mike and Harvey dynamic on-stage, as well as comments on the legal drama&#39;s newfound success. Anything that they can reveal about the upcoming new series will only be a bonus.
