The sprawling original content library on Apple TV+ is home to feel-good comedies including Ted Lasso and Schmigadoon!, and dark, unsettling dramas like Severance. While Apple TV+&rsquo;s catalog isn&rsquo;t as expansive as other streaming services, its more boutique approach still offers plenty of quality content. As such, the best TV shows on Apple TV+ are well worth closer consideration from audiences – whatever they&rsquo;re interested in.

<p>Best Comedy TV Shows On Apple TV+
Ted Lasso (2020-2023)</p>
<p>Ted Lasso</p>
<p>Release Date   August 14, 2020    Genres   Comedy , Drama , sport    Seasons   3</p>
<p>Belying its humble origins of NBC Sports promo media for the English Premier League, Ted Lasso is much better than a show adapted from commercials has any right to be, and is Apple TV+&rsquo;s best show. Reprising his role from NBC Sports&rsquo; Premier League promos, Jason Sudeikis shines as the endlessly optimistic coach, drafted in to lead a struggling English football team to victory. Ted may be a fish out of water, but he makes everyone around him believe in themselves, and he in turn learns a lot about who he is.</p>
<p>In 2021, Ted Lasso became the most nominated new comedy in Emmy history, winning seven of its 20 Primetime Emmy nominations — including Outstanding Comedy Series, as well as individual acting awards for Jason Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, and Hannah Waddingham. The show reprised several Emmy wins in 2022 for its second season, including Outstanding Comedy and Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Sudeikis. Ted Lasso season 3 was a bit uneven, but still maintained the show&rsquo;s honest depiction of mental health and strong portrayal of fully-rounded female characters. It&rsquo;s unclear if Ted Lasso season 4 will happen for Apple TV+, but if the titular coach taught viewers anything, it&rsquo;s to believe.

Mythic Quest (2020-Present)</p>
<p>Mythic Quest</p>
<p>Release Date   February 7, 2020    Cast   Rob McElhenney , Ashley Burch , Jessie Ennis , Imani Hakim , David Hornsby , Charlotte Nicdao , Danny Pudi , F. Murray Abraham , Naomi Ekperigin    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   3</p>
<p>The workplace sitcom has long been a popular TV subgenre, and though Mythic Quest isn&rsquo;t in the same pop culture stratosphere as The Office or Parks and Rec, it deserves to be. It centers around the day-to-day happenings and shenanigans at the studio that produces the titular video game, an MMORPG created by the arrogant Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenny). Ian frequently clashes with his socially awkward yet brilliant lead engineer Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao), but beneath their feuding is an almost sweet creative respect.
Mythic Quest is a comedy series with something for everyone. Gamers will revel in the peek behind the curtain the show offers while non-gamers will still be able to relate to the everyday frustrations of office life. In the middle of each season is a flashback episode showing the creative origin story of someone important to Mythic Quest&rsquo;s development. Few shows celebrate following creative dreams like Mythic Quest, and it does so in a way that is never overly sentimental or twee.

Shrinking (2023-Present)
Jason Segel and Harrison Ford in Shrinking</p>
<p>Shrinking</p>
<p>Release Date   January 27, 2023    Cast   Jason Segel , Harrison Ford , Jessica Williams , Christa Miller , Michael Urie    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   1</p>
<p>From Ted Lasso’s Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein, Shrinking stars Jason Segel as Jimmy, a grieving therapist who ignores the rule book and tells his patients exactly what he thinks. Understandably, this unorthodox approach doesn&rsquo;t sit right with Dr. Paul Rhoades (Harrison Ford), the foil to Jimmy and senior therapist at the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Center.
Shrinking&rsquo;s potentially fraught themes are balanced by Segel&rsquo;s signature dry wit and goofiness, with Jimmy succeeding as both a parody and a realistic depiction of a classic trope. Undoubtedly one of Apple TV+&rsquo;s best 2023 shows, Shrinking is a quirky study of grief with a huge heart and a powerful message about dealing with loss. The always reliable Segel finally got recognized for his TV talents, and earned an Emmy nomination for Shrinking.

<p>Shrinking Season 2: Renewal, Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know
The Jason Segel and Harrison Ford-starring Shrinking was another huge hit for AppleTV+, and here&rsquo;s everything we know about Shrinking season 2.</p>
<p>The Afterparty (2022-2023)</p>
<p>The Afterparty</p>
<p>Release Date   January 28, 2022    Cast   Tiffany Haddish , Sam Richardson , Zoe Chao , Ike Barinholtz , Ben Schwartz , Ilana Glazer , Jamie Demetriou , Dave Franco    Genres   Comedy , Mystery</p>
<p>Put a who&rsquo;s who of comedy heavyweights in a room, add a murder, and the result is the hit comedy The Afterparty. Apple TV+&rsquo;s anthology comedy series features a new cast of characters and a new shindig every season, with Tiffany Haddish reaching comedic highs as Detective Danner. Danner is the constant in the show, who returns each season to investigate the killing at the center of the story. Season 1 focuses on the afterparty of a high school reunion, while season 2 takes place the day after a wedding. The upcoming season 3 will take place after a movie premiere.
Anthology series are becoming more and more popular, and for good reason — switching out the characters means that a great idea rarely grows stale. With Haddish leading ensembles that include Ike Barinholtz, Ben Schwartz, Ilana Glazer, Dave Franco, and Anna Konkle, the laughs don&rsquo;t stop. For people who like their murder mysteries with a dash of hilarity, The Afterparty is the perfect Apple TV+ show.

Schmigadoon! (2021-Present)</p>
<p>Schmigadoon</p>
<p>Release Date   July 16, 2021    Cast   Keegan-Michael Key , Ariana DeBose , Cecily Strong , Ann Harada , Alan Cumming , Dove Cameron , Martin Short , Kristin Chenoweth , Jaime Camil , Fred Armisen , Jane Krakowski , Aaron Tveit    Genres   Musical , Comedy    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Created by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio with a first season directed by Men in Black’s Barry Sonnenfeld, Schmigadoon! is a delightfully quirky musical comedy series. Cecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key star as Melissa and Josh, a pair of backpackers who stumble upon a town perpetually trapped in a Golden Age-style musical — only able to leave once they have found true love. Schmigadoon!&rsquo;s Emmy-winning songs, creative choreography, and original concept are parodies of the 1947 musical Brigadoon, yet the show is much more than a straightforward pastiche.
Following season 1, which parodied the Golden Age of musicals from the &rsquo;40s and &rsquo;50s, Schmigadoon! season 2 is inspired by musicals from the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s, highlighting the creator&rsquo;s ingenuity and the show&rsquo;s seemingly endless reservoir of inspiration. Schmigadoon! season 3 hasn&rsquo;t been confirmed yet, but hopefully, Josh and Melissa will find themselves trapped in a world of &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s musicals.

Central Park (2020-Present)</p>
<p>Central Park</p>
<p>Release Date   May 29, 2020    Cast   Kristen Bell , Tituss Burgess , Daveed Diggs , Josh Gad , Kathryn Hahn , Leslie Odom Jr. , Stanley Tucci , Emmy Raver-Lampman    Genres   Sitcom , Musical    Seasons   3</p>
<p>From the brilliant comedic minds of Bob&rsquo;s Burgers creator Loren Bouchard, Nora Smith, and Josh Gad comes Central Park, an adult animated musical comedy about the Tillerman-Hunters, a wealthy family who lives in Edendale Castle, which is located in the titular New York City park. Life is good until a scheming land developer plans to purchase all the land in Central Park and fill it with condos and shops. Narrated by a street busker named Birdie (Gad), Central Park sees the Tillerman-Hunters fighting to save their beloved home.
Though Central Park faced controversy for casting white actress Kristen Bell as Molly Tillerman, a biracial character, the show course-corrected and replaced Bell with Emmy Raver-Lampman, who is also biracial (though Bell is still on the show as Abby Hunter). But apart from this unfortunate gaffe, Central Park has been nothing but a delight throughout its three seasons and counting. It&rsquo;s full of heart and celebrates family, music, and above all else, New York City.

Physical (2021-2023)</p>
<p>Physical</p>
<p>Release Date   June 18, 2021    Cast   Rory Scovel , Geoffrey Arend , Rose Byrne , Ashley Liao , Dierdre Friel , Ian Gomez , Lou Taylor Pucci , Paul Sparks , Della Saba    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   2</p>
<p>With winning performances in Bridesmaids and Get Him to the Greek, Rose Byrne is one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most underrated actresses. Thankfully, Apple TV+ has taken notice of her talents because she stars in two of the platform&rsquo;s original series, Physical and Platonic. In the former, Byrne plays Sheila Rubin, a bored and frustrated 1980s housewife who finds joy and empowerment through aerobics.
Physical is a shrewd satire that takes swings at negative body image and American consumerism, and while its bite might be a little sharp for some, those who enjoy the show will find it has a lot of important things to say. And while many of Physical&rsquo;s characters are unlikable, Byrne once again delivers a masterful performance that is worth watching.

Still Up (2023-Present)</p>
<p>Still Up</p>
<p>Release Date   September 22, 2023    Cast   Antonia Thomas , Craig Roberts , Blake Harrison , Rich Fulcher , Samantha Spiro , Lois Chimimba , Luke Fetherston    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   1</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s great about Apple TV+&rsquo;s TV programming is that in addition to its flagship shows, the streaming service has quite a few quieter, gentle comedies, including Still Up. The British series stars Antonia Thomas as bubbly artist Lisa and Craig Roberts as anxious journalist Danny, two Londoners who both suffer from chronic insomnia. They pass the late-night hours by talking to each other, though they&rsquo;ve never met in person, and while they enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, their close bond begins to affect their other relationships.
A comedy about a whimsical free spirit and a neurotic wallflower always runs the risk of being cliché and tired, but Thomas and Roberts make their characters layered, genuine, relatable people who are a pleasure to spend time with. And for not sharing the screen together, they have a breezy chemistry that makes the viewer want to keep listening to their conversations long after the credits have rolled.

Platonic (2023-Present)</p>
<p>Platonic</p>
<p>Release Date   May 24, 2023    Cast   Rose Byrne , Seth Rogen , Luke Macfarlane , Tre Hale , Carla Gallo , Andrew Lopez    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Watch On Apple TV+</p>
<p>Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen proved they have sharp yet sweet on-screen chemistry in the Neighbors movies, and now they&rsquo;re back in the Apple TV+ comedy series Platonic. They play Sylvia and Will, two former best friends who reconnect years after a big falling out. But while they work at patching things up, their reconciled friendship creates complications for the other relationships in their lives.
In a romance-obsessed society, it&rsquo;s a tight balancing act to have two leads with Byrne and Rogen&rsquo;s rapport and not make them fall in love, but that&rsquo;s the entire point of Platonic. It beautifully shows the messiness and the drama of adult relationships, but the show never feels heavy and dour. It&rsquo;s breezy and uplifting and a great Apple TV+ show to watch with your best friends.

Bad Sisters (2022-Present)</p>
<p>Bad Sisters</p>
<p>Release Date   August 19, 2022    Cast   Sharon Horgan , Anne-Marie Duff , Eva Birthistle , Sarah Greene , Eve Hewson , Claes Bang , Brian Gleeson , Daryl McCormack    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Thriller    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Sharon Horgan’s pitch-black Irish comedy series Bad Sisters revolves around five siblings living in Dublin. Horgan plays Eva, the oldest sister, who comes up with the idea of murdering another sister&rsquo;s abusive husband, John Paul (Claes Bang). The first season sees the sisters&rsquo; hilarious attempts to kill John Paul thwarted one after the other until Bad Sisters&rsquo; wild season 1 ending, that leaves viewers clamoring for the sophomore installment.
With several Writers Guild of America, Critics&rsquo; Choice Television Awards, and Primetime Emmy nominations, Bad Sisters is a thrilling and frequently uproarious murder mystery that proves the perfect conduit for Horgan’s acerbic wit. Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene, and Eve Hewson splendidly round out the rest of the Garvey sisters as a truly magnetic ensemble – a key reason why it ranks among the best shows found on Apple TV+.

<p>Release Date   November 1, 2019    Cast   Marcia Gay Harden , Holland Taylor , Bel Powley , Tom Irwin , Reese Witherspoon , Jack Davenport , Ruairi O&rsquo;Connor , Greta Lee , Gugu Mbatha-Raw , Hasan Minhaj , Desean Terry , Jennifer Aniston , Nestor Carbonell , Julianna Margulies , Valeria Golino , Mark Duplass , Janina Gavankar , Karen Pittman , Steve Carell , Billy Crudup , Tara Karsian    Genres   Drama    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Also known as Morning Wars in Indonesia and Australia, The Morning Show takes a peek behind the curtain of the world of morning TV, as the titular program&rsquo;s male co-anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) is accused of sexual misconduct. The Morning Show takes a frank look at both sides of the #MeToo movement in season 1 and continues with topical issues present in media. Season 2 examines the COVID-19 pandemic while season 3 sees a tech billionaire (Jon Hamm) wanting to acquire the network.</p>
<p>While the series isn&rsquo;t one of Apple TV+&rsquo;s most critically acclaimed shows, The Morning Show cast members have earned widespread acclaim. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon have been nominated for several prestigious awards, with Billy Crudup taking home the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series Emmy in 2020. Hello Sunshine, the production company founded by Witherspoon, is behind The Morning Show, and it joins the ranks of Big Little Lies and Little Fires Everywhere as one of the most gripping, relevant female-driven dramas on television.

WeCrashed (2022)</p>
<p>WeCrashed</p>
<p>Release Date   March 18, 2022    Cast   Jared Leto , Anne Hathaway , Kyle Marvin , Anthony Edwards    Seasons   1</p>
<p>American scandals are at the heart of many miniseries, from The Dropout to Pam &amp; Tommy, and WeCrashed is Apple TV+&rsquo;s engrossing, entertaining contribution to the trend. It follows the meteoric rise and calamitous fall of WeWork, Adam and Rebekah Neumann&rsquo;s office co-working company.
Corporate stories always run the risk of being dull and slow-paced, and WeCrashed was indeed criticized for its pacing issues. However, the decision to center the story on the marriage and relationship between Adam and Rebekah helps propel the story and keep the plot fresh. And while Hathaway&rsquo;s performance was overshadowed by Amanda Seyfried&rsquo;s Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout (which won Seyfried an Emmy), it deserves to be just as celebrated.

Black Bird (2022)</p>
<p>Black Bird</p>
<p>Release Date   August 8, 2022    Cast   Taron Egerton , Paul Walter Hauser , Ray Liotta    Genres   Drama    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Based on James Keene and Hillel Levin’s autobiographical novel In with the Devil and developed by Dennis Lehane, Black Bird is a crime drama miniseries about a once-promising young football star unexpectedly faced with narcotics charges that could send him to prison. Jimmy is forced to use his gift of gab to take a deal for a fully commuted sentence. The catch is that, in exchange, he must help federal authorities coax a confession out of Larry Hall — a serial killer.
Paul Walter Hauser, who plays Larry, won an award for Best Supporting Actor at the 2023 Golden Globes, while series lead Taron Egerton was nominated for Best Actor, and Black Bird itself earned a nomination for Best Limited Series. Black Bird will surely be remembered as one of the 2020s&rsquo; best series, and it has more than cemented its status as one of the best shows on Apple TV+.

<p>Five Days At Memorial (2022)</p>
<p>Five Days at Memorial</p>
<p>Release Date   August 12, 2022    Cast   Vera Farmiga , Cherry Jones , Robert Pine    Seasons   1</p>
<p>Based on the harrowing true story and Sheri Fink book of the same name, Five Days at Memorial recounts the five days at Memorial Medical Center in a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans when the hospital is without power. At the center of it all is Dr. Anna Pou (Vera Farmiga), who is accused of euthanizing patients during these trying days.
Five Days at Memorial is not an easy watch, and almost all critics are in agreement about how brutal it is to sit through. However, the pundits have also been near unanimous in their acclaim for the series as a necessary watch with particular acknowledgment of Farmiga&rsquo;s compelling performance. This Apple TV+ miniseries may have flown under the radar, but it&rsquo;s a story that deserves to be told.

Slow Horses (2022-Present)</p>

<p>Release Date   April 1, 2022    Cast   Jonathan Pryce , Kristin Scott Thomas , Jack Lowden , Gary Oldman , Saskia Reeves , Chris Reilly , Rosalind Eleazar , Christopher Chung , Olivia Cooke    Genres   Thriller , Drama    Seasons   2</p>
<p>Those bored with smooth-talking, suave spies like James Bond or Ethan Hunt need look no further than Slow Horses. The Apple TV+ series centers on a group of incompetent MI5 agents (also known as &ldquo;Slow Horses&rdquo;) whose failures on the job have placed them on desk duty. However, they get a shot at redemption when they uncover a sinister plot.
Slow Horses tells a hilarious underdog story and boasts an incredibly talented cast, led by a scene-chewing Gary Oldman. He plays the head of the Slough House department, the rude and offensive Jackson Lamb — essentially Apple TV+&rsquo;s answer to Michael Scott. But Lamb is deceptively smart, and he and his crack team make Slow Horses as thrilling as it is funny.

<p>With offerings like The Essex Serpent and Dickinson, Apple TV+ has some of the greatest period series of any streaming service, and their latest, The Buccaneers, is among that number. Based on the unfinished Edith Wharton novel of the same name, The Buccaneers sees five vivacious and wealthy American girls looking for husbands in 1870s London. What follows is an enthralling culture clash as the posh British society looks down on these new arrivals from across the pond.
Anyone who thinks the period genre is tired and stuffy will be proven wrong by The Buccaneers. It brilliantly balances frothiness with poignance and has a lot to say about the expectations of women in society. If this series is any indication, lead actors Kristine Froseth, Alisha Boe, Josie Totah, Aubri Ibrag, and Imogen Waterhouse will become huge stars. Mad Men&rsquo;s Christina Hendricks also shines as Mrs. St. George. Fans of series like The Gilded Age and The Great will no doubt be adding The Buccaneers to their list of favorite shows.

<p>Release Date   October 13, 2023    Cast   Brie Larson , Lewis Pullman , Aja Naomi King , Stephanie Koenig , Patrick Walker , Thomas Mann , Kevin Sussman , Beau Bridges    Genres   Drama    Seasons   1</p>
<p>A New York Times bestselling novel and Academy Award winner Brie Larson prove to be the perfect recipe for success with Lessons in Chemistry. Based on the beloved Bonnie Garmus book of the same name, this Apple TV+ miniseries follows Elizabeth Zott (Larson), a brilliant chemist who is fired from her lab tech job in the 1960s. She then begins hosting Supper at Six, a TV cooking show, which she uses as a platform to discuss feminist topics along with sharing delicious recipes.
Larson proves why she is one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most lauded working actors in yet another winning performance. She plays Elizabeth with poise, self-confidence, and relatability, and her rapport with male lead Lewis Pullman is itself a lesson in chemistry. The other actors in the Lessons in Chemistry cast are also at the top of their game. Larson will likely see herself nominated for numerous awards but regardless, Lessons in Chemistry is one of the best shows on Apple TV+.

Dickinson (2019-2021)</p>
<p>Dickinson</p>
<p>Release Date   November 1, 2019    Cast   Anna Baryshnikov , Hailee Steinfeld , Wiz Khalifa , Jane Krakowski , Adrian Blake Enscoe , Toby Huss , Ella Hunt    Genres   Biography , Comedy , Drama    Seasons   3</p>
<p>A revelatory riff on the traditional biopic, Dickinson offers a unique blend between period drama and contemporary coming-of-age comedy. The Apple TV original show tells the story of a young Emily Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld) as she negotiates familial relationships, sexual identity, and historical politics. In the vein of Sofia Coppola&rsquo;s Marie Antoinette, Dickinson may be a period series, but it&rsquo;s rooted firmly in the 21st century with its anachronisms of contemporary music and language.
Steinfeld gives one of her best performances in the title role, bringing a relatability to the otherwise imposing literary icon, and giving her a millennial sensibility. Some viewers may find this off-putting, but the fresh take on both the subject and the genre speaks to the themes of female agency throughout the show Though mostly snubbed for major awards, Dickinson is remarkably consistent in its high quality from start to finish.

<p>The Essex Serpent</p>
<p>Release Date   May 13, 2022    Cast   Claire Danes , Tom Hiddleston    Seasons   1</p>
<p>2022 was Claire Danes&rsquo; year for miniseries. In addition to starring in Fleishman Is in Trouble, she played the lead role in the moody gothic romance period drama The Essex Serpent on Apple TV+. Based on the Sarah Perry novel of the same name, The Essex Serpent sees widowed Cora Seaborne (Danes) leave London for Essex where she looks into whether the titular creature is real. There, she&rsquo;s met with hostility from the locals but develops an unlikely — and very complicated — bond with Pastor Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston).
The mystery of whether the serpent is real is enough to keep any viewer tuned into the miniseries&rsquo; six episodes, but it&rsquo;s the smoldering chemistry between Danes and Hiddleston that really makes The Essex Serpent one of Apple TV+&rsquo;s best shows. Yet again, they prove themselves masters of the small screen with their astounding performances.

Every young audience member will find a character they can relate to and identify with, and they may also be inspired to pick up the classic books seen in the show.

<p>A reboot of Jim Henson&rsquo;s beloved 1983 series Fraggle Rock, Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock provides just as many catchy tunes, wacky hijinks, and positive messages. In the home of inventor Doc (Lilli Cooper) and her dog Sprocket (John Tartaglia) is a hole that leads to wondrous Fraggle Rock. There, the Fraggles have all sorts of fun and wild adventures while learning important lessons about community, the environment, and more along the way.
Many viewers who grew up watching the original Fraggle Rock now likely have kids of their own, and the great thing about Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock is that it will be a pure delight for fans old and new. It&rsquo;s a visually stunning show, particularly the waterfall setting, the puppetry is masterful, and it&rsquo;s all but impossible not to sing along with the Fraggles and their friends.

Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters (2023)</p>
<p>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</p>
<p>Cast   Kurt Russell , Wyatt Russell , Anna Sawai , Kiersey Clemons , Ren Watabe , Mari Yamamoto , Anders Holm , Joe Tippett , Elisa Lasowski    Genres   Action ,  Sci-Fi    Rating   Not Yet Rated    Seasons   1    Streaming Service(s)   Apple TV+</p>
<p>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters arrived on Apple TV+ in later 2023 and was immediately one of the best sci-fi shows on the platform — although this is of little surprise since it ties into Legendary&rsquo;s MonsterVerse movies, meaning that it brings Godzilla and many other titans to the small screen for the first time. With an all-star cast that includes John Goodman and father-son dueo Wyatt and Kurt Russell playing the same character at different points in history, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters isn&rsquo;t just among the best Apple TV+ sci-fi shows because it features a heavy dose of kaiju action (though the giant creatures — and the amazing CGI they&rsquo;re brought to life with — certainly help).</p>
<p>One of the first Apple TV+ shows with the scope and budget to rival the cinematic Netflix and Amazon Prime Video originals, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters has undoubtedly brought a fair few new subsribers to Apple&rsquo;s streaming service. While it&rsquo;s yet to receive any major awards acclaim it&rsquo;s been responded to generally favorably by critics, and fans of Godzill and MonsterVerse movies will find it capitvating from start to finish.
The Changeling (2023)</p>
<p>The Changeling</p>
<p>Release Date   September 8, 2023    Cast   LaKeith Stanfield , Clark Backo , Adina Porter , Jared Abrahamson , Alexis Louder , Malcolm Barrett    Genres   Drama , Fantasy , Thriller    Rating   TV-MA</p>
<p>LaKeith Stanfield has proven himself as one of the most versatile actors working today, with success across many genres from horror (Get Out) to surreal fantasy (Sorry to Bother You). In The Changeling, based on the Victor LaValle novel of the same name, Stanfield taps into both. The unique horror-urban fantasy series sees Apollo (Stanfield) and Emma (Clark Backo) living a fairy tale romance that turns upside down when Emma goes missing after their child is born, and Apollo going on a dangerous, surreal journey to find her.
While some critics may have dinged The Changeling for being a bit muddled and lacking Emma&rsquo;s perspective, it&rsquo;s one of Apple TV+&rsquo;s most unconventional shows, and the risk pays off. The talented Stanfield once again proves why he&rsquo;s a star, playing a character that couldn&rsquo;t be more different from his other famous TV role, Darius in Atlanta.

For All Mankind (2019-Present)</p>
<p>For All Mankind</p>
<p>Release Date   November 1, 2019    Cast   Michaela Conlin , jodi balfour , Coral Peña , Colm Feore , Sarah Jones , Wrenn Schmidt , Casey W. Johnson , Cynthy Wu , Shantel VanSanten , Michael Harney , Krys Marshall , Joel Kinnaman , Sonya Walger , Michael Dorman    Genres   Drama , History ,  Sci-Fi    Seasons   4</p>
<p>An imaginative sci-fi fantasy that takes an alternative look at one of the most seminal moments in human history, For All Mankind is a thoughtful meditation on the ongoing impacts and potential missed opportunities of the space race. In the show&rsquo;s alternate reality, the father of the Soviet space program Sergei Korolov lived instead of dying during an operation, allowing the Soviets to reach the Moon first.
The astronauts in the For All Mankind cast are based on real-life top NASA astronauts from the late &rsquo;60s, with each succeeding season taking place a decade later than the last, providing a fascinating and realistic version of the historic space race. For All Mankind&rsquo;s unique premise earned it recognition from the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for Outstanding Innovation in Interactive Programming, and the Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Television Series.

Severance (2022-Present)</p>
<p>Severance</p>
<p>Release Date   February 18, 2022    Cast   Christopher Walken , Tramell Tillman , Michael Chernus , Adam Scott , Britt Lower , Patricia Arquette , Jen Tullock , John Turturro , Dichen Lachman , Zach Cherry    Genres   Drama , Mystery ,  Sci-Fi    Rating   TV-MA</p>
<p>A unique combination of dystopian sci-fi, psychological thriller, and workplace comedy, Severance revolves around biotech company Lumon Industries, which begins an experimental work program that separates employees’ office memories from the day-to-day of their personal lives. However, Macrodata Refinement worker Mark Scout (Adam Scott) soon discovers the conspiracy behind the experiment and what&rsquo;s really going on at the company.
Severance was named one of the Top 10 Programs of the Year by the American Film Institute in 2022, and was also awarded by the Art Directors Guild for outstanding production design — just a handful of its multiple nominations and wins. Scott leads Severance&rsquo;s star-studded cast in the pitch-perfect satire of the soul-crushing corporate world. Given its brilliantly risky and mystery-driven premise, Severance season 2 will determine whether the series can remain among the best Apple TV+ shows in the future.
