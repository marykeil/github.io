# Marvel Can Redeem A Daredevil Character If Netflix s Shows Are MCU Canon


## SUMMARY 



  If the Netflix Daredevil series is considered canon in the MCU, Marvel has the chance to redeem characters like Elektra and continue their stories.   Elektra&#39;s character arc in the Netflix Marvel universe was underwhelming, and she deserves a shot at redemption in the MCU.   The MCU has the opportunity to bring Elektra back in Daredevil: Born Again, similar to how Daredevil himself was brought back in the Netflix series.

## Literature Review

If Netflix&#39;s Marvel shows are officially canon in the MCU, this gives the studio the chance to redeem one character in Daredevil: Born Again.




Marvel has the chance to redeem a Daredevil character if the Netflix shows are officially canon in the MCU. While Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin returned to the MCU, it was unclear if these were the same characters from the Netflix series or if Marvel just wanted them to reprise their roles for Daredevil: Born Again. There still hasn&#39;t been an official confirmation that these shows are canon, but in Echo, Kingpin&#39;s backstory shared many similarities to the Netflix series. The shows were also added to the MCU timeline on Disney&#43;.




If Daredevil is canon, then Marvel can continue the stories of other popular characters from The Defenders universe, like The Punisher and Jessica Jones. Since Daredevil ended abruptly, there are a few characters who didn&#39;t get satisfying closures to their story. One character, in particular, got the short end of the stick on Daredevil and deserves a shot at redemption in the MCU.

                  Daredevil Born Again: Release Info, Cast &amp; Everything We Know So Far   After being teased in MCU films and television shows, Matt Murdock is returning to the screen for a series in the Disney&#43; Daredevil: Born Again.    


 Netflix&#39;s Daredevil Never Gave Elektra A Satisfying Character Arc 
         

   Daredevil      Release Date    April 10, 2015     Cast    Charlie Cox , Rosario Dawson , Elden Henson , Vincent D&#39;Onofrio , Deborah Ann Woll , Jon Bernthal     Seasons    3     Streaming Service(s)    Netflix , Disney&#43;      




Elektra Natchios made her debut in Daredevil Season 2, played by Elodie Yung. Daredevil and Elektra have an on-and-off romance that began before the series, but she comes back in season 2 to get Murdock&#39;s help in defeating The Hand. While The Hand is defeated for now, she is killed off before being resurrected by The Hand, as they believe she is a warrior called the Black Sky, a powerful weapon meant to lead The Hand. She comes back in The Defenders and leads The Hand but is defeated by Daredevil, and the pair seemingly die together after being buried under rubble.

                  5 Upcoming MCU Movies &amp; Shows Elektra Could Return In   Netflix&#39;s Defenders characters are appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, foreshadowing the possible future return of Elektra Natchios.   

Elektra is a well-known character from the comics, but her arc in the Netflix Marvel universe was severely underwhelming. She has a traumatic past under the tutelage of Stick, but she is never given a moment of redemption. She&#39;s killed by The Hand, and after being resurrected, she turns evil before seemingly getting killed off again. While her relationship with Murdock does bring out the light in her, she&#39;s never given a moment to be more than Matt&#39;s toxic love interest. She needs more independence from Matt to find her way, and the MCU could give her that opportunity.






 How The MCU Could Bring Elektra Back in Daredevil: Born Again 
          

Fortunately, the MCU can bring Elektra back the same way Daredevil was brought back for Daredevil Season 3. While it looked like the pair died in The Defenders, Matt managed to crawl his way out of the rubble. When he searched for Elektra, her body was missing, so it was unconfirmed if Elektra was alive or dead. If the MCU decides to bring her back for Daredevil: Born Again, then they can show that she survived the building collapsing as well. She is a beloved anti-hero by many, and she should come back, whether she&#39;s canon or not.
