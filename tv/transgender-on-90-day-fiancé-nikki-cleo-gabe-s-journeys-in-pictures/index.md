Gabe from Florida joined the cast of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4 in January 2023. Gabe became the first transgender person to join the franchise. Fans were interested in knowing more about the 32-year-old’s life, including his past and what he did for work, etc. Gabe revealed a lot about his journey during episode 1 itself. Gabe owned a local business called GMPWear. Gabe was making boxer briefs with packers sewn into the crotch area. The built-in bulge was made out of soft foam to create the packer that transgender men wore to imitate the shape of a bulge.

“Once upon a time, I was a girl, and now I’m a whole man,” Gabe told the viewers. In kindergarten, Gabe saw a friend of his cousin who’d dressed up as a boy. Gabe began wearing basketball shorts every day. However, he didn’t know one could change their gender. Gabe came out as a lesbian at 16 years old. He felt like a boy when he was dating girls. However, Gave came across a video of a man transitioning at 22 and ended up watching all the man’s videos back to back in one night. Gabriel filed to legally change his name from Natalie to Gabriel in November 2014.




He changed his gender on his driver&#39;s license on Instagram in 2021. Gabe began taking testosterone eight years ago. He underwent phalloplasty to become a “whole man” but it wasn’t an easy procedure. Gabe’s thigh tissue was used to create a sensate penis. However, Gabe’s right thigh didn’t have enough nerves. He went through a second surgery the next week when the skin from his left thigh was used. Gabriel stayed in the hospital for three weeks and his urethra closed. Three months later, Gabe had a third operation. He met with a doctor, Roberto Cardona, in Colombia on 90DF to discuss breast removal surgery.

Cleo, 32, was one of the fan-favorites of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Cleo was dating the 30-year-old Christian from Minnesota, whose family was against the relationship once they found out Cleo was trans. During her introduction, Cleo shared she was autistic and was assigned male at birth but identified as a transgender woman. Cleo had more female friends than male friends. She tried hard to fit in with the boys she was growing up with, but something didn’t feel right. “It was just so hard to look in the mirror or to simply go about my daily life,” she confessed.




Cleo used to go to sleep and pray that she would wake up as a girl the next morning. Cleo also worried that she would never be accepted as a girl by the people in her life. It was hard enough being autistic and Cleo didn’t want to complicate matters. However, Cleo decided to do what she felt was right. Cleo felt insecure about meeting Christian in person. She worried how he’d react upon seeing her Adam’s apple or her hairline. “I&#39;ll probably get a boob job,” Cleo said while revealing she was yet to get top surgery. She took daily medication, hormones, and testosterone blockers.

Cleo explained there was a “whole array of surgery” that some trans women would choose to have. They could get their hairline lowered or have their Adam’s apple shaved. While Cleo didn’t have any hesitations about having surgery, she was also trying to find the “right time and place.” Cleo also was waiting for the right person to come along. “You don’t just wanna have surgery with anybody,” Cleo explained. In October 2023, Cleo started a GoFundMe, so she could afford transitioning. Cleo admitted she didn’t have the financial means to undergo gender confirmation. Cleo has so far raised $9,039 out of her $44,625 target.

Nikki is the newest trans cast member in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. Nikki’s gender identity plays a major part in her relationship with her partner, Igor, AKA, Justin. Nikki from Hoboken, New Jersey was born a boy and reportedly spent over $1 million to turn into a human Barbie. Nikki was born as Jason Torres. According to her interview with TheSun, Nikki knew she was different from the time she was two years old. Nikki was obsessed with putting on makeup and nail polish and, at four, discovered her love for Barbie dolls. Nikki says she was bullied for being flamboyant at school.

Nikki was called “cover girl” and “pretty boy” along with homophobic names by her classmates, who also used to beat her up. Nikki grew up worshiping pop stars like Madonna as her idols. She always wanted to look like Barbie and was stopped from playing with her cousin’s dolls at four. Nikki remembers raiding her mom’s closet and dreaming of being on MTV. All Nikki wanted was to be able to look into the mirror and escape the pain she felt as a child. Nikki wanted to “look like a totally different person.” She was wearing concealer in middle school and using an eyebrow pencil.




Nikki discovered transsexual and transvestite bars where she met trans-men and started taking illegal hormones. Nikki was having body-modifying injections to achieve her dream. Nikki underwent gender reassignment surgery at 19 years old. It was after she’d already received three nose jobs, two breast enlargement procedures, and an Adam&#39;s apple reduction. After that, Nikki did another string of procedures including breast enhancements, nose jobs, lifts, tucks, fixing botched surgery, voice therapy, and even got her eye color changed. The Botox, fillers, facials, peels, makeup, lashes, hair extensions, and tanning were also an expensive affair for her. Nikki began her professional career as a plastic surgery consultant.

Nikki was 30 years old when she met 20-year-old Justin in Moldova years ago. Nikki was living in stealth. She had not announced to the world that she was a trans woman. She didn’t hang out with gay men and only had female friends. Justin believed she was a cis woman, which is why when Nikki told Justin she was trans during a fight they had in America, Justin flew back home and lived in depression for several years. Nikki and Justin got back together before 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Nikki believes Justin is still not able to wrap his head around her being a trans woman.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
