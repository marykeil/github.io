# 1 One Piece Anime Arc Will Be Even More Important In Season 2 After Netflixs Live-Action Changes


## SUMMARY 



One Piece season 2 must properly handle important arcs and characters from the source material to redeem itself for excluding them in the first season.   The Reverse Mountain Arc is crucial for the bonding and character development of the Straw Hat Pirates, and its depiction will be pivotal for the success of season 2.   The second season needs to ensure stronger relationships among the crew members to replicate the success of the first season and accommodate future additions to the Straw Hat Pirates.

## Literature Review
Although Netflix&#39;s handling of the Straw Hat Pirates was well-received, there&#39;s plenty of other members viewers have yet to see bond with each other.




Although One Piece&#39;s first season is enjoying major success for its handling of some of the source material&#39;s early arcs, One Piece season 2 will still need to properly handle a specific arc from the source material. Unlike most live-action adaptations of anime and manga, the success of One Piece&#39;s first season is attributable to Netflix&#39;s vested interest in the source material as well as its subversion of events and big character moments. However, despite the ways in which the live-action adaptation innovates its storytelling, its eight-episode structure means that certain important characters and story arcs are omitted from the first season.



Nevertheless, One Piece can still redeem itself for excluding important members both on the side of good and evil if its second season carefully structures who will show up and at which point they&#39;ll make their live-action debut. Among many things, the One Piece anime and manga are renowned globally for their unique art styles, arcs, and, arguably most importantly, their characters. Moreover, the relationship between the characters featured throughout the long-running series has resulted in some of the greatest displays of character development seen in any anime or manga. With One Piece season 2 in development, Netflix can replicate the source material&#39;s character development.

One of One Piece&#39;s greatest strengths is its depiction of the Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the dynamic between each of the crew members. However, with only eight episodes to work with, Netflix prioritized Luffy, Zoro, and Nami&#39;s screentime and character development over its other original members, Usopp and Sanji. Furthermore, Nico Robin, Tony Tony Chopper, and Nefertari Vivi haven&#39;t made their live-action debuts yet, thus further complicating the live-action depiction of the Straw Hat Pirates. While Tony Tony Chopper is set to appear in One Piece season 2 thus suggesting Vivi and Robin will too, there&#39;s an even greater issue at hand.

One Piece season 2 faces a greater issue in properly depicting the Straw Hat Pirates bonding via the inclusion of the brief yet beloved Reverse Mountain Arc. The Reverse Mountain Arc is the first entry into the Alabasta Saga, and it sees the characters split up into small groups to help rescue the citizens of Loguetown from Captain Alvida, Buggy, and Smoker, thus strengthening their bond. Furthermore, viewers are given glimpses into each member&#39;s personal lives via flashbacks as seen when they&#39;re separated completely. Even though Alabasta will be in One Piece season 2, its success hinges on its depiction of the crew growing close.

One Piece&#39;s excluding Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, and Nefertari Vivi also means that future members Franky, Brook, and Jinbe might not make their live-action debuts until much later down the line. However, this decision can work if the show follows one detail from the anime by setting up Brook&#39;s eventual membership via the inclusion of the Rumbar Pirates. Although the Straw Hat Pirates are among the smaller crews in One Piece, each member is diverse and interesting enough to compensate for their lack of membership. However, One Piece&#39;s second season needs to ensure the relationships between the crew are stronger if it wants to replicate season one&#39;s success.

One Piece (Live-Action) Based on the popular manga/anime series, One Piece is a live-action Netflix adaptation of the story from Eiichiro Oda.
