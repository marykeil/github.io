## Literature Review

A great anime series can benefit from having striking visuals, a compelling story, and great music â€“ but nothing beats a strong supporting cast.




The best anime supporting casts will boast characters who not only uplift the series&#39; protagonists, but will add their own unique flair to the story. Although supporting cast size is a factor in its utility, a large cast is not always necessary for success.
Anime from any genre, from comedy to action, and anything in between, relies heavily on character development to create a compelling story. Particularly, characters who work closest to the main characters are one of the driving factors in narrative movement and creating nuance in protagonists, even if not directly. They develop alongside each other, creating a cycle of exponentially growing character complexity.

 10  Grand Blue Dreaming&#39;s Diving Club Is a House of Comedy 
Based on the manga by Inoue Kenji and Yoshioka Kimitake
        

The 2018 knee-slapping anime produced by Studio Zero-G, Grand Blue Dreaming, is a prime example of how a collective of university students with no sense of shame and too much time on their hands, can create a hilarious story out of anything. The series follows Kitahara Iori, a college first-year who moves to the coastal town named Izu, where his uncle lives and runs a scuba diving shop. Iori&#39;s primary goal for college in this seaside town is to have the most ideal, mainstream experience possible, but he is quickly dragged into the antics of the university diving club full of streakers, enablers, and more, who come together for some raucous laughter.

 9  Chihayafuru&#39;s Niche Community Is Set For Endless Rivalries 
Based on the manga by Suetsugu Yuki
        

The 2011 sports drama anime produced by Madhouse, Chihayafuru, is a one-of-a-kind series that follows Ayase Chihaya, but extrapolates from so many other characters. Because the main focus of the Chihayafuru is the sport of Karuta, a card game based on the greatest classic Japanese short poems, the characters represent a niche, and consequently small, community. The top Karuta players will be members of the same societies and meet the same rivals in tournaments. Chihayafuru uses this aspect of Karuta to create a deep, close-knit cast of characters that both challenge Chihaya and lift her up, as chance encounters become more and more common.

The series follows Kiriyama Rei, a young shogi genius who has been forced to mature too quickly, losing himself in a world of stress and loneliness. However, it&#39;s the characters he meets at his lowest point that change everything for him and the entire story.

 7  Saiki K&#39;s Characters Are Embodiments of Psychic Powers 
Based on the manga by Asou Shuuichi
        

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K is a gag comedy anime that leans into the personality of the main character, Kusuo Saiki, one of the most interesting psychics in anime. However, the value that the supporting cast adds to the series is not to be underestimated.
Each friend or acquaintance of Saiki is a foil to his own character. For example, the class rep with a fiery spirit named Hairo Kenishi, whose name sounds like Pyrokinesis, is a representation of this exact skill that Saiki has. Furthermore, he&#39;s more inclined to use this skill over his telepathy, which is a constant headache for him, much like the character named Teruhashi, who bugs him to no end.

 6  One Punch Man&#39;s Cast Defines Saitama&#39;s Strength 
Based on the manga by ONE and Murata Yusuke


 







One Punch Man is an action anime like no other, as it takes the superhero genre as satire and adds new twists to each of Saitama&#39;s eccentric actions. Throughout the series, Saitama is portrayed as the strongest man, capable of defeating anything with one punch, but he largely goes unnoticed for his work, and is even denounced. However, everything is clear to the audience, adding a dramatic irony that advocates for supporting Saitama through his internal struggles. Ultimately, this sort of storytelling is only made possible by the strong supporting cast and their ability to serve as reference for understanding both Saitama&#39;s strength and his loneliness.

 5  Yu Yu Hakusho&#39;s Main Quartet Is Iconic 
Based on the manga by Togashi Yoshihiro


 







Yu Yu Hakusho is an anime from the early 1990s produced by Studio Pierrot that defined and set the standard for the modern shonen battle series. Although the anime is well-known for its incredible arc structure and narrative development, the characters that support protagonist Urameshi Yusuke, are often taken for granted. Firstly, the demon world duo of Kurama and Hiei are characters as unique and compelling as Yusuke, if not more. Their additions to the narrative allow Yusuke&#39;s character to be able to take a backseat at times, but ultimately raises his ability to create complicated networks of connection. Of course, there is still the unforgettable pompadour-rocking Kuwabara.

 4  Kaguya-sama Is So Much More Than Just About Kaguya 
Based on the manga by Akasaka Aka
        

The anime titled Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a modern heart-stopping romance series produced by A-1 Pictures that premiered in 2019. Although the namesake of the anime belongs to Shinomiya Kaguya, the wide variety of supporting cast is what makes the anime a stand-out work of cinema. Firstly, there is the bubbly and eccentric Fujiwara Chika, who sports the strongest sixth sense when needed least, and busts out bars of rap at the funniest moment possible. Then, there is Ishigami Yuu, who is perpetually misunderstood, but grounds the student council in reality. Lastly, Shirogane Miyuki is not even part of the supporting cast, serving as a second protagonist, and seemingly Kaguya&#39;s antagonist.

 3  Gintama Has the Wackiest Aliens and Non-Aliens 
Based on the manga Sorachi Hideaki
        

The hit comedy Gintama has brought laughter to audiences of all demographics since its debut in 2006 at Sunrise Studios. The premise of the series is a singularity, as the world of the protagonist, Sakata Gintoki, has been colonized by aliens. Better yet, the time is Japan&#39;s Edo period. Naturally, such a setting allows for the wackiest characters to congregate, even those with little to do with the aliens themselves. From the hilarious mascots of a giant space dog named Sadaharu who goes berserk for strawberry milk and a penguin-suit-looking blob named Elizabeth, to a samurai who can&#39;t be taken seriously, Gintama creates the perfect platform for comedy.

 2  One Piece Can&#39;t Go Wrong With The Straw Hat Crew 
Based on the original manga by Eiichiro Oda


 







One of the most popular and well-known shonen anime, One Piece, is a series that prides itself on its creative characters and the connections they make. The entire premise hinges on Luffy&#39;s ability to muster up a group of like-minded individuals to achieve his goal of becoming the King of Pirates. However, as an eccentric himself, Luffy expects no less from his crew members, as he sometimes chooses companions seemingly based on no reason at all. The most compelling part of this supporting cast is that each character is so thorough that they could even operate as focal points of an arc, even without the presence of the protagonist.

 1  Durarara!! Is Basically All Supporting Cast 
Based on the light novels and manga by Narita Ryohgo and Yasuda Suzuhito
        

The 2010 hit action mystery series Durarara!! is an anime that weaves intricate stories among a wide cast of characters, each having their chance to take the stage. Although the series takes an initial focus on characters such as the motorcycle-riding dullahan named Celty, or the high school boy named Ryuugamine Mikado, the story expands further and further each time it takes the perspective of a different character. As a result, the bustling town of Ikebukuro comes together as a perfect web of connections; one Russian sushi chef at a time, and one shades-wearing short-fused bartender at a time.
