The final charter is upon the Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 crew in a preview clip, but one of the members of Motoryacht Mustique will not make it to the end of the season due to illness. Season 8 has been plagued by drama, both from the crew and the goings-on with the yacht during each charter. Some crew members have left and been replaced, several of the team members from the interior and the exterior have gotten sick, and interpersonal boat relationship drama has been at an all-time high in the Below Deck franchise. That said, this season holds one more surprise ailment from a beloved deck team member.




A Bravo clip showcased the dynamics at play in the final charter between the crew and the conditions. The preview namely showed deck team member Haleigh Gorman&#39;s return after being sick and the exit of lead deckhand Lara Dupreez due to illness. The beginning of the clip showed Captain Sandy Yawn telling Lara to stay in bed while she awaits a doctor&#39;s visit.


 

Upon Haleigh&#39;s return, Lara leaves their shared room and tells Haleigh, &#34;Sandy wants me off the boat.&#34; During her exit, Lara tells Chef Jack Luby, &#34;I can&#39;t stay. I don&#39;t want to infect you guys.&#34; Lara&#39;s exit means that there are three deck crew members left. On top of that, Captain Sandy relayed that the wind was high and waves were huge, and the boat wasn&#39;t going to be able to leave the dock.

Before her exit on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, Lara spoke in a private interview saying that it has been a really great season for her. Lara is a brand new addition to the Below Deck franchise and she has been well-received by viewers. Lara remarked, &#34;I&#39;ve made so much progress personally.&#34; She brought up her lead deckhand promotion and how much she&#39;s been able to prove her value before saying that she hated ending the season being sick. However, she laughingly stated in what could be a foreshadow, &#34;I&#39;ll be back b***hes.&#34;




Fortunately for the boat, Haleigh came back as Lara was leaving, so the deck team had enough crew to continue on. The beginning of the preview clip showed Haleigh on the phone with Captain Sandy saying it had been a rough couple of days but that she was &#34;feeling better 101% better.&#34; Captain Sandy was relieved because she needed &#34;able seamen.&#34; In her private interview, Haleigh further stated that the dynamic on the boat may be &#34;psychotic and crazy, but I would take that 10 times over than barfing in a hotel room.&#34;

Haleigh&#39;s return and Lara&#39;s exit marks just another wild situation on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8. Kyle Viljoen summed up the season&#39;s drama during the preview video by mentioning his conflict with Natalya Scudder and Jack, although he also had issues with Jessika Asai, Max Salvador, and Captain Sandy. Moreover, many crew members got sick this season and then there was the whole fraudulent papers situation with the original bosun, Ruan Irving. Not to mention, the charter guests this season have been demanding. Below Deck Mediterranean fans should keep watching to find out how the season ends among the crew and what note their charter season will end on.
