  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>These 90 Day Fiancé cast members aren&rsquo;t faking it when they refer to themselves as professional &ldquo;models&rdquo; on social media and on the reality TV show.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé franchise has several cast members claiming to be models, but only a few have managed to do it professionally. The franchise has featured several cast members from the time it launched season 1 in 2014, and there have been plenty that have made it big on social media since. Some have turned into influencers, who are Instagram models, promoting products in exchange for money.</p>
<p>However, there are those stars who have been featured on magazine covers and in fashion campaigns, proving they have what it takes to be a model. Here’s a look at all such celebrities from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise who are into modeling for a living. They are the ones posing for fashion pictures, getting fitted into the best designer clothing, and advertising a variety of products with ease instead of using the reality TV show as a platform to launch careers as snake oil salesmen or making it big in adult modeling.</p>

Kobe’s picture was featured in an Asian magazine. Kobe had one hand on his head and the other on his hips. “Ahhhh, this explains A LOT!!!!!” a fan wrote in Kobe’s comments.</p>
<p>Meisha Johnson
Meisha Was The Face Of A Cat Food Brand</p>
<p>Meisha from 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days is a woman of many talents. Apart from being a reality TV star, she works as a Catholic spiritual director, is a Ph.D. student, former CBS &amp; FOX anchor, and runs a website called Psalm91 with partner Nicola Kanaan. Meisha has also done a fair bit of acting and modeling in the past. She was the face of a Joy of Cooking promotion around 2008, modeled for Purina Cat Chow with her two daughters in a national campaign in 2012, and also features on the cover of a 2012 Biblical romance novel titled Love in a Broken Vessel.</p>
<p>Cleo Corraine
Cleo&rsquo;s Modeling Work Is Getting Noticed</p>
<p>When Cleo introduced herself as a model on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6, she wasn’t kidding. Cleo, who is based in London, is signed with an inclusive modeling agency called Zebedee Talent. Autistic trans woman Cleo has been randomly spotted on fashion websites by fans who were shopping online. Cleo has done modeling work for brands such as Primark, Mr.Oystr, Luna London Studio, and Haus Labs. Recently, Cleo opened up about not having the financial means to undergo gender confirmation procedures. She started a GoFundMe to make her dream come true. Hopefully, the exposure via reality TV will help Cleo get more modeling contracts in 2024.</p>
<p>Rishi Singh
Rishi Calls Himself &ldquo;Indian Jesus&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rishi from Jaipur was already working as a model and personal trainer when he bumped into Jen Boecher in a hotel lobby over three years ago. Rishi, who referred to himself as “Indian Jesus” on The Other Way claims he’s the only man in Jaipur with long hair. Moreover, Rishi’s fit physique gets him a lot of attention from women. Rishi has a law degree and briefly worked as a corporate lawyer, but he felt trapped in the job. His Instagram updates reveal that Rishi has walked the ramp for umpteen fashion designers at various India-based fashion shows apart from doing some acting in YouTube shows such as Pakdarpan.</p>
<p>Rose Vega
Rose Looks Unrecognizable!</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé star Rose has completely transformed herself since her split with Big Ed Brown in Before the 90 Days season 4. Rose became such a huge internet sensation that she transformed herself overnight and is now able to provide a good life for herself and her son. In July 2022, Rose shocked the world with her iconic purple fringed dress look. Fans had compared Rose to Taylor Swift. In April 2022, Rose became the face of Morena women for Kayu Beauty cosmetics and made everyone swoon. Rose is now thriving as a social media creator with 580k followers.</p>
<p>Fernanda Flores
Fernanda Is Making Her Dreams Come True</p>
<p>Fernanda had met Jonathan Rivera at a club in Mexico and got engaged to him just three months later. They got married in 90 Day Fiancé season 6 in 2018 and had a bitter divorce. Fernanda has stayed back in America since her split and has been making a living as a model. In July 2019, Fernanda made her runway model debut for LOUNGE UNDERWEAR at Miami Swim Week. She’s also worked with brands such as Fab Fit Fin and She Is Beauty Boss. Reddit user u/mariel_f spotted Fernanda in an online advertisement for Scrubs. “That&rsquo;s great! I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s been able to achieve her goal of being a working model!” wrote a fan.</p>
<p>Winter Everett
Winter Is Promoting Body Positivity</p>
<p>Chantel Everett’s kid sister, Winter, was tired of living under her famous sister’s shadow. Her weight also made her feel insecure. Winter underwent weight-loss surgery in Mexico and has since lost over 100 pounds. In November 2022, Winter hinted at a major career move by posing in a stylish olive green outfit for a women’s fashion label. A different picture shared by @antoine.stephenson shows Winter dressed in a shiny sequined silver wraparound dress, perfect for the holiday season with a champagne flute in her hands.</p>
<p>Natalie Mordovtseva
Natalie Starred In A Music Video</p>
<p>While Natalie’s dreams of becoming a model at 39 in Los Angeles are mocked by 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 fans, she was successful in her career back when she still lived in Ukraine. Natalie had two degrees in psychology and journalism. However, she chose to be a model and an actress. Natalie acted in TV shows of the crime/thriller genre and modeled for fashion brands. She was also featured in a music video by Irish singer EDEN. Natalie starred in the post-apocalyptic video titled “Float” and did a great job at it. Perhaps 2024 will bring along better acting and modeling assignments for Natalie to showcase her modeling talents.</p>
<p>Juliana Custodio
Julia Has Been Modeling Since Her Teenage Years</p>
<p>Juliana from 90 Day Fiancé season 7 didn’t have an easy childhood. She started working when she was eight and had three jobs when she was 12. Juliana’s mom had tried to leave her abusive father and the two had to live on the streets when Juliana was five. Juliana worked as a seamstress but wanted to be the one who wore the clothes. She started her own factory at 14 but sold it, so she could live in São Paulo and become a model. She moved to China in 2015. However, Juliana had a horrible experience there. She couldn’t even speak English.</p>
<p>Juliana got signed by an agency based in Milan and soon moved there and that’s when her life changed forever. The 90 Day Fiancé star has shared several career milestones with her fans, including her feature in Elle Arabia. Juliana’s social media pages document her new life with her husband, Ben Obscura, and their baby boy, Benjamin, along with her modeling projects.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
