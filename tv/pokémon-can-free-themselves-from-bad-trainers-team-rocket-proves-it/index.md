## Literature Review
An episode of Pokémon Journeys proved that Pokémon actually can escape from a bad trainer, and the answer as to how is a deceptively simple one.




It can be a tough life for Pokémon in the Pokémon world, captured by a trainer whom they usually know little about, and that&#39;s especially true if they end up in the hands of an evil trainer, like Team Rocket. For Pokémon trapped in such a situation, however, there is one recourse left that will allow them to escape: destroying their own Poké Ball.




In the episode of Pokémon Journeys entitled &#34;When A House is Not A Home!&#34;, Team Rocket use their Rocket Prize Master, a device which gives them randomly selected Pokémon with which to do battle. One of the Pokémon that&#39;s supposed to pop out is a Grookey, but the ball is empty, as this Grookey had already been accidentally summoned earlier and was currently wandering free. Grookey has been enjoying its newfound freedom, and begins to grow close to Goh, who wakes up with Grookey clinging to his arm.

          

As Ash and Goh attempt to discover Grookey&#39;s origin, they soon find themselves face to face with Team Rocket.


 Grookey Released Itself By Destroying Its Poké Ball 
          




Team Rocket don&#39;t realize that the Grookey is technically theirs until they receive the empty ball, at which point Jessie uses it to recall Grookey, forcibly bringing it with them. Grookey wanders out of Team Rocket&#39;s secret base later, and eventually runs into Goh, who it is happy to see it. This sparks a confrontation between Ash and Goh and Team Rocket, who gleefully remind Goh that Grookey is legitimately theirs. Jessie attempts to recall Grookey again, but it dodges the beam and Pikachu knocks the ball free of her grip, at which point Grookey uses its stick to smash the ball in two, destroying both the ball and Team Rocket&#39;s ownership of Grookey in one fell swoop.

Goh ends up catching Grookey for himself in a different Poké Ball, proving that the destruction of a Pokémon&#39;s Poké Ball is effectively the same as releasing it, presumably as some kind of fail-safe for the Pokémon&#39;s safety. Balls have been destroyed before in the anime, such as Jessie herself destroying the ball for her Dustox when she released it, but never by a Pokémon. It means that a Pokémon under the control of a trainer it doesn&#39;t like does have at least one recourse to escape, and it&#39;s amazing that this isn&#39;t more of a problem when it comes to capturing extremely powerful Pokémon that aren&#39;t well-adapted to dealing with trainers.






 Pokémon Don&#39;t Know That They Can Free Themselves From Trainers 
          

On several occasions, Pokémon under the ownership of evil trainers (such as Jessie and James&#39; Ekans and Koffing) have maintained that they only do evil because their trainers ask them to. These Pokémon may simply not realize that they have the capacity to free themselves, or it may be that they do care for their trainers, even in spite of the evil deeds that they do. The possibility of a Pokémon destroying its own Poké Ball also lends some credence to the idea that a Pokémon capture is a partnership--both parties always have the option of walking away, and it&#39;s a testament to Pokémon&#39;s inherent loyalty that this is such a rare thing.
