After a long hiatus, the popular game show Deal Or No Deal is back in February with Deal Or No Deal Island. Fans can expect some major twists.




One of NBC&#39;s most popular game shows, Deal Or No Deal, is coming back, but this time it&#39;s set on a tropical island, now titled Deal Or No Deal Island.

This time it&#39;s changing the game by bringing contestants to a mysterious tropical island where they&#39;ll compete against each other in intense physical and mental challenges. Simply put, this new version of the show is Deal Or No Deal meets Survivor.
