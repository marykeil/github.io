## Literature Review
The Masked Singer airs a two-night event, which includes its Holiday Sing-A-Long and the Group C finals, featuring Soundtrack to My Life Night.




The Masked Singer season 10 features a special two-night event, including its annual Holiday Sing-A-Long and the Group C finals, which will be Soundtrack to My Life Night. The Masked Singer season 10 welcomed back host Nick Cannon and panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger for its milestone season. The Holiday Sing-A-Long is now a Masked Singer tradition, and showcases the contestants singing classic holiday music. The Group C finals will determine which contestant--Anteater, Candelabra, or Donut--joins Gazelle, Cow, and Sea Queen in the season finale.




In a promo shared via YouTube, The Masked Singer season 10 announced the special two-night event which will air on Tuesday, December 12 (Holiday Sing-A-Long) and Wednesday, December 13 (Group C Finals).


 

The teaser begins with Nick saying, &#34;Get ready to jingle bell rock!&#34; A voiceover then says, &#34;We&#39;re stuffing your stocking with two nights of Masked Singer magic.&#34; Tuesday is the Holiday Sing-A-Long, which the promo says will feature &#34;two hours of cheer and making spirits bright.&#34; Cow appears to be singing &#34;making spirits bright,&#34; indicating that he might be singing &#34;Jingle Bells.&#34; Soundless clips of Gazelle, Hawk, Sea Queen, and Donut&#39;s holiday performances were also shown.

 What To Expect From The Masked Singer Season 10 Group C Finals 
          

On Wednesday, the last Masked Singer group final will take place on Soundtrack to My Life Night, as Anteater, Candelabra, and Donut compete for the final spot in the season finale. A clip from Candelabra&#39;s performance of Mary J. Blige&#39;s &#34;I&#39;m Going Down&#34; was shown. Jenny shouts, &#34;Go, girl!,&#34; while Nicole declares, &#34;I have goosebumps.&#34; As Nick announces who secured the final spot in the season finale, Robin says, &#34;I can&#39;t watch.&#34; Jenny then lies on the panelists&#39; table, and hits it. Of course, the winner of the Group C finals won&#39;t be revealed until the episode airs.

The Masked Singer Holiday Sing-A-Long is a fun and festive tradition. In the past, it not only treated viewers to incredible performances of classic holiday songs from contestants who appeared throughout the season, but also to new clues about the finalists. Hopefully, the same will be true this year. The Group C finals should be thrilling, considering how much talent Anteater, Candelabra, and Donut have. Only one of them can advance to the season finale because the panelists used their one Ding Dong Keep It On Bell save on Group A&#39;s Gazelle.




The two Masked Singer finalists who are unmasked will join the group of previously revealed contestants, including Group A&#39;s Anthony Anderson (Rubber Ducky), Tom Sandoval (Diver), Michael Rapaport (Pickle), and Ashley Parker Angel (S&#39;More). In addition, Group B&#39;s Billie Jean King (Royal Hen), Tyler Posey (Hawk), Ginuwine (Husky), and Sebastian Bach (Tiki) have been unmasked, along with Group C&#39;s Luann de Lesseps (Hibiscus) and Metta World Peace (Cuddle Monster). The Masked Singer season 10 has been one of the best yet.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX. The Masked Singer Holiday Sing-a-Long airs Tuesday, December 12.
