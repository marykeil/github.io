# Sister Wives Why The Claims That Robyn Brown “Speaks Kody” Are Nonsense


## SUMMARY 



  Robyn&#39;s claim that she&#39;s the only one who &#34;speaks Kody&#34; is nonsense. The other wives have known him longer and have been navigating his moods for decades.   Robyn convinced Meri, Janelle, and Christine that she knew Kody best, but they are now speaking out against her claims.   Robyn&#39;s assertion that she can speak Kody&#39;s language is a manipulative move to solidify her power in the crumbling family, but all the wives can communicate with him.

## Literature Review
Meri Brown claimed she used Robyn Brown to mediate conversations with Kody Brown. Here&#39;s why that&#39;s nonsense.




In the latest episode of Sister Wives season 18, Meri Brown explained that she used Robyn Brown to mediate her conversations with Kody Brown, the family patriarch, because Robyn &#34;speaks Kody,&#34; but that analysis is nonsense. Robyn is the only Brown family wife still married to Kody, making their relationship ostensibly monogamous. Arguably, Robyn and Kody&#39;s relationship with Sister Wives ruined the rest of the marriages. Kody&#39;s other wives, Meri, Christine Brown, and Janelle Brown, left the reality TV star between 2021 and 2022. While Meri coined the term &#34;speaking Kody&#34; in the December 3 Tell-All episode, Christine and Janelle pushed back.




Kody isn&#39;t the easiest person to deal with, and Robyn tends to act more rationally than the Sister Wives patriarch. However, her latest assertions seem to position Robyn to solidify her leg up on the remaining wives, all of whom are estranged from Kody. While Meri and Janelle struggle to separate from Kody, Christine remarried and is freer than ever. Robyn&#39;s positioning herself as the best person to translate Kody&#39;s commentary is just the latest in manipulative moves, and it&#39;s nonsense.


 Meri, Christine, and Janelle Have Known Kody Longer Than Robyn 
How Could She &#34;Speak Kody&#34; Better Than Them?

Robyn seems to think she can interpret Kody&#39;s directness better than Meri, Christine, or Janelle, but his three original wives have all known him way longer than Robyn. Meri and Kody spent 32 years together before splitting up, as she was his first wife. Janelle and Kody were together for nearly 20 years, and Christine and Kody were together for almost 19. While he was never legally married to either of them, they were spiritually married.




In contrast, Robyn was brought into the family in 2010, 16 years after he married Christine. Robyn may be the best at communicating with Kody now, and she&#39;s the only one not making him angry, but it&#39;s unfair to say she&#39;s the only one who &#34;speaks Kody&#34;-- the other wives have been mitigating his moods and lack of filter for decades.



 Robyn Convinced Meri, Janelle, and Christine That She Knew Kody Best 
Robyn Always Positions Herself Above The Other Wives
          

Somehow, Robyn convinced Meri, Christine, and Janelle that she knew Kody best. While it&#39;s undoubtedly true she became closest to him, surprisingly, she was able to convince the other wives she had usurped years of an established relationship with Kody. However, Janelle and Christine are speaking out against Robyn&#39;s claims.

Christine didn&#39;t mince words when addressing Robyn&#39;s claims, asserting in the most recent episode of Sister Wives, &#34;I met him when I was 18. I’ve known Kody for a long time, and I can actually read Kody pretty well. And I can speak Kody well, too.&#34; While Meri still might believe Robyn&#39;s assertions are factual, Janelle and Christine won&#39;t be fooled anymore. Janelle agreed with Christine, adding, &#34;I’m like, ‘Well, I don’t know if I really need someone to translate for me. We’ve been married a long time. We did OK without you.&#34;






 How Robyn’s Behavior Reflects Her Typical Manipulation 
Robyn&#39;s Arrogance Is A Pattern Of Behavior
          

Robyn&#39;s assertion that she&#39;s the only one of Kody&#39;s wives who can speak his language is a typical symptom of her constant manipulation of the other wives. As soon as she became part of the family, she was angling to become the primary wife and usurp her fellow sister wives. When Meri, Janelle, and Christine began to feel Kody&#39;s blatant favoritism toward Robyn and her kids, Robyn masterfully played the victim. Her desire to serve as translator for the family patriarch even as his other wives have left him is yet another move to position herself in a place of power in the crumbling family. While Meri might be less wary of Robyn, Christine, and Janelle are right to place some of the blame on their failed relationship with Kody squarely on Robyn.




All four of Kody&#39;s current and former wives can speak his language; he&#39;s not some mystical being requiring a patient translator. He&#39;s an arrogant, manipulative man who doesn&#39;t mince words, adding to the hurt he can wield over his exes. While Christine was able to separate herself from her former spouse, the other women are still struggling in his orbit. Robyn&#39;s assertions that she &#34;speaks Kody&#34; are nonsense and another way for the last remaining wife to wield power on Sister Wives. Luckily, it&#39;s easy to see through her lies.



Sister Wives season 18 airs Sundays on TLC at 10 p.m. ET.




               Sister Wives   Summary:   Sister Wives follows the brown family, which observes polygamist practices. Headed by Kody Brown as the father, he and his four wives and their 18 children have moved across the United States, from Utah to Nevada and Arizona. Kody and his wives have secret marriages, as polygamy is illegal. Still, the show follows the family as it covers the trials and tribulations of four wives that split their familial duties of themselves amongst one husband and eighteen children. The children themselves are a significant focus of Sister Wives, as it also focuses on the challenges the children face due to their home life.Sister Wives attempts to dispel negative stereotypes around polygamy, as it aired around 2010 when the general public commonly discussed the topic in the United States. The four Brown wives agreed to participate in the show to accomplish this goal, and TLC continues to chronicle the family&#39;s life over a decade later.
