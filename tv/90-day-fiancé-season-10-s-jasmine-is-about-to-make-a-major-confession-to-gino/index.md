## Literature Review
Jasmine Pineda hasn’t been completely honest with Gino Palazzolo. She’s ready to reveal the truth in an upcoming episode of 90 Day Fiancé season 10.




Jasmine Pineda has a big secret she will confess when 90 Day Fiancé season 10 returns to TV in 2024. The 36-year-old Panamanian star has never had a stable relationship with Gino Palazzolo. However, her last few months with her beau in the United States have been particularly toxic. When Jasmine landed in Michigan after her k-1 visa got approved, she realized she couldn’t live there due to the cold. Soon after, she found lip gloss in Gino’s car and accused him of infidelity. In December 2023, she threatened to cancel the wedding if Gino invited his family.




Jasmine hasn’t been grateful or truthful to Gino throughout their relationship. In a recent 90 Day Fiancé season 10 trailer, she talks about deceiving and lying to her man. She says, “I have lied to Gino,” hinting that she has probably done something immoral behind his back.


 

While Jasmine doesn&#39;t reveal her wrongdoing, the next scene in the trailer shows Gino facepalming himself with disgust. His reaction makes it seem like Jasmine will likely confess to him about what she has done, which could be an act of unfaithfulness or some other lie.

 90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Gino Proposes To Jasmine Again 
          




The post-holiday trailer for 90 Day Fiancé season 10 also shows Jasmine and Gino reaching another major milestone. One of the earlier scenes in the trailer reveals Gino proposing to Jasmine with a new ring as she bewilderedly asks him, “What is that?” Gino then responds to her by calling her his “baby,” and Jasmine cries out of excitement. It isn’t clear why Gino is proposing to Jasmine again or giving her another ring. However, it could be related to Jasmine’s demands from the previous seasons or something more special.

Jasmine doesn&#39;t hint at anything else in the trailer. Therefore, it’s hard to pinpoint what she&#39;s referring to when she claims she lied to Gino. The only thing fans know Jasmine hasn’t told Gino yet is that she took some money from her ex-boyfriend for her gluteal augmentation surgery. In one of the previous episodes, the mom of two shared how Dan had helped her with her buttocks implants. She claimed she hadn’t yet shared this secret with Gino and looked guilty. Jasmine may be referring to the same in the trailer when she talked about lying.




Jasmine once seemed like an insecure woman with a mature personality. However, she has since tarnished her image by acting shady. Apart from having gross obsessions, Jasmine has behaved erratically in front of the cameras. In the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, she even implied that she had slept with her ex-boyfriend and had filmed a sex tape with him. She later claimed she only said those things to make Gino jealous. It’ll be interesting to see what the 90 Day Fiancé cast member has been hiding from Gino and if it affects their relationship.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
