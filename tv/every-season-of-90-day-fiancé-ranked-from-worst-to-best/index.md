## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé has aired nine jam-packed seasons since 2014. Noteworthy cast members, drama, and entertaining couples contribute to the ranking.




The reality series 90 Day Fiancé has become a massive hit since it debuted in 2014, and some seasons are better than others. At the same time, one of the best reality TV shows, not all seasons are created equal. All the 90DF installments, from the least inspiring to the most exciting, can be ranked. However, it&#39;s often hard to agree on which seasons of the reality TV show deserve &#34;best&#34; or &#34;worst&#34; labels. Nonetheless, the worst installment is more accessible to determine than the best. 90 Day Fiancé season 10 is ongoing but can still be stacked against previous seasons.
When 90 Day Fiancé first aired, the international romance show took a realistic look at four couples. The original premise revolved around foreign fiancés and fiancées joining their American partners in the USA, thanks to K-1 visas granted them 90 days to marry. The show has since expanded into a sprawling franchise accused of moving away from realism to focus on potentially contrived 90DF drama. New iterations showcase salacious fighting, life after marriage, divorce, and dating.









 








 10  90 Day Fiancé Season 9 
The Worst Season


 







Arguably, 90 Day Fiancé season 9&#39;s cast was the absolute worst. The plot lines were tired, reused, and even contrived in line with issues voiced by longtime fans in seasons 7 and 8. Couples had apparent compatibility issues, and there was nothing new or novel other than an attempt to draw couples from a more diverse set of locations.





 9  90 Day Fiancé Season 10 
Second Worst


 







Unfortunately, 90 Day Fiancé season 10&#39;s cast hasn&#39;t fared much better than the previous season. While it&#39;s ongoing, season 10 lacks the spark of past seasons. Uninspiring couples, recycled drama, and an emphasis on negativity leave viewers yearning for the authenticity and energy of earlier episodes. Some new storylines hold promise, but overall, season 10 feels like a rehash with less humor and fewer iconic moments.





 8  90 Day Fiancé Season 8 
Third Worst
        



 







The second-worst season is 90 Day Fiancé season 8. The show had moved too far from its original premise by this point. The season was focused on scripted drama rather than authentic relationships. Among the weakest plot lines was Natalie Mordovtseva&#39;s and Mike Youngquist&#39;s return, which aired repetitive drama. Meanwhile, Andrew Kenton and Amira Lollysa were a disastrous couple who never met on air before their split. During this season, Stephanie Davison shocked audiences by switching from her fiancé, Ryan Carr, to his cousin, Harris Flowers. The season 8 drama came across as dull and clunky.





 7  90 Day Fiancé Season 7 
Fourth Worst
        

The show was also veering off course with season 7, and viewers believed that 90 Day Fiancé was becoming more dramatic and much less relatable. However, some genuine couples salvaged the season, including Juliana Custodio and Michael Jessen, who are now unfortunately divorced. Juliana Custodio and Michael Jessen, who ended their marriage post-filming, salvaged the season.
Also, sweetheart couple Anna Campisi and Mursel Mistanoglu warmed viewers&#39; hearts.
Unfortunately, season 7 also aired the lousy behavior of franchise villains Angela Deem and Tania Maduro. The installment also showed the start of Mike and Natalie’s drama. Overall, when compared to other seasons, the drama was not that entertaining.





 6  90 Day Fiancé Season 1 
Average
        

While the original season was not the one that hooked most audiences, it does earn points for being the most authentic. Kirlyam Cox stood out as a highlight, thanks to her marriage to Alan Cox. Viewers immediately took to the kindhearted Brazilian beauty. Couples Mike and Aziza Eloshway and Louis and Aya Gattone also showcased authentic relationships.
Since it was the inaugural installment, there wasn&#39;t the forced drama that was prevalent in later seasons. However, Paola and Russ Mayfield were a polarizing (albeit memorable) couple. It was easy to dislike the couple’s storyline and doubt the duo&#39;s connection, especially when Paola urged Russ to leave his high-paying job to follow her to Miami.





 5  90 Day Fiancé Season 3 
Better Than Average
        

While season 3 is all right, it loses points for its lack of memorable storylines. The installment is favored for introducing several sweet and authentic couples, including Kyle &amp; Noon Huckabee, Loren Goldstone &amp; Alexei Brovarnik, and Melanie Bowers &amp; Devar Walters. However, it also featured one of the most uncomfortable franchise couples of all time, Mark and Nikki Shoemaker. It was disturbing that Mark chose to date a teenager who was 39 years younger than him, and older than all four of his adult children. Mark treated Nikki as though she was his child, which was deeply unsettling.





 4  90 Day Fiancé Season 6 
Mostly Entertaining
        

90 Day Fiancé season 6 takes spot number four. Thanks to the powerhouse Brazilian bombshell Larissa Lima, this season was memorable. She went to war with the family of her now ex-husband, Colt Johnson. Franchise regulars Kalani Faagata and Asuelu Pulaa also debuted, and there was messy drama between Ashley Martson and Jay Smith. The season might have made the top three if it weren’t for Leida Margaretha and Eric Rosenbrook. It was horrifying when Leida kicked Eric’s teenage daughter out of their home, and Eric backed his new partner&#39;s decision.





 3  90 Day Fiancé Season 5 
Quite Memorable
        

At number three is 90 Day Fiancé season 5. It started the memorable saga of Nicole Nafziger and Azan Tefou and was noteworthy for its excessive drama and hilarious quotes. Franchise staples, such as David Toborowsky and Annie Suwan, Libby Potthast and Andrei Castravet, and Molly Hopkins, were also introduced during season 5. Molly’s ex-husband, Luis Mendez, was widely disliked, and the couple aired memorable arguments. Eventually, Molly became a franchise regular known for her humorous commentary. Overall, the season was full of drama and compelling international romance stories.





 2  90 Day Fiancé Season 4 
Riveting &amp; Rewatchable
        

At number two is 90 Day Fiancé season 4. Arguably, the 90 Day Fiancé season 4 cast is the best. The critical couple is Anfisa Arkhipchenko and Jorge Nava, who earned the unofficial title of the most explosive franchise duo ever. However, it also introduced the start of the train wreck of Nicole Nafziger and Azan Tefou and franchise staples Chantel Everett and Pedro Jimeno.
Chantel and Pedro went on to star in The Family Chantel, but the couple is now divorcing. Few can forget Anfisa ordering Jorge to fetch her red makeup bag or Chantel’s parents accusing Pedro of “harvesting the American dollar” by marrying their daughter. Season 4 was packed with drama in all the best ways.





 1  90 Day Fiancé Season 2 
The Very Best
        

Number one of the original series is 90 Day Fiancé season 2. It is a very close call for the best season of all time. Season 4 might have the most impressive array of memorable franchise personalities. However, season 2 was the season that introduced Danielle Mullins and Mohammed Jbali.
The older American Danielle had an all-out bonkers relationship with her now ex-husband. It was bizarre yet emotional, and it captivated audiences. Uncovering the depth of Danielle and Mohamed’s deception made for premium content from the hit franchise. Season 2 also featured one of the sweetest and most genuine couples in the franchise, Danny and Amy Frishmuth.
Through its many spinoffs, 90DF continues to thrive but may need a bit of a makeover to continue to captivate audiences. Although differing opinions emerge, the show&#39;s earlier seasons are clearly better than the newer ones. As season 10 wraps, 90 Day Fiancé producers would be wise to listen to later seasons&#39; criticism and rework how the show presents itself.
90 Day Fiancé season 10 airs Sundays at 8 pm EDT on TLC.
