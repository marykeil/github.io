## Literature Review
The second set of Squid Game: The Challenge episodes dropped, and there were shocking twists, interactions, and eliminations throughout. Here are ten.




Many shocking moments have occurred in Squid Game: The Challenge, and episodes 6-9 were no different. The first five episodes were left on a cliffhanger as unsuspecting players paired with close friends and allies for a picnic only to discover the next challenge was a formidable game of marbles. While many fan favorites made it through the first few episodes, the marble game inevitably wiped out half of them. However, this was only the beginning of the drama on Squid Game: The Challenge, episodes 6-9.
Netflix is waiting to drop the Squid Game: The Challenge finale until December 6, but there are plenty of shocking twists to relive before the last episode airs. While certain iconic players such as Bryton (432) and Spencer (299) were brutally eliminated in the first four episodes, many of the favorites lived on, only to be picked off one by one in episodes 6-9. Gganbu Gang disappeared by the day, and Trey (301) and LeAnn (302) were forced to compete in marbles. What were some of the most shocking moments in Squid Game: The Challenge episodes 6-9?









 








 10  Trey Beat His Mom In Marbles 


 







While many pairs of close friends were forced to play each other in marbles after being tricked into sharing a picnic with their future opponents, no situation was more fraught than delivery driver Trey playing against his mother, LeAnn, a former New York Times editor. After a tense game, Trey took his mother out, eliminating her from the show. Both were fan favorites, and neither backed down from the challenge. Unfortunately, Trey was later eliminated after Ashley made herself the villain in Glass Bridge. He went out as a Squid Game: The Challenge hero.





 9  TJ Was Cursed With Spot #1 In Glass Bridge 
        

After making himself the captain in Warships and for a test of allegiance in episode 6, former professional basketball player TJ put a target on his back as a strong, well-liked player despite his propensity toward lengthy speeches. Unfortunately, he was effectively chosen for elimination leading up to Glass Bridge when he was placed first in the order. However, his placement didn&#39;t affect his attitude. After a rousing speech, TJ picked the wrong tile and was unceremoniously eliminated.





 8  The Women Overall Stuck Together 
        

Amanda (019) seized the chance at a large alliance when she encouraged the women to stick together after the marbles game, noticing there were only a few women left and plenty of men with strong alliances. Sure enough, Squid Game: The Challenge production planned a test of allegiance, and the women largely stuck together. Despite Mai (287) choosing to save her pal Chad (286) and Jackie (393) choosing to save top 3 Squid Game: The Challenge contestant Phill (451), all of the women made it through to the top 20.





 7  Mai Chose To Target Ashley During The Dice Game 
        

Mai flew under the radar for the first few episodes, usually seen only talking to Chad. However, her cunning began to show as she entered the top 3, finally targeting civil rights investigator Ashley. Choosing not to alert Chad to her plans to eliminate Ashley at the first chance she had, Mai got her chance when she was selected to go first in the dice game. While the rest of the players agreed to self-eliminate if they rolled a 6, Mai chose to eliminate Ashley if given a chance, citing her treatment of Trey during Glass Bridge. The move seemed to surprise the rest of the players, as she had been portrayed as sweet before the dice game.





 6  Three Players Self-Eliminated In The Dice Game 
        

The rest of the players, except Ashley, who retaliated by targeting Mai, chose to self-eliminate if they rolled a six. While most of the competitors managed to roll any number other than a six, a staggering three Squid Game: The Challenge contestants rolled a six and were forced to leave the competition: Purna (031), Bee (018), and Mai&#39;s closest alliance, Chad. While her targeting of Ashley was somewhat justified, Chad&#39;s elimination could be viewed as karma. Given only a one-in-six chance of rolling a six, it&#39;s wild that three out of twelve remaining competitors actually rolled the prophetic number.





 5  The Players Chose Teamwork In The Glass Bridge And Dice Game 


 







Aside from Ashley and Mai, the competitors all chose teamwork in the dice game and Glass Bridge. Ashley was shown vehemently disagreeing with every player, taking a 50/50 chance at picking the correct tile, a foolish choice considering that at #5, she almost certainly would have been eliminated without this strategy. Instead, she allowed Trey to take multiple moves and ultimately pick incorrectly, as probability would suggest.
Additionally, rather than eliminate a competitor and make enemies going into the finale, nearly every competitor in the top 12 chose to self-eliminate if they rolled a six in the dice game, leading to the demise of three players. At the later stages of the competition, it&#39;s shocking that players still choose teamwork over cutthroat tactics.





 4  Mai Stabbed Roland In The Back 


 







Mai consistently showed over episodes 6-9 that she is a force to be reckoned with and is ready to win at all costs. Despite her friendship with Roland (418), Mai goes in for the kill during the circle of trust game. Knowing Roland would never suspect her, she gives him the gift box, effectively sealing his fate unless he correctly guessed the present giver. Sure enough, Roland is sent home. Interestingly, when they returned to the dormitory, Mai could not admit this to Sam and Phill.





 3  Phill Survived Circle Of Trust Twice 
        

Probability was not on the competitors&#39; side when it came to guessing correctly in the circle of trust game. Despite this, Phill could correctly guess who gave him the gift twice during the game. Whether it was a stroke of luck or an uncanny ability to read body language, Phill earned his spot in the top 3. Most players weren&#39;t able to guess who targeted them, and Mai and Phill were able to save themselves during this challenge.





 2  Sam Lied Low And Made It To The Top 3 
        

Sam was rarely seen in the first few episodes, staying in the background and laying low with loosely formed friendships and alliances. Known chiefly for his epic beard, the artist received a better introduction in later episodes. After cutting himself off from homophobic family members, the entrepreneur and artist lives a much freer and happier life in Florida. On the show, Sam combined luck and skill with staying out of the spotlight to cruise into the top 3 Squid Game: The Challenge players.





 1  Mai Maintained Her Hero Status Despite Making Villainous Decisions 
        

Ashley is being crucified online for her villain status, but Mai has been cool and calculating for episodes. Despite her attitude toward TJ and later Ashley, she managed to maintain a hero status and is easy to root for. When TJ saves her twice, once during the test of allegiance and the other leading up to Glass Bridge, she changes her tune about the basketball player. However, Ashley came out as the villain in their rivalry regarding her teamwork. Additionally, she had no problem eliminating Roland. Her cutthroat abilities may make her the most worthy winner of Squid Game: The Challenge, but the outcome of the highly anticipated finale remains to be seen.
The Squid Game: The Challenge finale airs on Netflix on Wednesday, December 6, 2023.
