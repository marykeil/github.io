## SUMMARY 



  The Mandalorian season 3 is the most-watched streaming original in 2023 for U.S. viewers, surpassing Ted Lasso and The Witcher.   Star Wars is Disney&#43;&#39;s top hit in terms of original content, with only one Marvel show making it to the top five.   There&#39;s a surprising gap before Ahsoka, highlighting a potential lack of pop culture impact for other sub-franchises within Star Wars.

## Literature Review
Whip Media officially reveal the top streaming originals of 2023 - and it&#39;s very good news for Star Wars and The Mandalorian season 3..!




The Mandalorian season 3 has officially been ranked the most-watched streaming original of 2023 for U.S. viewers, beating competition from the likes of Ted Lasso and The Witcher. It&#39;s something of a truism that any streaming service is only as good as the range of original content; this is especially true at this stage in the streaming wars, as various apps compete to gain and keep subscribers. Unfortunately, streaming services are notoriously reluctant to give an idea how things have actually performed. The best indications usually come from third-party analytics companies.




One such firm, Whip Media, has confirmed the top U.S. streaming originals of 2023 (via The Wrap).

          

According to Whip Media, the top 10 streaming originals are:

 Rank  Title  Streaming Service   1  The Mandalorian  Disney&#43;   2  Loki  Disney&#43;   3  Ted Lasso  Apple TV&#43;   4  You  Netflix   5  Only Murders in the Building  Hulu   6  Black Mirror  Netflix   7  Secret Invasion  Disney&#43;   8  The Bear  Hulu   9  Ahsoka  Disney&#43;   10  The Witcher  Netflix   






The stats underscore the fact Star Wars is Disney&#43;&#39;s biggest hit in terms of originals, with only one of 2023&#39;s MCU TV shows making it to the top five. Netflix, meanwhile, will be disappointed to see The Witcher ranked so low; back in 2019, when the franchise launched, there had been hopes it would be Netflix&#39;s next Stranger Things.


 The Mandalorian Is Star Wars&#39; Biggest Hit - Which Could Cause Problems For 2024 
          

The Mandalorian has always been the biggest Disney&#43; TV show, with season 1 releasing alongside the streaming service&#39;s launch (ironically, The Mandalorian season 1 competed with The Witcher as well, with data suggesting it triumphed back in 2019 too). Lucasfilm will be more concerned by the gap between The Mandalorian season 3 and Ahsoka, however, which suggests other Star Wars TV shows still lack the same degree of pop culture impact. 2024 is a year without Din Djarin, meaning Disney&#43; will be dependent on two new Star Wars TV shows - The Acolyte and Skeleton Crew.




                  All Star Wars Movies &amp; TV Shows In 2024   After a jam-packed year of Star Wars in 2023, viewers can expect a wide array of new content in 2024, especially with TV shows on Disney&#43;.    

It will be interesting to see whether The Mandalorian season 3 has had any impact on that particular brand. Still, hopefully smart marketing for The Mandalorian season 4 (generally expected to come out in 2025) will resolve any issues. For now, Lucasfilm will be satisfied that Din Djarin is still a winner.
