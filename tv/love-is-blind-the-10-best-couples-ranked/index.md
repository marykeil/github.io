## Literature Review
Through five seasons, Love is Blind has spawned numerous proposals and even marriages. However, some of the best couples might surprise you.




Love is Blind might have seen success after its first season, but with only two lasting marriages coming from the show after the first two seasons and two more marriages out of five couples in season three, there was skepticism about whether there could be long-lasting couples. However, Love Is Blind season 4 saw three lasting marriages, but season 5 produced only one couple: Lydia Velez Gonzalez and Milton Johnson. With Love Is Blind season 6 yet to come, it&#39;s unclear if the hit Netflix reality TV series can increase its success rate, but there are still some good couples to go out of the show.
The “best” couples from the show aren’t necessarily those who officially got together after the pods, nor are they all together. However, each was featured on a season and had fans invested, albeit for different reasons. While Love Is Blind season 5 failed its contestants for many reasons, there have also been good outcomes from the hit reality TV series, or worthwhile journeys to explore.









 








 13  Deepti Vempati And Kyle Abrams 
Love Is Blind Season 2
        

Deepti and Kyle didn’t get together on the show, and while they did date for a short period afterward, they broke up. However, the pair together was like two peas in a pod. They had developed a connection in the pods, but Deepti pursued a relationship with Shake instead, while Kyle went with Shaina. After the fact, they both realized they should have partnered with one another. Even though they tried a romantic relationship that didn’t work out, they were easy to root for in the real world.





 12  Micah Lussier And Paul Peden 
Love Is Blind Season 4
        

While an unpopular opinion, Micah and Paul seemed well-suited mainly to each other during Love Is Blind season 4. They were very in love and got along well. Famously, Micah was a spitting image both in personality and looks of Paul&#39;s mother. However, Paul couldn&#39;t picture Micah as a maternal figure to future children, and Micah wanted the freedom to live between the Pacific Northwest and Arizona. While Paul moved on, there were still feelings between the two on After The Altar.





 11  Lydia Velez Gonzalez And Milton Johnson 
Love Is Blind Season 5
        

As the only couple left standing at the end of Love Is Blind season 5, Lydia and Milton had big shoes to fill. While Stacy Snyder and Izzy Zapata were obviously incompatible, Lydia and Milton were unclear. The pair fought regularly about their emotional versus logical approaches in life but seemed eager to put in the work to make their marriage a reality. After the reunion, Milton took a new position, meaning the pair is long-distance. As the most recently married couple, only time will tell if Lydia and Milton&#39;s marriage is viable.





 10  Colleen Reed And Matt Bolton (Season 3) 
        

Colleen and Matt had one of the most tumultuous relationships of season 3, but they&#39;re still together today. While they were initially head over heels for one another immediately after meeting and getting engaged, acting as though they had been dating for years, things took a turn. Matt’s temper and insecurities started emerging, and events and conversations almost broke them. It was unclear how the story would end, but the pair took the plunge into marriage, and they&#39;re still together, having bought their first house recently.





 9  Chelsea Griffin Appiah And Kwame Appiah 
Love Is Blind Season 4
        

Kwame and Chelsea had a bumpy road on Love Is Blind season 4. With certainty, Chelsea would say yes at the altar, but there was a lack of clarity for Kwame. In a surprising twist, Kwame agrees to marry Chelsea despite wanting to stay in his apartment and experience more adventure before settling down. The pair showcase their marriage regularly on social media and remain good friends with Brett &amp; Tiffany and Bliss &amp; Zack. They weren&#39;t the favorite couple from season 4, but they seem well-suited to each other.





 8  Amber And Matt Barnett 
Love Is Blind Season 1
        

Amber and Matt initially seemed like they might end in disaster, but they&#39;ve been married for over five years. The relationship was tested right from the beginning when Jessica, the other woman Matt had a bond with in the pods, seemed to interfere. It’s one of the things Jessica from Love is Blind will never live down. That, combined with Amber’s significant debt, fans weren’t so sure. But years later, the couple remains stronger than ever. They are wild, fun, and outspoken but come across as being a perfect match for one another as both husband and wife and best friends. The pair have stayed out of the Love Is Blind spotlight since season 1.





 7  Alexa And Brennon Lemieux 
Love Is Blind Season 3
        

With the pair being one of two couples who officially said “yes” on season 3, Alexa and Brennon seemed to be a shoo-in to make it down the aisle. Even though they are opposite in some respects - Brennon grew up in a lower-to-middle-class family, and Alexa was raised surrounded by wealth – they complement one another well and connect first on a purely emotional level.
Brennon is quiet and reserved, and Alexa is loud and outspoken. However, even when she brought up the idea of a prenup, he quickly said he would be happy to sign. He also agreed to convert to Judaism for her. They both speak highly of the other when talking to castmates and seem poised to stay together for the long haul. While Brennon received backlash for sexual assault allegations, the two remain happily together today.





 6  Bliss Poureetezadi Goytowski And Zack Goytowski 
Love Is Blind Season 4


 












 5   
Bliss and Zack endured a bumpy road toward marriage in Love Is Blind, but the results were well worth it. While Zack initially chose Irina Solomonova in the pods, he reconnected with Bliss after a disastrous post-engagement trip to Mexico. Bliss was understandably reticent but decided to give Zack a second chance. The pair is perfect for each other, and they remain together despite Bliss&#39;s father&#39;s grievances. Bliss and Zack are expecting a baby, a first in Love Is Blind history. While their road to bliss was undoubtedly tricky, they&#39;re among the best couples to come out of the franchise.





 4   





 3   





 2  Tiffany Pennywell Brown And Brett Brown 
Love Is Blind Season 4


 







Brett and Tiffany are the couple closest to usurping Lauren and Cameron for Love Is Blind king and queen. The pair had the smoothest journey from the pods into the real world, with the only roadblock being Tiffany&#39;s sleepiness in the pods. Brett and Tiffany&#39;s chemistry is palpable onscreen, and they remain communicative about money, career, and family goals as they prepare to get married. The only drama on their wedding day was Brett&#39;s suit not meeting his standards, which a speedy tailor solved. Brett and Tiffany keep their marriage more private than the other Love Is Blind season 4 couples.





 1  Lauren Speed-Hamilton And Cameron Hamilton 
Love Is Blind Season 1


 







By far, the “best” couple from Love is Blind, Lauren and Cameron make up only two couples from the first two seasons that remain together. They met in the pods and instantly had an emotional connection, and when they met in person, their love only deepened. A seemingly perfect match, the pair have become social media personalities and the poster couple for the show, proving that the experiment can work. Every new single who has come on Love Is Blind since says they yearn to find what these two found.
