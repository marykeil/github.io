## Literature Review
Kirsten Schoemaker isn’t ruminating about the past. The 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cast member is glowing after her breakup with Julio Moya.




Kirsten Schoemaker from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way has her smile back after getting brutally dumped by Julio Moya. Kirsten featured in season 5 with the New York man to document their romantic journey. During the introduction segment, the couple revealed that they met via social media, spent a week together, and decided to take their relationship one step toward marriage. Julio promised Kirsten he would move to the Netherlands but first invited her to see his hometown and meet his family in New York. However, things didn’t play out as the two had planned.




Halfway through the season, Julio started having second thoughts about uprooting his life from America to the Netherlands. Eventually, he got scared of the big move and broke up with Kirsten unceremoniously. Julio used excuses such as responsibilities and family duties to make it look like he had no options. However, he was called out on social media for his charade. In December, during the Tell All, Kirsten and Julio accused each other of infidelity. Julio also confirmed he had found another woman and moved on from Kirsten.
