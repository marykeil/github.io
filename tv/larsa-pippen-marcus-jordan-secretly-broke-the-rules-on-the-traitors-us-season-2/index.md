## Literature Review
Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan are the first couple to compete on The Traitors US. Find out how they broke the rules while appearing on the show.




The Traitors US season 2 features the first-ever couple to appear on the American version of the show--Larsa Pippen and Marcus Jordan--and they now admit to breaking the rules during filming. Larsa, an original cast member from The Real Housewives of Miami, is the ex-wife of NBA legend Scottie Pippen. Marcus is the son of NBA icon Michael Jordan and is a former college basketball player himself. Larsa and Marcus have been in a relationship since 2022.




In an interview with People, Larsa and Marcus confessed to breaking the rules while they filmed The Traitors US season 2. After they finished filming at the castle each day, they stayed the night in separate rooms, where they couldn&#39;t communicate with each other. However, Larsa admitted that she found a way to get messages to Marcus. She explained, &#34;Marcus asked me for a nail file, and I put it in a paper bag—and they go through everything, you&#39;re not supposed to send anything back and forth.&#34; Larsa continued, &#34;He said he wanted a banana. So I [write], &#39;I love you,&#39; on the banana and send it to him with the nail file.&#34; Marcus added, &#34;That was cute.&#34;

 Larsa &amp; Marcus Reveal If They Had Alliance On The Traitors US 
          




Although Larsa and Marcus went into The Traitors US season 2 as a couple, Larsa revealed, &#34;We had to have this conversation, and we&#39;re basically like, &#39;Hey, once we get to the castle, I&#39;m Larsa, and you&#39;re Marcus, and we&#39;re not necessarily a duo anymore. You&#39;re on your own. I&#39;m on my own.&#34; Marcus said &#34;there&#39;s no hard feelings&#34; if one of them ended up being a traitor and the other was faithful. However, he added, &#34;But I definitely feel like if I get stabbed in the back by Larsa, it&#39;ll sting a little bit.&#34;


 

Although Larsa and Marcus broke The Traitors US rules when Larsa sent a message to him, it was harmless. She wanted to send him some love, which was very sweet. It must have been very hard for them to navigate the game, not knowing if the other was a traitor. Obviously, it would hurt if one of them had to betray the other, but, ultimately, it&#39;s a game, and it seems that they both understood and accepted that. While it might be difficult for them if they were on opposite sides of the game, it would also give them an emotional advantage to have someone they love from home there to help them when things got tough.




Larsa and Marcus will have some fierce competition in The Traitors US season 2, with 19 other contestants fighting them for the $250,000 grand prize. They include Janelle Pierzina, Dan Gheesling, Parvati Shallow, Sandra Diaz-Twine, Chris &#34;C.T.&#34; Tamburello, Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio, and Trishelle Cannatella. Also competing are Phaedra Parks, Shereé Whitfield, Tamra Judge, Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, Kevin Kreider, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Mercedes &#34;MJ&#34; Javid, Peppermint, Peter Weber, Deontay Wilder, and John Bercow. It&#39;s fantastic that Larsa and Marcus had each other for support during The Traitors US, and it&#39;ll be thrilling to see how things unfold for them both individually and as a couple throughout the season.

The Traitors US season 2 premieres Friday, January 12 on Peacock.
