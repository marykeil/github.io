## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Olivia Plath may be going through a tough divorce, but she&#39;s still having fun with her friends and shading Ethan Plath.




Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Olivia Plath may be dealing with her divorce from husband Ethan Plath, but she&#39;s taken some time out to throw a little shade at her ex with her friends. While Olivia and Ethan&#39;s relationship has been a focal point of Welcome To Plathville season 5, it hasn&#39;t been for the marriage&#39;s strength. After both Ethan and Olivia found themselves facing issues with the relationship, something needed to change for the couple. As the season has continued, it&#39;s been clear that Ethan and Olivia have struggled to connect on the issues in their marriage, and haven&#39;t been able to bridge some of the fundamental gaps they have.




Now that Olivia and Ethan have both announced they&#39;re divorcing, Olivia&#39;s been free to post whatever content she likes, including some snaps of her newly independent self. In the comments of a recent post, which Olivia captioned, &#34;long story short ... keep going. it gets better, i promise. ðŸ’›&#34; some of her friends were in the comments section, making jokes and throwing shade at Ethan.


 

One of Olivia&#39;s friends, @haleigh.claree, commented, &#34;get back in the kitchen and make me a sandwich eye roll ðŸ™„ &#34; to which Olivia replied, &#34;you have to marry me first, then i won&#39;t have the option to say no.&#34; The shade about Ethan, who&#39;s been vocal about the role of a wife in marriage being subservient to her husband, was more than clear.





 Olivia &amp; Ethan Plathâ€™s Welcome To Plathville Relationship Explained 
                                                     

Ethan and Olivia&#39;s relationship has been a tough one to watch unfold over the course of Welcome To Plathville. Getting married at only 18 years old, the couple had been together for 2 years prior to their wedding. While their relationship seemed strong, it was consistently changing in nature, just like Ethan and Olivia. Many people marry at such a young age, but it can be difficult to navigate before you hit your 20s. People are always maturing, so the fact that Olivia and Ethan felt confident enough in their connection to get married was both an assurance in their relationship and, ultimately, a detriment to it as well.


 




Throughout Welcome To Plathville season 5, it has been shown that both Ethan and Olivia have changed since they initially got married. The series focuses on the fact that Olivia has changed, becoming more independent and aware that she doesn&#39;t want to live the same way she was raised. Ethan has changed as well. Though he&#39;s always been firm in his religious beliefs, Ethan&#39;s attachment to his views has been tough for Olivia to come by. While the couple could&#39;ve been growing and changing together, it appears that they&#39;ve gone in entirely separate directions, leaving Olivia to pick up the pieces of her life and make jokes where she&#39;s able.

With Olivia&#39;s friends feeling comfortable enough to make jokes on Ethan&#39;s behalf in Olivia&#39;s comments, it&#39;s clear she&#39;s doing her best to find humor in a tough situation. With Welcome To Plathville season 5 still airing, it&#39;s likely that viewers will get to see just how bad the couple&#39;s marriage gets before its broken. Olivia is coping with her very public divorce as best she can, and using humor to try and reflect is likely an asset for the Welcome To Plathville star.
