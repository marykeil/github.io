Summary
 Chandler&#39;s new role as District Attorney is compromised by Bosch&#39;s actions, putting her career at risk.

With a giant season 2 cliffhanger ending that puts its titular character in hot water, Bosch: Legacy season 3 has already spawned some pretty big theories. A sequel to the Amazon Prime Video series Bosch (2014–2021), Bosch: Legacy was a selling point for the company&#39;s Freevee platform when it launched in earnest in 2022. Both series center on author Michael Connelly&#39;s titular Los Angeles Police Department detective, who has starred in over 20 best-selling police procedural novels. However, Legacy changes the formula: Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver) retires from the force in Bosch: Legacy season 1. Now a private investigator, Bosch isn&#39;t too worried about bending the rules when necessary.
The first two seasons of Bosch: Legacy see the fan-favorite PI joining forces with renowned defense attorney Honey &#34;Money&#34; Chandler (Mimi Rogers). In the show&#39;s sophomore outing, things turn much more personal when Bosch&#39;s daughter, LAPD rookie cop Maddie (Madison Lintz), is abducted by a serial rapist and murderer who turns out to be Kurt Dockweiler (Will Chase), a long-standing city inspector. While Bosch rescues Maddie from being buried alive, Dockweiler&#39;s trial doesn&#39;t go as expected. Ahead of Bosch: Legacy season 3, Dockweiler is murdered in prison; shortly after, Maddie picks up a call on her father&#39;s phone that suggests Harry orchestrated Dockweiler&#39;s demise.









 








 10  Chandler Becomes DA Of Los Angeles 
        

At the center of several life-threatening and (potentially) career-destroying events in season 2, Honey &#34;Money&#34; Chandler escaped relatively unscathed, thanks in large part to her life-long experience as an accomplished attorney. By the sophomore season&#39;s end, Chandler resolves to run for District Attorney. The somewhat-abrupt decision is made all-the-more believable when it becomes clear that LA&#39;s current DA, Emmett Archer, is more than willing to cover up police corruption. There&#39;s no doubt that Chandler will leverage this insight, and, given the character&#39;s arc, it makes perfect sense for her to move into a new, more high-powered position in Bosch: Legacy season 3.





 9  The Feds Aren&#39;t Finished With Mo 
        

In Bosch: Legacy season 2, Maurice &#34;Mo&#34; Bassi (Stephen Chang) had a budding would-be romance with fellow hacker, Jade Quinn (Jessica Camacho). Unfortunately, Legacy revealed that Jade, a.k.a. Janice Morrell, was actually an FBI agent who was using Mo. After Morrell uses the pharma case to incriminate Mo, her fellow feds apply pressure to Bosch&#39;s associate in the hopes of getting him to reveal crucial intel into Harry and Chandler&#39;s dealings. Later, Mo threatens to expose Morrell&#39;s identity to the hacker community, which could spell huge trouble for Janice and her fed colleagues. Needless to say, Mo&#39;s encounter with federal law enforcement is probably far from over.





 8  Irvin Irving&#39;s Story Officially Ends After The Late Lance Reddick&#39;s Cameo 
        

Much to fans&#39; excitement, a key Bosch character made a cameo in Bosch: Legacy season 2: Lance Reddick&#39;s Irvin Irving. The former Deputy Chief of the LAPD, Irving is a city councilman in La La Land when he turns up in Legacy. Eager to turn her ambition into action, Chandler meets with Irving to ask for his endorsement ahead of her DA campaign. Sadly, Reddick passed away in 2023, and it doesn&#39;t seem likely that the show will recast the character. That said, if the series was planning for Irving&#39;s return, Bosch: Legacy may have to find a way to tie up Irvin Irving&#39;s story for good.

 7  Chandler&#39;s New Role Is Compromised By Bosch 
        

In season 2, Honey Chandler put her career (and life) on the line several times, especially when she caught the attention of corrupt cops, Ellis and Long, while trying to clear her own client&#39;s name in a murder trial. Of course, that wasn&#39;t the only drama thrown Chandler&#39;s way: the defense attorney became the subject of the FBI&#39;s latest spy efforts. While she was able to evade their slings and arrows, especially with regard to the Carl Rogers case, Chandler isn&#39;t out of the woods yet. All that time spent with vendetta-fueled criminals, crooked cops, and the not-so-innocent Bosch could threaten her new DA role.





 6  A Fed Up Mo Finally Betrays Bosch &amp; Chandler 
        

Being intimidated by the feds and lulled into a faux-romance with an FBI agent has a real effect on a person, so it&#39;s likely that season 3&#39;s Mo will be feeling more than fed up with Bosch and Chandler. The show has yet to reveal if Bosch&#39;s jazz-loving tech expert sang like a bird to the feds. Regardless, Mo isn&#39;t in the clear quite yet. Not only that, but Janice Morrell seemed legitimately remorseful, which begs the question: Will Mo turn on his friends for love — or turn on them to avoid the FBI&#39;s wrath? Either way, Mo betraying Harry would make for an enticing twist.





 5  Maddie &amp; Harry Bosch Become Estranged 


 







There&#39;s no denying that Bosch: Legacy season 2&#39;s ending tease sets up a much darker season 3 of the show, especially where Maddie and Harry&#39;s relationship is concerned. After Maddie&#39;s kidnapper, Dockweiler, is killed in prison shortly after his sentencing, Maddie answers her father&#39;s phone to hear the voice of inmate Preston Borders (Chris Browning). Borders says he has, &#34;taken care of it,&#34; implying that he saw to Dockweiler&#39;s in-prison death. The larger implication, of course, is that Bosch arranged Dockweiler&#39;s death via Borders. Even Maddie seems pretty convinced that her father would put Dockweiler&#39;s murder into motion, making a strained father-daughter relationship very likely in season 3.





 4  A Retired Bosch Finally Faces Consequences 


 







Dockweiler&#39;s suspicious murder aside, Harry Bosch and Honey Chandler have been playing fast and loose with the rules for quite some time. Now that Bosch is very much retired from the force, it&#39;s hard to imagine a civilian — even a private investigator — getting away with some of his actions. Harry and Chandler narrowly avoided the feds in season 2, so it seems only fitting that Bosch: Legacy would take things a step further, especially if Mo harbors a grudge or Maddie feels the need to put the law above her father. All signs point to the clock finally running out for Bosch (and, maybe, Chandler).





 3  Preston Borders Is Setting Bosch Up 
        

Browning&#39;s Preston Borders is a rapist and murderer who was arrested by Harry Bosch back in the late 1980s. Although he was tried for several murders, Borders was only convicted of one. A recurring character in Bosch season 5, he&#39;s involved in a scheme to be released from prison (along with a settlement), but his plans fall through. That said, Preston Borders is still very much incarcerated. It&#39;s hard to imagine him working with Bosch, the man who brought him to justice, so Borders framing Bosch as the one who orchestrated Dockweiler&#39;s behind-bars murder makes tons of sense.





 2  Bosch Did Arrange Dockweiler&#39;s Death 
        

On the other hand, there&#39;s also the very real possibility that Harry Bosch did orchestrate Dockweiler&#39;s murder. Often in conflict with authority, Bosch prizes justice and doing the right thing. Of course, when Maddie ends up being Dockweiler&#39;s target in season 2, a new side of Bosch, the protective father, comes into clearer focus. No longer with the force, Harry Bosch does what he can to help, but, at this juncture, taking matters into his own hands might mean stepping fully outside the law. Clearly, Maddie doesn&#39;t think her father&#39;s involvement is out of the question.

 1  Mickey Haller Cameos In Bosch Season 3 
        

Michael Connelly&#39;s other most well-known book protagonist is Mickey Haller, a.k.a. the titular Lincoln Lawyer. In Connelly&#39;s novels, both Bosch and Haller are based in Los Angeles, and cross paths often. Fans of the characters have been clamoring for a crossover cameo, but there&#39;s one crucial obstacle thwarting this potential: Bosch: Legacy airs on Amazon Prime Video, while The Lincoln Lawyer is a Netflix show. Given Netflix&#39;s recent penchant for hosting other network&#39;s content, maybe the streamers will finally find a way to bring Haller and Bosch together on screen.
