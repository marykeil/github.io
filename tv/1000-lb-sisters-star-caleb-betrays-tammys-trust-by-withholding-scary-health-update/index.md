Caleb tells his wife that his CO2 levels had gone back up and the doctors suspected he had pneumonia. Tammy says Caleb didn’t tell her he was in the hospital, even though they had been texting. “I mean, it’s understandable with trachs, they’re very finicky,” she says, before adding, “You look at them wrong and you get a fricking bacterial infection.” Tammy understands that if the infection gets bad, one can be sent to the hospital. Tammy can’t believe that Caleb didn’t tell her he was sent to the hospital. Caleb claims he didn’t want to worry Tammy. He wants to “take care of some business” and get his health together.

She feels like a new person and wants to live and to travel. She tells the cameras that she and Caleb had been talking about having children.
