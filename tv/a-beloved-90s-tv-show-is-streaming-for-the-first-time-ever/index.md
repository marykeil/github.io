## Literature Review
A beloved 1990s TV show gets quietly uploaded to a streaming service for the first time ever, following many years of being stuck in limbo.




A beloved 1990s show, Northern Exposure, is streaming for the first time ever. Co-created by Joshua Brand and John Falsey, who also created shows like St. Elsewhere and I’ll Fly Away, the dramedy ran for six seasons and 110 episodes. It focused on a New York City physician as he moved to a small Alaskan town. Although it has been made available on DVD and Blu-ray, Northern Exposure hasn’t streamed anywhere because of rights issues.




That&#39;s now changed, with TVLine reporting that Prime Video quietly uploaded all six seasons of Northern Exposure. The episodes are available in high definition and retain their original 4:3 aspect ratio. But it&#39;s unclear if Prime Video has cleared the original music rights.


 What To Know About Northern Exposure 
          

The series followed Rob Morrow as Joel Fleischman. As a recently graduated New York City physician, Fleischman is sent to practice medicine in the fictional town of Alaska. The show initially focused on Fleischman&#39;s experiences acclimating to Alaska. However, as the show went on, it became more focused on the ensemble and the citizens of Alaska.

Along with Morrow, who is also known for playing Don Eppes on Numb3rs, the cast also included Barry Corbin, Janine Turner, John Cullum, Cynthia Geary, Darren E. Burrows, Peg Phillips, Elaine Miles, and John Corbett. Morrow exited the show at the end of season 5 and was replaced by Paul Provenza, who played Dr. Phil Capra. Teri Polo also joined the show as Capra&#39;s wife, Michelle.




                  8 Dated 1990s TV Shows That Deserve Reboots   The 1990s were a time of bad special effects and problematic jokes, but they still had some great, original ideas that could work in reboots.    

Northern Exposure was an awards juggernaut, garnering 57 nominations during its five-year run. It won 27, including the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series in 1992. Though there has been talk of reviving Northern Exposure, nothing has materialized on the front despite some efforts in 2018. But with this news, audiences can now stream one of the standout dramedies of the 1990s.
