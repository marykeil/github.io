## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé stars Manuel and Ashley might have gotten married, but there are signs their relationship was on the rocks from the beginning.




90 Day Fiancé season 10 stars Ashley Michelle and Manuel Vëlez might be married, but there are already signs their relationship won&#39;t last. The couple met in 2010 on New Year&#39;s Eve when Ashley, originally from Rochester, New York, was a student in Ecuador. Ashley and Manuel got engaged and tried a long-distance relationship after Ashley went back to the U.S. before splitting.
Ashley and Manuel reconnected and got married more than seven years later, a week after Ashley got out of her long-term relationship, and their love story has been unfolding since the premiere of 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Their journey has been an emotional rollercoaster full of cultural clashes, tension, joy, and a 90-day deadline, making many 90 Day Fiancé viewers wonder if their relationship will stand the test of time. There are already too many major red flags in Ashley and Manuel&#39;s marriage, an indication it might not last.
            
 
 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now 
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?












 








 8  Manuel Is Secretive 
He Is Reluctant To Share His Personal Life
        

Although Ashley and Manuel&#39;s story began like a modern-day fairytale, it didn&#39;t take too long before cracks started to show. Manuel kept his U.S. move a secret from his family and didn&#39;t tell them about Ashley and his plans to marry her. Manuel told his mom he was traveling to another part of Ecuador for work and never mentioned Ashley in the story, which is a big red flag.





 7  Manuel Expects Ashley To Financially Support His Family 
He Is Entitled To Ashley&#39;s Money


Manuel has, on more than one occasion, dictated how Ashley should spend her money, gaslighted her, and tried to make crazy demands. Once, he was mad that Ashley took her dog to the vet instead of sending the money to his family. In another instance, the couple had a disastrous therapy session. Manuel and Ashley argued at a coffee shop after he said Ashley spent most of her money on coffee.
The reality TV couple was hanging out with friends who asked Ashley how she felt about sending money to Manuel&#39;s family after he said he expected her to send $300 each month to them. Things got so bad that Manuel started yelling at Ashley, asking why she spent so much on her pets instead of sending them to his family before storming off. Their issues are deeper than the coffee situation, and Manuel has shown many times how much he values Ashley&#39;s money.





 6  He Is The Male Version Of Anfisa 
Manuel Is There For The Visa


 







Anfisa Arkhipcenko and Jorge Nava from 90 Day Fiancé season 4 had one of the most blatant transactional relationships ever in the 90 Day Fiancé universe. Like Anfisa, who was upfront that she wanted to be taken care of, Manuel has shown that he wants the same from Ashley. Over time, he has accused her of spending her money to buy personal items and failing to send money to his family back in Ecuador.
Ashley has also indicated that she felt Manuel might be with her for a Green Card. &#34;I am not saying this man is here for the visa. I truly believe he loves me, but I also believe that if things don&#39;t work out and if we don&#39;t get married, he has no intention of going back to Ecuador,&#34; said Ashley in a recent episode. Once Manuel gets what he wants, the couple might break up, just like Anfisa and Jorge.





 5  Ashley Is Spiritual But Cannot See Through Manuel’s Issues 
Ashley Is Blinded By Love


 







Ashley is a witch by profession and has centered her business around spirituality. In one episode, Ashley wanted to change the energy in the room by lighting the candles after the coffee shop argument. She gave Manuel a Celestine stone, which didn&#39;t seem to light up their room and improve their energy since Manuel thought they were mourning someone. It seemed her spirit guides weren&#39;t showing her that Manuel wasn&#39;t the one, making her look desperate and in love with the idea of marriage, thus willing to do so with the wrong person.





 4  Manuel Occasionally Runs Away From Arguments 
Communication Is A Problem In Ashley&#39;s And Manuel&#39;s Marriage


While at the coffee shop with friends, Manuel and Ashley argued about finances. Instead of solving their problems through a conversation, Ashley and Manuel &#34;banged it out,&#34; something Ashley admitted happened too often after a disagreement. Manuel ran away from his family as he never told them he left the country for the U.S. Maybe he has never dealt with arguments face-to-face, making it hard to do so in this relationship.





 3  Manuel And Ashley Speak The Same Language (Spanish) But A Different One In Their Relationship 
Manuel Isn&#39;t Putting The Effort In The Relationship
        

Ashley speaks Manuel&#39;s native language, Spanish, fluently, which makes communication between them easy. Ashley has had to explain to Manuel why her dog slept in her bed and why supermarkets in the U.S. sold non-meaty items that looked exactly like meat. Ashley has had an easy time explaining to her partner the different cultural experiences, something that would have been difficult to talk about if there was a language barrier.
Without knowing Spanish, Ashley and Manuel would have been like other 90 Day Fiancé couples who relied on translation apps. Moreover, Ashley learned a different dancing style to please Manuel once she realized he enjoyed seeing her dancing for him. On the other hand, Manuel has just been asking for money from Ashley, complaining, and doing the bare minimum to keep their relationship going.





 2  Ashley Is Overbearing 
Ashley Is Too Confident With Her Relationship Status
        

Ashley met with her friend to practice a dance her sister Sienna choreographed for the wedding. After the session, the trio hung out in the studio to listen to Ashley&#39;s woes. She discussed the coffee shop incident and their makeup session in the bathroom. Ashley&#39;s sister and her friend were concerned about how the two handled their issues, but Ashley stated Manuel has supported her more than any other partner she&#39;s had. It shows that Ashley has been in some pretty bad relationships before Manuel, and that&#39;s why she&#39;s still hanging onto his potential instead of seeing him for who he is.
&#34;He is a responsible human being. He is incredibly loving. He gives me more love and attention and affection than a partner ever has before, and so, for me, that&#39;s enough to walk down that aisle, and then we&#39;ll figure it out as we go.&#34;







 1  Ashley And Manuel’s Storyline Is The Most Boring In The Season 
Another Couple Should Have Been On The Show


Ashley is an interesting character, something she portrayed from the start. The reality star&#39;s introduction included her passion for astrology and dancing, her pets, her poetry skills, and her specialty in shadow work. On the other hand, Manuel didn&#39;t present an interesting story. He admitted that he didn&#39;t tell his family about his move to the U.S. and his suggestion that Ashley&#39;s dog and cat slept outside, rubbing the 90 Day Fiancé viewers the wrong way.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
