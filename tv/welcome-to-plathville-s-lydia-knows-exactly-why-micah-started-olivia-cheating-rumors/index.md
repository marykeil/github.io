## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Olivia Plath is being defended by her sister, Lydia Meggs, over the cheating allegations Micah Plath lodged against her.




Welcome To Plathville’s Lydia Meggs, sister of Olivia Plath, has spoken out about her sister’s divorce from Ethan Plath and is shutting down rumors about Olivia cheating. While Olivia and Ethan’s marriage had huge issues spanning their five years together, it was shocking to hear that there were cheating allegations on either side of the partnership. After getting married at just 20 years old in 2018, Ethan and Olivia’s lives changed entirely as they did their best to grow together as a couple. While Ethan has been stuck in his ways for the majority of his life, Olivia began to change as a person, causing a rift between the couple.




During an appearance on The Sarah Fraser Show podcast, Lydia spoke out about the allegations of cheating that were pushed by Micah Plath during his recent Watch What Happens Live appearance. Lydia stated firmly, “I can tell you for a fact that Olivia didn’t cheat on Ethan,” before explaining, “As far as if there was cheating in the marriage, you would have to ask her, but she did not cheat on Ethan.” Lydia shared that while there have been rumors surrounding the couple, she can confirm they’re false. While fans are waiting to hear from Olivia, Lydia’s confirmation was a relief.

While Lydia’s confirmation that Olivia didn’t cheat on Ethan is helpful, it completely goes against what Ethan’s brother Micah shared on Watch What Happens Live, turning everything into a case of he-said, she-said. During Micah’s appearance, he shared that while there were rumors about Ethan cheating, fans should discuss the opposite, implying Olivia had cheated. During her podcast appearance, Lydia explained that Micah likely spoke out of “anger,” sharing that he probably was saying “things in the heat of the moment” after feeling “misheard, misunderstood or just stepped all over.” The Plath family, including Micah, has a long history of feeling misheard and misunderstood when it comes to Olivia.





 

While Micah may have been speaking out of anger, he was still likely falsifying the events to fit a narrative that would benefit his brother more than Olivia. Micah and the rest of the Plath family’s longstanding issues with Olivia have been explored throughout Welcome To Plathville season 5 as Ethan has been sharing the problems in his marriage with his family. While Olivia was looking to grow and change within the Plath family, Ethan’s siblings and parents didn’t like how she spoke to Ethan or treated their family. Things changed for them as they tried to push Olivia out of the picture by any means necessary.

Despite the fact that it’s still not confirmed whether Ethan or Olivia cheated in their marriage, both of their siblings choosing to get in on the action to defend their respective sides is an interesting layer to the feud between Olivia and the Plath family. Ethan and Olivia’s marriage, which has been crumbling further in each episode of Welcome To Plathville season 5, has sadly met an end, and while both of them have been quiet, their families are sticking up for them. With Lydia adding her account of Ethan and Olivia’s marriage into the mix, it’s clear that there are several sides to the story that fans have yet to hear.

Welcome To Plathville airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
