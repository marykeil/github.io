 1923 Season 2 Delays Explained 
        

Paramount&#39;s Western spinoff debuted in late 2022, airing eight episodes from December 2022 to late February 2023. As the show concluded, 1923 was renewed for season 2. This marked the first Yellowstone spinoff to get renewed aside from the principal show, considering another in-universe show,1888, was a miniseries with ten episodes. 1923 was met with critical acclaim, recently earning Golden Globe nominations for Best Television Series, Drama, and Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Series, Drama for Mirren.
            
 
 1923 Ending Explained (In Detail) 
The Paramount Plus exclusive Yellowstone spinoff 1923 concluded its first season with a bang, but the ending left a lot of questions to be answered.




Despite being renewed a while ago, the prequel show has no confirmed release date for season 2. The lack of updates for the sophomore season is because 1923 was delayed indefinitely due to the WGA strike that shook the industry in 2023, followed by the SAG-AFTRA strike. Because of this uncertainty, news of its development has been incredibly slow over the months. However, some of the setbacks did include losing its primary location, which was Butte Civic Center in Butte, Montana.
With developments relatively sparse, the latest update on 1923â€™s progress is promising and a huge relief for the Yellowstone universe. Although Sklenar didn&#39;t provide specific details, it is a reassurance that the Yellowstone prequel will return to production relatively soon. This could put season 2&#39;s premiere window between the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025. Time will tell as 1923hopefully follows through on beginning filming swiftly.
