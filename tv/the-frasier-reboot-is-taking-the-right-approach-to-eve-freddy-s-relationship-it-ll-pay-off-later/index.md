# The Frasier Reboot Is Taking The Right Approach To Eve &amp; Freddy s Relationship (&amp; It ll Pay Off Later)


## SUMMARY 



  The Frasier reboot is taking a slow approach with Eve and Freddy&#39;s relationship, allowing the actors to build on-screen chemistry and develop their dynamic further.   Sitcom fans love the will they/won&#39;t they dynamic, and having Eve and Freddy in a similar situation will keep audiences invested in the show.   If the producers wait a few seasons to bring Eve and Freddy together, it will be more satisfying in the long run, but they shouldn&#39;t take too long or viewers will lose interest. Finding the right balance is crucial.

## Literature Review
The producers of the Frasier reboot are taking the right approach when it comes to developing Eve and Freddy&#39;s relationship in future seasons.




The producers of the Frasier reboot series are taking the right approach when it comes to developing Eve and Freddy’s relationship for future seasons of the show. At the beginning of the new series, Dr. Crane returns to Boston and finds that his son Freddy has a live-in girlfriend, Eve, that he didn’t know about. However, it turns out that Eve isn’t Freddy’s girlfriend; she was the girlfriend of a colleague that Freddy lost in a fire, and Freddy moved in to help Eve raise her child.




But that doesn’t mean that the door is closed on an Eve/Freddy romance. The first season of the Frasier reboot seemed to build towards a possible romance between the two characters. In a recent interview, the executive producers of the Frasier reboot – Chris Harris and Joe Cristalli – were asked whether Eve and Freddy will become a couple in the show’s future. They didn’t confirm anything specific, but they did confirm the approach they’re taking towards this storyline, and it sounds like a smart move.

                  The Frasier Reboot&#39;s Freddy Story Makes Up For 1 Missing Character   Frasier&#39;s dynamic with his son Freddy in the new reboot is shaping up to replace a classic dynamic that made the original series so great.    


 The Frasier Reboot Is Right To Take Eve &amp; Freddy&#39;s Relationship Slowly 
          




Harris and Cristalli said that, while it is possible that Eve and Freddy’s friendship will eventually blossom into a romance, they’re taking it slow. This is probably the best course of action with these characters for a few reasons. By not rushing into a romantic storyline, the producers will give the actors, Jack Cutmore-Scott and Jess Salgueiro, time to build their on-screen chemistry. They have a comfortable dynamic now, but waiting to make their characters a couple will allow them to develop that dynamic further. Plus, it makes sense story-wise that neither of them are ready for a relationship, as they’re both grieving the loss of a loved one.

Sitcom fans love the will they/won’t they dynamic – it’s a staple of the genre. From Sam and Diane in Cheers to Ross and Rachel in Friends to Penny and Leonard in The Big Bang Theory, there are many iconic will they/won’t they couples from sitcom history that kept audiences invested in their respective shows for years. Giving the Frasier reboot a will they/won’t they dynamic in the form of Eve and Freddy will keep audiences invested the same way. It would also echo Niles and Daphne’s long-running romantic storyline from the original series.






 Eve &amp; Freddy Getting Together Will Be More Satisfying Later On 
          

If the Frasier reboot’s producers take their time developing Eve and Freddy’s relationship and don’t make them a couple until a few seasons down the line, then it’ll be more satisfying in the long run. Will they/won’t they sitcom couples usually have a better payoff when they drag it out a bit. Having said that, it’s important that the writers don’t overdo it. They should take their time to get Eve and Freddy together, but they shouldn’t take too long or viewers will eventually lose interest. It’s tricky to find the right balance.
