# Sam Worthington s Upcoming Western Movie Can Redeem His New 32% Rotten Tomatoes Netflix Thriller


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix&#39;s Lift received poor reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but Sam Worthington has another highly anticipated project in 2024 to redeem himself.   Lift&#39;s low Tomatometer and Audience Score indicate that the movie is considered bad by both critics and viewers.   Despite Lift&#39;s negative reception, Worthington has Horizon: An American Saga to look forward to, which has the potential to give him a positive Rotten Tomatoes score.

## Literature Review

Sam Worthington&#39;s most recent film was not received well by critics or audiences, but one of his upcoming projects can redeem the failure.




Unfortunately, Netflix&#39;s Lift, starring Sam Worthington, has performed rather poorly on Rotten Tomatoes. However, the actor shouldn&#39;t throw in the towel for 2024 just yet because he has a highly anticipated project premiering in the summer that could redeem the year for the actor. Worthington stars as Huxley in the 2024 comedy thriller film, which revolves around a team of thieves coming together to pull off a seemingly impossible heist — stealing $500 million (in the form of gold) from a locked vault on a plane while it is 40,000 feet in the air (hence the movie&#39;s title).




Aside from Worthington, the rest of the Lift cast includes Kevin Hart as Cyrus, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Abby, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio as Denton, Úrsula Corberó as Camila, Billy Magnussen as Magnus, Viveik Kalra as Luke, Jean Reno as Jorgenson, and Jacob Batalon as N8. Despite the cast containing a handful of well-known names, the Netflix film proved to be a dud (by Rotten Tomatoes&#39;s standards). As of the writing of this article, Lift&#39;s Tomatometer is at 32 percent, and it has a 33 percent Audience Score. The good news is that Worthington has another 2024 movie that can turn this year around for him.


 Sam Worthington&#39;s Next Movie After Lift Is Kevin Costner&#39;s Horizon: An American Saga 
          

Following the premiere of Lift on January 12, Sam Worthington&#39;s next scheduled project to be released in 2024 is Horizon: An American Saga — a two-part epic Western film directed, co-written (with Jon Baird), and produced by Kevin Costner, who also happens to star in it. Both parts of the movie will premiere on two separate dates in 2024, and two more films are currently in the works at Warner Bros. The epic tale will encapsulate 15 years in the American West before and after the Civil War and revolve around the expansion into the territory. Other than that, not much is known about the film&#39;s story.




The cast of Horizon: An American Saga includes Costner, Worthington, Sienna Miller, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jeff Fahey, Will Patton, Tatanka Means, Owen Crow Shoe, Ella Hunt, Jamie Campbell Bower, Giovanni Ribisi, Thomas Haden Church, and many more actors. The all-star cast contributes to the hype surrounding the movie, but the behind-the-scenes drama regarding Costner wanting to limit his time working on Yellowstone to focus on Horizon: An American Saga (leading to his exit from the Paramount series) has undoubtedly made many curious about what makes the upcoming Western so special.



 Why Lift&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Score Is So Low 
         

Lift&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer at 32 percent and its Audience Score at 33 percent is indicative of the movie&#39;s quality. In many instances, when a film&#39;s Tomatometer (the metric that averages critics&#39; reviews of the movie) is low, the Audience Score is much higher, as critics and viewers often differ in their opinions. However, when the two scores are on par with one another, it might mean that the project is just bad.




As for Lift, the negative reviews of the Netflix heist comedy claimed that the story was formulaic, hollow, convoluted, comparable to other heist films, and contained little to no character development. Based on the Audience Score, viewers seemingly agreed with the critics. Despite its poor reception, Lift made its way onto Netflix&#39;s Most Watched Movies list, so the streaming platform may not care about its Rotten Tomatoes score. On the other hand, the actors might be more concerned about the negative reviews, but they can look ahead to their upcoming projects to bounce back from the disappointment.

                  Why Netflix&#39;s Lift Feels So Much Like A Fast &amp; Furious Movie   Netflix&#39;s Lift seems too similar to the Fast and the Furious movies, making it hard not to wonder if there is a hidden connection between the two.   



 Horizon Can Give Sam Worthington His First Positive Rotten Tomatoes Score Since Avatar 2 
          




Despite Lift&#39;s negative reviews, Sam Worthington still has the first two parts of Kevin Costner&#39;s Horizon: An American Saga to look forward to in 2024. The movies already show a lot of promise, meaning that Worthington could receive his first positive Rotten Tomatoes score since Avatar: The Way of Water in 2022. Warner Bros. has so much faith in the project that four films have been greenlit despite not one being released. Of course, there is always the possibility that the movie will not live up to the hype, but at least it will allow Worthington to redeem himself following Lift&#39;s terrible showing.



Horizon: An American Saga: Chapter 1 is scheduled to premiere on June 28, 2024, while Chapter 2 is set to be released on August 16, 2024.
