## Literature Review

A look at Scott Bakula&#39;s one unfortunate record as the accomplished Star Trek: Enterprise lead and the potential return of Captain Jonathan Archer.




Scott Bakula toplined Star Trek: Enterprise as Captain Jonathan Archer, boldly leading the initially unseasoned crew of the Enterprise NX-01 over four space-faring seasons. Designed as a prequel to Star Trek: The Original Series, Enterprise, unfortunately, suffered from bad timing, network meddling, controversial creative choices, and was ultimately canceled in 2005 after just four years. Enterprise has seen a steady swell in fan support since the cancelation, with increasing calls for a return to the show’s cast and characters. But, despite Captain Archer’s strengths, complexities, and accomplishments – including a post-Enterprise stint as President of the United Federation of Planets – Scott Bakula remains the live-action Star Trek lead with the shortest tenure.




Through its status as a prequel, Star Trek: Enterprise positively changed the franchise and retconned a number of important facets established or assumed by previous series, successfully filling in or countering gaps in Star Trek lore. Critics often refer to Enterprise‘s lack of depth or courage in tackling particular moral or ethical conundrums, alongside a less polished and darker skew to the crew. Though these points have some validity, it’s hard to argue Captain Archer’s vital importance to Star Trek as a whole. The series’ limited run may have fixed Scott Bakula as the franchise’s singular lead with only four seasons, but an Archer return could help to redress the unfortunate record.

Contrasting Star Trek’s other shows at the time, Enterprise suffered the shortest span. Star Trek: The Original Series premiered in 1969, attaining three seasons but Captain James T. Kirk (William Sharner has his USS Enterprise crew enjoyed ten separate movies spanning two different universes (Prime and Kelvin). Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager all enjoyed seven-season runs, with four additional TNG movies. Newer shows Star Trek: Picard and Star Trek: Prodigy (the latter ongoing) have also resulted in extended tenures for Captains-to-Admirals Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew). Although almost two decades have passed since Star Trek: Enterprise concluded, a return to the show, the characters, and the cast is feasible – and has been speculated on over several years.

 CHARACTER   ACTOR(S)   SEASON(S) / MOVIE(S)   Captain Jonathan Archer  Scott Bakula  Star Trek: Enterprise (4 seasons)   Captain James T. Kirk  William Shatner, Chris Pine  Star Trek: The Original Series (3 seasons) &#43; 7 TOS movies &#43; 3 Kelvin movies   Captain Jean-Luc Picard  Patrick Stewart  Star Trek: The Next Generation (7 seasons) &#43; 4 TNG movies &#43; Star Trek: Picard (3 seasons)   Captain Benjamin Sisko  Avery Brooks  Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (7 seasons)   Captain Kathryn Janeway  Kate Mulgrew  Star Trek: Voyager (7 seasons) &#43; Star Trek: Prodigy (2 seasons)   Captain Christopher Pike  Anson Mount  Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (2 seasons, ongoing)   Captain Michael Burnham  Sonequa Martin-Green  Star Trek: Discovery (5 seasons)   Captain Carol Freeman  Dawnn Lewis  Star Trek: Lower Decks (5 seasons)   






A wealth of newer franchise series have continued to add to Star Trek’s multiverse timeline, sometimes overlapping other shows and characters and thus proving that there is room for Scott Bakula’s return as Captin Jonathan Archer. Though Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) admittedly has had (so far) a shorter presence on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, with only two seasons to date, the show’s ongoing nature lends Pike the advantage. Captains Michael Burnham (Star Trek: Discovery) and Carol Freeman (Star Trek: Lower Decks) each attained five seasons (the latter also ongoing). With multiple routes available for Bakula to make a Captain/Admiral Archer return to the franchise, the unfortunate record of Enterprise’s lead could finally be fixed.



In TrekTalks 2 in 2023, actor Scott Bakula himself speculated about an Admiral Archer cameo on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Watch the discussion from 7:52:37 in the video below.

An Animated Star Trek: Enterprise Could See A Captain Archer Return
         

Star Trek: Prodigy and Star Trek: Lower Decks both brought the space-faring franchise back to screens through animation. With a positive reception from fans of all ages, and both series renewed, it’s possible a similar creative approach used to revitalize Enterprise could also find success. Animation would also allow for greater choice in specific time setting as well as storyline – either picking up Enterprise directly to continue the earliest deep-space voyages or introducing the characters into entirely new scenarios more akin to that of Admiral Janeway in Prodigy. Alternatively, a reunion movie – set years after Enterprise’s ill-received final episode – could see the NX-01 ensemble reunite and take to the stars.




While each of the Star Trek: Enterprise actors has undoubtedly clocked some years since the series’ cancelation, the precedent for a returning older cast has already been established. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and his crew transitioned to feature films in 1979, ten years after the culmination of Star Trek: The Original Series. And, more recently, an older Patrick Stewart and the TNG cast appeared in Star Trek: Picard’s third and final season. The announced Star Trek origin movie, due to &#34;take place decades before [the] events of 2009&#39;s Star Trek,&#34; could potentially bring back Scott Bakula as Admiral or Federation President Jonathan Archer, moving him beyond his four-year tenure as Captain of the Enterprise.
