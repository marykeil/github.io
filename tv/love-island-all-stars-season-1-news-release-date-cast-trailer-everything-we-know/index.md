## Literature Review

Love Island is back, but this time it&#39;s All Stars. Former contestants from previous seasons of Love Island are back for a second chance at love.




The inaugural season of Love Island: All Stars has been announced, and it features 12 former contestants looking for a second shot at love. Love Island started as a celebrity series in 2005 when it followed 12 celebrities looking for love. In 2015, it was re-launched, starring regular people instead of celebrities. The UK show has been very popular ever since, drawing large audiences internationally.




Initially, there was supposed to be a winter series of Love Island, but it was canceled. Instead, the show will be making its return in a new format that includes former contestants heading back to the villa. This time, some of the contestants will be arriving at the villa carrying extra baggage, as two of them were once a couple during their season of Love Island.
