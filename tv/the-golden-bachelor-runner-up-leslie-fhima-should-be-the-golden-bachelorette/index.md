## Literature Review
Leslie Fhima was Gerry Turner&#39;s runner-up on The Golden Bachelor. This charismatic and kind woman should be the first Golden Bachelorette.




The Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima was a joy to watch on the show, and she should be the first-ever star of The Golden Bachelorette. Leslie and Gerry had an instant connection when they met on premiere night. She captivated his attention when she wore a costume of an old woman with a gray wig, housedress, and a walker. When she tossed both her costume and prop aside and revealed her dress, Gerry was thrilled. They then shared a dance. Leslie continued to enthrall Gerry with her sexy and sweet personality, from a sensual dance routine in the talent show to sharing that she wears hearing aids like him.




Throughout The Golden Bachelor, Gerry gave Leslie hints that she might be the one he&#39;d choose. From their one-on-one date riding ATVs to their successful hometown date during which he met her family, their relationship kept growing and growing. In the Fantasy Suite, he told her that he loved her, and he thought she was &#34;the one.&#34; However, Gerry chose Theresa Nist instead, leaving Leslie blindsided and heartbroken. As Gerry and Theresa prepare for their live televised wedding, which will air on January 4, 2024, Leslie should be offered the role of the first Golden Bachelorette.

Leslie is a 64-year-old fitness instructor from Minneapolis, Minnesota. She&#39;s a mother to three kids and the &#34;glama&#34; to three grandchildren. She also loves spending time with her mini Aussiedoodle named Billie. Leslie has been divorced twice and is a single mother. She&#39;s been single for 22 years, and she feels that she&#39;s never had a true partnership. However, Leslie repeatedly told Gerry that he had all of the qualities that she was looking for in a man.






 Leslie Opened Herself Up To Gerry Turner 
Leslie Broke Down Her Walls

 

Despite Leslie&#39;s past heartache, she was willing to open herself up to Gerry and break down her walls. This was very difficult for her to do, which was why she was so devastated by their breakup. He gave her the reassurance to express her feelings to him openly, something that she worked hard to do. Gerry made Leslie feel as though she&#39;d be the one he chose, which gave her the confidence to tell him that she loved him. She was ready to spend the rest of her life with him.

However, since that didn&#39;t happen, Leslie can now use this experience to help her move on to the next chapter of her life. As the star of The Golden Bachelorette, she&#39;ll be able to continue to open up her heart to new relationships, but, this time, it will be on her own terms. She won&#39;t have to compete with other women for love, but instead will be in control of her own destiny. Leslie will make the ultimate decision about whom she wants to spend the rest of her life with.






 Leslie Is Exciting 
Leslie Has Led A Very Interesting Life

 

As the Golden Bachelorette, Leslie would bring excitement to the show because of her incredible life story. She&#39;s a former professional figure skater, who is now passionate about helping others live their best lives by working as a personal trainer. Leslie has run 10 marathons, and is a former National Aerobics Champion. She&#39;s a multi-talented person who&#39;d bring a lot of spark and good energy to a Golden Bachelorette season.

On The Golden Bachelor premiere, Leslie revealed that she dated singer Prince when she was younger. He even wrote the song, &#34;Sexy Dancer,&#34; about her. During the Golden Bachelor talent show, Leslie did a sensual dance for Gerry. On her one-on-one date with Gerry, they went ATV riding. She also rappelled with him, although she was terrified. Leslie has an adventurous spirit that would be ideal for a Bachelor Nation show. She also has a soft side, which is very appealing.




Although Leslie can be shy, she&#39;s willing to let loose in certain situations and really show her personality. The leads of shows like these have to be people who can hold the audience&#39;s attention and make them fall in love with them. Leslie has already done that throughout The Golden Bachelor. She has a spark that lights up a room. Leslie has led a very interesting life that would make her season of The Golden Bachelorette even more extraordinary.

 Leslie Deserves A Second Chance 
Gerry Blindsided Leslie &amp; Broke Her Heart

 

After being led to believe that Gerry was going to propose to her throughout The Golden Bachelor, Leslie deserves a second chance at finding love on The Golden Bachelorette. During their final date, Leslie could immediately sense a shift in Gerry&#39;s demeanor, even before he told her that he had a deeper connection with Theresa. As Gerry broke up with her, it was heartbreaking to hear her tell him that at least he didn&#39;t make her get dressed up thinking that he was about to propose to her. Gerry was devastated that he hurt her.




At the &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special, Leslie was able to confront Gerry for the first time since their breakup. She told him that she fell in love with him for his integrity, but he blindsided her. Gerry insisted that he meant it when he told Leslie that he loved her. He said that she was the woman he believed was his person until suddenly he knew that she wasn&#39;t.

Leslie told Gerry that she didn&#39;t know if she accepted his apology, but she understood it. She also said that he showed her that she needed a man with integrity, and someone who&#39;s kind, and all the things that she wanted. Leslie vowed that she was going to find that. It&#39;s wonderful to hear that this experience with Gerry hasn&#39;t jaded Leslie, but instead has made her even more determined to find the love that she so very much wants in her life.

 : Why The Golden Bachelor Finale Will Be Historic

Leslie should be given the opportunity to find true love on The Golden Bachelorette. Although ABC hasn&#39;t greenlit the show yet, it seems inevitable after the success of The Golden Bachelor. If the network decides to go ahead with the show, there&#39;s no one more perfect for the lead role than Leslie. She had an inspiring story of emotional growth and opening up on the show. She should be able to continue to do that, and perhaps find the love of her life in the process. Leslie is wished all the best as she moves forward with the next chapter of her life, hopefully as the first-ever Golden Bachelorette.
