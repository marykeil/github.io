# Pokémon s Anime Has One Major Challenge Ash Still Hasn t Faced


## SUMMARY 



  Ash Ketchum, despite being the world champion, has never battled the Elite Four in an official capacity.   In the anime, trainers who collect eight gym badges enter a tournament conference to battle other trainers with eight badges instead of going straight to the Elite Four.   The Elite Four have been shown in the anime, but their role and appearances vary across different regions.

## Literature Review
In the Pokémon games, there&#39;s one powerful team of trainers that every player must conquer, but Ash has never battled these staples of the series.




Ash Ketchum may now be the reigning world champion, but there&#39;s one set of powerful opponents he&#39;s never had to face in battle, even though nearly every player of the Pokémon games has: the Elite Four. Despite having met many Elite Four members over the years, Ash has never battled against them in an official capacity, but he just might be at the level where that&#39;s an option now.




In the games, a player collects eight gym badges before heading to the Pokémon League, where they then must face the Elite Four (and the Champion), all in succession. However, in the anime, trainers who collect eight gym badges are entered into a tournament conference for the regional area, where they battle against other trainers with eight badges. The winner of this tournament earns the title of Champion, which seems to come with both responsibilities and benefits.

          

The Elite Four have been shown to exist in the anime, with all 4 Kanto Elite Four members appearing in the original series, and sporadic appearances by other members of other regional Elite Four teams occur throughout the series.


 Ash Never Battling the Elite Four is the Anime&#39;s Biggest Missed Opportunity 
          




The role of the Elite Four in the anime isn&#39;t quite clear, but it has been explained to some extent, at least for the Sinnoh region. In the Diamond &amp; Pearl episode &#34;An Elite Meet and Greet!&#34;, Ash meets Lucian of the Sinnoh Elite Four, who explains that the champion of a tournament is then offered the chance to challenge the &#34;Champion League,&#34; which involves defeating each of the Elite Four and the reigning Champion of their region, much like in the games. Since Ash earned his first league championship in the Alola League, which had only recently been established and didn&#39;t have an Elite Four, Ash never challenged them.

Ash did battle against a few Elite Four members outside of their official capacity, but he lost to both the Hoenn Elite Four member Drake and the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint. Dawn also had the chance to battle an Elite Four member, Lucian, to whom she also lost, but who provided her with advice and experience that helped get her Buizel to obey her. These losses would seem to prove that the Elite Four are certainly worthy of their reputations in the anime, as have their other appearances throughout the series. It would certainly be interesting to see Ash face down a gauntlet of the most elite trainers in a region, one after another, with little opportunity to rest.




For being such a major element of the games since the very beginning, it&#39;s definitely odd that the Elite Four haven&#39;t factored into the anime any more than they did. Most Elite Four members were reduced to a single appearance, and many (especially those from Unova and Hoenn) never even appeared in the anime at all. It does, however, mean that there&#39;s still one big challenge out there for Ash Ketchum, should there ever be a desire to return to the character who was the backbone of the Pokémon anime for over 25 years.

               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
