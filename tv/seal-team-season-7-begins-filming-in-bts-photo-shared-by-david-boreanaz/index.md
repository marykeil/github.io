## SUMMARY 



  SEAL Team season 7 has begun filming and marks the beginning of the end for the military drama.   The show is likely to continue addressing the aftermath of Clay&#39;s death and Jason&#39;s struggle with TBI in season 7.   It remains to be seen how their superiors will react to the team&#39;s display of solidarity and if they will face punishment as a result.

## Literature Review
SEAL Team season 7 gets an update from star and executive producer David Boreanaz, who shares a photo as production begins on the last episodes.




SEAL Team season 7 gets an update and a behind-the-scenes photo from lead star David Boreanaz. Following the personal and professional lives of the most elite unit of Navy SEALs while they deliver high-stakes missions, it was announced last year that SEAL Team would end with its upcoming seventh installment. Along with Boreanaz, the Benjamin Cavell-created show stars Neil Brown Jr., A.J. Buckley, and Toni Trucks.




Boreanaz shared a photo on Instagram to commemorate the start of filming on SEAL Team season 7. Check it out below:


 

In the post, the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Bones alum acknowledges the end of the military drama. Boreanaz, also an executive producer of SEAL Team, writes: “The beginning of the end. Jason Hayes, Bravo 1.”


 What To Expect From SEAL Team Season 7 
          

Near the conclusion of SEAL Team season 6, the show killed off original character Clay Spenser (Max Thieriot). Clay dies while trying to save a fellow veteran. This storytelling decision came about partly because Thieriot was leaving to headline another show, the firefighter drama Fire Country, and Clay&#39;s death took a toll on the remaining SEAL Team characters. Even in the season 6 finale, Jason Hayes (Boreanaz) is struggling to come to grips with what happened to Clay and blames himself.




Clay is replaced by Foxtrot transfer Omar Hamza, who is played by the new addition to the cast Raffi Barsoumian. In the SEAL Team season 6 finale, as well, Jason discloses that he has TBI. He even details how that has negatively impacted his recent missions. This does not help Jason&#39;s case with his superiors because of how Jason makes the admission at his Navy Cross ceremony. Before the finale, Jason&#39;s team sticks up for him and shares that they&#39;re all suffering from their separate traumas.

The question for SEAL Team season 7 is how those superiors will react to that display of solidarity and whether the punishment is given to the group as a whole. Beyond that, however, the popular action series will get a chance to offer closure to Jason and the rest of his squad in the aftermath of a hectic and game-changing season 6 that, luckily, didn&#39;t serve as a final chapter.



All episodes of SEAL Team are available on Paramount Plus.
