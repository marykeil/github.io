## Literature Review
When Flight 2525 crashed into the Ontario wilderness in 1996, only seven of the WHS Yellowjackets team are known to have survived to the present day.




WARNING: The following contains SPOILERS for Yellowjackets season 2. 
Now that Yellowjackets is shedding more light on the mysterious circumstances of Flight 2525, which crashed in 1996 and left the WHS Yellowjackets team struggling to survive in the Ontario wilderness, there are more confirmed survivors in the present day — here are all the Yellowjackets survivors known so far. Yellowjackets season 1 focused on the adult lives of Shauna, Tai, Natalie, and Misty, each severely affected by the disturbing things they had to do — including eating members of their own team — to sustain themselves during the winter. When mysterious letters show up on their doorsteps marked with symbols that evoke their shared trauma, they work together to discover their blackmailer&#39;s intentions.

Unfortunately, how many Yellowjackets survived has lost another number in the 2021 timeline as of the Yellowjackets season 2 finale. As each season reveals more Yellowjackets survivors, it also reveals which Yellowjackets might have given their lives to ensure their teammate&#39;s survival twenty-five years later. With a storyline projected to be told over five seasons, audiences can expect to meet a few adult Yellowjackets with each new season. Season 2 brought Yellowjackets like Mari from the background to the forefront, making fans guess who makes it to getting rescued and who doesn&#39;t.

Who dies in Yellowjackets&#39; opening scene? We look at all the clues for who gets killed in the trap, including Shauna&#39;s gold heart necklace.




 7  Shauna Sadecki 
Played by Sophie Nélisse and Melanie Lynskey




Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) is one of the seven Yellowjackets survivors who lives a fairly unfulfilled life as a homemaker with Jeff, Jackie&#39;s former high school boyfriend who slept with Shauna shortly before Flight 2525 crashed and whose child she carried in the Ontario wilderness. Together they have a daughter named Callie whose age correlates with being born sometime in the early &#39;00s, and who attempted to help Shauna and Jeff cover up Adam&#39;s murder. Shauna&#39;s soft-spoken disposition belies a sharp mind with keen instincts honed during her time in the wilderness doing what she had to for survival.
Shauna is one of the most resourceful of the Yellowjackets, as evidenced when she reunites with Tai, Nat, and Misty as adults and immediately takes control of the investigation into the cryptic messages they&#39;ve each received. It&#39;s clear that pragmatism (including being the first to approve of eating Jackie&#39;s corpse) helped young Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) become a natural leader, but she has trouble fitting into the confines of regular society after living with such reckless abandon, and so overcompensated being dutiful, obedient, and generally inconspicuous.





 6  Misty Quigley 
Played by Sammi Hanratty and Christina Ricci
        

Misty (Christina Ricci) works at a nursing facility for the elderly, where the power she exercises over decisions of life and death every day harkens back to the aftermath of Flight 2525, when a geekier Misty (Sammi Hanratty) was able to apply her first-aid skills and save survivors. Misty&#39;s need to be appreciated as a vital part of the team rather than the ignored equipment manager culminated in her destroying the black box that would have helped rescue teams find the wreckage. Even as an adult, she&#39;s still so desperate to maintain a friendship with her old teammates that she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to keep them together, including torture.
Out of all the Yellowjackets survivors, she&#39;s the only one that kills freely still as an adult, and without remorse. Misty has a strong online presence as a &#34;citizen detective,&#34; where she hooks up with fellow detective Walter, who assists her in framing Kevyn for Adam&#39;s murder. Cheerful and optimistic, Misty&#39;s moods can turn on a dime if she feels like her efforts aren&#39;t being appreciated, and she&#39;s been known to sabotage someone&#39;s life just so they&#39;ll become even more dependent on her. Misty is meant to be an unpredictable character, as proven by Misty smashing the black box, something her fellow survivors are privy to and wary of.





 5  Taissa Turner 
Played by Jasmin Savoy Brown and Tawny Cypress





A charismatic state senator for New Jersey, Taissa (Tawny Cypress) has the most to lose if anyone finds out about what the Yellowjackets did in the wilderness, and to ensure the secrecy of the pact made by her and her fellow survivors, she has Jessica Roberts investigate them to determine if anyone&#39;s blabbed. The initial blackmailing scheme draws her into a closer bond with the Yellowjackets survivors, relationships she tries to balance with a home life that included, until the time of their separation, a wife of fifteen years, and a young son.
Tai (Jasmin Savoy Brown) was the Yellowjackets&#39; star player, and after the fateful crash of Flight 2525, she remained an important member of the group. She maintained a relationship with Van and was part of the first group to try to find a route to civilization, which unfortunately ended in Van nearly being mauled to death by wolves. In the present day, as in the wilderness, Tai is plagued by night terrors, sleep-walking, and fugue states in which she isn&#39;t responsible for what her body does, ultimately leading to the disintegration of her marriage, and possibly her political career if she isn&#39;t careful.

After the shocking season 2 finale, anticipation for Yellowjackets season 3 is even higher as fans wonder who the wilderness will choose next.




 4  Natalie Scatorccio 
Played by Sophie Thatcher and Juliette Lewis




A rebel and an outcast ever since her youth, Natalie (Juliette Lewis) had an even tougher time of things after being rescued from the crash thanks to her guilt surrounding her revealed status as the antler queen. She never married her high school sweetheart, didn&#39;t find a fulfilling vocation, and didn&#39;t go on to a prestigious university and become politically ambitious, instead checking in and out of rehab for decades. Unfortunately, Natalie became the next adult survivor to die in the Yellowjackets season 2 finale when she sacrificed herself to save Lisa, expiating her guilt over letting Javi drown and becoming the antler queen.
After the crash, Nat (Sophie Thatcher) used the group&#39;s only found hunting rifle to shoot game and provide for the encampment, establishing a relationship with Travis and trying to prevent the rest of the team from either going completely feral or rallying around Lottie&#39;s visions and dreams for a source of guidance. Tough as nails and unconventional, Nat often pushes people away who care about her for fear of being abandoned first, but reuniting with the rest of the Yellowjackets survivors gave her a sense of community, even if it&#39;s because of their shared trauma. Nat&#39;s death was a tragic note for Yellowjackets season 2 to end on.





 3  Lottie Matthews 
Played by Courtney Eaton​​​​​​​ and Simone Kessell
        

Lottie (Simone Kessell) was one of the two who confused the issue of how many Yellowjackets survived because she wasn&#39;t shown until season 2, now the leader of a cult-like community on a sprawling compound where members agree to be buried alive naked in strange rituals. Lottie slowly becomes the shamanistic leader in the 1996 timeline, but surprisingly she defers her leadership to teen Natalie in the Yellowjackets season 2 finale. Lottie is the most in touch with &#34;the wilderness&#34; entity, believing one of the Yellowjackets survivors must die in 2021 to satiate the wilderness&#39; needs.
When she ran out of medication for her schizophrenia following the crash, Lottie (Courtney Eaton) began to have visions of the future, which made her believe she was a clairvoyant. She killed a bear for the group and used its heart in a strange ritual that seemed to solidify her not only as one of its leaders but part of a faction that could divide the team between her and someone unconvinced of her motives, like Nat. Lottie seems to be genuinely concerned for her friend&#39;s safety, but she&#39;s also seen being petty about a health drink at her commune, suggesting that she&#39;s playing a role for those who want to believe she has mystical abilities.



 2  Vanessa Palmer 
Played by Liv Hewson​​​​​​​ and Lauren Ambrose
        



Van (Lauren Ambrose) is another who confused the issue of how many Yellowjackets survived, as Van didn&#39;t make an appearance until Yellowjackets season 2, episode 4. Her reunion with Tai was particularly emotional and telling, and it&#39;s clear that the two still harbor feelings for one another. It was also revealed that Van has cancer and only months to live, but only Tai is privy to this secret so far. Van feels some partial responsibility for Lottie&#39;s psychosis in the present day, and, as an adult, is a shell of her former self. She runs a video store in her adult life but is plagued by financial issues.
In the wilderness, Van (Liv Hewson) was a capable member of the team, standing up for weaker members after she was nearly killed during a fire from the crash and Jackie did nothing to save her. Fire factors again into Van&#39;s life in Yellowjackets when, after believed to be dead from a gruesome encounter with wolves, her body is placed on a funeral pyre, but she shows signs of life just before burning to death for the second time. Van wholeheartedly believes in the wilderness&#39; power, even convincing Travis to eat his brother to honor Javi&#39;s sacrifice.




 1  Travis Martinez 
Played by Kevin Alves​​​​​​​ and Andres Soto
        

Travis Martinez (Andres Soto) is the first of the adult Yellowjackets survivors to die, accidentally committing suicide in Yellowjackets season 1. Therefore, his adult counterpart doesn&#39;t appear in the series save for a few flashbacks. However, he is still the seventh in terms of how many Yellowjackets survived. Not much is known about Travis as an adult, as he tried his best to keep an extremely low profile. He did suffer from drug addictions and his toxic relationship with adult Natalie only fueled the fire. He was the first to warn the others that the wilderness was coming back to haunt them and accidentally committed suicide while performing a ritual.
In the wilderness, Travis (Kevin Alves) is deeply connected to his family, as his father was the soccer coach to the Yellowjackets team. His father doesn&#39;t survive the crash, but his younger brother Javi does, and he&#39;s heartbroken when he goes missing for two months. Alongside Natalie, Travis is the best with a gun and is taxed with finding food for the group until they eventually resort to cannibalism. Travis believes in the wilderness&#39; power, a belief he carries with him into adulthood. Travis eventually succumbs to eating Javi in Yellowjackets after he was drowned. He forms a relationship with Natalie in the wilderness, but it&#39;s tested multiple times.
               
Yellowjackets   Summary:   Part survival epic, part psychological horror and part coming-of-age drama, this is the story of a team of wildly talented high school girls&#39; soccer players who survive a plane crash deep in the remote northern wilderness. The series chronicles their descent from a complicated but thriving team to savage clans, while also tracking the lives they’ve attempted to piece back together 25 years later. What began in the wilderness is far from over.
