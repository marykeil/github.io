## Literature Review
Every TV show has an iconic, long-awaited couple, but these characters took their sweet time before finally admitting their true feelings. 




A slow-burn romance between two great characters can be one of the best parts of a television show, but sometimes the couple takes a little too long to get together. To keep them apart, the creators and writers might include impossible obstacles and ancillary love interests, which are a ploy to keep the lovers separated. Fortunately, if done right, the wait will be well worth it and the characters will get a satisfying romantic ending.
A series mustn&#39;t play its hand too soon, and get an intriguing couple together too early because then the show has nowhere to go from there. Once the central romantic pair of a show is together, a lot of the tension dissipates, and the only logical step is to break them up, but this is often just a tactic to prolong them ending up together anyway by the show&#39;s conclusion. However, waiting too long can be excruciating for the audience, making them lose interest in whether or not the couple gets together because it feels so impossible. Having a will-they-won&#39;t-they relationship can always be a tricky gamble for a show.
            
 
 9 Couples That Were Better Than Their Show&#39;s Main Will They/Won&#39;t They Romance 
TV shows often feature a &#34;will they/won&#39;t they&#34; romance at its center that fans grab onto. However, a few couples end up surprisingly surpassing it.













 








 10  Ted And Robin - How I Met Your Mother (2005 - 2014) 
Season 9


 







 How I Met Your Mother 

 Release Date   September 19, 2005    Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   9    Story By   Carter Bays; Craig Thomas; Rob Greenberg    Writers   Carter Bays , Craig Thomas    Network   CBS    Streaming Service(s)   Amazon Prime Video    Directors   Carter Bays    Showrunner   Craig Thomas    




Ted (Josh Radnor) went through a lot while looking for the mother of his children, Tracy (Cristin Milioti), on How I Met Your Mother. However, she wasn&#39;t the one he ended up with, Robin (Cobie Smulders) was. The series made it clear very quickly that Robin wasn&#39;t The Mother, and wasn&#39;t compatible with Ted in many ways. They did briefly date at the beginning of the series, but Ted&#39;s desire for a bigger commitment is what kept them apart for so many seasons.
By season 9, Ted and Robin had married other people and finally put the romantic tension of their past behind them. However, this all changed in the final episode of the series when it was revealed that they did end up together many years later. This was a polarizing conclusion and raised the question of why they didn&#39;t just stay together in the first place. Robin&#39;s cold feet and Ted&#39;s insistence that they move quickly were just ploys to keep them apart.





 9  Adora And Catra - She-Ra And The Princesses Of Power (2018 - 2020) 
Season 5
        

 She-Ra and the Princesses of Power 

 Release Date   November 3, 2018    Cast   Aimee Carrero , AJ Michalka , Lauren Ash , ND Stevenson    Genres   Adventure    Seasons   5    Story By   ND Stevenson    Writers   ND Stevenson    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    Directors   ND Stevenson    Showrunner   ND Stevenson    




In the hit animated series, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Adora (Aimee Carrero) is the hero and Catra (AJ Michalka) is the villain, but they are so much more to each other than that. In many ways, the entire series is a metaphor for their relationship, and how they come back together. The pair grew up as best friends but are turned against each other by abusive parental figures and the ongoing war on their planet.
After being hurt so many times by each other and the world, it&#39;s hard to imagine that they can trust each other again. Luckily, they do, and it&#39;s one of the most satisfying love confessions on TV. Some of the best episodes of the series chronicle the evolution of their relationship and how well their character arcs mirror each other, as any good couple&#39;s arc should.





 8  Donna And Josh - The West Wing (1999 - 2006) 
Season 7
        

 The West Wing 

 Release Date   September 22, 1999    Cast   Martin Sheen , Bradley Whitford , Allison Janney    Genres   Drama    Seasons   7    Story By   aaron sorkin    Writers   Aaron Sorkin    Network   NBC    Streaming Service(s)   HBO Max    Directors   Thomas Schlamme    Showrunner   Aaron Sorkin    




Their chemistry has been jumping off the screen since they were introduced in the first season. 

The West Wing is known for many things; its fast-paced dialogue, its political commentary, and Donna (Janel Moloney) and Josh&#39;s (Bradley Whitford) love story. Josh and Donna&#39;s relationship timeline on The West Wing has many twists and turns, and the pair don&#39;t officially get together until the final season of the show. However, it&#39;s well worth the wait as their chemistry has been jumping off the screen since they were introduced in the first season. Though it makes sense that the power dynamic of their working relationship would be difficult to overcome, as Donna is his secretary, they overcome this beautifully.





 7  Stiles And Lydia - Teen Wolf (2011 - 2017) 
Season 6


 







 Teen Wolf 

 Release Date   June 5, 2011    Cast   Holland Roden , Tyler Posey , Dylan Sprayberry , Melissa Ponzio , Tyler Hoechlin , Arden Cho , Crystal Reed , jr bourne , Shelley Hennig , Colton Haynes , Dylan O&#39;Brien , Linden Ashby    Genres   Action , Drama , Supernatural    Seasons   6    Story By   Jeff Davis    Writers   Jeff Davis    Network   Paramount    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu    Franchise(s)   Teen Wolf    Directors   Jeff Davis    Showrunner   Jeff Davis    




Few teen dramas have been as successful at keeping such an obvious couple apart as Teen Wolf was with Stiles (Dylan O&#39;Brien) and Lydia (Holland Roden). At first, it seems that the popular and beautiful Lydia would never go out with the awkward and unpopular Stiles, but their relationship grows into one of mutual respect and love. They go through many trials together and learn to rely on each other in tough situations. Although it takes a long time for Lydia to return Stiles&#39; affections when she does, it feels well-earned.





 6  Mulder And Scully - The X-Files (1193 - 2018) 
Season 7
        

 The X-Files 

 Release Date   September 10, 1993    Cast   Gillian Flynn , David Duchovny , Robert Patrick , Annabeth Gish , Mitch Pileggi    Main Genre    Sci-Fi    Seasons   11    Story By   Chris Carter    Writers   Chris Carter    Network   FOX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43;    Franchise(s)   The X-Files    Directors   Chris Carter    Showrunner   Chris Carter    




Possibly the most famous slow-burn relationship on TV is that between Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) on The X-Files. As two FBI agents and partners in their work, the characters do everything in their power to keep their relationship professional and ignore the feelings that develop between them. This becomes increasingly difficult to do, and by season 7 the tension was too much to bear; they had to be together. Although their relationship has not run smoothly since they got together, they did end up having a child together in the recent revival. 
            
 
 The X-Files: What Happened To Mulder &amp; Scully&#39;s Baby After The Series Ended 
In Christ Carter&#39;s sci-fi television series The X-Files season 8, episode 21, &#34;Existence&#34; William Scully was born; here is what happened to him. 









 5  Luke And Lorelai - Gilmore Girls (2000 - 2007) 
Season 4


 







 Gilmore Girls 

 Release Date   October 5, 2000    Cast   Lauren Graham , Scott Patterson , Sean Gunn , Keiko Agena , Matt Czuchry , Alexis Bledel , Yanic Truesdale , Kelly Bishop , Melissa McCarthy , Edward Herrmann , Liza Weil , Jared Padalecki , Milo Ventimiglia    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   7    Story By   amy sherman-palladino    Writers   Amy Sherman-Palladino    Network   The WB    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix    




There is little argument that the best and most compatible couple on the show is Luke and Lorelai. 

There are almost too many love triangles to count in Gilmore Girls, and though Rory&#39;s (Alexis Bledel) romantic entanglements are slightly more talked about, Luke (Scott Paterson) and Lorelai&#39;s (Lauren Graham) love story is one for the ages. In a classic friends-to-lovers arc, Luke and Lorelai are everything to each other, but can&#39;t admit it until the very end of season 4. Even then, a myriad of obstacles come their way and stop the couple from living in the domestic bliss they deserve. There is little argument that the best and most compatible couple on the show is Luke and Lorelai.





 4  Donna And Harvey - Suits (2011 - 2019) 
Season 8
        

 Suits 

 Release Date   June 23, 2011    Cast   Patrick J. Adams , Sarah Rafferty , Gabriel Macht , Meghan Markle , Rick Hoffman , Gina Torres , Amanda Schull , Dule Hill , Katherine Heigl    Genres   Comedy , Drama    Seasons   9    Story By   aaron korsh    Writers   Aaron Korsh    Network   USA    Streaming Service(s)   Amazon Prime Video , Netflix , Peacock    Directors   Peacock    Showrunner   Aaron Korsh    




For a long time, it was hinted in Suits that Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and Harvey (Gabriel Macht) may be each other&#39;s other half, but they&#39;re just not meant to be together. The other characters on the show are constantly hinting and insinuating that they&#39;re in love, and that their chemistry is undeniable. However, the pair themselves are resolute in their claims that everything is perfectly platonic.
Suits was indeed more concerned with Mike&#39;s (Patrick J. Adams) professional and personal issues for the majority of the show, so it takes almost the entire series for Donna and Harvey to get serious about each other. Donna is afraid of getting hurt, and Harvey is afraid of commitment, and they love each other too much to try something before they&#39;re both ready. Fortunately, getting married at the last moment in the series finale is exactly the kind of drama that the couple lives for.





 3  Brennan And Booth - Bones (2005 - 2017) 
Season 6
        

 Bones 

 Release Date   September 13, 2005    Cast   Emily Deschanel , T.J. Thyne , Michaela Conlin , John Francis Daley , David Boreanaz , Tamara Taylor    Genres   Comedy , Drama , Crime    Seasons   12    Story By   Hart Hanson    Writers   Hart Hanson    Network   FOX    Streaming Service(s)   Hulu , Disney&#43;    Directors   David Boreanaz    Showrunner   Hart Hanson    




Brennan (Emily Deschanel) and Booth (David Boreanaz) are an unstoppable pair when it comes to catching bad guys and solving impossible crimes, but they&#39;re not as competent in their romantic relationships. The central struggle between the two is that Brennan is too rational and relies too deeply on science, while Booth is too emotional and doesn&#39;t use logic when he should. While it&#39;s true that opposites attract, the characters are certain for many seasons that they are too different to ever make things work. When they do get together, it&#39;s through a lot of compromise and sacrifice, but their love makes it worth it.





 2  Alison And Emily - Pretty Little Liars (2010 - 2017) 
Season 7
        

 Pretty Little Liars 

 Release Date   June 8, 2010    Cast   Troian Bellisario , Ashley Benson , Holly Marie Combs , Lucy Hale , Bianca Lawson , Laura Leighton , Chad Lowe , Shay Mitchell , Nia Peeples , Ian Harding    Genres   Drama , Mystery    Rating   TV-14    Story By   Sara Shepard    Writers   Ina Marlene King    Network   ABC , Freeform    Franchise(s)   Pretty Little Liars    Showrunner   Ina Marlene King    




Emily (Shay Mitchell) has some of the worst luck in the romance department on Pretty Little Liars. She carried a torch for Alison (Sasha Pieterse) for many years, despite Alison&#39;s lying and manipulation of Emily and the rest of their friends. The show ends with Alison and Emily happily married with children, but it&#39;s not an easy road to get there.
They&#39;re involved with many other people throughout the seasons, and it&#39;s always uncertain if Alison truly returns Emily&#39;s feelings or if she&#39;s using them to her advantage. Alison acts pretty selfishly throughout the series, and she has to change to be worthy of the love and loyalty that Emily provides. Though the women are constantly fighting for their lives on the show, in the end, it seems that the connection between Alison and Emily is real.





 1  Michonne And Rick - The Walking Dead (2010 - 2022) 
Season 6


 







 The Walking Dead 

 Release Date   October 31, 2010    Cast   Steven Yeun , Andrew Lincoln , Chandler Riggs , Laurie Holden , Jeffrey DeMunn , Sarah Wayne Callies , Melissa McBride , Norman Reedus , Jon Bernthal , Iron E. Singleton    Genres   Horror , Thriller , Drama    Seasons   11    Story By   Tony Moore, Robert Kirkman, Charlie Adlard    Network   AMC    Streaming Service(s)   Netflix , AMC Plus    Franchise(s)   The Walking Dead    Directors   Greg Nicotero    Showrunner   Frank Darabont , Angela Kang , Scott M. Gimple , Glen Mazzara    




There are few people as deserving of a true and happy relationship as Michonne and Rick. 

When Michonne (Danai Gurira) and Rick (Andrew Lincoln) get together in season 6 of The Walking Dead, it came as a surprise, but looking back at their chemistry and relationship over the seasons, it makes total sense. There were few people that the characters could rely on as solidly as each other, and having a strong foundation of friendship and trust are key factors in a relationship. Additionally, there are few people as deserving of a true and happy relationship as Michonne and Rick. Having someone to watch the other&#39;s back and find moments of normalcy and romance during the apocalypse was a warranted addition to their lives.
