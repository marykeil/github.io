## Literature Review
Marvel&#39;s Echo is almost here, so here&#39;s a recap with 10 things to know about Maya Lopez, Daredevil, and Kingpin from past MCU projects.




The first season of Marvel&#39;s Echo is nearly here, though there are a handful of things from past MCU projects that would be helpful to know beforehand. Starring Alaqua Cox as Maya Lopez, Echo is set to continue her journey of revenge against Kingpin (Vincent D&#39;onofrio), her &#34;uncle&#34; who orchestrated the death of her father. The show is also set to feature a new appearance from Charlie Cox as Daredevil ahead of the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again series.
Recent promos for Echo have finally confirmed that Netflix&#39;s Daredevil series is indeed canon with the rest of the MCU. This means that the histories of both Matt Murdock&#39;s Daredevil and Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin are part of the established continuity, just as much as Maya&#39;s history as seen in Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye. To that end, here are 10 things to know from previous MCU movies &amp; shows involving Maya&#39;s Echo, Daredevil, and the Kingpin himself.

 10  Kingpin Rises To Power Thanks To The Battle of New York 
Netflix&#39;s Daredevil (2013) &amp; Hawkeye (2021)
        

Using the Battle of New York seen in 2012&#39;s Avengers to his advantage, Wilson Fisk rose to power using construction companies to reconstruct and rebuild Hell&#39;s Kitchen. However, it was also used as a cover for all his illicit activities and criminal operations, putting him in league with various other criminal factions. Publically, Fisk was seen as a philanthropist, though in truth he was New York&#39;s Kingpin of Crime, seeking to guide and control the entire city&#39;s criminal underworld.
Fisk&#39;s connections included his support of William Lopez and the Tracksuit Mafia, a relationship that saw him often caring for William&#39;s daughter Maya to whom he was seen as an uncle. Fisk also entered a working relationship with Eleanor Bishop who was forced to join his organization to pay off the debts of her late husband who died during the Battle of New York.





 9  Daredevil Becomes The Protector Of Hell&#39;s Kitchen 
Netflix&#39;s Daredevil (2013)


 







Kingpin&#39;s plans for Hell&#39;s Kitchen were interrupted thanks to lawyers Foggy Nelson, Matt Murdock, and their client Karen Page who&#39;d worked for Fisk&#39;s construction company, inadvertently discovering its illicit activities such as money laundering. Murdock also began his vigilante career as Daredevil, becoming Hell&#39;s Kitchen&#39;s new protector following Fisk&#39;s first arrest after his criminal activities were leaked to the FBI.
Daredevil would then continue protecting Hell&#39;s Kitchen in his Netflix series. This included when Fisk continued to be a threat from prison, the rise of Frank Castle&#39;s Punisher, as well as the threat of the ninja cult known as The Hand which saw Murdock teaming up with other New York-based vigilantes such as Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and Jessica Jones (as seen in Netflix&#39;s The Defenders).





 8  Daredevil Defeats And Dismantles Kingpin&#39;s Empire 
Netflix&#39;s Daredevil (2013)
        

Having gained complete control of Ryker&#39;s Island, Fisk began selling out other New York criminals, using the FBI to effectively clear out his biggest rivals. Likewise, Fisk began extorting various FBI agents, earning himself a house arrest in the Presidential Hotel which gave him even more freedom to continue his criminal empire. Eventually, Fisk painted Daredevil as a terrorist which made it easier for him to clear his name in the eyes of the law he&#39;d so deeply corrupted on multiple levels.
That being said, the posthumous testimony of Special Agent Ray Nadeem finally ended Fisk&#39;s massive deceit, combined with Daredevil who&#39;d been working with Nadeem and eventually defeated Fisk alongside Ben Poindexter&#39;s Bullseye who&#39;d also been manipulated by Fisk. Murdock also warned that if Kingpin ever tried leaving prison again, he&#39;d go after Fisk&#39;s new wife Vanessa who&#39;d willingly made herself just as complicit in Kingpin&#39;s criminal empire. Likewise, Fisk made his own threats about going after Foggy and Karen, resulting in a very uneasy agreement so long as Fisk remained behind bars.

 7  Kingpin Survives The Snap And Takes Over Tracksuit Mafia 
Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye (2021)


 







As confirmed in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye, Kingpin survived the Snap seen in Avengers: Endgame, though it has yet to be revealed how that resulted in his freedom from prison, what the consequences might have been, nor what the reaction was from Daredevil. Nevertheless, it&#39;s revealed that Kingpin continued working toward his ongoing goal of controlling New York&#39;s underworld, particularly with the Tracksuit Mafia. To that end, it seems as though the events of the Blip motivated Fisk to make some major changes to his relationship with the Tracksuits.





 6  Kingpin Manipulates Ronin Into Killing William Lopez 
Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye (2021)
        

With Clint Barton&#39;s Hawkeye having become the dark and murderous vigilante known as the Ronin during the Blip, Fisk chose to manipulate and use Barton to his advantage. Not wanting to jeopardize his relationship with Maya, Fisk leaked the information of a Tracksuit meeting to Barton who subsequently ambushed the meeting and killed William. This allowed Fisk to take control of the Tracksuits directly. He also made Maya one of his loyal captains who continued believing that the Ronin was to blame.





 5  Matt Murdock Represents Spider-Man 
Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)
        

As seen in Spider-Man: No Way Home, the exposure of the Webslinger&#39;s secret identity thanks to Mysterio saw Peter Parker having none other than Matt Murdock as his lawyer. Thanks to Murdock, all legal charges against Spider-Man were dropped as Mysterio had tried to frame Peter as his murderer. However, there wasn&#39;t much Murdock could do about the public who began seeing Spider-Man as more of a menace, a perception continually motivated by the Daily Bugle&#39;s J. Jonah Jameson.





 4  Maya Lopez Seeks Revenge On Ronin 
Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye (2021)
        

Thanks to Kate Bishop wearing Clint Barton&#39;s old suit in Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye, the Ronin had seemingly returned. This motivates Maya Lopez to begin a revenge quest against the man who killed her father, forcing Clint and Kate to work together as the Tracksuits begin pursuing them, as was the Black Widow assassin Yelena Belova who was hired to kill Clint by Kate Bishop&#39;s mother Eleanor. However, Clint ends up revealing the truth to Maya that it was Kingpin who fed him the information about the Tracksuit meeting.

 3  The Tracksuit Mafia Are Taken Down By Hawkeyes 
Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye (2021)
        

As seen in Hawkeye&#39;s finale, the Tracksuits were sent by Fisk to assassinate Eleanor following her decision to leave the business and her threats that she would expose Kingpin. However, Kate and Clint were able to dispatch all of the Tracksuits while Maya herself took down Kazi Kazimierczak, having turned on Fisk and the Tracksuit Mafia. Likewise, Kate Bishop successfully defeated Kingpin himself while Clint handled Yelena Belova, though Fisk managed to flee the scene before the police arrived.





 2  Maya Lopez Shoots Kingpin In The Eye 
Marvel&#39;s Hawkeye (2021)
        

Although Fisk got away before he could be arrested, he was soon found by Maya aiming a gun at his head. Realizing that Maya has learned the truth about her father, Fisk says to Maya that they&#39;re family, and that family sometimes doesn&#39;t see eye to eye. Ignoring her &#34;uncle&#34;, Maya shoots Kingpin in the head, mirroring the comics where Fisk was temporarily blinded. As such, the same will likely be revealed in Marvel&#39;s Echo as Maya continues her vendetta against Fisk.





 1  Daredevil Teams Up With She-Hulk In LA 
Marvel&#39;s She-Hulk: Attorney At Law (2022)


 







2022&#39;s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law saw Matt Murdock briefly working in Los Angeles, representing superhero fashion designer Luke Jacobcs in court opposite Jennifer Walters while also receiving a new suit mirroring his very first yellow and red suit in the comics. This eventually leads to a team-up between Daredevil and She-Hulk when Jacobs gets kidnapped, as well as some romantic involvement between the two heroes.
