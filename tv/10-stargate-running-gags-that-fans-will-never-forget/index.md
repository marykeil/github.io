## Literature Review
From blue Jell-O and Simpsons references to hidden pineapples and the infamous &#34;magnets,&#34; - the Stargate franchise had several long-running jokes.




There are hundreds of episodes within the Stargate franchise, and Stargate SG-1 especially is full of gags and inside jokes that continue from beginning to end. The science fiction series was mostly serious in its themes, with parasitic alien races attempting to take over the galaxy, tragic deaths, and doomed relationships. Still, Stargate left plenty of room for fun. It&#39;s clear when looking at recurring props, references, and quirky character traits that the cast and crew enjoyed making the show just as much as we loved watching it. Noticing these subtle (though sometimes not so much) moments and jokes is the cherry on top of watching and rewatching Stargate.
The longest-running installment in the Stargate franchise is Stargate SG-1, and this is where the majority of the best gags got their start. Overall, Stargate is full of outrageous concepts, so a certain amount of comedy is necessary to explain away aspects of the story that will never make much sense. By not taking itself too seriously, all the campy sci-fi goodness goes down a whole lot easier. This continued into Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe, and other installments in the franchise, resulting in the reoccurring and long-running gags that make Stargate... Stargate​​​​​.
            
 
 Where To Watch Stargate Online

 10  Jack O&#39;Neill&#39;s Obsession With The Simpsons 
The Simpsons are frequently mentioned in Stargate SG-1.
        

Jack O&#39;Neill was among the Stargate franchise&#39;s best characters, and this has a lot to do with how believable he was as a real person, especially compared to the geniuses or aliens that frequented Stargate SG-1. One of the more delightful aspects of Jack&#39;s character was his relatable love for The Simpsons, the real-world cartoon that got its start back in 1989. According to Stargate writer and producer Joseph Mallozzi, actor Richard Dean Anderson, as well as many of the show&#39;s other writers, truly were huge Simpsons fans, so references to the cartoon were thrown in as often as possible.
Richard Dean Anderson&#39;s (and Jack&#39;s, by extension) love for The Simpsons ultimately inspired Dan Castellanetta to write an episode featuring a Stargate SG-1 convention, in which Anderson cameoed. 






 9  &#34;Magnets&#34; Became Stargate&#39;s Explanation For Everything 
When in doubt, blame it on magnets.
        

As a sci-fi series, Stargate was full of fantastical events presented as &#34;science.&#34; Of course, most of this was utterly nonsensical, which is precisely what you want from a series within the genre. Though there are often ways that concepts such as wormhole travel can be backed up with real-world physics and logic, there are times that we have to enjoy the ridiculousness for what it is. In these cases, Stargate, especially Jack, would use &#34;magnets&#34; as the answer for everything. It&#39;s a sort of meta, self-aware way for the series to say, &#34;Yeah, we don&#39;t know either. Just roll with it.&#34;





 8  The Wizard Of Oz References Galore 
&#34;I have a feeling we aren&#39;t in Kansas anymore.&#34;
        

The only real similarity between Stargate and The Wizard of Oz is the concept of traveling from one &#34;world&#34; to another, and that was enough to keep a running gag going throughout Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, and Stargate Universe. Though this started with the typical cliche of &#34;Toto, I have a feeling we aren&#39;t in Kansas anymore,&#34; it ultimately evolved into references and quotes around every corner from various characters. In the 200th episode of Stargate SG-1, the cast even got to get all dressed up as characters from The Wizard of Oz.





 7  Peter DeLuise&#39;s Clever Stargate Cameos 
Even Teal&#39;c&#39;s candles were in on the Peter DeLuise cameos.


 







Actor and writer Peter DeLuise was heavily involved in creating Stargate SG-1 and appeared as a wide variety of background characters throughout the series. Most of these were negligible, and it&#39;s possible for someone to make it all the way through the 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1 without ever noticing him. However, when you know what to look for, it&#39;s easy to spot DeLuise everywhere. Mallozzi even pointed out on his blog that in the scene in which Teal&#39;c sits in meditation, a group of his candles had been arranged to spell out PDL—DeLuise&#39;s initials.





 6  Stargate Command’s Famous Blue Jell-O 
There&#39;s always plenty of Jell-O to eat at the SGC.
        

Really, it&#39;s not just blue Jello-O. The desert is served in abundance in several colors in both the Stargate Command and Atlantis&#39; mess halls. The characters can&#39;t seem to get enough of it, and the blue Jell-O especially stands out as an odd choice for a repeated snack. Mallozzi states in his blog that he has no idea why this trend ever got started in Stargate SG-1 and that it seemed to be something the props department put together for a bit of fun. Ultimately, the SGC&#39;s love for Jell-O was even acknowledged by the characters, with Teal&#39;c once suggesting that he and Jack O&#39;Neill visit a place on Earth rumored to feature battles within a pool of the stuff.
            
 
 6 Reasons A Stargate Reboot Needs To Happen 
The Stargate franchise has already expanded far past the original 1994 movie, however, the story could still be a great reboot for a current audience.









 5  Jonas Quinn’s Love For Snacks 
Jonas Quinn&#39;s famous banana is a character all its own.


 







One of the greatest lovers of the SGC&#39;s Jell-O is Jonas Quinn. Of course, he is a fan of really any food, as seen throughout Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. Quinn was often enjoying a snack, even when it seemed strange to have one (i.e., the banana scene in Stargate Atlantis). This character quirk has been revealed to be the work of actor Corin Nemec, who used food as a trademark bit throughout the series. Like Jack and his love for The Simpsons, this made Quinn an even more lovable character, allowing him to be relatable despite his otherworldly genius.





 4  Teal’c’s “Indeed” Catch Phrase 
Teal&#39;c&#39;s go-to answer grew into so much more in the Stargate franchise.
        

Teal&#39;c&#39;s formal and seemingly emotionless way of speaking is used to drive home the fact that he isn&#39;t a human, but it also serves to add an element of comedy to his character. Still, it doesn&#39;t seem that Teal&#39;c&#39;s catchphrase of &#34;Indeed&#34; was meant to be funny initially, but it eventually evolved into the character&#39;s own running joke of Stargate SG-1. The character responded with this single word so often that it became endearing, and, according to Mallozzi, actor Chris Judge began adding the word where it hadn&#39;t been scripted. This opened the door to some great comedy, especially when Teal&#39;c answered &#34;indeed&#34; to juxtapose a scene&#39;s mood.





 3  Stargate SG-1’s Giant Wrench 
The go-to tool to fix the Stargate was a comically large wrench.
        

The giant wrench is another background feature of Stargate that could be missed on the first watch—but once it&#39;s noticed, it&#39;s hard to unsee. The comically huge tool is the answer to what sort of equipment would be necessary to fix alien technology, with no real explanation as to what on the Stargate the wrench would loosen or tighten. It&#39;s typically donned by Stargate fight coordinator Dan Shea, who doubles as an SGC maintenance worker in Stargate.





 2  The Mystery Of Jack O’Neill’s Mug 
There was always something floating in Jack O&#39;Neill&#39;s coffee.


 







While other characters were eating Jell-O, Stargate SG-1&#39;s Jack O&#39;Neill was likely giving a disgusted glance down into his mug. This started early in the series when Jack was tiredly drinking coffee in the mess hall and seemed to notice something strange in his mug. It&#39;s never mentioned precisely what he saw floating there, but it made a frequent reappearance since any time O&#39;Neill had a mug, he went through the same routine of squinting down into it and attempting to fish the mysterious thing out.





 1  The Hidden Pineapples of The SGC 
Can you spot all the hidden pineapples in Stargate?
        

Any Stargate episode directed by Will Waring will likely have a pineapple hidden within the SGC. These are typically a little trickier to spot than blue Jell-O or giant wrenches, often hidden within Daniel Jackson&#39;s equipment, among the tables of food in the mess hall, or sometimes even placed out in the open on other planets. According to Mallozzi, Waring has used pineapples as a calling card ever since one of his first productions, when he put the fruit in the back window of a car as a joke before shooting a car chase scene. He forgot to remove it, and the fruit ended up in the film&#39;s final cut. From then on, especially in Stargate, the director always had a pineapple ready for shooting.
