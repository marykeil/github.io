## Literature Review
Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of My Hero Academia is on the way, but it faces a huge problem that the live-action One Piece didn&#39;t deal with.




Netflix is currently working on a live-action adaptation of the beloved anime My Hero Academia, but the upcoming movie faces one challenge that Netflix&#39;s live-action One Piece series didn&#39;t have to worry about. Netflix has seriously invested in the market of live-action anime adaptations in recent years, with the streaming service tackling some of the most iconic anime of all time in an attempt to present them in a new light. My Hero Academia is one of the next shows on Netflix&#39;s docket of live-action anime adaptations, and while their One Piece show turned out to be a hit, it didn&#39;t have to deal with one My Hero Academia problem.




Based on the manga series of the same name, My Hero Academia is one of the most popular anime currently running, with the series being bigger than ever as it heads into My Hero Academia season 7. The series follows a young aspiring superhero named Deku who is gifted his superpowers by the immensely powerful hero All Might, allowing Deku to enroll in a prestigious school for superheroes. Both the manga and the anime adaptation have been massively successful, and My Hero Academia is about to make another big swing by releasing a live-action adaptation on Netflix.

                  8 Challenges Netflix&#39;s Live-Action My Hero Academia Faces Adapting The Anime   Netflix is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of My Hero Academia, but its live-action adaptation will have numerous challenges to overcome.    


 Netflix&#39;s Live-Action My Hero Academia Could Struggle Because Of Superhero Fatigue 
         




My Hero Academia is a series all about superheroes, and while this is one of the staples of the franchise, this could also be the live-action Netflix movie&#39;s biggest obstacle. Superhero fatigue is a real thing right now, with many audiences getting tired of consuming superhero media. The constant barrage of Marvel and DC projects as well as other lesser-known works have caused the market for superhero movies and TV shows to become immensely oversaturated, with many fans completely checking out of the genre. While some projects have still managed to succeed, 2023&#39;s superhero box office numbers show that this fatigue has swept through the genre.

The live-action My Hero Academia movie may simply be coming at the wrong time, as releasing a big-budget superhero series in the current media climate is a really bad idea. Superhero projects from Marvel and DC have been flopping left and right, and while My Hero Academia is a big name on its own, it&#39;s still small compared to the two comic book titans. If Marvel and DC can&#39;t succeed, a My Hero Academia project on Netflix will have an even harder time finding its footing, with superhero fatigue potentially killing the show before it even has a chance to establish itself.






 The Live-Action One Piece Didn&#39;t Have Many Pirate Stories To Compete With 
         

The live-action My Hero Academia movie is undoubtedly a repsonse to Netflix&#39;s live-action One Piece and the massive success that it found, with Netflix presumably believing that My Hero Academia will find similar levels of success. While both projects are anime adaptations, their different genres are what make them stand apart, with this also being why One Piece succeeded when My Hero Academia could fail. This is because, as a superhero show, My Hero Academia has all kinds of competition, whereas One Piece had almost no pirate stories to compete with.

Outside of Pirates of the Caribbean, a franchise that has been dormant for a while now, there are very few major franchises that revolve around pirates. Shows like Black Sails and Our Flag Means Death have attempted to bring swashbuckling stories of piracy to television screens in the past, but shows like this are few and far between. Because of this, One Piece had a lot of demand that it could feel while facing very little competition, with the live-action adaptation standing out from the little competition it didn&#39;t have. One Piece didn&#39;t have to deal genre oversaturation, while My Hero Academia will have to face this issue head-on.






 How Netflix&#39;s My Hero Academia Adaptation Can Overcome Its Superhero Problem 
          

Although My Hero Academia is a superhero show, it isn&#39;t doomed from the start, as there are several ways that the movie can overcome its superhero problem. Firstly, My Hero Academia is a pretty weird series, and this unique tone could allow it to stand out from the shows that Marvel and DC are releasing. My Hero Academia also focuses on a major world of original superhero characters, meaning that it will be stories that vary from the typical superhero fare. Netflix can find ways to advertise My Hero Academia in a way that makes it stand out, preventing it from falling prey to superhero fatigue.

             My Hero Academia In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
