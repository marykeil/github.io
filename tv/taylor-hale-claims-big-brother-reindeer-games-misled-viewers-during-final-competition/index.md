## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games just wrapped up a hugely successful inaugural season, but Taylor Hale is calling out the show for its editing choices.




Nicole Franzel may have won Big Brother Reindeer Games, but runner-up Taylor Hale is scratching her head over some editing decisions when the finale aired on CBS. Taylor hasn&#39;t been in the world of Big Brother for very long, but she&#39;s already a legend. She first joined the franchise for Big Brother 24 and was the victor in a couple Head of Household competitions along the way. She overwhelmingly won the jury&#39;s vote against Monte Taylor and came out on top in the America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest vote as well. As a result, she clearly earned her spot on Reindeer Games.




While watching the Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 finale, Taylor took to Twitter to question why the producers and editors crafted the episode in the way that they did.


 

She admitted she was desperate to reveal secrets that viewers didn&#39;t get to see in the final edit. She said, &#34;I have ONE editing critique. It was even closer than you saw.&#34; She wants to be invited on a podcast to divulge all the behind-the-scenes scoop. Whether it&#39;s on a podcast or an interview with a media outlet, it&#39;s likely she&#39;ll have the opportunity to open up about her critique. A lot of the other eliminated Reindeer Games contestants have been interviewed after their exits, so her time will surely come.

It wasn&#39;t that long ago that Taylor won Big Brother 24--just over a year ago, in fact. So her victory was likely fresh in everyone&#39;s minds as she returned to compete against the likes of eventual winner Nicole Franzel-Arroyo, Frankie Grande, Xavier Prather, Britney Haynes, Josh Martinez, Danielle Hendricks, Cody Calafiore and Cameron Hardin. All of these players earned the status of Big Brother legend in some way or another, which is why they were invited back to play in the holiday spin-off Reindeer Games.

It would be really interesting to hear Taylor go more into detail about what viewers didn&#39;t see during the final Big Brother Reindeer Games competition. She and Frankie faced off against each other for a spot in the Final 2, which resulted in the latter&#39;s elimination. Right before that, Xavier chose to compete against Nicole, which turned out to be a big mistake because Nicole took him out. In the end, Taylor was unable to pull off the win against Nicole and became the runner-up of Big Brother Reindeer Games.




What separates Reindeer Games from a regular season of Big Brother is that there are no live elements; the entire season was filmed before airing on CBS. That&#39;s why the contestants have been able to give their thoughts on social media during and after every episode. While it&#39;s great to see their reactions while watching the show, there&#39;s been a demand for Big Brother Reindeer Games to add live feeds if the show is renewed. If that happens, it could add another layer of excitement to what has already been a very successful holiday spin-off.
