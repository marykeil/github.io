Summary

  The Traitors US season 2 traitors should not turn on each other as it would be a huge mistake for their game.   The traitors have a good mix of powerful allies from different shows supporting them.   Arguments among the traitors risk exposing their identities, potentially putting them in danger of banishment.  







The Traitors US season 2 traitors--Dan Gheesling, Phaedra Parks, and Parvati Shallow--are beginning to turn on each other, but that will be a huge mistake for them moving forward in the game. In the beginning of The Traitors US season 2, they stuck together and worked to strategically eliminate players. Dan and Phaedra murdered Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio on night one, while the trio eliminated Marcus Jordan in the second murder. However, the third Traitors US season 2 murder caused some tension among them as it had to be a murder in plain sight.

Phaedra and Dan left it up to Parvati to manipulate someone into drinking from a poisoned chalice, and she ended up settling for Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, when her other plans fell through. However, Phaedra had voted for Ekin-Su to be banished at the last round table, so she felt that Parvati had put her at risk. Dan and Parvati saw this as an opportunity to possibly expose Phaedra to protect themselves. Then, Parvati called out the Housewives at the next round table, greatly upsetting Phaedra. While betrayal is part of the game, it would be a mistake for the traitors to turn on each other now for several reasons.

 The Traitors Have A Good Mix Of Allies On Their Side 
         

The Traitors US season 2 traitors each came into the game from a different show. They&#39;re in the perfect position as they have the powerful Big Brother, Survivor, and Real Housewives players on their side through each of their alliances. Dan has an alliance with Janelle Pierzina, Parvati has a truce with Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Phaedra has the Housewives, including Larsa Pippen (Miami), Shereé Whitfield (Atlanta), and Tamra Judge (Orange Country), as well as Shahs of Sunset star Mercedes &#34;MJ&#34; Javid on her side. There are so many other players that they could be targeting before they turn on each other and their allies.






 The Traitors Risk Exposing Their Identities If They Argue Too Much 
          

One of the main reasons that Phaedra stepped back from the murder in plain sight was that she thought it would look suspicious if she was suddenly spending time with Parvati and Dan when they don&#39;t usually hang out. They&#39;ve done a good job of separating themselves from each other to avoid being found out. However, if they argue too much with each other, the faithfuls might pick up on the vibe that their relationships are deeper than what they appear to be.

At the round table, Parvati pointed out that there is a &#34;performance aspect&#34; to being on a Real Housewives show. This put suspicion on the Housewives, including Phaedra, Larsa, Shereé, and Tamra. Larsa countered that they don&#39;t act; they simply live their lives. However, Parvati argued that it&#39;s a type of performance. She also said that they appeared to be working together.




Phaedra warned Parvati in front of everyone, &#34;We are not killing anyone. So don&#39;t do the Housewives thing, honey. Don&#39;t do that, Parvati.&#34; For viewers in the know, this argument had so much subtext. It&#39;ll be intriguing to see if any of the faithfuls noticed the extreme tension between Phaedra and Parvati, and will begin to put the pieces together.

                  10 Ways Janelle Pierzina’s Big Brother Gameplay Makes Her A Perfect Contestant For The Traitors US   Janelle Pierzina is a contestant on The Traitors season 2. Here&#39;s why her legendary Big Brother gameplay makes her perfect for this game of deception.   



 The Traitors Need To Protect Each Other From Banishment 

 

While the traitors have a lot of power in the game, it&#39;s nearly impossible for anyone to save themselves from banishment once the group bands together against them. That&#39;s why it&#39;s shocking that Dan and Parvati voted out Larsa, who is part of Phaedra&#39;s Housewives alliance. Phaedra voted out Kevin, who has no connection to any of the traitors. Dan was able to justify his vote because Larsa had voted against him the previous week. However, Parvati&#39;s actions seemed very shady to Phaedra because she had no excuse.




Phaedra later told Dan and Sandra that Parvati put her &#34;under suspicion&#34; with her &#34;wild accusations&#34; about the Housewives. She said that she didn&#39;t need that type of heat on her. In Parvati&#39;s confessional, she admitted that she wasn&#39;t sure if Phaedra was only acting angry with her, or if she really was. She quickly found out that Phaedra was livid with her. Phaedra told Parvati that it wasn&#39;t &#34;cool&#34; for her to do that to her because it brought attention to her. Phaedra lashed out at Parvati saying, &#34;No one likes you Parvati. Everyone says you&#39;re a f****** traitor.&#34;

Phaedra then warned her, &#34;We can be in this game together, but you&#39;re gonna play fair. And if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re gonna have more problems than the faithfuls.&#34; Phaedra said in her confessional that what Parvati did that night was &#34;unacceptable&#34; and she &#34;will not tolerate it at all.&#34; Phaedra told Parvati that she was playing very fair with her. Phaedra then told both Parvati and Dan, who&#39;d been playing dumb about what happened, &#34;So don&#39;t do that to me. Both of you.&#34;




Although Parvati thinks that it would be great to &#34;burn a traitor&#34; because it would take the suspicion away from her, she&#39;s foolish to cross Phaedra. While she&#39;s right that Phaedra is &#34;the traitor that no one suspects,&#34; that should be seen as an advantage for Parvati and Dan. Phaedra can work with the Housewives to convince them to banish the people that the three of them want to see eliminated. However, now that Dan and Parvati voted out Larsa, Phaedra might be less likely to protect Parvati and Dan from the remaining Housewives, including Shereé, who&#39;s declared that they have to focus more on the gamers. Parvati and Dan are at the top of the gamers list.

                  This Traitors US Season 2 Mission Twist Is Raising The Stakes (Spoilers)   The Traitors US season 2 has spiced up the missions by adding a twist that could throw a wrench into the traitors&#39; diabolical plans for murder.   



 The Traitors Have No Idea What New Twists Could Be Coming 
          




While Dan and Parvati believe that it could be a good thing to put some suspicion on Phaedra, they could be making a fatal mistake. Dan said in his confessional that he feels that Phaedra will be the last traitor found out, and he doesn&#39;t think that he can win if she&#39;s a traitor. He wants to use Parvati to take a shot at Phaedra when the time presents itself.

Although this sounds like a great plan, Dan and Parvati should&#39;ve learned that anything can happen on The Traitors US season 2. The murder in plain sight twist was completely unexpected, and it seems as though it was just the beginning of many more changes to the game in season 2. It would be foolish for the traitors to turn on each other now. They&#39;ve already gotten to know each other, and they could have even more trouble if they banish one of their own, and end up with someone less trustworthy as a traitor. There&#39;s also no guarantee that they&#39;ll be recruiting the next member themselves, especially if season 2 continues to throw twists at them.




The Traitors US season 2 has taken a turn as the traitors are now at each other&#39;s throats. Phaedra was playing very fair with Parvati and Dan, but Parvati provoked her by calling out the Housewives in front of everyone at the round table. It&#39;s completely understandable that Phaedra would be upset, but she shouldn&#39;t strike against Parvati just yet. It&#39;s possible that Parvati&#39;s overconfidence could lead to her digging her own grave. The traitors will have to regroup and move past this argument if they want to win The Traitors US season 2.



The Traitors US season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
