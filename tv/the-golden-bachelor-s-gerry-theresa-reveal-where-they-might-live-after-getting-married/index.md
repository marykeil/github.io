## Literature Review
Golden Bachelor&#39;s Gerry lives in Indiana and Theresa is from New Jersey. The couple discusses where they will live after getting married in January.




The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist finally revealed their tentative moving plans after they get married in January 2024. Gerry began his journey on The Bachelor spin-off in 2023 with over 20 women to choose from to become his next wife. For months, speculation was rampant over who Gerry would get married to. In the end, he had to make a difficult choice between Theresa and Leslie Fhima. The Hudson, Indiana-based retired restaurateur ended up asking Theresa, the 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey, to marry him. Gerry will marry Theresa in a highly anticipated televised wedding next year.




Gerry and Leslie’s historic wedding is going to take place at the La Quinta Resort &amp; Club in La Quinta, California, but there&#39;s a lot of interest in knowing where the couple will live after that happens. In an interview on Live With Kelly &amp; Mark, Gerry revealed that “early on” they thought that Charleston would be a great area.


 

Theresa even has family that lives there. However, “since being in New Jersey a few times, I really like that area,” he added. This means Gerry and Theresa have “two areas” to explore house hunting, which they think “doubles the fun.”

As Live co-host Kelly Ripa, who’s from New Jersey, made a pitch for her home state, Gerry agreed that it’s “gorgeous” and that the ocean being close was the “real selling point” for him. Kelly added that they’ve got the “best blueberries in the world,” with Theresa looking at Gerry to remind him how much he likes blueberries. “Done!” Gerry shouted in excitement, with Theresa declaring, “Blueberry donuts,” which might be able to convince Gerry after all. Meanwhile, Gerry also used the Live With Kelly &amp; Mark interview to talk about the horrid proposal that had Theresa confused and thinking she was the one that was rejected.

Gerry had told Theresa, “I came to the realization that you’re not the right person for me to live with,” before he took a long pause and said, “You’re the person I can’t live without.” Kelly wanted to know if the producers asked Gerry to drag on the proposal to keep fans in suspense. Gerry confessed, “They suggested it would be really great TV. They didn’t realize it’d be horrible for Theresa.” Theresa recalled the proposal, saying, “It was so mean!” Theresa did end up saying yes to Gerry, despite the meanness of the proposal.




The Golden Bachelor’s first-ever lead will now be tying the knot with Theresa in a live wedding come January. The special will be the first televised nuptials for the franchise since Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici got married in 2014. The show will be sending Gerry and Theresa on a trip to Italy for their honeymoon. They wanted to get married as soon as possible because Gerry and Theresa believe that they didn’t have a lot of time to waste at their age.



The Golden Wedding airs live January 4 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
