## Literature Review
Married At First Sight season 17&#39;s Brennan may say he&#39;s trying to protect Emily, but a fan theory has some thinking he may not be looking out for her.




Married At First Sight season 17 is well underway and as the couples get back into their real lives post-honeymoon, Brennan Shoykhet&#39;s motivations around protecting his new wife Emily Balch are being questioned by fans. Throughout the first several episodes of MAFS, viewers have been introduced to the new cast of the first Denver iteration of the series. Brennan and Emily chose to trust in the experts behind the series and give their relationship a try on Married At First Sight season 17. While things haven&#39;t been easy, Emily and Brennan&#39;s marriage seemed to be on a decent path at the beginning.




In a recent Reddit post from u/cinquefoil9, it was explained that Brennan&#39;s sense of toxic masculinity could be the thing that pushes his marriage to Emily over the edge. &#34;To basically heavily imply he’s not into Emily but refuse to answer her questions because he wants to &#39;protect her&#39;,&#34; the fan shared, after Brennan annoyingly played coy with Emily in a recent episode. &#34;You can’t protect someone when you’re the one causing the pain.&#34; Brennan&#39;s been showing signs he&#39;s not attracted to Emily for several episodes but refuses to say anything despite her giving him an opening on MAFS.

While Brennan and Emily seemed like they may be a decent pair during their Married At First Sight wedding and quickly thereafter, many fans feel that he&#39;s been entirely unattracted to her from the beginning of their relationship. &#34;He isn’t into her and this was evident when she walked down the aisle,&#34; Reddit user u/Witty-Rabbit-8225 shared. &#34;He can just admit she’s not his type instead of coldly staring into the abyss every episode.&#34; While Emily is beautiful, it&#39;s apparent that Brennan isn&#39;t interested in her hair extensions or false lashes, and he&#39;s made that clear to viewers while managing to hide his true feelings from Emily.





 

While Brennan and Emily&#39;s marriage may be hitting a few roadblocks, it&#39;s possible their relationship will make a comeback once they start communicating with one another. If Brennan isn&#39;t fully unattracted to Emily physically, it&#39;s possible he&#39;s simply hoping to get to know her better before bringing up his concerns about her outward appearance. Though some believe that Breannan doesn&#39;t have feelings growing for his new wife, others wonder if it&#39;s simply taking time for them to get to know each other. Brennan could turn a corner on Married At First Sight season 17 moving forward as he gets to know Emily on an even deeper level.

With Married At First Sight season 17 continuing on, Emily and Brennan&#39;s relationship dynamic has been one of the most interesting to play out this season. While he may not be fully interested in pursuing their marriage moving forward, their relationship has had moments of genuine affection and proven that when they&#39;re communicative, they seem to connect. Though Emily deserves someone who will be open and honest with her, the fact that the pair are choosing to work on their communication could be a positive sign for the Married At First Sight couple.
