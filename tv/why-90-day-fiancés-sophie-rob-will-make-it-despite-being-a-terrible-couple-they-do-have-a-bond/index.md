## Literature Review
Sophie Sierra and Rob Warne may not seem compatible, but they’re pulling ahead as one of the strongest couples of 90 Day Fiancé season 10.




Sophie Sierra and Rob Warne from 90 Day Fiancé aren’t a great duo, but they still have great potential as a couple. The 23-year-old British native and the 32-year-old from California are two new cast members on 90 Day Fiancé season 10. They first fell for each other’s looks on Instagram and later got into a relationship because of their relatable pasts. On the surface, the biggest issues between Sophie and Rob are their mismatched lifestyles and differing financial statuses. However, newer red flags are becoming evident as they spend more time together.




In the last few episodes, it was noticed that Sophie and Rob aren’t on the same maturity levels. Sophie is more serious about her relationship, while Rob is more concerned about getting married. Rob proposed to Sophie the moment she landed at the airport, compelling her to say yes. Later, he ignored her concerns about his small apartment that didn’t have an attached bathroom. The couple also recently started doubting each other’s fidelity. Sophie used a dating app to find friends, while Rob had previously sent intimate videos of himself to another woman.

There is some suggestion that Sophie and Rob are a gone case because they have too many issues. However, a few positive aspects of their bond hinted that they may make their relationship work. The first big relatable factor is the couple’s identical aspirations. Rob and Sophie are on the same page about tying the knot and living together in the United States. Unlike Jasmine Pineda, who dislikes Gino Palazzolo’s hometown, Sophie is fine moving to the U.S. Rob is also on board with making Sophie his wife and doesn’t care about the age gap.



 Rob &amp; Sophie Had Similar Struggles Growing Up 
         

Rob and Sophie have revealed how they immediately fell for each other’s physical appearances. However, they bonded over their past struggles related to their skin color. The 90 Day Fiancé star previously shared that she was bullied at her Spanish school because she was a mixed-race kid. She implied that Rob has also faced similar issues, which led her to form a stronger connection with him. Rob and Sophie’s matching pasts will always pull them together through their problems. They will be able to feel for each other until something truly breaks them apart.






 Rob &amp; Sophie Would Want To Stay In The Limelight 
          

Sophie and Rob have been compared to 90 Day Fiancé season 9 couple, Miona and Jibri Bell. The new couple’s looks and social media behavior hint that they want to cash in on the reality TV fame like their peers. Rob and Sophie have likely joined the reality TV show to make a bigger name for themselves and build a brand. They seem to be promoting themselves as youthful social media influencers already. The last few seasons of the show have proved nothing is for certain. Sophie and Rob may stay together on 90 Day Fiancé despite the odds.
