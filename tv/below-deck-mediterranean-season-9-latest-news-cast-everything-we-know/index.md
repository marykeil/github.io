## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 will be coming to an end, meaning season 9 will start filming soon. Here&#39;s an update on Below Deck Med season 9.




Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 has been captivating to watch, meaning viewers are now getting excited about Below Deck Med season 9. The Bravo series began in 2016 with its inaugural season, introducing now well-known cast members like Chief Stew Hannah Ferrier. Hannah went on to fill that role for five seasons before she was fired in the middle of Below Deck Med season 5 for having Valium on board. The series also introduced Aesha Scott, who&#39;s now the chief stew on Below Deck Down Under, Malia White and Katie Flood, who are now on Winter House season 3, and several other popular Below Deck Med alums.




Despite the amazing cast members past seasons have introduced, Below Deck Med season 8 had a few that will go down in Below Deck history. Kyle Viljoen and Natalya Scudder, who also appeared on Below Deck Med season 7, had an intense feud that caused Natalya to leave the boat, while Tumi Mhlongo, who was on Below Deck Down Under season 1, made a splash as her first time as a chief stew. Luka Brunton was also from Below Deck Down Under season 2, a replacement deckhand towards the end of the season. However, the newbies, Lara Du Preez, Max Salvador, and Chef Jack Lubby, also made the season one to remember.

 Below Deck Mediterranean Season 9 Latest News 
          




According to BravoTV, Below Deck Med season 9 has been confirmed. The news was revealed during BravoCon in November 2023, which took place in Las Vegas. Besides knowing that the show is returning, nothing else has been confirmed about the series. The return is not a shock though, since, according to TV Deets, the rating for Below Deck Med season 8 has been fantastic. Their season high was 891,000, while their season low was 735,000, which is still outstanding for a Bravo series. Below Deck Med season 8 is still on the air, so fans likely won&#39;t get any further updates until sometime in the middle of 2024.



 Below Deck Mediterranean Season 9 Potential Release Window 
          

Below Deck Med season 9 will likely air sometime between May and September 2024. From seasons 1 to 3, Below Deck Med premiered sometime in May, while seasons 4 to 7 aired between June and July. Below Deck Med season 8 aired later than usual, with a premiere date of September 25, 2023. The late premiere date was likely due to the premiere of Below Deck Adventure in late 2022, which pushed other shows like Below Deck Sailing Yacht and Below Deck Down Under back a little bit. Since Below Deck Med season 8 likely won&#39;t end until early January 2024, Below Deck Med season 9 will probably premiere sometime in September.






 Below Deck Mediterranean Season 9 Potential Cast 
         

The cast for Below Deck Med season 9 is still unknown, but there are a few guesses about who may return. With rumors of Natalya and Kyle being friends again, there&#39;s a possibility they both will return next season. They both like to stir the pot and cause some drama, which makes the show fun to watch. As for Tumi, it seems unlikely that she will return as she has been receiving some backlash regarding her leadership skills. However, this was her first time as chief stew, so maybe the network will give her a second chance. Captain Sandy Yawn will also likely return for her eighth season as the captain.



 When Will Below Deck Mediterranean Season 9 Start Filming?  
          




According to jorreddit1010 on Reddit, Below Deck Med season 9 has allegedly already been filmed. The user screengrabbed an image from Bravo and Cocktails on Instagram, from three months ago, revealing some unknown faces and Captain Sandy filming with their camera crew. They also caught Aesha in her uniform on the boat, along with a cameraman in the background. It&#39;s unclear what Aesha&#39;s role is on the boat, but she would likely be the chief stew if she did film for Below Deck Med. In the past, filming usually took place around October/November, but according to the Reddit thread, filming seemingly started around September.
