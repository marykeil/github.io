## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé couple Nikki Exotika and Igor AKA Justin&#39;s current relationship status after season 10 is confusing. It appears they have split.




90 Day Fiancé couple Nicole Sanders AKA Nikki Exotika and Igor Shutencov AKA Justin seem to no longer be together after filming season 10. Nikki is a trans woman from Hoboken, New Jersey, and Justin is a personal trainer from Moldova, who had a unique storyline when they started their reality TV journey. Nikki had met Justin 17 years ago in his country after a bad breakup. Justin was barely 20 back then and Nikki was in her 30s. The couple dated for two years before Justin proposed to Nikki, and she brought Justin to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. Things went sour between the two when Nikki came clean to Justin about her sexuality.




Justin was shocked and went back to Moldova and was depressed for several years. He still stayed in touch with Nikki and, nearly two decades later, the couple decided to give their relationship a second chance. Nikki and Justin met in person and got engaged again. Nikki filed for a K-1 visa a second time and went back to Moldova in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. However, as the season progresses, Nikki is having second thoughts. Nikki began thinking about where she wanted to go with the relationship. She wondered if she wanted to end it or continue her relationship after episode 12.

Nikki noticed that Justin was refusing to get intimate with her once she arrived in Moldova. He claimed he was conscious of indulging in PDA because of fear and respect for local people. However, Justin soon told Nikki about his cheating on her before their engagement. Justin told Nikki to let bygones be bygones and that he just had some friends with benefits. Nikki said they were already together. Justin insisted that being intimate with a different woman didn’t mean anything to him. However, he shocked Nikki by suggesting they “could try together” with “another girl” and see how “easy” it was.

Justin shamelessly told the cameras that it was his “dream” to have a threesome with “two women.” He wanted his fiancé to open up to the idea and see what he was feeling. Nikki told Justin she’d experimented with such things in her 20s but wasn’t interested anymore. Nikki wondered if Justin wanted to have threesomes because of her gender. “Why don’t you just go be with another woman?” Nikki said.






 Justin Broke Up With Nikki On Text In Mid-Season Preview 

 

The mid-season preview of 90 Day Fiancé season 10 released in December 2023, revealed what’s to come for Nikki and Justin in the upcoming episodes. The couple is shown horse riding while Justin comments he’s having some “sweet moments” with her. However, Justin tells the cameras that while he feels love for Nikki in his heart, his body “don’t feel the same.” Nikki is seen commenting that maybe there’s “somebody else” that his mind is on. “And it’s not me,” she adds. In a different clip towards the end of the video, Nikki and Justin are in the car where he accuses her of “doing nothing” in their relationship.

When Nikki exclaims, “I don’t do nothing?!” Justin comments, “cook, clean. Be with me.” Nikki is crying when she tells Justin that she’s trying, but he is hard to please. “Learn,” he shouts, as Nikki is shown recording her confessional interview. Nikki is weeping while telling the producers that she just received a message from Justin and he “literally just broke up” with her through a text. Nikki gets up, angrily yanks her mic off, and runs out of the filming area crying.






 Nikki Has Deleted Her &amp; Justin&#39;s Couple Instagram Page 
          

Nikki hardly has any posts about Justin on her Instagram. Justin doesn’t post anything about Nikki on his Instagram at all. Moreover, Nikki and Justin also had a joint Instagram account when they started their 90 Day Fiancé journey together. It was called @reallifebarbieandken. The account doesn’t exist anymore. It appears Nikki may have deactivated it after splitting up with Justin, or else, she’s just trying to create drama in their off-screen life and Justin is already in the U.S. on a K-1 visa after a possible reconciliation.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
