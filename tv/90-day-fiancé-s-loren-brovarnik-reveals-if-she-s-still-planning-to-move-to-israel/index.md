## Literature Review
During an Instagram Q&amp;A, 90 Day Fiancé’s Loren Brovarnik reveals if she’s considering saying goodbye to her life in Florida and moving to Israel.




Loren Brovarnik from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise hasn’t given up on her plan to move to Israel with her husband, Alexei Brovarnik, and three children. Alexei is from Israel, and his family still lives there. It was the major reason the couple had previously discussed the possibility of uprooting their life from the United States and settling in Israel with their kids. On Loren &amp; Alexei: After the 90 Days, Loren’s parents weren’t thrilled about her decision to move to Israel. However, they still tried to be supportive.




While Loren seemingly enjoys living in Florida with Alexei and her three kids, 90 Day Fiancé fans are curious to learn if she’s still considering moving closer to Alexei’s family in Israel. A social media user recently asked Loren during an Instagram Q&amp;A, “Are you still planning to move to Israel at some point?” The reality star with over 1.4 million Instagram followers posted a picture with her husband with the response, “Ya never know.” Although Loren didn’t confirm it, she did hint that the Israel move wasn’t off the table yet. 


 Loren &amp; Alexei&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Loren first met Alexei in 2013 during her Birthright trip to Israel. She fell in love with him and had her American wedding in 2015. While the ceremony was great, Loren chose to have another ceremony the following year. She had her Israeli wedding with Alexei in 2016. Although Loren and Alexei are one of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise’s most compatible couples, they have faced major challenges in their marital life. The couple recently argued with Loren’s parents about their potential move to Israel. They seemed determined to move to Israel, regardless of anyone’s concerns, but eventually decided not to.

It’s interesting how Loren told 90 Day Fiancé fans about her upcoming Israel plans. She didn’t give a clear answer and used ambiguous language to keep people hooked. Loren is an excellent social media influencer with millions of followers. She knows how to keep her followers interested in her and build hype around her. Loren may return to another 90 Day Fiancé spin-off in 2024. She is probably trying to be as vague as possible to keep people on their toes and probably doesn’t want to give away spoilers yet.

Loren might have decided that moving to Israel isn&#39;t the best choice for her right now. While the country has previously had controversies and disputes, the recent Hamas war is probably its worst issue. More than 22,000 people have lost their lives near Gaza. If Loren wants to settle in Israel, she should probably wait a few years before considering it. The country is no longer the same place where she first met Alexei. Instead, it has become a warzone with casualties and tragedies. Hopefully, the 90 Day Fiancé alum will make the right decision.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
