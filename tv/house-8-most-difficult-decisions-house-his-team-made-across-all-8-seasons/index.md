## Literature Review

House and his team have the difficult job of saving lives, and often whether or not someone is saved relies on them making a tough call.




The team in House, M.D. is forced to make life-altering decisions daily, but some of these decisions are incredibly complicated and challenging for the team to make. House is one of the most intense and dramatic medical dramas, with the diagnostic team dealing with some of the most medically challenging cases possible. The series follows the team as they try to navigate complex medical cases, which sometimes require testing, analysis, and treatment in morally questionable ways.
To get the truth from patients, House encourages his team to break into patients&#39; homes and frequently put their medical licenses on the line with near-impossible choices. However, these things come up in almost every episode, so when things get even more complex for the team, the choices are much more difficult to navigate. Despite the challenges, the team has to make choices in order to save lives and give patients and each other their best shot.









 








 8  Which Baby Survives 
House Season 1, Episode 4, &#34;Maternity&#34;
        

When a disease begins to spread in the maternity unit at Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital, House and his team must act decisively to save the lives of the babies in their care. As the team tests the babies, they narrow down the illness to two possible sources, which each require different treatments. With six babies already affected and potentially more that may become ill, House chooses to run a test by treating two of the babies with differing medications, essentially gambling on which treatment may work.
The team struggles to come to terms with a decision that will mean certain death for one of the babies. However, it will result in the team being able to accurately treat the remaining babies. The decision makes its way up the ladder to Cuddy and a legal counsel, but ultimately, the choice is left for House to make, and the team administers two different treatments. As a result, one baby dies, and the others are eventually properly diagnosed and treated.
