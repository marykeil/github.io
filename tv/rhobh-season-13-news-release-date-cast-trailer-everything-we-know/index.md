## Literature Review
The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills season 13 returned on October 25 for another season of glamour and drama. What do we know about the season?




The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills returned to Bravo on October 25 for another season, with new storylines, new drama, and some new cast members. RHOBH has been a part of the Real Housewives franchise since 2010, and while it has shifted in many ways throughout the series, the drama has always remained steady. With various casting changes through the years, very few housewives have been a part of the series for the duration, with Kyle Richards as the only original cast member who has appeared every season. The series has always been a glitzy, glamorous look at the lives of the Beverly Hills elite.




While the series wasn&#39;t one of the original iterations of the Real Housewives franchise, it has been one of the most successful in the franchise. The show draws in viewers with its luxurious cast members and keeps them with a high level of drama between them. Many of the RHOBH ladies have been performers in the past or are currently working in the entertainment industry, giving the series a somewhat different feel than the other casts&#39;. With another season on the horizon, many are curious about the details of RHOBH season 13.
