## Literature Review
Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh are among the most popular 90 Day Fiancé franchise couples, but they aren’t better than Kimberly Rochelle and TJ.




Kimberly Rochelle and Tejaswi “TJ” Goswami are far more compatible than 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way’s Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh. Kimberly and TJ debuted in the franchise in 2023, while Jenny and Sumit joined the series in 2019. The couples had similar journeys due to matching cultural gaps and family issues. Kimberly and Jenny are both independent ladies from the United States, while Sumit and TJ belong to conservative families in India. Therefore, the two couples had strikingly similar relationships, with the ladies trying their best to navigate their new lives surrounded by unexpected responsibilities.




Since TJ and Kimberly debuted on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, they’ve been compared to Sumit and Jenny. TLC also realized the striking similarities and brought Jenny and Sumit to the Tell All, so they could advise the new pair on how to lead a successful life. Unfortunately, Kimberly and TJ felt insulted by their peers and their intervention. They disrespected Sumit and Jenny and later called them fake on social media. Fortunately, the much more experienced pair showed maturity. Sumit and Jenny called TJ and Kimberly immature kids to close the argument.

 TJ &amp; Kimberly’s Story Didn’t Start With A Lie 
          

TJ and Kimberly aren’t liked much, but they are still a better couple than Sumit and Jenny. When TJ and Kimberly met on Facebook, they had a genuine connection. They built their relationship on mutual trust and love. In comparison, Sumit and Jenny’s first meeting was thoroughly fake. Sumit pretended to be a handsome and rich man to catfish Jenny into falling in love with him. He later married another woman in India and didn’t tell Jenny about it. While Sumit and Jenny are in a healthy marriage now, it’s hard to deny the foundation of their relationship isn’t as strong.






 TJ Didn’t Let His Family Disrespect Kimberly 
          

Another thing that makes TJ and Kimberly a better couple is their sense of respect. While the pair have had their arguments, they haven’t let their families stop them from pursuing each other. TJ even defended Kimberly in front of his brother numerous times. In comparison, Sumit allowed his family to insult Jenny for a long time. He didn’t stop his mother from pushing Jenny over the edge, making her work unnecessarily, and disrespecting her. Sumit did run away and married Jenny secretly, but he rarely did his due diligence as her partner.



 TJ &amp; Kimberly Are Compatible &amp; Didn’t Wait Years To Get Married 
          




TJ and Kimberly are much better because they tied the knot in time. Marriage is the most important part of a relationship, allowing pairs to focus on their lives together and build something meaningful. It marks the start of a family. TJ and Kimberly married a few years after meeting each other. They faced many challenges but are now much happier together. Sumit and Jenny didn’t tie the knot for years. If the former 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple had married when Jenny was in her 50s, they would have had much more to look forward to.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.




             90 Day Fiance: The Other Way 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way flips the script on the original series - couples that have never met face to face and have 90 days to get married switches roles - the American in the relationship will now head overseas for their culture shock. India, Mexico, Ethiopia, and Russia are just some of the countries where the show will observe the blossoming (or faltering) 90-day relationship that will end happily ever after or a one-way ticket back with heartbreak.
