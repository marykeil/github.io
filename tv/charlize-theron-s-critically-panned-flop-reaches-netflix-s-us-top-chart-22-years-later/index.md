## Literature Review

2002 psychological horror film Trapped, which stars Charlize Theron as a mother trying to save her kidnapped daughter, finds Netflix success.




Charlize Theron’s film Trapped winds up with unexpected Netflix success. Based on the Greg Iles novel 24 Hours, Trapped is a 2002 psychological thriller about a couple who have to fight to save their daughter after she is kidnapped. The film is directed by Luis Mandoki and stars Theron alongside Kevin Bacon, Courtney Love, and Dakota Fanning.




Now, Trapped finds Netflix success as it makes its way into the top 10 chart in the United States. Trapped came in at no. 9 on the list for the week of January 8–January 14. Topping the list are Lift, Society of the Snow, and The Equalizer 3.


 Trapped’s Critical Reception Explained 
          

Though it is rallying back towards success now, Trapped did not experience the same positive reaction when it was initially released. Trapped’s Tomatometer sits at a rotten 17% on Rotten Tomatoes. The audience score is slightly higher, sitting at 48%, but still leaves Trapped with generally unfavorable reviews.

Trapped was also considered a gigantic flop at the box office. During its 2002 run, the film grossed a mere $13.4 million worldwide. This was a weak showing given its estimated $30 million, which made it so that Trapped ended up losing money. This huge flop was a surprise given the cast included some notable stars in Theron, Bacon, and Fanning.




                  Every Charlize Theron Action Movie Ranked From Worst To Best   From Fast &amp; Furious to Mad Max, Charlize Theron&#39;s career has been fairly action-packed, but how do her action movies rank from worst to best?   

Trapped may have failed to make an impact during its release in 2002, but it luckily sees some much-delayed success as it makes the Netflix chart. The success of Trapped could be due in part to Bacon’s presence in the Netflix hit Leave the World Behind, as viewers may have been recommended other content with the actor. However Trapped’s success came to be, it is good news for both Bacon and Theron as they prepare for their next roles (which include Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F for Bacon and Atomic Blonde 2 for Theron).
