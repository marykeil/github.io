## Literature Review
The direction of My Big Fat Fabulous Life has changed, and there were questions rather the series should be allowed to continue.




Whitney Way Thore gained viewers&#39; attention with her authentic and relatable personality on My Big Fat Fabulous Life; however, fans aren&#39;t sure the show is worth watching anymore. Although My Big Fat Fabulous Life is rumored to return, the program is far from one of the best reality TV shows. Whitney was known to make the best of her circumstances and would do anything she put her mind to. Now that the show&#39;s direction has changed, interest is lost.




This isn&#39;t the first time the show has been scrutinized, and with each passing season, it becomes increasingly likely My Big Fat Fabulous Life is scripted. When MBFFL was renewed for season 11, it wasn&#39;t as well received as the network may have liked. However, enough viewers tuned in that the show will likely return for season 12 in early 2024. Is MBFFL still worth watching?


 Whitney Thore Is No Longer Invested In Herself 
          

Instead of focusing on her health, happiness, and personal goals, Whitney has prioritized her love life. The reality TV star has had her heart broken after a string of failed love interests, and viewers are fed up with the recycled storyline. Fans can no longer support Whitney&#39;s chaotic relationships on MBFFL and would rather see her return to other areas of her life. In a Reddit thread by u/lucid_dreamer36, a Redditor said, &#34;I hope the new season has more &#34;content&#34; and doesn&#39;t revolve around Whitney&#39;s romances. I hope they can get back to some of the things that were likable about her.&#34;






 Whitney Just Wants To Be An Influencer 
          

Before Whitney reached reality TV fame, she had humble beginnings on YouTube as a dancer who wanted to inspire her followers. She tried to encourage other women to do what they loved regardless of their situation and prove that nothing is impossible. Her mindset and genuine determination propelled Whitney to become a powerful Instagram influencer. Unfortunately, Whitney has changed, and the show is hanging on by a thread. Her fun and go-get-&#39;em attitude has been replaced by self-pity and self-deprecating humor. Another fan commented on the thread, &#34;How is this possible? They barely had anything this past season...some things feel forced.&#34;

While many fans would rather see My Big Fat Fabulous Life and its cast cut its losses, the show propels toward season 12. Following Whitney along on her journey from the mundane parts of her life to the unexpected is still piquing the interest of some viewers. Although the reality show may be going in a different direction, it&#39;s still a guilty pleasure that&#39;s hard to turn away from.
