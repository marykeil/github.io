  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Gino Palazzolo isn’t the only 90 Day Fiancé star who is obsessed with caps. Some other cast members have made hats an important part of their styles.</p>
<p>Over the last ten years, 90 Day Fiancé has featured many quirky and unique cast members, like Gino Palazzolo who is obsessed with wearing hats. Another strange cast member is Natalie Mordovtseva, who surprised her fans with her eccentric personality and habits. The Ukrainian woman previously discussed her love for trees and how she adores hugging them. She said she gets energy from embracing trees in her arms. Likewise, former cast member Steven Johnston weirded viewers out by acting like a child in front of the cameras. He treated his lover, Alina, like a baby, which made 90 Day Fiancé fans call him out on social media.
A few years ago, Korean man Jihoon Lee disclosed Deavan Clegg’s weird sleeping habit. He claimed that she purposely made her daughter sleep in their bed. When Jihoon confronted his former partner about it, she claimed that it wasn’t wrong and that she did the same in her childhood. Controversial Big Ed Brown gave one of the biggest viral 90 Day Fiancé franchise moments ever. He revealed that he used mayonnaise on his hair. He showcased the entire procedure in front of the cameras, making viewers grossed out and cringe. While there have been many weird trends among the cast, hat-wearing has become a big staple.
