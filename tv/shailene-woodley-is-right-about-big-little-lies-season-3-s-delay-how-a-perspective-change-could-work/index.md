## Literature Review
Big Little Lies season 3 has finally been confirmed almost 5 years after the release of season 2, which could lead to a twist in the cast.




Almost 5 years after the release of Big Little Lies season 2, a third season has been confirmed that, as star Shailene Woodley has said, could benefit from the filming delay. Rumors about Big Little Lies season 3 have been swirling for years, but star and producer Nicole Kidman finally confirmed the news in a Q&amp;A in November 2023. Based on the book of the same name by Liane Moriarty, Big Little Lies was originally meant to be a miniseries, but the success led to a renewal. Little is known about Big Little Lies season 3, but it would have to feature a time jump.




Big Little Lies seasons 1 and 2 followed a group of five women–Woodley, Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, and Zoe Kravitz–who become connected by secrets and lies when a murder shakes their Monterey community. Though not all of the Monterey Five start the series as friends, they are bonded by their mutual love for their young children and desire to protect them and each other. The Big Little Lies season 2 cliffhanger ending saw them finally confessing their secret, suggesting that season 3 will have an entirely different story with new lies that could bring them even closer together.

 Shailene Woodley Is Right That Big Little Lies Season 3&#39;s Delay Is An Opportunity 
The 5-year gap gave the children time to grow up
          

Shailene Woodley recently spoke about Big Little Lies season 3 and how the 5 years since season 2 ended are actually beneficial to the series and its story. She shared that it’s been a “dream” for the cast to finally do a third season, hinting that the original five main actresses are all on board. Woodley also talked about the actors who played their children. This includes Iain Armitage, who played her son in the series before he went on to star in Young Sheldon. The children were a strong part of the supporting cast, but as Woodley noted, they’re no longer children.




“They’re teenagers now,” the actress said. “That, to me, is what is exciting about the possibility of a third season. What does life look like for those people who are not children anymore?” Armitage is now 15 years old; Darby Camp, who played Reese Witherspoon’s younger daughter, is 16, and Kathryn Newton, who played her older daughter, is 26. The kids of Big Little Lies no longer need their mothers stepping in to confront their bullies and using them as pawns in their petty games. Now that they’re of high school age, Big Little Lies season 3 can tell a new story while following the formula that brought them success.



 How A Season Focused On Big Little Lies&#39; Younger Cast Could Work 
Season 3 could see the Monterey Five&#39;s roles change
         

A major theme in the first two seasons of Big Little Lies was how the trauma someone faces in their youth impacts them when they are older. This was seen in Jane as she was consumed by her rapist and finally getting revenge on him, as well as with Bonnie in Big Little Lies season 2 and how her strange upbringing changed her. The seeds of this also appeared in the children’s storylines in Big Little Lies with Max bullying Amabella after hearing his father abuse her mother. How the parents&#39; actions affected their children could make for a compelling story in Big Little Lies season 3.




The adults weren’t the only ones with secrets and lies in Big Little Lies seasons 1 and 2, and season 3 could see the children replacing the Monterey Five as the main characters. The children all go to school together and if another scandal were to rock their community with them at the center of it, Big Little Lies season 3 could focus on the younger cast. The Monterey Five would remain involved in the story but likely kept in the dark, creating an added sense of mystery to the season.



 Season 3 Could Recapture The Excitement Of Season 1 With A Perspective Change 
Big Little Lies season 1 was a murder mystery
          

A big reason for the success of Big Little Lies season 1 was the mystery element. The season started with the viewers knowing the women had a shared secret, but what they were lying about and why wasn’t revealed until the finale. There were some subtle clues about the Big Little Lies twist ending that allowed viewers to make their own theories and try to piece everything together, bringing them back each week to discover more. This was sadly missing in Big Little Lies season 2 as the drama instead revolved around the custody battle between Celeste and new addition Mary Louise (Meryl Streep).




A perspective change and new mystery could bring back what made Big Little Lies season 1 so special while remaining fresh for audiences. Big Little Lies season 3 should follow the same formula as season 1, with the delay helping it feel as revolutionary as it did when it first premiered. In simply changing the focus to the younger cast, Big Little Lies season 3 would already be on the right track to creating something original while keeping to what drew audiences to it in the first place.
