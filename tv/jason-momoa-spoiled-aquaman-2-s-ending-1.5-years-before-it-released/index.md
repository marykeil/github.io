## Literature Review

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom packed some twists and turns; however, Jason Momoa secretly revealed the DCEU film&#39;s ending one year and a half ago.




It turns out that Jason Momoa spoiled Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending a year and a half before the final movie in the DCEU was released. Following the success of 2018&#39;s Aquaman, which continues to stand tall as the leader of the DCEU movies at the box office with a $1.1 billion worldwide total, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s story expanded on Arthur Curry&#39;s underwater realm. The movie featured Yahya Abdul-Mateen II&#39;s Black Manta as a bigger threat due to his connection to the ominous Black Trident.




Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s cast included Pilou Asbæk as King Kordax, one of the movie&#39;s most important characters. Kordax is none other than the brother of the great King Atlan, who was imprisoned by his powerful brother after he corrupted the lost kingdom in the movie&#39;s title, Necrus, transforming its citizens into mindless beings and waging war on Atlan. After Aquaman managed to stop Kordax from coming back to life, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending moved on to a major reveal, but it turns out that Momoa actually spoiled the scene a year and a half prior.

                  Critics &amp; Audiences Only Agree On 1 Of The 16 DCEU Movies Now That The Franchise Is Over   Now that the DCEU has ended after ten years, there is only one movie in the entire cinematic universe that critics and the audience agree on.   


 Jason Momoa Teased Aquaman 2&#39;s UN Scene Ending In 2022 
          




In August 2022, Momoa revealed a few Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom story details related to climate change. Speaking to British GQ, Momoa said, “Aquaman is the most made-fun-of superhero in the world. But it’s amazing to be able to bring awareness of what is happening to our planet. It’s not some story that’s been told over and over, [it’s a] movie about what’s happening right now but in a fantasy world.&#34; While that spoke to the general story of the Aquaman sequel, Momoa teased Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending a year and a half before the movie.

The magazine interview also confirmed that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom featured &#34;a scene in which Aquaman’s alter-ego Arthur Curry gives a grand speech to the UN warning them of the disaster looming on the horizon.&#34; The speech to the UN happened at the end of the DCEU&#39;s final movie, with Arthur Curry revealing Atlantis to the human world and ending his passionate speech about protecting the oceans by making an Iron Man reference, saying, &#34;I am Aquaman.&#34;






 Why Aquaman 2&#39;s UN Scene May Have Not Always Been Its Ending 
          

There is a chance that when the Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom ending was revealed in the interview, the UN scene was not yet set to end the film. Director James Wan has talked about how the movie went through changes due to the new DC Universe, which included scenes with two Batman actors — Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton — getting cut. Recently, Dolph Lundgren also spoke about Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s original cut, once again commenting on the movie&#39;s reshoots. The early reveal of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending might have been the fruit of the movie&#39;s changes.
