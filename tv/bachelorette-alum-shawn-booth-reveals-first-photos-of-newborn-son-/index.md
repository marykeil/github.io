## Literature Review
The Bachelorette season 11 winner Shawn Booth welcomed his first baby, a son with Audrey &#34;Dre&#34; Joseph, this past week. See the sweet first photos! 




The Bachelorette alum Shawn Booth introduced his brand new baby with Audrey “Dre” Joseph, revealing their bundle of joy after documenting Dre’s pregnancy on social media. After appearing on The Bachelorette season 11 with Kaitlyn Bristowe, Shawn has become a huge part of Bachelor Nation. Despite winding up engaged to Kaitlyn after The Bachelorette season 11, Shawn’s relationship with the Bachelor Nation favorite hit a snag after several years together, and the pair chose to separate amicably. Shawn, who resides in Nashville, Tennessee, busied himself with his work at his personal training gym, Booth Camp, and eventually started his own podcast, In The Booth, keeping his dating life private.




Shawn and Dre shared photos of their new baby boy on Instagram. “HE was born on 12/12 @ 13:13 and is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to us,” Shawn shared, along with several photos of their son. Both in the hospital and at home, Shawn, Dre, and their dogs have been getting used to the new person in their lives.


 

Bachelor Nation came out in full force to congratulate Shawn and Dre on their new arrival, commenting on the post excitedly. “Congratulations!” Bachelorette and Bachelor In Paradise alum Jared Haibon shared, “He’s beautiful!”

 Shawn Reveals The Name Of His Baby Boy 
          

While Shawn and Dre were excited about the pregnancy, they chose to keep the details private and decided to leave themselves in the dark about the baby’s gender. Upon announcing his birth to the world, it was finally revealed that Shawn and Dre welcomed a son. After months of curiosity, Shawn revealed that their baby boy’s name was Locks Joseph Booth. Both Shawn and Dre have taken to using the lock emoji in their posts over the last several days, happily sharing photos of their son with the world.


 

In early 2023 Shawn announced he was having a baby with Dre, who he introduced on his podcast. While they were quiet about their relationship status, the pair shared they would be co-parenting their baby, and appear to be living together. While the pregnancy was shocking to fans, it was equally shocking to Shawn and Dre, who weren’t planning to try for a baby. Despite the surprise, both were excited to be moving into a new chapter of their lives together. The pair documented the pregnancy on Instagram, sharing milestones and preparations until welcoming their son, Locks, in December 2023.




While Shawn and Dre seem to be incredibly private about their lives together and will likely not be sharing much about their son in the future, revealing their baby’s name to their fans was exciting for Bachelor Nation. Though Shawn hasn’t been a part of the series for years, knowing he developed a strong fan base that has kept up with him long after the experience is heartwarming. As Shawn and Dre move through their chapter of new parenthood, it will be interesting to see what they choose to share and what The Bachelorette winner chooses to keep private.
