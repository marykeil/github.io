## Literature Review

The Traitors US welcomed Deontay Wilder, John Bercow, and Kevin Kreider into the reality TV competition world, and they talked to us about the series.




The Traitors US season 2’s cast welcomed a group of reality stars and entertainment personalities, including Deontay Wilder, Kevin Kreider, and John Bercow, who chatted with Screen Rant about their time on the series. While Kevin has been a part of Bling Empire in the past, his experiences are primarily of an actor with scripted content, while Deontay and John come from vastly different backgrounds from the rest of the cast. As a former heavyweight champion boxer, Deontay’s background would lead to some presumptions that couldn’t be further from the truth. John, alternately, is a former UK parliament member who has tremendous communication skills, which isn’t exactly a surprise.




Coming into The Traitors US season 2 without reality TV competition experience, the cast members were working against some of the best in the business as they did their best to try and figure out who the traitors on the series were. With reality TV titans like Big Brother’s Janelle Pierzina, Survivor’s Sandra Diaz-Twine, and The Challenge’s Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio working to identify the Traitors alongside them, Deontay, John, and Kevin brought fresh perspectives into the mix. Though they looked suspicious at times for their lack of experience, they often made up for their suspicious behavior in due time.

With Kevin, John, and Deontay all being named faithful during the initial traitor selection, the group was immediately working to try and identify who was hiding among them. While Kevin and John quickly had suspicion put on them, Deontay was able to get off relatively easily for the first several episodes of the season. Despite pointing the finger at the incorrect Faithfuls, the group was still doing their best to try and identify the Traitors among them. As The Traitors US season 2 continues, John, Kevin, and Deontay will hopefully keep bringing some of the more entertaining, engaging moments of the season.




Screen Rant: Thanks so much for chatting with me today! To get us started, all of you come from such a wide range of backgrounds, I’d love to know what was the one thing you were able to take from your past experiences and use to your advantage in this game.


Kevin Kreider: None.
Deontay Wilder: [laughs] Exactly! I was going to say, exactly.
Kevin Kreider: None, everything you know – throw it out the window. None. There was nothing that could prepare you for this experience.
Deontay Wilder: Yeah, I agree with Kevin 100% – there’s nothing for me in my past experiences and my background coming in, there’s nothing.
John Bercow: I largely agree – nothing prepares you properly, let’s put it that way. It’s completely different from anything I’ve done, and I knew I would be bad at the missions because I’m old and a bit feeble, but one thing I think helped, I think it helped that I’m comfortable communicating. It’s much more difficult to sus people out on this stage than it is when you’re dealing with people in the political bear pit that you’ve known for years.
So you know who the goodies and who the baddies are, this lot…they’re very sophisticated players, so basically I think Kevin and Deontay are right: nothing prepares you. But it’s the excitement of the unknown that was attractive about taking part! I thought this was something completely different, and I love America and I knew I was going to be on with a lot of Americans. Now look at me, I get to go on with a storyteller and a boxer.





Screen Rant: Alright, so if nothing is able to prepare you for this game – what was the most unexpectedly difficult part of this game for you?


Deontay Wilder: For me, it’s just the connection with so many people. I’m a people’s person, a lot of people don’t know that or would assume that because of what I do. I’m a people’s person and I love people. I’m the type of person that feels we’re all part of the human race, we all need each other. That was the most exciting part of just going on to meet so many different people from so many different worlds, and getting to know some of them personally – that was a good experience for me.
Kevin Kreider: I think the hardest part was just the intensity of everything, it was just very fast-paced. I’ve never experienced something like that in my life, I come from scripted and unscripted [content] and this competition, which comes at a much faster pace. You know, long days of missions, round tables, having to emotionally be on point at all times – and if you’re ever very tired, like me, and kind of lose a little bit of mental sharpness, you’re off your game. Which I think is done very masterfully in this, because I think that adds a lot of excitement and chaos to this because we’re not on our top mental game, so there’s a lot of mistakes being made.
John Bercow: I agree with Kevin, I think that’s a shrewd insight because I think it hit me that way. Also, I would say the most difficult thing, the thing I hadn’t anticipated that struck me was that you don’t have the luxury of reflecting at your leisure. To put it more simply, you don’t have time – you just don’t have much time. I can reach judgments about people when I’ve got the chance to reflect and perhaps take the chance to talk to others, and even spend weeks or months formulating a view about a colleague or a competitor – here, there’s none of that.
You’ve got to do it then and there, and when you’re in reality, people are asking what do you think? What do you think, and what do you think? You’ve got to reach quick judgments, and you reach quick judgments and we got some of them wrong. But, on the other hand – that’s part of the game, and it’s fun. I think our errors are as interesting to people as our successes, our failures are as interesting as our successes.





Screen Rant: I can confirm that’s definitely true! It’s fascinating to watch regardless of the turnout. Last question for you all – if you could come into this experience fresh, would you rather play as a traitor or a faithful?


Kevin Kreider: Oooooh…
John Bercow: I can start this one – I would choose again to be a faithful, and I would try to do it better. I may not have been a very good faithful, I hope I did okay, but I would be absolutely awful, awful, awful as a traitor. So I’d do the same again, but I’d try to do it better. I think that’s not a bad motto for life – try to fail better each day.


Screen Rant: Some incredible life advice! Deontay?


Deontay Wilder: For me, if I could do it over again I would definitely be a traitor, for sure. I think my background, my space of where I come from it fits me better, because in my profession, that’s what you have. You get a lot of traitors in my profession, so I’m used that world, I think I work better with smaller numbers than larger numbers, as well. That’s another reason I think I would be better as a traitor.





Screen Rant: It’s easier to work in those smaller groups in a lot of ways. Finally, Kevin?


Kevin Kreider: Yeah, I think I would go back in as a traitor because breakfast would be a lot more calm for me [laughs]. You’d get a lot more screen time, too – the show’s named after you, basically. It’s not called The Faithful, so I’d pick a traitor as well.




New episodes of The Traitors US are available to stream on Peacock every Thursday.
