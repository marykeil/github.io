<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Cad Bane and Asajj Ventress are some of the most dangerous bounty hunters ever, and these quotes prove that they&rsquo;ll be a huge threat to the Bad Batch.</p>
<p>Clone Force 99 will have their hands full in Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3, as the Empire will send bounty hunters after them, and Cad Bane and Asajj Ventress might be the biggest threats they&rsquo;ll face, as evidenced by their most intimidating quotes. The Bad Batch will launch a new mission to rescue Omega from Dr. Hemlock and the Imperials, but they&rsquo;ll face more opposition than ever before in trying. Emperor Palpatine has taken an interest in them and Omega, and he will send some of the most dangerous people in the galaxy after them.
Bane and Ventress could be the biggest problems Clone Force 99 will have to face in The Bad Batch season 3. They&rsquo;re both highly skilled bounty hunters at the absolute top of the game, and even the Bad Batch would have a tough time going against them. Even though Clone Force 99 has a wide range of powers and abilities, taking down the bounty hunters on their own would be nearly impossible, but with all the other threats from the Empire stacked on top, the hunters could be the end of the Bad Batch. Their top quotes prove just how ruthless they can be, and how challenging it will be to go against them.</p>
<p>How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order<br>
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.</p>
<p>10 “I’m In Control, I Make The Rules Now”
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 1 Episode 22</p>
<p>Cad Bane made a memorable debut to the galaxy in Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 1, episode 22. In the first job he ever pulled on screen, Bane took control of the Galactic Senate building and took a group of Senators hostage. He then threatened Chancellor Palpatine into releasing Ziro the Hutt, a crime lord in the Hutt Syndicate, and delivered this famous line after cutting power to the building. It was an intricate plan, but Bane and his crew pulled it off perfectly and bested Anakin Skywalker in the process, proving just how efficient the bounty hunter was.</p>
<p>9 &ldquo;No, You Have No Idea Who You Are Talking To&rdquo;
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 4 Episode 20</p>
<p>Asajj Ventress wasn&rsquo;t always a bounty hunter, but her first venture into the profession proved to be quite eventful. She teamed up with Boba Fett&rsquo;s group of bounty hunters in The Clone Wars season 4, episode 20 to help them protect and deliver a package. Unknown to Ventress, the package was actually a woman who was going to be forced into marrying the ruler of the planet Quarzite. Ventress turned on Boba in the end, and delivered this intimidating line while revealing her power with the dark side of the Force by choking the young bounty hunter.</p>
<p>8 “The Separatists Are Paying A Million Credits A Head For A Jedi&quot;
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 3 Episode 9</p>
<p>Bane may have been an expert strategist, but he could also think on his feet. He had a chance to prove his improvisation skills in The Clone Wars season 3, episode 9, as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Quinlan Vos found him while tracking Ziro the Hutt. Bane delivered this sinister line when he realized the Jedi wouldn&rsquo;t let him go easily, and that he could make a profit out of their fight. During the battle, Bane disarmed and incapacitated both Jedi long enough to make his escape unharmed. His line proves that he wasn&rsquo;t just quick with a blaster, he was also quick with his head.</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Bad Batch Voice Cast - What The Actors Look Like In Real Life<br>
Star Wars: The Bad Batch has quite an interesting cast of actors that features multiple Star Wars veterans, as well as a few newcomers.</p>
<p>7 &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Think That Will Be Happening, Will It Savage?&rdquo;
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 3 Episode 14</p>
<p>Ventress began as Count Dooku&rsquo;s apprentice, but her master turned on her and left her for dead. Ventress didn&rsquo;t take that betrayal lying down, though, and hatched a plot for revenge against the Sith Lord. Using her connection to the Nightsisters of Dathomir, Ventress created Savage Opress, a perfect candidate to become Dooku&rsquo;s new apprentice. Savage was loyal to Ventress though, and she sprung her trap on Dooku after he had accepted his new apprentice. This line revealed her careful plot and showed that Ventress had a keen mind for planning and secrecy, as well as a good sense of dramatic timing.</p>
<p>6 “&hellip;It&rsquo;s A Horrible Way To Die”
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 2 Episode 2</p>
<p>Bane had several notorious heists throughout his career, and one of the more daring was to steal a holocron containing a list of Force-sensistive children for Darth Sidious from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. After he got the holocron, he was pursued by Ahsoka Tano and Anakin Skywalker, but he had a plan for them, too. He captured Ahsoka and used her to force Anakin into opening the holocron for him by threatening to open the airlock and send his Padawan into the vacuum of space. Bane&rsquo;s quote is a very thinly-veiled threat that got one of the most powerful Jedi of all time to do whatever Bane wanted.</p>
<p>Clone Wars Timeline Explained: When Each Season Takes Place (Including The Bad Batch)<br>
All seven non-chronological seasons of The Clone Wars take place within a three-year period, but where does one year end and the next begin?</p>
<p>5 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Not Much Of A Talker&rdquo;
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 4 Episode 20</p>
<p>Though Ventress left the Sith, she didn&rsquo;t leave her bad behavior behind entirely. When she began her career as a Jedi, she went to a cantina on Tatooine, where one of the patrons hit on her. She rewarded his forwardness with a lightsaber to the stomach, killing him in front of the whole bar. The only explanation she gave was this quote, which let the rest of the patrons know that she was not someone who should be trifled with. It also showed that Ventress would not take any abuse lightly, and had no problem defending herself with deadly force.</p>
<p>4 “Cad Bane, At Your Service. I’ll Take On Any Job, For The Right Price”
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 3 Episode 8</p>
<p>Bane was a business person first and a bounty hunter second. He let all of his potential employers, even the Hutt Syndicate, know that his services, while expert, were also extremely pricey. This quote shows that Bane&rsquo;s focus was always on credits, and his devotion to business made him extremely pricey. Bane had no morals whatsoever, and would hunt down anyone, anywhere if the price was right. Even the danger of the job didn&rsquo;t matter as much as the payout, as the job he agreed to with this quote pitted him against the Senate Guard and several Jedi.</p>
<p>3 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gonna Get My Money Whether You&rsquo;re Dead Or Alive&rdquo;
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Season 5 Episode 19</p>
<p>Ventress never failed to take an opportunity to make some easy money during her time as a bounty hunter. In The Clone Wars season 5, episode 19, she had a chance to capture and turn in Ahsoka Tano, who had been framed for murder. While Ventress ultimately empathized with Ahsoka and decided to help her prove her innocence, this quote demonstrated the attitude she usually had with her bounties. She took the phrase &ldquo;dead or alive&rdquo; seriously, and the state of her prey didn&rsquo;t matter to her as long as she got her credits.</p>
<p>2 “I’ve Taken Down So Many Clones Over The Years…”
Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 1 Episode 8</p>
<p>Bane&rsquo;s most intimidating line, and the one that proves how big of a threat he&rsquo;ll be in The Bad Batch season 3, was directed at Hunter. Bane was hired to capture Omega and return her to the Kaminoans, and he forced Hunter into dueling him. The second half of his quote claims that Bane had a good strategy for killing clones, as he said, &ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve figured out one, the rest are easy.&rdquo; While Clone Force 99 is no ordinary group of clones, Bane had more than enough experience in gunfights to pose a huge threat to them. He also had very little respect for them as an enemy, and his confidence could be well-founded.
The first three episodes of Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3 will premiere on Disney+ on February 21.</p>
<p>1 &ldquo;I Wasn&rsquo;t Planning On Killing You, But You&rsquo;re Making It Very Tempting&rdquo;
Star Wars: The Bad Batch Season 3 Trailer</p>
<p>Ventress is a new threat to the Bad Batch, but she has already proven that her newcomer status shouldn&rsquo;t be used to underestimate her. Not much is known about what role Ventress will play in The Bad Batch season 3, but she will definitely have a huge impact on the story. Anyone who dares to fight her will have a difficult battle on their hands, as this quote proves that Ventress has little patience and more than enough experience with killing. Ventress&rsquo; return has been a long time coming, and her next appearance in The Bad Batch will give viewers plenty of time to see her fight.
Clone Force 99 is in for a lot of trouble in Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3. Emperor Palpatine is turning up the heat on them, and with the full weight of the Empire after them, along with a host of bounty hunters, the end of the Bad Batch seems imminent. Cad Bane and Asajj Ventress could be above and beyond their other threats, though, and they have a few quotes that prove how dangerous they are. How the Bad Batch will meet their end remains to be seen, but Bane and Ventress will certainly play important roles.</p>
