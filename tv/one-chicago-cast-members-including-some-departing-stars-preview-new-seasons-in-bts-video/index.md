## Literature Review
One Chicago cast members, including some starts of the franchise that will be departing, preview their new seasons in a behind-the-scenes video.




The One Chicago universe&#39;s newest seasons have been teased by cast members - including some stars who are leaving - in a new behind-the-scenes promotional video. Because of the writers and actors strikes in Hollywood, the procedural dramas in the ongoing franchise weren&#39;t able to premiere within their usual time in September. Now, Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., and Chicago Med are all set to return next week.




In commemoration of the franchise&#39;s return, One Chicago released a promotional behind-the-scenes video teasing what&#39;s next for the franchise.


 

The video included multiple cast members across all three shows, including departing actors like Kara Killmer, who portrays Sylvie Brett on Chicago Fire. Alongside cast interviews, the video shows previews of the new seasons, teasing plenty of drama and action to come.


 What To Expect From One Chicago In 2024 
          

Alongside Killmer, three other stars within the universe will be saying their farewells in the upcoming seasons. This includes Nick Gehlfuss as Will Halstead, who won&#39;t be returning for Chicago Med season 9, and Tracy Spiridakos, who plays Hailey Upton on Chicago P.D. The most shocking news comes in the form of Alberto Rosende&#39;s departure as Blake Gallo, who will leave Chicago Fire season 12 in its first episode.




Beyond the key actors who are leaving the series, the promotional video indicates the new seasons of the franchise will be more exciting than ever before. There will likely be resolutions for major ongoing storylines, such as Chicago P.D. season 10&#39;s ending keeping Ruzek&#39;s fate a mystery after getting shot. The consequences of different actors leaving the series may also influence additional engaging plots.

One upside to the next chapter in the Chicago One universe is the return of Taylor Kinney as Kelly Severide in Chicago Fire. His full-time return to the universe could be celebrated in other shows, especially given just how many characters are going to be departing from the franchise. With plenty of action to be seen and cliffhangers to be resolved, it appears even the number of characters leaving won&#39;t detract from the show&#39;s upcoming return.



All three shows in the One Chicago universe - Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., and Chicago Med, will return on NBC on Wednesday, January 17 at 8 p.m. ET.
