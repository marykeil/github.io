## Literature Review

Tell Me Lies season 2 gets a major production update along with a reunion photo featuring star Grace Van Patten and two important co-stars.




Tell Me Lies season 2 is kicking off production. The show, which is based on the 2018 Carola Lovering novel of the same name, follows the romance between Lucy Albright (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen DeMarco (Jackson White) over the course of eight years as they go from starry-eyed college lovers to something much darker. Season 1 of the show ran on Hulu from September 7 through October 26, 2022, and though it was renewed for season 2 that November, no word on a production start came throughout the entirety of 2023.




Now, the official Tell Me Lies Instagram account has posted two reunion photos of lead trio Van Patten, Catherine Missal (Bree), and Sonia Mena (Pippa). Check it out below:


 

The caption announces that &#34;the puswas are back.&#34; In addition to showcasing their reunion, the post reveals that Tell Me Lies season 2 has officially commenced production.


 When Will Tell Me Lies Season 2 Premiere? 
          

The question still remains as to when season 2 will premiere on Hulu. Although the commencement of production is a big step, the wait following the Tell Me Lies season 1 finale in 2022 will continue to get longer for the time being. It could very well take several months for production to conclude, at which point post-production will need to take place before the show is ready to air.






Post-production duties for a movie or TV show include editing, sound mixing, color correction, and visual effects.




The period between production wrap and a streaming show&#39;s season premiere can frequently take more than half a year. However, Tell Me Lies has several elements working in its favor. The first is the fact that, unlike similar Netflix shows, the drama airs on a weekly schedule rather than premiering an entire season at once. This means that the later episodes don&#39;t need to be completely out of post-production by the time the season premieres, giving them some extra leeway.

The show also doesn&#39;t feature major visual effects, meaning that it will require less post-production than an effects-heavy streaming show like The Mandalorian or The Last Of Us. Tell Me Lies has also set a precedent for a swift turnaround. Season 1 began filming in February 2022 and premiered seven months later, meaning that season 2 could premiere by August 2024 if it follows a similar timeline.
