## Literature Review

Netflix&#39;s rom-com TV show XO, Kitty includes several significant romances, but some couples have more strength and potential than others.




As a rom-com series, the plot of Netflix’s XO, Kitty includes multiple interesting romances, but not every relationship is as good as the rest. Set two years after the conclusion of the To All The Boys movies, the series XO, Kitty follows the experiences of Kitty Song Covey as she studies at the Korean Independent School of Seoul (KISS), the school where her mother previously went and her boyfriend presently goes.
XO, Kitty heavily features Kitty learning about her mother, but the series also revolves around romance. The titular main character sets off on this journey in a relationship with Dae, but she finds herself involved in multiple potential romances. The self-proclaimed matchmaker also has a hand in helping others find love. Plus, the series starts out with multiple other established relationships. Ultimately, with so many romances featured in XO, Kitty, not every pairing has the same strength and potential.
            
 
 10 Ways Netflix Changes To All The Boys With Their Show XO, Kitty 
Five years after the first To All The Boys I&#39;ve Loved Before film hit Netflix, its spinoff series XO, Kitty has premiered with many differences.












 








 9  Jina And Mr. Han 
The Hans Have An Unhappy, Unhealthy Marriage
        

Mr. Han is constantly mean to his family, not seeming to care about the way he treats his wife, Jina. He decides to leave his wife alone on Chusoek, an important Korean holiday meant to be spent with family. When Jina shares that she has a son, he yells at her to pay her son off and make him go away. Later, he even calls her son a problem. She finally has the strength to confront him about how unhappy she is, and he calls her spoiled. All things considered, these two are the worst romantic couple in XO, Kitty.





 8  Jina And Daniel 
The Relationship Between These Former Lovers Is Underdeveloped
        

Jina and Daniel, aka Mr. Lee, get almost no time together, and their former romance isn’t even revealed until halfway through XO, Kitty. The only thing she tells Kitty about their relationship is that he was her first love and has good taste in music. The two don’t even get a meaningful scene together in the series. While their romance isn’t good as it is, XO, Kitty season 2 has the potential to rectify this problem.





 7  Kitty And Min Ho 
This Popular Romance Is Actually Problematic
        

Of all Kitty’s possible romances from XO, Kitty season 1, the least healthy is her relationship with Min-ho. Kitty and Min Ho start out as adversaries and stay that way throughout most of the series. He verbally harasses her, calls her names, and treats her terribly. He furthers the idea that she’s a stalker, making her an outcast at school. They finally start to bond on Chuseok when they cook together. Then, at the end of XO, Kitty season 1, he admits that he loves her.
While this is a fan-favorite ship, the romance between Kitty and Min Ho perpetuates dangerous ideas about romance. Min Ho is the proverbial boy pulling on the girl’s pigtails, an action that’s societally accepted as a sign he likes her. However, this idea teaches people that violence from a boy is romantic. The way Min Ho treats her isn’t romantic. He doesn’t get a pass for treating Kitty horribly just because he is nice to her a couple of times. Because of this, Kitty and Min-ho’s relationship in XO, Kitty season 1 ranks as one of the worst romances.

XO, Kitty introduced a romance between Kitty and Dae like Lara Jean and Peter&#39;s in To All the Boys, but which sister had the better relationship?








 6  Juliana And Yuri 
These Star-Crossed Lovers Get Very Little Time In XO, Kitty
        

During XO, Kitty, it’s established that Yuri and her best friend Juliana are in love and hiding their relationship because of their parents. They get split up after the housekeeper catches them together. There was potential for these two to have a cute romance. Unfortunately, they only get three scenes together, and one is over the phone. There’s nothing wrong with them as a couple, but the show doesn’t offer enough to like them as a couple, either. Hopefully, that will change in XO, Kitty season 2 with the return of Juliana.





 5  Madison And Min Ho 
This Fling Is Surprisingly Healthy For Teenagers
        

During the middle of XO, Kitty season 1, Madison and Min Ho have a fling. Rather than having different expectations, they both agree they won’t be serious from the start. They have good chemistry and spend a lot of time making out. When Min Ho decides he wants something else, they have a mature breakup. They prove that not every relationship needs to be serious to be valuable. The only reason they place lower among the couples is that they never seemed to have much in common. Their connection was very face value, rather than having shared interests.





 4  Kitty And Dae 
Kitty And Dae Are Each Other&#39;s First Loves


 







In XO, Kitty, the titular character goes to KISS to surprise Dae but learns that he’s in a relationship – albeit a fake one. Throughout the rest of the series, they go back and forth between having romantic moments and fighting. They have many sweet moments, including him kissing her after detention and setting up a date on their camping trip. Unfortunately, they cannot communicate, always assuming the wrong thing. This makes it frustrating to emotionally invest in their relationship. So many of their issues could be solved if they just talked to each other.
Ultimately, it’s good that they broke up during the ending of XO, Kitty season 1. They’ll undoubtedly still have a connection and appreciation for one another because they were each other’s first loves. Still, they need time apart to grow and learn more about themselves. If they’re truly meant to be together in the future, they’ll find their way back to each other.
Kitty and Dae first meet when the Song Coveys are visiting Seoul at the start of To All The Boys: Always and Forever.







 3  Q And Florian 
Q and Florian Are The Most Consistent Relationship in XO, Kitty
        

Early in XO, Kitty, the perky teenager uses her matchmaking skills to get Q together with his crush Florian. The two develop a strong relationship with relatively little drama. They support one another constantly. While their communication could be better, they offer each other patience and understanding when things aren’t perfect. They’re the perfect example of a relationship that doesn’t need chaos to be romantic.
Unfortunately, their relationship is thrown into question at the end of XO, Kitty when Florian reveals to Q that he’s cheating on tests. This moment shows a fundamental difference in core values that is concerning for the couple. What’s more, Florian doesn’t seem to care that he caused Q’s best friend to lose his class ranking. This moment of selfishness puts Q in a really difficult position, and Florian doesn’t even attempt to empathize. The status of Q and Florian’s relationship after this conflict is one of the many questions XO, Kitty season 2 must answer.

 2  Trina And Daniel 
Kitty&#39;s Setup Created A Happy Marriage For Trina And Daniel
        

While they don’t get a ton of screen time, one of the best romances in XO, Kitty is Trina and Daniel. The two started out in To All The Boy: P.S. I Still Love You, and XO, Kitty shows how they’ve developed as a married couple. The pair have clear communication, actively listening to one another when they talk about sending Kitty to KISS. When Daniel is later awoken by Kitty’s call, he wakes up Trina when he thinks something’s wrong, indicating that they rely on each other for support. Ultimately, they have an extremely happy, healthy relationship.





 1  Yuri And Kitty 
Yuri Is Kitty&#39;s Best Potential Romance In XO, Kitty


 







The best romance in XO, Kitty season 1 is that of Yuri and Kitty. The foundation of their romance is built early in the season. Even when these two are enemies, they stick up for each other at Min Ho’s party. They soon develop a heartwarming friendship that allows them to open up to one another. Yuri trusts Kitty enough to tell her about her dysfunctional family and her sexuality, an extremely daunting decision for someone in Yuri’s position. Kitty also tells Yuri that their moms knew each other.
They start putting each other&#39;s desires ahead of their own, with Yuri helping Kitty and Dae get back together and Kitty helping Yuri get in contact with Julianna. Sparks start to fly as they develop a deeper connection. Even when she’s with Dae, Kitty can’t stop thinking about Yuri. Yuri turns to Kitty when she leaves home. The pair finally have a romantic moment when they’re dancing but get interrupted when Kitty leans in to kiss Yuri. Unfortunately, they don&#39;t get another moment to shine in season 1 and will need to be explored further in XO, Kitty season 2.
