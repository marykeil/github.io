This is the first time the series has won a prestigious award in Hollywood. This is a major achievement for Hajime Isayama&#39;s apocalyptic shonen series, as very few anime get the honor of being recognized in the biggest gathering of the entertainment industry&#39;s brightest. Past winners or nominees of the major awards such as the Oscars, Golden Globes, and Emmy are few and far between, such as Spirited Away, Afro Samurai, Suzume, Inu Oh, Mirai, and most recently The Boy and the Heron.

Attack On Titan ended in 2023 after more than 10 years of excellence. Establishing itself as one of the best anime of all time, this masterpiece of a series has always been popular all over the world. Telling the gripping story of the young Eren, it masterfully depicts real-life themes and stays grounded in reality, while also establishing itself as one of the best dark fantasy anime available. From the out-of-this-world animation to the story that always keeps audiences guessing, Attack On Titan is one of the best series that the anime industry has to offer, and is proof that the medium deserves much more recognition.




                  Attack on Titan Complete Series Review: One of the Greatest Anime Ever Made   Attack on Titan is an incredible series that ended on a high point, firmly establishing the series as one of the greatest anime ever made.    

Despite being a global phenomenon, anime has not been well represented in Hollywood, but that is slowly changing. Giant studios like Netflix have been heavily investing in the medium, funding many new anime and placing them on their platforms that have millions of subscribers. It&#39;s only a matter of time before anime nominations for major awards become a regular occurrence, and Attack On Titan will be remembered as one of the series that paved the way for this to happen.
