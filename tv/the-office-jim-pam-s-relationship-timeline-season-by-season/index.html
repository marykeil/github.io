  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Jim and Pam had a great love story on The Office. They may have started off as friends, but fans were delighted to see them eventually tie the knot.</p>
<p>From the moment the characters shared the screen fans of The Office were wondering when Jim and Pam would get together, but the moment took several seasons to arrive. Pam and Jim saw their relationship taken in a lot of different directions throughout, with many teases and near-misses before they finally got together. There are plenty of key episodes in Jim and Pam&rsquo;s relationship timeline throughout The Office where the two almost finally found each-other, which makes pinpointing the exact moment it happened tricky in retrospect without giving the entire show yet another watch through.
From the first episode right until The Office&rsquo;s ending, the relationship between Jim and Pam was always at the center of the series. In many ways, it was the show&rsquo;s heart and showed the kind of beautiful things that can spring out of even the most mundane workplace setting. The ups and downs of their romance made for some great must-watch television and cemented them as one of the great sitcom couples of all time. Looking back at the milestones in the timeline of Jim and Pam on The Office shows why they worked so well.

<p>The Office: How Old Jim &amp; Pam Are At The Beginning &amp; End Of The Show
Jim and Pam were two of the younger starring characters in The Office. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of their ages during major moments in the series.</p>
<p>Season 1 Lays The Foundations For Jim And Pam&rsquo;s Relationship
Best Friends With Unspoken Feelings</p>
<p>Season 1, Episode 2: Pam rests her head on Jim&rsquo;s shoulder
Season 1, Episode 6: Jim asks Katy out</p>
<p>Season 1 of The Office only had six episodes as an introduction to the series to see if NBC would pick it up. Luckily for the cast, crew, and viewers, it was a hit. In the pilot, viewers learn that Jim and Pam are close friends and each other&rsquo;s allies in the office. However, it&rsquo;s suddenly revealed that Pam is engaged to a man named Roy, who worked in Dunder Mifflin&rsquo;s warehouse. This cemented them as the classic sitcom will-they-won&rsquo;t-they couple.
Most of the first season found Jim pining after Pam while being tortured by the fact that she was with someone else. There were still sweet moments between the two, such as in &ldquo;Diversity Day&rdquo; when Jim loses a huge sale yet when Pam falls asleep on his shoulder, it causes him to conclude it was a pretty good day. However, the season finale finds Jim trying to move on from Pam and deciding to ask out Katy, The Office guest star Amy Adams.</p>
<p>Jim And Pam Reveal Their Feelings In Season 2
A Fun Night At The Dundies Changes Everything</p>
<p>Season 2, Episode 1: Pam kisses Jim for the first time
Season 2, Episode 7: Jim and Pam have their first &ldquo;date&rdquo;
Season 2, Episode 10: Jim writes Pam a note
Season 2, Episode 22: Jim tells Pam he loves her and kisses her</p>
<p>By season 2, fans got to see more of Jim and Pam&rsquo;s relationship moving closer toward them becoming an actual couple. In the opening episode of the season, Jim and Pam are each other&rsquo;s buddies at The Office&rsquo;s first Dundies. Since Pam was arguing with Roy at the time, she just wanted to spend the night hanging out with her friends. After joking around the entire night, Jim and Pam accidentally kissed but brushed it off as if nothing happened.
Their relationship continued to border on flirtatious, as in &ldquo;The Client&rdquo; with Jim and Pam sharing a pseudo date night when everyone works late at the office. As the season went on, it became increasingly clear that Jim couldn&rsquo;t hide his feelings much longer. In &ldquo;Christmas Party,&rdquo; he wrote a note to Pam as part of her present which explained his feelings for her, but ultimately decided not to give it to her.
By the time &ldquo;Casino Night&rdquo; rolled around, Jim and Pam continued to grow closer. Unable to hold it in anymore, he told her he loved her, and Jim and Pam shared their first official kiss. Pam, however, refused to end things with Roy and Jim moved on.</p>
<p>The Office Cast &amp; Character Guide
The actors and writers of The Office are what made the series a continued sensation years later. Here&rsquo;s the full cast and character guide</p>
<p>Karen And Roy Stand Between Jim And Pam In Season 3
Distance Makes The Heart Grow Fonder</p>
<p>Season 3, Episode 5: Jim and Pam reconnect
Season 3, Episode 8: Jim returns&hellip; with Karen
Season 3, Episode 13: Jim admits he still has feelings for Pam
Season 3, Episode 18: Roy comes for revenge
Season 3, Episode 22: Pam shares her feelings
Season 3, Episode 23: Jim asks Pam out</p>
<p>When Pam couldn&rsquo;t reciprocate her feelings for Jim, he decided to transfer to the Dunder Mifflin Stamford branch for a fresh start. After not communicating for months, Jim and Pam accidentally reconnected over the phone one day and, despite a bit of awkwardness, found themselves back in their friendly rhythm. But while Jim was in Stamford, he began to have feelings for his coworker, Karen. That friendship turned into Jim&rsquo;s first significant relationship on The Office by the time the Stamford branch merged with Scranton.
Their dynamic was changed in season 3, with The Office reversing Jim and Pam&rsquo;s relationship as she was now the one left pining. Pam tried to work things out with Roy, but his angry reaction to learning she kissed Jim while they were together ended things for good and put the focus back on Jim and Pam as an item. In &ldquo;The Return,&rdquo; Jim admits to Karen that he still has feelings for Pam, but they try to get past that.
As Pam tries to gain more self-confidence, she eventually tells Jim (and the rest of the office) that she misses the connection they had. By the end of the season, Jim had an epiphany that it wasn&rsquo;t Karen he longed for — it was Pam. The season ended with him asking Pam out on a date.</p>
<p>Jim And Pam Are Officially A Couple From Season 4
Let The Romance Begin!</p>
<p>Season 4, Episode 1: The Jim and Pam relationship is a secret

Season 4, Episode 14: Jim&rsquo;s proposal is ruined</p>
<p>The question of when do Jim and Pam get together brings viewers to The Office season 4, which is the point they officially became a couple. At the start of season 4, Jim and Pam tried keeping their relationship under wraps but it eventually came out. They didn&rsquo;t want anyone involved in their love bubble. In &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; the two have their first getaway as a couple at Schrute Farms. By the time the dreaded night in &ldquo;Dinner Party,&rdquo; one of The Office&rsquo;s funniest episodes occurred, Jim and Pam were fully comfortable with one another.
Pam and Jim&rsquo;s relationship was fun, charming, and clearly moving towards a more serious future quite quickly. In &ldquo;Chair Model,&rdquo; Jim shows off the ring he plans to propose to Pam with. Unfortunately, those plans are temporarily delayed in &ldquo;Goodbye Toby&rdquo; as Jim has the plan all set up, only for Andy to swoop in first and propose to Angela in front of everyone, stealing the moment from Jim.</p>

Season 6, Episode 17: Jim and Pam&rsquo;s daughter is born</p>

It leads to the sweet decision for Jim and Pam to marry in secret under Niagra Falls, allowing the mayhem to take place without them. With the wedding out of the way, the focus turns to the baby and Jim and Pam welcome their first daughter Cecilia.</p>
<p>The Office: 10 Ways The Show Changed (For The Better) After Season 1
The Office may have a cult following, but the sitcom&rsquo;s premiere season was by far the weakest. Here&rsquo;s how the world of Dunder Mifflin improved.</p>
<p>Michael Leaving Changed Pam And Jim&rsquo;s Role In Season 7
A New Era At Dunder Mifflin</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 21: Michael leaves</p>
<p>Just like Pam and Jim, Michael found love for himself and chose to leave Dunder Mifflin for a new life in Colorado with Holly. Jim and Pam had been working for Michael for years, so for them, it felt like the end of an era as the man who introduced them to one another left their lives.
Steve Carrell leaving The Office also meant a big change in the cast, as much more emphasis was put on Jim and Pam now that the show&rsquo;s top-billed star was gone. In some ways, this marked a change in how fans saw Jim and Pam, with the storylines that followed proving to be hit-or-miss with many viewers.</p>
<p>Jim Shows How Strong His Feelings For Pam Are In Season 8
Baby #2 And A Threatening Storyline</p>
<p>Season 8, Episode 7: Pam gets insecure about Cathy
Season 8, Episode 13: Jim and Pam&rsquo;s son is introduced
Season 8, Episode 16: Cathy makes a move on Jim</p>
<p>The Office season 8 differed from season 7 in terms of the show&rsquo;s emphasis on the Jim and Pam relationship. Pam showed the cameras that she and Jim were having their second baby. However, it seemed like there was one new person in the office who could disrupt the flow of their happy relationship. Cathy was Pam&rsquo;s replacement while she was on maternity leave and Pam initially grew insecure about Jim potentially being attracted to the younger co-worker.
Though Jim maintained his commitment to Pam, it turns out she was not wrong about being somewhat concerned, as Cathy was revealed to be seeking out an affair with him. During a business trip to Florida, Cathy attempted to seduce Jim, only for him to repeatedly turn her down. After that, Cathy disappeared from The Office.</p>
<p>10 Facts Behind The Making Of The Office
Everyone loves the sitcom The Office, but not everyone knows these fascinating behind-the-scenes facts about the employees of Dunder Mifflin.</p>
<p>Season 9 Saw Pam And Jim Face A Final Hurdle
Trouble In Paradise Before A New Beginning</p>
<p>Season 9, Episode 3: Jim tells Pam about his new job
Season 9, Episode 12: Pam cries about her marriage
Season 9, Episode 16: Pam doesn&rsquo;t want to move to Philadelphia
Season 9, Episode 21: Jim turns down the job offer
Season 9, Episode 22: Jim shows his love for Pam
Season 9, Episode 23: Jim and Pam start a new life together</p>
<p>Season 9 of The Office was one of its most controversial, and having to endure Jim and Pam&rsquo;s relationship problems was likely a big reason. Jim accepted an opportunity to join a start-up with an old friend based in Philadelphia, which Pam was not on board with. This new long-distance aspect of their relationship took a toll on the couple throughout the final season. The two began to fight while he split his time between Scranton and Philadelphia; they even entertained therapy for a while. For the first time, Jim and Pam were not seen as the perfect couple.
Though it was uncomfortable to watch, including seeing Pam break down in tears in front of the documentary camera crew, it showed a rare side of a sitcom relationship that experienced realistic problems. Eventually, Jim saw the toll his job was taking on the relationship, returning to Scranton and reaffirming his love for Pam by giving her the note he wrote to her in season 2. With The Office finale taking place one year later, Pam reveals it is time to allow Jim to embrace his dream as the family moves to Texas, where he&rsquo;ll rejoin the company he helped build.</p>
