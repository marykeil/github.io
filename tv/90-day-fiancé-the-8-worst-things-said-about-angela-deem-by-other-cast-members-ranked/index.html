  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Angela Deem&rsquo;s controlling behavior and jealousy caused strain in her relationship with husband Michael, leading him to cheat on her.
Angela&rsquo;s weight loss surgery caused a rift between her and Michael, as he was unsupportive and concerned about her breast reduction surgery.
Angela&rsquo;s feuds extended to other cast members, including Usman and Yara, and her disrespectful behavior resulted in confrontations and strained relationships.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Angela Deem might be pure evil but she&rsquo;s received the taste of her own medicine a few times when 90 Day Fiancé cast members said mean things to her.</p>
<p>While it’s usually 90 Day Fiancé star Angela Deem who is the nasty cast member raining down a storm of expletives on her husband Michael Ilesanmi or her co-stars, Angela has also been at the receiving end a few times. Angela has been a part of more feuds in the franchise than anyone could count. She began her reality TV career with shows such as Trisha and Maury, where she showed she could fight, yell, and scream. However, she earned fame thanks to her debut in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 2 in 2018 when she went to Nigeria to meet Michael.
Angela earned the reputation of being a franchise villain. She controlled Michael and even made sure he was staying away from social media or jobs. Angela wanted Michael all for herself but her pushing him around made Michael seek love online as he cheated on Angela with a young American woman. Angela and Michael’s relationship reached a breaking point, but they decided not to get divorced during 90 Day: The Last Resort. Angela also impressed viewers by bonding with the cast in Florida. However, even if she’s turned a new leaf, it’s hard to forget the drama Angela has caused with some of her co-stars in the past few years</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  “Angela got really p<em>ssed off. She turns around and starts yelling, ‘You lying b</em>***”
Jojo Disney Revealed How Friendship Debbie Johnson Angered Angela</p>
<p>Jojo was a “sissy” to Angela. She even went to Nigeria with Angela to serve as a witness for her wedding to Michael Ilesanmi. Jojo was the one who stood by Angela’s side when she underwent her risky weight-loss surgery and recovered from it. However, things between Angela and Jojo soured when the former started hanging out with Debbie. Angela and Jojo traveled to Las Vegas in July 2022 and during the trip, someone allegedly asked Jojo how she knew Debbie. Jojo said they knew each other through the TLC show. According to Jojo’s Instagram Live (shared by @90_days_lol,) this made Angela angry.
Angela turned around and started yelling at Jojo, “‘You lying b<em>tch, you would’ve never met Debbie if it wasn’t [because] of me, b</em>**h.’” Angela told Jojo she was irrelevant. She cussed her out in front of everybody. As per Jojo, Angela also kicked her out of their shared hotel room.</p>
<p>7  “I Don’t Think This Is Big” Michael Ilesanmi Didn&rsquo;t Think Angela&rsquo;s New Breasts Were Big Enough
Michael Was Not Supportive Of Angela’s Weight Loss Surgery</p>
<p>Angela decided to lose weight for Michael. She wanted to live longer for her husband. Angela consulted surgeons in Los Angeles regarding her bariatric surgery. A part of her weight loss procedure involved breast reduction surgery, so she could breathe better. She was hesitant at first, but eventually agreed to remove one pound of tissue per breast. Perhaps Angela predicted how her husband was going to react to her smaller chest. He refused to support her during her surgery because it meant Angela was going to lose her breast size. “I don’t think this is big,” he told Angela on video call after her doctor revealed her newly operated chest.</p>
<p>6  “Be Careful With Me [Loser] And If You Didn’t Only My Words Will Take You To Hospital.”
Usman Umar Took A Jab At Angela’s Toxic Relationship With Michael</p>
<p>Angela has been feuding with Usman Umar AKA Sojaboy for a while now and Usman posting a photo on Instagram with her husband in February 2022 kicked off fresh drama between them. Angela mocked the two men by categorizing them as birds of a feather who were flocking together. In retaliation, Usman shared a text-based IG story and slammed Angela for her behavior. “Ask about Hausa Men in Nigeria, we don’t scam, we don’t cheat but we don’t tolerate,” he said. “That is why you been misbehaving for over [seven] years and he still take it but when your type try that nonsense with me you see what I did,” Usman chided Angela about her marriage to Michael.
“Be careful with me looser and if you didn’t only my words will take you to hospital,” Usman warned Angela. He even called her “Angedevil” using a hashtag in his rant.</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;Take A Seat And Stop Disrespecting Everyone Else&rdquo;
Yara Zaya Earned Praise For Standing Up To Bully Angie</p>
<p>Angela lashed out at Usman during the 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 7 Tell All while he was attending the reunion virtually from Nigeria. She showed him the middle finger and greeted him with “f<strong>k you bitch.” She added, “Look whose here. That lying son of a b</strong>ch.” As their shouting match continued, Usman said Angela was the worst thing that ever happened to Nigeria and that she was holding Michael “hostage.” Next, Angela turned her attention to Yara Zaya who asked her to &ldquo;sit down and respect us, please.&rdquo; Angela asked Yara to shut up and walked up to her couch.
While towering over Yara, who still demanded Angela sit down after being &ldquo;unrespectful,” Angela still did not sit down. She tried to intimidate Yara, but the Ukrainian woman was unaffected by Angela the bully. This made Angela storm off from the stage, and she started walking around the block.</p>
<p>4  Jojo Said That &ldquo;Sissy&rdquo; Angela Committed An &ldquo;Unforgivable&rdquo; Act
Jojo Refused To Reveal What Angela Did To Her</p>
<p>There’s more to the Angela-Jojo story than just the Debbie drama. Apart from screaming that Jojo was “irrelevant” in front of everyone else, Jojo claimed Angela did something else that she didn’t want to reveal to the public yet. “And then she pulls some c*** that was even worse. She told me some c*** that was even worse than that,” Jojo added. Jo said that she decided to never “speak to her again” after this event. Jojo believed that what Angela did was “unforgivable.”</p>
<p>3  “I Love You, Angie, But You Speak Over Everyone.”
What Liz Woods Said Minutes Before Her Physical Altercation With Angela</p>
<p>The latest victim of Angela’s wrath on camera was Big Ed Brown’s partner, Liz. Big Ed, Liz, Angela, Molly Hopkins, and Kelly Brown were all in a hot tub at a resort and Kelly was upset with Big Ed calling him a “bi**h.” Angela stood up for Big Ed and noted that “Liz wasn’t taking up for him.” Big Ed was touched by what Angela did for him while Liz maintained that Big Ed had to learn his consequences because Big Ed tends to run his mouth a lot. As Liz began to leave the tub she said, “I love you, Angie, but you speak over everyone,” and angered Angela.</p>
<p>2  Debbie Johnson Said She Isn&rsquo;t Pals With People &ldquo;Who Treat Their Friends Like S–T&rdquo;
Debbie Threw A Not-So-Subtle Shade At Angela On Instagram</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Debbie showed her allegiance to Jojo and seemingly confirmed that she too had cut her ties with Angela since then. A fan had asked Debbie to comment on whether she also had a falling out with Angela. Debbie replied, “Let&rsquo;s just say I don&rsquo;t put up with people that treat their friends like ****.&rdquo; Debbie continued that one wouldn’t do it with a friend who had gone above and beyond for them and a friend who referred to her as their family. “You just don’t do that,” Debbie commented. In the end, even Jojo replied to Debbie’s comment by adding, “You are absolutely right.”</p>
<p>1  “So This Scammer Called (Angedevil) Now Calling Me And My Innocent Brother @It’s___Mrmichael Names”
Usman Accused Angela Of Using Michael &amp; His Money</p>
<p>Usman and Angela’s fight has its roots in a 2021 episode of 90 Day Fiancé spin-off 90 Day Bares All when he accused him of being a scammer for marrying and divorcing Lisa Hamme. She claimed Usman gave Nigerians a bad name and insulted his rapping and singing skills. Usman had insulted Angela right back by saying she was nothing but a “pig.” Meanwhile, Usman seemed to have been massively hurt by her using the “birds of a feather” remark on Instagram because he didn’t stop after his “hospital” warning.
“So this scammer called (AngeDevil) now calling me and my innocent brother @it’s___MrMichael names,” Usman wrote while tagging Michael’s now deactivated IG page. He accused Angela of “using” Michael to film over four years and using “all his money” Michael earned from doing Cameo videos for 90 Day Fiancé viewers to buy herself a house. “And still refused to take him to [the] US and leave him,” alleged Usman, who promised his brother he would “personally” take him to the U.S.
90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p>
