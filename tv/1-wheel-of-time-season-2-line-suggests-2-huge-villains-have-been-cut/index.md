# 1 Wheel Of Time Season 2 Line Suggests 2 Huge Villains Have Been Cut


## SUMMARY 



Lanfear&#39;s dialogue in The Wheel of Time season 2 suggests that two female Forsaken, Semirhage and Mesaana, may not be appearing in season 3.   

This loss of Semirhage and Mesaana will be a disappointment, as they are powerful and significant characters in the books.   

It is likely that other Forsaken characters such as Balthamel, Aginor, and Asmodean have also been cut from the television series.

## Literature Review
In The Wheel of Time season 2, Lanfear has a line that insinuates which Forsaken are coming in season 3, but also which Forsaken will be cut. 




In The Wheel of Time season 2, there is a piece of dialogue said by Lanfear which gives a massive hint about which villains will appear in The Wheel of Time season 3, and who will inevitably be cut from the line-up. The Wheel of Time is a high fantasy television series based on novels of the same name by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. The story follows a young man named Rand who discovers that he may have something to do with the Dragon Reborn, an individual who is the reincarnation of the powerful Dragon. So far, The Wheel of Time has two seasons and a third is confirmed.




Over the past two seasons, there have been many questions about The Wheel of Time&#39;s villains. The Wheel of Time is unique because it does not just have one overarching villain. Instead, Rand and his peers must not only contend with the Dark One, but also his minions, the Forsaken. In Robert Jordan&#39;s The Wheel of Time books, there are thirteen Forsaken, all of whom are powerful and fully loyal to the Dark One. However, Prime Video&#39;s The Wheel of Time series suggests that this number may not be the same on the silver screen.


 The Wheel Of Time Season 2 Suggests 2 Forsaken Have Been Cut 
          

While there have been various hints indicating that The Wheel of Time has cut some of the Forsaken characters, one particular Lanfear line makes clear just who could be cut in The Wheel of Time season 3. During The Wheel of Time season 2, Lanfear is talking with the other Forsaken, and she mentions Graendal, Moghedien, and &#34;the boys.&#34; Notably, of the thirteen Forsaken in the books, there are five female Forsaken. Graendel and Moghedien are two of them, along with Lanfear. By saying &#34;the boys,&#34; Lanfear is insinuating that the two other female Forsaken will likely not be joining them in season 3.




The two female Forsaken that Lanfear ignores in this line are Semirhage and Mesaana. According to The Wheel of Time books, Semirhage is an incredibly powerful person, and arguably, one of the most powerful female Forsaken. She is known for her sadistic personality and her extended knowledge of torture. Similarly, Mesaana is another channeler that uses her significant powers to overtake vast regions and force its citizens to attend her schools, wherein she teaches about the Dark One. In all, losing Semirhage and Mesaana in The Wheel of Time season 3 will be quite a disappointment.



 Wheel Of Time May Have Cut Several More Forsaken (But Which Ones?) 
          

While Lanfear&#39;s line calls out Semirhage and Mesaana, The Wheel of Time has likely cut other Forsaken characters as well. Over the past two seasons, there have been theories that the television series is moving forward with eight Forsaken rather than thirteen. Some other Forsaken that have likely been cut include Balthamel and Aginor, and Asmodean. Balthamel and Aginor really only had one event during The Wheel of Time books, and that moment already passed without them. Furthermore, Asmodean&#39;s role in the original story was filled by a different character. Therefore, The Wheel of Time likely has chosen its which Forsaken will appear in season 3.
