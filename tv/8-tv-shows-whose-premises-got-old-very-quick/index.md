# 8 TV Shows Whose Premises Got Old Very Quick


## SUMMARY 


 A TV series should keep the audience guessing and bring something new to each episode to keep them hooked. 
 Falling into a predictable and mundane format can make a show uninteresting and drive viewers away. 
 Characters and relationships can only carry a series for so long if the plot and conflicts become repetitive and lack substance.

## Literature Review

When TV shows rely too heavily on tropes and formulaic storytelling the plotlines can get old fast. These series&#39; must pivot or fade into obscurity. 




To stand the test of time, a television series must have an unforgettable premise, but when the storylines become too procedural and tread familiar ground, it can be easy to grow bored with watching. The worst thing that a TV show can be is mundane because the plot thrives on conflict, drama, and stakes. If the story isn&#39;t compelling, it becomes too easy to guess the twists which will drive down the stakes of the world and make the characters uninteresting.
At its best, a television series should keep the audience guessing until the very end and bring something new to each episode that makes it impossible to stop watching. Just because a show follows a procedural format doesn&#39;t mean it has to be boring. Many procedurals find a unique hook and use interesting events to make individual episodes stand out. If a series finds itself falling down the hole into monotony, it&#39;s best to switch up the premise and find a new format, but not even that can save every show.









 








 8  iZombie (2015 - 2019) 
A crime procedural that couldn&#39;t live up to its supernatural origins

  Release Date    March 17, 2015     Cast    Rose McIver , Rahul Kohli , Malcolm Goodwin , Robert Buckley , David Anders     Seasons    5     Story By    Rob Thomas     Writers    Rob Thomas     Network    The CW     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max , Netflix     Directors    Rob Thomas    


There are many zombie shows on the television market, and iZombie tried to distinguish itself by telling a story from the perspective of a zombie. Liv (Rose McIver) is a med student who has been turned into a zombie and starts working as a coroner to have access to brains. Despite this inventive idea, iZombie was a crime procedural when it began. Liv solved a new murder every week, which grew stale almost instantly. To combat this, the show started exploring the lives of the living dead more fully and took a serialized approach for the remainder of the seasons.
            
 
 8 TV Shows That Should Absolutely Not Have Been Crime Procedurals 
The crime procedural is a favorite among television genres, but not every show finds success by following the strict formula it requires. 








 7  Weeds (2005 - 2012) 
When a suburban mom turns to drug dealing it isn&#39;t as exciting as it sounds


 







Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker) has few options to support her family after the death of her husband, so she becomes a small-time marijuana dealer in her California suburb. The first season of Weeds is fun and toes the line between satire and dramedy with ease. However, once the novelty of the fish-out-of-water story wore off, the beats of the show became predictable. Instead of working to switch up the plots, the show dug its heels in and became a parody of itself.
In the later seasons, Weeds became melodramatic to the point of irony, and the comedic heart that the show started with had disappeared. Despite the high drama of the series, which included prison, drug kingpins, and many deaths, the show still lacked substance. Watching Nancy maneuver her way out of tough situations the same way over and over, drew fans away and led to the ultimate cancelation of the show.





 6  Westworld (2016 - 2022) 
Despite the great cast, the show could not surpass the original movie
        

  Westworld  
TV-MA
 Sci-Fi
Thriller

  Release Date    October 2, 2016     Cast    Anthony Hopkins , Evan Rachel Wood , Shannon Woodward , Ed Harris , James Marsden , Jimmi Simpson , Jeffrey Wright , Tessa Thompson , Thandie Newton , Rodrigo Santoro     Seasons    4     Story By    Michael Crichton     Writers    Jonathan Nolan , Lisa Joy     Network    HBO Max     Streaming Service(s)    Max     Showrunner    Jonathan Nolan , Lisa Joy    


There&#39;s no question that the performances on Westworld were stellar and kept the show going long past when it had jumped the shark. However, it didn&#39;t take long after the first season for the premise of the show to fall apart. Following in the footsteps of other pieces of sci-fi media like Blade Runner, Westworld investigates what makes a person human, and if humanity can be replicated through technology.
The first season succeeded because of the fantastic twists that maintained narrative momentum. Once these mysteries were solved, the show didn&#39;t push itself to explore new themes or conflicts. It remained hosts versus humans for most of the series, and though it delved into the wider world as a setting, that betrayed the integrity of the premise. Due to an early cancelation, the series was never able to prove itself in the end.





 5  Pretty Little Liars (2010 - 2017) 
How many times can the same group of girls be blackmailed?

  Release Date    June 8, 2010     Cast    Troian Bellisario , Ashley Benson , Holly Marie Combs , Lucy Hale , Bianca Lawson , Laura Leighton , Chad Lowe , Shay Mitchell , Nia Peeples , Ian Harding     Seasons    7     Story By    Sara Shepard     Writers    Ina Marlene King     Network    ABC , Freeform     Franchise(s)    Pretty Little Liars     Showrunner    Ina Marlene King    


Teen dramas are not known for their outstanding quality of writing but after many seasons of the girls battling every iteration of &#34;A&#34;, their blackmailer, even the most dramatic twists were pedestrian. Despite all the characters who played A in Pretty Little Liars, the outcome of the blackmail was always the same. The young women would narrowly escape danger and ruin using their ingenuity, but A would always return. To make up for this, the show was chock-full of interpersonal drama, but even that became repetitive. 





 4  Desperate Housewives (2004 - 2012) 
The seedy underbelly of suburbia doesn&#39;t prove to be as interesting as one would think
        

  Desperate Housewives  
Drama



  Release Date    October 3, 2004     Cast    marcia cross , Felicity Huffman , Eva Longoria     Seasons    8     Story By    Marc Cherry     Writers    Marc Cherry     Network    ABC     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , Disney&#43; , Prime Video     Directors    Marc Cherry     Showrunner    Marc Cherry    


Desperate Housewives premiered with a new spin to make the doldrums of suburban life more intriguing to the viewer. There is a mystery at the heart of season 1, about the truth behind the death of a woman living a seemingly idyllic existence. However, these mysteries soon give way to traditional familial issues of dealing with children, divorce, and career changes. All these conflicts can be interesting with the right performances and writing, but the show allows the success of season 1 to propel it for far too long. Even the time jump in season 5 doesn&#39;t revive the series.





 3  Dawson’s Creek (1998 - 2003) 
Pacey and Joey&#39;s relationship remains the bright spot of the series
        

  Dawson&#39;s Creek  
Drama



  Release Date    1998-00-00     Cast    james van der beek , Katie Holmes , Michelle Williams , Joshua Jackson , Mary-Margaret Humes , John Wesley Shipp , Mary Beth Peil , Kerr Smith , Busy Philipps     Seasons    6     Story By    greg berlanti     Writers    Kevin Williamson , Greg Berlanti , tom kapinos     Network    The WB     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu , HBO Max , Prime Video , Apple TV&#43;     Directors    Greg Berlanti    


Dawson (James Van Der Beek) isn&#39;t the most compelling protagonist, and his stories are frequently overshadowed by fan-favorite couple Joey (Katie Holmes) and Pacey (Joshua Jackson). Their relationship is one of the few reasons to continue watching the show, as the pacing and storytelling become too slow and expected to bear. Though the characters do go through some development as the show progresses, the central plot following Dawson&#39;s film career isn&#39;t exciting enough to be invested in. Unfortunately, the everyday troubles of a group of teens have been done too many times to feel fresh in Dawson&#39;s Creek.

 2  How I Met Your Mother (2005 - 2014) 
There are only so many women in New York for Ted to date
        

  How I Met Your Mother  
Comedy
Drama



  Release Date    September 19, 2005     Cast    Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget     Seasons    9     Story By    Carter Bays; Craig Thomas; Rob Greenberg     Writers    Carter Bays , Craig Thomas     Network    CBS     Streaming Service(s)    Amazon Prime Video     Directors    Carter Bays     Showrunner    Craig Thomas    


How I Met Your Mother is told through the frame narrative of Ted (Josh Radnor) telling his kids the story of how he met their mother. However, it takes all nine seasons for them to get together, and in the meantime, Ted goes through a revolving door of love interests besides the mother. This isn&#39;t helped by the fact that Ted makes the same mistakes with his partners over and over and that no one matches his desire for commitment. At a certain point, watching Ted learn nothing from every relationship gets too boring and hard to watch.





 1  One Tree Hill (2003 - 2012) 
A teen drama that became an adult soap opera

  Release Date    September 23, 2003     Cast    Chad Michael Murray , James Lafferty , Hilarie Burton , Paul Johansson , Sophia Bush , Barry Corbin , Craig Sheffer , Bethany Joy Lenz , Moira Kelly     Seasons    9     Network    The CW     Streaming Service(s)    Max     Showrunner    Mark Schwahn    


The ups and downs that the residents of Tree Hill face in One Tree Hill are frequently related to their romantic entanglements and the small-town drama that comes with the territory of knowing everyone. The initial premise of the show is that Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan (James Lafferty) are half-brothers with a serious sibling rivalry that&#39;s played out on the basketball court and in their personal lives. While the two leads do have excellent chemistry, there&#39;s only so long they can antagonize each other.
Once they realize that the common enemy is their father, Dan (Paul Johansson), and not each other, the series pivots to a heightened version of reality that loses the empathy of the original episodes. Most characters pair off predictably with the obvious romantic choices and remain with them until the end of the series. The series relies on audiences being attached to the characters rather than being interested in the plot.
