  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The 2024 Oscars are predicted to follow the fresh change in genre and diversity seen in the 2023 Oscars, with great movies and performances expected to be rewarded.
The likes of Barbie, Poor Things, and Killers of the Flower Moon all have a lot of nominations and could win awards.
However, it&rsquo;s Oppenheimer that leads the way with 13 nominations, and is the frontrunner in several categories including Best Picture.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Oscars 2024 race is well underway, with the likes of Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Barbie hoping to win big at the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>With the nominations now confirmed, there are plenty of marvelous movies, exciting performances, great directorial efforts, sizzling screenplays, and so much more that are hoping to win at the Oscars 2024. The nominees and winners at the 2023 Oscars largely offered a fresh change to the Academy’s voting history in relation to genre and diversity, especially with the history made with winners in the acting categories like Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. The 2024 Oscars are expected to follow a similar path, ready to reward some of the best movies of 2023, with some highly-regarded stories and performances that aren’t apt to be forgotten.
The Oscars 2024 nominations have been announced, and now the real awards season race begins ahead of the 96th Academy Awards taking place. There have already been some major prizes handed out, including the Golden Globes, but the Oscars is, of course, what it all builds to. Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Oppenheimer leads the way, but there are plenty of challengers across the various categories. We&rsquo;ll run through the nominees and who has the best chances of taking him a little gold man on Oscars night, and keep this updated in the run-in to the event.

<p>23  Best Picture
Winner: Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  Oppenheimer  Emma Thomas, Charles Roven, Christopher Nolan   2  Killers of the Flower Moon  Dan Friedkin, Bradley Thomas, Martin Scorsese, Daniel Lupi,   3  The Holdovers  Mark Johnson   4  Poor Things  Ed Guiney, Andrew Lowe, Yorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone   5  Barbie  David Heyman, Margot Robbie, Tom Ackerley, Robbie Brenner   6  American Fiction  Ben LeClair, Nikos Karamigios, Cord Jefferson, Jermaine Johnson   7  Anatomy of a Fall  Marie-Ange Luciani, David Thion   8  Maestro  Fred Berner, Bradley Cooper, Amy Durning, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Steven Spielberg   9  The Zone of Interest  James Wilson   10  Past Lives  David Hinojosa, Christine Vachon, Pamela Koffler <br>
Previously, Best Picture category had looked - like many others - to be heading for a battle between Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon. However, as awards season has gone, it&rsquo;s Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s movie that has pulled clear as the frontrunner. Oppenheimer looks set to dominate in the below-the-line categories and win at least one acting one, and has good form. It was a big winner at the Golden Globes 2024 and the Critics Choice Awards, and has 4 SAG Awards nominations too.
Outside those two, then the best contender may be The Holdovers, which has gained some momentum and picked up Best Comedy or Musical at the Golden Globes. It has a lot of acting love, but did surprisingly miss out on an ensemble nomination at the SAG Awards. Poor Things, which has 11 nominations, is the next most likely, followed by Barbie. Something like American Fiction, which did pick up a nod for SAG&rsquo;s biggest prize, is one surprise package to watch, as is Anatomy of a Fall, which has some key nominations elsewhere.</p>
<p>Oscars 2024 Best Picture Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner
The official Oscars 2024 nominations have been announced, including the 10 Best Picture nominees, and here&rsquo;s a prediction of who will win.</p>
<p>22  Best Director
Winner: Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer)</p>
<p>Director  Movie   1  Christopher Nolan  Oppenheimer   2  Martin Scorsese  Killers of the Flower Moon   3  Yorgos Lanthimos  Poor Things   4  Jonathan Glazer  The Zone of Interest   5  Justine Triet  Anatomy Of A Fall <br>
Christopher Nolan has, surprisingly, only been nominated for Best Director once (for Dunkirk). In contrast, Martin Scorsese has nine nominations so far, but only one win (for The Departed). That&rsquo;s a major gap between perhaps the two biggest contenders, but form suggests the Academy will look to give Nolan what many would see as an award not only deserving for Oppenheimer, but also his entire body of work.
There are plenty of other great directors in here, despite some major snubs like Greta Gerwig. Yorgos Lanthimos remains a unique voice (and only he, Scorsese, and Nolan have DGA nominations, making them the strongest three contenders). Jonathan Glazer delivers powerful work on The Zone of Interest, and Justine Triet is a surprising but welcome nominee for Anatomy of a Fall. It&rsquo;s hard to argue with their nominations, but it very much feels like this is Nolan&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Oscars 2024 Best Director Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner
Best Director is set to be one of the biggest Oscars 2024 races. Here is a prediction for which five nominated directors will win the award.</p>
<p>21  Best Actress
Winner: Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon)</p>
<p>Actress  Movie   1  Lily Gladstone  Killers of the Flower Moon   2  Emma Stone  Poor Things   3  Carey Mulligan  Maestro   4  Sandra Hüller  Anatomy of a Fall   5  Annette Bening  Nyad <br>
When Poor Things won the Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival, it seemed as though Emma Stone was an early lock for the Best Actress prize at the Oscars 2024: already an awards favorite despite just being in her early-30s (with three nominations, one win), she&rsquo;s the star of Yorgos Lanthimos&rsquo; new movie and received the most attention and praise for its win. However, Lily Gladstone coming into this category shakes things up massively, and might be enough to take the Oscar away from Stone.
Gladstone is seen as the best part of Killers of the Flower Moon&rsquo;s cast, which is no easy feat in a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. The breakthrough should garner a lot of support, especially from the acting guild, and could be enough to carry her to the win, having already picked up the Golden Globe. Killers of the Flower Moon has a whopping 10 nominations, but Gladstone might well be the only award it picks up, which makes her win feel more likely.
Elsewhere, Carey Mulligan in Maestro has also proved popular, and Sandra Hüller not only shines in the Palme d&rsquo;Or winning Anatomy of a Fall, but also has a key supporting role in The Zone of Interest (and has wins with the Los Angeles Film Critics&rsquo; Association and the National Society of Film Critics) which could boost her chances. Annette Bening edged out Margot Robbie for the last spot, in what&rsquo;s her fifth Oscar nomination, but barring her shock that&rsquo;ll be five without a win.</p>
<p>Oscars 2024 Best Actress Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner
The Oscars 2024 Best Actress race has several strong contenders among the nominees, but only one of them will be crowned the winner in March.</p>
<p>20  Best Actor
Winner: Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers)</p>
<p>Actor  Movie   1  Paul Giamatti  The Holdovers   2  Cillian Murphy  Oppenheimer   3  Bradley Cooper  Maestro   4  Jeffrey Wright  American Fiction   5  Colman Domingo  Rustin <br>
Eight of the last 13 Best Actor Oscars have gone to someone playing a real-life figure, and that trend could continue with Cillian Murphy. He&rsquo;s the shining star of the movie likely to win the most awards, and his powerful turn as J. Robert Oppenheimer is the kind of complicated, meaty role that screams Oscars. It is, however, his very first nomination, which could see the Academy&rsquo;s eyes turn elsewhere.
&ldquo;Elsewhere&rdquo; is Paul Giamatti, who has emerged as the main competition and may now even have the slight edge (despite not playing a real-life figure). He won the Best Actor - Comedy or Musical award at the Golden Globes and then beat Murphy at the Critics Choice Awards, so is a serious threat to his chances. Giamatti has also been around a long time and is very well respected, despite only one previous nomination, and could be the name voters turn to when so many others awards will be going to Oppenheimer.
Besides that, much of Murphy&rsquo;s expected competition has fallen away slightly, and not just with Leonardo DiCaprio being snubbed completely. Bradley Cooper, despite really wanting the Oscar (or perhaps because of that fact), doesn&rsquo;t have any form here. American Fiction has acting guild support, so Jeffrey Wright could be a spoiler, while Colman Domingo&rsquo;s nomination doesn&rsquo;t look to have enough to turn into a win.</p>
<p>Oscars 2024 Best Actor Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner
The Oscars 2024 Best Actor race has several strong contenders after the nominations announcement, but only one of them will be crowned the winner.</p>
<p>19  Best Supporting Actress
Winner: Da’Vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers)</p>
<p>Actress  Movie   1  Da’Vine Joy Randolph  The Holdovers   2  Emily Blunt  Oppenheimer   3  America Ferrera  Barbie   4  Jodie Foster  Nyad   5  Danielle Brooks  The Color Purple <br>
At one point, it had seemed like this was going to be the easiest of the acting categories to call, because the early forecasts suggested that Killers of the Flower Moon&rsquo;s Lily Gladstone would be entered into this race (perhaps because it would mean a better chance of winning). That no longer looks set to be the case, however, with Gladstone instead entering into the Best Actress race, which leaves this one wide open for both nominations and a potential winner.
The biggest beneficiary could be Da’Vine Joy Randolph in The Holdovers. Randolph plays the school cook who lost her son in the Vietnam War, and she&rsquo;s the film&rsquo;s beating heart and its standout performer (which landed her the Golden Globe and Critics Choice). Strong competition comes from Oppenheimer, which is a major contender and Emily Blunt is one of its strongest parts. America Ferrera has a surprise nomination for Barbie, but given it missed out on Best Director and Best Actress, it probably doesn&rsquo;t have wide enough support for the win.
That is also true for Danielle Brooks in The Color Purple, which was otherwise overlooked completely. Nyad does have plenty of love for its performances, with Bening also getting a nod, and Foster is also prominent on screens in True Detective (something that a decade ago helped Matthew McConaughey to a win), but a victory would be a major upset.</p>
<p>Oscars 2024 Best Supporting Actress Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner
The Best Supporting Actress race for the Oscars 2024 has a strong list of nominees, and the predicted winner only looks more likely due to other wins.</p>
<p>18  Best Supporting Actor
Winner: Robert Downey Jr. (Oppenheimer)</p>
<p>Actor  Movie   1  Robert Downey Jr  Oppenheimer   2  Ryan Gosling  Barbie   3  Robert De Niro  Killers of the Flower Moon   4  Sterling K.Brown  American Fiction   5  Mark Ruffalo  Poor Things <br>
At the 2009 Oscars, Robert Downey Jr. missed out on winning Best Supporting Actor with the award going to an actor from a Christopher Nolan movie, namely Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. 15 years on, and Downey Jr&rsquo;s best shot at an Oscar since then comes in the same category, but this time he&rsquo;s the one in a Nolan movie. Will Oppenheimer be enough to get him his first win? He&rsquo;s got the edge precisely because he hasn&rsquo;t won before, and could be seen as being due, which was also reflected in a Golden Globe victory.
Ryan Gosling&rsquo;s nomination for Barbie will likely be good Kenough, but it is also one of the movie&rsquo;s best chances at a big award. Robert De Niro gives his most acclaimed performance in years in Killers of the Flower Moon, but momentum for the win has dipped. Sterling K. Brown was a late surge, and American Fiction has strong supporting from the acting guilds, so can&rsquo;t be entirely ruled out. Meanwhile, Mark Ruffalo edged out Willem Dafoe for the Poor Things nod, but it&rsquo;s hard to see beyond Downey as the frontrunner.</p>
<p>Oscars 2024 Best Supporting Actor Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner
The Best Supporting Actor Oscars 2024 race is incredibly close, as some major stars are vying for the chance to win the award after nominations.</p>
<p>17  Best Original Screenplay
Winner: The Holdovers</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  The Holdovers  David Hemingson   2  Anatomy of a Fall  Justin Triet, Arthur Harari   3  Past Lives  Celine Song   4  Maestro  Bradley Cooper, Josh Singer   5  May December  Samy Burch, Alex Mechanik <br>
With Barbie considered as an adapted screenplay by the Academy, the Best Original Screenplay award looks more open. That benefited May December for a nomination, but what about in terms of the win? Maestro leads the way out of these movies with seven nominations, but its screenplay isn&rsquo;t one of the most praised or talked about parts of the movie. Instead, The Holdovers and Anatomy of a Fall, which have 5 nods apiece, look to be the ones battling this out.
Anatomy of the Fall took home the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and has a Best Director nod that shows just how highly thought of it - and Triet - is. However, The Holdovers is clearly popular too and its screenplay is superb, plus Alexander Payne movies have form here, so this will be a very tight race. Past Lives would also be deserving, but probably doesn&rsquo;t have quite enough broad support.</p>
<p>What The Golden Globes 2024 Mean For The Oscars: 5 Biggest Takeaways
The 2024 Golden Globe Awards were held a couple of months before the Oscars, and the winners indicate what could happen at the upcoming ceremony.</p>
<p>16  Best Adapted Screenplay
Winner: Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  Oppenheimer  Christopher Nolan (based on “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird, Martin J. Sherwin)   2  Poor Things  Tony McNamara (based on the book by Alasdair Gray)   3  Barbie  Noah Baumbach, Greta Gerwig (based on the toys by Mattel)   4  American Fiction  Cord Jefferson (based on “Erasure” by Percival Everett)   5  The Zone of Interest  Jonathan Glazer (based on the novel by Martin Amis) <br>
Recent form suggests that you need to win a Best Screenplay award to win Best Picture (four of the last five have done so, albeit with three coming from the Original side), and it doesn&rsquo;t look like the Academy is ready to buck that trend with Oppenheimer the favorite here. Nolan turns a weighty book into an epic movie that is nonetheless entertaining to the masses, which is impressive work and should be enough for the win.
Poor Things stands as the most possible spoiler, given its support across the board and might be what voters turn to if they want something different to Oppenheimer - this is one of the easier categories to do that in. Barbie winning would be a nice surprise, but again, it probably doesn&rsquo;t have enough love for a big win. American Fiction and The Zone of Interest are outsiders, but if voters want to give them something, this might be where they do it.</p>
<p>15  Best Animated Feature Film
Winner: Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse  Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Amy Pascal   2  The Boy and the Heron  Hayao Miyazaki, Toshio Suzuki   3  Elemental  Peter Sohn Denise Ream   4  Nimona  Nick Bruno, Troy Quane, Karen Ryan, Julie Zackary   5  Robot Dreams  Pablo Berger, Ibon Cormenzana, Ignasi Estapé, Sandra Tapia Díaz <br>
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse won this award five years at the 2019 Oscars, and with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse pushing its groundbreaking mix of animation styles and technology even further, then this should be its to lose. Very strong competition comes from the return of Hayao Miyazaki with The Boy and the Heron, his first feature film in a decade, which won the Golden Globe.
Pixar picked up its usual nomination for Elemental, but a win this year would be a big shock. The other nominees, Nimona and Robot Dreams, had to fight off some very tough competition to take those spots, and it&rsquo;s very difficult to imagine either getting the win unless momentum drastically shifts.</p>
<p>14  Best International Feature Film
Winner: The Zone of Interest</p>
<p>Movie  Director  Country   1  The Zone of Interest  Jonathan Glazer  UK   2  Society of the Snow  J.A. Bayona  Spain   3  Perfect Days  Wim Wenders  Japan   4  The Teachers&rsquo; Lounge  İlker Çatak  Germany   5  Io capitano  Matteo Garrone  Italy <br>
Best International Feature at the Oscars 2024 could have been incredibly close to call if France had chosen to submit Anatomy of a Fall, which would&rsquo;ve put two Best Picture contenders into the race. After that surprising snub (which backfired with France&rsquo;s The Taste of Things not even being nominated), buzzy Netflix hit Society of the Snow looks to be a strong contender. However, it&rsquo;s the heavily acclaimed The Zone of Interest that&rsquo;s the clear frontrunner. With it in contention for some big prizes, including Picture and Director, then the movie - which is from the UK but in German - should be guaranteed to win here.</p>
<p>13  Best Documentary Feature
Winner: 20 Days In Mariupol</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  20 Days in Mariupol  Mstyslav Chernov, Michelle Mizner, Raney Aronson-Rath   2  Four Daughters  Kaouther Ben Hania, Nadim Cheikhrouha   3  To Kill A TIger  Nisha Pahuja, Cornelia Principe, David Oppenheim   4  Bobi Wine: The People&rsquo;s President  Moses Bwayo, Christopher Sharp, John Battsek   5  The Eternal Memory  TBC <br>
There were some surprise snubs in this category, including American Symphony, which led the way with six nominations at the Critics Choice Documentary Awards, and Still: A Michael J. Fox movie, which won the two top prizes there. That makes this pretty open, though the powerful Ukrainian doc 20 Days in Mariupol is timely, worthy, and has some awards season form. Look to Four Daughters and To Kill a Tiger for the strongest competition in this race.</p>
<p>12  Best Documentary Short Subject
Winner: The Last Repair Shop</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  The Last Repair Shop  Ben Proudfoot, Kris Bowers   2  The Barber of Little Rock  John Hoffman, Christine Turner   3  The ABCs of Book Banning  Sheila Nevins, Trish Adlesic   4  Nǎi Nai &amp; Wài Pó  Sean Wang, Sam Davis   5  Island in Between  S. Leo Chiang, Jean Tsien <br>
The Last Repair Shop won this award at the Critics Choice Documentary Awards and, while they didn&rsquo;t line up in the main Documentary category, that should make it the frontrunner here and gives it the most momentum. The Barber of Little Rock and The ABCs of Book Banning were both also nominated there, suggesting they&rsquo;re the real competition, but shorts can be very difficult to predict.</p>
<p>11  Best Animated Short Film
Winner: Letter To A Pig</p>
<p>Movie  Nominee(s)   1  Letter to a Pig  Tal Kantor, Amit R. Gicelter   2  War Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John &amp; Yoko  Dave Mullins, Brad Booker   3  Ninety-Five Senses  Jerusha Hess, Jared Hess   4  Our Uniform  Yegane Moghaddam   5  Pachyderme  Stéphanie Clément, Marc Rius <br>
The big snub here is Disney, whose Once Upon A Studio was surprisingly overlooked. That means it&rsquo;s another open race, but Letter to a Pig has won at a lot of international awards ceremonies already, so carries some strong form heading into the Oscars. War Is Over, meanwhile, boasts music from regular Oscar nominee Thomas Newman, which could help its chances, and Ninety-Five Senses has some name recognition too, coming from the duo behind Napoleon Dynamite.</p>
<p>10  Best Live Action Short Film
Winner: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar</p>
<p>Movie  Nominee(s)   1  The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar  Wes Anderson, Steven Rales   2  Invincible  Vincent René-Lortie, Samuel Caron   3  The After  Misan Harriman, Nicky Bentham   4  Red, White and Blue  Nazrin Choudhury, Sara McFarlane   5  Knight of Fortune  Lasse Lyskjær Noer, Christian Norlyk <br>
Since the shorts can often be about what&rsquo;s been most widely seen and what carries name recognition, then Wes Anderson&rsquo;s The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, based on Roald Dahl&rsquo;s short story and released on Netflix, is surely the frontrunner. However, the Oscars have on occasion been resistant to going for big feature directors - for example Pedro Almodóvar&rsquo;s The Human Voice, starring Tilda Swinton was snubbed, and he could be snubbed again, too, with his Strange Way of Life, starring Pedro Pascal and Ethan Hawke, missing out. If that&rsquo;s the case, then Invincible has played well on the awards circuit, and The After, starring David Oyelowo, also has a shot.</p>
<p>9  Best Original Song
Winner: &ldquo;What Was I Made For?&rdquo; - Barbie</p>
<p>Song  Movie  Songwriter(s)   1  What Was I Made For?  Barbie  Billie Eilish, Finneas O’Connell   2  I&rsquo;m Just Ken  Barbie  Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt   3  The Fire Inside  Flamin&rsquo; Hot  Diane Warren   4  Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)  Killers of the Flower Moon  Scott George   5  It Never Went Away  American Symphony  Jon Batiste, Dan Wilson <br>
Barbie&rsquo;s songs fill multiple slots in the Best Original Song category, and it should be its own biggest competition too. For all the viral appeal &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Just Ken&rdquo; has, however, &ldquo;What Was I Made For?&rdquo; feels like the more thematic and emotional song voters will go for. That would give Billie Eilish and brother Finneas another Oscar after their win for No Time To Die.</p>
<p>Diane Warren has the most nominations without a win (now at 15), and will probably extend that (with what is a remarkable 7th consecutive nomination). The other nominees are both surprise inclusions, making American Symphony&rsquo;s Best Documentary snub more odd. Killers of the Flower Moon doesn&rsquo;t look likely to win too many awards, and it&rsquo;d be a shock if it beat Barbie here.</p>
<p>8  Best Original Score
Winner: Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Movie  Composer   1  Oppenheimer  Ludwig Göransson   2  Killers of the Flower Moon  Robbie Robertson   3  American Fiction  Laura Karpman   4  Poor Things  Jerskin Fendrix   5  Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny  John Williams <br>
Ludwig Göransson won this award for Black Panther, and is a good bet to make it two wins from two nominations at the Oscars 2024: Oppenheimer is a feat of technical achievements, but Göransson&rsquo;s booming, at times anthemic score is one of the clear standouts that elevates so much of the movie. That said, the late Robbie Robertson would be equally deserving for his great work on Killers of the Flower Moon. He has 11 collaborations with Martin Scorsese, and no wins, so a posthumous victory would be fitting. Elsewhere in the nominations, John Williams is a notable surprise inclusion - his 54th, overall - but it&rsquo;s hard to see past the top two for the win.</p>
<p>7  Best Sound
Winner: Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  Oppenheimer  Richard King, Michael W. Mitchell, Kevin O’Connell, Gary A. Rizzo   2  Maestro  Richard King, Jason Ruder, Tom Ozanich, Dean Zupancic, Steve Morrow   3  The Zone of Interest  Johnnie Burn, Tarn Willers   4  The Creator  Ian Voigt, Erik Aadahl, Ethan Van der Ryn, Tom Ozanich, Dean Zupancic   5  Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One  Chris Munro, James H. Mather, Chris Burdon, Mark Taylor <br>
The Best Sound Oscar, especially since it was merged from Editing and Mixing into just one category, so often goes to the movie with the biggest sound. Here, that should be Oppenheimer: although the sound mixing of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s movies is often a point of contention, it&rsquo;s not as much of an issue on this movie (and hasn&rsquo;t stopped him winning before, as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Dunkirk all picked up awards).
Maestro being a movie about a composer should mean sound is right at the forefront, making it perhaps the next closest competitor. The Zone of Interest is also phenomenal in this regard and, as another big contender, has a chance. The Creator and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One are more surprising nominations, so a victory for either would represent an upset, despite both being the kind of movie that could win.</p>
<p>6  Best Visual Effects
Winner: The Creator</p>
<p>Movie  Nominees   1  The Creator  Jay Cooper, Ian Comley, Andrew Roberts, Neil Corbould   2  Godzilla Minus One  Takashi Yamazaki, Kiyoko Shibuya, Masaki Takahashi, Tatsuji Nojima   3  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3  Stephane Ceretti, Alexis Wajsbrot, Guy Williams, Theo Bialek   4  Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One  Alex Wuttke, Simone Coco, Jeff Sutherland, Neil Corbould   5  Napoleon  Charley Henley, Luc-Ewen Martin-Fenouillet, Simone Coco and Neil Corbould <br>
Two movies with budgets under $100 million have a real chance at winning Best Visual Effects, as both The Creator and Godzilla Minus One have incredible work in this category. Both have been highly praised for their VFX, and would be impressive even if their budgets had been much larger. The biggest snubs arguably happened when the initial shortlist was announced, with Oppenheimer and The Little Mermaid notably being left off.
The MCU has infamously never won here, and that looks unlikely to change with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One has some technical support, since it picked up this nod and a Sound nomination, but a win would still be surprising, while Napoleon doesn&rsquo;t appear to have enough love to take the prize.</p>
<p>5  Best Film Editing
Winner: Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Movie  Nominee   1  Oppenheimer  Jennifer Lame   2  Killers Of The Flower Moon  Thelma Schoonmaker   3  Poor Things  Yorgos Mavropsaridis   4  The Holdovers  Kevin Tent   5  Anatomy of a Fall  Laurent Sénéchal <br>
Best Filming Editing isn&rsquo;t quite the predictor of Best Picture it used to be, but it still looks likely to come down to a battle between two favorites for the top prize. Both Jennifer Lame, who hasn&rsquo;t been nominated before, and Thelma Schoonmaker, who has three wins from eight nominations, were tasked with epic, dense movies that run at or over three hours long. That both managed it with such style is why they&rsquo;re the two favorites. If the Oscars voters favor something a little breezier, then The Holdovers or Poor Things could have an outside chance, especially if voters look to take other opportunities to reward them outside the top prizes.</p>
<p>10 Biggest Oscar Controversies Of All Time
The Oscars are a sophisticated ceremony that happens every year, but many controversies have occurred since the first Academy Awards event in 1929.</p>
<p>4  Best Costume Design
Winner: Poor Things</p>
<p>Movie  Nominee(s)   1  Poor Things  Holly Waddington   2  Barbie  Jacqueline Durran   3  Killers Of The Flower Moon  Jacqueline West   4  Oppenheimer  Lindy Hemming   5  Napoleon  Janty Yates, Dave Crossman <br>
Jacqueline Durran (2 wins from 8 nominations) and Jacqueline West (4 nominations) bring a lot of Oscars experience to this category, but it could be the previously un-nominated Holly Waddington who takes the gold. Poor Things&rsquo; costumes are a mix of period and fantasy, both areas that play well in this category, and look incredible. Barbie will surely be the strongest challenger and could garner a lot of votes, both for the sheer amount of costumes worn in the movie, and how instantly iconic some of them have become.
This is one category where Oppenheimer, while nominated, isn&rsquo;t the strongest contender, unless voters really are fully enamored with it. Napoleon&rsquo;s period setting also gets it a costume nomination, one of three below-the-line nods it picked up, but that will probably be enough for Ridley Scott&rsquo;s movie.</p>
