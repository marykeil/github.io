## Literature Review
Young Sheldon&#39;s new Georgie and Mandy spinoff has several plotlines that were established from The Big Bang Theory that it needs to tackle. 



Georgie and Mandy get a Young Sheldon spinoff that needs to address several storylines established in The Big Bang Theory. Young Sheldon is wrapping up after seven seasons on CBS — five of those have been devoted to finding its own identity, separate from its parent show. When Young Sheldon started breaking away from The Big Bang Theory, it did so subtly, shifting from a character-centric series to a proper family sitcom, with an increased focus on the rest of the Coopers. This forced the prequel to break continuity, creating several plot inconsistencies, but it also allowed Young Sheldon more creative wiggle room to develop new arcs.
One of the best original plots that Young Sheldon has developed is Georgie and Mandy&#39;s romance. The pair met in season 5, and what started as a casual fling eventually turned into something more complicated when they found out that they got unexpectedly pregnant. Once the news came out, even Sheldon and the rest of the Cooper family were dragged into the scandal. After everything, however, the couple persevered, and now they are engaged to be married. Mandy and Georgie&#39;s story will continue through a Young Sheldon spinoff, which will also need to stay true to some canonical details established in The Big Bang Theory.
            

 What Georgie &amp; Mandy&#39;s Spinoff Means For Young Sheldon Season 7 
Georgie and Mandy&#39;s The Big Bang Theory spinoff will have some ramifications on how the Coopers&#39; final story unfolds in Young Sheldon season 7. 



 4  Georgie&#39;s Dr. Tire Journey 
The eldest Cooper ends up becoming a successful businessman.
        

When The Big Bang Theory brought in Georgie, it was towards the end of its run. By then, the eldest Cooper kid was already an established entrepreneur, owning the largest tire retail chain in Texas — Dr. Tire. Young Sheldon stayed true to this arc, setting up Georgie&#39;s penchant for business early on. The prequel also dropped hints about his inexplicable talent when handling tires, which likely helped in launching his business. In the last few years, however, Young Sheldon has yet to revisit this arc. Instead, Georgie has been busy helping run Meemaw&#39;s laundromat and illegal gambling den, as well as taking care of Mandy.
The introduction of Mandy&#39;s parents in Young Sheldon season 6, however, may pave the way for the birth of Dr. Tire. Jim and Audrey McCallister, apparently own a local tire shop, which could effectively pull Georgie back to the world of tires. Before the announcement of the Young Sheldon spinoff featuring Georgie and Mandy, it was seemingly unlikely that this particular arc would ever be tackled, considering the limited remaining time in the prequel. That being said, the new offshoot can fully explore it and even make it an ongoing arc.



 3  Georgie&#39;s Falling Out With Sheldon 
Sheldon and Georgie had an emotional fight in The Big Bang Theory.
        

Amy and Shelon&#39;s wedding exposed the ugly status of Georgie&#39;s relationship with his brother in The Big Bang Theory. Apparently, the pair had a falling out and hadn&#39;t been speaking with each other for more than a decade. They were only forced to reconcile when Mary insisted that she wouldn&#39;t attend the wedding if her eldest wasn&#39;t there. Georgie and Sheldon&#39;s conflict may have been surprising at first, especially since the socially inept genius never mentioned anything about it. The issue was rooted in some misunderstandings about what happened to the family after the death of George.
Since Sheldon had already moved out of Texas to start his post-graduate studies at Caltech, he was oblivious to Georgie&#39;s struggles. Meanwhile, Sheldon didn&#39;t think that Georgie was responsible enough to actually take care of the family. According to Georgie during his The Big Bang Theory rant, he took over the Cooper household after they lost their father because Mary was too grief-stricken to function. Meanwhile, Missy was wasting her life as a &#34;dumb teenager,&#34; which was likely her way of dealing with the death of her dad. Georgie didn&#39;t mind doing the work, but he didn&#39;t like that not once did Sheldon appreciate everything he sacrificed for the family.

Young Sheldon season 7 will wrap up Sheldon and the Coopers&#39; story in Texas, and several things need to happen to ensure a satisfying finale.



 2  Georgie Taking Care of Missy and Mary 
Mary completely falls apart after George dies.
        

Since George and Mary&#39;s explosive fight in the Young Sheldon season 4 finale, Georgie has shown hints of his ability to step up for his family. Granted that he is still prone to making bad choices, such as lying about his age to Mandy and trying to smuggle cigarettes across the border to sell at Meemaw&#39;s illegal gambling den, it&#39;s difficult to dispute his commitment to his family. In Young Sheldon season 6, he was mostly focused on making sure that Mandy was okay throughout his pregnancy. That said, once George dies he would have to devote some of his time and energy to his mother and sister, per The Big Bang Theory.
While the new Young Sheldon spinoff is being billed as a Mandy and Georgie series, unless they move away from Medford, Texas, it would be difficult to explain the absence of the rest of the Coopers. On the other hand, if they separate the couple from George&#39;s clan, it risks creating more plot inconsistencies regarding Georgie&#39;s claims of taking over the family on the heels of his dad&#39;s death. Considering how much it impacted Sheldon and his brother&#39;s relationship, it&#39;s imperative that the upcoming show stays true to the established canon and shows exactly how Georgie took care of his family.




 1  Georgie&#39;s Marriage and Divorce From Mandy 
Sadly, Georgie and Mandy&#39;s won&#39;t last very long.




Long before he debuted, Sheldon and his mother would talk about Georgie, establishing his place in the Cooper family tree. So, despite his limited appearance, the sitcom revealed more information about his future that the new Young Sheldon spinoff now needs to adhere to, considering that it still exists in the same universe. That includes having multiple wives, as mentioned by Sheldon, and even being with a different partner during the events of its parent sitcom. Young Sheldon backed this up, mentioning that Georgie married for the first time when he was 19. Initially, there were theories that it would be his first love, Veronica, but that isn&#39;t the case.
While the prequel didn&#39;t delve into the specifics of his initial marriage, his engagement in the Young Sheldon season 6 finale, not to mention their upcoming offshoot, lays the groundwork for his bride-to-be Mandy. Unfortunately, much like several plots in the prequel, The Big Bang Theory sets up a grim future for the couple, as they will eventually part ways, albeit the reason for it is currently unknown. Whether CBS is planning to tackle that towards the end of the new show&#39;s run or they&#39;d rather leave it off-screen is uncertain. However, the new spinoff needs to have a properly bookend their story.
