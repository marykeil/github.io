## Literature Review

With TV being so accessible worldwide now, it&#39;s surprising just how many British TV shows have become huge hits in the U.S. through streaming.




With the world of streaming ever-expanding, recent years have seen British TV shows become huge hits in North America. From drama to comedy, sci-fi to thriller, British TV has launched the careers of some great names in Hollywood. While it&#39;s not unusual to see an American show become popular in the UK, it&#39;s not always been the same the other way around.
In a world of unlimited shows available through streaming, it&#39;s often forgotten that some of the best British TV shows on Netflix and other services originated on terrestrial channels. Through the power of the internet and word of mouth, these shows end up becoming more popular once they reach streaming services, allowing international viewing. With such strong talent in the UK, it&#39;s no surprise that these TV shows became hits in North America.

UK: BBC NA: HBO Max


 







  Sherlock  


  Release Date    August 8, 2010     Cast    Martin Freeman , Benedict Cumberbatch , Rupert Graves     Seasons    4    


BBC&#39;s Sherlock saw Benedict Cumberbatch put his spin on the famous detective opposite Martin Freeman&#39;s John Watson. Sherlock is best remembered for providing one of TV&#39;s best cliffhangers, creating an incredible internet phenomenon as audiences spent two years theorizing just how Sherlock faked his death from the roof of the hospital in the season 2 finale, &#34;The Reichenbach Fall.&#34; Despite only having a rather minimal three episodes per season, Sherlock&#39;s complex plots and high drama made the show a brilliant watch. 





 9  Red Dwarf (1988 - 2020) 
UK: BBC &amp; Dave NA: Britbox
        

Red Dwarf was one of the first of its genre, setting up a basis and helping inspire the future of sci-fi comedy shows such as Futurama and Rick and Morty. Red Dwarf initially had some popularity in both the UK and North America when it was airing in the late 1980s and 1990s, even having a failed American remake in 1992. However, the show gained a cult following in 2009 when British channel Dave reprised the show.

They canâ€™t all be as good as The Office. Some US remakes of UK sitcoms are just plain awful. These are the 7 worst attempts to adapt British comedies.



Red Dwarf: Back to Earth, consisted of three specials, set nine years after its last episode, &#34;Only The Good...&#34; Surprisingly, this return boosted the show&#39;s popularity worldwide, eventually leading to its arrival on streaming services. Following this, Red Dwarf returned to screens, airing three full seasons and a feature-length special of space-age adventures, although its revival did see it shift from a traditional sitcom to a dramedy.





 8  Derry Girls (2018 - 2022) 
UK: Channel 4 NA: Netflix
        

  Derry Girls  


  Release Date    January 4, 2018     Cast    Saoirse-Monica Jackson , Louisa Harland     Seasons    3    


Derry Girls saw a brilliant combination of tropes in TV while coming from a unique angle. Following a group of teenagers and their day-to-day lives, Derry Girls is set in the backdrop of Londonderry, Ireland, during the Troubles. Filled with the usual teen storylines like school dances, first kisses, and getting in trouble, Derry Girls also had moments of pure drama, civil conflict, and death.
Not only did Derry Girls offer its own kind of nostalgia for the 1990s, but it also shone a light on a period of history that had been tackled in movies, but not so much in TV. Regardless of background or time, the show was praised for its relatability, humor, and the use of Derry Girls&#39; storylines based on real-life events.





 7  Killing Eve (2018 - 2022) 
UK: BBC NA: Amazon Prime Video &amp; BBC America

Based on the Villanelle book series, the spy thriller Killing Eve provides a great example of a hero and villain duo on TV, with four seasons dedicated to intelligence officer Eve (Sandra Oh) and assassin Villanelle&#39;s (Jodie Comer) slow-burn relationship. Both Oh and Comer&#39;s performances were incredibly strong, laced with tension and drama, with Comer praised in particular for her use of humor and various flawless accents. Killing Eve had several brilliant storylines, which is no surprise considering it was mainly written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the mind behind Fleabag and co-writer of No Time to Die. 





 6  Downton Abbey (2010 - 2015, 2019, 2022) 
UK: ITV US: PBS Passport, Prime Video Canada: Netflix

Downton Abbey played a large part in the recent popularity of period dramas, leading to more shows in the genre airing worldwide, such as Bridgerton and Call the Midwife. Featuring a cast of highly established British actors, including Harry Potter&#39;s Dame Maggie Smith, Downton Abbey&#39;s most interesting element is how it displays the class system in the post-Edwardian era and its societal structure. While fictional, Downton Abbey also saw real-life events scattered throughout its 6-season run, such as the beginning of World War One and the outbreak of Spanish influenza.





 5  Peaky Blinders (2013 - 2022) 
UK: BBC NA: Netflix

Peaky Blinders, starring Irish icon Cillian Murphy, is a great example of representation of the British working class in TV. Following a criminal street gang and their boss Tommy Shelby (Murphy), Peaky Blinders was praised for its strong performances and beautiful cinematography, as well as its focus on the history of the UK in the aftermath of the First World War, a period of history often overlooked in TV. Peaky Blinders came to an end with season 6 with plans for a final feature-length film, with hopes that the Peaky Blinders movie will start production in 2024.





 4  Doctor Who (1963 -) 
UK: BBC NA: Disney&#43;


 







  Doctor Who  


  Release Date    November 23, 1963     Cast    Jenna Coleman , Jodie Whittaker , Alex Kingston , David Tennant , Matt Smith , Peter Capaldi     Seasons    26    


Since its beginning in 1963, Doctor Who has developed a huge cult following, even more so since its reboot in 2005.

The show&#39;s popularity in North America really soared from 2010 onward. However, after BBC America started airing Matt Smith&#39;s first season as the Time Lord. In between its dramatic stories of time travel and alien species, Doctor Who also has some brilliant characterization and relationships, making it even more endearing.

UK: BBC NA: Amazon Prime Video
        

  Fleabag  


  Release Date    June 21, 2016     Cast    Phoebe Waller-Bridge , Sian Clifford , Andrew Scott , Brett Gelman     Seasons    2    


While Phoebe Waller-Bridge has a decorated career, she is best known for Fleabag, based on her one-woman show of the same name. Fleabag uses the breaking of the fourth wall in a very interesting way, seeing the titular character speaking to someone directly rather than providing a narration, which isn&#39;t acknowledged until the end of season 1. Fleabag provides great commentary on day-to-day life through dark humor, as well as trauma and regret. Although Fleabag ended after two seasons, it still managed to wrap up everything beautifully and had a very memorable send-off.

UK: Channel 4 &amp; Netflix NA: Netflix


 







  Black Mirror

The anthology series has tackled all manner of topics, receiving praise for its discussion of societal issues and imaginative premises. Black Mirror hit Netflix in North America in 2016, the entire show permanently moving to the streaming service after its success with seasons 1 and 2, and even saw an interactive film, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, in 2018.

In one of his most memorable roles, Idris Elba stars as DCI John Luther, a complex but dedicated officer of the law.
