  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Power can be held in different ways - through positions, brute force, or intelligence.
Characters on Game of Thrones displayed impressive shows of force and found ways to survive and thrive.
Power dynamics could change drastically, and even the strongest characters could be taken down in an instant.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Game of Thrones has seen some awesome magic users, swordsmen, and politicians alike. But who are the most powerful characters in the series?</p>
<p>While power dynamics could change drastically in Westeros, the strongest characters on Game of Thrones always displayed an impressive show of force. As big as the world of the HBO fantasy series was, the characters were always the most compelling part and it was interesting to see how various figures of different standings found ways to survive and thrive in this deadly world. The show also proved that power can be taken away as some of the strongest Game of Thrones characters in one episode could be dead by the next one.
Game of Thrones&rsquo; various kings and queens could hold power simply from the position they held. Other characters used brute force to conquer people. Then there were characters like Tyrion Lannister who relied on their intelligence to outsmart their enemies. With ice zombies, fire-breathing dragons, and mysterious religious entities, there were other factors that elevated certain characters to intimidate even the strongest warriors on Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>2024 Will Be Be The Biggest Year Yet For Game Of Thrones, 5 Years After The Backlash “Killed” It<br>
Game of Thrones season 8 was controversial, but HBO&rsquo;s plans for House of the Dragon season 2 and beyond could make the franchise bigger than ever.</p>
<p>Watch on Max</p>
<p>25 Thoros Of Myr
Played By Paul Kaye</p>
<p>Thoros of Myr was originally sent to Westeros by the Red Priests to convert King Robert Baratheon to their religion. Thoros lost his faith, however, until the Lord of Light gave him the power to bring his friend Beric Dondarrion back from the dead — six times. Thoros&rsquo; ability to bring people back to life appearslimited to just Beric, indicating that the Lord of Light had bigger plans for the fallen knight. Thoros wasn&rsquo;t invulnerable himself either as he died in season 7 after being attacked by a wight polar bear beyond the Wall.</p>
<p>24 Sandor Clegane
Played By Rory McCann</p>
<p>Sandor Clegane, best known as The Hound, is a strong fighter who was burnt and scarred by his older brother Gregor as a child. The Hound was the bodyguard for Joffrey Baratheon, though he became a hunted man after he abandoned his post due to his fear of fire. The Hound was one of the most intimidating characters in the early seasons of the HBO adaptation, memorably taking on an entire tavern of enemies and winning more or less unscathed.
After Arya left The Hound for dead in Game of Thrones season 4, he regained his strength and sought a more peaceful path. However, he took up his sword once again to seek revenge on his brother while dying in the process.</p>
<p>23 Brienne Of Tarth
Played By Gwendoline Christie</p>
<p>As seen in her first scene, Brienne of Tarth earned her place in King Renly&rsquo;s Kingsguard after she won a tournament, though her status was called into question after she was blamed for Renly&rsquo;s murder. Brienne eventually impressed Jaime Lannister with her fighting prowess and loyalty, which led to her knighting by Jaime to become the first female knight in the Seven Kingdoms. Brienne continued to prove her strength in battle with other intimidating warriors like the Hound and even Arya Stark, earning her eventual title as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard at the end of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>22 Gregor &ldquo;The Mountain&rdquo; Clegane
Played By Conan Stevens, Ian Whyte, And Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson</p>
<p>Ser Gregor Clegane was already an impressive warrior known as &ldquo;The Mountain Who Rides&rdquo; due to his size. He was one of the most feared warriors in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, showing off his strength like cutting a horse&rsquo;s head off with one blow and crushing Oberyn Martell&rsquo;s skull with his bare hands. The fear that surrounded him also made him more powerful as he would butcher anyone who angered him even slightly.
He was made even more terrifying after he nearly died from poisoning in battle with Oberyn Martell. He was saved and transformed into an undead monster before being appointed Queen Cersei&rsquo;s guard. He continued to show incredible feats of strength, like ripping a man&rsquo;s head off and bashing Qyburn&rsquo;s head against the wall like he was slatting a fly.</p>
<p>21 Euron Greyjoy
Played By Pilou Asbæk</p>
<p>Euron Greyjoy was a late villain addition to the show and one who was more of an annoyance than a threat. Though he saw himself as a would-be king, he was little more than a thuggish henchman for Cersei. Still, he managed to do considerable damage in that role. Euron leveraged House Greyjoy&rsquo;s mastery of sea power to raise the largest fleet in Westeros, making him a valuable ally to Cersei.
He then easily decimated most of Daenerys&rsquo; ships while defeating the remaining Greyjoys and the Sand Snakes in one brutal move. He was also the only human in the series to take down a dragon and proved to be a worthy opponent for Jaime Lannister in a duel that killed Euron.</p>
<p>20 High Sparrow
Played By Jonathan Pryce</p>
<p>At first glance, the High Sparrow does not seem like much of a power figure in the story. He is a religious leader who lives a modest and grounded life. However, he inspired so many followers that he nearly overthrew the Lannister family. While Cersei attempted to use the High Sparrow&rsquo;s influence to get rid of the Tyrells, he proved incorruptible and used his new power to have her imprisoned. He proceeded to manipulate Tommen to gain control over the throne. Had he not underestimated Cersei&rsquo;s cunning, he could have ruled Westeros.</p>
<p>19 Robb Stark
Played By Richard Madden</p>
<p>Robb Stark was thrust into a position of great power after Ned Stark was executed. However, despite his young age, Robb proved himself to be a skilled military commander and inspiring leader, even being named the King in the North. Despite going up against more experienced enemies like Tywin Lannister, Robb won every battle he commanded. He outsmarted his enemies and was a skilled fighter himself. However, like his father, Robb wasn&rsquo;t a skilled politician, and he made several bad decisions off the battlefield. This eventually led to him and his army being killed at the Red Wedding.</p>
<p>18 Arya Stark
Played By Maisie Williams</p>
<p>From the beginning, Arya Stark is one of Game of Thrones&rsquo; most impressive characters. She trained with the Faceless Men at the House of Black and White before returning to Westeros. While training with Jaqen and the Waif, Arya learned exceptional combat skills as well as how to change her face and take on another person&rsquo;s identity.
This training came in useful later in the series, as Arya is the one to defeat the Night King during season 8&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Long Night.&rdquo; The young Stark also used her abilities to avenge her mother, Catelyn, and brother Robb&rsquo;s deaths by killing Walder Frey and his sons. Though smaller than some of the other warriors, she proved herself one of the deadliest.</p>
<p>The Biggest Dragons In Game Of Thrones &amp; House Of The Dragon<br>
From The Black Dread to beautiful blue dragons, Game of Thrones has some of the most stunning dragons in fantasy. Which ones are the biggest?</p>
<p>17 Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar
Played By Tom Wlaschiha</p>
<p>A member of the Faceless Men, Jaqen first encountered Arya Stark in season 2. After Arya saved his life, Jaqen killed three people for her and helped her escape Harrenhal with Gendry and Hot Pie, giving her a Braavosi coin and changing his face before disappearing. Jaqen&rsquo;s ability to change his appearance and become somebody else is a powerful asset that made him and the rest of the Faceless Men formidable enemies. Moreover, Jaqen held considerable influence over the people of Braavos as a House of Black and White representative; his power went beyond simple magical abilities.</p>
<p>16 Melisandre
Played By Carice van Houten</p>
<p>Melisandre was the most powerful Red Priestess fans saw in Game of Thrones, despite her unreliable prophecies. Melisandre originally followed Stannis Baratheon, believing him to be Azor Ahai, and even convinced him to burn his daughter Shireen alive before changing her allegiance to Jon Snow. Melisandre brought Jon Snow back to life in Game of Thrones season 6 after the Night&rsquo;s Watch members killed him.
She assisted during &ldquo;The Long Night&rdquo; by lighting the trench and Dothraki arakhs on fire before urging Arya to kill the Night King. It was also revealed that, despite her beautiful and youthful appearance, she used magic to hide the fact that she was actually an ancient old woman.</p>
<p>15 Ned Stark
Played By Sean Bean</p>
<p>The Lord of Winterfell, Ned Stark was a respected figure in the North. Most of his bannermen loved him, and those who weren&rsquo;t devoted to him at least respected and obeyed him. Ned was one of Westeros&rsquo; most prominent figures, even if he never used his power; indeed, he was content to stay in the North.
Ned&rsquo;s position was significant, but his seclusion in the North made him utterly unprepared for King&rsquo;s Landing and the game of thrones. Ned made a string of awful decisions in Game of Thrones, and his power and influence couldn&rsquo;t save him when Joffrey called for his head.</p>
<p>14 Varys
Played By Conleth Hill</p>
<p>The Master of Whisperers held a power unlike any other in the realm. Varys knew everything about everyone, and his secrets made him one of the leading players in the game. He had few allies and many enemies, but he was cunning enough to keep both at a safe distance. Varys wasn&rsquo;t a lord, yet he commanded more respect than many other highborn men. His standing allowed him to manipulate events that would decide the fate of Westeros, and his influence spread far across the Narrow Sea. Power isn&rsquo;t always gold and armies; sometimes, it&rsquo;s all about secrets.</p>
<p>13 Petyr Baelish
Played By Aiden Gillen</p>
<p>It might be a stretch to claim Littlefinger was the best choice to rule Westeros but Petyr Baelish&rsquo;s skill as a politician was unmatched. He was the main force behind the War of the Five Kings, whose standing as a minor lord made him successfully fool many powerful people. Littlefinger rose to become Lord of Harrenhal and Lord Protector of the Vale. He held considerable influence over many people, including some powerful lords. His ambition took him further than anyone thought possible, and he would&rsquo;ve kept rising had his desire for Sansa Stark not clouded his judgment.</p>
<p>Every Character That Was Recast In Game Of Thrones (&amp; Why)<br>
Many Game of Thrones characters were recast across its 8 seasons, including Daario Naharis and The Mountain for various reasons.</p>
<p>12 Tyrion Lannister
Played By Peter Dinklage</p>
<p>Game of Thrones had many powerful Hands of the King but few were more significant than Tyrion Lannister. The youngest of the Lannisters was also the cleverest, which made him a logical choice to advise the kings and queens of Westeros.
Tyrion served Joffrey, proving his shrewdness by defending King&rsquo;s Landing from Stannis&rsquo; attacks by setting a wildfire trap. Sadly, his contributions went unnoticed, and he was a less effective Hand to Daenerys who had her own ideas and plans. However, he still ended the show as Bran&rsquo;s newly-appointed Hand of the King. Not many characters win the game, but Tyrion certainly came out on top and with a position of considerable power.</p>
<p>11 Joffrey Baratheon
Played By Jack Gleeson</p>
<p>Tywin was right; Joffrey was no true king. He was cruel, stupid, ignorant, and blatantly unprepared for the role. However, he still sat on the Iron Throne, meaning he was the most powerful figure in the Seven Kingdoms, at least on paper. Joffrey was easily manipulated; Tywin, Tyrion, and Margaery kept him at bay, although Cersei allowed him to do as he pleased. Still, he never wielded the absolute power of the Iron Throne because someone was always there to subdue his worst impulses, especially after his stupidity in ordering Ned&rsquo;s death provoked the War of the Five Kings.</p>
<p>10 Olenna Tyrell
Played By Diana Rigg</p>
<p>Olenna Tyrell was another unassuming figure who wielded incredible power in Westeros. As the oldest member of one of the richest houses in the land, Olenna allowed others to think her son Mace Tyrell was in charge, but she held all of House Tyrell&rsquo;s power. Olenna, aka the Queen of Thorns, was a cunning strategist who faced off with men like Tyrion and Tywin and succeeded in gaining the upper hand. She was also not afraid to make bold moves to better her family&rsquo;s position, including killing Joffrey.</p>
<p>9 Tywin Lannister
Played By Charles Dance</p>
<p>House Lannister was filled with intimidating figures: thus, it speaks highly of Tywin Lannister that they were all terrified of him. Even in his position as Hand to Aerys II Targaryen and King Joffrey Baratheon, everyone knew Tywin was the one who was really in control. Tywin consistently made shrewd and brilliant political moves, from alliances with the Tyrells to organizing the Red Wedding. His cruelty inspired fear among everyone, resulting in very few people willing to stand up to him. He was even able to outwit Olenna Tyrell which impressed her considerably.</p>
<p>8 Robert Baratheon
Played By Mark Addy</p>
<p>Robert was King of the Seven Kingdoms for 15 years. The realm kept a relative sense of stability and peace, although many still remembered the Targaryen rule with mixed feelings. Robert won the Iron Throne through sheer skill in battle but had no interest in actually ruling the kingdom.
Still, despite being a mostly absent king, Robert wielded considerable power during his time as ruler. Out of all the characters who sat on the Iron Throne, Robert is perhaps the most inconsequential. However, Robert Baratheon&rsquo;s death in Game of Thrones kicked off one of the bloodiest and most devastating periods in Westeros&rsquo; history.</p>
<p>7 Jon Snow
Played By Kit Harrington</p>
<p>Each of the contenders to the throne had a different leading style, with Queen Cersei ruling through fear and Daenerys ruling through power. Jon Snow managed to gather his own army as a respected leader through sheer courage and honor, making him a Stark in everything but name. Not only was Snow highly trained as a son of Stark despite his bastard upbringing, but he was able to align formerly warring tribes together to fight the threat of the White Walkers.
He eventually earned him the powerful title of the King of the North like his adopted father before him. Jon Snow&rsquo;s true parentage made him the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, but he showed no interest in it. Instead, he impressed those around him through his resurrection, his bravery in the Battle of the Bastards, and rescuing the Wildlings at Hardhome.</p>
<p>Jon Snow Sequel Wishlist: 10 Things We Want To See In The Game Of Thrones Spinoff<br>
A Jon Snow Game of Thrones spinoff sequel on HBO could take many directions. Here&rsquo;s our wishlist for how we think the series should play out.</p>
<p>6 Sansa Stark
Played By Sophie Turner</p>
<p>Sansa was a slow learner, but she learn she did. Her particular education eventually led her to become the Queen in the North, a fierce and undeterred woman who did everything in her power to defend her people. The North might be secluded, but it&rsquo;s the largest kingdom in Westeros, making Sansa significantly powerful by the show&rsquo;s end. Her passion for protecting the Northerners secured their undying loyalty to her and House Stark, and her experiences with Littlefinger and Cersei made her choose an advantageous marriage that would further increase her standing.</p>
