# Sulus Daughter “Makes A Greater Point” Than TOS Crew In Star Trek Generations, Says Director


## SUMMARY 



  The inclusion of Sulu&#39;s daughter in Star Trek Generations symbolizes the passing of the torch and the theme of legacy.   The director believed that having a child of one of the original characters on board the ship made a greater point than including the entire old cast.   Star Trek continues to celebrate the legacy of its characters by introducing their children to the franchise in shows like Star Trek: Picard.

## Literature Review
The daughter of Captain Hikaru Sulu made a brief appearance as the helmsman of the USS Enterprise-B in Star Trek Generations.




The daughter of Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) served on the USS Enterprise-B in Star Trek Generations, and the film&#39;s director pointed out how this speaks to the themes of the movie. As the first big screen adventure for the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek Generations acts as a passing of the torch from Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and his crew to Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). Star Trek Generations begins as the USS Enterprise-B sets out on her maiden voyage. Now retired, Kirk attends the voyage, along with his former officers Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig).




In Star Trek Generations&#39; prologue, Chekov introduces Kirk to the helmsman of the USS Enterprise-B, Ensign Demora Sulu (Jacqueline Kim), daughter of former Enterprise helmsman Hikaru Sulu. Kirk remarks that &#34;it wouldn&#39;t be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.&#34; Although it&#39;s a brief scene, the moment speaks to Star Trek Generations&#39; themes of legacy and passing the torch. In the Star Trek oral history, The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Star Trek Generations director David Carson spoke about the inclusion of Sulu&#39;s daughter in the film. Read his full quote below:


George Takei, in a way, was in the film. I thought having Sulu’s daughter on the bridge of the Enterprise-B was a wonderful way of continuing the generations and speaking about mortality. It was more important for us, I think, to deal with our theme, which is about mortality, the handing on of torches, the passing from generation to generation. To have a child of one of the originals on board the ship actually makes a greater point than producing everybody from the last series. To have the entire old cast makes it become a little bit like an old boy’s club instead of telling the story. We wanted to have a point. It wasn’t a lark and romp in space.





                  Star Trek Generations Ending &amp; Kirk’s Death Explained   Star Trek Generations not only passed the torch to the cast of The Next Generation, it also revealed the ultimate fate of Captain James T. Kirk.    


 Star Trek: Picard Introduced More Star Trek Legacy Children 
Will the kids of TNG&#39;s heroes return in future Star Trek projects?
         

In addition to introducing some children and descendants of characters from Star Trek: The Original Series, the Star Trek franchise has also introduced some of the &#39;next generation&#39; of Star Trek: The Next Generation. In Star Trek: Picard season 1, Admiral Jean-Luc Picard visits his friends and former officers, Captain William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis). When Picard first arrives, he is greeted by Will and Deanna&#39;s daughter, Kestra (Lulu Wilson), who is playing in the woods. This is Kestra&#39;s only appearance, but she&#39;s a wonderful character and a testament to the great parents Will and Deanna have become.




In Star Trek: Picard season 3, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) charges back into Admiral Jean-Luc Picard&#39;s life after being absent for 20 years. She reveals that her now-adult son, Jack Crusher (Ed Speleers), is Picard&#39;s son as well. While this comes as an obvious shock to Jean-Luc, he ends the season in a good place with both Jack and Beverly. Picard season 3 also introduces the two daughters of Commodore Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Sidney (Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut) and Alandra (Mica Burton), who have both followed in their father&#39;s footsteps and joined Starfleet. Star Trek continues to celebrate the legacy of its greatest characters, not only by bringing them back for more stories but also by introducing their children to the franchise.



Star Trek Generations is available to stream on Max &amp; Star Trek: Picard is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
