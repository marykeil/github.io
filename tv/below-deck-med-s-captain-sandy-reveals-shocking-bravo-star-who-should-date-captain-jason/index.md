## Literature Review
Captain Sandy Yawn opens up about which Bravo cast member Captain Jason Chambers from Below Deck Down Under seemed interested in at BravoCon 2023.




Captain Sandra “Sandy” Yawn from Below Deck Mediterranean thinks one of her fellow Bravo stars would be a great fit for Below Deck Down Under&#39;s Captain Jason Chambers. The 59-year-old Fort Lauderdale resident is best known as the lead captain of Below Deck Mediterranean. She has been part of the series since 2017 and recently managed the team of Below Deck Med season 8, Mustique. Like Captain Sandy, Jason is another Below Deck captain. The 50-year-old Australian man is famous for being the lead of the newest spin-off. He debuted in March 2022 during Below Deck Down Under season 1.




Captain Jason appeared at BravoCon 2023 in early November, where numerous women and co-stars complimented him. According to a video by E! News,The Real Housewives of New York City star Luann de Lesseps claimed she’d “go Below Deck with Jason.” Similarly, Ashley Darby claimed that she thinks the lead Captain is cute.


 

Unfortunately, Jason didn’t make a choice or share which woman he liked the most. Recently, Captain Sandy appeared in an interview with E! News interviewers, revealing who she thinks is the best fit for her Below Deck co-star. Sandy said, “I heard him say Lala,” stating that Captain Jason was interested in ex-housewife and Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent.

 Below Deck Med&#39;s Captain Sandy Doesn&#39;t Blame Luka For Injury 
          

The interviewers then discussed Captain Sandy’s recent injury and played the clip from Below Deck Med. The video showed how the popular reality star had fallen while moving a kayak with Deckhand Luka Brunton. When the interviewers asked Captain Sandy about her accident, she quickly defended her team member and revealed what happened. She said, “Not Luka’s fault. I was walking backwards and I was just helping.” Sandy claimed she was working with her Below Deck crew and making it fun. She revealed that she was more concerned about her back, but she did break her wrist.

Captain Sandy’s opinion on Jason dating Lala is spot on. The two Bravo stars are a great match and seem equally into each other. During BravoCon 2023, Lala blushed when mentioning that she was once stuck in an elevator with Jason. Likewise, Captain Jason also showed interest in the Vanderpump Rules cast member by discussing his feelings with Captain Sandy. Lala and Jason are single parents in similar stages of their parenting lives. They would complement each other and would be able to form a great bond.




Captain Jason’s relationship status isn’t the only topic of discussion. Captain Sandy has also made news in recent months by getting serious with her partner. She dated Leah Shafer for over five years. In September, the two women finally took their relationship to the next level as Captain Sandy popped the question, and Leah said yes. Seeing the famous Captain tying the knot in front of the cameras will be great. It seems fans can expect to watch a lot of relationship drama in the Below Deck franchise in the coming seasons.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
