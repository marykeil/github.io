<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Although many vital book characters are included in Disney+&rsquo;s Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, some missing ones should appear in season 2.</p>
<p>Summary
Important characters and creatures from
The Lightning Thief
book, such as Argus and the Naiads, are left out of
Percy Jackson and the Olympians
season 1, but should be incorporated in season 2.
References to characters like Athena and Frederick Chase in season 1 set up their potential appearances in season 2, deepening the show&rsquo;s mythology and existing characters&rsquo; development.
The inclusion of characters like Thalia Grace, who has a significant role in the book series, would enhance the story and provide context to existing relationships and future story events.</p>
<p>Disney+&rsquo;s Percy Jackson and the Olympians has included numerous important characters from the book series, but there are a few missing figures and creatures from The Lightning Thief who should be incorporated in season 2. Percy Jackson and the Olympians&rsquo; season 1 ending sees Luke&rsquo;s villainy being revealed, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover each going their separate ways after summer ends and all vowing to return, Percy and his mom Sally reuniting, and Percy starting at a new school. Aside from being a happy ending for most characters, it hints at the story continuing incomplete arcs, like Luke&rsquo;s involvement with Kronos.
Moreover, with the celebrated confirmation of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2, fans can expect new characters and story beats on top of what&rsquo;s already been established. In adapting the second book, Sea of Monsters, there will undoubtedly be deeper storylines for existing characters like Clarisse and new characters in Percy Jackson season 2, like Tyson, Percy&rsquo;s Cyclops brother. However, Disney+&rsquo;s Percy Jackson should also make room to reference or include some characters from the first book who aren&rsquo;t in season 1.</p>
<p>Casting Athena &amp; 10 Other New Characters For Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians Season 2<br>
Disney will need to cast fan-favorite characters including Athena, Blackjack, Tyson, and Thalia Grace for Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2.</p>
<p>9 Argus Is Missing In Percy Jackson And The Olympians Season 1
As head of security at Camp Half-Blood, Argus is important throughout the book series.</p>
<p>Argus is one of the most noticeable aspects that Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 leaves out. Although it was announced that he would be omitted, his importance is undeniable. As an immortal being with hundreds of eyes all over his body, Argus performs crucial security and other duties at Camp Half-Blood and the demigods. In The Lightning Thief, Argus takes Percy, Annabeth, and Grover to the station so they can embark on their quest for Zeus&rsquo; master bolt. With that being said, in Sea of Monsters, Argus&rsquo; presence is minimal since he is fired from the camp wrongfully.
Due to excessive SFX and VFX required to bring a character like his to life, Argus was left out of the Disney+ series.</p>
<p>However, because of his season 1 absence, Argus&rsquo; firing and reinstatement won&rsquo;t have as much of an emotional impact on Percy or the audience. Of course, the Disney+ show could continue to erase his existence from the camp and breeze over this plot point, but it would be a disservice to his character, as well as later storylines. For instance, in the third book, Argus notably doesn&rsquo;t drive demigods after a dispute, adding to another character&rsquo;s independence, namely Zoë Nightshade. Including Argus, even solely by name, could add to the camp&rsquo;s inner workings and facilitate these later story beats better.</p>
<p>8 Hestia&rsquo;s Brief Book Appearance Is Omitted In Disney+&rsquo;s Percy Jackson Season 1
The goddess of the hearth is notably spotted by Percy in The Lightning Thief.</p>
<p>Although Hestia is not overtly an integral character in The Lightning Thief and only really plays an important role in the events of the fifth book, she is present at Camp Half-Blood when Percy first arrives there. While numerous campers are shown in the background as Percy gets his camp tour from Chiron in the Percy Jackson TV show, there&rsquo;s no focus on anyone tending to a hearth. In the book, Hestia appears while in the form of a young girl, and Percy takes note during his camp tour.
Having Hestia in a season 2 scene could be as brief as her book one appearance. This would set up future events perfectly and be a nod to her last appearance in the Percy Jackson book series, which mimics her first scene when Percy sees her. Moreover, including Hestia wouldn&rsquo;t clash with future casting for an adult version in a potential season 5, since producer and author of the book series Rick Riordan shared that her character is likely only going to be included then (via RickRiordan.com).</p>
<p>Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians&rsquo; Greek God Family Tree Explained<br>
Family is a central theme in Percy Jackson and the Olympians on Disney+, but the connections between all the characters are quite complex.</p>
<p>7 Naiads Are Missing From Camp Half-Blood &amp; Aren&rsquo;t Mentioned In Percy Jackson Season 1
Naiads are water nymphs from bodies of fresh water.</p>
<p>The Naiads, water nymphs associated with fresh water, aren&rsquo;t present in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, despite their presence and mentions in the first book. When Percy arrives at Camp Half-Blood, he sees the Naiads in the lake and even notices them doing underwater basket-weaving. Later, when Percy falls in the Mississippi River, Poseidon&rsquo;s Nereid mentions that the Naiads are helping sustain her life since she&rsquo;s mainly accustomed to seawater. While seemingly inconsequential omissions, the Naiads are a major part of Percy&rsquo;s connection to water.
Although Percy&rsquo;s strength is predominantly in the ocean, his connection to water in general is explored through the Naiads.</p>
<p>In later books, Naiads help Percy and his friends travel upstream and even help advance Percy&rsquo;s demigod powers, making them a mirror of the Nereid who visits him in Percy Jackson season 1. Although Percy&rsquo;s strength is predominantly in the ocean, his connection to water in general is explored through the Naiads. Given how much more prevalent water will be in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2, since it follows Sea of Monsters, including the camp-dwelling Naiads is a clever way to introduce them and lay the groundwork for their larger roles in later events.</p>
<p>The True Story Behind Percy Jackson Episode 4’s Water Scene Makes Walker Scobell Even More Impressive<br>
Walker Scobell has been praised as Percy, but one story behind Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 4&rsquo;s water scene makes him an even better fit.</p>
<p>6 Castor &amp; Pollux Tend The Strawberry Fields In The First Percy Jackson Book
Disney&rsquo;s show doesn&rsquo;t directly mention them or their connection to Dionysus.</p>
<p>Given how brief Percy&rsquo;s time at Camp Half-Blood is in the Percy Jackson TV show, it&rsquo;s unsurprisingly more minor camper appearances are left out. Castor and Pollux fall into this category as they only really appear when Percy first joins Camp Half-Blood and is shown around. These twins tend to the strawberry field in The Lightning Thief, making plants grow thanks to their demigod abilities. As Dionysus&rsquo; sons, Castor and Pollux&rsquo;s exclusion is unfortunate since their father is a memorable presence in season 1.
Although both brothers aren&rsquo;t present in Sea of Monsters, they can be included in season 2 during any camp scenes, similar to Luke&rsquo;s camp replacement for season 2, the Stoll brothers, who appear in the season 1 finale. They are important because of their contribution to protecting the camp in later books. After Castor&rsquo;s death, Dionysus visits Percy in a dream and asks him to protect Pollux because he doesn&rsquo;t want to lose another son. This aligns with the more sympathetic side to the gods that the Percy Jackson TV show depicts in season 1, especially in relation to parenting.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson&rsquo;s First Zeus Vs. Poseidon Scene Fulfills Disney’s Biggest Differences From Riordan’s Book Gods<br>
Zeus and Poseidon&rsquo;s episode 8 scene in Disney&rsquo;s Percy Jackson and the Olympians fulfills the biggest differences from the book portrayals of the gods.</p>
<p>5 The Goddess of Wisdom, Athena, Is Alluded To Throughout Percy Jackson Season 1
As Annabeth&rsquo;s mother, Athena could make an appearance in season 2.</p>
<p>While Athena is not physically present in The Lightning Thief, she is arguably one of the more important gods because her daughter is Annabeth, who&rsquo;s part of the main trio. Disney+&rsquo;s Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 includes nods to Athena, naturally setting up the opportunity for her to appear in season 2. In season 1, she&rsquo;s referenced through the owls at camp (a symbol associated with her), Annabeth&rsquo;s cap, the Gateway Arch in episode 4 (an Athena shrine), Annabeth and the Greek god Hephaestus&rsquo; conversation, and Ares and Grover&rsquo;s chat about her in episode 5.
In Sea of Monsters, Athena&rsquo;s role and effect on Annabeth is much more prevalent. In a vision caused by the Sirens&rsquo; song, Annabeth sees herself with Athena and her father Frederick Chase having a picnic as a family. Including scenes like this with Athena gives her character a chance to be explored, potentially emphasizing the gods who share insight into their thoughts on their demigod children in season 1, like Poseidon and Hermes. Moreover, Athena can add to the complexity of Annabeth&rsquo;s character, who&rsquo;s openly shown a desire to appease her, something season 2 can challenge.</p>
<p>Athena&rsquo;s Percy Jackson Episode 4 Role Helps Prove Season 1&rsquo;s Secret Villain Right<br>
Known as the Goddess of Wisdom, Athena&rsquo;s not-so-wise move against Annabeth in Percy Jackson episode 4 helps prove season 1&rsquo;s secret &ldquo;villain&rdquo; right.</p>
<p>4 Percy Jackson And The Olympians Season 1 Leaves Out The Hellhound Attack
Hellhounds are an important part of Luke&rsquo;s defense and should be in season 2.</p>
<p>The first instance of a hellhound in the book series is in The Lightning Thief when one attacks Camp Half-Blood. Following this, Poseidon claims Percy as his son, making it even more memorable. However, season 2 needs to include this Percy Jackson mythological monster because hellhounds are a part of Luke&rsquo;s defense forces on his boat in Sea of Monsters, which highlights the demigod&rsquo;s turn to hellish resources after leaving camp. Much like The Lightning Thief movie alters when the first appearance of any hellhounds is, the Disney+ show can do the same with a delayed introduction to the beast.</p>
<p>Where Did Luke Go? What Happens To Him After Going Into The Portal In Percy Jackson&rsquo;s Season 1 Finale<br>
One of the biggest questions coming out of Percy Jackson and the Olympians’ season 1 finale is where Luke went after going through his portal.</p>
<p>3 The Muses Are Absent From Percy&rsquo;s First Trip To Olympus
Although typically only on Olympus, they appear a few times throughout Percy&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 takes time to plant seeds for future events, such as with Hermes and Hephaestus&rsquo; early introductions into the TV adaptation. Both the gods&rsquo; appearances strengthen Disney&rsquo;s attempt at softening the perception of the Olympians by having them express their vulnerabilities and difficulties with how the gods view each other and their children. In a similar sense, the Muses can be included in season 2 briefly to hint at their later appearances.
The Muses won&rsquo;t be extensively incorporated as they aren&rsquo;t present in Sea of Monsters, but even a small mention could introduce their role in mythology. In The Titan&rsquo;s Curse, they are a core part of the atmosphere upon Percy&rsquo;s return to Olympus, since they play music that presents itself as whatever each individual wants to hear. Since they aren&rsquo;t there during Percy&rsquo;s first trip to Olympus on the show, referencing them in some way in season 2 could be a great way to enrich the mythos and wonder of Olympus in the Percy Jackson franchise.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson’s 10 Best Book Changes In Season 1, Ranked<br>
Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1 makes changes to Rick Riordan’s books, and the best ones enhance the characters, world, and story.</p>
<p>2 Dr. Frederick Chase Doesn&rsquo;t Appear In The Percy Jackson Season 1 Finale
Annabeth&rsquo;s father could appear in season 2 to strengthen her story.</p>
<p>Frederick is very briefly described at the end of The Lightning Thief when Percy and Annabeth say goodbye for the summer. The Disney+ show, however, limits Frederick&rsquo;s role even further with Percy and Annabeth merely talking about how the latter feels about going home. The Lightning Thief makes Annabeth&rsquo;s decision seem much more challenging, with Percy encouraging her and her confessing she wrote to her dad to try and reconnect. Therefore, the Percy Jackson TV show can highlight Frederick&rsquo;s importance by including him in season 2.
Frederick&rsquo;s presence can unpack and help improve Annabeth&rsquo;s struggles with her family, as Athena is typically standoffish and Frederick&rsquo;s family was usually endangered when Annabeth lived with them in the past.</p>
<p>Frederick can appear in the vision Annabeth has that&rsquo;s induced by the Sirens, a season 2 storyline the Percy Jackson series must include. Frederick&rsquo;s presence can unpack and help improve Annabeth&rsquo;s struggles with her family, as Athena is typically standoffish and Frederick&rsquo;s family was usually in danger when Annabeth lived with them in the past. This could also set up Frederick&rsquo;s direct role in the events of The Titan&rsquo;s Curse, where he helps Annabeth and the others during their main quest.</p>
<p>1 Thalia Grace Is Missing From One Of Percy&rsquo;s Season 1 Dreams
A major character in the franchise that could appear in season 2 is Zeus&rsquo; daughter.</p>
<p>Arguably one of the most anticipated additions to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians&rsquo; story is Zeus&rsquo; daughter, Thalia. Thalia&rsquo;s presence in season 1 is limited to her pine tree, which Annabeth visits multiple times. Additionally, her connection to Annabeth, Grover, and Luke&rsquo;s pasts make her important for providing more context to those friendships. Interestingly, her first appearance in the book series is in The Lightning Thief in one of Percy&rsquo;s dreams, drawing her connection to him too.</p>
<p>Percy Jackson Is Already Making A Season 2 Book Character’s Introduction Even More Emotional<br>
Thanks to Percy Jackson and the Olympians building up Annabeth&rsquo;s character more, one season 2 book character&rsquo;s introduction will be more emotional.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, however, is Thalia&rsquo;s effect on the Great Prophecy, something season 1 also doesn&rsquo;t address like it does in the books. Since Thalia is a forbidden child, like Percy, including her and informing him about the Great Prophecy in the same season can increase the gravity of their fate and what it means for these characters&rsquo; journeys. Additionally, since Sea of Monsters kicks off with Thalia&rsquo;s tree dying due to poison and includes her in human form by the end of the book, it&rsquo;s almost confirmed she&rsquo;ll make an appearance.
But to enhance her already established importance, Thalia can be included sooner in flashbacks or even Percy&rsquo;s dreams in season 2. Overall, missing characters from season 1 are crucial to season 2 to varying degrees. While some Percy Jackson characters could continue Disney&rsquo;s trend of planting seeds for future events, like Castor and Pollux, others affect season 2&rsquo;s story, like Thalia. Therefore, Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 2 should try to incorporate these characters either through dialogue or more directly.
All episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 are available on Disney+.</p>
