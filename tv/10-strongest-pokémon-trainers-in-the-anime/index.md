## Literature Review
Fans have been introduced to many Pokémon trainers throughout the long-running anime series, but a few stand above the rest in their field. 




One of the best things about the Pokémon anime is seeing so many of the games&#39; iconic trainers duke it out, leading many fans to wonder which of the anime&#39;s trainers is truly the best there ever was. With over 1,200 episodes, many of which feature new trainers with unique strategies, it&#39;s difficult to parse who breaks through the ranks as some of the best trainers the franchise has ever seen.
From gym leaders to everyday trainers, the Pokémon anime has shown a wide variety of trainers and battling styles. This is part of the franchise&#39;s appeal, as the different Pokémon chosen reflect wildly differing personalities. Ultimately, determining who among the untold number of trainers is the best is difficult, but ten emerge as the best Pokémon trainers to ever grace the series.









 








 10  Raihan&#39;s Strategies Make Him A Top-Tier Trainer 
First Appearance: Pokémon Journeys, &#34;Toughing It Out!&#34;
        

 Every trainer in the series seems to have a rival, and Leon has plenty of them. However, the one that most people know of is his self-proclaimed rival, Raihan. Raihan is the Hammerlocke Gym Leader in the Galar region. Raihan is known for specializing in Dragon-type Pokémon that utilize weather tactics during battles, which can throw trainers off their game due to the damage it can inflict on rival Pokémon. Three of his top Pokémon in his team are Duraludon, Flygon, and Goodra, and in the past, Raihan faced Leon in the World Coronation Series Master Class battle. While he did very well and was a tough opponent, he lost to Leon when Leon’s Charizard took out Raihan’s Duraludon.





 9  Clair&#39;s Dragon-Types Are A Final Challenge 
First Appearance: Pokémon Master Quest, &#34;Beauty is Skin Deep&#34;
        

Many trainers tend to specialize in certain Pokémon types, though some others prefer to have a mixed bag. Clair follows in her cousin Lance’s footsteps and specialize in dragon types. Clair is the gym leader of Blackthorn Gym and is the last of the many leaders that trainers must pass to go on to the Johto Pokémon League. As such, Ash and Iris would encounter Clair, and before parting ways, Clair would push Iris toward working with Dragon-type Pokémon. Clair has a great team that includes some of the best Dragon type Pokémon, such as her shiny Druddigon, Dragonite, Kingdra, Gyarados, and Dragonair.





 8  Alain&#39;s Mega Charizard Makes Him a Mega Threat 
First Appearance: Pokémon Mega Evolution Special I
        

 Like Ash, many trainers have made goals for themselves on what they wish to achieve and become. For Alain, that is to defeat every Mega Evolution. Alain was originally Professor Sycamore’s assistant, and reappeared as one of the best eight trainers in the World Coronation Series. He is one of Ash’s rivals, and Alain defeated Ash in the past with the help of his Mega Charizard X, who has been proven to be a formidable opponent. Alain has a solid team of Pokémon that have assisted him throughout his time as a trainer. His Pokémon aside from his Charizard are Metagross, Tyranitar, Weavile, Bisharp, Unfezant, Chesnaught, and Malamar.





 7  Iris Grew Alongside Ash Into A Champion 
First Appearance: Pokémon Black &amp; White, &#34;In The Shadow of Zekrom!&#34;
        

There have been a lot of great nostalgic episodes in the Pokémon anime series that many fans continue to love and rewatch. One of the many nostalgic episodes is where viewers are introduced to Iris. Iris is a Dragon-type trainer who became the champion of the Unova region&#39;s Pokémon League. She also holds a spot as one of the eight best trainers in the World Coronation Series. At one point, she was a traveling companion to Ash, and the two battled in the past and worked alongside each other to get stronger. With Ash&#39;s help and her ace Pokémon Haxorus, she has made a name for herself and proven to be a worthy opponent.





 6  Lance&#39;s Shining Legacy Inspires Trainers 
First Appearance: Pokémon Master Quest, &#34;Talkin&#39; &#39;Bout An Evolution&#34;
        

 Pokémon is one of the highest-grossing anime franchises, and there are plenty of reasons for that. Aside from the great designs of the Pokémon, the colorful characters add another level of charm to the series. One such character is Lance. Lance is the champion of the Johto League and a member of the Indigo Elite Four, and like Alain, he is also one of the top eight trainers in the World Coronation Series. Lance has faced off against plenty of tough trainers, such as Leon and Diantha, holding his own against both. While he doesn’t always win, his reputation speaks for itself, and he wouldn’t be where his today without the many Pokémon he has, predominantly his faithful and powerful Shiny Gyarados.





 5  Diantha&#39;s Talent Goes Beyond Just Pokémon Training 
First Appearance: Pokémon XY, &#34;The Bonds of Evolution!&#34;
        

 Not every trainer is strictly just a trainer; many of them have careers outside of being a trainer. Diantha, for instance, is a well-known actress. Alongside being an actress, Diantha is a Pokémon Champion of the Kalos region and among one of the top eight trainers in the World Coronation Series, ranking 5th. She is known for her talent and strength as a trainer, assisting others and watching trainers grow. She has a great team, including Gardevoir, Gourgeist, Aurorus, Goodra, Hawlucha, and Tyrantrum, which she ultimately was able to defeat Lance with.





 4  Steven Stone&#39;s Pokémon Battling is Harder Than Steel 
First Appearance: Pokémon Advanced Generation, &#34;A Hole Lotta Trouble&#34;
        

 There are a lot of characters in the Pokémon series that will show up more than once or frequently throughout the anime. One character that was introduced to viewers and became a recurring character in the series is Steven Stone. Steven Stone is the champion of the Hoenn Region’s Pokémon League and is among the eight Pokémon trainers in the World Coronation Series. It is later revealed that he also holds one of the higher ranks in the Coronation series. Steven is a tough opponent with strong Pokémon on his team, such as Aggron, Metagross, and Cradily. However, he would ultimately lose to Ash in the tournament.





 3  Cynthia&#39;s Skills Gave Ash a Fantastic Challenge 
First Appearance: Pokémon Diamond &amp; Pearl, &#34;Top-Down Training!&#34;


 







There have been many trainers Ash and his friends have seen televised, and most, if not all, they have been able to meet in person. One of these trainers is Cynthia. Cynthia is the current champion of the Sinnoh region and is part of the top eight in the World Coronation Series. She is known for helping with crises involving Team Galactic and Team Rocket and has helped Ash and his friends grow as trainers. She would become an opponent of Ash’s during the tournament. Due to Ash’s training, Ash beat Cynthia and her team of Pokémon, specifically her powerful Garchomp, who has defeated countless trainers in the past.





 2  Leon is Galar&#39;s &#34;Undefeated&#34; Hero 
First Appearance: Pokémon Journeys, &#34;Flash of the Titans!&#34;


 







Ash has made some terrible decisions in the series, but if there is one thing he got right, it was training as much as he did. If he hadn&#39;t trained so hard, he would never have made it to the big leagues and encountered former champion Leon. Leon is the Galar Region&#39;s Pokémon League Champion and formerly known as the strongest Pokémon trainer after earning the title Monarch in the World Coronation Series. Leon has won several battles throughout his career as a Pokémon trainer alongside his ace Pokémon, Charizard. However, recently he ended up being defeated by Ash Ketchum and presented the new champion with his trophy.





 1  Ash Ketchum Is The World Champion 
First Appearance: Pokémon, &#34;Pokémon - I Choose You!&#34;


 







Trainers have to work hard to get Pokémon badges and to make it to the top, and not all of them make it. But hard work and dedication always pay off in the end, and if anyone is a prime example, it&#39;s Ash Ketchum. For years, viewers have watched Ash grow as a character and a trainer, and it seemed like he still had a long way to go until it was made apparent to fans that the trainer was closing in on finally achieving his dreams. With endless hours of practice, traveling, obtaining badges and friends, and developing close bonds with his Pokémon, especially his beloved Pikachu, who has stuck by him through thick and thin, Ash has finally become the Pokémon Champion, making Ash Pokémon&#39;s strongest trainer ever.
