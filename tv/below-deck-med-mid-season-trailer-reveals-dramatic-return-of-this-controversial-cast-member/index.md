## Literature Review
The Below Deck Med season 8 crew has been dealing with a lot of drama, which is expected to roll back in when someone from their recent past shows up.




In a just-released mid-season trailer for Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, controversial cast member Natalya Scudder makes her grand return. Natalya has been at the center of a lot of the drama throughout Below Deck Med season 8. She has been feuding with Kyle Viljoen and Tumi Mhlongo, making for an extremely scandalous and exhausting season. He was the one instigating a lot of the drama between Natalya and Tumi, and there have been a lot of calls for Kyle to be fired. Natalya ended up leaving the charter season early after a major blowup with Kyle.




However, according to Bravo&#39;s Below Deck Med mid-season trailer, which previewed what fans can expect during the rest of the season, Natalya is returning but not as a crew member.


 

The Below Deck cast is hanging out together off the boat, and then all of a sudden Natalya shows up and yells, &#34;Surprise!&#34; After giving some hugs, she adds, &#34;I thought I&#39;d come say hi.&#34; Natalya&#39;s arrival gets a very mixed response from the crew. Some of them can&#39;t believe what just happened.

The personal feuds between the Below Deck Med stars aren&#39;t the only source of drama, of course. They still have work to do on board the Mustique. Natalya&#39;s exit meant Captain Sandy Yawn had to find a replacement. The most recent episode of Below Deck Med introduced Lily Davison as a stew. She may be new to the yacht, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be making the best first impression. Along with Natalya&#39;s unexpected appearance, the Below Deck Med mid-season trailer also shows both Tumi and Sandy sharing their displeasure with the newbie. Tumi, for example, claims she&#39;s &#34;given [Lily] more than enough, and she&#39;s just not getting it.&#34;

Meanwhile, Mustique&#39;s captain sternly talks to the new stew, who now has &#34;one more chance&#34; to step up and prove that she&#39;s not &#34;dead weight.&#34; Natalya wasn&#39;t able to make it through the entire charter season because of her co-workers. Her replacement might not end up lasting long either, though for Lily, it would be because of the job duties she&#39;s there to carry out. The feuds and scandals make for great TV, but at the end of the day, they&#39;ve been hired to do a job, and when someone is slacking or otherwise not performing at the level they need to be at, their career is on the line.

As for the shocking cameo of the recently departed stew, the looks on everyone&#39;s faces when Natalya shows up is priceless. However, it does seem like her return, even if it is only for one episode and one or two scenes, is happening way too soon. Everyone is still reeling from the Kyle-Tumi-Natalya drama, and it might have been better if she had left the spotlight for a while before stepping back into the mix. It will be interesting to see if Natalya decides to discuss her lingering issues with Kyle and Tumi or if she just lets everything be and moves on.




Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.
