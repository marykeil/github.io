## Literature Review
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine has multiple classic Ferengi comedies, but Armin Shimerman&#39;s favorite season 1 episode has nothing to do with Quark.




Although he&#39;s best known for playing Quark, one of Armin Shimerman&#39;s favorite Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes has nothing to do with the Ferengi. DS9&#39;s Quark was at the center of some of the show&#39;s best episodes, including beloved Ferengi comedies like &#34;Little Green Men.&#34; However, there&#39;s very little to laugh about in Armin Shimerman&#39;s favorite episode from DS9 season 1.




Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 1 is notoriously uneven, but it contains flashes of brilliance that demonstrate the potential of the premise. DS9&#39;s ability to explore the gray areas of morality and its gift for writing nuanced characters comes to the fore as season 1 goes on. Nowhere is this more apparent than in &#34;Duet&#34;, in which Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) attempts to prove that a Cardassian accountant, Aamin Marritza (Harris Yulin) is actually a war criminal called Gul Darhe&#39;el. It&#39;s one of Nana Visitor&#39;s favorite Major Kira DS9 episodes, and is also a firm favorite of Quark actor Armin Shimerman.

 DS9&#39;s &#34;Duet&#34; is Armin Shimerman&#39;s Favorite Star Trek Episode 
          




Quark only has one notable scene in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s &#34;Duet.&#34; When news gets out that a Cardassian war criminal is being held by Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), survivors of the brutality of the Gallitep labor camp protest outside DS9&#39;s security office. Quark and Odo discuss the horrific conditions of the Cardassian labor camp and commend the strength of the camp&#39;s survivors. It&#39;s a rare moment of empathy and tenderness for Quark, long before DS9 would develop the character beyond Star Trek&#39;s Ferengi archetypes. However, this isn&#39;t why Armin Shimerman selects &#34;Duet&#34; as one of his favorite episodes of Star Trek: DS9.

Armin Shimerman and guest actor Harris Yulin had previously worked together on stage on Broadway, so the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode was a fond reunion for the two actors. The material clearly appealed to a stage actor like Yulin, not least because this particular episode of DS9 was influenced by Leonard Nimoy in Robert Shaw&#39;s play The Man in the Glass Booth. Discussing the episode in the book The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years, Armin Shimerman discussed his love of the classic DS9 episode saying:





&#34;It&#39;s a fascinating episode dealing with Bajor and nationalism and with Cardassian war crimes. I love these kinds of scripts, because they deal with social issues placed in the context of space.&#34;




 What Is Armin Shimerman&#39;s Favorite Ferengi Episode? 
         

Armin Shimerman has singled out various favorite Ferengi episodes from the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine canon. In line with his love of &#34;Duet&#34;, Armin Shimerman was very fond of &#34;Bar Association&#34;, because it dealt with the social issue of worker&#39;s rights in a sci-fi context. Shimerman is a former union official with the Screen Actor&#39;s Guild, and he was on the picket lines with the striking Star Trek actors during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Speaking about &#34;Bar Association&#34; in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion, Armin Shimerman flagged that the struggle of Rom (Max GrodÃ©nchik) and the staff of Quark&#39;s Bar happens all the time in America, and continues to this day.




Armin Shimerman is also fond of the fan-favorite Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode &#34;Little Green Men&#34;, in which Quark, Rom, and Nog (Aron Eisenberg) are stranded in 1940s Roswell, New Mexico. In the special features on the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine season 4 DVDs, Armin Shimerman says that &#34;Little Green Men&#34; was a favorite because it was a chance to explore the Ferengi family&#39;s dynamics. It was a &#34;catalyst&#34; that led to many more classic Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes about the show&#39;s Ferengi ensemble, firmly establishing Armin Shimerman&#39;s Quark as one of the most beloved Star Trek characters.



All episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine are streaming now on Paramount&#43;.
