## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s LeAnn Wilcox Plutnicki &amp; Lorenzo Nobilio may have fought on the series, but is their feud over afterward?




Squid Game: The Challenge&#39;s LeAnn Wilcox Plutnicki, player 302, may have had a hand in Lorenzo Nobilio&#39;s, player 161, elimination, but are the pair still feuding after the difficult Vote Test on the series? Throughout Squid Game: The Challenge season 1, players were faced with both games and tests of character, giving them physical tests of strength and mental challenges that pushed them to make difficult choices on who to eliminate or offer safety to. During one of the tests, players had to type in another player’s number on a keypad, voting for them to be eliminated. While some votes were anonymous, others were public, including LeAnn’s vote for Lorenzo.




Although LeAnn helped orchestrate Lorenzo’s tough elimination, the pair have developed a friendship after the series that has shocked both them and fans alike. LeAnn shared with People that upon seeing Lorenzo in the show’s premiere wearing a crocheted outfit with applique sunflowers, “&#34;I just shouted, sitting on my couch…like, &#39;Oh my God, I think I really love him now. I DM-ed him off of one of his posts…I just said, &#39;I loved your outfit and I hope you&#39;re doing well. I hope we meet again.&#39;” While LeAnn was hopeful that Lorenzo would respond, she wasn’t sure he’d be receptive.

After their tension during Squid Game: The Challenge season 1, LeAnn wasn’t sure if Lorenzo would be happy to speak to her. Fortunately, after she reached out to him, Lorenzo answered her message with kindness, happy to hear from her. LeAnn shared that “he sent a DM back, and it was great. It led to an exchange where he said, &#39;I hold no grudges. You were playing the game, and it just is what it is.’” She explained that she has a lot of love for Lorenzo, and as the two have been chatting over social media, she hopes they keep in touch in the future.


 

During the Vote Test on Squid Game: The Challenge, LeAnn had the opportunity to vote for a player who was already on the board anonymously or vote for someone new. Any new vote would put a player up on the board for everyone to see, so when LeAnn chose to vote for Lorenzo, it was clear she’d been the one to do so. While it was a risk, LeAnn vote for Lorenzo and he was ultimately eliminated by the end of the test, which came off like her fault to her fellow player. LeAnn and Lorenzo have buried the hatchet, especially considering neither of them wound up winning the game.




Lorenzo and LeAnn’s connection was a surprise to Squid Game: The Challenge fans, as well as their respective families and friends. LeAnn, who played the game alongside her son Trey Plutnicki, shared that her children found it funny that she bonded with Lorenzo after seeing him on the show. While the duo may not be reuniting any time soon, it’s sweet to know that they forged a bond while playing the game together and have taken their relationship out of Squid Game: The Challenge and into the real world.
