Summary

  Tolo&#39;s transgender identity is an important part of the character&#39;s journey in Encounter Party, reflecting the struggles faced by many transgender individuals.   Payton&#39;s decision to create Tolo as a transgender character is inspired by his own son&#39;s experience, allowing him to honor his son&#39;s identity and create representation in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.   Actual Play, like Encounter Party, provides a space to tell authentic stories that may not receive enough representation in mainstream media, and can help marginalized communities feel seen and heard.  





Khary Payton shares the personal origin of his Encounter Party character Tolo, including being inspired by his son&#39;s journey. Encounter Party follows a group of strangers pulled together first to solve a mystery while traveling to Baldur&#39;s Gate and then to set out on a quest. During the season, it was revealed that Payton&#39;s character, Tolo, is transgender, using his rage and magic to transform into who he always knew himself to be.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Faster, Purple Worm! Kill! Kill!, Payton also discussed his Encounter Party character. He shared what inspired his decision to create his character Tolo, including the connection to his son. Payton also explained why it was important to him to represent a transgender story in a world full of magic. Check out Payton&#39;s full quote below:


Khary Payton: Of course, just like all of us do, once you start building a character, you can&#39;t help but become invested. And I thought that this would be a really important moment. I was like, &#34;When else am I going to be able to create a character that is going to be officially in the pantheon of Dungeons and Dragons?&#34; This goes in the book. Tolo goes in the book of Dungeons &amp; Dragons now, and you can&#39;t take him out. He is canon.
And even now as I&#39;m telling you this, I get very emotional about it because there are just so many marginalized communities. There are people that want to pretend like they don&#39;t exist. And I base Tolo partly on my son, who&#39;s transgender. Tolo is born biologically female, is in her heart, head, and soul, male.
And because D&amp;D, we live in a world of magic, the possibilities are endless. And so the struggle and the fight that is going on with so many transgender kids, I was like, &#34;You get to have magic. You get to imbue your rage with shimmering magic. The struggle and the fight that goes on within yourself when you&#39;re trying to figure out who you are...&#34; And the answers aren&#39;t easy.
...And so I wanted that lonely conversation that people have by themselves, I was like, &#34;Here&#39;s a moment where I can say it out loud and they can do that Leonardo DiCaprio meme where he&#39;s like [POINTING]. That&#39;s me. I know that feeling!&#34; And know that they&#39;re not alone.






 How Encounter Party Is Telling An Important Story That Isn&#39;t In The Forefront Of Media Enough 
                                                                

LGBTQ&#43; representation in the media has gotten better over time. More series and movies either include LGBTQ&#43; characters or specifically focus on LGBTQ&#43; characters. However, transgender stories and characters are still far and few between, but TTRPG Actual Play is a space that can tell these stories authentically.

  0:57                       The Walking Dead&#39;s King Ezekiel Actor Wants A Better Call Saul Style Prequel For His Origin Story   Exclusive: The Walking Dead star, Khary Payton, wants a prequel digging into the origins of his character, King Ezekiel, and his rise to power.   

While Tolo being transgender isn&#39;t the core of Encounter Party&#39;s story, it is the motivation for Tolo&#39;s adventure. Payton allows the audience to get to know Tolo before sharing his journey and how magic helped him become the man he has always wanted to be. His desire to learn magic comes from his unexpected ability to use it as well as his desire to thank the individual he believes allowed him to use it in the first place.






Actual Play is able to do many things that mainstream media doesn&#39;t.




One of which is telling stories that may not be shown on television or in movies. Encounter Party is just one example of this, but Payton&#39;s motivation gives him a deeper reason to want to share this story authentically. Payton is able to honor his son and tell a story through Encounter Party that can help his son and other transgender people feel seen.
