## Literature Review
Mattew Gray Gubler reunites with Spencer Reid&#39;s most cunning arch-nemesis in Aubrey Plaza&#39;s Cat Adams in an adorable Criminal Minds image.




Matthew Gray Gubler and Aubrey Plaza, who portrayed one of the best arch-nemesis in Criminal Minds, reunite in a new image. Throughout the 15 seasons on CBS, Gubler&#39;s Spencer Reid went through so much drama personally and professionally. Sometimes, his experiences were tragic and intense, which was what Plaza&#39;s ruthless Unsub Cat Adams brought upon him. Considering how intense their on-screen relationship was on the CBS show, Gubler and Plaza are great friends in real life.




In a new Instagram post celebrating the holidays, Gubler shares a carousel of images that include a couple of fun snapshots with Plaza.


 

He doesn&#39;t mention anything about their history in Criminal Minds, but it&#39;s a link that many users in the comment section don&#39;t miss.


 Can Reid And Adams Reunite In Criminal Minds: Evolution? 
          

While Criminal Minds ended its stint on CBS, it continued with a revival on Paramount&#43;. Sadly, Reid has been absent in Criminal Minds: Evolution, supposedly due to scheduling conflicts. However, the cast and Gubler himself have expressed their desire to reunite Reid with the rest of the profilers. Whether that happens in Criminal Minds: Evolution season 2 is currently uncertain, but if it does, Reid&#39;s return should be an event, considering how big of an issue his absence has caused.




Criminal Minds: Evolution can find ways to reunite Gubler with Adams. Granted that she was supposedly executed for her crimes in the original show, it&#39;s possible that she was able to talk her way out of the verdict. Her return, following Reid&#39;s masterful handling of her manipulations in Criminal Minds season 15, would be enough motivation to up her game and seek revenge against BAU&#39;s boy genius. Adams&#39; possible escape from prison would be a compelling way to bring Reid back and would be a better first storyline for his return.

                  6 Biggest Possible Deaths In Criminal Minds: Evolution Season 2   The BAU came out of Criminal Minds: Evolution season 1 unscathed, but as they return for season 2, several characters are poised to meet their end.     

In any case, given Gubler and Plaza&#39;s friendship off-screen, it won&#39;t be difficult to recruit both actors to continue Reid and Adams&#39; intense and dangerous game that started in Criminal Minds. The police procedural has seen so many rivals in its run, and their dynamic as a profiler and Unsub is arguably one of the most entertaining and thrilling to watch. It will be curious to see how a much darker Paramount&#43; show handles that.
