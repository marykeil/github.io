  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While most 90 Day Fiancé franchise stars are seen feuding off-camera, an unexpected number of cast member friendships have also formed in 2023.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé cast members are not expected to get along with their co-stars, but it’s all the more surprising when they become best friends with their co-stars and shock viewers. The only time that fans see cast members interacting with each other is during the Tell All, but a few times, there are conversations on social media that also spark interest. Stars like Angela Deem and Big Ed Brown are infamous for their longtime feuds with fellow cast members, and names like Shekinah Garner and Jibri Bell have recently joined the list.</p>
<p>However, it’s the franchise friendships that are much more special. Watching one’s favorite couples from a particular season meeting up for a meal or bumping into each other during a trip is what gets fans excited and wondering what they could have chatted about off-screen. These celebrities love to catch up in and out of the studio and get to know each other better, so they know they have each other’s backs in the toughest of situations. In 2023, a large list of such friendships stood out and surprised the show’s viewers.</p>

In November 2023, Jasmine shared an Instagram story calling Nikki her “crush.” She also declared that she loves “the Nikki” and would marry the Hoboken woman in a heartbeat. Nikki and Jasmine’s friendship is shocking but a great example of camaraderie between the new cast members.</p>

Daniele was already separated from Yohan and Julio had split from Kirsten Schoemaker for over a year. The August 2023 picture of Daniele and Yohan suggests they may have met after talking for a while. However, they did not indicate that their relationship was anything other than friendly. Daniele also spent time with another 90 Day Fiancé newcomer, Razvan Ciocoi, in December 2023 at a Miami event. “It’s not a thing so please no one make it a thing,” Daniele told a curious Instagrammer.</p>

The surprising bunch of cast members had a great time meeting up with the LGBTQ+ community and allies. &ldquo;Glad there’s evidence since I remember nothing,&rdquo; Daniele wrote in the comments. Gabe replied, &ldquo;We got the receipts.&rdquo; Daniele tried to imply that she had one too many drinks at the Pride event for her to recall the fun she had with Gabe and Jen.</p>

<p>Riley wanted to give his relationship another try after his 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 stint, because Violet Tuyet was going to visit him in the States. However, Riley may not have been able to continue the relationship since he was soon spotted flirting with Usman Umar’s ex-fiancé Kim during an Instagram live in October 2023. Riley had asked Kim to meet him in San Diego. He revealed that his father called Kim his daughter-in-law. Kim did manage to meet Riley as they celebrated Tyray Mollett’s birthday together.

However, in June 2023, Scott posted a strange video where he was shirtless and lying down on a couch and asking Tiffany Franco to be his girlfriend. Scott filmed himself admitting that he had a little crush on Tiffany.</p>
<p>Scott said that he handled rejection very well and was not going to keep reaching out to Tiffany if she was not feeling it. Scott said he came to Tiffany with the best intentions and wanted a chance to make Tiffany smile. Unfortunately for Scott, Tiffany did not end up dating him. She is currently in a new relationship with a man called Ronnie, not to be confused with her ex-husband Ronald Smith.</p>
