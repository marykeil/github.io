## Literature Review
While most 90 Day Fiancé franchise stars are seen feuding off-camera, an unexpected number of cast member friendships have also formed in 2023.




90 Day Fiancé cast members are not expected to get along with their co-stars, but it’s all the more surprising when they become best friends with their co-stars and shock viewers. The only time that fans see cast members interacting with each other is during the Tell All, but a few times, there are conversations on social media that also spark interest. Stars like Angela Deem and Big Ed Brown are infamous for their longtime feuds with fellow cast members, and names like Shekinah Garner and Jibri Bell have recently joined the list.




However, it’s the franchise friendships that are much more special. Watching one’s favorite couples from a particular season meeting up for a meal or bumping into each other during a trip is what gets fans excited and wondering what they could have chatted about off-screen. These celebrities love to catch up in and out of the studio and get to know each other better, so they know they have each other’s backs in the toughest of situations. In 2023, a large list of such friendships stood out and surprised the show’s viewers.
