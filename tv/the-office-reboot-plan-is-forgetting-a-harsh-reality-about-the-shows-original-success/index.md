# The Office Reboot Plan Is Forgetting A Harsh Reality About The Shows Original Success


## SUMMARY 



  A revival of The Office needs to consider the major shift in modern workplaces, as the traditional 9-5 office setting is becoming increasingly rare.   The show cannot revisit the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company as it may not even exist anymore, so it will need to address the changes in average workplace settings in 2024 and beyond.   Recognizing the modern workplace can benefit the revival, as some of the original show&#39;s best episodes occurred outside of the office, offering storytelling opportunities in different work settings.

## Literature Review

The plan for the reboot of NBC&#39;s beloved comedy The Office will have to contend with losing a major factor in the original show&#39;s success.




A revival of the beloved comedy The Office is underway, but it will need to contend with losing one of the keys to the original show&#39;s success. The latest exciting update from the reboot&#39;s development is that the US version&#39;s showrunner, Greg Daniels, is returning to oversee the show&#39;s production, and has already begun assembling a writer&#39;s room. While details are still scarce, it seems that the show will not revisit the Scranton branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company and its host of famous (and infamous) employees, and will instead focus on a new workplace.




While there may be some cameos and cross-overs to maintain connectivity to the original show, the reboot will obviously be set in the modern time frame, which opens up a new world of story-telling opportunities. A revival will have to address the original in some ways, and it would likely need to break Michael Scott&#39;s perfect ending by bringing him back, given his status as one of the most beloved characters in TV comedy. But there is one even more important reality that the show will need to address if it has any chance of success.

                  The Office Reboot: Confirmation Reports &amp; Everything We Know   The Office is returning in an all-new reboot, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the beloved comedy&#39;s long-awaited return.    


 The Office Reboot Needs To Consider How Much Workplaces Have Changed Since The Original Show 
The traditional 9-5 shift in cubicles is a thing of the past.
          




It would be nearly impossible for the reboot to revisit the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, as there is almost no chance the company would even exist anymore (despite the forward-thinking changes some of its later bosses tried to implement). If the show follows a different modern workplace, it will need to address the major shift in what the average workplace looks like in 2024 and beyond. It has become increasingly rare for any company to stick to a traditional, 9-5, Monday through Friday schedule with every employee traveling to an office.

Many companies shifted to an entirely remote system of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, and some never switched back. Others have moved to a hybrid schedule, working some days in the office and some remotely. There is a realistic expectation that younger audience members would not be able to relate to the traditional workplace setting like so many of the original viewers of The Office did. Just like watching a character use a flip phone or a phone booth, it could come across as jarring to modern audiences.






 How A New Version Of The Office Can Use Current Workplace Settings As An Advantage 
Some of the original show&#39;s best episodes occurred outside the Dunder Mifflin office.
         

The Office revival may actually benefit from being forced to recognize the modern workplace. Some of the original show&#39;s most memorable episodes placed the characters away from Dunder Mifflin. For example, the season 4 episode &#34;Money&#34; saw Jim and Pam stay overnight at Schrute Farms. In fact, the episode widely recognized as the best from the original series, season 4&#39;s &#34;Dinner Party&#34;, takes place almost entirely in Michael&#39;s condo. The Office reboot will have to contend with shifting its formula to deal with modern work settings, but it may actually be the best thing for the show&#39;s success.
