# 1 Polarizing Star Trek Voyager Character Was Saved By Scheduling Issues


## SUMMARY 



Scheduling issues in the early seasons of Star Trek: Voyager saved Neelix from becoming completely unlikable.   
Neelix&#39;s jealousy over Kes&#39;s interactions was one of his least appealing qualities and would have been worsened if episodes were aired in their original order.   
As the show progressed, Voyager rehabilitated Neelix&#39;s character by ending his relationship with Kes and giving him better storylines and character development.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s season 2 scheduling issues hurt the show in a lot of ways, but one character&#39;s reputation was saved by them in the long run.




Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s season 2 scheduling issues saved one polarizing character from going any further downhill. The end of Voyager season 1 and the beginning of season 2 suffered from several bizarre scheduling choices, with four episodes that were supposed to be broadcast with season 1 moved to the beginning of season 2 instead. This shortened Voyager season 1 to just 16 episodes, well shy of the show&#39;s usual 26, and meant that the end of the season was decidedly anticlimactic, capping things off with a fairly mundane episode instead of taking everything out with a bang.




Despite gaining some extra episodes, Voyager season 2 wasn&#39;t saved from the consequences of the show&#39;s scheduling problems. Moving episodes that were supposed to have aired in season 1 to the new season caused some strange plotholes, like issues with the length of Samantha Wildman&#39;s (Nancy Hower) pregnancy, to crop up. However, amid all these problems, one thing that was actually improved was one Voyager character&#39;s reputation.

Star Trek: Voyager’s Scheduling Issues Saved Neelix From Becoming Completely Unlikable 
          

Neelix (Ethan Phillips) might have lost all likability had it not been for Voyager moving episodes around in season 2. Much of Neelix&#39;s early storylines centered on his relationship with Kes (Jennifer Lein), and particularly his intense jealousy over Kes&#39;s smallest interaction with other male characters. Neelix&#39;s jealousy was one of his least appealing qualities, and combined with his over-the-top personality, it was generally handled poorly. Neelix was already at a disadvantage in terms of character appeal, but watching him fly into a rage when Kes interacted with practically anyone who wasn&#39;t him did nothing to make his character more likable.




The only good thing about Neelix&#39;s jealousy was that, before it was resolved, Voyager managed to space out its appearance in episodes. However, if Voyager&#39;s episode order had played out the way it was originally supposed to, this would not have been the case. In particular, if season 2, episode 6, &#34;Twisted&#34; had aired in its original order, it would have come back-to-back with another episode where Neelix was shown to be intensely jealous over Kes&#39;s interactions with Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), season 2, episode 4, &#34;Elogium.&#34; Voyager&#39;s scheduling issues hurt the show overall, but in the end, they did save the creative team from sabotaging Neelix&#39;s character entirely.



 How Voyager Rehabilitated Neelix’s Character In Later Seasons 
          

Luckily, Voyager made sure to put Neelix&#39;s jealousy to bed in season 2 and continued to rehabilitate his character as the seasons went on. One of the ways the show accomplished this was by finally realizing that Neelix&#39;s relationship with Kes was hurting both characters. Neither was at their best when they were together and their relationship with other characters, such as Kes&#39;s friendship with the Doctor (Robert Picardo) or Neelix&#39;s hilarious conflicts with Tuvok (Tim Russ) were more satisfying to watch.




Once Neelix and Kes were no longer together, and especially after Kes left Voyager in season 4, Neelix was free to have much better storylines and character development overall. His personality mellowed out considerably, and although he never entirely stopped being the show&#39;s comedic relief, storylines like his role as Naomi Wildman&#39;s (Scarlett Pomers) godfather or his eventual departure from the show to be with Dexa (Julianne Christie) gave the character a much-needed grounding. Neelix was never Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s biggest fan-favorite character, but he did become much more interesting and likable thanks to the show realizing its mistakes.
