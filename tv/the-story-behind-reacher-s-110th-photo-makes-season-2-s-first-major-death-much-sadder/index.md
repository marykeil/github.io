Summary

  Calvin Franz printing copies of the 110th&#39;s group photo reveals his role as the emotional heart of the team in Reacher season 2 and makes his death even more devastating.   The photo subplot highlights the importance of the Special Investigators&#39; dynamic and how Franz&#39;s actions connect them all, making his death a significant loss for the team.  







The very first character death in Reacher season 2 looks even more tragic after episode 7&#39;s flashback reveals a previously unknown detail about the 110th&#39;s group photo. Based on Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck &amp; Trouble, Reacher season 2 has reunited Alan Ritchson&#39;s two-legged behemoth with his old Special Investigator pals from the 110th, and a running theme of the sophomore season has been the group photograph taken on their first night together. Episode 1&#39;s flashback showed the campfire snap being taken, before the same photo resurfaced in the present in Franz&#39;s office, Swan&#39;s house, and Orozco&#39;s residence. Reacher, apparently, is the only Special Investigator without a copy.

Reacher season 2, episode 7, &#34;The Man Goes Through,&#34; continues the photograph subplot. In a flashback set on the 110th&#39;s final day as a unit, Calvin Franz hands out printed copies of the picture to each of his colleagues as a surprise parting gift. This explains how each character came into possession of the photograph, and why all of them except Reacher have it framed in the present day. While this may seem like a minor detail, it actually reveals a vital aspect of the Special Investigators&#39; dynamic - one that makes Reacher season 2&#39;s first significant character death retrospectively sadder.




                  Reacher Season 3: Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Prime Video&#39;s Reacher is coming back for a third season, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the upcoming episodes.     


 Franz Being Responsible For The 110th Photos Proves He Was The Team&#39;s Heart 
          

Calvin Franz making sure each Special Investigator had a commemorative photo highlights how he was both the unit&#39;s emotional heart and its innocent soul. This has been evident throughout Reacher season 2. Franz was the nervous rookie Reacher encountered first on day one. Franz figured out Reacher orchestrated the bar brawl that forced the 110th to work together for the first time. After disbanding, Franz then taught his own son the &#34;you do not mess with the Special Investigators&#34; motto. Franz was the most emotionally in-tune member of the team, and the most open about his admiration, even styling his hair to look like Reacher&#39;s.




As such, it&#39;s fitting that the reason every Special Investigator - with a house, at least - keeps a photograph of their old team is because Calvin Franz had the thoughtful notion of printing copies to share around on their final day together. This makes the fact Franz was the Reacher season 2 cast&#39;s first major victim even more upsetting. By killing Franz, the bad guys ripped out the heart of the Special Investigators. Even worse, Franz&#39;s faith in his fellow 110th recruits was so strong, he refused to let the group break up without everyone getting a physical reminder of their time together. Despite this, the Special Investigators were unable to repay Franz by protecting him from harm.



 Why Reacher Didn&#39;t Keep His 110th Photo 
          

After finding the framed photo among Orozco&#39;s possessions earlier in season 2, Reacher realized he was the only Special Investigator without a copy. The flashback in episode 7, however, explicitly confirms Franz had one printed out for his boss, as Reacher is visibly seen holding a photo from the pile. He puts it down to help Dixon with something, but then, presumably, never picks the photo back up, leaving it behind forever. Again, this detail twists the knife of Franz&#39;s death, especially from Reacher&#39;s own perspective. The photo was the final gift Calvin Franz ever gave Reacher - one last act of kindness before going their separate ways.




Rather than accepting the gesture and keeping the photo - wrapping it around his toothbrush, perhaps - Reacher refused to take the keepsake because it didn&#39;t align with his minimalist lifestyle. Now Franz is dead, Reacher is perhaps regretting the fact he didn&#39;t accept that kind token of Franz&#39;s love for the 110th - something season 2 already hinted at when Reacher complained about being the only Special Investigator without one. Perhaps Reacher&#39;s revenge mission against New Age and Langston is partly fueled by the realization that he didn&#39;t do enough for Calvin Franz while he was alive.



Reacher season 2 concludes Friday on Prime Video.
