## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games fans are shocked by spoilers that have revealed the alleged first competitor out of the holiday-themed spin-off series.




Big Brother Reindeer Games is just getting underway, but fans are already floored by spoilers that reveal the alleged first contestant eliminated from the game. A spin-off of the long-running CBS reality competition series Big Brother, BB Reindeer Games focuses more exclusively on the competitions than the strategy side of the game. Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 will consist of six episodes, each with different running times to best show off the level of competition. With a cast full of Big Brother alumni participating, the games will be a mix of classic BB competitions and newly created holiday specials sure to bring out the best of the best.




According to @ryansreputation on Twitter, Big Brother Reindeer Games is starting with a shock as the first episode leads to the elimination of a major player. With competitors like BB 19&#39;s Josh Martinez, BB 16 winner Nicole Franzel, BB 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin, and Big Brother: All-Stars 2 winner Cody Calafiore taking their chance at winning Big Brother Reindeer Games $100,000 prize, the series will feature some shocking eliminations. Despite being one of the most physical competitors in the game, it&#39;s been reported that Cody is the first player booted off of Big Brother Reindeer Games.


 What To Expect From Big Brother Reindeer Games 
          

While there&#39;s not much information about the style of the series, @ryansreputation shared some more about what fans can expect from Big Brother Reindeer Games. According to Ryan, the series is a dramatic one with &#34;multiple blowups and arguments&#34; and an &#34;unexpected winner&#34; taking home the $100,000 grand prize. Ryan also shared that several of the men lost out quickly in the competition, leaving some fan favorites to get to the end of the game. Big Brother Reindeer Games &#34;comps arenâ€™t extremely physical and rely on social and strategic elements&#34; despite the series promoting itself as a competition-based version of Big Brother.





 

Although Big Brother Reindeer Games was highly criticized by the Big Brother community before its premiere, it seems that the competition may be an interesting mix of competitions that push the former houseguests into an entirely different style of gameplay. While there&#39;s not meant to be much social strategy surrounding the eliminations of Reindeer Games, there appears to be a social element to the games themselves that could make things difficult for some of the more physically dominant competitors. With players like BB 3 &amp; 7&#39;s Danielle Reyes, and BB 23&#39;s Xavier Prather joining in on the holiday fun, BB Reindeer Games will be an exciting venture.

Though the Reindeer Games competition may be a bit more open than most viewers initially anticipated, it&#39;s still nearly anyone&#39;s game to win when it comes to Big Brother Reindeer Games. The series, which will air three episodes a week throughout the two-week run, will provide an exciting look at the way some legendary players work in an entirely new game setting, flanked with newer players who are hoping to prove themselves competitively. While it remains to be seen just how Big Brother Reindeer Games shakes out, the series looks like it&#39;ll be an exciting one for Big Brother fans.
