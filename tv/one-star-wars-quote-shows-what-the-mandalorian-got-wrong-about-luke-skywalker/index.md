# One Star Wars Quote Shows What The Mandalorian Got Wrong About Luke Skywalker


## SUMMARY 



  Luke Skywalker&#39;s character arc in the original trilogy focused on family and connection, and he was willing to go against Jedi traditions to protect his loved ones.   The Mandalorian treats Luke Skywalker as just a Jedi rather than acknowledging his status as a Skywalker and the legacy that comes with it.   The ultimatum Luke gives Grogu in The Mandalorian is out of character, as Luke had previously recognized the value of attachments and refused to make the same mistakes as the Jedi of the past.

## Literature Review
This one quote proves The Mandalorian doesn&#39;t understand Luke Skywalker&#39;s character, and it explains a lot about his cameo appearance in the show.




This Star Wars quote perfectly encapsulates what The Mandalorian got wrong about Luke Skywalker&#39;s character. Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi received heavy criticism for its portrayal of Luke Skywalker, and even Mark Hamill stated that his vision of Luke differed from Rian Johnson&#39;s vision of the character. However, this isn&#39;t the only time in recent years that Star Wars has misunderstood the character of Luke Skywalker. More recently, a young Luke Skywalker made an appearance in The Mandalorian. Unfortunately, like the second installment of the sequel trilogy, The Mandalorian doesn&#39;t understand Luke&#39;s character, and this is encapsulated in one quote.




Luke Skywalker&#39;s The Mandalorian entrance was exciting. Din Djarin, Grogu, and friends were outnumbered by battle droids as they made a stand against the Imperial remnant, and just when things looked bleak, a cloaked Jedi came and saved the day. This Jedi, it was revealed, was none other than Luke Skywalker. He took Grogu to be his apprentice, which prompted Din Djarin to remove his helmet so the boy could see his face once before they were separated. Grogu trained with Luke for two years before the Jedi Master gave him an ultimatum: accept Din Djarin&#39;s beskar gift and return to him, or continue his Jedi training. Grogu chose the former, but this proposed choice alone proves something very wrong about Luke&#39;s character.

 Luke Skywalker Has Always Been About Family 
          




In the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker&#39;s character arc focused on family. From the time Obi-Wan Kenobi told him that his father was a great Jedi, Luke wanted to become one, because he wanted to be closer to the father he never knew. Luke often longed for family and connection. This was demonstrated when he left his Jedi training because Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and Han Solo were in danger. Yoda and Obi-Wan both warned him against attachments and urged him to finish his Jedi training, but Luke refused to abandon his friends and (as is revealed later) his twin sister. The quote below, shared by Caleb // Revan1207, encapsulates this theme of family and connection.


 

As this quote makes clear, Luke was willing to buck Jedi tradition to take care of the people he loved. When Luke faced Darth Vader for the first (and last) time after he discovered the Sith Lord was his father, once again against Yoda and Obi-Wan&#39;s advice, he refused to fight. Instead, he turned his father back to the light side by reaching out to his father in love. This theme was continued in Legends, where Luke eventually married and had children of his own.






 The Mandalorian Treats Luke As Just A Jedi - Not A Skywalker 
          

In The Mandalorian, Luke could tell that Grogu was struggling with being separated from his adoptive father. Given his behavior in the original trilogy, it would be reasonable to assume that he would allow Grogu to see Din Djarin while still training as a Jedi. Instead, he told Grogu he wouldn&#39;t train him unless he rejected Din Djarin&#39;s gift of a beskar chain mail shirt. This makes no sense with Luke&#39;s character, especially seeing as his first lightsaber originally belonged to his father and was gifted to him by Obi-Wan. It seems hypocritical of him to deny Grogu a gift from his father.

The Mandalorian treats Luke as merely a Jedi rather than a Jedi who is also a part of the Skywalker legacy. As Luke said himself, he is a Jedi like his father before him. Like his father, Luke was believed to be the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. He shares his father&#39;s strong connection to the Force, and, at least in the original trilogy and Legends, his deep attachments. Luke grapples with this heritage, at times afraid to fall to the dark side as his father did. Ultimately, he is determined to be the Jedi Anakin had been before he fell.




The Skywalker legacy is key to his character, and it changes how he acts as a Jedi. The Mandalorian, however, throws all this out in favor of having him be a traditional Jedi. Rather than understanding the value of healthy attachments and desiring to follow a legacy, The Mandalorian&#39;s Luke Skywalker sticks to the strict rules that contributed to the fall of the Jedi Order in the first place. This is a complete departure from Luke&#39;s character in the original trilogy.



 Luke&#39;s True Nature Explains Why Grogu&#39;s Choice Seemed So Out Of Character 
         

This is why Luke&#39;s ultimatum felt so out of character. Throughout the original trilogy and Legends, Luke was more than just a carbon copy of the first Jedi Order. He carved his own path and refused to make the same mistake about attachments that ultimately destroyed the Jedi. The Mandalorian, however, completely undoes all of this character-building.






Luke was willing to buck Jedi tradition to take care of the people he loved.




It is unfortunate that The Mandalorian&#39;s Luke Skywalker didn&#39;t follow in the footsteps of his original trilogy counterpart. If Luke had recognized the value in attachments the way he did before, he could&#39;ve brought Din Djarin in on Grogu&#39;s training. The three could&#39;ve worked together, and Grogu would&#39;ve become a better Jedi for it. With the combination of Jedi and Mandalorian training, Grogu could&#39;ve become one of the best warriors in the Star Wars universe - but instead, Luke in The Mandalorian continues to be misunderstood.



The Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney&#43;.
