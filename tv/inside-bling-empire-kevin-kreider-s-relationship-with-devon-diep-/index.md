## Literature Review
Bling Empire season 3’s Kevin Kreider reunited with his ex, Devon Diep. Are they still together in 2023?




Bling Empire star Kevin Kreider got back together with Devon Diep, but are they still together in 2023? Devon and Kevin had dated in the past and were reunited again by his Bling Empire co-star, Christine Chiu. Kevin told Christine that he still had feelings for his ex during their trip to Paris Fashion Week. Christine then surprised Kevin by flying Devon to Paris. The two went on a date, and they decided to try their relationship again. While there won&#39;t be a Bling Empire season 4, there&#39;s still investment in Devon and Kevin&#39;s relationship.




Kevin did not have the best luck finding love on the show before. In Bling Empire season 1, the model tried to pursue co-star Kelly Mi Li, but she quickly friend-zoned him. Season 2 saw Kevin moving on with another co-star, DJ Kim Lee, but that did not end well either. In Bling Empire season 3, Kevin went out with a spiritual advisor that Kim Lee introduced to the group before getting back together with Devon. While their relationship was short-lived, things are looking up for the model and actor.

Kevin is still dating Devon, and the two live together in Los Angeles. Kevin revealed the news in an interview with E!, saying, “She moved from Boston to live with me.” Although Kevin let Bling Empire viewers know the process has not been easy since they’ve had to move three times in their six weeks of living together. The situation has made things a little tense for the couple; however, they are still very much in love. Devon recently accompanied Kevin to the opening night of his latest film, Asian Persuasion.






 Reactions From The Bling Empire Cast Were Mixed 
          

However, there were mixed reactions from the cast, especially Kim and unpopular Bling Empire cast member Kane Lim when Christine introduced Devon to them as Kevin’s girlfriend. Kevin mentioned in the interview with E! that he is not as close with Kim as before. The same was said for his relationship with his friends and fellow cast, Kane and Kelly. “I think she&#39;s being slightly more respectful to the relationship now. Kelly and I don&#39;t really talk that much about relationship stuff. I think it&#39;s also true with the dynamic with Kane—I don&#39;t think I feel comfortable talking to him about relationship stuff,” he admitted.

Bling Empire fans watched Kevin try to mend his relationship with his friends Kane, Kim, and Kelly in season 3. Although there were times when Kevin was too dramatic, some of his concerns about their friendship were valid. However, they have since resolved their issues and are back on friendly terms. Regardless, Devon and Kevin are going strong in 2023. In addition to their romance, they started ALLS Productions, which focuses on telling Asian-led love stories.
