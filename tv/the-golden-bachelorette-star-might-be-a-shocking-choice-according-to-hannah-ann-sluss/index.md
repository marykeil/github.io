## Literature Review
Bachelor Nation&#39;s Hannah Ann Sluss has a strong opinion regarding who should be the lead if ABC announces The Golden Bachelorette soon.




Hannah Ann Sluss, winner of The Bachelor season 24, weighed in with her thoughts about a possible spin-off of The Golden Bachelor and shared her pick for the lead of the first-ever Golden Bachelorette. Hannah knows a thing or two about romance, having found her suitor not within Bachelor Nation, but thanks to a message on social media. She is now engaged to the love of her life, Baltimore Ravens running back Jake Funk. Jake slid into Hannah&#39;s DMs in December 2022, and their romance has been written in the stars ever since.




In a recent chat with the U.S. Sun, Hannah said that she has a particular woman in mind for who she hopes will wear the crown of the first Golden Bachelorette if ABC announces the spin-off. Hannah believes Gerry Turner&#39;s runner-up Leslie Fhima would be an excellent choice for The Golden Bachelorette, saying, &#34;I would love it to be Leslie, just because I know her, and I&#39;m rooting for her love story.&#34; However, Hannah actually predicted that the producers will &#34;throw [fans] for a loop&#34; and cast a woman who wasn&#39;t featured on The Golden Bachelor. &#34;I know in the past with The Bachelor, they brought out some other people...who no one knew,&#34; she explained.


 The Golden Bachelorette Speculation Explained 
          

Leslie was a stand-out in the first-ever season of The Golden Bachelor, and from the beginning, it was clear they had something special between them. Of course, Gerry ultimately gave his final rose to Theresa Nist, whom he is set to wed in the coming weeks, and viewers aren&#39;t the only ones looking ahead to the possibility of a Golden Bachelorette leading the charge to finding romance next time around. Many close to Bachelor Nation have shared an interest in continuing the journey of love later in life, and there are passionate pleas as to who should be the one chosen to make history with a debut season.





 

Hannah may not have found her perfect match in ex-fiancÃ© Peter Weber, but she still believes in the possibilities of romance within Bachelor Nation, and she&#39;s not the only one. The Golden Bachelor was such a hit that even host Jesse Palmer is crossing his fingers for a spin-off, and rightfully so. Even producers of Bachelor Nation&#39;s top shows are chiming in regarding their hopes for a spin-off. Variety noted that at The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Producers Guild FYC panel, producer Jason Ehrlich said that a female-led series would make everyone &#34;happy,&#34; which feels like a bit of an understatement.

                  The Golden Bachelor Season 2: Latest News &amp; Everything We Know   The Golden Bachelor season 1 was a huge success, so it&#39;s likely that ABC will bring the show back for another season. Here&#39;s what we know so far.    




While Hannah isn&#39;t alone in dreaming for Leslie to lead the charge, Gerry&#39;s season was full of women that would be great to watch discover their perfect match. Joan Vassos is a fan-favorite whose journey was cut short due to the most heartwarming reason: her need to be home with her family. It would be fantastic to see her find a partner who supports her on her path to romance. Faith Martin also stole the hearts of millions as she opened her heart to love after a divorce and, ultimately, the loss of her first husband.

Also, Sandra Mason didn&#39;t win Gerry&#39;s heart, but she did steal the hearts of anyone tuning into The Golden Bachelor and would be a catch for someone looking for romance. Gerry&#39;s cast of potential suitors was strong on their own, and together, they formed a bond that will never be broken. If (and when) ABC announces The Golden Bachelorette, one thing is certain: the man who falls in love with the leading lady will also have a built-in Bachelor Nation family of supportive women who will undeniably have each other&#39;s back for years to come.
