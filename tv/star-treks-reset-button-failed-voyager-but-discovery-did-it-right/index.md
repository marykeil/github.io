# Star Treks “Reset Button” Failed Voyager But Discovery Did It Right


## SUMMARY 



  Voyager&#39;s episodic storytelling style failed to make a season 2 episode relevant after a spatial anomaly and its data were never explored further.   The failure of &#34;Twisted&#34; was due to poor pacing, confusing structure, and a lack of intrigue, ultimately making it forgettable in Voyager&#39;s canon.   In contrast, Discovery&#39;s serialized storytelling allowed the show to expand on a similar storyline and use it as a tool to further other plots.

## Literature Review
Star Trek&#39;s &#34;reset button&#34; style of storytelling failed a particular Voyager episode, but years later, Discovery avoided making the same mistake.  




The &#34;reset button&#34; style of storytelling failed a season 2 episode of Star Trek: Voyager, but Star Trek: Discovery did the concept justice years later. In a multitude of differences, one of the big ways Voyager and Discovery diverge is how their episodes are structured. Like its predecessors in the franchise, Voyager was fond of episodic storytelling and didn&#39;t feature too many season-long plotlines or story elements that carried from one episode to another. In contrast, Discovery&#39;s serialized season bled easily from one episode to the next, with plot details retaining their relevance across multiple seasons.




Because of this, Voyager and Discovery took very different approaches to a similar storyline in their respective season 2s. In Voyager season 2, episode 6, &#34;Twisted,&#34; a mysterious spatial anomaly surrounded the ship, trapping the crew while passing through and leaving a massive amount of data in the USS Voyager computer banks in its wake. Likewise, in Discovery season 2, episode 4, &#34;An Obol for Charon,&#34; the USS Discovery encountered an ancient, sentient sphere that trapped the ship and imparted all the knowledge it had accumulated over the centuries before it was destroyed. The concept of both storylines is very similar, but &#34;Twisted&#34; failed where &#34;An Obol for Charon&#34; succeeded.

                  Star Trek: Voyager’s Season 1 Finale Was A Mistake   Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s season 1 finale was a mistake for several reasons, and should have been swapped out for a different episode from the series.    


 Star Trek: Voyager’s “Twisted” Failed Thanks To The Reset Button 
          




Because of Voyager&#39;s episodic storytelling style, the spatial anomaly and all its data were completely forgotten after &#34;Twisted&#34; ended, destroying any chance of the show redeeming an otherwise substandard plot. The idea of an alien species using something like the anomaly as a way to communicate was an interesting concept, but this reveal only came in the last few minutes of the episode. Although there was speculation about the aliens&#39; intentions, Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) and Voyager&#39;s crew never made contact with them and what had been in the data they received was never discussed in detail.

This meant that &#34;Twisted&#34; dropped the ball on the only thing that made the episode interesting. Without a further exploration of the anomaly or the aliens who created it, &#34;Twisted&#34; was a poorly paced, confusingly structured mess that lacked any kind of intrigue and is utterly forgettable in Voyager&#39;s canon. The only way to redeem &#34;Twisted&#34; would have been to make the anomaly&#39;s data relevant in future episodes, but unfortunately, the reset button made this impossible. Ultimately, Voyager&#39;s episodic nature was the final failure in a long list of things that went wrong with &#34;Twisted.&#34;






 Star Trek: Discovery’s Serialized Story Didn’t Repeat Voyager’s Mistakes 
          

However, Star Trek: Discovery demonstrated that handling a similar storyline better was possible. Since Discovery&#39;s storytelling style is serialized, the show was able to expand on its Sphere data storyline for multiple episodes. This not only allowed them to use the data as a tool to help further other plots but also led to the creation of Zora (Annabelle Wallis), the sentient AI functioning as Discovery&#39;s computer who became one of the most interesting characters on the show during season 4. Discovery demonstrated that it could learn from Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s mistakes and turned something that could have been a forgettable one-off story into an integral part of its narrative.



Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Discovery are both available to stream on Paramount&#43;. Discovery season 5 will premiere in April 2024.
