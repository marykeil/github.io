## Literature Review
From Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 19 stories ending in a cliffhanger to relationships needing to be set up, season 20 has plenty of storylines to tackle.




Grey’s Anatomy season 20 will have a lot to pack in its abbreviated 10-episode run, as season 19 left plenty of storylines needing to be resolved. With some stories overarching seasons and others newly introduced in Grey’s Anatomy season 19, the medical drama’s 20th season can bring back the focus on romance with which its earliest seasons abounded. Ellen Pompeo’s scaled-down role as Meredith gives Grey’s Anatomy a chance to concentrate even more on its new class of interns first introduced in season 19, with the five already proving they can reach the highs of the original MAGIC’s predicaments in Grey’s Anatomy season 19’s ending.
Some storylines that Grey’s Anatomy season 20 will need to deal with are more time-sensitive than others, especially considering its cliffhanger ending with the patient Sam Sutton dying after Simone and Lucas had started operating on him and Teddy mysteriously collapsing and needing resuscitation. Similarly difficult will be Richard’s situation, as Meredith’s confessions about her Alzheimer’s study rattled him to the point he even ordered an alcoholic drink for himself. Given all the storylines Grey’s Anatomy season 19’s ending set up and those already foreshadowed at least since Grey’s Anatomy season 18, season 20 has the chance to provide crucial answers and forward relationships in a rewarding and entertaining way.
            
 
 Grey&#39;s Anatomy Season 20 Needs To Get 1 Detail Of Meredith&#39;s Return Right 
The upcoming season 20 of ABC&#39;s medical drama Grey&#39;s Anatomy needs to be careful to get one detail of Meredith Grey&#39;s return correct. 













 








 The Interns&#39; Fate After Sam&#39;s Death Needs To Be Revealed 
The punishment for operating on a patient alone must be served despite the dire situation


 







While Grey’s Anatomy season 20’s teaser trailer still showed the interns working at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, it also had Bailey catch Meredith up about their being in trouble. Plenty of interns in Grey Sloan Memorial’s history made lethal mistakes or operated on people when they shouldn’t have, and their actions resulted in dismissals or suspensions. Given the intense way that season 19 ended, Grey’s Anatomy season 20 will have to reveal sooner rather than later what punishment Simone and Lucas in particular must face. Nevertheless, despite Sam Sutton’s death, the hospital might be lenient with them, based on the other medical emergency happening in the room with Teddy’s collapse.





 Teddy&#39;s Sudden Illness &amp; Collapse Must Be Explained 
The aftermath of Teddy&#39;s cardiac arrest can bring back Megan Hunt
        

Grey’s Anatomy season 19’s ending only had Teddy fighting a painful toothache, without any other symptom foreshadowing her collapse. Her mysterious illness not only compromised the surgery that might have saved Sam Sutton, but also forced Yasuda to leave Sam’s care to try and resuscitate Teddy, and her fate was still uncertain by the episode’s end. This leaves Grey’s Anatomy season 20 the burden of explaining what had happened to Teddy that led to her cardiac arrest, along with the aftermath of her medical emergency, even making Megan Hunt’s return possible, as she would want to be close to her and Owen with Teddy’s health suffering a big blow.





 Meredith&#39;s Controversial Alzheimer&#39;s Research Story Cannot Be Abandoned 
The reveals of the Grey’s Anatomy season 19 finale impact too many doctors
        

While Pompeo’s reduced role as Meredith inevitably makes the character’s centrality to Grey’s Anatomy season 20 smaller, her shocking revelations about the state of Alzheimer’s research in the Grey’s Anatomy season 19 finale must be addressed. Her theory about Alzheimer’s shocked Richard and Amelia to their core, with the first categorically refusing to accept that Meredith could make what she found out public, and the second having problems accepting how Meredith’s research insulted decades of medical research, including her brother Derek’s. The implications of Meredith’s study in the wider world of Grey’s Anatomy are so big that season 20 cannot afford to sideline the story.





 Jo &amp; Link&#39;s Relationship Must Be Shaped After Season 19&#39;s Love Declaration 
Their will they/won&#39;t they dynamic spanned too many seasons not to show their relationship


 







Jo and Link’s romantic interest in each other was first introduced in Grey’s Anatomy season 18, when Link was pining over Amelia and Jo ended up falling for him without meaning to, as her feelings greatly complicated their friendship. Their will they/won’t they dynamic persisted, despite Link gradually falling for Jo in secret, as he knew she already had to fight back her feelings to protect what they had. Grey’s Anatomy successfully avoided having them come to terms with their feelings until now as they both pined in secret, but their confession in the Grey’s Anatomy season 19 finale revealed their cards, making season 20 necessarily show their relationship blossoming.

 Richard&#39;s Potential Relapse Cannot Be Ignored After Season 19&#39;s Finale 
The events at the Catherine Fox Award mirror his past relapse on Grey&#39;s Anatomy
        

The turbulence they experienced on the flight to Boston distressed them all, but Richard flat-out admitted that he had been wanting a drink since the moment they landed. Grey’s Anatomy season 19’s finale ended with Richard debating whether to drink the alcoholic beverage he ordered after refusing to go to an AA meeting with Amelia, making it necessary for Grey’s Anatomy season 20 to reveal whether he drank it. Grey’s Anatomy already had Richard relapse in season 6, but even if he didn’t in season 19, he could do so in season 20, especially with the added stress of Meredith’s research, his wife’s cancer, and Maggie far away from Seattle.





 Lucas &amp; Simone&#39;s Relationship Must Be Tackled After Their Impromptu Hookup 
Simone left her fiancé for Lucas, but the two have yet to talk about what it means for them
        

There were many reasons why Simone rightfully stopped her wedding in Grey’s Anatomy season 19’s 2-part finale, but she still went straight to Lucas after leaving her fiancé at the altar. Their hookup right after and Trey’s accident ulteriorly complicated things for them, as they couldn’t really discuss where they stood about how to progress. However, Simone chose to operate on Sam only because Lucas asked her to trust him, and that put their careers on the line. With their already complicated story adding much to their plate, Grey’s Anatomy season 20 will have to reveal how the ordeal left them, and whether their relationship can go forward.





 Miranda&#39;s Catherine Fox Award Win Might Change Things At Grey Sloan 
Miranda’s win might get more talents at Grey’s Anatomy’s hospital
        

Miranda joining the ranks of the Grey’s Anatomy characters winning a Harper Avery with her Catherine Fox award win in the Grey’s Anatomy season 19 finale can mean great things for Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. After Meredith’s Harper Avery win, every resident wanted to be there to learn from her. With Grey Sloan still reeling from the pandemic’s aftermath and the shortage of surgeons, Miranda’s win can finally make Grey Sloan Memorial’s circumstances better, and Grey’s Anatomy season 20 will have to show the difference in the hospital’s standing, hopefully even bringing back more later-years surgical residents besides the interns it already managed to involve.





 Nick &amp; Winston&#39;s Mentorship Of The Interns Must Continue 
They can follow Miranda &amp; Meredith’s steps with the interns’ teachings
        

Nick Marsh and Winston Ndugu similarly moved to Seattle and Grey Sloan Memorial only to be closer to Meredith and Maggie. With the two sisters moving away from Seattle, there wasn’t much for them there anymore, as they had put their careers second place to follow Meredith and Maggie and they weren’t even there anymore. Their involvement with the new class of interns in Grey’s Anatomy season 19 gave them a new purpose and showcased their teaching abilities, proving they could make the interns learn and help them with their issues as Lucas and Nick’s ADHD storyline proved.

Grey&#39;s Anatomy has seen the firing of various doctors, of which only a few have been given a second chance – and here&#39;s what happened to them.




Grey’s Anatomy season 20 can finally let Nick and Winston’s careers soar as teachers, making them as important in the interns’ lives as Meredith and Miranda were when they taught residents. This way, Nick and Winston could finally earn their own success even at Grey Sloan Memorial, somewhere they would have never moved to had it not been for Meredith and Maggie, building up on their already successful teachings in Grey’s Anatomy season 19.





 Grey&#39;s Anatomy Season 20 Can Bring Back The Shepherds Sisters To Seattle 
Amelia &amp; Lucas’ lives in Seattle can be the reason to return
        

Derek and Amelia’s sisters all appeared throughout Grey’s Anatomy’s nineteen seasons, whether to offer Derek advice or to spend time with Amelia on her work trip to New York in Grey’s Anatomy season 15. With Grey’s Anatomy season 19 spending much time detailing Simone’s family, Grey’s Anatomy season 20 could warrant the Shepherds sisters’ return to the show, especially with Lucas being Amelia and Derek’s nephew. This would be particularly interesting because of Lucas’ status as the Shepherds’ black sheep like Amelia, making his mother’s visit to Seattle not only finally reveal her identity but also revive the dramatic dynamics with Amelia that Grey’s Anatomy season 15 highlighted.
