## Literature Review
According to some social media clues, Big Ed and Liz Woods from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise have finally ended their tumultuous relationship.




Big Ed Brown from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise may have split from Liz Woods after marrying her a few months ago. The 58-year-old man’s journey with the single mother began in 2021. At the time, he joined 90 Day: The Single Life and tried to build something meaningful with her. While Ed and Liz seemed like a controversial couple, they continued their relationship for years. The couple dealt with trust issues and a massive age gap but kept dating each other in different spin-offs.




In 2023, Ed and Liz chose to reconsider their future and make a decision. They joined 90 Day: The Last Resort to try out therapy and resolve the remaining issues that plagued their relationship. During the new spin-off, Ed and Liz discovered the problems that kept them from settling down. The San Diego man learned that his juvenile personality made him look like he didn’t care. Similarly, Liz realized that she needed to be more confident and less passive with Ed. After filming the finale, the couple planned to build a new life in Arkansas and reportedly married each other.

Ed and Liz made things work and apparently tied the knot in time. However, their newer social media posts and stories hint they may have split up already. In November 2023, Liz posted an Instagram story of herself having a “date night” with someone. She didn’t post Ed’s picture but shared a photo of her date’s hand. She posted another story from her table. Liz shared a picture of her beverage, which showed another man sitting in front of her who didn’t look like her partner, Ed.




Social media users discussed Liz’s Instagram story on Reddit. A Redditor commented (via cuddlyturtle945), “that relationship was so toxic,” and thanked God that it was over. Another wrote, “she deserves to be happy, and Ed was just dragging her down,” adding that Liz must feel relieved that he’s gone. Liz hasn’t posted an update with Ed for a while. Therefore, it’s possible that she has split from her beau and decided to date someone her age. Ed and Liz were in different phases of their lives, so it would make sense if she had left him.

 Big Ed Spends Time With Friends Without Liz 
         

Most married pairs often have a common friend circle. However, Ed and Liz have only posted photos of themselves hanging out with different people lately. Ed shared a cuddly photo with a female friend on Instagram a few days ago. He called her one of her “buddies” but appeared a bit too close to her in the pictures. Social media users quickly noted Ed’s actions and asked why he held the other woman’s arm. However, the reality TV star didn’t share an answer. The lack of response hints that he is probably afraid to tell the truth due to contractual obligations.

Liz has also been hanging out with other male friends. In October 2023, she shared a cute and cuddly picture with co-star Tyray Mollett. The two met somewhere in San Diego, where they celebrated Tyray’s birthday around Halloween. Liz and her co-star wore matching white and black outfits that seemed to be the day’s theme. They also appeared cozy in the photos, which they both reposted on their social media accounts. Most surprisingly, Ed was nowhere in the birthday party pictures. Liz’s partner never shared anything that would hint he attended the celebration.

While Liz and Tyray haven’t posted anything that implies the nature of their friendship, they would probably make a great couple. Liz always wanted a man who’d appreciate her and could be an excellent father figure to her only daughter. Tyray is certainly a perfect fit for that. The young man is in his mid-30s and close to Liz’s age. He’s also passive and understanding, as proven by his relationship journey on the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. If Tyray could do what he did for a catfish who never met him, he probably would do much more for Liz if they ever got into a relationship.






 Big Ed &amp; Liz Aren’t In Arkansas As Planned 
         

When Ed and Liz joined 90 Day: The Last Resort, they told viewers they planned to settle in Arkansas for a fresh start. Some photos also showed that they were, in fact, in the U.S. state and getting some official work done. However, the pair isn’t in Big Ed’s hometown anymore. They’ve been posting photos and videos from San Diego again, which suggests their marriage didn’t work out. Liz shared pictures of her hair makeover from a San Diego-based salon a few months ago. She shared another video from the same place in September 2023.

Like Liz, Ed has been sharing content from outside of Arkansas as well. The recent posts either prove that the pair moved back to San Diego together because they didn’t enjoy their new lives in Arkansas or ended their marriage and began living their single lives in San Diego again. Logically, it would make sense that the couple couldn’t make their lives work in Arkansas. Liz’s daughter’s school and job have been in San Diego for years. So it would be understandable if she had returned to her city.






 Liz Has Stopped Sharing Candid Photos With Big Ed 
         

When Ed and Liz were in love, they posted real-time moments with each other on social media. The San Diego couple talked about each other like any normal pair would. Ed discussed how Liz assisted him during his surgery and even dressed as a nurse to impress him. Similarly, Liz shared a cozy video calling Ed and herself two peas in a pod. Most of the pair’s recent content has been about themselves and their lives. Their only posts together seem to be promotional content from different 90 Day Fiancé spin-offs.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
