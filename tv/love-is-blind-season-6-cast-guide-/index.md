## Literature Review

Love Is Blind season 6 is just around the corner and Netflix has released 30 brand-new singles who will be trying to find love sight unseen.




Love Is Blind season 6 is just weeks away, and with so little time before the premiere, Netflix has finally revealed the brand-new cast who will be taking on the experiment. As participants in Love Is Blind look to find love in the most unlikely of circumstances, the Netflix series only continues to grow. Though the series has been facing some hardships after past contestants have taken legal action regarding their experiences, Love Is Blind has been working behind the scenes to continue to create the groundbreaking show. Hosted by Nick and Vanessa Lachey, the reality TV dating series asks its participants to take a leap of faith.




While Love Is Blind season 5 was disappointing, many are hopeful the brand-new cast for the next season will be worthwhile. Love Is Blind season 6 was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina. A group of 30 singles came together to try dating in the pods. Asking the participants to date one another intensively without any distractions, connections will form quickly, and the couples will reach a place of emotional intimacy far earlier in their relationship than they would otherwise. Viewers of the series hope that Love Is Blind season 6’s cast will be a great one.
