## Literature Review
Peacemaker will move from the DCEU to the new DC Universe for season 2, and James Gunn has just debunked a major multiverse theory for the series.




James Gunn has debunked a Peacemaker season 2 multiverse theory. Peacemaker will move from the DCEU to Gunn&#39;s new DC Universe. As it stands, it seems like none of the DCU&#39;s upcoming movies will try to explain the universe change for some characters, and based on Gunn&#39;s recent response to a fan theory, Peacemaker season 2 is unlikely to make a big deal of the DC Universe shift as well.




On Threads, Gunn responded to a fan that said Peacemaker should be the only DCU character to remember the old DCEU; however, Gunn was not a fan of the idea.

          

According to the DC Studios co-CEO, he does not want Peacemaker&#39;s universe shift from the DCEU to the new DCU to have such a major focus on the story. While Gunn previously said that Peacemaker season 2&#39;s story would make sense of the universe change, it seems like Cena&#39;s character will not be holding on to the DCEU.

                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Far    James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.    


 How Peacemaker Season 2 Could Explain The DC Universe Shift 
          




With Gunn having said that he &#34;wouldn’t want the universe shift to be that big a part of the story&#34; of Cena&#39;s anti-hero, then Peacemaker season 2 will most likely have nothing to do with the multiverse. While DC recently used the concept of the multiverse in a major way in The Flash movie, it is for the best that Peacemaker season 2 finds another way to address its universe change. While the first season of the series was not really grounded, the multiverse would be a step too far for Peacemaker and his team&#39;s talents.

When speaking about his decision not to reboot Peacemaker but give it a season 2, Gunn revealed that he has &#34;a way in&#34; for the story amid the series&#39; shifting universes. As Gunn does not intend to make a big deal out of the DCEU being rebooted with the new DC Universe in the series, Peacemaker season 2 has a better path to explain its new condition. That idea would fit Peacemaker&#39;s comedy style.

The best way Peacemaker season 2 could deal with the change in DC universes is to address it quickly in a deadpan way when the new season premieres. Cena&#39;s Peacemaker does not need to be aware of the universe shift for it to work, with a simple Gunn-style scene similar to the &#34;It&#39;s me. I&#39;m here. Deal with it&#34; introduction of Don Cheadle as the new Rhodey in Iron Man 2 that worked out fine for Marvel back in the day. That way, Peacemaker season 2 could address its new DC Universe status while not impacting the story Gunn wants to tell and getting a few laughs along the way.






Peacemaker season 2 currently has no release date set.
