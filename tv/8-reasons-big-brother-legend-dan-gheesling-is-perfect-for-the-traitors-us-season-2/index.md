## Literature Review
Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling is going to be on The Traitors US season 2, and his BB experiences make him the perfect candidate for the series.




The Traitors US season 2 is just around the corner, and Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling is a perfect fit for the series whether he’s named a traitor or left a faithful. Dan’s time on Big Brother ended nearly a decade ago, but his prowess in the game still has viewers discussing his time on the series long after. Dan came into his first season, Big Brother 10, hoping to play the game as under the radar as possible and was able to pull out a win by playing down his competitive abilities and manipulating everyone whenever possible. He returned on Big Brother 14, coming in second place.
While Dan isn’t Big Brother’s first two-time winner, he came as close as anyone has to achieving something that seems impossible. The strategy for Dan’s first season of the series has been adapted and replicated repeatedly, so his strategy for Big Brother 14 had to shift tremendously as the players in the game had already seen him hide his competitive abilities. Dan took on Big Brother 14 with a more cut-throat approach. While he made it to the final 2, his game decisions created a bitter jury. Dan is among the most well-equipped players on The Traitors US season 2.

 Dan&#39;s Strategic Prowess Was Unmatched On Big Brother 
His Time On BB 10 and BB 14 Made Him A Legend


 







As a newcomer on Big Brother 10, Dan was excited to play the game. His initial strategy was to do whatever it took, including making himself look weak and throwing his allies under the bus. While many felt his first season was a masterclass in Big Brother, Dan’s second season on the series put his back against the wall and showcased his skills even further. A master of manipulation, Dan held his own funeral during Big Brother 14 when he was nominated and talked his way out of being evicted more than once. Known as one of the best to ever play the game, Dan is a true BB legend.





 Dan&#39;s Been Off Reality TV For A Decade 
Many Won&#39;t Know About Dan&#39;s Tricks &amp; Tactics
        

Although Dan is one of the best to ever play Big Brother, he chose to leave reality TV after BB 14. Not only did he have to deal with the backlash from the jury of BB 14, who were impressed by his tactics but were hurt overall, his strategies were no longer usable in the game. Dan chose to step back from reality TV and has focused on his family and his career as a streamer for nearly a decade. While there are many BB fans in the reality TV world, many of the cast members of The Traitors US season 2 are unlikely to have seen Dan in action.





 Dan&#39;s Relationships With BB &amp; Survivor Cast Members Are A Benefit 
He Has The Strategic Players On His Side
        

While many of the newer reality TV stars on The Traitors US season 2 are unlikely to either know or want to align with Dan, the connections he already has coming into the game could be incredibly valuable to him. Dan has known Survivor legends Sandra Diaz-Twine and Parvati Shallow for years. The most strategic minds in Survivor history could be helpful for him in the game. On top of the Survivor connections, Dan is playing The Traitors US with Janelle Pierzina, who was on BB 14 with him. While they weren’t exactly aligned in the house, Dan and Janelle will likely try to use their history to their advantage.





 Dan Came Back To Reality TV To Win 
He&#39;ll Do Whatever It Takes To Bring Home The Money


 







Dan’s time away from reality TV was meant to be permanent, but he chose to come back for The Traitors US because of his love for strategy. While Dan may have been out of the reality TV game for years, he’s returning for the love of the game and knows he can win from a strategic perspective. As a married man with three children, Dan’s coming into The Traitors US season 2 in a very different situation than his last time on a reality TV competition series. Even though he’s been away for quite some time, Dan will do whatever it takes to bring home the money for his family.





 Dan&#39;s Ruthless Gameplay Will Carry Him Far On The Traitors 
He&#39;ll Be Able To Lie And Backstab Anyone


Throughout Dan’s appearances on Big Brother, he dealt with a huge group of houseguests who he has had to backstab or double-cross at one time or another. Dan’s behavior throughout Big Brother 10 and Big Brother 14 was fascinating because he did everything in his power to ensure that he made it to the end and didn’t care if that meant using or manipulating others. As a phenomenal liar, Dan’s been able to utilize his skills in strategy games in the past, and knowing he&#39;ll be able to lie to anyone’s face on The Traitors US season 2 means he’ll have an even better chance of going far.





 Dan Knows How To Socially Manipulate People 
His Time On Big Brother Prepared Him To Play
        

While Dan’s ability to lie is a huge asset, his manipulation tactics are truly what The Traitors US season 2 cast should be watching out for. During his time on Big Brother 10, Dan manipulated to the end of the game, aligning with Memphis Garrett because he knew he could get the more aggressive player to do all his dirty work and hide in the background. On Big Brother 14, Dan had to use his manipulation tactics even further, pulling off one of the most phenomenal blindsides in the history of Big Brother when he convinced a fellow houseguest to take him off the block only to evict her showmance.





 Dan&#39;s Pre-Show Strategy Was A Secret To Everyone 
He Stumped Journalists &amp; His Cast Mates
        

During his pre-season interview with Parade, Dan spoke minimally about how he planned to behave within the game. Instead, Dan chose to focus on the level of talent in the rest of the cast, speaking highly about his fellow cast mates who were present for the interview on a panel. Dan, who is great when it comes to social strategy, knew that it was a terrible move to speak about his own strategy in front of his competition. He shared, after his cast mates had left, that he knew better than to speak about his strategy to anyone, especially The Traitors US season 2 cast.





 Dan&#39;s An Incredible Reality TV Personality 
He Knows How To Play &amp; Explain His Game On Screen
        

While Dan’s tactics and overall strategy make him a huge asset to the game, his contribution to The Traitors US season 2 won’t just be his gameplay. Dan’s a tried and true reality TV personality and understands how to explain his decisions in real-time, which makes him a huge asset to reality TV as a whole. Dan’s reality TV career has been built on his ability to openly share his tactics in interview segments while audiences are able to watch them play out on screen. With his personality a great asset for reality TV, his time on The Traitors US season 2 is sure to be fun to watch.
