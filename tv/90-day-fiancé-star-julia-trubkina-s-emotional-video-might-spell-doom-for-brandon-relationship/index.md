## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Julia Trubkina is crying on her Instagram Stories again. The Russian cast member, however, is not telling her fans what happened.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Julia Trubkina crying in her recent cryptic social media post suggests she and Brandon Gibbs could be headed towards a divorce. Julia is a Russian 90 Day Fiancé cast member from Krasnodar. She worked as a go-go dancer when Brandon, who&#39;s from Virginia, was introduced to her. Julia moved to the U.S. in 90 Day Fiancé season 8. She began living on Brandon&#39;s farm, where the couple got zero privacy thanks to Brandon&#39;s parents. Julia and Brandon got married and moved out but have since faced several challenges in their life off-camera. Julia faced a deportation threat, while she and Brandon argued about her job and baby plans.




Although Julia has not been a part of 90 Day Fiancé for more than a year, she keeps her fans updated via Instagram. She shares the highs and lows of her life on her account, but most of Julia&#39;s recent Stories have suggested she&#39;s unhappy in her life. Julia recently shared a crying selfie captioned, &#34;Do you want to hear a funny story? When I calm down I&#39;ll tell you,&#34; (as shared by Miz_momo82 on Reddit).


 

Julia seemingly received a lot of messages from her followers, which made her post another video that showed her crying. She said, &#34;I have a thousand messages now. So...I&#39;m not okay, I&#39;m not okay. I&#39;m just down.&#34; Julia wept as she explained she was feeling &#34;down&#34; and asked her fans to let her calm down.





 Will Julia Trubkina Ever Return To 90 Day Fiancé? 
          

Julia assured her followers that she would tell them &#34;everything&#34; that happened. She thanked those asking her if she was okay. However, Julia refused to tell them about her problems. She revealed she would talk to them the next day after a break. Julia wiped her tears and told her fans she would be &#34;back tomorrow&#34; with the answers. In July 2022, Julia claimed she was &#34;cut&#34; from the franchise. However, she did appear on 90 Day Diaries with Brandon the same year.

The episodes showed Brandon and Julia leaving the nest and trying to build a new life in Florida. The couple, however, did not follow through with their plans. In November 2022, Julia and Brandon bought their first house in Virginia. Meanwhile, Julia claimed her Green Card was about to expire and there was a possibility that she could be deported. Earlier this year, someone broke into Brandon&#39;s work car and stole important documents. Julia also faced disapproval from Brandon himself when she decided to relaunch her dancing career.




Brandon said Julia going against his wishes would not have a positive impact on their marriage. They also publicly disagreed about having a baby in the future. Julia declared she would never have kids, while Brandan said they could become parents. Julia has a lot to reveal, but she might want to keep some of her personal life stories under wraps. Since she&#39;s not on camera anymore, she might not see a point in sharing such details online. However, when she posts videos of herself sobbing in the dark, it&#39;s natural for speculation to spread about her well-being.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
