## Literature Review
Tumi Mhlongo has performed poorly as the Chief Stew of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 so far, despite the excitement that preceded her addition.




Tumi Mhlongo&#39;s performances have been unimpressive as Chief Stew in Below Deck Mediterranean season 8. Tumi&#39;s announcement as the Chief Stew of Below Deck Med season 8 was met with excitement after her stellar performance on Below Deck Down Under. However, allowing outside noise to dictate her feelings towards Natalya Scudder, who deputized for Tumi before the South African joined the show, was an early unfavorable indication of Tumi&#39;s preparedness for the Chief Stew role in Below Deck Med season 8.




Besides her tough relationship with Natalya, Tumi&#39;s lack of leadership awareness has also affected cast members like Lily Davison, who could do with a leader who cares about teaching her subordinates. Tumi&#39;s knack for getting involved in gossip also enabled Kyle Viljoen to influence her effectiveness on the show. Still, there have been certain occurrences that have defined Tumi&#39;s underwhelming performance in Below Deck Mediterranean season 8.

 Tumi Doesn&#39;t Manage Her Team Well 
         

Tumi took on her Chief Stew role on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 after an impressive and professional performance as a second Stew on Below Deck Down Under. However, while Tumi was expected to thrive in her new role after her showings on Below Deck Down Under, Tumi has noticeably struggled to manage her team. During her short reign, there have been reports of unchecked bullying which has led to a Stew&#39;s exit. Tumi also has a chaotic relationship with some of the Stews, all of which are unbecoming of a Chief Stew.






 Tumi Didn&#39;t Protect Natalya From Kyle 
          

As Chief Stew, one of Tumi&#39;s most important duties is to protect her subordinates and try to remain impartial and neutral while trying to judge her co-workers based on others&#39; opinions or gossip. However, Tumi failed spectacularly in this regard, especially when it involved dealing with Natalya. Tumi had already made up her mind about Natalya before meeting her based on the bad things Kyle had said about Natalya. Instead of trying to get to know Natalya, Tumi was unnecessarily cold towards Natalya, which meant the two got off on the wrong foot.

Tumi also frequently welcomed Kyle&#39;s gossip about Natalya and when she witnessed Kyle bullying Natalya, Tumi, as Chief Stew, did nothing to stop it. Kyle’s bullying of Natalya, calling her a “fake-ass b**ch,” eventually led to Natalya’s early exit from the show. As Chief Stew, losing a stew midway through the season due to bullying allegations which Tumi could’ve easily stopped but didn’t is a neglect of her duties.






 She Almost Fired Lily For No Reason 
          

Lily joined the Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 crew as Natalya&#39;s replacement. Lily&#39;s inexperience as a Stew was a known fact before she joined the crew and, as Chief Stew, it instantly became Tumi&#39;s duty to show Lily the ropes and mentor her on what working in the interior of a yacht entails. However, after placing Lily in the laundry room, Tumi didn’t take any time out to train Lily properly. Still, when Lily&#39;s lack of effectiveness started affecting the crew, instead of trying to encourage and help Lily, Tumi instead advised Captain Sandy to sack Lily.

Thankfully, Captain Sandy decided to give Lily another chance as she recognized Lily’s inexperience and also appreciated Lily&#39;s efforts in trying to improve. Despite not being the Chief Stew, Jess is the only one who puts in the effort to teach Lily what Tumi wouldn&#39;t. Tumi&#39;s decision to call for Lily&#39;s sacking instead of trying to help her is another indication of her lack of leadership skills.






 Below Deck Med Fans Don&#39;t Want Tumi To Return As Chief Stew 

 

Despite being one of the most-liked cast members of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, Tumi&#39;s lack of leadership skills has been very evident throughout the season. Although her appearance on the show has brought drama and entertainment, Below Deck Med fans believe she would do better on the show without occupying a leadership position. A Reddit user u/PilotNo312 wrote, “She wasn’t ready to be a chief IMO. She needs more time to build her self-confidence, she seems really unsure of herself and unsteady in a leadership role.” Despite her underwhelming performance as Chief Stew so far, Tumi still has a couple of episodes left to change fans&#39; minds about her leadership style on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8.



Below Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 pm EST on Bravo.
