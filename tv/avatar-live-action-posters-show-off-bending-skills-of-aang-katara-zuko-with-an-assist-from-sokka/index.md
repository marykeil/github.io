## Literature Review

New character posters for Netflix&#39;s live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender show highlight the skills of Katara, Sokka, Aang, and Prince Zuko.




Avatar: The Last Airbender posters show off the skills of the main characters. Netflix&#39;s upcoming live-action adaptation of the iconic Nickelodeon animated show takes place in a world where certain people are &#34;benders&#34; with the ability to telekinetically manipulate one of the four elements. The titular Avatar Aang (Gordon Cormier) is a special case and must harness his abilities to bend all four elements on an adventure with his friends, siblings Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), in order to prevent the Fire Nation from dominating the world, all while evading the clutches of the disgraced Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu).




On the official Netflix Twitter account for the show, four character posters for the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender show have been revealed. All four boast the tagline &#34;Master Your Element&#34; and feature the characters showcasing their skills. In addition to Katara waterbending, Aang airbending, and Prince Zuko firebending, Sokka is shown brandishing his signature boomerang. Check out the four new character posters below:

         


 There&#39;s More to the Avatar: The Last Airbender Posters Than Just the Characters 
          

As these posters show, the skillsets of the core Avatar: The Last Airbender cast is very important to the journey ahead of them. Their specific bending abilities or lack thereof dictate many differences in the ways they are able to move through the world. They also act as metaphors for the characters&#39; approaches to life, including Zuko&#39;s fiery rage and determination, Aang&#39;s need to explore beyond the bounds of his experience, and Katara&#39;s adaptability.






In the timeline of the show, Aang has been imprisoned in ice for a century before having the opportunity to learn any bending skills beyond airbending.




However, these new posters also offer small glimpses into some of the live-action settings that will be seen throughout the Last Airbender show. Aang, Katara, and Zuko&#39;s backgrounds are somewhat predictable given their characters, showcasing the ice from which Aang is released after 100 years, Katara&#39;s water tribe village, and a burning town, seemingly set ablaze by Zuko. However, unlike his sister, Sokka&#39;s poster does not seem to take place in his home village.

Instead, Ousley seems to be in front of a row of buildings on Kyoshi Island, where the trio meets the warrior Suki (Maria Zhang). This references the fact that the time they spend on Kyoshi Island is influential on Sokka&#39;s development, because it is where he learns to harness his skills as a warrior and better respect the power of women, as well as kindle a romantic spark with Suki. By including this detail, Netflix&#39;s Avatar: The Last Airbender seems to be indicating that it will be bringing this pivotal element of his arc to life in the new update.
