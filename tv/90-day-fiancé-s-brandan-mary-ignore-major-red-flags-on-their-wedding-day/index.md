## Literature Review
Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay are finally getting married in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 amid their fights and split rumors.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 couple Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay are ignoring signs from the universe asking them not to get married. Brandan and Mary, both 23, debuted as reality TV stars in 2023. Their storyline grabbed eyeballs because of how co-dependent they were on each other during their long-distance relationship. Mary, who&#39;s from the Philippines, used to join Oregon resident Brandan on video calls. These calls continued for 24 hours, every night and day, even when they were sleeping. While audiences may have thought Mary and Brandan would break up before the wedding, they&#39;ve somehow proved everyone wrong.




However, Brandan and Mary&#39;s wedding has several red flags that they have to overcome, as revealed by People. A preview clip from The Other Way season 5 shows Brandan at his picturesque wedding venue. He doesn&#39;t know any of the wedding guests as they are Mary&#39;s friends and family. As Brandan&#39;s mom, Angela, walks him down to the arbor, he talks about what he&#39;s feeling at the moment. Brandan admits he&#39;s &#34;very nervous&#34; because he has been unable to decipher what&#39;s been going on in Mary&#39;s head. Meanwhile, Mary was nervous herself since she wished Bradan had talked to her and assured her that everything was going to be all right.

As she steps out of her room in her full bridal attire, Mary tells the cameras that she&#39;s decided not to think about the fights she&#39;s had with Brandan. Instead, she is trying to think about being happy with him. She smiles as she admits she gets butterflies in her stomach when Brandan hugs her. It tells her that their love is real. &#34;So I&#39;m gonna marry him,&#34; Mary adds. Brandan smiles from ear to ear as he sees his bride approaching him. &#34;She&#39;s got this beautiful dress on, makeup done, hair did. I&#39;m just like, wow. This is such a beautiful woman right here,&#34; he says during his confessional.


 

Mary&#39;s princess-like transformation is not the only thing that surprises Brandan on his wedding day. Brandan says that he had let Mary do all the wedding planning. Her brother Romar informs Brandan that their wedding is going to be officiated by a local celebrity. The town&#39;s mayor, named Ray, is going to marry Brandan and Mary. The realization shocks Brandan. He was perhaps impressed with the level of planning that Mary had put into the ceremony. However, Brandan and Mary&#39;s wedding day is not going to be a happy affair.




A different preview for the next episode shows that Brandan and Mary will have to deal with a natural calamity. Brandan suddenly spots a &#34;fog&#34; rolling in but then realizes it&#39;s not fog but bugs. &#34;There&#39;s hundreds of bugs everywhere,&#34; he adds. They did brave the bugs and got married eventually in April 2023. However, Mary and Brandan sparked split rumors recently. She is still bothered by Brandan obsessively playing video games and refusing to help her make money. Mary, who recently welcomed her first baby with Brandan, is currently looking for call center jobs but doesn&#39;t have enough resources to buy a laptop, which is a work-from-home job requirement.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
