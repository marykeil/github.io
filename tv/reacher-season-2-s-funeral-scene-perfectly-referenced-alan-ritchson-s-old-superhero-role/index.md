Summary

  Alan Ritchson&#39;s portrayal of Reacher in the Amazon series has been a huge success, capturing the character&#39;s hulking presence and intelligence.   In episode 5 of Reacher season 2, there is an Aquaman reference, connecting to Ritchson&#39;s past role as the superhero in Smallville.   Ritchson has a history in the superhero genre, including playing Hank Hall in Titans.  







It was inevitable really, but Reacher has finally referenced Alan Ritchson&#39;s superhero past. Once it was decided that the Tom Cruise Jack Reacher movies wouldn&#39;t continue, the property was rebooted by Amazon as a TV series. Of course, that meant finding a new actor to embody the hulking presence of the title character himself. After an involved audition process that saw performers such as Teddy Sears try out for the role, it was Alan Ritchson who won out.

Ritchson has proven to be perfect casting, capturing the character&#39;s keen intelligence and almost alien-like nature. The adaptation has been a huge success for Amazon, with Reacher season 3 already greenlit, while Ritchson himself has secured roles in the Fast &amp; Furious movies and Guy Ritchies&#39; upcoming The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. He will most likely be sticking with the role of Jack Reacher for the foreseeable future too.

 Reacher Episode 5 Dropped A Major Aquaman Reference 
          

He may not have headlined a comic book movie yet, but Ritchson has a couple of superhero parts to his name. This includes a recurring stint as Arthur Curry/Aquaman in Smallville. Aquaman was one of Ritchson&#39;s first big roles and showcased both his charisma and buff physique. The showrunners behind Reacher were clearly waiting for the right time to deliver an Aquaman easter egg on their show, with the fifth episode &#34;Burial&#34; dropping a surprisingly emotional one.



Alan Ritchson&#39;s Smallville episodes are &#34;Aqua,&#34; &#34;Justice,&#34; &#34;Oddysey&#34; and &#34;Patriot.&#34;







This sees the remnants of the 110th Special Investigators unit attending the funeral of their murdered pal Franz (Luke Bilyk). This is where Reacher witnesses Detective Russo (Domenick Lombardozzi) gift a superhero toy to Franz&#39;s young son, Mikey. Russo then delivers an emotional monologue about Aquaman being his favorite superhero as a boy; he thought it was &#34;so cool&#34; the way he could talk to fish because Russo wanted to talk with his dog. Of course, Ritchson gets some screentime as Aquaman is namedropped.



 Alan Ritchson&#39;s DC Superhero Past Explained 
          

Smallville&#39;s Aquaman was a good showcase for Ritchson, but he ultimately only played the character a handful of times on the show. It appeared Ritchson might get his own Aquaman spinoff, though the network ultimately decided they didn&#39;t want overt ties to Smallville with this new show. Instead, Justin Hartley was cast in the titular role for a pilot that ultimately failed to lead to a series. Jason Momoa would ultimately get cast in the role for the DCU, with he and Ritchson later co-starring together in Fast X.




After Smallville, Ritchson went on to projects like Blue Mountain State and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. Ritchson returned to the superhero genre with Titans, playing Hank Hall (AKA Hawk). A football player turned vigilante, Titans was another great showcase for Ritchson and is much closer to his work in Reacher than the campiness of Smallville. With his growing Reacher fanbase, it&#39;s probably a matter of time before he gets to lead a superhero movie himself. Rumors have linked Ritchson to Batman in The Brave and the Bold, set in the rebooted DC continuity, though this has yet to be confirmed.
