## Literature Review
On Big Brother Reindeer Games, Taylor sent Nicole into Santa&#39;s showdown instead of Xavier, going against Frankie and her women&#39;s alliance.




Taylor Hale, a contestant on the popular Big Brother spin-off, Big Brother Reindeer Games, made a big move during the fifth episode of the series that could cost her the game. When the former Miss Michigan won Big Brother 24, she became the first Black woman to win a regular season of the series. She was also the first houseguest to win both the game and the America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest prize, awarding her an additional $50,000. With a total cash prize of $800,000, she has won the most money of any houseguest in the history of the series.




Taylor is a strong favorite to win the $100,000 Big Brother Reindeer Games cash prize. Her bold gameplay during Monday night&#39;s episode forced her to go back on agreements with several contestants, throwing her women&#39;s alliance into question. The risky move could end up costing her the whole game.

 Taylor Broke Her Agreement With Frankie Grande 
          

The episode began with Frankie Grande winning a Naughty But Nice challenge, which allowed him to choose his team for the Jingle Bell Brawl. He chose Taylor, and they won the brawl, which came with immunity from the next elimination. They also won the power to pick the two people who would compete in Santa&#39;s Showdown for a chance to stay in the game. They each got to choose one player and agreed to choose the men, Josh Martiner and Xavier Prather. However, at the last minute, Taylor sent Nicole Franzel-Arroyo against Josh, a move Frankie is unlikely to forget.






 Nicole Was Taylor&#39;s Ally 
          

Taylor was in a women&#39;s alliance with Nicole, Brittney Godwin, and Danielle Hendriks, who went home due to a blindside last week. It was another shocking moment when Taylor announced that she&#39;d be sending Nicole in to compete in Santa&#39;s Showdown against Josh. The endurance challenge involved both players hanging on to giant bucking candy canes for dear life. Though Josh is much stronger than the smaller Nicole, he fell off his candy cane a split second before she did and got sent home. Nicole lives to play on but is unlikely to put much faith in her alliance with Taylor moving forward.



 How The Move Could Work Out For Taylor 
          




Keeping Xavier around to help her beat Frankie may be Taylor&#39;s best shot at winning. Frankie is a powerhouse player who looks to be in firm control of the game. He is strong at challenges, having won two brawls and two showdowns. For Taylor to have any chance to win Big Brother Reindeer Games, she would need help taking him down. Brittney and Nicole have won fewer challenges, so they might not be as useful to her game as the much stronger Xavier.



Big Brother Reindeer Games airs on Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Fridays on CBS.
