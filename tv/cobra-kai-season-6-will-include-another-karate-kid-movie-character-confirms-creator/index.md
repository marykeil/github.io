## Literature Review
Cobra Kai creator Jon Hurwitz confirms that season 6 will include another character from the Karate Kid movies, but he won&#39;t confirm who.




Another The Karate Kid character is going to appear in Cobra Kai season 6. The show is a martial arts series that serves as a follow-up to the original 1984 The Karate Kid movie and its many sequels. It has been a critical hit and even survived a transition from YouTube to Netflix, where it became wildly successful in drawing viewership for the streaming platform. It has even become one of the rare shows to achieve a season 6 on Netflix.




Cobra Kai features many returning characters from The Karate Kid, but some are still waiting to return. When prompted during a Q&amp;A, co-creator Jon Hurtwitz opened up about their potential reprisals.


 

Hurtwitz confirmed that &#34;at least one&#34; character from the franchise, who has not yet appeared in Cobra Kai, will be making their debut. While he is unwilling to confirm which character or actor, he is still happy to tease the return.


 Who Might Appear In Cobra Kai Season 6? 
          

While many members of The Karate Kid&#39;s cast have already appeared, five seasons haven&#39;t been enough to flesh out every figure of importance. The hawk from Hurtwitz&#39; tweet is one of the characters who hasn&#39;t appeared at all, but there are still some humans waiting for the prime chance to return in Cobra Kai season 6.






All episodes of Cobra Kai are available on Netflix. Season 6 is expected to premiere in 2024.




Snake and Dennis, who both appeared in The Karate Kid Part III are certainly possibilities. Both played fairly important roles in supporting Mike, who has already appeared in Cobra Kai. Mike proved that he was capable of changing for the better, but Snake and Dennis have never had the opportunity and could be prime candidates for a return. Dugan from The Next Karate Kid is another candidate. He was a central antagonist who suffered a massive defeat at Mr. Miyagi&#39;s hand.

                  The Best Win Every Main Character Has In Cobra Kai &amp; The Karate Kid Movies   The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai main characters have all claimed a variety of great victories, but each has one that stands out among the rest.     

Freddy Fernandez is another option. While he technically appeared in a flashback in season 1, episode 9, &#34;Different but Same&#34;, he has not yet appeared as a modern character during the show. Julie Pierce has similarly never appeared, though she has been hinted at indirectly in previous episodes. Whoever it is that Hurtwitz is alluding to, they will finally be reprising their role in Cobra Kai season 6.
