## Literature Review
Michael was jilted at the altar by a runaway bride in Married At First Sight season 17, but the experts found him a new stranger to marry.




Married At First Sight season 17 included a runaway bride for the first time in the history of the series. Michael was waiting at the altar for his bride, wearing the crown and sword she gifted him before the ceremony. The woman, whose face was never shown, made her way down the aisle only to say that she didn&#39;t think she could do this before running away.




A few episodes later, during the mid-season trailer for Married At First Sight season 17, the experts and producers offered Michael another bride and a second shot at finding love with a stranger. Though the teaser didn&#39;t show his answer, it would appear that Michael agreed to give it another try. According to publicly available information, Michael did ultimately get married, and here&#39;s what&#39;s known about Michael&#39;s new bride.

 Who Does Michael Marry? 
          

Though the identity of Michael&#39;s runaway bride remains a mystery, his second bride has been identified as Chloe Brown, senior director at the American Heart Association. InTouch Weekly was able to confirm the woman&#39;s name is Chloe Brown and that the couple did indeed get married. Chloe is an avid traveler and a television personality who&#39;s based in Denver, Colorado. She earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science from The University of Florida and has extensive experience working in the non-profit sector.






 Michael&#39;s Runaway Bride 
          

Michael&#39;s biggest hope was that he and the stranger he was about to marry would be a great match and that there would be sparks when he met her. Before the wedding, he told the producers that he was an “acquired taste” but was open to feedback regarding his eccentric appearance from his future spouse. “My biggest fear is when she sees me, and lays eyes on me, if it’s clear that maybe she’s not really attracted to me,” he said to producers.

Sadly, this came true when his bride walked down the aisle and abruptly told him she couldn&#39;t go through with the wedding. Producers decided not to show the bride, likely to avoid incentivizing future contestants to go back on their agreement to be on Married At First Sight. Online sleuths were desperate to discover the first MAFS runaway bride&#39;s identity but to no avail.






 The Experts Find Michael A New Bride 
          

Being jilted in front of his friends and family broke Michael&#39;s heart and led to a physical transformation. He cut his long, curly hair and changed his hair color, altering his look completely. Experts and producers went back to the drawing board to find Michael a new bride. Michael and Chloe got married about six weeks after the other couples, and viewers should see more of their journey during the upcoming episodes of Married At First Sight season 17.



Married At First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on Lifetime.
