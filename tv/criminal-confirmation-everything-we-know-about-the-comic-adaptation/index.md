## Literature Review
Ed Brubaker&#39;s Eisner Award-winning comic book series Criminal has gotten a series order from Prime Video, and there are already exciting updates. 




Comic book icon Ed Brubaker is returning to the small screen with an adaptation of his Eisner Award-winning series Criminal, which has been green-lit by Amazon Prime Video. Debuting in 2006 and originally published by Marvel Comics, Criminal is a gritty crime series that follows the stories of various low-level thieves, robbers, and various other seedy characters. The series has been praised for its clever writing and edgy style, and it is best known for utilizing the cliches of the crime genre in a wholly original way.




In an era of comic book movie and TV show dominance, Prime Video&#39;s decision to adapt Brubaker&#39;s comics reaffirms the streamer&#39;s dedication to offering an alternative view. Prime Video has found great success with the show The Boys and its various spinoffs, and the aforementioned superhero comic is very much a dissection of its genre, much in the same way Criminal is. Though the project has long been gestating, its official green light from Prime Video is a sign that it will be on screens sooner rather than later. 


 Criminal Is Confirmed 
          

News that Criminal was being developed into a TV series began coming in early 2023, but due to various delays as a result of the Hollywood strikes, Prime Video officially green-lit the project in early 2024. Perhaps the biggest challenge for an adaptation of a comic like Criminal is finding a way to shrink the story down to a digestible TV script. As such, Ed Brubaker&#39;s involvement in the project guarantees that the show will honor the legacy of the award-winning comic series that defined indie comics in the early 2000s. 






The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023.






 Who Is Making Criminal For Prime Video? 
          

Ed Brubaker is perhaps best known for his Winter Soldier arc in Marvel Comics, but the pulp maven also won awards for works such as Criminal. Because of his closeness to the material, Brubaker has been involved with the project from day one, and he even wrote the screenplay for the premiere episode. Brubaker will serve as co-showrunner alongside Jordan Harper who has worked on shows like Gotham in a similar capacity. No directors have been attached to the project yet, and no roles have been cast, but such news is expected to come soon. 






 Criminal Story 
          

The story of Criminal is not so much one story as many interconnected tales that take place within the same gritty and pessimistic universe. Brubaker himself described Criminal as &#34;the interweaving saga of several generations of families tied together by crimes and murders of the past&#34;, and that gives a good hint as to how the series will be as well. Though it is unclear which of the comic&#39;s familiar characters will appear, viewers can expect heists, murders, and a slew of other unsavory deeds. 

While the actual events of the story are exciting on the surface, they are ultimately in service of the overarching themes that Brubaker so cleverly injected into the subtext. Similar to the way The Boys picks apart superhero stories, Criminal analyzes the crime genre and uses cliches and tropes to make commentary about society in a way that the usual comic books never bother to attempt.
