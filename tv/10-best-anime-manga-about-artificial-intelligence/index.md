## Literature Review
While AI is often depicted as the enemy of humanity, manga and anime take a more clear-eyed view of the technology and its influence on society




While artificial intelligence (AI) might have only recently caught the world&#39;s popular attention, anime and manga about AI have been a staple genre of the medium since the 1970s. Some of the thorniest issues of the current debate, such as AI&#39;s place in society, the ethics of its widespread deployment in the community, and when – if ever – should AI be considered sentient, have all been explored in detail in manga.
AI, as it appears in anime and manga, encompasses a broader definition of technology than is popularly known. It not only includes standalone AI software programs such as ChatGPT but also the use of AI as a component in larger, more complex, technological entities such as robots and androids. While some of these systems have yet to become reality, the depiction of AI in anime and manga has been eerily accurate in some places. While the superheroes, aliens, and supernatural entities of manga still remain imaginary, artificial intelligence in anime and manga is the proof of concept necessary to show the feasibility of the future AI society.









 








 10  Cyberpunk: Peach John Was AI Generated 
Created by Rootport
        

Rootport&#39;s Cyberpunk: Peach John reimagines the tale of the ancient Japanese folk hero Momotaro. Reborn in a futuristic society, Momotaro is left on the doorstep of a club run by an elderly couple who launder money and work as hackers. While Cyberpunk: Peach John&#39;s story touches on some aspects of AI, there&#39;s also the more salient issue of how the manga was created. The art was completely generated by AI software that produced characters and settings to match the inputs of the author. Without going into the more controversial aspects of the tension between AI and artistic creativity – what is interesting and important in regard to Cyberpunk: Peach John being a manga about AI is how the AI software used by Rootport perceived AI artistically.

 9  Battle Angel Alita Forces AI To Ask, &#34;Who Am I?&#34; 
Created by Yukito Kishiro


 







Yukito Kishiro’s Battle Angel Alita depicts the adventures of Alita, a damaged cyborg who is repaired and revived by Daisuke Ido, a human engineer exiled to the scrap heap where Alita has been dumped. Although revived, Alita remembers nothing about how she ended up in the garbage pile except that she&#39;s an expert in the deadly martial art – Panzer Kunst. She then sets out to find out what happened before Ido found her. Alita touches on an important question in the current development of AI systems. That is, if the goal of AI is to be sentient, what things would or should an AI think about on its own? Should it be allowed to think about whatever it wants or should restraints on thinking be programmed into it? For Alita, however, the answer is to focus on the seemingly simple question of &#34;who am I?&#34;

 8  Time of Eve Depicts AI That Just Wants To Have Fun 
Created by Yasuhiro Yoshiura
        

Yasuhiro Yoshiura&#39;s Time of Eve follows high school student Rikuo Sakisaka and his family&#39;s android, Sammy. Rikuo has grown so used to Sammy that he sees her as nothing more than a glorified computer. That is, she&#39;s an inanimate tool whose purpose is to make people more productive, efficient, and happy. Rikuo&#39;s idea of Sammy – and androids in general – changes when he discovers that she actually has a life of her own. Time of Eve asks the tough question of what happens when a society becomes so reliant on AI that its use becomes second nature, like how people nowadays rely on their smartphones and smartwatches to do the most mundane things. Time of Eve suggests that reliance can bring enormous benefits to society, but also a host of unknown consequences.

 7  If AI Ruled the World Is An Exploration of Why the World Needs AI Supervision 
Created by Pogo and Hoopa
        

Pogo and Hoopa&#39;s If AI Ruled the World is a Manhwa that explores what happens after a hyper-intelligent AI system is allowed to take over South Korea&#39;s governmental authority. This occurs as a result of the AI&#39;s own machinations. That is, it doesn&#39;t wage war against humans – as is the traditional AI manga trope – instead, humanity slowly and voluntarily gives AI control. What follows is a series of Black Mirror–like story arcs that dive into the different aspects of an AI-administered government. One of the more interesting stories, which has the AI trying to hack itself, shows how the information humans willingly digitize could help someone who has lost their memory remember their past lives. Conversely, it shows how the information could also allow AI to sow and spread harmful disinformation.

 6  YoRHa: Pearl Harbor Descent Record Lets The AI Fight It Out 
Created by Yoko Taro and Megumu Soramichi

This is already occurring in real life, but at an extremely basic level. YoRHa contemplates what it might be like hundreds of years from now.

 5  Pluto Studies a Serial Killer Targetting Robots 
Created by Naoki Urasawa, based on Astro Boy by Osamu Tezuka


 







Naoki Urasawa&#39;s Pluto re-imagines the Astro Boy chapter titled &#34;The Greatest Robot of All&#34;. Rather than the standard superhero fare of the original Osama Tezuka work, Urasawa retells the chapter&#39;s story as a psychological murder mystery where the killing of the first super robot leads to a high-stakes investigation focused on finding the identity of the killer and his purpose. As such, Pluto presents a thought-provoking look at a controversial aspect of current AI development, namely whether humans can create AI systems that do not internalize the common biases of their human creators. This is already a key problem in such current AI uses as facial recognition. Pluto expands the discussion to include what happens when bias is programmed in robots with the ability to kill.

 3  The Gene of AI Asks If AI Regulation Will Ever Be Followed 
Created by Kyuri Yamada
        

Kyuri Yamada’s The Gene of AI tells the story of Dr. Hikaru Sudo, a physician specializing in taking care of the androids that now make up a significant portion of the population. Regardless of their numbers, androids still do not have all the benefits of their fellow human citizens. This is especially true with regard to the treatments they have access to for the illnesses they contract. Sudo is compassionate towards the plight of his patients and often performs procedures that are restricted by the law. One of the main issues The Gene of AI asks readers to consider is how AI should be regulated. At present, AI development is not strictly regulated, though that is likely to change at some point in the future. Regulation will be especially true as it is increasingly deployed in society.

 2  Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#39;s Song Follows An AI Singer With Visions Of Grandeur 
Original anime produced by WIT studio
        

Morito Yamataka&#39;s adaptation of Tappei Nagatsuki and Eiji Umehara’s Vivy: Fluorite Eye&#39;s Song follows Vivy, the world&#39;s first sentient AI. Initially, Vivy&#39;s focus is on creating music that helps make people happy. However, her job is sidetracked when a sentient AI from the future contacts Vivy and asks for her help to thwart a Terminator-esque plan by a future AI to enslave humanity. Wanting to complete her mission of facilitating happiness, Vivy agrees – setting her on a course of action with the fate of the world in the balance. Naturally, in a story where the protagonist is AI, there are multiple AI-related issues worthy of consideration, including the practicality of relying on AI. But one interesting element in Vivy concerns the risks of inter-AI communication. Indeed, in a connected world, AI benefits from communicating with other AI systems. Vivy asks what happens when that communication creates an unforeseen result.

 1  Ghost in the Shell is the Perfect Illustration Of Singularity 
Created by Masamune Shirow


 







Masamune Shirow&#39;s Ghost in the Shell follows the exploits of Motoko Kusanagi and the members of Public Security Section 9, Japan&#39;s top-level cybercrime investigation unit. Kusanagi and the team are especially suited for the work as many of them are cyborgs who can act on both the physical and virtual levels. As one of the most detailed depictions of AI in manga, Ghost in the Shell is full of interesting and thought-provoking takes on living in a world of ubiquitous AI. To be sure, one of the team&#39;s hardest criminals to bring down was a malevolent AI known as the Puppet Master which infects and takes control of third-party AI to make it do its bidding. Despite being published over 25 years ago, Ghost in the Shell is extremely relevant to contemporary discussions of AI.
