## Literature Review
Big Ed and Liz Woods aren’t the only controversial 90 Day: The Last Resort cast members. Asuelu Pulaa and Jovi Dufren have have kept secrets.




90 Day: The Last Resort’s cast members were part of various controversies in 2023. The drama began in August last year when TLC premiered its new spin-off. The retreat-style show featured five alumni pairs reevaluating their relationships and discussing their struggles. 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 kicked off with Kelly Brown and Molly Hopkins revealing they weren’t together anymore. Molly said she had fallen out of love because Kelly wasn’t an active partner. Kelly claimed Molly hadn’t shown him love and expected him to be her do-boy. Similarly, Kalani Faagata and Asuelu Pulaa also shared that they had split up. However, their separation had resulted from mutual infidelity.




Big Ed Brown and Liz Woods also participated in the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. They joined the spin-off before marriage, hoping to resolve their remaining issues. Thankfully, they were able to do that. Likewise, Angela Deem and Michael Ilesanmi were on the show to build mutual trust. They had previously dealt with many disagreements and wanted to find out if their marriage was worth saving. Jovi Dufren and Yara Zaya were on the show because of the New Orleans native’s problems. The father of one had a bad alcohol and strip club addiction that worsened progressively through the season. Fortunately, Yara and Jovi made things work.

 Big Ed Brown &amp; Liz Woods; Divorce Rumors 
         




The cast of 90 Day: The Last Resort has been part of some wild controversies over the months. One such notable scandal has been about Ed and Liz. When the spin-off concluded in October 2023, Ed and Liz were on the same page and were hopeful to start their new lives in Arkansas. There were rumors that they had already tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony. Sadly, the two haven’t posted any content with each other in the last three months. Instead, Liz has started sharing stories with another man, sparking divorce or breakup rumors.



 Angela Deem &amp; Michael Ilesanmi’s Mystery Location 

 

Angela and Michael looked happy when their 90 Day: The Last Resort journey concluded. Angela had torn up the divorce papers she had brought and was looking forward to meeting Michael in the United States. Recently, Angela and Michael have been spotted together (as shared by Redditor u/lexi4020). Their reunion sparked rumors that Michael had finally reached the United States. The couple hasn’t confirmed their location yet. Michael has waited years to live with his wife, and fans have been rooting for him. Hopefully, the rumors are true, and he’s finally living his dream.






 Kalani Faagata &amp; Asuelu Pulaa’s Hall Pass Scandal 
         

Kalani and Asuelu were once one of the franchise’s sweetest duos. However, things were much worse off-screen, as viewers learned in 90 Day: The Last Resort. Kalani revealed that Asuelu had cheated on her with numerous women over the years. She shared that he had offered her a hall pass to kiss another man to get even with him.

The mom of two then dropped the bomb and shared that she had developed feelings for the man she kissed. The couple tried to overcome mutual infidelity, but Kalani couldn’t get herself to love her husband again. The pair broke up in the finale and moved on with their lives. Kalani is currently in a happy relationship with Dallas.



 Kelly Brown Said He “Dodged A Bullet” By Breaking Up With Molly Hopkins 

 




Kelly and Molly had strikingly matching energies. Unfortunately, things declined for the pair when Kelly retired and moved to live with Molly in Georgia. Molly and Kelly separated because they weren’t compatible anymore. Molly wanted to build her business empire, while Kelly wanted to relax after his retirement. During 90 Day: The Last Resort, the two tried but didn’t fall back in love. Kelly left the show and moved on with his single life. According to Instagram blogger Merry Pants, Kelly responded to the rumors that Molly was now in a relationship with a “prison kingpin.” He admitted he dodged a bullet by breaking up with Molly.

 Yara Zaya Wanted To Divorce Jovi Dufren After His Drunken Bender With Angela Deem 
         




Yara and Jovi were the most unusual pair on 90 Day: The Last Resort. The two seemed to have a great relationship and often posted about it on social media. Unfortunately, things were very different in their personal lives. During the show, viewers learned that Jovi had a big alcohol and stripper problem that stopped him from being a great husband to Yara. He even spent the night drinking with Angela, which wasn’t the best thing to do during the retreat. Yara even told him, “if you gonna do this to me, you will gonna [sic] get divorce.”



 Angela Deem Attacked Her Friend 
          

Angela has been controversial since her debut in 2018. She has managed to be part of new scandals every few months and shocked fans with her bizarre personality. Last year, Angela got into a fistfight with her friend, Jennifer. The altercation surfaced online (via U.S. Sun) which showed Angela cursing at her friend and pinning her to the ground at two in the morning. Apparently, the fight only happened because Jennifer had a minor argument with Angela in their cab. It’s unclear if Angela faced any repercussions for publicly attacking her friend.






 Jovi Dufren Turned Down A Job Near Home 
          

Jovi’s job situation was one of the wildest discoveries during 90 Day: The Last Resort. In one of the later episodes, Yara and Jovi talked to their mom, Gwen, who insisted they be truthful. She urged Jovi to open up, which is when he shared that he had purposely rejected better job offers, so he could continue working at his far-away job. He said, “I got a job offer to work closer to home, to be home more, but I didn’t take it.” Yara was dumbfounded by the revelation and felt hurt by Jovi’s selfishness. She added that the lack of truth is a major “problem” in her marriage.



 Molly Hopkins Is Dating “The Prison Kingpin” 
          




Molly has been part of a big scandal lately. In October 2023, the single mom posted a cuddly photo with a man online. She wore matching nail polish to her new man&#39;s cyan-colored suit and seemed romantically involved with him. The man in the picture has been accused of being a “prison kingpin.” Not only has he allegedly spent time in jail, but he also had a wife and a baby. As expected, Molly hasn’t confirmed her entanglement with the prison guy yet, for obvious reasons. Maybe viewers will never get to know more about it in the next season of 90 Day: The Last Resort.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
