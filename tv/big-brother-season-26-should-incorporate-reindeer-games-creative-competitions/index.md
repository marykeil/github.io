## Literature Review
Big Brother legend Janelle is sharing her thoughts about Big Brother Reindeer Games online, including the changes she thinks should be made for BB 26.




Big Brother Reindeer Games has led some to demand change from Big Brother after seeing the level of competition the series has been able to produce, including BB legend Janelle Pierzina. Having first appeared on Big Brother in 2005, Janelle took third place in BB 6 and BB 7, the first iteration of All-Stars. After her first two appearances, Janelle took some time away, but returned for Big Brother 14 to coach other players along with fellow BB legends Dan Gheesling, Britney Haynes, and Mike &#34;Boogie&#34; Malin before re-entering the game to play for herself. She made her most recent appearance on BB 22, making her an expert.




After watching the first several episodes of Big Brother Reindeer Games, Janelle shared that she&#39;s interested in seeing the same level of competition on upcoming seasons of Big Brother. On Twitter, she shared, &#34;I really like these reindeer game comps. It would be awesome if they would bring some of these more creative or mental games to a regular season of BB. Iâ€™m over the all physical stuff. #ReindeerGames.&#34; Janelle explained that the physical competitions, which have been a common complaint for Big Brother viewers in the last few years, are no longer interesting to her.


 Big Brother 25 vs. Big Brother Reindeer Games 
          

According to many Big Brother viewers, the competitions on Big Brother Reindeer Games are far more exciting than the ones that have been on traditional BB. While the series have many differences between them, the crux of the difference between the shows has been the element of competition. BB Redineer Games removes some elements of Big Brother that are crucial to the classic series but replaces some of the social elements of the game with social elements in competition. While Big Brother is more equitable in terms of social vs. physical gameplay being important, BB Reindeer Games has far more equity in competitions, which makes it inherently more fair.





 

While Big Brother may be a long-running reality TV competition series, it hasn&#39;t been running as smoothly in the last several years due to a massive inequity in competitions. In the last two seasons alone, Big Brother&#39;s long-held Veto competition win record has been broken twice. The record, originally held by Janelle, was broken during Big Brother 24 by Michael Bruner and Big Brother 25 by Jag Bains. While breaking the record is a historic BB moment, seeing it happen so frequently makes it clear there&#39;s an issue with Big Brother&#39;s competition style. That issue, interestingly, has seemed to be resolved by the competition style of Big Brother Reindeer Games.

With competition beasts and BB legends like Janelle speaking up for the competition equity on the show during the run of Big Brother Reindeer Games, it&#39;s clear that there&#39;s an issue with the competition style on Big Brother. With competitions that viewers are finding interesting and engaging on BB Reindeer Games, many are hopeful that there will be a change in the next season of Big Brother. While the competition design team has been changing throughout the last few years, it may be time to take a cue from Big Brother Reindeer Games and make equitable, compelling competitions on the original series.
