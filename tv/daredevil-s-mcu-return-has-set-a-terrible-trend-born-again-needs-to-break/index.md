# Daredevil s MCU Return Has Set A Terrible Trend Born Again Needs To Break


## SUMMARY 



  Daredevil: Born Again will mark Daredevil&#39;s most prominent role in the MCU so far, but it needs to address the mixed reactions to his previous appearances.   Daredevil&#39;s appearances in Spider-Man: No Way Home and She-Hulk received differing responses from fans, with the latter being less positively received.   The show should focus on Daredevil&#39;s hero side and make good on the building Kingpin plot points to turn around the trend and satisfy fans.

## Literature Review

Daredevil: Born Again will feature Daredevil in his biggest MCU role to date, but it has one recurring issue that it will have to overcome. 




Daredevil: Born Again, which is set to release in 2025, will mark Daredevil&#39;s most prominent role in the MCU thus far, but the return of the character will need to address one recurring issue. Prior to Daredevil&#39;s addition to the MCU timeline, he was featured in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil. Unfortunately for fans, the show ended when the relationship shifted between Marvel and Netflix, with Marvel reclaiming its rights to various Marvel franchises and pulling those projects from the platform.




After Daredevil ended on Netflix, it wasn&#39;t clear whether the character would be included in the MCU and, if so, when, but many fans were eager for his return. The Netflix show ended satisfyingly, with Daredevil putting Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. Kingpin, back behind bars and returning to his work as a lawyer, but he remained a fan-favorite and represented a gap in the MCU characters. Excitingly, it seems Daredevil: Born Again will link to Netflix&#39;s Daredevil, but the show will still have a large hill to climb.

 Daredevil&#39;s MCU Appearances Have Established A Worrying Trend 
          

With Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel will need to address the mixed reactions to Daredevil&#39;s MCU appearances so far. He first appeared in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), which was a largely celebrated return in a film that included multiple returning Marvel characters. This choice was a bit of a gamble because Daredevil was the only cameo that wasn&#39;t connected to previous Spider-Man films, but it signaled his return after the conclusion of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil, and that alone spurred excitement.




Daredevil&#39;s next appearance in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) was less positively received, likely because of the overall reception of the show. The series&#39; first season has a 32% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, and a recent She-Hulk season 2 update suggests a second season isn&#39;t likely. This response is particularly disappointing, as it was Daredevil&#39;s first suited-up MCU appearance; unlike in No Way Home, Daredevil got some on-screen fighting time in She-Hulk.

Daredevil&#39;s most recent MCU appearance in Marvel&#39;s Echo (2024) didn&#39;t perform much better. Reviews of Echo were more varied, but they weren&#39;t overwhelmingly positive. While Daredevil had a fight scene in the show, it was brief, which left some fans unsatisfied. Daredevil&#39;s cameo in Echo was always likely to be short-lived, as Echo was intended to be a standalone series, representing the first show under the new Marvel Spotlight, but expectations remained high for Daredevil&#39;s screen time in the show.






 How Born Again Can Break The MCU&#39;s Daredevil Trend 
          

Changes to Daredevil: Born Again suggest that the MCU is aware of the criticism and trying to course-correct for Daredevil&#39;s MCU debut as a show lead. In 2023, Daredevil: Born Again had a major update to its directors, completely overhauling what was currently in the works. Given the new creative direction, the show must accomplish a few things to turn the trend around. To address the frustration with Daredevil&#39;s lack of fighting time, the show should center on Daredevil in his prime, pushing the hero angle a bit more than his work as a lawyer.

Daredevil: Born Again should also make good on its building Kingpin plot points. Kingpin appeared in both Hawkeye and Echo and got significantly more screen time than Daredevil in the latter. Kingpin and Daredevil have a longstanding history, particularly from the Netflix iteration of Daredevil. With Kingpin becoming more dangerous in Echo, and with his interest in becoming mayor, he poses an even greater threat than he previously did in his MCU appearances, which sets Daredevil up to have the perfect enemy in his upcoming MCU show.
