## Literature Review

The most realistic marriages in TV shows demonstrate the sacrifice and hard work it takes to make a marriage last, including compromising on careers. 




The most realistic married couples on TV contend with real problems: careers, raising children, paying the bills, etc. These things can lead to a divorce in real life, but don’t as often on TV. However, it is not uncommon for a TV show couple to come to an impasse in their marriage, where they are forced to reevaluate their priorities and decide if they want to stay together.
The most realistic TV marriages demonstrate both partners&#39; sacrifice and their commitment to making their marriage work. Past the initial spark and romance, they must remain committed to preserving a long-term relationship. On TV, work conflicts are possibly the most common cause of tension between partners. In several cases, including Beth in This Is Us and Meredith in Grey&#39;s Anatomy, a woman confronts her husband because her career is secondary to his. However, these characters and others make bigger changes to their lives, so their marriage will last.

They try to ignore their budding feelings but begin a secret relationship in season 3, but decide that they need to be public for it to work. Leslie tries to fight the rule in season 4.
Ben then resigns so he and Leslie can be together, and she can still run for city council. Their actual relationship and marriage over the next few seasons is nearly always amicable. Yet the situation that almost ruined everything demonstrates realistic problems and sacrifice.

Additionally, Cora blames Robert for Sybil’s death and the two only reconcile when Dr. Clarkson lies and says that Sybil was going to die no matter what.

After Bow’s father dies, they reconcile and start going to couples therapy again. Ultimately, they both decide that they make each other happy and want to stay together.
