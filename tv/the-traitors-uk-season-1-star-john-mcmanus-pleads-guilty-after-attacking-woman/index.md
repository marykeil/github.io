## Literature Review

The Traitors UK season 1&#39;s John McManus pleads guilty several months after being charged with attacking a waitress, but the victim isn&#39;t satisfied.




John McManus, one of the contestants who competed in The Traitors UK season 1, recently pleaded guilty to charges that he attacked a waitress at a restaurant. The Traitors UK season 1 was the debut of the deceptive series, inviting a group of players to a castle in the Scottish highlands to play a drawn-out game of murder and mystery. The contestants, including John, were picked off one after another by the Traitors who were hoping to win the prize pot on their own. John was murdered in the game after being put on trial by the Traitors, an exciting twist from the first season of the series.




Back in May 2023, John was accused of assaulting a waitress after allegedly making too much noise while dining at a restaurant in the UK. Several months later, he finally pleaded guilty to the two charges against him, according to the U.S. Sun. This latest development came after the Sun shared footage of John&#39;s attack against the waitress; at one point, he could be seen dragging the woman to the ground by her hair. After pleading guilty, he received a fine of 47 pounds, as well as 600 pounds for the victim.


 John McManusâ€™ Punishment Is Not Good Enough, According To Waitress 
          

While John&#39;s behavior has been called into question by the authorities, the fine he paid &#34;is nothing for someone of his stature,&#34; according to a friend of the waitress. &#34;The compensation he has been ordered to pay will barely cover the fees for the therapy she has had to have because of his actions,&#34; the friend shared, explaining that the incident was &#34;confidence-destroying&#34; for the waitress. &#34;She is currently in therapy and is worried she will have to leave the hospitality industry. She loves her job but this makes it very difficult to carry on,&#34; her friend lamented, looking for the best outcome after The Traitors UK star&#39;s attack.





 

While The Traitors UK season 1&#39;s cast was a large group, they all seemed to have a close-knit relationship throughout their time on the series and have continued to interact online afterward. The majority of The Traitors UK cast are often on Twitter, sharing their thoughts about the current season of the series. Though many believed John was in that group, The Traitors UK season 1 cast has made it clear after the incident that he isn&#39;t exactly welcome at their round table any time soon. John&#39;s behavior is, obviously, not condoned by the rest of the cast of the hit BBC series.

Although John has been apprehended and fined for the attack, many are still shocked to learn that one of the contestants from The Traitors UK season 1 could&#39;ve gone so far. John&#39;s behavior has been appalling for the cast and the public to learn about, especially with the success of the current season taking off. Though John&#39;s actions don&#39;t reflect on those who he competed with or the cast of The Traitors UK season 2, understanding he&#39;s done something so terrible is still painful for all involved.




The Traitors UK season 2 airs Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays at 9 p.m. UK time on BBC One.
