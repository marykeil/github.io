## Literature Review
Jasmine Pineda makes out with fictional animated character Shrek after accusing Gino Palazzolo of cheating on her in 90 Day Fiancé season 10.




Jasmine Pineda from 90 Day Fiancé is &#34;cheating&#34; on Gino Palazzolo in a strange new video. Jasmine and Gino&#39;s storyline began in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. They met under strange circumstances on a sugar baby/sugar daddy platform and began a long-distance relationship before Gino went to Panama to meet her. Jasmine expected him to spend money on her; these demands only grew after she lost her teaching job. Jasmine also felt insecure about herself and suspected Gino would leave her for someone else, leading to a rise in quarrels between them. Gino and Jasmine, however, did stay together and are to get married in 90 Day Fiancé season 10.




However, before that can happen, Jasmine is spending time with someone else. Jasmine&#39;s Instagram page @Jasmine.gino recently shared a shocking clip featuring her kissing the fictional ogre character Shrek, who appeared in the video via augmented reality.


 

Jasmine talks to Shrek, who&#39;s not in the frame in the clip, and tells him that she &#34;can&#39;t&#34; do it because Princess Fiona is her friend. The video then shows Shrek entering the frame to pounce on Jasmine and passionately making out with her. Jasmine resists his advances at first but then gives in to the kisses. She holds Shek close as she starts kissing him back. The weird video had a fan asking, &#34;What kind of sex fantasy is this??&#34; in the comments section. Someone else commented, &#34;I knew she was cheating on Gino.&#34;

 Jasmine Pineda Recently Debuted Shrek-Inspired Hair Makeover 
          

90 Day Fiancé fans deduced that Jasmine must have been bored to death to have created such a bizarre video. A fan joked that Jasmine was trying to get a Green Card from Shrek. One fan even thought Shrek looked a lot like Gino. It could explain Jasmine&#39;s recent obsession with the Shrek franchise and its characters. Jasmine recently got rid of her infamously long and expensive hair extensions. She now sports her natural hair during 90 Day Fiancé season 10 and on social media as well. Jasmine recently revealed her new hair makeover, in which she sports long curtain bangs.




While Shrek character Lord Farquaad doesn&#39;t have bangs, Jasmine joked that her hairstyle was heavily inspired by him. She shared side-by-side photos of herself and Lord Farquaad to prove her point. Jasmine&#39;s fans disagreed with the comparisons, though. They thought the short hair looked great on Jasmine. She has been battling alopecia, and it&#39;s been great to see her showing off her real hair without a care in the world. Jasmine is not afraid to show her bald patches on Instagram. She&#39;s also not scared of poking fun at herself. It&#39;s what makes Jasmine so likable despite her on-screen personality coming across as annoying.

Jasmine and Gino have been fighting a lot on 90 Day Fiancé. She found a tube of lip gloss underneath the seat of his car and immediately decided Gino was cheating on her. While he was able to convince her that she was the only woman he&#39;d been with in the last three years, Jasmine has now discovered that Gino went to a bachelor party at a strip club before she came to the U.S. Jasmine seems to have lost all her trust in her husband. It makes sense that she is choosing to have an fictional affair with Shrek behind Gino&#39;s back.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
