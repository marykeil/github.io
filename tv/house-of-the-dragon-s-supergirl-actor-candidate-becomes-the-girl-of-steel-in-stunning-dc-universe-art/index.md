## Literature Review

Following the reports that Milly Alcock is testing for Supergirl in James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe, the actress suits up as Kara Zor-El in new fan art.




As House of the Dragon star Milly Alcock is rumored to be a candidate for Supergirl in DC&#39;s upcoming franchise, new DC Universe art imagines her as the Girl of Steel. Gunn&#39;s DC Universe is on its way, following the official conclusion to the DCEU, which ended its decade-long run in 2023 through Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. While Superman: Legacy will be the first DC Universe movie, Kara Zor-El is also jumping to the big screen, with Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow currently in development at DC Studios.




While Ana Nogueira is writing the Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow script, casting for the DCU Supergirl has yet to be confirmed, though many names have been raised as prospective candidates. With rumors floating around about Alcock maybe auditioning for the role, several fan art pieces have emerged of her as the next cinematic version of Supergirl.


 

The first Supergirl fan art piece comes from 21xFour, pitched as concept art of Alcock in Kara&#39;s iconic costume. 21xFour called the idea of Alcock as Supergirl a solid idea after her &#34;outstanding performance in House of the Dragon.&#34;


 




Buffy2Ville shared a gallery of Alcock as Supergirl, featuring numerous ideas of what her DC Universe costume could look like in live-action. While most of the designs feature a more traditional Supergirl, there are also a handful where the color scheme is tinkered with from her usual look.


 

Carlos Gonzalez designed a version of Alcock as Supergirl with various layers of Melissa Benoist&#39;s Supergirl costume from the Arrowverse. There are also elements from the version of Kara in the Injustice 2 video game, as Gonzalez shows his references in the second image.

                  Supergirl: Woman Of Tomorrow: Plot Details &amp; Everything We Know   Along with many other DCU projects, James Gunn announced the exciting Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, shedding light on the franchise&#39;s future.   





 DC Universe&#39;s Latest Supergirl Casting Rumors Explained 
         

On January 10, 2024, Deadline reported that Milly Alcock was one of three actors getting ready to test for Supergirl at DC Studios. The other two candidates in the reported list were Meg Donnelly (The Winchesters) and Emilia Jones (CODA), with Gunn set to be part of the process. Even though there is the Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow film coming up, the reason Gunn is reportedly involved with casting the new Girl of Steel is because she will supposedly appear in an upcoming DC Universe project before her solo movie.

The DC Universe film that Supergirl will most likely show up in if this is meant to be accurate is Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy movie, as that is the next DC Studios project that is set to start production. With David Corenswet starring as the Man of Steel, it would make perfect sense for Superman: Legacy to feature Supergirl in a supporting role or even as a cameo in order to get the audience ready for her film later on. Since Superman: Legacy principal photography is starting up in March, the Supergirl casting could be revealed around this time should the rumors be true.






No director has been hired yet for the Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow movie.




It will be interesting to see who actually ends up getting tapped to star as Kara in the DC Universe, and how Gunn is planning to use her before Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. With Kara and Clark&#39;s dynamic as cousins, it will also be fun to witness who will play opposite Corenswet&#39;s Superman. Hopefully, the lead for Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow will be revealed sooner rather than later, especially if she is set to debut in Superman: Legacy.
