## Literature Review
While Bridgerton&#39;s romances are what made the Netflix hit famous, not every couple can be as beloved as Simon and Daphne or George and Charlotte.




Between Bridgerton and Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, there have been plenty of great romances in the Netflix franchise as well as a few couples that never lived up to their potential. Bridgerton is all about romance. The show may not be very historically accurate, but viewers are more than willing to excuse this since the romantic plots of both Bridgerton and its spinoff Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story have consistently been surprising, salacious, poignant, and sweet in equal measure. That said, not all of Bridgerton’s romantic plot lines managed to strike a chord with viewers.
As Bridgerton season 3’s release nears, there is no better time for a look back on the many couples whose stories have defined the franchise so far. For every passionate pairing like Simon and Daphne, there are more chaste, charming young romances like Eloise and Theo’s relationship. For every moving, epic love story like that of Queen Charlotte and King George, there is also a whole swathe of doomed romances that never quite came together like Genevieve and Benedict’s unfortunate tryst. Finally, there are those couples that have plenty of potential but haven’t quite had their moment in the spotlight yet, like Colin and Lady Whistledown herself, Penelope.




























 








 10  Genevieve &amp; Benedict 
        

Benedict Bridgerton’s relationship with Genevieve was exciting precisely because both partners didn’t care about social mores and only wanted to flirt with each other to their heart’s content. In a series so concerned with the rules of high society, this made for a refreshing break from the show’s formula. However, it couldn’t last and, although Genevieve returned in Bridgerton season 2, her relationship with Benedict seemingly fizzled out offscreen at some point. This underwhelming conclusion made their romance one of the show’s worst wasted pairings.





 9  Marina &amp; Colin 
        

Colin ended up proving that he could be a perfect suitor for Penelope in Bridgerton season 2, but some viewers will recall that he once seemed destined to end up with another character altogether. Marina Thompson played a major role in Bridgerton season 1, where she hid her pregnancy from Colin as he attempted to woo her. This relationship was based on a genuine friendship, but Marina’s decision to hide her pregnancy from Colin ensured that the pair could never be more than friends. This disappointing revelation proved how much Bridgerton season 2 failed Marina.





 8  Lady Danbury &amp; Lord Ledger 
        

Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story proved that Lady Danbury was one of the franchise&#39;s more underrated characters as the spinoff explored her unsatisfying marriage to Lord Danbury. Her relationship with Lord Ledger was a much more successful foray into the world of romance for Lady Danbury, with this plot showing Danbury’s softer side without betraying the independent streak that made her character so appealing in the first place. If only the duo got more screen time, they might have been one of the show’s best couples.





 7  Eloise &amp; Theo 
        

Eloise and Theo Sharpe shared sweet romantic chemistry that was much more PG-rated than most of Bridgerton’s romances throughout season 2. Unfortunately, the pair’s chances at happiness were dashed by their different social classes. This was a real shame since Theo proved Bridgerton’s Eloise needs a more substantial storyline than her book counterpart as the character has become a major fan favorite among viewers thanks to this short-lived romantic subplot of hers.





 6  Edmund &amp; Violet 
        

Tragically, Edmund died too young for him to play a major role in the events of Bridgerton seasons 1 and 2. Despite this, there is a reason that the show bears his name. His romance with Violet Ledger was a near-perfect pairing that set the stage for all the Bridgerton family’s subsequent romantic travails and, in a show with no end of double-crossing, deceit, and cheating, theirs was a truly happy union. Thus, Edmund and Violet set the standard for Bridgerton’s many courtships despite Edmund’s early exit.





 5  Colin &amp; Penelope 
        

Viewers already know that Colin and Penelope’s relationship will be the focus of Bridgerton season 3, and it is easy to see why. Colin spent season 2 incapable of picking up on Penelope’s interest in him, but the pair still shared moments of sweet chemistry whenever their paths did cross. As such, these two have a potentially bright future once Colin can finally get the message.





 4  Simon &amp; Daphne 
        

While Simon and Daphne were originally Bridgerton’s primary pairing, the couple’s importance among the franchise’s relationships has since been outstripped. That said, there is a reason that Bridgerton’s first couple won over so many viewers in the first place. Their journey from tentative friends to unlikely lovers was charming and the chemistry between them was undeniable, while the fact that the pair could enliven a corny old fake romance storyline proves just how much the couple worked together. That said, Bridgerton’s Simon and Daphne aren’t the show’s only great pairing.





 3  Brimsley &amp; Reynolds 
        

While Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story’s relationship between footmen Brimsley &amp; Reynolds was one of the show’s first LGBTQIA&#43; pairings, this tragic love story proved worth the wait. The two bickering footmen were briefly paired off before the risk inherent in their same-sex union led them to end things. As sad as it was to see Brimsley dancing alone in the show’s ending, this didn’t make Bridgerton’s first gay romance any less sweet.





 2  Kate &amp; Anthony 
        

Kate and Anthony Bridgerton seemed more likely to kill each other than kiss each other for a good portion of Bridgerton season 2, but this was what gave their romance so much spark and charm. Anthony’s bullish nature led him to almost marry another suitor, but the pair were always destined to end up together no matter how much they had to battle each other to make their happy ending happen. It is not clear where Bridgerton season 3 will take Kate and Anthony&#39;s love story, but their love story proved even stronger than Simon and Daphne’s season 1 plot.





 1  Queen Charlotte &amp; King George 
        

Queen Charlotte and King George’s romance started sweet but took a tragic turn when his mental illness took its toll on their pairing. However, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story didn’t allow this tragedy to get in the way of a good love story and the pair managed to weather the storm of George’s worsening illness as they aged, with the duo remaining as deeply in love as ever. While Queen Charlotte and King George’s love might have been less raunchy than most of the show’s famous pairings, the depth of their love made Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story’s love affair the best in Bridgerton so far.
