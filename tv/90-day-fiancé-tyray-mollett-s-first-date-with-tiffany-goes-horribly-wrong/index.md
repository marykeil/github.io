## Literature Review
Tyray Mollett met Tiffany on 90 Day: The Single Life and she could have become his first real girlfriend, but he&#39;s dealing with heartbreak yet again.




90 Day: The Single Life star Tyray Mollett is going to remember yet another disastrous date after the worst-case scenario played out for him. Tyray from Modesto, California had a unique storyline in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6. Tyray was a 33-year-old virgin who was in an online relationship with Carmella from Barbados after having met her on a dating app. Tyray and Carmella chatted on Snapchat for four years, during which Tyray never saw her on a video call. The 90 Day Fiancé producers informed Tyray that he was getting catfished by a man named Christian, who was posing as Carmella.




One time, Tyray traveled to Barbados during COVID-19 to meet Carmella, but the catfisher stood 90 Day Fiancé star Tyray up. The same has happened to Tyray again, but this time with a different woman named Tiffany.


 

The video clip from an upcoming episode of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 shows Tyray waiting for Tiffany to arrive at a restaurant. Tyray had done everything to make Tiffany feel special. He dressed up nicely, brought her flowers, and booked them a spot at a nice restaurant, &#34;I just want everything to be perfect,&#34; Tyray told the cameras. Little did Tyray know that Tiffany was not going to show up.

 Tyray &amp; Carmella&#39;s Relationship On 90 Day Fiancé Explained 
          

The date was at 7 pm, and Tyray didn&#39;t know if it was normal for a woman to arrive late. Tyray felt it was a &#34;lot emotionally&#34; as he grew worried that Tiffany wouldn&#39;t show up at all. Tyray texted her repeatedly and received no response. At 7:30 pm, a server who had been observing Tyray asked if he needed anything. &#34;I feel so bad for him to the point where I just wanted to sit down and be his date,&#34; she told the cameras. Tyray&#39;s phone call to Tiffany went unanswered, and after an hour of waiting, Tyray realized, &#34;I guess I got stood up.&#34;

Tyray received messages of encouragement from fellow 90 Day Fiancé cast members such as David Dangerfield, who wrote, &#34;I hope she shows up !!&#34; and Rob Warne, who wrote, &#34;@ttyrayy I’ve been in this situation, just shake it off cause you just dodged a bullet.&#34; Tyray indeed dodged a bullet because had it not been for the producers, he may have still been in a &#34;relationship&#34; with a man who was looting him for his money. Tyray was in denial for most of the season as he tried to track down the woman in the photos that Christian was using to talk to Tyray as Carmella.




Carmella turned out to be real, and Tyray showed an interest in dating her, but nothing ever happened between them. Tyray&#39;s trying to find love the old-school way by ditching the apps and meeting women in real life in 90 Day: The Single Life. Tyray has also been focusing on weight loss and overall fitness for better health. He&#39;d met this woman named Tiffany at his cousin’s grandma’s funeral. He worked up the courage to ask her out, and she said yes while revealing, &#34;I like his attitude, his demeanor, his eyes. I really liked him.” Tiffany&#39;s ghosting comes as a major blow to Tyray&#39;s self-confidence.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
