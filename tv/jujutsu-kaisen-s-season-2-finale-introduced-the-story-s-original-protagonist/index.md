Summary

  The season 2 finale of Jujutsu Kaisen leaves fans confused about Yuta&#39;s character after his shocking claim to kill Yuji.   Yuta&#39;s controversial return to the main series reignites interest in his character and leaves fans eagerly anticipating his next appearance.   Yuta was the protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Gege Akutami&#39;s original story that later became a prequel for Jujutsu Kaisen.  







Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s exciting second season has finally come to an end with a shocking cliffhanger that introduced the original protagonist of the story: Yuta Okkotsu. The final episode of the Shibuya Incident Arc sees the return of fan-favorite Jujutsu High sorcerer who was the protagonist of the successful movie Jujutsu Kaisen 0, and also of the manga of the same created by author Gege Akutami before the current series.

Season 2, episode #23 of Jujutsu Kaisen ends with Yuta claiming he will kill Yuji himself, leaving anime-only fans incredibly confused. The excitement surrounding Yuta&#39;s return has taken an interesting turn with fans acquainted with the manga preparing to defend his character amidst the chaos caused by the cliffhanger ending.


 

That said, as this X user @ShadzMangaOnly brilliantly points out in this post, the episode also presents two very contrasting sides to Yuta&#39;s character, opening up possibilities for nuanced discourse regarding Yuta&#39;s character and what his true intentions may be.




                  Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Where Is Yuta Okkotsu In The Show?   Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a prequel to the anime series, however, its protagonist Yuta Okkotsu has not been properly introduced in the series. Here&#39;s why.    


 Yuta Makes a Controversial Return to the Main Series 
          

Despite being only recently introduced in the film Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Yuta has quickly become a favorite among fans of the franchise. Although fans were left to wonder about his whereabouts following the events of the movie, his flashy return to the main series, as brief and controversial as it may be, has effectively reignited interest in Yuta&#39;s character, leaving anime and manga fans alien eagerly anticipating his next appearance.

Fortunately, fans may not have to wait long to see Yuta again as Jujutsu Kaisen has already been confirmed for season 3, though the release date for the same is yet to be revealed. This means fans will have plenty of time to speculate on Yuta&#39;s character and the future of the series. It&#39;s worth noting that Yuta was the original protagonist envisioned by Gege Akutami for his story. Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was conceived as a limited series, and it was serialized in Jump Giga for four chapters. Its great success led to Akutami getting an ongoing series in Weekly Shonen Jump, which is the Jujutsu Kaisen that fans know and love today. The events of Jujutsu Kaisen 0 were later adapted into a movie of the same name, which broke box office records.




          

Many fans of the series believe that Yuta would have been a better protagonist for the story rather than Yuji, and the debate is still raging on. Either way, Yuta&#39;s reintroduction to the main plot at the end of season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen has been a pleasant surprise and has certainly increased the excitement for the next arc. The Shibuya Incident has left things at an interesting juncture, with Gojo being sealed away and the fate of the world at stake. With several of Jujutsu High&#39;s strongest sorcerers down amidst the chaos of Psuedo-Geto&#39;s mysterious plan, having an ally as strong as Yuta Okkotsu could very well end up being a game-changer for the heroes of Jujutsu Kaisen.

Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Crunchyroll.
