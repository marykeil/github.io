Suits star Patrick J. Adams clarifies the status of the upcoming spinoff, while also addressing his willingness to reprise the role of Mike Ross. Suits has seen a massive resurgence since being added to Netflix last year. Given its continued popularity, a spinoff show has been announced.




In comments before the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, per Variety, Adams addressed whether he&#39;d return for the upcoming Suits spinoff. Adams also gave a progress update on the series, which is being developed by Suits creator Aaron Korsh, and clarified how the new series connects to the original. His quote is included below:


I think it’s all in early stages. It’s a show in the ‘Suits’ universe, like a ‘Suits L.A.’ Anyway, our fearless showrunner Aaron [Korsh is] working on that. If I got the phone call, I’d be ready to suit up again. I loved the show, I loved the character and I loved working with all these people.




Adams presented Best Drama Series at the Golden Globes, reuniting with Suits co-stars Gina Torres, Sarah Rafferty, and Gabriel Macht.





 What&#39;s Known About The Suits Spinoff So Far 
          




A spinoff was officially announced in October 2023, following the end of the writers strike. Initial reporting mentioned that the project, hailing from NBCUniversal, was being fast-tracked because of the streaming success of Suits. It was also noted that the project is not a revival, reboot, or strict continuation in the vein of the short-lived Pearson. It would be, as Adams indicates, set in the same overall universe. This makes the spinoff comparable to CSI or NCIS. In general terms, this approach allows for some crossover with the original Suits cast while allowing the new show to stand independently.

The spinoff does not currently have a home, though reports indicate that this is true for most NBCUniversal productions. This means that the new series could conceivably end up on a broadcast network, like NBC, or it could end up on streaming in another shared licensing deal between NBCU&#39;s Peacock and Netflix.

                  8 Suits Characters We Think Should Return In A Spinoff Show   Suits&#39; Netflix success from June 2023 made potential spinoffs more likely, with 1 already in the works. Here are some characters deserving to return.    




More will be revealed about the Los Angeles-set spinoff as the year continues, especially as the project finds a home. But in his recent remarks, Adams has joined Rafferty in expressing an openness to return to Suits. Though it&#39;s early, it&#39;s easy to imagine a scenario where they might be recurring guest stars rather than just showing up for an episode or two.
