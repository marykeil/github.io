The new trailer confirms that the series will pick up after The Walking Dead series finale, which sees Rick being picked up by a CRM helicopter with Michonne hot on his trail. The episodes will see both characters on their own quests to reunite with the other, with a number of major obstacles standing in their way.

One of these obstacles is the massive walker horde that Michonne encounters while on horseback. Rick, too, will have his own problems to deal with in the form of the CRM, which is touted as the &#34;most powerful military on the planet&#34;. The latest trailer provides a new look at other members of The Ones Who Live&#39;s cast, including Terry O&#39;Quinn as Major General Beale, one of the series&#39; primary antagonists. Other cast members include Lesley Ann-Brandt and Frankie Quinones, with Pollyanna McIntosh&#39;s returning character, Jadis, also briefly featured.



In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, O&#39;Quinn provides more details about his villain, revealing that he commands a force of 2,000 elite soldiers and will do whatever it takes to ensure his community&#39;s survival.







The new trailer also teases that The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live will feature some big set piece moments, including missile attacks by military aircraft, gas bomb explosions, and a collapsing building. Some impressive walker designs are also shown off in the new footage, which includes a formidable type of fire walker. While many questions remain about The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live, the latest trailer is certainly an exciting tease of what&#39;s to come when the show premieres on February 25.
