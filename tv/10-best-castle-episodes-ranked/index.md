## Literature Review

When an episode of Castle is great it&#39;s not just the cases that are compelling but the writing, acting, and character development of the story.




One of the reasons Castle remained popular for so many was because of how many strong episodes there were across the seasons. Although season finales and the conclusion of serialized plots often make the best episodes, Castle proved that, with the right combination of wit, talent, and ingenuity, the best episodes of a series can come at any time. A large part of what makes these episodes stand out is the stellar performances of the cast, who bring their all to every arc in the series.
Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) and Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) make a great team as the central duo, and later couple, throughout the show. Detective Beckett&#39;s logical and straightforward approach to solving crimes is elevated by Castle&#39;s innovative style, making the pair almost unstoppable. Castle is an author of mystery novels who falls into consulting with the NYPD, and although Beckett doesn&#39;t want his help at first, she grows to rely on him. Though they have their differences, it was obvious from the beginning that their chemistry was undeniable.
            
 
 10 Best Castle Cases, Ranked 
Like any good crime drama, Castle made its name through its intriguing cases that kept the audience guessing the killer&#39;s identity until the end. 












 








 10  XX 
Season 8, Episode 2


 







Although season 8 of Castle is considered the worst season, it does have a few strong points, especially in episode &#34;XX&#34;. One of Beckett&#39;s strongest storylines, outside her relationship with Castle, is her search for her mother&#39;s killer and her determination to bring him to justice. This episode neatly ties up many plot points in the series better than the season finale. Castle and Beckett have their connection affirmed by solving the case. Beckett can finally move on and feel safe, and each of them does some of their best investigating while fighting for their relationship.





 9  A Death In The Family 
Season 1, Episode 10
        

Season 1 was something of a test run for the series. The creators were developing the tone and pacing of the show, and the characters were discovering the dynamics that worked the best. However, through this experimentation, some amazing episodes and moments of the show came to be. In &#34;A Death In The Family&#34;, the season 1 finale, there is a case with ties to the mob and a breaking point for Castle and Beckett.
He looks into her mother&#39;s case against her wishes, and she tells him that means they&#39;re done. It&#39;s a pivotal moment for the pair because Beckett has begun to respect and trust him, but because they&#39;re growing closer, he wants to help and goes behind her back. Beckett sees it as a betrayal of trust, but it&#39;s also an important insight into what&#39;s to come in terms of the conspiracy surrounding Beckett&#39;s mother. The episode takes a darker tone and forgoes an abundance of comedic moments to illustrate the weight of the story.





 8  The Final Frontier 
Season 5, Episode 6
        

Many Castle fans are aware of Fillion&#39;s previous role as Malcolm Reynolds in the cult classic sci-fi series Firefly. In &#34;The Final Frontier&#34;, Castle finally gets to play with his past, and has some fun with double entendre and meta references to Firefly. Castle and Beckett must go to a Comic Con-type convention to complete their investigation amidst die-hard fans and celebrities. The cosplay is over-the-top and the fictional shows and movies are hilarious, making the event feel authentic, and like a love letter to sci-fi enthusiasts and TV lovers everywhere.
            
 
 Firefly: What Each Lead Actor Has Done Since The Series Ended 
Firefly&#39;s stellar ensemble cast is a huge part of why it&#39;s remained so popular. Here&#39;s what each star has done since the sci-fi series ended.








 7  Target 
Season 5, Episode 15
        

Castle&#39;s daughter Alexis (Molly Quinn) was always a large part of the series, and their father-daughter bond was one of the most wholesome parts of the series. Despite his occasional immaturity, Castle&#39;s priority in life is his daughter, and when she&#39;s kidnapped in &#34;Target&#34;, there&#39;s no way he&#39;s not bringing her home safe. The first of a two-parter that finished with &#34;Hunt&#34;, &#34;Target&#34; stands out because of how well the mystery of Alexis&#39; disappearance is unraveled and how Castle and Beckett&#39;s relationship handles the stress.
Beckett and Castle only became an official couple at the start of season 5, so the danger that Alexis faces is a major stressor to their newly formed relationship. However, Beckett shows up for Castle as an excellent support system, proving how well the pair work together in criminal cases and their love lives. The episode also earns a place as one of the best for how well it pivots from a run-of-the-mill case at the beginning of the episode, to ramping up to some of the highest stakes of the series.





 6  Reckoning 
Season 7, Episode 15


 







The arc of the Triple Killer, AKA 3XK, is concluded in season 7 with &#34;Reckoning&#34;. Beckett&#39;s life is on the line in the second part of a two-part episode that begins with &#34;Resurrection&#34;, and it&#39;s Beckett&#39;s dangerous situation that makes &#34;Reckoning&#34; the better episode. Though Castle and the team pull out all the stops to rescue her, Beckett shows she can take care of herself and what a strong character she is. In the face of intense danger, she keeps her cool while her loved ones display how much she means to them by searching for her everywhere.





 5  Cuffed 
Season 4, Episode 10
        

It&#39;s a race against the clock in &#34;Cuffed&#34; when Beckett and Castle find themselves handcuffed together in a room with no clues or tools to escape. How they got there is shrouded in mystery, and the high stakes mean there&#39;s no room for error or arguing. Of course, being trapped together means there&#39;s plenty of arguing between Beckett and Castle, but there&#39;s also plenty of tension, and with all that time alone together, they come close to admitting their true feelings for each other. For both the thrilling case and their budding relationship, &#34;Cuffed&#34; is unforgettable.





 4  Boom! 
Season 2, Episode 18
        

When a serial killer is involved there&#39;s a good chance that it&#39;s going to be a complex case and an amazing episode of Castle. In the follow-up episode to &#34;Tick, Tick, Tickâ€¦&#34;, &#34;Boom!&#34; sees Beckett and Castle take on their biggest challenge so far in the series. The killer targets Beckett and blows up her apartment, but Castle realizes just in time to come to the rescue. Though Beckett isn&#39;t a damsel in distress, she does need some help with the case.
It&#39;s an important investigation for them because Beckett starts to fully rely on Castle and trust his instincts like never before. Additionally, the writers do an excellent job characterizing the serial killer and making him a terrifying enemy. This episode also expands upon the consequences of Castle using Beckett as a muse for his mystery novels, and how Castle isn&#39;t the only person who becomes obsessed with the story.





 3  3XK 
Season 3, Episode 6
        

Castle has great respect for Beckett and the police force, but sometimes he gets caught up in chasing down the story of a case and thinking that he&#39;s invincible. &#34;3XK&#34; introduces the Triple Killer as a formidable enemy who gets the better of Castle, leaving the case unresolved. It&#39;s a bold move on the part of the show, but one that elevates the storytelling of the series. It&#39;s a reminder that Castle and Beckett are human. Even if the show is fictional, they&#39;re not immune from making mistakes, and the reality is that the good guys don&#39;t win every fight.





 2  Flowers For Your Grave 
Season 1, Episode 1
        

The pilot episode of Castle goes down as one of the best episodes of the series. &#34;Flowers For Your Grave&#34; seamlessly introduces every character, their motivations, and the style of the show without feeling formulaic or boring. Though Beckett is thrown together with Castle against her will because of a series of murders that follow the killings in his books, their chemistry is instantaneous. Castle&#39;s novels, being an essential part of the case, give a clear and logical reason why an author would be asked to work with the police and set up the rest of the show perfectly.





 1  Knockout 
Season 3, Episode 24


 







The best episode of Castle is the season 3 finale, &#34;Knockout&#34;. There were some major losses faced by Beckett, Castle, and the rest of their team, as well as important revelations. In the final moments of the episode, there is an epic cliffhanger that makes the premiere of season 4 impossible to wait for, and an admission by Castle to Beckett about how he truly feels about her. Though the episode moves quickly due to the amount of action that occurs, it still takes time to reflect on the emotional upheaval that the characters experience.
Like many of the greatest episodes, the plot revolves around a break in Beckett&#39;s mother&#39;s case, which forces Beckett and Castle to track down an escaped convict. No story better illustrates the bond between Beckett and Castle or does more to develop both characters in the face of impossible odds. The series was known to explore conspiracies inside government organizations, and &#34;Knockout&#34; is one of the most cutting takedowns of that corruption.
