# What Chef Leon Walker Is Up To After Below Deck Season 3


## SUMMARY 



  Leon Walker, a controversial chef on Below Deck season 3, was fired halfway through the season due to his lack of attention and a fire incident caused by a dirty oven.   After leaving the show, Leon has tried to remain involved in the culinary industry, but it seems that his businesses are no longer in operation.   Despite his experience working in reputed restaurants, Leon has been seeking a long-term chef position since being fired, and his lousy attitude on television hasn&#39;t helped his real-world career.

## Literature Review
Leon Walker was a cast member on Below Deck season 3 before being fired by Captain Lee Rosbach. Here&#39;s what the Australian chef has been up to since.




Leon Walker was a controversial cast member on Below Deck season 3, and since then, the brief reality star hasn&#39;t been featured in the franchise. After two seasons of Below Deck, Leon was hired to replace Chef Ben Robinson and quickly made enemies with former Chief Stew Kate Chastain. When Leon wasn&#39;t blatantly telling Kate that he didn&#39;t like her, he was raising viewers&#39; eyebrows by refusing to cater to the guest&#39;s culinary requests on board. As fans await Below Deck season 11, it&#39;s time to revisit previous seasons.




While Leon&#39;s attitude was less than positively received on Below Deck, his ultimate lack of attention led to his dismissal halfway through season 3. After ignoring a charter guest&#39;s plea for no rabbit during episode 9, Leon comes under fire when a dirty oven causes a fire to break out in the galley. Although Leon tried to blame Kate for the mishap and accused her of drinking on the job, Captain Lee wasn&#39;t fooled, and he quickly fired Leon from the Eros superyacht. Chef Ben was brought back on board to replace Leon for the rest of the season, and although Leon was rumored to appear on Below Deck Down Under, he hasn&#39;t returned to the Below Deck franchise since 2015.


 Below Deck&#39;s Leon Is Still A Chef 
          

It&#39;s been years since Leon lost his job on Below Deck season 3, but that hasn&#39;t stopped the chef from trying to remain involved in the culinary industry. Although Leon&#39;s Instagram is set to private, Leon&#39;s Twitter, which was last updated at the end of 2020, shows that the chef was spotted at several high-end restaurants following his Below Deck departure. While Leon was the owner and Head Chef of the trifecta Wink II Restaurant, Wink CafÃ©, and Wink Catering during his time with Bravo, it appears that the businesses are no longer in operation. 






 Leon Is Seeking Work After Below Deck 
          

Although Leon&#39;s Twitter shows off some beautifully composed dishes, such as a roasted duck noodle soup with variations of pork in 2017, Leon&#39;s LinkedIn further indicates that he has been looking for a solid long-term chef position since being fired by Captain Lee. Describing himself as a 25-year-long chef who has &#34;worked all over the [world] working in 2 star and 3 star Michelin restaurants,&#34; Leon states he is a &#34;passionate team player&#34; looking for &#34;the next Challenge with [a] new team.&#34; Despite his tremendous lack of experience, Leon&#39;s LinkedIn resume only lists him as the Head Chef at NOT since October 2017, with a home address in Bromley, England.

While Leon is remembered as one of the most contentious chefs on the Below Deck franchise, he isn&#39;t the only cast member to get the boot. Like Leon, Chef Ryan McKeown was fired on Below Deck Down Under&#39;s inaugural season for his bad attitude and subpar food. Chef Mila Kolomeitseva from Below Deck Mediterranean season 4 was also let go for her unimpressive cooking skills, although Mila&#39;s homophobic views did her no favors. The drama caused by chefs on Below Deck may make for the best reality TV, but it has stressed the rest of the crew over the years. In terms of skill, Leon may not be the worst chef to grace the Below Deck franchise, but it looks like his lousy attitude on television hasn&#39;t helped his real-world career since.
