## Literature Review
After making multiple Cooper family members worse, Young Sheldon season 6 confirms that The Big Bang Theory ALSO ruined Georgie. 




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Young Sheldon season 6. 




Young Sheldon season 6 confirms that The Big Bang Theory also ruined Georgie. Sheldon&#39;s mother and sister both appeared in The Big Bang Theory season 1, but his only brother didn&#39;t make a trip to Pasadena until season 11. Despite older Georgie&#39;s brief participation in the nerd-centric sitcom, CBS revealed more than enough information about him to get an idea of what his life has been like since the unexpected death of George, including how he became a successful businessman. That being said, Young Sheldon&#39;s depiction of Georgie reveals that much like the majority of the Cooper clan, he, too, was ruined by The Big Bang Theory.

A lot has changed in the Cooper household in the lead up to the eventful Young Sheldon season 5 finale, especially for Georgie. Following a brief affair with Mandy, the pair was forced to reconcile and keep in touch after learning that Mandy was pregnant. Aside from their decision to move forward with the pregnancy, however, they had yet to decide what their future would look like. As they navigate their tricky situation, Georgie&#39;s actions in Young Sheldon season 6 show that The Big Bang Theory provided an unfairly negative depiction.




 : Young Sheldon’s George Gave Sheldon His Most Repulsive TBBT Trait


 TBBT Destroys Georgie&#39;s Seemingly Happy Young Sheldon Future 
          

Georgie has been mostly blamed for his and Mandy&#39;s predicament in Young Sheldon, although their relationship was consensual. Regardless of whose fault it was, George and Mary&#39;s firstborn has been nothing but patient, loyal, and committed to making things work with his complicated lover. Georgie&#39;s The Big Bang Theory appearance, however, showed him as cocky, spiteful, and even a bit of a playboy, contradicting Young Sheldon&#39;s depiction of the character. So, while the prequel spin-off is setting up a seemingly happy adult life for Georgie, it has no choice but to follow the established canon and turn him into a bitter, albeit successful business owner in the future.




Aside from George&#39;s overall vibe, The Big Bang Theory&#39;s more ruthless depiction of the character also ruins another aspect of his Young Sheldon story — his relationship with Missy. Since Mary tends to favor Sheldon in the prequel series given his genius and unique quirks, it resulted in Georgie and Missy fostering a special bond. So, Georgie&#39;s crass description of his sister as a &#34;dumb teenager&#34; in TBBT didn&#39;t fit with Young Sheldon&#39;s version of the character. Essentially, not only does The Big Bang Theory retcon Georgie&#39;s Missy story in the prequel, but it also cheapens one of the comedy&#39;s best relationships.



 Why TBBT’s Coopers Are So Different In Young Sheldon 
         

Young Sheldon has started to diversify its storytelling, giving ample focus on the rest of the Cooper family. Prior to the prequel spinoff, there was not much known about them aside from what was revealed in The Big Bang Theory. The problem is, many of those stories were done primarily for comedy. They were not rooted in CBS&#39; world-building efforts, so it&#39;s difficult, if not almost impossible for Young Sheldon to faithfully execute them. Given this, the family comedy is forced to contradict the established The Big Bang Theory canon for its own storytelling. That means characters like Young Sheldon&#39;s Georgie get more depth. Instead of Sheldon&#39;s family being treated as punch lines, Young Sheldon actually fleshes them out.
