## Literature Review

Despite Robyn Brown&#39;s love for Kody, the Sister Wives star often doesn&#39;t spare him from some harsh words throughout their years of marriage.




Despite Sister Wives star Robyn Brown&#39;s love for Kody Brown, she has said some harsh things to him on the show. Robyn became Kody&#39;s fourth wife when she married him and joined Meri Brown, Christine Brown, and Janelle Brown during Sister Wives season 1. However, almost ten years after their marriage, Robyn and Kody are in a monogamous marriage after the exit of the other wives. Kody&#39;s favoritism of Robyn made him gradually grow apart from his other wives, eventually leading to their exit.
Still, the recently concluded Sister Wives season 18 detailed the end of Kody&#39;s marriage and how it negatively impacted him and the family. However, despite Kody&#39;s claims that he only loved Robyn and how he looked forward to a monogamous marriage with her, Robyn has spoken about how she only wanted a polygamous family and her disappointment in the other wives leaving. While Kody has spoken about feeling safe with Robyn, that hasn&#39;t stopped Robyn from standing her ground and saying some harsh things to Kody.

 8  &#34;We have to stay out of issues between you and a wife&#34; 
Robyn Refused To Pick A Side Between Kody &amp; Janelle
        

In one of the standout scenes from Sister Wives: Talk Back Part 1 special, Robyn and Kody were watching back a Sister Wives season 18 episode that featured Christine, Janelle, and Meri in a discussion when Kody suddenly referred to Janelle as a &#34;s**t sister wife.&#34; Kody&#39;s comment shocked Robyn, who replied, &#34;Wait, wait, wait, whoa, stop. S**t sister wife?&#34; Robyn then called out Kody for making the family&#39;s issues about sister wives instead of focusing on his own problems with his ex-wives.
Although Kody tried to walk back his comment by pointing out they once had a solid family unit before the wives walked and blamed Robyn and him for the family woes, the mother of five reiterated her stance and told her husband to stop blaming the wives. Still, when another clip showed a family conversation where Kody asked Meri and Robyn to comment on Janelle&#39;s behavior, Robyn explained to her husband that she couldn&#39;t interfere at that moment. According to Robyn, as a wife in a plural family, she couldn&#39;t pick a side between Janelle or Kody, noting, &#34;We have to stay out of issues between you and a wife.&#34;

However, while addressing Kody&#39;s favoritism towards her, Robyn explained she had seen the dangers of men favoring one or two wives in a relationship, and she wouldn&#39;t have married Kody if she knew he favored her, noting, &#34;If I would have seen him show favoritism, or not be fair, I would have really probably backed away from it really fast.&#34;
