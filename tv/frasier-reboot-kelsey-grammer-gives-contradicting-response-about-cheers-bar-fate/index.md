#  Frasier Reboot Kelsey Grammer Gives Contradicting Response About Cheers Bar Fate


## SUMMARY 



The fate of Sam&#39;s bar in the Frasier reboot is up for debate, with conflicting statements from different sources about whether it is closed or still open.   

The decision on whether to keep the Cheers bar open or closed in the Frasier reboot has both narrative and nostalgic implications.   

While the status of the Cheers bar remains uncertain, there is still potential for Frasier to reunite with his old Boston pals in the Paramount&#43; series.

## Literature Review
Kelsey Grammer contradicts an original Cheers writer with his own take on what really happened to Sam&#39;s Boston bar in the Frasier reboot. 




Kelsey Grammer contradicts the original Cheers writer about the fate of Sam&#39;s bar in the Frasier reboot. Frasier Crane&#39;s return to Boston in the Paramount&#43; revival gave hope that he would revisit his old drinking hole. After 10 episodes, however, that still hasn&#39;t happened, and there are still expectations that the snooty psychiatrist will find his way back to the iconic pub in future episodes.




Unfortunately, it&#39;s difficult to revisit an establishment when it has already closed its doors. That&#39;s what Grammer said in The Kelly Clarkson Show after he was asked if his character would be reunited with his Boston drinking buddies in the Frasier reboot season 2.


 

Quoting Cheers co-creator, James Burrows, the actor said that the business has gone under. This, however, contradicts series writer, Kevin Levine&#39;s previous revelation that Cheers remains open, with its old owner and regular patrons still there. Read Grammer&#39;s full quote below:


The bar is closed. Jimmy decided it went out of business for whatever reason.

There hasn&#39;t been any in-universe indication about Cheers’ status in the Frasier reboot. Previously, however, Grammer said that those involved in the &#39;80s series didn&#39;t want the revival to feature the pub. This is in line with Burrows&#39; separate comment about being protective of Cheers&#39; legacy, hence not wanting it to be rebooted in any kind of way. However, Levine, who wrote countless brilliant episodes for both the original Frasier and its parent series, claimed in his podcast that Sam is still tending the bar, with Norm and his cohorts still regularly visiting it.

Deciding on the Cheers bar&#39;s fate in the Frasier reboot is quite tricky. Aside from the contradicting comments from people involved in the TV universe, there are issues whether they decide to keep it open or have it closed down. If they decide on the former, it&#39;s somewhat tragic to think that, after three decades, Sam and his patrons continue to engage in silly antics and waste away every night. Meanwhile, the former rules out the possibility of Frasier being back in the underground pub, which would be nostalgic for the revival.




Related   Frasier Reboot’s Refusal To Return To Cheers Hurts Its Most Important Story (Will Season 2 Fix It?)   The Frasier reboot refuses to revisit Cheers despite being set in Boston, effectively disregarding an important piece of the character&#39;s history.     

In any case, the Frasier reboot has plenty of time to decide on the canonical state of the Cheers bar. Perhaps Grammer can have a conversation with Burrows, Levine, and anyone else who has strong opinions about what happened to the establishment. That said, just because its fate is in limbo doesn&#39;t mean that the Paramount&#43; series can&#39;t reunite Frasier with some of his old Boston pals.
