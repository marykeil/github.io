## Literature Review
A Stranger Things Halloween display of Max Mayfield levitating went viral in Plainfield, Illinois in 2022, but how exactly did the display work?




Stranger Things has transcended the boundaries of ordinary television to become a pop cultural phenomenon, proven by the Stranger Things Halloween display. Set against the backdrop of the 1980s, the show masterfully blends elements of science fiction, horror, and nostalgic references to the decade. Popular Stranger Things character Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) levitating stands out as an especially iconic moment. Max defying gravity is not just a triumph of visual storytelling but also a symbol of the show&#39;s ability to merge the supernatural with deep emotional resonance. It&#39;s this kind of storytelling that has inspired Stranger Things fans to recreate the show&#39;s most striking moments in their own ways.




The Appel family from Plainfield, Illinois took their admiration for Stranger Things to an exceptional level. They created a Halloween display that not only showcased their love for the series but also demonstrated their ingenuity and craftsmanship. Their recreation of Max&#39;s season 4 levitation scene in Stranger Things was a marvel of creativity, capturing the otherworldly essence of the show.

It highlighted how a moment from a popular show can ignite the imagination and spark a communal experience, and made many wonder how the Stranger Things Halloween display works.

In Plainfield, the Appels created a sensational Halloween display with a hovering mannequin of Stranger Things&#39; Max Mayfield. This display, intriguingly enough, did not use drones, helium, or balloons. Instead, the Appels chose to keep the levitation method a secret, adding to the display&#39;s allure. Dave Appel emphasized the importance of maintaining the mystery behind the levitation technique, opting not to disclose the specifics (via CBS News), noting:



It&#39;s not drones. It&#39;s not helium or balloons, and we just felt like it was more fun to keep it under wraps.&#34;




Their decision not to reveal the secret behind Max&#39;s levitation kept the mystery alive, much like the show&#39;s enigmatic nature. The couple&#39;s TikTok video showcasing the floating Max went viral, even eliciting a response from Netflix, calling the Appel family the show&#39;s number-one fans. The Stranger Things Halloween display secret still hasn&#39;t been revealed, but the mannequin could be held up by wires connected to poles or trees in the area, though visitors didn&#39;t detect any such thing.





 



 The Stranger Things Halloween Display Controversy Explained 
          

Despite the Stranger Things Halloween display&#39;s popularity, it faced its share of controversies. The influx of visitors drawn by the viral display led to concerns from a neighbor about the crowds (via CBS News). Consequently, the Appels initially decided to dismantle the display after just two nights. However, an outpouring of support from the community and Stranger Things fans led them to reconsider. Dave Appel commented that he didn&#39;t want his neighbor to &#34;ruin the fun for the amazing families and Stranger Things fans who have visited.&#34;




The Appels announced on their &#34;Horror Props&#34; Facebook page and planned to give a &#34;final update&#34; on their @Horrorprops TikTok account, asking fans to hold off on visiting until the situation settled. The family engaged in discussions with local police, other neighbors, and the homeowners&#39; association to find a middle ground. They proposed adjusting the Stranger Things display hours to address concerns and remained closed until receiving approval from Plainfield Village Hall. This incident highlights the delicate balance between creative expression and community harmony, especially in residential areas.
