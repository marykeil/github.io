Summary

  The identity of the thief who stole Zeus&#39; Master Bolt is a shocking twist in Percy Jackson&#39;s journey, with the mystery still being important to the show&#39;s conflicts.   The Master Bolt has yet to be seen in the TV show, and Percy&#39;s characters are still putting clues together to determine who framed Poseidon and his son for the crime.   Luke Castellan, introduced as the claimed son of Hermes, is revealed as the person who stole the Master Bolt in the book, and his motivations stem from his resentment towards the gods and influences from Kronos.  







While Percy Jackson and the Olympians’ TV show could end up going in another direction with the thief, the book reveals a shocking twist regarding who actually stole Zeus’ Master Bolt. Though those who have read the books or seen the 2010 Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief movie are already aware of the thief’s identity, the mystery behind who stole the powerful lightning bolt is still extremely important to Percy’s journey. The quest itself and what Percy learns from it is more important than the person who stole it, though the thief’s reasons, motivations, and deceits will continue to play a significant part in the show’s conflicts after Percy Jackson’s season 1 finale.

The Master Bolt itself has yet to be seen as one of the magical items in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, despite being the central object of Percy’s quest. Though there are various theories about who stole it, primarily Hades, as Percy journeys to the Underworld, Percy Jackson’s characters are still putting clues together to see who might have framed Poseidon and his son for the crime. At the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 5, Grover states that he knows who stole the Master Bolt, but the episode’s cliffhanger fails to include the person’s identity. However, whether Grover’s unknown suggestion is accurate or not, Percy Jackson’s book already has the surprising answer.




                  Percy Jackson And The Olympians Cast &amp; Character Guide   The cast of Percy Jackson and the Olympians for Disney&#43; includes a mix of rising talent and veteran actors to bring Rick Riordan&#39;s books to life.    


 Luke Castellan Stole Zeus&#39; Master Bolt In The Lightning Thief Book 
         

In Rick Riordan’s 2005 book, Luke Castellan is revealed as the titular lightning thief. Introduced as the claimed son of Hermes, Luke’s role in the show so far has been confined to helping Percy feel acclimated at Camp Half-Blood, explaining campers’ goals for glory, relaying backstories about himself, Annabeth, and Thalia, as well as giving Percy his flying shoes. While Luke has had much less of a prominent role in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 so far than he did in the book, his identity as the person who stole the Master Bolt is no less shocking.




At the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief book, Luke reveals to Percy that he stole the Master Bolt. He then traps Percy with a deadly scorpion, confirming that Luke is the “friend” who would betray Percy in his prophecy. Before fleeing Camp Half-Blood, Luke explains how he accomplished the theft: on a winter solstice field trip to Olympus, he snuck into the throne room, stole Zeus’ Master Bolt from his chair as well as Hades’ Helm of Darkness, and left without being caught or found suspicious. The book’s version of the lightning thief’s identity is a huge twist for Percy, and the Disney&#43; TV show is expected to follow suit in its adaptation.



 Why Luke Stole The Bolt In The Book (&amp; Ares&#39; Involvement Explained) 
          

Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1’s Greek god criticisms have already explored the underlying motivation for Luke to steal Zeus’ Master Bolt. In the book, Luke explains that stealing the bolt was partially due to his resentment towards the gods and Hermes, in particular, for abandoning him and the rest of the demigod children. This distaste for the Greek gods caught the attention of his ancestor Kronos, who began to influence Luke and play on his resentments through his dreams and nightmares. Kronos also spoke to Percy in his dreams, but Poseidon’s son was able to ignore Kronos’ manipulations, whereas Luke’s anger was already deep-seated.




                  37 Biggest Changes Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson Show Makes To The Books   Percy Jackson and the Olympians is being praised for its fidelity to the source material, though that does not mean there are no changes to the books.    

Percy Jackson’s first book explained that Kronos had influenced Luke to steal the bolt and frame Percy, and thus the other gods, for the theft in order to incite another war. This largely began after he failed the quest he had been sent on by Hermes, which culminated in Luke receiving a scar on his face from a dragon. Kronos had convinced Luke that his talents were being “wasted” by Percy Jackson’s Greek gods, giving him the villainous quest to steal the Master Bolt instead. Ares then came into play when he intercepted Luke, with Kronos and Luke then convincing Ares to hide the items as a way to begin the war between the gods.



 Who Does Grover Think Stole The Master Bolt In Percy Jackson Episode 5&#39;s Ending? 
          




Since Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 cuts to black before Grover tells Percy and Annabeth who he thinks stole the bolt, his suggestion won’t be revealed until episode 6. Since Grover spent most of episode 5 with Ares at the diner, it seems he’ll think the person who stole the Master Bolt has to be close to Ares. It’s unlikely that Grover will think it was Luke, as Hermes’ son wasn’t brought up during their conversations, but rather another demigod who would have reason to betray Zeus.



New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 release Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Disney&#43;.




Though Ares suggested that Hades wouldn’t have sent anyone to steal it, Percy Jackson’s satyr put forth such a possibility himself. In a twist, Grover could even suggest another god entirely is at fault for stealing the Master Bolt, but this won&#39;t be confirmed until episode 6’s release. Since Grover didn’t tell Percy and Annabeth his theory about who stole Zeus’ Master Bolt after meeting Ares in the book, there isn’t a clear answer as to whose name he will say in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6.
