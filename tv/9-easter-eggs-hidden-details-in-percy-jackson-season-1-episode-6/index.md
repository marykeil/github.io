## Literature Review

Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1, episode 6 continues the trend of including Easter eggs and references to Greek myths and Rick Riordanâ€™s books.




Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1, episode 6 features the famous Lotus Casino scene from Rick Riordan&#39;s books, and it contains a number of Easter eggs and subtle references throughout. The Disney&#43; show regularly nods to the Greek mythology it&#39;s inspired by, as well as the novels it&#39;s based on. Percy Jackson offers insight into ancient myths and teases where its story is going, leaving small clues for viewers to pick up on.
This is a running theme throughout Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1, and it&#39;s likely to continue should the Disney&#43; series be renewed for season 2. Such Easter eggs and references aren&#39;t limited to the TV adaptation either; they can be found in the source material and original movies as well. Percy Jackson episode 6 continues this trend, nodding to Greek myths, Riordan&#39;s later books, and even modern pop culture. Some of these nods are more noticeable than others, but all add layers to the world of gods and demigods.
Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episodes 1-6 are now streaming on Disney&#43;. 










 








 9  Percy Jackson Episode 6&#39;s Title Is A Book Chapter 
&#34;We Take A Zebra To Vegas&#34; Comes From The Lightning Thief
        

All of Percy Jackson season 1&#39;s episode titles are pulled from Riordan&#39;s books, and episode 6&#39;s is no exception. &#34;We Take a Zebra to Vegas&#34; is the chapter of The Lightning Thief that sees Percy, Annabeth, and Grover visiting the Lotus Hotel and Casino. While the Disney&#43; series makes some changes to this part of the Percy Jackson books, similar events unfold in its version of &#34;We Take a Zebra to Vegas.&#34; The title references the animals that escape from &#34;traffickers&#34; as Percy and his friends reach Vegas, a development that leaves Grover hilariously pleased.





 8  Percy&#39;s Dream Sets Up The Main Villain (&amp; Rest Of The Show) 
Episode 6 Teases Season 1&#39;s Ending Twist
        

Percy has another odd dream at the beginning of episode 6, featuring the same voice that&#39;s been taunting him throughout season 1. This voice belongs to the Percy Jackson books&#39; main villain, Kronos, but it&#39;s not speaking to the show&#39;s lead this time around. Percy Jackson&#39;s dream in episode 6 isn&#39;t actually his; he&#39;s intercepting the real Lightning Thief&#39;s dream, which simultaneously sets up multiple story developments. This moment won&#39;t make much sense to newcomers, but fans of Riordan&#39;s books will recognize its importance.





 7  Annabeth References Iris In Percy Jackson Episode 6 
Iris Is The Goddess Of The Rainbow In Greek Mythology
        

Percy Jackson&#39;s trio uses Iris Messaging in episode 6, granting them the ability to call Camp Half-Blood and speak to Luke. Iris Messaging gets its name from the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris, whom Annabeth prays to before reaching out. Iris serves as a messenger for the gods in Greek myths (via Theoi Greek Mythology), so it makes sense that Riordan&#39;s story would use her name for this demigod invention. It allows demigods to communicate at long distances, utilizing a rainbow and a drachma to do so. All of these things are associated with Iris; the Disney&#43; show simply puts a modernized spin on the goddess.





 6  Luke Teases Percabeth In Episode 6 
Recent Episodes Have Hinted At Percy &amp; Annabeth&#39;s Romance


 







When the trio speaks to Luke via Iris Messaging, he jokes that Percy and Annabeth are starting to sound like an &#34;old married couple.&#34; Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians subtly hints at Percy and Annabeth&#39;s blossoming feelings for one another in episode 5, but Luke references Percabeth outright during this scene. It&#39;s made more amusing by the fact that Annabeth has a crush on Luke in the books, a romance subplot the Percy Jackson show rightfully cut. Although Annabeth and Percy won&#39;t get together any time soon, the show is already teasing their romance.





 5  Dua Lipa&#39;s &#34;Levitating&#34; Plays When The Trio Enters The Casino 
The Song Replaces Lady Gaga&#39;s &#34;Pokerface&#34; From The Movies
        

The Percy Jackson casino episode had the perfect chance to reference the movies by playing Lady Gaga&#39;s &#34;Pokerface&#34; when Percy, Annabeth, and Grover entered the Lotus Hotel and Casino. Instead, the series opts for a more recent musical hit: Dua Lipa&#39;s &#34;Levitating.&#34; This will be recognizable to most viewers, as it was Billboard&#39;s top song of 2021. It only plays for a moment, but it makes the trio&#39;s entrance into the casino that much more entertaining.





 4  Percy Jackson References The Lotus-Eaters 
The Story Offers A New Take On The Odyssey
        

Percy Jackson episode 6 offers a new take on the Lotus-Eaters, a group referenced in Greek mythology and The Odyssey. The Lotus-Eaters resided on an island, where they ate Lotus flowers in order to remain in a state of bliss (via Greek Boston). Riordan&#39;s books put a spin on this, with the Lotus Hotel and Casino pumping Lotus flowers into the air to keep guests from realizing the time or remembering life outside the establishment. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover fall into this trap, which hilariously combines the Lotus Eaters with the tactics casinos often use to keep gamblers there.





 3  Lin-Manuel Miranda&#39;s Hermes Pokes Fun At The Greek God 
His Mail Delivery Line Is Hilarious


 







&#34;We Take a Zebra to Vegas&#34; sees Percy meeting Lin-Manuel Miranda&#39;s Hermes, and the character is equal parts funny and tragic. One of his more comical lines sees him telling Annabeth and Percy how he can manipulate space and time, then jesting that this is why he &#34;delivers the mail.&#34; Since Hermes is known as a messenger god, it makes sense that this is his role in the Percy Jackson world. Still, this blunt line highlights the hilarity of mixing Greek mythology with the modern world.





 2  Hermes&#39; Discussion With Percy Hints At Season 1&#39;s Betrayal 
His Inability To Interfere With Luke&#39;s Destiny Is Tragic
        

Luke will betray Percy and Olympus before Percy Jackson season 1 is over, and Hermes&#39; neglect is partly responsible for his son&#39;s actions. While Percy and Hermes speak to one another in episode 6, Hermes reflects on how difficult it is for parents to watch helplessly as their children struggle. This line is uttered in reference to Poseidon, but it hints at Luke&#39;s betrayal and character arc. The Percy Jackson books reveal that Hermes can&#39;t intervene in Luke&#39;s destiny, and that tragedy is set up by his conversation with Percy in &#34;We Take a Zebra to Vegas.&#34;





 1  Grover&#39;s Experience At The Casino Hints At His Fate 
The Satyr Will Be The One To Find Pan


 







Grover gets separated from Annabeth and Percy in Percy Jackson episode 6, and he finds another satyr trapped in the White Lotus Hotel and Casino: Augustus. Augustus rambles about searching for Pan, and the two bond before Grover wanders off to play a virtual-reality game. After the trio escapes the casino, Grover tells Percy that the game made him feel like he&#39;d truly found Pan. This line, as well as Augustus&#39; introduction, foreshadow Grover&#39;s book storyline. Grover is the first Searcher to find Pan in the books, and Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians is already setting it up.
