## Literature Review
The Flaming Moe has been an iconic Simpsons drink since 1991 - here&#39;s how you can make it in real life! 




In 1991, The Simpsons aired an episode titled &#39;Flaming Moe&#39;s&#39;, featuring a supposedly incredible drink that shoots Moe&#39;s Tavern to fame and fortune - here&#39;s how to make it in real life. The episode appears in the third season of the show, and starts with Moe struggling financially - which is unsurprising, given that the only people who are regularly there are Homer and his friends. However, things start to look up when Homer gives him the recipe for a drink of his own invention: the Flaming Homer. However, Moe ends up claiming it for himself, and then finding huge success from selling them, even re-naming the bar to Flaming Moe&#39;s... but losing his friendship with Homer in the process. Eventually, he is about to sell the drink for a million dollars (and split it with Homer) but, not knowing this, Homer reveals the secret out of spite, allowing anyone to make the drink. Moe no longer has exclusivity, and Springfield returns to normal.




This episode should not be confused with another episode with an almost-identical title: &#39;Flaming Moe&#39;. Airing in 2011 as part of the 22nd season of the show, this episode sees the Tavern become a gay bar, as part of a complex plot to help Smithers gain Mr Burns&#39; respect. However, there are some similarities between the two (beyond the name) - in both, Moe and his bar are the central story, Moe finds success and begins to move up in the world, but is brought down by the person who helped him (and his bar) get there. And of course, Springfield resets, ready for a new episode.

                  The Simpsons Season 36: Renewal, Cast &amp; Everything We Know   The Simpsons season 36 will carry Springfield&#39;s most famous family through into 2025, and here&#39;s everything we know about the show&#39;s return on Fox.    


 How To Make The Flaming Moe Drink From The Simpsons 
         




The true recipe for the Flaming Moe (or Flaming Homer) is never revealed in the show, but Cocktail Chemistry has recreated the recipe from what is seen on the show. The scene where Homer describes making the drink involves a view of several bottles which are poured into a blender, as well as (of course) cough syrup. In a video, Cocktail Chemistry breaks down the bottles that are visible in this scene, and uses them to re-create the cocktail.


 

Unfortunately, the resulting mix is truly disgusting, and impossible to light - which is to be expected, given the ingredients! However, he then goes on to recreate a much better version of the cocktail, which looks the same as the Flaming Moe from the series, but which is actually drinkable. Because few drinks would actually light on fire (thanks to alcohol content), the new and improved Flaming Moe also includes a little lime &#39;boat&#39; of liquor that will set alight, to give an authentic Flaming Moe look.




 Original Flaming Moe  Improved Flaming Moe   4oz (120ml) tequila  .75oz (22ml) creme de violette   4oz (120ml) creme de menthe  .75oz (22ml) Cointreau   4oz (120ml) peppermint schnapps  .75oz (22ml) dry gin   2oz (60ml) children&#39;s cough syrup  .75oz (22ml) lime juice   





 Does Duff Beer Exist In Real Life? 
          

While the Flaming Moe is one of the most iconic drinks from the series, it&#39;s not the only one - or the most famous! The biggest drink in the series is, of course, Duff Beer, which is Homer&#39;s drink of choice. Duff appears in episodes every season, and there are multiple episodes centered on it - and on Duff-Man, the mascot for the company. There are even parodies and knock-offs of Duff within the Simpsons universe (like Fudd), and a crossover revealed that in Family Guy, Pawtucket Patriot is simply Duff with a different label. However, there is no officially licensed Duff Beer in real life - although there are various brands of beer called Duff around the world. The closest officially recognized variant available is the Duff energy drink at The Simpsons Kwik-E-Mart at Universal Studios.






In 2016, Duff Beer was included in Time&#39;s Most Influential Fake Companies Of All Time list.




             The Simpsons The Simpsons is a long-running animated TV series created by Matt Groening that satirically follows a working-class family in the misfit city of Springfield. Homer, a bit of a schmoe who works at a nuclear power plant, is the provider for his family, while his wife, Marge, tries to keep sanity and reason in the house to the best of her ability. Bart is a born troublemaker, and Lisa is his super-intelligent sister who finds herself surrounded by people who can&#39;t understand her. Finally, Maggie is the mysterious baby who acts as a deus ex machina when the series calls for it. The show puts the family in several wild situations while constantly tackling socio-political and pop-culture topics set within their world, providing an often sharp critique of the subjects covered in each episode. This series first premiered in 1989 and has been a staple of Fox&#39;s programming schedule ever since.
