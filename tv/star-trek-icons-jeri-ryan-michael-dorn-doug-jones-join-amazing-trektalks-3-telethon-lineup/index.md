TrekTalks 3 kicks off 2024 with an incredible way for fans to see over 60 of their favorite Star Trek actors and creatives live, all to benefit a fantastic cause, the Hollywood Food Coalition. Among the featured panels of TrekTalks 3 is a panel celebrating Star Trek: Picard season 3 that includes Jonathan Frakes, Jeri Ryan, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Brent Spiner, Todd Stashwick, Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut, and showrunner Terry Matalas moderated by Jonathan Del Arco. Frakes is also part of &#34;Those Old Scientists,&#34; a Star Trek: Strange New Worlds panel celebrating the crossover episode with Star Trek: Lower Decks. Frakes will be joined by Tawny Newsome and writers Bill Wolkoff and Kathryn Lyn.

Another exciting TrekTalks 3 panel is the Tuvix Panel discussing the controversial but enduringly popular &#34;Tuvix&#34; episode of Star Trek: Voyager that was spotlighted in Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4&#39;s premiere. The Tuvix Panel includes Tim Russ, Tom Wright, Ethan Phillips, and Lisa Klink moderated by The Delta Flyers hosts Robert Duncan McNeill and Garrett Wang. Another must-see panel is Tomorrow&#39;s Yesterdays, a retrospective of Women in Star Trek featuring Michelle Hurd, Dawnn Lewis, Adelle Simmons, and Marian Smothers hosted by the Syfy Sistas. Even more Star Trek guests and panels will make TrekTalks 3 a can&#39;t-miss full day of viewing that will hopefully exceed the amount raised in 2023 for the Hollywood Food Coalition.
