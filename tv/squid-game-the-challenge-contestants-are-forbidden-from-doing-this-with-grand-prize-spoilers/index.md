## Literature Review
Squid Game: The Challenge season 1&#39;s winner is sharing more information about the largest grand prize in Netflix history, a massive $4.56 million.




Squid Game: The Challenge’s first ever winner shared more information about their incredible $4.56 million grand prize, including what they’re surprisingly forbidden from doing with it. After an incredible power struggle, only three players were left standing at the beginning of the Netflix series’ finale episode. Player 016, Sam Lantz, player 451, Phil Cain, and player 287 Mai Whelan were the finalists moving into the last episode, with Phil being eliminated before the final game. With Sam and Mai left in the game, their intense game of Rock, Paper, Scissors ended with Mai stunned she was able to beat the other 455 players of Squid Game: The Challenge season 1.




According to an interview with the Daily Mail, as the winner of Squid Game: The Challenge, “Whelan said that contracts signed by the participants forbid them from giving any winnings to other contestants.” Mai may not be able to share her winnings directly, but she hopes to share some of her winnings with charities. She did share that she’s only made one large purchase, a designer outfit for the finale viewing party of Squid Game: The Challenge season 1. “I still have buyer’s remorse from that, but I think it’s well deserved,” Mai shared.


 Mai Whelan Hasn’t Received Squid Game: The Challenge Grand Prize Yet 
          

While Mai is excited about her massive cash prize, she revealed that she has yet to actually receive the money from Netflix yet. “I feel like Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire,” Mai joked. “Show me the money!” It’s likely that Mai’s prize was being held until Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 finished airing, but she’s still waiting to hear from the major streaming service about collecting her prize money. Mai will most likely receive her prize money now that the finale of the season has aired.





 

Mai, who was one of the more interesting players on Squid Game: The Challenge season 1, became a part of the conversation surrounding the series when she began to have issues with another player, Ashley Tolbert. Ashley, player 278, decided to go against the rest of the players when they’d come to a conclusion during the Glass Bridge game, and Mai spoke out about Ashley’s behavior. While Ashley received pushback from the viewers of Squid Game: The Challenge, Mai got flack from the other players within the game, giving her reason to eliminate Ashley during the dice game.

With Squid Game: The Challenge coming to an end, Mai has been lauded as the most compelling player in the game. From her complicated background to the moves she made in the game, Mai has had a lot to say about the production of the series and the way she felt throughout the experience. Once she receives her prize money, the Squid Game: The Challenge winner will likely be even more open to discussing her time on the show.
