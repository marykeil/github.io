## Literature Review
In 9-1-1 Maddie &amp; Chimney&#39;s time away from LA in Boston after Jee-Yun&#39;s birth shows the reality of postpartum depression.




When Maddie left 9-1-1 followed by Chimney, there was a lot of concern among viewers that the characters wouldn&#39;t return. In season 5, Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Chimney (Kenneth Choi) left their home and friends in Los Angeles, taking an extended break before returning nine episodes later no longer a couple. Maddie&#39;s last prior appearance was in season 5, episode 3, &#34;Desperate Measures,&#34; with Chimney leaving to find her in episode 4, &#34;Home and Away.&#34; While there were production reasons for the break, namely Jennifer Love Hewitt&#39;s own pregnancy, the in-universe 9-1-1 storyline to justify it ended up being one of its most realistic plot arcs â€” an honest portrayal of postpartum depression.




Maddie has had a hard journey since she replaced Connie Britton&#39;s Abby. After giving birth to their daughter Jee-Yun at the end of season 4, Maddie began experiencing post-partum depression. This continued into season 5, resulting in her leaving her daughter at the firehouse with a video message for Chimney. After learning why she left, Chimney took Jee-Yun and went to find her, causing some fans to wonder if Chimney would leave too. They reunited in episode 12, but Maddie was not in a place where she could start a family with him as they&#39;d planned, and she still had too much to work through before they could rekindle their romance.

 Maddie And Chimney Leaving 9-1-1 Made Sense For The Story 
Maddie&#39;s Post-Partum Struggles Made For A Grounded Storyline For The Couple
          




An interview with executive producer Tim Minear suggested that there&#39;s more to Maddie&#39;s story: &#34;It&#39;s a story that I don&#39;t want to give short shrift to. It will end up creating a major complication for Season 5&#34; (via TVline). The 9-1-1 season 5 complication he referred to could be Maddie&#39;s departure, but if the storyline remains prominent, there&#39;s doubtless more to Maddie&#39;s arc now that she&#39;s returned. Both Kenneth Choi and Jennifer Love Hewitt were still credited as 9-1-1 main cast members throughout Maddie and Chimney&#39;s absence, so the chances that either would be written out permanently were always slim.

After investing in Maddie and Chimney&#39;s struggles bringing Jee-Yun into the world, 9-1-1 audiences would most likely find either of them being written out incredibly frustrating. The break makes sense for 9-1-1&#39;s narrative arcs, but behind-the-scenes circumstances influenced the decision too. In September 2021, Hewitt gave birth to her third child, and she needed time off from 9-1-1 for her pregnancy and maternity leave. Maddie&#39;s departure both allowed Hewitt to take some time for her new baby and furthered Maddie&#39;s plot. It was dramatic and gave weight to what the 9-1-1 character had been dealing with.





 

The phone call from Maddie to Buck was likely recorded in a studio, which would have been easier for Hewitt than being on-set. Her absence was designed to free Hewitt from filming requirements while keeping Maddie a plot-relevant character. When Maddie returned nine episodes later, it felt natural. Maddie has been through a lot, so taking a break from LA would have made sense even if Hewitt didn&#39;t need the time off-screen. Moreso, Chimney&#39;s departure also made a lot of sense for the character.

Having him leave for a few episodes to look for her both advanced the plot and developed them as one of the best 9-1-1 couples. It&#39;s also a strong message from the show that people dealing with post-partum depression don&#39;t have to go through it alone and that support from family can be crucial. Their split further added to the realism of their story, showing the struggles of both of them.

 How Maddie And Chimney Reconciled In 9-1-1 Season 6 
Maddie And Chimney&#39;s Relationship Has Significantly Grown
   

Luckily, Chimney isn&#39;t leaving 9-1-1 and he and Maddie managed something of a reconciliation in 9-1-1 season 6. Despite the pair breaking up and deciding to focus on co-parenting in season 5, Maddie&#39;s apartment springs a leak in the 9-1-1 season 6 premiere episode. This prompts Chimney to suggest Maddie should temporarily move in with him and Jee-Yun. All it takes is for the pair to spend one night together, and when Chimney and Maddie have a one-night stand, Maddie admits that she&#39;s done running and wants the three of them to be a proper family again. Considering everything the couple has gone through, their reconciliation was a triumphant moment for audiences.




9-1-1 season 6 not only saw their reunion, but it also actually saw them take more steps forward in their relationship. In 9-1-1 season 6, episode 9, &#34;Red Flag,&#34; Maddie and Chimney decide that they want to buy a house together. Chimney had fallen in love with a particular house, dubbed &#34;Murder House&#34; as a fun little Easter egg reference to Ryan Murphy&#39;s American Horror Story. The following installment, &#34;In a Flash,&#34; picks up a couple of months later and sees them living in the completely refurbished &#34;Murder House&#34; home. It seems that they&#39;re finally getting some well-deserved peace going into 9-1-1 season 7.
