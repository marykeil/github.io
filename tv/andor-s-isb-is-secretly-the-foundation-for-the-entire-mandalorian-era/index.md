## Literature Review
The Empire has survived into The Mandalorian era, and surprisingly, Andor&#39;s ISB is the major reason - drawing the threads of Star Wars together again!




Andor season 1 gave audiences a more in-depth look at the Imperial Security Bureau or the ISB, and this espionnage group paved the way for the Empire’s survival into The Mandalorian era. Andor had many different storylines to handle, but one of the most interesting followed Dedra Meero and her journey trying to find rebels through her role at the ISB. Andor’s ISB plot line showed the internal conflicts within the Imperial institution and how the rebel cells were able to grow while being largely undetected.




Originally established in Legends, the ISB was responsible for (often covertly) ensuring the long-term survival of the Empire. ISB agents like Dedra Meero were responsible for identifying threats and ensuring contingencies had been put in place, meaning they knew the galaxy inside out. When the Empire fell, this knowledge likely made ISB officers invaluable to keep the Imperial remnants afloat.

                  Why Star Wars Has Delayed Andor Season 2   Lucasfilm has officially pushed back Andor season 2, even though only two weeks of filming remained. What&#39;s going on with Star Wars this time..?    


 Andor&#39;s ISB Is The Reason The Empire Survived Into The Mandalorian Era 
          

Imperial bases that were still operational during The Mandalorian season 2, were established by the Imperial ISB. Bases like the one on Morak, which was featured in The Mandalorian season 2, episode 7 “Chapter 15: The Believer,” were put there because the ISB knew the location wouldn’t warrant a lot of attention, and was fairly well hidden. Even Din Djarin didn’t think there was anything on Morak when Migs Mayfeld said there was an Imperial mining hub there. This shows the success of the ISB and their ways.






The Mandalorian season 2, episode 7 &#34;Chapter 15: The Believer&#34; is also the episode where Din Djarin breaks his Mandalorian creed and shows his face to multiple people, including Migs Mayfeld.




Given their deep understanding of the different parts of the galaxy, the ISB was bound to have some victories. Not only did they know the different systems of the galaxy, but they were also aware of the criminal underground and where and how they operated, meaning the ISB could pick targets that wouldn’t draw attention from rebels or crime syndicates. It’s not known who established the Imperial mining hub on Morak, but it’s apparent that their homework paid off, especially since it was still operating at such a high level when it was seen in The Mandalorian season 2.



 The ISB Even Worked  ly With Grand Admiral Thrawn 
          




Grand Admiral Thrawn was one of the most well-respected members of the Empire, and he was a master strategist, sometimes purposefully losing a battle, to gain insight and knowledge that would eventually lead to him destroying his enemy. As revealed in Star Wars Rebels and Timothy Zahn&#39;s novels, Grand Admiral Thrawn had a good relationship with many ISB officers; this likely means he&#39;ll have a better idea of the bases they established than any other members of the Imperial Shadow Council in The Mandalorian era. It will be interesting to see where Andor season 2 goes with the ISB, and whether any elements serve as setup for Thrawn&#39;s return in a later era.
