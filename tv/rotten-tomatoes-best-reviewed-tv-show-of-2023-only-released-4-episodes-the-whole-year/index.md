## Literature Review
Rotten Tomatoes list of the best TV shows in 2023 may be surprising, especially because its top pick only released four episodes for the entire year.




With 2023 now complete, many entertainment critics and sites are releasing their top TV shows of the year, and Rotten Tomatoes is no different, except its top series of the year, Invincible, is a unique choice because of how few episodes it actually released in 2023. Invincible is an adult animated superhero series that follows Mark Grayson, a young man who is the son of the most powerful superhero on the planet, and furthermore, begins to develop powers of his own when he turns 17. The series has released one and half seasons so far.




Since it first premiered in 2021, Invincible has been an unexpected standout among television series. Though adult animated series can struggle to stand out among live action television, Invincible has managed to carve a niche for itself, garnering a wide and dedicated audience. Not only does this have to do with the show&#39;s actual plot, but it also has quite a star-studded cast, including Steven Yuen, Sandra Oh, and J.K. Simmons. All in all, the success of Invincible is far from a surprise, but in 2023 specifically, it is quite an interesting feat.

                  Why Invincible Season 2 Has Viewers Split Over 1 Key Difference From The Comics   Most adaptations don&#39;t please each and every fan; here&#39;s why Invincible season 2 has viewers split over one key difference from Kirkman&#39;s comics.    


 Invincible Is Rotten Tomatoes&#39; Best-Reviewed Show Of 2023 (Despite Only Dropping 4 Episodes) 
          




What is especially intriguing about Invincible being ranked as Rotten Tomatoes&#39; top show of 2023 is that the series only released four episodes during the entire year. In November 2023, Invincible released the first four episodes of its second season. The last four are set to be released in early 2024. This means there are eight total episodes in Invincible season 2, but even with just the first half, Rotten Tomatoes still ranked the series at the very top. This is a pretty impressive feat for the show, especially considering its genre and format.

In this way, there is little doubt that Invincible deserved this spot on Rotten Tomatoes&#39; list. If the series is able to awe audiences with just Invincible season 2, part 1&#39;s ending, then that show is clearly doing something that other television series are not. Furthermore, the success of the first half of Invincible season 2 means that it is very likely that when Invincible season 2, part 2 answers questions and wraps up loose ends, it will be just as good, if not better. Overall, this is all very exciting news for Invincible and its fans.






 Invincible Season 2&#39;s Reception Bodes Well For The Amazon Series&#39; Future 
          

Ultimately, Invincible season 2&#39;s reception is a sign that the series will continue to impress and succeed. As previously mentioned, it seems likely that Invincible season 2, part 2 will be just as great as its predecessor, and additionally, it would make sense that the show would quickly be confirmed for a third season once season 2 is fully released. All in all, Invincible&#39;s current success means that there will undoubtedly be more episodes to enjoy, and hopefully, the show can continue to ride this high.
