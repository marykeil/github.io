# Detective Pikachu 2 Return Gets Disappointing Update From OG Star


## SUMMARY 



  Detective Pikachu 2&#39;s development has been slow and uncertain, with even the cast not knowing much about the movie&#39;s timeline.   Original star Justice Smith shared that he hasn&#39;t received any calls about pushing forward with the sequel.   The production delays are likely due to changes in crew members and the impact of SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, slowing the release of Detective Pikachu 2.

## Literature Review

Exclusive: After five years of little development, Detective Pikachu 2 gets an extremely disappointing update from original star Justice Smith.




Star Justice Smith has a disappointing update about Detective Pikachu 2. The 2019 live-action adaptation of the Detective Pikachu video game starred Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and Smith as the Pokémon trainer Tim Goodman. With Pikachu&#39;s help, Goodman desperately tries to uncover the secret behind his father&#39;s disappearance. Even though a sequel was greenlit before the movie&#39;s release, that follow-up has not yet been released. Furthermore, updates on Detective Pikachu 2 have been somewhat fraught to the point where even the cast does not know much about the movie&#39;s developmental timeline.




In an interview with a Screen Rant representative, Smith revealed that he has not yet been contacted by the studio. The actor even shared that any updates he received about the movie came straight from the media, rather than the director or his agent. Check out his quote below:


&#34;I have not heard of any movement. I mean, I know what was released online, but no one has called me. So I&#39;m just waiting for that call.&#34;



 Will Detective Pikachu 2 Happen? 
          

It has been nearly five years since Detective Pikachu was first released in May 2019. With little word on Detective Pikachu 2, what once looked like a near-certainty has slowly evaporated into a less likely development. There are still plans to develop the movie, but, given the original&#39;s success, it is somewhat strange that Legendary Pictures and Toho have not been moving faster in developing a sequel.




                  Pokémon&#39;s Movie Future After Detective Pikachu Explained   Now that Detective Pikachu is out in theaters, what Pokémon movies are next? Here&#39;s what we know about the future of the franchise.   

With a budget of $150 million, the original managed to bring in $450 million, which easily became a financial success. The movie also had the dual purpose of spreading the love of Pokémon to another medium, drawing even more attention to the already massive franchise. The Pokémon Company, which owns the Pokémon franchise, could have easily developed a quick follow-up to get even more of a solid base in the movie sphere, especially during a time when video game adaptations are at their peak. 



The original Detective Pikachu movie is not available for streaming on any platform.




While there have been no specified reasons for the delay, there are potential factors. Last year, there were changes to the creative team. Oren Uziel was originally the movie&#39;s screenwriter, while Rob Letterman would direct. Now, Chris Galletta has been tapped as the screenwriter, and Jonathan Krisel will be directing. Furthermore, the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes probably pushed back the developments. If Reynolds were to return in the sequel, the actor would not be available for a while since he is still filming Deadpool 3, which is considered a priority movie. So, while there is still hope for Detective Pikachu 2, it is probably not ready to go into production.
