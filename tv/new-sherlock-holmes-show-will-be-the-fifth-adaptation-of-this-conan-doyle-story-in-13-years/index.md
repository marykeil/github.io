## Literature Review
CBS’s upcoming Watson TV show will join a long list of Sherlock Holmes adaptations to have borrowed from one of the detective’s most famous stories.




Watson, CBS’s recently announced modern Sherlock Holmes adaptation starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character, is borrowing from a classic Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s story that many recent Sherlock movies and shows have covered. The world of Sherlock Holmes is returning to the small screen with CBS’s Watson show, which will be set in the modern day and will follow John Watson one year after the death of Sherlock Holmes at the hands of Professor Moriarty. Watson will join BBC’s Sherlock and CBS’s Elementary as modern adaptations of the famous detective&#39;s lore for television.




The conclusion of Elementary combined with the lack of solid updates on Sherlock season 5 seemed to indicate the end of Sherlock Holmes-inspired TV shows. This will now change with Watson, which promises a different spin on the world of Sherlock Holmes by focusing on John Watson instead. The series is set to combine medical drama with a detective story with Watson taking center stage now that Sherlock is dead.


 Watson’s Premise Adapts Sherlock Holmes’ Death From “The Final Problem” 
          

The upcoming Watson TV show is partially using “The Final Problem” as its premise, as Sherlock Holmes will have died after a confrontation with Moriarty. Whether Sherlock will turn out to be alive like in the source material is difficult to say, but the concept of Sherlock having died at the hands of his great nemesis will be part of the show. It is also difficult to say how much of Watson’s life before Sherlock’s death will be part of the series, and whether there will be flashbacks exploring the characters of Holmes and Moriarty. Regardless, killing off Sherlock makes for an interesting setup for a Watson show.

Although “The Final Problem” was meant to be the end of Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, the finality of it was retconned during “The Adventure of the Empty House.” From an in-universe perspective, the time during which Watson believed his best friend was dead is incredibly important, and it can make for a great show even if set in a modern context. Naturally, the Watson series will have to establish Sherlock and John’s relationship in some way so that audiences know how much the latter has changed after the former’s death. However, Watson will not be the first Sherlock adaptation to explore this, as “The Final Problem” has been adapted several times.



 Every Recent Adaptation Of Sherlock Holmes’ The Final Problem” Explained 
         




The most recent Sherlock Holmes adaptations for film and television have borrowed a lot from “The Final Problem,” “The Adventures of the Empty House,” and Professor Moriarty&#39;s character as a whole. Following the introduction of Moriarty as a shadowy figure at the end of Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes, the master of crime was the main antagonist in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. The second of Robert Downey Jr.’s Sherlock movies partially adapted “The Final Problem,” including the presumable deaths of both Holmes and Moriarty after they fell down the Reichenbach Falls. Downey Jr.’s Holmes wasn’t “dead” for long, though, as he reapers at the end of the film.

BBC’s Sherlock, one of the most influential adaptations of Conan Doyle’s work in recent years, reimagined Holmes as a modern-day character. Despite the different settings, Sherlock covered some of the most famous Sherlock Holmes stories, including the death of the character. Although the series used “The Final Problem” for season 1’s finale, it was during season 2, episode 3 that the deaths of Jim Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes happened. The “Reichenbach Falls” was reimagined into a metaphorical fall of grace for Sherlock’s reputation, but Holmes eventually fell to his death from the top of a building. The character would then return in Sherlock season 3, episode 1.




Curiously, BBC’s Sherlock adapted “The Final Problem” twice, with the second example being a more meta take on the story. The Abominable Bride, a TV special released between seasons 3 and 4, saw Sherlock trying to solve a case from the 19th century as he tried to make sense of how Jim Moriarty could still be alive. Full of meta references to Conan Doyle’s stories and the show itself, The Abominable Bride briefly recreated the original illustration by Sidney Paget from the scene in which Sherlock and Moriarty fall to their deaths. Lastly, CBS’s Elementary series finale also did a Sherlock death fakeout.



 Why Sherlock Holmes Adaptations Love “The Final Problem” (&amp; Moriarty) 
          

The concept of two arch nemesis fighting a deadly battle that ends with both of them dying, only for the hero to return and reveal it was all part of their plans is too good not to be used in movies or TV shows. Additionally, whereas most Sherlock Holmes stories are self-contained and therefore interchangeable when it comes to reading order, “The Final Problem” has major implications for the futures of the characters involved – which is great for adaptations. A Game of Shadows and Sherlock season 2’s finale exemplify how cinematic Sherlock’s confrontation with Moriarty can be.






Sherlock Holmes’ death as a result of his clash with Moriarty is already a well-established pop culture concept.




Additionally, in a post The Dark Knight industry, every fascinating hero needs an equally fascinating villain that completes them. This is why recent Sherlock adaptations, be they period pieces or modern stories, seem to love Moriarty. After so many versions of that story have been told in film and television in a little over a decade, the premise of the Watson series can work even for those who are not familiar with the source material. Sherlock Holmes’ death as a result of his clash against Moriarty is already a well-established pop culture concept, which is why it can work so well as the setup for a new Watson series.
