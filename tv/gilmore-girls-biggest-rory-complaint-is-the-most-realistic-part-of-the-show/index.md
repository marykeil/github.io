## Literature Review
The biggest complaint about Rory Gilmore throughout Gilmore Girls is also the same reason her character and the show are both so realistic.




One major complaint about Rory Gilmore&#39;s character arc on Gilmore Girls also happens to be the most realistic part of the series. The youngest of the titular Gilmore Girls, Rory is the sweet and studious daughter of Lorelai Gilmore, who got pregnant with Rory when she was a teenager. After leaving her privileged life with her wealthy parents behind, Lorelai worked hard to give Rory the opportunities she gave up to raise her daughter on her own terms.




Rory is a very intelligent bookworm who is portrayed as somewhat of a &#34;good girl.&#34; However, Rory is far from perfect, and there are several issues with her character. Rewatching Gilmore Girls reveals a lot of harsh realities about Rory Gilmore&#39;s character that weren&#39;t all that apparent when the show first aired. However, the biggest criticism Rory receives the most today is actually what makes the show so realistic.

                  10 Harsh Realities Of Rewatching Gilmore Girls 23 Years Later   While Gilmore Girls is a favorite dramedy for many viewers of a certain vintage, re-watching the cult classic unearths some harsh realities.    


 Rory&#39;s Behavior In The Later Seasons Of Gilmore Girls Gets A Lot Of Flack 
          

In the earlier seasons, while she&#39;s still in high school, Rory comes off as more likable and easier to root for. When she gets to college, however, Rory comes face to face with the real world and encounters many academic and interpersonal obstacles. This impacts her behavior, and she starts to make poor decisions, like sleeping with Dean while he is married, dropping out of Yale, and sabotaging her career.




                  Gilmore Girls Cast: Where They Are Now   Gilmore Girls made huge stars out of its cast, including Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, and Melissa McCarthy. What are the actors doing now?    

Rory is very stubborn and has always had a hard time accepting when things don&#39;t go according to plan, but these traits are magnified as she gets older. Because of her changes in behavior in the later seasons of Gilmore Girls, older Rory gets a lot of flack. She is often called out for acting irrationally and making erratic and downright stupid decisions as she gets older. It is true that Rory messed up a lot in Gilmore Girls, especially in the later seasons, and this shouldn&#39;t be immune from criticism. However, Rory&#39;s evolution on the show is actually a great aspect of Gilmore Girls for one particular reason.



 Rory Gilmore Changing After High School Is The Most Realistic Thing About The Show 
          




Rory was bound to change after she graduated from high school because change is a part of growing up. Rory realizing that the rest of the world isn&#39;t like Stars Hollow or even Chilton is a very common experience for people who grew up in small towns and communities and those who excelled in high school (or, in Rory&#39;s case, both). Her sheltered life may have caused her to act a little entitled and blind to her privilege as she gets older, but this just makes her behavior change more realistic.

Getting humbled by adult life and the &#34;real world&#34; is all too familiar for someone Rory&#39;s age, and while she may not have handled everything all that well, neither do most people in these real situations. Rory went from being a big fish in a small pond to discovering that the world is vast and scary, and she&#39;s not always going to do the right thing. She shouldn&#39;t be demonized for this, but rather, cut a little slack. Rory has her fair share of flaws on Gilmore Girls, but growing up shouldn&#39;t be seen as one of them.
