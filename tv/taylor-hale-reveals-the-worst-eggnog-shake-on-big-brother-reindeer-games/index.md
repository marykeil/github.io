## Literature Review
Big Brother Reindeer Games contestant Taylor Hale opens up about the eggnog drinks she tasted in a recent competition and reveals the worst one.




Big Brother Reindeer Games star Taylor Hale shared her reaction to one of the recent challenges on the series where the competitors had to taste some interesting iterations of eggnog. Taylor won Big Brother 24 and has been adamant that she wanted distance from reality TV after the way she was treated on the series. After experiencing some intense bullying in the house, Taylor was able to align with people who eventually had her back and helped her through the game. Taking her game into her own hands by the end, Taylor was the first ever player to win the game and America’s Favorite Houseguest.




In a recent episode of Big Brother Reindeer Games, Taylor and several other competitors were tasked with drinking some interesting flavors of eggnog that were meant to make them a bit uneasy. Each eggnog was created to symbolize a style of food, like fast food or seafood, and players were meant to identify one ingredient in the eggnog to win points in the game. On Twitter, Taylor shared that “the BBQ” eggnog was the worst one, explaining, “Blended chicken, beef, hot dog amongst other stuff...none of them actually tasted awful, it was the texture that would always get me [nauseous].”

While Taylor may not have been excited about the eggnog flavors, she was able to use her taste buds to her advantage and win the competition, securing herself a spot in the finale. Throughout Big Brother Reindeer Games, Taylor has shown that she’s a true competitor.

Taylor’s time on Big Brother Reindeer Games has proven that she has the strength and ability to become a true Big Brother legend in the future.

The Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 finale airs Thursday, December 21 at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.
