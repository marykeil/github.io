The Traitors US season 2 episode 3 introduced a major plot twist for the traitors--murder in plain sight--and it&#39;s a true game-changer. During The Traitors season 2 premiere, host Alan Cumming chose Dan Gheesling and Phaedra Parks as the first two traitors. On the first night, they murdered Johnny &#34;Bananas&#34; Devenanzio in the traditional manner of sending a letter via Alan to Johnny&#39;s room stating that he was eliminated from the game. They then had to recruit a third member, and they chose Parvati. The trio then murdered Marcus Jordan. However, on The Traitors season 2 episode 3, Alan revealed that the third murder would be a murder in plain sight.

There would be no secret meeting in the turret, but rather the traitors would have to carry out the diabolical deed by the end of the night, right in front of their fellow contestants, without getting caught. The traitors had to retrieve a poisoned chalice hidden in a set of Shakespeare&#39;s tragedies from the library, and then somehow get one of the faithfuls to drink from it, murdering them with a slow-acting poison. The traitors would not know when the poison would take its murderous effect. This twist is a game-changer that will make committing murder so much harder for the traitors.

 The Traitors Are Being Challenged Like Never Before 

 

This Traitors season 2 twist of having to murder a faithful in plain sight has never been seen before on the US version of the show. On season 1, all of the murders were carried out in the traditional manner. Therefore, there&#39;s no precedent for how this should be done. When the traitors read the letter informing them about their diabolical task, in their confessionals, Parvati said that it was &#34;dark,&#34; while Phaedra admitted that the game was becoming &#34;very stressful.&#34; Dan was worried about getting the chalice out of the library, but Parvati said that she thought that she could do it, and it was right up her alley.




However, Parvati quickly realized that it wasn&#39;t going to be easy for the three traitors to meet, considering that their fellow contestants were in different rooms, watching each other, and on high alert. It was not only extremely difficult for the traitors to retrieve the chalice undetected, but it was nearly impossible for Parvati, who&#39;d volunteered for the job, to get someone to drink from the chalice. It&#39;ll be interesting to see who she finally murders.



 The Traitors Don’t Have The Upperhand 

 

For the first time in the game, the traitors don&#39;t have the upperhand when it comes to the faithfuls. Even though they&#39;ll be murdering someone, the fact that they could get caught or at least raise suspicions about themselves would put them at a major disadvantage. Although the contestants might not be expecting such a mind-blowing twist of murder in plain sight, any out-of-the-ordinary behavior from Dan, Parvati, or Phaedra could give their identities as traitors away. Dan was right when he said that the mission was &#34;so complicated.&#34;

 The Traitors Have To Make Split Second Decisions 
         

Because it was so difficult for the traitors to meet in plain sight, Phaedra left the mission up to Parvati and Dan. The duo discussed possibly murdering John Bercow, but Dan pointed out that maybe they should get rid of a woman since the first two murders were men, and it might raise suspicions about Dan being a traitor. They wondered if murdering Mercedes &#34;MJ&#34; Javid was too obvious after she called out Dan at the last round table and also voted for him to be banished.

Parvati and Dan also considered murdering Shereé Whitfield, but Parvati thought that Phaedra would never let them do it. However, Dan said that Phaedra wouldn&#39;t have to defend Shereé if they decided to murder her without Phaedra&#39;s knowledge. Parvati worried that Phaedra would be angry if they murdered Shereé, but Dan reassured her that they could come up with a good reason why they did, such as the fact that she&#39;s so quiet, and they don&#39;t know what her next move will be. They settled on murdering either John, Shereé, or MJ. Dan said that Parvati would have to do it, and it was &#34;Black Widow time,&#34; calling to mind the Survivor: Micronesia alliance, the Black Widow Brigade, which she founded.




After Dan found the Shakespeare books and pointed them out to Parvati, she took the chalice out, and began her mission. She said that she felt like a &#34;full-on trained assassin,&#34; and had &#34;zero adrenaline running&#34; through her body. Parvati thought about who was the best target to complete the mission in the most nonchalant way in which she wouldn&#39;t be implicated in it. She brought the chalice into a room where John and Shereé were hanging out with some other contestants. Parvati became the bartender and wondered how she would ever get someone to drink out of the chalice.

Parvati considered murdering Shereé, but quickly realized that it would be a bad idea. She expressed in her confessional that she knew what she could get away with, and what she couldn&#39;t. Parvati said that she wasn&#39;t going to stick her neck out and try to kill someone who was in the middle of an insulated group. She decided to abort the Shereé mission and left the room. Parvati then thought about targeting MJ in the kitchen, but wondered how she was going to get MJ to drink out of the &#34;rusty old cup.&#34; She knew that she wouldn&#39;t do it.




Parvati said that the pressure was on, and the murder had to happen now. There was no room for error. She wondered who she could hand the cup to who would actually drink out of it. She knew that it had to someone in that room, and it had to be done quickly because time was running out.

The Traitors episode ended just as Parvati announced in her confessional that she had finally found her target. She described herself as &#34;a full-on poisonous spider crawling up to get you when you least expect it.&#34; Having to make split second decisions could&#39;ve raised suspicions about Parvati&#39;s behavior. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if any of the faithfuls picked up on how she was acting throughout the night.

 The Traitors Could Turn On Each Other 

 




Phaedra said that the mission left her nerves on edge, and she left it up to Parvati and Dan because she didn&#39;t usually hang around with her fellow traitors. It would raise suspicion if they were suddenly spending a lot of time together. However, Phaedra hoped that the murder wouldn&#39;t come back to bite her. Phaedra became nervous when she noticed that Parvati had the chalice near Shereé. She said in her confessional, &#34;while it&#39;s a game, she will not be killed on my watch.&#34; Phaedra was relieved when Parvati left the room with the chalice without murdering Shereé.

This was a very intriguing moment because, although Parvati eventually gave up on killing Shereé, it would&#39;ve been interesting to see what Phaedra would&#39;ve done if Parvati had given Shereé the chalice. It&#39;s still possible that conflict could arise among the traitors if Parvati goes rogue and murders someone whom she didn&#39;t discuss with Dan or who&#39;s aligned with Phaedra. However, Parvati could also argue that since Dan and Phaedra left it up to her to commit the actual murder in plain sight, then she should be able to execute her plan however she needed to in order to complete it without getting caught. This could crumble their tight-knit camaraderie and make them vulnerable to being detected by the faithfuls.






 The Traitors Could Get Caught 

 

Although Parvati is being careful about the murder, there&#39;s a good possibility that suspicion could be raised about why she had the chalice in the first place. If people noticed that she carried it from one room to the other, that would definitely be a red flag. It&#39;s also possible that someone could&#39;ve been watching Dan and Parvati from afar, and saw them retrieve the chalice from the books.

Phaedra was the only traitor who wasn&#39;t engaged in the mission, so she probably won&#39;t be suspected of anything. However, if anyone was watching Dan or Parvati closely, they could be in trouble. Since Dan was already on Larsa Pippen and MJ&#39;s radar, there&#39;s a chance that they could&#39;ve been following him.

The Traitors season 2 has had some game-changing twists from casting only celebrities to introducing the possibility of winning shields during the missions. However, the murder in plain sight twist is the most thrilling of them all. It will be very exciting to see if the traitors can complete the mission without getting caught. It&#39;ll also be interesting to see if Parvati will murder someone whom she discussed with Dan, or if she&#39;ll have to change their plan and do something completely unexpected. No matter what happens, The Traitors season 2 is certain to be a wild ride of mystery, mayhem, and murder.




The Traitors season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
