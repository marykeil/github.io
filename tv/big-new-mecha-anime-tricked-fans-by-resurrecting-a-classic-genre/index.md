## Literature Review

Mecha fans should be surprised and delighted to find out that Bang Brave Bang Bravern&#39;s first episode twist is that it is a Super Robot series.




Cygames Pictures&#39; new mecha anime, Bang Brave Bang Bravern, fooled plenty of audiences with its last-minute reveal that it is a Super Robot show. This was thanks to its intentionally misleading trailers and pre-release materials, which presented the show as a standard war story. While the change is shocking, it ultimately is to Bravern&#39;s benefit, as it distinguishes itself with its bombastic resurrection of this mecha sub-genre.




Masaomi Obari, who is directing Bravern, is associated more with heroic, super-powered robots battling straightforward villains. That is why many mecha fans suspected there was more to Bravern than early materials suggested, which focused on the purely military &#34;Titanostriders&#34;.


 

But by revealing its true intent, fans are getting a greater treat by watching Obari return to his roots with a spiritual successor to the Brave series.

While early preview material emphasized the military aspects of Bravern, longtime mecha fans were quick to note the oddity of Obari working on a Real Robot series, especially with such a traditional title. As it turned out, the anime&#39;s premiere revealed that all the prior footage only accounted for the first third of the first episode. The twist comes when the titular Bravern arrives, and thwarts an alien invasion, showing that marketed Titanostriders will now be fighting alongside the heroic machine. Bravern it seems, will be a combination of genres, as military pilots use super-powered machinery to fight the extraterrestrials.

Anime fans familiar with Cygames also were quick to guess an impending twist, since the company has a history of tricking viewers with misleading promotional material. Infamously, Zombie Land Saga&#39;s trailers and first episode kept changing in tone, implying it was either an idol anime, or a zombie horror show, before revealing it was both, as a horror-comedy about undead entertainers. It might an old trick from Cygames, but it is also one that Bravern needs, as the shock of the genre twist helps the absurdity of the Super Robot genre land better than it would have been taken &#34;straight&#34;.






While Zombieland Saga&#39;s anime production was largely handled by Mappa, Cygames helped create the series and was responsible for its marketing.






 Bang Bravern Combines the Super Robot &amp; Real Robot Genres to Great Effect 
          

While many have been clamoring for more Super Robot shows ala GaoGaiGar, it is not always easy for viewers to accept its conventions. Bravern&#39;s solution is to be gleefully self-aware to the point that the talking robot with a face, giant sword, bright colors, shouted attacks and in-universe theme song are literally out of this world. It&#39;s an apt metaphor for an industry that seems to have shied away from Super Robots recently. But just like how its titular machine drops out of the sky, Obari&#39;s Bang Brave Bang Bravern has also crashed onto the scene with no prior warning.
