Summary

  The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Faith Martin seemingly won&#39;t be the lead of The Golden Bachelorette, as confirmed by her Facebook post.   Fans speculated if Faith was hinting at being the lead, but she said that she was just spreading the word about The Golden Bachelorette casting call.   Although Faith won&#39;t be the lead, there are other great choices from The Golden Bachelor, such as Leslie, who deserves another chance at love.  







The Golden Bachelor fan-favorite contestant Faith Martin has been considered a frontrunner to be the first-ever lead of The Golden Bachelorette, but she seemingly revealed that she won&#39;t be taking on the role. Faith, a 61-year-old local radio host and high school teacher from Benton City, Washington, captivated The Golden Bachelor lead Gerry Turner, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, on night one. He gave her his first impression rose, and their relationship grew until their beautiful hometown date. However, Gerry eliminated Faith before the Fantasy Suites, choosing Theresa Nist and Leslie Fhima as his final two women. Gerry and Theresa got engaged during the season finale.

In a Facebook post, Faith shared the casting call for The Golden Bachelorette. She wrote, &#34;Any mature single men ready for this?? It’s an amazing experience unlike any other!! Why not?! Ya just might find love!!&#34;


 




The comments section was flooded with messages from fans who asked if she was hinting that she was the lead. Faith answered, &#34;Nope no hint. Just spreading the word. It’s not me...that I know of anyway.&#34; She also wrote, &#34;No. Not sure who or if they’ve chosen someone. I’m just passing on the info.&#34; In another comment, Faith said, &#34;It’s not ME! I’m just spreading the word to single men! I have no idea who they’ll choose. But pretty sure not me.&#34;

 Who Might Be Cast As The Golden Bachelorette? 
          

If The Golden Bachelorette lead isn&#39;t Faith, there are many other Golden Bachelor contestants who&#39;d be perfect to star on the spin-off. The most obvious one is Leslie, who&#39;d follow in the tradition of many other Bachelor Nation runners-up by taking on the lead role of the next show. Fan-favorites Ellen Goltzer, Susan Noles, Kathy Swarts, Sandra Mason, and Joan Vassos would also be wonderful choices for The Golden Bachelorette. It&#39;s also possible that the producers might choose someone completely new.




It&#39;s disappointing to hear that Faith has seemingly confirmed she&#39;s not the lead of The Golden Bachelorette. Although nothing is official yet, her comments seem to indicate that she won&#39;t be the star of the spin-off. Faith was such an intriguing Golden Bachelor contestant, from her entrance on a motorcycle to her singing and playing the guitar for Gerry. She&#39;s certainly ready to find the next great love of her life and was one of the most sincere contestants on the show. Faith has even expressed that she&#39;d say yes to the role. Faith would&#39;ve been perfect as the Golden Bachelorette.

Although Faith might not be the Golden Bachelorette, there are still many other fantastic choices from The Golden Bachelor for the lead role. Leslie would probably be the best choice because she deserves another chance at love after being blindsided by Gerry. Despite her walls being up initially, Leslie was able to open up to him and allow herself to fall in love. No matter who ends up as the lead of the first-ever season of The Golden Bachelorette, the show is certain to be as groundbreaking and inspiring as The Golden Bachelor.
