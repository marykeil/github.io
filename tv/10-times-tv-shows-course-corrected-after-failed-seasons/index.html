  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>TV shows can recover from a bad season by making changes in casting, the creative team, and the network.
Some shows choose to ignore the failed season while others incorporate it into the series lore.
Seasons 1 and 2 of a show are crucial for establishing its tone and style, and a quality program can always turn things around.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>When a TV show has an unsuccessful season, it can be seen as a failure or be used as an opportunity for the series to reinvent itself the next year.</p>
<p>While the quality of television shows usually decreases season by season, some series can pull back from the brink of failure and return to form with a great season after a bad one. Alterations in casting, the creative team, and changes in the TV show&rsquo;s network can all contribute to the success and failure of a TV show by improving it or being the reason the show is reinvented. Using a year of bad ratings and low critical reception as an opportunity for growth isn&rsquo;t always easy but can positively spin a series low point.
Some shows may choose to proceed as if the failed season never happened and not use the plot points from it as canon. Others poke fun at the past missteps and make the failure part of the series lore. If the first season of a show is bad there&rsquo;s plenty of time for the creative team to redeem themselves and overhaul the tone and style of the show. These changes become more difficult as the seasons progress, but a quality program will always be able to turn on a dime and reel viewers back in.

<p>10 Community (2009 - 2015)
From season 4 into season 5</p>
<p>Community<br>
TV-PG</p>
<p>Release Date  September 17, 2009   Seasons  6   Writers  Dan Harmon   Network NBC   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , Netflix   Showrunner  Dan Harmon</p>
<p>Often dubbed the &ldquo;gas leak year,&rdquo; Community season 4 was the worst for many reasons, most notably the firing of showrunner and creator Dan Harmon. While Harmon did have his issues on set, the unique sitcom suffered enormously without his vision, and when he was brought back for seasons 5 and 6, it was a relief to the audience and creative team alike. Season 4 lacked the cohesion and character motivation of earlier seasons, so even with the major casting changes of season 5, it was still a better piece of television.
Both Chevy Chase and Donald Glover left in season 5, and Yvette Nicole Brown exited at the start of season 6. Though many major actors left Community following the tank in ratings and quality of season 4, the show was able to return to form and salvage its legacy in season 5. In some ways, season 4 was an opportunity for the series to prove that there was a niche to be fulfilled by the brand of topical humor and biting satire that were hallmarks of the writing.</p>
<p>9 Parks And Recreation (2009 - 2015)
From season 1 into season 2</p>
<p>Parks and Recreation</p>
<p>Release Date  April 9, 2009   Seasons  7   Writers  Michael Schur , Nick Offerman   Network NBC   Streaming Service(s)  fuboTV , Peacock   Showrunner  Michael Schur</p>
<p>For viewers who came to the show after its initial run, it&rsquo;s common practice to skip over season 1 of Parks and Recreation and start with season 2. Based on the tonal difference between season 1 and the remainder of the series, this is wise. Season 1 was scattered thematically and lacked the empathetic storytelling of later seasons. The reason season 2 was a success and propelled the series into a long run was because the comedy remained, but not at the expense of the protagonists. There were still plenty of comedic moments, but none that were too negative.</p>
<p>8 TV Shows Where The First Season Was The Worst Season<br>
When a TV series has a disappointing first season, it&rsquo;s up to the rest of the show to increase the quality and ensure every other season is amazing.</p>
<p>8 Fear The Walking Dead (2015 - 2023)
From season 2 into season 3</p>
<p>Fear the Walking Dead<br>
TV-MA</p>
<p>Release Date  August 23, 2015   Seasons  8   Writers  Ian Goldberg , Robert Kirkman , dave erickson , Andrew Chambliss   Network AMC   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , Amazon Prime Video   Showrunner  dave erickson , Ian Goldberg , Andrew Chambliss</p>
<p>Fear The Walking Dead was the first spin-off of the iconic post-apocalyptic show, The Walking Dead, and it took some time to live up to the original. The series deals with the beginning of the zombie apocalypse that is already in full swing by the time of the events of The Walking Dead. However, in season 2, the formula of the series is already growing stale. While season 2 tries to expand the world of the show by having the Clark family travel to Mexico, it doesn&rsquo;t make good on this promise until season 3.
It&rsquo;s then that the stakes are raised as the protagonists are introduced to new characters that are more dangerous than any they&rsquo;ve faced before. One of the biggest problems with season 2 is that the episode order was increased, so the creators had more time to fill out but not enough ideas for what to do with it. Conflict is presented and resolved too quickly, making the character choices inconsistent. In season 3, all this changes for a slow-burning conflict that&rsquo;s more compelling and fleshes out the themes of the show.</p>
<p>7 True Detective (2014 - )
From season 2 into season 3</p>
<p>True Detective</p>
<p>Release Date  January 12, 2014   Seasons  4   Writers  Nic Pizzolatto   Network  HBO Max   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , HBO Max   Showrunner  Nic Pizzolatto</p>
<p>True Detective season 2 is worse than seasons 1 and 3, marking a distinct sophomore slump that is saved by a return to the original formula of the show for season 3. It was difficult to recapture the magic that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson brought to the perfectly paced season 1, but season 2 incorporates too many twists and relies on tropes to propel the story. To recover from this, season 3 cast Mahershala Ali, an actor strong enough to pull the series out of obscurity while following the original beats of the show more closely.</p>
<p>6 Angel (1999 - 2004)
From season 4 into season 5</p>
<p>Angel</p>
<p>Release Date  October 5, 1999   Seasons  5   Writers Joss Whedon   Network The WB   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , Disney+   Showrunner  David Greenwalt</p>
<p>Though not quite as successful as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, its spin-off, still gained notoriety and grew a strong fanbase separately from the original series. Following the adventures of Angel (David Boreanaz) after he leaves Sunnydale and starts his own crime-fighting agency in Los Angeles, the show started strong but took a misstep with season 4. Disappointingly, the series mishandled Cordelia Chase&rsquo;s (Charisma Carpenter) character and included plot points that undid years of development.
Thankfully, for the final season, Spike (James Marsters) returned along with the perfect blend of monster-of-the-week plot points and serialized explorations of the season-long arc. Angel was always more concerned with the big picture than Buffy The Vampire Slayer and took a more nuanced approach to the fight between good and evil. This nuance is at its best in season 5 as Angel grapples with what it means to do good and creates the best season of the series.

<p>5 Lucifer (2016 - 2021)
From season 3 into season 4</p>
<p>Lucifer</p>
<p>Release Date  January 25, 2016   Seasons  6   Writers  tom kapinos   Streaming Service(s) Netflix   Showrunner  Joe Henderson</p>
<p>Part of what saved Lucifer from going down in history as just another crime procedural with a supernatural twist was the network jump from Fox to Netflix. Not only did this move save the show from cancelation, but it also provided the opportunity for the series to move away from the detective angle and eliminate filler episodes. Season 4 shines because it utilizes the premise of the show to its maximum ability. The series takes a hard look at the theme and pacing of the show, as well as what Lucifer&rsquo;s (Tom Ellis) motivations are as the devil on Earth.</p>
<p>8 TV Shows That Should Absolutely Not Have Been Crime Procedurals<br>
The crime procedural is a favorite among television genres, but not every show finds success by following the strict formula it requires.</p>
<p>4 Halt And Catch Fire (2014 - 2017)
From season 1 into season 2</p>
<p>Halt and Catch Fire is still an underrated hallmark of the workplace drama genre, especially considering the dramatic increase in quality between seasons 1 and 2. While season 1 isn’t a complete failure, it doesn’t distinguish itself against the many other dramas and tech series of the time. However, season 2 ditches the workplace focus of season 1, centering the creative process of the two female leads, Cameron (Mackenzie Davis) and Donna (Kerry Bishé). From there, the show continues down the more interesting path of technological evolution and what that means for emerging genius within the field.</p>
<p>3 Supernatural (2005 - 2020)
From season 7 into season 8</p>
<p>Supernatural</p>
<p>Release Date  September 13, 2005   Seasons  15   Writers  Eric Kripke , Andrew Dabb , Robert Berens   Network The WB , The CW   Showrunner  Eric Kripke</p>
<p>Due to the 15-season run, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that Supernatural hit a slump so bad following season 5 that it almost ended the show. Both seasons 6 and 7 were aimless in their storytelling since the season 5 finale functioned almost as a series finale. The villains in season 6, and prominently in 7, were disjointed, and their motivations were unclear, which was a sharp departure from the clear antagonists of the previous seasons. Crowley (Mark Sheppard) takes over as the villain of season 8 and proves himself a worthy adversary for Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles).</p>
<p>2 It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia (2005 - )
From season 1 into season 2</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</p>
<p>Release Date  August 4, 2005   Seasons  16   Writers  Rob McElhenney , Glenn Howerton , Charlie Day , David Hornsby   Network FX   Streaming Service(s) Hulu   Showrunner  Rob McElhenney</p>
<p>Danny DeVito&rsquo;s casting saved It&rsquo;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia season 2 by adding an essential element to the dynamic of the gang. Season 1 is a low-budget experiment, but the bones of what the series could become are present. The show was lucky enough to get DeVito to sign on as Frank, and it&rsquo;s difficult to imagine the show without Frank today. His perspective brought something unique to the show that it was missing. Each character is funny on their own but at their best when the entire group, including Frank, is playing off each other.</p>
<p>1 The O.C. (2003 - 2007)
From season 3 into season 4</p>
<p>The O.C.</p>
<p>Release Date  August 5, 2003   Seasons  4   Writers  Josh Schwartz   Network  FOX   Streaming Service(s) Hulu , HBO Max   Showrunner  Josh Schwartz</p>
<p>The decision to kill off Marissa (Mischa Barton) in season 3 was a divisive choice for the teen drama The O.C., but it proved to be a wise one after all that happened that season. Marissa&rsquo;s character was on a downward spiral, as were the other characters on the show. They were all brought to their lowest points throughout the season. While this can be an effective tool for character development, it ended up altering the show so much that drastic measures had to be taken to save the show in the final season.
Season 4 sees Seth (Adam Brody), Summer (Rachel Bilson), and Ryan (Ben McKenzie) grappling with the death of their friend in a surprisingly honest and touching way. Though there&rsquo;s still plenty of drama to round out the season, it sticks the landing for a teen soap by letting the characters achieve their dreams without getting overly emotional. The series finale is a standout of season 4, with flash-forwards that bring each character&rsquo;s arc full circle.</p>
