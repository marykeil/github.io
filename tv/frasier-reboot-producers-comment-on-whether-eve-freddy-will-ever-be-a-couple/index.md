# Frasier Reboot Producers Comment On Whether Eve &amp; Freddy Will Ever Be A Couple


## SUMMARY 



  The executive producers of the Fraiser reboot are considering the possibility of Eve and Freddy getting together, but want to make sure it feels right for the characters and don&#39;t want to emulate the love story between Daphne and Niles.   They want to slowly unpack the potential romance between Eve and Freddy and mimic real life, rather than rushing into it.   Due to the recent death of Eve&#39;s partner, there is nothing imminent that could possibly happen between Eve and Freddy, and it may take a couple of seasons before their relationship develops further.

## Literature Review
EPs Chris Harris and Joe Cristalli address the possibility of Freddy and Eve in the Frasier reboot becoming a couple like Niles and Daphne. 




The Fraiser reboot executive producers Chris Harris and Joe Cristalli discuss the possibility of Eve and Freddy getting together. Paramount&#43;&#39;s revival established the relationship between the pair early on as friends who bond over their shared grief of losing their loved one. They have remained friendly throughout its run, but there are also some hints of them possibly becoming romantically involved.




Weeks removed from the Frasier reboot season 1 finale, the EPs talk to TV Insider about the chances of Eve and Freddy getting together. Although not committed to the idea, they acknowledge that there are some comparisons to the love story between Daphne and Niles — something that they don&#39;t want to emulate, knowing full well that it&#39;s a tall task to even match. Read their quotes below:


Harris: “It’s definitely always been a thought of ours, but we want to make sure that we do what feels right for the characters. We decided there was no way we were going to match that idea of this one person chasing this other person. So let’s slow play it. Let’s not put it front and center. Let’s sort of mimic life in a way and see what feels natural as we slowly unpack it. But it’s definitely something that we’re thinking about.”
Cristalli: “In just the realm of common decency, his best friend [with whom Eve had a baby] died pretty recently, so it feels like you can’t really do anything for a couple seasons. You can maybe give some hints, and maybe if it’s there, it’ll blossom. But yeah, I don’t think there’s anything imminent that could possibly happen for them.”






 Should Freddy &amp; Eve Get Together In The Frasier Reboot? 
          

The Frasier reboot initially hid the real status of the pair&#39;s relationship, suggesting that they are together because they were living under one roof, even though that isn&#39;t the case. Truthfully, Freddy wanted to make up for the demise of his dear friend, so he took on the responsibility of looking after his girlfriend and son. Later on when pressed by David about his feelings for Eve and their natural chemistry, Freddy gives off a panicked response, further leaning towards the idea that he has feelings for her. Both Cristalli and Harris&#39; decision to play their supposed love story slowly doesn&#39;t seem to be rooted in the fact that their dynamic is quite complicated but over fears of being compared to Niles and Daphne.

Admittedly, their dynamic is very different from Niles&#39; long-term one-sided love for Daphne. That being said, Freddy and Eve may be the Frasier reboot&#39;s modern take on the will-they/won&#39;t-they trope that was so central to the original series and Cheers&#39; respective narratives. Considering their complicated circumstances, both may understandably not be keen on admitting their attraction to each other. However, navigating a love line involving the pair will be much trickier given their predicament. It can easily be misconstrued, especially since it hasn&#39;t been long since Eve&#39;s partner died.

Only time will tell if there&#39;s a chance for Freddy and Eve to be in a relationship. However, more than their dynamic, the Paramount&#43; revival needs to prioritize Frasier&#39;s story — something that was overshadowed by Niles and Daphne&#39;s romance in the original series. That&#39;s the reason behind the need for the Frasier reboot, Kelsey Grammer&#39;s character has yet to get the definitive ending he deserves.
