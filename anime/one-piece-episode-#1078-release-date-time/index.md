## Literature Review

After a long bout of intense fighting, One Piece episode #1078 promises to give the Straw Hats some much-needed relaxation time as Wano recovers.





 What Time One Piece #1078 Releases 
          




One Piece episode #1078, titled &#34;He Returns! The Shogun of the Land of Wano, Kozuki Momonosuke&#34; will air on Sunday, October 1 at 9:30 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST). It will then be simulcast on Crunchyroll on September 30 at 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 9:00 p.m. Central Time (CT), and 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (EST) in the U.S. It will release on Sunday, October 1 at 3:00 a.m. British Summer Time (BST) for One Piece fans in the UK. Those looking for the English dub will have to wait for that version to premiere on Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Episode #1077 of One Piece? 
          

Episode #1077 largely dealt with the aftermath of Luffy and Kaido&#39;s fight. Luffy collapsed with exhaustion on the roof of Onigashima as Kaido hurtled down into the earth, eventually coming to rest in the same lava pool that Big Mom fell into after her fight with Kid and Law. This caused a massive volcanic eruption on the surface that frightened the people of Wano and caused Momo and his samurai retainers to intervene and calm the people down. Momo had previously decided in that episode that he was going to reopen Wano&#39;s borders once he became Shogun, so the next episode will likely focus more on his incipient reign.






 One Piece Episode #1078 Will Put Wano on the Right Path 
          

With Momo finally revealing himself to the people of Wano and likely taking over as Shogun, episode #1078 will focus on establishing the new status quo in the land of the samurai. Wano has been under the oppressive rule of Orochi and Kaido for years, and it will likely take some time for Momo and his retainers to restore the country to its former glory. However, in the short term, the people of Wano will likely celebrate their new change in regime and embrace those who helped depose the old rulers. This means the Straw Hats will have some well-deserved relaxation time in the coming episodes.

After the incredibly hyped fights in the Raid on Onigashima, the calmer episodes that are likely soon to come may seem boring in comparison. However, if previous arcs are any indication, One Piece&#39;s less action-packed episodes can still be incredibly exciting, with great character moments and lore reveals. This makes One Piece episode #1078 and the ones following it very exciting for fans even if they may not seem that way initially.




Catch One Piece episode #1078 when it releases on Crunchyroll on September 30, 2023.
