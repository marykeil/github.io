## Literature Review

Netflix has some of the best fantasy anime in its streaming library, including Hunter X Hunter, One Piece, and Demon Slayer.




Some of the best fantasy anime of all time are available to stream on Netflix. In these classics and new favorites, viewers have no shortage of fascinating worlds to explore alongside the characters. Magical creatures, ethereal technology, and powers and abilities beyond the heroes’ wildest dreams abound in every episode.
From vampires to spirits to beings that defy classification, these shows are the height of their creators’ imaginations. Fantasy is an extremely versatile genre by definition. Animation is particularly well-suited to it: free from the constraints of live-action, the only limits to the depictions of fantastical stories are the hands of the artists.









 








 10  Demon Slayer 


 







  Year Released   2019    Number of Episodes   55    
Tanjiro Kamado is introduced to the world of demons and the warriors who hunt them in the most horrific way possible. When his family is killed by a demon and his sister Nezuko transformed into one, he takes up the sword to protect people and restore Nezuko’s humanity. As he grows stronger, Tanjiro discovers that he and Nezuko may have been destined to end this war for good.
Demon Slayer is one of the more popular shonen anime currently airing (the manga was completed in May 2020). While the darkest moments of the anime are nightmarish and shocking, the show overall has a powerfully optimistic tone. Tanjiro, Nezuko, and their fellow Demon Slayers push themselves to their limits in mastering the Breathing Styles that allow them to match and defeat increasingly powerful demons.





 9  Hunter X Hunter 


 







  Year Released   2011    Number of Episodes   148    
Like many a shonen protagonist, Gon is determined to follow in the footsteps of his absent but legendary father Ging. However, it’s not Ging himself that Gon’s truly interested in: rather, it’s what’s so great about being a Hunter that Ging would rather do that than raise his son. As he explores the wide world beyond Whale Island, he finds a whole lot more than that on his quest to his father.
The culture of Hunters — daring explorers all searching for something — is rich and exciting, and it’s not even the most interesting part of the show. From the Nen abilities cultivated by powerful fighters to horrifying insect species to each distinct country and city, Gon and company find something new around every corner. If and when the manga’s Dark Continent Arc ever gets an anime adaptation, the show will be able to depict the most mysterious parts of Hunter X Hunter’s world in all their weird glory.





 8  JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure 
        

  Year Released   2012    Number of Episodes   190    
How does one even begin to explain JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure? The show begins dramatically but relatively normally in Phantom Blood, and with every successive part, it only grows flashier and more over-the-top. In their journeys, each new hero in the Joestar bloodline wields rare and unique powers, helping them defeat the latest threats to their world and loved ones.
JoJo&#39;s strangest moments surprise everyone, from the characters to the audience. Everything about JoJo, from character designs to powers to story arcs, comes from the many different inspirations to mangaka Hirohiko Araki. Araki has also always felt incredibly free to change up the manga depending on his current tastes, creating a wildly varied experience.





 7  BNA: Brand New Animal 


  Year Released   2020    Number of Episodes   12    
In this futuristic world, it’s tough to be a beastman. Michiru Kagemori is learning that the hard way after she’s suddenly and inexplicably transformed into an anthropomorphic tanuki! To unravel the mystery of her change and the conspiracies running beneath their world, she must move to Anima City and team up with the famous wolf detective, Shirou Ogami.
BNA is one of the most recent projects from Studio Trigger, famous for its unique and exciting animation. That reputation continues into this show, bringing Anima City vibrantly to life. It mixes urban fantasy and crime thriller to great effect, taking its time to develop the world Michiru and Shirou live in.





 6  Yasuke 
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   6    
Japan&#39;s Sengoku period was an era of chaos and war in the wake of the feudal system’s collapse. Among the warriors struggling in the power vacuum was an African man dubbed Yasuke, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Though historical records about Yasuke’s life and exploits in Japan are scarce, the films, manga, and now anime made about him seek to fill in the gaps.
The true story of Japan’s first foreign samurai gets its first animated depiction in this Netflix original from MAPPA. Featuring the voice talent of LaKeith Stanfield as Yasuke in the show’s English dub, Yasuke mixes historical fantasy with magic and steampunk technology to tell the most exciting story possible. As he tries to move on from the fall of Nobunaga to demons, Yasuke must use his skills to protect a mother and daughter.





 5  Beastars 
        

  Year Released   2019    Number of Episodes   24    
Legosi might be a six-foot-two wolf with a long, fanged muzzle, but he would never bite anyone. At least, that’s what he’s sworn to do after an incident from his past that still horrifies him. But when his alpaca classmate is found murdered and he’s the prime suspect, he will have to do a lot of things he thought he’d never do to uncover the real killer.
Similar to its spiritual successor BNA, Beastars heavily explores themes of classism and prejudice with its world of carnivores and herbivores at odds. At Cherryton Academy, nothing and nobody are what they seem, and the fantasy elements serve the mystery elements very well. Legosi and the other members of the drama club must learn to trust each other if they’re going to survive.





 4  Shaman King 
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   52    
The Shaman Fight is a worldwide competition held once every five hundred years between the world’s spirit mediums, to decide who will bond with the Great Spirit. Yoh Asakura and his spirit partner Amidamaru jump at the chance to get into the running to become Shaman King and change the world. But they’ll have to struggle through fearsome battles and one of the best sibling rivalries in anime to get there.
In initially creating Shaman King, mangaka Hiroyuki Takei wanted to base a story on something no other manga explored before, like shamanism. Yoh and his fellow shamans all have different bonds with their guardian spirits, and it takes time and training to unlock 100% of their powers. At the moment, only the 2021 reboot of Shaman King is available on Netflix; the original 2001 show is available on Tubi and Pluto TV.





 3  One Piece 


 







  Year Released   1999    Number of Episodes   1080&#43;    
When the greatest pirate in history, Gol D. Roger, is executed for his crimes, he promises his treasure to the pirate who can find it. Twenty-four years later, aspiring pirate Monkey D. Luffy is hunting down the One Piece, putting together a loyal crew along the way. The odds are against them, but Luffy is determined to take his place as King of the Pirates.
Most anime fans know the story by now: One Piece is one of the longest-running anime of all time. In addition to its longevity, it’s famous for its distinctive character designs and expansive world-building. It just goes to show how popular it remains even after twenty-six years of publication that the 2023 live-action remake, also streaming on Netflix, was an instant hit.





 2  Castlevania 
        

  Year Released   2017    Number of Episodes   32    
Centuries after their original confrontation with Count Dracula, the Belmont family — now down to only one member, Trevor — has fallen on hard times. However, Trevor gets the chance to take up the mantle of vampire slayer himself once Dracula returns to threaten humanity. Together with sorceress Sypha Belnades and Dracula’s son Alucard Tepes, Trevor enters the greatest fight of his life.
While Castlevania is an American production, it is shelved alongside the most popular shows in Netflix’s anime section. It takes inspiration not just from the original video games, but from classic anime such as Vampire Hunter D, Akira, and Ninja Scroll. Its Japanese dub features well-known voice actors such as Ryotaro Okiayu, Naoya Uchida, and Takehiro Sakurai.





 1  Dorohedoro 
        

  Year Released   2020    Number of Episodes   12 &#43; 6 Shorts    
In the horrific dystopia known as the Hole, Kaiman was having a terrible enough time already. And that was before he was kidnapped by a Magic User, experimented on, and turned into an amnesiac lizard creature. Now, Kaiman must team up with his friend Nikaido to fight back against the Magic Users and reclaim what he’s lost. Like many selections in Netflix’s library, Dorohedoro is a highly underrated anime. Its fans are drawn to it for its startling and entertaining blend of horror and cheerfulness, with its comedy hard on the dark side as well. The genuine goodness of the characters fighting through their nightmarish world endears many audiences to the show.
