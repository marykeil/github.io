Summary

  Chapter #244 of Jujutsu Kaisen teases that Sukuna will again, thanks to a mistake made by Gojo that prevents Higuruma from executing his cursed technique on Sukuna.   Gojo&#39;s decision to have the battle on a national holiday unknowingly prevents Higuruma from enacting the death penalty, closing off another path to victory against Sukuna.   Even if the death penalty is out, Higuruma&#39;s plan to confiscate Sukuna&#39;s Cursed Technique is uncertain, as it depends on Judgeman successfully convicting Sukuna.  







Jujutsu Kaisen has just teased that Sukuna will win yet again, and it&#39;s all thanks to Gojo. The latest chapter shifts back to the exciting battle against Sukuna, where Yuji and Higuruma have entered the battlefield with a plan to defeat Sukuna once and for all. However, this plan may be destined to fail all thanks to one mistake by Gojo.

Chapter #244 of Jujutsu Kaisen reveals that Yuji and Higuruma plan to use Higuruma&#39;s Cursed Technique to either confiscate Sukuna&#39;s Cursed Technique or kill him with one blow using his Executioner&#39;s Sword. However, Higuruma will not be able to execute the death penalty on Sukuna simply because of the date Gojo chose to have the battle.


 

As X user @kylescouter points out, the battle against Sukuna in chapter #244 takes place on December 24, 2018, which is a national holiday, hence preventing Higuruma from enacting the death penalty according to the law. Though simply a rash decision on Gojo&#39;s part, it seems that this oversight will close off yet another path to victory against Sukuna.





 Gojo Chose The Wrong Day To Fight Sukuna 
          

Gojo chose the date for the battle after he was unsealed in chapter #221 of Jujutsu Kaisen, the reason for his choice being he did not want Geto to have two death anniversaries and wanted to put his body to rest by defeating Kenjaku the same day that Geto died. Seeing as Gojo made his decision immediately after escaping the prison realm, Gojo would have had no knowledge of the impact his seemingly inconsequential decision would have or of Higuruma&#39;s existence for that matter.

Gojo is notably missing in chapter #244 as the sorcerers plot out their plan of action in case of Gojo&#39;s defeat. As a result, Gojo likely did not know of this contingency plan involving Higuruma&#39;s technique, either. That said, it is unclear whether this minor detail regarding the date of the battle has evaded Higuruma as well.




                  Sukuna&#39;s Real Form In Jujutsu Kaisen Is The Final Insult To Gojo   Sukuna has finally been reincarnated in Jujutsu Kaisen, and his true form proves the fight against Gojo may have been decided from the start.   



 Higuruma&#39;s Victory Against Sukuna Is Uncertain 
          

Even if the death penalty is out, Higuruma&#39;s Cursed Technique may still be able to confiscate Sukuna&#39;s Cursed Technique. However, as chapter #244 points out, this is dependent on Judgeman, Higuruma&#39;s shikigami, successfully convicting Sukuna of a crime grave enough. Even if he manages to do so, it is unclear how the ruling will affect Sukuna as he currently possesses two Cursed Techniques including Megumi&#39;s Ten Shadows. Even if one of the two is taken away, victory against Sukuna, who is at full strength at the moment, is uncertain.




In retrospective, the fact that Gojo chose the day of the battle due to his ties to Geto seems to be foreshadowing this unfortunate development, which would surely be a master storytelling stroke from Gege Akutami. Either way, the fate of the sorcerers appears to be very grim, with Gojo&#39;s blunder having taken away their only other shot for a sure-fire victory. That said, there may still be a silver lining, as the hopelessness of the situation could finally allow Yuji the opportunity to break out of his shell and re-establish himself as the protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen through his fated battle against Sukuna.
