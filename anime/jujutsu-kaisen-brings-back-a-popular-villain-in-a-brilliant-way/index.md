## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen has brought back one of its best villains in a way that surprisingly doesn&#39;t diminish their original death in the Gojo&#39;s Past arc.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Season 2 episode #11 of Jujutsu Kaisen!




In its latest episode Jujutsu Kaisen just brought back one of its most popular villains in a brilliant way. While in another series bringing back a dead villain may feel like a cheap way to minimize that character&#39;s death, here it feels like an exciting return for someone gone too soon. A large part of that comes down to the way in which this character has returned.

In Jujutsu Kaisen episode #11, an evil sorcerer aligned with Kenjaku performs a ritual to imbue her partner with the powers and appearance of a dead person. The person they pick is Toji Zenin, Megumi&#39;s father who managed to defeat a teenage Gojo in the previous arc. After gaining Toji&#39;s powers, his new host quickly pummels Ino, the sorcerer he was fighting, with a quick series of brutal punches. It is unclear how much of Toji&#39;s personality was revived, so this may not be exactly the same villain fans loved to hate in the brutal Gojo&#39;s Past arc, but it is still the closest that they will likely ever get.

Still seeing any form of Toji even if it isn&#39;t quite the real thing is exciting enough for many fans. In the Gojo&#39;s Past arc, Toji proved himself to be a ruthless killer but also an incredibly tactical and powerful one. While he may not be able to use cursed energy due to his Heavenly restriction, his physical prowess more than makes up for this flaw and even enables him to defeat a young Gojo in their first fight. With Gojo now sealed it is unclear whether any of the remaining sorcerers will be able to defeat this reincarnated version of Toji, adding another major threat to the Shibuya Incident.

Regardless of how much of Toji&#39;s original personality his new form contains, he is very unlikely to side with Yuji and Megumi in the battle against the curses. He has already defeated Ino, and he will likely fight against many other sorcerers until he can be taken down. There is a lot of dramatic potential here as there are multiple sources Toji had a personal connection to in his past life. One of the high-ranking members of the Zenin clan Naobito is in Shibuya and given his animosity towards his family that could lead to an intense fight. In addition, Maki is following in Toji&#39;s footsteps making a fight with her a good test of how she compares. Most important is his son Megumi who could have an intense father-son battle with Toji.






 Toji&#39;s Return Makes Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Future More Exciting 
          

Toji&#39;s return opens up so many possibilities for where the Shibuya Incident arc can go from here. By bringing him back in this way, the series also doesn&#39;t make his death meaningless as he is still dead, even if someone has effectively brought him back for a short while. If Jujutsu Kaisen takes full advantage of Toji&#39;s narrative potential then it could cement the Shibuya Incident as one of the best Shonen arcs of all time.

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #11 is available to stream on Crunchyroll.
