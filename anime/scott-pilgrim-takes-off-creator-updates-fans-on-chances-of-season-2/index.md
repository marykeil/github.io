## Literature Review

The creator of the Scott Pilgrim comics expressed in an interview his thoughts about season 1 of the anime and an eventual follow-up.




The Scott Pilgrim Takes Off anime was another great addition to the franchise, and the first season left fans hungry for another. The franchise&#39;s creator, Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley, expressed his thoughts in a recent interview, sharing what he thinks about an eventual follow-up.




In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley and BenDavid Grabinski (the executive producer of the show) went into depth about the direction they took in the anime and how it differed from the movie and comics. At the end of the interview, they were asked about the possibility of season 2.

          

O&#39;Malley said that there were no plans or ideas for season 2 of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off and that they poured everything into the first season. He explained that, as in today&#39;s landscape shows often get canceled after a season, leading to fans&#39; disappointment, they preferred to make season 1 self-contained. O&#39;Malley said that &#34;it would take about 50 different miracles simultaneously for another season to happen&#34;, while Grabinski added that they are not working on it, and have no official ideas for a season 2.

 The Creators Are Satisfied With The Show&#39;s Ending 
Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is a self-contained story, and the authors poured every idea they had into it.
          

One of the main reasons that Grabinski and O&#39;Malley don&#39;t see the series receiving a second season is that they are happy with how the anime ended and, although they don&#39;t dismiss the possibility of a sequel, it is very unlikely, as they don&#39;t have any ideas at the moment. All the ideas they had were put into the first season, and it seemed like there was never a plan for another season.



We’re not working on it. We have no official ideas. We put everything we had into this, and we think it has a really great ending that we’re proud of.


-Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley




They were also driven by the possibility of the series being canceled after the first season. This fate has befallen many popular shows like Daredevil and is a major point of contention for fans of Netflix&#39;s series. Taking this possibility into mind, the production team made sure that there were no loose ends and provided a conclusive ending that would not only make them happy but also the fans. This paid off, as Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&#39;s ending received a lot of praise for making the show a stand-alone series.






 Season 2 Could Still Happen 
          



Maybe some day one of us will text each other an idea that’s really great for a Season Two.


- BenDavid Grabinski




However, despite O&#39;Malley and Grabinski&#39;s honest words, the possibility of a second season of the show should not be completely dismissed. The two have explicitly stated that there is a chance that a sequel could happen provided they get a great idea that makes an installment worth it. Given how great storytellers they are, there&#39;s a lot to be hopeful about, but for now, fans should assume that there will be no Scott Pilgrim Takes Off season 2.
