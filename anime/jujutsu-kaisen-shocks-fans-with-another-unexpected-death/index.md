## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s latest battle has taken an unexpected turn with yet another shocking death in the final pages of its latest chapter.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #243 of Jujutsu Kaisen. Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most comical battle has at last come to a standstill with yet another unexpected death that has left fans shocked. Takaba&#39;s battle against Kenjaku has subverted shonen expectations throughout and the latest chapter reveals yet another twist as the jolly battle takes a complete turn in the final three pages with the appearance of Yuta Okkotsu.




Chapter #243 of Jujutsu Kaisen reveals Yuta has successfully managed to cut off Kenjaku&#39;s head thanks to Takaba&#39;s diversion. Yuta sneaks up on Kenjaku just as Takaba and Kenjaku&#39;s comedy skit comes to an end and manages to slice Kenjaku before the latter can use Reverse Cursed Technique.

          

While the ploy to divert Kenjaku&#39;s attention and prevent him from sensing Yuta&#39;s presence until the very last moment worked wonderfully, Kenjaku may not be dead just yet. Though he has been decapitated, the chapter ends on an ambiguous, ominous note suggesting Kenjaku may have a contingency plan.  : Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Fans Can Say Farewell To Another Popular Hero


 Kenjaku May Not Be Completely Dead Just Yet 
          




Although Yuta has managed to outsmart Kenjaku using Takaba for now, Kenjaku is a thorough, cunning man and likely already has a plan in place in case of such a situation. Chapter #243 ends with Kenjaku on the brink of death as he mentions passing on his will, which does not bode well for Yuta and sorcerers attempting to foil his plans. The easiest, most obvious way out of the situation would be for Kenjaku to switch bodies, though how doing so might affect his plans involving Tengen is unclear, as Geto&#39;s Cursed Technique seems to be a crucial part of Kenjaku&#39;s plan.

Conversely, the pieces of Kenjaku&#39;s plan seem to already be in place, so perhaps Kenjaku&#39;s contingency plan may take a wholly unexpected route. Seeing as Kenjaku&#39;s brain is still intact, he likely still has many options, including releasing all the Cursed Spirits in his body, allowing him to go out in a blaze of glory if he must, or create a enough of a distraction.

 Takaba&#39;s Fate Remains Undecided 
          

Chapter #243 also leaves Takaba&#39;s fate ambiguous as he can be seen lying on the ground peacefully with a smile on his face at the end of his skit with Kenjaku and Yuta swoops in for the kill. It is unclear whether Takaba is dead or simply doing a bit but the smile on his face suggests the latter.

While many fans hoped Takaba would steal the show and defeat Kenjaku, him surviving the affair unscathed might be solace enough considering Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s history of heartlessly killing off characters. Takaba has come to occupy a dear place in the hearts of many fans throughout the course of the battle against Kenjaku and fans can only hope he isn&#39;t truly dead.

Nonetheless, the battle against Kenjaku has been a refreshing change of pace, bringing back much of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s missing lightheartedness and humor. That said, regardless of the route the battle against Kenjaku ultimately takes, the upcoming chapters of Jujutsu Kaisen are sure to hold plenty of excitement as the battle against Sukuna is far from over.
