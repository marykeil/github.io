## Literature Review

As the most common type in the Pokémon franchise, Water-types have a wide variety of designs and inspirations. Here are the cutest creatures of all.





Water-types are incredibly versatile. They can be savage like Gyarados or majestic like Milotic. Some are angry-looking, like Poliwrath, or mischievous and friendly like Politoed. Then there are those that are cute and sweet, making use of their aquatic elements to charm trainers. Below are some of the cutest Water-type Pokémon out there, even if that cuteness might be a little unconventional.









 








 15  Dewpider 
        

Dewpider might not be what one first thinks of when they think of Water-type Pokémon, but it&#39;s a Water-type nonetheless. Dewpider, originally found in the Alola region, is a small spider-like Pokémon which carries a bubble of water on its head, which allows it to breathe on land. Dewpider featured heavily in the episode &#34;Dewpider Ascending!&#34;, where one was befriended by Ash&#39;s buddy Lana, a Water-type Trainer. The Dewpider was looking for a new home, and was struggling in territorial disputes. While Lana never caught Dewpider, they still had a close bond.





 14  Spheal 
        

Spheal is a Pokémon native to the Hoenn region, where it made its debut. Spheal are both Ice and Water-type, and thus are best equipped to live in colder waters. Spheal can evolve twice, into Sealeo and finally Walrein, a Pokémon that&#39;s distinctly not cute. Spheal&#39;s spherical, ball-like shape allows it to roll around on land, able to stop at any time with its fin. While no major characters in the anime ever owned a Spheal, Spheal has been the focus of many one-off episodes, including its debut episode, &#34;The Spheal of Approval,&#34; where one was used against Ash when he was mistaken for a thief.





 13  Mantyke 
        

A baby Pokémon from the fourth generation, Mantyke are able to evolve into Mantine under the right conditions. Mantyke are said to have slightly different designs on their backs depending on what area they&#39;re found in, although this hasn&#39;t always been portrayed accurately. Mantyke are known for jumping out of the water and gliding short distances, which earned it the epithet &#34;the Kite Pokémon.&#34; In Pokémon Journeys, Ash&#39;s companion Goh caught a Mantyke, which he used in a race known as the Iceberg Race at Snowpoint City.





 12  Manaphy 
        

Manaphy is a Mythical Pokémon introduced in the fourth generation, and was for a long time one of the hardest Pokémon to acquire in the games. Manaphy are said to come from a distant, warm-water region, and float freely throughout the oceans, riding the currents. A Manaphy played a major role in the ninth Pokémon movie, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, where it hatched from an egg and was the target of an evil gang of Pokémon thieves. Manaphy was ultimately critical to locating the eponymous Temple of the Sea, and Ash and his friends had to protect it.





 11  Mareanie 
        

Mareanie is the absolute definition of &#34;Ugly Cute.&#34; A trainer might want to pet it, but at the same time would fear for their safety. Indeed, Mareanie&#39;s spikes are highly poisonous, and its tentacles can entrap its prey before dealing the final blow. Skilled and sneaky, it can regenerate any part of its body overnight, except its head. A Mareanie was owned by Team Rocket&#39;s James in the anime, and it loved to grab onto his head in a loving (yet poisonous) embrace. Mareanie was ultimately left in Alola, where it could live happily in its natural environment.





 10  Oshawott 
        

Oshawott is the Fifth Generation&#39;s water-type Starter Pokémon. Known as the Sea Otter Pokémon, Oshawott carries a small shell, known as a scalchop, on its belly. It can remove this shell and use it as a weapon to perform the powerful Razor Shell attack, and Oshawott become extremely distressed if they lose the shell. In the anime, Ash owned an Oshawott, which he often kept outside its Poké Ball like Pikachu. Ash&#39;s Oshawott was a bit of a troublemaker, and also very prone to developing crushes on female Pokémon it encountered.





 9  Corsola 
        

Corsola is an adorable Water-type Pokémon that was first introduced in the Johto region. Found in warm and shallow waters, Corsola lives in large groups. Sometimes they get so large that entire settlements can live atop them, like Hoenn&#39;s Pacifidlog Town. Corsola is hunted because of its prized horn used for jewelry and carving. A dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon, it has a regional variant in Galar that is pure Ghost-type. In the anime, Misty owned a Corsola, which she caught in a special Lure Ball. Misty&#39;s Corsola was energetic, and even a bit rowdy at times, but ultimately was a very happy and loving Pokémon.





 8  Vaporeon 
        

One of the original three Eeveelutions, Vaporeon is the result of exposing Eevee to a Water Stone. Because of its unique evolution method, Vaporeon is hardly ever found in the wild. It is most common in urban settings under the ownership of a trainer. Vaporeon has the unique ability to turn its body into water molecules and dissolve into water. This ability allows it to camouflage while swimming underwater, making it a dangerous predator. A carnivore, it feeds on smaller fish Pokémon. While no main characters in the anime have ever owned a Vaporeon, it has made many appearances in the series, often alongside its fellow Eeveelutions.





 7  Sobble 
        

Introduced in the eighth generation, Sobble is Galar&#39;s Water starter Pokémon. Based on a chameleon, Sobble has the ability to camouflage in water, where it often hides. Extremely timid, Sobble can easily become anxious and will start sweating to disappear into its surroundings. It&#39;s also a known crier and its tears are highly contagious, apparently having the power of 100 onions. In the anime, a Sobble appeared, which was caught by Ash&#39;s companion, Goh. It became one of his main Pokémon, and he even evolved it all the way up to its (somewhat controversial) final form, Inteleon.





 6  Frillish 
        

A dual-type Water/Ghost Pokémon introduced in Generation V, Frillish is a different color depending on its gender. It lives in dens about five miles under the sea surface, where it faces dark and pressurized conditions. Despite its cute appearance, Frilish is quite cruel. A carnivore, it wraps its prey with its arms and numbs it with poisonous stingers. A legend in Unova states that all Frilish are actually transformed citizens from an ancient sunken city. In the Black and White anime series, Team Rocket&#39;s Jessie owned a Frillish, which was very mischievous. Frillish eventually reunited with Jessie in one of the anime&#39;s final episodes, once again becoming a valued part of the team.





 5  Squirtle 
        

The original Water starter, Squirtle remains one of the most popular and memorable first generation Pokémon. Though usually bipedal, Squirtle can also run on all fours for increased speed. It retreats into its shell for protection or to sleep. Squirtle memorably appeared several times in the anime, notably as Gary Oak&#39;s starter, as well as the &#34;Squirtle Squad&#34; leader, which eventually became Ash&#39;s Pokémon. Ash&#39;s Squirtle made a return in the last few episodes of the anime, where it was shown to still work as a firefighter in the Squirtle Squad, while simultaneously putting on Power Rangers-esque live shows for children.





 4  Horsea 
        

Another Generation I Pokémon, Horsea is based, as its name suggests, on a seahorse. Despite its small frame, Horsea is surprisingly tough and can spray water or black ink at any attacker. Like real-life seahorses, male Horsea are in charge of raising the young. It creates whirlpools through its dance-like swimming and competes with each other to see who can create the best one. In the anime, Misty owned a Horsea, which was her first wild catch during the series&#39; run. It often had a harder time battling than her Staryu and Starmie, so she mostly kept it as a companion, rather than as a battle partner.





 3  Shellos 
        

One of the most inspired Pokémon in Generation IV, Shellos has two different appearances. West Sea Shellos is pink and white and has a series of growths coming out its head that resemble flower petals. East Sea Shellos is blue and green and has two knobs resembling horns and extending out of its face. It can exist on both sea and land, as reflected by its evolution&#39;s Water/Ground typing, and has great regenerative capabilities. In the Diamond and Pearl anime, Dawn&#39;s main rival, Zoey, owned a Shellos, which she used to compete in contests. Her Shellos eventually evolved into the far less cute Gastrodon.





 2  Popplio 
        

Alola&#39;s Water starter, Popplio is a blue, seal-like creature, although the Pokédex classifies it as the Sea Lion Pokémon. It has an extremely affable nature and is very playful. It snorts bubbles from its nose to entertain others and to use as part of its battle strategy. It enjoys performing acrobatic stunts and jumps and appreciates the applause of amused audiences. In the anime, Ash&#39;s friend Lana had a Popplio, which very much enjoyed singing, and it eventually evolved all the way to a Primarina. Lana&#39;s Popplio was also known to be very polite, even to Team Rocket--at least until it realized who it was talking to.





 1  Piplup 
        

Going back to Generation IV, Sinnoh&#39;s Water starter is the absurdly adorable penguin Piplup. Don&#39;t be fooled by its cute exterior, however, because Piplup is extremely proud and independent, to the point where it&#39;ll refuse food from humans, even its trainer. It has trouble trusting others, which makes it hard for it to bond with its trainer. Piplup played a large role in the anime, where it was Ash&#39;s companion Dawn&#39;s main Pokémon. Dawn&#39;s Piplup enjoyed participating in contests, and could be a little jealous at times. While her Piplup never evolved, that was probably for the best given its preference for contests.
There are many truly adorable Water-type Pokémon out there, which characters like Misty would be more than happy to elaborate on. As one of the three Starter Pokémon types, Water-types have endeared themselves to many a fan through these Starter Pokémon. Water-types have often played a big role in the anime as well, almost always factoring into Ash&#39;s teams in some way, alongside Water-type specialists like Misty and Lana. The cutest Water-type Pokémon are sure to make any fan see why specializing in this type would seem appealing.
