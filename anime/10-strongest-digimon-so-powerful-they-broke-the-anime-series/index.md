## Literature Review

With each new story, the Digimon universe adds more powerful digital monsters to help or hinder the DigiDestined, but who are the most powerful?




Despite all the cute and lovable monsters in the Digimon franchise, some of the franchise&#39;s strongest Digimon were so powerful that they basically broke the anime series with their awesome might. Part of Digimon&#39;s appeal has always been the idea of a cute rookie Digimon turning into an absolute behemoth. Some Digimon go well beyond Behemoth though and grow so powerful that they basically warp reality around themselves.
Few other anime have developed such a rich and diverse world as the Digimon franchise. Stretching back to its 1999 debut with Digimon Adventures and running to its most current anime Digimon Ghost Game, the franchise has introduced a multitude of Digimon that span the spectrum of powers and abilities. The Digimon universe has over 1,000 different types of digital monsters. Out of those myriad of monsters, ten stand head over shoulders above the rest in terms of raw power.









 








 10  Piedmon - Clown of Hell 
Debuted in Digimon Adventure
        

Fans shouldn’t let the Clown from Hell’s humorous demeanor distract them from the fact that he is one of the digital world’s most dangerously powerful beings. Like DC’s Joker, Piedmon combines hilarity and violence to a devastating effect. A Mega-level Digimon that is part digital, part undead, Piedmon defies classification. However, one fact is sure, Piedmon always comes to a fight willing and able to win it. Outside his asymmetric tactics, which are always hard to read, Piedmon comes equipped with multiple weapons, such as the Trump Sword, which can teleport his blades to any location, including through an opponent. Fighting Piedmon is no laughing matter.





 9  Alphamon - Aloof Hermit 
Debuted in Digital Monster X-evolution
        

Alphamon is one of the Royal Knights – the top-tier Digimon tasked with protecting the Digital World. While Alphamon tends to only appear when there is a significant risk of a digital crisis, when he does appear, he rarely loses. Outside his Mega-level status – which already signifies his impressive abilities, what makes Alphamon so powerful is the ability to compress multiple devastating attacks with such speed and accuracy that it appears he&#39;s completed just one final strike. And if that wasn’t enough, he can also summon a shikigami-like monster to assist him in taking down an opponent.





 8  Daemon - Hellfire of Chaos 
Debuted in Digimon Adventure: 02
        

Daemon has not only shown himself to be a particularly powerful presence among the forces of evil within the Digimon Universe but also as the bane of all those who seek to promote and maintain the integrity of the Digital World. Daemon&#39;s unrivaled power over the dark areas of the Digital World is indisputable and gives him access to dark forces. Daemon’s individual power comes from his ability to change size at will, make himself invulnerable, and shoot a hellfire blast that is so hot, it can melt anything it contacts. He is the definition of pure, digitized evil.





 7  Apocalymon - Unidentified Digimon 
Debuted in Digimon Adventure
        

First appearing in Digimon Adventure (1999), Apocalymon is rumored to have appeared spontaneously as a result of the negative thoughts that are created when a Digimon is deleted. Those negative thoughts form the central purpose of Apocalymon’s existence, namely to bring about the Digital World&#39;s end. Considered a Mega-level Digimon, Apocalymon is a powerful force of evil in the digital world with the ability to reverse a Digimon’s digivolution back to its basic form. Moreover, Apocalymon can copy the abilities of any Digimon he devolves. Apocalymon also has two ultimate weapons, namely the ability to delete a victim into nothingness, and the ability to self-destruct and wipe out the entire dimension he was in.





 6  Black War Greymon - Jet-Black Dragon Warrior 
Debuted in Digimon Adventure 02


 







Black War Greymon is the rare Digimon who was created for the single purpose of defeating the Digi-destined and destroying the Digital World. Blackwargreymon was created by Arukinemon after her defeat at Giga House. However, as a result of the complexity of the construction process, while Blackwargreymon was imbued with impressive powers, Arukinemon was not able to program him for complete obedience. As a result, rather than blindly following her orders to destroy, he acts according to his own ideas. A Mega-level Digimon, Black War Greymon is invulnerable to the attacks of most Digimon regardless of their level. In addition, he is a skilled fighter. His secret weapon is an upgraded terror destroyer beam that can obliterate anything it touches.





 5  Gallantmon - Sky-Conquering Armored Lancer 
Debuted in Digimon Tamers


 







Gallantmon, like Alphamon, is another member of the Royal Knights – the Mega-level Digimon who protect the Digital World. One of Gallantmon’s key powers is that his armor is nearly invulnerable. With the peace of mind his armor gives him, Gallantmon can focus on attacking opponents, which is greatly assisted by his lance that can overcome even the toughest protective measures. Perhaps most importantly, Gallantmon is a genius-level tactician who has helped the Royal Knights overcome significant odds more than once.





 4  Lucemon - Paradise of Loss 
Debuted in Digimon Frontier
        

As the Seven Great Demon Lords&#39; leader, Lucemon is perhaps the most influential villain in the Digimon franchise. But one would never know that by his appearance. He began his digital life as a member of the angelic Digimon before he led an attempted coup against a supreme Digimon known as God. As a result, Lucemon was banished to the dark web where he embraced his dark side and continued his challenge against the digital world.
Another Mega-level Digimon, Lucemon is not to be trifled with. Depending on his mode, he can unleash a range of weapons from shooting fire from his mouth to firing life-sapping energy orbs to hammering opponents into submission using his superior size and strength.





 3  Shoutmon X7 (Superior Mode) 
Debuted in Digimon Xros Wars: The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms
        

Due to the combination of various Digimon who, in a time of need, agreed to be bonded together in one form, when Shoutmon X-7 enters the battlefield, there’s more than just one Digimon facing an opponent. Shoutmon X-7 was created by the DigiFusion of Dorulumon, Starmons, Sparrowmon, and Ballistamon into the body of OmniShoutmon.
His status as a fusion not only gives Shoutmon X-7 access to the hearts and minds of those Digimon who make up the whole, but also it allows Shoutmon X-7 to tap into the strength and skills of their individual parts, as a result of each body part - arms, legs, and torso, and head - remaining under the control of the individual Digimon. In its Superior Mode, Shoutmon X-7 is the epitome of strength through team work.





 2  Imperialdramon Paladin Mode - Ancient Holy Knight 
Debuted in Digimon Adventure 02: Diablomon Strikes Back
        

One of the oldest Digimon in existence, Imperialdramon is an ancient dragon Digimon who transformed into humanoid form (Imperialdramon Fighter Mode) during a battle against SkullSatamon. Having all the strength, experience, and knowledge of its dragon form, Imperialdramon Fighter Mode is a relentless battlefield opponent.
His powers only increased when, with the help of Omnimon, Imperialdramon Fighter transformed into Imperialdramon Paladin. Armed with the Omni Sword, which originally was the torso of Omnimon, Imperialdramon Paladin can cancel opponents with just one swing. Imperialdramon is also the founder of the Royal Knights, cementing his legacy in the Digital World.





 1  Omnimon - Legendary Warrior 
Debuted in Digimon Adventure: Our War Game


 







When it comes to battlefield prowess, Omnimon AKA Omegamon is second to none. Formed by the Digifusion of Wargreymon and Metalgarurumon, Omnimon might be the series&#39; most iconic fusion. Omnimon combines two of the most powerful Digimon in the digital world into one body. A Mega-level Digimon and a member of the Royal Knights, Omnimon wields Wargreymon&#39;s shield and almighty Grey Sword with one arm, and Metalgarurumon&#39;s devastating cannon and missile array on the other.
Due to its possession of the X-Antibody and Omega inForce, Omnimon can literally read an opponent&#39;s moves even before they initiate an action. Combined with the Grey Sword&#39;s ability to delete an opponent on contact, Omnimon is virtually unbeatable in battle. All of this results in Omnimon ranking as the series&#39; strongest Digimon.
