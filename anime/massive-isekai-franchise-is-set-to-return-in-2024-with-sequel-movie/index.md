Overlord was one of the first isekai to explode to massive popularity in the mid-2010s, along with other successful series such as That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. It follows the basic premise of what a person would do if, rather than being reincarnated as the hero of a fantasy story, they ended up as an immortal and all-powerful undead wizard with countless minions. Suzuki Satoru was a human in a futuristic bleak world who only found solace in playing the virtual MMORPG YGGDRASIL. However, when the game shuts down due to lack of players, Satoru awakens in the &#34;New World&#34; as his character, the lich Ainz Ooal Gown. Where Overlord takes an interesting spin, however, is in the protagonist&#39;s reaction to his new status.




In meeting the now-real NPC created by his former guild companions before they abandoned the game, Satoru/Ainz decides it&#39;s his duty to protect them and act as the &#34;evil overlord&#34; they expect him to be, as a way of keeping the memory of his only friends alive. Thus, and thanks to his undead status, Ainz&#39;s action are totally devoid of morality, his only objective being the prosperity of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, making from some pretty dark moments in the series. The anime has four seasons, which have adapted volumes 1-11 of the light novel series. Volume 12, The Paladin of the Holy Kingdom, will be the subject of the upcoming movie.

          

There is not much information regarding Overlord: The Holy Kingdom, besides that it will come out at some point in 2024, and it will be directed by Naoyuki Itou and produced by Madhouse. Based on the source material, the story will see Demiurge, one of Ainz&#39;s faithful Guardians, pose as a demon who wants to destroy the Roble Holy Kingdom, which will seek help from Ainz&#39;s Sorcerer Kingdom. To find out what Ainz&#39;s actual scheme entails, fans will have to wait until Overlord: The Holy Kingdom comes out later this year.
