## Literature Review

With the departure of many popular series, plenty of hidden isekai gems on Netflix have finally have their space to shine. 




With the high turn-over rates for the many shows on Netflix, especially anime, it’s about time to reconsider the best of the isekai genre that the platform has to offer. Many popular shows have left the Netflix catalogue, such as Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun, The Devil is a Part-timer, Overlord, No Game No Life, Konosuba, and more. What is left behind are hidden gems and unexpected entries that stretch, or even overturn the definition of an isekai.
The word isekai in Japanese directly translates to &#34;another world&#34;, conjuring images of fantasy, new landscapes, and endless possibilities for redemption. Although this blazingly popularizing genre is highly trope dependent, many authors have tried to subvert expectations with ideas such as being reborn as a vending machine in Reborn as a Vending Machine Now I Wander the Dungeon, or a librarian who transmigrates to a primitive society that lacks books in Ascendance of a Bookworm. However, isekai is more than just the physical transportation of bodies or souls across space. The only prerequisite is that characters are led to experience a world vastly different from their status quo.
            
 
 15 Best Isekai Anime You Should Watch Right Now 
Even with the oversaturation of the genre, there are still plenty of excellent isekai anime shows worth streaming in the summer of 2023.












 








 10  Sword Art Online is Considered One of the Forerunners 
Based on the light novel by Kawahara Reki
        

Although there are many isekai series preceding Sword Art Online, an anime adapted from a light novel of the same name in 2012 by A-1 Pictures, it is falsely considered one of the first of the genre because of its success and popularity. The anime vividly captures the fantastical and game-like visuals, and follows Kirito, as he, along with many others, are trapped in a virtual reality game where a death online results in death in reality. The high stakes and character relatability propelled the series to becoming one of the most-loved anime of its year, but it has since diminished due to lackluster sequels, and the perpetuation of tropes.

 9  Ni no Kuni Deepens the Game&#39;s World 
Based on the video game published by Bandai Namco
        

Based on a video game series of the same name, Ni no Kuni, released in 2019, explores the RPG-isekai relationship in the context of parallel worlds. This feature-length film produced by OLM and directed by Studio Ghibli animator Momose Yoshiyuki constructs a riveting world of monsters, princesses, and quests, while balancing character identities between two distinct worlds, hence the meaning of the title, which translates to &#34;the second country&#34;. While the world-building is exquisite, the movie ultimately serves to supplement the related game. As a result, character development leaves room for improvement, and narrative structure is undermined by excessive ornamentation, placing it at number nine on this list.

 8  Good Night World Brings Family Online 
Based on the manga by Okabe Uru
        

Studio NAZ has added a twist to the video game genre through exploring familial relationships in Good Night World. Aired in 2023, this original net animation (ONA) is an isekai in the sense that its characters experience a contrary online reality. The four main characters create a family, The Akabane Family, in the game Planet, but unknowingly, they are also family in reality. The series takes dramatic irony to the next level, pitting an ephemeral feeling of online kinship against neglected real-world relationships. Although the series gives substantial commentary on online relationships, and the line between fantasy and reality, common isekai tropes are unavoidable.

 7  Lookism Preaches Grass is Always Greener on the Other Side 
Based on the manhwa by Park Tae-Jun
        

Adapted as a Netflix original in 2022 from the Korean Manhwa of the same name, Lookism is a story of social expectation and vanity that pushes the common interpretation of an isekai. Park Hyung Suk, described as chubby and insecure, transfers to a new school in hopes of a better life, but finds he has awakened another, more attractive body. As one body sleeps, the other wakes, creating a dichotomy of two worlds, and two lives. However, Park Hyung Suk realizes that with a new life comes new obstacles. The series shows, through demonstration, that the flip side may not be as perfect as it seems.

 6  Uncle From Another World Disassembles the Conventionally Attractive Protagonist 
Based on the manga by Hotontoshindeiru
        

Uncle From Another World, or Isekai Ojisan, is a fresh take on established isekai tropes. Produced by studio AlelierPontdarc in 2022, this series follows Shibazaki Yousuke, who was comatose for 17 years, and his nephew, Takaoka Takafumi, who teaches him the ways of modern technology. The twist is, Shibazaki claims to have been transported to a fantasy world during his time asleep. This anime is a comedic rendering of an uncle&#39;s retelling of adventures in another world where he was ostracized for being ugly, and the monetization of his abilities, which truly exist, in the modernized world.

 5  InuYasha, the Unsuspecting Isekai Classic 
Based on the manga by Takahashi Rumiko
        

InuYasha aired in the year 2000, adapted by Sunrise Studios from the manga of the same name, and is an early example of an isekai that goes unnoticed as such. Having preceded Sword Art Online by over a decade, InuYasha is a story of a young, modern girl who stumbles upon a well which is connected to a feudal Japan ripe with demons and supernatural abilities. There, she meets the half-demon Inuyasha. This series is an isekai in the purest sense, as a fixed portal allows travel between and exploration of two worlds separated by space and time. InuYasha perfectly balances narrative and character development, with isekai elements only serving as support.

 4  Cardcaptor Sakura Puts the Magical Girl in Isekai 
Based on the manga by CLAMP
        

The original Cardcaptor Sakura, produced by Madhouse and adapted from its manga, aired in 1998, creating a memorable staple of the magical girl boom. Evidently, the series can also fall into the isekai genre. Kinomoto Sakura is a 10-year-old girl who finds and releases the “Clow Cards” all over the city. Subsequently, a cute companion creature nicknamed “Kero” is awakened and bestows on Sakura the power needed to reign in these dangerous cards, leading to easily marketable transformations, and adventures in a new world of magic, tough battles, and card collecting.

Produced by Bug Films, Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, or Zom 100, aired in 2023 and took the anime world by storm, topping the lists of many categories, including isekai. Zom 100 follows Tendou Akira through his adventures in a world colorfully painted by the blood of zombies. Contrary to the common, dreary depictions of apocalypse, Zom 100 embraces optimism among disaster, as Tendou is rejuvenated by the fact that he no longer needs to work at the exploitative company that had been the root of his sufferings. This series is a success not only in creating new worlds from the mundane, but also in implementing complex themes.
