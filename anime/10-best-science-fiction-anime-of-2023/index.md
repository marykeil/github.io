From continuations and reboots of iconic franchises to surprising new original titles, 2023 has been a surprisingly great year for sci-fi anime.




The year 2023 has been great for all types of anime, and science fiction is no exception. While this genre may not be as popular or extensive as others, this means little to the fans and creators who continue to show their passion for it every year.

It is safe to say that both new and old fans of the genre had opportunities to rejoice this year. Some titles were additions to much-beloved franchises, coming either in the form of sequels, that continued stories fans were eagerly waiting to see more of, or reboots, that completely revitalized their respective worlds, adapting them to the tastes of modern audiences. Others were entirely new and original, captivating viewers with their creative worlds and events.









 








 10  NieR:Automata Ver1.1a Beautifully Adapts a Beloved Video Game 
Produced by A-1 Pictures and Based on the Video Game by Yoko Taro


 







After Earth was suddenly invaded by aliens and their dangerous &#34;Machine Lifeforms&#34;, humanity had no choice but to take refuge on the Moon and create androids that would fight against their invaders for them. Now known as &#34;YoRHa&#34; soldiers, androids like 2B and 9S are stuck in a seemingly endless war, relentlessly fighting in the name of a species they hardly know anything about.
Although it suffered from a troubled production life, being delayed multiple times, NieR:Automata Ver1.1a still became one of the best anime inspired by games. Fans of the game consider it an excellent adaptation, but even those unfamiliar with the source are likely to be entertained by the title, given its incredibly profound story, detailed world-building, extraordinary sound design, and stunning fluid animation.

 9  Edens Zero 2nd Season Takes an Epic Galaxy-Spanning Journey to Even Greater Heights 
Produced by J.C. Staff and Based on the Manga by Hiro Mashima


 







Visiting Granbell Kingdom in search of content for her B-Cube channel, Rebecca Bluegarden instead finds Shiki Granbell, a boy who can manipulate gravity. With the aim of making new friends and finding &#34;Mother&#34;, the Goddess of the Cosmos, they set out on a grand, galaxy-spanning adventure. However, even with a crew and a spaceship of their own, their journey is far from an easy one.
Created by the author of Fairy Tail, Edens Zero shares numerous parallels with the latter, with an especially noticeable example being the familiar character designs. However, despite its reputation, Edens Zero is not a copy of Fairy Tail, but rather a remarkable title that undeservedly got overlooked by many anime fans. Those willing to give it a chance are sure to be impressed by its well-developed characters, intriguing world, and surprisingly intricate story.
