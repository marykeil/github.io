## Literature Review

It&#39;s often forgotten Dragon Ball&#39;s Chi-Chi is a capable fighter who  can hold her own in battle, with new fanart reminding fans exactly who she is.




In Dragon Ball lore, Chi-Chi is a staple franchise character who has been at Goku’s side almost from the beginning of his decades-long journey to become the strongest warrior of all. And while Chi-Chi has more or less been relegated to a life of worrying over her family and making sure Gohan keeps up with his studying, she was once a formidable fighter who gave Goku a run for his money, with new fanart bringing Chi-Chi back to her fighting roots!




A piece of art uploaded to X by username @DBSKAKERU1, this account is no stranger to creating authentic-looking Dragon Ball sketches, ones that transcend the fanart label with their manga-accurate style and professional-level quality usually reserved for series creator Akira Toriyama.


 

Having more recently shared images depicting Trunks as the King of the Saiyans, Super Saiyan 2 Gohan after he handily defeated a Cell Jr., Chi-Chi joyfully embracing a Super Saiyan Goku and Gohan during their downtime before the Cell Games, and more, @DBSKAKERU1 is the perfect artist to bring Chi-Chi back full-circle with fanart that brings a previously unseen version of her to life.

                  Dragon Ball Gave Chi-Chi the Series&#39; Most Bizarre Death   The last fight Chi-Chi ever fought in Dragon Ball Z ended in her tragic death, and that death was by far the most bizarre in the entire franchise.    





 Chi-Chi Becomes An Inaugural Z-Fighter In New Dragon Ball Fanart 
          

Wife to the legendary Saiyan known as Goku and mother to the half-Saiyans of Gohan and Goten, Chi-Chi is often portrayed as a quick-to-anger person who is overly protective of the ones she cares about most, yet still offers a warm heart and helping hand when needed otherwise. Debuting in Chapter 11 of the original Dragon Ball manga and then making her first appearance in the anime’s seventh episode, Chi-Chi was introduced as the relatively shy and quiet daughter of the Ox King and participated in the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament where she gave Goku a hard time during their match, proving her worth as a fighter on par with the best of them.

Drawn in @DBSKAKERU1’s stunning Dragon Ball art style, Chi-Chi is shown dressed in a familiar-looking orange gi and blue boots, a wardrobe choice that&#39;s made even better by an added kanji symbol that looks to be Master Roshi’s iconic “turtle” logo worn by those under his tutelage. Kicking out her hips in a playful pose, Chi-Chi holds a bo staff at the ready as she scans her surroundings for a hopeful new opponent; a look that comes across as both mischievous and determined at the same time, perfectly encapsulating what Chi-Chi is all about while in a fight.

So while Chi-Chi hasn’t shown her true power as a Z-Fighter in quite some time, it can’t be denied that should she decide to jump back into the fray, she’ll have a perfect design to mark her return with, all thanks to the creative talent of @DBSKAKERU1. Chi-Chi is a legacy hero who deserves more love and exposure outside of her current mom role in both the Dragon Ball anime and manga, so maybe it’s time for her to step back in the spotlight and start up her martial arts training once again!
