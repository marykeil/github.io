## Literature Review

Ryu Nakayama has announced the formation of Andraft, a new animation production unit that has already started releasing videos.




Ryu Nakayama, who directed Chainsaw Man, announced that he has established Andraft, a new animation production group. While it is still new and currently recruiting artists, this has not stopped the new studio from already building its resume by putting out a promotional video, marking Andraft&#39;s first step in becoming a fully-fledged anime studio.




New anime studios are always welcome, especially when they are led by notable industry members. Nakayama, who made his directorial debut with MAPPA&#39;s adaptation of Chainsaw Man, looks to have the experience and pull to get Andraft off the ground.


 

More importantly, the studio may be the force for change that entices new talent and retains it with better work environments.

                  One-Punch Man Artist Announces New Anime Studio   The talented artist behind One-Punch Man, Yusuke Murata, has launched his own anime studio, and revealed teaser videos for his first anime series.   


 Andraft Promises Flexible Hours And Remote Work 
         




In its mission statement, Andraft describes its concept like this:


We want to establish an environment where we can continue to take on various challenges without being bound by existing concepts and maintain that impetus for as long as possible. To bring even freer expression to more people in the time to come, so that we can enjoy it together. As a place where you can truly face your creativity.


According to Anime News Network, Andraft is currently recruiting in-between and key animators, various directors, artists, production assistants, and producers. While the studio is still testing the waters with contract or outsourced workers, Nakayama has not been idle. Under his directing, storyboarding ,and producing, Andraft has already created a minute-long PV advertising a collaboration between the VSPO! e-sports Vtuber agency and the popular Cardfight!! Vanguard game, which shows an excellent sense of momentum and detail that adds realism to the short fight scene. It&#39;s a small first step, but hopefully also a show of the quality of Andraft&#39;s future productions.




Nakayama has worked in the anime industry since 2010, getting his start as a key animator for several shows before finally turning heads when he was selected to direct the highly anticipated Chainsaw Man, where he delivered meticulously high-quality animation that used muted, realistic visuals. However, it may be his time at MAPPA, now mired in controversy over its treatment of staff, that inspired Andraft to promise the use of flextime scheduling and remote work for distant workers. Andraft also currently doesn&#39;t ask for previous experience, only passion for creativity. It feels like a visible pushback against current industry trends.



 The Chainsaw Man Anime Will Have To Change Director 
          

There are questions, of course, about the future of both MAPPA and Andraft, since there is no telling how the Chainsaw Man anime will continue without Nakayama&#39;s input. This is especially pertinent since MAPPA earlier announced it was adapting the manga&#39;s Reze arc into a feature film. Fans have clamored for it, as it confirms that the adaptation will continue. However, a Chainsaw Man without Nakayama may be the necessary price to pay for Andraft&#39;s push to absorb new passionate talent and create a work environment that focuses on creating a healthier industry not designed to chase away prospective talents with overwork.
