## Literature Review

With plenty of new noteworthy titles, 2023 proved to be a great year for manhwa fans, especially for those who enjoy isekai and returner tropes.




Once hardly comparable to the more well-developed manga medium, manhwa works have increased not only in quality but also in quantity over the years, much to the delight of fans. Naturally, 2023 only further continued this trend, giving readers a variety of options in terms of the best new manhwa of 2023.
While manhwa titles tell all kinds of stories, covering a wide range of themes and genres, the ones released in 2023 are illustrative of their time, providing a snapshot of the current manhwa landscape. Although plenty of new works were released this year, the most popular and successful ones tend to either fall into the action genre, or to involve isekai/returner tropes, which have become nearly emblematic of the medium.
While it was released just before 2023 (in late December 2022), Mother&#39;s Contract Marriage is a popular manhwa that deserves more attention, not only for its innovative approach to an oversaturated trope, but also for its overall quality. 










 








 10  Cleric of Decay (Action/Fantasy) 
Based on the Web Novel by Sadadeum, Written by Bori, &amp; Illustrated by YU
        

Marnac loves trying out unusual classes in video games, which is why he is intrigued by the idea of playing as the titular cleric of decay. Upon finally switching to this class, however, he finds himself pulled into the game&#39;s world, forced to live as the only disciple of the despised Order of the Decay, serving a goddess known as the Mother of Decay, who wishes for nothing but murder. As a cleric of decay, Marnac receives holy points from sacrificing people and obtaining sacred relics, which he can use to get new skills and have any wish granted.
While Cleric of Decay&#39;s premise may be nothing new, it still proves to be an extremely entertaining title. Distinguishing itself through its unique characters and interactions, this title innovates upon classic power fantasy works by emphasizing elements of comedy and by revolving around simple yet intriguing plot points.

 7  The Reincarnated Assassin Is a Swordmaster (Action/Fantasy) 
Based on the Web Novel by Geulgaemi, Written by Daon Creative, &amp; Illustrated by Tess


 







House Robert creates assassins by kidnapping or buying children, and raising them solely for the purpose of doing their dirty work.

Based on the Web Novel by Bedes, Written by Gaechaban, &amp; Illustrated by Binukki


 







When a popular VR game named &#34;Chronicles of Arcana&#34; suddenly becomes reality, the world is threatened by dangerous monsters which can only be defeated by the &#34;players&#34; who obtained their in-game characters&#39; skills. Gaining the power to stand up to this threat may sound nice, but to Lee Ho-Yeol, who created his character during his &#34;chunibyo&#34; stage, it also means transforming into someone with awkward mannerisms and speech patterns.

Stories revolving around unexpected world-changing events and characters who gain special powers to deal with new foes may be common in the manhwa medium, but The Player Hides His Past shines through its unique protagonist and his surprisingly comedic situation. Beyond the simple yet intriguing journey lies an incredibly enjoyable experience, making this a fantastic fantasy manhwa title.
