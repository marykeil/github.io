<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>With plenty of new noteworthy titles, 2023 proved to be a great year for manhwa fans, especially for those who enjoy isekai and returner tropes.</p>
<p>Once hardly comparable to the more well-developed manga medium, manhwa works have increased not only in quality but also in quantity over the years, much to the delight of fans. Naturally, 2023 only further continued this trend, giving readers a variety of options in terms of the best new manhwa of 2023.
While manhwa titles tell all kinds of stories, covering a wide range of themes and genres, the ones released in 2023 are illustrative of their time, providing a snapshot of the current manhwa landscape. Although plenty of new works were released this year, the most popular and successful ones tend to either fall into the action genre, or to involve isekai/returner tropes, which have become nearly emblematic of the medium.
While it was released just before 2023 (in late December 2022), Mother&rsquo;s Contract Marriage is a popular manhwa that deserves more attention, not only for its innovative approach to an oversaturated trope, but also for its overall quality.</p>
<p>10  Cleric of Decay (Action/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Sadadeum, Written by Bori, &amp; Illustrated by YU</p>
<p>Marnac loves trying out unusual classes in video games, which is why he is intrigued by the idea of playing as the titular cleric of decay. Upon finally switching to this class, however, he finds himself pulled into the game&rsquo;s world, forced to live as the only disciple of the despised Order of the Decay, serving a goddess known as the Mother of Decay, who wishes for nothing but murder. As a cleric of decay, Marnac receives holy points from sacrificing people and obtaining sacred relics, which he can use to get new skills and have any wish granted.
While Cleric of Decay&rsquo;s premise may be nothing new, it still proves to be an extremely entertaining title. Distinguishing itself through its unique characters and interactions, this title innovates upon classic power fantasy works by emphasizing elements of comedy and by revolving around simple yet intriguing plot points.

<p>9  The Top Dungeon Farmer (Adventure/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by sdcknight, Written by Hyeong Im, &amp; Illustrated by Ha-Gyeong Lee</p>
<p>When 100 gigantic, indestructible towers suddenly appeared across the world, people were naturally confused and anxious. But when these towers proved to be extremely lucrative, everyone was intrigued, including protagonist Se-Jun Park. While most people awaken on the first floor and are assigned a class such as wizard or warrior, Se-Jun is teleported to a completely different place and forced to become a farmer to survive, thereafter spending his days developing marketable foods and completing quests alongside cute companions such as bunnies and cats.
Following a farmer who lives a peaceful life using his resources strategically, The Top Dungeon Farmer provides an experience that is simultaneously soothing and compelling, which makes for a good break from the numerous action-oriented manhwa titles that are otherwise abundant in the medium.

<p>8  Being Raised by Villains (Romance/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Eun-Hyang Ja, Written by Yulli, &amp; Illustrated by A-Song Lee</p>
<p>Growing up neglected by her family and constantly compared with her brothers, with none of her efforts or achievements being recognized, Cha Mi-So moves out on her own, studying and working to sustain herself. Her only respite and source of healing is a novel about a loving family, which proves particularly soothing on her worst days. When she falls asleep only to awaken as a character in the novel, she is initially happy, before realizing that she is not the beloved protagonist, but rather an unfortunate side character fated to be kicked out, Eileen Etam.
Being Raised by Villains is a beautiful, wholesome family-oriented story that fans appreciate for its endearing characters and creative story. It also leverages beloved tropes of the isekai theme, with the protagonist using her knowledge to her advantage, and seeking to find in her new life what she could never have in her previous one, making this a remarkable romance manhwa title.
The creator of the Being Raised by Villains web novel also authored several other noteworthy titles that received manhwa adaptations, including Karina&rsquo;s Last Days, Just Leave Me Be, and Gimme That Pacifier!.</p>

<p>7  The Reincarnated Assassin Is a Swordmaster (Action/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Geulgaemi, Written by Daon Creative, &amp; Illustrated by Tess</p>
<p>House Robert creates assassins by kidnapping or buying children, and raising them solely for the purpose of doing their dirty work. Knowing no other way of life, these &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; become loyal dogs, controlled by mind shackles. When one such shadow is killed for acting independently, his strong wish for revenge causes him to be reborn as Raon Zieghart, a member of the most powerful noble house. But Raon is no ordinary swordsman, as he carries both the &ldquo;Flame Link&rdquo; technique and the &ldquo;Curse of Bitter Frost&rdquo;.
While it may not tell a particularly original revenge story, following a common isekai formula, The Reincarnated Assassin Is a Swordmaster stands out thanks to its execution, rather than its premise. From the interesting characters to the exceptional artwork, everything combines to deliver an immersive isekai experience that fans of the theme are sure to enjoy.

<p>6  The Player Hides His Past (Action/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Bedes, Written by Gaechaban, &amp; Illustrated by Binukki</p>
<p>When a popular VR game named &ldquo;Chronicles of Arcana&rdquo; suddenly becomes reality, the world is threatened by dangerous monsters which can only be defeated by the &ldquo;players&rdquo; who obtained their in-game characters&rsquo; skills. Gaining the power to stand up to this threat may sound nice, but to Lee Ho-Yeol, who created his character during his &ldquo;chunibyo&rdquo; stage, it also means transforming into someone with awkward mannerisms and speech patterns. However, as the only demon hunter around, it is up to him to face the risk of the demons that no one else can take on.
Stories revolving around unexpected world-changing events and characters who gain special powers to deal with new foes may be common in the manhwa medium, but The Player Hides His Past shines through its unique protagonist and his surprisingly comedic situation. Beyond the simple yet intriguing journey lies an incredibly enjoyable experience, making this a fantastic fantasy manhwa title.

<p>5  Martial God Regressed to Level 2 (Action/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Yeombi, Written by Anyeonseong, &amp; Illustrated by Yoon-Goo Lee</p>
<p>Initially thought to be a mere game between different nations, the nature of the &ldquo;BattleNet&rdquo; system changes completely when the Space League opens, forcing humankind to compete against other species from different planets. Continually losing to powerful aliens, Earth is eventually determined to be worthless and set to be deleted, but Jihan Seong resists deletion thanks to his &ldquo;Divine Nameless Technique&rdquo;. Deemed to show promise, he is returned to the past. Determined to do things differently this time, he sets out to reach his full potential and prevent the end of the world.
While its premise is far from innovative, with returner stories being rather common when it comes to manhwa, Martial God Regressed to Level 2 takes a generic story to new heights by way of well-developed characters and brilliant artwork that perfectly complements the events, making this a captivating action manhwa title.

<p>4  The Academy&rsquo;s Genius Swordsman (Action/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Gwan-Do Seo, Written &amp; Illustrated by Sichi</p>
<p>After a hard-fought battle resulting in a pyrrhic victory, Ronan finally defeats the third celestial giant that was threatening the empire. However, just before he can take a sigh of relief and reflect on the experience with Grand Marshal Adeshan, the only other surviving member of the imperial army, more giants begin to descend from the heavens, spelling the end of the world. Acknowledging Ronan&rsquo;s potential, Adeshan sends him to the past so that he can enroll in the Phileon Academy and become an even stronger swordsman to save their doomed empire.
Following the success of many other similar titles, The Academy&rsquo;s Genius Swordsman truly understands what fans enjoy about the returner trope, providing an experience that is nearly quintessential of this type of story. From the way the protagonist always makes optimal decisions to reach his full potential and become as strong as possible, to the stunning artwork and intricate setting, this title is truly engrossing.</p>

<p>3  Surviving the Game as a Barbarian (Action/Fantasy)
Based on the Web Novel by Yungang Jeong, Written by Taesu Han, &amp; Illustrated by MIDNIGHT STUDIO</p>
<p>Having spent much of his life hospitalized, Han-Su Lee naturally developed a passion for video games. Just as he was getting tired of the industry&rsquo;s many issues, he came across an unknown indie game that immediately captivated him, Dungeon and Stone. After spending nine years playing it with the aim of being the first one to complete it, he ventures into the boss room only to awaken in the body of Bjorn Yandel, a barbarian not too dissimilar from the one he was playing as. This is the beginning of his fascinating journey in a world where Bjorn can show no weakness.
Surviving the Game as a Barbarian tells a thrilling story that subverts isekai tropes and expectations, by placing its protagonist in a genuinely dangerous situation, where his origins as an otherworlder cannot be revealed. Moreover, despite his experience with the game, Bjorn still struggles with new information and unexpected situations. Featuring complex characters and fantastic artwork, this title is not one to miss.

After reaching the boss room on his 99th regression, only to learn that he requires a party of 5 players to proceed, he makes his final leap in time, determined to gather reliable allies and survive.
While its story may not be exceptional, The Max-Level Player&rsquo;s 100th Regression uses common tropes to provide an uncommon experience.

Based on the Web Novel by Regobalbasseo, Written by San-Chaek Lee, &amp; Illustrated by Seol Arang</p>

Now returned to the beginning of his life and having received a second chance to do things differently, he sets out to become as strong as possible and destroy the ones who betrayed him, leveraging his knowledge in the process.
Combining two extremely popular manhwa themes, revenge and age regression, Revenge of the Baskerville Bloodhound follows a cunning protagonist that constantly defies expectations, coldly and brutally going after his goals. From the story, to the fights, and the artwork, everything about this title is outstanding, making it one of the best new manhwa of 2023.
