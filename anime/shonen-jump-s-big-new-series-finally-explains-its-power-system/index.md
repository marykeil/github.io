## Literature Review

Chihiro and Sojo have begun their showdown in Kagurabachi, and the clash of Enchanted Blades finally gives some clue as to how they function.




The newest chapter of Shonen Jump&#39;s Kagurabachi has its hero face off with the wicked arms dealer, Sojo. This marks the first time Chihiro is dealing with the business end of a hostile Enchanted Blade. More importantly, the fight also establishes the rules that the swords operate under in the world of the manga.




Chapter 9, appropriately titled &#34;Enten vs. Cloud Gouger&#34;, focuses on combat between wielders of Rokuhira&#39;s magic swords. Besides providing spectacular displays of their powers, it also allows the manga to cleverly disguise some exposition, like Chihiro&#39;s tactical considerations. By cataloging the Cloud Gouger&#39;s abilities, readers are able to recognize how both it and Chihiro&#39;s swords operate as Enchanted Blades.

                  Kagurabachi&#39;s Success Proves The Manga Industry Is Changing Forever   Kagurabachi&#39;s instant success and the rising popularity of manga prove the manga industry may be quite literally taking over the world.   


 Kagurabachi&#39;s Enchanted Blades Have Limitations 
         

Genichi Sojo had already displayed some of Cloud Gouger&#39;s abilities in the chapter prior, when he froze Daruma in ice. Against Chihiro, however, the Cloud Gouger becomes much less esoteric: the hero not only recognizes the sword&#39;s abilities but is able to list the majority of them. Sojo&#39;s Enchanted Blade has three abilities: &#34;Mei&#34;, which produces lightning; &#34;Yui&#34;, which produces ice, and one more that has yet to be revealed. Another visual treat is that the activation of each sword seems accompanied by the appearance of an abstract animal, as Sojo is now followed around by a wispy, dragon-shaped cloud.




Keen observers will note that the number of abilities Cloud Gouger has is similar to Enten, which is implied to have one for each of Chihiro&#39;s three goldfish. As such, it appears that the Enchanted Blades might have a hard limit of no more than three spells for each. Given the sorcerers seen so far seem to have mastery of just one sort of attack, seeing each wielder of a sword with casual access to multiple, which are further amplified by the nature of the Blades, makes clear why they are considered massive game changers in this world of swords.

This considered move by author Takeru Hokazono seems to be a way to add some strategy to his fights. While the spells of the Enchanted Blades are powerful, they still have limits. This ensures that the characters still have plenty of reason to engage in melee range. Furthermore, while they have up to three unique attacks, there is plenty of room to allow Chihiro, Sojo, and whoever else follows to keep their third ability as a dramatic trump card. This restraint may prevent Kagurabachi&#39;s characters from falling into the shonen cliché of constantly adopting new powers – at least for now.
