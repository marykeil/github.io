## Literature Review

Cloverworks revealed that it is adapting the novel Trapezium. The movie, which premieres next May, provides a fresh look at the Idol business.




Anime studio Cloverworks revealed that it is adapting the novel Trapezium into a movie. It was revealed via a new teaser video released on YouTube. The movie, which follows an aspiring idol performer, currently has a Japan release date of May 2024, with no current indications of an international release for now.




Anime centering on the idol industry is nothing new, but Cloverworks&#39; vision of Trapezium seems to offer more fabulous visuals, while the story focuses on the protagonist&#39;s coming-of-age. Trapezium&#39;s author, Kazumi Takayama, is herself an idol, promising that the topic goes past surface-level aesthetics.


 

Given the teaser footage, the movie should provide plenty of entertainment for audiences beyond those who love the idol sub-genre of anime.

The teaser, currently hosted on Aniplex&#39;s YouTube channel, comes with a synopsis in its description. Translated, it describes the plot as such:


On May 10, 2024, a coming-of-age story opens, depicting ten years in the life of a girl who aspires to become an idol. Yu Higashi, a first-year high school student, lives her high school life by imposing four rules on herself to &#34;definitely become an idol&#34;: &#34;I will not use social networking services,&#34; &#34;I will not have a boyfriend&#34;, &#34;I will not stand out at school&#34;, and &#34;I will make friends with beautiful girls from the east, west, south, and north&#34;. What is the outcome of Yu&#39;s dream that she pursues throughout her high school life?


Trapezium was originally written by Kazumi Takayama, who was formerly a first-generation member of the idol group Nogizaka46, meaning the author has a greater awareness of the idol industry she was part of. The staff attached to the project are no slouches, either: director Masahiro Shinohara was involved in the Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai series, and Koji Masunari, who is supervising the film, made storyboards for both Oshi no Ko and Tonikawa. Between the staff and the original story, Trapezium has a creative team familiar with creating dramatic stories centered on both daily life and idols.




Idol anime is a growing sub-genre in the industry, frequently combining underdog stories about rising to the top as star performers, with merchandisable song-and-dance routines that send fans running to buy music albums and attend live stage concerts. The market has seen everything from franchises like The Idolmaster and Love-Live, to parodies like Zombieland Saga. Trapezium&#39;s teaser trailer, however, shows little in the way of glittering stages, instead focusing on its protagonist&#39;s struggles. In this sense, it might be accurate to say it&#39;s a coming-of-age movie with an idol frame, rather than &#34;idol anime&#34; that comes with its prebuilt expectations.

Cloverworks has been turning up repeatedly in industry news recently. Besides helping animate the popular Spy X Family, it is also working on the movie Fureru, another high-profile movie coming out next year. While Trapezium&#39;s March release date only accounts for Japan thus far, the notion of a story originally written by an idol, when combined with the spectacular visuals shown so far, makes it highly likely it will come West sooner or later. It will not be surprising if the likes of Crunchyroll or Netflix eventually announce that Trapezium will appear on their services very soon.
