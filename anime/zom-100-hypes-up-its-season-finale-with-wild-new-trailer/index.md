## Literature Review

Zom 100 released a trailer for its last 3 episodes ahead of their Christmas Day air date,, and the season finale looks absolutely wild.




Ahead of the release of the final episodes of Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead, the trailer for the remaining episodes has just been revealed. After suffering many setbacks, the anime is set to premiere all its episodes at once on Christmas Day.




The official website of Zom 100 has released a 3-minute trailer that both goes over what happened in previous episodes and what to expect in the upcoming ones. Posted on YouTube by the publisher of the manga, Viz Media, the video is a promising sign that the studio has sorted out the production issues.


 

The release date for Zom 100&#39;s final 3 episodes was announced on November 6, 2023, and as the days approach the promised day of December 25, a trailer was put out to fuel the hype.

                  Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead Episode 10 Release Date &amp; Time   Zom 100 episode #9 appears to be taking the anime into its final arc, and here&#39;s everything to know about when episode #10 will continue it.   


 Zom 100&#39;s Finale Will Resolve Episode 9&#39;s Big Cliffhanger 
          




Episode #9 ended on a cliffhanger, with Akira&#39;s father confronting the approaching zombies. After a heartfelt reunion with his parents, the series introduced its first and perhaps main villain who wreaked havoc on Akira&#39;s childhood home. With his father urging him to keep chasing his dreams, Akira and Kencho go forward and fight the zombies and the villain in a struggle for survival. The trailer concludes by showing one of the 100 goals that Akira wishes to fulfill before dying: repay his parents for all they did.

Based on the manga by Haro Aso and Kotaro Takata, Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead is one of the most memorable anime of the year. Despite the controversy surrounding the production, the unique plot of the series and the references it made to the anime industry&#39;s brutal working conditions made it an instant hit. Revolving around Akira Tendo, a salaryman whose life is made miserable due to his harsh and demanding job, a zombie outbreak takes over the world. In a situation where he should be hopeless, Akira is overjoyed at the prospect of not going back to work and sets out on a mission to fulfill 100 things he&#39;s always wanted to do.




                  Jujutsu Kaisen Animator Meltdown Proves a Fundamental Problem With Anime&#39;s Biggest Studio   Studio MAPPA has been criticized for creating a toxic work environment, and a recent meltdown by Jujutsu Kaisen animators perfectly highlights that.   

Zom 100 has made Christmas even jollier for those who celebrate it, making the last three episodes available on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and Hulu for as many people to watch. There were a lot of issues with the production that unfortunately led to Zom 100 being put on an indefinite hiatus. It was sad considering how the series was one of the most popular anime of 2024 and was on the path to becoming a potential anime of the year. A lot of the hype for the anime has died down now, but that doesn&#39;t mean the episodes will not have many viewers. With how special summer was due to Zom 100: Bucket List Of The Dead, many fans will return to see the anime off as season 1 comes to an end.
