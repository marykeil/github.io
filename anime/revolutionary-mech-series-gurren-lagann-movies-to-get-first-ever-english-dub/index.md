## Literature Review

The Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann films are being re-released in theaters for their 15th anniversary, and that comes with their first-ever English dub.




Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was one of the biggest mecha anime to come out in the 2000s, and its movies are finally receiving an official English dub. Gurren Lagann has two compilation films covering each half of the story, Childhood’s End and The Lights in the Sky Are Stars, and while the films have been released in English-speaking territories, for some reason, they’ve never been dubbed into English.




Soon, however, the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies’ lack of an English dub will no longer be an issue. It was previously announced at Anime Expo that the Gurren Lagann compilation films would be re-released worldwide for their 15th anniversary, and at Anime NYC, it was further revealed that the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann films would finally be receiving an English dub.

          

For fans of Gurren Lagann’s English dub, the chance to finally see the movies dubbed into English is nothing but exciting, and overall, it’s great that fans are being given another opportunity to experience the films, this time with even better picture quality.

 Why The Gurren Lagann Movies Were Never Dubbed Into English Until Now 

 

With the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann films finally receiving an English dub, that begs the question of why they were never dubbed before. In an interview with Anime News Network, Aniplex’s former President of Animation Business Hideki “Henry” Goto said that the Gurren Lagann films weren’t being dubbed because it would take so long that no one would be interested by the time it was finished, so there wasn’t a point if the movies were never going to air on TV. Anime fans are often quick to drop something in favor of the latest thing, so the idea that people would lose interest in a dub of the films isn’t without merit.

As for why the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann films are being dubbed now, there are a wide variety of factors to consider. The aforementioned interview with Hideki “Henry” Goto was in 2010, so Aniplex’s leadership may have changed to have people more willing to dub the films. Not only that, but since the Gurren Lagann films’ re-release is to celebrate their 15th anniversary, that could be seen as a big enough deal to warrant dubbing them into English. The exact reason for Aniplex’s change in attitude might never be revealed, but at the end of the day, the fact that the films are finally being dubbed is all that matters.



 Why Gurren Lagann’s Movies Are Worth Watching 
          

Even without the novelty of getting to hear the English dub again, the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies are more than worth watching for both old fans and new. While anime compilation films have a reputation for being redundant, the Gurren Lagann films more than justify their existence with how many new scenes they add to the story, and The Lights in the Sky Are Stars is especially noteworthy for changing the final act to be even better and more over-the-top than the anime. The Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann movies have a lot going on for them, and the long-awaited English dub is sure to sell that idea even further.
