Screen Rant was unable to verify the source of this news. Until Togashi&#39;s interview with TV Asahi actually airs, this should be considered as speculation. When more information will be available, this page will be updated accordingly.







Yoshihiro Togashi, the author of Hunter X Hunter, has revealed one possible finale for his series, one that fans should consider canon in case of Togashi&#39;s untimely demise. The author has been struggling with his health for some time now, resulting in several hiatuses for the manga series. While he has been releasing new chapters recently, the schedule has been highly inconsistent, and there are still concerns about his well-being. It appears that Togashi is taking a gradual approach to his return, easing himself back into the demands of the series.

In an upcoming online interview with TV Asahi&#39;s Iwakura and Yoshizumi Show that will air on November 21st but has already been leaked online, Togashi revealed that he has already thought of three possible endings for the series. He did not share any details about them, but disclosed instead a fourth ending, which he discarded. The interview has been translated by X user Pewpiece.


 




Togashi added that, in case he should pass away before concluding the series, fans should consider this discarded scenario as the actual ending of Hunter x Hunter.

                  Hunter X Hunter&#39;s Creator Confirmed The Series’ Return - So Where is It?   Yoshihiro Togashi announces that a new Hunter x Hunter chapter is ready and that he is working on a new “production system” to guarantee publication.   


 Togashi&#39;s Favorite Hunter x Hunter Ending Is The One That Fans Will Hate The Most 
The author revealed he has three possible scenarios in mind for Hunter x Hunter&#39;s finale

 

Togashi expects that the first ending will be well-received, with around 50 percent of readers satisfied and 20 percent dissatisfied. Option B will be evenly split between satisfied and dissatisfied readers. However, the third option would have only a 10 percent satisfaction rate and a 90 percent dissatisfaction rate. Togashi admits that his favourite way to conclude the series would be the one that fans will dislike the most. He wishes to find an ending that he truly loves, and that fans will be satisfied with, instead of considering any of these three options.






The translation is not completely accurate, and this article will be updated when precise translations are available.




What is bound to make more waves, however, is that Togashi revealed a fourth option that he has already discarded, but fans can consider canon in the event of his death. This ending focuses on Jin, Gon&#39;s granddaughter, as she is fishing for the &#34;Lake Lord&#34;, the same fish that Gon caught at the start of his adventure. Contrary to Gon, however, Jin captures the giant fish to get her mother to stop pressuring her to become a Hunter. The young woman says that she could never let her loved ones wait endlessly for her like Gon and the other Hunters did, but her parents recognize that her talent will one day bring her away from Whale Island. The ending also reveals that Gon has become a famous and strong hunter and that he is married to Noko, one of the few children who grew up with him. The series ends with a bird flying over different places, showing many new characters who could be the children or grandchildren of the protagonists of Hunter x Hunter.






 Togashi Shares A Discarded Hunter x Hunter Finale With Fans 
          

Although this news does sound ominous considering Togashi&#39;s health, the context should be kept in mind. Togashi said clearly that this is simply an ending he discarded, so there is no risk of spoilers in sharing it with his fans. The reason why he specified this should be considered canon in case of his passing is, probably, because he still has not decided which of the other three valid possible endings he will use. While Togashi has suffered from health issues for a long time, he has also resumed working on Hunter X Hunter on a loosely regular schedule, which bodes well for his well-being. Hopefully, Hunter x Hunter fans will be able to read the finale of this generational saga crafted by the hands of its creator.

Hunter x Hunter is available from Viz Media and Manga Plus.
