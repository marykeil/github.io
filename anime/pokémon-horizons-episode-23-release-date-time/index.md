## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons Episode 23 picks up from last week&#39;s cliffhanger surrounding Friede and Amethio. Here&#39;s what fans need to know to tune in and watch.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          




At the moment, fans can only catch new episodes of Pokémon Horizons on Japanese network TV Tokyo, with episodes premiering at 6:55 PM JST each Friday. That&#39;s 2:55 AM on Friday for the West Coast of the US, and 5:55 AM on Friday for the US East Coast, making a live watch inconvenient, to say the least. Of course, these broadcasts are also intended for Japan and are aired in Japanese without English subtitles, requiring some knowledge of the language in order to follow the plot. Pokémon Horizons is confirmed for an English dub set to debut in late 2023, but no more specific date is available at this time.



 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #22? 
          

Episode #22 of Pokémon Horizons saw the team investigating the mines of Galar, where the Black Rayquaza was allegedly spotted. However, Liko and Roy quickly became separated from Friede, and each ran into members of Amethio&#39;s team, with Friede once again facing down Amethio himself. However, they soon find out they&#39;re not alone, and that a Galarian Moltres, one which apparently belonged to the Ancient Adventurer, has taken up roost inside the mines. Moltres proved to be far too powerful for Liko and Roy, and the pair had to escape, with the mine caving in behind them. Friede and Amethio were still inside, however, leaving their fate up in the air for now.

From the preview, it seems Liko and Roy will find their way back inside the mines somehow, likely searching for Friede. Captain Pikachu, who took a beating from Moltres in their first encounter, is looking for some revenge, but it seems Liko is curious about another idea to possibly handle the beastly Pokémon. Since Moltres was shown to have an Ancient Poké Ball, it may be possible to reason with it, like they did with Arboliva. Liko&#39;s pendant is also shown glowing again in the episode preview, suggesting that its connection to the Ancient Poké Balls may be key.

Episode #22 was quite exciting, and the episode marked Galarian Moltres&#39; first appearance in the anime. The series has so far used cliffhangers sparingly, but each has been well-executed, so there&#39;s no reason to think episode #23 will be any different. Will Moltres escape, like the Black Rayquaza did, or will it be entrusted to Liko and Roy like Arboliva? That&#39;d be one powerful Pokémon to entrust to these two relatively fresh trainers. Of course, the only way to find out what will happen is to watch the next episode of Pokémon Horizons.
