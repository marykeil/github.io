## Literature Review

Lofi Girl became incredibly popular thanks to its infectious music and anime aesthetic, and the latter was inspired by a classic Studio Ghibli film.




Lofi Girl is a massively popular YouTube channel, and it was inspired by an underrated Studio Ghibli classic. For five years, Lofi Girl has garnered a wide fanbase thanks to the infectious music playing in the videos and the anime aesthetic of the titular Lofi Girl. The channel has been referenced in a wide variety of forms, even getting a parody in Steven Universe, so its popularity can’t be understated.




Lofi Girl is definitely a popular channel, but it didn’t come from nowhere, as Lofi Girl is inspired by a classic Studio Ghibli film: Whisper of the Heart. The Studio Ghibli film in question is one of their more underrated films, so it makes sense that people might not be aware of the link between them, but the inspiration is clear, especially with how Lofi Girl mirrors one scene from the film, in particular.

          

It all serves as another reminder of Studio Ghibli’s impact on pop culture, and considering how little the film in question is talked about compared to its contemporaries, it’s one of the best statements of its incredible quality.


 LoFi Girl YouTube Channel Takes Inspiration From Whisper Of The Heart 
Whisper of the Heart is an underrated Ghibli classic, and one of the few movies not directed by Hayao Miyazaki.
          




Lofi Girl takes clear inspiration from Yoshifumi Kondo’s directorial debut, 1995’s Whisper of the Heart. Not only does Lofi Girl look almost exactly like Whisper of the Heart’s protagonist, Shizuku Tsukishima, but the entire premise of LoFi Girl studying while listening to music mirrors Shizuku doing the same thing early in the film. Granted, Lofi Girl has different clothes and headphones, and she’s depicted as writing with her left hand while Shizuku writes with her right hand, but it’s hard to see Lofi Girl as anything but a reference to Whisper of the Heart.


 

That, of course, is the end result of the channel’s battle with copyright violations. When Lofi Girl, under the name ChilledCow, first started streaming lofi music in 2017, the original stream was just a gif of the Whisper of the Heart scene in question playing on an infinite loop, but it was taken down after a few months due to copyright. This led to the founder of the channel, Dimitri, commissioning artists for an original character to avoid the issue, which led to the current Lofi Girl, and the fact that Dimitri chose to keep the new version as a reference to Whisper of the Heart makes its influence undeniable.






Lofi music is a mix of several different genres including hip hop, jazz and dream pop that has become incredibly popular on YouTube in recent years.






 LoFi Girl’s Popularity Gives Whisper Of The Heart The Recognition It Deserves 
          

If there’s anything to take from the popularity of LoFi Girl, it’s that it’s a great showing of how much recognition Whisper of the Heart deserves. The film is talked about far less than Studio Ghibli’s bigger hits, but the writing and overall direction of Yoshifumi Kondo easily make it one of their best, and Lofi Girl becoming such a popular YouTube channel by emulating it, of all films, is the greatest testament to its endearing quality. Whisper of the Heart might not be the most popular Studio Ghibli film, but things like Lofi Girl are proof that it’s still more than successful at leaving an impression on people.
