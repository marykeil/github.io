## Literature Review

Majin Buu is the strongest villain in Dragon Ball Z, but when Kid Buu was reincarnated as an established character in Dragon Ball GT he became a hero.





Majin Buu is easily the most powerful villain in both the classic and Z eras of the Dragon Ball series. With a history that stretches back eons and a god-tier impact on the entire universe, Majin Buu easily dwarfs any mortal fighter who challenges him (and most deities who attempt to do the same, as well). In the end, it took a Spirit Bomb consisting of the energy of billions of people to take Buu down, and that was only half of him. In Dragon Ball Z’s Majin Buu Saga, Buu was split into two halves–a good Buu and an evil Buu. By the end of the saga, these Buus fought each other, proving that both were pretty evenly matched. Then, the evil Buu (or Kid Buu) was obliterated by the Spirit Bomb, leaving only the good Buu who quickly became a member of the Z-Fighters. However, Kid Buu wouldn’t stay dead, as he was destined to return with all of his immense strength intact–though in a totally different form.




                  The Secret to Goku Unlocking Super Saiyan 4 Was GT&#39;s Beach Episode   Beach episodes in anime don&#39;t usually lead to massive upgrades in power for the protagonists, but in Goku&#39;s case, it did just that, as shown in GT.    


 The Evil Kid Buu was Reincarnated as Uub, and Became GT’s Greatest Hero 
          

In Dragon Ball GT episode 38 (written by Toshinobu Ooi, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), Super Saiyan 4 Goku is in the middle of his battle with Golden Great Ape Baby-Vegeta, and he is getting his butt kicked. The two had been fighting for some time, and while Goku’s energy had been almost totally drained, Baby-Vegeta was just rejuvenated by a blast from Bulma’s Blutz Wave Generator. In other words, Goku was about to lose, and humanity was all but doomed. However, before Baby-Vegeta could deliver the finishing blow, his insides start expanding and contracting rapidly, as if there was something inside of him trying to come out in the most violently aggressive way imaginable–and, in fact, there was: Uub.




In a previous episode, before Baby-Vegeta became a Golden Great Ape and Goku was presumed dead, Uub stepped up to battle the villain as Baby-Vegeta’s existence threatened the entire world–and even the whole universe. Using one of his iconic moves from when he was Kid Buu, Uub blasted Baby-Vegeta with an energy attack that would have turned him into chocolate. Unfortunately, that blast was countered by Baby-Vegeta, and Uub blasted himself with the attack, turning himself into chocolate instead–at which point, Baby-Vegeta ate him. As revealed in this episode, that was all a part of Uub’s plan to get inside Baby-Vegeta and attack him in a way that the villain couldn’t defend.

Not only were Uub’s tactics in this saga courageous (as he literally had to allow himself to be eaten in order to pull off his plan of attack) they were also incredibly brilliant and required a great deal of strength–all of which are ideal characteristics for a hero. Plus, if it wasn’t for Uub, Goku would have been killed, and Baby-Vegeta would have taken over the universe–meaning Uub essentially saved everyone in existence single-handedly. Based on these feats of heroism, Uub totally makes up for the evil he committed during his past life, successfully going from Dragon Ball Z’s worst villain to Dragon Ball GT’s greatest hero.
