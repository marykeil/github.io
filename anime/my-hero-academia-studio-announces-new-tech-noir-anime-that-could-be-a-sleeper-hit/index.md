## Literature Review

BONES&#39;s upcoming Metallic Rouge might be the action-packed successor to classic science fiction anime of yesteryear that fans have been waiting for.





Trailer footage and the description of the plot make Metallic Rouge look like a sci-fi classic blasting right out of the past. BONES itself is also hyping up the idea of a genre throwback, as the anime&#39;s website boasts of how the staff involved last teamed up 19 years ago for the cult classic mecha show RahXephon. Regardless, the story of an interplanetary manhunt should stand out among the season&#39;s offerings.

 Metallic Rouge Is the Successor of Classic Android Anime 

 

On Metallic Rouge&#39;s official website, the synopsis goes: &#34;A world where humans and androids coexist. Rouge, an android girl, with her partner Naomi, is on a mission on Mars. The mission is to murder nine androids who are hostile to the government.&#34; The teasers released so far give a taste of what&#39;s to expect: some show a power-armor-wearing woman fighting similarly augmented figures, while others show the interactions between the two main leads as they navigate the gritty industrial wasteland Mars has become. It certainly lives up to its description of being a &#34;tech noir&#34;, with its dark, grimy scenery.

The idea of a woman on the hunt for non-humans delightfully hearkens back to cult classics from the 80s. There was the short-lived but beloved Bubblegum Crisis, whose female bounty hunters took on rogue &#34;boomers&#34;, and Armitage III, a 4 episode long OVA about machines in disguise. If one pushes the limits, even Birdy the Mighty or Gunm/Battle Angel Alita are relevant, as they depict powerful ladies who throw down with high-tech threats. Such physical women have disappeared in the decades since, which is why Metallic Rouge seems like both a throwback and a modern-day successor.




As mentioned, the marketing is making a big deal about the staff brought on board. Chief among them is Yutaka Izubuchi, a mecha designer serving as the anime&#39;s chief director. He last worked with BONES on 2002&#39;s RahXephon. Working alongside him is director Motonobu Hori, screenwriter Toshizo Nemoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, and composer Taisei Iwasaki. It&#39;s an experienced team who&#39;ve all worked on various sci-fi properties before, including Cowboy Bebop. Crunchyroll has officially announced that the show will be available on their stremaing service when it begins airing in January 2024.
