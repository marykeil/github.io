## Literature Review

With Toji potentially facing Megumi and Sukuna facing Jogo, the 16th episode of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 could feature two fierce new battles. 




Toji&#39;s sudden reappearance ahead of Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode 15 was a surprise that set up a showcase of his abilities. Now, episode 16 could answer several questions that were opened up by the events in the previous episode. With so many threads at play, a battle concluded, and still so many foes to face, it&#39;ll be interesting to see which direction the series takes next.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2, Episode 16 Releases 
          

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode 16 will air on Thursday, November 9. In Japan, it will release at its usual midnight hour in Japanese Standard Time. The sub will be available via Crunchyroll&#39;s simulcast at 9am Pacific Time, which is 12pm Eastern time. The episode will be available at 3pm Greenwich Mean Time for British audiences.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode 15? 
          

Episode 15, the thirty-ninth episode in the series, picked up from the previous episode. Titled Fluctuations, Part 2, it recaps Toji&#39;s sudden appearance in Dagon&#39;s domain. He&#39;s still in control of a body after being seÃ¡nced, despite having killed Granny Ogami in Episode 12 of this season. After impressively and rapidly eliminating Dagon, the team is out of the domain, but are not out of danger. Toji isolates Megumi, while Nanami, Naobito, and Maki could be at death&#39;s door thanks to the appearance of Jogo and his fire abilities. The second half focuses on the awakening of Sukuna after Itadori is force-fed eleven fingers. It ultimately ends on a promised battle between Jogo and Sukuna.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode 16 Could Spotlight Sukuna &amp; Toji 
          

With the Dagon plot thread resolved and Megumi suddenly alone with Toji, there is now room to move into other sections of the Shibuya Incident. Itadori is not in control of his body and Sukuna is never hesitant to spill blood. However, the evil sorcerer will either take control of the situation for his own gains, or he&#39;ll be forced to aid Jogo&#39;s current goals. It seems highly unlikely that Sukuna would be forced to be submissive to anyone apart from Yuji&#39;s own resolve to remain in control. While episode 15 served as an intense conclusion to one section and a transitionary entrance to a potential new focus, episode 16 could bring back intense energy with a Sukuna v. Jogo showdown.

Toji&#39;s current aims are still unknown, however, which could be another focus of the next episode. With his current focus on murdering sorcerers, he could put his son, Megumi, at risk. However, he could also have a moment of awakening when faced with his son - who has no idea who he is. The primary question fans are likely left with now is if Megumi&#39;s allies are officially dead by Jogo&#39;s fiery hand - and if he could join that fate at his father&#39;s hands.




Jujutsu Kaisen returns with Season 2 Episode 16 on Crunchyroll Thursday, November 9.
