## Literature Review

After the stunning premiere of its first four episodes, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #5 will show if the anime can maintain its quality.





 What Time Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #5 Releases 
          




Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, October 6. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 6 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 10 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End&#39;s Premiere? 
          

Frieren&#39;s premiere introduced the main characters of the series and established its central themes. The show follows Frieren a nigh immortal elf who seeks to understand humans better after her former friend dies. In the process, she takes on a young girl named Fern as an apprentice and travels the countryside seeking out new spells. At the end of the premiere, Frieren discovers an ancient text by her old mentor Flamme that mentions she can reunite with her dead friends in a land far to the north. This sets her on a journey towards the realm of the Demon King that she helped slay many years prior.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #5 Will Have Frieren Start Her Journey 
          

The revolutionary premiere of Frieren was largely episodic, with Frieren going to a new place and solving a new problem in each of the four episodes released. Episode #5 will likely shift this formula slightly, with Frieren and Fern now having a more solid goal in mind. That being said, as the pair journey north they will likely continue to collect magic and solve problems just as before, preserving the charm of the anime&#39;s initial installment. In the process however, they will likely encounter the red-haired kid in the opening who appears to join them on their quest. Given this will likely happen soon, episode #5 would be a perfect place for this character to be introduced.

Ultimately, however, Frieren can be tragic and compelling no matter what its plot is in a given episode. The show&#39;s characters are its centerpiece and fans will be happy if their interactions remain fun to watch. Episode #5 will be a notable testing point to see if the show can maintain the gorgeous level of quality that it displayed in its premiere. If Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #5 delivers in this aspect it will make the show a firm contender for anime of the year.
