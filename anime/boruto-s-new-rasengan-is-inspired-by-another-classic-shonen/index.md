## Literature Review

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #3 has revealed the power of Rasengan Uzuhiko, and it takes clear inspiration from a classic shonen manga.





The abilities of Rasengan Uzuhiko have finally been revealed in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #3, and it appears to be inspired by JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. It’s unknown if Boruto is explicitly referencing JoJo, but with how uncannily similar Rasengan Uzuhiko is to a specific character’s ability, it’s hard to see it as anything other than deliberate.




          

The inspiration comes from the main character of JoJo Part 7: Steel Ball Run, Johnny Joestar, and the evolved form of his Stand, Tusk. Considering the power unleashed by Tusk&#39;s strongest attack, it gives a good idea of both how powerful a jutsu Rasengan Uzuhiko is and how strong Boruto can be expected to be for the rest of the series.

Rasengan Uzuhiko works by injecting the rotation of the planet into a target and inflicting them with vertigo and continual damage that lasts indefinitely. In Steel Ball Run Johnny Joestar can use Tusk ACT 4, the strongest form of his Stand, to inflict upon someone an “infinite rotation” that makes their bodies twist continuously on a cellular level until they’re destroyed. The overlap between the two abilities is impossible to ignore, so it’s highly likely that Rasengan Uzuhiko was inspired by Tusk ACT 4.




There are some key differences between them, of course. As unlikely as it would be for Code to live that long, Rasengan Uzuhiko can technically be stopped if the planet’s rotation came to a halt, but Tusk ACT 4’s infinite rotation can only be stopped by either cutting off an affected area before it spreads to the entire body or if Johnny, himself, negates it with an infinite rotation in the opposite direction. There are enough differences between them to make them different techniques, but even so, it’s very likely that Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has used JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run as inspiration for its latest development.

With Rasengan Uzuhiko drawing such clear parallels to Tusk ACT 4, that also gives an idea of how strong Boruto will be in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex. Not only does Tusk ACT 4 make Johnny Joestar the most powerful character in Steel Ball Run, but it makes him one of the most powerful characters in the franchise, something emphasized in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven when Johnny was one of the only characters to attack Heaven Ascended DIO. This is based on the fact that Tusk is able to generate the Golden Spin, a state of endless rotation close to the perfection of the Golden Rectangle - a supernatural power in the series based on a real-life geometrical ratio.




If Boruto is taking inspiration from something like that, then it means that readers should expect him to become one of the strongest characters in the series. For reference, Tusk and the Golden Spin can produce infinite energy, and they were able to counter the strongest Stand powers in JoJo, namely President Valentine&#39;s D4C and Diego Brando&#39;s The World. Boruto: Two Blue Vortex drawing such clear inspiration from one of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure’s strongest characters is surely going to hype up fans who can&#39;t wait to see what heights the protagonist will reach in Two Blue Vortex.
