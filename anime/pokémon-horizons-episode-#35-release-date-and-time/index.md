 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

Presently, new episodes of Pokémon Horizons are released on Fridays at 6:55 PM JST, on the Japanese network TVTokyo. Pokémon Horizons will be taking a 2-week break for New Year&#39;s, so Pokémon Horizons episode #35 will be released on January 12, 2024, at 6:55PM JST. That time translates to 1:55 AM Pacific Time, and 4:55 AM Eastern Time, making it an inconvenient or impractical airing time for any Americans who may be attempting to tune in. The episodes, being intended for a Japanese audience, are also broadcast without subtitles, so some understanding of the Japanese language will be necessary to follow the plot. The English dub for Pokémon Horizons has begun debuting on BBC in the UK, while the American release is now set for February 23, 2024.






Pokémon Horizons will be streaming in the US on Netflix.






 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #34? 
          

Pokémon Horizons episode 34 split its focus evenly between the heroes and the villains. Liko and Roy discovered that Liko&#39;s grandmother, Diana, was planning to go her own way and disembark from the airship, and so decided to throw a going-away party for her. They managed to get everyone&#39;s help and were able to put together a meal of curry, along with some cake for dessert, and showed her a video they&#39;d put together of their time on the ship. Diana was moved, and left Liko with her adventurer diary. Meanwhile, Amethio sought to become stronger after his embarrassing defeat at the hands of Rayquaza, and challenged Hamber, butler to the Explorers&#39; leader, Gibeon. Amethio resorted to some desperate strategies that earned Hamber&#39;s respect, leading to him entrusting Amethio with a Tera Orb.






 Pokémon Horizons Episode #35 Returns to Paldea 
          

Seeking further knowledge about Terapagos, the airship returns to Paldea, where ancient rumored sightings of Terapagos occurred. However, the Rising Volt Tacklers still need to pay the bills, so they&#39;ve also taken on a special job battling against Pokémon Hunters (poachers) in the Asado Desert, near Porto Marinada. It will be interesting to see the kind of jobs that the Rising Volt Tacklers take on to make money, which hasn&#39;t really been explored much in the series. The episode looks set to feature some Paldean Pokémon which have not yet appeared in the anime, such as Bramblin.

Pokémon Horizons has entered a pattern of slowly ramping up the story to a climactic moment, then pulling back for a breather after a particularly exciting episode, such as episode #33&#39;s Rayquaza battle. As such, episode #35 is looking like one of these breather episodes, much like the previous. Still, it puts the Rising Volt Tacklers into position to start investigating the mysteries surrounding Terapagos, and a return to Paldea also means popular Paldean characters like Nemona could reappear in the series. Pokémon Horizons may be on break for a few weeks, but its return will mean the start of a new arc.




               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers.

Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
