  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Anime about making anime and manga explore the challenges and frustrations of the industry, highlighting both the appealing and dark sides of the profession.

These anime offer a range of perspectives, from the technical aspects of production to the struggles of voice actors and the creative process behind manga. They provide both informative and entertaining stories.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The anime industry itself is presented as challenging yet rewarding in anime such as Shirobako and Comic Party.</p>
<p>The anime industry is notoriously difficult to break into, but with anime being as popular as it is, it&rsquo;s no wonder there are some incredible anime about making anime and manga. From writers to voice actors, anime is an appealing yet demanding career, and many artists express their frustrations with the industry through their art, creating anime that explores the light and dark sides of the profession.
Many anime explore the difficulties that its animators, directors, producers, and voice actors go through to make their art, but some do it better than others. Some use a light-hearted tone to present the processes as appealingly as possible, but others go hard on the darker side of things, warning newcomers and fans that the industry is not all sunshine and roses.</p>
<p>15  Shirobako
Original Anime Series Created By P.A. Works</p>
<p>Year Released   2014    Episode Count   24    Where to Stream it   Spectrum <br>
Shirobako is a great female-led anime that follows a group of students who promise to work together on an anime one day after they graduate, and despite the difficulties they encounter after entering the industry, they all remain resolute in their goals. Shirobako follows the production of two types of anime, an original series and a manga adaptation, and it has received a lot of praise for its depiction of the harsh realities of working in the anime industry while still managing to put a positive spin on everything.</p>
<p>14  Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!
Based on the Manga Created By Sumito Ōwara</p>
<p>Year Released   2020    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! follows three girls as they try to create short animated films despite the opposition from their school, peers, and parents. The series uses the surrealism of both its writing and its direction courtesy of Science SARU to paint an imaginative and visually creative series, and with its focus on the difficulties of amateur production as opposed to professionals already in the industry, Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! ends up being one of the more unique anime about making anime because of its wild visuals and creative use of animation.</p>
<p>13  Animation Runner Kuromi
Original Anime Series Created By The Yumeta Company</p>
<p>Year Released   2001    Episode Count   2    Where to Stream it   Unavailable on streaming <br>
On the opposite end of the spectrum to Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!, one of the older anime about making anime is Animation Runner Kuromi. Animation Runner Kuromi is an OVA series that&rsquo;s focused more on the technical side of anime production, and with its parody angle, it does a great job of satirizing the practices of the anime industry and how taxing it can be on everyone involved. The OVAs came out in the early 2000s, so a lot of things about the industry have undoubtedly changed, but it&rsquo;s still a humorous and informative look into the industry, regardless.</p>
<p>12  Bakuman
Based on the Manga Created By Tsugumi Ohba &amp; Takeshi Obata</p>
<p>Year Released   2010    Episode Count   75    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Peacock, Tubi <br>
There are plenty of great anime about making manga, as well, and one of the best to watch is Bakuman. Artist Mashiro and writer Takagi attempt to publish a manga together, battling their personal insecurities as well as Mashiro&rsquo;s fear of overworking. Overworking is a serious problem in the creative industry, and Bakuman explores the topic delicately, examining why manga takes such a long time to make and why creators sometimes have to take hiatuses. The story is heartfelt and sincere, with two friends teaming up to create something they can be proud of while sticking to their principles. They also team up with Azuki, an aspiring voice actress, whom Mashiro promises to marry once their manga becomes popular enough to get an anime adaptation.
Fans might recognize Bakuman creators Tsugumi Ohba &amp; Takeshi Obata, as they were the duo who created Death Note!</p>
<p>11  Kakushigoto: My Dad&rsquo;s Secret Ambition
Based on the Manga Created By Kōji Kumeta</p>
<p>Year Released   2020    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation <br>
With the framing device of protagonist Kakushi not wanting his daughter to know that he draws fanservice-laden manga, Kakushigoto tells a story that alternates between the wholesomeness of Kakushi&rsquo;s relationship with his daughter and the humor of its creative ways of poking fun at the manga industry, whether it&rsquo;s making fun of the technical aspects or making fun of the creators, themselves. As one of the most heartwarming anime of 2020, Kakushigoto is a favorite with fans and critics alike. The series was created by Koji Kumeta of Joshiraku and Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei fame, so anyone familiar with those stories can expect the same quality writing to be found here.</p>
<p>10  Comic Party
Based on the Video Game Created By Studio Leaf</p>
<p>Year Released   2001    Episode Count   13    Where to Stream it   Unavailable on streaming <br>
When it comes to the fan side of manga production, one of the best anime to depict that is Comic Party. Based on the dating sim of the same name, Comic Party follows Kazuki as he attempts to create and sell doujinshi, self-published manga typically sold at Comiket and other anime conventions in Japan. In addition to being a good look into the production of fanworks versus professional works, Comic Party is also a great examination of the struggles of the creative process and how far natural talent can take a person, so it has a lot to offer for even people who might not be interested in fan works. As a great anime based on a videogame, this is one series that fans of manga production should check out.</p>
<p>9  Dojin Work
Based on the Manga Created By Hiroyuki</p>
<p>Year Released   2004    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   Unavailable on streaming <br>
Another great anime specifically about doujinshi for people to watch is Dojin Work. Like Comic Party, Dojin Work focuses on the work that goes into producing fanworks, and it also does a good job of showing how something like that can be very profitable if you put in enough effort. There are a lot of jokes that might come off as inappropriate or offensive, but they don&rsquo;t happen enough to detract from its comedic story and quirky cast of characters, and seeing as how it&rsquo;s by the creator of Girlfriend, Girlfriend, people can expect to find that same level of comedy writing here in full force.</p>
<p>8  Seiyu&rsquo;s Life!
Based on the Manga Created By Masumi Asano &amp; Kenjiro Hata</p>
<p>Year Released   2015    Episode Count   13 + 1 OVA    Where to Stream it   Funimation <br>
Voice acting is, naturally, one of the core aspects of anime production, and an anime that does a great job of exploring it is Seiyu&rsquo;s Life! The series is about three newcomer voice actresses — Futaba, Ichigo, and Rin — who struggle to make it in the world of anime voice acting. Finding little success and limited roles, the three friends start a radio show to boost their popularity.
Many voice actors deserve more credit for their work, and this show delves into exactly why that is. From the first frame of the show, the actors are shown doing their best to work while dealing with demanding producers and competition from much more famous actors. The characters are cute, and the story endears the audience to them, making them easy to root for.
Series creator Masumi Asano is actually a voice actor herself, having appeared in series like One Piece and Dragon Ball Super!</p>
<p>7  Girlish Number
Based on the Serial Novel Created By Wataru Watari</p>
<p>Year Released   2016    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   HiDive <br>
Another great anime specifically about voice acting is Girlish Number. Chitose is an overly confident voice actress who blames the industry for her lack of fame until she gets a role in an idol anime alongside four other actresses. Chitose is self-absorbed and wants recognition, at one point imagining herself on a red carpet surrounded by adoring fans, and often acts badly to her peers due to her cunning and brash nature. Girlish Number does not pull its punches when it comes to examining the anime industry, and it often brings up the darker side of it, presenting the producers and directors of Chitose&rsquo;s show as meddling and greedy people who will bully their workers into doing as they are told.</p>
<p>10 Best Idol Anime Series
From grounded tales of friendship and drama, to supernatural ones with a comedic twist, the world of idol anime offers a surprising amount of variety.</p>
<p>6  I&rsquo;m Glad I Could Keep Running</p>
<p>Year Released   2018    Episode Count   4    Where to Stream it   Unavailable on streaming <br>
If someone wanted to watch an anime about voice acting that didn&rsquo;t have the gimmick of the &ldquo;cute girls doing cute things&rdquo; genre of anime, a great anime to watch is I&rsquo;m Glad I Could Keep Running. As with other great anime about making anime, I&rsquo;m Glad I Could Keep Running focuses heavily on the struggles of being in the voice acting industry, with a specific being drawn to how personal issues can impact someone&rsquo;s work and how important it is to try and move past personal trauma. The series only has four episodes, but even that&rsquo;s enough to depict a story that&rsquo;s as informative as it is heartwarming.</p>
<p>5  Comic Girls
Based on the Manga Created By Kaori Hanzawa</p>
<p>Year Released   2018    Episode Count      Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
On the lighter side of things, a great anime centered around making manga is Nexus&rsquo; Comic Girls. Comic Girls frames its exploration of the process behind creating manga around the typical &ldquo;cute girls doing cute things&rdquo; style of slice-of-life anime, so there&rsquo;s more of a focus on comedic hijinks than the creative process, especially compared to anime that are more about the process of creation. Even so, the series still does a good job of exploring the creative process and how some creators are forced to make things outside their personal interests to survive, so it still ends up having a lot to offer people.</p>
<p>4  A Galaxy Next Door
Based on the Manga Created By Gido Amagakure</p>
<p>Year Released   2023    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll <br>
Nothing says that an anime about making anime or manga has to be completely grounded, and a perfect example of that is A Galaxy Next Door. The series adds a sci-fi twist to its narrative by making its female lead, Shiori, an alien, but it still succeeds at showcasing the varying aspects of manga creation, most notably the financial burden being in the business can cause if a creator isn&rsquo;t successful right off the bat. More than that, however, A Galaxy Next Door is a charming love story between its two leads, so even if someone isn&rsquo;t interested in the manga process, they&rsquo;re still likely to find something to enjoy.</p>
<p>3  The Pet Girl Of Sakurasou
Based on the Light Novel Created By Hajime Kamoshida</p>
<p>Year Released   2012    Episode Count   24    Where to Stream it   HiDive <br>
Another great anime about making manga with a focus on romance is The Pet Girl of Sakurasou. Female lead Mashiro struggles to learn how to draw manga after spending years as a painter, and through that, the series not only does a good job of exploring the challenges of making manga but the difficulties that arise from trying to go from one medium to another. The focus on romance between the various characters, most notably between Sorata and Mashiro, also adds a lot of charm to the series, and while it might not be very deep, there&rsquo;s a lot to enjoy from it, either way.</p>
<p>2  Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi: The World&rsquo;s Greatest First Love
Based on the Manga Created By Shungiku Nakamura</p>
<p>Year Released   2011    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Funimation <br>
For anyone who might want to see LGBTQ+ representation in an anime about making manga, a great series to watch is Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi: The World&rsquo;s Greatest First Love. The series is focused primarily on the editors in charge of manga, but an equally important part of the series is the various relationship dramas the characters end up involved in. The heartfelt nature of the romance adds a lot of charm to the series, and it being a yaoi anime also makes it a great source of representation, so even if someone isn&rsquo;t interested in the exploration of manga editing, they&rsquo;re still bound to get a lot out of it.</p>
<p>The 10 Best LGBTQ+ Characters From Anime &amp; Manga
There have been countless LGBTQ and queer coded characters in anime and manga over the years. Here are the ten best according to ScreenRant!</p>
<p>1  Monthly Girls&rsquo; Nozaki-Kun
Based on the Manga Created By Izumi Tsubaki</p>
<p>Year Released   2014    Episode Count   12    Where to Stream it   HiDive <br>
The best anime about making manga is Monthly Girls&rsquo; Nozaki-kun. Monthly Girls&rsquo; Nozaki-kun follows the creative process of writing manga under the framing device of a girl trying to get closer to her crush, and as that would imply, the series is filled with wacky hijinks for both the romance elements and the elements surrounding Nozaki&rsquo;s creative process. The story is both heartfelt with its romance and informative with its commentary on creating manga, so regardless of what someone might be into, there&rsquo;s plenty of material in Monthly Girls&rsquo; Nozaki-kun for people to get invested in.
There are many great stories centered around the creative process behind making stories, and anime and manga are no different. As this list shows, there are a lot of great anime about the creative process behind anime and manga that stand out not just for how informative they are, but for how entertaining a story they&rsquo;re able to craft surrounding that, as well. It&rsquo;s not the kind of subject that will always be interesting, but it&rsquo;s clear that there are plenty of anime about making anime and manga that more than succeed at doing just that, and that won&rsquo;t be stopping anytime soon.</p>
