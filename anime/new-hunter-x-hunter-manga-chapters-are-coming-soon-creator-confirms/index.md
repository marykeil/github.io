## Literature Review

Hunter X Hunter fans worried about another record-long hiatus can rest easy because the manga&#39;s author has confirmed that new chapters are coming.





Togashi&#39;s work on manga like Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter X Hunter has grown a considerable fanbase worldwide. Fears of another long Hunter X Hunter hiatus have been quelled and the fanbase collectively breathed a sigh of relief on October 1st when Yoshihiro Togashi posted an update on X that he was returning to work. The post read &#34;Start over&#34; with an image featuring a ruler and paper being used to format what&#39;s most likely the beginnings of a manga page for new chapters of Hunter X Hunter. Togashi famously gained over 1.6 million followers on the social media platform when he joined it in May 2022 to announce that new chapters were coming, the same way he&#39;s done now.




                  Hunter X Hunter&#39;s Creator Confirmed The Series’ Return - So Where is It?   Yoshihiro Togashi announces that a new Hunter x Hunter chapter is ready and that he is working on a new “production system” to guarantee publication.

After almost a four-year hiatus, Hunter X Hunter&#39;s author released chapter #391 in October 2022. Even with such a long wait, it shows how dedicated Togashi&#39;s fans are by how many followers he gained after posting only vague and rough sketches that often only include the corners of the formatting paper the longtime manga artists use. Ten new chapters were released, with #400 coming out in December 2022. Fans were overjoyed by the glorious return of Togashi&#39;s unique art style and clever writing that&#39;s hard to find anywhere else. However, any hope for a regular serialization were crushed with the confirmation that Togashi&#39;s health still prevents him from working full time.




The frequent HxH hiatus is extra frustrating for readers because its story is currently in the middle of a fascinating arc called the &#34;Succession War.&#34; In a series filled with exciting battles, intricate superpowers, and gruesome creatures, the latest manga arc has its hooks in the attention as fan-favorite character Kurapika is thrust into a deranged political death match. Fourteen princes and hundreds of passengers are stuck on a huge ship destined fo the mysterious, deadly Dark Continent. The notorious Phantom Troupe entering the fray added even more layers of intrigue and suspense to the arc fans are excited to see continue.

This is not the first update HxH readers have received regarding the release of new chapters. Immediately after the start of the latest hiatus, Togashi and his team confirmed that work would continue, perhaps with a new system that would put most of the burden on Togashi&#39;s assistants, letting him focus on writing. While details remained vague, this latest update means that progress on the series is being made. It took five months for #391 to be released after Togashi first posted about his return to the manga, meaning that fans of Hunter X Hunter can hopefulyl look forward to the next chapters coming in 2024.
