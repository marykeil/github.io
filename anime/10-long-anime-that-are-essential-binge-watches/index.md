## Literature Review

Long anime tend to spend more time on worldbuilding and developing their characters, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in their stories.




Any anime fan knows the disappointment of being completely captivated by a show, only for it to end too soon. Thankfully, when it comes to long anime, such a concern is unwarranted, as there are plenty of story developments, characters, and worldbuilding elements to ensure fans can fully immerse themselves and continue to engage with the shows for as long as they&#39;d like.
There is no set formula for what a good long anime looks like. From the classic shonen titles that played a significant part in many an anime fan&#39;s childhood, to more recent hits that either emulate those experiences or take a completely different approach, long anime come in many forms. However, regardless of their genre or demographic, they allow viewers to feel a real sense of belonging and adventure, making for worthwhile bingeworthy experiences.









 








 10  Legend of the Galactic Heroes (110 Episodes)

The story follows the ongoing interstellar war between the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance, a seemingly unending conflict that has taken its toll on numerous soldiers and spaceships alike.

 9  D.Gray-man (116 Episodes) 
Produced by TMS Entertainment and Based on the Manga by Katsura Hoshino


 







The events of D.Gray-man are set in a world threatened by the enigmatic Millennium Earl, who targets humans at their most fragileâ€”when they are mourning the loss of a loved one. With the apparent goal of plunging the world into darkness, he takes the souls of the dead and turns them into Akuma, thereafter using them as obedient weapons against humanity. The only ones who can stand up against this threat are the exorcists of the religious Black Order. On the surface, D.Gray-man may not seem too distinct from other typical action-oriented shonen, but it eventually reveals itself to be much deeper and more compelling than one would assume.

 6  Sailor Moon (203 Episodes) 
Produced by Toei Animation and Based on the Manga by Naoko Takeuchi
        

Acting as many people&#39;s introduction to the anime medium, as well as to the concept of magical girls, the Sailor Moon franchise more than earned its place as one of the classics. The story revolves around Usagi Tsukino, a seemingly average albeit slightly immature girl whose life is changed completely by a fateful encounter with Luna, a cat with a crescent moon on her head. This is how Usagi learns that she is destined to become Sailor Moon and protect the earth along with the other Sailor Guardians. While some may find it repetitive, Sailor Moon is simple yet simultaneously complex enough to captivate and entertain any viewer.

 1  Hunter x Hunter (148 Episodes) 
Produced by Madhouse and Based on the Manga by Yoshihiro Togashi


 







In the world of Hunter x Hunter, the titular Hunters are licensed professionals who have proven themselves capable of going after the world&#39;s most dangerous threats and best-hidden treasures. However, while the title of a Hunter is highly coveted, few obtain it due to the difficulty of passing the Hunter Examination. Still, for Gon Freecss, Killua Zoldyck, and others like them, the risk of dying outweighs the importance of their respective goals. A decidedly darker take on the classic shonen formula, Hunter x Hunter remains one of the best action-adventure shows for anyone seeking a vast fantastical world to dive into.
