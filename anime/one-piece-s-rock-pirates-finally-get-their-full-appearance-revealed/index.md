## Literature Review

One Piece has finally revealed more of the Rocks Pirates and the crew has some unexpected members many of whom Luffy has already met.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Chapter #1096 of One Piece.One Piece has done the unexpected yet again, giving fans exactly what they desire with the latest chapter continuing the highly anticipated God Valley flashback and finally revealing the full appearance of the Rocks Pirates. Having said that, in classic One Piece fashion, the latest chapter teases the appearance of nearly every known crew member as well as some interesting new additions, all except for the captain himself, Rocks D. Xebec.




Chapter #1096 of One Piece finally gives fans a better glimpse into the fated God Valley Incident and the events leading up to it, revealing that the news leaked by Ginny about the rare devil fruits present on God Valley, among which are Kuma&#39;s Paw Paw Fruit and Kaido&#39;s Fish Fish Fruit, were indeed the reason the Rocks Pirates were drawn to God Valley.

          

As the Rocks Pirates make landfall and charge the island, the chapter gives fans a full, unobscured view of the crew for the first time in the series and with it many shocking revelations.

Chapter #1096 reveals the young appearance of several Rocks Pirates during the God Valley Incident including Big Mom, Kaido, Shiki, and Whitebeard, and also introduces several new members including Gloriosa, the former Empress of Amazon Lilly also known as Elder Nyon. The chapter also reveals the appearance of Captain John who thus far has only made an appearance in zombie form, and a young Buckingham Stussy who is the spitting image of her clone and appears to be clinging to Whitebeard&#39;s back.

Most notably, Rocks does not appear except for a single speech bubble proving his presence as he charges ahead of the crew. Shakky is also nowhere to be seen despite popular theories about her having been a member of Rocks&#39; crew. The identities of Silver Axe, and Ochoku continue to be a mystery though one can assume they are the shadowy figures pictured at the bottom left and middle.

One of the shadowed figures in Chapter #1096 bears a strong resemblance to one of the zombies on Gecko Moria&#39;s crew popularly believed to be Ochoku due to his rather oriental appearance and long beard. However, recent information presented in Chapter #1059 suggests this may not be the case as Ochoku was defeated by Blackbeard at some point during the two-year time-skip making it impossible for his corpse to have been in Moria&#39;s possession years prior.

Having said that, Moria may have certainly had more than Captain John&#39;s corpse at his disposal. The leaping figure to Whitebeard&#39;s right is strikingly similar to another zombie Luffy and the Straw Hats encountered on Thriller Bark that had similar claws for weapons, suggesting Moria may have had three of the Rocks Pirates&#39; bodies as his puppets in all. This would also mean that Luffy may have already met three members of the legendary crew as early as Chapter #452.

All the same, the intrigue surrounding the Rocks Pirates only continues to deepen with every passing chapter and the recent revelations have left fans on the edge of their seats left with only more questions than before. Fortunately, One Piece seems dedicated to finally unraveling the mystery and fans can only hope that the series will reveal all in due time including the identity of the mysterious Rocks D. Xebec.
