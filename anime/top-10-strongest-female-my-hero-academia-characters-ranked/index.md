## Literature Review

Through training their quirks and developing skills to combat their weaknesses, these ladies have earned their spot as the strongest fighters in MHA. 




My Hero Academia has some of the strongest female characters in Shonen anime. This makes sense given the very premise of the world created by mangaka Kohei Horikoshi empowers pretty much every character, even ones often overlooked by other series. However, this large amount of powerful female characters makes it somewhat difficult to rank exactly which ones are the strongest.
While My Hero Academia does have an official Pro Hero ranking system, many of its strongest female characters aren&#39;t actually pro heroes, and the rankings take into account not just power but other &#34;hero skills&#34;. In addition, many of these characters are still growing and becoming stronger, which means their rankings have the potential to shift over time. The Final War arc highlights this well, as it gives a spotlight to many of My Hero Academia&#39;s forgotten and overlooked characters, showing they are stronger than many fans realized.









 








 10  Momo Yaoyorozu - &#34;Creati&#34; 
Quirk: Creation
        

Nicknamed &#34;Yaomomo&#34; by her classmates, Momo is the class Vice President and earned her way into U.A. through recommendations, bypassing the entrance exam that the majority of students are required to take. Momo is an extremely diligent student and often acts as the peacekeeper for her class in her attempt to improve her leadership abilities.
With her Quirk, Create, Momo utilizes her outstanding memory and intelligence to endlessly reproduce any object she can imagine, with the only limitations being her stamina, how much she&#39;s eaten, and her knowledge of the object itself. If Momo continues to refine her quirk and hand-to-hand combat abilities, she could become one of My Hero Academia&#39;s highest-ranked heroes.





 9  Nejire Hado - &#34;Nejire Chan&#34; 
Quirk: Wave Motion
        

Nejire is a 3rd-year student in U.A.&#39;s Hero Course and is one of the star students alongside Mirio Togata (LeMillion), and Tamaki Amajiki (Suneater) who have been dubbed The Big 3. Despite her exceptional abilities and talent, Nejire has never begrudged helping her underclassmen and has been their mentor when the younger students required her aide. Nejire&#39;s mastery over her Quirk, Wave Motion, has earned her recognition as being stronger than most pro heroes.
Through Wave Motion, Nejire developed the ability to levitate and fly, defend herself, and defeat multiple enemies simultaneously by increasing the power of her waves and expanding their reach. While her Waves are somewhat slow, she packs a massive punch and deserves to be ranked among the most powerful of My Hero Academia&#39;s female characters.





 8  Nemuri Kayama - &#34;Midnight&#34; 
Quirk: Somnambulist
        

Nemuri Kamaya, the R-Rated Hero Midnight, is a famous professional Hero who became an instructor at U.A. Highschool. It is later revealed in the incredibly underrated spinoff My Hero Academia Vigilantes that becoming a teacher had long been her aspiration. Midnight&#39;s Quirk Somnambulist, which puts people to sleep by inhaling her body&#39;s aroma, was essential in her hero&#39;s work to subdue and capture enemies.
Though the affected area is small, she can spread the scent over greater distances with her whip and fans, doubling her ability to immobilize and capture her enemies. This powerful Quirk along with her experience as a Pro Hero ranks her among the strongest female characters in the series.





 7  Rumi Usagiyama - &#34;Rabbit Hero: Mirko&#34; 
Quirk: Rabbit
        

Mirko the Rabbit Hero, briefly known as Tiger Bunny, is the No. 5 ranked pro hero in My Hero Academia and is well-known for her brash personality. Mirko primarily works alone, believing that teams cause heroes to rely on the strength of others rather than their own, and fearlessly fights villains and crime singlehandedly.
Mirko received superhuman physical abilities from her Quirk, Rabbit, which gives her exceptional jumping and kicking abilities, as well as overwhelming speed. Even after losing multiple limbs in the Hero-Villain War, her diligent martial arts training aided in her quick and inspiring comeback into hero society with her prosthetic limbs.





 6  Kaina Tsutsumi - &#34;Lady Nagant&#34; 
Quirk: Rifle
        

Lady Nagant is a former pro hero who grew disillusioned with her &#34;hero&#34; role when the Hero Public Safety Commission (HPSC) used her abilities to act as an assassin. After killing the HPSC Chief, in a flash-back that proves she is one of My Hero Academia&#39;s most tragic villains, she was imprisoned in Tartarus until she was released by All for One to continue her hunt for heroes.
Lady Nagant&#39;s Quirk Rifle allows her to transform her arm into a large rifle and craft bullets by manipulating her hair. When bestowed the ability Air Walk by All For One, which allowed her to secure a foothold anywhere, she very nearly defeated Deku, even after he used his Full Cowl at full strength, showing she deserves to be ranked among the series&#39; strongest female characters.





 5  Himiko Toga 
Quirk: Transform


 







Himiko Toga&#39;s twisted personality revolves around stealing the blood of those she loves and transforming into them with her Quirk. The most recent arc of the manga has shown her terrifying potential by having Toga awaken her Quirk and becoming able to mimick also powers besides appearances, using Twice&#39;s Sad Man Parade to wreak absolute havoc on the battlefield. The only catch is that Toga has to feel love for the person she imitates, which further highlights how sadly tragic her ability and personality are.
While Toga was defeated and apparently gave her life to save Uraraka in an ultimate act of redemption, the potential of her Quirk to fully evolve and make her able to imitate even the strongest powers - such as All for One - make her one of the most impressive women in the series.





 4  Uraraka Ochako - &#34;Uravity&#34; 
Quirk: Zero Gravity


 







Ochako&#39;s Quirk may not seem as strong as many of the others ranked on this list, but recent developments in the manga have changed this quite drastically. Uraraka&#39;s Quirk enables her to remove the gravity of any object she touches as well as of herself. In the Final War arc of the manga, Uraraka actually awakened this Quirk similar to how Shigaraki awakened his, and now her power can spread by touch through any object she has affected. This makes it incredibly easy for her to incapacitate large crowds of enemies and increases the potential of her strength quite a bit.





 3  Nana Shimura 
Quirk: Float
        

Nana Shimura is the former partner of Gran Torino and was also the mentor and teacher of Toshinori Yagi a.k.a. All Might. She is the previous wielder of One For All before she passed on the Quirk to All Might and unfortunately lost her life fighting against One For All. As the possessor of One For All, Nana possessed extreme physical abilities similar, if not greater than All Might himself, including, but not limited to superhuman speed, endurance, strength, and durability. Nana also most likely had access to the Quirks of previous OFA holders, as well as her natural Quirk Float, which gave her the ability to fly.





 2  Cathleen Bate - &#34;Star And Stripe&#34; 
Quirk: New Order
        

Cathleen Bate was the No.1 Ranked American Hero, whose name Star and Stripe were heavily inspired by the imagery of The American Flag. Her inspiration to become a hero came from her fascination and respect for All Might, who worked as a professional hero in America when she was a young child. Cathleen was summoned to Japan to fight against Shigaraki in place of the now-retired All Might, as Star and Stripe was known to have strength close to All Might&#39;s.
With her Quirk New Order, as long as she touched the object, she could impose rules on any substance and manipulate it at her discretion. By using one of those rules on herself, she gained superhuman abilities with everything around her being her weapon, making her one of the strongest characters in the series.





 1  Eri 
Quirk: Rewind


 







Eri is the granddaughter of the Shie Hassaikai&#39;s boss, though she spent the majority of her time locked up by the now disgraced My Hero Academia villain Kai Chisaki when he was not performing experiments to harness and manipulate her Quirk. While Eri is still a young child with hardly any control over her Quirk, Rewind, the raw power of her Quirk is beyond anything previously seen.
At a young age, she accidentally completely erased her father from existence by rewinding his time to before he was born, and during the fight between Deku and Overhaul, she was able to rewind and &#34;heal&#34; Deku continuously when he used One For All at full power when normally it would have destroyed his body. With her future looking bright under the tutelage of Deku, Mirio, and Eraserhead, should Eri choose to, she could easily become the strongest Quirk user in existence.
The female characters ranked on this list outclass many of My Hero Academia&#39;s male characters in terms of strength, which is something that is rare in many other Shonen series. This shows the great potential of My Hero Academia&#39;s power system to feature heroes that deviate from the standard heroes seen in other anime and manga. Ranking these incredibly strong female characters also proves that My Hero Academia has one of the most powerful casts of characters of any Shonen series.
My Hero Academia is available from Hulu, Funimation, and Crunchyroll.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
