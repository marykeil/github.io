## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons episode #34 draws the latest arc to a peaceful close with a going away party for Liko&#39;s grandmother, following the epic showdown between Amethio and the Black Rayquaza in episode #33. Here&#39;s how fans can tune in and find out what happens next for the Rising Volt Tacklers.





 When Do Pokémon Horizons Episodes Release? 
          

New episodes of Pokémon Horizons currently debut on the Japanese network TVTokyo each Friday, at 6:55 PM JST. Episode #34 of Pokémon Horizons will air December 22, 2023, at 6:55 PM JST. That time translates to 1:55 AM Pacific Time, and 4:55 PM Eastern Time, making it an inconvenient airing time for Americans, to say the least. Being intended for Japanese audiences, these airings are also without any form of subtitles, meaning some knowledge of Japanese is necessary to follow the plot. The English dub for Pokémon Horizons has begun debuting on BBC in the UK, while the American release is now set for February 23, 2024.



Netflix will be the streaming home for Pokémon Horizons in the US.









 What Happened in Pokémon Horizons Episode #33? 
          

After convincing Lapras to join them in episode #32, the Black Rayquaza made an appearance over the airship. As it turns out, Amethio of the Explorers was tracking it, and when it showed itself, he came out of his submarine to fight it. Using both his Corviknight and Ceruledge, Amethio battled against Rayquaza, which didn&#39;t hold back, unleashing dangerous blasts of draconic energy. Rayquaza&#39;s strength proved to be too much, however, and after defeating Amethio, it turned its attention to the airship, with Roy now challenging it. Rayquaza&#39;s haphazard attacks posed a threat to everyone, and as Liko pushed Roy out of the way of one blast, Terapagos stepped in to protect her in turn, taking on its true form for the first time. Terapagos couldn&#39;t hold it for long, however, and after it transformed back, Rayquaza left.






 Pokémon Horizons Episode #34 Sees Off Liko&#39;s Grandmother 
          

The airship has had an extra passenger aboard for this Lapras arc: Liko&#39;s grandmother, Diana, an adventurer in her own right. However, after witnessing the Black Rayquaza&#39;s power, her desire to adventure was rekindled, and she decided to go off on her own to continue investigating the Explorers independently. Diana has added an interesting new element to the mix in these past few episodes, so it&#39;s a bit of a shame to see her go so soon. As Diana recognizes, though, it&#39;s necessary for Liko to learn to handle these situations on her own in order to become a capable trainer and person, and she can&#39;t do that with her capable grandmother so nearby.

Saying goodbye to Diana seems to be the main focus of episode #34, a bit of a breather after the intensity of Black Rayquaza. It&#39;s surely not the last fans will see of her, though it may be a while before her return. The crew will also have to decide which of the remaining Six Heroes they intend to go for next: Kleavor or Entei. This may take the Rising Volt Tacklers to the far side of the world once again, as they chase rumors and legends that could lead to these ancient Pokémon. Future episodes of Pokémon Horizons will soon reveal their next destination, and fans surely can&#39;t wait to find out.
