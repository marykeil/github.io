## Literature Review

A cosplayer proves that Dio&#39;s over-the-top nature makes him one of the most iconic and entertaining villains in anime â€“ and even more fun to cosplay.




Dio Brando has proven time and time again how he&#39;s one of the most despicable antagonists from Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure. In a recent Reddit post shared by u/Appropriate-Movie145, the vampire lord is reimagined as &#34;fem Dio Brando&#34; in his most memorable outfit from the series. The mind-blowing cosplay shows how twisted the villain truly is.




          

Crediting the photography to a.elizabethphotos, Appropriate-Movie145 recreates several of Dio&#39;s poses from his climactic battle against Jotaro Kujo. They are shown posing on the stairs of a classical-looking building, similar to those found in the story&#39;s unique setting of Egypt. The cosplayer then bears their fangs in a sinister grin while holding up a traffic sign, paying tribute to a specific scene where Dio tries to use the object against his opponent.


 

Just like the famous villain, Appropriate-Movie145 manages to appear both menacing and whimsical at the same time.





 Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure&#39;s Dio Cosplay Shows Why Fans Continue to Love Him 
Produced by David Production and based on the original manga by Hirohiko Araki
          

A recurring antagonist in the series, Dio Brando first appears in Phantom Blood as a young boy adopted by George Joestar and raised alongside his son, Jonathan. Dio&#39;s lust for power leads him to become a vampire, causing him to kill his adoptive brother and steal his body. While his hatred for the Joestar bloodline is a major aspect of his character, he only appears as the main antagonist in Part 1, Phantom Blood, and Part 3, Stardust Crusaders, but acts as a primary antagonist in Part 6, Stone Ocean. Acting as a foil to Jonathan Joestar, he has since become one of the most recognizable faces from Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure.

                  JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure First Protagonist Is Actually Its Biggest Villain   While Jonathan Joestar may be the titular protagonist of Phantom Blood, it was in fact him, Dio, who played the role of the real main character.   




Appropriate-Movie145&#39;s cosplay highlights Dio&#39;s most entertaining qualities and reminds fans why they love to hate him. Described by Robert E.O. Speedwagon as &#34;pure evil&#34;, his unapologetically wicked nature makes him one of anime&#39;s most irredeemable villains. As the cause of the Joestar family&#39;s misfortunes, he continues to torment them for years after his death, and is indirectly responsible for the events in Stone Ocean. Apart from his difficult childhood, he is an otherwise unsympathetic character due to his ruthless disposition and lack of conscience, including his mistreatment of animals. However, these traits, when coupled with his intelligence and powerful Stand, make him a compelling villain.

After the original universe is rebooted in Steel Ball Run, Johnny Joestar and Diego Brando become the alternate universe counterparts of Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, respectively. Unlike Phantom Blood, which draws a clear distinction between good and evil, part 7 breaks tradition with a morally gray story and characters. While Diego shares some attributes with his predecessor, his characterization is more complex, and many of his actions can even be justified. However, it&#39;s Dio&#39;s classic, unhinged villainy that makes him so enjoyable to watch. Appropriate-Movie145 reminds fans of this fact and shows them why Dio Brando continues to be one of the most unforgettable characters from Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure.
