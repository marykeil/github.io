 What Happened In Solo Leveling Episode #1? 
          

The first episode was a great start to the series, showing just how much care went into its realization. It saw the introduction of the main character Sung Jinwoo, who is known as the world&#39;s weakest hunter. In a world where dungeons mysteriously started popping up, with beasts inside immune to human weaponry, people with magical powers called hunters were born, and they conquered these dungeons to use the resources to advance humanity. With his mother sick and his sister about to go to college, Sung Jinwoo persists in being a hunter despite being too weak for even the simplest dungeons, to take care of his family.




In the first episode, together with other hunters, Jinwoo entered a D-Level dungeon. Although he was injured by a weak goblin, he was healed by Joohee, and it was smooth sailing afterward. The group journeyed deeper into the dungeon to look for more loot, and they entered a room with huge statues. Their luck ran out, as the door shut behind them and these statues started killing them. Knowing that there was no escape, and they were severely outmatched and outnumbered, Sung Jinwoo panicked and realized that he was about to die.

With no way to defeat or escape these murderous statues, how Jinwoo will escape is still unknown, but he is going to come back very different than he previously was. With new-found strength and a way to power up, a new and exciting journey is about to unfold for the weakest hunter of mankind as he looks to survive in a dangerous profession. Solo Leveling has incredible potential to be one of the biggest anime of 2024, and this is only possible because of the innovative plot that incorporates isekai into the real world.
