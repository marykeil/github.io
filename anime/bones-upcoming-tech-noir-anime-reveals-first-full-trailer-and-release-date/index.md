Metallic Rouge is a collaboration between Studio BONES and producer Yutaka Izubuchi, the character designer of the Evangelion movies. Hori Motonobu, an experienced animator who&#39;s worked on My Hero Academia, Psycho-Pass, and Sword Art Online, will take the helm and direct the anime. Toshizou Nemoto will be in charge of the script, and considering that he wrote the script for multiple episodes of Steins Gate, a series praised for its story, Metallic Rouge is in great hands. Furthermore, the sound director of Your Name and Suzume Haru Yamada will oversee the sound design.




The cast is packed, with popular voice actors such as Kenjiro Tsuda (Nanami from Jujutsu Kaisen, Kishibe from Chainsaw Man) voicing Afdar Bashar. Tomoyo Kurosawa, the voice actor of Rebecca from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, will voice Naomi, one of the protagonists. Metallic Rouge will feature two female protagonists, Rouge and Naomi, who are both sent on a mission to eliminate hostiles on Mars who threaten the government&#39;s power. In the trailer, it is shown that there is more to the mission than thought, and the two will have to make hard decisions after learning the truth.


 

This series is being made to celebrate the studio&#39;s 25 years in business. Studio BONES has had a great impact on the anime and manga industry, and many of their anime are hailed as some of the best and most popular. As the fall 2023 season ends, a new season is ushered in with incredible anime, and Metallic Rouge is one of the most anticipated anime of winter 2024. Coming from the studio behind masterpieces such as Mob Psycho 100, Metallic Rouge is already a must-watch.
