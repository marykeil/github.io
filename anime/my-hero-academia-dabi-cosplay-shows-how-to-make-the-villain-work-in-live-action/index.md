## Literature Review

My Hero Academia&#39;s Dabi is a villain who doesn&#39;t change his look often, with his all-white costume finally getting the cosplay design it deserves!




In the exciting superhero world of My Hero Academia, Dabi is one of the most formidable and dangerous villains Deku and his fellow heroes-in-training have ever had to battle, often pushing them to their limits in ways that seem all but impossible to overcome. And in a new cosplay of the character, Dabi’s all-white “funeral” design comes to life, showing exactly how he should make the transition into the live-action space.




Recently posted on social media via X by @rukochiii, this account is all about creating highly realistic cosplay designs that are essentially a 1:1 representation of what fans see in both the manga and anime series of the most popular franchises around.


 

Dressing as a few other iconic My Hero Academia characters like Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, and even a version of Dabi’s darker costumed “base” form, @rukochiii has also found success cosplaying as characters from Naruto, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, Tokyo Aliens, and more, always impressing with each new cosplay design.

                  My Hero Academia Dabi Cosplay Proves How the Villain Can Work in Live Action   Dabi is a villainous My Hero Academia character that always gives Deku and pals a hard go of it, with a new cosplay showing off his live-action look!   





 Dabi&#39;s All-White Costume Gets The Perfect Cosplay Makeover 
          

Having plagued the heroes of the My Hero Academia universe as a member of both the League of Villains and Paranormal Liberation Front, Dabi has used his Blueflame Quirk to match strength with some of the most powerful characters in My Hero lore, specifically his father Endeavor. Revealed to be Endeavor’s long-thought-dead son Toya during the events of the Paranormal Liberation War arc, Dabi traded in his usual dark set of clothes for a similar all-white design in the current Final War arc, with this heat-resistant set of duds having Dabi come across like a terrifying ghostly apparition.

Photographed head-to-toe so that fans can see every inch of @rukochiii’s manga-accurate design, it’s the little details in Dabi’s costume that make this cosplay stand out from the rest and elevate @rukochiii’s look to something worthy of Hollywood. From the sodden and tattered remains of Dabi’s long jacket to his dirty white boots, cinched belt, silver arm cuffs, and a breezy bare-chested look, @rukochiii nails a costume that fans have yet to see in the anime. Throw in Dabi’s white hair, convincing makeup showing Dabi’s various burns and stapled skin, and, of course, a pose and evil smirk worthy of the character, and @rukochiii solidifies this look as one of the best cosplays ever created for this vile villain, hands down.






 Dabi Cosplay Shows What His Live-Action Design Should Look Like 
          

So although it’s almost guaranteed that My Hero’s upcoming seventh season will incorporate at least some of the epic events currently happening in the manga, it’ll still be a while yet before this unique Dabi design will get its proper animated debut. Luckily for Dabi and fans of the character, @rukochiii gives them something far better to enjoy in the meantime with a live-action My Hero Academia look that absolutely needs to be used as the inspiration for any real-world versions of this god-tier villain moving forward.
