## Literature Review

While Android 17 and 18 are incredibly powerful as shown in DBZ, Dragon Ball GT introduces a team of evil robots who make 17 and 18 look pathetic. 





Despite their power, 17 and 18 weren’t too different from any other fighter in Dragon Ball as they didn’t possess any extra superpowers or extraordinary abilities beyond the norm–something that cannot be said about GT’s Android villains.




In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 16, Pan, Trunks, and Goku agree to visit Gill’s home planet as the little robot was feeling homesick on their travels. When they get there, however, the Z-Fighters discover that the world is completely overrun by robots who may not have been as nice as they were led to believe.

          

The entire situation was a trap set by the villainous Dr. Myuu–who is similar to DBZ’s Dr. Gero as he is also a creator of extremely powerful android fighters. In this episode, fans are introduced to a team of Androids known as the Sigma Force–and they absolutely put 17 and 18 to shame.

In this Dragon Ball GT episode, the Sigma Force attack Goku, Trunks, and Pan with all their might, exhibiting powers that the Z-Fighters have never seen before–such as breaking down their structure and recreating themselves into anything they want. For example, one member of the Sigma Force turned itself into tiny balls to surround their opponent and then transformed into countless spikes to trap them in an inescapable ball of pain. Not only that, but the Sigma Force can also turn into living shadows, making them untouchable while stalking their victims.



 Dragon Ball GT&#39;s Sigma Force Can Actually Combine Voltron Style 
          

All three members of the Sigma Force can actually combine into one Super Android–tripling their already unparalleled power levels. While Android 17 and 18 can technically merge together through the bio-android Cell, they have to essentially sacrifice their lives to give Cell a power-up as opposed to the Sigma Force who can merge and separate at will without basically killing two of their own in the process.




From their bizarre additional powers that the Z-Fighters simply cannot match to the fact that they can increase their collective power levels without sacrificing their own, it is obvious why Dragon Ball GT’s evil Androids make DBZ’s Android 17 and Android 18 look pathetic.
