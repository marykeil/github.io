Spy x Family has finally explained one of its biggest continuity errors and has managed to do so in a genius way. Fans of the series may have noticed that Anya&#39;s name has never been quite consistent, constantly alternating between different spellings since the beginning of the series. Fortunately, the latest chapter of Spy x Family finally settles the matter while also staying true to Anya&#39;s character.

Short Mission 11 of Spy x Family confirms Anya&#39;s name appears inconsistently simply because she does not know how to spell her name and often gets it wrong. In the special, Anya carves out the nameplate often seen hanging on her door, spelling her name as &#34;Ania.&#34; At some point later, Loid points out the error and tells Anya how her name is actually spelled, after which Anya fixes the nameplate.

          




Simple as it may be, this explanation not only fixes a huge continuity error in the most adorable way but also manages to make sense within the context of the story and Anya&#39;s character.

                  Spy X Family: 10 Characters As Adorable As Anya   Spy X Families&#39; Anya Forger is one of the most adorable anime characters out there, but what other anime characters are as precious as the telepath?    


 Anya Misspelling Even Her Name Fits Her Character Perfectly 
          

Anya&#39;s childish tendencies and simple-mindedness are what make her one of the funniest characters in Spy x Family. In fact, some of the series&#39; best gags involve Anya&#39;s struggles with academics. Anya has infamously had trouble pronouncing and spelling words, an excellent example being her tendency to call outings &#34;ootings.&#34; Additionally, Yuri once spent an entire evening trying to teach Anya grammar only for her to ask &#34;What&#39;s a grammar?&#34; at the end of it all. With this history built into her character, it comes as no surprise that Anya would be oblivious ​​​​to even the spelling of her own name.




That said, despite often being the butt of the joke, Anya&#39;s struggles and mannerisms accurately mirror those of a child. This makes it especially difficult not to empathize with her and her struggles with spelling and pronunciation. More importantly, Anya&#39;s character is the perfect example of the series&#39; ability to strike the right balance between funny and cute, which is one of the biggest contributors to Spy x Family&#39;s wholesome charm.

Anya has long been one of Spy x Family&#39;s most relatable characters, and this latest reveal about her name helps her maintain that status while also fixing the long-running continuity issue. While the series has yet to flesh out Anya&#39;s origins further, fans can hope that this special chapter will be the gateway to doing so, with more insight into her character on the way.
