# My Hero Academia s Villains Could Have Won The Final War With 1 Simple Trick


## SUMMARY 



  The villains had a secret weapon that could have changed the outcome of the final battle of My Hero Academia&#39;s Final War arc.   Toga had a vial of Deku&#39;s blood which she used to transform into Deku and lead Ochaco to him during the Shie Hassaikai arc.   If Toga had transformed into Deku after her Quirk Awakening, she could have potentially used his powers, and even trigger the transfer of One for All to her, or to All for One.

## Literature Review

MHA&#39;s villains had one trick in their back pocket that could&#39;ve easily swung the war in their favor, but it was wasted earlier in the story.




My Hero Academia&#39;s Final War arc could&#39;ve gone very differently had one villain held onto her secret weapon a little bit longer. Himiko Toga actually had previously obtained something that could have completely changed the outcome of the battle: Deku&#39;s blood.




Back in the Provisional Licensing Exam arc, when Toga was impersonating Shiketsu High School&#39;s Camie Utsushimi, she managed to get a drop of Deku&#39;s blood in a vial. For Toga, having a sample of Deku&#39;s blood was a way to get closer to her crush, but even a small bit of Deku&#39;s blood could&#39;ve radically changed the story, had it been used at the right moment.

          

In actuality, Toga ended up using this sample of Deku&#39;s blood to transform into him in order to lead Ochaco to where the real Deku was fighting Overhaul, during the Shie Hassaikai arc. However, if she hadn&#39;t used it then, its use later might have completely upended the narrative.



Toga obtained Deku&#39;s Blood in episode #60 of the My Hero Academia anime.








 Himiko Toga Could&#39;ve Stolen One for All 
          

Later in the story, during the Meta Liberation Army arc, Toga underwent a Quirk Awakening, which allowed her not to just mimic the appearance of a person whose blood she ingested, but also their Quirk, if she loved them enough, which she demonstrated by using Ochaco&#39;s Zero Gravity Quirk on their enemies. If Toga had transformed into Deku after this point, she would likely&#39;ve been able to use his Quirk similarly, although Toga&#39;s copy of One for All probably wouldn&#39;t have had the vestiges within it. While other characters (such as Class 1-B&#39;s Monoma) haven&#39;t been able to copy One for All, there&#39;s no reason that logic would necessarily apply to Toga&#39;s Quirk.

Alternatively, there&#39;s a far more dangerous turn of events that could&#39;ve occurred. In order to give One for All to Deku in the first place, All Might had to give him something with a small amount of his DNA (in that case, a hair). A drop of blood could&#39;ve been enough to trigger the transfer of One for All to a new host, which might have turned Toga into the 10th user of One for All. Worse still, if All for One realized how the Quirk actually worked, he might take that drop of blood for himself and steal One for All that way, having it naturally transition to his body, leaving nothing that Deku or All Might could do to stop it.




          

Obviously, going into the final battle without One for All would&#39;ve ended disastrously for the heroes, as Deku has proven to be the only one capable of matching up to Shigaraki at this point. A powerless Deku would mean no one was keeping Shigaraki busy, and that alone would tip the scales tremendously. Add in a version of All for One with One for All at his disposal, and the battle is basically over at that point. The heroes really seem to have lucked out by having Toga use Deku&#39;s blood when she did, as had she waited a few weeks longer, My Hero Academia&#39;s entire story could&#39;ve unraveled.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
