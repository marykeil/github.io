To celebrate the spookiest time of year, Crunchyroll is releasing a wide assortment of horror anime to stream until the end of October.





In a press release, Crunchyroll detailed the exciting bevy of anime being offered from October 1st to the 31st for fans who have a free account. The list of anime free with ads is expansive and includes classics like Hellsing Ultimate and Tokyo Ghoul as well as more recent horror-tinged adventures such as Hell&#39;s Paradise. In addition to these holiday offerings, Crunchyroll already offers hit series like Blue Lock, Chainsaw Man, and Spy x Family for free with ads.

Anime is diverse, and everything the medium could possibly offer is on display in these anime. Fans looking for a straight-up horror series will definitely want to check out Higurashi: When They Cry - GOU and Junji Ito Collection. Meanwhile, anyone looking for action with a spookier side can watch hit series like Hellsing, Hell&#39;s Paradise, and Tokyo Ghoul. Even idol shows are represented in one of Studio MAPPA&#39;s best anime, ZOMBIE LAND SAGA. All of it adds up to a great collection of free series to watch for any fan of anime&#39;s spookier side.




 : Crunchyroll&#39;s Most Motivational Anime Is A Masterpiece More Fans Need To See

All of this is a great show of goodwill to the anime community from Crunchyroll. With so many different series and so many different streaming services, it can be difficult for fans who are strapped for cash to find anime. By offering more free series, Crunchyroll is letting more and more anime fans get into the spirit of Halloween. With twenty horror and horror-themed anime available for free during October, Crunchyroll is putting serious effort into making anime more accessible. These horror series combined with fan-favorites already available for free on Crunchyroll are a truly impressive showing.

Horror has an important place in anime&#39;s history and in anime&#39;s fandom. Anime like Hellsing and Tokyo Ghoul were instrumental in attracting many fans to the medium, so it only makes sense to offer these series for free to celebrate Halloween. With beloved classics, thrilling series that are a bit more recent, and more than a few gems fans might have missed, Crunchyroll&#39;s free anime for Halloween are an eclectic bunch of series that are sure to attract new fans throughout October.
