Crunchyroll has one of the largest streaming anime catalogs available. In addition to being the place to watch the most popular current anime series, Crunchyroll also has an impressive number of older anime series, including some from as far back as the early days of Japanese animation in the 1920s. Nostalgic fans or younger anime fans curious about anime series from past decades will want to check out the best retro anime on Crunchyroll.
&#34;Retro&#34; can be a bit of a difficult term to define exactly, and how old exactly something needs to be in order to be considered retro can vary. For the purpose of this list, &#34;retro&#34; is being used to mean &#34;from before 2000.&#34; While there are plenty of memorable and enjoyable anime series from the 2000s and later, for something to be truly retro, it has to be from before the millennium.









 








 10  Samurai Pizza Cats 
Original Anime Series Created By Tatsunoko Productions
        

  Year Released   1990    Number of Episodes   52    Languages Available   Japanese, English    
The 80s and 90s were infamous for English dubs that completely butchered the original scripts. Notably, the 80s Sci-Fi series Robotech was the result of three unrelated anime series being stitched together. Samurai Pizza Cats is one of the weirdest examples of a 90s anime dub changing the original scripts. There are two versions of the story behind how the English script of Samurai Pizza Cats originated; the American producers either got poor-quality copies of the original script or were given free rein to adapt the original anime however they wanted.
Whatever the case, the results are truly bewildering in the best possible way. Samurai Pizza Cats is a completely off-the-wall comedy with relentlessly fast-paced surreal jokes. Samurai Pizza Cats is such a bizarre but entertaining experience that it needs to be seen to be believed. The unique tone and bombastically ridiculous humor make the series a classic of comedy anime. While it might not be for everyone, Samurai Pizza Cats offers nostalgia for an era when anime dubs were much wilder, making it one of Crunchyroll&#39;s best retro anime.

 9  City Hunter 
Based on the Manga Created By Tsukasa Hojo
        

  Year Released   1987    Number of Episodes   51    Languages Available   Japanese, English    
To put City Hunter&#39;s time period and aesthetic style in context, the opening song begins with a woman calling the main character on a rotary phone. City Hunter feels like an anime version of an 80s American crime show like Magnum, P.I. or Miami Vice, though set in Tokyo. Following the sweeper Ryo Saeba, a combination hitman, bodyguard, and private eye for hire, City Hunter is slick and stylish, but tonally inconsistent.
Ryo shifts back and forth between coming off as a complete goofball and acting as a cool and effective professional gunslinger. Similarly, the fan service and humor about Ryo&#39;s interactions with women haven&#39;t aged well, but the 80s visuals and soundtrack make City Hunter a fascinating on-screen depiction of 80s Tokyo. Despite some poorly-aged elements though, there&#39;s an undeniable charm to City Hunter that has made it an absolute classic.
The original City Hunter anime received a feature-length adaptation in 2023 to commemorate its 35th anniversary.

 8  Lupin the Third Part I 
Based on the Manga Created By Monkey Punch
        

  Year Released   1971    Number of Episodes   23    Languages Available   Japanese    
Lupin the Third is one of the most popular, longest-running, and most prolific anime series of all time. Based on the manga series by Monkey Punch, the Lupin the Third anime has had eight anime series, ten theatrical movies, and a made-for-TV movie every year between 1989 and 2013 — although the release schedule for these TV movies has slowed in recent years, new Lupin TV movies are still being produced. Notably, Hayao Miyazaki made his directorial debut with the second Lupin movie, The Castle of Cagliostro.
Lupin the Third Part I — not to be confused with the similarly named 2019 movie Lupin III: The First— is the first animated adaptation of the original manga series. Though the exact depiction of Lupin himself has changed over the years, with the character generally becoming less amoral and more heroic, Part I is still a good introduction to the franchise. The visual style has stayed consistent throughout the franchise and thematically, the franchise has never abandoned the premise of being a heist series crossed with spy thrillers like James Bond. It&#39;s this unique blend that makes Lupin the Third Part I one of Crunchyroll&#39;s best retro anime.

 7  Captain Harlock 
Based on the Manga Created By Leiji Matsumoto
        

  Year Released   1978    Number of Episodes   42    Languages Available   Japanese    
A space opera series following the adventures of the Robin Hood-like title character, Captain Harlock is a unique blend of the past and the future. Despite the series being set at the end of the 30th century, Captain Harlock himself dresses like a pirate straight out of the 1700s and his ship, the Arcadia is a blend of a spaceship and a historical pirate ship that doesn&#39;t really make technological sense, but has a striking visual profile.
The decadence and cynicism of Harlock&#39;s depiction of the future Earth contrasts with the title character&#39;s own romanticism and idealism. It adds up to create a compelling thematic statement of Captain Harlock being the romantic champion fighting for what&#39;s right and staying true to his personal ideals, even if it means the entire galaxy despises him for it.

 6  Dirty Pair 
Based on the Light Novel Series Created By Haruka Takachiho &amp; Yoshikazu Yasuhiko
        

  Year Released   1985    Number of Episodes   24 &#43; 2 OVAs    Languages Available   Japanese    
At a glance, the title Dirty Pair is fairly easy to misinterpret. Although it seems to be suggesting that the series is raunchy and ribald, it is in fact an in-universe reference to the title characters&#39; destructive tendencies. Freelance Trouble Consultants Kei and Yuri insistently call themselves the Lovely Angels. Since they have a reputation for causing more problems than they solve, virtually everyone else in the series calls them the Dirty Pair. Kei and Yuri&#39;s vocal dislike for the nickname provides much of the female-led sci fi series&#39; comedic moments.
Thanks to its pulpy tone alongside Kei and Yuri being inspired by Japanese women&#39;s pro wrestling, there is a significant amount of fan service throughout the series. Looking past that though, Dirty Pair is an entertaining series that blends solid action sequences with comedic moments and a tone that never takes itself too seriously. The original 1985 series will likely be a welcome change of pace for fans who disliked the later Dirty Pair Flash reboot.

 5  Fist of the North Star 
Based on the Manga Created By Buronson &amp; Tetsuo Hara
        

  Year Released   1984    Number of Episodes   109    Languages Available   Japanese    
Fist of the North Star is equal parts Mad Max, Dragon Ball, and a classic Bruce Lee movie. Martial artist Kenshiro wanders a post-apocalyptic landscape, fighting the roving bandits who prey on innocent civilians. The title refers to Kenshiro&#39;s style of martial arts, which strikes the enemy&#39;s pressure points, causing their bodies to contort and ultimately explode in spectacular and graphic fashion. The delay between Kenshiro&#39;s strikes and his targets&#39; inevitable demise is the origin of the well-known &#34;You are already dead&#34; meme.
Despite the comedy created by the fanbase embracing that one iconic line, Fist of the North Star is overall fairly serious and grim. Kenshiro&#39;s wanderings culminate in a conflict with the villainous Raoh, a former student of the same martial arts school who has turned into an ambitious and ruthless conqueror. Fist of the North Star is one of the most influential anime series ever, so there is no wonder it is also one of Crunchyroll&#39;s best retro anime.

 4  Mobile Suit Gundam 
Original Anime Series Created By Yoshiyuki Tomino
        

  Year Released   1979    Number of Episodes   43    Languages Available   Japanese English    
The original Mobile Suit Gundam is one of the most important anime series of all time. The RX-78-2 Gundam Mobile Suit is probably the single most iconic anime mech of all time and the original Gundam not only influenced the development of later entries in the franchise, but has also been hugely influential on later anime in general.
Even outside of its influence on pop culture, Mobile SuitGundam is also a highly compelling series in its own right. Although the action is engaging, it&#39;s also an unflinching depiction of war and does a remarkable examination of the psychological toll of waging war, especially on its teenage main cast. That would become a major aspect of the franchise going forward, and the original Gundam has a very strong cast of nuanced and sympathetic characters.

 3  Akira 
Based on the Manga Created By Katsuhiro Otomo


 







  Year Released   1988    Runtime   124 Minutes    Languages Available   Japanese, English    
Directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, who also created the original manga version, Akira has gone down as one of the best anime movies of all time. While the dark Cyberpunk story set in a decaying, dystopian future Tokyo is compelling on its own merits, Akira is also notable for its high production values. The art and animation are highly detailed and still look gorgeous, even three decades later. The phenomenal soundtrack draws on a lot of eclectic forms of world music and is hard to pin down exactly. On the one hand, it doesn&#39;t really fit in with the Cyberpunk setting. On the other hand, because it&#39;s so unlike any other anime soundtrack, it remains instantly recognizable.
Akira was one of the first anime movies to get a wide release in North America, and it still remains one of the best thanks to a perfect combination of style and substance.

 2  Record of Lodoss War 
Based on the Novel Series Created By Ryo Mizuno
        

  Year Released   1990    Number of Episodes   13    Languages Available   Japanese, English    
Given how popular dark fantasy anime has become since Record of Lodoss War first aired, the series actually feels like a breath of fresh air, despite being more than three decades old. While there are dark moments and some of the villains have nuanced personalities and motivations beyond brutally conquering the world, Lodoss War is a remarkably sincere and straightforward high fantasy story that doesn&#39;t put any subversive or iconoclastic spins on the genre.
If Lodoss War has any real gimmick in its premise, it&#39;s the fact that the series began as recaps of tabletop RPG sessions compiled and serialized by author Ryo Mizuno. Despite how dry that might sound though, the result is nothing short of thrilling. Fans wanting a classic fantasy anime on Crunchyroll can&#39;t do wrong with Record of Lodoss War.

 1  Dragon Ball Z (1989-1996) 
Based on the Manga Created By Akira Toriyama


 







  Year Released   1989    Number of Episodes   291    Languages Available   Japanese, English    
With the exception of Dragon Ball Super, every entry in the Dragon Ball franchise can be considered a retro anime series. However, Dragon Ball Z is easily the most popular part of the franchise, containing the majority of the franchise&#39;s most memorable and iconic moments. Although Dragon Ball Z is infamous for being a slow burn with large amounts of filler — for example, Goku&#39;s confrontation with Frieza takes 20 episodes — the ability to stream the series on demand via Crunchyroll mitigates this issue. The series&#39; best moments still hold up, and Dragon Ball Z is begging to be revisited by nostalgic fans. With its thrilling action and deep sincerity, Dragon Ball Z is the best retro anime available on Crunchyroll.
