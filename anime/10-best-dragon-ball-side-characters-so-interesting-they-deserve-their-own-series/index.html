  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Dragon Ball
&rsquo;s side characters are just as interesting as the main characters and deserve their own series.
Fans want to know more about the backstories and origins of characters like Mercenary Tao, Monster Carrot, and the humans that became Androids 17 and 18.
Characters like Dr. Gero, Moro, and Jiren, just to name a few, have intriguing pasts and storylines that should be explored in
Dragon Ball
spin-off series.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While the likes of Goku &amp; Vegeta are iconic, they&rsquo;re far from the only interesting Dragon Ball characters. Here are 10 that deserve their own series!</p>
<p>When fans think of Dragon Ball, it’s more than likely that the first few characters who come to mind are Goku, Vegeta, or Piccolo, with a few key villains thrown in there as well, such as Frieza, Cell, or Majin Buu. While that’s completely understandable given the prominence of these characters (and others like them), it shouldn’t lead fans to think that the main characters are the only ones worth paying attention to.
Since the very beginning of the series, Dragon Ball has been filled to the brim with incredibly interesting characters, and most of them are side characters. Some of them were villains-of-the-week for Goku and Bulma during their initial trek around the world searching for Dragon Balls. Others are warriors from other universes who haven’t been explored to their fullest extent. And others, still, are divine beings with origins that remain a mystery. Out of all of them, 10 Dragon Ball side characters stand out as being so interesting, that they deserve their own series.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Already Improved One of GT&rsquo;s Biggest Disappointments<br>
Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero was more than just a groundbreaking success, it also totally fixed perhaps the biggest disappointment in Dragon Ball GT.</p>
<p>10 Mercenary Tao was Goku’s 1st Truly Deadly Dragon Ball Villain - What’s His Story?
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball episode 58 “The Land of Korin”</p>
<p>Mercenary Tao - or, Taopaipai - is an assassin in the Dragon Ball universe who was hired by the Red Ribbon Army to kill Goku. While Tao was far from the first villain Goku faced in the series, he was probably the first truly deadly opponent. This was proven true when Dragon Ball&rsquo;s Tao killed General Blue with his tongue, and then again after he murdered Bora right in front of Goku.
While his backstory was briefly explained, it wasn’t nearly fleshed out enough for a character like Mercenary Tao. A full series showing how Tao became the human assassin who nearly killed a Saiyan - whose children regularly raze entire planets - would be incredibly fascinating.</p>
<p>9 Monster Carrot Has the Power to Turn Anyone He Touches Into a Carrot - What’s That About?
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball episode 9 “Boss Rabbit’s Magic Touch”</p>
<p>Characters having incredible abilities in Dragon Ball is nothing new, as Goku and the gang regularly shoot beams of energy from their hands and fly. However, their abilities are derived from channeling ki, which is explained in detail throughout the series. Monster Carrot’s powers, on the other hand, have no explanation whatsoever. Monster Carrot can turn anyone into a carrot simply by touching them - and it is high-time fans learn why.
A series delving into the backstory of this anthropomorphic rabbit could explain his rise to power as a feared mob boss, and - more notably - answer the burning question Dragon Ball fans have been asking since his debut: how does Dragon Ball&rsquo;s Monster Carrot turn people into carrots?</p>
<p>8 Dr. Gero Hates Goku Far More Than He Should - Why Is That?
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball Z episode 126 “The Androids Appear”</p>
<p>Sure, it’s explained in Dragon Ball Z that Dr. Gero has hated Goku since the Saiyan took down the Red Ribbon Army, but that explanation at face value alone just isn’t good enough. Dr. Gero committed his life to destroying Goku. He used a tiny autonomous robot to follow Goku around for years, he mutilated people to turn them into cyborgs strong enough to fight Goku, and he even turned himself into a machine in the process. That’s a level of commitment that goes far beyond political loyalties - or does it?
The Red Ribbon Army was a fascist regime with plans to take over the world, meaning their scientists had to be committed to the cause with every fiber of their being. It’s possible that Dr. Gero was conditioned in the most grisly ways imaginable to become the villain he is in DBZ, or perhaps he was simply pure evil right from the start. Either way, a Dr. Gero origin story would be absolutely fantastic to see.</p>
<p>7 A Slice of Life Anime Introducing DBZ Fans to the REAL 17 &amp; 18 (Before They Were Androids)
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball Z episode 133 “Nightmare Comes True”</p>
<p>Androids 17 and 18 were humans before the wicked Dr. Gero turned them into his ‘Androids’, but Dragon Ball fans know absolutely nothing about them. Their stories are fully told from the moment they’re introduced to the very latest additions to Dragon Ball canon - including the fact that 18 has a family with Krillin and 17 protects endangered animals with his own mysterious family on an island - but not a word about who they were beforehand.
This hypothetical series could even stand out from Dragon Ball more than the rest, as it wouldn’t have to be overly action-heavy. In fact, it might be refreshing to see a slice of life anime starring the original human versions of 17 and 18, with the knowledge that they’ll eventually be turned into androids against their will, acting as a dramatic looming presence over the entire series.</p>
<p>6 King Cold Conquered the Vast Majority of the Dragon Ball Universe - How?!
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball Z episode 118 “Frieza’s Counterattack”</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, from the very beginning of Dragon Ball mythos, Emperor Frieza was regarded as the highest authority in the universe. It was he who controlled the Saiyans, conquered entire sections of the galaxy, and wielded the power to destroy whole planets on a whim. Then, it was revealed that Frieza was just the son of the true ruler of the cosmos, the one who presumably created the kingdom over which Frieza so arrogantly ruled: King Cold.
Almost nothing is known about King Cold aside from his shameful death by the hand of Trunks, who thought of Cold and Frieza as little more than temporary neusences. It’s time to return this fallen villain to a position of strength with a series that details exactly how Cold became King.</p>
<p>5 Moro is a Cosmic Sorcerer Who Consumes Entire Planets - What’s His Story?
First appearance (manga) Dragon Ball Super chapter 43 “Joining the Galactic Patrol!”</p>
<p>Moro is an ancient being who consumes planets, feeding off the souls of the dead - billions of life forms at a time. His energy is sensed by those who oppose him as a feeling of unfathomable fear and suffering. Deities can’t kill him, prisons can’t contain him, and even standing on the same ground as him is one of the most dangerous things one can do. In other words, Moro is insanely fascinating, and more than deserves his own series.
While Dragon Ball Super does a great job of explaining exactly who Moro is as well as major details of his backstory, there’s still a lot that&rsquo;s been left unsaid. Moro is an ancient, cosmic being who’s touched countless worlds, which means there are countless stories to be told - perhaps in the form of a horror manga?</p>
<p>4 Granolah and the Heeters Would Be the Perfect Dragon Ball Spin-Off Series
First appearance (manga): Dragon Ball Super chapter 67 “Happy Endings… And Then…”</p>
<p>For a fleeting time in Dragon Ball canon, Granolah was the strongest warrior in the universe, as he wished upon the Dragon Balls of his world to attain such power, tragically shortening his lifespan as a result. Granolah did this to get strong enough to kill Frieza, as the Evil Emperor was responsible for destroying Granolah’s homeworld. In that effort, Granolah joined a team of space pirates/planet-selling entrepreneurs called the Heeters, acting as their bounty hunter.
There are many directions this hypothetical series starring Granolah and the Heeters could go. It could be a prequel series showing their adventures leading up to this Dragon Ball Super arc. Or, it could pick up after the arc is over, showing what Granolah does with the few years he has left (and if he can escape his fate). Either way, this would be the ultimate Dragon Ball spin-off!</p>
<p>3 The Saiyans from Universe 6 Deserve a Full Dragon Ball-Length Series
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball Super episode 32 “The Matches Begin! We’re All Off to the ‘Planet with No Name!’”</p>
<p>Dragon Ball’s prime reality is revealed to be designated Universe 7 in Dragon Ball Super, and that Universe 6 is its nearly identical counterpart. Fans are even introduced to Saiyans from Universe 6, ones who not only have the capacity to reach Super Saiyan or host a Legendary Super Saiyan (like Broly), but who come from a flourishing species. Universe 7 Saiyans are all but extinct, but there’s a whole planet buzzing with Saiyans in Universe 6 - and it’s time fans got to spend some time there.
It would be interesting to see this hypothetical series take place after Vegeta and Goku introduced the idea of Super Saiyan to them, as they had no idea this form was even real, much less attainable. This would assuredly upset the hierarchy of the planet, and the action-packed drama that would ensue for the Universe 6 Saiyans is too awesome not to see.</p>
<p>2 Jiren is a God-Tier Warrior with a Traumatic Past, &amp; Dragon Ball Fans Need More of Him
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball Super episode 85 “The Universes Go Into Action – Each With Their Own Motives”</p>
<p>Dragon Ball fans were given Jiren’s full backstory during the Tournament of Power, as well as his motives for fighting in the tournament itself. However, once the tournament was over and Jiren was sent back to his universe, he was a changed man. Jiren was no longer filled with rage and regret, and decided to stop pining for the things he’d lost in his past, and instead focus on building a better future. And Dragon Ball fans deserve to see every second of that.
Jiren is stronger than his universe’s God of Destruction, making him not just one of the heaviest hitters in his universe, but the entire multiverse. Even Vegeta still thinks about Jiren in the most current Dragon Ball chapters (specifically in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero), which only highlights the character’s significance, and reinforces the fact that - if Dragon Ball spin-offs are being granted - Jiren should be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>1 Dragon Ball Needs a Series Dedicated to Every Universe’s God of Destruction
First appearance (anime): Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods</p>
<p>Lord Beerus is the first God of Destruction introduced in Dragon Ball, but he is far from the last. Every universe in the Dragon Ball multiverse has a God of Destruction, and unlike other divine beings like Kais, Gods of Destruction aren’t necessarily born. Mortals can attain this level of godhood if they are trained by a Destroyer God in the ways of Hakai - or, ‘Destruction’. So, which Destroyer Gods were born and which ones inherited the position? Are any Gods of Destruction born gods? Who was the first God of Destruction?
These questions need answers, and only a series dedicated to Dragon Ball’s Gods of Destruction can answer them. Lord Beerus may be a main character in Dragon Ball lore, but his story is in dire need of further exploration, just like the other 10 Dragon Ball side characters who are so interesting, they deserve their own series.

<p>Dragon Ball Super</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Super is a sequel to the original Dragon Ball series as well as the fan-favorite Dragon Ball Z anime. Dragon Ball Super takes place ten years after Majin Buu is defeated and follows Goku and his friends on all-new adventures. Much like its predecessors, Dragon Ball Super was praised throughout its 131 episodes.</p>
