With nothing left but the clothes on their backs and the few weapons they were able to carry with them, Laios convinces Marcille and Chilchuck to go back into the dungeon and find the dragon so that they can resurrect Falin.




However, without supplies, the trio will need to survive with what they find in the dungeon, including feeding on the monsters, wild animals, bugs, and weeds that are commonly part of a dungeon&#39;s flora and fauna. It&#39;s a proposition that doesn&#39;t exactly inspire them until they meet Senshi, a dwarf warrior who also turns out to be a &#34;gourmet&#34; chef of dungeon cuisine.
