# Jujutsu Kaisen s Only Way To Bring Gojo Back Will Horrify Fans


## SUMMARY 



  Kenjaku would be a fool if he had not planned already for Sukuna&#39;s eventual betrayal.   Kenjaku could have a plan to deal with Sukuna using his ability to transfer his brain into a deceased body, which he could use on Gojo, whose corpse is still lying on the battlefield.   Kenjaku has taken over the body of Gojo&#39;s friend Suguru Geto and could potentially do the same with Gojo&#39;s corpse. This would give Kenjaku access to Gojo&#39;s powerful cursed technique and make him even stronger.

## Literature Review

The reborn Sukuna will soon become a threat to Kenjaku, but the latter could have a trump card that will horrify Gojo fans.




As Ryomen Sukuna continues cycling through the Jujutsu Kaisen sorcerers amassed against him, his partner - Kenjaku - cannot help but think of the moment the unpredictable King of Curses will turn against him. While he most certainly wants Sukuna to succeed in taking out the most sorcerers that remain in their way, Kenjaku surely has a plan to deal with him once the time comes, and it could involve a horrible comeback for the deceased Gojo.




Seeing how powerful Sukuna in his real form has become, it&#39;s not wrong for Kenjaku to fear that Sukuna will ultimately turn on him. Indeed, the more success he has in tearing down the Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s sorcerer community, the less Sukuna needs to keep Kenjaku around. However, Kenjaku is no fool. In fact, there&#39;s one major play he could make that would ensure he remains the first among equals and the unchallenged leader in a new age of sorcery.

          

Kenjaku&#39;s innate technique allows him to transfer his brain into a deceased body, taking it over along with its abilities. He did that with Gojo&#39;s old friend Suguru Geto, whose body he is currently inhabiting. In theory, there is nothing stopping him from doing the same with Gojo&#39;s corpse.





 Kenjaku Could Take Over Gojo&#39;s Corpse To Kill Sukuna 
          

Naturally, after watching Sukuna take down Satoru Gojo and Hajime Koshimo, any attempt by Kenjaku to take out Sukuna directly seems much easier said than done. But the reality is different. Kenjaku has survived for thousands of years by using his cursed technique to take over the bodies of dead people. After Gojo killed Geto, Kenjaku implanted his brain in Geto&#39;s skull before it could be properly sealed and buried. As a result, he gained control of Geto&#39;s body, and more importantly his innate cursed technique.

Gojo is now dead, and his body has not been properly sealed and buried. As far as fans know, it&#39;s still lying on the battlefield. As the fighting between Sukuna and other sorcerers rages on around it, Kenjaku has the perfect opportunity to snatch away Gojo&#39;s body, and later use his innate technique and implant his brain in Gojo&#39;s body. Doing so would give Kenjaku access to Gojo&#39;s Limitless technique, the Six Eyes, and the Domain Expansion, which made him the strongest sorcerer of his age. Indeed, while Geto provided Kenjaku with enough ability to defeat the combined efforts of Yuki Tsukumo, Master Tengen, and Choso, having Gojo&#39;s abilities would be a major power upgrade.






 Kenjaku In Gojo&#39;s Body Could Have A Better Chance Of Beating Sukuna Than Gojo Did 
          

Unfortunately for fans of the iconic Gojo, this would also mean to see him come back, but as a reanimated corpse with no will of his own. It would surely be a heartbreaking turn of events, but it&#39;s also the most logical move for Kenjaku. While Gojo ultimately lost to Sukuna, a Kenjaku with Gojo&#39;s powers could do better than the original. After all, he watched Gojo nearly defeat Sukuna, who had to use Mahoraga to win - something on which Kenjaku commented in the latest chapter, perhaps in a glimpse of foreshadowing. There are also still quite a few Jujutsu sorcerers waiting to take on Sukuna, meaning that with each fight, Kenjaku will learn even more about his partner&#39;s tactics and weaknesses.

While it&#39;s possible that Sukuna will remain faithful to his arrangement with Kenjaku, there&#39;s a greater chance that he won&#39;t. There&#39;s nothing about Sukuna&#39;s personality that says he&#39;ll defer to anything other than his own will. Moreover, as logical as Kenjaku has proven to be, it would seem odd that he hasn&#39;t at least thought about the possibility of Sukuna turning on him. If that&#39;s the case, Gojo&#39;s death provides him with a perfect opportunity. Taking over Gojo&#39;s body would allow Kenjaku to get the upper hand on Sukuna, but it would also mark a horrifying return for one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most popular characters.
