# Pokémon Horizons Unveils The Full Team Of The Strongest Trainer Ever


## SUMMARY 



  Lucius&#39;s team, consisting of Legendary Pokémon and unique species, showcases his accomplished trainer status and wide travels across different regions.   Each Pokémon in Lucius&#39;s team serves a specific purpose, from Lapras&#39;s transportation abilities to Kleavor&#39;s tree-cutting skills, making them ideal for an adventurer like Lucius.   Liko and Roy&#39;s mission to find the remaining members of Lucius&#39;s team brings the two plotlines of Pokémon Horizons together, providing them with a new goal and direction.

## Literature Review

Pokémon Horizons introduced the anime&#39;s strongest trainer, an ancient adventurer who owned the Black Rayquaza. Now, his full team is finally revealed.




Pokémon Horizons had already revealed that the Ancient Adventurer Lucius, rumored to be one of the strongest trainers in history, owned some pretty amazing Pokémon, including the Black Rayquaza. Now, his full team has been unveiled, and it&#39;s definitely a group worthy of going down in Pokémon history as the strongest.




Previously, it was revealed that the Ancient Poké Balls, like the one Roy has, were once Lucius&#39;s; the first one to be seen contained the Black Rayquaza, followed by a Titan-sized Arboliva, and then a Galarian Moltres. As it turns out, Liko&#39;s grandmother is something of an expert on Lucius, and she was about to reveal more when the Explorers attacked. After they escaped, she provided Liko with Lucius&#39;s journal, and revealed the rest of his team.

          

Alongside the three previously known Pokémon, it was shown that Lucius also owned a Lapras, a Kleavor, and another Legendary Pokémon, Entei.


 Lucius&#39;s Team Is Perfect for an Adventurer 
          




With half of Lucius&#39;s team made up of Legendary Pokémon, it&#39;s clear that he was an accomplished trainer; in the anime, Legendary Pokémon won&#39;t listen to just anyone, after all. The team also represents a wide swath of the Pokémon world, with his Pokémon native to Hoenn, Paldea, Galar, Kanto, Hisui (Sinnoh) and Johto, meaning that Lucius really got around. It&#39;s been suggested that Lucius was active roughly a hundred years prior to the story, which might make him contemporaneous to the Hisui era seen in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.

Why these Pokémon in particular? The Legendaries speak for themselves; their power would come in handy in just about any situation. Lapras is a fairly rare Pokémon, and also one that&#39;s excellent for transporting people overseas, making it an invaluable companion as well. The Arboliva stands out for its sheer size, towering over others of its kind, while Kleavor is a rare Pokémon that&#39;s extinct in the modern day, with its axe arms capable of cutting down trees and demolishing obstacles. The team is well suited to the needs of an adventurer who&#39;s constantly on the move in potentially dangerous areas.






 What Does Lucius&#39;s Team Mean For Liko and Roy? 
          

Liko and Roy were told to seek out the remaining members of Lucius&#39;s team, known collectively as &#34;the Six Heroes.&#34; Liko and Roy are already in possession of the balls containing Arboliva and Moltres, as well as the Black Rayquaza&#39;s ball (though Rayquaza isn&#39;t in it). So far, the balls have been found in their native regions (aside from Rayquaza&#39;s), which means that Liko and Roy will likely be setting off to Johto, Kanto, or Sinnoh. Terapagos also has some association with Lucius, and may be able to help them convince the Six Heroes to come with them. For now, recruiting Lucius&#39;s team gives Liko and Roy a new goal, tying the two Pokémon Horizons plotlines together at last.
