## Literature Review

The official website for the highly anticipated BL anime film Ten Count delivered heartbreaking news to fans, announcing the production is canceled.




Fans of the popular Boys&#39; Love manga series Ten Count were delivered heartbreaking news after the official website for the series&#39; upcoming anime adaptation announced that the project had been officially canceled due to production issues. The adaptation of Rihito Takarai&#39;s forbidden romance series was originally slated to release back in 2020 as a televised series, but was delayed after staff members working on the anime decided they weren&#39;t happy with the way the project was being developed.




In 2022, the production team announced that Ten Count&#39;s adaptation would instead be an anime film with a theatrical release that would open in 2023, but as the year dragged on, no further updates were communicated to fans, and the film was never released.

          

The anime adaptation was a collaboration between the studios Synergy SP and East Fish Studio, and was going to be distributed by Pony Canyon, the same company responsible for distributing other popular anime series like Sound! Euphonium and The Quintessential Quintuplets.

To further solidify the film&#39;s unexpected cancelation, it was announced that the website and X – formerly Twitter – account for the project will shut down on March 31, 2024. The announcement, which was posted on January 18, 2024, simply states, &#34;Due to production reasons, we have canceled the production of Ten Count, which was scheduled to release in 2023. We sincerely apologize to the fans who have been looking forward to the release for a long time, as well as to those involved in the production of the film.&#34;


 

 Ten Count is a Boys&#39;s Love romance series that follows the forbidden romantic relationship between its two main leads, Tadaomi Shirotani – a young man who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder that has made him an extreme germaphobe, an affliction that has gotten in the way of his daily life – and Riku Korose, a psychotherapist who introduces Shirotani to exposure therapy in an effort to help him with his symptoms. After providing Shirotani with a list of activities to help him return to his normal life, Riku suddenly suspends their sessions.




It&#39;s later revealed that this is because Riku has fallen in love with Shirotani, and that it would be inappropriate for him to continue treating him given his feelings. Pushing their concerns aside, the pair enter a taboo relationship, where Riku continues to provide therapy sessions to Shirotani while they simultaneously develop a deeper romantic connection. The series originally began serializing in Shinshokan&#39;s Dear&#43; magazine in 2013, with the final chapter being released in 2017. Viz Media&#39;s SuBLime imprint licensed the series for an English print release in 2015, and has released all six volumes physically.

          

Despite the cancelation of the anime adaptation being a major disappointment for fans of the series, Ten Count has earned plenty of praise since it began serializing – ranking #1 on the National Bookstores&#39; Top Recommended Boys&#39; Love in Japan in 2015 and 2016, and placed 3rd for Best Manga at the Sugoi Japan Awards in 2017.
