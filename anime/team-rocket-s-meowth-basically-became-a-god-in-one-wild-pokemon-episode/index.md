## Literature Review

Pokemon may primarily focus on Ash and his friends, but even Team Rocket has had a chance to shine in one episode that made Meowth a god.




Team Rocket is continually having wild adventures within Pokémon, creating and finding trouble readily. Several episodes have shown opportunities for each member the iconic trio to go their own way, but the team frequently sticks together. This is even true when Meowth is viewed as a god by an island&#39;s inhabitants.




While a supporting character, Meowth is a fan-favorite who has been the star of a few Pokémon episodes. The first was &#34;Go West Young Meowth&#34;, episode #70 in Pokémon: Indigo League. This episode shared the talking feline&#39;s backstory, including how he learned to speak. In Season 2, Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands, Meowth is granted the spotlight again.

          

Episode #96, &#34;Meowth Rules&#34;, places Team Rocket at the forefront of events as they wind up shipwrecked on Golden Island. This episode not only lets Meowth headline, but it also strengthens the bond Team Rocket shares by threatening to break them up.

                  Pikachu Joined Team Rocket &amp; Fought Ash In One Heartbreaking Pokémon Episode   Ash and Pikachu&#39;s friendship is a staple of the Pokémon series, and a heartbreaking episode nearly broke them up when Pikachu joined Team Rocket.   





 Meowth&#39;s Time As a God Was Cut Short

On Golden Island, the inhabitants&#39; society revolves around the &#34;Great Meowth of Bounty,&#34; which is celebrated with a giant golden Meowth statue. The people believe Team Rocket&#39;s cat companion is the Great Meowth who has arrived on the island in accordance with a prophecy of its return. Coinciding with a full moon - also mentioned in the prophecy - Meowth is treated like a deity, given food and comfortable lodging, as well as ultimate respect. This results in a temporary rift between the cat and his criminal teammates, as he believes he is gaining more respect than his friends have given him.

However, Meowth is quickly forced to confront his shortcomings from the islanders&#39; perspective. Meowth famously can&#39;t use Pay Day, a move that defines the &#34;Great Meowth of Bounty&#34; and its generosity. The deity brings the people prosperity through the move, but Team Rocket&#39;s feline thief never actually learned the move, which would immediately reveal him to be a fraud. Even when he has confessed, the villagers believe they can make it happen, forcing him into battle. While this naturally does not work, the bond between the Team Rocket trio is proven to be stronger than the gains Meowth could get from the villagers.

By giving up his &#34;prized bottle cap&#34; collection, James, with Jessie&#39;s assistance, proves that they love Meowth regardless of his move set. He is their friend and they love him the way he is. Though this episode has a strange setup with Meowth being viewed as a deity, it is one of the series&#39; most heartwarming for its primary villains. Meowth&#39;s time as a god was short-lived, but the Pokémon anime proved Team Rocket may be criminals with nefarious plans and troublesome schemes, but when trouble arises, they stick through it together. 

The second season of Pokémon is available to watch on Amazon Prime.
