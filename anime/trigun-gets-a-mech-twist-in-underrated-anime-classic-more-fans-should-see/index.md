## Literature Review

Gun X Sword is an underrated anime that is inspired by Trigun&#39;s cowboy tones, but adds a lot to that premise, including mecha.




As a popular and long-running anime series, Trigun has influenced later works, including the 2005 series Gun X Sword, a tale of revenge set on a planet called Endless Illusion, that soon grows to encompass a conflict that holds the fate of the entire planet in the balance. Although the superficial similarities are apparent at a glance, to the point that Gun X Sword has been written off as a cheap rip-off of Trigun, the former goes beyond the shared Western trappings to tell a story that sets itself apart from Trigun with style and a memorable cast of characters.




While Trigun is a popular anime that recently spawned a remake called Trigun Stampede, Gun X Sword has never risen beyond being a cult classic, despite being directed by the legendary Goro Taniguchi. The most significant thing to note about Gun X Sword is that it&#39;s a mecha anime. The protagonist, Van, pilots a mecha, called Armors in the series, named Dann, one of a group of seven particularly powerful Armors. Throughout the series, Van has to fight against the other six Armors and their pilots as he pursues revenge against their leader, the man called the Claw, who killed Van&#39;s wife. Helped by the strength of the mecha action, the story and characters of Gun X Sword help to establish the series as more than a cheap rip-off of Trigun.

Gun X Sword opens with a quintessential Western scene. A lone wanderer enters a church, while a teenage girl aims a gun at a group of bandits, looking for information about her kidnapped brother. Almost immediately, Gun X Sword&#39;s unique tone becomes apparent. Van wanders into the church because he hasn&#39;t eaten in days and is looking for food, a recurring aspect of his character throughout the series. Although the first episode has the look and feel of a cowboy movie, the Western backdrop is dropped pretty quickly, though the series never completely abandons the feel or themes of a Western. Van looks like a cowboy and his pursuit of revenge and his tendency to roll into town just in time to save the day are well-tested Western plots.




                  Trigun Stampede Season 2: Latest News, Story, Characters, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   A second season has been confirmed for the winter hit Trigun Stampede. Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s been revealed about the new season so far.   

Gun X Sword balances a fairly dark revenge plot with bombastic and larger-than-life characters and plotlines that verge into the ludicrous and outright silly. Standouts include the lovestruck criminal couple driving around in a heavily armored car and managing to be little more than nuisances, a lucha libre team of combining mechas, and the female cast&#39;s excursion to a spurned fashion designer&#39;s all-female utopia which culminates with a race through what can only be described as a bikini obstacle course. Still, there are genuine powerful episodes, named characters do die, and not everyone really gets a happy ending.

The main draw, however, is the mecha action. The first time Van summons Dann, via the mecha being dropped from space in the form of a giant sword is jaw-dropping. Most episodes climax with a fight between mechas and there&#39;s enough difference in the featured mechas&#39; designs and powers that each fight feels unique. Van gets most of the series&#39; most memorable moments piloting Dann, especially in his battles against the Claw&#39;s six primary minions. Fundamentally, Gun X Sword is more a mecha anime with a faint but persistent Western aesthetic than it is a full-blown Western anime.

Gun X Sword was initially written off as a rip-off, due to some ultimately superficial similarities with better-known anime. Gun X Sword does display its Western genre influences, but it soon goes in its own unique direction. Although there are similarities, Gun X Sword is so much more than just Trigun with mecha, and more fans should watch this underrated cult classic.

Gun X Sword is available to stream on Crunchyroll.
