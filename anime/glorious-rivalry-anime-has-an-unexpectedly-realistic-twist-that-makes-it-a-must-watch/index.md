# Glorious Rivalry Anime Has an Unexpectedly Realistic Twist That Makes It a Must Watch


## SUMMARY 



  Firefighter Daigo focuses on the rivalry between Shun and Daigo, similar to iconic anime rivalries, but takes place in the real world with no supernatural abilities.   The series explores the relationship between the main characters through flashbacks, with Shun portrayed as the perpetual underdog and Daigo as the superior firefighter.   While firefighting facts are covered in detail, the true focus of Firefighter Daigo is on the character interactions and the one-sided rivalry between Shun and Daigo.

## Literature Review

Firefighter Daigo: Rescuer in Orange borrows how rivalries are presented in Berserk and Gungrave, but it takes place in the real world with no powers.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for Firefighter Daigo: Rescuer in Orange episode 5!!The soon-to-be rivalry between two main characters in Crunchyroll&#39;s Firefighter Daigo: Rescuer in Orange is delivered similarly as two of the most iconic rivalries in anime as portrayed in Berserk and Gungrave, but unlike them, Firefighter Daigo takes place in the real world with no supernatural abilities. Both Berserk and Gungrave center on the dynamic relationship between their main characters by first giving a taste of where they are in the present day before delving into their past to explore how they get there. Berserk is filled to the brim with demons who want to devour Guts and Gungrave starts with an undead hero. Meanwhile, Firefighter Daigo transpires in a realistic Tokyo fire department with firefighters who don&#39;t have special powers like in the supernatural firefighter series Fire Force.




          

In Firefighter Daigo, the protagonist Shun Onoda and the eponymous Daigo Toake aren&#39;t arch enemies in the present day, but Shun is undoubtedly bitter towards Daigo and jealous of an amazing rescue effort he performs that trumps his own during a daring rescue. This dynamic has persisted throughout the current five episodes, which have all been part of a major flashback like Berserk and Gungrave. Although named after Daigo, the series clearly stars Shun who is portrayed as the perpetual underdog in relation to his rival and who always obsesses over Daigo&#39;s successes and his own failures. However, both of them are just normal firefighters, even though they are able to perform 750 consecutive squats after holding themselves up between two walls for 30 minutes.





 The Overabundance of Firefighting Facts Surprisingly Takes a Backseat 
Firefighter Daigo pays close attention to its character interactions
          

Like most anime that revolve around a certain subject like sports series, Firefighter Daigo delves into the nuances and mechanics of firefighting to an absurd degree, going so far as to provide visual labels for firefighting equipment. However, the true focus is not on the actual firefighting, but the rivalry between Daigo and Shun. And it&#39;s essentially one-sided. When Shun tries to get closer to Daigo, undoubtedly in an attempt to learn what his weakness is, Daigo appears to be completely unaware of who Shun is when Shun has been perpetually influenced by everything Daigo does. Daigo&#39;s aloofness and emotional superiority shines early on when he actually rejects Shun&#39;s fake friendship. It isn&#39;t until a very real and potentially fatal training scenario that the two connect, because Daigo is impressed by Shun&#39;s heroism and ambitious nature.




As demonstrated in Daigo&#39;s rejection of Shun, he&#39;s not only the best firefighter physically, but a better person. Daigo appears to be driven more by a desire to help others other than jealousy and is truly impressed by and respects those who put others before themselves without any ulterior motives. By comparison, Shun is egotistical and has more selfish reasons behind his actions, though, he is still motivated to help others and truly does care for victims. Daigo is therefore depicted as that unreachable goal that will always remain elusive, and since Shun is obviously the main protagonist, the viewer is left having to contend with failure after failure. The current and latest fifth episode also adds another intriguing layer to their already highly nuanced dynamic. After Daigo goes above and beyond to save a victim during Shun&#39;s first mission, Shun performs his own act of heroism that protects everyone. While courageous and potentially fatal, it still feels insignificant next to Daigo&#39;s act of bravery, since Daigo had volunteered and willingly injured himself, while Shun had been forced into his predicament.






 Firefighter Daigo Is Plenty Unique In Its Own Right 
The anime&#39;s realistic setting and character writing sets it apart
          

Although clearly inspired by Berserk and Gungrave, Firefighter Daigo diverges from its predecessors in more than one way besides realism. The one scene in the present day doesn&#39;t allude to any sort of betrayal between its two rivals that requires the hero to seek vengeance. However, the rivalry and jealousy are still there, and in Shun&#39;s attempts to reprimand Daigo, Daigo once again demonstrates his moral superiority by being beholden only to victims and even eliminates his ego from the equation by giving most of the credit to Shun. Firefighter Daigo: Rescuer in Orange is different from other series in that nothing has ostensibly changed between Daigo and Shun&#39;s iconic rivalry from that momentous opening scene that thrust viewers into a truly memorable and all-encompassing past.
