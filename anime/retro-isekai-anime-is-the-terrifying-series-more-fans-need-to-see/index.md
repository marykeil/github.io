# Retro Isekai Anime is the Terrifying Series More Fans Need to See


## SUMMARY 



  The Twelve Kingdoms revolutionized isekai tropes with its unique storytelling style and sense of foreboding, which sets it apart from modern-day series.   The protagonist Yoko&#39;s process of getting &#34;isekai&#39;d&#34; is much more traumatizing, as she experiences random encounters that progressively worsen before fully immersing into the new world.   Unlike new isekai protagonists, Yoko doesn&#39;t have any prior knowledge or special powers, making her initial foray into the new world overwhelming and unstructured.

## Literature Review

There may be an overabundance of Isekai series today, but before it became an official genre, The Twelve Kingdoms stood out as one of the best. 




Before isekai took the anime world by storm, there were many series that told stories about normal, everyday people getting swept away into magical realms. One of the more captivating and even terrifying examples that too many people have forgotten is The Twelve Kingdoms, a 2002-03 anime that was adapted from a series of nine fantasy novels and two short story collections by author Fuyumi Ono and illustrator Akihiro Yamada.




The Twelve Kingdoms not only revolutionized isekai tropes before they were established enough to even be considered staples of the genre, but its mode of storytelling still completely diverges from the usual tone and formula of popular, modern-day series, which would cleanse the palette of anyone who watches an overabundance of isekai.

          

The immediate difference between The Twelve Kingdoms and modern-day isekai is the overall sense of foreboding that the protagonist Yoko experiences throughout the first episode, which is exacerbated by how slowly both worlds begin blending into each other. In most series today, the actual event of the hero getting &#34;isekai&#39;d&#34; to another world is rather abrupt - as exemplified by the infamous &#34;isekai truck&#34; trope. Many times, the hero trivializes their complex situation or is overjoyed at finally being isekai&#39;d themselves. This couldn&#39;t be further from what Yoko experiences herself.

 Yoko&#39;s Process of Getting &#34;Isekai&#39;d&#34; Is Much More Traumatizing 
          

To her horror, Yoko is instead haunted by random encounters that get progressively more extreme before she finally becomes fully immersed in the new world. This setup naturally prolongs her suffering and, in turn, heightens the audience&#39;s suspense as they, too, come to dread the hero getting isekai&#39;d. Yoko&#39;s overall trepidation and initial rejection of her destiny is even more nuanced than the series&#39; already unprecedented sense of foreboding when compared to today&#39;s genre. Despite the fact that her real life is falling apart, Yoko doesn&#39;t immediately let go of it. She instead clings to what she knows even as her situation worsens, which is a much more realistic and understandable reaction.

Additionally, Yoko&#39;s initial foray into the new world is much more overwhelming and less structured than what new isekai protagonists enjoy. Usually, isekai heroes get some sort of cheat or special power that separates them from everyone else in their new world. Sometimes they have the pleasure of getting a full rundown of their situation from either a god who resurrected them out of pity, a mage who summoned them, or some other helpful character. Instead, Yoko loses her guide at the onset of her adventure and is thrown into the worst situations imaginable that prevent her from even beginning the process of adapting to her new life until many episodes later.

          

Moreover, Yoko doesn&#39;t have anything to compare her current predicament to. Many modern-day isekai take place in worlds based on RPG games where the hero is familiar with the basic concepts, but Yoko doesn&#39;t have any helpful prior knowledge like this. The irony is that Yoko is joined by two other people from her original, ordinary life, and, yet, she couldn&#39;t be more alone in this new world. Although The Twelve Kingdoms does not feel like a typical isekai, it still provides the same type of escapist story that genre enthusiasts crave, but with a terrifying twist that makes it a must-watch even when compared to modern series.
