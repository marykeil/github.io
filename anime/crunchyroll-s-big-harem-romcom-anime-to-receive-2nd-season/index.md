## Literature Review

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You was one of the biggest anime of 2023, and it&#39;s set to receive a second season.




The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You is easily the biggest harem romcom anime to come to Crunchyroll in years, and, to the delight of its fans, is set to receive a second season. The fact that it’s a harem anime that followed through on its premise immediately set it apart from its contemporaries, and the great character writing, creative animation, and overall direction made the anime one of the biggest hits of the fall 2023 season.




The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You more than lived up to its hype, and it’s now set to receive a second season. Following the season finale of the anime, it was announced that The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You had a second season in production, although its premiere date was not revealed at that time.


 

The season finale did, however, give an idea of how far season 2 will adapt the manga, and if it keeps to that sort of trajectory, then it could end up being just as great as season 1, if not greater.


 100 Girlfriends Season 2 Will Introduce Rentaro&#39;s Five Next Girlfriends 
          




While The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You season 2’s release date is still unknown, it’s easy enough to guess what will be adapted from the manga. The season 1 finale ended with a montage of five different girls: Kurumi Haraga, Mei Meido, Iku Sutou, Mimimi Utsukushisugi, and Meme Kakure. Even for someone who hasn’t read the manga, it’s clear that said girls are Rentaro’s next five girlfriends, which means that, in all likelihood, The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You season 2 will go at least as far as introducing Rentaro’s 11th girlfriend.

Going off of that, it’s also easy to predict the specific point that season 2 will end at. If season 2 will only go as far as introducing Rentaro’s 11th girlfriend, then in terms of overall story content, The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You season 2 should go up to the end of volume #6 of the manga and end on the “Tsundere Lost” arc. Season 1 covered everything up until the final chapter of volume #3, so assuming that season 2 will have the same number of episodes, it would make the most sense for it to go that far.






 100 Girlfriends Season 2 Will Be Even Better Than Season 1 

 

One of the biggest things to get excited about with season 2 is how it’s likely to be even better than season 1. The content season 2 is bound to adapt is when the series starts to truly flesh out the characters, focusing not just on how Rentaro plays off his girlfriends, but how the girlfriends play off each other. It’s at that point when The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You’s cast truly starts feeling like they have great chemistry with each other, and seeing it all play out in animation on Crunchyroll is sure to take the series to even greater heights.
