## Literature Review

2023 has been a big year for anime and manga alike, and some new series stood out even in that overcrowded market.




2023 was a great year for manga, especially with all of the new manga published in 2023. While the year hasn’t had a lot of manga that immediately took off with fans and critics alike, there have still been plenty of great new stories to come out that will hopefully be around for years to come.
There have been a lot of new manga to be released in 2023, and a few in particular stand out as some of the best. Some new manga stand out for how inventive they are with their stories and giving people something new to read. Conversely, others are noteworthy for how well they execute older ideas, whether it’s through their art, writing, or a combination of the two.
        

Whatever the case, 2023 has produced plenty of noteworthy manga for people to read, and each one is bound to leave its mark on the manga community for years to come.









 








 10  Martial Master Asumi Brings A Classic Genre Back To Shōnen Jump 
Manga by Kawada, published in Weekly Shōnen Jump
        

The first great new manga to be published in 2023 is Kawada’s Martial Master Asumi. Just like Kawada’s previous work, Hinomaru Sumo, Martial Master Asumi thrives on its realistic exploration of the world of professional martial arts with incredible art to bring each fight to life, and the engaging human drama surrounding it all makes every chapter great to read. Recent revelations of the series taking place in the same universe as Hinomaru Sumo add even more intrigue to its story, and with any luck, Martial Master Asumi will have just as much freedom to develop its story, going further.

 9  Kill Blue Is Kuroko’s Basketball’s Author’s Next Big Hit 
Manga by Tadatoshi Fujimaki, published in Weekly Shōnen Jump
        

Another great new manga from a veteran Weekly Shōnen Jump author is Tadatoshi Fujimaki’s Kill Blue. Fujimaki is best known for writing Kuroko’s Basketball, and that same level of charm is used to create a hilarious assassin-based comedy with great action scenes and surprisingly heartfelt moments about the simple joys of life. Fujimaki’s previous work Robot x Laserbeam was canceled after only a year and was never given a chance to truly take off, so it’s great to see Kill Blue turning out to be such a great manga, and it will hopefully find even more success in the future.

 8  Beat &amp; Motion Is A Beautiful Metafictional Story To Behold 
Manga by Naoki Fujitam published on Manga Plus
        

Manga Plus has become a great home to many alternative types of manga, and a great new manga to come out of it is Naoki Fujita’s Beat &amp; Motion. Beat &amp; Motion does a wonderful job of exploring the creative process of both music and animation from an amateur level, and going off of that, it constructs s beautiful narrative about the emotional stress behind being a creative and how it can affect someone both positively and negatively, making the story both informative and heartfelt. Beat &amp; Motion was published after winning a big contest to find the next big manga, and it more than earned that level of prestige.

 7  My Girlfriend Gives Me Goosebumps Reinvents The Yandere Trope 
Manga by Shunsuke Iinom published on Manga Plus
        

Another great new manga to come out of Manga Plus is Shunsuke Iino’s My Girlfriend Gives Me Goosebumps. The series works off the hook of the protagonist, Haruka, knowing that his girlfriend, Kisaki, is a yandere, a girl with a violent possessiveness towards the person she loves, and the fact that Haruka actually wants her to be somewhat psychotic, in addition to Kisaki not being completely psychotic, makes for a surprisingly wholesome romance. The yandere love interest is often the hardest for a story to sell, but the fact that Iino can make it work helps the series stand out a lot among its contemporaries.

 6  Magical Girl Tsubame Is Giving PPPPPP’s Author Another Chance To Shine 
Manga by Mapollo 3, published on Manga Plus


 







A third great new manga to debut on Manga Plus is Mapollo 3’s Magical Girl Tsubame: I Will (Not) Save The World! The series has a truly surreal take on magical girls in a similar vein to Puella Magi Madoka Magica that’s perfectly complemented by Mapollo 3’s unique art style, and the underlying mystery element makes every chapter a delight to read as it all slowly unravels to both reveal new truths and set up new mysteries. Mapollo 3’s previous manga, PPPPPP, was canceled before it had a chance to take off, but it’s great to see that they’ve made a new story that caters to their strengths even better.

 5  Samurai In Another World Adds New Life To The Isekai Genre 
Manga by Keigo Saito, published on Comic Walker


 







There are plenty of great new manga to be published outside of the Shonen Jump label, and one particularly great one is Keigo Saito’s Samurai in Another World. The story follows the typical framework of an isekai series with an overpowered protagonist having to fight evil in another world, but not only is Ginko’s power almost always played for laughs, it’s also made to be a point of frustration for her as it keeps her from having a warrior’s death. Add in some stellar art and fight choreography, and it does a great job of adding life to a very tired genre and is something any isekai fan should read.
This series is not yet available in English.

 4  Bocchi The Rock!’s Spinoff Manga Puts One Of Its Best Characters In The Spotlight 
Manga by Kumichou, published on Comic Fuz
        

Another great new manga not connected to Shonen Jump is Kumichou’s Bocchi the Rock! Gaiden: Hiroi Kikuri’s Heavy Drinking Diary. As the title would imply, Bocchi the Rock! Gaiden: Hiroi Kikuri’s Heavy Drinking Diary is a Bocchi the Rock! spinoff focused on Hiroi Kikuri’s daily life, and it does a great job of fleshing out her character to both emphasize her tragic elements and show why people respect her despite all of the crazy things she does. Add in some great art and a good slew of Easter eggs, and the manga is an excellent addition to Bocchi the Rock!’s ever-growing franchise.
This series is not yet available in English. 






 3  A Love Yet To Bloom Is A Beautiful Slow Burn For Yuri Fans 
Manga by Kon Fukaumi, published on COMIC Ogyaaa!!
        

In terms of LGBTQ&#43; content, a great new manga for yuri fans is Kon Fukaumi’s A Love Yet To Bloom. The manga is a classic slow burn that does a great job of developing the relationship between Takamine and Sakura as they find a connection in each other that’s lacking in their other relationships, and Fukaumi’s soft artwork excellently emphasizes the growing tenderness between them, as well. In recent years, many anime and manga fans have started rejecting slow burns in favor of romances that take off as soon as possible, but A Love Yet To Bloom shows that there’s still plenty of merit to that sort of writing.

 2  Maria No Danzai Is An Incredibly Dark &amp; Gripping Story Of Revenge 
Manga by Kazuki and Junto Kamejima, published on Tonari No Young Jump
        

Anime and manga are no strangers to dark and bloody stories grounded in reality, and a great new manga to fall into that sort of storytelling is Kazuki and Junto Kamejima’s Maria no Danzai. Maria no Danzai takes readers through the titular protagonist’s quest for vengeance against the bullies who murdered her son, doing so with torture setups that wouldn’t be out of place in the Saw franchise. Add in some great artwork and character writing, and horror fans are bound to find a lot to like about a series that’s only just getting started with how gruesome it can be.

 1  The JOJOLands Has The Chance To Be The Best JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Story In Years 
Manga by Hiroiko Araki, published in Ultra Jump


 







The last great new manga to discuss is the latest installment in Hirohiko Araki’s JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: The JOJOLands. Araki once again switches gears to tell a story of young gangsters getting more than they bargained for with a heist, and in addition to those characters greatly hitting all of JoJo’s usual conventions, the art and fight choreography is easily some of the best and most creative to be seen in the franchise in years. The JOJOLands is already on its way to being a top-tier installment of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and it’s easy to see it as one of the best new manga of 2023.
