## Literature Review

New anime And You Thought There Is Never a Girl Online? is the unlikeliest series to tackle a powerful metaphor popularized within Sword Art Online.





This unexpected turn of events can be easily interpreted as a literal take on a metaphorical phenomenon that Sword Art Online masterfully tackled, where players get so enraptured in gaming that they get literally trapped inside the digital world. Of course, Sword Art Online portrays this psychological condition as the game literally imprisoning players, but And You Thought... explores it as the player advertently choosing to immerse themselves in the game, making them a prisoner of their inner demons.





 Is There a Difference Between Real Life &amp; Gaming? 
          

Even before the aforementioned development, this anime adaptation of the original light novel by writer Shibai Kineko and illustrator Hisas always had the potential of being a mind-bender. Serious gamers who are part of the same guild in an online RPG called Legendary Age (LA) decide to meet in real life, and while some of them have structured lives in the real world, most of them prefer playing the game. Ako Tamaki&#39;s condition is quite serious, as she has difficulties differentiating the game from real life. Of course, the first few episodes treat Ako&#39;s confusion less seriously, effectively creating the impression that the romcom anime will only be a compilation of humorous anecdotes where Ako&#39;s exploits embarrass or even traumatize her fellow guild members. While this does occur, the series begins to shift into more serious territory by tackling profound questions.




Only by episode 5 does And You Thought... effectively capture Sword Art Online&#39;s metaphor when real life becomes so traumatic for Ako that she decides to fully immerse herself in LA. Her escape from the real-world turns out to be not enough. She eventually immerses herself in such a way that her friends are incapable of connecting with her, and wouldn&#39;t have been able to if they didn&#39;t know where she lived in the real world. In essence, Ako traps herself in LA just like how the eponymous VRMMORPG in Sword Art Online prevents the 10,000 inside its mainframe cyberspace from logging out. For Ako, her mental imbalance won&#39;t allow her to stop playing, a state that would have persisted if her &#34;game husband&#34; Hideki Nishimura didn&#39;t physically involve himself.



 Reinventing Common Anime Tropes 
          




Sword Art Online&#39;s storyline initially popularized the RPG subcategory in a much broader genre known as isekai, where a character gets transported to another world. Another popular subgenre of isekai is reincarnation stories, in which the protagonist will die in the &#34;real world&#34; and be reborn into a high fantasy environment.

Incidentally, how Ako attempts to fully immerse herself in LA is through a process called reincarnation. Only gamers who quit school and/or work to devote their entire life to LA are able reach a level so high that they can transfer their stats and items to a whole new character. This particular episode is undoubtedly a nod to reincarnation anime, especially since it&#39;s currently oversaturating the entire industry to an absurd degree.

And You Thought There Is Never a Girl Online? is streaming on Crunchyroll.
