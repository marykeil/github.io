## Literature Review

2023 featured a lot of great new anime opening from both mainstream franchises and lesser known series. These are the ten best from the year.




2023 was a superb year for anime openings, releasing some of the best in recent memory. Anime openings are very important both for hooking viewers and for getting them in the right frame of mind to watch the show attached to them. However, this doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t be artistic in their own right.
Openings are a combination of animation and music that, at their best, can serve as a perfect encapsulation of their anime. An opening can thus be great in a variety of different ways. It could be the gorgeous animation that sets it apart. It could also be the awesome song that accompanies it. Or it could be the perfect synchronization of these two aspects into a better whole. Beyond the opening itself, its quality could also come from how it complements the anime that follows it. With these criteria in mind, these are the ten best anime openings in 2023.









 








 10  Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead 
Produced by Bug Films based on the manga by Haro Aso and Kotaro Takata


  Song Title   Song of the Dead    Artist   Kana-Boon    
Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead is a refreshing take on the zombie apocalypse genre, with its large cast of characters trying to live their best life in a world filled with ravenous undead. The show&#39;s opening by Kana-Boon matches the joy and optimism of this concept while also infusing typical zombie tropes like blood splatter and gore with color and brightness. It also does a good job at showing viewers the personalities of its main cast of characters as they dance along to the show&#39;s infectious anthem. While Zom 100 is currently on an indefinite hiatus, it at least left fans with one of the best openings of the year.
The opening has two versions, but the second more complete version is much better

 9  Undead Girl Murder Farce 
Produced by Lapin Track based on the novels by Yugo Aosaki


  Song Title   Crack-Crack-Crackle    Artist   Classy    
Undead Girl Murder Farce is one of 2023&#39;s best hidden gems. It follows a half-oni named Tsugaru who accepts a job from the immortal head Aya to find her missing body. This leads to them traveling across Victorian-era Europe and solving a variety of supernatural mysteries. The opening reflects how fun and wild this concept can be by merging multiple different styles together and highlighting all the various famous characters who appear in the series. The song by Classy is also great at capturing the strange but compelling nature of the world and plot. Seeing the gorgeous imagery and iconic characters in the opening is guaranteed to cause viewers to want to watch more, which is the sign of a superb OP.

 8  Vinland Saga 
Produced by MAPPA based on the manga by Makoto Yukimura


  Song Title   River    Artist   Anonymouz    
Vinland Saga is a modern anime classic about a viking named Thorfinn who initially sets out to get revenge on the man who killed his father, but then must atone for all the lives he took on his journey. The second season&#39;s first opening is a great representation of that. It seamlessly transitions from one morbid detail to the next, representing Thorfinn&#39;s inability to move past the trauma he has caused. While time flows onwards like a river, carrying many of the series’ other characters like a bloodied king Canute and the fellow slave Einar, Thorfinn is drowning in the mud, dragged down by his many victims, represented by a chain of bloody arms. The symbolic nature of the opening makes it darkly beautiful, just like the show itself.
Vinland Saga&#39;s other opening of 2023 is also superb

 7  Spy x Family 
Produced by WIT Studio and CloverWorks based on the manga by Tatsuya Endo


  Song Title   Kura Kura    Artist   Ado    
Spy x Family is a fun show about a spy, assassin, and telepath all living together as a found family. Seeing the Forger family interact with each other and use their unique skills is incredibly entertaining. The show&#39;s newest opening captures the fun of their relationship beautifully. Not only is it animated in a goofy and expressive style that is a joy to watch but it also tells a fun and fantastical story about the lengths the Forgers will go to make tea. It&#39;s also sung by Ado, who sang Uta&#39;s songs in One Piece Film: Red. While some viewers may find it too chaotic, it is precisely this frenetic energy that makes both it and the show it is attached to so great.

 6  Heavenly Delusion 
Produced by Production I.G based on the manga by Masakazu Ishiguro


  Song Title   innocent arrogance    Artist   BiSH    
Heavenly Delusion is one of the best anime of 2023. It&#39;s a cryptic show, alternating between the post-apocalyptic journey of Maru and Kiruko and a mysterious school. While the opening mainly focuses on the former storyline, it does still hint at the latter through subtle symbolism. This symbolism makes the opening almost Evangelion-esque in the best way possible. However, while these teases are cool and hint at the overall nature of the show, what truly makes this opening great is the utterly beautiful animation. The animation looks incredibly realistic and yet slightly off at the same time, giving it a slightly unnerving feel, just like the show itself.

 5  Jujutsu Kaisen 
Produced by MAPPA based on the manga by Gege Akutami


  Song Title   Ao no Sumika    Artist   Tatsuya Kitani    
Jujutsu Kaisen released two great openings this year, but the first is just slightly better than the second. The opening is framed as being part of Gojo’s memories as he thinks back to his quest with Geto to save Riko from the brutal mercenary Toji. Seeing all of the characters having fun with each other before the tragic events at the end of the arc is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. However, the wonderful song and animation makes it an enjoyable watch that features an incredibly interesting fight not shown in the anime itself. All this makes it not only better than the more depressing second OP but also makes it one of the best openings in 2023.

 4  Demon Slayer 
Produced by Ufotable based on the manga by Koyoharu Gotouge


  Song Title   Kizuna no Kiseki    Artist   MAN WITH A MISSION and milet    
Demon Slayer is one of the most gorgeously animated Shonen series ever made and its openings generally reflect that. The opening for the Swordsmith Village arc takes things to another level though in the ways in synchronizes its animation and music. Tying the beats of the song to the blows of a hammer crafting swords is a brilliant decision that allows the location of the arc to be an integral part of the opening. And of course, just like with Demon Slayer’s previous openings, the fights featured in the OP is also incredibly exciting and well-animated.

 3  Hell’s Paradise 
Produced by MAPPA based on the manga by Yuji Kaku


  Song Title   Work    Artist   Ringo Sheena and Millennium Parade    
Hell’s Paradise has a large cast of characters and its opening does a great job of introducing viewers to them in an engaging way. The transitions from character to character are incredibly smooth and creative, which makes this opening exciting and easy to watch. The song by Ringo Sheena and Millennium Parade also beautifully captures both the cynicism and hope of the various criminals sent to find the elixir of life. This makes the entire opening a darkly beautiful encapsulation of the entire show and easily one of the best openings of 2023.

 2  Undead Unluck 
Produced by David Production based on the manga by Yshifumi Tozuka


  Song Title   01    Artist   Queen Bee    
Undead Unluck is a show that pushes the boundaries of what normal Shonen series can do, so it only makes sense that its opening is just as chaotic. Flashing quickly between psychedelic images and important characters or plot points, the opening gives viewers enough glimpses of the world of negators and UMAs to have a general idea of its weirdness without spoiling any major details. In many ways this lets viewers sympathize more with Fuuko, the protagonist of the series who is thrust into a conflict she doesn’t understand. This combined with its excellent song by Queen Bee makes Undead Unluck’s opening one that stands out above the rest.

 1  Oshi no Ko 
Produced by Doga Kobo based on the manga by Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari


  Song Title   Idol    Artist   YOASOBI    
The idol anime Oshi no Ko took the anime community by storm in 2023 for good reason. It is an exciting look at the dark and practical realities under the glamorous image of the entertainment industry. The opening song Idol by Yoasobi reflects that brilliantly, being an upbeat pop song with dark undertones. It is also sung from the perspective of a character who doesn’t have much screentime in the show itself, but who is vitally important, and this opening thus gives her more presence in the anime. The deep meaning of the song plus the stunning visuals showing off the main characters combine to make Oshi no Ko’s OP the best anime opening of 2023.
Oshi no Ko&#39;s opening also has an English version
