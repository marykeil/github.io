# Dragon Ball Supers Cell Max Is Pathetic Next To Cells True Successor


## SUMMARY 



  Lord Luud from Dragon Ball GT is a better successor to Cell than Cell Max in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero.   Both Lord Luud and Cell share similar characteristics and weaknesses, but exploiting Luud&#39;s weakness is much harder.   Cell Max was eventually overpowered, while defeating Lord Luud requires deliberate and precise attacks both from inside and outside his body.

## Literature Review

Cell Max was immensely powerful in Dragon Ball Super, but compared to Cell&#39;s &#39;true successor&#39; in Dragon Ball GT, Cell Max is absolutely pathetic. 




Cell Max is a character who was introduced in the film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero as the successor to DBZ’s Cell. However, many fans may not know that Dragon Ball GT already introduced the perfect Cell successor many years before Cell Max ever hit the scene.




In Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the Red Ribbon Army is making its resurgence, and just like in the original Dragon Ball series, the regime is going to rely heavily on Android fighters. So, the grandson of Dr. Gero -Dr. Hedo - is recruited to build these next-gen Androids for the Red Ribbon Army, and he is given complete and total autonomy in the design and function of his creations.

          

However, the only thing Dr. Hedo is being forced to create is a brand-new version of Cell known as Cell Max, as the original was so powerful, he nearly brought the entire world to its knees single-handedly - and Hedo follows those instructions to perfection.


 Lord Luud is Cell’s True Successor, Not Cell Max 
          




In Dragon Ball GT season 1, episode 14 (written by Toshinobu Ooi, directed by Osamu Kasai, produced by Toei Animation), Goku, Trunks, and Pan find themselves in a strange world run by a cult that worships an entity known as Lord Luud.

While Luud is originally believed to be a God of Destruction not dissimilar to Lord Beerus, it is eventually revealed that Luud is no more than an Android created by the villainous Dr. Myuu (a villain who is incredibly similar to Dr. Gero in both character design and motivation). Lord Luud is what’s known as a Machine Mutant, which is an alien android that is far superior to any robot developed on Earth, including Cell and Cell Max.



 Lord Luud Has The Same Weakness As Cell &amp; Cell Max, But It&#39;s WAY Harder To Exploit 
         

Once it is revealed that Lord Luud is essentially a super android and not a space god, the similarities between him and Cell become incredibly clear. Both are androids created to be the strongest in the universe by creators who are nearly identical, both get their power by absorbing others, and - perhaps most importantly - they both share the same weakness. Just as Cell can only be killed if one cell in his head is destroyed, Lord Luud also has a cell in his body that acts as a weak point - though Luud’s weakness is far more difficult to exploit. The only way to defeat Luud is to have someone who has been absorbed by him to blast the vulnerable cell from inside Luud’s body, while someone has to simultaneously blast that exact same spot on his body from the outside.




While Cell Max also shared this weakness with the original Cell and Lord Luud, he wasn’t given Luud’s upgraded treatment as Cell Max was eventually simply overpowered the same way Cell was. With Luud, the attack had to be deliberate and precise–making him similar enough to Cell to make a cohesive comparison while also proving to be an upgraded version, which is why Dragon Ball GT’s Lord Luud is a far better Cell successor than Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero’s Cell Max.
