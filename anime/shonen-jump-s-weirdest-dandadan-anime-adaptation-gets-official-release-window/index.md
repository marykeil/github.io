## Literature Review

Shonen Jump&#39;s weirdest ongoing series Dandadan&#39;s anime adaptation from Science Saru finally received a release window during Jump Festa.




One of Shonen Jump&#39;s big hitters, Yukinobu Tatsu&#39;s Dandadan, was announced to be receiving an anime adaptation from Science Saru earlier in the year, and during Jump Festa, the series received a new teaser trailer unveiling the official release window. The anime for this hit mystery manga has been long overdue, building a loyal and large fanbase over the years that is undoubtedly overjoyed by this project.




The anime had a panel at this year&#39;s Jump Festa where the voice cast of the anime were revealed alongside the new trailer. Although short, the trailer had fans in a frenzy, especially because of how faithful the anime was to the manga.


 

After being confirmed to be in production on November 27, the Dandadan anime adaptation is set to be released during October 2024.

                  Shonen Jump&#39;s Big Event Will Stream Internationally In English   Jump Festa, the big year-end event of Shonen Jummp&#39;s publisher Shueisha, will stream for the second time internationally, now in English too.

The teaser trailer expands on the first video released when the anime was confirmed, showcasing more of the hectic relationship between the main characters. The trailer gives a glimpse of what the first few chapters would look like in the anime, animating the first adventure of Momo and Okarun that flips their world upside down. The visuals and animation look gorgeous, but that is to be expected when you realize who is making the anime. However, the main point of praise is how the coloring and art style are captured perfectly in the anime, making the series more authentic.

Science SARU, the studio behind Devilman Crybaby and the recent Scott Pilgrim Takes Off anime, will be producing Dandadan. An interesting choice, Science SARU&#39;s dynamic and fluid animation style is perfect for Dandadan&#39;s over-the-top plot and action sequences. The two main characters will be voiced by Shion Wakayama (Takina from Lycoris Recoil) and Natsuki Hanae (Tanjiro from Demon Slayer), who will play Momo and Okarun respectively. Luffy&#39;s voice actor Mayumi Tanaka will voice Turbo Granny and her colleague from One Piece, Kazuya Nakai, who voices Zoro, will be playing Alien.




                  Suicide Squad, One Piece, &amp; Solo Leveling: 2024&#39;s 10 Most Anticipated Anime   2024 promsies a robust catalogue of brand new anime to keep fans&#39; watch-lists full during the new year, including highly anticipated titles.   

Quite possibly one of the weirdest series in Shonen Jump, Dandadan follows two high school students, Okarun and Momo, who both set out on a journey to prove that either ghosts or aliens exist. Where it gets interesting is that Okaru&#39;s genitals are stolen after an adventure, leading to both setting out to restore Okaru&#39;s manhood. With both spending a lot of time together, they start to develop feelings for each other, adding an element of romance to an already unique anime. As confusing as it is entertaining, Dandadan is already one of the most anticipated anime of 2024, even though it was recently announced.
