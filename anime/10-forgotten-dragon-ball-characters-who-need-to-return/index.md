## SUMMARY

 Raditz, Goku&#39;s estranged brother, played a small role in Dragon Ball Z despite his significance. Reviving him would create a compelling plot point.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball has had countless memorable characters over the years. However, there are so much more characters who are due their own grand return.




The Dragon Ball franchise has amassed countless characters since it was first created by Akira Toryiama in 1984, but not all of them have gotten the spotlight they deserved. Being spread over manga, several anime series, movies, video games and so much more, characters, like Goku or Freiza, are some of the most instantly recognizable figures to come out of Japanese culture. The battle shonen series had a major influence on the popularization of manga and anime in the Western world, and to this day it is still going strong.
However, over the years, there have been so many characters in Dragon Ball that have come and gone without proper explanation, closure, or being fully developed. In addition to heroes who just up and vanished, there are also countless allies, antagonists, and outright villains who could potentially return due to the life-giving power of the Dragon Balls. Dragon Ball&#39;s best forgotten characters all could add a lot to the story with their reintroduction.









 








 10  Launch - Tien Shinhan&#39;s Forgotten Love Interest 
Dragon Ball Chapter 26 &amp; Episode 15
        

Launch was a major character throughout Dragon Ball who disappeared without explanation when the series continued as Dragon Ball Z. This was apparently because the manga’s creator Akira Toryiama simply forgot about her. The love interest of Tien Shinhan, Launch had two distinct personalities that she would switch between every time she sneezed. One was a pure-hearted blue-haired woman while the other was a hot-tempered gun-wielding blonde. Having played a regular role in the earlier series, her unexplained omission left viewers puzzled. While there were very scant glimpses of her in later sagas, a true return of her character to the series would be most welcome.





 9  Raditz - Goku&#39;s Estranged Brother 
Dragon Ball Chapter 195 &amp; Dragon Ball Z Episode 1


 







As Goku’s long-lost brother it was strange that Raditz did not play a bigger role in the overall story of Dragon Ball Z. Being killed by Goku and Piccolo in the earliest part of the series, his actions are the catalyst for everything that would follow it. It is surprising that he was not revived at some point, as with such a direct link to the series protagonist, the estranged brother’s dynamic between Raditz and Goku would make for a compelling plot point. It would also be a great opportunity to showcase what would happen to Raditz&#39;s long hair if he ever turned Super Saiyan.





 8  Nappa - Vegeta&#39;s Partner in Crime 
Dragon Ball Chapter 204 &amp; Dragon Ball Z Episode 2


 







As Vegeta’s partner in combat, there are a lot of interesting unexplored potential plot points between Nappa and the Saiyan Prince. After being defeated by Goku in the Saiyan Saga, Vegeta viewed him as weak and kills him. Considering Vegeta’s ultimate redemption, there is a lot of room to explore themes of shame, guilt, and regret when it comes to the untimely killing of his former planet-conquering partner. A revived Nappa would force Vegeta to confront his murderous past and would act as an excellent way to deal with the Saiyans&#39; genocidal legacy.





 7  Nail - Namek&#39;s Greatest Warrior 
Dragon Ball Chapter 251 &amp; Dragon Ball Z Episode 53
        

The great Namekian warrior Nail was an interesting glimpse into the powerful potential of the alien race that includes antagonist turned-hero Piccolo. Having fused with Piccolo during the Freiza saga, Nail was never fully fleshed out, and it always felt like a missed opportunity to add some more depth to the lore of the Namekians. The fan-based parody Dragon Ball Abridged found a good way to utilize Nail as part of Piccolo&#39;s internal monologue, but unfortunately, in the series, Nail had served his purpose by acting as a power-up for Piccolo and was no longer needed.





 6  Maron - Krillen&#39;s Ex-Girlfriend 
Dragon Ball Z Episode 108
        

Maron was Krillen’s anime-only ex-girlfriend who appeared throughout the filler Garlic Jr. Saga. With long-blue hair, the character bore a striking resemblance to Bulma. Her reintroduction to the series would offer a good opportunity to explore Krillen’s past and the growth his character has undergone since their relationship. It would also allow the series to once and for all address the similarity between Maron&#39;s name and the daughter Krillen has with Android 18 named Marron. While the character was not created by Akira Toryiama and is strictly non-canon, she was referenced in Dragon Ball Super, making her return more than possible.





 5  Future Bulma - The Inventor of Trunks&#39; Time Machine 
Dragon Ball Chapter 348 &amp; Dragon Ball Z Episode 132
        

A lot of Dragon Ball content focuses on Future Trunks with very little attention given to his potentially more interesting mother Future Bulma. Having invented the time machine that allowed Future Trunks to travel to the past, she has obviously reached a level of technological advancement far superior to her present-day self. Sadly, Future Bulma meets an untimely death at the hands of Goku Black in Dragon Ball Super, but if she were to be revived, there is incredible potential and to see her interact, engage, and share knowledge with her luckier past self.





 4  Pikkon - The Other World fighter 
Dragon Ball Z Episode 195
        

Pikkon is a fighter of the Other World introduced in the filler Other World Saga who showcases his ability by defeating Cell, Frieza, King Cold, and members of the Ginyu Force in Hell. Pikkon strikes up a friendship with Goku and the two face off against one another in the Other World Tournament. As a skilled fighter whose appearance was heavily influenced by Piccolo, Pikkon’s role as a warrior who continued to train even after death adds substance to what is possible in the Other World, and further adventures with the character there could add to its relevance in later arcs of the series.





 3  Dabura - The King of the Demon Realm 
Dragon Ball Chapter 446 &amp; Dragon Ball Z Episode 220
        

Dabura is the thousand-year-old King of the Demon Realm. When he first appears in the Majin Buu Saga, it looked like he was set be a main antagonist for the Z Fighters. Then, without much warning, he is defeated, turned into a cookie, and eaten by Majin Buu. Dabura was removed from the series before his backstory was properly fleshed out. His reappearance would act as a chance to explore the barely mentioned Demon Realm, and showcase a new dimension to the world of Dragon Ball.





 2  Tarble - Vegeta&#39;s Mild-Mannered Brother 
DRagon Ball: The Return of Son Goku and Friends!


 







Tarble is Vegeta’s estranged younger brother who first appeared in the original video animation Dragon Ball: The Return of Son Goku and Friends! A gentle and polite Saiyan, he is in stark contrast to his brash and boisterous older brother and, having only made a brief appearance in the series is due a major return considering his close relationship with Vegeta. As the last living Saiyan to still have his tail, a future Tarble Dragon Ball storyline could be used to explore the Saiyan’s ability to transform into the Ōzaru great ape at the sight of a full moon. This is one of the most significant traits of Saiyans that became less relevant as the series developed.





 1  Omega Shenron - Dragon Ball GT&#39;s Final Foe 
Dragon Ball GT Episode 57
        

Omega Shenron is the last of the Shadow Dragons to appear in Dragon Ball GT, the result of Syn Shenron absorbing all the Dragon Balls. He is the physical personification of all the negative energy stored within the wish-granting balls. While Dragon Ball GT is not considered canon, Omega Shenron was one of the biggest threats anyone ever faced in the world of Dragon Ball and his reappearance would act as a good opportunity to flesh his character out more and make up for some of the more disappointing writer&#39;s mistakes in Dragon Ball GT.
