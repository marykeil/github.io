# New Crunchyroll Anime Has a Breathtaking Use For Reverse Isekai


## SUMMARY 



  Doctor Elise: The Royal Lady with the Lamp is a unique anime that subverts the typical use of Isekai by combining it with time travel and a redemption story.   The protagonist, Elise, is a surgeon in the modern world who is trying to atone for her past life as an evil princess in a fantasy world. When she dies again and goes back in time in her original world, she uses her surgical skills as a way to make up for her previous actions.   The debut episode creates a touching reunion for Elise as she goes back in time and is able to see her family again, adding emotional depth to the story. This mix of genres makes Doctor Elise one of the most original anime of the season.

## Literature Review

Doctor Elise: The Royal Lady with the Lamp is both a time-traveling and reverse Isekai series, and the effect in its debut episode is magnificent. 




Warning: Spoilers for Doctor Elise: The Royal Lady with the Lamp episode #1Although the majority of its debut episode documents the events in a reverse Isekai world, Crunchyroll&#39;s Doctor Elise: The Royal Lady with the Lamp is essentially a time-traveling reincarnation series that uses Isekai as a stepping stone to augment the overall journey from the present day to the past. The execution is truly breathtaking and completely subverts how most series normally use any form of Isekai.




An adaptation of Yuin&#39;s web novel, the linear events of Doctor Elise&#39;s unchronological format tell the story of an eponymous protagonist who was actually born in a fantasy world as an evil princess whose cruelty leads to her family getting executed and herself hanged. But instead of ceasing to exist, she is reincarnated into the modern world, where she lives for a number of years as a surgeon.

          

These are events that take place before the anime begins, which is a day before her untimely death. Doctor Elise fills in these holes through the use of flashbacks, where the eponymous protagonist reflects on her current and former lives. The episode then ends with Elise&#39;s untimely death, allowing her to go back in time to when her family is still alive.





 Doctor Elise Provides A Rare &#34;Double Atonement&#34; 
Based on the web novel by Yuin
          

This structuring is incredibly effective because of how Elise views her current life in relation to her first. As a surgeon, she sees herself as atoning for her crimes as an evil princess. However, no matter how many lives she saves, it will never be enough. Elise&#39;s family was still executed because of her actions, and her atonement is taking place in a completely different world that benefits other people, not the ones she wronged. With the plot twist of Elise dying again and going back in time, the episode ends with the poignant revelation that she will finally get a third and more effective chance to atone for her sins.

This compelling image of a double atonement is complemented by its subversion of what most Isekai protagonists do. Although it has yet to happen, the anime&#39;s title implies that Elise will take the impossible skills she wouldn&#39;t have been able to learn in her fantasy world and use them to truly atone for her crimes. In the fantasy world, her surgical skills will be god-like for obvious reasons. This is also a fun flip of the norm, as Isekai protagonists almost always take what they learned from their original lives in the modern world to benefit themselves in the Isekai fantasy land.




          

The structure of the debut episode also allowed the anime to create a more touching reunion. In most conventional time-traveling reincarnations, the debut episode effectively captures the protagonist&#39;s overall shock and sense of loss after getting reborn. By comparison, Doctor Elise&#39;s unique situation causes her to see her family again, making that reunion incredibly heartfelt. Through the cunning reuse of common genre tropes, Doctor Elise mixes reverse Isekai and time travel to create one of the most original anime of the 2024 season.
