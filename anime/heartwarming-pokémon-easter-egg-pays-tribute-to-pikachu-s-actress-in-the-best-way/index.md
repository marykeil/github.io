# Heartwarming Pokémon Easter Egg Pays Tribute to Pikachu s Actress in the Best Way


## SUMMARY 



  Pikachu&#39;s voice actress, Ikue Ohtani, was honored in a Pokémon XY episode with a cameo appearance as a character who resembles her and dubs over Pikachu&#39;s footage.   In the Japanese version of the episode, the character voiced by Ohtani speaks in Japanese, further connecting her to Pikachu&#39;s voice. This connection is not present in the English dub.   Ohtani is one of the few main cast Pokémon voice actors from the original series to transfer over to Pokémon Horizons, where she now voices Captain Pikachu. Her inclusion in the anime is a tribute to her contributions to the Pokémon franchise.

## Literature Review

Pikachu&#39;s voice actress, Ikue Ohtani, has voiced the character since the first episode of the Pokémon anime, and the show honored her with a cameo.




Pikachu is one of the most iconic elements of the Pokémon anime, and that&#39;s largely thanks to his voice actress, Ikue Ohtani, who helped to breathe life into the likable electric mouse over the last 25 years. The series actually honored Ms. Ohtani in one episode, giving a rare nod to the production side of the anime.




In the Pokémon XY episode &#34;Lights! Camera! Pika!&#34;, Ash and friends find themselves in what appears to be a town full of Pikachu, but turns out to be a movie set. The eccentric director is obsessed with Pikachu, and is busy filming a movie starring only Pikachu. He takes a shine to Ash&#39;s Pikachu in particular and offers him the lead role, that of Super Pikachu, a superhero who stands against the villains.

          

Ash and friends help to film the movie, and they get to see a behind-the-scenes look at the post-production process, which includes voice actors dubbing over the Pikachu--one of whom is a dead ringer for Ikue Ohtani.

                  Pokémon Horizons&#39; Pikachu isn&#39;t Just Great, He&#39;s The Reboot&#39;s Best Character   Even early on in Pokémon Horizons, it&#39;s immediately clear that Captain Pikachu will be a highlight.   





 Pikachu&#39;s Voice Actress Has A Heart-Warming Cameo In Pokèmon XY 
          

In the scene, the character who resembles Ikue Ohtani is actually dubbing over the Pikachu footage from earlier in the episode. In the Japanese version of the episode, when the edited movie is shown to the viewers at home, &#34;Super&#34; Pikachu speaks in full Japanese and is voiced by Ikue Ohtani, suggesting that the character who resembles her shares her voice as well. That connection is obviously broken in the English dub, since she wasn&#39;t around to record English dialog, but it cements that this character is indeed intended to be a cameo by Pikachu&#39;s long-time voice actress. Another voice actor in the scene is said to resemble Clemont&#39;s Japanese voice, Yuuki Kaji.

It&#39;s rare for Ms. Ohtani to voice characters besides Pikachu (the only major character being Ash&#39;s XY rival, Sawyer), and she is one of the only main cast Pokémon voice actors from the original series to transfer over to Pokémon Horizons, where she&#39;s now voicing Captain Pikachu, as well as the villain Sango. It&#39;s fair to say that the Pokémon anime wouldn&#39;t be the same without the energy she brings to the role, so it&#39;s great to see her honored with an Easter egg-style inclusion in the anime like this. If one didn&#39;t know what Ikue Ohtani looked like, it would certainly be an easy reference to miss, but for those who do, it&#39;s obvious.




          

The Pokémon games have often paid tribute to big names in their development by including them in the game as challenging trainers. It only seems fair to do the same for the anime side of things, and there&#39;s no bigger name than Ikue Ohtani&#39;s, who has also provided Pikachu&#39;s voice in the games and other media. For someone who has helped to shape one of the most popular characters ever created, yet who is not nearly as well-known as Pikachu, an animated cameo like this is a neat way to pay homage to Pokémon&#39;s most beloved voice actress.
