## Literature Review

Many anime titles are quite the mouthful, describing their premises in great detail. The longest grab viewers&#39; attention immediately.




Most anime fans have heard of an anime with a ridiculously long title. Many light novels — a versatile genre of literature popular in Japan — are often cited for starting the long title trend, and with many of them having been adapted to anime, the trend has bled into a new medium.
These series are typically abbreviated by their fans to save time, but their original, overly-descriptive titles are a quirky charm point that keep anime and light novel fans interested. Whether the title gives a far too detailed explanation of the plot, or asks its audience a question that may or may not become plot-relevant later one, anime with long titles always have the potential to be infectiously fun.









 








 10  KochiKame Had A Long Title Before It Was Cool 
Based on the manga by Osamu Akimoto
        

From 2016 to 2021, KochiKame held the Guinness World Record for &#34;most volumes published for a single manga series.&#34; 

The original KochiKame manga got a head start on this trend when it was first published in 1976. Officially, the English translation of the title is KochiKame: Tokyo Beat Cops. The lengthy Japanese title, on the other hand, directly translates to: This is a Police Box in Front of Kameari Park In Katsushika Ward.
The manga and anime adaptations are episodic, focusing on Officer Kankichi “Ryo” Ryotsu’s get-rich-quick schemes. It ran in Shonen Jump magazine for 40 years, ending in 2016. Its two film adaptations in 1999 and 2003 also have long titles, staying true to its source material in more ways than one.

 9  Ascendance Of A Bookworm&#39;s Title Requires Extra Reading 
Based on the light novels written by Miya Kazuki with illustrations by You Shiina


 







Ascendance of a Bookworm and Honzuki no Gekokujou aren’t wildly long titles on their own. However, the original Japanese adds a subtitle that&#39;s longer than both of them, making the full title Ascendance of a Bookworm: I&#39;ll Stop At Nothing To Become a Librarian. One or the other would have done just as well, but protagonist Urano Motosu probably prefers it that way.
Urano&#39;s driving desire in life is to read books, which ends up crushing her — literally. Dying under a pile of books, she dreams only of ending up somewhere she can read forever. Instead, she&#39;s reincarnated in a world where only the wealthy few have access to literacy studies and books, forcing her to take matters into her own hands if she ever wants reading material again.

 8  Suppose a Kid From the Last Dungeon Reverses The Hero&#39;s Journey 
Based on the light novels written by Toshio Sato and illustrated by Nao Watanuki
        

Usually, the monsters of the final dungeon are the hardest, most horrifying test of any hero&#39;s strength. For Lloyd Belladonna, slaying them is just all in a day&#39;s work. However, he laments that he is the weakest of his famously powerful village, and seeks to prove himself by journeying far away and joining the army.
Suppose a Kid from the Last Dungeon Boonies Moved to a Starter Town? is a question, but the answer is exactly what everyone expected: because of his lifetime of experience fighting the toughest creatures the kingdom has to offer, he&#39;s outrageously strong compared to the other rookie soldiers. Combined with his complete lack of common knowledge as to non-final dungeon life; the show has a perfect recipe for comedy.

 7  Kaguya-sama: Love Is War Is A Hilarious Romantic Comedy 
Based on the original manga by Aka Akasaka


 







Season 4 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War is estimated to come out Spring 2024! 

Love Is War sums up the premise of Aka Akasaka&#39;s widely succesful shonen romance well enough. However, its translated original title is Kaguya Wants to be Confessed To: The Geniuses&#39; War of Love and Brains. Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are the heads of Shuchiin Academy’s student council, prodigiously skilled and intelligent in every way – except how to properly confess their feelings to one another.
Both of them are fully aware that they&#39;re in love with the other, but are exceptionally, hilariously dodgy about it. Constantly playing in-depth mind games to force the other to confess, they are each determined not to be the first one to admit their feelings. Put them together with the Academy’s other colorful characters, and it results in a modern rom-com anime classic.

 6  Anohana Brings Disconnected Friends Together 
Written by Mari Okada


 







A film sequel, &#34;A Letter to Menma,&#34; was released in August 2013. 

After the death of one of their own, a group of childhood friends drift apart, unable to mend their connection during the grieving process. Years later, they&#39;re reunited by their dead friend&#39;s ghost, who wants them to fulfill his last wish. What that wish actually is and how to fulfill it make up the core of the series while exploring the effects of unresolved guilt and grief – something that made Anohana one of the best coming of age anime during the 2010s.
The characters aren&#39;t the only ones who go by nicknames. Though the series is commonly called Anohana, meaning, That Flower, its official title is We Still Don’t Know the Name of the Flower We Saw That Day. Despite being wordier, it&#39;s even vaguer about the actual plot of the series, but makes up for it with a note of lyricism.

 5  Watamote Is Social Awkwardness Incarnate 
Based on the manga by Nico Tanigawa


Tomoko Kuroki has never been the most well-liked person, but her beloved otome games have taught her that will all change when she enters high school. However, when her perfect high school life fails to manifest, she&#39;ll do anything but reflect on herself about it. Or, as she attests in her show&#39;s full title, No Matter How I Look At It, It&#39;s You Guys&#39; Fault I&#39;m Not Popular!
Watamote is the height of self-aware cringe comedy. Tomoko is painfully awkward and insecure, subsisting off of fantasies about ideal lives rather than living her own. The show really comes into its own, though, when she resolves to venture out of her comfort zone, get lots of friends, and become a popular girl for real.

 4  WorldEnd: The Only Survivors Of The Apocalypse Are Leprechauns 
Based on the light novels written by Akira Kareno and illustrated by Ue
        

The full title of this series is WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us? the question is directed at the cryogenically frozen warrior Willem Kmetsch, who&#39;s woken up to a monster-infested apocalypse. More importantly, it&#39;s posed by the Leprechauns, the only humans left capable of fighting the Beasts that roam the earth.
WorldEnd takes itself incredibly seriously, despite its admittedly odd sounding synopsis. Willem becomes a father figure to the Leprechauns, all young girls who have been raised solely to be living weapons. Given the state of the world they live in, finding comfort and happiness is painfully difficult, but not impossible.

 3  Full Dive Takes VR Games To Dangerous Levels 
Based on the light novels written by Light Tuchihi and illustrated by Youta
        

Many isekai anime follow their heroes through fantasy game worlds. Sometimes, these heroes will have complaints about their new setting, but none are quite as loud about it as Hiroshi Yuki. The full title of his show is Full Dive: The Ultimate Next-Gen Full Dive RPG Is Even Sh%#$ier than Real Life!
Kiwame Quest was banned long ago for good reason: pain inside the game is felt even worse than in reality. Though Hiroshi plays VR games for purposes of escapism, he finds himself addicted to Kiwame Quest,even as it puts him through – literal – hell. Soon, he becomes obsessed with beating the horrific game at any cost.

 2  Demon King Puts A Twist On The Reincarnation Trope 
Based on the light novels written by Shu and illustrated by Yoshinori Shizuma
        

Though its translated title is simply The Misfit of Demon King Academy, this anime&#39;s original title goes on: The Misfit of Demon King Academy: History&#39;s Strongest Demon King Reincarnates and Goes to School With His Descendants. Anos fought for millennia to take over the world, but ultimately sacrificed his life for peace. Awaking generations later, Anos discovers that his dream is still not realized, and must start from scratch to try again.
One of the best reincarnation anime combines itself interestingly with school anime. Anos&#39; image has been distorted wildly since he first died, much to his shock, and his descendants are given special treatment among demons and still-persecuted humans. He must figure out the rules of his new world and how to finally create an equal one.

 1  Yuuri!!! On Ice&#39;s OVA Puts Yurio In The Spotlight 
Written by Sayo Yamamoto and Mitsurou Kubo
        

The ending credits of Yuuri!!! on Ice showcase Viktor and Yuuri&#39;s exhibition skate: a duo performance of Stammi Vicino. However, Yuri Plisetsky&#39;s exhibition skate is hidden in the special features of the Blu-Ray. Under a vivid pink spotlight and dressed in a sharp Gothic ensemble, Yuri skates to &#34;Welcome to the Madness&#34;, a hard rock performance directed at his fellow skater Otabek.
Yuuri!!! on Ice, like many other anime, favors long episode titles over a long show title, the longest one being from episode seven: &#34;China&#39;s On! The Grand Prix Series Opening Event!! The Cup of China Free Skate&#34;. It follows the same pattern for this OVA, whose full title is Yuuri!!! on Ice - Yuri Plisetsky GPF in Barcelona EX - Welcome to The Madness. With the OVA only lasting two minutes, the title is particularly excessive.
