## Literature Review

After some important reveals in episode #1083, One Piece episode #1084 will likely bring the official end of the extremely long Wano arc.




While it probably won&#39;t be the franchise&#39;s most exciting episode, One Piece episode #1084 will likely solve one of the anime&#39;s most compelling new mysteries. These mysteries and lore details are one of the reasons why One Piece fans love the show so it will be exciting to see another secret revealed. Beyond that, episode #1084 may also indicate where the next arc of the show will take place.

 What Happened in Episode #1083 of One Piece? 
          




Episode #1083 was a lot less action-packed than some of Wano&#39;s previous episodes but it served an important role in establishing the fates of many of its key players. After previously revealing his true identity to Robin, Sukiyaki Oden finally tells the Seven Scabbards who he actually is. This will likely have broader implications for the future of Wano as a whole now that another of the shogun&#39;s family has appeared. In addition, Dogstorm and Catviper told Carrot that they would be staying in Wano, entrusting the rule of their lands to her. Perhaps the funniest reveal of the episode though was when Kid showed Luffy that Buggy the clown had joined up with Crocodile and Mihawk to form the Cross Guild.

 One Piece Episode #1084 Will Explain How Buggy Became a Yonko 
          




Given where episode #1083 ended, it would make sense for episode #1084 to segue into revealing how the Cross Guild actually got formed and why Buggy is treated as its leader. The bumbling clown is a popular character and many fans are eager to see how he has continued to fall upwards into success. Besides that reveal, episode #1084 may also finally show where One Piece&#39;s next arc will take place, as Kid, Law, and Luffy were discussing which directions to travel near the end of episode #1083 as well. There are plenty of exciting destinations they could visit, such as the constantly teased island of Elbaf, but the Straw Hats could also go somewhere entirely new to fans.

One Piece is at an exciting turning point for the anime as it transitions out of Wano into whatever adventures come next. Seeing how the status quo of the world has shifted due to the fall of Big Mom and Kaido is important if not as exciting as the action scenes featured in the Raid on Onigashima. Hopefully, One Piece episode #1084 can cover these reveals at a satisfying pace so the anime&#39;s quality doesn&#39;t dip as the excellent and unprecedented Wano arc officially ends.
