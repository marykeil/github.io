## Literature Review

In a year loaded with epic anime, Pokémon Concierge takes a cozy approach to the end of the 2023 anime season for a great, albeit short, experience.




Netflix&#39;s latest addition to the hit Pokémon franchise, Pokémon Concierge, is the coziest way fans can end the 2023 anime season. The past year has been filled with countless hit anime. From returning favorites such as Spy x Family before the debut of its first movie Code: White, to new classics like Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, it&#39;s been a big year for anime fans overall. However, the medium proved to have one last crowd-pleaser up its sleeve with an adorable new series from the Pokémon universe.




Pokémon Concierge is the latest addition to the long-running franchise that focuses on a young woman named Haru as she adjusts to life as a new concierge for a Pokémon resort. Created by Doki Harumi and Ogaway Iku, this is a slice-of-life story that doesn&#39;t necessarily follow a season-long arc but rather takes a chill approach to its premise. There are smaller scale problems that Haru must face in each episode such as helping a shy Pikachu find their voice or getting a Magikarp their favorite pool floatie back.


 

Those looking for intense Pokémon battles will want to seek out the mainline series that came before Concierge as this short romp focuses more on the calmer side of things. However, what it lacks in action it excels in atmosphere for those looking for something simple.

Just like the resort where Haru finds herself working, Concierge has this inescapable chill feeling that makes it impossible not to smile. The sound design and atmosphere of the show have a consistent feeling of calmness that feels more therapeutic than most fans of the franchise would expect. It helps that the series was animated by Dwarf Animation Studios, who previously collaborated with Aki Kondo on the underrated Netflix anime Rilakkuma and Kaoru. The use of stop-motion in both series mixed with adorable designs of the series&#39; furrier creatures makes them unbelievably cute to watch. The animation is the true star of Concierge as audiences will get to breathe in the spectacular scenery carefully crafted by the animators, making it one of the most relaxing anime of the year that allows viewers to unwind with a simple story and breathtaking visuals.

It&#39;s difficult not to be pulled into this beautiful world lovingly crafted by Pokémon Concierge&#39;s creative team. However, once the experience is over, it will leave fans wanting more. With only four episodes, the anime sadly feels like it ends before it ever really begins. In fact, the way that the final episode ends feels like the series was a prologue to a longer series to come. There&#39;s just so much potential behind the premise of a Pokémon island resort that has been tapped into only occasionally in the main anime with the introduction of the Alola region and its Pokémon variants. Limiting this idea to just four episodes makes the series feel like it needed more time to cook in the oven. The show itself doesn&#39;t feel hollow by any means, but it passes by so fast that it can feel a little disappointing.




Even with a surprisingly brief number of episodes though, Pokémon Concierge shouldn&#39;t be missed. The likable cast of characters mixed with the breathtaking animation by Dwarf Animation Studios makes the series a must-watch, especially for those wanting to unwind after a long day. Hopefully, there will be more episodes to come in the future as new guests arrive at the island with Haru attempting to help them with their problems. Until that day though, Pokémon Concierge is a perfect cozy capper for the 2023 anime season and is destined to become a cult hit among Pokémon fans.
