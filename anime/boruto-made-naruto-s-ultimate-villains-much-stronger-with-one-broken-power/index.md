# Boruto Made Naruto s Ultimate Villains Much Stronger With One Broken Power


## SUMMARY 



  The Otsutsuki clan possesses a broken power of time travel, revealed in the Boruto anime.   The Karasuki, a turtle-like creature, enables the Otsutsuki to travel through time if enough chakra energy is available.   If not for Sasuke and Boruto&#39;s intervention, Urashiki would have succeeded in changing history by stealing Kurama&#39;s chakra from a younger Naruto.

## Literature Review

On a mission to protect the Hokage, Sasuke and Boruto learn of previously unknown Otsutsuki ability that poses an existential threat to their reality.




Despite a string of defeats, the Otsutsuki remain the strongest villains in Naruto, and as revealed in Boruto, the clan is even more powerful than they were originally believed to be thanks to an absolutely broken power only seen in the anime: time travel.




In the &#34;Time Slip Arc&#34; from the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime, Naruto tasks Sasuke and Boruto with patrolling the village for any signs of Urashiki Otsutsuki&#39;s presence. Urashiki is part of the mission that the Otsutsuki clan leadership sent to investigate what happened to Kaguya Otsutsuki. Other members of the mission include Momoshiki and Kinshiki.

          

After Momoshiki and Kinshiki&#39;s deaths, Urashiki decides that he wants to steal the chakra energy from Kurama for himself, but to accomplish this, he needs to locate Naruto. Urashiki manages to infiltrate the village where he discovers that Konoha possesses a Karasuki - an ancient Otsutsuki clan relic that can allow time travel. Rather than waste his time trying to find Naruto in the present, he decides it would be easier to use the Karasuki to travel back in time and locate Naruto as a child to steal his chakra.






The &#34;Time Slip&#34; Arc is an anime-only storyline that occurs between Episodes 128 and 136.





 Boruto Reveals A Massive Otsutsuki Power Upgrade 
          

While the Otsutsuki are known to have the ability to travel between dimensions, the discovery of the Karasuki reveals that they also can travel across time. As explained in the anime, this ability was not innate but only possible with the assistance of a Karasuki, a turtle-like creature that can both send and retrieve beings through time so long as it has enough chakra energy to complete the jumps. As the only beings on Earth who seem to have enough chakra to power the Karasuki, its usefulness to the Otsutsuki clan&#39;s mission on Earth cannot be overstated.




If Sasuke and Boruto had not interrupted Urashiki&#39;s plans to go back in time and take on a younger, less experienced, and less powerful Naruto, he would certainly would have succeeded in his mission to steal Kurama&#39;s chakra. Naturally, that result would have completely rewritten history - most likely for the worse. It&#39;s amazing that Kaguya, Ishhiki, Momoshiki either forgot or just didn&#39;t know such a power Otsutsuki tool was located right under their noses.



 With A Karasuki, The Otsutsuki Can Change Human History 
          

Urashiki&#39;s plan to use the Karasuki to take out a younger Naruto was not the only good use the Otsutsuki could have found for this overpowered ability. Indeed, the possibilities are endless. Kaguya could have used it to stop herself from giving her sons chakra, which ultimately caused her downfall. Isshiki could have used it to kill Kaguya before she attacked him, and both could have used it to eliminate any human threat that ever existed.




While anime-only storylines such as this one usually are not considered canon, the Karasuki seen there could not be the only one available to the Otsutsuki. Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has been full of surprises, so there is still the possibility that the story will introduce this absolutely broken Otsutsuki power to shake up the status quo again.
