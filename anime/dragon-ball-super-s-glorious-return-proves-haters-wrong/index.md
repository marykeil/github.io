## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Super tricked fans by making them think the Super Hero arc would continue, and then surprised everyone with Goku&#39;s glorious return.




Warning: SPOILERS for chapter #101 of Dragon Ball SuperChapter #101 of Dragon Ball Super has given hardcore fans of the series exactly what they have been asking for months, while at the same time silencing critics who had vented their frustration over the recent Super Hero Arc. Goku&#39;s return and his meeting with Gohan in his new Beast form are exactly the kind of exciting development that the series is famous for, and it seems that the manga has great things in store for the next arc.




Based on the storyboards previewed by Shueisha, it seemed that chapter #101 of Dragon Ball Super would drag on the Super Hero story, focusing on minor characters such as Carmine. Critics have been quick to vent their frustration online after the previews were published, but it&#39;s safe to say that they were proved wrong.

          

While the first half of chapter #101 of Dragon Ball Super was indeed focused on Goten and Trunks in their superhero personas, being roped into a dastardly scheme by Carmine, the second half showed an amazing sparring match between Vegeta and Broly, before moving to Earth again, where Gohan transformed into his Beast form, showing he has full control of this powerful transformation.


 Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Return To Form Gives Fans What They Wanted 
          




The highlight of the chapter was, of course, Goku&#39;s return to Earth after sensing Gohan&#39;s ki, in the final page. Still, the chapter clearly was meant to bring the story back into full gear after the long &#34;break&#34; caused by the adaptation of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie. Broly&#39;s development is shown, Whis tells to the Saiyans what happened on Earth during the Super Hero arc, and there is even mention of Frieza and his Black form, who are expected to be the big highlights of this arc.

Overall, it seems like the authors almost wanted to trick their fans by pretending the chapter was about Carmine and the Saiyamen (with the title even being &#34;Carmine and Soldier #15&#34;), while these were just a means to make Gohan angry again, so he would unleash his Beast form and attract Goku to Earth with his ki. It&#39;s still a little questionable that this did not happen in chapter #100, meaning that Dragon Ball Super wasted a milestone in its history, but better late than never.




          

The question remains, of course, of what direction the story will take now. To the credit of the Super Hero arc, it must be said that it has rejuvenated and made Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks relevant again, meaning that Goku and Vegeta do not have to steal all the spotlight anymore. However, fans are also eager to see the results of the years they spent training on Beerus&#39; planet. On top of that, Broly seems to have become a permanent member of the cast too.

Chapter #101 truly marks a turning point for Dragon Ball Super. The cast of the series is the strongest that it&#39;s ever been - in every sense of the world. With the threat of Frieza looming on the horizon, the stage seems set for a confrontation with the classic villain of the franchise, but it&#39;s also possible that the story will save Frieza for later, introducing a new villain for this arc. What&#39;s sure is that there is no better time than this to be a fan of Dragon Ball Super.
