## Literature Review

One-Punch Man is hinting that it could shock fans by having its most important showdown happen a lot sooner than expected.





Chapter #194 of One-Punch Man follows the same tendency as other recent chapters of the series, progressing characters&#39; storylines and the main plot of the story faster than fans are used to. Characters with direct connections to God are being given increased prominence, leading the plot closer and closer to revealing major secrets about God.




          

This chapter showed that one of God&#39;s mysterious cubes was, and probably still is, held in the ninja village, which should be the focus of the current arc. Considering how ubiquitous God&#39;s presence has become in One-Punch Man&#39;s story, Saitama&#39;s confrontation with this ultimate villain may happen sooner than fans expected.


 All Signs In One-Punch Man Point To An Imminent Showdown With God 
          

Previously, chapter #192 of the original Japanese release (#190 for Viz) saw the return of popular Monster character Oculette/Manako, with major implications that her connections to God would have major consequences for the plot of One-Punch Man. After being reunited with Saitama and Flashy Flash, Oculette is being pressed by the heroes for information about God. Similarly, at the end of chapter #194, Saitama, Genos, and Flashy Flash unexpectedly run into Blast. Considering that Blast has been waging a long war against God, it seems likely that, now that all the main pieces are together, he will reveal more information about the villain, which Saitama will hear too.




Recent chapters have potentially foreshadowed, how Saitama&#39;s battle with God will actually play out. In chapter #193, Saitama has a brief adventure in a fantasy world where he learns of the Cruel Dragon, an ancient monster kept sealed by nine magic stones. Of course, Saitama decides that it&#39;s better to actually help the Cruel Dragon&#39;s evil followers collect all the stones and release the creature, which he defeats with one punch. While there is no tangible direct connection between God and the Cruel Dragon established, there is a parallel between the nine stones sealing the Cruel Dragon and God&#39;s mysterious cubes Blast is collecting. It&#39;s also been established more or less clearly that God is sealed in another dimension - with his body possibly trapped in the Moon - and both the Cruel Dragon and God are also the subject of prophecies foretelling disaster.

So, Saitama&#39;s brief adventure with the Cruel Dragon could be hinting at how Caped Baldy will decide to deal with the threat of God: unleash the villain in order to have (hopefully) a real challenge. The glimpse of a cube held in the ninja village possibly means that is the heroes&#39; next destination. The original webcomic already revealed that the fearsome leader of the village was once beaten by Blast, but how this plotline will develop in the manga is still a complete mystery. Surely enough, rushing to the big battle between Saitama and God would not be that unusual for One-Punch Man, a series that is widely known for subverting expectations and tropes of the genre.

God has been the source of much speculation and mystery up to now, looming over the storyline as a vague but constantly present threat. However, in recent chapters, new information is being delivered more quickly and more concretely than ever before. It&#39;s clear from these recent chapters that the showdown between Saitama and God is approaching faster than fans thought, and it will no doubt be the most decisive battle yet in One-Punch Man.
