## Literature Review

In Super Dragon Ball Heroes, one fusion has managed to ascend to the level of affecting actual spacetime, giving the heroes a new tier of power.




Warning: Spoilers for Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission, Chapter 12Fusions are some of the most powerful characters in Dragon Ball, but one fused warrior actually managed to reach a level of power that allowed him to shatter time itself. During the Super Spacetime Tournament, alternate versions of Goku and Vegeta (known as &#34;Xeno&#34; Goku and &#34;Xeno&#34; Vegeta) managed to fuse into Gogeta, offering the perfect showcase for the immense power they collectively wield.




In the side manga Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission, based on a video game, characters were picked from across space and time to participate in a tournament to determine the &#34;one true history,&#34; with those who lose facing the destruction of their home timelines--essentially, the Tournament of Power turned up to 11. As such, the story follows multiple versions of some familiar faces, such as the aforementioned Xeno Goku and Vegeta, who are part of an organization known as the Time Patrol.

          

When the Supreme Kai of Time responsible for the tournament became endangered, however, the main universe version of Goku came to her aid, while Xeno Goku and Vegeta, already ascended to Super Saiyan 4, tried desperately to get through a spacetime barrier.




                  Even Dragon Ball Super Fans Missed The Tournament of Power&#39;s Epic Sequel   The Super Space-Time Tournament features several characters from the main Dragon Ball multiverse including Goku, Jiren, Hit, and even Yamcha.   


 Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta Can Break Space and Time 
          

In chapter 12 of Ultra God Mission, Xeno Vegeta suggests that he and Xeno Goku fuse to break through the barrier. They perform the Fusion Dance and become Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta, who is able to effortlessly smash through the spacetime barrier, shattering it like glass, while simultaneously attacking the evil Omega Shenron, which the main timeline Goku had been battling on the other side. Their power is incredible, as Xeno Gogeta easily defeats Omega Shenron without breaking a sweat, and soon turns his attention to the big villain in the room, Demigra.




The ability to shatter spacetime like that is no small feat, showing that Super Saiyan 4 Xeno Gogeta possesses some near-godlike power. Wiping the floor with Shenron afterward merely confirmed that this version of Gogeta is simply operating at a different level than has ever been seen before. The power level of fusions is a hotly debated topic among fans, and this destruction of a fundamental force of nature would seem to indicate that Gogeta&#39;s potential is almost immeasurable. In the following chapters, Xeno Gogeta actually receives a temporary power-up to go even greater, allowing him to battle at full potential for 10 minutes without being affected by the flow of time (and the energy depletion that goes with it).

Putting such power on display is certainly fitting for a tournament with such high stakes, and it&#39;s clear that Xeno Gogeta knows how to wield it. What&#39;s less clear is if this is any indication of what the main timeline versions of Goku and Vegeta would be capable of, as they&#39;ve been seen as Super Saiyan Blue Gogeta in the Broly film, which should be even more powerful. Even if different life experiences led to Xeno Gogeta&#39;s power, the potential should still be out there, so long as Goku and Vegeta can achieve it. Regardless, Xeno Gogeta must stand as one of the most powerful figures in the entire Dragon Ball franchise.




               Dragon Ball   Summary:   From the creative mind of Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is a mega multimedia franchise that spans back to the 1980s.
