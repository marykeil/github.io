## Literature Review

The fights against members of Akatsuki are some of the coolest in all of Naruto, leading many fans to ask which are the best of the best.





The boss battles against the Akatsuki progress the story and test the heroes&#39; strength. Naruto himself actually doesn&#39;t get involved in many of the fights against the Akatsuki, which ends up giving the series&#39; wide and varied cast more time to shine. As an added challenge, Akatsuki members travel in pairs and are teamed up based on how well their powers complement each other in battle, making any battle against them twice as difficult.









 








 10  The Sensei Versus Itachi And Kisame 
        

Before the audience even knows the name Akatsuki, Itachi and Kisame make sure that everyone knows that the red and black cloaks mean danger. All the genin look up to their sensei, with Kakashi, Asuma, and Kurenai always being able to step in and save their students. But here, they’re at a real loss against these two incredibly powerful shinobi.
Itachi dominates this confrontation with the first hints of the Sharingan’s true capabilities. He traps Kakashi in Tsukuyomi and forces Asuma and Kurenai to keep their eyes closed to avoid it, leaving them vulnerable to Kisame’s chakra-hungry blade. It’s only the arrival of Might Guy, who has put himself through anti-Sharingan training to fight Kakashi, and Itachi’s desire to minimize conflict that avoids real bloodshed.





 9  Sakura And Chiyo Versus Sasori 
        

Sasori and Deidara overcame Gaara and Kankuro as a team, but Sasori on his own is still a challenge. Cornered by Chiyo and Sakura, Sasori unleashes his entire arsenal of puppets. This includes not only the hundred he can summon, but the puppet-body that he himself inhabits and only wields against opponents that pose a true threat.
Sakura puts up one of the best fights in Naruto Shippuden, and it’s an excellent show of how powerful she’s become since the end of Naruto&#39;s first part. She fends off all of Sasori’s puppets and bravely takes an attack intended to kill Chiyo. Chiyo, for her part, proves that a ninja don’t reach their seventies by slacking off: her ten battle puppets are more than a match for her grandson’s hundred.





 8  Konan Versus Obito 
        

This fight is unique in that it’s between two members of Akatsuki, rather than a member versus a hero, albeit members that had very different ideas of the group’s purpose. After Nagato’s death, Obito comes to take the Rinnegan from his body. In defense of Nagato, Yahiko, and Naruto’s ambitions toward true peace, Konan fights him to the death.
In the shadows alongside Nagato, Konan never got the chance to shine like her comrades. Her power is on full and beautiful display here: her strongest techniques make even paper deadly, and she continues to fight even after losing half her body. Her analysis of “Tobi’s” techniques leads her to unleash an explosive attack that lasts twice as long as his lifesaving Kamui, and it’s only the Sharingan he’d kept secret from her that saves his life.





 7  Team 10 Versus Hidan And Kakuzu 
        

Hidan killing Asuma is one of the saddest moments in Naruto, which only makes his students and friends rallying to avenge his death more satisfying. While Shikamaru takes a leaf out of Sasuke’s book and hunts down Asuma’s killer himself, Ino, Choji, and Kakashi team up against Kakuzu. Unfortunately for them, Hidan and Kakuzu are still powerhouses even when separated.
Kakuzu’s five hearts keep him alive through fatal attacks, including Kakashi’s Lightning Cutter, but it’s Naruto’s Rasenshuriken and Shikamaru turning Hidan’s techniques against his partner that finally kills him. As Kakashi directly explains, it’s a great example of the show’s theme of the younger generation surpassing the elder. Shikamaru also shows how deadly his intelligence is by burying the immortal Hidan alive, to suffer for years before dying.





 6  Might Guy Versus Kisame 
        

This battle between two of the best side characters in Naruto shows off Kisame’s true power. Though Kisame’s fight with Killer Bee and the Fourth Raikage is exciting, Kisame is quickly overwhelmed (and betrayed by Samehada to boot), and forced to hide. When he bursts out, Guy is forced to break out some of his highest-level techniques to keep up with Kisame and his sharks.
The fight isn’t just for the combatants’ lives, but for the vital information that Kisame is trying to deliver. In defeat, Kisame shows surprising depth: he takes his own life rather than betray Akatsuki, and dies thinking of his late partner Itachi. In victory, Guy shows his characteristic respect for his opponents, swearing never to forget him again.





 5  Jiraiya Versus Pain And Konan 
        

The reveal that Jiraiya himself trained the leaders of Akatsuki is one of the most shocking plot twists in Naruto. However, while it’s the most pivotal moment of Jiraiya’s final fight, it’s far from the coolest. Against their former sensei, Konan and Nagato pull no punches, and it’s in them that one of the Legendary Sannin finally meets his match.
Jiraiya defeats three of the Six Paths of Pain before they overwhelm him, but his real victory is in figuring out Pain’s true identity and getting the information back to the village. In his youth, he was told that a child he trained would either save or destroy the world. He dies not knowing whether Naruto or Nagato is that child, or what they will do, but he chooses to put his faith in Naruto with his last moments.





 4  Sasuke Versus Deidara 
        

Deidara resents Sharingan users, Itachi in particular, for what he insists is their inability to appreciate his explosive art. He never got over his loss to Itachi, but he’ll settle for killing Itachi’s younger brother if he can’t best the elder Uchiha. Sasuke thinks of Deidara much the same way: just an obstacle he has to get through before he can fight Itachi.
As much as Sharingan eyes and genjutsu continue to vex him, Deidara is ecstatic while deploying his highest arts. He attacks Sasuke from the ground, the air, and with the most gigantic bombs he can whip up. By contrast, Sasuke wins by quietly working out the weaknesses in Deidara’s jutsu, driving him to destroy himself just to win and throwing one unfortunate snake in the way of Deidara’s final explosion.





 3  Kakashi Versus Obito 
        

One of the best flashback episodes in anime history details a young Kakashi’s relationship with his teammates, Rin Nohara and Obito Uchiha. Obito was fatally wounded on a mission, giving Kakashi his Sharingan before dying. But to Kakashi’s horror, the man working to destroy the shinobi world is Obito himself, back with a powerful grudge against the society that created them.
The two are evenly matched, copying each other’s moves with their Sharingan. It’s made even more emotional as Kakashi flashes back to their sparring matches as children while Obito is trying to kill him. The morals he imparts on his students (especially Naruto, who he realizes reminds him of a young Obito) he got from Obito, but when he tries to remind Obito of that, his former friend just throws them back in his face.





 2  Sasuke Versus Itachi 
        

The Fated Battle Between Brothers arc is a fight built up to since Naruto&#39;s earliest chapters. Luckily for fans, it doesn&#39;t disappoint. Sasuke finally feels powerful enough to kill Itachi and avenge the Uchiha clan, however, Itachi is one of the most infamous shinobi in the world for good reason, and he is as willing as always to push his little brother past his limits.
Both Sasuke and Itachi pull out all the stops, with the debuts of techniques from Kirin to Susanoo making it a true spectacle. But the real kicker of this fight is what it reveals about Itachi, starting from the very last second when he stops to give Sasuke a last smile before dropping dead. From sparing him from the Uchiha clan massacre to permanently freeing him of Orochimaru’s curse mark, everything Itachi has done has been for his brother’s sake, upending Sasuke&#39;s life once again.





 1  Naruto Versus Pain 
        

When the Akatsuki’s leader finally shows his face (all six of them), he does so with a bang: leveling much of Konoha with one massive attack. Nagato is Naruto&#39;s ideological opposite and considerably stronger than him, making Naruto’s victory here one of his greatest achievements. If this didn’t make him the Leaf Village’s hero, nothing would have.
Naruto wielding Sage Mode against someone who’s just put every shinobi in the Leaf Village through the wringer is truly thrilling. Hinata gets more time in the spotlight as well, putting up more of a fight against Pain to protect Naruto before her iconic confession. When Pain seemingly kills her, Naruto reining in his fury and pulling himself out of eight-tailed form not only requires incredibly strong will but allows Naruto to confront Nagato one-on-one. Though some fans might balk at Naruto being able to talk the Akatsuki leader down, it&#39;s a true testament to the strength of the younger shinobi&#39;s convictions.
Fights against the Akatsuki are not only essential to Naruto&#39;s story, but thrilling and dramatic battles as well. Each one forces the heroes to adapt and evolve just to survive. More than just spectacles though, they&#39;re also great character moments and interesting from a strategic perspective. Naruto&#39;s best Akatsuki battles are so remarkable because they are a true test of wits as each combatant finds increasingly creative uses for their powers.
