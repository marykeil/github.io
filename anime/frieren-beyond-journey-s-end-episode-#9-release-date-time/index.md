## Literature Review

Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #9 will likely feature a variety of epic  battles between Frieren, her allies, and the demons led by Aura.




While Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End is usually a pretty sedate show, episode #9 is promising to show fans another one of its rare but superb action scenes. It also is hinting at more elements from its protagonist&#39;s enigmatic past and the reasons for her hatred of Frieren&#39;s fascinating villains. Perhaps most excitingly it will also show more of a powerful and important villain who has only been hinted at until now.

It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on November 3 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 10 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST).

 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #8? 
          

Episode #8 began by quickly resolving the cliffhanger from the previous episode and having Frieren easily defeat the demon who attempted to murder her in her cell. After that conflict between the human leader Granat and the demon envoys soon commenced, with the demons easily dispatching the human guards and taking Granat prisoner. Fern and Stark broke into his castle to rescue him while Frieren left town. While Fern managed to injure one envoy, they are both chasing after her and Stark now while Frieren has an intense confrontation against the powerful demon Aura the Guillotine and her army.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #9 Will Feature Awesome Battles 
          

Based on the cliffhanger ending, episode #9 will likely feature two awesome battles at the same time. The battle between Fern, Stark, and the demon envoys will likely be more intense as Stark and Fern are underdogs and the demons will likely be able to ambush them using Lugner&#39;s blood magic. The clash between Frieren and Aura will probably be very different given how powerful the nigh immortal Frieren is. Lugner stated that she is a genius who contributed a lot to making magic to harm demons, so she will likely be able to easily overcome Aura&#39;s army. However, given Frieren herself stated that Aura is strong, the demon leader might cause her some trouble.

While the show doesn&#39;t normally focus on these bombastic battles it has repeatedly shown it can do them well when it has to. Given this will be the most action-oriented episode yet, the creators of the show may go all out and produce fights that rival or surpass other boundary pushing anime this season like Jujutsu Kaisen. If they do then Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #9 may be one of the best of the year.




Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #9 when it airs on Crunchyroll on November 3, 2023.
