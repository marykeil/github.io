# Jujutsu Kaisen s Shibuya Incident Arc Is Not As Perfect As Fans Think


## SUMMARY 



  Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident arc is highly regarded as one of the best shonen arcs due to its nonstop action and high-quality fights, but it&#39;s still not flawless.   The anime adaptation of the arc did a great job overall, but one early fight involving Yuji is essentially pure filler and takes away from the more important clash involving Gojo.   Despite this initial flaw, Studio MAPPA made up for it by giving proper care and attention to the rest of the fights in the arc, showcasing their ability to elevate the source material in the anime.

## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident arc is great overall but had a major flaw at its start that proves that no story is completely perfect.




Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident arc is widely considered to be one of the best arcs in Shonen manga for good reason. However, while the anime adaptation has done a great job bringing it to screen, one early fight in the arc doesn&#39;t live up to the high standard the show has set for its battles. This shows that even the best storylines aren&#39;t without their flaws.




In season 2 episode #8 of Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuji fights a grasshopper curse while Gojo fights the disaster Curses Jogo and Hanami. While Gojo&#39;s fight is the more interesting battle against more important foes, the anime gives a major focus to Yuji&#39;s fight as well, even adding in some details and lingering on certain epic shots.

          

This is all very cool and makes the fight better than it was in the manga, but it also takes time away from Gojo&#39;s epic clash. This is rather disappointing, especially as it turns out the grasshopper fight is basically pure filler.

The Shibuya Incident is widely regarded as one of the best shonen arcs of all time, and a major part of this is due to its emphasis on nonstop action. There is very little time for fans to relax as the arc barrels onward from one fight to the next. This perpetual fighting makes it very hard for a studio to adapt every fight with a similar level of quality, as oftentimes most studios save the majority of their time and budget to make the best fights of the show look as good as possible. MAPPA unfortunately took a different approach with this grasshopper fight.

Luckily as the season continued, a lot more care was given to the fights that mattered, such as Gojo&#39;s final battle against the Disaster Curses and Yuji&#39;s fight against Choso. The less important fights also became a lot more interesting, thus meriting the amount of care MAPPA put into them. This allowed the anime to do the nonstop action of the Shibuya Incident justice, which is an incredibly impressive achievement despite this initial hiccup. Studio MAPPA has consistently elevated the source material in their anime, and Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season is another example of this.






 MAPPA Did The Rest of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident Arc Justice 
          

The only reason why this sort of minor flaw could be something many people complain about is because the Shibuya Incident arc is so beloved by fans. The arc truly didn&#39;t just change Jujutsu Kaisen but shonen manga as a whole. Luckily Studio MAPPA met those expectations and made Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Shibuya Incident arc as great in the anime as it was in the manga.
