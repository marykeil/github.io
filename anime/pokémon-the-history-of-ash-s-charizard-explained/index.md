## Literature Review

Ash&#39;s Charizard in the Pokémon anime has been one of his most iconic team members, and their history together is second only to Pikachu.




When it comes to Pokémon, Ash&#39;s Charizard is probably one of the most iconic and recognizable Pokémon from the franchise after Pikachu. Ash and his Charizard have a long history together, and it&#39;s one that many modern fans may not be familiar with due to the sheer length of time over which all these episodes occurred, dating back to the first season over 20 years ago. Here&#39;s everything a fan needs to know about Ash and his Charizard.




Charizard, of course, wasn&#39;t always a Charizard. Ash first met his Charmander back in Pokémon&#39;s 11th episode, when he found it abandoned in a rainstorm, cowering under a small leaf in a desperate attempt to keep the flame on its tail lit. Ash and friends rushed the suffering Fire-type to the Pokémon Center, where it was able to recover. Charmander made a huge impression on fans in this episode, and to this day, the image of Charmander huddling under that leaf is known to provoke strong feelings even in those who haven&#39;t watched the show in years.

          

After finding Charmander&#39;s original trainer who abandoned it, Ash is able to take in Charmander as his own Pokémon, and begins training him to be a valuable member of the team.





 Ash&#39;s Charmeleon Became Disobedient 
This is how the anime introduced the concept of trainers needing badges to make higher-level Pokémon obey them.
          

Charmander evolved into Charmeleon in episode #43, where it battled against Exeggutor, who is weak to fire. As Charmeleon, it began to disobey Ash&#39;s orders in Pokémon battles, mimicking a mechanic from the games where Pokémon of too high a level would become disobedient. Charmeleon even began to attack Ash with flames when agitated. Fortunately, it didn&#39;t spend long in this state, and soon evolved again into Charizard in episode #46, where the fresh Charizard battled it out with an Aerodactyl in an impressive aerial display.

Charizard still wouldn&#39;t obey, however, instead often lazing about, to the point where its refusal to fight led to a loss at the Cinnabar City gym. His disobedience ultimately cost Ash a win at the Indigo Conference, too, where he lost to a friend named Ritchie when Charizard refused to battle at all in the top 16 round. Throughout Pokémon&#39;s Orange Island arc, Charizard&#39;s disobedience continued, until an incident where Charizard was frozen solid during a battle with a Poliwrath. Now at risk of his tail flame going out once again, Ash and co. worked hard to help Charizard pull through, finally earning Ash enough respect that Charizard would obey.






 Ash&#39;s Charizard&#39;s Appearances Beyond Kanto 
Charizard came back in Johto and Unova.
         

Ash brought Charizard with him to Johto as well, and frequently used him in early battles, where Charizard far outstripped the level of his opponents. Misty and Brock felt that Ash was not being fair to his opponents and often chided him for this behavior. The incident would go on to prove important, as Brock and Misty&#39;s words could explain why Ash abandons his previous Pokémon in each region. While Ash used Charizard against the first gym leader in Johto, the time had come for Charizard to move out of the limelight.

In episode #134, Ash and friends find a location known as the Charicific Valley, where many wild Charizard live. Here, it was revealed that Ash&#39;s Charizard is considerably smaller than most, and it struggled to earn respect from its fellow Charizard. Charizard ended up protecting the valley from Team Rocket (who only attacked to help Charizard be accepted), and Ash decided to leave Charizard in the valley. Charizard stayed, alongside a female Charizard named Charla, with whom he had become enamored.




Charizard wouldn&#39;t reappear until it was time for Ash&#39;s final Johto badge in episode #253, where Charizard&#39;s training brought it to Blackthorn City while Ash happened to be there. Charizard joined Ash to fight for the final Pokémon gym badge, and then stayed for the Silver Conference tournament, where Ash would go on to place in the top eight. Another comeback occurred when Ash came home to Kanto to challenge the Battle Frontier in episode #410, and again during the Battle Frontier arc&#39;s final match in episodes #463 and #464. Here, Charizard fought well but was ultimately defeated by a Dusclops, and once again returned to the valley afterward.

Charizard did not appear at any point during the anime&#39;s Sinnoh era, but would finally be seen again during episode #773, after Ash had been in Unova for a while. Ash was reminded of his Charizard by a Charmander, and asked to have Charizard sent to him by Professor Oak. While there, Ash&#39;s Charizard and his traveling companion Iris&#39;s Dragonite began to develop a rivalry, constantly competing with each other. Charizard stayed with Ash in Unova for the rest of the series, until finally being sent back to Professor Oak&#39;s lab, alongside Ash&#39;s Pokémon from Unova. Charizard lived at Professor Oak&#39;s lab from that point onward, not returning to the Charicific Valley.






 Where is Ash&#39;s Charizard Now? 
Charizard has taken on a mentor&#39;s role at Professor Oak&#39;s lab.
          

As of the time of writing, Charizard was last seen during the Pokémon Journeys series at Professor Oak&#39;s lab, where it would work with some of Ash&#39;s other Pokémon, like Gengar, to help them train and learn new moves. Charizard was shown watching Ash&#39;s battles in the World Coronation Series tournament as well, and memories of Charizard (and other Pokémon) were seen by Pikachu during the climactic bout to cheer him on to victory. Despite much speculation at the time, Ash&#39;s Charizard never mega evolved in Pokémon XY, nor was it given a chance to Gigantamax during Pokémon Journeys, so it has never been able to use any of the newer forms Charizard has acquired over the years.



While Ash doesn&#39;t appear in the successor series Pokémon Horizons, another Charizard, owned by Professor Friede, plays a major role, carrying the torch from Ash&#39;s Charizard.







As one of Ash&#39;s oldest and now most loyal Pokémon, Charizard appeared in the final episodes of Ash&#39;s run, where it reunited with Bulbasaur and Squirtle, giving the original trio a final farewell. While Charizard in general has always been a popular Pokémon, Ash&#39;s Charizard certainly increased its appeal with its many cool performances in battle, and its reappearances have helped introduce Charizard to new generations of Pokémon fans. With a role in some of Pokémon&#39;s most memorable moments, Ash&#39;s Charizard undoubtedly made its mark in the memory of fans.
