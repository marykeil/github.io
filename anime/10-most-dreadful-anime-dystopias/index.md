## Literature Review

In corrupt and restrictive societies where good deeds are rarely rewarded and betrayal is all but guaranteed, the best one can hope for is to survive.





There is plenty to enjoy about dystopias, particularly in the context of the anime medium. In stark contrast with classic shounen titles, wherein the protagonists are always able to win, provided they have the necessary willpower and determination, the worlds depicted in such shows are not kind enough to allow for any meaningful moments of victory. Instead, they present dark realities where happiness and the truth are always just out of reach.
            
 
 10 Best Dystopian Manga 
Already known for its disturbing fiction, it&#39;s time to count down the 10 best dystopian stories in the field of Japanese Manga.












 








 10  86 
        

Whether the world of 86 is more of a utopia or dystopia depends largely on whose perspective is being taken into consideration. To the silver-haired Alba living peacefully and free of worries in the Republic of San Magnolia, fully believing the lies that they are told, life is as easy as it gets. However, the supposedly autonomous unmanned drones that are fighting to preserve their safety are actually controlled by the Eighty-Six, a secret military subgroup where people of different appearances are forced to fight. To the Alba, these people may as well not be human; neither their names nor their wellbeing are ever a concern for anyone but Vladilena MilizÃ©.





 9  Patema Inverted 
        

The story of Patema Inverted follows the titular Patema, a resident of an underground village connected to other remnants of civilization through a complex network of tunnels. Though her life isn&#39;t particularly harsh, she can never quite accept the fact that she has to follow so many rules and be constrained by so many limits without ever being explained what danger she is supposed to avoid. Eventually, she gets too close to the forbidden zone, falling upwards into the sky and meeting Age, who lives in a totalitarian country known as Aiga, where people are taught to fear others. Together, they seek to unravel their world of lies and secrets.





 8  Berserk 
        

Though Berserk&#39;s story mostly revolves around Guts, his journey makes it clear that this world is a ruthless and merciless one, where death and tragedy are the order of the day. He personally experienced countless acts of abuse and betrayal, that started from the very beginning, when he was born without anyone to call family, only to be taken in by a man who broke his trust. Even when he does manage to make allies, it always ends in tragic events such as the infamous Eclipse. Life doesn&#39;t seem to be any easier for others either, as the land is terrorized by evil demonic beings and corrupt humans





 7  From The New World 
        

From The New World is a classic case of an apparent utopia slowly but surely revealing itself to be something very different. The story takes place in a world defined by the sudden outbreak of psychokinetic powers in a small percentage of the population, which was followed by hundreds of years of chaos and tragedies. At some point, psychic humans realized that the best way to achieve peace was to isolate themselves from the rest of the world, resulting in towns such as Kamisu 66, or so the story goes. However, mysterious events lead to shocking revelations, proving that this society is in fact controlled by horrific lies and incomplete memories.





 6  Sunday Without God 
        

As the title implies, the events of Sunday Without God take place in a world that was abandoned by its god, closing the gate to heaven. Now, life can neither end nor begin; both the ability to die and to create new life were taken away from people, left to wander aimlessly after losing their meaning and purpose. The only ones able to maintain a somewhat natural order are gravekeepers, mysterious beings given the task of putting the dead to rest. Still, both to the living and to those who should long be dead, a world doomed to end is certainly not one that inspires hope.





 5  Serial Experiments Lain 
        

Serial Experiments Lain is a complex story revolving around the titular protagonist Lain Iwakura, a girl whose involvement in technology coincides with her own evolution throughout the show. Initially shy, awkward, and unwilling to deal with any technology, her life begins to change once she receives a strange email from a classmate who had previously committed suicide, only to then find herself in the Wired, a virtual world that in many ways could be described as a physical representation of the internet. One thing that is clear about the surreal Wired is that it has the potential to be highly dangerous to its users, especially if it becomes an obsession.
            
 
 10 Best Science Fiction Anime to Stream 
Whether award winners or rebooted classics, 2023 is filled with great science fiction anime options for fans to binge this summer.








 4  Blood Blockade Battlefront 
        

The dystopian setting of Blood Blockade Battlefront is Hellsalem&#39;s Lot, formerly known as New York City, a place where humans and supernatural beings coexist, after a gateway between Earth and the Beyond suddenly opened three years ago, trapping citizens in an impenetrable bubble. Though there is a certain secret organization known as Libra working to maintain order and contain the chaos, their power isn&#39;t enough to prevent the daily paranormal phenomena plaguing the city. Here, illegal activities and criminal organizations thrive, causing ordinary humans to live in constant fear. Moreover, the situation gets worse the closer one is to the center of the city, where the Eternal Nothingness lies.





 3  The Promised Neverland 
        

The Promised Neverland follows a group of orphans living happily as a family, together with their loving &#34;Mama&#34; Isabella. However, the Grace Field House is soon revealed not to be an ordinary orphanage, but rather a farm where children are raised only to later be fed to demons who buy them. Upon accidentally learning the truth, the older orphans seek to devise an escape plan, even without having any guarantee that there is any safety in the outside world for them. Unbeknownst to them though, their farm is but one of many, and the threat of man-eating terrifying demons plagues the entire world.





 2  Ergo Proxy 
        

Ergo Proxy is a classic case of a futuristic story where a post-apocalyptic world takes a turn for the worse, whereby the technology people rely on to survive ends up becoming more of a threat instead. A global ecologic catastrophe results in a world where few places remain habitable by humans, with what&#39;s left of civilization having to remain inside domed cities such as Romdo. In an attempt to facilitate humanity&#39;s recovery, &#34;AutoReivs&#34; were designed to assist in everyday tasks, but they end up contracting a disease that grants them self-awareness and makes them far more dangerous than anyone could have expected.





 1  Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 
        

The events of award-winning title Cyberpunk: Edgerunners take place in the dystopian futuristic Night City, where bright neon lights and intriguing body enhancements are not quite enough to hide the tragedies of its corrupt system. The story follows David Martinez, a boy from an underprivileged background who initially wants nothing but security for himself and his mother. David starts to lose his dream and himself to the world of Edgerunners, a group of criminals who utilize cybernetic enhancements that are constantly threatening their sanity. In a society where being good is seldom rewarded and no one can be fully trusted, a tragic end is all but guaranteed.
Dystopias can take on a number of different forms, from the classic post-apocalyptic futuristic ones, wherein the world develops in such a way that it reaches the pinnacle of what people fear about AI and technology, to more grounded or even fantastical titles, that simply choose to depict dark and depressing worlds full of tragedies and trauma. Moreover, when a world opposes its residents, leading characters can only shine by being strong and resilient enough to accept and overcome their struggles. Even then, success is seldom guaranteed, which is what makes these some of the most dreadful anime dystopias.
