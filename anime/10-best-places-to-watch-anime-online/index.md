## Literature Review

Everyone knows the most popular streaming services, such as Netflix and Crunchyroll, but those are far from the only options, and not always the best.





However, once one starts looking into the issue, the differences become clear. Some streaming services are only available in certain locations, immediately denying access to viewers who are located elsewhere. Others may exceed the budget that one is willing to spend on entertainment. But the most important criterion is likely going to be the selection of titles available, which can vary drastically between different subscriptions.









 








 10  Max 
        

Max, formerly known as HBO Max, may not have as large a portfolio of anime shows as other streaming services, but it is absolutely a case of quality over quantity. The best anime available on Max include not only the beloved Ghibli movies but also other classic works that range from nightmare-inducing horror titles to heartfelt romance stories. Moreover, it also provides a good number of non-anime titles, should fans be intrigued by the prospect of watching anything else. Unfortunately, it is only currently available in one region, namely in the United States, but it is set to expand later on, provided everything goes to plan.





 9  Disney&#43; 
        

As one would expect, Disney&#43; is best known for its catalog of classic and modern Disney titles, serving as the best place to watch the shows and films that children and adults worldwide fell in love with. However, one thing that may seem surprising is that Disney is also committed to the idea of expanding into the anime industry, collaborating with publishing companies to give subscribers the chance to watch titles such as Heavenly Delusion and Tokyo Revengers. Its anime offerings may not be enough of an incentive by themselves yet, but they definitely make for a nice bonus, and there is plenty of room for expansion.





 8  Tubi 
        

One thing that differentiates Tubi from most other streaming services is that it is completely free, whereas most typically require a fee. Naturally, this also translates into a difference in terms of quality of experience, with those opting to stream on Tubi having to accept regular ads, as there is no option available to disable them. Whether this tradeoff is worth making is entirely up to the viewers, but at least it is always good to have options. Tubi&#39;s selection of anime is also quite good, offering titles that range from shonen classics such as Hunter x Hunter and Naruto to brilliant comedies like The Disastrous Life Of Saiki K.





 7  Amazon Prime Video 
        

Perhaps the best thing about Amazon Prime Video is that its benefits are included with Amazon Prime memberships, making this service virtually free for those who were already planning on maintaining Prime status to make their purchases more convenient. Moreover, even in countries where Amazon Prime is not available, Prime Video tends to still be an option by itself, typically at a much lower price. Whether one is looking for movies or shows, there are quite a few options to choose from. However, while some are included in the service, others may need to be rented or bought in order to be accessed.





 6  Hulu 
        

While it may not necessarily have as many exclusive titles as other services, Hulu is a seriously solid contender as far as anime titles are concerned, providing shows that cover a large variety of genres and demographics for subscribers to enjoy. The best anime on Hulu include both classic shonen titles such as One Piece and Yu Yu Hakusho, but also modern breakout hits like
Demon Slayer and Spy x Family. As good as the service may be, it should be noted that it is largely unavailable outside the United States, but there are thankfully other options for anime fans located elsewhere.





 5  YouTube 
        

This may come as a surprise to those unaware, but YouTube can actually be a fairly good option in terms of watching anime online for free. There are cases of copyright holders making certain titles available for free, for different reasons, allowing viewers to enjoy these experiences at no cost whatsoever. For instance, companies such as Viz Media and Nozomi Entertainment have uploaded anime shows that include but are not limited to beloved classics like Sailor Moon, Death Note, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and even Beyblade, which some fans may feel nostalgic for, though availability depends on location and cannot be guaranteed.





 4  Funimation 
        

Firstly, it should be noted that it is not advised to invest in Funimation for the long term, as it is set to be discontinued eventually. Having been acquired by Crunchyroll, all of its titles are going to be available on the latter, making it unnecessary to subscribe to this one as well. However, for as long as the service continues to be available, it may still be worth using to watch shows that are not yet available on Crunchyroll, especially for viewers looking for dubbed anime. For instance, some (dubbed) shows that are yet to be moved over, likely due to licensing deals, include One Piece and Steins;Gate.





 3  HiDive 
        

Not only available in multiple countries, but also generally associated with a lower cost than similar services, HiDive is a highly competitive option when it comes to choosing where to watch anime online. This streaming service has plenty of unique advantages, from offering simulcasts and acclaimed exclusive titles like [Oshi No Ko] and The Eminence in Shadow, to a large variety of underrated anime that include Revue Starlight and Call of the Night. While it may not be as recognized as its more popular peers, HiDive is certainly one of the best options out there, depending on one&#39;s requirements and preferences.





 2  Netflix 
        

As the most popular online streaming service worldwide, it should be no surprise that Netflix has invested significantly in anime as well, notably through the availability of exclusive titles known as Netflix Originals that include some brilliant works such as Violet Evergarden, Little Witch Academia, Devilman Crybaby, and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. While being but a sample of the service&#39;s selection, these titles alone prove just how varied and diverse the catalog is. Naturally, even outside its exclusives, there are plenty of other amazing shows that can be counted among the best anime on Netflix. The only issue must be finding the time necessary to experience all these unique stories.





 1  Crunchyroll 
        

More so than any other streaming service, Crunchyroll is simply symbolic of the anime world. Since its inception, it has built a reputation as the best place to watch anime, not only offering a large variety of different titles, but also creating their own original ones, including some recent highly-regarded shows such as A Place Further Than The Universe and TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You. With the list of the best anime on Crunchyroll expanding every season, subscribers are truly spoiled for choice. No matter what genre, theme, or art style one prefers, this service is guaranteed to offer the best shows in the industry.
No matter what criteria one values, their ideal streaming service is bound to be mentioned on this list. They each have their own advantages and disadvantages, with some emphasizing lower prices in exchange for a smaller catalog, while others sell themselves as premium services that are certain to meet the needs of a large variety of anime fans. Some of them even play a more active role in the anime industry, investing in new titles and adaptations. At the end of the day, the choice of the best place to watch anime online is entirely subjective, as it all depends on personal circumstances.
