# Boruto Finally Getting Rid Of Naruto And Sasuke Is The Best Thing For The Series


## SUMMARY 



  The absence of Naruto and Sasuke in the current Boruto storyline allows the series to focus on the next generation of shinobi and develop their characters.   Despite initial reader backlash, the decision to marginalize Naruto and Sasuke in the manga allows for a deeper exploration of the new characters and their abilities.   The upcoming battles in Boruto, which will not involve Naruto and Sasuke, showcase the progression of the series and highlight Boruto&#39;s growing role as a protagonist.

## Literature Review

Boruto can finally do exactly what it&#39;s initially purpose was now that Naruto and Sasuke are now predisposed and won&#39;t be back for the next big fight.




Warning: Spoilers for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter #4Fans might understandably want more Naruto and Sasuke in Boruto, but their removal from the current storyline is the best possible development for the sequel series because it means that it can finally focus on the next generation of shinobi rather than relying on the more established characters. Ironically, the move comes after Boruto already dropped the Naruto Next Generations part of its moniker upon the start of Two Blue Vortex.




Although much more prevalent and pivotal in the anime, Sasuke and Naruto are mostly relegated to the manga&#39;s sidelines by comparison, while other shinobi from their generation don&#39;t even appear, like Kakashi and Tsunade. This allowed the sequel series to focus more so on its namesake - the next generation of characters after Naruto - despite reader backlash.

          

Despite this trend though, Boruto&#39;s big battle against Isshiki was primarily a battle for Naruto and Sasuke. This brief focus on the previous series&#39; heroes left the impression that the next generation of ninjas wouldn&#39;t get a role in the most important fights.


 This Is The Only Way For Boruto To Truly Be About The Next Generation After Naruto 
          




It&#39;s therefore appropriate that what&#39;s expected to be the next big battle in Boruto won&#39;t include Naruto and Sasuke. Until recently, the series had only confirmed that Naruto wouldn&#39;t be present, both from the infamous opening scene, and when Kawaki officially seals Naruto and Hinata in an alternate dimension in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations chapter #78. But in chapter #4 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex by creator/supervisor Masashi Kishimoto and artist Mikio Ikemoto, Sasuke is confirmed to be stuck inside a tree.

With it being assumed that Boruto can only set Sasuke free after defeating the new self-aware and humanoid Divine Trees, Sasuke clearly won&#39;t participate in the war against them, along with Naruto. This development showcases a compelling rate of progression throughout Boruto. Sasuke and Naruto initially played massive roles during the initial Otsutsuki invasion and then the first big battle of the series against Isshiki/Jigen, and now they will be absent in the next and possibly greater fights against the four Divine Trees. If Boruto&#39;s role in the war against Isshiki/Jigen was effective, one can only imagine how much more it will be in the ones to come.






 Naruto &amp; Sasuke Could Have a Role Beyond Two Blue Vortex 
          

Of course, if Boruto continues after Two Blue Vortex, the series will have to contend with Naruto and Sasuke once more after they survive their latest predicaments. It would be a compelling image and the perfect development if Sasuke and Naruto return and yet choose or don&#39;t need to help Boruto and his generation against the next big threat facing the village of Konoha. It definitely helps that Boruto&#39;s new design and overall personality are much more in line with intriguing protagonists. Hopefully, this standoffish role is what Naruto and Sasuke will adopt going forward in Boruto if this is indeed a series about the next generation.
