## Literature Review

The official nominees for the 8th annual Crunchyroll Anime Awards are out, and there are three anime that stand out as the frontrunners, so far.




Over the past few years, the Crunchyroll Anime Awards have easily become one of the biggest anime awards in the world. In addition to being the only anime award ceremony to originate in the United States, the wide variety of categories and the large window for viability have allowed a lot of anime of varying popularity to be recognized for their strengths.




The 8th annual Crunchyroll Anime Awards are sure to be the biggest yet, and three anime are already the clear frontrunners. The official list of nominees for the 2024 Crunchyroll Anime Awards has been revealed, and Chainsaw Man is the frontrunner with 25 nominations, followed by Jujutsu Kaisen with 17 and Oshi no Ko with 12, with all three sharing a nomination for Anime of the Year.

          

All three anime were nominated for categories perfectly in line with what they’ve been praised for, and despite their differing strengths, it’s more than possible to predict which series will come out on top.


 Chainsaw Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, &amp; Oshi No Ko More Than Deserve Their Nominations 
         




Chainsaw Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Oshi no Ko each have a wide assortment of nominations. With all the praise each series received, it makes perfect sense for each of them to be nominated for Anime of the Year, and with how they were all praised for their direction, their respective directors Ryu Nakayama, Shota Goshozono, and Daisuke Hiramaki being nominated for Best Director is more than appropriate. The same can also be said for their Best Art Direction nominations, as all three anime received much praise for their outstanding visual aesthetics.

As for other categories, with how much Chainsaw Man and Jujutsu Kaisen leaned into stylized action, both receiving nominations for Best Action and Best Cinematography is in line with some of the biggest praise they received during their runs. Oshi no Ko’s heavy focus on drama and music more than justifies its nominations for Best Drama and Best Opening Sequence, the latter also being very fitting for Chainsaw Man and Jujutsu Kaisen. All in all, every nomination given to each series is very well-deserved, and they each exemplify how much success they’ve all managed to obtain.






 Which Anime Will Be The Winner Of The Crunchyroll Anime Awards? 
          

Chainsaw Man, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Oshi no Ko are the shows to look out for in the Crunchyroll Anime Awards, and that begs the question of which one will have the most wins. Chainsaw Man has an advantage with how big a lead it has over other nominees, but with it being older than its competitors, it could easily lose out to Jujutsu Kaisen and Oshi no Ko. Jujutsu Kaisen is especially tough competition as the success of season 2 easily made it one of the biggest anime franchises of 2023, if not the biggest.

There are also many other nominees to consider, of course. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Attack on Titan, and Bocchi the Rock! all also had substantial nominations, alongside other notable series like One Piece, Vinland Saga, and Mob Psycho 100, so it’s hard to say that any one show will have overwhelming success over its competitors this year. Even so, that lack of certainty only serves to make the 8th Crunchyroll Anime Awards an even more exciting event, and seeing how it all plays out on March 2 will undoubtedly be great to see.
