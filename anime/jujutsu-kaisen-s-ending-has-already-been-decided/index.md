## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen may be wondering who’ll be the last sorcerer standing, but the end has already been determined – and two people know it.




Fans of Jujutsu Kaisen have been recently surprised by the news that the series&#39; creator, Gege Akutami, has already settled on what the finale of his story should be, and he shared it only with one person: his editor at Weekly Shonen Jump. Despite being aware of the unavoidable end, it is difficult to envision how all the complex elements of a story as vast as Jujutsu Kaisen will ultimately be resolved,




The One Piece Variety show (a monthly One Piece-themed variety television program broadcasted by Fuji TV) sent one of the hosts to Shueisha&#39;s offices. There, the host met up with Junya Fukuda, Gege Akutami&#39;s editor, ahead of Jujutsu Kaizen&#39;s new chapter drop. Fukuda admitted that Akutami has already mapped out an official ending scene of the supernatural battle series, though he is not about to let anyone know yet what&#39;s going on in that scene.


 

Editors are not normally the ones to comment on a series ending, but as revealed in a post to the X account of @JJK(Mya), Fukuda was seemingly caught unaware by a television host while working at his desk in Shueisha&#39;s offices and asked, among other questions, about the series ending.

Fukuda admitted to knowing how the series ends and was satisfied with how it ultimately turns out. Fukuda did not reveal to the questioner what Akutami was planning for the ending, but did confess that he&#39;d be willing to disclose the ending to the One Piece editor, but only if he agreed to tell him the ending of Eiichiro Oda&#39;s series in turn. Naturally, both of them were joking, and the endings of these popular manga will remain closely kept secrets.

In 2021, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s creator caught fans off-guard when he announced out of the blue that he was planning on ending the series in two years. In January 2023, Akutami sent rumors of the saga&#39;s ending into overdrive when he posted on Shōnen Jump&#39;s &#34;Mangaka Musing&#34;, how he&#39;d love to end the series within the year. Most recently, in December 2023, Akutami stated that he hoped to end Jujutsu Kaisen by the end of 2024.

This all goes to say that Akutami has been thinking about the end of the series for at least three years. That&#39;s plenty of time to think up a massively interesting conclusion. Moreover, unlike other creators who might be focused on everything they can do to extend the life of the series, Akutami&#39;s clear-eyed focus, at least over the last few years, has likely given him the freedom to write the story to his liking, incorporating all the plots, subplots, and storylines that will leave every Jujutsu Kaisen fan feeling as satisfied with the ending.

Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s fast pace and condensed storyline make it hard to speculate if the series is actually going to end soon. Indeed, even with the deaths of major characters like Satoro Gojo and evil sorcerer Kenjaku, there still seems to be plenty of story left in the saga. Considering all the time Akutami has had to consider Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s final scene, anything rushed, or short of spectacular would be deeply disappointing.

Jujutsu Kaisen is available from Viz Media and MANGA Plus.
