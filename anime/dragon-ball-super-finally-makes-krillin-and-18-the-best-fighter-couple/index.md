# Dragon Ball Super Finally Makes Krillin And 18 The Best Fighter Couple


## SUMMARY 



  Dragon Ball Super showcases Krillin and Android 18 as the best fighter couple in the franchise, with their battle against Cell Max highlighting their unique dynamics.   The manga adaptation of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film adds many moments that paint a great picture of Krillin and 18&#39;s relationship, breaking gender stereotypes in the process.   Krillin saving 18 and 18 later finishing what Krillin started in the battle against Cell Max challenge gender-biased stereotypes and highlight the strength of their partnership.

## Literature Review

Krillin and Android 18&#39;s unique relationship has just proven that they are the best couple in Dragon Ball Super when they&#39;re on the battlefield. 




Warning: Spoilers for Dragon Ball Super chapter #99




The last few chapters of Dragon Ball Super have proven definitively that Krillin and Android 18 are not only the best fighter couple in the franchise, but possibly anime as a whole. Throughout the course of the battle against Cell Max, the two of them have both broken and even respectfully complied with unfortunate gender stereotypes without being offensive. Both ends of the spectrum are even explored in the same chapter.

When battling against Cell Max in the manga&#39;s adaptation of the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero film, Krillin saves Android 18 from a ball of energy by splitting the attack with his Destructo Disc, in chapter #98 of Dragon Ball Super by writer Akira Toriyama and artist Toyotarou.

          

Chapter #99 then sees Krillin first flying over to 18 when Cell Max smashes her with his severed arm. Later in the same chapter, Krillin&#39;s Destructo Disc puts a crack in one of Cell Max&#39;s wings, which 18 fully breaks off by kicking the same damaged part of the rampaging villain&#39;s body.





 Dragon Ball Super Makes Krillin And 18 Shine As A Couple On The Battlefield 
The manga added many moments that were not in the movie, and paint a great picture of the couple.
         

Altogether, Dragon Ball Super is painting a very compelling picture where the unique dynamics of Krillin and 18 not only justify the pandering of an unfortunate gender stereotype but see them also breaking it. Many shonen series perpetuate the ages-old storytelling stereotype of the damsel in distress. However, sometimes the trope can be justified when it is nuanced enough, as it is in Super because Krillin is often depicted as pathetic and a source of comedy relief, while 18 is known for being an awesome, powerful, and cool woman. This makes Krillin saving 18 the exception, and not the rule.

In what only further enhances their dynamic, 18 later has to complete what Krillin started but couldn&#39;t finish, breaking Cell Max&#39;s wing. This breaks the aforementioned gender-biased stereotype by having the woman get the glory. Although the crack that Krillin puts in Cell Max&#39;s wing is a step up from his failure to do the same to the original Cell in DBZ, this latest development in Dragon Ball Super paints the picture that, alone, Krillin isn&#39;t enough, but together with his wife, he is able to finish what he started.




          

Only a unique relationship like Krillin and Android 18&#39;s is able to create the type of dynamic that they showcase in their battle against Cell Max. Dragon Ball Super is not always great at handling stereotypes, but no one can say that Krillin and Android 18 aren&#39;t a highly nuanced couple that gets even better on the battlefield.
