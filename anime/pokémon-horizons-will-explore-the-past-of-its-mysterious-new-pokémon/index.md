## Literature Review

A series of special shorts have been announced for Pokémon Horizons, covering the past of its new focus, the mysterious Terapagos.




Pokémon Horizons&#39; latest story arc is already named after the franchise&#39;s newest Legendary Pokémon, but it seems Terapagos will be getting even more focus with three shorts announced. These shorts are said to focus on Terapagos&#39; past, potentially offering fans of Pokémon Horizons some tantalizing details about its new lore.




With the airing of the thirtieth episode of the new series, a special announcement was made that beginning with episode #31 on December 1st, three special shorts will be accompanying the airing of new episodes in Japan. Entitled &#34;The Glittering Records of Terapagos&#39; Expeditions&#34; according to reliable fan site Serebii.net, these shorts are said to dive into the long history of Terapagos, which once accompanied a legendary adventurer named Lucius, hailed as one of the strongest trainers in the world.

          

This ties in heavily with the main plot of Pokémon Horizons at the moment, which is set on finding Pokémon that once belonged to Lucius, kept in special Ancient Poké Balls.

Little is known about the shorts other than the brief announcement. Presumably, they will follow Terapagos and cover at least some of its time with Lucius, which may mean that fans are about to get their first clear glimpse at the heroic figure. It may also offer introductions to some of Lucius&#39;s Pokémon that have yet to be encountered, such as Entei and Kleavor. The mini-episodes could reveal how Lucius originally found Terapagos, given the Pokémon&#39;s extraordinary rarity and unusual abilities. A look at Terapagos&#39; past is also a look at Lucius, and may provide some valuable insight into this influential character.

The timing of the shorts and their release dates align well with the release of the latest Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC, The Indigo Disk, which is also focused on Terapagos and set for a December 14 release. It&#39;s not known how much Terapagos&#39; backstory will overlap between the anime and the games, as figures like Lucius don&#39;t exist in the games. Still, it seems likely that the shorts may have something substantial left to reveal, with the last of the shorts airing the day after the DLC drops. A special preview showed Terapagos transforming into its &#34;Terastal form,&#34; a larger form that Terapagos uses in battle, and is said to be its true form, although at the moment it&#39;s unclear if that will be in the shorts or the Pokémon Horizons series proper.






 Pokémon Horizons Capitalizes On Its Connection With The Games 
          

The anime has used shorts to deepen the lore around Legendary Pokémon before, but usually as promotion for a movie featuring that Pokémon, as seen with Diancie, for example. It seems like the goal this time around is to push the Scarlet and Violet DLC, so it should be interesting to see how much connection it has to the DLC besides the shared focus on Terapagos. Perhaps fans will get their first glimpse at Paldea&#39;s Area Zero in animated form, something that would surely be exciting. For now, fans will just have to wait for Pokémon Horizons&#39; upcoming episodes and their accompanying shorts to find out.
