In terms of spectacle, few moments can compare with the first appearance of the Colossal Titan in Attack on Titan.

The sheer scale of the creature and the destruction it causes creates a sense of chaos and terror that is unparalleled in anime.

The scene of Edward&#39;s arm returning in Fullmetal Alchemist episode 62 is a tragic culmination of the story up to that point.

He is helpless to Father&#39;s onslaught until his brother, Alphonse, sacrifices his soul in order for Edward&#39;s arm to return.

The moment takes place in episode 73 of the anime.





 5  Naruto: Naruto Befriends Kurama 
        

One of the most satisfying moments in Naruto is in episode 329, when Naruto finally befriends Kurama and unlocks the full power of the Nine Tails.

The scene where Naruto strikes a chord with the demon fox is therefore one fans weren&#39;t even sure was possible, and it shows how his determination and kindness can overcome even the most intense hatred.

There is no doubt that Goku turning Super Saiyan is the most iconic moment in shonen history., occurring in Dragon Ball Z season 3, episode 21.

After witnessing the death of his best friend Krillin at the hands of Frieza, Goku becomes overwhelmed with anger and sorrow.
