## Literature Review

Studio Ghibli&#39;s heroes tend to come in pairs, both of them strengthening and inspiring one another. These Ghibli couples stand out as the most iconic.




Some of the best couples in anime come from the legendary Studio Ghibli, whose protagonists tend to come in pairs, due to the studio’s recurring theme of profound bonds. Director and writer Hayao Miyazaki once said, “I want to portray a slightly different relationship, one where the two mutually inspire each other to live: if I’m able to, then perhaps I’ll be closer to portraying a true expression of love.”
As such, very few Ghibli pairs are explicitly romantic, leaving it ambiguous whether they are close friends, as good as family, or lovers, future or present. However, that isn’t the important part of any of them: what makes them so memorable are the ways they change each other’s lives forever.









 








 10  Ashitaka And San 
Princess Mononoke
        

After being cursed and exiled from his village, Ashitaka makes his way to Iron Town, where he discovers an ongoing conflict between the townspeople seeking to expand into the forest, and the forest spirits determined to protect their land. At the head of the spirits’ forces is San, raised by wolf gods and harboring a fierce hatred of other humans. Ashitaka resolves to bring peace to all of them.
Ashitaka’s determination to protect life at all costs, both human and spirit, earns him San&#39;s grudging respect. The two practically take turns saving one another’s lives as the war of humans, gods, and spirits escalates to the point of nearly destroying all involved. In the ending of Princess Mononoke, not only has Ashitaka found a new home and role, but San openly admits she wants to stay close to him.





 9  Kaguya And Sutemaru 
The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya


As a Moon spirit sent to be raised on Earth, Kaguya is constantly torn between two worlds. She adores humanity and all the small wonders that Earth has to offer, particularly those of the simple mountain village where she spent her childhood. Her closest connection to that home is Sutemaru.
Sutemaru was always been kind to and protective of Kaguya, and they may well have remained close as adults, but they are separated when she becomes a noblewoman. The sequence of Kaguya’s final meeting with her childhood friend, where they soar through the sky together, is one of the most beautiful moments in a stunningly animated film. Sutemaru represents the happiness that Kaguya desperately craves but can never have.





 8  Jiro And Naoko 
The Wind Rises
        

The same wind that lifts Jiro Horikoshi&#39;s war planes into the sky also guide him to the love of his life, Naoko Satomi. They are deeply in love and loyal to one another, and nothing makes them happier than being close to each other. Unfortunately, due to Naoko’s terminal tuberculosis, their lives together are cut off far too soon.
Hayao Miyazaki took considerable liberties with the life of the historical Jiro Horikoshi in writing The Wind Rises. In real life, Jiro’s wife did not have tuberculosis, they lived together long after World War II, and had five children. To drive home the film’s themes of love, loss, and helplessness against change, Miyazaki turned their story into a romantic tragedy.





 7  Kiki And Tombo 
Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service
        

In her journey to finally come of age and come into her own as a witch, Kiki meets and befriends many people in her new town. From her artist friend Ursula to parental figures Osano and Fukuo, they all teach her many valuable lessons. However, the most important part of her growth begins and ends with Tombo.
Tombo is the first person Kiki meets when she arrives in Koriko: awed by her flying in alone on a broomstick, he’s determined to befriend her. The longer Kiki spends in the city, the more obstacles she faces and emotional pitfalls she winds up in, culminating in the loss of her magic. It’s seeing Tombo in the middle of an airship accident that gives her the boost she needs to get back on her broom and regain her magic for good.

 6  Ponyo And Sosuke 
Ponyo


 







Childhood friendships are often the closest and most sincere of all. In this Little Mermaid-esque tale, it is what not only allows Ponyo and Sosuke to stay together, but saves all of humanity from being consumed by the ocean. Even with such powerful magic in the world, their innocent love for one another is stronger than any of it.
The workings of the human and supernatural worlds are too great in scale for either to fully understand. However, what really matters in the end are Ponyo’s determination to be with Sosuke no matter what and Sosuke’s acceptance of Ponyo for all that she is. Since Ponyo is ultimately permitted to become as a human, the ending heavily implies that they will grow up together and stay close their whole lives.





 5  Howl And Sophie 
Howl&#39;s Moving Castle


 







When Sophie is cursed by a witch, she must go to the mysterious wizard Howl for help. Drawn deeper into his world of magic and intrigue, she realizes that it may have been her that was meant to save Howl all along. By the end of her journey, she’s grown more self-confident, seeing herself as strong, smart, and capable, which is just how Howl sees her.
These two are the favorite pairing of many Studio Ghibli fans. Though they are both less delightfully unhinged than they are in Diana Wynne Jones’ originalbooks, they are no less entertaining to watch. Sophie is a kind person who loves Howl, but she also has no problem stopping his drama in its tracks; Howl&#39;s lost heart is restored by Sophie, and his best traits are brought out by his efforts to protect her.





 4  Sheeta And Pazu 
Castle In The Sky
        

Sheeta holds the only connection to Laputa, the legendary floating castle. Pazu has long dreamed of finding Laputa one day. When they are caught up in the dangers of everyone else looking to claim Laputa’s power, only by relying on each other can the two protect their world and escape with their lives.
One of Studio Ghibli’s first movies introduces recurring elements of future projects, like strong environmentalist themes, sweeping scores by Joe Hisaishi, and the template for protagonist pairs. Sheeta and Pazu exemplify many of the positive qualities that Miyazaki enjoys gifting his young heroes: loyalty, honesty, and incredible perseverance.





 3  Shou And Arrietty 
The Secret World Of Arrietty
        

Shou is a lonely boy staying with his aunt before undergoing a risky operation to cure his deadly heart condition, and Arrietty is one of the family of Borrowers secretly living in the house. Humans and Borrowers, as a rule, do not interact, but these two forge a life-changing friendship anyway. Shou’s patient efforts to win the trust of Arrietty’s family are particularly memorable.
They are ultimately forced apart, and, at least in the English dub, Shou confirms that he never sees Arrietty again. In the original Japanese, it’s left ambiguous whether Shou survived his operation or Arietty’s family made it to a new home. However, the time they spent with one another leaves them with renewed hope for the future.





 2  Shizuku And Seiji 
Whisper Of The Heart
        

Before even meeting Seiji Amasawa, Shizuku Tsukishima is fascinated just seeing his name on all the checkout cards of the library books she’s interested in (a first meeting that younger viewers may find charmingly dated). When she discovers that the mysterious Seiji and her annoying classmate are one and the same, she’s appalled. But as they grow closer, Seiji and Shizuku quickly become each other’s strongest supports.
Whisper of the Heart is one of the few Ghibli movies not directed by Miyazaki, but it still stands out as one of the best. Growing up and deciding who you are going to be is always a daunting task: having loved ones backing you up always makes it easier. Shizuku and Seiji are pulled toward different arts, but the lessons they learn about how to pursue their dreams are the same. Though their pursuits ultimately separate them, their love for one another remains.





 1  Chihiro And Haku 
Spirited Away
        

When Chihiro’s parents are cursed, leaving her trapped in the spirit world, Haku is the first spirit she meets, and the first who goes out of his way to help her. Chihiro’s journey teaches her to be brave, selfless, and responsible, all of which she uses to save Haku from his own curse. Ultimately, she departs the Spirit World a stronger person, and leaves it and its people better off than she found them.
Twice, these kids meet purely by chance, and don’t get to stay together for long. But both times, it’s one of the most significant moments of their lives. After being robbed of his river and name, it’s Chihiro’s kindness that gives Haku back his identity; meanwhile, Chihiro wouldn’t have been around to do it if Haku hadn’t saved her life when she fell into his river as a child. Haku promises that they will meet again one day, but even if that isn’t true, their adventure will stay with them their whole lives.
