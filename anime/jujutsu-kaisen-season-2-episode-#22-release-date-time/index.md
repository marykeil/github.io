## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #22 will finish the fight between Yuji and Mahito while reintroducing the sorcerer in Geto&#39;s body into the plot.




Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s epic Shibuya Incident arc is reaching its long-awaited conclusion and Season 2 episode #22 will likely go a long way in setting that up. The arc has been great but it doesn&#39;t have too many dangling plot threads to wrap up so it will likely be able to end on a satisfying note. However, depending on what happens in the final episodes, it may not be a good note for the anime&#39;s protagonists.





 What Time Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #22 Releases 
          

If it isn&#39;t delayed, Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 episode #22 will be airing in Japan at midnight Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Thursday, December 21. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on December 21 at 9 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 11 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Jujutsu Kaisen fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #21 
          




Episode #21 continued the epic fight between Mahito, Yuji, and Todo. The battle pushed all of the combatants to their limits, with Mahito creating a new type of transfigured human and also unlocking a brand new form. While growing this way, the curse focused his efforts on taking Todo out of the fight, as his Boogie Woogie Cursed Technique was too confusing to deal with. This worked temporarily so he shifted focus to killing Yuji in his frightening new body. During this battle, due to Yuji seemingly unlocking the ability to use Black Flash at will and Todo tricking Mahito, the curse suffered a massive defeat and fled pathetically to Geto&#39;s feet asking to be rescued.



The metaphor accompanying Mahito&#39;s defeat was incredibly satisfying after the destruction he&#39;s wrought.






 Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #22 Will Add Geto to the Fight 
          




The appearance of Geto&#39;s body in episode #21 was surprising given the last viewers saw of him he was about to fight Mei Mei and her brother. It was implied that that fight may have concluded given Todo and Arata couldn&#39;t find Gojo&#39;s Prison Realm, but it is unclear how that wrapped up. Episode #22 will likely elaborate on how that confrontation went and whether Mei Mei is still alive. In addition, now that Geto has arrived at Yuji and Mahito&#39;s fight, he will likely take part in it to save Mahito or try and defeat Yuji. However, with how pathetic Mahito looked in episode #21 and the motivations of the intelligent and villainous sorcerer possessing Geto&#39;s body still shrouded in mystery, he may also choose to let Yuji finish Mahito off before fighting himself.

If Geto&#39;s body does join the fight, then Yuji will have a tough time winning. After his long battle against Mahito Yuji is exhausted and so won&#39;t be able to go up against a seemingly fresh special-grade sorcerer. This could make Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #22 the most dangerous episode yet for the seriesâ€™ protagonist.




Don&#39;t miss Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 episode #22 when it airs on Crunchyroll on December 21, 2023.
