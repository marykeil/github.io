## Literature Review

Anime has some of the best stories the horror genre has to offer, and here are ten of the absolute best to add to your watchlist!





Of course, this isn&#39;t limited to live-action properties. Animation has proven itself over the years to be a valid source for some of the scariest horror content due to the fact that it can push the bar without the limitations that real life provides. Anime in particular has given fans some of its most visually creative takes on the genre while also finding compelling ways to have viewers leave the lights on long after the credits begin to roll. Here are ten of the best horror anime that fans can seek out in case they want something a bit scarier to add to their watchlist!









 








 10  Junji Ito Maniac 
        

  Year Released   2023    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Netflix    
Kicking things off is a fairly recent series based around the works of legendary horror mangaka, Junji Ito. This sequel series to the disappointing Junji Ito Collection anime improves on its predecessor in almost every way with much stronger animation animation. Not every story lands, which is expected from an anthology series, but there are certainly more hits than misses with the highlight of the collection being an adaptation of Hanging Balloons that excellently uses sound to make the source story even scarier. Fans of Junji Ito will find a lot to like about this series, and it&#39;s the perfect watch for a scary night inside.
            
 
 Junji Ito Maniac Is A Mixed Bag Of An Anthology, And That&#39;s Okay 
Junji Ito Maniac from Netflix is arguably a mixed collection, but in terms of an anthology, this is actually not a bad thing for an anime.








 9  Housing Complex C 
        

  Year Released   2022    Number of Episodes   4    Where to Stream it   Max    
This terrifying limited anime series from Adult Swim caught many anime fans by surprise as it served as the block&#39;s big Halloween event for 2022, following another delay for Uzumaki. What really works about this series is how much it&#39;s able to convey in just four short episodes. It follows a housing complex of mostly older inhabitants as a new family moves in with a group of international workers. Tensions begin to rise as the inhabitants blame the workers for strange things beginning to happen, including an odd mold slowly creeping toward the building. Housing Complex C is a one-of-a-kind horror story that&#39;s best gone into as blind as possible. It&#39;s a unique series that knows how to effectively deliver its scares with what little time it has, and it leaves a terrific impression when it&#39;s all over.





 8  School-Live! 
        

  Year Released   2015    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   HiDive    
Don&#39;t let the cute exterior or misleading anime opening of this series fool you. School-Live is perhaps one of the most upsetting and horrifying series that fans will ever encounter thanks to its ingenious set-up. The show focuses on a group of girls that live inside their school as they get up to a variety of shenanigans. It all seems fairly harmless until it&#39;s revealed that the main character, Yuki, is imagining everything. In reality, the world has been overtaken by a zombie apocalypse, and the series isn&#39;t afraid to get dark about it. There are major character deaths alongside disturbing psychological moments that have made this a treasured horror series. This is unlike any zombie story fans will ever experience, making it an absolute must-watch.





 7  Higurashi: When They Cry 
        

  Year Released   2006    Number of Episodes   26    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll, Hulu    
This is a horror anime that has lived in infamy among fans for its grotesque use of violence...and yet it still continues to be one of the most recommended for people who love the genre. Higurashi: When They Cry follows a group of kids in a town that&#39;s been cursed by an entity known as Oyashiro. There are multiple arcs throughout the long-running series that usually lead to the brutal death of one or more of the characters before everything gets reset in a mysterious time-loop. Higurashi is a terrifying experience as you learn more and more about the curse plaguing the town, and it&#39;s difficult to stop watching once the show has started..





 6  Shiki 
        

  Year Released   2010    Number of Episodes   22 &#43; 2 OVAs    Where to Stream it   Only available on physical media    
Vampire fans will want to give this series a watch as it gives a bloodcurdling new spin on the bloodthirsty creatures. Shiki follows a small town on the search for a missing girl named Megumi following her discovery of a new family living in a mysterious old household. When they do find her though, she passes away due to anemia and a series of bites they find along her skin. The hunt is on to find out more about what happened to her before more townspeople fall to a horrific force. This is just a good old-fashioned vampire story that works. The only unfortunate thing is that it&#39;s incredibly rare nowadays with physical media being the only way to watch it. However, if you ever find yourself in possession of a copy of this landmark series, make sure not to miss out on this unique horror story.





 5  Perfect Blue 
        

  Year Released   1997    Runtime   81 Minutes    Where to Stream it   AMC&#43;, Shudder    
Taking a break from monsters and curses, Satoshi Kon&#39;s Perfect Blue is a great pick for those who love psychological thrillers. The film follows a former idol who attempts to break free of her public image and become an actress. However, things begin to get surreal as a series of murders take place where she&#39;s the primary suspect...even if she was nowhere near the scene of the crime. This leads to an exploration of her psyche as she tries to figure out what&#39;s happening while facing abstract figures in the shadows. This is a film that&#39;s become a huge influence for other popular works of fiction for its brilliant use of psychological horror and has become a must-watch for cinephiles due to its exceptional use of the visual medium. It&#39;s scary and mind-breaking with its abstract execution, making it perfect viewing for a spooky night.





 4  Death Note 
        

  Year Released   2006    Number of Episodes   37    Where to Stream it   Youtube Premium, Pluto TV, Tubi, Peacock, Roku, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime    
This iconic series based on the Shonen Jump manga by Tsugumi Ohba has become best known as one of the must-watch anime series for those wanting to get into the medium, and it&#39;s easy to see why. This series has become legendary for fans due to its compelling storytelling and thrilling twists that make it one of the most bingeable anime of all time. It follows Light Yagami, a boy who stumbles upon a mysterious notebook called the Death Note. Anytime he writes a name inside it, they die of a heart attack unless otherwise specified. This leads to a game of cat-and-mouse as he attempts to evade detection. While this show may not cause nightmares, Light&#39;s journey will keep viewers on edge as he leaves carnage in his wake to become a god among his human peers and make the world safer...at least, by his standards.





 3  Another (Crunchyroll) 
        

  Year Released   2012    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
The mere premise of Another should be enough to get horror fans on board. Essentially, it&#39;s what would happen if Final Destination became an anime series as a class of cursed students begin to die one-by-one in mysterious accidents. The kills are incredibly creative, using unexpected means to pick off the classmates as they fall to the curse, with the most notable involving an umbrella. If you love the fun of Final Destination mixed with a good mystery, Another is a must-watch that&#39;s perfect for any horror fan.





 2  Mieruko-Chan (Crunchyroll) 
        

  Year Released   2021    Number of Episodes   12    Where to Stream it   Crunchyroll    
At first glance, Mieruko-Chan looks like it should be out of place among the best horror anime ever made. After all, it&#39;s a comedy coming-of-age series about a girl who&#39;s able to see ghosts around her. However, what makes this anime absolutely terrifying are the designs of the undead. The ghosts in this series are nightmare-inducing with their distorted looks and sunken eyes. Sometimes even the levity of comedy isn&#39;t enough to prevent an image of an unsuspecting ghoul into the audience&#39;s mind. Mieruko-Chan is a series that can be incredibly funny, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be equally horrifying as well.





 1  Parasyte -the maxim-  
        

  Year Released   2014    Number of Episodes   24    Where to Stream it   Hulu, Crunchyroll, HiDive    
Not only is Parasyte one of the best horror manga not made by Junji Ito, but it doubles as the best horror anime fans can seek out as well. This sci-fi horror tale tells the story of an alien invasion where parasites bury themselves into human hosts and take over their bodies. However, Shinichi Izumi finds a parsite has buried itself in his arm, taking over his one limb instead. Together, they begin fighting off other parasites to preserve each other&#39;s life. The series is a body horror lover&#39;s dream as it takes a page out of The Thing, showing off some of the most grotesque human-to-alien transitions in the medium. It&#39;s a must-watch for sci-fi horror fans and is bound to become a classic as the years go by.
Horror is a genre that will continue to be popular with fans with every generation. Fear is a common emotion, and the ability to face this state head-on can be both cathartic and endearing for people. It&#39;s amazing to have these options for those who want to have some horror in their anime, and these are some of the best in the genre the medium has to offer.
