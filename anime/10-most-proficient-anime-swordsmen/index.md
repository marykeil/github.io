## Literature Review

Whether their strikes are quick as lightning, or they prefer to use heavy oversized swords, their swordsmanship is unparalleled in the anime world.





Even in the realm of sword fighting, there are plenty of different fighting styles and techniques that can be employed. Some swordsmen may prefer to focus on quick and unexpected strikes, while others may wield oversized swords and overpower their enemies through raw strength. Whether they use a single sword or multiple, great swordsmen know how to adapt to any situation and overcome any obstacle. This list presents anime swordsmen not based on their raw destructive power but on their actual skills in wielding their weapon.









 








 10  Mugen (Samurai Champloo) 
        

Samurai Champloo&#39;s central swordsmen are Mugen and Jin, who act as Fuu&#39;s bodyguards during her search for the &#34;Sunflower Samurai&#34;. There is no clear winner between them, with Jin being the technical one, who learned kenjutsu in a dojo, and Mugen being the reckless one, fighting in a rather erratic manner and relying on his instincts. Still, Mugen&#39;s unpredictable fighting style tends to translate into him being more of a threat in actual fights. Not only is it difficult for his enemies to predict and counter his moves, but he is also shown to be a quick learner, constantly copying his enemies&#39; moves and evolving.





 9  Asta (Black Clover) 
        

Given the series&#39; setting, Black Clover&#39;s most powerful characters are typically those who have mastered the various types of magic present in its world. Although Asta later obtained the unique power to nullify magic, which greatly boosted his potential, he was born without the ability to use magic, yet with the strong desire to become Wizard King, which seemed impossible to most. In spite of that, he trained both his body and his swordsmanship relentlessly, reaching a point where he could boast not only exceptional strength and durability, but also remarkable sword skills in spite of his lack of formal training. Furthermore, Asta&#39;s swords are essentially constructs of his anti-magic, meaning he can wield them as naturally as they were parts of his body.





 8  Dracule Mihawk (One Piece) 
        

While fans may prefer to see Roronoa Zoro here, as he is a central character, he has yet to become One Piece&#39;s strongest swordsman, with that title still being held by Dracule Mihawk instead. Even in a world where the strongest characters are usually defined by the power of their devil fruits, Mihawk can stand toe to toe against the greatest enemies without any such powers, with his strength being based purely on his skills and Haki expertise. His swordsmanship is also shown to be quite versatile, as he can alternate between techniques such as &#34;Strong Blade&#34; and &#34;Gentle Blade&#34; to adapt to the situation. While the true extent of Mihawk&#39;s strength still has to be seen, Zoro&#39;s rematch with Mihawk is one of the scenes that One Piece fans are most eager to see.





 7  Sousuke Aizen (Bleach) 
        

As Bleach&#39;s cast is full of skilled sword fighters, ranking them objectively is no easy task. Some may consider Retsu Unohana to be superior, given her background of having allegedly mastered all the swordsmanship styles in the world, but her role as a healer didn&#39;t allow her to show off these skills to their full extent. Kenpachi Zaraki is a true monster, but he&#39;s not actually a skilled swordsman (and in fact, when he begins to practice techniques later in the series, he becomes even stronger). On the other hand, Sousuke Aizen&#39;s mastery over the sword is made clear, as he is seen to effortlessly take on multiple captains at once. The fact that simply looking at his sword allows Aizen to manipulate his enemy&#39;s perceptions allows him to overpower enemies even without ever using his Bankai.





 6  Saber (Fate/stay night) 
        

Artoria Pendragon, commonly known as Saber, is one of the Fate franchise&#39;s most recognizable characters. Her identity is that of an alternate King Arthur, the legendary hero and King of Knights who wielded Excalibur. In the Fate series, her main role is that of a Servant, participating in the Holy Grail Wars alongside Shirou and Kiritsugu Emiya. Given her background and her mastery of the legendary powerful blade, it should be no surprise that Saber can win a duel against almost anyone. Even though she belongs to the Saber class, she also possesses a significant amount of magical energy, which she uses to cast skills such as Mana Burst, boosting her attack power.





 5  Atomic Samurai (One Punch Man) 
        

Even among the numerous powerful heroes of One Punch Man, Kamikaze, better known as Atomic Samurai, his hero alias, is one of the strongest S-class heroes. Widely recognized as his world&#39;s strongest swordsman, Atomic Samurai boasts not only immense speed and reflexes, as he is shown to strike his enemies in the blink of an eye, but also incredible strength, through which he is able to create shock waves with his slashes. His signature attack is called Atomic Slash, and it lets him perform over 100 slashes within a second, even while dashing, a technique that can easily overpower even the most durable of foes.





 4  Guts (Berserk) 
        

Berserk&#39;s Guts, also known as the &#34;Black Swordsman&#34; has polished his skills in no small part due to necessity. Having to become a child mercenary to survive, he has wielded oversized swords his entire life, resulting in him becoming extremely strong and a true master of the blade. In spite of his stature, he is also surprisingly nimble and agile, easily dodging even the fastest of strikes. While he may not be a particularly strategic fighter, his talent for combat is unrivaled, being able to adapt to any situation. Moreover, Guts has essentially developed his skills by constantly fighting against supernatural opponents that surpass him in almost every apect.





 3  Sakata Gintoki (Gintama) 
        

With Gintama being a comedy title above all, often incorporating gag humor and parodying pop culture, it may be easy to forget just how strong Sakata Gintoki is supposed to be. As a renowned fighter of the Joui war, Gintoki gained the &#34;Shiroyasha&#34; nickname, being compared to an unstoppable demon. Despite being shown to possess incredible strength and speed, as well as a mastery over various types of weapons, he doesn&#39;t rely on his brute strength; instead, he uses his combat experience and intuition to quickly strategize and adapt to the situation, sometimes even tricking his enemies if it nets him a quicker victory.





 2  Yoriichi Tsugikuni (Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba) 
        

As a major recurring character in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Yoriichi Tsugikuni is widely regarded as the strongest Demon Slayer to have ever existed, and for good reason. Firstly, he is the inventor of the powerful Breathing Styles practiced by Demon Slayer Corps, creating the style that even the protagonist Tanjiro Kamado uses. However, even without this ability, his swordsmanship is still considered to be virtually unparalleled; he overwhelmed much more experienced foes from the very first time he picked up a sword as a child, and continued to perform miraculous feats ever since, such as employing a variety of techniques to effortlessly overpower even the Demon King.





 1  Kenshin Himura (Rurouni Kenshin) 
        

Rurouni Kenshin&#39;s titular protagonist is Kenshin Himura, known for being a legendary hitokiri, an elite assassin who often killed others under orders from the government. His swordsmanship is legendary and unrivaled, with his skills playing a vital role in the revolution that brought the end of the war and made way for the Meiji era. Not only are his strikes so precise that he can cut neatly enough for sliced objects to be reattached, but he is also faster than most humans can see, using his agility to run across walls, jump off terrain, and strike enemies before they even notice.
While some may use magic or other supernatural talents to amplify their skills, most of the swordsmen on this list rely on nothing but their physical abilities and years of practice to defeat their foes. Moreover, they tend to see each fight as yet another opportunity to further hone their abilities, learning new techniques and new ways to counter enemies. Regardless of which fighting styles and techniques they chose to master, they all stand at the apex of the swordsmanship world, waiting for the next generations of anime swordsmen to challenge their legacy.
