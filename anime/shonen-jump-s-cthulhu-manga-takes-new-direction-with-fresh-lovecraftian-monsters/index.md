# Shonen Jump s Cthulhu Manga Takes New Direction With Fresh Lovecraftian Monsters


## SUMMARY 



  Ghost Reaper Girl takes a dramatic turn with the introduction of two Lovecraftian monsters, Hastur and Bastet, who play a crucial role in the current plot.   The inclusion of characters created by other Lovecraftian authors shows that mangaka Akissa Saiké considers their work as canon and expands the scope of the story beyond Lovecraft&#39;s original writings.   The Drops of Decay, a poison featured in the manga, is not found in Lovecraft&#39;s mythology, but Saiké incorporates ideas of poison and decay from Lovecraft&#39;s works to create original elements in Ghost Reaper Girl.

## Literature Review

Ghost Reaper Girl completely changes its overall formula with namesakes from Lovecraftian mythology not created by HP Lovecraft leading the charge.




Warning: Spoilers for Ghost Reaper Girl chapter #37A Shonen Jump manga called Ghost Reaper Girl which draws heavily from HP Lovecraft&#39;s Cthulhu Mythos has taken a dramatic turn using two Lovecraftian monsters that Lovecraft himself didn&#39;t invent. Ghost Reaper Girl recently resumed serialization in Shonen Jump&#39;s Manga PLUS internationally and Shonen Jump&#43; in Japan after a more than year-long hiatus.




In chapter #37 of Ghost Reaper Girl by Akissa Saiké, the hero Chloe Love drinks a poison from Hastur, the president of her supernatural employer, but Hastur&#39;s high-ranking companion, Pope of West Capital Church Bastet, is compelled to try and save her.

          

The poison, called the Drops of Decay, corrodes the drinker&#39;s soul until they become a puppet of Hastur. Hastur had intended to trick Chloe&#39;s friend Kai Iod into drinking the poison due to Kai possessing the Silver Key that can open the gates of Hades anywhere and for recently succumbing to his alternate ego, the Yog of Destruction. However, Chloe heroically stepped in to save his life - at the expense of her own.

This development is quite a shift in the overall story. Chloe has mostly hunted ghosts with her spirit friends under the watchful eye of director Nyarlathotep, but now they are all at the mercy of two new characters who share the namesakes of Lovecraftian monsters, Bastet and Hastur. The fact that Bastet and Hastur serve as the current plot&#39;s main drivers is intriguing since HP Lovecraft didn&#39;t create them, though they do appear in the Cthulhu Mythos to some degree.

Hastur is actually the creation of author Ambrose Bierce. Lovecraft was so enamored by Bierce&#39;s so-called god of shepherds that he included the name in his story &#34;The Whisperer in Darkness,&#34; though it was only mentioned in passing as an ambiguous entity. Hastur would only be fleshed out later on by Lovecraft&#39;s inner circle, and it&#39;s clear that Ghost Reaper Girl is influenced more so by their renditions of him than what Lovecraft wrote. Meanwhile, Bastet is based upon the actual Egyptian feline goddess of the same, and she only appears in a short story by the Lovecraftian author Robert Bloch. Lovecraft never actually included her in any of his works, either, though he did write extensively about cats and the supernatural, like in &#34;The Cats of Ulthar.&#34;






 Ghost Reaper Girl Expands Lovecraft&#39;s Mythos With New Ideas 
          

Although this isn&#39;t the first time that Ghost Reaper Girl has featured characters based on other Lovecraftian authors, these two are by far the most important, and their importance clearly establishes that mangaka Akissa Saiké views the work of every Lovecraftian author as canon.

Much like how Hastur and Bastet aren&#39;t strictly Lovecraft&#39;s creations, Hastur&#39;s Drops of Decay don&#39;t appear in any of his works. In fact, it isn&#39;t a term in Lovecraftian mythology at all. However, Lovecraft did write about poison, like the meteorite that contaminates the soil in &#34;The Colour Out of Space.&#34; The concept of decay is also prevalent in his works, like the line, &#34;That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die,” from &#34;The Nameless City.&#34; This, and other original creations, are proof of mangaka Akissa Saiké&#39;s brilliance. Although Ghost Reaper Girl is deeply inspired by Cthulhu, the manga is very much one of a kind.
