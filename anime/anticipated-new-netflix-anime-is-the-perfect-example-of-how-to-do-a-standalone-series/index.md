## Literature Review

The upcoming Pluto adaptation is based on a story arc from Astro Boy, but this sci-fi mystery does not require slavish Tezuka foreknowledge.





Pluto reimagines the &#34;Greatest Robot on Earth&#34; story arc of Astro Boy, turning the rollicking robot adventure into a moody murder mystery full of twists and turns. As such, Atom, Ochanomizu, Tenma, and others appear with little introduction. Yet even though Pluto reuses the same bones as Tezuka&#39;s story, both the manga and the upcoming anime can both be followed with little trouble, regardless of the familiar faces.

 Pluto Stands On Its Own, Without Astro Boy 

 

Like many reimaginings, half the fun of Pluto is seeing how the characters of Astro Boy have been changed to suit the new story. Indeed, some of the story&#39;s plot twists involving the titular antagonist use a Tezuka fan&#39;s assumed knowledge against them. Because of that, there can be a mistaken assumption that &#34;properly appreciating&#34; Pluto requires also reading &#34;The Greatest Robot on Earth&#34;, or even all the Astro Boy stories that preceded it. While doing so might enhance the surprises, Naoki Urasawa ultimately uses his predecessor&#39;s work to write a story that charts its own course into brand-new territory.




Urasawa&#39;s enhancements to the story include the treatment of characters as actual characters - the majority of Pluto&#39;s targets in Astro Boy were treated more like excuses to increase Pluto&#39;s menace ahead of his showdown with Atom himself. Now, they are veterans with whole lives and histories that are cruelly cut short. The character Gesicht best exemplifies this: merely just another &#34;powerful robot&#34; with a detective gimmick in Astro Boy, he becomes Pluto&#39;s main protagonist as a solemn and dutiful investigator who is plagued by nightmares and memory issues even as he tries to find out the answers behind the killings.

Pluto&#39;s unusual choice to rewrite just one part of Astro Boy allows them to exist independently of each other. Reboots often feel compelled to reference everyone and everything to prove it&#39;s &#34;done its homework&#34;. Urasawa, on the other hand, only needed enough of the original to make a compelling mystery thriller. Pluto is even willing to write completely original details, such as a fictional war between two countries which becomes a vital clue. While one is indebted to the other, Pluto is not a retread; viewers can watch it on its own merits, rather than focus on its retrofit parts.
