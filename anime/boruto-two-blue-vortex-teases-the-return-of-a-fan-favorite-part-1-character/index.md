## Literature Review

The latest chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex hints at the return of an important character from Part 1 that fans were eager to see again.





Kashin Koji is another creation of the mad scientist Amado, made to take down Jigen. Although it is still not known how Amado got his hands on Jiraiya&#39;s DNA, it was still a great choice to go with Jiraiya as his love for the Konoha village would certainly make him view Jigen as an enemy. He unfortunately disappeared after he survived his confrontation from Jigen, but now there&#39;s a very likely possibility that he will be back.




          

Just like Kashin Koji did when he infiltrated the Hidden Leaf, Boruto is now spying using toads, the trademark companions of those who have mastered Sage Arts. Although Boruto could&#39;ve gathered these new allies if he studied at Mt. Myobuku, it would certainly be more satisfying if he had now allied himself with Kashin Koji, who would thus soon make his return.

                  Boruto&#39;s Jiraya Clone Will Come Back After The Time Skip - Here&#39;s Why   Jiraiyaâ€™s clone Koji Kashin was created to resist Isshiki, but his knowledge and abilities will be needed more than ever after the Boruto time skip.   


 Kashin Koji Will Be An Important Character In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex 
          




At the end of chapter #3 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, Boruto communicates with a toad that he planted on Code&#39;s body when he attacked him with his new Rasengan Uzuhiko. The toad was relaying information about where Code escaped to and if there was a sign of the Ten-Tails. There could be several explanations as to how Boruto is now allied with the toads, but the most likely one is that he got into contact with Kashin Koji, who disappeared during the Kara Arc after his confrontation with Jigen. This would be great for all the fans who wished they had learned more about Jiraiya&#39;s clone during part 1.

It seems that Boruto is now following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather, and Jiraiya, all of whom were allied with the toads of Mt. Myoboku. This opens up all types of possibilities for the young ninja, as he could now use Summoning Jutsu or even the powerful Sage Mode, which could bring him to a whole new level of strength. Another interesting thing is that Boruto didn&#39;t just focus on his combat skills while he was away. He trained in other crucial aspects of being a ninja such as infiltration and spying. This is another trait he now shares with his mentor Sasuke, who has always been a cunning shinobi.






 Koji&#39;s Return Would Make Jiraiya&#39;s Fans Happy 
          

Although it is all speculation at this point, the chance that Kashin Koji is back is very real. Kashin used toads to spy on the Hidden Leaf in the past, so Boruto now doing the same likely means that he learned this trick from him. Fans quickly fell for Kashin as he is literally the second coming of Jiraiya, who is one of the most popular characters in the franchise. The possibility that Kashin taught Boruto would be a great callback to Jiraiya&#39;s relationship with Naruto, making for a wholesome moment in an arc that is sure to be filled with blood and sadness.
