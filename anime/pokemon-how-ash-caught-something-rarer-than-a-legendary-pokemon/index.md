## Literature Review

Mythical Pokemon are rarer than legendary Pokemon, so how did Ash catch one before a legendary Pokemon?




Mythical Pokémon are so rare their existence is questioned, but Ash Ketchum has caught one in a big first. After 23 years of the wildly successful franchise, Ash caught his first Mythical Pokémon, a category of Pokémon even rarer Legendary. That’s why it was a shock to the crowd in the Pokémon the Series: Sun and Moon Ultra Legends episode “Final Rivals!” when Ash reveals his first fighter is Melmetal.




For casual fans wondering if Melmetal is a Legendary Pokémon, the answer is no—it&#39;s actually much rarer, and there is a clear difference between Mythical and Legendary Pokémon.

          

Ash has had multiple encounters with Legendary Pokémon throughout the series but has never captured one, despite forming close bonds with a few in the wild. Melmetal was something of a surprise to Ash; he had previously caught its lower form, Meltan, but had no expectation that Meltan might evolve into something greater.


 Mythical Pokémon Are Even Rarer Than Legendary Pokémon 
          




Legendary Pokémon are canonically rare to catch, but they often get a lot of screen time and interactions with Ash, while Mythicals are much more rarely featured, amplifying the surrounding mystery with their minimal appearances. One of the most well-known Legendary Pokémon is Mewtwo, which first appeared in the 1996 games Pokémon Red and Blue. Since then, many species of Legendary Pokémon have been on-screen, and there are many reasons why Ash never caught a Legendary Pokémon. Some were too dangerous to train, while others preferred freedom to being caught.

What&#39;s interesting is that Ash didn’t go out of his way to catch this Mythical Pokémon. He caught Meltan who, on the eve of the Alola League tournament, sent out a signal to its fellow Meltan. They all performed a dance and chant, and as they merged together, the Meltan evolved into Melmetal. Meltan is the only Mythical Pokémon that evolves, and it&#39;s ruled that Ash can use him in the tournament battle. Meltan&#39;s personality didn&#39;t change too much when evolving, thankfully; Melmetal is less timid than its former self but is still loyal to its friends, including Ash and Rowlet. Ash still owns Melmetal. However, he left it in Professor Kukui&#39;s care in Alola.






 What Are Mythical Pokémon? 
          

There&#39;s a lot of confusion surrounding Mythical Pokémon: where they come from, what they&#39;re capable of, and how they differ from Legendaries. This has been especially true among older and casual Pokémon fans, of which the colorful, nostalgia-rich franchise has many. The category of Mythical Pokémon first showed up in the 2010 games Pokémon Black and White as a means of describing a class of &#34;secret&#34; Pokémon that emerged naturally.

Pokémon such as the &#34;Ancestor of all Pokémon,&#34; Mew, which were previously considered Legendary, were redefined into this Mythical class to emphasize their rarity. In the games, Mythical Pokémon are not natively available to be caught and are almost exclusively distributed via infrequent special events, making them highly coveted by collectors. For Ash to stumble into one accidentally is incredible luck, and far luckier to have caught and evolved it.




The Mythical Pokémon category has grown over time, and now includes 23 species of Pokémon. While they&#39;ve become easier to obtain over the years, they&#39;re still among the most difficult to find. Melmetal remains the only one capable of evolving, making it a perfect choice for Ash. While Ash never did catch a Legendary, his ownership of Melmetal, along with his long-awaited World Champion victory, still places him in the highest tier of trainers seen in the Pokémon anime.
