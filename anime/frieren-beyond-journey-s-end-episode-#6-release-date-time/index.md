## Literature Review

After introducing Stark in episode #5, Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End is poised to use him to defeat a dragon despite his apparent cowardice.





 What Time Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #6 Releases 
          




Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #6 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, October 13. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 13 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 10 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.



 What Happened in Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #5? 
          

Episode #5 featured two main subplots. The first involved Frieren and Fern defeating some evil magical creatures that lured humans into danger by pretending to be the ghosts of their loved ones. This was a touching story that highlighted the pain of loss that Frieren feels as a nearly immortal being. The second plot featured Frieren trying to acquire a book from a dragon&#39;s nest and enlisting an adventurer to help her do it. This warrior is Stark, the disciple of Frieren&#39;s friend Eisen who is a self-professed coward. However, at the end of the episode, it is revealed that he is more powerful than he looks as he turns a large cliff into a canyon.






 Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End Episode #6 Will Feature a Dragon Fight 
          

Despite Stark&#39;s apparent cowardice, he is built up to become an important character as shown in the show&#39;s OP (which is a beautiful song made by the creators of Oshi no Ko&#39;s hit theme song). Given this, he will likely accompany Frieren and Fern on their journey north after proving himself by helping them defeat the dragon. Since the dragon was incredibly tough to defeat in episode #5 and Frieren innovates on many classic fantasy tropes, the three adventurers could also come to a more peaceful conclusion. Either way, if the clash against the demon in episode #3 is any indication, the show is sure to feature some beautiful fight animation for however long the battle lasts.

After Frieren, Fern, and Stark deal with the dragon, it is unclear what they will do next. They are sure to continue north toward the land of the dead, but the next adventure they encounter on their way is a mystery. Wherever Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End takes its main characters next in episode #6 though, it will surely live up to the high level of quality that the adventures in the previous episodes have set.




Don&#39;t miss Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End episode #6 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 13, 2023.
