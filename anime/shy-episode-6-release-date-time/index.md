## Literature Review

SHY episode #5 was a well-deserved breather episode, but it was filled with great character moments, and here&#39;s when episode #6 will follow them up.




SHY episode #6 will probably pick up the pace after episode #5 gave the series a deserved breather. Episode #5 kept things pretty slow, but it was a welcome change of pace after weeks of nonstop action and had a lot of great character moments for its lead and other members of the cast. All in all, there was a lot that episode #5 did right, and it leaves a lot to be excited about for episode #6.





 What Time SHY Episode #6 Releases 
          

As with previous episodes, SHY streams exclusively on Crunchyroll, which can be accessed either through their website, their app, or Amazon Prime. Episode #6 should premiere on Crunchyroll on Monday, November 6, at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (PST) and 12:00 PM Eastern (EST) in the United States and at 4:00 PM Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in the United Kingdom.

                  New Anime is the Superhero &amp; Magical Girl Fusion Fans Didn&#39;t Know They Needed   Despite its superhero mold, SHY&#39;s story structure takes more than a few cues from the Magical Girl genre, which is a welcome twist to the genre.   



 What Happened In SHY Episode #5? 
          




SHY episode #5, “Shine the Light”, was split into two different stories centered around Teru’s character development. In the first story, Teru found herself hiking up a mountain with Piltz, Lady Black’s civilian identity, despite her lack of physical prowess. After hiking to the top, Piltz revealed that she uses prosthetic legs after suffering an accident as a child, and she got into hiking as a way to prove to herself and others that she was still capable. Teru realized that Piltz was trying to tell her to be more confident, and the story ends with Teru wanting to find her own form of conquering a mountain one day.

                  Crunchyroll&#39;s New Superhero Anime Fixes One Of My Hero Academia&#39;s Biggest Problems   SHY is a brand-new superhero anime airing on Crunchyroll, and it&#39;s already avoiding a big problem with its major contemporary, My Hero Academia.   

The second story of SHY episode #5 saw Teru struggling to use her fire powers on demand. With the issue on her mind throughout school, Teru wound up sitting in on her school’s calligraphy club after being charmed by their work and learning about the importance of putting your feelings into your words. From there, Teru realized that her problem was that she was failing to properly visualize her fire powers taking form, and by using calligraphy as a medium, she was finally able to activate her fire powers for the first time since her fight with Stardust in episode #4.






 SHY’s Training Arc Was Perfect For Its Kind Of Story 
          

SHY episode #5 can essentially be seen as a small training arc for Teru, and it was structured in a way that’s perfect for this kind of story. SHY, befitting its magical girl leanings, is a story that’s very much about the emotions of the characters, so seeing Teru get stronger not by doing anything physical, but by becoming more in tune with her emotions to unlock her powers, is the exact sort of training arc the story should be engaging in. SHY has continually excelled at maintaining the emotional aspects of its story, and it will be great to see how episode #6 and beyond continue that. Be sure to watch SHY episode #6 when it releases on November 6.
