In a medium as varied and creative as manhwa, even a genre such as romance is bound to include a variety of different titles, ranging from grounded and relatable ones to supernatural and exciting ones. However, what the best ones have in common is that they all beautifully depict the different dimensions of romance, with all of its inherent highs and lows.









 








 10  Orange Marmalade 
        

Set in a world where vampires coexist with humans, Orange Marmalade revolves around a classic situation of forbidden love, wherein two people manage to overcome their differences and find happiness together. Although the existence of vampires is neither a myth nor a secret, humans fear and despise them greatly, which is why they are forced to hide their identities. Baek Ma Ri, a young vampire disillusioned with the idea of interpersonal relationships due to past events and discrimination, ends up coming across Jung Jae Min, a likewise troubled boy who slowly but surely falls for her, resulting in a beautiful tale depicting the power and resilience of love.





 9  Operation: True Love 
        

Operation: True Love takes the classic complicated situation of high-school love and utilizes a supernatural twist to create one of the best romance stories. The story revolves around Su-Ae Sim, a girl stuck in an unfortunate relationship with an indifferent boyfriend, Min-U Kang, who never seems to put in equal effort, failing to respond to her feelings appropriately. However, her life starts to change when a sentient phone named Jellypop suddenly shows up in her locker, commenting on her love life and choices. Drifting away from her boyfriend and getting closer to others, Su-Ae starts what true love is about and what it&#39;s supposed to feel like.





 8  See, Hear, Love 
        

See, Hear, Love follows the unique romantic journey of Min Geun Soo, who can&#39;t see, and Jeon So Ri, who can&#39;t hear. Geun Soo used to be a manhwa artist, but the desperate need to take care of himself and his mother pushed him to his limits, to the point where the strain caused him to lose his eyesight. This was naturally a devastating development for him, but it&#39;s also what allowed him to meet So Ri, a deaf girl who fell in love, first with his work, and then with him as a person. Their relationship is not one without obstacles and difficult choices, but true love always prevails.





 7  Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion 
        

The trope of an ordinary person suddenly waking up in the world of a fictional world is a common one in isekai stories, but these characters typically end up being either the heroes or villains of their respective titles. This is where Why Raeliana Ended Up at the Duke&#39;s Mansion, as the titular Raeliana is but an unimportant side character, fated to die at the end of her fiancÃ©. Aware of what awaits her, and unwilling to accept this fate, Raeliana looks to Duke Noah Volstaire Wynknight with the intention of changing the story and ensuring her survival, without realizing she is about to genuinely fall in love with him.





 6  A Good Day to Be a Dog 
        

One thing that is clearly identifiable from its title is that A Good Day to Be a Dog is a truly unique romance story, unlike any other. The story follows Han Hana, a teacher afflicted with a strange family curse, which turns her into a dog the first time she kisses someone. The only way to break this curse is to get a second kiss from the same person, while still in the form of a dog. Ironically enough, the one person she ends up kissing is Jin Seon, a coworker who is simply terrified of dogs. In spite of its unserious-sounding title, this story proves to be genuinely entertaining.





 5  Bastard 
        

Bastard is a truly unique title as well as one of the best manhwa on Webtoon, as it is significantly darker compared to the other entries on this list. It follows the life of Seon Jin, a boy seemingly fated to never find peace, as he has to deal with bullies at school and a psychopatic father at home, who forces him to assist in murdering innocent people and hiding their traces. However, his hopeless prospects begin to change when a ray of sunlight enters his world, in the form of Yoon Kyun, a girl who not only helps him escape his situation but also teaches him about love.





 4  Girls of the Wild&#39;s 
        

The events of Girls of the Wild&#39;s take place in the titular Wild&#39;s Private High School, an elite all-girls school focused on producing the strongest warriors in the martial arts world. When this school changes its policy and allows male applicants, only one is brave enough to apply. Having obtained the scholarship that he so desperately needed, Song Jae Gu may consider himself lucky, but he soon learns that this environment is unlike any other, and that he can&#39;t survive without learning to fight. Despite being tense and action-packed, this unique martial arts story still allows Jae Gu time to fall in love and develop relationships with various interesting strong girls.





 3  Something About Us 
        

Something About Us proves that there is no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to romance, as the age-old tale of childhood friends growing closer and falling in love will always be enjoyable, provided the execution is competent. The story revolves around Woojin Han and Gayong Doh, who became the best of friends in high school, forming a genuine friendship based on trust and mutual respect. However, as they grew older and continued to explore each other and themselves in their college years, their relationship likewise evolved. The realistic characters and heartwarming interactions set this title apart from others, in spite of its common premise.





 2  Seasons of Blossom 
        

Seasons of Blossom follows not one, but multiple different love stories. With all of these stories taking place between adolescents just learning what life and love are about, the title succeeds not only as a romance story, but also as an exploration of youth in general, depicting themes such as mental health and bullying. Still, above all, it remains a brilliant and touching study of love, with all of its ups and downs. From the happy moments and precious memories, to the turmoils of romance and complicated nature of interpersonal relationships, the genuine and realistic characters portrayed here experience all ranges of emotions.





 1  Who Made Me a Princess 
        

Who Made Me a Princess is a fairly typical isekai romance story of a woman from modern-day Korea who suddenly finds herself as the secondary character of a novel she was reading. Now bearing the identity of Athanasia de Alger Obel, a secondary character in &#34;The Lovely Princess&#34;, she must find a way to change the story, as her fate is initially a tragic one, of dying at the hands of a father who, due to her mother dying in childbirth, never showed her any affection. In the midst of trying to ensure her survival, Athanasia also manages to develop friendships and romantic relationships in this new magical world.
From realistic settings to fantastical ones, romance stories can take place in just about any kind of world. Sometimes, it&#39;s a story of long-time friends realizing that their feelings for each other may run deeper than expected, while at other times, it&#39;s a story of forbidden love, which can only happen once individual differences and specific circumstances are overcome. The complexities of human relationships are always interesting to explore, and the best romance manhwa present and develop these relationships in a way that&#39;s uniquely captivating and lovely.
