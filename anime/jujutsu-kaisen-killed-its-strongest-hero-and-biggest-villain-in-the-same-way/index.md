## Literature Review

While Gojo and Kenjaku are mortal enemies, the mindsets they held during their final battles show why the two have more in common than fans think.




Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for Jujutsu Kaisen #243Fans of Jujutsu Kasien were treated to yet another unexpected ending to a fight when Kenjaku was apparently killed at the end of a fight that was set up to end with his victory. Even more surprising was how Kenjaku&#39;s defeat mirrored Gojo&#39;s demise to Sukuna. In fact, if he hopes to survive, Sukuna would be wise to learn a thing or two about the unbearable pride of being a master sorcerer.




Over the last few chapters, with the Culling Game over and his &#34;partner&#34; Sukuna focused on battling Gojo and his students, Kenjaku has been busy tying up loose ends. This mainly involved rounding up and killing all the remaining Culling Game participants, the curses and sorcerers Kenjaku had corralled into playing but who are now no longer necessary to his plans. With a &#34;surveillance system&#34; that could track cursed energy in any of the colonies that were used as one of the game&#39;s arenas - finding survivors was simple and effective.

          

Since most of the survivors were busy trying to get away from Kenjaku, he was surprised that Gojo&#39;s ally Fumihiko Takaba came looking for him. While he was wary of Takaba&#39;s abilities, he did not see him as a threat - perhaps a misdirection to draw him away from whatever scheme Gojo, or now more precisely, his students were thinking of deploying. In any event, Kenjaku - the master-class sorcerer, was not particularly worried, and like Gojo before him, that confidence in his own abilities proved to be his ultimate downfall.





 Kenjaku Literally Lost His Head In Takaba&#39;s Game 
          

Takaba&#39;s cursed technique can be extremely powerful. It allows him to literally make or do anything he thinks up or imagines, as long as his confidence level in his comedic skills is high. Kenjaku surmised correctly that, as Takaba&#39;s one true desire was to be an appreciated comedian, if he satisfied that by playing the role of the partner Takaba never had, his opponent would lose the will to fight. While that plan ultimately worked, Kenjaku was so sure that he would succeed that he lowered his guard and fully participated in Takaba&#39;s fantasy, because Kenjaku is himself a big comedy fan. Unfortunately for him, he overlooked that Takaba was so happy that he didn&#39;t want anyone to interrupt his fantasy, meaning that Kenjaku was unable to perceive the approaching Yuta, who took his head.




While Gojo&#39;s death was completely different and unrelated, his mindset before the end came was identical to Kenjaku&#39;s. Indeed, like Kenjaku, Gojo was so focused on overcoming Sukuna&#39;s Mahoraga, that he totally missed Sukuna&#39;s tweak to the attack. Like Kenjaku, Gojo was so engrossed in a battle he was truly enjoying that he overlooked a fatal detail. Gojo and Kenjaku were both so confident in their cursed technique, planning, and strategy that they did not think they could fail in their understanding of the situation. Their over-confidence caused a rigidity in their thinking such that they ignored or miscalculated an asymmetrical strategy that completely discombobulated their theory of the fight.



 The Legacies of Gojo and Kenjaku 
          

It&#39;s fitting that creator Gege Akutami would have Gojo and Kenjaku go out in the same manner. As the two bookends of the story, they have a lot in common. They both believe that might makes right, even if they are supported by different sets of values. Gojo and Kenjaku have both expressed their disgust for the established jujutsu society, but while Gojo decided to keep operating inside the system, Kenjaku set out to start a revolution that would change the human race completely. Their passing doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve seen the last of them, however. As Kenjaku suggested with his last breath, both their wills will continue on in their progeny, their surviving students, disciples, and associates, that will carry on Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s exciting story.
