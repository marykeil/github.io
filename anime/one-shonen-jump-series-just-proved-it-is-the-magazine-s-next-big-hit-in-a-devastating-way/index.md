## Literature Review

The new sword-fighting series Kagurabachi could be Shonen Jump&#39;s next big hit, based on its brutal new chapter that shared a lot with Chainsaw Man.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Kagurabachi Chapter #16 and the first season of Chainsaw Man!




In its latest chapter, one Shonen Jump series just proved that it will be the magazine&#39;s next Chainsaw Man level hit in a devastating way. That series is Kagurabachi by Takeru Hokazono, which already had a lot of hype going into it from its very first chapter. However, while a lot of that hype was built from memes surrounding the series, its latest installment shows that the series itself is no joke.

The beginning of this arc of Kagurabachi introduced a quirky group of government officials who seemed set up to play a large role in the series overall. The main character Chihiro helped them come up with a plan to defeat the murderous Sojo, who possesses one of the powerful swords created by Chihiro&#39;s father. In chapter #16, translated by Camellia Nieh with lettering by Phil Christie, this plan initially seems to be going well, with Sojo taking some major hits.

          




However, he is able to quickly turn the fight around, killing all the members of the government task force and confronting Chihiro directly to engage in a one-on-one duel.


 Kagurabachi Could Be Shonen Jump&#39;s Next Chainsaw Man 
          

This is very reminiscent of how the hit manga Chainsaw Man handled its Devil Hunters. After introducing many of them at a dinner scene, the series then shockingly killed off most of them in Katana Man&#39;s attack against the organization. This was an unexpected twist that made it feel like none of the side characters in the series were safe and showed that Chainsaw Man was different from its more typical Shonen counterparts. In many ways Kagurabachi just surpassed this excellent twist by making many of the characters killed more visually distinct then the devil hunters such as the masked Kugara.




Unfortunately for Kagurabachi, now that Chainsaw Man pulled a similar twist, these shocking deaths alone may not be enough to propel the series into popularity. After its opening chapter was hyped up as a meme, it seems like some readers just wrote the series off as not being seriously worth their time. While it is true that after its opening chapter, Kagurabachi had a bit of a slow start, its latest plot developments have really ramped up the pace of the series and made it a manga that readers should give a chance. Hopefully, its similarities to Chainsaw Man will help it instead of hurting it.



Beyond its shocking nature, Kagurabachi also has many differences from Chainsaw Man that set it apart.






 Hopefully Kagurabachi Will Last Long Enough in Shonen Jump to Be a Hit 
          




Kagurabachi is still at risk of potentially being canceled by Shonen Jump and joining the Under 19 Club. This would be a shame as with its latest chapter it has proven that the series is willing to take some exciting risks that make it more innovative than it might seem at first glance. Hopefully, more fans will realize how great Kagurabachi is and make this one of Shonen Jump&#39;s next major hits.
