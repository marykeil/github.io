Kon is best known for his directing and writing work on Millennium Actress (2001), Memories (1995), Paprika (2006), and Perfect Blue (1997).

The movie will be shown at select theaters as part of Anime Expo Cinema Nights, which can be checked at the official AX Cinema Nights site.

 Anime Expo Cinema Nights Brings Tokyo Godfathers Back to Theaters 20 Years After Release 
Satoshi Kon&#39;s emotional Christmas story is a must-watch for anime fans.

 

AX Cinema Nights is a year-round movie event series celebrating the best new and classic anime films by bringing them to theaters across North America. It provides the passionate fan community with immersive and unforgettable experiences beyond the annual Anime Expo. Taking place at Christmas time, this will be a perfect seasonal offering for anime fans, particularly those who are fond of Satoshi Kon&#39;s iconic work. The film was produced by Madhouse and won several awards when it was first released to audiences. It features a screenplay by Satoshi Kon and Keiko Nobumoto, who is best known for writing the hit classic anime, Cowboy Bebop. Check out the synopsis for Tokyo Godfathers here:


On Christmas Eve, three homeless companions stumble upon a baby girl in a garbage heap. They name her Kiyoko, and vow to care for her as they track down her family. Haunted by memories of their own broken pasts and pursued by a cast of shadowy characters from Tokyo&#39;s nightlife, Hana, Gin and Miyuki overcome their differences and learn to trust one another as a new, makeshift family. With the New Year fast approaching, the mystery behind baby Kiyoko deepens, and these unlikely heroes discover the surprising -- and sometimes miraculous -- connections that have brought them all together. Co-written by Keiko Nobumoto (Cowboy Bebop) and featuring a whimsical score by Keiichi Suzuki, TOKYO GODFATHERS is a masterpiece by turns heartfelt, hilarious, and highly original, a tale of hope and redemption in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.







 Satoshi Kon&#39;s Animated Christmas Film Tackles Found Family And Redemption 
         

Tokyo Godfathers centers around themes of found family while employing its own version of Christmas miracles. However, it is a commentary on family and the idea of making one&#39;s own in tough situations. The Christmas setting should not mean new viewers should take it as a lighthearted seasonal film like so many American classics centered around the holiday. It is an adult film with serious themes despite its inclusion of humorous moments. Anime fans wanting to revisit this classic with a big screen experience, or those wanting to experience it for the first time the way it would&#39;ve been shown twenty years ago shouldn&#39;t miss this special cinematic event.

Tokyo Grandfathers will be available to view in cinemas December 11 - 13.
