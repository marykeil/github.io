# Crunchyroll s New Workplace Comedy Captures What Made Zom 100 A Success


## SUMMARY 



  My New Boss is Goofy portrays an adorable and healing workplace dynamic between Momose and his boss, Shirosaki.   Shirosaki&#39;s quirky personality and kind gestures help Momose cope with his past traumatic work experiences, which are also the subject of the recent hit Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead.   Unlike Zom 100, this anime presents a heartwarming story without zombies, but still provides a touching and realistic portrayal of personal growth.

## Literature Review

My New Boss is Goofy actually shares one key similarity with Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, meaning it could resonate with a lot of anime fans.




While there are no zombies or an impending apocalypse in Crunchyroll&#39;s new anime My New Boss is Goofy, this workplace comedy explores an unfortunate real-life culture that also plagues the protagonist in the critically acclaimed Zom 100: Bucket List for the Dead. Both Zom 100&#39;s Akira and My New Boss is Goofy&#39;s Momose were unfortunately employed in an overly toxic office environment that traumatized them before liberating themselves.




My New Boss is Goofy doesn&#39;t impact viewers by way of how ridiculously ironic is the salvation Akira finds in Zom 100. There isn&#39;t an apocalyptic scenario that&#39;s somehow portrayed as a hopeful paradise to underscore just how abysmal a work environment can be. Instead, My New Boss is Goofy resonates with viewers because of how it uses utterly adorable interactions to help Momose heal from his past work experiences. Momose interacts with the anime&#39;s eponymous goofy boss of the new company he works for, Shirosaki, who becomes a positive force in Momose&#39;s life.

Even without the added context of Momose&#39;s former job, each scene with him and Shirosaki would melt even the coldest of hearts. Most of this is driven by Shirosaki&#39;s quirky personality. Truth be told, he isn&#39;t as goofy as the anime advertises him. He&#39;s quite serious, and some might say even emotionless, but he&#39;s also unequivocally kind and understanding. What makes Shirosaki goofy is that he easily misconstrues situations or completely misinterprets what people are trying to say to the point where he gets himself in rather absurd, usually silly predicaments. All this is complemented by how Momose fawns over Shirosaki&#39;s idiosyncrasies.




                  Zom 100 Finally Returns With New Episodes For A Christmas Special   The last three episodes of Zom 100 were put on a hiatus due to production issues but finally get a release date for Christmas.   

However, the fact that Shirosaki&#39;s kindness and absurdities help Momose cope with his past is what heightens the overall experience for viewers. Usually, each interaction begins with Momose either suffering from very heartbreaking instances of PTSD or fearing how Shirosaki might act based on his behavior or failures in the office. But instead of getting humiliated or completely torn down, Shirosaki always does the nicest things imaginable for Momose. Shirosaki is, without a doubt, the greatest boss that anyone could ask for, especially one with such an unfortunate track record. The gratitude, relief and surprise on Momose&#39;s face never gets old. Better yet, whenever Shirosaki&#39;s attempts at cheering Momose up showcase his &#34;goofiness,&#34; the effect is just that much greater.




          

Unlike Zom 100, this series doesn&#39;t use the stereotypical zombie apocalypse as a metaphor for the important things to pursue in life, and to denounce the way-too-common toxicity of Japanese working culture. Instead, My New Boss is Goofy focuses on the healing process of a person who was scarred by his previous work life, setting it in a workplace slice-of-life setting, seen through a lens of touching realism that just so happens to be utterly adorable.

My New Boss is Goofy is available on Crunchyroll.
