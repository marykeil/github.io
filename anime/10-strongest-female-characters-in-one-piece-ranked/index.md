## Literature Review

While a lot of the attention One Piece garners goes to its male characters, there are a few female who are as capable as their male colleagues.




There is no shortage of strong female characters in One Piece. In fact, whether they were born powerful, acquired it through training, or obtained an ability by eating one of the notorious Devil Fruit, there are so many capable women in One Piece that for many fans, it&#39;s hard to keep track of them all.
Regardless of how they earned their power, when this group of women come to battle, their opponents will most likely be overwhelmed by their abilities. Moreover, unlike in other shonen manga, where powerful women are often made to be footnotes in the story, this group of women are generally at the center of attention.









 








 10  Ulti 
Displays admirable strength in Kaido&#39;s Tobi Roppo group.
        

In a universe of over-the-top personalities, Ulti is one of the most forceful. Never willing to back down from an idea, she&#39;s not afraid to get into arguments and ruffle some feathers. She is one of the strongest members of Kaido&#39;s Tobi Roppo group. Her fiery personality is also part of her fighting style – a pressing, constant pushing forward force that keeps opponents on the defensive. This style fits perfectly with the powers she obtained from the Ryr Ryo No Mi (Dragon Dragon) Devil Fruit, which gives her the abilities of a Pachycephalosaurus – a thick-skulled dinosaur that uses its head to batter opponents into submission. When used in combination with her Armament Haki, Ulti&#39;s battering ram approach is hard to stop; she was literally able to stun Luffy with it, despite him being made of rubber.





 9  Jewelry Bonney 
A suave pirate possessing superhuman strength and a mysterious Devil Fruit.
        

Outside of her connections to Bartholomew Kuma, Dr. Vegapunk and the Straw Hat Pirates, Jewelry Bonney is a powerful pirate who shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. First, she possesses inhuman levels of strength. Despite her dainty size, Jewelry Bonney is able to generate kicks of such power and speed that they can easily topple individuals several times her size. She&#39;s even managed to topple Blackbeard without much effort. In addition, there&#39;s also Jewelry Bonney&#39;s yet-to-be-named Devil Fruit, which give her the ability to control both her and others&#39; aging. She could literally touch a person and instantaneously render them a baby without any understanding of the world or an elderly citizen too old to think clearly.





 8  Kalifa 
A powerful martial artist with the ability to &#34;clean&#34; others&#39; powers.
        

To be chosen to serve in one of the World Government’s Cipher Pol (CP) services is an amazing achievement. To be chosen to serve two of the department’s top agencies – CP9 and CP0 is rare beyond comparison. And yet Kalifa has served as an agent for both. Starting out as a member of CP9’s assassination team, Kalifa was part of the World Government&#39;s &#34;impossible kill missions&#34;. She did such a good job there that she was subsequently transferred to the CP0. Under the direct authority of the World Nobles, CP0 is almost always present or responsible for the world’s most important events. As an agent, Kalifa can tap into her Awa Awa No Mi (Bubble Bubble) Devil Fruit abilities, which allow her to &#34;clean&#34; the powers of others. She is also a practitioner of the rare but deadly martial art known as Rokushiki, which is only taught to CP9 agents.





 7  Nico Robin 
One of the World Government&#39;s most wanted possessing an extremely versatile Devil Fruit.
        

Despite not being a pirate captain, the World Government has identified Nico Robin as one of their most wanted. While this is largely due to her ability to read Poneglyphs that reveal the way to One Piece, it must also take into consideration her physical abilities. Robin possesses the powers of the Hana Hana No Mi (Flower Flower) Devil Fruit, and at first glance, the fruit&#39;s powers – namely the ability to sprout a body part from any surface of her skin – don&#39;t seem very practical, but upon deeper consideration, it is a truly overpowering ability. This is especially true for someone who&#39;s had the time to figure out all its intricacies, like Nico.





 6  Black Maria 
An unassuming member of the Tobi Roppo with powerful spider-like abilities.
        

Though a senior member of the Beast Pirates and part of Kaido&#39;s Tobi Roppo team, Black Maria doesn&#39;t come across as exceptionally strong. Her flirtatious personality and friendliness give her a softer, more affable vibe. However, no one should mistake her kind words for weakness. When she wants, she can be an unstoppable force of destruction. Standing nearly 30 feet tall, Black Maria packs a power punch. In addition to her physical strength, Black Maria also possesses the powers of the Kumo Kumo No Mi, Model: Rosamygale Grauvogeli (Spider Spider) Devil Fruit, which allows her to transform into a giant spider or a human-spider hybrid. Both forms allow her to walk on walls and spin webs, which she uses to immobilize opponents and leave them vulnerable to attack.





 5  Catarina Devon 
A senior member of Blackbeard&#39;s crew with the power to shapeshift.
        

An individual needs to be strong both mentally and physically to be a senior member of Marshall D. Teach’s Blackbeard Pirate crew. As one of the story&#39;s most devious, back-stabbing characters, there’s no way he&#39;d accept the hardest of hard who honors serving under his command. Catarina Devon checks the boxes for the job. Known as the &#34;Crescent Moon Hunter&#34;, Devon is one of the most dangerous criminals in the world. The World Government was fortunate to have arrested her only for her to be freed by Treach, who first required her to fight everyone in her cell to death. Additionally, there&#39;s her Inu Inu no Mi, Model: Kyubi no Kitsune (Fox Fox) Devil Fruit which allows her to transform into anyone she wants.





 4  Boa Hancock 
A powerful and enchanting pirate captain with the power to steal hearts.
        

Pirate captain, empress, and Warlord of the Sea – Boa Hancock might have started out as a slave to the Celestial Dragons, but she never let that stop her from becoming one of the most powerful women in the One Piece universe. Like her many titles, her strengths are multifarious. First, she is a first-class hand-to-hand fighter. Indeed, with kicks and punches that can pulverize stones, she&#39;ll punish anyone who takes that she’s a female for granted. Second, she is one of the few characters in One Piece who possesses all forms of Haki. This gives her an increased diversity of abilities, from rallying people to follow her command to sensing danger before it manifests. Finally, there is her Mero Mero No Mi (Love Love) Devil Fruit abilities, which allow her to turn anyone into stone who&#39;s attracted to her mesmerizing beauty, or whom she can touch with her hand or love shots.





 3  Carrot 
One of One Piece&#39;s best hand-to-hand fighters.
        

Power and strength in One Piece are largely shown through a character&#39;s fighting ability – that is, the capacity to win in hand-to-hand combat. When it comes to pure melee abilities, no one comes close to Carrot. As a Mink, Carrot already carries a number of inherent abilities that make her a natural pugilist. She was born with a warrior mentality and an ease of understanding martial theory and has an innate sense of self-defense. Put simply, Carrot knew how to fight and defend herself straight out of the cradle. Those abilities only improved with practice, experience, and maturity. In addition, she is able to activate the unique Mink ability known as Electro – which allows a user to pulse an electric shock on demand. There&#39;s also Sulong – a Dragon Ball-like power-up that occurs whenever she looks at a full moon. These abilities make her one of One Piece&#39;s most powerful, regardless of gender.





 2  Charlotte Linlin (Big Mom) 
An incredible leader with a terrifying Devil Fruit.
        

A simple glance at Big Mom’s resume is all that is necessary to understand why she is not only one of the most powerful female characters in One Piece, but one of the strongest characters of either gender. Before she was thirty years old, she was a senior member of Rocks D. Xebec&#39;s legendary Rock Pirates – the crew that was only defeated by the combined attacks of Gol D. Roger&#39;s Pirated and the Marines, before moving on to form her own notorious Pirate Crew. She is the leader of her own nation – Tottoland, and perhaps most impressive of all – she is a Yonko. Not only does Big Mom possess multiple forms of Haki, but she also has the power of the Soru Soru No Mi (Soul Soul) Devil Fruit which gives her the power to suck the souls out of people.





 1  Saint Shalria 
A Celestial Dragon who is nearly unmatched in every regard.
        

As a Celestial Dragon and World Noble, Saint Shalria belongs to the One Piece universe&#39;s &#34;one percent&#34;. That is, she is among the group of individuals who ostensibly rule the world. She doesn&#39;t worry about money, gaining power, or making a name for herself, she has an abundance of all of it. What she is worried about is the other 99 percent of the people on Earth, causing her inconvenience and disrupting World Order. While she possesses no particular powers or abilities like other members of this list, in reality, she does not need any. If she needs something done, she has the full force of a Marine Admiral at her beck-and-call.
