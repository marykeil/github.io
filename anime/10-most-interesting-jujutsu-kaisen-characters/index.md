## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen has a loaded ensemble cast of interesting and well-written characters, with a handful of them leaving a significant mark on the series.





Jujutsu Kaisen is well-known for having incredibly intricate and well-written side characters, competing with the likes of Bleach and One Piece. The villains are equally complex, and the female charcters – something that often gets criticized in shonen – are given just as much development as the males. Of course, there is a select handful of characters within Jujutsu Kaisen that are the most interesting.
            
 
 Each Major Jujutsu Kaisen Character&#39;s Zodiac Sign Fits Them Perfectly 
All of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s major characters fit their zodiac signs incredibly well such as the Pisces Yuuji Itadori and Sagittarius Satoru Gojo.












 








 10  Todo Aoi 
        

Todo Aoi has a unique personality in Jujutsu Kaisen. He loves fighting powerful people more than anything, and his way of determining if someone will be friends is unusual: he asks them about their preferences in women. His overbearing attitude when it comes to meeting his favorite idol annoys his teammates but despite all that, they have absolute confidence in his strength. Even Gojo Satoru, the strongest jujutsu sorcerer in the series, sees Todo being a future leader. Todo taught Itadori how to utilize his strength, and quickly took him under his wing. His brilliance when it comes to battle tactics despite his eccentric personality is very rare to see.





 9  Kento Nanami 
        

After graduating Jujutsu High, Nanami left to become a salaryman, but returned to being a sorcerer after having a personal revelation helping an employee at a bakery he frequented. He has a straight-laced, serious personality and barely cracks a smile. That isn&#39;t to say that he is a loner, as the bubbly Yuji and Gojo love having him around, and often rope him in to their antics. Nanami is a fan favorite because of his subtle kind-heartedness and stoic nature. He is also very dependable, as Gojo turned to him to train Itadori when he felt as though he couldn&#39;t trust anyone else. A first grade sorcerer, Nanami is a joy to watch in action because of his cold and calculating fighting style, and unique cursed technique.





 8  Megumi Fushiguro 
        

Megumi is what people think Nanami is: an introverted loner. While he would sacrifice his life in a heartbeat for his teammates, Megumi rarely opens up to them about himself, and keeps much of his upbringing a secret. Though he is more relaxed, he has a competitive side, proven by his desire to battle Todo during season 1. He is a member of the prestigious Zenin Clan, but he refuses to associate with them. As much as he dislikes his clan, he is blessed with one of their techniques: Ten Shadows. Presently, he is the only student with his own Domain Expansion, which speaks to his talents.





 7  Yuji Itadori 
        

The protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen with a heart of gold, Yuji&#39;s extreme physical prowess is a mystery. His powers revolve around his melee combat abilities, and although it&#39;s a cliché in shonen anime, Itadori&#39;s passion and sheer strength makes him one of the most entertaining fighters in the series. From the Divergent Fist to the Black Flash, Itadori&#39;s combat abilities even without a cursed technique is exceptional. He is a ray of sunshine that draw people to him, but that side evaporates when his friends or any civilian is in danger. His dedication to public service makes him a great main character.





 6  Kokichi Muta 
        

More commonly known as Mechamaru, Kokichi was on the spotlight very recently at the beginning of the Shibuya Incident Arc. A user of the Heavenly Pact technique, Kokichi is an unusual character as he was treated as being just another side character in season 1. He was then assumed to be an accomplice to the villains, but that was dispelled when he nearly killed Mahito. He isn&#39;t an average Jujutsu sorcerer, either, as he is willing to cross the line to get what he wants, but he usually has a back-up plan to restore things to normal.





 5  Maki Zenin 
        

Maki Zenin has a no-nonsense demeanor, but is never afraid to crack a joke here or there. Despite everything that she&#39;s been through, she&#39;s still able to connect with the other members of the cast, and finds reasons to smile throughout the series. As if her clan forsaking her for her lack of cursed energy wasn&#39;t enough, they still meddle in her career as a sorcerer and this led to her being ranked low despite being very powerful. Against all odds, she has established herself as a sorcerer to watch out for and fans can only marvel at her bravery and dedication to her goals, even though they are petty.

There are many interesting powers and techniques in Jujutsu Kaisen but the Heavenly Pact is perhaps the most interesting and unpredictable.








 4  Toji Fushiguro 
        

Toji was the main villain of the Hidden Inventory arc, and was the first person to defeat Gojo Satoru. What makes Toji an interesting character is his lack of cursed energy, which is almost unheard of. Similarly to Kokichi and Maki, he has the Heavenly Pact and in exchange for a lack of cursed energy ,his physical strength is off the charts. Together with his cunning and deceptive personality, he became one of the strongest in Jujutsu Kaisen even after being chased out of the Zenin Clan. It is a shame that he met his end because he would&#39;ve been an even better character if he got more screen time.





 3  Geto Suguru 
        

Geto has been the main villain of the series so far, and has orchestrated many tragedies, including the Shibuya plot. He is one of few sorcerers to be ever classified as a special-grade, but his true talents shine when it comes to tactics. From the Night Parade of 100 Demons in Shinjuku and Kyoto to the Shibuya Incident, Geto is a brilliant sorcerer and villain. He possesses an extraordinary gift of brains and brawn. His tragic backstory was revealed in the Hidden Inventory Arc, and shed light on his twisted goals.





 2  Gojo Satoru 
        

Known as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer alive, Gojo Satoru is probably the most loved character in the series. He is integral to the story as he has fostered and taught many of the strongest characters in the series. His personality is very deceptive as one would think he is a happy and bubbly man, but that couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Possessing a blood thirst unlike anything else, he stops at nothing to eliminate an enemy. He, together with Geto, had short arc dedicated to unveiling the complex man.





 1  Yuta Okkotsu 
        

The only person who has a chance of surpassing Gojo&#39;s strength, Yuta has been hyped up since the beginning of the series. Even now in season 2, there are mentions of his name and fans are very excited for him to make his debut in the anime. Jujutsu Kaisen 0, a prequel film dedicated to introducing the character dedicated to him and how he became so powerful. In a span of a year, he mastered techniques that would take the average sorcerer far longer to grasp, and it was later revealed that he&#39;s related to Gojo, which explains his absurd talent.
Jujutsu Kaisen has a loaded ensemble cast of interesting characters. They all have unique personalities, powers, and backstories. As the series continues to progress, new characters will be added to Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s gallery of iconic faces, so fans have something to look forward to.
Jujutsu Kaisen is available to stream on Crunchyroll.
