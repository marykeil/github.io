## Literature Review

Chapter 89 finally adds some much-needed depth to Yuri Briar, opening the way to a more interesting character who exists outside of one joke.




Warning: The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family chapter 89!




The story of Spy X Family has grown to include a sizable cast, some regarded less fondly than others. Yuri Briar, in particular, isn&#39;t always one to receive a warm welcome in or out of the story thanks to his obsession with his older sister, Yor. Chapter 89, however, might be a sign that Tatsuya Endo is adding more depth to Loid Forger&#39;s &#34;rival&#34;.

Some misgivings about Yuri&#39;s character is the fact his existence is tied up wholly in one very cliché joke. Until now, Yuri&#39;s main identity has been his sis-con characteristics – with his obsession for Yor being taken to extreme lengths. After using the same joke thus far, Yuri finally got his first wake-up call in chapter 89, thanks to a new character being thrown into the mix.

                  Spy x Family Already Gave The Fans (And Anya) What They Want   While Loid and Yor’s relationship began as a contractual arrangement, their marriage has already shown signs that they’ve actually fallen in love.   





 Yuri Finally Gains Depth Thanks To A New Character

Mission 89 follows up on the story arc that made up chapters 80 to 86, which included the first serious showdown between Loid and Yuri. The arc ended in Loid&#39;s favor, leaving Yuri now nursing a grudge for failing to capture the disguised super spy Twilight. This frustration leads him to recklessly raid a building full of anti-establishment criminals, necessitating a last minute save by a new Ostania SSS agent, Chloe. This chapter finally sees Endo use Chloe as a mouthpiece to interrogate Yuri&#39;s obsession with his sister, making it clear it has actual in-story consequences.

This may be the first time the story has actually gone to treat Yuri&#39;s obsession as more than a joke and given him pause to reconsider it. Before Chloe, all the characters were content to let this cliché run on, perhaps to the audience&#39;s discontent. Even Yuri&#39;s superiors remained passive to act as his straight men. Now, though, as Yuri recognizes his sister would also desire his well-being; it might be a sign that Endo might dial back on his current persona and have him do more than gush at Yor, or get pummeled by her when she panics.




          

Chloe may be a useful partner to Yuri going forward – she&#39;s a proactive character willing to verbally spar with the latter, which will provide more scenes with Yuri that exist outside the Forgers, or, again, his SSS superiors who mostly stand by and observe his oddities rather than engage with them. She has already expanded greatly on his backstory by revealing details about his university days. Between this chapter, and the prior arc, which gave Fiona Frost some impressive moments, Spy X Family may finally be figuring out how to get its secondary characters to exist outside their initial pigeonholes.

Spy X Family is now available from Viz Media.
