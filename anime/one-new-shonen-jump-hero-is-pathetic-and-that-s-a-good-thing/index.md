# One New Shonen Jump Hero Is Pathetic - And That s a Good thing


## SUMMARY 



  Yaesaki is a refreshing protagonist in the Shonen genre, with low moral standards but still enjoyable to root for.   Yaesaki&#39;s underhanded tactics in golf make him relatable and relieves the pressure of being a naturally gifted or highly dedicated protagonist.   Yaesaki&#39;s refreshing portrayal and potential in Green Green Greens deserves a chance to shine in the Shonen Jump lineup.

## Literature Review

The new Shonen Jump series Green Green Greens features a protagonist who breaks the standard mold of Shonen heroes by being relatably pathetic.




Most Shonen protagonists are righteous bastions of morality, but one of Shonen Jump&#39;s more recent heroes bucks that trend in a refreshing way. That character is Yaesaki from the golf manga Green Green Greens by Kento Terasaka, and despite his low moral standards he is still an enjoyable hero to root for. The reason for this comes partially in the nature of his manga.




In chapter 4, translated by Christine Dashiell with lettering by Brendon Hull, Yaesaki gets into a competition with a more experienced and powerful golfer named Chikara, with his ability to stay at the club where he works on the line. After seeing that he is at a major disadvantage once Chikara unleashes a devastating swing, Yaesaki offers him a glove given to him by Chikara&#39;s crush.

          

This underhanded tactic is meant to prevent Chikara from swinging too hard and thus wearing out his love&#39;s glove. Yaesaki is called out for this behavior and he acknowledges that it is underhanded, but he doesn&#39;t care as long as he can continue to play the sport he loves.


 Green Green Greens&#39;s Yaesaki is More Pathetic Than Other Shonen Jump Heroes 
          




This is a stark contrast to many other Shonen protagonists who hold much loftier ideals. This is especially true of many protagonists in other sports manga, as fair play is seen as essential with the hero&#39;s skills coming through hard work and practice. Yaesaki is still a novice at golf so he can&#39;t rely on winning through fair competition. Thus he must mirror the tactics on many sports manga villains and cheat his way to victory. This puts him more in line with characters like Yoichi from Blue Lock than Hinata from Haikyu!!. However, unlike Isagi his devious tactics aren&#39;t portrayed as being cool, instead they are shown to be pathetic.

This might have made Yaesaki an unlikable character if presented differently, but here it just makes him seem relatable. While reading about Shonen protagonists who are naturally gifted or so devoted to their goals that they become incredibly powerful can be fun, it doesn&#39;t reflect reality for many readers. That is fine most of the time, as these characters can be aspirational and inspire readers to better themselves. But it is refreshing to see a character who both acknowledges that they are not especially talented and is also willing to perform a realistically underhanded action to compensate for that.






 Yaesaki is Refreshing Compared to Other Shonen Jump Heroes 
          

In a genre whose protagonists are often stale rehashings of standard tropes, Yaesaki is refreshingly pathetic. If the other characters in Green Green Greens prove to be similarly innovative, then this series may turn out to be a new approach to Shonen sports manga. Hopefully, Shonen Jump allows it to last long enough to realize its full potential instead of consigning it to the Under 19 Club before it gets a chance to shine.
