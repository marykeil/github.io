## Literature Review

My Hero Academia subtly hints that Tokoyami may be far stronger than believed as the series&#39; strongest villain ranks his as high as the top hero.





Summary

  Chapter #406 of My Hero Academia acknowledges Tokoyami&#39;s strength, suggesting he may be on par with top heroes like Endeavor and All Might.   Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow played a crucial role in pinning down All For One, possibly leaving a lasting mark on him.   Despite being taken out of the battle, Tokoyami&#39;s journey to unlock Dark Shadow&#39;s true potential may lead him to become one of the new top heroes.  







My Hero Academia&#39;s final war has given every hero student a chance to shine, but one surprising student among them may have already made it to the top ranks. Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow Quirk was always impressive, but now even the supreme villain All For One recognizes him among the top opponents he faced.

Although Class 1-A&#39;s Fumikage Tokoyami has spent much of the series quite literally in the shadows, the latest chapter of My Hero Academia finally acknowledges the mark he left on All For One through their brief bout earlier in the arc. In fact, the chapter suggests Tokoyami may have even made it to the level of top heroes such as Endeavor and All Might.

          

In Chapter #406 of My Hero Academia, while fighting Bakugo, All For One notes that Dark Shadow and Endeavor packed a better punch than Bakugo. While this thought dismisses Bakugo as a threat in All For One&#39;s eyes, it inadvertently acknowledges that Tsukuyomi and Endeavor both pose real threats of a similar level. This would imply that Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow may be on par with My Hero Academia&#39;s other top pro heroes, which is somewhat surprising.





 All For One Acknowledges Tokoyami As a Significant Threat 
Dark Shadow is so powerful that impressed even My Hero Academia&#39;s strongest villain.
          

Though the battle against Tokoyami, Endeavor, and Hawks was short-lived, as the group barely managed to pin All For One down for long, Tokoyami&#39;s Quirk played a major role in the process. As the only Quirk that could hold All For One down in Endeavor&#39;s absence without running the risk of him simply stealing it, Dark Shadow seems to have very much left its mark on All For One.

                  My Hero Academia&#39;s Best Character Arc Is Not Deku&#39;s   An essential moment of failure helped to redefine Todoroki&#39;s character arc, leading into a new era for the Half-Hot/Half-Cold hero student.   

Although one might argue that Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow only reached the heights it did because of the optimal conditions created by Shiketsu&#39;s students, Light of Baldur still remains an impressive technique of terrifying magnitude. Regardless of its limits, Dark Shadow is a Quirk with endless potential, and Tokoyami&#39;s journey towards understanding it and unlocking its true potential has finally reached its climactic point in this chapter of My Hero Academia.




          

That said, it seems Tokoyami&#39;s journey may end here as he has been effectively taken out of the battle, making it unlikely that either he or Dark Shadow will get another chance to shine. However, perhaps when the dust of the final war settles and My Hero Academia&#39;s new top heroes emerge at the end, Tokoyami will be among them as well.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
