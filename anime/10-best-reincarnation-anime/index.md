## Literature Review

There are plenty of reincarnation stories in the anime medium, including both the ever-popular isekai and others, but these are the cream of the crop.




Finding the best reincarnation anime is no easy task, given the theme&#39;s recent surge in popularity in the medium. The more reincarnation stories that anime fans are presented with, the more difficult it becomes to identify the actually good ones. Yet for those intrigued by such a premise, there are certainly quite a few worthwhile options.
Reincarnation stories are common enough in anime for them to be split into two categories: isekai titles wherein the protagonist is reborn in a completely different, usually magical world and those where one is reincarnated in the same world, either after a long period of time or simply in a different body. While the former are generally more popular, there are quite a few non-isekai reincarnation stories that stand out as well.

The growth of any theme as popular as isekai is bound to result in the release of parodies that subvert common tropes and ideas for comedic purposes. In KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World!, Kazuma Satou is chosen to be reborn in a fantasy world and tasked with defeating the Demon King, without receiving any special skills to aid with his mission. Instead, he selects the Goddess of Water, Aqua, as his companion, only to later learn that she has no interest in supporting him, spending all of her skill points on pointless party tricks. Focusing on pure entertainment above all, KonoSuba: God&#39;s Blessing on This Wonderful World! is a massive hit for a reason.
