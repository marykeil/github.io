## Literature Review

The best anime sequel movies play important roles in the stories of their franchises and are enjoyable watches in their own right.




If an anime series is popular enough, it&#39;s not uncommon for an anime sequel movie to be made. While many well-known anime franchises have multiple full-length movies, in general, these movies are standalone side stories that aren&#39;t treated as entirely canon to the main series. However, there are notable exceptions to this rule. Fully canon sequel movies have filled in some major gaps in certain anime series. The best anime sequel movies not only play important roles in the stories of their respective franchises but are enjoyable watches in their own right.
It&#39;s common for anime based on manga to outpace the story of the original manga they&#39;re based on and end long before the manga does. This issue has led to anime sequel movies being written to give open-ended anime series endings that are either more definitive or more in line with the manga that inspired them. Similarly, anime sequel movies have often been used to bridge the gaps between entries in long-running franchises and introduce key aspects and characters of the newer series.

 10  Martian Successor Nadesico: Prince of Darkness (1998) 
Sequel to the 1996 Series Based on the Manga By Kia Asamiya
        

At its most basic, Martin Successor Nadesico is a comedic version of Evangelion. While there are genuine moments of emotion and tragedy, for the most part, it&#39;s pretty silly and consistently lighthearted. The sequel movie Prince of Darkness is notably darker and less comedic than the original series and despite actually winning several awards in Japan, fans have not been kind to Prince of Darkness. 
In addition to the jarring change in tone from the series, there was a great deal of important context only provided by a Sega Saturn video game that was never released outside of Japan and only came out after the movie in Japan. Although the negative reception from fans helped to torpedo the Martian Successor Nadesico franchise, in a vacuum, Prince of Darkness is actually an entirely decent space opera anime story with a good soundtrack and a really nice 90s artstyle.

 9  Pokémon: The First Movie (1998) 
Originally Intended as The Finale to Anime Based on The Hit Bideo Game Series by Satoshi Tajiri


 







With the benefit of almost 30 years of hindsight, it&#39;s frankly hilarious that Pokémon: The First Movie was originally written as the grand finale of the entire Pokémon franchise. Not only is the franchise still going strong — with 25 Pokémon movies and more than 1000 anime episodes as of 2023 — Pokémon is the most profitable media franchise of all time.
Although the English release tones down some of the thematic elements of the original script, The First Movie is still markedly darker than the anime series and, for the most part, it works. The First Movie has some genuinely emotional moments and a powerful central theme that still largely sticks the landing even with the edits made to the English release.
Pokémon: The First Movie is available for rental or digital download on Amazon Prime.





 8  K-On! Movie (2011) 
Sequel to The 2009 Series Based on the Anime By Kakifly
        

Seeing the members of After School Team Time travel to London for their graduation trip, K-On! Movie is, much like the main series, laid-back and relaxing. Nothing really happens, but there are plenty of hilarious moments. K-On! Movie really leans into the series&#39; slice-of-life humor, brilliant character animations and reactions, and the main cast&#39;s personalities playing off each other. Obviously, as the cinematic adaptation of an anime series about music, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and the girls&#39; exploration of London leads to some hilarious moments and interactions. Naturally, as musicians, the girls get their chance to make the obligatory shout-out to the Beatles and cross Abbey Road.
K-On! Movie is available for rental and digital download on Youtube Premium and the Google Play Store.





 7  Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection (2019) 
Sequel to The 2006 Series Written By Ichirō Ōkouchi
        

As the sequel to an anime series where the main character died, Lelouch of the Re;surrection has the obvious issue of needing to explain how and why Lelouch is back. On the one hand, this potentially undermines the dark but compelling ending of the original anime. On the other hand, the Code Geass movies are set in an alternate movie with their own canon, so the original ending still technically remains unchanged. The writers put enough thought into bringing Lelouch back that the characters, up to and including Lelouch himself, have to work for it. On the whole, Lelouch of the Re;surrection has a happy ending that is a pretty significant departure from the main anime series.

 6  Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#39;s Counterattack (1988) 
Sequel to The Original 1979 Gundam Series, Written &amp; Directed By Series Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino
        

While not technically the first Gundam movie, Char&#39;s Counterattack is the first movie in the franchise not to be a compilation of footage from the original anime series. Char&#39;s Counterattack is a sequel movie to the original Mobile Suit Gundam and its sequel series Zeta Gundam and ZZ and serves as the culmination of the ongoing storyline of those series. As indicated by the title, Char&#39;s Counterattack focuses on Char Aznable, the antagonist of the original Gundam and one of the most popular characters in the entire franchise. Both Char and his longtime rival Amuro, the protagonist of the original Gundam, get plenty of moments to shine as their conflict climaxes and their shared storyline gets an awesome but bittersweet ending worthy of one of the most iconic rivalries in anime history.

 5  Fullmetal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shamballa (2005) 
Sequel to the First Anime Adaptation of the Manga By Hiromu Arakawa
        

Fullmetal Alchemist got two anime adaptations. The first, simply titled Fullmetal Alchemist aired from 2003-2004. Since this first anime adaptation was being produced while the original manga was still being written, the plot overtook the manga and the anime therefore diverges from the source material in fairly significant ways.
Conqueror of Shamballa was intended to resolve the lingering plot threads that still existed at the end of the anime, which involved Edward being separated from the rest of the cast by getting transported to 1920s Germany. Conqueror of Shamballa has the two parallel worlds converging as forerunners of the Nazis try to conquer the world of Fullmetal Alchemist and harness the powers of alchemy for their nefarious ends. Ultimately, the continuity of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime and Conquerorof Shamballa was replaced by Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the 2009 adaptation which more closely follows the original manga.

 4  Demon Slayer: Mugen Train (2020) 
Sequel to The First Season of the Anime Adaptation of the Manga By Koyoharu Gotouge


 







Thanks in part to the disruptions to movie-going caused by the COVID pandemic and being played in more theaters than it would have been otherwise, Mugen Train was the second highest-grossing movie of 2020. Despite these admittedly unique historical circumstances, Mugen Train shouldn&#39;t be downplayed as it is a quality anime movie that deserved to succeed on its own merits. Mugen Train is a little faster-paced and action-oriented than the typical Demon Slayer arc and concludes in about two hours. Like the rest of the Demon Slayer anime, Mugen Train is visually gorgeous and despite being faster and more focused on action scenes than other arcs, Mugen Train nevertheless has legitimate emotional weight and culminates with a genuinely bittersweet climax.

 3  Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Rebellion (2013) 
Sequel to The 2011 Series Written By Gen Urobuchi
        

Puella Magi Madoka Magica is probably the darkest Magical Girl franchise, subverting just about every aspect of the genre in the most brutal and horrifying fashion possible. The original anime series ended on a very bittersweet note but was basically a victory for the protagonists despite a big sacrifice. Given the tone of the franchise overall, it&#39;s not entirely surprising that the last-minute twist of Rebellion skews heavily toward darkness. Although the ending of Rebellion undoes the underlying optimism that helped mitigate the darkness of the original anime&#39;s ending, it does admittedly create a fascinating new status quo that gives the forthcoming Madoka sequel a promising narrative to build on.
Puella Magi Madoka Magica: Rebellion is available for rental and digital download on Youtube Premium and Apple TV.





 2  The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014) 
Bridging the Gap Between The Anime Adaptations of Naruto and Boruto Based on The Manga by Masashi Kishimoto
        

Between 2004 and 2015, there have been 11 Naruto movies. However, only two Naruto of them are considered fully canon: The Last and Boruto. This is largely because those two movies serve to introduce the next generation of characters who become the lead in Boruto and bridge the narrative gap between the end of Naruto and the beginning of Boruto. While the plot of The Last is a solid story in its own right with plenty of memorable action scenes, its greatest strength is serving as the finale of Naruto. The movie begins with a stylized recap of the series up to that point, and by the end, the series&#39; familiar and beloved characters get their long-awaited happy endings.

 1  Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (2013) 
Sequel to Dragon Ball Z, Created By Akira Toriyama


 







Along with its own direct sequel movie Resurrection &#39;F&#39;, Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods primarily serves to introduce Dragon Ball Super. The original Dragon Ball Z ended with an epilogue scene set 10 years after the last episode of the Majin Buu Saga. Ultimately, Dragon Ball Super would fill in that ten-year gap, with Battle of Gods easing the audience into several key aspects of Super&#39;s narrative.
Beerus, the God of Destruction introduced in the movie, would go on to become a recurring character in Super and help to introduce Super&#39;s broader cosmological scope. Similarly, Goku&#39;s new Super Saiyan God form would establish that Super would introduce even more powerful forms and abilities for the characters. Although Battle of Gods does serve an important narrative role in connecting Dragon Ball Z to Super, it is largely carried primarily by the epic fight between Beerus and Goku, perhaps the two absolute strongest characters in the entire franchise. Fans were hyped for Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, and fortunately, the result is the greatest anime sequel movie of all time.
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods is available for rental and digital download on Apple TV.
