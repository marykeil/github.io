## Literature Review

The Fall 2023 season of anime is about to start, and here are all the new anime people can expect to watch on Crunchyroll throughout the season.





There’s a lot to be excited about with Crunchyroll’s new slate of anime. While there is plenty of new anime landing on Crunhchyroll this season, some fan-favorite series will continue airing from the previous one, including One Piece, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Detective Conan. Also, the majority of these anime will all receive dubs in English, Latin American Spanish, French, Hindi, and other languages; the schedules for the release of said dubs have not been given at the time of writing, but they can be expected to be given out soon.

While there are plenty of anime with unique premises such as the superhero anime Shy or the mystery anime Migi &amp; Dali, Crunchyroll’s lineup seems to consist largely of isekai and fantasy anime. For isekai anime, I’m in Love with the Villainess has garnered a lot of attention for being another LGBTQ&#43; positive anime, and it’s sure to be a standout of the season. Other notable isekai anime of the season include I Shall Survive Using Potions! and Butareba: The Story of a Man Turned into a Pig, the latter of which won second place in the 26th Dengeki Novel Prize, one of the biggest literary awards in all of Japan.

For fantasy anime, The Kingdoms of Ruin, Berserk of Gluttony, and A Returner’s Magic Should Be Special all offer different and unique takes on the genre with appropriately engaging animation styles, so each of them is sure to be worth watching. The fantasy anime that most deserves attention, however, will undoubtedly be Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End; the manga has already been a massive hit, and with gorgeous art and animation and an all-star staff that includes Violet Evergarden composer Evan Call and Bocchi the Rock! director Keiichiro Saito, the anime is bound to be one of the most spectacle anime of the season, if not the year.






 Fall 2023 Sees The Return Of Many Popular Anime To Crunchyroll 
          

Equally notable about Crunchyroll’s Fall 2023 lineup is how many popular anime are returning for new seasons. The Ancient Magus’ Bride, Dr. Stone: New World, and Dead Mount Death Play are all set to return for the second halves of their latest seasons, and they&#39;re sure to be just as entertaining as their first halves were. The Rising of the Shield Hero, The Faraway Paladin, and Girlfriend, Girlfriend are also set to return with new seasons, and with any luck, each of them will be able to retain the level of charm that attracted people to them from the very start.

One of the sequels to watch out for the most, however, has to be Goblin Slayer II. As controversial as Goblin Slayer might have been, the anime was still a big hit when it first came out, and while Goblin Slayer II might not have the same staff involved, or even the same animation studio, seeing it return warrants plenty of hype that will hopefully be justified. All in all, between returning favorites and a bevy of isekai, fantasy, and many other genres of anime, Crunchyroll will have plenty to offer for fall 2023, so people will hardly be without anything to watch.
