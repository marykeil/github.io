## Literature Review

Fall 2023 is filled with many incredible anime to stream, from sequels in beloved franchises to completely new shows in various genres.




Fall 2023 has arrived and with it comes a slew of great anime to stream. From sequels of popular series to completely new stories, this season provides fans with a range of old comforts and exciting new adventures. While tastes may vary, certain shows are airing this fall that every anime fan should watch.
Of course with this huge volume of shows spread across a variety of streaming services, it can be hard for the average anime fan to keep track of everything going on. This has become a problem as the anime industry has grown and has caused some fans to eschew watching currently airing shows entirely to instead focus on old classics. This would be a shame to do this season however as some of the shows coming out are incredibly hype and watching them as they come out can allow viewers to be part of the community&#39;s excitement over each new episode. These are the best shows in Fall 2023 to stream as they release.









 








 10  Castlevania: Nocturne 
        

While some fans may debate whether this show counts as anime, based on its art style and source material it undoubtedly should be considered one. Regardless of this debate, Castlevania: Nocturne stands as a great horror show perfect for October. While the show&#39;s initial 4 season run wrapped up the adventures of the Belmonts and the vampires they hunt quite nicely, more episodes are always welcome. Castlevania: Nocturne is available to stream now on Netflix.





 9  Goblin Slayer Season 2 
        

This anime isn&#39;t for everyone given it&#39;s sometimes extremely graphic subject matter. But for fans of fantasy on the more brutal side, Goblin Slayer Season 2 is a show that should be on their watch list. Following the adventures of the titular goblin slayer as he and his party slay goblins the show isn&#39;t necessarily the deepest anime out there. But for fans wanting to watch some brutal revenge-fueled violence Goblin Slayer satisfies that itch to a tee. Goblin Slayer Season 2 is streaming on Crunchyroll with new episodes releasing every Friday.





 8  Tokyo Revengers Season 3 
        

The time travel gang battle show is back as Tokyo Revengers returns for a third season. This season will see Takemichi and his gang having to confront a mysterious new gang that is taking over their territory. For fans of the first two seasons, this will hopefully be a worthy continuation of the show and for newcomers, this can act as the perfect excuse to start watching. Tokyo Revengers Season 3 releases new episodes every Tuesday on Hulu in the US and Disney Plus in the UK and Canada.





 7  Dr. Stone: New World Part 2 
        

The second half of Dr Stone&#39;s new season is also airing this fall, continuing Senkuu&#39;s journey to find the source of the stone purification light across the ocean. The science-based post-apocalyptic Shonen series has been consistently fun and educational with no signs of becoming less enjoyable in Season 3 Part 2. Anime fans looking for a unique story brimming with the joy of scientific creation and discovery should check this one out. Dr. Stone: New World Part 2 starts streaming on October 12 on Crunchyroll.





 6  The Apothecary Diaries 
        

Unlike many of the other anime on this list, The Apothecary Diaries is not a sequel series. It also isn&#39;t an action series instead it focuses on a dramatic series of events in historical China involving a girl working as a pharmacist in the imperial court. While this may not appeal to everyone, the trailer for the series looks beautiful and the soundtrack is composed by Kevin Penkin of Made in Abyss fame. So while this show isn&#39;t the most hype entry on this list it will still likely be a gorgeous hidden gem that anime fans should check out. The Apothecary Diaries starts streaming on October 22 on Crunchyroll.





 5  Undead Unluck 
        

Undead Unluck is currently one of Shonen Jump&#39;s most underrated manga with an incredibly unique power system that makes for some awesome and creative fights. If the upcoming anime adaptation by David Production can do the manga justice this will be a must-watch for Shonen fans looking for something new in the genre. Its first couple of episodes may mirror the rocky start of the manga, but if fans give it a chance Undead Unluck will grow into a truly special story. Undead Unluck is streaming on Hulu with new episodes released every Saturday.





 4  The Eminence in Shadow Season 2 
        

The hit isekai The Eminence in Shadow returns this fall for its second season. The show focuses on a high schooler Cid who is reincarnated in another world and becomes a major manipulator from the shadows. The twist is that he thinks he is just making everything up when it is actually real. This is a must-watch for isekai fans especially if it lives up to the high standard that its first season set. The Eminence in Shadow is available to stream on HIDIVE with new episodes released every Wednesday.





 3  Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End 
        

Frieren: Beyond Journeys End is a calmer show than most of the other anime on this list, but this placidity is its greatest strength. The show follows a nigh immortal elf named Frieren as she learns to connect with the humans around her. While the show does have an overarching plot it is largely episodic, which can deter some fans from watching it. However, this structure gives viewers the time to get to know Frieren&#39;s character deeply and thus enhances their adventures. Frieren: Beyond Journey&#39;s End is available to stream on Crunchyroll with new episodes released every Friday.





 2  Spy x Family Season 2 
        

The Forger family has returned ready to delight the many Spy x Family fans who have eagerly waited for season 2. Following a &#34;fake&#34; family comprised of a spy, an assassin, a telepath, and a clairvoyant dog, the show is largely a slice-of-life comedy with some espionage flavoring. This makes it incredibly wholesome, especially whenever the young daughter Anya is featured. While it may not be as consistently action-packed as other anime, Spy x Family is still well worth watching as a relaxing comfort anime. Spy x Family is streaming on Crunchyroll with new episodes released every Saturday.





 1  Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 
        

Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 could technically be considered a summer anime but since it will be releasing episodes throughout the fall as well it still belongs on this list. At first glance, Jujutsu Kaisen seems to be a standard battle Shonen following the battle between sorcerers and horrific curses. However, the Shibuya Incident arc completely shakes up the series&#39; status quo in all the best ways. This fall fans have the opportunity to watch what may go down as one of the best Shonen arcs in history live as it unfolds. That is why Jujutsu Kaisen is a must-watch for any anime fans. Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 is streaming on Crunchyroll with new episodes releasing every Thursday.
All of these shows make the Fall of 2023 a very exciting time for anime fans. This isn&#39;t even accounting for any shows that may be surprising breakout hits as they begin airing. But even without those unexpected successes, the slate of anime in Fall 2023 is stacked with incredible shows for fans of all genres to stream.
