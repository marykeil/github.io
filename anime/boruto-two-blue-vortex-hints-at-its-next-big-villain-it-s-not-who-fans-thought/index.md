# Boruto Two Blue Vortex Hints at its Next Big Villain, &amp; It s Not Who Fans Thought


## SUMMARY 



  Boruto&#39;s quick defeat of Code establishes him as incredibly powerful, with few able to match his strength, so he needs a truly threatening villain.   Daemon has shown unprecedented levels of power, with his immense strength, speed, and ability to redirect attacks making him a formidable opponent who surpasses Ishikki and Naruto.   Daemon&#39;s recognition and understanding of Boruto&#39;s Uzuhiko technique highlights his power and sets the stage for him to take over as the main antagonist now that Code is no longer a threat.

## Literature Review

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is setting up the series&#39; next big villain, and it&#39;s not one of those characters that fans expected to take the role.




The latest chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex teased who could be the series&#39; next big villain, and it&#39;s not a character that fans were expecting to step up to that role so soon. After witnessing just how powerful Boruto is now, neither Code nor Kawaki seem able to match his strength. However, Daemon has proved to possess unprecedented levels of strength, and he could be just the opponent that Boruto needs.




After the brutal and humiliating takedown of Code by Boruto, very few can match Boruto in strength, especially with his Rasengan Uzuhiko. The only person who comes to mind is the mischievous kid Daemon. With his incredible and mysterious powers, he is the only serious challenge to the protagonist at the moment. Daemon has been on the sidelines for far too long and Part 2 of Boruto could give him his time to shine.

          

As soon as Boruto used Rasengan Uzuhiko, Daemon recognized where the tremors were coming from and how the technique worked. This small part of the chapter reminds fans how powerful and formidable Daemon is. It also sets the stage for him to take over as the new villain now that Code is too weak.

                  Boruto Part 2 Is Finally Keeping The Series&#39; Original Promise   Boruto was originally intended to be a story about the “next generation”, but this is only becoming true now that Two Blue Vortex has begun.   





 Boruto&#39;s New Villain Could Be The Strongest Ever 
          

Daemon and Eida are cyborgs created by Amado to defeat Ishikki but were locked away by Boro when he was told to destroy them because they were too powerful and dangerous. They were then set free by Code to forge an alliance with them, which they did, but then betrayed him later and went to live in the Hidden Leaf village. The only reason the vengeful Code didn&#39;t try to get them back for stabbing him in the back was because of Daemon&#39;s ridiculous strength. The first confrontation between the two had ended in an embarrassing defeat for Code and even with his limiters removed, he still couldn&#39;t come near Daemon&#39;s strength.

Daemon is not only incredibly strong and fast, he also has one of the most fearsome abilities in the series. Daemon can redirect an opponent&#39;s attack back on them, and this activates automatically once someone simply thinks of hurting Daemon. Just like the Omnipotence possessed by his sister Eida, Daemon&#39;s power was created by Amado, imitating the divine abilities of the Otsutsuki god, Shibai. The only caveat to this ability is that Daemon must be touching the person who is attacking him, making him vulnerable to long-range attacks. Still, with Daemon&#39;s speed and raw power, this is hardly an issue. Even Amado said that when it comes to combat, Daemon is stronger than Ishikki and Naruto.






 Daemon Will Be The First Test Of Boruto&#39;s New Strength 
          

Boruto is now stronger than ever, and he defeated Code in his strongest form without even using his Karma. With his two main opponents from Part 1, Code and Kawaki, now outmatched by Boruto, the series needs to set up a new threat for the protagonist as soon as possible. Daemon&#39;s introduction earlier in the series caused quite a stir due to his overpowered abilities, so it would be only fitting to see him take a bigger role in the story now. Considering how cool and impressive Boruto has been after his return, he deserves a dangerous villain that can pose a real threat to him, and Daemon checks all the boxes.
