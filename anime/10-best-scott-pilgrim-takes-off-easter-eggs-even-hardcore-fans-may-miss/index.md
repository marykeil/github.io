With the help of Science SARU&#39;s animation and Anamanaguchi&#39;s music, SPTO delivered an experience that both new and existing fans can enjoy.

 10  Return Of The Game&#39;s Ludicrously Long Limo 
Episode 2 &#34;A League of Their Own&#34;
        

At the beginning of episode two, Scott&#39;s funeral helped establish that Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would be very different from the previous incarnations. Still, the funeral quickly escalates into one of the most thrilling funerals in history once Scott&#39;s big ex, Envy Adams, arrives in a giant limo that players of the Scott Pilgrim game might have recognized. World three in the game begins with Envy and her band &#34;The Clash At Demonhead&#34; arriving at the Leo&#39;s Place venue in the same stretch limo that is possibly hundreds of feet long.





 9  Scott&#39;s Movie Rental Late Fee&#39;s Have Gone Up A Lot 
Episode 3 &#34;Ramona Rents A Video&#34;
        

The Scott Pilgrim comic and video game prove that Scott is terrible at returning movie rentals in any form of media he&#39;s adapted into. Netflix&#39;s anime series is no exception. His late fee at the series movie rental store, No-Account Video, has increased significantly since it was last shown as $504.25 in the Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Video Game. Episode three displays a Most Wanted poster with Scott&#39;s happy-go-lucky picture on it, seen with a late fee of $3500 on the video store&#39;s Wall of Shame. Kim Pine showcases the new fee when Ramona confronts her at work about Scott&#39;s disappearance.
Paying off Scott&#39;s late fee in the game unlocks special power-up items. 






 8  Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World Movie Director (Sorta) Cameo 
Episode 4 &#34;Whatever&#34; &amp; Episode 5 &#34;Lights. Camera. Sparks?!&#34;
        

Edgar Wright, director of the Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World movie, helped create the Netflix anime series as its Executive Producer. However, there is a character in the series that shares many similarities to the talented filmmaker. Episode four, titled &#34;Whatever,&#34; features a film set with a director named Edgar Wrong, who also bares a striking resemblance to Edgar Wright. The character isn&#39;t voiced by the director but instead the talented Kevin McDonald, whose audiences might recognize from Lilo &amp; Stitch and The Kids in the Hall sketch show. Still, it isn&#39;t the only reference to the 2010 film&#39;s crew.





 7  Legendary Director of Photography Bill Pope Gets A Nod 
Episode 4 &#34;Whatever&#34; &amp; Episode 5 &#34;Lights. Camera. Sparks?!&#34;
        

During the filming of the Scott Pilgrim movie in the Scott Pilgrim anime series, episode five&#39;s multiple takes gag includes a slate for the film that also lists Edgar Wrong as the director. However, the live-action movie&#39;s director of photography, Bill Pope, also gets his own Easter egg in the fake film&#39;s slate. Jan De Pope is listed as the one in charge of the fake film&#39;s camera work, an obvious nod to the legendary cinematographer. Bill Pope&#39;s talents have helped create films such as the original Matrix Trilogy, 2004&#39;s Spider-Man 2, and dozens of other high-profile movies.

 6  The Teen Actress Lucas Puked On Is A Scott Pilgrim Star 
Episode 4 &#34;Whatever&#34;
        

Chris Evan&#39;s cocky movie star character Lucas Lee steals most of the scenes he is in, and one of those scenes has him mentioning Winifred Hailey, the villain in the side-story Free Scott Pilgrim. Hailey is a teenage movie star briefly mentioned in Volume 2 of the original Scott Pilgrim comics. She is also seen in the live-action movie on Lucas Lee&#39;s film set before he and Scott battle. Scott fights evil clones of the actress in the side-story comic, but she doesn&#39;t get more than a mention from Lee during SPTO. When confronted by Ramona about Scott&#39;s disappearance, Lee&#39;s alibi is that he was at an LA film premiere where he puked on Winifred Hailey.





 5  Simon Pegg &amp; Nick Frost Are Now In The Scott Pilgrim Franchise 
Episodes 4 &#34;Whatever&#34; &amp; 8 &#34;The World Vs Scott Pilgrim&#34;
        

Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have finally found a way into the Scott Pilgrim franchise. The two talented actors became well known for their comedic chemistry and for starring in many of Wright&#39;s projects. The pair were absent from Wright&#39;s 2010 adaptation but have lent their voices as security guards in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. Both characters can be seen guarding the movie studio&#39;s lot entrance in several scenes. Pegg and Frost had played lead roles in most of Wright&#39;s projects before Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, so it was a surprise that neither had a role in the movie. Still, after 13 years, they&#39;ve found a way into the beloved world that Wright has helped create.





 4  The Return Of Edgar Wright&#39;s Cornetto&#39;s 
Episode 8 &#34;The World Vs Scott Pilgrim&#34;
        

In the series final episode, Frost and Pegg&#39;s Scott Pilgrim Takes Off characters Security Officers #1 &amp; 2 are seen eating delicious ice cream treats known as Cornettos, another direct nod to Edgar Wright&#39;s previous works. The two actors played leads in three Edgar Wright films known as the Cornetto Trilogy, where each film featured the tasty treats at pivotal points of the movies story. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and At World&#39;s End make up the trilogy and come highly recommended for fans of the humor featured in the Scott Pilgrim franchise.
&#34;Weird Al&#34; Yankovic provided the voice of the narrator in Episode 5 of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. 






 3  Comeau May Not Have Introduced Scott To Ramona, But His Actor Returned 
Episode 5 &#34;Lights. Camera. Sparks?!&#34;
        

Not every character from the Scott Pilgrim movie and comics could return in the Netflix series due to the story being so different from the source material. One is the character Comeau, the guy who &#34;knows everyone&#34; and is the first person to inform Scott of Ramona Flower&#39;s identity at Julie&#39;s party. However, the actor who played Comeau, Nelson Franklin, in the film does return in Scott Pilgrim Takes Off as the voice of the documentary filmmaker who records the behind-the-scenes shenanigans of the movie being made during episode 5.





 2  Each Episode&#39;s Title Card Is Themed From A Classic Video Game

Classic game title fonts from Street Fighter II, Super Mario Bros., Skate or Die, and more are emulated with the name of each episode of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.

The amazing chiptune music from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game was created by Anamanaguchi, and the band nailed the assignment so hard that they were brought back to create an entirely new soundtrack for the Netflix anime. Beautiful moments that build up in musical splendor, like Kim and Knives&#39;s first jam session and the epic music for Ramona and Roxie&#39;s battle, were brought to you by Anamanaguchi and composer Joseph Trapanese.

Unlike many ongoing franchises that stuff new content with Easter eggs to help fuel the audience&#39;s nostalgia, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off is more committed to telling a new story and creating a world that&#39;s lived in for its characters, not the franchise fans. Each reference to previous adaptations felt like a creative decision that heightened the product instead of one that panders for a cheap thrill. The series creators were incredibly clever with the Easter eggs sprinkled throughout the anime series that each helped make Scott Pilgrim Takes Off a rewarding journey for new and existing fans.
