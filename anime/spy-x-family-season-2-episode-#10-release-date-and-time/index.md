 What Happened In Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #9? 
          




Spy x Family season 2, episode #9 begins with Anya and Loid heading back after the firework show when Loid finds out about a bomb planted on the ship. Anya usees her telepathy to read Loid&#39;s mind and asks him to leave her at a daycare nearby, planning to slip away and find Yor while also allowing Loid to deal with the bomb. Loid disguises himself and begins defusing the bomb while Anya overhears the thoughts of the assassins&#39; informant as he attempts to escape while Yor is occupied. Meanwhile, Loid successfully defuses the bomb but figures out that there may be more still ticking away on the ship.

          

Meanwhile, Yor shares a touching moment with Olka before they bid farewell. The Director lets Yor know that Anya and Loid have asked to meet her the next day and allows her to do so as a reward for completing her mission. After defusing the bombs (with some help from Anya) Loid makes it back to the daycare to find Anya fast asleep and carries her back to their cabin. As the sun rises, the Forger family wake up to see the ship approaching the port.






 Spy x Family Season 2 Episode #10 Will See the Forgers Reunite 
          

Season 2 episode #10 of Spy x Family is titled &#34;Enjoy the Resort to the Fullest / Bragging About Vacation&#34; and will likely follow Loid, Yor, and Anya finally enjoying the trip together. Now that Yor&#39;s mission is over, the Forger family will finally get the chance to get together, so fans can expect plenty of Spy x Family&#39;s signature family fun and comedy from the trio.

Based on the title, the episode will likely also feature the Forgers returning home with plenty of memories to share, especially in Anya&#39;s case, who is probably dying to talk about all the excitement of the cruise adventure. Nevertheless, the upcoming episode of Spy x Family is sure to be a humorous delight.
