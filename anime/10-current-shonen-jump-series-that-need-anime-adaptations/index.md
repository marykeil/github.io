## Literature Review

From long-running series to recent breakout hits with a lot of potential, these 10 Shonen Jump manga desperately need anime adaptations.




2024 will be a great year for Shonen Jump fans, as many manga from the magazine are receiving anime adaptations. However, there are still a myriad of other titles in Jump&#39;s various publications that deserve an anime adaptation of their own. These series range from long-running titles to newer series that have already made a big impression and show a lot of potential.
In recent years, Shonen Jump has unfortunately canceled many great manga before they had a chance to be adapted into an anime. These axings were so frequent that they led to the unofficial “Under 19 Club”, which memorialized series that were canceled before they reached even their 20th chapter.
However, with major flagship series like My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen set to end this year, Shonen Jump may be more cautious with canceling its newest series, hoping that one will gather enough of a following to replace those major titles. One way to potentially build this following is through anime adaptations, and there are plenty of Jump series that deserve it.









 








 10  Martial Master Asumi is a Grounded Fighting Manga 
Created by Kawada
        

Martial Master Asumi is a new series following the young MMA fighter Nito as he discovers his passion for fighting. The series represents a new direction for Shonen Jump to explore for both its sports and action manga, following in the footsteps of such great manga as Hajime no Ippo or Ashita no Joe.
Despite those series being well regarded, surprisingly few modern series have tried to explore the more realistic and down-to-earth fighting that Martial Master Asumi revels in. This leaves a void for a potential anime adaptation of Martial Master Asumi to fill, although since it&#39;s still in its early arcs it’s unclear if it will last long enough to receive one.

 9  MamaYuyu Puts a Stylish Spin on Fantasy Tropes 
Created by Yoshihiko Hayashi
        

MamaYuyu is still a very new series, but its innovative storytelling style and unique premise make it a manga that deserves an adaptation. The story follows a young Hero named Corleo who must team up with a ragtag group of Heroes and Demon Lords from other dimensions to stop a major threat. The series is a love letter to many classic fantasy stories that puts its own spin on the concept as well. If its anime adaptation could carry over its unique style to a different medium, it could be one of the most artistic shows of the year it airs.

 8  Kagurabachi Lives Up To Its Immense Hype 
Created by Takeru Hokazono
        

Kagurabachi is another relatively new manga that was massively hyped upon its release. While this was partially a meme, the series itself has proven that it is good enough to deserve an anime adaptation. The manga follows a boy named Chihiro who is hunting down his father’s killers with a magical katana.
The series’ fights have been gorgeously presented so far and Chihiro has proven himself to be a compelling character that fans want to root for. While there are still a lot of mysteries the series needs to answer, the taste fans have seen proves that a great anime adaptation of it could be Shonen Jump’s next megahit.

 7  Show-ha Shoten! Makes Comedy Compelling 
Created by Akinari Asakura and Takeshi Obata
        

Show-ha Shoten! is a monthly manga series released in the monthly Jump Square magazine that follows a pair of up-and-coming comedians as they compete against other rising stars. While this may not sound like the most interesting concept, the compelling characters keep the story engaging despite its niche subject matter.
The art by Death Note artist Takeshi Obata also allows this story to shine, with many of the more abstract aspects of performing conveyed through visual metaphors. The hit anime Oshi no Ko showed that series about the entertainment industry can be just as popular as more action-oriented shows, which means that an adaptation of Show-ha Shoten! could be a way to capitalize on that trend.

 6  Cipher Academy Is An Excitingly Unique Story 
Created by Nisioisin and Yuji Iwasaki


 







Cipher Academy is one of the most exciting manga in Shonen Jump right now, but that’s not what makes it so perfect for an anime adaptation. The story follows Iroha Irohazaka as he rises in the ranks of an elite school where everything revolves around solving codes. This premise allows the series to have some of the wildest fights and arcs in Shonen manga.
In addition, the wide cast of characters is both memorable and likable, with each having their own personalities and strengths. This series is truly one of a kind and thus needs an anime adaptation to expose its unique brand of awesomeness to a broader audience.
Nisioisin also wrote the popular Monogatari series.

 5  Choujin X is a Dark Successor to Tokyo Ghoul 
Created by Sui Ishida
        

Choujin X is a dark fantasy manga by the creator of Tokyo Ghoul that is being serialized in Tonari no Young Jump. It shares many similarities to that acclaimed series but is still distinct enough to feel unique. It follows Azuma who becomes a supernatural being known as a Choujin, which strains his personal relationships and puts a target on his back.
Ishida&#39;s works have an unfortunate history of being adapted poorly so hopefully an anime of Choujin X would be able to buck this trend and bring the story faithfully to screen. The manga&#39;s inconsistent release dates may hamper the anime&#39;s production schedule, however.

 4  Kindergarten Wars Puts a Fun Spin on Child Care 
Created by You Chiba
        

Kindergarten Wars is a manga serialized by Shonen Jump&#43;, the same online publication that hosts the hit manga Spy x Family. Kindergarten Wars actually has a lot of similarities to that series, as it follows the assassin Rita as she protects the children of the rich and powerful at the safest daycare in the world.
The cast is fun, the action is dynamic, and the series even knows how to effectively tug at the heartstrings when it wants to. Given the success of Spy x Family&#39;s anime adaptation, it seems almost inevitable that this series will also receive one and that it will be a great success.

 3  Witch Watch Perfectly Balances Comedy and Drama 
Created by Kenta Shinohara
        

Witch Watch is a gag manga following the young witch Nico as she attends high school and slowly accrues a posse of magical creatures to protect her from the dark forces that want to use her power. Unlike some of the other manga on this list, this series is already pretty long, with over 100 chapters already released and many more seemingly on the way.
While it is a hilarious gag manga, it also knows when to get serious with more emotional moments. It is clear the series is heavily influenced by the iconic manga Gintama and now that that anime has ended an adaptation of Witch Watch could easily fill the void it left behind.
The series has even featured Gintama&#39;s author as a character.

 2  Akane-banashi Makes a Niche Art Fascinating 
Created by Yuki Suenaga and Takamasa Moue


 







Akane-banashi is a wonderful manga about the incredibly niche subject of Rakugo, a specific type of Japanese performance art. The series follows Akane as she attempts to become a professional performer of this art. This may sound boring on the surface but the way the manga presents Rakugo performances is enthralling. The cast is also great with each performer having their own unique style and backstory.
This non-standard subject allows Akane-banashi to subvert and reinvent many common Shonen tropes in fascinating ways. Given the anime could improve on these performances by adding great vocal performances and music this series needs an anime adaptation to elevate its story even further.

 1  Sakamoto Days Has Fights That Need to Be Animated 
Created by Yuto Suzuki


 







Sakamoto Days is a superb action series following the retired hitman Sakamoto as he must reenter the world of assassins after a hit is put out on him. The series mixes humor and serious moments well and most of the cast is entertaining to watch. However, where this manga truly excels is in its epic fight scenes.
Sakamoto Days has the best-choreographed action scenes in Shonen Jump, even beating tough competition like Jujutsu Kaisen. These fights would look incredible in animation and the series would likely be a major hit because of them. With over 100 chapters already released, and no sign of ending soon Sakamoto Days is the Shonen Jump series that needs an anime adaptation the most.
