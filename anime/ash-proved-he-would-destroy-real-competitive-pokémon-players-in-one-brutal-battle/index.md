# Ash Proved He Would Destroy Real Competitive Pokémon Players in One Brutal Battle


## SUMMARY 



  Ash&#39;s unconventional strategies triumph over a player using typical competitive Pokémon strategies in a tournament battle.   Ash&#39;s Gible defeats Conway&#39;s Shuckle by biting it and using Draco Meteor to launch it into the air, a surprising move that knocks out Shuckle in one strike.   Ash&#39;s unexpected move of having Gible devour the energy of Dusknoir&#39;s Shadow Punch helps him break through Conway&#39;s strategy and claim victory.

## Literature Review

Ash&#39;s tournament aspirations once brought him against an opponent using real competitive Pokémon strategies, but his idiosyncratic style still won. 




It&#39;s fair to say that in the Pokémon anime, Ash&#39;s strategies aren&#39;t usually ones that would work well in the Pokémon video games. However, when a tournament battle put Ash up against a player using conventional competitive Pokémon strategies, it was actually Ash&#39;s often-bizarre game plan that came out on top.




In the third round of Sinnoh&#39;s Lily of the Valley conference, Ash was set up to battle a recurring character (based on the old &#34;Super Nerd&#34; trainer class), Conway, who was said to be an expert at formulating battle strategies. Conway&#39;s strategies actually do resemble those used by competitive Pokémon players in real life tournaments, so this certainly looked like it would be a difficult battle for Ash, who doesn&#39;t always take the time to think through a strategy beforehand.

          

In &#34;Working on a Right Move!&#34;, Conway begins their three versus three match-up with his Shuckle, a Pokémon with one of the highest defense stats in the series, while Ash uses Noctowl--a Pokémon with type disadvantage to Shuckle&#39;s Rock-typing, shocking Conway.





 Real Pokémon Strategies Still Work in the Anime 
          

Conway begins by having his Shuckle use Withdraw repeatedly, which increases its defense even further. Conway then uses Power Trick, which swaps a Pokémon&#39;s defense and attack stats, suddenly giving it incredible attack power. It becomes clear to Ash that his shiny Noctowl won&#39;t be able to damage Shuckle, so he recalls it and switches in Donphan, which doesn&#39;t fair much better. Ash pulls out his final Pokémon, Gible, which immediately latches on to Shuckle by biting it. With Shuckle in its mouth, Gible uses Draco Meteor, sending Shuckle flying high into the sky along with the projectiles and knocking out Shuckle in one strike once it hits the ground.

Conway then proceeds to use a Lickilicky, but things really get interesting once he&#39;s down to his final Pokémon, Dusknoir. Dusknoir uses a Trick Room setup, creating an area in which slower Pokémon (like Dusknoir) can move first, another real competitive strategy. Dusknoir is easily able to defeat Noctowl and Donphan for good, leaving only Gible. As Conway orders Dusknoir to deliver a Shadow Punch, Ash hilariously orders Gible to bite its fist, which stops the hit with Gible devouring the energy of the attack. Conway is stunned at this bizarre move, giving Ash the edge to break through his strategy and claim victory.






 Ash&#39;s Unconventional Strategies Win Out 
          

Ash really had no reason to think that Gible &#34;eating&#34; Shadow Punch would work, yet he tried it anyway, and it worked flawlessly, to the shock of everyone watching. It&#39;s perhaps the most ludicrous case of Ash&#39;s Pokémon pulling off the seemingly impossible, but it was enough to defeat Conway and move on to the next round of the tournament. While Ash ultimately doesn&#39;t win the Lily of the Valley championship, this battle proved that at least in the world of the Pokémon anime, Ash&#39;s bizarre and unconventional strategies can come out on top even against the best strategies a competitive player could muster.

               Pokemon   Summary:   Spanning over twenty-five years, Pokemon, known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is the multimedia franchise created jointly by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Conceptualized by Satoshi Tajiri in association with Ken Sugimori and Junichi Masuda, Pokemon is set in fictional worlds where people live together with tamable creatures known as Pokemon. Humans who catch, raise, and battle the creatures are known as Pokemon Trainers. They head out on extensive journeys across their continents to raise their Pokemon with the ultimate goal of competing in tournaments to become the champion. Pokemon spans several massive properties, from a long-running animated series to a successful trading card game, to the medium that started it all, video games. In addition, Pokemon began the &#34;two-game&#34; trend where two versions of a game would release and include different Pokemon/features between the versions, encouraging players to meet up with others and trade so they could &#34;catch &#39;em all.&#34;    Created by:   Satoshi Taijiri, Ken Sugimori, Junichi Masuda    First Film:   Pokemon: The First Movie    Latest Film:   Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle    First TV Show:   Pokemon    First Episode Air Date:   1997-04-01    Current Series:   Pokemon    Video Game(s):   Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokemon Snap, Pokémon GO    TV Show(s):   Pokemon
