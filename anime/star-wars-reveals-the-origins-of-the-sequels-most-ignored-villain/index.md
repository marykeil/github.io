Summary

  In Darth Vader #42, readers are introduced to Lieutenant Enric Pryde, revealing his more humble origins before his role as a key General in The Rise of Skywalker.   Pryde becomes a hostage and bait for Darth Vader in a trap set by elite Rebel soldiers.   While Vader initially shows little interest in Pryde, it will be interesting to see if he can prove his value to the Dark Lord in future issues.  







Star Wars finally reveals the origins of one of the sequel trilogy&#39;s most overlooked villains. Set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Marvel&#39;s ongoing Darth Vader series features the titular Dark of the Sith in need of new allies and resources as he considers whether to try and overthrow his master once more. To that end, a familiar (albeit younger) face has emerged as a potentially new agent for the Dark Lord.

As seen in the new Darth Vader #42 by Greg Pak and Adam Gorham, readers are introduced to a young Lieutenant Enric Pryde who quickly becomes a hostage held by a group of Rebel soldiers who happened to raid the Imperial garrison he was inspecting. However, Darth Vader arrives not soon after, intentionally entering the trap that had been set for him by the Rebellion&#39;s M.A.R Corps (Machine-Augmented Rebels).

          




To that end, Lieutenant Pryde was very clearly the bait, a position giving him very humble origins compared to his known future during Star Wars&#39; sequel trilogy, specifically his role in The Rise of Skywalker.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Who Is The Empire&#39;s Lieutenant Enric Pryde? 
The First Order General&#39;s Star Wars History Finally Revealed
          

His first appearance being in The Rise of Skywalker, the First Order&#39;s Allegiant General Pryde was played by Richard E. Grant. Pryde was part of the second wave of First Order leadership, though very little was known about him other than he was a rival to General Hux and served Palpatine during the Galactic Civil War. Having gained Palpatine&#39;s trust, Pryde was given command of the Final Order fleet following Hux&#39;s execution following the reveal that he&#39;d been feeding information to the Resistance due to his hatred of Kylo Ren. Pryde subsequently died during the Battle of Exegol on board The Steadfast.




While Adam Christopher&#39;s Shadow of the Sith novel reveals more about Pryde&#39;s history both at the end and in the years following the Galactic Civil War (such as his command on Endor where he made a fur coat out of Ewok skins), Darth Vader #42 marks Prdye&#39;s earliest appearance as an Imperial lieutenant who interacted with Darth Vader himself. As such, it should prove rather interesting to see his career continue ahead of the Battle of Endor.



 Will Pryde Continue Serving Darth Vader? 
The Imperial Lieutenant Must Prove His Value
          

Although Pryde sees an opportunity to prove himself by serving Darth Vader directly, the Dark Lord is less than interested in the lieutenant who&#39;d been thrown in a cage by Rebels. Keeping that in mind, a rejection from Vader would help explain why Pryde was so eager to defy Kylo Ren in The Rise of Skywalker and instead serve Palpatine once more in the Star Wars timeline. However, perhaps Pryde be given a chance to prove his value to Vader in the issues to come.
