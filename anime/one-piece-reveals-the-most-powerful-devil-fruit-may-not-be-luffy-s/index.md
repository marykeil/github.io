# One Piece Reveals The Most Powerful Devil Fruit May Not Be Luffy s


## SUMMARY 



  Bonney&#39;s devil fruit has the potential to rival Luffy&#39;s Gear Five by imitating Sun God Nika&#39;s powers.   Bonney&#39;s Distorted Future technique allows her to emulate the powers of Luffy&#39;s devil fruit, including turning her body into rubber and altering her physical characteristics.   Bonney&#39;s transformation into Nika suggests that her powers are only limited by her imagination, and she may be able to mimic the full extent of Nika&#39;s power in the future.

## Literature Review

One Piece reveals a surprising devil fruit is possibly much stronger than even Luffy&#39;s and can even copy his strongest transformation in the series.




Warning: Contains spoilers for chapter #1101 of One Piece.




One Piece has just revealed what could be its most powerful devil fruit yet, and it isn&#39;t Luffy&#39;s. Since the introduction of Gear Five, Luffy&#39;s devil fruit has quickly established itself as the zenith of powers in One Piece, with the series even going as far as to call it &#34;the most ridiculous power in the world.&#34; However, the latest chapter uncovers the frightening possibilities of Jewelry Bonney&#39;s devil fruit, whose true power could very well rival even the extraordinary powers of Gear Five and Sun God Nika.

Chapter #1101 of One Piece Bonney and Kuma&#39;s flashback as Bonney attempts to flee from Sorbet Kingdom and the Government agents holding her hostage after her recovery to find Kuma. The chapter reveals Bonney can use her Distorted Future technique to emulate the powers of Luffy&#39;s devil fruit as she turns her body into rubber and punches Alpha, one of the Cipher Pol agents, with a giant fist much like in Luffy&#39;s Gear Third Giant Pistol.

          




This revelation imperceptibly widens the possibilities of Bonney&#39;s devil fruit, whose true potential may be far more deadly than even Gear Five and Luffy&#39;s devil fruit powers.

                  One Piece Is About To Get Its Most Tearful Reunion, &amp; It&#39;s Not Luffy &amp; Shanks   The Egghead arc has set up one incredible One Piece reunion that will be hard to top, even for Luffy and Shanks.   


 Bonney&#39;s Distorted Future Technique Opens Up More Possibilities Than Gear Five 
          

Bonney carries out her transformation into Nika based solely on the little knowledge of Nika given to her by Kuma, which seems to suggest that her powers, much like those of Luffy&#39;s fruit, may be limited solely by her imagination and what she deems a possible alternative future. However, Bonney&#39;s Distorted Future technique also appears to allow her to adopt the physical traits of the being she turns into, which arguably surpasses the abilities of the Nika fruit.




Luffy can also alter the size of his body in Gear Five, and it looks like Bonney can do that and even more. Bonney&#39;s transformation into Nika implies her Distorted Future technique also allows her to alter her physical characteristics, opening up a world of possibilities. Though for a limited time, Bonney could perhaps even turn into a Lunarian like King with all his invincibility or a powerful Buccaneer like Kuma.

                  One Piece Settles The Mystery Of Bonney&#39;s True Age With A Big Controversy   One Piece has finally settled the debate about Bonney&#39;s true age, but the reveal causes its fair share of controversy.   

Either way, seeing as Bonney has yet to witness Gear Five or the full extent of Nika&#39;s power for herself, perhaps her next transformation into Nika will see her mimic the absurdity of the power in full after seeing Luffy fight. Considering One Piece&#39;s flair for the unexpected, fans might also get to see Luffy and Bonney team up against Saint Saturn, making the epic showdown on Egghead Island a battle against not one but two Nikas.
