## Literature Review

From emotional flashbacks to shocking revelations and stunning action scenes, the Wano Arc is the pinnacle of One Piece&#39;s storytelling and animation.




One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc tells a timeless story of tragedy, sacrifice, and hope and has ultimately proven that One Piece still has many surprises in store despite its twenty-five-year-long runtime.




Wano was easily one of the most anticipated destinations in the New World since its introduction during Thriller Bark and needless to say, the arc did not disappoint. Despite its shortcomings and arguably formulaic structure, the Wano Arc is a testament to One Piece&#39;s ability to continually outdo itself with every new story arc and has showcased the series&#39; exciting potential in terms of animation and storytelling.

                  20 Best Scenes In One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc   From Oden&#39;s epic death to Luffy&#39;s sensational awakening, these are some of the scenes that make the Wano Arc the best in One Piece&#39;s history.   


 The Wano Arc Was A Treat To The Eyes 
          

While most of the qualities of this arc were showcased in the manga, once the Wano Arc hit the One Piece anime it showcased great strides in animation quality for the show, not just with the debut of Gear Five which broke the internet but throughout various battles during the Onigashima Raid. Wano has had some of the best action sequences the series has witnessed so far, each choreographed to perfection with not a single dull moment. Each battle has its own unique color palette best seen in the climatic battles on Onigashima against King, Queen, and Big Mom each of which has a distinct style of animation and feel.




Wano has also given fans some of the most stunning landscape shots that wonderfully highlight the tragic beauty of the country ravaged by Kaido and Orochi. Together with the excellent direction and the chilling score by Kohei Tanaka, the Wano Arc is a treat to the senses that brings the manga to life in unimaginably immersive ways as its story tugs at viewers&#39; heartstrings.



 One Piece&#39;s Wano Arc Tells a Deeply Resonating Story 
          

The premise of saving an island from a scheming tyrant is a tried and tested formula in One Piece. While the Wano Arc does not stand out as particularly exceptional in that regard, where it does excel is how it takes this recycled formula and manages to make it resonate among fans like never before. Drawing deep inspiration from the Japanese tradition of Kabuki theatre, Wano has managed to evoke strong emotions, the likes of which the series has accomplished only once before during the Marineford Arc, adding to the consensus that the arc might even steal the latter&#39;s spot as the best arc of the series, and Wano&#39;s story certainly had that potential.




Wano&#39;s tragic tale is one that gradually reveals itself to the Straw Hats and viewers alike. Luffy first encounters this tragedy through the eyes of Otama, who despite not having eaten for weeks, offers her hard-earned food to him. As the story progresses, Wano&#39;s tragedy and suffering become increasingly severe as viewers witness the sorry state of Okobore Town, Ebisu, Town, and finally Udon Prison with its walls filled with broken spirits.

          

Thus, what started out as a simple adventure in the land of samurai quickly turns into an unexpected rollercoaster of emotions as the Straw Hats and viewers find out that there may be far more to this adventure than simply defeating an Emperor and dethroning the shogun, and that Wano&#39;s struggle for freedom is one that has been in the works for twenty long years.




While arcs such as Alabasta, Drum Island, Skypeia, and Dressrosa also follow a similar structure, Wano raises the stakes in an unprecedented manner. The residents of Wano have suffered far more than any other island the Straw Hats have encountered thus far and the journey to free them has been equally difficult. Although there have been countless instances when Luffy has come close to death, Wano makes it clear that death is the only other option besides victory and this point is driven home toward the climax of the Onigashima Raid. Add to this the sacrifices of beloved characters such as Pedro, Lord Yasui, and Oden, whom the Wano arc takes care to flesh out, and the stakes on Wano feel as real as ever.

                  Two of One Piece&#39;s Wano Deaths Are More Important Than Fans Think   One Piece&#39;s chapter 1052 reveals that Kozuki Oden&#39;s retainers Ashura Doji and Izo were tragically killed during the battle for Wano Country&#39;s freedom.   



 Wano Explored Several Characters In Depth 
         




Wano handled all of its characters, major and minor alike, exceptionally well and while One Piece has always been infamous for its heart-wrenching flashbacks, Wano&#39;s flashbacks were especially poignant. These flashbacks together with the excellent matchups on Onigashima created opportunities for plenty of nuanced character development, especially in the case of the Straw Hats.

The Wano arc tested every Straw Hat&#39;s loyalty through their respective battles and in some cases even saw the culmination of their character arcs. An excellent example is Sanji, who through his battle against Queen was finally forced to come to terms with his Germa lineage and got the closure he needed since the events on Whole Cake Island. Even Luffy goes through quite an arc of his own during his fight against Kaido, which eventually leads to him awakening his Devil Fruit and becoming &#34;the warrior of liberation&#34;. It goes without saying that the most notable character arc during Wano is that of Momonosuke, whose long, hard journey finally culminates in him becoming the brave leader he was always meant to be for the finale of the Wano arc.




That said, Wano made sure to give even minor characters their chance in the limelight. Arguably some of Wano&#39;s saddest stories are those of Otama, Otoko, Hiyori, and the residents of Ebisu town, with their struggle to simply stay alive. The arc gives every one of these stories its own moment and it is the epic culmination of these various character arcs, decisions, and sacrifices by various characters across a span of twenty years that make Wano&#39;s story as impactful as it is.

          

Overall, the significance of the Wano arc both culturally and thematically is undeniable. The evocative themes it explored, together with its stunning animation and beautifully choreographed action sequences prove the Wano Arc certainly had the potential to be One Piece&#39;s magnum opus if not for a few missteps with pacing and the few loose ends left unfinished toward the end. Regardless, these nitpicks do not take away from the fact that Wano still remains one of One Piece&#39;s most unforgettable sagas with some of the most exciting moments in the series in recent years. Wano has certainly widened the possibilities of what the anime is capable of, and the question remains if the much-anticipated final saga of One Piece will be able to surpass the quality of the Wano Arc.
