## Literature Review

The events of Jujutsu Kaisen chapter #236 have left a major mark on fans of the series, and they&#39;ve even caused a popular manga to go on hiatus.





Gojo’s death in Jujutsu Kaisen has been a major shock to fans all around the world, and that includes people in the manga industry, as well. It was recently announced in Weekly Shonen Sunday that Fly Me to the Moon would be going on a brief hiatus, and the reason given for that was because series creator Kenjiro Hata needed to recover from the shock of Jujutsu Kaisen chapter #236. This is hardly the first time fans have had such extreme reactions to a manga, and considering how much of a fan of Jujutsu Kaisen Hata is, it’s no wonder that these events would have impacted Fly Me to the Moon.





 Fly Me To The Moon’s Author Was Always A Jujutsu Kaisen Fan 
          

As odd as it might seem for Jujutsu Kaisen to make Fly Me to the Moon go on hiatus, Kenjiro Hata has long been established as a fan of Jujutsu Kaisen. Tsukasa, for example, has done the pose for Sukuna’s Malevolent Shrine multiple times in the manga, with its name and Domain Expansions even being explicitly referenced, and one chapter even featured Yuji in a cameo appearance. References like these and others make it clear that Hata has a great reverence for Jujutsu Kaisen, so the idea that he would have such a major reaction to Gojo’s death isn’t entirely unfounded.



 Jujutsu Kaisen Isn’t The First Time People Had A Big Reaction To A Manga 
          




Fly Me to the Moon’s Kenjiro Hata and others have had extreme reactions to Gojo’s death, but it’s not the first time something like that has happened. Oshi no Ko’s Mengo Yokoyari, for example, once said that she needed to take a break from X because of how nerve-wracking Chainsaw Man had become following Power’s death. More famously, when Ashita no Joe’s Toru Rikiishi died in 1970, an actual funeral was held in his honor with 700 fans in attendance. These examples make it clear that as extreme as the reactions to Gojo’s death are, manga fans have been doing stuff like this for decades, so it’s hardly anything new.

                  10 Most Brutal Jujutsu Kaisen Deaths   Jujutsu Kaisen has featured a lot of very devastating deaths over the course of the series, but these ten are the most brutal the manga has featured.   

If there’s anything to take from all of this, it’s a statement of how attached people can get to fictional characters. While it might seem ridiculous to have such visceral reactions to fictional characters, people will always get attached to stories that resonate with them, and manga has been no different, even in the decades before social media became a thing. Kenjiro Hata having to put Fly Me to the Moon on hiatus after what happened in Jujutsu Kaisen is just the latest of these sorts of events to happen, and with how popular the series is, it’s unlikely to be the last before the series comes to a close.
